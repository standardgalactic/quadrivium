About the Author
Growing up in Colorado, Colette Pitcher always made art — even if at first folks
weren’t convinced it was art. She majored in television communication at the
University of Northern Colorado but had enough art credits to graduate a year early
and did so. Her first job out of college was as a graphic designer for an engineering
and architectural firm. Her next job was in New York City for a Fortune 500 company,
and she later worked for a well-known children’s book author. While in New York, she
lived at West Point and attained an MBA from the University of Long Island.
She returned to Colorado in 1986 and started Art Department for companies that
didn’t have an art department in-house. In the 1990s, she founded the Showcase Art
Center in Greeley, Colorado, and filled it with other like-minded businesses and art stu-
dios. Activities at the Showcase have included Project Ability, for developmentally
disabled artists; a workshop for blind artists to use touch in 3-D artworks; and selling
art from Mozambique to fund a kindergarten in that country. The Showcase presents
art created by youth to encourage future artists and art by seniors to encourage life-
long creativity. It remains a great place to find art and supplies, framing, art-to-wear,
piano lessons, art classes, and art studios.
Colette also sculpts. Her husband Gary, owner of Dragon Casting (a bronze art
foundry), is also a creative resource for making the impossible come true daily.
Together the couple has installed many monumental bronze public artworks. Colette
is the author of Watercolor Painting For Dummies (Wiley) and on occasion writes for
PaintWorks magazine. She also writes and conducts demonstrations for art material
manufacturer conventions, including Loew-Cornell, Aamoco, Dynasty brushes,
Duncan, Fredrix canvas, and Speedball. She is a Rotarian, a member of Greeley Art
Association, a signature member of Colorado Watercolor Society, and an associate
member of the National Sculpture Society.


Dedication
This book is dedicated to my mother, Beth Irvine. I can never repay her for all she 
has done for me; heck, she made me what I am, literally. She encouraged, supported,
taught, role-modeled, and guided me through life. I could ask for no more or any
better.
Author’s Acknowledgments
I want to bless Wiley Publishing for allowing me to work with them again after working
on Watercolor Painting For Dummies. What I thought was a once-in-a-lifetime opportu-
nity turned into another positive experience. Mike Baker knew better at this point and
still asked me to write Acrylic Painting For Dummies. Thanks, Mike! My right-hand
editor in Holland, Corbin Collins sped through from schedule to completion with noth-
ing but nice comments (I am sure he bit his tongue on more than one occasion).
Chrissy Guthrie completed the editing efficiently for the second book (she also knew
better, and I am glad we got to work together again). Mary Morrison was the technical
advisor. Mary also works for Golden Acrylics as a working artist. She was a blast to
take workshops from in Denver and hear her enormous technical and chemical knowl-
edge, besides enjoying her beautiful artistic creations.  Megan Knoll was the copy
editor and was amazing editing, organizing, and making everything its best for the
reader. Clint Lahnen and his team were given just under 400 images to scan and 
prepare — a large job that was well done!  I do love you all.
I have to thank my better-half husband for letting me type all night and weekend. Gary
is always the support that an artist needs to really thrive. Whether it is ordering take-
out, or keeping the distractions low, he was always doing what needed to be done. I
owe you a vacation now!
Thanks to my co-workers who fielded phones and customers, cleaned, and kept the
business moving forward while I typed: Carol, May, Linda, Robin, and Lesli.
Thanks to my painting girlfriends (get some of these if you don’t have some): Donna,
Ann, Patty, Claudia, Suzie, Alaine, Delilah, Jean, Marcey, Cathy, Marilyn, and Norma.
The best part of art is sharing it, getting to know others, and growing together. Art
competitions and the marketplace tend to put artists in a competitive mood. The
longer I live, the more ridiculous this has become. We are all in this together, and
together we can accomplish anything! Love one another.

Acrylic Painting For Dummies 

Introduction
W
elcome to Acrylic Painting For Dummies! You’re about to embark on a
wonderful journey. Acrylic painting is a fun way to communicate
through art, and I love to share the “gospel” of art with others. A real dedica-
tion to art changes your life — challenges you, inspires you, and is your com-
panion for as long as you let it be. 
Acrylic paints are a great painting choice. They’re easy to use and simple to
clean up with soap and water, dry quickly, have no toxic fumes, allow you to
make changes quickly, and offer many surprise tricks. This book is your
ticket to exploring these and other aspects of acrylics.
About This Book
Given its title, you’re probably not surprised that this book is all about paint-
ing using acrylic paint — painting, as in you creating paintings. Although you
may get an appreciation of the art of painting by reading this book, there’s no
substitute for doing. You must paint yourself (that is, you must paint; whether
you paint a self-portrait or paint on yourself is up to you). It can not only be
one of the most satisfying activities you ever do, but it’s also the only way to
truly appreciate others’ work. It can help you see art for the first time with a
new appreciation of what you’re looking at.
So this book helps you do just that — actually paint. Most chapters offer at
least one step-by-step project that incorporates the theory and the tech-
niques introduced in that chapter. After duplicating the paintings, you can try
the projects again with subjects of your choosing. Although I give you all the
instructions to be successful in painting the exercise, you can also make your
own choices at any point. Want to change the painting size, surface, or color?
Do it. I encourage you to make the projects your own.
Along with all the painting projects, I also show you how to create interesting
effects, compose a good picture, and use color to full advantage — all in an
easy-to-access and easy-to-understand format. And I don’t use art speak — I
just tell you in plain English how to plan, compose, design, and paint. That’s
what you were hoping for when you picked up this book, isn’t it?
Conventions Used in This Book
When writing this book, I used a few conventions to make reading easier: 
 Italicized text shows up to define words or terms being used for the first
time in that chapter.
 “Acrylic paints” are often described as just “acrylics”.

 “Pigments,” “paint,” and “color” are often used to mean the same thing.
 Bold text indicates keywords in bulleted lists or the main instructions in
a numbered list.
 The occasional Web site or e-mail address appears in monofont to help
it stand out on the page.
What You’re Not to Read
Throughout the book, you’ll see sidebars that appear in separate boxes. The
information in the sidebar may be interesting (and I hope it is), and you may
want to read it (and I hope you do), but you don’t need to read it to under-
stand the topic at hand — so you can skip it if you like (and fortunately, I’ll
never know if you do). You may just want to flip through the book for the
sidebars one day.
The Technical Stuff icons are a similar story — if you like the nuts-and-bolts
and historical stuff, check out these interesting tidbits. If you just want to
paint already, you can skip ’em.
Foolish Assumptions
The only assumption I make about you is that you’re interested in acrylic
painting. I give you basic information about art in general and acrylics in par-
ticular, so you don’t need to know a thing about any art-related topic to bene-
fit from this book. If you picked it up, you’re already smart enough.
How This Book Is Organized
I arranged this book into six parts that contain chapters with information
related to a common theme.
Although the book reads and leads you logically in order from the beginning
to the future of your art, you don’t have to read it in order. You can skip
around to work on stuff that interests you. Techniques explained in different
chapters are cross-referenced so that if you need some technical how-to
information, you can turn to that chapter.
You can also use this book as a reference book. You can go to the table of
contents or index, look up what you need, and go straight to the relevant
page(s). In art you get a lot of information upfront, but you may not be ready
for it until you experience that problem. So you may want to read information
again after you have painted for a while. You may be painting along when you
suddenly realize, “That’s what she meant!” Then you can go back to read a
section or a chapter to cement the concept in your memory. You’ll have
many aha moments in your painting career.

Acrylic Painting For Dummies 

Part I: Getting Acquainted with Acrylics
If you’ve never painted, this part is the place to start. If you have painted, this
section may be a good refresher and an explanation of the tools and techniques
I use. Every artist has a different setup and approach. In these chapters I share
mine and tell you what techniques and practices have worked well for me.
I know you can’t wait to get started, so Chapter 1 has a project right away. In
Chapter 2, I cover the materials and products you can get in an art store and
give you the information you need to ask intelligent questions when choosing
your supplies. The world of acrylics includes many additives, mediums, and
enhancers, and Chapter 3 sorts out all of those.
Part II: Exploring Tricks and Techniques
Reading this part’s chapters and practicing the projects in them gives you a
firm grasp of fundamental acrylic skills. Chapter 4 describes basic acrylic
techniques (and these skills are actually appropriate with almost any paint)
and finishing needs. Chapter 5 launches into fun experimental techniques
that yield interesting textures. Chapter 6 gives you a fast drawing course,
including the drawing-transferring process you need throughout the book.
Part III: Finding the Fun in Fundamentals
Wonder why some paintings win awards? Hopefully, it’s because the artist uses
strong design and composition (although sometimes I can’t figure out why they
win, either — as the adage says, there’s no accounting for taste). Design and
composition comprise core knowledge or fundamentals that give you the lan-
guage to discuss art and improve your artistic planning and execution.
The chapters in this part show you how to mix and use color (Chapter 7) and
how to use the rules of design (Chapter 8), and then I put it all together to
help you make a strong composition (Chapter 9).
Part IV: Acrylic’s Versatile Styles
You can use acrylic to imitate several kinds of styles. Chapter 10 explores
using acrylic paint like a watercolor: loose, liquid, and in layers. Chapter 11
uses the paint thick and generous like an oil painting, and Chapter 12 lets it
all hang out by exploring abstract art.
Part V: Projects for Different Surfaces
Acrylic paint has special properties that allow you to use it as glue, so I
explore the art of collage in Chapter 13. Many other kinds of paint have to be
paired with certain surfaces, but not acrylic. You can use it on a variety of
surfaces, so I discuss the versatile surfaces of decorative arts in Chapter 14.

Introduction

Part VI: The Part of Tens
The chapters in this part are the icing on the cake. Chapter 15 suggests and
describes subjects you may want to paint, and Chapter 16 gives you ideas for
jump-starting your artistic passion.
Icons Used in This Book
Like any For Dummies book, I’ve tagged some information with icons to direct
your attention to specific text. The icons I use include the following:
This icon tips you off to historical or particularly technical info that’s plenty
interesting but not essential to the topic.
The text next to this icon shares a tidbit that helps make your art activity
easier. Trust me, I’ve made every mistake already for you, and I want to save
you some energy by not having to make the same unnecessary mistakes.
When you see this icon, get out your paints, brushes, and paper to either
duplicate a small painting project or try a technique.
This icon gives you a heads-up to remember certain information that may be
covered elsewhere but is important to keep in mind.
Nothing you can reasonably do in painting can hurt you (okay, don’t eat it),
but you may want to avoid the things this icon points out just to preserve
your artistic sensibilities and the beauty of your paintings.
Where to Go from Here
This is a For Dummies book, so you can start anywhere you like and jump
around as you like. But if you’re a complete newcomer to art or painting, I
suggest you turn to the chapters in Part I. If you want a refresher on art sup-
plies, and what to buy, these chapters can help. If you want to jump right in
and get your paints wet, turn to any of the chapters in Part II for painting
techniques of all descriptions. Part III takes off with improvement and design
skills. Part IV gives you plenty of projects to try some different styles. Part V
pushes acrylics into new directions of collage and decorative arts.
You’re about to set sail on a journey that can last a lifetime. Painting can take
you anywhere, show you anything, elevate your spirit, and calm your soul.
Art provides a way to communicate when you can’t find the words. It’s a com-
panion whenever you require one. Art will take you wherever you let it lead
you, so welcome aboard!
And remember: You learn and discover most by doing. The best advice I can
give you is to paint, paint, paint!

Getting Acquainted
with Acrylics

In this part . . .
A
mazing acrylics await you! These ﬁrst chapters are
all about the acrylic medium (another word for type
of paint) and the brushes, surfaces, and additives that
make acrylic work for every occasion. These three chap-
ters offer a basic understanding of all the supplies you
need, as well as the properties of acrylic paint and the
plethora of paint choices you face. And, of course, they
start you painting.

Chapter 1
Acrylics Are Awesome!
In This Chapter
 Discovering the wonders of acrylic painting
 Uncovering your artistic instincts
 Jumping right in to get painting
H
ave you ever thought, “I could paint like that” (or, “I wish I could paint
like that”) as you walked through an art show? If so, you’ve expressed a
desire to delve into the arts — even if only by looking at this book. There’s a
romantic view of artists as paint-covered, canvas-focused geniuses drawing
inspiration from some beautiful muse. And why not? Often that’s exactly what
an artist is doing.
In this chapter, I show you a few of the reasons acrylics are amazing as well as
explore what subject types make interesting paintings. You discover how to
develop your talent and style and collect the images that interest you. Finally,
you even personalize a sketchbook in order to get familar with your acrylic
paint (and then give you a place to collect sketches for painting ideas). 
What’s So Awesome About Acrylic Paint?
Have you walked into a well-stocked art supply store recently? It’s very excit-
ing, but it can also be a bit overwhelming to see all your choices. You’re bom-
barded with watercolor, tempera, oil, water-soluble oil, heat set oil, casein,
gouache, inks . . . and acrylic paints.
Acrylic paint is a perfect choice for beginners and experts alike. Why? You
can apply it in layers, which means you can make changes easily. It dries fast,
so you don’t have to wait long between layers. Cleanup is easy — just soap
and water; the lack of harsh, smelly solvents means acrylic paint is better for
your health than oil. Acrylics adhere to most everything (and when they don’t,
you can get special products to help fix that), so you can paint on a traditional
canvas or a decorative box. They can be used straight from the tube or bottle,
but you can also add mediums, gels, and pastes that can change the paint’s
thickness or finish to make it do just what you want it to do. For safe, easy,
flexible, permanent, versatile painting, acrylic paint is a fantastic choice.
The following sections give you more information on just what is so great
about acrylic paints.

Versatility
Acrylic paint is versatile. You can thin it with water to make it resemble
watercolor (see Chapter 10 for more on mimicking watercolor painting with
acrylic paint). You can also paint it on thick to give the impression of an oil
painting (see Chapter 11 for that). You can paint it on many surfaces; it works
fine with watercolor paper, canvas, and wood, among other things.
Acrylic is such a master of disguise that it may be difficult to decipher what a
finished artwork was painted with. It’s all in the hands of the artist — you.
The paint does whatever you ask of it.
Acrylic painting also creates quality works no matter how much time you
choose to spend on a painting or what mood you’re in. If you have time and
want to paint detailed precise paintings, you can work slowly and carefully to
do just that. If you want to achieve a looser look and simplify the detail,
acrylic still looks great. Take a look at the two styles of paintings in Figure 1-1.
I love to paint flowers. The two styles in that figure indicate what mood I was
in (and the amount of time I spent) when I painted each painting. I painted
the sweetheart roses by taking my time and paying close attention to detail.
Notice the heart-shaped dewdrop on the lower petal. The wheelbarrow was a
quicker, faster-flowing painting. When I stopped, I thought I hadn’t finished it,
but when I came back to it, I decided it didn’t need any more. Acrylic paint
will accommodate either style and amount of detail. 
Fast drying time
Acrylic dries quickly, so you don’t spend a lot of time waiting for it to dry.
That lets you paint layers much more quickly than you can with oil paint. You
can even manipulate the drying time if necessary for a particular project. (In
Chapter 3, I discuss attributes and additives of acrylic paint.)

Part I: Getting Acquainted with Acrylics 

Because acrylic does dry quickly, get into the habit of soaking acrylic paint-
loaded brushes in water when not in use. If you leave wet paint in brushes to
dry, they become useless.
Durable finish
Acrylic is also lightfast, meaning it doesn’t fade significantly over time. You
don’t want to sell your masterpiece for beaucoup bucks and then have it dis-
appear before the client’s eyes. Plus, acrylic’s tough finish means you don’t
necessarily need to frame your finished acrylic artwork behind glass — even
if it’s a work on paper. If you varnish your finished acrylic masterpiece, you
can frame it without a mat (a cardboard-like border) or glass. In fact, many
viewers complain that glass creates a glare. Another bonus is that this easier
framing is also less expensive framing because you don’t have the extra
expense of mat and glass. Chapter 4 discusses the final presentation of
acrylic paintings.
Resistance to cracking
Acrylic is thermoplastic. Thermo indicates “heat,” and plastic means “move-
able.” Basically, acrylic paint becomes flexible when it gets warm. This flexi-
bility is helpful compared to other kinds of paint because acrylic is less likely
to crack when dry. However, with flexibility comes caution: Acrylic paint also
runs the risk of becoming tacky when warm. So don’t stack thick paintings
face to face in a hot attic or garage because they may stick together. The
good news is acrylics also become stiffer in cold environments. If your paint-
ings become stuck, simply transfer them to a cool place (such as a basement)
and wait for them to release.
Nurturing and Growing the 
Acrylic Artist in You
Whether you want to be a full-time artist or just start a new hobby, acrylic
painting is a perfect way to explore the world, fill some time, challenge your
limits, focus your energy, impress friends and family, and learn to appreciate
the beauty that’s all around you.
Developing your own talents
Have you ever heard the warning “You must have talent” and felt like that was
an obstacle keeping you from even trying? Well, I’m here to tell you that that
kind of talent is mythical, fictitious nonsense. Show me someone who can
draw and paint and I will show you someone who has spent much time get-
ting there. Talent doesn’t fall from the sky onto your lap. I do give the good
Lord credit, but talent is developed and nurtured here on Earth. When I started,
I wasn’t very good. But I wanted to be good badly enough that I continued to
9
Chapter 1: Acrylics Are Awesome!

hone the craft — practicing my skills — so I could eventually say, “I am an
artist.” All you do need to succeed in art is aptitude and perseverance. You
have to want to be an artist. The rest is practice, study, practice, reading,
practice, observation, and practice. The good news? Practice is fun. 
Nurture your aptitude (or talent, or whatever you want to call it) to develop
it. Look at art books, art museums, and art shows every chance you get. Look
for art that you like, and try to understand art that may not appeal to you at
first. Study the old masters, and find living artists who can guide your own
spirit. Don’t underestimate the importance of talking with like-minded indi-
viduals, because nonartists may not understand. If you can, find a mentor.
Even the old masters apprenticed with a master artist of the time. The master
imparted wisdom and inspiration to the next generation of artists to keep the
arts flourishing.
Finding and capturing inspiration
What inspires you? You may get jazzed by beautiful figures of other people,
the perfection of nature, patterns, animals, or something especially meaning-
ful to you. It may even be painting itself: I find that I’m inspired more by how
a painting is done than by what it is. For example, a beautiful flow of colors
describing a simple grass meadow may be truly inspiring. The subject of the
grass meadow isn’t the exciting part; the brush work, color, and execution are
what elevates the painting. The way that light and shadow fall on a subject
often is the inspiration for artists. Look for what excites you when you see a
subject suitable for painting. Start to collect the ideas for painting subjects.
You don’t need anything elaborate to get started. If you have a pencil and a
little pocket notebook, you’re in business. Draw in that little notebook every
day — whatever you see. Collect shapes. Look outside and collect trees,
bushes, and anything else that catches your attention. When you get around
to designing paintings, you can refer to your collection of shapes and arrange
them into a painting. Chapter 6 has more tips on drawing.
Cameras are wonderful tools to collect painting ideas. I am never without my
camera, just in case something pops up that’s photo-worthy. However, don’t
replace drawing with using pictures. Nothing approaches the unique explo-
ration that happens when you really look at an item and try to re-create it on
paper. You spend more time seeing relationships between curves, angles, and
parts of the object. You learn. You may have seen that item a million times, but
until you try to draw it, you don’t realize that you’ve never really looked at it.
10
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Acrylics 
Art as stress relief
More good news: Drawing and painting can make
your stress disappear. A Zen-like feeling comes
over you when you sit down and take time to
observe and recreate. When I prepare to paint, I
gather my materials, get out my canvas, get the
lights right, and put the kettle on for some tea. I am
preparing my mind for what is coming next. It’s
almost like yoga. If you can turn off the phone,
maybe put on some music (preferably instrumen-
tal), and control any other interruptions, drawing
and painting are perfect ways to relieve stress.

Getting in the zone
I recommend instrumental music as a background soundtrack for your paint-
ing session. Why listen to music without words? It’s all about using your right
and left brain to their full advantage. Not to get all scientific on you — this is an
art book, for crying out loud — but studies do show that the left hemisphere of
the brain controls analytical functions (speech, numbers, time, organization,
and so on) and the right hemisphere houses the creative functions (spatial rela-
tionships, colors, problem solving, and so on). Instrumental music stimulates
your creative right brain without awakening your speech-controlling left brain
with lyrics. Of course, you’re not really only using half of your brain when you’re
drawing or painting (although I’m sure you know many half-brained people), but
you do get “in the zone.” Have you ever been traveling and realized that time
has flown by and you don’t remember how you got to your destination? The
same thing often happens while doing a creative project — you’re so busy doing
right-brain work that left-brain time considerations fall by the wayside.
You want to be in this spirit when you paint — so avoid the things that stimu-
late the left brain, like conversations, talk radio, and listening to music with
lyrics. Instead, try some Mozart.
Finding your style while 
expanding your horizons
You’ll probably go through many stages in your art career. The first stage
may just be to get something recognizable down in a painting. Can the view-
ing public decipher what animal your wildlife painting depicts? Later, when
it’s obvious that what you’ve drawn is, say, a hippopotamus, you may
become very interested in the way the light and shadow fall on the animal,
and then in getting just the right color combination, and then in being able to
sum up the hippo in the fewest possible lines, and so on. You can derive an
endless amount of inspiration from your artistic progression. 
How do you make this progression? Be curious. Experiment. You must be
interested in the world. Collect images of subjects that are intriguing to you.
Find out as much as you can about them and then explore them in your art-
work. Perhaps you’re interested in fantasy or science fiction. Or flea markets.
Or train travel. Or basketball, fishing, musical instruments, beekeeping, or
upholstery. Art is there for you, too, if you look for it. I’ve expanded my inter-
ests lately to racing cars and birdwatching. That’s pretty diverse, but I find that
both interest areas provide plenty of painting topics. For example, Figure 1-2 is
a car painting; for added interest, I’ve painted a close-up for a slightly unex-
pected view. You can make any interest of yours come to life through art. You
can own any vehicle, building, landscape, or zoo animal. You can make the
world as you want it to be. What power!

Genre is a term used in painting to refer to different kinds of paintings. Here
are some of the most popular genres:
 Landscape: Landscapes (which portray earth elements such as trees,
skies, grass, and mountains) may be the most popular genre. Figure 1-3
shows a typical landscape painting, and Chapter 10 lets you try your
own hand at landscape.
 Still life: Still lifes are composed of arranged elements such as pots,
fabric, fruit, flowers, and knick-knacks, usually positioned on a table. You
can paint still lifes in Chapters 6 and 11.
 Portrait: Portraits re-create faces and identifiable images. A portrait of a
house is a real, specific house.
 Wildlife: Wildlife paintings portray domestic and wild animals, birds,
and fish. Chapter 4 gives you a wildlife project.
 Abstract: Abstract is another name for nonrepresentational art. Chapter 12
is all about abstract art.

Part I: Getting Acquainted with Acrylics 
What’s my style?!
Style is a word that gets tossed around a lot.
Some styles are loose, like many of the
Impressionists. Some styles are tight, like the
Super Realists. Don’t worry about developing a
style right away. It’s important to try as wide a
variety of techniques as possible to begin with so
you can tell what you like and what you don’t. Your
style will follow — you don’t want to force it. With
patience, your style will evolve, and one day you’ll
notice that your paintings look similar — because
they all have your style.

 Collage: A collage attaches papers, paints, photographs, and other simi-
lar items in layers to create unique effects. Chapter 13 discusses and
walks you through collage projects.
 Mixed media: A mixed media work blends different paints and drawing
materials together in one work.
I talk about all of these acrylic painting genres in this book (especially in
Chapter 15), and you can find step-by-step projects for most of them. The pro-
jects here are just to give you a taste — an idea for you to take and run with
using your own imagination. When you try your hand at the projects in this
book, think about how you can apply those techniques to what interests you.
You may try all the projects in this book and find that you excel at one of them
more than the others. That may become your specialty. Many artists focus on
just one particular genre, developing a style and reputation for painting just
that kind of thing. Such specialization is often good strategy; in fact, most
gallery owners prefer artists who are recognizable for a specialty. Say you dig
aliens in purple spaceships. If that’s all you paint, you’ll become so good at
that niche that when people see an alien in a purple spaceship at a gallery,
they’ll recognize it as yours.

Project: Painting Your Sketchbook
The rest of this fine book contains lots of details about everything having to
do with acrylics, but I know you’re anxious to get started. So why not jump
right in and try out some paint? For now, just get some acrylic paint, a can of
water, a paintbrush, and a sketchbook with a stiff cover. I like sketchbooks
with heavy, unfinished cardboard covers. The size is your choice; I found a 6-
inch square book that I liked. I also usually choose a sketchbook with a spiral
binding because it lies flat when opened.
Earlier in this chapter, I suggest that you collect ideas and put them in a sketch-
book. When you’re done with this project, you’ll want to sketch in your new
acrylic-embellished sketchbook. By painting a plain, inexpensive spiral sketch-
book, you’ll want to pick it up, show it off, and — most importantly — fill it up.
Choose a few acrylic colors you like — three should be plenty. I used three
colors in this example: Iridescent Bright Gold, Quinacridone Nickel Azo Gold,
and Iridescent Copper (fluid acrylics by Golden) — plus a Titanium White
from a tube. I used a 1-inch flat brush; if you feel like making some lines or
details, you may want a #8 round brush. (Chapter 2 gives you the skinny on
brushes). Fill your water container (a recycled tin can is fine) and have some
paper towels handy for spills.
If you want to embellish your cover further, you need a few other items:
acrylic gloss medium (Chapter 3 describes mediums in detail) and some
pretty scrap papers, such as tissue or decorative papers. Sometimes you can
even recycle the interior of envelopes. Did you ever notice the nifty patterns
inside junk mail envelopes? If you’re on a budget, these scraps work fine.
You can’t do this project wrong. No pressure. You’re not even painting from a
palette. All you want to do is get a feeling for the paint and get started enjoy-
ing the possibilities. Just follow these steps to your own inspirational painted
sketchbook:
1. Prepare your painting area by covering your painting area in newspa-
per and corralling your supplies.
Place your sketchbook on the newspaper. I also put another sheet of
newspaper between the sketchbook cover and the sketchbook pages to
protect the pages from paint.
2. Squeeze a dollop of white paint directly on the cover and spread it to
create an even coat.
3. If you’re using multiple colors, squirt them onto the cover while the
white paint is still wet and pull the brush through it to create a mar-
bled look.
I pulled the brush through the paint only a couple of times because I
wanted the variety of colors to remain unblended, but you can play with
the paint as much as you like. Use the brush to make textures, marks,
and lines. I completely covered the surface with the brush strokes all
going the same direction, and then made a scalloped line by pulling the
brush through the smooth paint.
When you like the result or the paint begins to dry, stop. Figure 1-4a shows
the plain sketchbook and Figure 1-4b includes an added coat of paint.
14
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Acrylics 

4. Let the cover dry completely, keeping your brush in the water while
you’re not using it.
You may speed up the process with a blow dryer or let it dry naturally
for an hour or so.
5. Stop there if you want, or embellish by going on to Steps 6 through 9.
6. Embellish by painting a Chinese character (or whatever you feel like).
Use a round brush to make marks that resemble a Chinese character.
Push down to make a wide stroke or pull the brush to make a line, lifting
the brush as you pull to reduce the width of the line.
Practice your characters on another sheet of paper until you’re confi-
dent enough to do them for real on the cover. If you don’t like your first
cover attempt, wipe it off with a damp paper towel and try again. You
can also make the character less prominent by covering it with paper
(Step 7) in part or entirely.
Rub-on letters are available at the craft store. Figure 1-5 shows rub-ons
by American Traditional Design. You can rub these onto a surface and
paint over the top of them to get an accurate character.
7. To embellish with papers, paint acrylic medium over the area you
want to paper, add the paper, and then paint another layer of medium.
Gather some paper scraps. I tore some Japanese rice papers into strips
and rectangles. Try using paper with images or graphics; I added a
reproduction of Mona Lisa as a final indication of what will go inside the
book. You can also sprinkle glitter at this time. I put big metallic pieces
on called Gildenglitz by USArtQuest.
8. Let everything dry.
9. Repeat Step 3 to paint the inside cover.
The cardboard cover may bow a little from the moisture. By painting the
inside, the fibers of the cardboard bend back and lie flatter.

What a way to go around the world with art: Italian paintings, Chinese words,
and Japanese paper with an American assemblage. (And if you liked this pro-
ject, you definitely want to check out Chapter 13 on collage.)
Don’t forget to clean your brushes with soap and water when you’re done.
You don’t want to have to throw your brushes away after your first project!

Setting Up Supplies: Brushes,
Surfaces, and Palettes
In This Chapter
 Distinguishing between brush shapes and the marks they make
 Checking out popular and alternative painting surfaces
 Gathering up some other goodies to get started
C
hapter 3 covers the wide world of acrylic paint, but paint’s not all you
need to get started painting. I’m talking about brushes, painting sur-
faces, a palette to put the paint on, and a few other items that make you look
and feel like an artist. Selecting the right painting paraphernalia is nearly as
bewildering as choosing your paint, so in this chapter, I talk about what you
will need in the way of brushes, surfaces, palettes, and other supplies so you
can make good decisions and ask informed questions when you’re at the art
store. You may even be lucky enough to have some supplies around the
house. Gather them up and start there. If you read about something that you
think you want to add to your collection, reward yourself.
Brushing Up on Brushes
Finger painting may have been your first painting method, but it’s too messy
for acrylic paint; therefore, brushes naturally come in handy when applying
your paint to surfaces. Brushes keep your hands out of the paint by using a
handle attached to hairs by a metal tube-like covering called a ferrule. You
dip a brush into the paint to cover about half the hair.
Take care to avoid dipping into paint as high as the ferrule — it’s harder to
clean. And cleaning is the name of the game when it comes to brushes; after
paint dries in the hairs, especially around the ferrule, it ruins the shape of the
brush. Finally, be sure to thoroughly dry your cleaned brushes; drops of water
clinging to the ferrule can drip onto your painting when you least expect it.
In this section, I discuss the various aspects of a paintbrush, different types
of brushes available, and even a few other alternative means of getting paint
onto your surface.

Get a handle on it
Brush handles come in two sizes: long and short. You can use either length of
handle when painting with acrylics; it’s merely a matter of preference. A long
handle is a good choice for painters who like to hold the back end of the
brush, fully extending their arm and painting from a standing position. A long
handle also makes it easier to step back and view the painting from more of a
distance. A short handle is easier to paint with while sitting down at a paint-
ing lying flat on a table.
You can get two kinds of paintbrush handles: wood or plastic. Wood is the
more common material; you can get brushes that have plastic handles, but
they’re usually lower quality. Wood handles are nice but can disintegrate if
you leave them in water. I have favorite brushes in each category. Some han-
dles have a chiseled end opposite the hairs that’s good for scraping and draw-
ing in the paint (called scraffito). You can scrape with any other tool as well,
but having a chisel-ended brush is just so easy when your brush flips over to
have a chisel end that does the job. Figure 2-1 shows a range of brush handles.
Hair today, gone tomorrow
The non-handle end of the brush — the business end — is obviously the
hairs. You may notice two distinct kinds of hairs on brushes: soft and stiff.
Stiff bristles are best for manipulating thick paint. They often leave brush
stroke marks; think of Vincent Van Gogh’s style — those marks were left by
stiff brushes. Soft hairs are better for detail and blending because they don’t
leave such visible stroke marks. Figure 2-2 shows both stiff-bristled and soft-
bristled brushes. The stiff brushes have the light-colored hairs.
Both soft and stiff brushes come in natural and synthetic varieties:
 Natural hairs: Natural brush bristles come from animals — the stiff bris-
tle brushes are made from the bristly hairs of a boar. That’s right; you’re
painting your masterpieces with the coat of a wild pig. The hairs on soft
brushes typically come from the sable, a mink-like creature that lives
mainly in Russia. Natural brushes can be very expensive but are of
exceptional quality.

 Synthetic hairs: Manufacturers have figured out some pretty nifty syn-
thetic knock-offs. The reward for artists is that the price is right and the
quality is not compromised. It’s a win-win for everyone: You get to keep
more of your hard-earned money, and the animals get to keep their hair.
Acrylic paint is pretty hard on brushes. Even if you keep them clean, acrylic
has a way of stubbornly attaching to hairs and handles. For this reason I rec-
ommend using synthetic brushes rather than the very expensive natural hair
brushes. The final painting won’t show what price your brushes were.
Get in shape (shaped brushes, that is)
You’ll also notice a vast variety of shaped brushes. Every time an artist needs
a specific kind of stroke, some manufacturer creates a brush specifically for
that stroke — in hopes, naturally, of selling more brushes. Some shaped
brushes are quite useful, but more are gimmicky. You do need some basics:
For example, flats (which have hairs squashed along a row) and rounds
(which have a full, round arrangement of hairs on the tip) are essential. You
may find other shapes that you really like and that save you time while paint-
ing. I, for one, must have a liner brush. This brush has longer hairs than a
normal brush. Not surprisingly, a liner brush makes long, thin lines good for
such things as tree branches, grass, and slats in fences.
Figure 2-3 shows several shaped brushes, along with the kinds of paint marks
they make.
Size matters
To paint effectively, you need various sizes of brushes. Although different
manufacturers and countries use different numbering systems, the width of
most flat brushes is measured in inches: 1⁄8-inch, 1⁄4-inch, 1⁄2-inch, 3⁄4-inch, and 
1-inch sizes. Big brushes are 2, 3, 4, and even more inches wide. Figure 2-4
shows a few flat brushes.
Figure 2-2:

soft-bristled

Chapter 2: Setting Up Supplies: Brushes, Surfaces, and Palettes

You definitely need a couple of small flats in different sizes and maybe a big
one for large areas. The bigger you paint, the more you need bigger brushes.
Other brushes, such as the round ones, have sizes indicated by number. With
round brushes, the smaller the number, the smaller the brush. When they get
down to 0 (zero), they get smaller by adding more zeros: 00, 000, and so on.
Some miniature brushes go down in size to a single hair.
Although you can compare the numbers, I’ve noticed that brush size varies
even among shipments of the same brand and size; use your eyes to decide
what you want. In choosing a good round brush, look for one that has a nice
pointed tip. I often use anywhere from a number 10 to 14; this size may sound
big, but the tip tapers to a tiny point. That brush paints fine detail using the
tip but paints a large area quickly when pressed harder — a very versatile
brush. Figure 2-5 shows some round brushes.

Part I: Getting Acquainted with Acrylics 

When a project recommends a specific brush size — not just in this book but
anywhere else — you can probably fudge a little and use something you
already have that’s similar. Please don’t automatically rush out to buy a new
brush unless you determine that you really need it. If a workshop or class
issues a supply list, ask whether you must have the exact supplies. Many stu-
dents buy more than they need in hopes that all those brushes will produce
better paintings. Practice is the way to make better paintings. Wear out the
brushes you have and then buy new brushes.
Brush substitutes
Brushes aren’t the only way to apply paint. A couple of alternatives:
 A palette knife is a miniature trowel you use to apply paint. Scrape into
the paint with the knife and slather the paint on the surface like spread-
ing butter on toast. Palette knives are especially handy for mixing
because they clean easily — just wipe them off with a paper towel —
and therefore waste less paint.
Knives come in all different shapes. I like ones with a pointy diamond on
the end; they make great lines and can get in little places to add detail.
You can get cheap plastic knives or fancy wood-handled knives. If you
use a palette knife a lot, you probably want one that’s nicer and can stand
some pressure. Figure 2-6 shows palette knives and the marks they make.
 Sponge applicators are good for painting large areas that need less detail.
Sponges come in different shapes; you can pounce on paint and stamp
the shape onto the surface, or use a roller to uniformly cover a back-
ground. (A 1- or 2-inch wide roller is also great for applying gesso, cov-
ered later in this chapter.)
Figure 2-7 shows several different painting sponges; the bottom sponge
is actually a make-up applicator, which crafters (decorative painters who
paint surfaces like wood, metal, and walls) often use to apply paint. Grab
the top of the triangle and load different colors on the bottom of the
sponge. (Head to Chapters 5 and 13 for sponge painting activities.)

Beginning your brush collection 
with the bare essentials
If you’re really on a budget, you can get by with one brush — a pointed round
#10 can paint a lot of territory. Ideally, you want to start out with a couple of
sizes in each shape of brush. Two sizes give you one brush for small areas
and one for quicker coverage of big shapes. I give you some good sizes, but
different brands vary, so just be sure you get some variation in sizes. Here’s a
shopping list of my workhorse favorites:

 Rounds with a fine point: #2, #8, #14

After you build up your essential collection, you can treat yourself with some
specialty brushes that interest you.
Maintaining Your Brushes
If you treat your brushes with care, they can last for years. I still have the
first nice brush that I bought in college some 10, er, 30 years ago. But you
have to really take care of them. In this section I dispense tips for getting the
longest wear from your brush investment. 
Prepping a new brush
Sometimes new brushes are shipped with a stiffener applied to them to pro-
tect the hairs until you use them. The stiffener is water soluble, so after you
buy the brush and are ready to use it, just dip the hairs in clear water and roll
them along on a water-safe surface to work the stiffener out of the hairs.
Always respect the shape of the brush and work to maintain it so that the tip
remains pointed or the flat doesn’t start fluffing up out of alignment. Never
scrub or grind to the extent that the hairs get all out of shape unless you’re
ready to buy a new brush.
At first some hairs may fall out; don’t worry — that’s normal. The shedding
should stop with prolonged use, though some really cheap brushes may con-
tinue to shed. If a hair comes off and gets into the paint, the easiest thing to
do is let it dry and then pull it off. You may be tempted to chase the hair
around, but remember that the paint goes with it and makes a mess.
After the hairs are wet, lay the brush horizontally to dry. Storing the brush
vertically allows water to drip down the ferrule onto the handle, loosening
the glue and the handle’s finish. After the brush has air dried, you can store it
in a number of methods (see “Storing” later in this chapter).
Avoiding damage
Brushes are interesting. When you look at them you may be tempted to touch
the hairs. Don’t. Remember the old adage “oil and water don’t mix”: Your hands
are oily — even if they don’t particularly feel that way to you — and acrylic
paint is water-soluble. Transferring hand oil to your brushes changes the way
they handle paint. Similarly, try not to use the same brushes for different paint
media. I keep my acrylic brushes separate from my oil or watercolor brushes.
23
Chapter 2: Setting Up Supplies: Brushes, Surfaces, and Palettes

A new brush usually comes with some kind of cover or protector on it; some
have a clear plastic tube pushed down onto the ferrule and covering the hair.
After you buy a brush, throw away the tube. You may be tempted to put it
back over the hairs for protection, but doing so often bends a hair or two and
damages the brush forever. If this happens, you can try trimming the stray
hairs to tame them.
Washing
After using your brushes you should wash, dry, and store them. During painting,
be very careful not to let the paint dry on the brush. After acrylic paint dries, it’s
a permanent plastic capsule for the hairs of your brush — in other words, time
for a new brush. Get in the habit of wiping excess paint off onto a paper towel,
rinsing the brush in your water container — which you keep beside your
palette — and then laying the brush on the table to use again or dry.
At the end of your painting session, take the brushes you used and wash
them in running water. Special brush soaps and cleaners are available, but
plain old soap (liquid or bar) and water is sufficient to do the job. Roll the
brush hairs in the palm of your hand with some liquid soap till the water
rinses clear. Respect the shape of the hairs so as to not damage the tip or
shape by grinding and smooshing unnecessarily. Or keep a bar of soap for
your brushes and paint the bar until the brushes are clean. Make sure to get
the paint out of the heel (the hairs right next to the ferrule), where it’s most
obstinate. Lay brushes flat on a paper or cloth towel to dry.
Storing
Brushes are most vulnerable to damage when they’re wet. If brushes dry
mushed, they stay that way, so if you travel with art supplies (as you may
when going to and from a class), you need to protect your wet brushes from
getting smashed. Pointed brushes especially need protection if you want to
keep that fine pointed tip — after all, that’s the reason you bought that brush.
If you like the protection idea, go to a florist and get one of those plastic,
rubber-capped test tubes that holds water for a single flower stem; these
covers really protect a brush when traveling. Insert the blunt (nonbristle)
end of your brush through the inside of the cap so the clear tube fits over the
hairs and attaches to the cap near the ferrule. I like this method for my #10
round or a skinny liner brush, but really big handles don’t fit, of course.
Figure 2-8 shows a brush with its disposable shipping cover (top) and one
protected by a floral tube cover (bottom).
Getting a brush case is another way to protect several brushes. Cases are usu-
ally zippered so brushes don’t fall out. You can also find unzippered brush
holders that have pockets to insert brushes and keep the hairs straight so
they don’t get damaged when wet. Some roll up like a bamboo mat and let air
circulate to dry hairs. Some fold open and display brushes for choosing.
Some are made of fabric, and others are plastic or wooden boxes.
24
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Acrylics 

If you don’t have to move the brushes and they can stay in your studio (or on
your kitchen table, depending on how fancy your setup is), you can store
them — when thoroughly dry — upright in a can or similar container. I put
sand in the bottom so the brush stands up straight; this way, you can spread
the brushes out and see all the shapes in order to choose one quickly.
Figure 2-9 shows many of the brush storage containers you can find at art
supply shops.
Repairing a worn brush
Try as you may to keep it clean, you still may have a brush go bad. If paint
dried in the hairs, you can try soaking them in denatured alcohol and work-
ing the paint out with your fingers.
If a brush loses its shape — for example, the point on your round brush doesn’t
point — dip it in gum arabic (available in the watercolor section of art stores).
Gum arabic is actually the stiffener used to ship the brushes (and the binder —
the goo-glue that holds pigment together to make paint — in watercolor); it’s

Chapter 2: Setting Up Supplies: Brushes, Surfaces, and Palettes

a sticky liquid that dries in the brush’s hairs and eventually becomes hard.
Before it gets hard, sculpt the hairs back into the shape you want (as shown in
Figure 2-10). Let them dry hard and leave them indefinitely to train the brush
back into shape. After a month or so, remove the gum arabic as you would with
a new brush and see whether it has retained the shape. If not, try again.
If you can’t save your brush, you can take scissors and snip it into a really
sparse brush perfect for painting wonderful grasses and hairs on animals.
Knowing when it’s time for a new brush
You know you need to replace your brush when
 The round point on your brush can’t make fine line details. Demote it to
a scrub brush and buy a new one with a sharp tip.
 You forget the brush in the water overnight and the bristles have a per-
manent L shape.
 The brush continues to shed hairs and drive you nuts.
Toss these over-the-hill brushes in a drawer for a recycle project and splurge
to get one that does not frustrate you.

Picking and Prepping Common 
Paint Surfaces
A fancy name for what you paint on is substrate. For most painting needs, you
want a flat, fine-art surface to paint on — typically paper or canvas. Because
acrylic paint uses water, a regular old plain paper substrate buckles when
wet. So you need something a bit more rugged to endure all the dampness,
not to mention scrubbing.
Acrylic paint sticks to most surfaces, but for those that resist it (such as
glass and ceramic), you can get special additives (described in Chapter 3)
that make acrylic adhere to glass and ceramic, and even candles and fabric.
Some cool projects in Chapter 14 use some of these surfaces.
Most surfaces, however, are absorbent. Think of painting on tissue — the
paint would spread uncontrollably into the fibers. In order to make a surface
(except for preprimed canvas and canvas paper) ready to accept paint, you
have to prime it. In the following sections, I discuss various conventional sub-
strates and give you instructions on priming unprimed painting surfaces.
Canvas paper
Canvas paper comes in a variety of pad sizes, from small (21⁄2 x 31⁄2 inches) to
large (16 x 20 inches). It has a specially coated surface, with a linen weave
texture that accepts either oil or acrylic paint. Canvas paper is fairly inexpen-
sive and easily framed, so I recommend buying a pad and using it for the pro-
jects for this book. (If you want to use something else, go right ahead. Make it
your project. Just make sure it’s a sturdy, water-resistant surface.) You can
use canvas paper without any further preparation. Cut it to the size you want
with scissors or a paper cutter. Figure 2-11 shows some pads of canvas paper.
Canvas
Canvas, made from linen (finer texture and more expensive) or cotton (more
texture and less expensive), has been used for centuries in oil paintings, and
it also works well for acrylic paint. You typically stretch canvas tautly onto
stretcher bars (strips of wood arranged in a frame) and staple it into place
before you paint on it, but you can also just back it with a board, creating a
rigid panel to paint on. Some artists like the bounce of stretched canvas, and
some prefer a rigid surface. Canvas is normally rectangular or square but can
be round or oval shaped; it comes raw (unprimed) or preprimed in a variety
of finishes, from very smooth portrait canvas to rough textures.
The good news is that prestretched and -primed canvas is available in sizes
from 2 x 3 inches to 30 x 40 inches. For the more ambitious, you can buy
canvas in rolls about 52 to 72 inches wide x 6 to 100 yards long and stretch it
yourself onto frames.
27
Chapter 2: Setting Up Supplies: Brushes, Surfaces, and Palettes

I buy prestretched and preprimed canvases — I’d rather be painting than
preparing. Some artists enjoy making their own canvases (and even paint),
but I think the manufacturers do a great job more efficiently than I do.
Boards
Though canvas is good for folks who like a little give to their painting surface,
use board if you want a firmer, more rigid surface. Boards can be mat boards,
thicker illustration boards, foam boards, or gator boards. They do need to be
prepared, which you can do by following the instructions in “Preparing
boards and canvases” later in this chapter.
Acid-free mat boards
Mat board is a four-ply paper-type board used in framing and presenting art; it
comes in a gazillion color choices, though only one side has color — the
other side is usually white. You may be familiar with mat board because of its
popularity in framing artwork, but it’s great to paint on as well — it has a nice
rigid surface that doesn’t buckle when you add water or paint. You can paint
acrylic paint directly on mat board, prime it and then paint, or coat it with
painting grounds or pastes (covered in Chapter 12) to make different textures
before painting.
Figure 2-11:
Various
canvas

28
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Acrylics 

Your art or frame store can sell you big sheets (30 inches x 40 inches or 40
inches x 60 inches) of mat board; frame stores also may give you a deal on all
the little pieces they accumulate. Mat boards have a variety of surface tex-
tures: linen, smooth, and embossed patterns. Some mat boards are the same
color throughout, and some are color cored so the back is another color.
When the board is cut at a 45-degree angle, the core color shows. Check out a
picture of mat board in Figure 2-12.
You can get two types of mat boards: paper mat (regular mats treated to be
acid neutral) and acid-free (100 percent cotton rag content). Older paper mat
board often has an acid content in the core that can leach acid to anything it
touches, leaving a yellowed surface. Modern paper mats, on the other hand,
are buffered neutral by the addition of calcium carbonate, so they don’t harm
artwork. Acid-free is always a better conservation choice, but costs a little
more. You may hear the term rag content, which refers to a product’s acid-free
cotton material; most quality acid-free products have 100 percent cotton rag
content. I use only acid-free products and leave the paper mats to posters or
temporary signage.
Don’t be tempted to use newsprint, masking tape, or cardboard in your art-
work, because they turn yellow and brittle with time and exposure. Have you
ever left your newspaper in the driveway for a few days only to have it turn
yellow and brittle? That’s because newsprint is very acidic; so are masking
tape and cardboard. Rather than risk ruining your masterpiece, use acid-free
alternatives in tape, paper, and boards.
Illustration boards
Illustration boards are similar to mat boards but only come in white. They
measure 30 x 40 inch or smaller and can be different thicknesses: Single 
thick is .05 inch thick, and double thick measures .085 or .095 inch thick.
Illustration boards don’t require priming and are available in fine art or draft-
ing supply stores; they come in several different surface finishes:

Chapter 2: Setting Up Supplies: Brushes, Surfaces, and Palettes

 Hot press has a smooth surface and is good for detailed paintings such
as portraits.
 Cold press is slightly textured (similar to watercolor paper) and works
well for landscapes.
 Pebble finish has a regular, bumpy surface; use it whenever you want an
interesting textured surface.
Foam boards
Foam boards have white or black paper on the front and back and a foam
core 1⁄8, 3⁄16, or 1⁄4 inch thick. The foam in the center makes them very rigid and
lightweight. Watch out — they dent easily.
Gator boards
Gator boards are stronger and more rigid than foam boards and less prone to
damage. They’re also more expensive. They come in 1⁄4-inch and 1⁄2-inch sizes
and are much lighter weight than boards made from wood. (Check out
“Working with wood surfaces” later in the chapter for information on painting
on wooden boards.)
Figure 2-12 shows several kinds of paint surfaces available.
Preparing boards and canvases
Primed painting surfaces come prepared for you, but raw surfaces need a sur-
face preparation (though experimental artists even skip the priming and work
with the very absorbent surface, thus staining it. Anything that works goes.)
The most common primer, or ground, is gesso. Gesso (pronounced jess-oh) is
a combination of acrylic polymer emulsion, calcium carbonate, and Titanium
White (as the coloring agent). It’s a liquid ground for preparing a surface to
accept paint or gilding (applying gold-leaf, as in gold-leaf frames, for example).
Gesso is an Italian term meaning “gypsum;” however acrylic gesso has little
relation to gypsum but the name.
Gesso is available in smaller jars or gallon cans. To prepare a surface with
gesso, follow these steps:
1. Use a large flat brush or a sponge roller to apply it to your surface.
For smoother surfaces that have little or no texture, you may want to
add a little water to the gesso.
2. Let the gesso layer dry and sand it smooth with fine sandpaper.
3. Repeat Steps 1 and 2.
If you accidentally sand through the layers, add another layer of gesso
and repeat Step 2.
You can make textured surfaces by using thick gesso (meaning less or no
water) and not sanding — leaving the brush stroke patterns visible. You
can apply really thick grounds with a spatula or plastic spreader. The
pattern you make stays when dried. (Check out Chapter 12 for more on
creating textured surfaces).
30
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Acrylics 

Gesso comes white, clear, or black. If you like the look of painting on velvet,
black gesso is for you. You can also change the color of your gesso by adding
acrylic paint.
If this process is all too much labor and mess for you, you can buy preprimed
surfaces, but many artists like to prepare their own surfaces to save money,
control the surface texture, or just create something unique. With the bar-
gains on supplies offered today, I’m not even sure saving money is a reason to
prime for yourself anymore.
Thinking Outside the Canvas: Alternate
Acrylic Painting Surfaces
Acrylic is great for many surfaces beyond the typical fine art applications
described in the previous section. Because acrylic doesn’t have to “breathe”
like oil paint (which takes a long time to dry), there is less reason to use
canvas with acrylic than with oil. Acrylic works to paint fabric, wood, metal,
terra cotta, glass (with some prep), and more. Solid surfaces are less flexible
than canvas, therefore preventing the cracking of paint.
Painting on fabrics
Canvas is usually the fabric of choice to paint a flat painting on, but think like
a designer and you can paint on any fabric to wear as a garment or use as a
decorative item (like a pillow cover). Fluid paints work best for fabric paint-
ing because they’re more liquid and penetrate the fibers more readily.
For items that you plan to wash, you want to add some fabric medium (an
additive to help paint penetrate the fibers). Acrylics work on fabric without
the fabric medium, but it really helps keep colors from fading and cloth from
getting stiff after you wash it. Check the label of your fabric medium for
mixing guidelines.
After the fabric painting has completely dried, heat set the paints with an
iron or in a hot dryer (see the fabric medium bottle label for exact direc-
tions). Then you can launder the fabrics without color fading. Compare this
process to projects with fabric dyes, which you need to steam to set the dye.
If you’re ready to start painting fabric, you can find a fabric project in Chapter 14.
Working with wood surfaces
Hardwoods such as oak, ash, and maple are better than soft woods (pine), which
dent and tend to ooze out more resin. Woods in general contain acids, lignin, and
resins that can escape into your paint and change the colors; some wood panels,
like particle boards and masonite, are constructed with glues that can also leach
out and discolor your work. This situation is known as support induced discol-
oration or SID; to prevent SID, be sure to seal your wood panel before applying
any gesso. One product that seals wood panels is Golden’s GAC 100, a thin, clear
31
Chapter 2: Setting Up Supplies: Brushes, Surfaces, and Palettes

polymer; simply paint the sealant on, allow to dry, and then paint the panel
with gesso. How many coats of gesso you use is up to you; gesso covers up the
texture of the wood, so the more coats you use, the smoother the surface is.
But one to three coats is usually sufficient to create a nice painting surface.
Taking a shine to metal
Water cans, metal trays, and buckets are a few metal objects you can decorate
with paint. If the metal doesn’t accept the paint, paint a layer of water-soluble
varnish or clear gesso on the metal surface before painting with acrylic paint.
A light sanding also may give the unprimed metal enough tooth for paint to
adhere.
Scratching the surface of glass
Glass is one of the nonporous surfaces that acrylic can’t stick to without
help. But with a couple of tricks, glass can become acrylic’s substrate too.
One method is to buy acrylic paints made specifically for glass. In the craft
section of your supply store, look for acrylic enamels for painting on glass,
tile, and ceramic. Follow the label instructions for whatever product you buy,
but generally speaking, you paint the surface, let it dry for 7 to 21 days, and
bake for one hour at 350 degrees Fahrenheit in your home oven. One brand
suggests top coating (crafter talk for varnish, explained more in Chapter 4)
with clear glass or satin glaze. If you’re using Plaid FolkArt Enamels, the
painting should be dishwasher safe on the top rack.
If you don’t want to buy a bunch of special paints, here are a couple of tricks
to use your regular acrylics on glass that can hang in a window (just don’t eat
off it):
 Paint the glass with water-based varnish first to provide some tooth
for the paint to hold on.
 Use a glass etching cream. Etching makes the glass look frosted and
gives it enough tooth to hold on to the acrylic paint. Paint the area you
want to cover with glass etching cream, let it sit for the time recom-
mended on the label, rinse, and then paint the etched area. You can buy
the cream at your art or craft supply store.
Plastic
You can improve cheap plastic items with a painted facelift. For big areas and
backgrounds, you can get an aerosol spray formulated just for adhering to
plastic.
Both acrylic paint and plastic are polymer based, so they should stick
together. If regular paint doesn’t stick, try first spraying the surface with
matte fixative (a protective spray for preventing smeared drawings). This
trick works well to give a slick surface enough tooth for the paint to grab.
32
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Acrylics 

Terra cotta
Paint some cute outdoor planters with flowers, insects, stripes, or whatever
you want. You can try using your regular acrylics if you first clean, dry, and
seal the item with gesso or primer. Then paint the terra cotta, dry, and seal
the item with a water-based varnish. You can also get yet another special line
of paints in the craft store for outdoor items like cement and terra cotta,
called Patio Paint.
Walls
Most walls are painted with acrylic latex paint, but you can paint them with
acrylic too. Make sure the wall is clean so that it accepts acrylic paints. Wash
walls with soap and water to remove dirt and grease — even fingerprints
leave grease spots. You can see examples of murals I’ve painted in acrylic,
plus get more guidance on painting your own, in Chapter 12.
Purchasing Palettes and 
Other Handy Stuff
Like any pastime, acrylic painting has its share of miscellaneous basic acces-
sories (like palettes and water containers). And like any pastime, acrylic
painting offers souped-up versions of these supplements to help you take
your hobby up a notch. The following sections detail some of the equipment
you need and its cool variations, plus a few other supplies to help keep
everything clean and tidy.
Palettes
A palette is a mixing area to prepare your paints. It can be as simple as a
paper plate; when the plate gets too gunked up with paint, let it dry and then
toss it and replace it with a new one. If you’re looking for something sturdier,
you can purchase several types of palettes. Some palettes — the classic ones
from film and TV depictions of artists at work — have a hole in them so you
can grip the palette in your nondominant hand. These palettes come in a vari-
ety of shapes and sizes, mostly ovals and rectangles. Other palettes have no
hole and sit on a table beside your painting area. Most palettes are white in
order to judge color accuracy, but some are clear or wood colored. Some
palettes have little wells to contain puddles of paint.
Disposable palettes
These palettes come in pads and are similar to waxed paper. The slick sur-
face doesn’t let water permeate, so you don’t have to worry about paint soak-
ing in. Like the paper plate, simply tear off the top sheet when it’s gunked up
to reveal a fresh one.
33
Chapter 2: Setting Up Supplies: Brushes, Surfaces, and Palettes

Stay-wet palettes
The stay-wet palette is a box with a thin sponge on the bottom and an airtight
sealing lid. The sponge is covered with a special heavy, disposable, reusable
paper; dampen both the sponge and the paper and place acrylic paint on the
paper. The sponge keeps the paints wet while working, and the lid (if sealed)
keeps paint from drying for about a week. I use a large stay-wet palette (about
18 x 24 inches) for big projects and a half-size one (9 x 12 inches) for smaller
projects. Another, similar kind of palette has little plastic containers with lids
for larger mixes of paint. The containers are like fast-food condiment contain-
ers and are replaceable.
Nonporous palettes
Glass, high-density plastic, and acrylic plastic palettes are also available.
Because acrylic paint doesn’t stick to nonporous surfaces, you can just peel
dried paint off of these palettes. Not all plastic is high density, though —
check palette labels to make sure the palette is good for acrylics.
Most white plastic palettes in the art store are for watercolor, not acrylic.
Acrylic sticks to these materials and doesn’t clean off.
Other useful supplies
Paint is messy, and these items help you control that mess to some extent.
 Water container: You need clean water to rinse brushes, and you need
some sort of receptacle to hold that water. Any can (even an old coffee
or soup can) works — just be sure to thoroughly wash anything that pre-
viously held food before using. You can also use an everyday cup or
bowl (just don’t plan to eat from it again).
Many commercial water containers are available in art stores. They
come in various shapes and feature a multitude of accessories: brush
holders, cleaning ridges, foldability (for storage), inflatable walls (for
lightweight travel), and even a toilet-like flusher (for replenishing fresh,
clean water). Of course, these containers come in a variety of colors to
entice artists to choose their favorite.
 Spray bottle: Misting the paint on your palette periodically with clean
water from a spray bottle allows you to paint for hours — just keep those
paints on the palette hydrated! On a very hot, dry day you’ll need to spray
more often. Just remember, once the paint is on the palette, evaporation
begins and you must keep the paint moist to keep it workable.
 Paper towels or newspaper: Use some cheap paper towels or newspa-
per (after you’ve read it, of course) to wipe the excess paint off brushes
before you rinse them clean. This step helps you avoid running too
much paint down the drain and contaminating the groundwater. If you
feel wasteful using paper towels, you can substitute cloth rags. Make
sure the paper towels are dry before you dispose of them, so wet paint
doesn’t get into landfills. You can even save your paint-crusted paper
towels and use them for the collage projects in Chapter 13.
 Apron: Save your clothes by wearing a protective apron; acrylic paint
has a way of landing where you may not want it. You probably don’t
want to wear your best white cashmere sweater while you paint either.

All About Paints and Mediums
In This Chapter
 Choosing among the wide varieties of acrylic paints
 Changing paint properties with additives, mediums, gels, and thinners
W
hen you go into a well-stocked art supply store, the dazzling array of
choices in acrylic paints can make your head spin. You can find a
good choice for just about any application you can think of. On the other
hand, if you simply want a reliable paint that works on just about any surface,
that, too, is definitely available.
In this chapter, I run through some of the different properties and varieties of
acrylic paints and mediums (which you can add to the paint to make it do
what you want). The following sections give you information on what each
product is designed for and what to look for when choosing one for your par-
ticular purposes.
Getting to Know the Different 
Properties of Acrylic Paints
As you’re paint-shopping, you’ll probably notice an enormous price range
among acrylic paints. You can buy a whole set of inexpensive paints for the
same price as a single tube of another, higher-grade kind. You may also
wonder how in the world a gallon of house paint can cost the same as a tiny
tube of artist’s paint. Art paint costs more than house paint because it con-
tains far higher quality pigment, is ground finer, has no unnecessary filler in
it, and is formulated not to fade.
You’ll also notice, though, that prices and other factors differ even among art
paints. In this section, I walk you through various paint properties that can
affect paint prices. The primary reason is that art paint’s pricing corresponds
with the pigment content. Other pricing factors include brands, the amount
of refinement, rarity, and purity.
Pigments and binders
Pigment is a powdered coloring material held together by a binder; together,
pigment and binder make paint — you can’t paint with pigment alone. Pigment
can be animal, vegetable, or mineral in origin. For example, traditional earth

colors like brown and ochre (pronounced oh-ker) pigments are extracted from
rocks and minerals. I have even collected special rocks and ground them into a
powdered pigment. Newer pigments, developed within the last 50 to 60 years,
are synthetically reproduced in labs. These newer pigments, like Quinacridone
Red, are more transparent and brilliant than traditional pigments. You can 
purchase most pigments, both sythethetic and traditional, in art supply stores.
Binder is the liquid that (surprise!) binds the powdered pigment into a
paintable consistency. Oil paint uses oil as a binder, and watercolor uses a
sticky liquid called gum arabic. (Thought it would be water, huh?) Acrylic
paint uses polymer emulsions as binders. Polymer is a plastic, and emulsion is
a liquid slurrylike mix. Manufacturers sometimes use fillers like extra binder
to make more paint with less pigment. Higher quality paints have no filler.
Pigment is pricey stuff, so the more pigment in the paint, the more expensive
it is. You can find two main grades of paint:
 Student-grade paint is less expensive because it has less pigment,
coarser grinding, and more filler.
 Professional-grade paint is more expensive because it has more pig-
ment, finer grinding, and less filler.
When first starting to paint, you may be tempted to buy cheap materials
because you’re just practicing. If possible, however, you should buy the best
grade of materials that you can afford. Besides getting better results, you may
turn out a masterpiece after all (isn’t that the idea?), and it would be a shame to
have it fade. Check out “Different Types of Acrylic Paint” later in this chapter
for more on paint grades. Go ahead and start with student grade, but treat
yourself to a tube of professional grade when you need a reward. Then
replace your student-grade paints with higher quality when you can.
Viscosity
Viscosity is the thickness of a liquid. Water is very thin and therefore has low
viscosity. Acrylic paint is available in three viscosities:
 Fluid or soft body acrylics come in a bottle. They have a low viscosity
(typically ten times thinner than heavy body paint) and a creamy 
consistency. (Chapter 10 explores the watercolor-like performance of
fluid acrylic paints.)
 Heavy-bodied acrylics come in a jar or tube. These acrylics were origi-
nally formulated to have the same feel as oil paints. The paints in jars
have such a high viscosity that you need to scoop them out with a
palette knife (check out Chapter 2 for more on palette knives and other
tools). In fact, the paint is so thick that it can hold a peak and can be
used to paint in an impasto style. (No, that’s not an Italian dish. Impasto
is thick, three-dimensional paint.) Figure 3-1 shows an example of an
impasto painting done with heavy-bodied acrylic paint.

Part I: Getting Acquainted with Acrylics 

Finish
Acrylic paint has one of two finishes when it dries: glossy (shiny) or matte (dull).
In general, acrylic paint looks glossy when it dries. You may notice subtle dif-
ferences in transparency or opacity due to the type of pigment (mineral or
modern/lab-produced) used to make the color. Because some artists prefer
more of a matte look to their paint, some of the larger manufacturers now
offer matte lines of their colors. These acrylics have a matting agent added
(silica) to reduce the glossy finish of standard acrylics.
You can also alter the final look of a painting with a finish spray varnish or a
final coat of medium in a surface choice of matte, semi-gloss, or gloss. 
Drying time
Acrylic paint dries quickly. For that reason, be sure to replace screw tops on
the tubes and lids on paint jars after you’ve put your paint out on your
palette. You can control how fast paint dries in four ways:
 Thickness of paint: Thicker paint takes longer to dry.
 Humidity: Paint dries more slowly in humid conditions.
 Temperature: A hot environment dries paint more rapidly than a cool one.
 Air flow: Moving air evaporates paint more quickly. A blow-dryer really
speeds up drying time.

Chapter 3: All About Paints and Mediums

Sometimes the paint dries before you want it to, but you can use some tricks
to slow the drying time. Try applying the additives described in the next sec-
tion of this chapter. You can also mist the paint on your palette with water
from a spray bottle and mist the air to make it more humid. On a larger scale,
you can run a humidifier in the room where you’re painting.
Recently, a few of the more innovative paint companies have developed new,
slower drying acrylics. This new type of acrylic paint stays wet up to ten
times longer than traditional acrylics. If you want more time to blend paints,
you may consider using these longer-drying paints. Look for “slow-drying” or
“longer open time” on the label.
A dark color shift may occur when your paint dries — that is, the painted area
may look darker when it dries than it did when you applied it wet, especially
if you use dark colors. Why? The binder in paint is slightly milky when wet,
so paint is essentially tinted slightly white when wet. (A tint is any color with
white added. More on colors and tints in Chapter 7.) However, the milkiness
disappears as the paint dries, and thus the end result appears darker. If you
think this color shift will detract from your desired end product, you may
want to slightly lighten the colors you’re painting with a bit of white paint to
compensate.
Lightfastness or fading
All acrylic paints are rated for lightfastness, or how much they fade over time.
A paint that fades is known as fugitive — in other words, it’ll disappear on
you. Most tubes of paint feature a code rating the paint’s lightfastness from I
to IV. Paints rated I are the best — they don’t fade at all. Paints rated IV are
fugitive. If you want your paintings to be around for a while, choose acrylic
paint rated I or II.
Compatibility
Artists like to mix and match their paints (sometimes just because they’re
cleaning out their closets), but be forewarned that you can’t just throw all of
your paints onto a canvas and automatically expect a great result. All acrylic
paints and mediums are workable together. In addition, you can use some
other kinds of paints over dried acrylic paint. For example, you can use
acrylic underneath an oil painting. Many artists paint a quick-drying acrylic
under painting (a layer that blocks in colors without details) and then paint
slow-to-dry oil paint on top of it.
Don’t try to mix acrylic and oil paints (as you know, oil and water don’t mix).
And don’t apply acrylics over oils. Oil paints emit some gases that you don’t
want to trap underneath.
You can paint acrylic over watercolor, but you probably shouldn’t bother
painting watercolor over acrylic. However, you can draw pastels (pigment in
stick form — either as chalk or oil pastel) over thin acrylic under paintings.
Most stretched canvases are preprimed with acrylic gesso (pronounced jess-
oh), and they’re suitable surfaces for oil and acrylic paintings (more on sur-
faces to paint on in Chapter 2).
38
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Acrylics 

Stick to acrylic products all the way through and you’ll be safe for sure.
Sometimes you may leave a painting for a long time and want to paint on it
again years later. Go ahead! Dust it off first, because dust isn’t a good adhe-
sive surface. If you varnished it, check the label of your varnish; if the varnish
was workable, you can add more paint on top. Otherwise, you may need to
remove it. Head to Chapter 4 for more varnish details.
Hues
Manufacturers are always looking out for artists’ needs. Isn’t that nice of them?
Because certain pigments are so costly (cadmiums for instance) and other
pigments are toxic (such as lead-based paints — like a true Naples Yellow —
that have been found to be neural toxins), paintmakers have introduced
some synthetic choices called hues. (Note: Don’t confuse these hues with
those covered in Chapter 7 — this is a different use of the word). In this case,
a hue is a copy of a more expensive or dangerous pigment. The paint may be
called something like Cadmium Orange Hue or Naples Yellow Hue, and it
looks just like the color it’s replacing.
Different Types of Acrylic Paint
As I mention at the beginning of the chapter, acrylic paint comes in a wide
variety of types, consistencies, and qualities. The following sections break
down the more common kinds you’re likely to find in the art supply shop.
Artist-grade or professional acrylics
Artist acrylic is another name for professional-grade paints. Usually, artist-
quality paint contains more pigment and less filler than student grades and
is, of course, more expensive because of that. If you can afford it, this is the
kind of paint you want to buy.
Student grade acrylics
Student-grade paint is less expensive. It’s an okay place to start, but if you’re
serious about painting and want your paintings to last, use the best grade of
paint you can afford. You get what you pay for: lightfast, pigment-rich paint.
Acrylic gouaches
Gouache (pronounced gwash) is actually a matte watercolor, but you can 
get acrylic products with added matting agents that offer the same effect.
The difference between acrylic and watercolor is that acrylic paints dry 
39
Chapter 3: All About Paints and Mediums

permanently (versus watercolors, which you can reanimate with water).
Acrylic gouaches are popular choices when painting craft, decorative pro-
jects and folk art. For more of these types of projects check out Chapter 14.
Craft acrylics
Craft acrylics are the paints that come in little bottles with pop-up tops.
Though craft acrylics are usually inexpensive, Plaid brand says its gold-
topped Americana bottles are the same professional quality grade pigments
as professional quality tubes. I use craft acrylic paint for decorative painting
and murals (head to Chapter 14 for more on decorative painting). The paint
is a creamy consistency, so it paints a smooth surface (not transparent but
not three-dimensional). It can drip and run, so use caution when painting a
wall or vertical surface.
Specialty acrylic paints
Specialty acrylic paints allow you to create unique effects. These paints can
add a bit of fun to a fantasy painting, a shine to a butterfly wing, and some
POP to whatever else you can think of adding them to; they’re available in
both inexpensive craft bottles and professional grade. The following sections
give you the lowdown on various kinds of specialty paints.
Iridescents
Iridescent paints, shown in Figure 3-2, look like the colors of various metals,
typically gold, silver, copper, and aluminum. In addition, you may also find a
pearl iridescent paint. They can add sheen and shine to an otherwise flat sur-
face; they don’t fade, and they get even sparklier with gloss varnish as a final
coat (more on varnish in Chapter 4). Plus, you can mix iridescents with other
acrylics to add a little sheen and sparkle to nonmetallic colors.
Interference paints
An interference color is a color that shifts depending on how the light strikes
it. Interference is a phenomenon in nature where light waves are reflected and
refracted at the same time — in other words, interfered with! Think about the
rainbow effects you see in parking lot puddles. Or you may have noticed 
the paint jobs on those nifty cars that are one color when they drive toward
you and another color after they’ve passed. This effect is the interference
property at work.
Figure 3-2:
Iridescent

40
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Acrylics 

Interference paints look even more dramatic when painted on a dark surface —
they’re very transparent, meaning they’re affected by what is beneath.
They’re especially useful in painting fantasy scenes or nature scenes like but-
terflies and the heads of mallard ducks. Check out Figure 3-3 for some
swatches of interference colors; notice how the colors change when painted
over black and white.
Fluorescents and glow-in-the-dark paints
Remember the ’60s? (If you do, you weren’t there, right?) Even if you don’t,
you can make your own memories. Fluorescent colors are eye-poppingly
bright colors that glow under a black light (see Figure 3-4). You can also 
get glow-in-the-dark acrylic paints, but unfortunately (or fortunately, 
depending on your aesthetic values) they aren’t permanent and both do 
fade with time.
The fluorescent colors and glow-in-the-dark paint are great for Halloween
scenes, signage, and anywhere you want to grab some attention. You’re not
restricted to canvas, either; consider them for your Halloween costumes and
haunted houses as well.
Glitter paints
Need even more sparkle (who doesn’t)? You can find paint containing big and
little mica chunks in a number of colors. Figure 3-5 shows just how sparkly
the glitter paint can get.

Chapter 3: All About Paints and Mediums

Acrylic enamels
Acrylics stick to just about anything including metals, plexiglass, and wood,
but they don’t stick to glass or glaze-fired ceramics. Acrylic enamels, how-
ever, are made to adhere to glass and ceramics. You can use them to paint
your own set of stemware, for example. The glassware in Figure 3-6 was
painted with acrylic enamel.
Some of these paints require long drying times (up to 21 days) or that you bake
them in the oven to cure them. Read the paint labels for specific instructions.
Additives, Mediums, Gels, and Pastes
You can change the qualities of a paint by putting stuff in it. This stuff you
add is either an additive or a medium, gel medium, or paste.
Additives (like retarder and acrylic glazing liquid) allow the paint to move or
dry in a different way. Mediums (which are pourable), gel mediums (which 
are thicker), and pastes (which are really thick and usually contain texture
Figure 3-6:

with acrylic
enamel.
Figure 3-5:
Glitter paint.
42
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Acrylics 

additives) change the paint’s consistency to be either thinner or thicker and
are basically like colorless paint. In general, mediums are thin enough to be
pourable, and gel mediums and pastes aren’t. Though water isn’t technically
an additive or medium, you can use it to thin acrylic paint as well; however,
using mediums or gels gives better results (more on that later in this section).
The thicker the paint, medium, gel, or paste, the more time it takes to dry. Be
prepared to apply thick stuff and let it dry overnight before painting on top.
Acrylic medium
You use medium to change the viscosity (thickness) of the paint to make it
flow or run more easily. Medium makes paint more liquid and transparent so
that it requires fewer brush strokes to cover an area. Unlike water, medium
has the same molecular structure as paint, so it doesn’t weaken the paint as
it thins it (see the next section for more on thinning with water). When you
add clear medium or gel, the paint becomes easier to see through. Think of
medium as colorless paint. When first added to wet paint, medium looks a
little milky, but it turns clear when it dries.
Never confuse medium with paint thinner. Paint thinner is meant for oil-based
paint.
In this book, medium refers to the basic binder used in acrylic painting,
which is polymer (acrylic) medium. However, the word medium is a widely
used term and also indicates the choice of art material an artist uses — as in,
“What medium do you use?” “My medium is acrylics” (or oil, or charcoal —
whatever you use to create your works).
Medium comes in different viscosities. Generally, if an acrylic product is just
called a medium, that means it’s pourable, on the runny side. Medium typi-
cally comes in bottles or jars; gel and paste come in jars because they’re
thicker and need to be scooped out with a palette knife. Figure 3-7 shows
many different sizes of medium containers.
Water
Always have a little bucket of water nearby when you paint. Clean your
brushes in it by swirling them in the water and laying them flat to dry. You
can also add water to acrylics to thin the paint. Some art purists think that
distilled water is better than tap water to paint with, but where I live the
water straight out of the tap is great.
Water makes paint run — a lot. If you use a lot of water rather than medium,
paint with your painting lying flat on a table (instead of propped up on an
easel) to avoid unexpected drips (although you may like the drips — they
can be cool). But if you’re using just enough water to loosen the paint, easel
painting is no problem.
43
Chapter 3: All About Paints and Mediums

According to the manufacturers, you can thin acrylic paints with either water
or acrylic medium. Just remember that your final mixture shouldn’t include
more water than paint. Why? If you use more than 50 percent water in your
paint (and that’s a lot of water), you’re upsetting the molecular structure and
weakening the paint’s bond; paint that weak may not properly adhere to the
painting surface, and you may end up with blotchy or uneven color.
Acrylic medium is a better choice than water if you’re greatly altering the
consistency of the paint, like really thinning it for a wash-like effect. But for
most applications, water is the easiest product to use.
Flow enhancers
Having trouble blending? Add a little flow enhancer or blending medium. It
has a similar effect as water but also provides a slickness. Flow enhancer has
a lower viscosity than most mediums. See what the addition of flow enhancer
does for paint in Figure 3-8.

Part I: Getting Acquainted with Acrylics 

Retarders
Acrylic paint dries fast — sometimes too fast. If you need a bit more time to
blend your paint, check out the special products made to slow the drying
times: retarder and acrylic glazing liquid.
Be careful when using retarders. Don’t use more than 20 percent retarder to
80 percent paint, or the paint stays tacky for weeks, maybe longer!
You can use acrylic glazing liquid in any proportion, and it dries completely,
usually within hours. Drying times vary depending on the air temperature
and humidity where you’re painting. You can also use it as a glaze (discussed
in the next section).
Glaze
A glaze is a transparent layer of colored paint that you can use over an area
when you don’t want to lose the color underneath. Mix a glaze by adding
acrylic glazing liquid or medium to acrylic paint to make it more transparent.
For example, you can paint dark glaze over the ground in a painting to make a
shadow, and the ground color still shows through the glaze. You can even
buy premixed products called acrylic glazes. Premixed glazes may save you
time if you find the color you like. If premixed glazes don’t have the exact
color you want, you can make any color you need by mixing your own glaze.
(Head to Chapter 4 for more on glazing techniques.)
Gel mediums and paste
Gel medium, usually just referred to as gel, is thicker than acrylic medium
(not pourable) and may have things added to give texture, such as glass
beads or pumice.
You can use gel medium in three different ways:
 As a paint additive to change viscosity: For a very thick look, add extra
heavy gel to the paint to get a really thick texture. Add soft gel to loosen
up the paint for smoother brush strokes.
 As a money saver: You can extend paint by adding any clear gel or
medium to a quantity of paint to increase the amount of paint. Paint
(pigment) is more expensive than clear gel, so extending is a good way
to stretch your painting dollar.
 As a ground (primer) to paint over: Some gels have an interesting 
texture and provide good painting surfaces. For instance, fine pumice 
gel spread (or brushed) on a painting surface dries to a gritty surface
similar to sandpaper.
The following sections describe more about gel mediums as well as pastes.
45
Chapter 3: All About Paints and Mediums

Gels that add texture
Some gel mediums have actual grains and clumps of stuff in them. Sure, you
can make your own textures by adhering your own objects with plain
medium, but the commercial products are tested and won’t break down, dis-
integrate, or get old prematurely. A few of the textured mediums available
include fibers, sand, glass beads, flakes, and pumice. You can apply these
products as a ground and then paint over them, or add paint to make colored
mixtures. They can be very experimental or help add texture to a realistic
painting. (More on experimental painting in Chapter 12.)
Gels that add thickness
Some gels are formulated to be very thick and heavy, as well as clear, flexible,
and non-yellowing. When mixed with colored paint, a heavy gel medium
changes the viscosity to make the paint stand up and get noticed.
You can use these heavy gels to really enhance a painting. Instead of painting
a shadow, add a little thick gel and the paint casts an actual shadow. Refer to
the painting in Figure 3-1 for an example of thick paint used on the closest
flower petals. Because the flowers in the front are three-dimensional, they
catch light for a real highlight and cast a real shadow.
Pastes
The thickest goo yet, pastes are formulated with different additives for a vari-
ety of effects. In general, pastes are heavier than the gel mediums and aren’t
clear (because of their additives). Some examples are Fiber Paste, Molding
Paste, and Crackle Paste. You can sculpt Hard Molding Paste into shape, and
it dries to a very hard finish, at which point you can carve, sand, and paint it.
Like gel, you can either apply it first, let it dry, and paint on the surface or
mix paint color to it and apply it.
Gel and paste examples are shown in Figure 3-9.
Specialty mediums and finishes
You can also find special mediums that aid in making paint adhere to differ-
ent surfaces. In art supply shops and craft stores, you see mediums that
enable you to paint fabric, glass, candles, metal, stones and rocks, and even
soap. Put a drop or two of one of these mediums in acrylic paint, and the
paint sticks to things that normally are too slick or nonabsorbent to paint on.
Specialty mediums allow you to paint even waxy, glass, and washable items.
(More on these cool items in Chapter 14.)

non in the art world.
Setting Up Your Palette and Supplies
Because acrylics dry so quickly, you have to set up your palette anew each
time you paint. (Chapter 2 describes the different types of palettes available,
and Chapter 3 talks about the paints that go on them.)
Set up the palette in a position that lets you paint comfortably without risk to
your painting. In addition to your palette, you also need the following items:
 Container of water for cleaning your brushes and thinning your paint
 Cellulose sponge to blot excess liquid off your brush
 Spray bottle to keep your paints from drying out as you’re working
You don’t have to be fancy. The items can be as simple as a paper plate for a
palette, a clean tin can full of water, and a cellulose sponge. On the other
hand, upgraded versions are surely available at your art supply store.

Put these items together on the side of your dominant hand (Figure 4-1). That
way you don’t have to reach across the painting for any of them, meaning you
won’t drip anything on your painting.
You may work with a limited palette, and in that case you don’t need to put
out every color you own. Your personality will govern your palette; some
artists like to put out the colors they use in a certain order, some use a color
wheel (discussed in Chapter 7), and some arrange colors according to value
(from light to dark, for example). Some have a messy palette that has no
order at all.
If you need a fuller spectrum of colors, I recommend the color wheel method.
By placing colors in a circle around the perimeter of the palette in the order
they occur naturally in the light spectrum, you make it easy to create good
mixtures. You also put white and black paint on your palette; you’ll probably
need more white than other colors — it just seems to disappear quickly. If
your painting is light in value, place white in the center of the circle of colors.
I suggest mixing a color bridge from the white to each color on the circle. The
bridge creates a slow gradation of white to each pure color, giving you a
number of color choices, like spokes on a bike wheel.
Here’s how to make such a color wheel on your palette. Don’t worry if your
palette gets a bit unorganized — just do your best to make the colors 
you need.
1. Use a palette knife to scoop dime-sized blobs of each color you need
on your palette, wiping the knife with a paper towel between colors.
In Figure 4-2, I’m using the three colors Yellow Ochre, Phthalo Blue, and
Burnt Sienna. In the center I put some white and black. 
The paints I use here are a muted set of primaries. For a bright set of pri-
maries that produces clean secondary colors, use Hansa Yellow, Phthalo
Blue, and Quinacridone Red.
2. To create lighter or darker versions of each color, make color bridges
between the colors and white or black.
Figure 4-1:

palette
placement

handed
painter.
50
Part II: Exploring Tricks and Techniques 

Mix white with each color by using the palette knife to slide a bit of
white toward the color to be lightened. Then slide the color toward the
white. Mix the two like you’re buttering toast until you like the subtle
transition of light to pure color. For darker transitions, repeat the
process by using black rather than white.
You may also want to bridge between Burnt Sienna and Phthalo Blue to
make a dark brown.
3. Add more paint wherever needed.
You may use up all your color in a mix. Just get the tube of paint out and
add another bit of paint to the missing area. Add small amounts as needed
because you can always add more later. Here I had to add more white.
If you take time to make a palette like this, use a stay-wet palette (discussed
later in this chapter and also in Chapter 2) and keep the colors misted by
spraying with clear water from your spray bottle so they don’t dry out too
quickly. If drying is an issue, here are a few other things you can try:
 Use slow-drying acrylics, which take 24 hours to dry. See Chapter 3 for
more on choosing paints.
 Limit how many colors you put out at one time, using only the color(s)
that you can get onto your painting before it dries.
 Add a retarder to slow down the drying time. See Chapter 3 for more on
retarders.
Getting a Grip on Your Brushes:
Practicing Various Brush Strokes
The mark your brush leaves is called a brush stroke. Brush stokes can be evident
or completely hidden. For example, the Impressionists of the 19th century
Figure 4-2:

51
Chapter 4: Basic Painting and Finishing Techniques

allowed their brush strokes to show, using bits of unblended colors to simu-
late light effects. Rembrandt, on the other hand, completely blended his
strokes so that very little brushwork shows. Though the consistency and
chemical makeup of your paint may affect whether your strokes show, brush
technique is the main factor.
Holding your brush in different ways can achieve a variety of effects. I rarely
hold the brush like a pencil, although that position can allow you to make
detailed marks. Often I hold the brush more toward the back of the handle for
a freer stroke — like a conductor directing a symphony. Sometimes I hold the
bush nearly parallel to the surface and skim the painting to add texture.
Experiment with different ways to see what feels correct for you. Figure 4-3a
shows holding the brush parallel to the surface to scumble rough texture by
lightly grazing the edge against the surface. (See “Scumbling” later in this
chapter for more on this stroke.) Figure 4-3b demonstrates holding the brush
near the end to place dots and lines more loosely. This technique also lets
you stand away from the painting to get a more inclusive view. Figure 4-3c
shows a pencil-style grip for adding detail in a controlled manner.
In this section I discuss some brush stroke techniques.
Crisscrossing
A crisscross is exactly what you think it is: an X shape. Applying paint using
this method is efficient and distributes the paint in X patterns. I use this
method to cover an area quickly. A big shape like the sky is a good place to
quickly lay in crisscross brush strokes (like in Figure 4-12 later in this chap-
ter). You can leave it that way or blend it (described next) with a soft brush.
To make a crisscross stroke, use a flat brush and follow these steps:
1. Make an X shape by starting at the top right-hand arm of the X and
pulling the flat part of the brush down toward you, making the widest
stroke possible as you move down to the bottom.
2. Turn your hand over so the palm is toward you and the brush is
flipped over and pull another slash to finish the X, again starting at
the top and painting down (Figure 4-4a).
Imagine describing a melody with this lilting hand movement. Make a
whole row of imaginary crisscrosses to get the feeling.

Part II: Exploring Tricks and Techniques 

Continue making the X shapes till you fill the area (check out Figure 4-4b). If
you want a smooth transition, take a dry flat brush and sweep from side to
side to get the blended effect in Figure 4-4c. This is similar to the blending
technique in Chapter 5.
Scumbling
Scumbling is what it sounds like: random, stumbling movement. To get this
effect, simply push the brush in different directions, letting the paint touch
the surface randomly. Roll the brush as you go. This rambling, haphazard
application is good for producing texture in roads, grassy areas, mountains,
tree foliage, or wherever you want some texture with loose detail.
Point your hand in different directions when holding the brush so the paint
goes on in a variety of angles. Figure 4-5 illustrates scumbling.

Stippling
Stippling is pouncing the brush up and down, leaving little dot patterns (see
Figure 4-6). Some stippling can appear very uniform, with perfect circles for
dots (look at aboriginal tribal art or George Seurat’s Sunday in the Park);
other stippling can be much more random like bouncing colors in a meadow
for wildflowers. You can make whole pictures by stippling light to dark pat-
terns. Even just a few dots make your subject sparkle. Sparkling light on the
water, polka dots on a dress, fur, grassy texture — you may find many sub-
jects that benefit from stippling.
Apply the paint to the surface with a gentle pounce. Round handle brushes
and tips work best. You can also use the handle end of your brush to make
the little perfect dots, keeping the brush vertical and dipping the end oppo-
site the hairs into the paint.
Dry brushing
The “dry” in “dry brushing” is a relative term. Dry brushing uses wet paint,
but the wet isn’t very juicy or liquid. You typically use this stroke with small
brushes for details such as adding the hairs to a wildlife painting. You may
want to pounce your brush on a paper towel to dry it. Then you can drag it
over an area quickly to produce ghost lines that aren’t too pronounced. You
can use whatever brush does the job. A liner gives you a single line, and a fan
brush lets you cover a large area like a grassy meadow. You can use this tech-
nique to slowly place the final details.
In Figure 4-7, I use a rake, a ratty brush with spaces between the hairs that
allows you to quickly paint groups of lines. This specialty shaped brush cre-
ates realistic animal hair and is also handy for painting grass. You can use a
rake to give the impression of complex areas like hair and grass without
spending a lot of time defining every hair or blade of grass.

Part II: Exploring Tricks and Techniques 

Making fine lines with liners
To get a straight and even line, I recommend using a liner brush (a brush with
thin, long hairs perfect for lines). Load the liner brush with paint thinned to the
consistency of ink; as you pull the paint along the surface, roll the brush in your
fingers to deliver the paint evenly and prevent your line from tapering off. Figure
4-8 shows precise lines painted with a liner brush. Mastering this stroke takes
practice, so don’t get discouraged if your early lines aren’t quite up to snuff.
Scratching with scraffito
Scraffito, scrafitto, or sgraffito (skrah-fee-toh) is the practice of scratching into
wet paint with some instrument, such as the end of the brush handle. Figure
4-9 shows an example of scraffito.
Figure 4-8:

liner brush.
Figure 4-7:

55
Chapter 4: Basic Painting and Finishing Techniques

Some brushes have a chisel-like end made especially for scraffito. You can
also use anything else you have handy, such as a credit card corner or a
palette knife.
To quickly achieve the scraffito look, flip your brush around and scrape the
handle end into wet paint to make lines and scribbles. You can get a multicol-
ored look by letting one color dry, painting over it with a second color, and
then scratching the area so that the first color shows through. If you don’t
paint a color first, the canvas shows through.
Painting with a palette knife
Palette knives aren’t just for paint mixing — they’re extremely handy, versa-
tile tools that come in different shapes and sizes. Try using your palette knife
to apply paint or scratch into paint for scraffito (discussed in the previous
section). To paint with the palette knife, pick up a bit of the exact shade you
want on the underneath side of the knife’s tip and tap or drag it onto the
painting. 
You can also use the edge of the knife to make a thin line. Scoop up some
paint, like a little roll of paint along the edge, and then place the edge on the
surface and pull in the direction you want your line. Play with it; palette
knives are fun for smearing colors, scraping away areas, and making shapes
by pushing and pulling paint. And they’re easy to clean — just scrape the
paint off on a palette edge for reuse and wipe the knife clean with a paper
towel. (Check out Chapter 2 for more on palette knives.)
Some artists paint entire paintings with a palette knife. That’s right, no
brushes at all. The colors tend to go on purer with less blending. Figure 4-10
illustrates painting with a palette knife.

The Best Basic Painting Techniques
You’ll use some painting techniques over and over, so I’ve highlighted them
here. Base coating and under painting get you started, wet-into-wet adds
excitement, and layering and glazing will let you build up to the level you
want in your painting.
As you paint, be sure to leave some space all around the border edge of your
painting — don’t put important detail within a half inch of the edge, and make
sure your signature is well within this limit. Remember that a frame will cover
about a quarter inch of the border, so you lose any detail you paint there to
the frame.
Under painting
Under painting or toning the canvas is similar to base coating (covered in the
next section) but involves covering the entire canvas surface. Many artists
like to under paint rather than just paint on a stark white canvas, which can
seem a bit intimidating. You can under paint using the color that will be domi-
nant in the final painting (which aids in better design and leads to unity —
more on design and unity in Chapters 8 and 9), or you can use the opposite
color of what you paint on top (which makes the final colors brighter
because they contrast with the opposite color). (I talk about opposite or
complementary colors, as well as color temperature, in Chapter 7.) For exam-
ple, a picture of green trees may have a red under painting.
The entire painting in Figure 4-11 was under painted in pale blue, although
you may not notice it because I used white and light-colored paint on top of
the blue. The blue peeks through the painting and makes a nifty blue appear-
ance all over.

Chapter 4: Basic Painting and Finishing Techniques

Base coating
Base coating is like underwear for your painting. A base coat of paint is the
first layer of paint (not counting any under painting you do), used to define
shape. The base coat may or may not show through after you apply another
layer of paint on top. The base coat is often the ugly stage of a painting, but
remember that all the lovely details will cover it up. Base coating is simply
putting down a flat (no modeling or shaping) color to reserve the shape within
the whole painting. Base coat an area, shape, animal, or whatever to roughly
define the space that form will occupy in the painting. Sometimes I base coat
in a dark color so the light colors pop out when applied over it; other times, I
make the base coat light so dark details show up. Most of the time, the base
coat is completely covered up by the layers of details and won’t show, but
little bits may peek through depending on how many layers you have. 
Figure 4-12 compares a base-coated painting with its final product. Figure
4-12a is the base coat that defines the shapes for Figure 4-12b, the final still
life of peaches.

Part II: Exploring Tricks and Techniques 

Wet-into-wet and blending
Wet-into-wet is exactly what it sounds like: You put wet paint into a wet back-
ground. When you add new, wet paint to already-applied paint that’s still wet
on the canvas, the colors run into each other and don’t form hard edges. You
can then blend the colors right there on the canvas. It may feel a bit out of
control, but the unexpected swirls are part of the fun. The background in
Figure 4-12 was painted wet-into-wet and softened by blending with a wide,
soft brush. Blending is using your brush to create a slow, smooth transition
by gradually mixing one color into another.
To blend, use a large, soft brush to go back and forth over wet paint till the
edges disappear. You can go over your paint with horizontal, vertical, or
crisscross movements — or use all three. The goal is to get a smooth, gentle
change from one color or value to another without being able to see where
the change is happening (see Figure 4-13).
You may have to clean the brush if it starts dragging around too much paint.
Chapter 6 contains a good blending exercise.
Layering
Layering (painting different levels of a painting on top of each other) helps
create the illusion of depth. Paint one area or shape (even the base coat) and
let it dry. After the first layer is dry, you can add more paint on top in other
colors to define a shape, to add details, or change a color. Let that layer dry
and keep adding more layers till you are satisfied. You can also layer with
things other than paint; Chapter 13 layers papers and pastes to create depth
and interest in collages. Layering thin, tranparent glazes of paint is a good way
to add shadows and create perspective. (More on glazing in the next section.)

59
Chapter 4: Basic Painting and Finishing Techniques

Layering is a way of developing the painting — each layer defines and refines
more till the final product is complete. 
Layering is a great salvage technique. If you don’t like your painting, you can
paint another layer to cover the bad spot.
The old masters painted very thin layers of thinned, transparent paint, often
making paintings so exquisite it seems you can look deep into them. Some
paintings have 40 or more layers of paint; I know one artist who paints 100
layers on a single painting. But whether you use 2 or 20 of them, layers are a
good way to build up paint. And because acrylic paint dries so quickly, the
process of layering is fairly fast, too.
Glazing
A glaze is a transparent (that is, see-through) layer of paint. Glazing, therefore,
is the process of using thin paint to create gazillions of effects: subtle color
changes, unity, shadow, and depth are just a few. You can make your own glaze
by adding medium or water to the paint to make it more transparent, or you
can buy glaze ready to go at the art store. (Chapter 3 talks more about glazes).
Figure 4-14a shows a painting of petunias. To make one petunia stand out, I
glazed all the other petunias in light blue to get Figure 4-14b.
Make a glazing chart to see what happens when you glaze one color over
another. You can make your chart as elaborate and as many squares of colors
as you want to explore. Figure 4-15 shows three colors glazed with dark green
mixed with a medium; I added more medium each time to make the paint
more transparent. Before the top paint dried I made some scraffito lines in
the layer with a palette knife to get familiar with the paint and tools. (See
“Scratching with scraffito” earlier in this chapter for more on the scraffito
brush stroke.) To make your own glazing chart, follow these steps:
1. Paint a square of color on a scrap of canvas paper using a 1⁄2-inch flat
brush.
2. Let it dry.
3. Wipe the excess paint from the brush on a paper towel and rinse your
brush in clean water.

4. Choose another color and paint a square on top of the first color.
Leave a little of the bottom color showing to remind you what was
underneath.
5. Scraffito a line with a palette knife in the top color.
6. Repeat with another square of paint, but next time add medium to the
top layer.
7. Repeat with another square of paint, and add even more medium to
thin the paint for the top layer square.
Once you understand glazing by making a chart, how do you use this infor-
mation in a painting? One of my favorite ways is to visually “push” and “pull”
objects with a glaze. Push subjects back in a painting by painting over them
with a cool (blue would work) glaze. Just like the example in Figure 4-14, one
petunia is left bright white and the others are pushed back a little by glazing
over them with a cool blue glaze. Conversely, pull items forward by covering
them with a warm glaze like yellow. By making the colors transparent glazes,
you can paint over other layers without obliterating what is underneath. In
Chapter 10, you use a glaze to apply a shadow in the same manner.
Finishing with Finesse
When you create a painting you’re happy with and want to display, you have
a few more decisions to make to truly finish it. Do you want to varnish it? If
so, what kind of varnish will work best for this painting? Do you want to mat
it? Frame it? Hang it on the wall? The following sections walk you through
these important considerations. 
To varnish or not to varnish
After you finish a painting, what next? Well, that depends. I had been told (by
people who should know) that acrylic paintings don’t need varnish (a protec-
tive clear layer painted over the entire surface of a painting). But manufactur-
ers suggest that they do indeed need varnish. Whom to believe? Well, a little
background may help you decide.
When paint dries, a skin quickly forms over the wetness and seals it off while
squishy paint is still trapped beneath. If you got out a microscope, you’d see
that the skin has tiny holes in it that allow air to penetrate and further dry
what lies beneath. But thick acrylic paint takes up to two weeks to dry, and
dirt and pollutants eventually find the holes.
Figure 4-15:
A glaze
chart.
61
Chapter 4: Basic Painting and Finishing Techniques

That’s where varnish comes in. It seals the holes in paint and thus protects a
painting over time from dirt and grime. Some varnish contains ultraviolet
light blockers that protect against sunlight and help keep the colors from
fading. Some varnish is good for paintings that are for indoor use, and some
varnish is tougher and made specifically for using outdoors to protect
against harsh sunlight. Plus, varnish helps save your outdoor murals from
being ruined by graffiti. If a mural gets sabotaged by something like graffiti,
the offending tag is painted only on the top layer of varnish, not on the origi-
nal painting. You can just remove this layer of varnish, allowing you to
restore the mural to its former glory.
You can either paint or spray varnish onto your painting, depending on what
works best for you and your piece. Make sure you use acrylic varnish for
acrylic paint. Read the labels on any varnish you buy and test the product on
a practice piece before administering it to your priceless masterpiece. 
Varnishes come in three different surface finishes: matte, semi-gloss, and
gloss. Matte varnish provides a more natural, less shiny finish good for land-
scapes; gloss varnish gives your painting a shinier finish that really pops the
colors, which is ideal for portraits; and semi-gloss creates a middle-of-the-
road finish perfect for still lifes. The examples are merely suggestions; you
can mix and match your own choices for your own reasons. One coat of
brush-on varnish is usually sufficient. You may want to do more than one
layer; keep in mind that more layers of varnish intensify whatever finish
you’ve chosen. I recommend a couple of light coats of spray varnish (with an
hour of drying time in between) to protect the painting.
To compare all three finishes directly, paint a patch of each on a piece of
black cardstock and let it dry. Keep this chart as a reference. Figure 4-16
shows all three on black. Making your own tester lets you tilt the paper and
really examine the finishes.
Go to galleries and talk to artists. See what others are doing with varnish and
go with what you like. Artists are both blessed and cursed with the number
of choices available. Have fun experimenting. Personally I like a gloss spray
varnish. Gloss brings up the colors and seems to make the painting sparkle
with life. You can’t get brush marks by using a spray either.

Presenting your paintings: 
Mats and frames
Instead of storing your work under the bed, mat and/or frame the finished
paintings you’re most proud of and hang them on the wall in a place of honor.
Typically works on paper should get a mat — a thick, sturdy border made out
of an acid-free, cardboard-like substance — that should be covered with glass
and held together by a frame. Works on canvas are usually varnished and
only need a frame. (See the previous section for more on varnish.)
Gallery wraps and cradled boards
Some stretched canvases, called gallery wraps, are neatly wrapped around
the sides so that no staples show (see Figure 4-17). The sides can be different
depths, usually one or two inches deep. You can paint the sides, and no out-
side frame is required. Some artists paint the sides all black, and some
extend the picture around the sides. 
Cradled board is a wooden painting surface with finished reinforcement bars
on one side. The coyote in Figure 4-11 was painted on a cradled board, and I
painted the sides by simply extending the scene. You can also paint directly
on the back of the cradled board — the cradle serves as a built-in frame.
Figure 4-18 shows the side and back of the cradled board.

Chapter 4: Basic Painting and Finishing Techniques

Choosing a frame
Choosing a frame is a matter of personal taste. I have owned a frame shop for
nearly 20 years, so it’s an area near and dear to my heart. I think choosing the
right frame is important. Many times the way an artwork is presented helps
sell the painting. At art shows, I hate to see artists demeaning their art with a
recycled frame that says, “I think my painting should join the garage sale I
bought this frame at.” The frame should elevate the art.
You can pretty safely choose a simple frame with clean lines.  Too much orna-
mentation may distract from your picture; the masterpieces in the art muse-
ums are very ornate, but in most modern art shows, a similar frame would be
a distraction.
Budget has a lot to do with the frame-choosing process, I understand. But
don’t be afraid of your neighborhood framer. Framers often have deals, and
they’re on your side when it comes to making your art look its best. My frame
shop has a “bargain basement” of good-quality, affordable frames — proof
that you don’t have to sacrifice quality for thriftiness. Look for a framer that
produces frame designs that you like. The frame designer can guide you to
choose mats and frames that will show your work to its full advantage.
Going with a mat
If you want to mat your canvas-paper painting behind glass, choose a neutral
mat color in a different width than the frame molding width. As always, keep
variety in mind; variety in sizes creates more interest than monotony does.
You may even consider a double mat, which is a mat inside of a slightly differ-
ent sized mat. Not only does the double mat look nice, but the added depth
also gives a good amount of air space between the art and the glass for
proper conservation.
If the art touches the glass, it will eventually stick to the glass and and poten-
tially peel off the paper and adhere to the glass permanently. Moisture-rich
atmospheres are especially susceptible to this process.  
In general, the total mat width should be 3 or 4 inches. Inside or interior mats
are usually 1⁄4 inch; however, they can be 1⁄8 inch to 1 inch for effect. As with all
art, you can always do something other than the norm. 
Figure 4-19a shows a framed painting with a single mat; Figure 4-19b is a
double mat — the inside mat is 1⁄4 inch. 
Neutral colors are common in matting because most art shows allow only
white and off-white mats. However, you can use any color that makes the pic-
ture look its best. If you’re hanging your painting in the living room and want
to match the mat to your couch, go ahead.
My formula for choosing mat colors (besides going neutral for shows) is this:
The inside quarter-inch mat should be the color of the center of interest
(where I want you to look) in the painting. The outside mat is more neutral
(white, black, gray, or off-white) to complement the picture.
64
Part II: Exploring Tricks and Techniques 

Hanging it up
Before you hang your painting, you want to mount it if needed, and seal up
the back with a dust cover (optional), using acid-free products (see Chapter 2
for more on the benefits of acid-freedom). If the painting is a work on paper, it
must be mounted or attached to something a little sturdier like backing board
to protect it and keep it rigid. Anything that is limp, such as paper or fabric,
needs to be mounted. Your framer will attach the paper to the backing board
using linen tape or acid-free mounting products. Backing board is usually spe-
cial acid-free 1⁄8-inch-thick board. This board is then stapled or nailed in the
frame to secure it. A dust cover is paper that seals the back of the frame so no
dust gets into the art and makes it look nice on the back. 
Canvas is often painted while on stretcher bars or onto hard board. It is
already mounted in this way. The stretcher bars remain on the painting, and a
frame is added. The frame should be deep enough to do this. A dust cover is
optional. A wire should be attached on the back for hanging.
Figure 4-20 shows the back side of a framed artwork. The dust cover is black
paper, the wire is wrapped tight around D-rings, and there are bump-ons at
the bottom corners to help the piece hang straight and not tip.
I like to cover my paintings with conservation glass, which prevents ultravio-
let light from penetrating and fading the colors. Use D-shaped rings screwed
to wooden molding to hold heavy-duty wire against the back to hang the pic-
ture. And place little round bumpers on the back bottom corners to help
keep the art straight on the wall.

Project: 30-Minute Artist Trading Card
One hot trend in the art world right now is artist trading cards, or ATCs.
They’re tiny, original works of art that are traded among artists like baseball
cards. In fact, artists often collect and store them in plastic sleeves as they
would baseball cards. An ATC is small: 21⁄2 x 31⁄2 inches. You can buy pads of
paper in that size or cut your own. You can trade them online or start a swap
with your local art buddies.
This project takes you through creating an ATC. For this example, I paint a
miniature version of the coyote from Figure 4-12. You can do your own thing,
or you can follow my lead for your first one:
1. Get a piece of canvas paper 21⁄2 x 31⁄2 inches.
2. Trace the drawing in Figure 4-21 and then place a sheet of transfer
paper between the drawing and the canvas paper and retrace the
lines of the drawing.
See Chapter 6 for more on transferring drawings with transfer paper.
3. Prepare your palette with small amounts of Burnt Sienna, Yellow
Ochre, Phthalo Blue, white, and black, and make three Burnt Sienna
color bridges (to Phthalo Blue, white, and black). 
You won’t need much paint for these tiny works — a dot about the size
of half a penny of each color should do. See “Setting Up Your Palette and
Supplies” earlier in this chapter for instructions on creating color
bridges.

4. Paint the rocks using the palette knife.
A. Use the knife to spread some gray-brown from the bridge between
Burnt Sienna and Phthalo Blue on the area of the rock as if you were
spreading peanut butter on toast.
B. Pick up other colors like Yellow Ochre and Phthalo Blue and tap
some more color onto the rocks with the flat part of the knife, keep-
ing lighter colors toward the top of the rock and the darker colors
toward the bottom where light would be blocked.
I tapped the wide bottom of the palette knife onto the rock colors a
few times to release excess paint. This technique also makes the
paint stand up in little peaks and gives the rock texture.
C. Blend the colors by brushing over them with a clean, damp, soft
brush.
D. Keep manipulating the color till you like your rocks.
You can gather more paint by scraping the knife into the palette
paint colors. I even picked up several colors at once. Tap on more
colors if desired. Scrape some scraffito grass lines in the rock while
it’s still wet (see Figure 4-22).
5. Using a small (#4 or so) brush, base coat the coyote with Burnt Sienna
and a dark brown from the Burnt Sienna–Phthalo Blue bridge.
Use Burnt Sienna for most of the coyote and dark brown for the dark
edges of the coyote (see Figure 4-23). See “Base coating” earlier in this
chapter for more on base coating.

6. Use a 1⁄4-inch flat brush to crisscross some sky colors behind the
coyote and then soften those strokes with a clean, damp, soft 
brush.
I used Phthalo Blue with white mixed in to lighten it. I also crisscrossed
some lightened brown from the Burnt Sienna–white bridge. I made some
areas darker in order to make a place for the white of the coyote to
stand out later (see Figure 4-24a). Loosen any edges by softening the
paint while wet (see Figure 4-24b). See “Crisscrossing” and “Wet-into-wet
and blending” earlier in this chapter for instructions on making the
crisscross and blending brushstrokes.
7. Use a 1⁄4-inch flat rake brush to paint the white and dark coyote fur
(see Figure 4-25).
I pulled dark brown paint (from the Burnt Sienna–Phthalo Blue bridge)
through the areas of fur. You can alternate using the dark brown paint
and light or white paint to make the fur. If white is too bright, tint some
brown by adding white paint until it’s light brown. Pull the fur lines in
the direction that the fur naturally grows.

8. Use a liner brush and black paint to outline the dark details of the
coyote face: eyes, nose, and inside the ears.
If the lines get too wide, you can clean up edges with white paint after
the black dries.
9. Paint Burnt Sienna, Yellow Ochre, and dark brown masses in the fore-
ground near the front, scraffito some grass in the paint while it’s still
wet, and then use a liner brush to add some grass lines using Yellow
Ochre and Burnt Sienna.
10. Finish the details.
Glaze some transparent yellow (add water to dilute) over the scraffito
grasses. Use a liner brush to make more grass if desired. Put Yellow
Ochre in the eyes (the coyote’s, not yours). Paint any light areas of the

 Putting experimental techniques to work
S
ociety today is all about instant gratification — people want everything
now and without a lot of work. Fortunately, some painting techniques
give you just that; some of the tricks I reveal in this chapter create details
that make it seem as though you spent hours making them happen. Your
audience will be amazed. (Don’t tell them it was fun and easy. They wouldn’t
believe you anyway.)
This chapter covers fun and quick ways to get some interesting effects in
your painting without spending hours working on little details.
Ready, Set, Experiment
For now, I want you to forget about making anything that looks like something
real or natural. That’s right. The pressure to make perfect drawings or render
identifiable objects is off for the time being. In experimental, nonrepresenta-
tional work — the kind explored in this chapter — you simply enjoy the
colors, textures, and surprises that happen when you play with the paint.
Play is a good word. It sets the mood for how you should explore these 
techniques.
Sometimes these experimental techniques just don’t work, and sometimes
they work better than you planned. That’s why they’re called experimental,
and it’s just the nature of the beast. Not every work of art succeeds. But
having that aha moment when you see something you like in one of your
experiments makes all your effort worth it.
Set up your palette and paint area as I explain in Chapter 2 and get some 5-x-
7-inch canvas paper ready. Use one sheet for each experiment technique in
this chapter. You’re not wasting the paper: When dry, put all the experiments
in a folder or big envelope. You can refer to them later for painting ideas (like
the project at the end of this chapter).

These projects are best done laying flat on a table. If the paint is thick enough
that it won’t run, you can work using an easel. But most of these experiments
will drip, so you’re better off at a table.
Adding Stuff to Your Paint
In today’s instant gratification world, everyone likes quick results. Artists are
no different. If an artist can toss a little magic dust on the painting to have
something appear instantly, why wouldn’t she? Below are some magic-dust
tips to try. These tricks can be fast ways to make texture, backgrounds, or
even entire paintings.
The magic time to use the tricks in this section is just as the shine is leaving
the paint — when it’s temporarily damp. When paint dries, you’re too late;
it’s set, and you’ve lost your magic window. And they don’t work if the paint
is too wet, either — the tricks just wash away.
Salt
When you sprinkle regular table salt onto damp paint, it makes lighter-col-
ored, ragged-edged dots when the paint dries.
Think grains of salt, not tablespoons — less is more in this case. Use salt
sparingly. Too much salt will stick to the surface and make actual texture
when you really just wanted little sparkles of dots for texture that brush off
when dry.
Here’s how to spice up your paint with salt:
1. Choose a color of paint and thin it with enough water to be transparent.
It should resemble the consistency of ink.
2. Paint it on your paper in any shape you like.
For best results, the paint should be evenly spread and fairly transpar-
ent, with no puddles.
3. When the painting is damp, pick up a pinch of salt between your
index finger and thumb and gently sprinkle it into the area where you
want the dot pattern to occur.
You have to sprinkle the salt when the wet shine of the paint is just
beginning to turn dull. If the paint is dry or too thick, you don’t get the
right results. Leave the salt in place until the paint dries.
4. When the painting is dry, just brush away the salt.
Sometimes the salt adheres to the paint, especially if you sprinkled it on
too thickly or when the paint was too wet. In that case, you have a real
texture, which may or may not work for your purposes.
See Figure 5-1 for an example of this technique.
72
Part II: Exploring Tricks and Techniques 

Alcohol or water
Alcohol acts similarly to salt when you add it to paint. Sprinkling rubbing
alcohol onto damp paint leaves ragged dots of lighter color behind when the
paint dries. The method works with water or your favorite booze as well.
Each liquid makes a slightly different dot pattern, but all are similar; use what
you have on hand. You may even experiment and find something brand new.
You may want to practice first, using water on a tabletop to improve your aim
(make sure the table or whatever surface you use can take water). Squirt
water until you get the desired pattern of droplets, then wipe it up and you’re
ready to try it on paper (or other surfaces).
Here’s how to apply alcohol or other liquid to paint:
1. Paint on your paper in any shape you like.
For best results, the paint should be evenly spread and fairly transpar-
ent, with no puddles.
2. Pour about 1⁄2 inch of the alcohol (or other liquid) in a shallow dish at
least 3 inches wide.
3. When the paint is damp, put all your fingers together like you were
picking up a feather and dip them into the liquid.
4. Flick your fingertips out, against the thumb, to spray the liquid
toward the paint.
You should get small, irregular dots of liquid on the paint.
5. Allow the paint to dry.
When it does, check out your (hopefully) awesome pattern.
Figure 5-2 shows an example of the liquid-flicking technique.

Chapter 5: Building Your Repertoire with Quick Tricks and Techniques

Sand, sawdust, and beyond
Because wet acrylic acts like glue, you can make real textures by sprinkling
something like sand onto wet paint, to make a kind of sandpaper. For example,
would your beach scene benefit if it had real sand in it? Check out the seascape
in Figure 5-3, which features real sand. Perhaps you can make a rough tree bark
even more real by adding some sawdust to the paint. Use your imagination!
You can add just about anything you want to paint. One artist painted memo-
rials to commemorate a deceased loved one and actually added that person’s
ashes to the paint. Talk about realism!

Part II: Exploring Tricks and Techniques 

Thinking Outside the Brush
You can work with paint in a lot more ways than just brushing. Sponges, for
example, are a great way to apply paint, and they come in a variety of shapes
and sizes. Sponges can be a fast way to cover a large area with an irregular
texture. You can make a tree full of leaves in a couple of pounces. Rollers and
plastic wrap also add variety to your paint’s texture.
Sponges and rollers
When painting with sponges, use paint that you’ve diluted a little bit with
water. If the paint is too thick, sponging doesn’t work well.
1. Wet the sponge with water.
Wring it out so that it’s just damp.
2. Dip a portion of the sponge into the diluted paint.
3. Apply to the surface of the canvas paper (discussed in Chapter 2).
Try different application methods to see different textures: pounce up
and down, drag sponge across paper, touch sponge to paper and twist.
Note: You can dip different parts of a sponge into more than one color to pro-
duce multicolor areas.
Check out Figure 5-4 to see some of these tools and the results you can obtain.

Chapter 5: Building Your Repertoire with Quick Tricks and Techniques

Natural sea sponges
Natural sea sponges cost more than your typical synthetic sponges do, but
both do the job well. Because of their different-sized holes, sea sponges leave
empty spots when you apply paint with them. Simply tap the canvas with the
sponge to leave the paint on the surface. Repeat as many times as necessary.
For a more random, natural look, turn your hand so that the sponge touches
the surface at different angles. If you touch at the same angle each time, you
produce a more patterned look.
With just a few pounces, you can make all the foliage for a tree. It’ll look like
you spent days painting all the little leaves and details. 
Shaped sponges
These sponges can be shaped like anything from circles to teddy bears. They
work like rubber stamps for repeated images.
You can make your own wrapping paper or wallpaper by stamping a repeated
image with a shaped sponge. The ideas you come up with may be inspired by
the shapes you find. Or create your own shaped sponge by taking scissors to
a plain old rectangular sponge (which I discuss further in the next section).
Compressed sponges
If you can’t find a sponge in the shape you want, the best way to make your
own is to use compressed sponges. Because they’re about 1⁄8-inch thick when
dry and new, you can easily cut them into your own shapes with regular scis-
sors. When you soak them, they expand to 1⁄2-inch thick or so. Of course, after
the sponge gets wet it stays puffed up forever, so when you’re buying com-
pressed sponges, you may as well buy a lot of them.
Rollers
Sponge rollers in 1- or 2-inch-wide sizes are awfully handy for covering larger
areas quickly. They also work well for applying gesso (surface preparation
primer; see Chapter 2 for more) to surfaces to get them ready to paint.
Sponge rollers are great for skies. Base coat a big blue sky quickly with a
sponge roller. The rolling sponge usually slips off the handle for easy cleanup
with soap and water.
Plastic wrap
Any plastic wrap, such as sandwich wrap, is a cool tool for painting.
It works like this: When the paint on your canvas paper is still damp, press
your wrinkled plastic into it and leave it there to dry. Drying takes a while —
after all, you just covered the paint with plastic. When the paint dries, the
wrinkles from the plastic are imbedded in it. You can reuse the plastic, too,
though probably not for sandwiches.
76
Part II: Exploring Tricks and Techniques 

Here’s how to paint with plastic:
1. Get some plastic wrap or tear up pieces of plastic grocery bags.
Make the pieces easy sizes to handle: Tear up about six rectangles mea-
suring 4 x 6 inches or so.
2. With a 1⁄2-inch flat brush, use the colors you’ve chosen to paint the
area you want to cover.
For Figure 5-5 I used Burnt Sienna, Burnt Umber, Ultramarine Blue, and
some Yellow Ochre. I changed the color every inch or so to have lots of
variety of color.
3. Before the paint dries, wrinkle the plastic wrap so it has lots of texture
and press it right onto the painted area.
If the plastic is too stiff and won’t adhere to the paint, set something on
top of it to weigh it down so it makes good contact. Feel free to manipu-
late the plastic to get lines and shapes any way you want. The plastic turns
dark where it touches the paint. The light areas are the lines that will be
left darker (fully painted) when you remove the plastic. The dark areas
will be lighter when they dry because some of the paint will come off on
the plastic.
4. Let it dry.
It’s okay to peek: Carefully lift an edge of the plastic. If the shapes remain,
you can remove the plastic entirely. If the color runs, wait some more —
the longer, the better. If you have time, leave it overnight.
5. Remove the plastic and paint on top of the area to develop more
detail (if desired).
This technique makes great rocky textures when you do a landscape.

Chapter 5: Building Your Repertoire with Quick Tricks and Techniques

Cobwebs and cheesecloth
Around October (or even July, it seems), the stores start stocking Halloween
goodies. Pick up a package or two of fake spider webs to use in your painting.
When you pull the polyester webbing apart and embed it in wet paint, it
leaves a crystal-like pattern when you remove it. Other loose woven fabrics
also make unusual textures. In fact, you can put cheesecloth, lace, and any-
thing else you may think of into paint to create an effect. Whatever you use,
tear it up or stretch it out so you have open spots.
Here’s one technique:
1. Prepare three colors of paint on your palette.
Add enough water to the paint to make an inky consistency.
2. Apply paint to an 8-x-10-inch piece of paper.
Cover the paper quickly with all three colors so the colors can mingle
their edges but still be identified as separate color areas. Keep the paint
moist by using a spray mist of water if necessary.
3. Pull cobwebs apart so thin strands of threads show, and then place
the cobwebs onto the wet painted surface.
Cover the entire paper.
4. Add more paint on top of the cobwebs.
By wetting the cobwebs, you help them stay down on the paper better.
You can manipulate the paint, cobwebs, and water on the paper till you’re
satisfied.
5. Let the work dry in place.
This process may take an hour or overnight, depending on how wet it got.
6. After it’s dry, peel off the cobwebs to reveal the textured painting.
You can use this product as the final project or put another layer over
the top. Figure 5-6 shows the cobweb technique in action.
This technique makes great backgrounds, but sometimes it turns out so well I
don’t want to cover it up.

Part II: Exploring Tricks and Techniques 
How cold is too cold?
One year, a painter friend and I vowed to paint
outside once a week all year. It was an ambitious
goal considering the winter weather in Colorado.
One particularly cold day we were just finishing 
a landscape when my paint must have hit the
freezing temperature — it crystallized in my sky.
Unfortunately, my palette also turned to an ice-
cream-like consistency. We decided that some
temperatures are in fact too cold to paint outside.

Dripping, Spraying, and Spattering
Not only can you use plenty of tools besides a brush to apply paint to a sur-
face (as I demonstrate in the previous sections), but you can also use nothing
at all! That’s right; the following techniques involve applying paint through
thin air.
Jack the dripper
Wet paints just ask to drip — so let them! If you accidentally drip, make a
bunch more drips so the original looks like you did it on purpose. Jackson
Pollock painted dripping abstract masterpieces in New York during the 
1940s. Figure 5-7 shows a couple of examples of my own Pollock-inspired 
artwork.
My art friends once even threw a Pollock Frolic party. Give it a go! Rent the
movie Pollock to get in the mood. Serve ice cream with toppings in squeeze
bottles to create a Pollock dessert.
Here’s how to make your own Jackson Pollock:
1. Thin your paints so the paint can drip onto the canvas or paper.
If the paint is too thick, it may not spatter. Try thinning it more with
water.
2. Dip a paintbrush into the thinned paint.
3. Hold the brush upright and snap your wrist downward to throw paint
onto the surface.
Figure 5-6:

79
Chapter 5: Building Your Repertoire with Quick Tricks and Techniques

Another way to make drips is to hold your paint-loaded brush in your
dominant hand, and a pencil in your other hand. Then tap the paint-
loaded brush against the pencil over your paper. The shock should dis-
perse paint onto the paper.
If you don’t want to mess with thinning your paint, you can also use fluid
acrylics, which are ten times thinner in viscosity than regular acrylics. Fluid
acrylics come in bottles and are the perfect consistency for dripping.
Spray it again, Sam
Spray bottles can be important painting tools; I spray water from the bottles
to create texture. I also spray paint from bottles to add color to an area.
Trigger sprays, which you squeeze, produce a firm jet. Pump sprays (like the
kind found on a bottle of hairspray) make an irregular pattern good for
foliage and other odd textures. Atomizers produce a very fine spray, like an
airbrush. You can make a cheap airbrush by diluting paint and using it in a
spray bottle to apply a mist of color rather than water.

Part II: Exploring Tricks and Techniques 

If you use acrylic paint in a spray bottle or airbrush, be sure to clean the con-
tainer and nozzle well after each use. If the paint dries, the nozzle is a goner.
Some commercial paint cleaners and solvents (available in any good art store)
can help dissolve dried paint, but the best method is prevention. Keep it clean.
Figure 5-8 shows a spray pattern and the bottle that created it.
I also keep a spray bottle full of water near my acrylic paint at all times to
mist the palette to prevent it from drying too quickly. I also use spray to
move paint on the painting, to soften an edge, or to allow more drying time. If
the color is too dark, thick, or hard-edged, a quick spray of water can lighten,
thin, and soften it. See Chapter 10 for more on acrylic “watercolor.”
Spray stenciling
Here’s how to make a spray stencil:
1. Find some stuff you can ruin, like old doilies, soiled lace, or nuts and
bolts.
2. Dilute various colors of paint in inexpensive pump spray bottles.
3. Arrange your objects on your paper.
4. Spray the paint over the objects onto the paper.
5. Allow it to dry and then remove the objects.
You’ve just created a stencil. The objects masked the areas from receiv-
ing paint.
6. Rearrange the objects and spray another layer.
Make as many layers as you like.
7. Stop whenever you like the finished product.

kitchen?

Project: Combination Technique Abstract
Project time! Get out all your experiments. Lay them all out on a table. Enjoy
for a moment. Which ones worked well? Do you think you can use different
colors, different amounts of water, more or less pressure in your sponge
pounces? You may want to leave your sample exercises out to inspire you as
you work on this project.
For this project, use the techniques you liked best in order to make an
abstract work of art. Abstract art doesn’t have to look like anything. It just has
to please you in some way. (I discuss abstract art more in Chapter 12.)
So, free your mind from thinking that this project has to be anything recogniz-
able. You may see things in the paint later, like seeing objects in clouds. The
steps I outline are just to get you started; you can repeat, move, change, or
eliminate steps as you like. You can redo this project as many times as you
want. I guarantee no two will look alike.
1. Prepare your palette.
Choose your colors (or mimic mine; I went for Cobalt Blue, Sap Green,
and Lemon Yellow). Squirt a quarter-size circle out onto the palette. Pick
up a bit of color on a 1⁄4-inch flat brush and place it on the (clean) palette
mixing area. Dip the brush in water and add enough water to the paint to
make a smooth cream consistency. Repeat with each color, using a clean
brush. You should have a puddle of each separate color. Spritz water
from the spray bottle as needed to keep paint from drying out.

Part II: Exploring Tricks and Techniques 

2. Choose an 11-x-15-inch piece of acrylic paper.
I like to place the paper on a piece of newspaper so I can paint to the
edges and not get paint on the table.
3. Dampen the part of the paper you want to work on first.
Wetting and working the whole paper may be too big of an area to con-
trol before it dries. Brush some water onto the upper left quarter, using
a 1⁄2-inch flat brush, so that it’s damp but doesn’t have puddles. (You can
absorb puddles with a damp brush or tissue).
4. Change brushes.
Rinse the flat brush and lay it down to dry or use again later. Pick up a
round #10 (or so) brush to paint colors.
5. Apply blue to the damp area.
Dip the #10 round brush into the blue puddle on your palette to cover
the tip (to about half the length of the brush head). Stroke into the damp
area of paper and let the paint disperse into the wetness. Place as much
blue as you like. You may leave areas blank.
Don’t put paint past the metal piece (called the ferrule). It’s harder to clean.
6. Clean your brush between colors.
Clean off the paint by swirling it into clean water. Test it on a scrap to
see whether it’s clean before dipping into another color. When you’re fin-
ished with the brush, lay it on the table to dry.
7. Add any other colors while the paint is wet.
Pick up a different color and touch the tip of the brush to the wet paper to
make a circle of color. Pull the brush across the paper to make a line. Squig-
gle and wiggle as much as you want to achieve as many marks as you like.
If the paint starts to dry too quickly, mist it with the spray bottle of water.
8. Apply the technique of your choice.
While the paint is still damp, you can add plastic wrap, salt, alcohol, cloth,
cobwebs, sand, and/or sawdust. You can spatter before or after the paint
dries. After the paint is dry, you can spray more paint through stencils.
9. Let the area dry.
After the area is dry, remove any additives (such as plastic wrap or salt).
10. Repeat Steps 3 through 9 in another quarter of the page till you have
the entire page filled.
Try to look for shapes in your painting. Abstract paintings often make good
backgrounds for something to be painted on top. Figure 5-10 shows a house
painted over a background created by plastic wrap.

f you want your paintings to look like something recognizable, you need to
do some sketching and drawing. Drawing is the skeleton, and paint is the
flesh. You can always work on improving your drawing skills — check out
Drawing For Dummies by Brenda Hoddinott (Wiley) for lots more about this
essential basic art skill.
You can spend lots of time learning to draw (and you should if you want to
develop as an artist), but this chapter gets you going fast. After all, you
bought this book because you want to paint. Don’t be afraid to tap into avail-
able tools to help. You enjoy many technological advantages that the old
masters lacked: Photography, digital images, computers, and projectors are
just a few of the tools that make drawing easy today.
But begin with the simple tools: good old pencil and paper.

Making Thumbnail Sketches
A little preplanning makes your paintings more successful. I like to make mini
sketches, called thumbnails, to plan how my painting will look when finished.
But I make them a bit bigger than a real thumbnail.
To make a thumbnail drawing plan, follow these steps:
1. Get a piece of 81⁄2-x-11-inch white paper and a pencil.
Any pencil is fine.
2. Decide which shape you want your painting to be and draw the 2-x-3-
inch outline of it.
You may choose a horizontal rectangle (landscape orientation), vertical
rectangle (portrait orientation), square, oval, circle, or some other shape
(as long as you can find a canvas that shape).
3. Use simple lines to divide parts of the thumbnail into smaller shapes
that represent the elements in your painting.
Do you have a horizon line? Draw it. Use circles and scribbles to repre-
sent complex shapes — all you’re doing is finding a place for shapes and
deciding where they look best. This process should only take a minute;
it’s just a trial drawing for your eyes only, a quick and useful map for you
to see where things should go.
4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 to create six or so thumbnails, drawing different
shapes and rearranging the placement of the elements each time.
5. Choose the best thumbnail plan from your six choices to enlarge for a
painting.
Now that you have a map, you can execute your plan more easily when it
comes time to paint. See the example in Figure 6-1.
A digital camera is a handy tool to try out different thumbnail arrangements.
For example, find an apple (or whatever you have on hand) and a camera and
take some photos rearranging the subject, horizon, and surrounding space in
different configurations like you would for a thumbnail sketch. Figure 6-2
shows some different arrangements, using an apple.
Enlarging Sketches
When you have a thumbnail nailed down, you need to make it larger to fit the
size of your final painting. The trick to enlarging your thumbnail is making
sure the big sketch is proportionate to the smaller one.

Chapter 6: Drawn to Paint — Even if Your Drawing Skills Need Work

Here’s a quick way to determine the proper proportions of the big painting:
1. Cut out your thumbnail (or redraw it) and put it in the lower left-hand
corner of a new piece of larger paper.
2. Take a ruler and lay it across diagonal corners of your thumbnail sketch.
3. Using the pencil, extend the line beyond the sketch.
The top corner of the enlargement can land anywhere along that line,
and it will have the same proportional height-to-length ratio of the
thumbnail sketch. Refer to Figure 6-3 for an example.
Figure 6-3:

a ruler.
Figure 6-2:

88
Part II: Exploring Tricks and Techniques 

The proportion ratio (height to width) you just figured out will help you deter-
mine the shape of your canvas or other substrate. Is it vertical, horizontal, rec-
tangular? A standard size or something else? Now, decide what size you’re
going to make your painting. You could extend your proportion line all the way
to the same size of your canvas to make sure the proportions are the same.
After you know the final size you want, you have several ways to enlarge your
sketch. You can wing it by drawing a new, larger sketch directly on the canvas
or surface. You can also use an enlargement method, such as a grid, or a tool
such as a computer or projector. The following sections discuss these options.
Eyeballing it
One way to enlarge your drawing is to just observe the drawing and sketch it
larger. This method works well if you have good hand-eye coordination, if you
draw well, or if your shapes are simple. Natural objects or scenes, like flow-
ers or landscapes, can vary from the original a lot without anyone knowing.
When you paint it, you paint the feeling or essence of the object and try not
to stress about the accuracy of painting every detail exactly like it appears.
After all, you’re interpreting the object, not making a photograph.
Buildings, on the other hand, need some realistic form so they look habitable.
One reason artists like old buildings and barns is because they’re more for-
giving in their structure. If something is crooked, it just adds charm. Portraits
also need to be pretty accurate because if not, they may not look like the
person. Of course, if you want to paint like Picasso, you can rearrange eyes
and noses however you want. If you’re comfortable drawing freehand, you
should be fine; if not, you may consider some other methods for enlarging
your thumbnail into a final piece. Read on for more options.
Gridding it
A good way to enlarge a sketch more accurately is to use a grid method. Divide
the thumbnail sketch into smaller squares. If the drawing is simple, divide the
thumbnail in half vertically and horizontally. Then divide your large painting
surface likewise in both directions. Transfer the drawing by seeing where the
drawing lines intersect the dividing lines and copying that on the larger scale.
If your drawing is more complicated, further dividing the space into more
squares is beneficial — the more intersections you can use for gauging where
images go, the more accurate your transfer will be. You can draw a handy
grid on see-through acetate (clear plastic) with a permanent black marker.
Place the gridded acetate over the sketch and then draw the same number of
squares on the final canvas (adjusting for the larger size of the canvas).
Transfer the drawing lines into the squares, using the thumbnail as reference.
Figure 6-4 shows an example of this enlargement method.
Copying it
Another method of enlargement may be to use a copier or computer printer
to enlarge the thumbnail. If you have a scanner, you may be able to do this
89
Chapter 6: Drawn to Paint — Even if Your Drawing Skills Need Work

process yourself, depending on your software and hardware. If not, your local
print shop can also help you figure out how much to enlarge your thumbnail
to fit your painting — be sure to know your final dimensions when you go to
the print shop.
Projecting it
You can find special projectors that enlarge drawings; these contraptions are
especially handy when you need a large drawing on a wall for a mural, for exam-
ple. Slide projectors are an endangered species, but they’re great tools for pro-
jecting an image onto any surface if you can get your hands on one (check your
local garage sales). Nowadays, you can get digital projectors as well. These pro-
jectors are great if you want to enlarge the exact image, but they aren’t cheap.
Tracing Your Way to a 
Great Painting Sketch
Tracing paper (the thin, frosted, see-though paper) can make your painting
life easier. Because tracing paper is so thin, you can place it directly on top of
an image and still see what’s below, allowing you to easily trace that image.
Tracing paper also lets you tinker with your image until you get a design
you’re happy with.
Tracing paper is inexpensive — buy and use lots of it. You can find rolls and
pads of it in all sizes at any art store; you can use clear mylar and acetates in
the same way, but these products are a little more expensive.

Part II: Exploring Tricks and Techniques 

Finalizing your sketches 
with tracing paper
Tracing paper can be a wonderful tool for quick fixes. For example, maybe
your enlarged sketch is pretty rough and you want to clean it up. Get a piece
of tracing paper of the same size and cover the enlargement. Redraw it on the
tracing paper, using the sketch beneath as a guide. Voilà — a clean copy.
Not quite happy with the placement of the shapes in your sketch? Tracing
paper lets you move mountains! (Well, sketched mountains anyway.) Simply
cut out the offending shape on the tracing paper and move it to a better
place. Tape all your cutouts together, and then put another piece of tracing
paper over all that and redraw. Now you’re thinking like a designer, and
better design makes better paintings. (I give you lots more design tips in
Chapters 8 and 9.)
Copying a photograph by 
using tracing paper
You can create an image you want to paint by tracing a photo that inspires
you (because you should always be taking lots of photographs of subjects you
may want to paint). An outline of your photo’s crucial shapes (called a
cartoon) lets you know where to put paint in different colors. To make a car-
toon, simply place a piece of tracing paper over your photo and trace the
important lines that will help you make your painting. Don’t limit yourself to
one photo. You can trace a sky in one photo, a tree from another photo, and a
lake from yet another and rearrange them all into a new grouping.
You may also want to make lines to indicate shadow edges, but you don’t
have to transfer all the lines in the photo. The cartoon is your outline, not the
final image; it simply guides you to where you want to put the paint. You
paint the details on the canvas. If your traced photograph is smaller than the
size of painting you want to do, enlarge it by using one of the methods
described earlier.
Organize your photographs for use as painting reference materials. Keep fold-
ers or files of subjects: clouds, flowers, rivers, trees, birds, whatever you
want to paint. When you need an idea, go to your file and see whether it
inspires a painting. I have both a tangible file like a shoebox that I can flip
through, and also digital folders that I can look at on the computer. Both
methods work well for me.
Beware of the optical distortion that often occurs in photography, because
some photographic lenses distort vertical lines. For example, the edges of a
tall building may curve slightly and appear to converge as they go toward the
sky. If you don’t want your painting to look like you used a photo directly,
correct these distortions when drawing out the image before painting.

Chapter 6: Drawn to Paint — Even if Your Drawing Skills Need Work

Getting Your Drawing onto 
the Painting Surface
I prefer to make my outline cartoon drawing (discussed in the previous sec-
tion) on paper first and then transfer it to the final painting surface. Why? If
you draw directly on the painting surface, any erasing or changes you make
can compress surface textures and create spots that resist paint. Keep the
painting surface clean and pristine by making all your changes on a separate
piece of paper and then transferring it to the painting surface.
Transfer the drawing by placing a sheet of graphite paper (paper that trans-
fers marks, easily found at art stores) between the drawing and the painting
surface. By retracing the lines on the drawing, the graphite under the
graphite paper transfers to the painting surface everywhere you traced.
Figure 6-5 shows you a graphite transfer.
Using a red (or other color) ballpoint pen to draw over the original sketch
helps you tell where you have traced.
Don’t press too hard while you’re tracing — you don’t want to make an inden-
tation in the painting surface by adjusting the pressure on the pen.

Part II: Exploring Tricks and Techniques 

Blending with Paint
Put away the pencil — you’re ready to draw with paint. Here are some exer-
cises to get ready for drawing this chapter’s project in paint.
Making a smooth transition
Blending refers to making a smooth transition from one color to another, such
as a light to a dark or a cool to a warm. (More on blending in Chapter 4).
Making a smooth transition between colors and values is an important skill
for your painting career. If you were using a pencil to make a drawing, blend-
ing is a way of transitioning the pencil strokes when shading a form. When
painting, you are still drawing with a brush, but it is much easier and faster to
blend large areas because the wider path of the brush hairs blends quicker
than the fine tip of the pencil.
Practice painting a smooth transition from one color to another.
1. Choose two colors of paint.
In Figure 6-6, I use Scarlet Red and Ultramarine Blue.
93
Chapter 6: Drawn to Paint — Even if Your Drawing Skills Need Work
But I can’t draw!
Don’t panic if your drawing skills leave something
to be desired; you’re not resigned to painting stick
figures for the rest of your life. The following tips
are easy ways to improve your drawing and thus
add variety to your painting:
 Don’t put your subject itty-bitty within the
painting. Make it big. Think of a camera’s
zoom lens. Let it run off the edge (or even
three edges) of the page.
 Don’t settle for the typical view — look for
original and interesting perspectives.
 Read and try the examples in Chapter 9 for
composition tips.
 Draw every day.
 Take drawing workshops and classes.
 Read and do the exercises in Drawing For
Dummies (Wiley).
 Sketch the most important points that you
want in your drawing first. If you don’t want to
run out of paper at the edges, plot those items
where you want them and work inward.
 Draw, draw, and then draw some more. Okay,
you get the idea.
 Draw some odd-shaped items. Draw some-
thing unfamiliar so you draw only what you
see, not what you’re familiar with seeing. This
technique helps you focus on shapes, angles,
and relationships because you have few pre-
conceived notions about your subject. You
can sharpen these same skills by inverting
your object (drawing it upside down).
 Look at your drawing in a mirror to check 
for accuracy. Doing this reveals mistakes
because you see the drawing in a new way.
(This system also works for paintings.)

2. Get a piece of acrylic paper that measures at least 4 x 4 inches.
Any scrap works.
3. Prepare your palette.
Set up your paint by adding enough water to make the paint move and
mixing to a creamy consistency with a 1⁄4-inch flat brush. You need a
quarter-sized puddle of each color of workable paint.
4. Paint a vertical stripe of one color on the left side of your paper; stroke 
a few more slightly overlapping adjacent vertical stripes, each one
lighter as you move to the right.
Dip your flat brush into the puddle of paint so the hairs are coated
halfway up and apply the paint to the paper. Rinse the brush if neces-
sary in order to have the paint get lighter with each stripe. Figure 6-6a
shows you this sequence.
5. Rinse the brush clean in water.
6. Paint the other color in a stripe on the right side of the paper.
7. Before the two colors dry, use the flat brush to paint more stripes
toward the other color, rinsing the brush between colors to keep each
color pure.
If the paint gets too dry, add a little water to keep it blendable. If it’s too
wet on the paper, blot with a paper towel.
8. Let the two colors mix in the center by manipulating the color with
your brush (see Figure 6-6b).
What you see in the middle is the blending of the colors. In Figure 6-6b,
the two sides have blended into a purple middle.
9. Blend as smoothly as possible by stroking the flat brush through the
paint.
You may still see streaks in Figure 6-6b, but I blended these colors very
quickly. You can eliminate streaks by taking a little more time and
making more strokes till it is as smooth as possible. Another trick is to
let the first coat dry and put another coat on top so that it blends more
completely with a second layer.
Blending to create depth
One of the fun things to do in a drawing or a painting is to create the illusion
of depth. In a painting, you create depth by blending light and dark areas. You
can apply the blending technique to make a ball appear round, for example.
The light and dark areas represent the shadow and light. The shadows and
light areas have specific names: The lightest spot where light strikes the
three-dimensional object is the highlight. The darkest part of the object far-
thest from the light is the core shadow. Sometimes light bounces off near
objects and lightens it in an area called reflected light. The diagram in Figure
6-7 shows the exact placement of these art terms on a sphere. A sphere is
simply a drawn flat circle, but with the addition of blended light and shadow,
it’s transformed into a sphere. The painting surface remains flat, but it looks
round — magic!
94
Part II: Exploring Tricks and Techniques 

Follow these steps to begin blending for depth in your painting:
1. Use the same paint from the blending exercise in the previous section
and a 4-x-4-inch scrap of acrylic paper.
You also need to add white paint to your palette.
2. Paint a 3-inch circle with a pointed #6 round brush.
I used red paint in Figure 6-7.
3. Paint a dime-sized circle of white in the upper-right section of the
circle you just painted.
This white spot is the location of the highlight.
4. Rinse your brush in clear water.
5. Mix your two colors equally together on the palette and paint a 
crescent-shaped stroke around the center of the ball where the core
shadow is located.
6. Add more of the color you used to paint the initial circle in Step 2 to
the core-shadow color from Step 5 and blend paint to the bottom out-
line of the circle.
Blend following the crescent shape of the core shadow. Using a lighter
value toward the outside of the circle creates the reflected light area.
a

Figure 6-6:
Blend two
colors for a

95
Chapter 6: Drawn to Paint — Even if Your Drawing Skills Need Work

7. Add the color from Step 2 to the upper edge of the core shadow and
blend toward the highlight.
Rinse your brush as necessary to be able to blend clean colors. Blend a
smooth transition between the white in the highlight and the color
above the core shadow.
8. Paint the cast shadow.
Paint the mixed dark color (half red and half blue) for the shadow at the
farthest point from the circle. Add some white and the color from Step 2
near the circle. Make a smooth blend in the cast shadow.
9. Paint the dark at the base of the circle.
Where the circle meets the cast shadow you need a dark line crevice.
Using a #00 rigger brush, paint this small line with some of the dark
purple mix. Your circle has now become a ball or sphere. Continue to
blend paint till your figure looks three-dimensional.
See Figure 6-7 for an example of this technique.
Project: Create a Still Life
The earlier sections of this chapter give you all the art tools to paint an
apple. If you feel this subject is too easy or you want an additional challenge,
stay tuned for the extra credit at the end of this section. Note: This project
requires making base coats and color bridges on your palette, as well as glaz-
ing. If you don’t know what those techniques are (or just need a refresher),
check out Chapter 4 before beginning this project.
For this chapter’s project, I have chosen a thumbnail and made a cartoon.
You may use my cartoon to do this project. See Figure 6-8 for the cartoon and

Part II: Exploring Tricks and Techniques 

prepare your canvas as described in this chapter. Trace the cartoon, enlarge
it, and transfer it to your painting surface. When you’re finished, you may
want to do the exercise again and make your own decisions for another still
life, using another type of fruit or vegetable. Make thumbnail plans. Choose
one to enlarge and transfer it to your painting surface. Add paint to make the
objects look round. Blend different colors. You can make a whole series of
edibles and decorate your kitchen.
1. Prepare your palette with red, green, brown, yellow, blue, and white.
Make a dime-sized puddle of each color by following the project instruc-
tions in “Making a smooth transition” earlier in the chapter. Any color
pigments are fine; my pigments in Figure 6-9 are Napthol Crimson (red),
Cadmium Yellow, Titanium White, Ultramarine Blue, Permanent Green,
and Burnt Umber (brown).
2. Make some color bridges on your palette.
The bridges (described in Chapter 4) you need are red to blue, red to
white, and red to yellow.
3. Get a piece of acrylic paper measuring 5 x 7 inches and a #6 round
brush.
You use this brush throughout the project.
4. Using the #6 round brush, draw the outline of the apple.
Dip the brush into the red paint so the hairs are covered halfway. Notice
that the apple isn’t a perfect circle; you can draw (with your brush) an
apple that’s out of round or a bit bumpy and your apple will still look fine.
5. Base coat the apple red.
Base coating is described in Chapter 4. Fill in the shape of the apple with
red paint. You don’t have to worry about shading yet. See Figure 6-9a.
Figure 6-8:
Cartoon for
the apple
still life.
97
Chapter 6: Drawn to Paint — Even if Your Drawing Skills Need Work

6. Rinse.
Don’t forget to rinse your brush between colors so that your colors stay
clean.
7. On your red-blue bridge of paint, choose a purple to put on the edges
of the apple.
Blend the purple into the red. Try not to make a complete outline —
leave some areas around the top edge unshaded. See Figure 6-9b.
8. Add white on the upper-right portion of the apple to create a highlight.
Pull the white away from the light spot to blend it into the red. Rinse your
brush as needed to control the color. Use a clean damp brush to manipu-
late color and make a smooth transition of white into red. See Figure
6-9c.
9. Add some details to the apple.
It’s easier to do all the blending first before you add the details.
When the shape of the apple looks round, you’re ready to add details.
The apple has a stem end and a bottom end, which has the little center
leftover from where it was formed after it was a springtime blossom. Use
Burnt Umber to paint the stem and bottom. Notice that the stem gets
larger toward the top; the bottom of the apple is just a little dot of
brown. Add a little white to make half the stem lighter on the sunlit side.
If you want to make more details, you may want to look at a real apple
for reference. Figure 6-9d shows these added details.
10. Paint a cast shadow.
Use the purple (close to Step 7 purple) from your red-blue bridge of
paint to form a shadow resembling the shape of the apple. Figure 6-9e
adds this shadow.
11. Put reflected light in the shadow and the apple.
Shadows are transparent — you’re sort of painting air. To help with this
illusion, put a little red in the cast shadow. Rinse your brush and put a
little yellow (selected from the yellow-red bridge of paint) on the bottom
of the apple where it touches the cast shadow. Add a little water and
glaze the yellow over the dry red apple. (More on glazing in Chapter 4.)
The apple separates from the cast shadow with the addition of this
reflected light. Blend the colors till they’re smooth transitions; add
water to the paint if necessary. Figure 6-9f shows the results of adding
reflected light.
12. Finish up the details.
Put little dots like pores on the apple in a diluted yellow and pull little
lines across the body of the apple in the same color. Put a little light brown
(brown tinted with white) on the bottom brown blossom end. All done!
See Figure 6-9g.
Extra credit: Want more apple fun? Paint more apples. Arrange a still life to
paint: cut open an apple, peel an apple, take a bite out, or leave a core. Get
different colors of apples. Put the apples on different surfaces, or change or
add a background (backgrounds for still life are covered in Chapter 11). In

Figure 6-10, the same apple I painted in this project is surrounded by a
diverse group of others. Notice the reflected light from one apple to the
other. The green apple reflects a little of itself into its neighbor, as do the
yellow and red apples. Artists have enjoyed recreating this bounced light and
reflection throughout art history.

If you want to try my example, use the cartoon in Figure 6-11.
Cut fruit like apples turns brown quickly when exposed to air. Squirting
lemon juice over the exposed flesh helps prevent browning. Or take a 
photograph and work from that. Actual models are better because they give
you more information to look at, but photos last longer.

his chapter is all about color. Here I talk about popular acrylic colors,
color charts, give some interesting color histories, and provide a brief
refresher in chemistry — all of which can help familiarize you with the gor-
geous colors available to the acrylic artist.
Looking at Popular Colors
Certain colors are more popular, and many artists gravitate to them again
and again. Familiarize yourself with the colors in this section, and you’ll have
a reliable base of paints from which to build your palette.
Red
A bright, fiery, attention-getting color, red ranges from a yellowy orange to a
deep maroon. Some reds have white added to them, making them pinks and
magentas. Reds are perfect for fruits and flowers.
You can divide pure reds into two categories: red-yellows (orangey red seen
on pomegranates) and red-blues (deep, bluish red seen on plums). Some pop-
ular paints in these groups include
 Red-yellows: Cadmium Red, Pyrrole, and Napthol Red
 Red-blues: Crimson, Magenta, Alizarin Crimson, and Quinacridone Red
Figure 7-1 shows some popular reds.
Red is often a fugitive color (not lightfast), meaning it can fade. Look for the
word permanent before buying your Alizarin Crimson, or it will fade.

Orange
As you learned in school, orange is produced by mixing red and yellow. A warm
and happy color, orange is great in evening skies, desert rocks, and makes a
nice flesh tone if you dilute it. Fruit-like oranges are the colors you see on tan-
gerines and, you know, oranges. Dark oranges are more common in sunsets and
Southwest landscapes. The following list names some orange paints:
 Fruit-like oranges: Pyrrole Orange and Cadmium Orange
 Dark orange: Quinacridone Burnt Orange
Figure 7-2 gives some orange samples.
Brown
Deep down, brown is really a dark orange. Earthy browns are good for paint-
ing tree trunks and rocks and are essential in landscapes. Browns fit into
three general categories: yellow browns (coyote fur), orange/red browns (sun-
flower centers), dark browns (box of chocolates), and the Cleveland Browns
(okay, that last one doesn’t count). Common paints in these colors are
 Yellow browns: Mars Yellow and Raw Umber
 Orange/red browns: Red Oxide and Burnt Sienna
 Dark browns: Violet Oxide, Burnt Umber, and Vandyke Brown

Part III: Finding the Fun in Fundamentals 

Figure 7-3 gives you the lowdown on brown.
To make your brown even darker, add a touch of Ultramarine Blue. Equal mixes
of Ultramarine Blue and Burnt Sienna make a great black. Add water or white to
this mix for a gray very close to Payne’s Gray.
Yellow
Bright and happy, yellow is another attention-grabber. (Perhaps that’s why you
chose this book?) Look around next time you’re at the grocery store — yellow
is the most common color on packaging. You can also find it in nature: Use it
for your painted flowers, birds, butterflies, and sunshine. Because yellow is
such a light color, the differences in paint are less noticeable than some other
colors. Yellows range from lemony to orangey and typically fall into three cate-
gories: yellow-blues (spring daffodils), yellow-reds (ripe yellow peppers), and
earthy yellows (bobcat fur). The following list gives you some popular paints
associated with these categories:
 Yellow-blues: Hansa Yellow, Aureolin, and Nickel Azo
 Yellow-reds: Diarylide, Cadmium, and Bismuth
 Earthy yellows: Yellow Iron Oxide, Yellow Ochre, Naples Yellow Hue, and
Raw Sienna
Figure 7-4 illustrates some yellows.

Chapter 7: Taking a Quick Color Tour

Green
The dominant color of nature, green is a soothing, calming, cool color great
for painting grass and leaves. You can easily mix up your own green by using
blue and yellow or black and yellow. Categories of green include yellow
greens (spring leaves), bright greens (summer grass), blue greens (deep
ocean), and earthy greens (army camouflage). The following list gives you
some paint colors in each of these categories:
 Yellow greens: Green Gold
 Bright greens: Hooker’s Green, Sap Green, and Jenkins
 Blue greens: Phthalo Green, Viridian, and Cobalt Titanate Green
 Earthy greens: Terre Verte and Chromium Oxide
See Figure 7-5 for some green examples.
Greens that come straight out of the tube are often too bright and need a
little help from another color to make them look more natural. I like to add a
bit of green’s complement, red, to neutralize the color into a more natural
green.
Blue
Blue is cool and soothing. As the color of water, it’s ideal for painting lakes
and such (as well as the skies those lakes reflect). You can find two cate-
gories of blue: blue-reds (distant mountains) and blue-yellows (deep water).
This list provides common paint colors in these families:
 Blue-reds: Ultramarine Blue, Azurite, Anthraquinone Blue, Cobalt Blue,
and Cyan
 Blue-yellows: Manganese Blue, Prussian, Cobalt Teal, Cobalt Turquoise,
and Cerulean Blue
Figure 7-6 is sure to give you the blues.

106
Part III: Finding the Fun in Fundamentals 

Cerulean is a great sky color, whereas Ultramarine Blue is a perfect shadow
glaze. Be careful with the Phthalo Blue colors — they’re very potent and can
take over your painting quickly.
Violet
Violet (sometimes called purple) is the color of royalty, spirituality, mysti-
cism, and fun. It’s a good shadow color and is especially dramatic coupled
with Phthalo Green. Violets fall into three groups: light violets (pale
amethyst), purple (columbine petals), and dark purple (ripe plums). Here are
some popular violet paints:
 Light violets: Cobalt Violet and Smalt
 Purple: Quinacridone Violet
 Dark purple: Ultramarine Violet and Dioxazine Purple
Figure 7-7 displays the most common violets.
Cobalt Violet is one of the most expensive colors, but you can mix your own
beautiful violets: Try combining Magenta and Cobalt Blue.
White
Technically, white isn’t a color. It’s the simultaneous stimulation of all three
kinds of color receptors in the eye — essentially, it’s the sum of all colors.

Chapter 7: Taking a Quick Color Tour

Because you use white to lighten colors, you’ll use a lot of white paint.
Sometimes you use as much white as all the other colors combined. Here are
the two most popular whites:
 Titanium White
 Zinc White
Find six white items from the kitchen — something like an egg, a cream
pitcher, a glass salt-filled shaker, a cloth, and whatever else. Arrange them in
a still life so that some light can fall onto the subjects. Are they all the same
white? More than likely, very subtle differences in the items show up as slight
colors. Do you see a pale blue white? A yellow white? By painting this still
life, you train your eye to see much more in white.
You can also use the canvas primer acrylic gesso (described in Chapter 2) as
white in your painting.
Figure 7-8 shows you the two main whites.
Black
Black is the absence of color. When something doesn’t reflect light in any
part of the visible spectrum, it’s black. Use black paint sparingly, because it
can be harsh and look like you punched a hole in the canvas. I only use black
to darken other colors. But if you need a really dark hole, or a dark shadow
under a pot in a still life, black just may be the solution.
Black pigment is created from burning something to get the ash — for exam-
ple, Ivory Black. (That sounds oxymoronic, because ivory is white, right? The
name came from its origin: burning elephant tusks.) Ivory is expensive and
rare these days, so bone is a common substitute.
Here are black colors you’re likely to encounter:
 Mars Black
 Carbon
 Ivory/Bone
 Payne’s Gray
Figure 7-9 shows examples of black paints.
Figure 7-8:

108
Part III: Finding the Fun in Fundamentals 

Because tube blacks are so intense, a better choice is to mix your own black
to make a colorful dark. Dark opposite colors sometimes mix to make black. A
couple favorite mixes of mine are Burnt Sienna and Ultramarine Blue or
Alizarin Crimson and Phthalo Green. You can add dark purple to either of
these to make a deep black.
Deciphering Paint Descriptions
If you’ve read other parts of this book, you may have noticed that I often
name-drop different paint colors. I admit that sometimes they sound more
like something from a chemistry lab than colors. But that’s not really a bad
thing. When the name includes the chemical or mineral used to create it, the
artist has a better idea about what is contained in that color. This section
helps you figure out certain terms you may see in paint names or paint descrip-
tions so that you can have a better idea of what you’re getting to work with.
Some paints do have normal, recognizable names, such as Daffodil Yellow.
The problem with that is that a daffodil evokes different colors among differ-
ent people. More importantly, cutesy names may also indicate a lower grade
of paint.
Common chemicals
If you weren’t a chemistry major in college, some names of paint colors can
be baffling. You’ll get used to them with time and use, but to help you speed
up that process, I provide a few facts and pronunciations to get you through
the supply store. Here’s a list of some popular chemical names shared by a
number of paint colors:
 Quinacridone (kwin-ah-cre-doan): This chemical can be yellow, red,
magenta, orange, blue, violet, gold, or crimson, and it produces transpar-
ent, intensely bright colors that are some of my favorites. The Liquitex
brand has registered the name ACRA for its Quinacridone colors.
 Cadmium: Cadmium can be yellow, red, or orange.
 Phthalocyanine: This chemical can be green or blue and usually
appears in paint names as Phthalo. The Winsor & Newton brand uses the
term Winsor to indicate Phthalo colors.
 Mars: Mars is made from an artificial iron oxide. It can be orange, red,
brown, yellow, violet, or black.

Chapter 7: Taking a Quick Color Tour

Common descriptors
You often see a qualifier placed after a paint name, like Light, Medium, or
Dark. These adjectives indicate the value (lightness or darkness) of the paint.
Sometimes tubes of paint rate value on a scale of 1 to 9 from light to dark.
The word deep can also indicate a dark version of a color. You may also see
the term shade, which indicates a tendency toward another color. Usually it’s
a blue with a green shade or a green with a blue shade.
As with many art terms, shade has different meanings in different contexts.
Along with the definition here, shade also describes darkening a color by
adding black to it.
Hues
Hues are used as replacements when certain chemicals or colors are unavail-
able, too expensive, fugitive, or pose possible health hazards. These colors
have Hue after their names, such as Cadmium Medium Deep Hue.
Don’t confuse this definition of hue with the word’s more general use as a
synonym for color (as in, “The hue is red.”)
Working the Color Wheel
Colors are arranged in the order in which they appear in the spectrum of visi-
ble light. When pure white light (which contains all colors) passes through a
prism, it splits into a rainbow of colors.
The acronym ROYGBIV (pronounced Roy G. Biv, like a man’s name) helps you
remember the order of the colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet.
If you bend the spectrum into a circle, it becomes the color wheel. The color
wheel is a tool that helps you quickly determine the following:
 Which colors mix to make other colors: To make a color, simply mix the
colors that appear on either side of it on the wheel. Note: This mixing
formula doesn’t apply to primary colors, which can’t be created. See the
following section for more on primary colors.
 Which colors are complementary: No, these colors don’t tell you how
nice your hair looks today. Complementary colors appear directly across
the wheel from each other, like red and green do.
 Which colors are analogous: Analogous colors are a set of three neighbor-
ing colors on the wheel. Blue, blue-green, and green are analogous colors.
By understanding the color wheel, you can mix any color you want, whenever
you need it for your painting.
Making your own color wheel is a great exercise in exploring color, mixing
color, and creating a tool that you can use throughout your painting career.

Part III: Finding the Fun in Fundamentals 

The following sections discuss the components of a color wheel and how to
create your own.
Primary, secondary, and tertiary colors
The primary colors are the three colors from which all other colors can be made:
 Red
 Yellow
 Blue
In Figure 7-10, I place primary colors at the peaks of a triangle within a circle.
You mix secondary colors by combining two primary colors. The secondary
falls between the primaries on the wheel. These colors include
 Orange (a mix of red and yellow)
 Violet (a mix of blue and red)
 Green (a mix of yellow and blue)
Tertiary colors are made by mixing a secondary color and one of the pri-
maries adjacent to it on the color wheel. Tertiary colors are
 Yellow-orange (mixed from yellow and orange)
 Red-orange (mixed from red and orange)
 Red-violet (mixed from red and violet)
 Blue-violet (mixed from blue and violet)
 Blue-green (mixed from blue and green)
 Yellow-green (mixed from yellow and green)
Figure 7-10 shows some recommendations for primary colors that blend well
together. You can make your own versions of these color wheels if you have
the same colors. If you don’t, just experiment with the colors you have. You
may discover a secret supercolor!
Clear as mud: Using color bias to mix
colors (or mud)
Sometimes primary colors don’t mix very well to make a pure secondary
color — they make mud instead. Why? Well, to get a pure secondary, you need
pure primaries. In a perfect world, artists would have perfect primary colors,
but in the real world, a primary color often has a bit of another primary color
hidden inside it. This other color gives the primary a bias toward the hidden
color. To create a perfect color wheel in spite of this, use two versions of
each primary color, one that biases toward each of the other primaries. For
111
Chapter 7: Taking a Quick Color Tour

example, use two reds: a yellow-red and a blue-red. Figure 7-11 shows this
wheel setup.
To mix a clear, bright secondary color, use the two primaries that have each
other in them. For example, to make orange, mix the yellow-red and the red-
yellow. If you mix in the third primary (or even the primary that has the third
primary in it), the mix is muddier — that sneaky third primary creates the
mud, or mix not as pure as a properly biased combination. For example,
mixing the yellow-red and the yellow-blue creates a muddy orange. In the
“Looking at Popular Colors” section earlier in this chapter, I divide the pri-
mary colors into these bias groups.
Even though mud is typically an unwanted result, it can also make a rich
black or a nice gray that’s useful in many situations. By mixing complemen-
tary colors, you neutralize the colors to a brown or gray — mud. It all
depends on your intention. If you understand this theory of mixing color and
choosing the proper bias colors to mix, you are in control and can choose to
make clean color mixes or muddy neutrals.
Try some different combinations to make different grays. And keep your suc-
cessful formulas handy so you can re-create them when needed.
Re-create the chart in Figure 7-11 on a piece of canvas paper. First, trace
around a saucer or glass to make a quick, accurate circle. Choose colors to fit
each primary area and then mix your own secondary colors by using the
adjacent primary colors. Place a swatch of secondary color between the two
primaries that were used to mix it. Mix a tertiary color by mixing a primary
and secondary color and placing the tertiary color between them. Make more
than one color wheel to try different versions of the primary colors.

Three Color Exercises
The three exercises in this section are great, basic ways to make a painting
that concentrates on one, two, and three colors, respectively. The first two
exercises are designed to demonstrate that color has value and temperature,
and the last one lets you mix primary basic colors.
Each exercise uses the same painting but focuses on a different area or color
plan. Doing all three of the exercises makes it easy for you to compare your
work and figure out your preferences. You can even hang them in your work
area to remind you of the importance of working with value, temperature,
and color mixing.
Exploring value with monochrome: 
The one-color exercise
What’s the easiest way to eat an elephant? One bite at a time. Likewise, this
exercise lets you dip your toes into the water by painting an entire work in
one color (plus black and white).

Chapter 7: Taking a Quick Color Tour

Black and white aren’t really colors — they’re neutrals. Neutrals don’t nor-
mally lean toward any color, though some blacks and whites can subtly lean
toward a color such as a bluish white or purpley black.
This project focuses on value, which is the range of light and dark versions of
a color. And that’s where black and white come in — they help artists make
paint colors lighter and darker. Add black, and you have a shade or darker
value of a color. Add white, and you get a tint or lighter value of a color.
The old masters used this one-color painting technique a lot, often under
painting (covering the canvas with a preliminary paint layer) the entire work
in black and white. (See Chapter 4 for more on under painting.) This tech-
nique is a good way to force the artist to deal with value because colors can
trick the eye into looking at exciting color and forgetting values. The French
term for this technique is grisaille (pronounced grizz-all, meaning “gray-
ness”), but you probably know it as monochrome, which often under paints in
earth tones (such as browns and ochres) or grays.
The following steps guide you through the one-color exercise in value.
1. Trace the drawing in Figure 7-12 and transfer it onto a 5-x-7-inch piece
of canvas paper.
If you plan to do the two- and three-color exercises in the following sec-
tions, create three of these sketches now so you can skip that step later.
You can find instructions for transferring a drawing in Chapter 6.
2. Gather your supplies: a container of water, a sponge, a pointed #8
round brush, a 1⁄4-inch flat brush, a hole punch, and paint in white,
black, and a dark color.
The round brush is for painting; make sure you rinse it thoroughly
between colors. You can also use three separate brushes (one for each
color) if you prefer. Use the flat brush to mix the paint; I use Burnt
Sienna (an earthy red-brown) as my dark in this example. The hole
punch is somewhat optional; basically, you need to be able to make a
decently neat hole in Step 4.
3. Put dime-sized globs of each color on your palette and blend color
bridges between the dark color and each of the neutrals.
Chapter 4 has instructions on making color bridges. These bridges pro-
vide a full range of values for you for this project. Keep the paint wet by
occasionally misting it with a water-filled squirt bottle.
If you plan to do the one-, two-, and three-color exercises in one sitting,
think about setting up your palette in a color wheel-style triangle. Taking
this step now will make it easier for you to blend color bridges in those
later exercises.
4. Make a quick value-matching gauge by painting ten increasingly dark
values from your bridge on a 1-x-10-inch strip of canvas paper and
then punching a hole in each segment when dry.
Each value step should be a 1-inch square. Step 1 is pure white, step 5 is
pure dark color (in my case, Burnt Sienna), and step 10 is pure black.
The holes will allow you to compare your values with those in an
already-painted painting.
114
Part III: Finding the Fun in Fundamentals 

5. Using your value-matching gauge, identify the color values in Figure
7-13 and paint in the areas on your outlined canvas paper.
You can add water if you like to make the paint flow more easily, but be
careful not to change the value if the paint is too thin. If the value isn’t
right after it dries, you can go over it again in another layer to lighten or
darken as needed.
“But wait!” you say. “I’m using dark green, and Figure 7-13 is Burnt
Sienna. How will I ever match up the right values?” Never fear; focus on
the values by squinting your eyes to reduce the color to just lights and
darks. Seriously, try it — it’s surprisingly effective. Move along the gauge
till you find the closest value match.
Taking your painting’s temperature: 
The two-color exercise
In this exercise, you use two colors to demonstrate color temperature, which
is a blanket term denoting that colors can be warm or cool. Warm colors are
the colors of fire: yellow, orange, and red. Cool colors are the colors of water:
blue, green, and violet. Color temperature is an important concept because it
influences the illusion of space. Warm colors look like they advance toward
the viewer — red cars typically get tickets faster than blue ones because that
advancing quality makes them appear to be going faster. Cool colors look like
they recede into space, like the way a blue sky seems to extend farther than a
(warm) orangey sunset even though they’re the same sky.
Figure 7-12:

a drawing

115
Chapter 7: Taking a Quick Color Tour

With color temperature in mind, paint a picture by using only a warm color
(in this exercise, Burnt Sienna) and a cool color (Ultramarine Blue). The
added color gives you plenty of value choices to choose from; you can also
mix the two to make a near black.
1. Trace the drawing in Figure 7-12 and transfer it onto a 5-x-7-inch piece
of canvas paper.
If you created extras as part of the project in “Exploring value with
monochrome: The one-color exercise,” you can skip this step. You can
find instructions for transferring a drawing in Chapter 6.
2. Gather your supplies: a container of water, a sponge, a round brush, a
1⁄4-inch flat brush, and paint in white, black, and one warm and one
cool color.
The round brush is for painting; be sure to rinse it well between colors.
You can also use four separate ones (one for each color) if you prefer.
Use the flat brush to mix the paint.
3. Put dime-sized globs of each color on your palette and blend color
bridges between the warm color and each of the neutrals, the cool
color and each of the neutrals, and between the warm and cool colors.
If you tried out the one-color exercise in the previous section, you may
already have white, black, and one color on your palette, which means
you just need to add a warm or cool color (depending on what you
already have). When you mix the two colors in equal parts, you get a
near black. Though you use the tube black for making your bridges, use
this mixed black for painting your darks — it will harmonize more with
the other colors because it was created by the blending of the two. For
more on harmony, check out the next section and Chapter 8. Be sure to
mist your paint on the palette so it doesn’t dry prematurely.

116
Part III: Finding the Fun in Fundamentals 

4. Paint the areas in your drawing outline to match the colors used in
Figure 7-14, or experiment with different coloring.
This exercise is just to get you familiar with mixing colors, so any result
is fine. You may even make it better!
Harmonizing with primaries: 
The three-color exercise
You may not be able to mix your own primary colors, but if you have those
three colors, you can mix everything else. (See “Primary, secondary, and ter-
tiary colors” earlier in this chapter for more on the primary colors.)
If you completed the two-color exercise in the previous section, you may
already have two of these colors on your palette. Burnt Sienna is a red-brown.
Ultramarine Blue is definitely blue. In this exercise you add Yellow Ochre.
These colors aren’t required here — use whatever you have on hand — but
keep in mind that your final painting will look a little different if you substi-
tute. For help picking colors that work well together, refer to “Clear as mud:
Using color bias to mix colors (or mud)” earlier in this chapter.
This project is great because it forces you into a painting that’s harmonious
(all the parts work well together). More on harmony in Chapter 8.
1. Trace the drawing in Figure 7-12 and transfer it onto a 5-x-7-inch piece
of canvas paper.
If you created extras as part of the project in “Exploring value with
monochrome: The one-color exercise,” you can skip this step. You can
find instructions for transferring a drawing in Chapter 6.

2. Gather your supplies: a container of water, a sponge, a round brush, a
1⁄4-inch flat brush, a spray bottle for misting, and paint in white, black,
Burnt Sienna, Ultramarine Blue, and Yellow Ochre.
The round brush is for painting; be sure to rinse it well between colors.
You can also use five separate ones (one for each color) if you prefer.
Mix the paint with the flat brush.
3. Put dime-sized globs of all five paints on your palette and blend color
bridges between each pair of Yellow Ochre, Burnt Sienna, and
Ultramarine Blue.
You don’t need to make any bridges for the white and black; they’re just
for tinting and shading.
Chapter 4 gives you instructions on creating color bridges. These
bridges will create secondary colors: an orange between Yellow Ochre
and Burnt Sienna, a green between Ultramarine Blue and Yellow Ochre,
and a purple between Burnt Sienna and Ultramarine Blue. Because 
these particular primary colors are earthy, the mixes will not be very
bright. Mist your paint on the palette with water so that it doesn’t dry
prematurely.
4. Using the color mixes on your palette, paint the areas within your
drawing by using Figure 7-15 as a guide.
Don’t worry if your painting is a little different than the one in Figure 7-15.
This exercise is about mixing paints, so whatever you come up with is fine.
A Few More Color Plans
Having a color plan (a limited color palette) is a sure-fire way to improve your
paintings. You can use the full spectrum of colors, but it may be more difficult
Figure 7-15:
A three-
color

mixes all the

produce
color
harmony.
118
Part III: Finding the Fun in Fundamentals 

to organize everything into the design without ending up with chaos.
Another, better option, especially if you’re just beginning, is to use a limited
color plan to create a more unified whole picture. With a few limited colors
(plus black and white), you solve design problems like having too many unre-
lated colors before you even get into the painting.
Three good limited-palette color plans to start with are complementary, split
complementary, and analogous (covered in the following sections). These
aren’t the only color plans by any means — any group you think of can be a
color plan, even if it looks terrible. Because everyone has different likes and
dislikes, “good” and “bad” plans are largely a matter of taste anyway. Color
taste is also very trendy. The “avocado” scheme that people like to mock
from the ’70s is basically the same as the newer “wasabi” scheme.
The one-, two-, and three-color exercises in the previous section present
monochrome, color temperature, and mixed primary limited color plans. The
following sections give you three more limited color and one unlimited plan
(full wheel) to choose from. In each section, I painted the boat scene from
Figure 7-12 in that section’s color plan so that you can compare the results.
You can choose any of the color plans that you like to make any painting.
Complementary
A complementary color plan is a two-color palette that uses any complemen-
tary color (opposites on the color wheel) combination. Popular primary-sec-
ondary complementary combinations are red and green, yellow and violet,
and blue and orange, but you can use any opposite colors you like. Figure
7-16 illustrates this plan using orange and blue and all their mixes.
Figure 7-16:
A comple-
mentary
color plan.
119
Chapter 7: Taking a Quick Color Tour

Split complementary
In a split complementary color plan, you use one color and the adjacent 
colors on both sides of its opposite color. In Figure 7-17, I used a secondary
color (violet), and its split complement tertiary colors (yellow-orange and
yellow-green).
Figure 7-17:
A split

Part III: Finding the Fun in Fundamentals 

Analogous
An analogous color plan uses three colors that are adjacent to each other on
the color wheel. A variation on this plan is to use an analogous paint combi-
nation and just a bit of the complementary color. Figure 7-18 uses green, blue-
green, and blue. The tiny bit of orange (Burnt Sienna) is the complement for a
bit of zing (better known as contrast, discussed in Chapter 8).
Figure 7-18:

Full wheel
A full wheel color plan is exactly what it sounds like: a plan that puts the
whole color wheel at your disposal. Sometimes you just need all the colors.
Figure 7-19 utilizes the full wheel plan.
If you have trouble getting a feeling of harmony with this plan, try one of the
plans in the previous sections to create more color balance. Check out
“Harmonizing with primaries: The three-color exercise” earlier in this chapter
for more on harmony, and Chapter 9 for info on balance and composition.

Chapter 8
Design of the Times: Design
Elements and Principles
In This Chapter
 Describing the elements of design
 Exploring the principles of design
D
esign refers to the particular way an artist puts together paintings. Two
things help artists execute design: elements and principles. Elements
simply mean the building blocks — such as color, value, dots, texture, line,
shape, volume, and size — that artists use. Principles are rules and guidelines
used in producing art.
In this chapter, I define the elements of design and then discuss the most
important principles in detail. My hope is you can use these design elements
and principles to improve your own work.
Keep in mind that all the elements and principles presented in this chapter
are just words or vocabulary to help people discuss art. By using the same
terminology, artists can talk about art together and use the same words. Two
people can both be correct even if they see different things. For example, per-
haps I say a particular painting illustrates dominance of value, but you think
it’s balance of direction. We can both be right and discuss why. It’s art after
all, not math, so there isn’t just one right answer.
Elements of Design
Every good visual arts program starts with some basics: the elements of design.
The following elements are just some of the things you can use in making art:
 Color: Color is the rainbow of hues: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and
violet. It’s such a huge topic that I give it its own chapter — Chapter 7.
But very simply, color can be reduced to one word, which you may
remember from school: ROYGBIV (pronounced “Roy G. Biv”). Good old
Roy is composed of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.
You can make every other color from a combination of these.
 Value: Value is simply light and dark. Did you notice that black and white
are missing from Roy’s name in the previous bullet? That’s because they
aren’t colors; white is the reflection of all color, whereas black is the
absorption of all color.

In paint, you change a color’s value by adding white or black paint to it
(creating tints and shades, respectively). With a little practice, you can
make tons of minute, identifiable variations before the color turns essen-
tially white or black. The Cheat Sheet at the front of this book has a
handy tint and shade chart.
 Dots: Dots of every size are kind of like the atoms of art — they’re the
individual points that add up to what you see. When dots become large,
they border on becoming shape (which is another element). When you
consciously and deliberately use dots to make a picture, it’s called
pointillism or stippling (shown in Chapter 4).
 Texture: Texture is the tactile quality of a painting; after all, not all paint
dries completely flat on the canvas. Check out Chapter 11 for more on
painting with texture. Texture can be real, as in thick chunky paint, or
implied, as in having the appearance of a tactile quality yet is smooth
when touched.
 Line: Line is a series of connected points. You can paint lines with a
brush or scrape them into the paint with a tool (a technique called 
scraffito). Lines can be straight, curved, wavy, or can outline a shape as
in a contour line. Lines can be implied, as in objects that line up, or they
can be actual, as in a drawn pen line.
 Shape: Shape in art is a container that defines a space or object or the
space around the object. Shape splits into two categories: geometric
(such as circles, triangles, and squares) and organic (wriggly and free
form). Negative shape is the area surrounding the positive shape and is
just as important as the positive shape. In painting, shape is mostly two-
dimensional –– length and width. The depth is an illusion unless the
paint is really thick or you’re doing a layered collage.
 Volume: Volume (also known as depth) is the illusion that a painted
object has three dimensions. If working in sculpture, it would be actual
three-dimensional space. Chapter 11 lets you practice giving flat shapes
the illusion of volume. Similar concepts to volume you may encounter
are mass and form.
 Size: Size represents the amount of space an object takes up within a
painting. But size is relative — you have to compare and judge the size
of one object in a painting against the sizes of other objects in the work.
A marble is large when placed among peas, but small when compared to
oranges.
You can use each element of design with each principle of design (discussed
in the following section). Figure 8-1 connects each element with each principle
so you get a visual image of just how complicated design can become. The
good news is that this complexity is the reason you can always find a solution
to your design problems. You may think that someone has surely found all the
solutions given all the artists and works that have come before you, but rest
assured that the solutions are almost infinite. You, too, can find your own solu-
tions to artistic challenges with nothing but simple elements and principles.
Try using one principle and one element at a time — don’t feel obligated to
throw everything into one painting from the get-go. Each time you paint,
focus on improving one thing. Pretty soon, you’ll be ready for a famous
gallery (or at least the art show at the state fair).
124
Part III: Finding the Fun in Fundamentals 

The Principle of Balance
Balance is the arrangement of elements so as not to overpower an area with a
heavy feeling. It comes in two varieties: symmetrical/formal and asymmetri-
cal/informal. Symmetrical or formal balance means that each half of a painting
is the same; if you drew an imaginary line down the center, each side would
have the same parts. Asymmetrical or informal balance isn’t so strict, which is
why it’s often more attractive in art. With asymmetrical balance, one big
thing on one side can balance several little things on the other side. Most
paintings utilize informal or asymmetrical balance because it’s less obvious
and predictable and, therefore, more visually pleasing.
When you’re dealing with balance, in art or otherwise, you have to keep
weight in mind. In an art context, weight refers to how much attention an ele-
ment commands. Just as several smaller kids balance one bigger kid on a
teeter-totter, “weightier” objects in a painting require more, “less weighty”
objects to balance them out. The following sections detail how to balance
weighty and less-weighty versions of each element.
Balancing color
Some colors weigh more than others. In general, darker colors weigh more
than lighter colors, so you want to offset smaller amounts of dark color with
larger amounts of light color. For example, red is a huge attention-grabber —
it weighs more than a light color like yellow does. You’d want to balance a
small bit of red with a bigger area of yellow. Also keep in mind that an iso-
lated color stands out, so weave the colors throughout the entire artwork. I
play with color balance in Figure 8-2.

Balancing value
In Figure 8-3, I use black, white, and gray to show the effects of balancing
value. Dark values weigh more than light values, so here I use more white
than black. See Chapter 7 for more on value.
Balancing dots
Dots are weightier than empty space, so work to balance dots with empty
space. Figure 8-4 balances dot patterns.
Balancing texture
Rough texture is weightier than smooth texture; you want to be sure to bal-
ance out any added texture with smooth areas. In Figure 8-5, I created texture
by applying the paint with a palette knife and using scraping and scraffito.

Balancing line
Lines that move (squiggle, curve, wave, and so on) weigh more than straight
lines, so you need more straight lines to balance with wavy ones. Check out
line balance in Figure 8-6.

Chapter 8: Design of the Times: Design Elements and Principles

Balancing shape
Positive shape and negative shape can be balanced. Positive shapes are heav-
ier, but the surrounding area (negative shape) has weight too. Don’t neglect
negative shape; it’s just as important as positive shape. In Figure 8-7, I bal-
ance negative shape (the black area surrounding the bottles) with positive
shape (the white bottles). I leave all these shapes flat and graphic because
adding dimension would introduce another element (volume).
Balancing size
As is typically true in life, large size weighs more than small size visually. You
can achieve this balance by offsetting one big item with several small items.
Figure 8-8 shows an example of size balance.

Part III: Finding the Fun in Fundamentals 

Balancing volume
Objects with dimension weigh more than flat objects. In Figure 8-9, some of
the circles appear to have volume because I give them shadows to make them
look like spheres. However, I leave more circles flat to help balance that effect.
Play with elements and balance on your own. Pick an element and create a
painting that focuses on balancing that element. After you’ve mastered bal-
ancing all the single elements, challenge yourself by trying to balance multi-
ple elements in one painting. It’s even possible that you may disagree with
one of my examples. Try to improve upon it –– you have my blessing. You can
even make paintings that don’t balance. Then you’re working with “discord.”
Nothing wrong with that either; it’s just a way of sending another message.
The Principle of Contrast
Contrast is abrupt, significant change like jumping from black to white.
Contrast is best used sparingly — it demands attention, so save it for the
most important area in your painting. The following figures show the eight
elements by using the principle of contrast.
Contrasting color
One way to show contrast is through color. For example, red is often a great
attention-getter in paintings (which may be why most painted cowboys wear
red bandannas around their necks). Artistically, red is a great tool for draw-
ing attention to an area. Figure 8-10 uses red to contrast the white, black, and
gray background.
Figure 8-9:

129
Chapter 8: Design of the Times: Design Elements and Principles

Contrasting value
Value contrast is one of the most popular combinations for a painting.
Imagine a bright window letting sun into a dark room. That’s value contrast.
The background in Figure 8-11 is pretty dark, so the one light spot immedi-
ately draws your attention, creating a center of interest.
A general rule says that a painting’s center of interest is almost always the
lightest item placed next to the darkest item — in other words, the area of
greatest contrast. If you place this pinnacle of contrast somewhere other
than your intended center of interest, you may create two areas of attention.
If that’s what you’re going for, great. Generally speaking, however, your works
turn out better if you don’t divide attention too much, so change the location
of your most contrasted values to the center of interest as necessary so you
have one star of the show.

Contrasting shape
Figure 8-12 shows contrast on a couple of levels. First, the roundness of the
dots stands out against the straight background. Also, because some of the
dots are big enough to become circles, you see a contrast in shape.
Contrasting texture
Figure 8-13 has texture that jumps out as contrast to the soft, graduated back-
ground. It also has a bit of color contrast, too, with the hint of turquoise in
the texture contrast area.
Contrasting lines
Figure 8-14 is similar to Figure 8-12. Straight lines contrast against soft, undu-
lating clouds. Bonus points if you noticed the value contrast as well.

Contrasting size
Figure 8-15 shows how size can create contrast. The one big square jumps
out against the sea of small rectangles.
Contrasting volume
Figure 8-16 contrasts volume. When all the shapes are flat, the one with mass
and volume stands out in contrast.

ments. Follow the abstract examples I provide, only apply the principles and
elements to real objects in landscapes or still lifes. Choose your favorite

The Principles of Repetition, 
Alternation, and Variation
Repetition itself is pretty self-explanatory — you take an element and repeat
it. Here I focus on the offshoots of repetition: alternation and variation.
In alternation, the element is repeated but takes turns (alternates) with some-
thing else. For example, a pattern in fabric may be flower, leaf, flower, leaf,
and so on. In fine art, a great way to make interesting paintings is to alternate
value. That means using dark, light, dark, light — like a chessboard, except
with shapes. Look for interesting juxtapositions to put alternating values of
dark and light.
For example, look at Figure 8-17. Instead of the tree having one solid value, as
it may be in real life, the trunk is dark against the light foreground and then
light against the dark barn. When the branches hit the light sky, they’re dark.
This tree illustrates alternation of value.
Fences, ducks, telephone poles, houses, and wires can use the same alterna-
tion of value for interest. Save the lightest light and the darkest dark for the
center of interest. In this case, the duck presents a double whammy as the
center of interest. First, it’s the lightest object in the painting. Second, one living
thing in a painting — whether an animal, person, or just a face — attracts atten-
tion. People like to see other things that look back at them. Adding the darker
value for eyes and shadow guarantees that the duck is the center of interest.
Try painting a scene like Figure 8-17, using color but retaining the values.
Variation or variety is the spice of life, and that goes for art, too. In fact, vari-
ety is everything. So shake up your elements and principles when you repeat
them to avoid monotony. If you use blue, change it to dark blue and then to
light blue. If you have a row of trees, make some thick and some thin. Vary
their spacing. And for Pete’s sake, make them different heights.

dimensional

Chapter 8: Design of the Times: Design Elements and Principles

The Principle of Direction
Direction can also be called movement. It is the way that the eye moves
through the painting. You can use direction in a single line or in the entire art-
work. For example, the whole background may have a diagonal direction,
giving the entire painting an exciting thrust. The direction of the painting is
the perceived feeling of action.
The general direction of a painting comes down to three choices:
 Horizontal: The overall effect of horizontal paintings is a calm feeling. I
suspect it reminds people of lying down and taking a nap. The word hori-
zontal comes from, of course, horizon — so landscapes are often hori-
zontal. Figure 8-18 shows a simple horizontal-direction painting. All the
colors and lines go in the horizontal direction.

Part III: Finding the Fun in Fundamentals 

 Vertical: Dare I say vertical paintings are uplifting? Portraits and still lifes
are often vertical formats. Vertical paintings, such as the one in Figure
8-19, do create a feeling of formality, substance, and rigidity. Of course,
that all depends on how the elements within the painting are delivered.
 Diagonal: Slanted paintings are supposed to evoke excitement and
throw the viewer a little off balance (in a good way). Of course, the suc-
cess of this goal is partly determined by the execution of the style, too.
Diagonal is my personal favorite painting direction; Figure 8-20 has all
diagonal direction lines. Any painting can have a diagonal direction by
the way you place the elements. I like to place colors in the background
to create a diagonal movement for a little more interest.
Figure 8-20:
A diagonal
direction.

A vertical

135
Chapter 8: Design of the Times: Design Elements and Principles

Direction of texture
Figure 8-21 combines texture and direction and pulls diagonally. While the
paint was wet, I took a paper towel and quickly pulled the corners through
the paint in a fanning motion to produce the texture. Fanning in the way you
want the paint to go creates the directional line.
Try this technique for yourself:
1. Get a paper towel and fold it in quarters.
2. Twist the center to make a handle allowing the corners and edges to
be free.
3. Use a flat brush to quickly place three colors of acrylic paint in stripes
to cover the entire surface.
4. Rinse the brush or leave in water to clean at the end of your painting
session.
5. Before the paint dries, hold the paper towel by the twisted handle and
pull the ends of the paper towel through the paint in a flicking, fan-
ning motion, like you were dusting furniture.
You will pull the paint in the direction that you pull the paper towel.
Stop and let the paint dry when you are satisfied with the amount of
spontaneous movement.
You can do this technique to realistic subjects too. It looks like glints of light
bouncing around.
Direction using lines
Figure 8-22 uses wavy and straight lines in a horizontal direction with a sunny
yellow color — and seems not to follow the calm horizontal feeling. It gives a
very different feeling than Figure 8-18, which is also horizontal line and shape.
The wavy lines and sunny color add excitement, which goes to show that any
rule can be broken in art (but always know a rule before you break it).

Part III: Finding the Fun in Fundamentals 

Direction using shapes
Figure 8-23 uses shapes to create a diagonal direction by placing the shapes
in that slanted space from corner to corner. A viewer naturally wants to orga-
nize like objects and “sees” a line and direction.
The Principles of Emphasis 
and Subordination
Dominance, or emphasis, and subordination are opposites describing what you
choose to focus and not focus on in your painting; you put emphasis on what-
ever feature you want to be dominant, and you subordinate the stuff you want to
give less attention. Any work of art should have at least one dominant object —
a center of interest. If all the elements have the exact same emphasis, you have
something like wallpaper, gift wrap, or patterned fabric, which is probably not
what you were shooting for. Everything else in the painting should point the
viewer toward that emphasized area. Think of a movie: The focus is on the main
character, and all of the supporting characters help move her story forward.

Dominance of color temperature
Figure 8-24 uses warm color emphasis, with bits of subordinate cool blue.

Dominance of value
In Figure 8-25, light value is emphasized while dark is subordinate.
Dominance of dots
Figure 8-26 has an emphasis on dots as they grow into circle shapes, moving
in a dominant diagonal direction. The eye-catching red colored dots com-
mand even more attention.

Dominance of texture
I emphasize implied texture in Figure 8-27 by using a dry brush to paint a
rough pattern around the circles. Texture is the dominant element because
there’s more texture than shape.
Dominance of line
Figure 8-28 uses line as the dominant element by repeating the lines in different
directions. The lines also exhibit variety because of their different thicknesses.

139
Chapter 8: Design of the Times: Design Elements and Principles

Dominance of shape
In Figure 8-29, rectangular shapes are the dominant element because no other
shapes compete here. The light blue squares are subordinate because the
rectangles overlap the squares, which makes them seem like they are in front
or dominant. The small dark square is perhaps the most dominant feature
because its dark value contrasts the nearby light value. Check out “The
Principle of Contrast” earlier in this chapter for more on contrast.
Dominance using size
In Figure 8-30 the size of the undulating red shape is dominant. As with the
dots in Figure 8-26, the red coloring here contributes to the dominance.

Putting the Pieces Together:
Composition
In This Chapter
 Choosing and placing your focal point
 Tailoring design elements to improve composition
 Keeping an eye on composition even after you’re done planning
C
omposition is the act of taking all the parts and pieces of design and
putting them together to form a whole artwork. (See Chapter 8 for more
on design). The goal is to group and organize the elements of art to create
unified paintings that communicate what you want to say.
When it comes to composition, there are some rules you should generally
adhere to, and this chapter is where I discuss those guidelines to help you
make the best paintings you can. If you follow my advice here and work
through the suggestions in this chapter, you’ll definitely create better paint-
ings compositionally.
Way too often, artists only use composition as a way to critique a painting
when it’s finished (and yes, that works well), but the best time to use compo-
sition is in the planning stages to create a well-designed product.
First Things First: Intention 
and Placement
Before you begin to paint, you need an idea. What is the main point of your
painting? It can be something intangible, psychological, and deep, or, say, a
simple exploration of nature through a landscape. You’re free to choose to be
as simple or complex as you like. Whatever you envision for your painting,
you can rely on the effectiveness of certain composition aspects that the his-
tory of art has proven over and over again to be very helpful.
If you feel overwhelmed by trying to create something that’s never been done
before — how can you possibly do it when everything has been done many
times? — just remember that it hasn’t been done by you. You bring something
unique to the subject — yes, YOU! Every person approaches the same sub-
ject differently, which is why art can never be exhausted.

Determining and placing the focal point
After you decide on your subject matter, narrow it down to the one main
object that you want as the focal point, or center of interest — an unfortunate
term because you should not put your focal point in the physical center of
the painting. The focal point should go somewhere besides the center,
because it’s just more interesting to the human eye that way. Art likes the
unequal in everything, which is why one of its principles is variation. (Check
out Chapter 8 for more on variation and other art principles.)
Following the Rule of Thirds
Renaissance painters used what they called the Golden Ratio for proper
placement of the center of interest. Precise use of the Golden Ratio involves
more math than you probably signed up for, so I don’t get into that here. The
modern approximation of it — the Rule of Thirds — is likely more useful. In
short, here’s how it works:
1. Decide first on the outside shape of the painting: rectangular landscape
(horizontal), rectangular portrait (vertical), or some other shape.
This landscape and portrait terminology doesn’t reflect any sort of
requirement about how you paint those kinds of paintings. In this con-
text, the words refer to the direction and not the painting type. You can
paint landscapes and portraits in any orientation you want.
2. Draw lines equally dividing the surface into thirds horizontally and
vertically (like a tick-tack-toe board).
You end up with nine equally sized blocks.
3. Pick one of the four intersections of the lines; these are the four per-
fect spots visually to place your focal point.
Figure 9-1 shows a landscape-oriented picture divided into thirds, and the cir-
cles show the possibilities for focal point placement.
Figure 9-1:
The rule of
thirds gives
you four
choices of
placement
for your
focal point.
144
Part III: Finding the Fun in Fundamentals 

Putting your focal point to work
You’re not quite done yet — your focal point needs to do a few more things
besides just be in the right place. You should orchestrate the picture so that
the focal point or center of interest possesses one or more of the following
properties:
 It puts the lightest light value right next to the darkest dark value.
 It has the most detail — the cleanest, strongest, sharpest edges.
 It has the brightest, most intense color.
 It contains the largest shape.
 It has the most contrast.
The items in the picture other than the focal point should all support it.
Everything should point somehow to this area, using such tricks as direc-
tional lines, gradation changes, increasing detail, and increasing contrast
(these are all elements of design found in Chapter 8). Why only one focal
point? Including more than one area of contrast, for example, sets up conflict
for the viewer regarding which is more important. You want the composition
to make a smooth, satisfying path for the eye to travel. The focal point is the
eye’s destination and payoff.
In Figure 9-2, the focal point is the closest horse to the viewer. How can you
tell? It’s located in the bottom third (not the center) in this vertical format,
and it’s larger than the other two horses. Plus, the land masses and reflec-
tions point directional lines to that particular horse.
Figure 9-2:
The biggest
horse is the
focal point.
145
Chapter 9: Putting the Pieces Together: Composition

Give ’em room
Sometimes blank space is just as important as space filled with lines, shapes,
and colors. If the focal point is very busy, the eye needs a resting place in the
picture. Leave some blank areas (in interesting shapes, of course) for a rest-
ing place.
Another space consideration: If you have living things like people, animals,
and birds in your painting, don’t place them close to the edge of the picture,
especially if they’re facing that edge — they look like they’re ready to leave.
Compositionally, your eye follows where the live subject is going, and you
may just keep on going to the next picture in the gallery. Arrange your com-
position so that you keep the viewer looking at your picture.
In Figure 9-3a the profile (side view) of the face is placed too close to the edge
of the picture. It feels as if the person doesn’t have enough room to breathe.
Figure 9-3b shifts the face, giving it more room.
Off-setting the horizon
Similar to the placement of the focal point, don’t put the horizon line in the
center of the picture. Putting a horizon in the middle cuts the picture in half and
sets up two equal areas of space, which is less visually interesting. Figure 9-4a
shows a landscape with the sky and land approximately the same size because
the horizon is in the center. By moving the horizon as shown in Figure 9-4b, the
areas are different sizes and therefore less monotonous and more interesting.
Setting the mood
Another important part of the composition plan is choosing and executing
the mood of the painting. Look at other paintings. Go to a gallery or museum

146
Part III: Finding the Fun in Fundamentals 

or look through an art book. Which artworks make you feel something? How
did the artists evoke that emotion? Creating a mood properly can take a plain
painting and elevate it to a higher level.
You can set mood through subject and color temperature and/or value. Warm
colors and light values are happy, exciting, and uplifting; cool colors and dark
values are somber, thought-provoking, and calm. If you’re painting a rain
storm, you choose darks and grays, with maybe a little contrast in the form of
something like a yellow raincoat at the focal point. (I discuss color in Chapter 7
and value in Chapter 8.)
Figure 9-5 uses somber, dark, less-intense colors to create a calm mood. The
contrast of the bright sun peeking through the trees is an immediate attention
grabber for the focal point.

Chapter 9: Putting the Pieces Together: Composition

Create some mood paintings. Make a happy, positive mood painting; a sad,
somber painting; and an angry, aggressive painting. Use whatever elements,
shapes, colors, size, lines, or values you think will achieve your goal. When
you finish, show them to someone else to see if they can guess what mood
you were trying to communicate.
Less is more
When creating a painting, look at all the bits you’re putting in. Does every-
thing have a purpose? Does everything support the focal point? Or are cer-
tain things pretty much clutter? If clutter is the answer, fix it. Leave some
things out. Make sure the supporting cast in the picture isn’t upstaging the
star (the focal point). See Figure 9-6 for an example of a cluttered picture that
was simplified.
You’re not bound to reality or to some reference photograph — if something
doesn’t enhance the main idea of your painting, you can leave it out, even if it
“should” be there.
More Composition Guidelines
Aside from the fundamental rules of composition (discussed in the previous
section), artists, critics, and art teachers have formulated a bunch of other
composition rules based on what they’ve discovered works best. In this 
section I share some of these rules.
Throughout this book, I stress that you don’t have to be bound by the so-
called rules of art, and that’s true here as well. However, getting away with
breaking composition rules takes really strong composition skills — the art
police aren’t going to put you in cuffs if you don’t follow these suggestions,
but I’ve included them here to help you make better paintings, so don’t cast
them off without knowing them. Just because you don’t have to wear a para-
chute when you jump out of a plane doesn’t mean you shouldn’t go ahead
and strap on that pack.

Part III: Finding the Fun in Fundamentals 

Going with odd numbers
When choosing how many items to put in your painting, choose odd numbers
rather than even numbers. Even numbers can confuse the viewer, giving
them an equal choice as to which one to look at. Make one item the star and
the others costars. Think of a still life, for example — your best bet is to
include three or five items. One item is probably a little sparse, two or four
divide the attention, and many more than five become busy.
Of course, every rule has its exceptions. Sometimes objects can group
together to form one shape, making them seem like one object. Overlapping
shapes is a good way to form a new shape — they look more like one thing,
so you can count it as an odd number.
Figure 9-7a shows two gulls as the subjects. The composition would be
improved by adding a third gull (Figure 9-7b).
Avoiding tangents
Avoid lining up two items exactly so that they’re tangent to each other (their
shapes touch). Allowing outlines of two different shapes in a painting to
touch like that makes it difficult to interpret what is going on. A better com-
position is to have the items overlap (especially good for creating depth) or
to put a space between them. Look carefully at the spaces between items;
you want to have spaces of varying widths. If you want items to relate to one
another, have them face each other as if they’re having a conversation (even
if they’re inanimate objects — what, you never played with sock puppets?)
To improve the composition of Figure 9-7a (in the previous section), which
shows two touching pylons, I separated the pylons in Figure 9-7b.

Chapter 9: Putting the Pieces Together: Composition

Varying your edges to create depth and 
to help the focal point stand out
Shapes are contained by three basic types of edges:
 Hard, crisp edges
 Soft, slightly blurred edges
 Lost edges
Use these three kinds of edges to your advantage. Hard edges are good for
detail and focal point areas. Soft edges are good for creating depth and space,
because they make the object seem a little farther away. Lost edges create
mystery. You know the edge exists, but it’s not defined at all in the painting
and is therefore lost, usually in an adjacent shape. You shouldn’t spoon feed
all the details of everything to the viewer; they should have to get more
involved to know where edges are. (Check out Chapter 10 for more on edges.)
Figure 9-8 shows a portrait that uses all three types of edges to make the
focal point — the face — stand out. The sharpest edges and most details are
therefore in the face. I used soft edges in the hat and dress, and lost edges
above the hands where the body meets the background.
Figure 9-8:
Three kinds

and lost.

Part III: Finding the Fun in Fundamentals 

Keeping light and shadows consistent
Determine one main light source in your painting and know where it’s coming
from. All shadows should be headed in approximately the same direction, away
from that one light source, as shown in Figure 9-9. Obviously the light source is
the sun (or moon) for a landscape, but it may be a light bulb for a still life.
If you’re working from multiple reference photographs, check to see where
the shadows fall in each one. If they’re different, be sure to adjust them
accordingly so your shadows are consistent.
Check Yourself: Analyzing and
Revamping Your Composition
Here are some ideas to examine your composition to see whether it’s right in
the planning stage of your painting.
Thinking, planning, sketching, and then painting, in that order, yield better
compositions and much better paintings. Taking the time upfront before
applying any paint is always worth it.
Keying the painting
A key is a general tendency or emphasis toward something, usually value or
color. A light-value painting is a high-key painting (see Figure 9-10a), whereas
a predominantly dark-value painting is a low-key painting (see Figure 9-10b). 
A few keys you want to be sure to establish are as follows:
Figure 9-9:
Consistent
shadows

151
Chapter 9: Putting the Pieces Together: Composition

 A dominant value key will give the painting an eye path and interest.
 A dominant color key will give the painting focus.
 A dominant temperature key will help set the mood. Choose either
warm or cool to be the overall temperature and then have a little of the
opposite in the center of interest area. (I discuss color temperature in
detail in Chapter 7.)
Thinking in threes
Think in threes (and note that three is an odd number). For example, three
areas of importance: big, medium, and small. Dividing your composition into
three sizes can provide the variety that makes the picture sing. You can divide
any of the elements into these three sizes: color, texture, and especially value
work well in three different proportions. Divide the areas of values into three:
light, medium, and dark. Make sure that the area each one fills is also differ-
ent. Make one two-thirds of the picture, one one-third, and the last one just a
little bit (in the center of interest). That bit of variety does wonders for making
a composition interesting.
Figure 9-11a is an outline of the color photograph in Figure 9-11c. In Figure
9-11b, I use three values (light, medium, and dark) in three sizes (small,
medium, and large). As always, variety of value and sizes of shapes makes a
more interesting composition.
Try breaking up areas of value into three proportional sizes: large area of
light, middle size of medium value, and a small amount of dark for punch.
1. Make an outline drawing.
You may copy Figure 9-11a or make your own drawing.

Part III: Finding the Fun in Fundamentals 

I even use my computer to make thumbnail duplicates so I can experi-
ment with different value choices. The press of a button on my printer
reproduces reduced thumbnail outlines, from four to twelve to a page. If
you don’t have such technology, just copy the outline with tracing
paper.
2. Take three markers with three different values, and color in areas till
you like the plan.
The three-value system of sketching is a great way to practice and plan
paintings. It also trains your eye to see values. Each value should be
divided into different proportions: In Figure 9-11b, the light area is the
largest, followed by middle value and a small amount of dark. You can
follow my lead or change the order.
3. Make another study in color.
See if you can follow your value study, using colors that have the same
values. Squint a lot to check your values (see the nearby sidebar “Tricks
for reducing color to values”).

Chapter 9: Putting the Pieces Together: Composition
Tricks for reducing color to values
In a world awash with color, you may have trou-
ble reducing those colors to values. Here’s a trick
to help you see values: Squint. Squint your eyes till
you tune out the color and see only darks and
lights. Look at your paintings and squint to see
whether you have enough values and whether the
values make a pattern. The pattern should lead
your eye around the composition.
Another trick to isolate values is to use red
acetate, a kind of film. You look through red film to
see values in your paintings because red filters
out the other colors and allows you to see only
dark and light. Then you can simplify the areas of
value into interesting shapes. Print shops often
sell rubylith, a red film that blocks light for making
printing plates. Photographers also use red lights
and film. A graphic arts supplier may have such
film, or you can try a transparent red folder from
an office supply store.

Cropping
Cropping is the process of removing unnecessary elements from a picture.
You can crop in the planning stage or the finished product stage. L-shaped
cropping tools help plan a drawing. Hold up your hands, make letter Ls with
your index fingers and thumbs (your right hand makes it backwards), and put
them together to make a square. In this way you can crop elements out of a
scene or a painting with your hands. Moving the square closer to your eyes
enlarges the view. When shopping for a painting subject, use these Ls to iso-
late the subject from the clutter.
You can also use cropping on a final painting. If the painting yielded some-
thing you don’t like, crop it out. Sometimes a painting has too many things
going on in it — improve it by cropping it down into just the good elements
that work. One big unsuccessful painting may become three little successful
paintings.
Find an interesting photograph in a magazine. Use your hands as a cropping
tool to find several abstract compositions within the photograph. You may
like one well enough to use it as a painting inspiration.
Implosion and other shapes
A painting’s overall composition should take on a general shape, usually cre-
ated by your placement of the elements, values, and color patterns.
Imagine an explosion. All the lines radiate away from the center. That would
not be a good composition shape for a painting because all the lines lead the
eye out of the picture. A better plan is an implosion: a swirl directing the eye
inward till it reaches the focal point. Other general shapes that work well for
composition patterns: the cruciform or T, the S or Z shape (depending on
which way it’s facing), C, O, X (without something directly in the center), U,
and L shapes. A triangle is also a great compositional pattern. As if those
options weren’t enough, you can reverse and flip the shapes for even more
possibilities. Figure 9-12 illustrates some composition patterns.
Take the composition examples in Figure 9-12 and apply them to some of
your painting ideas. Sketch the compositions on paper. Try using light,
medium, and dark values in the proper proportions (small, medium, and
large shapes) to plan interesting compositions. Think about which elements
capture specific feelings. Make value and color patterns to direct the eye’s
path. Figure 9-13 shows some of my paintings that use the compositional
letter patterns C, S, L, and an upside-down U.

Part III: Finding the Fun in Fundamentals 

Unity: A final checklist
The ultimate question: Does the painting hold together? Do the four quarters
of the painting look like they belong together? If not, what is missing? Can it be
added? Look at the principles and elements as individual criteria. For example,
is everything in balance? Does something feel out of place? You have looked 
at millions of images throughout your life, so you can’t help but have a great
intuition when you look at images now. You know when something is wrong. Go
through some of the elements and principles and suggestions in this chapter
and Chapter 8 to critique and analyze your painting and its composition.
Here’s a quick critique checklist:
 Does the painting have a center of interest?
 Is anything too centered?
 Does the painting have odd or even subject numbers?
 Is there an interesting eye path? Value pattern? Colors?
 Is there enough variety? Of edges? Values?
 Does the painting communicate? Ideas? Mood?
 Are the shadows consistent with the light source?
 Are there any “eye traps” created by tangents?
 Do you like it? I hope the answer is “YES”!

A
crylic paint, when thinned enough, can look and act like watercolor
paint, a water-soluble paint that rehydrates when you get it wet. Because
it’s so thin, it lies absolutely flat on paper. Watercolor is identifiable by its
transparent glow from the white surface, juicy washes, and mingling colors.
So why not just use watercolor paint if you want a watercolor look? Well,
even though acrylic and watercolor can look alike, acrylic offers some advan-
tages that go beyond what watercolor is capable of doing:
 Acrylic paint allows you to use white paint. Transparent watercolor
doesn’t use white paint — you leave empty space on the white paper
when you want that color, which means you have to carefully plan which
areas of white space to save. Acrylics offer white paint, which gives you
more planning options
 Acrylic additives can give you more time to work with the paint. Both
watercolor and acrylic dry quickly. Acrylics, though, have products that
extend the open time (window in which you can work the paint), such 
as retarder and acrylic glazing liquid. Check out Chapter 3 for more on
additives.
 Acrylic mistakes are easier to correct. When watercolor is dry, you may
be able to lift (erase) or move the paint by applying water to make cor-
rections, though that may cause running and lead to additional mistakes
if you’re not careful. With acrylic, you can just paint over the top.
 Acrylic paint is more reliable for painting layers. Painting layers in
watercolor may make layers beneath blur or run. After acrylic dries,
however, it doesn’t move. You can paint on top of a dry layer of acrylic
paint and if you don’t like the result, simply wipe it off before it dries.

Allowing your acrylic paint to run and flow where it wants can be fun, chal-
lenging, and rewarding. In this chapter, I give you several techniques to help
you achieve a watercolor look with acrylic paint, plus a landscape project
that puts them all together. This chapter focuses on landscape painting, but
you can use many of the techniques I discuss in other types of paintings as
well. (Note: Throughout this chapter, I’m talking about fluid acrylic paint, the
kind that comes in bottles. You can use acrylic paint that comes in tubes or
jars and thin the paint with water or acrylic medium. I provide a complete
description of mediums in Chapter 3.) I like the paint to be the consistency of
cream for these techniques.
Born to Run: Thinning Acrylic 
to be Like Watercolor
Before you can paint acrylics like watercolors, you have to thin your acrylic
paints to a watercolor consistency. It’s a pretty easy process:
1. Squirt a nickel-sized puddle of fluid acrylic paint (in the color of your
choice) on your palette.
2. Squirt a nickel-sized dollop of acrylic medium near the paint on your
palette.
Acrylic medium is colorless paint (with the same molecular structure as
regular paint) used to thin paint. You can also use water; just have a cup
of it handy.
3. Using a brush, mix the paint and the medium (or water) together till
the mixture is a creamy consistency.
Add water or medium by dipping the brush into the liquid and adding it
to the paint. Swirl the paint and liquid together till the paint becomes
the consistency of cream. If you dilute thick paint it may take several
brush loads of water/medium. Fluid acrylic may be thin enough so as to
need no water/medium.
The following exercise gets the paint flowing. You can let the paint dry between
colors or let the colors flow together by applying them all when wet. In fact, try
both wet and dry techniques to see what happens. The surface (canvas paper)
can be wet or dry. To make it wet, simply use a flat brush to apply clear water
to it, making a damp (no puddles) surface. When you apply paint to a wet sur-
face, it escapes into the water. It travels into the wet area and leaves exciting
edges and unexpected textures. It may feel out of control, but that’s part of the
fun. Let the water do the work and see what happens. When you apply paint on
a dry surface, it will stay where you place it. This is a good way to do details.
Here’s how to play around with thinning acrylic paint to see how it works 
for you:
1. Get a 6-inch square piece of acrylic paper.
2. Prepare your palette by thinning paint as described earlier in this 
section.
I chose four different colors for this exercise.
160
Part IV: Acrylic’s Versatile Styles 

3. Use a 1⁄4-inch flat brush to apply some paint to the top edge of the
paper. Dip the brush in the thin paint so that the hairs are covered
halfway and paint a stripe from edge to edge at the top.
4. Tip the paper vertically and let the paint run down, misting it with
water as necessary (see Figure 10-1a), and let dry when you’re satisfied.
5. Rinse the brush in clear water.
6. Rotate the paper one quarter of a turn and repeat Steps 3 through 5
with another color of paint (see Figure 10-1b).
7. Keep rotating and repeating Steps 3 through 5 until you’ve done all
four sides (see Figure 10-1c).
Feel free to play around with this exercise until you have a good feel for how
much water or medium you need to thin the paint to achieve the kind of
results you want.
The Sky’s the Limit: Painting 
Translucent Skies
Clouds, rain, and sky are perfect painting subjects for a watercolor technique.
Less is more when painting sky. A background of blue with a sweep of white
paint into the damp blue background produces the look of clouds and sky
with little effort. You can paint a rainy sky quickly by applying a stripe of gray
paint on a predampened surface and allowing the paint to “rain” by tipping
the surface to allow gravity to pull the paint down into the water.
Watercolor technique lets the water do the work. Let it flow, and don’t be
afraid to lose a bit of control.
The logical way to paint a landscape is to work from back to front: You paint
the things that are farthest away first — that way you can paint over the top
of that layer instead of having to be careful and paint around things. Using
watercolor forces planning to save the white space on the paper for clouds,
but acrylic can achieve the look by painting over the blue sky with white
paint, saving you time.
With that in mind, the first place to start, naturally, is the background, because
it’s farthest away. In a landscape, that is usually the sky. Almost anything else

Chapter 10: Letting It Flow: Creating a Watercolor-like Landscape

in your landscape (mountains, trees, fields, buildings, water, and so on) is
bound to be closer than the outer atmosphere. So if you want a background
of one plain color, such as a blue sky, paint it first and then paint clouds on
top of it.
Riding off into the sunset
Thin layers of paint can simulate the real layers of color and air in a sunset.
Because the paint is transparent, the white surface peeks through from
underneath the paint and helps create the illusion of the glow.
In the following exercise, you can experiment with painting a multicolored
sky, such as a sunset.
Note: Even though you’d usually paint a sunset with your paper in horizontal
(landscape) orientation, do this project with the paper in vertical (portrait)
orientation, with the paper propped up off the table so the colors can flow
down easily. (Check out the preceding section for more on tilting the paper to
promote running.) After it’s dry, you turn the paper back horizontally, and
the flow becomes the layers of color in the sunset.
The following instructions show you how to use thinned acrylic paint to
make a watercolor-esque sky.
1. Arrange a 5-x-7-inch piece of canvas paper at a slight incline on your
table (propped against something about as thick as a deck of cards) so
that gravity does the blending work for you (see Chapter 6 for more
on blending).
If the paper sags, support it with a board, drawing pad, or piece of 
plexiglass.
2. Squeeze a few (separate) nickel-sized dollops of paint and medium
onto your palette, choosing colors to make a vibrant sunset.
Use your color wheel (see Chapter 7) to choose colors that are neigh-
bors (analogous). Say, for example, that you have a blue sky but you
want a yellow sunset on the horizon. If you allow the yellow and blue to
mix directly, you end up with a green sky, which you probably hadn’t
planned on painting. To avoid a green sky, separate the yellow and blue
with red. The blue mixes with the red to make purple, and the yellow
and red blend to orange. You get a rainbow of colors that look like a
proper sunset — without green.
3. Using a 1⁄4-inch flat brush, pull about one quarter of the medium
toward each paint dollop and mix them slowly, rinsing the brush
between colors and making sure to leave some pure color and pure
medium to add later.
4. Rinse the brush and use it to dampen the paper with clear water
where the sky will be.
5. While the paper is damp, apply paint along one side in a strip about half
an inch wide, starting at the top and pulling the color down the page.
Use the flat brush to dip into a color halfway up the hairs. Go back and
forth till you cover the amount of paper you want, letting the color fade
162
Part IV: Acrylic’s Versatile Styles 

toward the edges of the strip, which will come in contact with the other
colors to allow a blend with other colors.
6. Rinse the brush, change colors, and repeat Step 5 until your sky is fin-
ished, blending the colors into smooth transitions where they meet.
If your paint is too streaky, let the paint dry and then add another layer
by repeating Steps 4, 5, and 6 again over the top to achieve a smoother
transition between colors.
7. After your paper dries, turn it horizontally.
Your sky is ready for you to paint scenery on top of it (see Figure 10-2).
Raindrops keep falling on my head
You can also use the flowing paint to make a rain storm. Follow the steps in
the “Riding off into the sunset” section, but orient the paper horizontally and
use a blue-gray color along the entire top of the damp paper. Tilt the paper
and let the water move the color down like rain; you can even tilt at an angle
if you like. Figures 10-3a and b show a photograph of a rainy sky and an
acrylic painted rainy sky.

Chapter 10: Letting It Flow: Creating a Watercolor-like Landscape

If you want even more shafts of rain detail, use a bit of white paint on a liner
brush to pull down some lines of rain over the background you just made,
making sure they all go in the same direction. Remember, sometimes rain
comes with wind, so painting your lines at an angle gives the impression of a
wind-driven stormy day.
When allowing colors to flow, don’t be afraid to pick up the paper and let
gravity mix the paint. Turn your paper all around so the paint flows in differ-
ent directions. Keep it moving till you like the results, and then lay the paper
flat and let it dry. If you don’t like the results, you can always add more paint
in another layer. See an imperfection you don’t like? That may be a good
place for a cloud. Problem solved! (See the following section for more on
painting clouds.)
Clouding the picture
Clouds are main elements in skies, and big, fluffy, white clouds are easy and
fun to paint. When your background sky color is dry, that’s the time to add
some clouds. They come in many shapes, of course, and making shapes up is
part of the fun. Go look at real clouds or photos of them to get ideas, or feel
free to create the shapes you think you need to make your composition
strong (see Chapter 9 for more on composition). The cloud shapes can direct
the viewer’s eye to where you want them to look, break up the sky space and
be part of the background, or cover mistakes (not that you need that).
An important part of making good-looking clouds, as well as other objects, is
forming the edges. I discuss edges in the next section, so the clouds in this
section’s project, though generally cloud-y, may look a bit undefined.
Clouds and sky are good opportunities to subtly bounce colors from the fore-
ground of the painting into the sky area. I use the term bounce like a bouncing
ball. Colors can repeat in areas of the painting: up then down, then up, then
down so it’s not isolated in only one area. In fact, it’s a good idea to balance a
painting by putting some color from the foreground (closest area to the
viewer) into the sky and some sky color into the foreground. More on balance
in Chapter 8.
Try your hand at some clouds. Note: This exercise requires one of the pro-
jects from either the “Riding off into the sunset” or “Raindrops keep falling on
my head” section, so if you haven’t done at least one of those, head there
before you start this project.
1. Choose one of your background sky paintings that you want to add
clouds to.
2. Put nickel-sized dollops of acrylic medium and white and Payne’s
Gray paint on your palette.
You can mix your own Payne’s Gray by combining a bit of Ultramarine
Blue and Burnt Sienna with white. You want the gray to be a bit more on
the blue side.
164
Part IV: Acrylic’s Versatile Styles 

3. Using a round #8 brush, swirl the paint on the cloud area by moving
the brush in a circular motion and making cloud edges that undulate
in and out.
Dip the hairs of the brush halfway into the white paint; if you go much
farther, the brush is harder to clean. Using the undulating technique
gives you more realistic cloud shapes than just making even, predictable
shapes like ovals and circles does.
4. Rinse your brush clean in clear water.
5. Add a shadow side underneath the cloud by swirling Payne’s Gray
around the bottom edge of the cloud, continuing to move around the
cloud as your brush picks up some of the already-painted white.
Continuing to swirl your brush around the cloud makes all kinds of inte-
rior shapes. Check out the photo of clouds in Figure 10-4 for inspiration.
Getting Edgy: Defining the Edges 
of Landscape Objects
The perimeter of an object is defined by its edge. Sometimes what goes on
inside the object isn’t as important as the edge around it. Think of a silhouette:
You usually know what the object is even though the only other visual informa-
tion you have about it is the edge. You can paint three types of edges to define
your objects: hard, soft, and lost. Having a variety of all three types of edges in
your work adds to good design (see Chapter 8 for more design tips).
Clouds are perfect subjects to practice hard, soft, and lost edges, so that’s
what I use in this section.
Figure 10-4:
A typical
cloud
formation.
165
Chapter 10: Letting It Flow: Creating a Watercolor-like Landscape

Hard edges
Hard edges are distinct, crisp, and defined — you know exactly where the
object starts and ends. Notice the hard edges in Figure 10-5. Painting a clean,
hard edge can be as simple as using your brush and letting the paint do the
work. To paint a crisp, hard edge, paint on a dry surface so the paint doesn’t
leach into a wet space. If you’re painting a hard edge, such as a building side,
there’s no shame in using a ruler to define a straight line.
You can also create a hard edge placing a bit of masking tape along your
desired edge and painting right up to the tape. Use tape that doesn’t pull off
paint, such as a low-tack tape found in the paint department of hardware
stores. I especially like white artist’s tape because it’s acid free and comes in a
variety of widths. (More on the importance of acid-free products in Chapter 2.)
Soft and lost edges
Soft edges are less defined. Think of a camera shot that is a little out of focus —
the edge exists, but you have to really look at it to decide where it is exactly.
Soft edges often indicate that items are farther away in space in your painting,
like looking out your window and seeing fuzzy edges on a tree 100 feet away.
To make a soft edge, blend the paint into another color using a soft brush.
You can also fade the paint away by adding medium or water to the wet paint
to make it gradually disappear. Another little trick to soften edges is to gently
sweep a big, soft mop brush back and forth across the cloud. If the back-
ground color is still wet, this blends the colors together subtly
Here’s an exercise to help you practice creating soft edges:
1. Get out a piece of canvas paper, a paint color of your choice, and 
a 1⁄4-inch flat brush.
2. Dip the brush into the paint and make a half circle stroke (see 
Figure 10-6a).
Figure 10-5:
This cloud
has a hard
edge; you
can

see where it
ends and

begins.
166
Part IV: Acrylic’s Versatile Styles 

3. Rinse the brush clean in water, blotting excess water on a sponge.
4. Apply a stroke of clear water repeating the same half circle stroke
below — but not touching — the inner side of the painted circle (see
Figure 10-6b).
5. Do another brush stroke of clear water between the two strokes, so
that the brush touches both.
This stroke brings the paint to the damp area and makes a soft edge, as
shown in Figure 10-6c.
6. Continue to stroke using clean water, working the paint out gradually,
to make a soft edge using dark to light values.
You’ve now made the outer edge of the circle as a hard edge, and the
water-softened other side as a soft edge. Figure 10-6d shows the final
result.
Lost edges are edges that have completely disappeared. The edge fades away
and becomes lost in another item. Lost edges ask viewers to get involved by
having them make their own decisions as to what is going on in the scene. In
Figure 10-7 you see some of the soft edges of the cloud vanishing into the sky
color.

167
Chapter 10: Letting It Flow: Creating a Watercolor-like Landscape

To make lost edges, allow the shape with the edge to fade into whatever is
beside it. Perhaps the values (light and dark) become very close, and the
viewer can’t tell where the object stops and the background starts. (More on
value in Chapter 8.)
You can use any comfortable method to hold your brush, but I like to have a
more random way of placing paint, and the following position gives me more
flexibility: At the farthest point from the tip, the back of the handle, grip the
end of the brush as you would a stair railing (see Figure 10-8a). Loosen your
grip a little. Teeter the brush by wriggling your pinky, ring finger, and middle
finger. Your index finger and thumb, then, are really all that are holding the
brush. Practice twisting the brush in your hand. Roll the handle using your
index finger and thumb. Artists often hold their brushes in this fashion to
give the brush more freedom to make expressive marks.  Another way to hold
the brush is like a pencil, as in Figure 10-8b, which gives you control for small
detail work.  All edges can be created with any way of gripping the brush. It is
applying the paint and what goes beside it that defines the edge.

168
Part IV: Acrylic’s Versatile Styles 

Try painting some clouds using the brush grips described in the preceding
paragraph. Roll the brush when applying paint. Try pushing paint toward you
and pulling the paint away from you. Every so often, rinse the brush and
apply a little water to soften an edge. Concentrate on making a variety of
edges. You may even add other colors. Often clouds reflect pinks, oranges,
and yellows from the sun.
Seeing the Forest for the Trees
Trees are an important part of many landscapes — I spent a fall afternoon
looking at the fabulous foliage of Colorado. Check out the variety of trees in
the photo shown in Figure 10-9.
Nature is inspiring, of course, but trying to paint it can be a bit daunting.
However, with some fairly easy tricks you can simulate the edges of complex
leaf patterns. In this section, I show two different techniques for painting
trees using thinned acrylic paint. Be sure to notice the variety in edges: hard,
soft, and lost; for more on these kinds of edges, see the preceding section.
Defining tree edges by painting 
and spattering
Painting every leaf on a tree can be too much visually, not to mention a lot of
work. I like to simplify a tree by not putting in all the details. The edge is what
Figure 10-9:
Fall trees
are defined
by many
edges.
169
Chapter 10: Letting It Flow: Creating a Watercolor-like Landscape

defines the tree. The center of the tree in Figure 10-10a, for example, is simply
colors that have mixed and mingled on damp paper.
In Figure 10-10b I spattered the leaves on with a toothbrush loaded with paint
(more on spattering in Chapter 5). Spritz water with a spray bottle to make the
spatter move. This technique works really well for creating random texture with
thin acrylic. The paint can mingle and create new colors by running together.
If you’re in the mood for some fun, try spattering a tree:
1. Cover any areas where you don’t want paint with a rag or towel.
Spattering is messy, and the paint can and does go more places than you
want. I always have some paint-covered terry cloth towels dedicated for
this purpose.
2. Dip an old toothbrush in water-diluted paint.
3. Grab the handle of the toothbrush so your thumb can pull the bristles
back and let the paint fly.
4. Rinse your brush, change colors, and spatter some more.
5. Spritz the painting with water and let the colors flow together.
Note: Too much water can mix the colors too much, giving you a muddy
result. Less is more.
6. Pick up a brush and gently move the color together to fill in the
center of the foliage.
To contain the mess, put the painting in a box — the sides help trap the
paint. To save your manicure, dip your fingers in dishwashing liquid before
you paint. The undercoat of soap should help the paint wash right off your
skin. Don’t let the paint dry anywhere you don’t want paint permanently.

Making a tree brush out of rubber bands
You’ve probably seen all those specialty brushes available in art stores.
Whenever you need a new gimmick, by all means go buy one and try it. But
you can also make your own.
Here’s a fun homemade brush handy for painting leaves on trees. I know sev-
eral artists who paint their leaves by using this method and get unbelievable
details. The project at the end of this chapter uses this brush to make the
aspen tree leaves and wildflower-like colors in the grass.
1. Gather up a bunch of rubber bands.
They can be different sizes and colors. The example in Figure 10-11a
uses about a dozen bands.
2. Tie them together tightly with cord near the center of the bundle.
Almost any cord, twist tie, or even wire works. Secure it firmly with a
square knot or wire twist (as shown in Figure 10-11b).
3. Wrap the excess cord several times around one half of the bundle and
secure it with a slip knot as shown in Figure 10-11c.
4. Trim the ends of the rubber band evenly (see Figure 10-11d).
A dab of white glue on the tied cord allowed to dry overnight really
secures the brush. See Figure 10-11e for the final product.
You can make different brushes for a variety of textures by choosing wider or
narrower bands, or by tying more or fewer rubber bands together. You may like
this brush so much that you want to make a more sophisticated handle — as
it is, you just grab it by the tight, corded end.
Try out the brush by dipping it in some paint and pouncing it on some paper.
It produces exactly the type of detail that can indicate leaves on a tree.
Change colors to make it interesting. Mist the painted dots with water
sprayed from a squirt bottle to soften the dots.

Chapter 10: Letting It Flow: Creating a Watercolor-like Landscape

Layering Paint for Endless Possibilities
When you first conceive a painting, it seems like a lot to paint. But remember,
you don’t paint it all at once. Usually, you work up a painting in layers. A layer
is one coating of paint that you apply and then leave to dry. You can then paint
another layer on top of the first, followed by another and another and . . . well,
you get the idea.
Look for the farthest distant object or area to start with in your painting. In a
landscape (the focus of this chapter), that is usually the sky. (In other kinds
of paintings, it’s something else — in Chapter 11, for example, the back-
ground of a still life is the cloth on a table.) Then you add whatever is next
closest. In a landscape that may be a distant hill, mountain, or group of trees.
You continue moving forward, painting closer and closer objects.
Getting a little perspective
To create the illusion of distance, artists use the concept of aerial perspec-
tive. Aerial perspective uses the following tricks to make two-dimensional
objects, such as forms in a painting, appear as though they exist in three-
dimensional space. As objects get farther away from the viewer, they
 Get smaller
 Become grayer or cooler (bluer — more on color temperature in
Chapter 7)
 Have less discernible detail and softer edges
As they come closer, they
 Get bigger
 Become warmer (redder)
 Have more details and sharper, harder, more defined edges
Backgrounds, middle grounds, 
and foregrounds
In a landscape, imagine that you’re dressing a stage like the director of a play
does. She has to account for the back curtain or set, the middle area where
some of the action takes place, and the front of the stage that is closest to the
audience. Your painting should have the same three areas — the background,
middle ground, and foreground. By putting all three areas in a painting, you
emphasize the depth and create the illusion of three-dimensional space.
172
Part IV: Acrylic’s Versatile Styles 

Figure 10-12 shows the basic layering strategy, using a patch of visually close
land with some grass on it to illustrate. Just follow these steps, being sure to
let each step dry before moving on to the next to keep your edges crisp.
1. Paint some color onto canvas paper and then texturize it by dabbing
with a crumpled paper towel.
This swatch serves as your foreground practice area (shown in 
Figure 10-12a).
2. Paint around the area where the grass will be.
This technique is called negative painting. The grass is the positive
shape, so when you paint what surrounds it, you’re painting the negative
shape (Figure 10-12b). More on negative shapes in Chapter 8.
3. Use a liner brush to add lines that represent blades of grass.
Vary your colors to make the grass more natural. You may have some
dried brown grass, some new tender green shoots, and some mature
grasses with seed pods. (See Figure 10-12c.)
4. Dab paint on the foreground using a rubber band brush.
In this case, the results look like seed pods, wildflowers, and whatever
else may be in the grass (Figure 10-12d). (You can find instructions for
creating a rubber band brush in the section “Making a tree brush out of
rubber bands” earlier in this chapter.)

Project: Putting Together a 
Watercolor-like Landscape
This project combines all of the techniques covered in this chapter to paint a
real landscape, complete with background, middle ground, and foreground.
As you may expect, it involves layers and using color temperature to create
depth of space (check out Chapter 7 for info on color tricks). Let each new
layer overlap at the top edge of the previous layer’s bottom edge. Remember,
layers get warmer as they come toward the viewer.
I didn’t sketch this project first — you can just paint over areas if you want to
change something you’ve done. You don’t have to make an exact copy of my
project if you don’t want to; just look at the example as a guideline.
1. Choose your canvas paper size.
I did the example here on a piece of 5-x-7-inch canvas paper.
2. Squirt out dime-sized blobs of white, yellow, orange, green, blue,
black, and purple onto your palette, replacing them as necessary as
you work.
3. Get water, some paper towel, a sponge, and the following brushes:
#10 round, #000 liner, #4 round, and #1 round.
I describe brushes in Chapter 2 and more setup details in Chapter 4.
4. Paint the sky layer.
A. Mix a sky blue (cobalt blue) color. Choose and adjust your color so
it looks like the sky you want. A quarter size of blue got a dime of
white added.
My cobalt blue was too dark, so I added some white till it looked
like a Colorado sky. My blue leans toward purple (to get more of a
purple blue, add a touch of red, such as Alizarin Crimson).
B. Use the #10 round brush to apply an even coat of blue, painting
around the shape of what will be your cloud (leaving the cloud
area white).
Be sure to paint underneath the cloud as well.
C. Before the blue is dry, rinse the brush and paint a cloud by swirling
on white paint with the brush lying nearly parallel to the paper.
Create soft edges between the cloud and the blue sky for visual
interest. See Figure 10-13.
5. Use the dry #4 brush to gently swirl around the sky, cloud, and the
cloud’s edges to soften it till it looks natural, blending paint where
necessary. Let it dry when you’re happy with it.
You may need to go back to add more color and soften edges till you like
the sky.
6. Paint on a distant mountain layer.
Use the round #10 brush to apply a greener blue (such as Phthalocyanine
Blue). Add a touch of orange to neutralize the blue on your palette (see
Chapter 7 for more on neutralizing color). See Figure 10-14.

7. Paint the edge of a far layer of trees.
A. Make a color bridge of green paint by mixing yellow to blue.
You can choose many different greens along this blend of paint.
Head to Chapter 7 for more on creating color bridges.
B. Alternate painting yellow-greens and blue-greens to make a jagged
tree line that defines the next green mountain layer.
Use the point of the round brush to make little triangles along the
tree line that defines the top of the mountain. Vary the height and
width of the triangle shapes as well as the spaces between them. See
Figure 10-15.

8. Fill in a closer, green mountain layer beneath the trees with more
greens.
Use the point of the round brush to apply a variety of the green paint
colors created in Step 7A. By dabbing the paint using the tip of the
brush, you can quickly produce the look of the triangular shapes of
many trees on the mountains. See Figure 10-16.
9. Paint the foreground with warm colors such as yellow, Yellow Ochre,
and orange.
Add some grass areas using negative painting, rubber band brush dots,
and liner brush-painted blades of grass. Follow the foreground example
from the project in “Backgrounds, middle grounds, and foregrounds”
earlier in this chapter for guidance. See Figure 10-17.

10. Add as many details as you like.
This step lets you personalize your painting and try the techniques dis-
cussed in this chapter and elsewhere in the book. Use a rubber band
brush to add more details in the foreground and trees. Glaze on warm
yellows to bring trees forward or separate more layers, or glaze on cool
blues to push other areas back into space. (See Chapter 4 for more on
glazing.) See Figure 10-18. You’re done! You have a beautiful watercolor-
like landscape.

Chapter 10: Letting It Flow: Creating a Watercolor-like Landscape

Extra credit: You can add even more layers. In Figure 10-19, I added a wildlife
layer: the elk in the foreground and the birds in the sky. You can add whatever
you like. Notice how the elk’s dark-value legs stand out against the light yellow 
meadow foreground. (Check out Chapter 9 for more information on values.)
The elk gives the painting a center of interest, and the birds direct the eye
back up into the painting.
Now, some landscape purists like only land, trees, and sky in their landscapes — 
in other words, no buildings or wildlife. Humbug. You add whatever you want.

Like the Oil Masters

M
any new artists choose oil because they think it’s what’s best — after
all, oil painting has been the queen of painting for centuries. However,
if the old masters had possessed the technology of acrylics, I think they
would have preferred those. Using some of the techniques and tips I discuss
in this chapter, you can make acrylic paint achieve the look of oil without the
risk (many of the old masters suffered from lead and cadmium poisoning)
and with many more advantages. Acrylic paint is entirely capable of produc-
ing thick, rich paintings like the museum oil masterpieces.
This chapter aims to acquaint you with the pros and cons of oils versus
acrylics and provide lots of ideas on making your acrylic paintings as good-
looking as any oil-based one — leading up to three projects that can help you
bring it all together at the end of the chapter.
Getting Ready to Create 
an “Oil” Masterpiece
Acrylic paint’s versatility allows it to easily mimic the look of oil paint (as
well as watercolor and other types of paint) without a lot of the hassle. In
order to produce your own oil-like masterpiece with the ease that acrylic
paint affords, you just need to do a little prep work. Your first orders of busi-
ness are to amend your acrylic paints to extend their drying time and to
choose and prep an appropriate surface on which to paint.
Extending your acrylic’s 
drying time to mimic oil
Oil paint takes a long time to dry — up to six months. Who has time for that?
On the other hand, the long drying time allows for more painting time to

blend colors while the paint is still wet. Acrylic paint typically dries very
quickly, but you can extend drying time to give yourself a bit of the time
luxury available to the oil painter. You have a few options:
 Slow-drying acrylic paint: Some recently developed acrylic paints have
a slower drying time than normal acrylics. For example, Golden Paints (a
manufacturer in New York) makes a line of paint called Open that stays
wet ten times longer than regular acrylic paint. As with all acrylic paint,
slow-drying paint’s drying time depends on air temperature, humidity,
and thickness of the paint. However, you still notice a significant
increase in the amount of time your paint stays wet. For instance, in a
humid environment like New York, the slow-drying paint can take sev-
eral days to dry, where as the same application of these paints in a hot,
dry environment like Arizona may dry overnight.
 Retarder additive: Several manufacturers make retarder, a clear additive
that you can mix with any acrylic product (including paint, of course) to
slow its drying time. It comes in a few choices for length of drying time.
Be careful with retarder. If you use more than 15 to 20 percent retarder 
to 85 to 80 percent paint, the paint stays tacky and never fully dries!
 Acrylic glazing liquid: Several manufacturers make a glazing liquid
designed to extend the open time of acrylics to allow time for blending
and glazing effects. These products act like a retarder yet fully dry with-
out a tacky feel. They contain binder (retarders don’t), and you can use
them in any ratio.
All acrylics, mediums, slow-drying acrylics, and retarders are compatible. If
you use the slow-drying acrylics, wait 30 days before applying a final varnish.
An oil painter needs to wait six months to varnish (see the sidebar near the
end of the chapter for more on varnishing).
Sometimes I want to paint the background of a painting and have it dry
quickly so I can start working in more layers. For this purpose, plain old regu-
lar acrylics are a good choice. Sometimes I want to blend clouds and sky and
take my time — that is a good time for some slower drying acrylic.
Choosing and prepping a surface
Of course, you can’t paint without a surface to paint on. Prepared canvas is
the go-to surface for oil paintings because the oil will leach and spread across
a more absorbent surface like paper. Plus, oil also needs to breathe (because
it continues to oxidize forever), and the open back of canvas allows air to get
to the canvas. Acrylic paints won’t leach and don’t require the extra air as
long, but using them on canvas helps you achieve the look of oil tradition
with less hassle. If you want to use canvas, head to Chapter 2 for instructions
on prepping the surface with gesso.
Many artists like the feel of canvas fabric because it gives a little when they
push it with their brushes. However, canvas is easily punctured, and the flexi-
bility of canvas increases the risk of cracking or loosening paint from your
painting (acrylic paint is less likely to crack than oil, but it’s still possible).
For acrylics, I like to use cradled boards, which are made from wood (usually
maple) and available in many sizes. They’re a bit more expensive, but also
180
Part IV: Acrylic’s Versatile Styles 

save money because they don’t require framing. If they’re raw wood, prime
with acrylic gesso for better results. Preprimed boards are ready to paint.
Trying Oil-Inspired Techniques
Oil painting is still popular because it’s rich in techniques that help painters
make beautiful art. An old masterwork has so much depth because the painter
used many layers of thinned paint to build up a surface quality. The shadows
and forms look so real you may think you can reach into the painting and
pick up a piece of fruit from the still life.
By learning a few oil-inspired techniques, you can produce virtually the same
results with acrylic paint. This section shows you how.
Painting backgrounds with 
aerial perspective
The first step in making a painting, whether oil or acrylic, can be a bit daunt-
ing; looking at that fresh, empty white canvas can inhibit the creative juices.
But just getting some color over the white can help overcome your inhibition,
so be bold, get some paint out, and start blocking in a background.
With backgrounds, whether you’re painting a landscape, portrait, still life, or
an abstract, start at the farthest point away and paint items in order as they
get closer to the viewer. That makes it easier to overlap things in the painting
and create the illusion of space.
A fun way to start is to put several colors on the canvas and blend them with
a big brush. If you get it too blended and wish you had stopped earlier, add
more paint and try again. See Chapters 6 and 10 for more on blending.
Backgrounds should support the subject matter. The subject is a gourmet
meal, and the background is the good china.
Backgrounds can also influence the final painting. In Figure 11-1, I painted
concentric circles of warm colors radiating out from the sun. I didn’t com-
pletely blend them, so you can see the separate colors and brush strokes.
The background peeks through the overpainted layers, giving the final paint-
ing a unified feeling. (I discuss unity more in Chapters 8 and 9.)
Blurring the background focuses even more on the subject. Using aerial per-
spective is a technique to make the illusion of depth and focus even greater in
your painting. The rules of aerial perspective are as follows:
 Things get smaller as they go back into space.
 Things get grayer and darker (less intense) as they recede.
 Less detail is visible the farther away something is.
 Things tend to get cooler (bluer) the farther away they are.
181
Chapter 11: Laying It On Thick: Painting Like the Oil Masters

Figure 11-2 uses aerial perspective. See how the foreground signs are legible?
You can even see the products in the front of the fish market. As the space
recedes into the distance, objects get smaller and have fewer details, and you
can’t read the signs clearly.

Overlapping
Overlapping (putting one thing in front of another) also helps create the illu-
sion of depth that oil paintings often feature. When you place things side by
side, their appearance has a flatter feeling (think of cookie cutter shapes
lined up), but overlapped shapes create the illusion of distance. To create
more depth and space in your painting, overlap shapes so that one is clearly
in front of another. The more you overlap things, the deeper the space
appears to be. Check out the illusion of space created by overlapping horses
and riders in Figure 11-3. It would be a much different painting if the horses
and riders were all in a row with no overlapping.

Getting a sketch onto a dark background
You may just paint without drawing your subject
first, but sometimes I think it’s easier to paint if you
have a sketch to go by — it’s like making your own
coloring book page. The sketch, or drawing, is an
outline of the shapes that you fill with shadows
and colors when you paint. In Chapter 6, I show
how to resize and transfer a drawing to the paint-
ing surface with graphite paper. But what if you’ve
painted the background a dark color?
Well, you can also transfer a drawing onto a dark
surface. Here’s the trick: Graphite paper comes in
colors, including white. When you trace your
drawing with a piece of white graphite paper
underneath, the drawing is transferred onto the
painting surface with white lines that show up
beautifully on dark colors.

Creating texture
Look at a Van Gogh sometime — even a print. You can see the texture of the
paint so clearly you almost want to run your fingers over it (but if you’re read-
ing this sentence at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, resist the urge).
Texture can be real or implied. You can thicken paint and make physical peaks
and valleys in it, or you can paint a texture that looks like bumps and rough
spots yet when touched is smooth. Implied texture is an illusion. Incredibly pre-
cise painting that looks very real (textured) is called trompe l’oeil (pronounced
tromp-loy), which means “fool the eye” in French. When you want to reach out
and pick up an object on a painting, you know it’s a trompe l’oeil painting. The
following sections give you tips on creating these real and imaginary textures.
Using paste to create canvas texture
Oil paintings have incredible texture because the old masters used layer
upon layer of paint to build the textures up. However, you can get the same
look in acrylics with less paint by using paste to create texture. Pastes are
basically thick goos formulated with various additives for different effects. In
general, pastes are heavier than the gel mediums and aren’t clear (because of
their additives) — check out Chapter 3 for more on pastes.
To get the look of thick oil texture without wasting any paint, sculpt the mod-
eling paste into whatever shapes you want by piling up the paste while wet.
This paste requires an overnight drying time (though it dries more quickly
the more thinly you apply it), so you have plenty of manipulation time. Make
some indentations in the paste with a palette knife to create even more tex-
ture (such as indicating kernel lines in “Project: Fall Corn Still Life” later in
this chapter). Figure 11-18 later in the chapter shows the paste process in the
context of the Fall Corn Still Life project.
Using gesso to create canvas texture
Many oil masters used canvases textured with lead white — now considered
quite toxic. However, modern science and acrylics have provided artists with
improved products for their health and safety: gesso (a kind of primer).
(Chapter 2 gives you more info on gesso.) By painting on gesso with a stiff
brush, you can make swirls, crisscrosses, or other random patterns. If you
want a stipple-effect texture, apply the gesso with a mini roller.
Using texture brushes
You can buy special texture brushes that can help you paint implied textures.
These brushes have different shapes designed to make lines, fur, grass, waves,
feathers, and other textures. Their stiff bristle hairs carry large paint loads
for thicker paint distribution. (Check out Chapter 2 for more brush talk.)
Figure 11-4 shows three texture brushes and the textures they create. The top
brush is a #10 filbert comb, a ratty, tapered brush. When I bought it, this filbert
comb was packaged in a set designed specifically to paint fur and feathers.
184
Part IV: Acrylic’s Versatile Styles 

The middle brush is a 1⁄4-inch flat rake. The well-named rakes are similar to
combs except they have a longer rattiness for even more pronounced lines
great for grass and fur. The bottom brush is a Wave (made by Dynasty FM
Brushes). Surprise — its end has a wave shape. It makes quick work of paint-
ing scales on a reptile, and you can surely come up with a hundred other
uses. You can find many other brush shapes in an art supply store.
Using streaks and blends
Colors can be blended to make beautiful, gradual transitions between one
color and another. You make a blend by stroking the brush over the paint
many times until there’s a subtle change from one color to the next such that
you can’t tell exactly where the change happened.
However, you don’t have to blend paint completely all the time. Try a streak,
a complicated-looking (but incredibly easy) stroke where you use multiple
colors on one brush at the same time. Dip the end of the flat brush in one
color and then dip just the tip of each corner in different colors. Stroke it on
the surface and leave it alone — blending, though tempting, only loses the
spontaneity. In Figure 11-5 I dipped a flat brush in three colors and stroked
the paint onto the canvas paper in one pull. I made the thick and thin effect
by twisting the brush to use the wide side and narrow edge.

Chapter 11: Laying It On Thick: Painting Like the Oil Masters

Using mediums, gels, and pastes to influence paint texture
Acrylic manufacturers offer a variety of ways to make your acrylic paint act like
oil. Acrylic paint comes in two basic viscosities (thicknesses) of paint: regular,
thick paint (an oil-like consistency often called heavy-bodied or high-viscosity)
and a liquid version known as fluid or soft-bodied. You can make either of these
paint types even thicker or stiffer by adding mediums, gels, or pastes into the
paint. In general mediums are thin enough to be pourable, gels are thicker than
mediums but thinner than pastes, and pastes are thick and usually look white or
opaque. None of these products contains color; they’re made out of exactly the
same stuff as the paint but without the pigments. If you’re looking for lots of tex-
ture, try adding extra heavy gel into heavy-bodied paint. See Chapter 3 for more
on mediums, pastes, and gels. For impasto painting (a thick painting technique
popular with oil painters), you can use acrylic paint and make it even more
dimensional by adding heavy gel to simulate the look of chunky, deep oil paint
that stands up and gets noticed. In Figure 11-6, I built up some impasto texture.
This figure is a close-up of the Fall Corn Still Life at the end of the chapter.
Using scraffito
Oil painters use scraping or scraffito (more description in Chapter 4) to add
dimension and detail, and you can do the same with acrylic. Scraffito allows
you to draw texture (such as tree branches or grass) into the wet paint. Just
use a palette knife (or credit card corner or chopstick — whatever works) to
scrape lines before the paint dries.
Figure 11-5:

186
Part IV: Acrylic’s Versatile Styles 

Figure 11-7 shows a variety of scraffito textures. I incised lines in the paint by
pulling the knife edge slowly through the paint in a scraping motion; by hur-
riedly scribbling through the paint; and by scraping in layers — first one way
and then another.
Create your own version of Figure 11-7. Use painter’s (or masking) tape to
mask off box areas and then apply various paint colors and scrape designs
and lines while the paint is still wet. When you’re finished, wait till the paint
is dry and remove the tape by carefully and slowly pulling it away from the

187
Chapter 11: Laying It On Thick: Painting Like the Oil Masters

surface, gripping the tape as close to the paint surface as possible to avoid
tearing or peeling up paint with the tape.
Simulating depth with shadows
Shadows in a still life often guide your eye path through the entire painting.
(More on eye path composition in Chapter 9.) In general, adding shadows to
your acrylic paintings helps achieve the depth and lifelike look associated
with oil.
Shadows are critical to realistic-looking paintings (oil-like and otherwise) and
are another important way to show depth. To turn flat shapes into three-
dimensional forms, employ some shadows. In Chapter 5, I show you how to
turn a circle into a sphere by using shadows, but circles aren’t the only
shapes that benefit from shadows: A square can become a cube, a triangle
becomes a pyramid — well, you get the idea. Even better, almost all objects
can be created by using such basic shapes and forms. Master them, and
you’re a long way toward being able to paint anything. Figure 11-8 gives flat
shapes volume (a more rounded look) by the addition of shadows.
Creating shadows with glaze
How do you paint shadows on real things? Shadows are of course a bit darker
than the surface upon which they lie. They’re also transparent. You can see
Figure 11-8:
Shape
becomes
form by
adding
shadows.
188
Part IV: Acrylic’s Versatile Styles 

through shadows to see details within the shadow. An easy way to paint shad-
ows is by making a glaze — a very transparent paint color. You can easily
make acrylic paint more transparent by adding medium, acrylic glazing
liquid, or water to it. You then paint the glaze over an area to darken it with-
out obliterating the details beneath the paint. (More on glazing in Chapter 4.)
I like to use Ultramarine Blue for shadows. Observe shadows in real life to see
whether you can detect this or different colors. Figure 11-9 shows the blue
shadows on a white iris.
Shaping shadows
The shape of a shadow is important. Shadows should have an interesting shape
that describes the surface, helps direct the eye around the picture plane, and
defines the object casting the shadow. Think of a silhouette — a shadow shape.
The shapes of shadows are often more important than an object’s interior
details when it comes to making a drawing recognizable. The shadow shape
in Figure 11-10, for example, lets you identify Abraham Lincoln without much
detail at all.
Figure 11-9:
Blue

189
Chapter 11: Laying It On Thick: Painting Like the Oil Masters

Want a cool oil painter trick to make still life come to life? Make shadows
work for you by painting little highlighted areas of interest like dew drops
and gemstones. This technique comes in handy in the “Project: Fall Corn Still
Life” section later in the chapter, but it works for other things besides corn:
beads, eyes, jelly beans, water drops, and about any other small, round item
you can think of. Here’s how to do it:
1. Paint the shape in one color.
For the example in Figure 11-11a, I made a kidney-shaped dewdrop by
using a #6 round brush and acrylic paint in Phthalo Blue and white.
2. Paint one side dark and one side light and then blend, adding white
to lighten as necessary.
In Figure 11-11b, light is at the bottom and dark is on top.
If the result doesn’t look quite right, let it dry and try again with a layer
on top.

Part IV: Acrylic’s Versatile Styles 

3. Finish with a shadow and a highlight.
I painted the shadow in Figure 11-11c by using pure dark color beneath
the drop. I made the highlight by painting a curved line of white paint
over the dark top area.
Shadow shapes also work to describe landscapes, still lifes, and abstracts.
Values (lights and darks) can be organized throughout the painting to make a
pattern. Value patterns help direct the eye to look throughout the entire com-
position. But avoid isolated darks or lights. Give your values plenty of friends
so they don’t get lonely, and the painting should end up being well balanced
with an interesting value pattern.
In Figure 11-12 you see a still life (a), its drawing with a value pattern (b), and
the path the eye takes (c) to follow the value pattern. Planning a value pat-
tern in this manner can improve your paintings.
Project: Irresistible Husky Dog
Here’s the first of three projects that provide great opportunities to paint
with some of the oil techniques discussed earlier in this chapter. Wildlife has
interested many oil painters over the years because the medium lends itself
to making detailed fur, highlighted eyes, and beautiful blended backgrounds.
Lucky for you, acrylic also works perfectly to paint these things. Spirit, the
sweet dog in Figures 11-13 through 11-17, gives you a chance to work with
shadows and fur textures, using high-contrast white and darks.
Practice on a test paper with your rake and combs before you go straight for
the canvas. Dip the hairs into the white paint and work on creating wisps of
hair on scrap paper. The paint should be a creamy consistency to create fine
lines.

Chapter 11: Laying It On Thick: Painting Like the Oil Masters

1. Gather water, a spray bottle, a sponge, your brushes (#4 and #10 fil-
bert comb, #6 round, and #10 flat rake), and several small pieces of
plastic about 5 inches square.
The plastic can be a grocery bag or sandwich wrap — I used the cello-
phane wrap the canvas was sold in.
2. Get a prepared surface of your choice about 8 x 10 inches.
I painted on a stretched, preprimed canvas.
3. Prepare your palette with white, Phthalo Green, Forest Green, Payne’s
Gray, Phthalo Blue, Quinacridone Red, and Alizarin Crimson Hue.
I used craft paint in a bottle for the Forest Green; if you can’t find it, add
a little yellow to your Phthalo Green. Keep your palette paints misted.
For more time before paints dry, use an acrylic paint that has a longer
open drying time or add one drop of acrylic retarder to each of your reg-
ular acrylics.
4. Paint the canvas background dark by squirting and then blending
Payne’s Gray, Phthalo Green, and Forest Green directly on the canvas
before pressing crumpled plastic wrap all over the wet background.
Leave the plastic in the paint till it dries.
5. While the background dries, prepare your drawing by enlarging
Figure 11-13 to fit your canvas.
You can use a copy machine, or check out Chapter 6 for more on enlarg-
ing drawings.
Figure 11-13:

192
Part IV: Acrylic’s Versatile Styles 

6. Remove the plastic wrap when the background is dry.
Don’t be worried if the plastic left a little real texture. It adds interest.
7. Transfer the drawing by using white graphite paper.
You can find instructions for transferring a drawing in Chapter 6. Figure
11-14 shows the transferred husky.
8. Paint the fur, using the comb brushes and rake (Figure 11-15).
Dip a filbert comb into white paint and then touch the canvas and pull
until the hair is the proper length. (Use the #6 for larger areas and the #4
for the smaller hairs and the layered hairs on top.) Paint the hair strokes
in the direction the hair grows — short, quick strokes with an upward
movement at the end work well.
Put the white on the brightest areas — the right side is where the light is
hitting the dog’s face. The dog’s muzzle (nose) is a solid white, but you can
build up the white by using the fur wisps. As the face turns to the shadow
side, add some Phthalo Blue to the white mixture, continuing to make the
white bluer as you progress across the shadow (left) side. When the paint
drags too much because it’s drying, rinse the brush and put a fresh dip of
paint on it. If you make a mistake or get a glob rather than a wisp, simply
wipe it off the dry background paint with a damp paper towel.
9. Touch up dark areas if needed.
If you painted too much white, let it dry and then paint Payne’s Gray
with the same brushes to get the darks back where you want them.

10. Paint the eyes.
A. Mix some Phthalo Blue with white to make a pale blue and paint
the eyes with the small round brush, leaving the pupil dark.
You can touch the pupil up with Payne’s Gray as necessary.
B. Paint a slightly darker blue (by adding less white) around the edge
and near the top where the eyelid casts a tiny shadow.
You can see the eyes in Figure 11-16.

11. Using the round brush, paint the tongue to mimic Figure 11-16.
Mix three red/pink colors. Quinacridone Red and white make a light
pink. Alizarin Crimson and white make a darker red. Add a little Phthalo
Blue to the dark red for a purple shadow red.
12. Paint the muzzle.
A. Mix Phthalo Blue with the Payne’s Gray to make a black and then
paint a bit of black to make nostrils.
B. Lighten the black mixture with a little white for a gray to make the
highlight shine on the muzzle.
Keep the values dark. Figure 11-16 shows you the muzzle details.
13. Continue the final details.
Touch up, fluff the fur, and layer where paint was too light. Figure 11-17

Project: Fall Corn Still Life
A still life is a popular oil painting topic. Oil painters like still lifes as topics
because they don’t move (unless to rot) for a long time, giving the painter
Figure 11-17:
Final husky
portrait.
195
Chapter 11: Laying It On Thick: Painting Like the Oil Masters

plenty of time to capture every detail. Acrylic does the same job, just more
quickly (so you can still eat the food for dinner).
You can always find something around the house to set up as a still life. This fall
I got some Indian corn — the color and shapes were just begging to be painted.
Note that you have to let the paste dry overnight, so plan ahead accordingly.
1. Get a painting surface ready.
I used an 8-x-10-inch hard board (masonite painted with gesso).
2. Create three corn cob shapes by piling the paste on the painting sur-
face and using a palette knife to make kernel-line indentations.
For Figure 11-18, I made the ears about 1⁄4-inch thick.
3. Allow to dry overnight.
4. Finalize the corn by sanding or carving if needed.
I sanded some of the pointed areas smooth. You can sand and carve
paste into shape if you want a more accurate shape, but for this project I
wanted it pretty loose.
5. Prepare your palette with Naples Yellow Hue, Iridescent Copper,
Diarylide Yellow, white, brown (ideally Burnt Sienna or Burnt
Umber), and Phthalo Green.
Add a drop of acrylic retarder to each color if you want longer time
before drying.
Feel free to substitute colors as you need/want to.

Diarylide Yellow, using a 1⁄4-inch flat brush.
Refer to Figure 11-19 for a rough guide. For more on base coating, head
to Chapter 4.
7. Using a 1⁄2-inch flat brush, dip into several colors and paint streaks for
the corn husks.
In Figure 11-20, I used Naples Yellow Hue, white, Diarylide Yellow, brown,
and Phthalo Green. See Figure 11-20. Turn the brush handle as you apply
to make the thick and thin, turning husks. Notice the darker husks that
go under other husks. You don’t have to follow any drawing — just use
your intuition, enjoy the paint, and put husks wherever you think you
need them.

8. Create details and finish the painting.
Put dark and colored kernels on corn ears, using one stroke of a 1⁄4-inch
filbert brush. When dry, add a shadow and highlight. (Check out
“Simulating depth with shadows” earlier in this chapter for more on cre-
ating shadows and highlights.)
Paint more husks; you can add some darks between the husks, around
the ears — wherever you think it’s best. Figure 11-21 shows you my fin-
ished project.
Project: Son of Corn Painting (A Sequel)
Many styles of oil paintings can inspire acrylic painters. This project is much
like the one in the previous section; the difference is that the style here is
tighter and a bit more time-consuming. If you do both projects, you can com-
pare and decide which style to adopt in future paintings.
This still life project uses many of the oil-inspired techniques (including tex-
turing canvas and streaking) in this chapter.
1. Prepare a surface.
I gessoed a texture on a cradled 11-x-14-inch hard board by applying gesso
in different-direction strokes, using a 1⁄2-inch flat bristle brush. For gen-
eral instructions on applying gesso, head to Chapter 2. See Figure 11-22.

2. Prepare a palette of colors and painting area, including 1⁄4- and 1⁄2-inch
flat brushes, a #8 round brush, and a #000 liner brush.
Add a drop of acrylic retarder to each color if you want longer time
before drying.
3. When the gesso is dry, paint a background and blend to soften colors.
I painted on Yellow Ochre, white, Burnt Sienna, and Diarylide Yellow,
using a 1⁄2-inch flat brush. Place strokes of each color all over the surface
and a larger area of white in the upper right third (Figure 11-23a). Blend
the colors in a big sweeping motion in all directions with the flat brush
till they are soft with no hard edges (Figure 11-23b).

4. Enlarge the drawing in Figure 11-24a to fit your surface and transfer it.
Place graphite paper between the drawing and the surface and trace the
drawing to transfer (as shown in Figure 11-24b). The final drawing on the
background appears in Figure 11-24c.
5. Paint the dark areas to establish a value pattern.
Paint darks in the spots that you want to go backward into space. Figure

the slats in the bushel basket.

I used the following paint colors: Burnt Sienna, Yellow Ochre,
Phthalo Blue, and Diarylide Yellow. To get the dark brown, mix
Burnt Sienna with a bit of Phthalo Blue.
B. When the basket is dry, put a bit of the dark brown where you want
the nail and use your index finger to pull the paint in the direction
of the nail’s dark rust stain.
C. When the rust stain is dry, add the nail head with a dark shadow
outline and paint some dark lines around the rim to define the slats.
Figure 11-26 shows my finished basket. Don’t worry about getting it
exactly like this painting — use the figure to inspire your own basket.
7. Paint the corn.
A. Base coat the corn in transparent yellow.
I used a fluid acrylic Diarylide Yellow so that the drawing still
showed through to guide details later. See Chapter 4 for more on
base coating.
B. Use a round brush to paint colors to the kernels of corn.
Some kernels here are Yellow Ochre, and some are Naples Yellow
Hue. For the red kernels, I used Alizarin Crimson Hue; to make the
dark purple kernels, I added Phthalo Blue. I mixed the orange ker-
nels from Alizarin Crimson and Diarylide Yellow, and the darker
shadow is Burnt Sienna.
C. Add corn kernel highlights of white dots by using the very tip of
the round brush.

D. For final detail, paint some Burnt Sienna lines around the crevices
of the kernels of corn.
Choose one ear — the closest to the viewer — and make it the
most detailed. The bottom ear got thicker paint and is quite 
3-dimensional for this painting. You can see the finished corn in
Figure 11-27.

8. Paint the corn husks.
A. Make husks, using 1⁄2- and 1⁄4-inch flat brushes to streak several colors.
B. Touch up the husks, using a round brush to get into tight areas.
I used white, Naples Yellow, Yellow Ochre, Burnt Sienna, and
Diarylide Yellow. I mixed Yellow Ochre and Phthalo Blue to make 
a green.
C. Add shadow and depth to the husks.
To create shadow under the husks, glaze on Phthalo Blue thinned
with water. To make a husk come forward, paint its edge with light-
ened yellow (add white to yellow) or white; glaze Phthalo Blue or
Burnt Sienna to make a husk recede.
D. Mix Burnt Sienna and Phthalo Blue and use it to outline the husks,
painting with the tip of a round brush.

Varnish: The final frontier
Oil paintings should always be varnished for pro-
tection. I love the gloss varnish on an oil painting
that makes the colors really pop. Technically, you
don’t have to varnish if you’re using acrylic paint in
place of oil because acrylic is pretty durable.
However, dried acrylic is porous, and dirt, grime,
and pollution love to make their homes in such itty-
bitty air holes. By varnishing, you protect the
painting from these intruders.
Wait a week before varnishing your acrylic paint-
ing. If you’re in a hurry, you can probably get away
with waiting only three days (depending on your
climate and other drying factors), but the full week
allows the paint to fully cure. Chapter 4 gives you
the full lowdown on varnish, but here are some of
the qualities that varnish can provide:
 Finish: Varnish comes in three finishes: gloss
(shiny), matte (not as shiny), and semi-gloss
(middle-of-the-road shiny). You can use what-
ever varnish tickles your fancy for any partic-
ular painting, but semi-gloss is great for the
oil-like still lifes in this chapter.
 UV protection: Ultraviolet light fades paint,
and you can protect a painting with a special
UV-protective varnish. However, non-UV var-
nish costs less, so it’s worth considering if
your paintings aren’t going to be subjected to
much UV radiation.
 Spray or brush-on application: Brush-on var-
nish is good for thicker coats and works well
as long as you follow the manufacturer’s
instructions, although it does have a tendency
to create bubbles. Spray-on varnish is easy for
light coats and is bubble-free.
My choice is usually spray-on, removable gloss
varnish with UV protection. Conservationists like
removable varnish for cleaning hundreds of years
from now. They can take varnish covered with
grime, nicotine, and other pollutants off with a sol-
vent and then revarnish the painting underneath
for continued protection and vibrancy.

A
bstract painting doesn’t look like anything — that is, it doesn’t represent
some worldly item like a landscape or still life does. Representational art
describes art that looks like something recognizable. Nonrepresentational art
may deal with just the elements of art (discussed in Chapter 8). Another term
used to describe abstract art is nonobjective art — it doesn’t present recog-
nizable objects.
Before the turn of the 20th century, art imitated and illustrated real world
contents or depicted stories (usually about religion or mythology). These
highly realistic works portrayed heroic subjects, romantic ideals, and biblical
figures and dealt with perspective and re-creating real scenes. Around 1900,
the way artists thought about and produced art changed. Art became more
about concepts, feelings, political thoughts, reactions to the times, everyday
people and events, emotion, and poetry. After all, the canvas wasn’t real but
merely an illusion. How does an artist paint these things? Abstract thought
can only be represented by abstract painting.
In this chapter, I give you a brief abstract art history so you understand
where abstract art came from (and hopefully where you can go with it). You
also explore styles, see how to find abstract subjects from everyday items,
and think about putting more-significant content in a work of art. You get to
paint along with 19 miniature symbolic abstract paintings, as well as some
cool products to experiment with in new ways.
Cruising through Abstract Art
Movements: An Overview
After artists began producing the nonrepresentational art, the critics and art
historians were determined to categorize it. The following list runs down the
styles that evolved and the label each movement got:

 Impressionism: Impressionism began in France around 1860. Though
Impressionistic works don’t appear abstract to today’s audiences, they
were a major departure from conventional art in their time. Some of
Impressionism’s hallmarks include using pure paint pigments to repre-
sent light and color; producing art en plein air (“on location”); painting
everyday and natural settings rather than the religious and historical
themes common in the day; and creating works that seemed rough and
unfinished to audiences of the time. Impressionistic artists include
Claude Monet, Georges Seurat, Camille Pissarro, and Pierre-Auguste
Renoir. In fact, the name Impressionism came from a Monet painting
called Impression: Sunrise.
 Futurism: Futurism began around 1909 in Italy. This movement por-
trayed machinery, transportation, the Industrial Revolution, and speed
and used angular shapes and lines repeated in different positions to
create movement. Futuristic artists include Giacomo Balla and Umberto
Boccioni.
 Vorticism: Vorticism spun off from Futurism in England in 1914, largely
as a reaction to World War I. As the first movement toward abstraction,
its harsh, tortured, angular shapes depict movement. Wyndham Lewis
and David Bomberg were both Vorticists. The name stems from Futurist
Umberto Boccioni’s comment that all creative art emanates from an
emotional vortex.
 Fauvism: Fauvism was a short-lived movement based on a 1905 exhibi-
tion in Paris. The movement was marked by pure, bright colors; undulat-
ing line; and visible enthusiasm and passion. Fauvists include Henri
Matisse, Maurice de Vlaminck, Andre Derain, and Kees van Dongen. The
name was coined when one critique called the artists that produced the
works les fauves (“wild beasts”).
 Cubism: Cubism was centered in Europe from around 1900 to 1920. It let
artists think differently about the world and how they depicted shapes,
using angles to define form and space on flat canvas and showing the
many sides of an object in the same picture. Famous Cubists include
Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque.
 Abstract Expressionism: Abstract Expressionism was based in New York
between the 1940s and 1960s. It used dripping, throwing, and free appli-
cation of the paints to highlight the importance of the art materials. The
spontaneous creativity these techniques encouraged supposedly
released the subconscious into the art. Jackson Pollock, Franz Kline,
Willem de Kooning, and Mark Rothko were Abstract Expressionists.
 Constructivism: Constructivism began in 1913 in Russia. It emphasized
machines and technology in both sculpture and painting. Other hall-
marks include flat tones without shadowing; more-graphic, less-real
depictions; and an architectural, almost blueprintlike look. Construc-
tivists include El Lissitzky, Ljubov Popova, and Vladimir Tatlin; many 
of this movement’s artists were also involved with engineering, fabric
design, costume, building, and set design.
 Surrealism: Surrealism was a 1920s French movement. It focused on real
objects but with a dreamlike, fantastical spin; landscapes and everyday
objects became illogical, nightmarish, alien, and distorted. Salvador Dali,
Max Ernst, Frida Kahlo, Rene Magritte, and Joan Miro were all surrealists.
206
Part IV: Acrylic’s Versatile Styles 

 Minimalism: Minimalism was popular in the United States in the 1960s
and 1970s as a reaction to the emotional content of the Abstract
Expressionism that dominated the art scene in the 1950s. Most works
are monochromatic, use industrial components like fluorescent tube light-
ing or steel, and often have a mathematical base and little surface embel-
lishment (as the name implies). These works typically occur in series, with
more emphasis on the ideas and concepts than in the actual finished prod-
uct. Minimalists include Robert Ryman, Donald Judd, and Robert Mangold.
Studying these movements can help inspire you to create your own piece
that follows a particular movement or combines two or more of them into
something entirely your own. Check out Art For Dummies by Thomas Hoving
(Wiley) for more on these and other art movements.
Finding Abstract Ideas in the Real World
I like to look at something rather than just work strictly from my imagination.
I suppose I’m grounded by nature and the world I live in too much, or per-
haps I’m just a visual person and love to look. If the voices in your head are
sending you images to make into paintings, go right ahead — you are blessed.
But if you too need a visual reference, here are a couple of great tricks for
finding an abstract design to paint.
Creating a cropping viewfinder
Sometimes you need to focus to find inspiration. Cropping (selecting a small
piece within a larger piece) allows you to find that focus. You can use an L-
shaped view window to isolate a small area you want to paint; this device is
especially helpful for pulling small areas out of photos or magazine ads for
abstract inspiration. You can also use your window tool to look within your
painting for another painting. Perhaps you made a big painting that you don’t
like. Use your cropping window to pick out an abstract (or several) within the
big painting.
Make a window-cropping tool to find your view. By making two L-shaped
pieces of paper cardstock (something a little heavier than regular paper so
you can use it without it ripping), you can crop images, scenes, photos, and
even paintings. Here’s how to make your own cropping tool:
1. Get a piece of cardstock 8.5 x 11 inches.
You can make these bigger or smaller to meet your needs. I have a really
big set cut out of mat board to help crop big paintings when choosing
framing.
2. Fold it in half short edge to short edge.
3. Beginning on the fold, cut out a rectangle, leaving a 2-inch border on
all the open edges.
You can measure and trace out the rectangle first if you don’t want to
cut it freehand. Figure 12-1 shows this cut.
207
Chapter 12: Thinking and Painting Abstractly

4. Open up the fold to reveal a window with a 2-inch border of 
cardstock.
5. Cut opposite corners diagonally so you have two L-shaped pieces of
cardstock.
Figure 12-2 shows this cut.
6. Overlap the Ls to make a viewfinder.
You can rearrange the Ls to create vertical, horizontal, and square for-
mats and adjust the size of the viewing window. You can also adjust the
size of your view by bringing the viewing window closer to your eye
(larger view) or moving it farther away (smaller view). Figure 12-3 shows
how the final window isolates an area on a painting.

Pushing a shape out of shape
Most people look at abstract art and wonder how in the world the artist came
up with that image. Sometimes the artist doesn’t have a clue either, but some-
times he abstracts real objects into another look. The real object is pushed,
pulled, twisted, colorized, sliced, diced, and julienne fried until it becomes
nonrepresentational. The age of computer technology makes playing and
experimenting with images and using them as a guide for abstract artwork
even easier. You can do this with a pencil and paper too. You can push and
pull the object into new shapes by drawing it and changing the dimensions.
Try it by using a pencil and eraser or even paint the subject and move the
parts around, push the edges out, use the colors in a new way, and so on.
Take a favorite subject. It’s always more fun if you’re working with something
that really interests you. It also provides insight into who you are. I took a
photograph of a tiger (shown in Figure 12-4a) and used my computer as a tool
to help me abstract the image of my tiger.
Figure 12-3:

Chapter 12: Thinking and Painting Abstractly
Digitalism?
Many art shows don’t allow digital art entries, but
artists can (and do) still use digital technology as
tools to plan, refine, and improve their art (not to
mention inventory, save images, make prints, sell
online, blog, and a gazillion other tasks). Perhaps
this era will eventually be the Digitalism movement.

What I did on the computer to play around with my abstraction of the tiger
took a fraction of the time that it would have taken to paint rough paintings
of each possible option. In a few minutes, I have plenty of options for a paint-
ing (or series). I used Adobe Photoshop software for Figure 12-4b through f,
but many other photo imaging programs are available to manipulate images.
In case you have Adobe Photoshop and want to know exactly how I got the
images in Figure 12-4, here are the steps I took for each example:

Abstract Ways to Send 
a Message in Your Art
Many of the past abstract movements were based on thoughts and reactions
to their environments. The artists were communicating these reactions
through their art, and so can you. You may find that abstract art is an easier
way to express these intangible ideas.
Abstract art is all about sending a message. So how do you go about doing
that? You send messages with symbols, shapes, the direction you place lines,
your color choices, and the way you apply the paint. Of course, you can use
words, too. The method you choose to use may depend on how obvious you
want your message to be. Sometimes you may use low-key line direction to
convey your subtle message, and sometimes you may use a color sledgeham-
mer to force your obvious message home. Sometimes, your message may be
so subtle and subconscious that you don’t realize you’re conveying it until
you look at the finished product. The real treat is when an observant viewer
sees something that you were completely unaware you were putting in the
painting — it means you’ve touched someone with your art.
Putting words in a painting
Carefully chosen words and letters can say a lot about your message, and so
can the way you apply them. You can stamp letters, paint them, or glue on
papers with words. A stamped letter may symbolize a feeling: “RUOK?” for an
artsy text message. You can also scraffito (scrape) words, lines, and symbols
in the paint. A scraped word can convey a hasty, energetic plea (“freedom”)
or a modern, trendy directive (“be green”). The Pop artists of the 1970s and
1980s used words very effectively — look at the works of Jasper Johns and
Robert Rauschenberg to see how they communicated through letters and
words.
Looking at what various symbols 
and elements can communicate
I discuss the elements of art (dot, line, shape, color, pattern, texture, size,
direction, and value) in Chapter 8. But how you use these items can send
messages and set moods for your art. Colors play a big part in communicat-
ing feelings; head to Chapter 7 for more on what feelings colors evoke. In
Figures 12-5 through 12-24, I use these elements to demonstrate how symbols
and art elements can convey messages in abstract art. You may have a differ-
ent reaction to the piece than what I say it means. Everything is governed by
personal experiences, so that’s okay.
211
Chapter 12: Thinking and Painting Abstractly

The great news about abstract painting: You can’t do it wrong. Try different
colors and mix up any of the techniques. Get crazy and don’t forget to have a
good time. It will show up in your work. In fact, you can work out any mood
in an abstract painting. Purge. Angry? Use red with jagged line. Sad? Use blue
and drip the paint. Frustrated? Put a bunch of paint on the surface and scratch
energetic lines into the paint with the pointy end of the brush handle (just be
careful not to rip the surface — unless that will make you feel better). Make
several paintings at once. One can be drying while you work on another.
Then you can switch so that you don’t have to literally watch paint dry.
Paint along with me in the following figures to send some mini messages
using the elements of art. You can certainly copy or change the elements to
suit your own taste. You can do them in a miniature size (mine were 2.5 x 3.5
inches) if you want them to go quickly; you can even use them as artist trad-
ing cards (discussed in Chapter 4). Put your contact information on the back,
and you have an original painted business card to give out as a very memo-
rable sample of your work. I used one #8 pointed round brush for everything,
except for Figures 12-22 and 12-23, where I used a palette knife to apply the
paint (it leaves more jagged edges of paint). Bottom line: Make it fun. It isn’t
nearly as much fun if you just look and don’t paint.
In Figure 12-5, an explosion of line and color bursts from the center in an out-
ward direction. The warm colors of fire symbolize the idea of concentration
or sudden outburst. By changing the colors or values, the explosion can
become an implosion, focusing inward rather than exploding outward.
Paint zigzag lines to create excitement. In Figure 12-6, the color red adds to
the excitement as purple and blue balance the mood with a bit of calm.

Conflicting diagonal lines bring about feelings of conflict (big surprise) in
Figure 12-7. They can symbolize war, confusion, and hate. Army green brings
about even more strong feelings. Too much conflict can be harsh, so I added
a bit of yellow hope.
In Figure 12-8, balloons or open-ended ovals suggest buoyancy, fantasy, and just
general good feelings. The blue is a fantasy color to reinforce the floating feeling.

Spiral colors create generative forces that symbolize beginnings in Figure

warm energy like the core of the earth.
Rhythmic curves are graceful and youthful, and symbolize joy. In Figure 12-10,
I used blue because the curves can look like sky and clouds.

The mountain pyramid symbolizes dignity, stability, and strength in Figure

In Figure 12-13, the diagonal direction suggests motion, movement, and
action and puts the viewer a bit on edge. Orange also is attention-getting and
vibrant to reinforce the action.
Rounded arches can look heavy and severe but suggest strength and stability
in Figure 12-14. The arches are warm colors, but their surrounding back-
ground is cool.

Horizontal lines are tranquil and calm, suggesting sleep, rest, or immobility.

Figure 12-17 has rainbow arches or concentric half circles, which suggest
upward expansion, buoyancy, blossoming, and movement. The colors rein-
force the rainbow, but you can get the same effect from a limited palette.

A point-up triangle or diminishing perspective suggests distance, limited
expanse, looking backward, or nostalgia. The triangle is red and gets dark in
the front and brighter at its peak. It’s surrounded by cool colors, which make
the triangle pop even more in Figure 12-20.
An upward spray symbolizes growth, spontaneity, and idealism in Figure
12-21. Purple is a spiritual color.

Rhythmic horizontal lines can suggest sleep, calm, or laziness. In Figure 12-22
the cool colors of green and blue reinforce the calm feeling.
Upright flames vertically swirl to suggest aspirations, vigor, and spiritual
intensity. The colors of fire — red, yellow, and orange — heat up the mood in
Figure 12-23.

In Figure 12-24, a bent vertical can suggest sadness, weariness, and grief. What
other color can suggest the blues better than blue?
Don’t waste paint. Wipe brushes and palette knives on scraps of canvas
paper or paper towel. When you’re finished painting, take a paper and put it
upside down in your palette to pick up leftover paint. Keep a paper under
your small paintings so it catches paint when you paint to the edges. Don’t
throw these items away — let them dry and use them in a collage in Chapter
13. The abstract paintings in Figure 12-25 are my refuse papers from the 
previous examples.

Handy Products and Techniques 
for Abstract Art
Sometimes, an abstract painting can be inspired by new art materials, and
acrylic paints and all their mediums, gels, and pastes inspire much experi-
mentation. In Chapter 3, I talk a lot about paints and their mediums. Here I
show you how you can use some of the mediums, pastes, and grounds to fur-
ther your abstract goals.
A ground is a substance applied to a substrate (painting surface) and painted
on top of. Gesso is the most commonly used ground, usually to prime raw
canvas or panels. Pastes are thick white substances that you can also use as a
ground or to create texture. You can use these products on any substrate:
wood panel, plexiglass, paper, canvas, and so on.
You can apply the grounds and pastes with a spackle knife, putty knife, palette
knife, sponge, roller, or brush. Each applicator gives you a different texture.
Think of icing a cake if you want a very thick application. The final texture can
be smooth or wavy depending on your application. Some pastes make their
own texture, and some products can be sanded and sculpted after they’re dry.
You definitely want to finish these works with varnish.
Under it all: Starting with 
grounds and pastes
Abstract artists are always looking for something different and unusual. The
products listed here are inspirations in themselves for creating, experiment-
ing, and finding the unusual. Some pastes are absorbent and make great
watercolor paper-like surfaces to paint on. These pastes accept paint for a
soft blended background.
Crackle paste
Crackle paste does pretty much what its name implies: It leaves cracks in the
finish (the thicker the paste, the larger the cracks). It works best on a rigid
surface, because it may not adhere properly to a more flexible substrate like
canvas; apply it in the thickness of a penny.
Crackle paste yellows with age; if you don’t want quite that vintage of a look,
add some Titanium White paint to the surface. You can tint this paste with
acrylic paint — just don’t use a mixture of more than 20 percent paint to 80
percent paste, or the paint acts as a binder and prevents the crackle effect.
Be sure to seal it with varnish to prevent chipping and dirt buildup; I recom-
mend acrylic medium to use as a varnish (it will do the same job).
In Figure 12-26, I applied crackle paste to a mat board; I applied a very thin
layer on the left side and a thicker layer on the right — notice the smaller
cracks on the thin left side. I let it dry, and then painted with diluted acrylic
paints in Iridescent Copper and Iridescent Bright Gold. The paint accumu-
lates in the cracks, highlighting them.
223
Chapter 12: Thinking and Painting Abstractly

Absorbent ground
This ground is used to prime mat boards, canvas, and other boards to pro-
duce the texture benefits of watercolor paper with the rigidity of a board.
Your best bet is to prime the surface with gesso and then roll on three to six
coats of absorbent ground after the gesso is dry. You can use brushes and
squeegees, but these can create texture ridges, so be forewarned.
Fiber paste
Fiber paste was developed to resemble handmade paper. The texture gives
an earthy unique look to the surface for something a little different. It also
makes a nice background for a simple subject. In addition to acrylics, it works
well with graphite pencil, pastels, watercolor, and oil paint. In Figure 12-27, I
applied a smooth coat with a palette knife on a piece of mat board and let it
dry. I then painted on fluid acrylics in Quindacridone Magenta, Cobalt Teal,
Ultramarine Violet, and Iridescent Bright Gold. When the surface was almost
dry, I took a black watercolor pencil and drew the curved lines from edge to
edge. Because the paint was still damp, the lines bled a little as the piece dried.
Light molding paste
Like all pastes, light molding paste is very absorbent. It’s 67 percent lighter
weight than heavy molding paste (discussed in the next section) and makes a
surface that allows blending colors on top of the dry paste easy. This paste
works well for creating texture on surfaces like canvas, where heavier products
can have so much weight as to rip or fatigue the fabric (make it sag in time).
In Figure 12-28, I applied the molding paste with a spatula that left ridges and
let it dry. I then wet the surface with clear water and painted concentric cir-
cles of acrylic paint, using Titanium White in the center and moving outward
with Naples Yellow Hue, Pyrrole Orange, Quinacridone Red, and finally
Dioxazine Purple.

Part IV: Acrylic’s Versatile Styles 

Heavy molding paste
This paste really holds its peaks and is therefore great for creating big, thick
texture. You can play with it till it makes the shape you like. Sculpt it wet (you
have 10 to 15 minutes before it starts to set up and becomes too rigid to
manipulate) or wait and chisel it when dry. You can also sand the dry paste.
In Figure 12-29, I mixed paint (Phthalo Blue) with the paste on my palette and
then applied it to foam board with a palette knife, manipulating the paste into
wave shapes.

Chapter 12: Thinking and Painting Abstractly

Combinations
All acrylic paints, mediums, gels, and grounds are compatible. You can use
one technique in one layer and then another technique in another layer to
your abstract heart’s content.
For example, Figure 12-30 uses several acrylic products. I applied absorbent
ground to a mat board and let dry. Then I painted the surface with Quinacridone
Magenta and Iridescent Copper in a swirling blur. Next I mixed two drops
each of fluid acrylic paints in Quinacridone Magenta and Iridescent Gold into
one tablespoon of heavy molding paste. I used a palette knife and a leaf sten-
cil to apply the colored paste mixture and removed the stencil when dry.
After letting the paste dry for at least a couple of hours (your time may vary
depending on humidity and temperature conditions), I covered the entire sur-
face with crackle paste about a penny’s depth thick.
Over the top: Using products that go 
on top of grounds and substrates
Some mediums and gels are to be used on top of grounds, surfaces, and sub-
strates. Most of these items are clear; you can use them by themselves or
add acrylic paint to get your desired color.
Clear tar gel
Clear tar gel is a clear substance produced by Golden Acrylics to make long,
continuous strings. The higher you hold the paint from the surface, the skin-
nier the string of goo. It makes acrylic pour in a continuous line so you can
draw, squiggle, and drizzle out the paint. Scoop out clear tar gel with a
palette knife and drizzle it on your surface. It’s a bit difficult to control, but
with some practice you can draw and even make words. It stays a bit thick,
so it’s raised when dry.

226
Part IV: Acrylic’s Versatile Styles 

Color clear tar gel by mixing with acrylic paint in a container with a lid (you
don’t want it to dry out). You must let the paint sit for 24 hours after stirring
or mixing to allow the string action to work. Likewise, don’t shake up the gel.
Air disrupts the string action, so you have to let it sit for 24 hours to get the
viscosity back.
In Figure 12-31, I applied the clear tar gel over absorbent ground on mat
board. I tried some controlled lines to make a music staff and treble clef.
After it dried, I painted very diluted acrylic paints in Cobalt Turquoise,
Quinacridone Magenta, and Phthalo Blue in a very watercolor-like style (see
Chapter 10 for more on using acrylics like watercolors). When the first wash
dried, I put another slightly darker set of color in the music staff lines. The
clear tar gel separated the colors so they didn’t blend when wet.

Faux encaustic
Encaustic is painting with beeswax. It sounds fragile, but encaustic paintings
have been found from ancient times — after all, beekeeping and honey collec-
tion were figured out very early. Encaustic experienced a resurgence of popu-
larity in the 1950s through the work of artist Jasper Johns. Encaustic is a bit
difficult to work with because the wax must be heated to apply as paint, so
you have a hot plate, hot wax, and lots of opportunity for mess. But it looks
great: Layers of wax encapsulate layers of paint, and the thickness of the
layers lets you look down into floating layers of paint.
Now for the faux (fake) part. You can fake this process with acrylic gel. Paint
a layer of acrylic paint and let dry. Mix the amount of medium you need to
cover your area with a few drops of paint (for an accurate wax color, use the
formula later in this section) and apply a layer of this over the acrylic. Repeat
for three layers; any more, and you just obscure the bottom layers.
Recreate the faux encaustic technique in Figure 12-32 with the following
steps. It’s a pretty good knock-off of an encaustic painting, and it won’t melt!
1. Paint squares in Azo Gold and Diarylide Yellow acrylic paint and let 
it dry.
2. Use a palette knife to thoroughly mix about an eighth of a cup of
heavy matte gel with two drops of Iridescent Violet, two drops of
Iridescent Gold, and two drops of Nickel Azo Gold.
Heavy matte gel is a thick, transparent, not-shiny gel. If you don’t have a
measuring cup handy, you can eyeball the gel measurement — you want
a scoop about the size of a plum.
3. Apply a layer of this mixture over the dry paint and let it dry overnight.
Figure 12-32a shows this first layer.
4. After the thick layer (Step 3) is dry, you can paint a layer of acrylic paint.
This layer will look raised because of the “faux wax” depth in between.
5. Repeat Step 3 twice more to get Figure 12-32b.
Stamping
Rubber stamps are very popular. If you have one or two (or 10,328, like some
artists), you can use them in your paintings. They’re an easy way to create
repetition (an element of design in Chapter 8) for added interest in your
abstract work of art. You can also use stamps in layers or impress them in
thick paint to remove paint. I carved my own using stamp carving knives and
stamp materials found at the art store.
228
Part IV: Acrylic’s Versatile Styles 
Hollywood imitates art
Golden Acrylics formulated clear tar gel at the
request of the producers of the movie Pollock
(2000), which told the story of Abstract
Expressionist Jackson Pollock. The filmmakers
were concerned about the flammability of the oil
paints and solvents accurate to Pollock’s era on
the set with the hot lights. Golden created the
clear tar gel to give the film the dripping quality
of the oil paints without the fire hazard.

You can carve a stamp from a potato. Cut the potato in half so you have a flat
surface to carve. Draw on your image in reverse (careful with letters and
symbols — they must be backwards to stamp correctly) and then use a knife
to remove the potato area around the area you want to make the stamp.
Simple shapes are easier to cut out.
In Figure 12-33 I put acrylic paint on the stamp and stamped it on plain copy
paper. I rinsed the color off and added another color to the stamp, rotating
and placing the stamp in a different direction.
Planning Your Own Abstract Painting: 
A Few Questions to Consider
Fail to plan and you plan to fail. Even if you want to do a subconscious, wing-

Chapter 12: Thinking and Painting Abstractly

Having a few of these decisions made before you start frees you from stop-
ping mid-painting to figure them out; the following list gives you a quick
checklist of questions you may want to address pre-painting:
 What size painting do I want to end up with? What shape?
 What kind of painting surface do I need? Choose a canvas, board,
hardwood, canvas paper, or something else.
 What kind of texture do I want? Do I need a texture or surface treat-
ment ground? Check out “Handy Products and Techniques for Abstract
Art” earlier in this chapter for the lowdown on achieving texture with
grounds.
 What do I want to say? Sometimes choosing a project title before you
paint can give you an edge — it may give you a mood or direction to
work. For years, I painted without thinking about “why.” I just wanted to
celebrate beauty in nature. (I guess that answers “why.”) Now, I like to
give an artwork a story, even if it isn’t obvious to the viewer.
 How will I say it? Here are some considerations to help you get your
message across clearly:
• Colors: Bright and happy, dark and moody — check out the color
schemes in Chapter 7 to help convey your message with color
choices.
• Shapes: Round, square, angular, free-form — what shapes commu-
nicate your message?
• Abstract style: Balanced, symmetrical, and geometric or asymmet-
rical, undulating, and curvilinear (or a combination thereof)?
• Composition: How do I want to use the elements and principles of
design in an abstract composition? Chapters 8 and 9 can give you
ideas on design and composition, respectively.
• Words and symbols: Do I want to include words and symbols to
help convey my message? Which ones, and how do I want to put
them on the surface? “Putting words in a painting” earlier in this
chapter can give you some ideas about incorporating words and
symbols.
Project: Abstract Extravaganza
Paint an abstract project. Like all the projects in this book, you can follow
what I’ve done or change things to use the colors and canvas sizes you have.
I used an 8-x-10-inch canvas, but you can paint as big or small as you like.
About halfway through this project I realized the symbolism. I put little dots
in implied line paths following the other shapes left by the clear tar gel. The
paths and choices individuals choose in their own lives take each person on
a journey. Things that happen along the way make the colors and events in
life. (Come to think of it, maybe that’s not so abstract after all.)
230
Part IV: Acrylic’s Versatile Styles 

1. Gather a 1⁄2-inch flat brush, a brush with a small round handle end,
water container and spray bottle, palette and palette knife, clear tar
gel, and four analogous colors, plus any paint colors you want to use
as accents.
I used Phthalo Blue, Cobalt Teal, Ultramarine Violet, and Quinacridone
Magenta as my main colors and Interference Violet, Titanium White,
Iridescent Bright Gold, and Dioxazine Purple as my accents. You may
want to protect your painting area with newspaper. (See Chapter 7 for
more on analogous colors.)
2. Put colors out on your palette if you want to do any mixing.
Mist as needed to keep wet.
3. In the order the colors fall on the color wheel, apply a line of approxi-
mately one teaspoon of each color to the canvas, starting with the first
color at the bottom left corner and moving to the upper right corner.
I put Cobalt Teal near the bottom left corner, moved up and added
Phthalo Blue, moved up and added Ultramarine Violet, and then added
Quinacridone Magenta at the upper right corner.
4. Start at the bottom left corner and spread the paint out using the flat
brush to make crisscross brush strokes, blending the next new color
when you get to it.
In Figure 12-34, I did not blend the colors completely, instead leaving
brush strokes and color changes evident.
Figure 12-34:

231
Chapter 12: Thinking and Painting Abstractly

5. Let dry; you can speed up the process with a blow dryer or heat gun if
desired.
I used a heat gun, which is very hot. When paint is thick, the heat gun
boils the liquid trapped inside the dry skin on top of the paint, causing it
to bubble up and even pop and leave a 3-dimensional glob. Bonus! I
made a bunch of these because it was fun.
6. Repeat Steps 4 and 5 if necessary until you like the result.
I wanted my first coat to look more gradual and blended, so I did a
second coat to even out the colors.
7. Use the palette knife to drip and squiggle lines of clear tar gel onto the
painted surface; let it dry.
You can see this effect in Figure 12-35.
8. Paint the entire surface with a water-diluted glaze of Iridescent 
Violet and a stripe of white in the center and then pick the canvas up,
turning it so the paint runs in each direction until you’re satisfied; let
it dry.
Figure 12-36 shows my result.
9. Paint dots of white using the round end of the brush (as shown in
Figure 12-37).

10. Paint other colors of dots.
I painted gold dots and Dioxazine Purple dots. You can see the final
result in Figure 12-38.
Notice some dots are painted on top of other dots; it makes shapes like
eyes. Let the first dot dry before applying another dot unless you don’t
mind the colors mixing. Also, clean the brush end before changing
colors unless you don’t mind the colors mixing.

ollage is a term for art that uses papers and other items glued to a sur-
face in layers, with images that often overlap. Many materials can be
used, including acrylic paint, and there are some fancy tricks to make some
magic transfers happen. This chapter contains many project ideas and one
final project that you can customize to your own whim anytime.
What You Can Use in a Collage
Collage artwork has few rules and the opportunity for loads of experimental
discoveries. Figure 13-1 shows an example of collage artwork that uses a
copy of a pen and ink drawing, rice paper, glitter paper fibers, copper and
gold leaf, acrylic paint, and interference paint — all in one project.
Following are some recommended traditional items to use in a collage:
 Photographs: Color, black and white, photo booth strips, and so on.
 Printed materials: Postcards, sewing patterns, magazine clippings,
sheet music, maps, and so on.
 Small items: Beads, buttons, seashells, sand, charms, coins, jewelry,
thread, and flower petals.
 Sparkly stuff: Glitter, mica flakes, foil, and gold leaf. Figure 13-2 shows
gold and other colors of leaf (sold flat in sheets) and mica chunks that
come in a vial. Both materials are available in many colors.
 Specialty papers: Japanese rice papers, lace papers, and various beauti-
ful papers that have fibers, flower petals, textures, and threads embed-
ded. You can find lots of these fun papers at the art supply store.
If you can attach it to a surface, you can use it. Like I said, there are few rules.
You may have a great idea that I haven’t listed here — go for it!

If you use papers and paint only, you can use canvas, paper, or boards as a
collage surface (more on surfaces in Chapter 2). If you plan to use heavier
items or a texture paste, you want a rigid surface that doesn’t flex. Flexible
surfaces may cause the paste to crack and flake off. Heavy things in your col-
lage add weight to fabrics such as canvas; eventually, gravity wins — you can
even end up with a torn canvas.
Deciding What You Want 
Your Collage to Say
Before you get too deep into making your collage, you may want to choose a
theme to explore or decide on your reason for making your piece. Don’t worry

238

about being too deep — just exploring the art materials can be a theme. But
you may also want to communicate something. Do you have a message to
convey to your audience? By message, I don’t necessarily mean something
expressed in words. Art, of course, can go beyond words. How you say that
message can be as simple as choosing where to place items and what colors
to use. Composition formats are listed in Chapter 9 and may inspire a collage
pattern for placing your papers and paints. Choosing colors that go together
will make a cohesive collage. Review Chapter 7 for color patterns to choose.
Deciding on a theme or topic can help you figure out what to gather for your
collage. For example, Norma Erickson, an artist friend of mine, wanted to
make a memory piece about her mother. She collected stuff that reminded
her of her mother’s hobbies and activities: sewing items, photographs, maps,
and recipes. Her collage, shown in Figure 13-3, became a beautiful way to
recall and memorialize.
Here’s a short list of ideas to communicate other themes. Add any other
ideas you think of to the list:
 People: Family, friends, celebrities, gender, age, vanity, the human 
condition
 Hobbies: Bird watching, sports, travel, pets
 Politics: Pro or con, save the whales, stop the war
 Spiritual: Gratefulness, praising, good versus evil
 Emotions: Happy, sad, angry, satirical, cynical
 Elements of art: Color, shapes, lines
 Worldviews: Cultural varieties, nationalities, ethnicities
 Nature: Land, ocean, space

Chapter 13: Creating Collages and Transfers

Preparing Your Background Surface
The following steps will get you started with a surface, texture, and color
choice:
1. Choose the type of surface you want to use.
I like foam core board because it’s rigid and fairly inexpensive. Check
out Chapter 2 for surface choice descriptions.
2. Choose the colors you want.
What color do you want to begin with? You can use colored paper or
mat board — or you can paint the surface with color(s). If you’re using
acrylic paints to add color, get them out in your palette ready to go.
3. Create texture, if you want it.
Smooth surfaces work best if your collage involves transfers (which I
cover later in the chapter). Rough surfaces are also fine for collages; they
just may require a little more patience to get the glue to hold. Canvas, for
example, has a linen texture, and papers have various textures.
You can add texture by putting acrylic paint, gesso (primer), or paste on
the surface. Brush on thick paste and use a palette knife to scrape tex-
ture into it. For Figure 13-4, I applied a variety of acrylic paint colors
with my palette knife to the surface. Before the paint dried — which hap-
pens pretty quickly — I used the palette knife like a pencil and scraped
lines into the thick paint. I continued scraping lines in different direc-
tions, overlapping other lines till the paint was dry and wouldn’t allow
any more lines. This piece is pretty nonrepresentational (see Chapter 12
for more on the abstract), but you can draw shapes or write words to
make it more representational.

Part V: Projects for Different Surfaces 

Layering Your Collage
Collage implies that you work in layers. You can build up layers by adding paint
or adhering papers. After any background work you do is dry, you can begin
adding paint, paper, images cut from magazines, or other items to your
heart’s content. Another thing you can use is gesso. Gesso is what you typi-
cally use to prepare a surface for painting, but you can also use it as white
paint substitute — when diluted and applied to art, it can look like wisps of
transparent white. You can use gesso to tone down an area. Another way to
tone down an area is to layer on a rice paper. You can do this to any painting.
If you layer both paper and paint, your painting will be a “mixed media” cate-
gory, which only matters if you enter a juried art show.
Layering with paper
Visit any art store and you’ll find art papers from around the world. Some are
textured, tissue, colored, patterned, plain, glittery, filmy, and shiny. One of my
favorite papers is Japanese rice paper. It’s usually white and nearly transpar-
ent with bits of string-like fibers randomly throughout. It looks fragile, but is
amazingly tough.
You may even have some paper to use around the house: gift wrap, cards,
recycled bits of candy wrappers, and envelope lining. Look for acid-free
paper so the paper won’t yellow and become brittle with time.
Figure 13-5 shows a sampling of papers that can be found at paper or art stores.
Attaching and layering paper to your collage surface
Once you gather up some choices of papers, you are ready to do some gluing.
Follow these easy steps to attach and layer paper to your surface:
1. Choose an adhesive.
You may think you need glue to stick down paper and other items onto
the surface. However, in the interest of keeping all products chemically
compatible, an acrylic medium or gel is actually a better choice for
Figure 13-5:
Specialty
papers are
perfect for
collages.
241
Chapter 13: Creating Collages and Transfers

gluing items onto your collages. And because mediums and gels have
different viscosities, you can choose among them to find the best one for
what you’re gluing. (You can find details on medium and gel products in
Chapter 3.)
For example, a lightweight rice paper needs very little to glue it, and in
that case a soft gel works well. A seashell, on the other hand, is quite
heavy, so for that, you may want to apply a heavy gel with a palette knife
and embed the shell into the gel. You can choose a matte (frosted) or
glossy (shiny) finish. A gloss finish builds up the brilliance of colors and
makes everything shine. But if the shine is too plastic-looking for you,
you can lower the sheen level with matte medium or a matte gel. Both
mediums and gels are available with a matting agent added if gloss isn’t
what you want. With medium, you’re gluing, sealing, and finishing all
with one product.
2. To layer paper, paint acrylic medium or soft gel onto the area where
the paper will be applied, press the paper firmly into the wet medium,
and then paint another layer of medium or gel over the top of the paper.
Because these products are plastic polymer, you have just laminated the
paper. When dry, it’s impervious to water, dirt, and fingerprints. Note
that the medium or gel may change the color of the paper. And at first
rice paper becomes transparent and practically disappears. Usually the
paper reappears as it dries as a milky semi-transparent layer.
After you apply one paper, you can glue another over part of it or the
entire thing. You don’t need to let layers dry before applying another
paper. You can wrinkle paper for even more texture.
Decorating your own papers
You can paint paper and use it in your collages (or anything else you may dream
up). By painting plain paper with acrylic paint, you can make unique papers
at a fraction of the cost of buying specialty papers. You can use regular copy
paper or recycle other kinds of paper scraps. Here are some paper painting
ideas to play with (you may come up with others):
 Paint colors on paper and press bubble wrap into the wet paint. Try
different bubble wrap sizes for different effects. You can also paint the
bubble wrap and stamp the dots onto paper.
 Use a makeup sponge to dab paint over stencils and other fabric with
holes, such as net and lace. Dip the makeup sponge in two or three
colors and stamp the paint or pull the sponge to make interesting shapes.
I made the dots in Figure 13-6a with Punchinello, the material left behind
when sequins are made. Figure 13-6b shows how I dragged the paint in
swirls and arcs. I applied two colors of paint to the sponge — one at
each corner. I started with black paper for these examples.
 Use the techniques in Chapter 5 to make interesting papers.
Tearing papers
Tearing paper leaves an interesting edge. To get a straight torn edge with
heavy paper like watercolor paper, first fold the paper where you want the
tear. Crease the fold with your fingernail or a credit card. Open the fold and
fold in the opposite direction. Fold back and forth on the crease. Dip your
242
Part V: Projects for Different Surfaces 

index finger in water and run a bead of water down the fold crease. Carefully
tear along the fold. It should tear fairly easily because you have weakened the
fibers by creasing the fold; lining the crease up along a table edge may also
help to tear.
Tearing paper this way emphasizes higher quality rag cotton content paper
(used for watercolor or printing) by showing what’s called its deckled edge.
Machine-made papers have straight cut edges. (More paper definitions in
Chapter 2.) You can use scissors — even decorative cutting scissors — to cut
paper, but a patterned cut edge tends to look “craftier,” which may not be the
look you’re going for.
Printed paper tears differently if you tear toward you versus tearing away
from you. When you tear toward you, the tear has a white edge. Figure 13-7
shows some paper edges: a deckled edge on colored-blue watercolor paper,
and a printed paper. I tore the tiger-striped print toward me, making a white
edge, and the zebra print away from me, leaving the print-only edge.

Chapter 13: Creating Collages and Transfers

Layering in paint
Because acrylic paint dries so quickly, making layers fast is easy. You can use
paint in combination with paper to create layers. Paint allows you to add a
shape or swirl or something more elaborate. Save paints with a sparkle for the
top if you want the glitter to show, although starting with a metallic gold for
example and layering over it simulates a gold leaf concept where bits and
pieces can peek through. The following sections describe some of the paint
options available to you.
Transparent paint
Transparent paint is, as its name suggests, see-through. It influences what it
covers without obliterating it. You can make any paint more transparent by
adding medium or water to the color. Because medium is colorless acrylic, it
stretches the paint molecules out, making the paint more see-through.
Opaque paint
Opaque paint covers completely. You can get a color chart from the manufac-
turer that tells you which colors are transparent and which are opaque, or you
can do a comparison test on your own. It’s often worthwhile to do your own
test for comparison. Paint a strip of black acrylic paint one inch wide along the
length of your paper. After it dries, test your colors by painting a strip of a dif-
ferent paint color perpendicular to and over the black strip; if the second color
covers the black, it’s opaque. Figure 13-8 shows a sample comparison.

Metallic paint: Iridescent and interference
Metallic means metal colors: gold, silver, copper, and bronze. These paints all
add a little sparkle and glitter to your project. Metallic paints come in two
varieties: iridescent and interference.
 Iridescent paints incorporate mica flakes and powders to make the
paints sparkle and give off a luminescent quality. These flakes make iri-
descents reflect the entire spectrum of colors, giving your collage a bit
of eye-catching sparkle.
 Interference paints mess with the light waves and reflect only one color
at a time. However, different light conditions change the reflected color.
The paint shows up as different colors depending on what color surface
it is painted on. For example, when the color reflects off a white surface,
it may be an opalescent yellow, but when light is absorbed on a black
surface it “flips” to its complement color purple. (I prefer to simply think
of it as magic.) These colors show up better on black and dark surfaces.
Check out Chapter 3 for more on how interference paints work.
Test these colors on black and white paper as shown in Figure 13-9. Because
of the light in the photograph, you may not see the yellow color on white
paper. I painted some wriggly black lines with acrylic paint on white paper and
let them dry. Then I painted interference violet, which “flips” to a complemen-
tary yellow, in a pattern of dots and concentric circles. You can add these
magic colors to other plain colors to give any paint an added sheen. Sealing
interference paints with a gloss finish brings out their brilliance even more.
Working with Images 
and Direct Transfers
You can add images (photographs, magazine, photocopies, and so on) to
your collage in three basic ways:
Figure 13-9:
Iridescent
and
interference

245
Chapter 13: Creating Collages and Transfers

 Draw or paint an image (picture) on the collage. Of course, you can
paint onto the collage in any number of layers, in one spot or over the
entire area. (See “Layering paint” earlier in this chapter.)
 Cut (or tear) and paste an image onto the collage. Cutting and pasting
is usually what people think about when making a collage.
 Make a direct transfer of the image. Want immediate gratification?
Direct transfer is for you.
The following sections show you how to make a transfer and then provide
some examples, variations, and a word about keeping everything legal.
Making a direct transfer
To do it, you need a photocopy or a magazine page. You will ruin the picture,
so make a copy if you want to save the original. Any photo or printed image
will work, but thicker paper makes it more difficult to remove. Cheap paper
copies work best, but not ink-jet because the ink is water-soluble and will run.
Follow this method to make a direct transfer:
1. Make a good quality photocopy of an image you like.
The image on the photocopy transfers onto the surface, destroying the
original copy.
Photocopies from laser printers work better because the images are
made with toner, making them waterproof. Ink-jet prints run when 
dampened — such as when you’re gluing them down, for example.
2. Get a piece of watercolor paper about a half inch larger all around
than your photocopy.
Use any weight (such as 90#, 140#, or 300#) of hot press (smooth) paper.
Use the tear method if you need to reduce the size of your watercolor
paper (see “Tearing papers” earlier in this chapter). You get different
results with other papers, so by all means feel free to experiment.
A photocopy doesn’t use white ink in white areas — it just leaves the
white of the paper. Keep this consideration in mind when you’re choos-
ing a watercolor-paper color; when you transfer your photocopy, the
paper color shows through the image’s “white” areas.
3. Using a 1⁄2-inch flat brush, paint a layer of acrylic matte medium on 
the paper.
4. While the medium is still wet, place the copy face down in the medium.
If the copy slides, it will distort the image, so don’t wiggle it (unless dis-
tortion is what you want).
5. Press down on the back of the copy to make sure it contacts the
medium and squeeze out any air bubbles.
A credit card makes a good makeshift squeegee.
6. Allow the paper to completely dry.
Half an hour may be long enough depending on your humidity and tem-
perature conditions, but overnight is even better. If you’re impatient, use
a blow dryer or a heat gun to dry it faster.
246
Part V: Projects for Different Surfaces 

7. Saturate a cellulose sponge with water, place it on the back of the
copy, and rub off the paper.
Let the copy paper get saturated as you rub away the copy paper with
the sponge (or you can try using your finger). The wet paper peels up in
little pieces. When it’s gone, you should see the image that has trans-
ferred and embedded itself onto the watercolor paper.
8. Let it all dry again.
If the image gets cloudy as it dries, you haven’t gotten all the paper off.
You can rub it off with water and your finger. To keep the wet look, paint
a layer of glossy acrylic medium over the image.
The transfer technique gives you some surprises (hopefully pleasant ones).
Sometimes, bits of the texture disappear (maybe because the copy didn’t
make enough contact with the medium), creating an interesting effect. A
larger piece may look neat with some missing texture, whereas a small image
may lose too much. If you get something you don’t like, you can touch it up
with paint. The transfer in Figure 13-10 was a photocopy of a painting I made.
There are two transfers on different papers: one hot press watercolor paper
(140# weight 100 percent cotton-content paper; see figure 13-10a) and one
cold press (slightly rough texture; see Figure 13-10b). The cold press has
more texture, and the transfer doesn’t make contact as well as the hot press
(which is smoother). You can see by the size of my hand in Figure 13-10c that
this is a small transfer.
You can make transfers onto other papers besides watercolor paper. In Figure
13-11, I used a handmade tan-colored paper with a lot of flecks of stuff in it.
But first, I copied the painting onto turquoise paper and then cut it out, leav-
ing a turquoise frame — which is how I got the rectangle around the painting.
This technique is a great way to collage a border around the outside of your
piece. Next comes the transfer part where the copy will be influenced by the
paper it is transferred onto. This painting copy had a lot of “white” in the sky,
and the base paper showed through when the image transferred.

247
Chapter 13: Creating Collages and Transfers

Another technique is to brush thick medium onto watercolor paper; the thick
medium holds your brush strokes, which then texture the transfer. Figure
13-12 reveals this streaking, brush stroke texture.
You can also make transfers onto painted surfaces. In Figure 13-13 I painted
some swirly stripes of Diarylide Yellow, Dioxazine Purple, and Iridescent
Copper on foam core and let them dry. Then I transferred a copy of a char-
coal figure drawing.

Part V: Projects for Different Surfaces 

Transferring drawings
You can also transfer original drawings (not copies) into acrylic pastes or
mediums. The pastes give it more dimension and texture. Use the same
process as the copy transfer method only use a drawing.
Figure 13-14 shows a drawing that I transferred into fiber paste. Fiber paste is
white, so I added a Naples Yellow Hue acrylic to it first and mixed it thor-
oughly on my palette. I applied the colored fiber paste with a palette knife
onto foam core board as smoothly as possible in a thin layer. While it was
still wet, I put the drawing image side down into the paste and let it dry. Then
I rubbed off the paper with water and a sponge. I like the way the fiber paste
looks like an animal skin — it kind of looks like an old Western surface with
the stagecoach drawing.
Because I was in a Western mood, I did another drawing transfer into paste
on foam core in Figure 13-15a. After rubbing the transfer off, I painted over
the top to create the final product shown in Figure 13-15b.

Chapter 13: Creating Collages and Transfers

Making sure your collage doesn’t 
infringe on copyrights
Use caution (and restraint) when using magazine pages and other people’s
images. Photographs in magazines, on the Internet, in newspapers and calen-
dars, and so on are copyrighted, meaning they’re the property of somebody
else (usually the person who took the photograph). Using them as your own
is stealing and can land you in court. Obviously, collaging your own pho-
tographs is no problem.
Copyright extends for 70 years past the life of the artist. At that time, it 
falls into public domain (meaning anybody can use it royalty-free) unless an
estate renews the copyright. You can find plenty of public domain images 
on the Internet — search for “copyright-free images” or check out www.
dotgovwatch.com/?/archives/8-The-Best-Copyright-Free-Photo-
Libraries.html, which links to the public domain archives of several 
governmental agencies. Another site offering free stock photographs is
www.fduniversity.wetpaint.com, the Free Digital University’s Web site.
Some sites want you to buy their services and ask for a subscription fee.
If you don’t have access to the Internet, go to your local library. Many
libraries offer Internet access, not to mention books. Check out books by
Dover Publishing (also online at www.doverpublications.com) that have
public domain images. Another option is the kind of services newspapers and
graphic designers subscribe to that provide copyright-free images.
Did you know you can make a hologram — a photograph that looks extremely 
3-dimensional? This fake hologram is a fun technique. Mix a couple drops of
interference violet with a couple tablespoons of glass bead gel on your palette
and use a palette knife to cover a photocopy with the mixture in a thin layer.
Glass bead gel is white when wet, but it dries completely clear. This process
leads to a result that resembles a hologram when dry, as seen in Figure 13-16.

Project: Southwestern Cliffs Collage
This project pulls together a few of the techniques discussed throughout this
chapter to make a collage project. You get to layer paint and paper. You could
even add a transfer rather than painting on a subject like I did. You can dupli-
cate this project exactly or use the steps with your own theme. My project
uses earthy colors and is inspired by the cliff dwellings at Mesa Verde
National Park in southern Colorado.
1. Choose your surface.
I used stretched 140# cold press 11-x-14-inch watercolor paper. I wet the
paper completely and stapled it (a staple per inch all around) to 1⁄2-inch
gator foam and let it dry. I pulled the paper off the staples when finished
and can reuse the gator foam to stretch other paper.
2. Choose what you want to say and how to say it.
I chose a theme of ancient ruins in the Southwest. I chose a composition
format (Chapter 9) and the colors that I thought worked best.
I chose a forward cruciform shape (more on composition in Chapter 9). I
painted Iridescent Gold, Ultramarine Purple, and Azo Gold (see Figure
13-17) as a background in this shape.
3. While the paint dries, choose your paper and tear it into manageable
sizes and shapes.
The paper is your palette of colors to glue or collage onto your painting.
I chose papers that were similar in color to my paint choices. This was a
small artwork, so I tore the paper into 1 to 2 inch pieces and a couple
long skinny ones too. I placed the paper above the painting area where it
was easier to reach, as shown in Figure 13-18.

Chapter 13: Creating Collages and Transfers

4. Use a 1⁄2-inch flat brush to paint a swatch of soft medium roughly the
size of your paper, and then place the paper in the wet medium and
paint another layer of medium over the top.
You can glue the edges of the paper flat or leave them loose for texture
and depth (see Figure 13-19).

5. Put any final details in the collage.
In Figure 13-20, I painted Micaceous Iron Oxide details that were inspired
by a Mesa Verde Anasazi Indian ruin depicted in the photograph at the
top. It’s not an exact duplication but rather the essence of the ruin.

Knowing when you’re finished
Especially with abstract and collage works, you
may have a hard time deciding when your project
is complete. Artists often feel like they need some-
one looking over their shoulders to let them know
when to say, “Stop already! It’s done!” Overwork-
ing a few paintings may be the only way to recog-
nize this need on your own. After working on a
painting for a long time, it can become hard to see
it objectively; you may even want to set a timer to
remember to take a break and analyze the painting’s
progress. Step back and look at the painting from a
distance. Take a long walk to clear your head. Here
are some tricks to see the painting with fresh eyes:
 Look at the painting in the mirror. By showing
everything in reverse, the painting appears
different enough that you can notice whether
something is out of balance.
 Turn it upside down and stand back. Now all
the colors, shapes, and values are in a new
place. Do they feel right?
 Start a critique group. Find some like-minded
individuals and meet for coffee and critique —
having someone to answer to is quite helpful.
Create your own deadlines to get paintings
done and bounce ideas around. Someone else
may see something you don’t.
 Check your art supply store for gadgets to
help you view paintings unconventionally.
For example, you can get a reducing glass
(sort of a reverse magnifying glass) that
makes you feel like you’re looking at the paint-
ing from far away without having to cross the
room. Does the tiny painting have impact? Or
do you need a stronger center of interest?

P
ainting isn’t just for flat canvas — acrylic paint is versatile enough to
give life and color to almost any surface. For the projects in this chapter,
you don’t have to stick with the examples I choose — feel free to adapt them
to whatever items you want: pillows, t-shirts, plaques, wall borders, tiles,
notebooks, furniture, you name it. If it sits still long enough, you can paint it!
Now that you can personalize, customize, and elevate the common to
become art, you have no reason to keep ordinary, blah items in your home.
In this chapter I give you the exact colors I used, but as always you can use
any color combination you like. I tend to use the craft acrylic paints — the
ones that come in bottles — for these projects, but any acrylic paint works.
Wild About Wildcats: Painting on 
Wood and Clayboard
When artists paint things that are functional, the result is often called decora-
tive art. Decorative art includes items that improve the decor of a home — for
example, the wooden box of coasters shown in Figure 14-1, which sits on a
coffee table.
You can always elevate objects of decorative art to fine art and hang them on
the wall.

Wooden wildcat box
I found this nifty box with coasters inside first. Then I came up with the idea
of what to paint on it. You may go at it a different way — for instance, you
need something in a certain area to match your decor and go looking for the
item to embellish to match. You may also see something painted here like
these wildcats and adapt them to fit another shape or idea. You may think
these coaster designs would be better on pillows for your zebra-striped
couch. Go for it. The same painting steps will work on just about any surface.
1. Start with an unfinished box.
I got a 5-inch-square stampboard box kit by Ampersand (www.amper
sandart.com). The top of the box is prefinished with a smooth, white
clay-coated surface. Inside the box are four 31⁄2-inch-square sheets of
stampbord, which become the coasters. (I show you how to paint the
coasters in the following “Coasters” section.)
2. Round up brushes (1⁄4-inch flat, #4 round, and #000 liner), graphite
paper, a ballpoint pen, a palette, a water container, a permanent
black pen, wood sealer, and satin varnish.
Figure 14-1:

256
Part V: Projects for Different Surfaces 

3. Sand the all wood surfaces if needed, clean all wood surfaces, and
then apply wood sealer and let dry.
Note: If it has a claybord top, it doesn’t need sanding or sealer.
4. Using graphite paper, transfer the drawing in Figure 14-2 to the top of
your box.
Chapter 6 discusses transferring drawings with graphite paper.
5. Get your paints ready by pouring a quarter-sized puddle of each onto
your palette.
I used acrylics by Plaid in the following colors: 918 Yellow Light, 917
Yellow Ochre, 943 Burnt Sienna, 479 Pure Black, 515 Vintage White, 518
Peony, 486 Prussian Blue, 471 Green Umber, 671 Metallic Green, and 526
Soft Apple.
6. Paint the background.
A. Using the round brush, paint a palm tree in Green Umber and let 
it dry.
You can speed up drying time by using a blow dryer. Notice in
Figure 14-3 that I didn’t paint over the lettering with the dark
acrylic. Covering a dark color with a light color later is difficult
(although you can do it if necessary).
B. Paint just enough water to dampen the surface and give yourself
time to work with the colors before they dry.
C. Thin the Soft Apple, Metallic Green, and Prussian Blue with water
and paint the background (everywhere except the cat’s face) trans-
parently, using the flat brush for larger spaces and the round brush
for tight spaces, and let dry.
Figure 14-2:

257
Chapter 14: Cool Projects for All Types of Surfaces

You can paint over the palm as long as you do so transparently so
that the palm shows through the paint. Because the palm is dry, it
won’t move. Let the colors flow and don’t worry about keeping it
exactly like the example — you can’t do this step wrong. Have fun
watching the paint swirl around.
7. Use the round brush to fill in lettering.
In Figure 14-4, I alternated colors: Green Umber, Yellow Ochre, Burnt
Sienna, and Prussian blue.

8. Base coat the leopard face with a transparent wash of Yellow Ochre
(Figure 14-5); while that dries, outline the letters with a permanent
black pen.
9. Model the face by using the round brush to apply Burnt Sienna to the
edges and ears and around the nose.
Modeling the face (making it look rounded) gives it the appearance of
depth. Figure 14-6 shows the modeled face.

10. Paint the details.
A. Use the round brush to paint the nose with Peony. Paint the eyes
Yellow Light with a little Yellow Ochre at the top to make them look
round. Paint the spots black. Let these details dry.
B. Use the liner brush to apply black paint to outline the eyes and
nose. Define the chin and ears with Burnt Sienna and black.
Highlight the eyes, cheeks, and chin with white. Paint some white
whiskers and hairs. Figure 14-7 shows the finished box.
I painted the sides of the box in faux fur patterns, with two sides of tiger
stripes and the other two of leopard spots. I first base coated the sides with 
a transparent orange paint. I painted tiger stripes in black, using the flat 
1⁄4-inch brush. I added leopard spots by first making a thumbprint of Burnt
Sienna and then adding three irregular blobs of black on the edges of the
thumbprint.
After everything dries at least 24 hours, you can seal the painted surfaces
with a coat of satin varnish, using a 1⁄2-inch flat brush. You can also varnish
the unpainted sides of the box (more information on varnish in Chapter 4).

Coasters
How about some coasters to go inside the box? This project contains four
coasters: leopard, panther, tiger, and lynx. Paint each of their little faces simi-
larly to the box-top cat (which is also a leopard).
Detailed step-by-step photos are shown for the leopard’s face. Paint the pan-
ther, tiger, and lynx with very similar steps, but using similar colors and
appropriate pattern drawings. Using just the beginning and ending photos,
paint the other cats like you do the leopard.
Leopard coaster
Follow these steps to make the leopard coaster:
1. Transfer the drawing in Figure 14-8 using graphite paper and a ball-
point pen.
Head to Chapter 6 for more on transferring drawings.

2. Base coat the leopard face with a #4 round brush and Yellow Ochre
and then color dark areas, such as under the chin, with Burnt Sienna. 
Let dry.
3. Continue to develop shadows in the face, including the nose, eyes,
and mouth, with Burnt Sienna (see Figure 14-9). Let dry.
4. Develop detail areas, including eyes, ears, spots, nose, mouth, and
whiskers, using a liner brush (Figure 14-10).
Use the same colors as in the “Wooden wildcat box” project earlier in
the chapter.

6. For the background, swirl together Green Umber, black, and enough
water to make it as transparent as you want (Figure 14-12a).
7. Make the background around the face dark to provide nice contrast
(Figure 14-12b). Let dry.
8. Use a liner brush to paint white whiskers and hairs over the back-
ground (Figure 14-13).

Tiger and lynx coasters
The tiger and lynx coasters use all the same colors and steps as the leopard,
but the patterns and details change (Figure 14-17a is the pattern for the tiger,
and Figure 14-17b is the pattern for the lynx). The tiger needs some orange
paint, which you can mix with red and yellow or get a Cadmium Orange.
Paint the tiger and lynx in similar steps and with the same colors as the leop-
ard. Add some pure orange to the tiger’s base coat.
Animal patterns and faces are great subjects and can be painted on a lot
more than boxes and coasters. I participate in a couple of mask charity auc-
tions each year. The cats’ faces are fun to paint on masks and are always a
favorite with the buying public. The mask in Figure 14-18 was a blank white
plaster cast to start with. A first coat of acrylic gesso sealed the plaster, and
then I painted the face in steps similar to Figure 14-8. Because this mask was
a lion, he got more hair lines with a liner brush, and no spots. I glued a
beaded, fringed trim around the edge. After the painting was done, I painted
it with triple-thick glaze to make a shiny finish like ceramic.
Grape Art: Painting Grapes on a Violin
(Yes, Really)
Lately, the trendy thing is to get artists to paint on different surfaces and then
sell the finished items to raise money for charities. I think this year alone I
painted a trunk, a drum, several masks, Christmas ornaments, and the violin
shown in Figure 14-19a. I was a bit apprehensive about painting a musical
instrument, but the founding organization acquired an instrument that was
long past its playing prime due to a massive crack.

I chose to paint grapes on the violin because the lady who asked me to do it
had just had me paint her kitchen in a medieval vineyard theme. Figure
14-19b shows the matching kitchen. I gilded the edges of the violin with gold
leaf and sprinkled mica chunks into the leaves for added sparkle. This violin
was so worn that it needed no special preparation to accept paint, but if you
are working on a shiny varnished surface, like a violin may be, give the sur-
face a light sanding to provide some tooth for the paint to adhere better.
Painting grapes is easy, quick, and satisfying. You can add them to a wine
rack or personalize a bottle of wine to give as a gift:
1. Get a foam dauber.
You can get daubers in many sizes and brands at craft stores. I used
Plaid’s dot brush, a 1⁄2-inch sponge rubber circle mounted on a 3-inch
wooden dowel handle. If you can’t find these applicators at a craft or
paint store, you can just use a circle of sponge rubber without a handle.
2. Prepare your palette with two values (light and dark) of purple paint.
You can buy two purple paints or mix a red and blue you have on hand
to create your own purple and then lighten half of it with white.
Figure 14-18:

Chapter 14: Cool Projects for All Types of Surfaces

3. Dip opposite halves of the dauber in light purple and dark purple and
then place the dauber on the surface, wriggle it a little (as if fine-
tuning a radio dial), and lift it straight up.
To make oval grapes, pull the dauber in one direction to elongate the
circle (Figure 14-20).
4. Repeat Step 3 to paint a cluster of grapes.
When you repeat the next grape place the lights and darks so that they
alternate and show up to their best advantage — light side of one grape
against the dark side of another grape (see the example for placement).
5. Add greenery as desired.
Paint leaves with a flat brush as loosely or detailed as you want. Use a
liner brush to paint swirling tendrils.

Wall Art: Painting a Mural
Acrylic paint works well for murals. Last summer, some friends and I painted
the entire upstairs of a local church with Biblical scenes for a children’s area
(Figure 14-21a). Kids can hardly wait to go to church with those fun decora-
tions around. Likewise, kids’ rooms are great places to paint murals. Invite
the owner of the room to help you decide what images he or she wants to see
come to life. I recently painted some kids’ rooms — one child wanted a
cowboy on his wall, and his brother asked for a rock star in space. Without
their help, I would never have thought up those, um, combinations.
I once surprised a co-worker with a mural at work when she returned from a
trip to Tuscany. Rather than a blank wall, you now see an inviting Italian fan-
tasy (Figure 14-21b). You may want to check with your boss before you get
started, though.
The following steps give you the basics to get started on your own mural:
1. Make sure the wall is clean.
For a relatively clean wall, wash it down with soap and water. Invisible
oil from handprints will make paint not want to adhere, so it is important
to rid the wall of these. If the wall was painted some time ago, give it a
scrubbing. Wash it down with TSP (trisodium phosphate), available at
the paint store or sometimes in a well-stocked grocery store’s cleaning
section.
2. Prepare the surface.
Prime the wall and make sure any damage, such as holes, are spackled
and primed.
Any surface texture will work, but bumpy surfaces, such as rough con-
crete and textured wall, will make the job twice as difficult to cover.
Charge double or avoid them.

Chapter 14: Cool Projects for All Types of Surfaces

3. Gather size-appropriate supplies.
Because most murals are huge, you probably need to get bigger paint
applicators. Sponge rollers, sponge paint sticks, and synthetic sea
sponges are inexpensive and work well.
Cover the floor with a tarp for spills and drips.
4. Paint the wall one solid color in latex interior or exterior paint.
5. Paint your mural masterpiece like any painting only bigger.
6. Varnish your finished mural if desired.
I’ve never put a protective varnish on a wall mural when finished, but if
you want yours to last forever, you may want to roll on a clear acrylic
sealer. See Chapter 4 for more on varnishes. A good UVLS varnish is
always necessary for outdoor work to protect against sun exposure, as
well as the elements.
Art to Wear and Carry: Painting 
Fabric and Other Materials
You can paint the projects in this chapter on garments and other fabrics, as
well as on wood or walls. Just be sure to add fabric painting medium to acrylic
paint to ensure the painted garments remain washable. One of the main advan-
tages of using fabric medium is that acrylic paint makes a stiff film on fabric, and
many times the paint doesn’t absorb well into the fibers. The special medium
increases absorbency and creates a softer feel after you launder the material.
(I’m not sure why, but paint washes out if you deliberately paint it on without a
medium, yet it stains permanently when you spill it accidentally. It’s the law of
accidental chemistry, I guess.) Plaid makes a product called FolkArt Textile
Medium and suggests mixing one part medium to two parts paint. Golden
makes GAC 900 for fabric painting; use equal parts of this medium and paint.
After painting, you can heat set the material with an iron or in a dryer and
then wash it. Just follow manufacturer’s directions on labels for different
brands of products to ensure the proper steps to make your painting as per-
manent as possible. If the fabric is lightweight, iron it first on freezer paper to
make it flatter and easier to paint. You can also put your fabric in an embroi-
dery hoop to create a tighter surface to work on.
And just what garment should you paint? Dharma Trading Co. (www.dharma
trading.com) is a great source for blank garments to paint on, and its cata-
log reads like a how-to book.
Purses are fun to paint. They come in a variety of materials: fabric, wooden
cigar boxes, metal — you name it. I found some great blank wooden purses
made by Judy’s Stone House Designs (www.judysstonehousedesigns.
com). They’re a bargain and even come with a beaded handle. I transformed
one purse (style CBP-010) into a carrying case for my binoculars to go bird
270
Part V: Projects for Different Surfaces 

watching (Figure 14-22). On each side is a different bird — ones I saw my first
year of hanging out with Audubon types.
Another fun shape for Valentine’s Day (or any other time) is Judy’s model
CBP-009, shown in Figure 14-23. See how different it looks with different
designs? To paint the red heart, I first base coated the entire purse with gold
acrylic paint and then painted a layer of Plaid FolkArt eggshell crackle
medium over the whole surface. After the medium dried, I painted the purse
with red acrylic paint. As that layer dried, the red layer cracked, letting the
gold peek through. You can use any color combination. Just remember that
the first color becomes the color of the cracks. Finally, I painted the pinstrip-
ing (like on automobiles) by using a liner brush and a steady hand.
Always let the last layer dry before adding more paint. That way, if you don’t
like something you’ve just painted — like a wiggle that was supposed to be
straight — you can simply wipe it off with a damp paper towel and try again
without smudging the earlier layers.

Chapter 14: Cool Projects for All Types of Surfaces

This flamingo purse (shown in Figure 14-23c) is a fun project:
1. Remove all hardware from the purse.
If you want to keep the metal parts clean, remove them with a screw-
driver before painting. The purse in this example has hinges and a clasp.
By removing them, you don’t have to be so careful painting around them
(which never works, by the way). The handle on this purse isn’t
attached when you buy it. You can unscrew the end of it, remove the
beads, and paint them separately. After they dry, reassemble and attach
the handle to the painted purse.
2. Sand the purse, wipe away the dust, and cover it with wood sealer.
For a real professional finish, repeat this step a second time.
3. Base coat the purse, paint the inside, and let everything dry.
Using a 1⁄2-inch flat brush, I blended three colors of acrylics: Plaid FolkArt
656 Metallic Blue Sapphire on the bottom, Plaid FolkArt 481 Aqua in the
middle, and DecoArt Winter Blue on the top. I painted two coats to get it
as smooth as possible (see tips on blending paint in Chapter 11). Paint
the inside of the purse whatever color you want.
4. Use graphite paper to transfer the design in Figure 14-24.
Head to Chapter 6 for instructions on transferring drawings. Figure 14-25
shows the drawing transferred to the base-coated purse.

5. Paint the flamingos and let them dry (see Figure 14-26).
Using a round #5 brush, paint the light pink (Plaid FolkArt 633 Baby
Pink) and dark pink (Plaid FolkArt 319 Tickled Pink). Add Golden
Quinacridone Red to one of the pinks and paint the legs. The eye is a
thick dot of Delta Empire Gold. Paint the beaks yellow or gold.
6. Use a liner brush and black paint to outline the flamingos and waves
and then use black and white for the eyes.
Paint some C lines to represent the water ripples below the feet. Paint an
eye pupil on top of the gold eye by making a black dot first and a smaller
white dot on the eye.
7. Seal the purse with a finish.
I coated the purse by using a 1-inch sponge roller and some glossy
acrylic varnish. Because a purse has to stand up to a lot of touch and
abuse, you may want to give it two coats of varnish. Figure 14-23c shows
the final purse.

Rock On: Painting on Rocks and Stone
Need free canvas? Look outside your door — rocks probably abound. I
remember painting rocks as a child — we made all kinds of bugs and animals,
and it was a blast. Take a kid rock hunting for suitable, paintable rocks, and
you can enjoy nature and their imagination for hours. No special preparation
is required besides giving them a good rinsing to get dirt off. Figure 14-27
shows a little mouse that I painted on a rock. If you want to paint your own,
follow these steps:
1. Base coat the rock with acrylic paint.
In the case of the mouse, he was painted with white on the bottom and
gray on the top.
2. After the base coat dries, you can add details, texture, hairs, eyes,
nose, ears, mouth, and whiskers.
3. Glue a rubber-band tail on the back.
He makes a cute paperweight. He could be varnished for extra protection.
I also like to paint curled-up cats on big, smooth river rocks. They make great
doorstops or paperweights.
Painted rocks are great practice and sell well at craft fairs.
Heavy Metal: Painting on Steel
Any metal can also be painted with acrylic paint. You can buy metal shapes or 
metal furniture and paint them however you like. Walnut Hollow (www.walnut
hollow.com) recently released a line of metal products. Frames, lunch
boxes, and jewelry are just a few of the items you can choose from.
Most metal requires no preparation other than cleaning. If the surface is
really shiny, you can sand it lightly to give it tooth (a rough surface) that the
paint can grab. Let the neighborhood know where an artist lives by painting
your mailbox with your favorite subject. I cut up metal sheets into shapes
Figure 14-27:
A mouse

a rock.
275
Chapter 14: Cool Projects for All Types of Surfaces

using a plasma torch, sand-blast them, and either let them rust or paint them
with acrylic paint. Figure 14-28 shows some fish I made in this manner. I let
the paint flow and dry and then detailed it with spots. I used spar varnish for
a hearty outdoor final finish.
A couple of weekends ago my husband and I made this bench, shown in
Figure 14-29a, from the metal panels off an old John Deere beet digger that
was used to harvest sugar beets. I painted on a scene of him using the equip-
ment when it was in better shape. When finished the bench was coated with
gloss spar varnish to juxtapose the newly made bench in contrast to the
rusty, old metal. For your enjoyment, here are some steps to make this
bench:
1. Buy a piece of farm equipment for $150,000.
I like the John Deere green beet digger.
2. Use the equipment for 30 years to toil in the field digging beets.
3. Give up on farming and dismantle the equipment.
4. Cut the equipment up with torches into manageable sizes and shapes.
5. Weld the pieces back together using beet digging disks as the sides.
6. Use acrylic paints to create a landscape of farming sugar beets on the
back of the bench.
You can see a close-up of this landscape in Figure 14-29b.
7. Varnish with gloss spar varnish to make the bench shiny new and seal
in its rusty past.
8. Sit back and relax on the bench and be glad your farming days 
are over.

Odds and Ends: Faux Stained Glass,
Bricks, and Candles
The projects included here are more ideas to whet your artistic whistle. By
now you should be convinced that acrylic can be used on any surface, but if
not, here are some more options.
Faux stained glass
Thick acrylic paint peels off glass or a disposable paint palette when dry.
This property is great for cleaning the palette, but it can also make peelable
paint. That means you can make sheets (or skins) and cut shapes out with
scissors, or you can actually shape the skin on the palette. These skins are
flexible and waterproof.
This section contains three variations of skins. You may find them inspira-
tional for discovering many more variations. The first one, shown in Figure
14-30a, was done by simulating handmade paper by using fiber paste. I put
beads and confetti (which shows up in a printed photograph) in the paste
while still wet, but you can put something more subtle into the paste.

Chapter 14: Cool Projects for All Types of Surfaces

To recreate Figure 14-30a (or something like it), follow these steps:
1. Tape a 2-inch square on a disposable palette.
The tape works as a mask to keep the shape neat. I used white artist’s
tape, but masking tape or painter’s tape would work too.
2. Use a palette knife to thoroughly mix two tablespoons of fiber paste
with a pea-sized scoop of Naples Yellow Hue acrylic paint and spread
the colored paste into the masked-off square until it’s about the thick-
ness of a penny.
3. Embed small items into the wet fiber paste and then peel off the tape
while the paste is still wet.
I placed handmade paper bits, beads, and star confetti into it.
4. Using a 1⁄4-inch flat brush, pull the paste away at the edges in little
feathery strokes.
This technique makes it look like handmade paper with a deckled
(ragged) edge.
5. Let the paste dry — overnight if possible.
The next day, the paint sheet peels right off the palette.
Punch a hole at the top corner and tie a ribbon through for an ornament to
hang.
I made Figure 14-30b the same way, except I used glass bead gel and left the
edges straight, with no feathering. I applied more glass bead gel over the
embedded material to make them a little more subtle. I may cut up this shape
and make jewelry out of it.
This next skin in Figure 14-31 could be made in any shape. You could place it
in a window as a suncatcher.
1. Draw a columbine flower on the disposable palette with a permanent
marker.
2. Paint thick black acrylic paint over the outline using the liner brush.
3. Let it dry overnight.
4. Fill in the areas within the outlines with acrylic paint mixed with glass
bead gel.
Use white paint for the interior petals, purple for the larger outside
petals and yellow for the center. Paint should be the thickness of a
penny.
5. Let it dry overnight again.
6. Peel off the paper.
There are craft acrylic paints that mimic stained glass. DecoArt makes paint
that’s transparent. Put two colors in an area and use a toothpick to stir and
swirl the colors before they dry — your project will look like marbled glass.

Painted brick
Sometimes a historical building has to be demolished to make way for the
future. When this happens near me, I get bricks from the demolition and paint
the building in its heyday right on the brick. It makes a really nifty memorial
to the architecture. History buffs, building owners, and museums love to
have this type of memento on their shelves. No special preparation is
needed. Varnish when finished.
Painted candles
Waxy surfaces, such as candles, resist acrylics, but by adding candle wax
medium, you can make the paint stick to even wax. DecoArt makes a product
called Candle Painting Medium that allows acrylic paint to adhere to candles
and soaps.

To make your own painted candle creation, follow these simple steps:
1. Mix equal amounts of medium and acrylic together.
2. Prepare the surface of the candle by cleaning with rubbing alcohol.
3. Paint your design.
With this method, you can apply any of the projects in this chapter to a
candle or a bar of soap.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
T
he chapters here give you tips on quick ways to 
ﬁgure out what to paint and how to get ideas for 
more paintings.

Chapter 15
Ten (Plus One) Genres: Figuring
Out What You Want to Paint
In This Chapter
 Checking out different categories of paintings
 Selecting subjects to paint
A
genre is a general category for a style of art; typical painting genres
include landscapes, still lifes (arrangements of stationary items), and life
paintings (paintings of humans or animals).
Many artists specialize in one genre and become known for a particular specialty
and style; and as far as succeeding as a professional artist goes, that’s a good
strategy. However, it’s not for everyone — I, for one, enjoy painting everything.
In this chapter I give 11 examples of the kinds of things I usually paint. The
list is just to get you started, and you should certainly add to the list as you
brainstorm your own ideas. I have yet to run out of subjects to paint, and you
won’t run out either if you combine this list with your own interests.
Landscape
A landscape like the one in Figure 15-1 depicts any kind of outdoor scene,
such as a desert, mountains, a prairie, hills, skies, or a forest. One of my
favorite things to do is paint on location, also known as plein air; the French
coined this term (meaning “outdoors”) for the Impressionists after the inven-
tion of paint tubes allowed painters to take paint with them rather than be
stuck in the studio preparing paint fresh. Pure landscape artists paint only
natural elements and don’t include wildlife, people, or buildings.
Nature
Other outdoor close-up elements — like flowers, trees, even insects — make
great paintings. Because flowers interest so many people, florals (paintings
that feature them) are incredibly popular. Take extra time to make your floral
special with an interesting composition or exquisite detail so it goes beyond
being “just another flower painting.” (See Chapter 9 for more on composition.)
Go to the park and observe all the elements waiting to be painted: birds,

ducks, close-ups of plants — and don’t forget turtles, frogs, and lily pads.
Figure 15-2 showcases columbine flowers.
Water Scenes
My astrological sign of Cancer renders me a water sign, which may account
for my love of painting water. Rivers, lakes, ponds, waterfalls, reflections, and
any kind of running water are challenging subjects to paint, but remembering
a couple of tips can make them fun subjects for you, too:
 Still water reflects the sky and its surroundings. If the sky is blue, the
water will be too. If the water is surrounded by green and brown trees,
paint your water green and brown. Nature has just unified your color
composition for you!
 Rapidly moving water has a lot of white thanks to splashing. Because
white is the reflection of all colors, feel free to put a variety of subtle
color in the white for even more vivacious waves. Figure 15-3 gives you
an example of these painted churlish rapids.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Feeling land-locked? What’s a better subject than a seascape — oceans, boats,
and lighthouses? Seascapes provide you with infinite composition and design
opportunities — you can always find exciting colors and shapes in a marina.
Figure 15-4 is a seascape featuring boats at Fisherman’s Wharf in San Francisco.
Note how the horizontal line of the ocean contrasts with vertical ship masts
and lighthouses. (Head to Chapters 8 and 9 to read more about design and
composition, respectively.) Plus, artists love old, weathered subjects, and the
seashore provides that as well.
Weather
Painting isn’t just for fair weather scenes; look for all types of activity in the sky 
indicating seasonal change, wind movements, clouds, rain, and storms. If you
like a particular area, why not paint a series of seasons in the same location?
It may not be as exotic as the tropics, but plants near you still undergo changes
throughout the year. Figure 15-5 shows a winter scene at the confluence of
Figure 15-4:
A seascape.
Figure 15-3:

285

the Platte and Poudre Rivers. Or paint the same scene at different times of
the day, observing how the lighting changes, like Monet did by painting a hay-
field at various intervals from sunrise to sunset.
Fantasy
Perhaps you have an interest in another realm that features winged creatures,
aliens, dragons, mermaids, unicorns, or angels (or all of the above). Paint it!
The great thing about fantasy painting: No one can tell you that what you
painted isn’t what the subject looks like — it’s your fantasy. The angel symbol
in Figure 15-6 was an attempt to depict beauty, femininity, and a guardian spirit.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Abstract
Sometimes you need no subject at all. Just enjoying color, shape, and other art
elements is enough for nonrepresentational, experimental, and collage works
of art. And abstract work is more popular than you may think: When a local
psychiatric hospital was looking for artwork, it didn’t want recognizable sub-
jects that may trigger patients’ painful memories. Instead, it sought calm
abstracts. The inspiration of Figure 15-7 was as simple as fall leaves. Some of
the leaves are realistic, but the rest of the painting is about color, shape, and
texture.
People
Want more life in your painting? Add people and crowds to the scene. Street
scenes without people look abandoned. Faces and bodies in artwork seem to
intrigue viewers; adding some to your work may attract more sets of eyes. The
tuba player in Figure 15-8 caught my eye and made a great study of reflections.
A recognizable painting of a person is called a portrait (though you can also
paint portraits of other recognizable subjects, such as houses or pets). Nudes
are called life drawings — if you take a life drawing class, be prepared for
some skin. Learning to draw people is difficult. If you can draw them, you can
draw anything. If you really enjoy people, try a figure painting/drawing class
(and check out Figure Drawing For Dummies by Kensuke Okabayashi [Wiley]).

Animals
I love wildlife. I spend lots of hours observing animals and birds in the wild,
zoos, aquariums, sanctuaries — just about anywhere I can watch and capture
pictures of them. I painted the giraffe in Figure 15-9 at the zoo, but generally
speaking, animals are often easier to paint from photographs because they’re
pretty active models in person (okay, in animal).

Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Storytelling
If you tell a story in your painting, you may be making a move from fine art to
illustration. Art versus illustration is a fun debate; personally, I think the great
illustrators of the past and present are some of the finest artists around. I also
believe involving the viewer by telling a story makes your painting more inter-
esting, so definitely consider exploring this genre. What story should you tell?
History, the military, mythology, religion, royalty, the human condition, hunting — 
it can be just about anything. For example, the Civil War soldiers in Figure 15-10
tell the story of western expansion in the 1800s. I actually observed these reen-
actment soldiers in South Dakota and loved their look. Use your imagination; if
you need a jump-start, try to illustrate something from a favorite book.
Architecture
Another favorite subject of mine is manmade constructions: barns,
cityscapes, bridges, cabins, and cottages. If you’re ever unsure whether it’s
okay to use something in your art, just ask; the owner is usually flattered, but
that’s not always the case. For instance, a photographer landed in hot water
for photographing the Music Hall of Fame in Detroit and then printing and
selling posters to the public. The owners of the building argued that they had
paid for the design and owned the likeness of the building, so the photogra-
pher shouldn’t be able to profit from it. Ultimately, though, a court decided
that the artist could use anything in view to make an artwork. I, for one,
always ask permission to paint on location.
A public building like the Greeley Courthouse shown in Figure 15-11 is no prob-
lem for permission and a place of civic pride for a community. The problem
comes in the complexity, which is also part of its attraction. I waited a long
time before I was ready to tackle this magnificent building. Choose buildings

history.
289
Chapter 15: Ten (Plus One) Genres: Figuring Out What You Want To Paint

that interest you and you feel up to painting. Start with simple cabins and
cottages and work your way up to public monoliths.
Combinations
Sometimes a painting gets it all — a person riding a horse to the barn in a
beautiful landscape near a stream — and that’s okay. You certainly should
make such combination paintings, mixing whatever genres you like. (Figure
15-12 combines human, animal, and fantasy elements.) Often, creating a com-
bination painting is a matter of necessity — your landscape painting needs a
center of interest, so you add a barn or an elk. In fact, you may find that you
have a hard time not putting a building in a landscape. Adding flora and fauna
can also help you pump up the detail.

Ten Ways to Get the Creative
Juices Flowing
In This Chapter
 Getting a jump start when your inspiration stalls out
 Moving your skill up to the next level
 Observing other artists and evaluating their success
W
hether you’re just beginning your art career, looking for inspiration, or
wanting to grow as an artist, the tips in this chapter are great ways to
kick your painting up a notch. And who doesn’t want that?
Paint What You Know (And Know 
What You Paint)
I’ve always heeded the old piece of wisdom “paint what you know.” It’s good
advice. To make an interesting painting, you need to be interested in your
subject matter. Love to cook and eat? Make a still life and include your favorite
foods. Like sports? Try painting a dramatic moment in a game or match. Enjoy
the outdoors? Paint a landscape of the area you admire. Do your homework
and research your topics — it should be fun because, after all, you’re already
interested, right? If you paint something realistic inaccurately, you can be sure
some expert will happily point it out to you someday. If that happens, don’t be
offended; instead, ask her more questions and learn further. She may review
your next painting — or buy it. Meet other people by joining an interest group
and then commemorate your new knowledge with your art. That way, you
become the expert and share your knowledge with your audience.
Take a Class
Whatever your price range or time commitment, there’s a class for you. Find
an artist you like who gives art lessons; check out art supply stores and
cooperative galleries to find art teachers. A community college or recreation
center in or near your town may also offer low-cost classes, and the Internet
has loads of online classes if you live too far away to travel to a class. A
weekly class gives you guaranteed paint time, forces you to concentrate, and
makes you accountable to others to produce art. Another option is a day-long

or week-long workshop — they’re going on all the time, all over the world.
The Artist’s Magazine puts out an annual issue listing art workshops all over
the world. My best learning came from week-long workshops by well-known
artists. On the higher end of the scale, I often treat myself to a “painting 
vacation” by learning from someone I admire. It boosts my skill level and
gives me something to look forward to all year.
You may want to be a great painter, but taking as many drawing classes as you
can is also a great idea. All art starts with drawing, and it’s a skill that needs
constant practice and refinement. Draw every day. Fill up sketchbooks. Jot
down ideas for paintings. Collect shapes, figures, and other bits and pieces that
you can use in a painting. Whatever your interests are, sketch them in your
book. Later, when you need ideas, go through your sketchbook for inspiration.
Travel
Change is good, and traveling forces a change in environment. You get
exposed to different stimuli — new landscapes bring new ways of seeing.
Often artists are so inspired by their new surroundings that they want to
make travel paintings to commemorate the trip. Boats fascinate a desert
dweller, and cactus may be big news to an East Coast resident. Sometimes
just seeing with new eyes makes you observe things that others who see the
object daily take for granted.
Take lots of photos when you travel so you can continue on your new paint-
ing path when you get back home.
Look Close to Home
You don’t have to travel to find something interesting to paint. Some award-
winning paintings have featured subjects found in the artist’s home; I remember
a national award-winner that was a picture of the artist’s bathroom, featuring
the sink and antique floor tile. Talk about painting what you know — who
knows your place of residence better than you do? My best sellers tend to be
paintings of my own town, and not just because I live in a tourist mecca
either. Art patrons also want what they know.
Artists have made places famous just by rendering them in great artworks.
Cities and towns are hip to this phenomenon and often invite artists to come
paint in their area, hosting plein-air (a French art term meaning “outdoors”)
competitions. These contests are a great way to promote places. One of the
best-known and highest-paying competitions is the Paint the Parks100 competi-
tion sponsored by PaintAmerica, which allows you to choose any of America’s
390 national parks as your subject matter. The contest chooses the 100 paint-
ings that best represent the beauty and significance of the parks. The entry fee
is $40 or $50 (depending on when you enroll), but the grand prize is $10,000.
The Grand Canyon Association also makes a purchase award of $4,000. The
contest features a miniature competition, too — these paintings must be less
than 180 square inches (length multiplied by width). Top miniature prize is
$5,000. The paintings go on a national tour, so watch for an exhibition near you.
You can find all the rules and even the exhibit online at paintamerica.org.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Work in a Series
A series is a group of paintings exploring the same theme. Do you like one of
your paintings? Make another one that’s similar, and then another one. By
working in a series, you’re able to work deeper on a theme — the first piece
may present the expected approach to the topic, but the subsequent ones can
explore and stretch to something unexpected, until you may do one that’s a
prize-winner. How many paintings do you need for a series? Well, one is a
masterpiece (naturally), two is a diptych, three is a triptych, and because I can’t
think of a name for four or more I’ll say four is a series. Technically, it’s a dip-
tych or triptych when the two or three paintings are meant to be hung together
as one whole painting, so you could have a miniseries of two or three also.
Buy New Art Supplies
Sometimes inspiration hides at the art supply store. New paper, a new brush,
professional paint in a new color, or trying out a new medium can all be cata-
lysts to get some creative juices flowing. Go to the supply store and just see
what’s new. Ask the manager what the latest exciting trend is. Stores in larger
cities often have free programs and newsletters to share ideas and demon-
strate new products.
I recommend supporting your local art store first — keep them in business.
But if you don’t have an art supply store nearby, look for supplies on the
Internet. Some online stores great for both supplies and information include
www.dickblick.com, www.jerrysartarama.com, www.meininger.com,
and www.cheapjoes.com. Subscribe to an art magazine like American Artist
or International Artist and read the ads in the classified section.
Join a Club
Look for an art association or guild that meets monthly. These groups often
have Web sites and newsletters that are filled with opportunities for learning.
Don’t be shy — get involved. Such clubs often have meetings that offer
demonstrations, critiques, and group exhibits. A program like that may give
you a new idea, teach a new technique, or just make you think in a new way.
Meeting with other artists also gives you like-minded folks to go to museums
or art openings with or just bounce ideas off.
Take Video Lessons
You can enlist a top artist to come teach a private lesson in your own home at
any time and on any budget. All you have to do is get a video, DVD, podcast, or
YouTube clip of an art lesson — you can watch, rewind and rewatch, paint along
with, and fast forward through it as much as you want. Most libraries also have
art programs you can check out, and many art clubs own their own art video
libraries. The Internet of course sells countless art videos from art magazines,
293
Chapter 16: Ten Ways to Get the Creative Juices Flowing

art supply manufacturers, and artists. Several television networks offer art how-
to shows that you can watch on the air or often purchase copies of. You can find
some excellent DVDs at Creative Catalyst Productions (www.ccpvideos.com).
Artists Network (www.artistsnetworkshop.com) is also a great resource.
You can subscribe to access videos for six months at a time or purchase them
permanently.
Buy or Borrow Books
Books are great sources of learning. As your skills progress, you can reread
and absorb different parts of each lesson all over again. You can read the lovely
book in your hands quickly, but give yourself time to absorb and practice its
information; after all, I spent 30 years acquiring the stuff I’ve included here.
I love to look at pictures in books. Sometimes I even read one. Visual people
need visual stimulation with lots of pictures. Study the compositions, value pat-
terns, and techniques. Start a loaner library with your local artists. If your club
doesn’t want to house books, most libraries have great art books. If your library
doesn’t have a good art section, see if they would like some donations. Have the
local arts group give them some books each year to build the collection.
A wonderful source of art books is North Light books. They offer a club to
join for discounted books at www.northlightbookclub.com.
Visit Galleries and Museums
See more art, always. Observe what came before you by visiting museums,
and keep tabs on what’s happening now at galleries. Both places are full of
people who love to talk about their passion for art. Analyze pieces of art that
you like and try to determine why you like them. What design elements did
the artist choose to make dominant? What color schemes did he employ? Did
he add a center of interest or use a composition value pattern? Why did a par-
ticular artwork catch your attention from across the gallery? Hopefully, you
see something that gives you a new perspective and inspires you to create.
Many areas offer a regular event — often on the first Friday of each month —
for patrons to visit galleries for extended hours and treats. Gather a group of
friends and fellow artists and make it a regular field trip.
