Preface to the 1996 Edition
As the basic principles of EDM instruments have changed little 
since the third edition of 1990, there was no need for significant 
changes. This edition differs from its predecessor in that it contains 
corrections of a number of errors and misprints, totally revised 
tables in Appendices D, E and F and a new note in Section 2.4.3 on 
the introduction of the new temperature scale in 1990. The author 
is indebted to the many readers who reported the many small errors 
and misprints. T. Black, H. Buchanan, R. Da-Col, R. Kochle, P. H. 
Lam, J. Nolton, J.R. Pollard and A. Quade were particularly 
helpful. All known errors have been corrected. The assistance pro­
vided by most manufacturers (or their agents) with the updating of 
the tables with the instrument data was greatly appreciated.

Preface
The book has evolved from the author’s continuing teaching of the 
subject and from two editions of a text of the same title. The first 
edition was published in 1978 by the School of Surveying, Universi­
ty of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia. Like its predecessors, this 
totally revised third edition is designed to make the subject matter 
more readily available to students proceeding to degrees in Survey­
ing and related fields. At the same time, it is a comprehensive refer­
ence book for all surveyors as well as for other professionals and 
scientists who use electronic distance measurement as a measuring 
tool. Great emphasis is placed on the understanding of measure­
ment principles and on proper reduction and calibration pro­
cedures. It comprises an extensive collection of essential formulae, 
useful tables and numerous literature references.
After a review of the history of EDM instruments in Chapter 1, 
some fundamental laws of physics and units relevant to EDM are 
revised in Chapter 2. Chapter 3 discusses the principles and applica­
tions of the pulse method, the phase difference method, the Doppler 
technique and includes an expanded section on interferometers. The 
basic working principles of electro-optical and microwave distance 
meters are presented in Chapter 4, with special emphasis on modu- 
lation/demodulation techniques and phase measurement systems. 
Important properties of infrared emitting and lasing diodes are 
discussed.
Various aspects of the propagation of electromagnetic waves 
through the atmosphere are treated in Chapter 5, such as the range 
of EDM instruments, phase and group refractive indices, coefficient 
of refraction, measurement of temperature, pressure and humidity 
and different approaches to the problem of the determination of 
ambient refractive indices. Chapter 6 continues with the derivation 
of first velocity corrections for electro-optical and microwave dis­
tance meters and concludes with the second velocity correction and 
a review of more refined methods of velocity corrections.
All equations for the geometrical reduction of electronic dis­
tance measurements to the spheroid (or to sea level) are derived in 
Chapter 7, both, for reductions using station elevations and for 
reductions using measured zenith angles. Numerical examples are 
given. Error analyses indicate critical parameters. Additional correc­
tions and computations are discussed in Chapter 8. This chapter in­
cludes numerous supplementary reductions which are required in 
VII

certain cases as well as the computation of height differences from 
measured zenith angles for EDM tacheometry and EDM height 
traversing, the derivation of the coefficient of refraction and eye- 
to-object corrections for distances and zenith angles.
A description of four typical distance meters is given in Chapter 
9, together with a discussion of classification criteria and special 
features of modern electro-optical distance meters. Chapter 10 
presents a number of different types of EDM reflectors and many 
important aspects of reflectors such as the reflector constant (and 
its computation) and the effect of misaligned reflectors on distance 
and angle measurements. Chapter 11 discusses the properties of 
NiCd rechargeable batteries. A review of other suitable power 
sources has been added.
Chapter 12 gives a comprehensive introduction into major errors 
of electro-optical distance meters, including additive constant, short 
periodic errors, scale errors and non-linear distance-dependent er­
rors. The different sources of these errors are indicated, where possi­
ble. A mathematical model covering most known error patterns is 
given. The last chapter provides the neccessary information on how 
errors can be determined by the user of a distance meter. Included 
in Chapter 13 is a large section on the calibration of distance meters 
on EDM baselines. The geometric design of three types of EDM 
baselines, the physical design, the measurement and analysis pro­
cedures and the determination of the baseline lengths are discussed. 
Other sections describe the calibration procedures on cyclic error 
testlines and the measurement of the modulation frequency and 
discuss the accuracy specifications of distance meters.
The appendices include an improved refractive index formula for 
high precision measurements as well as tables on saturation water 
vapour pressures (versus temperature), a standard atmosphere (tem­
perature and pressure versus elevation), critical dimensions of reflec­
tors, important data of electro-optical distance meters (for correc­
tion and calibration purposes) and technical data of a selection of 
short range distance meters, pulse distance meters and long range 
distance meters.
The text uses SI units for all quantities but pressure. Pressures 
are stated in millibars (mb) rather than the equivalent unit hPa (hec­
topascal). However, common conversion rates to and from non-SI 
units are given. Most equations are numbered for easier reference. 
The definitions of parameters of equations are repeated below the 
relevant final formulae in order to facilitate the use of the book as 
a compendium of formulae. The more important symbols are also 
included in the list of symbols at the beginning of the text.
The writing of this third edition was suggested by E K. Brunner. 
His continued encouragement and valuable advice was highly ap­
preciated. The author is further indebted to F.K. Brunner, K. 
Furuya (Tokyo Optical Co. Ltd.), K. Giger (Wild Leitz Ltd.),
VIII

R. Nunlist and P. Kiefer for their valuable comments on Sections 
5.9, 9.2.2, 9.2.3, 9.2.1 and 10.2.5.2, respectively, and to C. Rusu for 
the preparation of a number of diagrams. The book benefited great­
ly from the comments made by many readers with respect to the two 
earlier editions and from the assistance provided by colleagues in 
editing these earlier editions. The cooperation of manufacturers or 
their Australian agents with the collection of the technical data for 
the tables in the appendices is gratefully acknowledged as is the 
competent support by the staff of the Springer-Verlag.

Historically, the development of electro-optical distance meters evolved from 
techniques used for the determination of the velocity of light. Fizeau determined 
the velocity of light in 1849 with his famous cogwheel modulator on a line of 
17.2 km length: Light passed through the rotating cogwheel, travelled to a mirror 
at the other end of the line, was reflected and returned to the wheel where the 
retu n light was blocked off by the teeth at high revolutions of the wheel. Fizeau’s 
experiment employed for the first time the principle of distance measurement with 
modulated light at high frequencies. Later, Foucault employed a rotating mirror 
in 1862 and Michelson (1927) a rotating prism in 1926 for similar experiments. 
According to Zetsche (1979), the first electro-optical distance meter was developed 
by Lebedew, Balakoff and Wafiadi at the Optical Institute of the U.S.S.R. in 1936. 
In 1940, Hiittel published a technique for the determination of the velocity of 
light using a Kerr-cell modulator in the transmitter and a phototube in the 
receiver. This inspired the Swedish Scientist E. Bergstrand to design the first 
“Geodimeter” (for geodetic distance meter) for the determination of the velocity 
of light in 1943. The first commercial instrument (Geodimeter NASM-2) was pro­
duced by the Swedish company AGA and became available in 1950. With the ear­
ly Geodimeters, longer distances could only be measured at night. An important 
development was the introduction of the heterodyne technique to electro-optical 
distance meters by Bjerhammar in 1954, which enabled the execution of more ac­
curate phase measurements at more convenient low frequencies (Bjerhammar 
1971). The first instrument to employ the heterodyne principle was the 
Geodimeter Model 6 A. Subsequently, the principle was employed in distance 
meters of all makes. The (laser) Geodimeter with the longest range (60 km), the 
Model 8, was released in 1968. It has been used widely in high order geodetic net­
works throughout the world.
The use of reflected radiowaves for distance measurements was suggested as 
early as 1889 by N. Tesla. A first patent application for an electromagnetic dis­
tance meter (by Lowy) was made in 1923. The first radiowave distance meter 
(based on the interference principle) was built in 1926 by Schegolew, Boruschko 
and Viller in Leningrad, USSR (Zetsche 1979). A radiowave distance meter using 
the phase measurement principle was developed by T. L. Wadley at the National 
Institute of Telecommunications Research of South Africa in 1954. It became 
available under the trade name Tellurometer in 1957 and was immediately 
employed for long-range traversing in the first-order geodetic control of the 
Australian continent. Its range exceeded that of the early Geodimeters and it was 
therefore in much wider use until HeNe lasers were introduced in EDM in the late 
1960’s. The first light-weight microwave distance meter (Tellurometer CAI000) 
became available in 1972.
1

Prototypes of short-range distance meters incorporating infrared emitting 
diodes appeared in the mid-1960’s (Tellurometer MA 100 in 1965; Zeiss SM11 in 
1967). Commercial release of these instruments occurred in the late 1960’s 
(Wild/Sercel Distomat DUO in 1968; Tellurometer MA 100 in 1969; Zeiss SM11 
in 1970). Further development led to smaller telescope- or theodolite-mounted 
distance meters (Kern DM500 in 1974; AGA Geodimeter 12 in 1975; Sokkisha 
SDM-1C in 1976; Topcon DM-C2 in 1979) and smaller semi-electronic tacheo- 
meters (Zeiss SM4 in 1976; Topcon GTS-1 in 1980; Sokkisha SDM-3D in 1980; 
Zeiss SM41 in 1981; Topcon GTS-2 in 1981; Sokkisha SDM-3E in 1982).
More recently, infrared distance meters employing the pulse measurement 
principle (rather than the phase measurement principle) appeared on the market. 
Pulsed distance meters for industrial applications were pioneered by Eumig. The 
first instrument for surveying applications, the Geo-Fennel FEN2000 was released 
in 1983. The Wild Distomat DI 3000 followed as a second type of pulsed IR dis­
tance meters in 1985.
The first precision EDM instrument, the Mekometer, was built by K.D. 
Froome and R. H. Bradsell in 1961 at the National Physical Laboratory, Ted- 
dington (U.K.) and became commercially available early in 1973 as the Kern 
Mekometer ME 3000. On short distances, accuracies of 0.2 mm can be achieved. 
As successors to this instrument, the COM-RAD204 DME Geomensor and the 
Kern Mekometer ME 5000 were released in 1984 and 1986, respectively.
The first electronic tacheometer (sometimes termed “total station”), the Zeiss 
(Oberkochen) Reg ELTA 14, became available in 1970 and featured electronic 
readout not only of distance but also for the vertical and horizontal circles. The 
second total station, the AGA Geodimeter 700 followed in 1971. Smaller and 
lighter second generation instruments entered the market in 1977 and 1978 with 
the Hewlett-Packard HP3820A, the Wild TCI, the Zeiss ELTA 2 and the Zeiss 
ELTA 4. By 1985, electronic tacheometers were available from all major surveying 
equipment manufacturers, as were electronic data storage devices and computer 
software packages for data processing and plotting.

2 Physical Laws and Units Related to EDM
2.1 Definitions
The frequency f and the wavelength % of electromagnetic waves are related by the 
following fundamental equations:
c
X = - ; 
(2.1)
f
f = 7, 
(2.2)
where c = velocity of electromagnetic waves in a medium, usually referred to as 
the velocity of light in the medium
f = frequency of signal
X = wavelength in the medium.
The mode and velocity of propagation of an electromagnetic wave depend to a 
certain extent on the frequency of the signal and on the nature of the earth’s at­
mosphere. The distance between two stations can be computed, if the travelling 
time of the radiation is measured:
cAt' = d, 
(2.3)
where d = distance between the two points
At' = time taken by the signal to travel from first to second station 
(“flight” time)
c = velocity of light in the medium.
It is assumed in Eqs. (2.1) to (2.3), that the velocity of light in a medium (normally 
air) is known. This velocity can be calculated if the refractive index of the medium 
(viz. air) and the velocity of light in a vacuum is known.
c = ^, 
(2.4)
n
where n = refractive index of a medium 
c0 = velocity of light in a vacuum 
c = velocity of light in a medium.
The velocity of light in a vacuum is a physical constant which has to be deter­
mined by experiment. The determination of c0 remains a permanent challenge to 
physicists and even has led to the development of EDM instruments, as discussed 
earlier. More information about this natural constant is given in Section 2.3. The
3

refractive index of a medium can be derived from formulae given in Section 5. 
It is very difficult to accurately assess the refractive index along the wave path, 
and consequently the accuracy of EDM is often limited by the accuracy to which 
the integral refractive index is known.
Electromagnetic radiation can be described by the following formulae:
y = A sin (cot)
(2.5 a)
= A sin 0 ,
(2.5 b)
where A = amplitude or maximum strength
co = angular velocity (angular frequency, angular rate of alternation)
f = frequency of signal
t = time
= phase angle,
and where O = cot
(2.6 a)
co = 2?tf .
(2.6 b)
The parameters are further explained in Fig. 2.1.
A signal with a phase lead of A0 can be expressed as:
y = Asin(0+A0)
(2.7 a)
y = Asinco(t+At) , 
where At = time lead
A0 = phase lead.
(2.7b)
The effect of a time lead is depicted in Fig. 2.2.
The phase lead may be written as a function of the time lead:
A0 = Atco

Radiowaves belonging to the SHF and UHF bands and parts of the EHF and 
VHF bands are traditionally called microwaves. They may be divided into:
5

Wavelength X

V Band
5.3 mm-6.5 mm

0.194 m-0.769 m
0.39-1.55 GHz
P Band
0.769 m-1.333 m
0.225-0.390 GHz
Microwaves are widely used for telecommunication purposes (including 
transmissions to and from satellites) and Radar (Radio detection and ranging) 
systems.
The infrared part of the spectrum is also divided further:
Wavelength
Near-infrared NIR
Middle-infrared MIR
Far-infrared FIR
Extreme-infrared XIR
0.76 pm-3.0 pm
3.0 pm —6.0 pm
6.0 pm-15.0pm
15.0 pm—1mm
NIR radiation has propagation characteristics which are close to those of visi­
ble light and this facilitates its use both in optical communication systems (glass 
fibres) and EDM.
Electro-optical EDM instruments typcially use NIR radiation of 800 to 
900 nm wavelength or red HeNe Laser (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emis­
sion of Radiation) light of 633 nm wavelength. Microwave EDM instruments use 
mainly wavelengths of 30 mm and 8 mm and are therefore classified within the 
X and K bands and the SHF and EHF bands, respectively. Terrestrial navigation 
systems make use of a larger range of radiowaves. For example, the Decca system 
operates in the LF band, Toran and Decca HI-FIX in the HF band and Omega 
in the VLF band. The satellites of the Global Positioning System (GPS) transmit 
in the L band at wavelengths of 0.190m (LI) and 0.244m (L2).
2.3 Velocity of Light in a Vacuum
Over the last 300 years different techniques have been used by astronomers and 
physicists to determine c0. The precision of determination has improved during 
the last 20 years from ± 1 km/s to ± 1 m/s. Some of the instruments and tech­
niques of this development have been applied by EDM instrument manufacturers. 
Experiments by Essen and Froome (1951) led to a formula for the calculation of 
the refractive index of microwaves. Some determination methods used a “reverse 
EDM process”, namely to derive the unknown velocity of light from a distance 
which was measured with precise invar wires or by interferometry.

In 1957 the Xllth General Assembly of the International Scientific Radio 
Union recommended the value
c0 = 299792.5±0.4 km/s . 
(2.9)
This value was accepted later by the International Union for Geodesy and 
Geophysics (IUGG). At the XVIth General Assembly of the IUGG in 1975, the 
following revised value for c0 was recommended (IUGG 1975):
c0 = 299792458± 1.2m/s . 
(2.10)
The standard deviation of c0 quoted above amounts only to 0.004 ppm and is 
mainly due to the uncertainty in the 1960 definition of the metre. In EDM c0 can 
7

therefore be considered as an error-free value, because the accuracy of EDM is 
rarely better than one part per million (1 ppm). The change between the 1957 and 
the 1975 value of c0 is 42m/s or 0.14 ppm. The above 1975 definition should be 
used for the scale definition of distance meters.
2.4 Units and Their Definitions
It is useful to review the definitions of two important units upon which electronic 
distance measurement is based. The derived frequency unit and one 
meteorological unit are also mentioned, the latter, because it is not a standard SI 
unit.
2.4.1 Second of Time
The second was defined by the Xlllth General Conference on Weights and 
Measures in 1967 as follows:
“The second is the duration of 9192631770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the 
transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium-133 atom”.
Derived units are
One millisecond = 1 ms = lxl0-3s
One microsecond = Ips = 1 x 10-6 s
One nanosecond = 1 ns = lxl0-9s .
This atomic standard of the second can be reproduced to an accuracy of 1 in 
10~n according to the National Standards Laboratory (1972). The time standard 
is maintained by atomic clocks (caesium standards, hydrogen masers).
2.4.2 Metre
An earlier definition of the metre was decided upon by the 11th General Con­
ference on Weights and Measures in 1960 as follows:
“The metre is the length equal to 1650763.73 wave lengths in vacuo of the radiation cor­
responding to the transition between the levels 2 p10 and 5 d5 of the krypton-86 atom.”
A new definition of the metre was adopted by the 17 th General Conference 
for Weights and Measures (Conference Generale des Poids et Mesures, CGPM) 
on 20 October 1983 in Paris. It reads as follows:
“The metre is the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 
1/299792458 of a second.”
The new definition will lead to an improved precision in the realization of the 
unit of length by laser wave lengths and frequency techniques. (Wavelengths from 
8

frequency-stabilized lasers can be reproduced to 1 part in 1012 or better.) The new 
definition effectively fixes the value of the velocity of light, thus making c0 a 
physical constant. Recommendations on the practical realization of the definition 
of the metre were adopted by the Comite International des Poids et Mesures dur­
ing its 72nd Session in October 1983 (Anon 1984).
Derived units are:
One kilometre 
= 1 km = 1 x 103 m
One millimetre 
= 1 mm = 1 x 10~3 m
One micrometre = 1 pm = 1 x 10~6 m
One nanometre 
= 1 nm = lxl0“9m .
2.4.3 Kelvin
The unit of the thermodynamic temperature T is the Kelvin and is defined as the 
fraction 1/273.16 of the thermodynamic temperature of the triple point of water.
Celsius temperatures are, for historical reasons, measured from a thermal state 
0.01 Kelvin lower than the triple point of water. A Celsius temperature t is defined 
by
t = T-273.15 K . 
(2.11)
The unit of Celsius temperature is the degree Celsius (°C). It is equal in mag­
nitude to the Kelvin (K) by definition. The triple point of water is the equilibrium 
state at which ice, air-saturated water and vapour-saturated air coexist (Fritschen 
and Gray 1979).
In 1990, the Comite International des Poids et Mesures (CIPM) introduced 
the International Temperature Scale ITS-90, which closely corresponds to thermo­
dynamic temperature. The difference (t90 -168) between ITS-90 and the previous 
IPTS-68 temperatures is zero at 0°C and -0.026°C at 100°C (Preston-Thomas 
1991).
2.4.4 Other Units in EDM
2.4.4.1 Frequency
Frequency units are not basic units but are based entirely on the definition of 
time. The name of the frequency unit is taken from the name of the German 
physicist, Heinrich Hertz (1857—1894), who discovered the existence of elec­
tromagnetic waves.
One Hertz = 1 Hz =1 cycle per second = s"1
One Kilo Hertz = 1 kHz =1x103Hz
One Mega Hertz = 1 MHz = 1 x 106 Hz
One Giga Hertz = 1 GHz = 1 x 109 Hz
9

2.4.4.2 Pressure
In contrast to the derived SI unit for pressure, the pascal, the unit of pressure 
generally used by meteorologists, by international agreement, is the millibar (mb). 
All formulae in this text involving pressure will be based on millibars. The follow­
ing relations apply:
One millibar = 1 mb = 1 x 10“3 bar = 102 Pa = 102 Nm-2 = 1 hPa ,
where N (newton) is the SI unit for force.
The conversion between mm or inches of mercury (Hg) and mb is as follows:
1 mb = 0.7500615 mm Hg = 0.029530 inch Hg ; 1 mm Hg = 1.333224 hPa .
Example: 1013.250 mb = 760 mm Hg = 29.9213 inch Hg = 101.3250 kPa.
2.4.43 Feet
The “International Foot” is used for legal conversion from feet to metres in 
Australia and in the U.S.A. and is defined as follows:
1 foot = 0.3048 metres exactly . 
(2.12)
The above conversion differs by one part in 500000 from the “U.S. Survey Foot” 
presently used by the surveying and mapping profession in the United States of 
America. The U.S. Survey Foot was defined in 1893 as
1 foot = 1200/3937 m 
(2.13 a)
1 foot = 0.30480061 m 
(2.13 b)
1 metre = 3.2808333’... feet . 
(2.14)
It should be noted that most (but not all) distance meters, which allow conversion 
of the display distances from metres to feet, employ the “U.S. Survey Foot” rather 
than the “International Foot” definition. Instrument-specific information may be 
found in instrument manuals. Until the introduction of the Australian National 
Standards Act in 1960 many Australian authorities used “British Feet”. The 
physical length of the British standard yard has changed significantly over the 
years. Great care is necessary to determine the correct factor to convert old surveys 
from feet to metres.
2.4.4.4 Fahrenheit
The conversions between degrees Fahrenheit (F) and degrees Celsius (C) are as 
follows
C = (5/9)(F-32) 
(2.15)
F = (9/5)C+32 . 
(2.16)
Some distance meters have provisions for temperature input in degrees Fahrenheit 
as well as degrees Celsius.

3 Principles and Applications of EDM
There are many ways to measure distances by electronic means. Four basic prin­
ciples will be presented although only one will be discussed in greater depth.
3.1 Pulse Method
3.1.1 Principle of the Pulse Method
A short, intensive signal is transmitted by an instrument. It travels to a target 
point and back and thus covers twice the distance d. Measuring the so-called 
flight time between transmission and reception of the same pulse, the distance 
may be calculated as
2d = cAt'
= c(tR —tE) , 
(3.1)
where d = distance between instrument and target 
c = velocity of light in the medium 
At' = flight time of pulse
tE = time of departure of pulse, timed by gate GE
tR = time of arrival of returning pulse, timed by gate GR.
Figure 3.1 depicts such a instrument. GE and GR are gates where the passage 
of a pulse is monitored and its time recorded.

REFLECTING
TARGET
Fig. 3.1. Principle of a pulse distance meter. Timing starts and stops when the light pulse passes 
the emitter gate GE and the receiver gate GR, respectively
11

Depending on the nature (light or radio wave) and power of the pulse and on 
the distance to be measured, suitable natural or artificial features of landscape 
(or air space) or special retroreflectors may be used as reflecting agents in ter­
restrial applications. High powered laser systems are used in military laser rang­
ing, thus allowing for the use of the first type of reflecting surfaces. Civil users 
prefer well-defined, special targets to increase range and precision.
It can be seen from Eq. (3.1) that the accuracy of the distance is dependent 
on the accuracy of the flight time measurement. An accuracy in the recording of 
time of 0.1 ns is equivalent to an accuracy of 15 mm.
3.1.2 Applications of the Pulse Method
The pulse method has been used for some time in geodesy, navigation and in 
military applications, both with light waves and with radiowaves. Powerful pulsed 
laser systems are employed in geodesy for extremely long distance measurements. 
These systems require retroreflectors as (cooperative) targets. Military laser 
rangers measure medium distances by “shooting” at natural or man-made 
features (non-cooperative targets) visible in the landscape.
Typical light wave applications of the pulse method are:
- Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR)
- Lunar Laser Ranging (LLR) 
- Military Laser Rangefinders 
- Pulsed Distance Meters for Surveying 
- Airborne Laser Terrain Profiler 
- Laser Airborne Depth Sounder (LADS)
Satellite laser ranging is carried out for a number of purposes, such as satellite 
orbit determination (tracking), solid-earth physics studies, polar motion and 
length of day determination, precise geodetic positioning over long ranges and 
monitoring of crustal motion. Two satellites have been launched specifically for 
geodetic and geophysical purposes. Starlette (launched in 1975 by France) carries 
60 retroreflectors and orbits 800 km above the earth. LAGEOS (LAser 
GEOdynamics Satellite) was launched in 1976 by NASA into an orbit 6000 km 
above the earth. It has a diameter of 0.60 m and carries 422 cube corner reflectors. 
The apertures of satellite laser ranging telescopes vary from 0.3 to 1.0 m diameter. 
Pulse energies vary from 0.25 to 3 joules. Typically, green emitting Nd-YAG 
(neodymium-yttrium-aluminium-garnet) lasers are employed. Ranging accuracies 
are stated as 1, 0.10 and 0.03 m for first, second and third generation instruments 
(Wilkins 1980). A global network of fixed stations provides continuous observa­
tions. A number of mobile stations, such as NASA’s MOBLAS (MOBile LASers) 
and TLRS (Transportable Laser Ranging Station) provide support for shorter 
campaigns. The TLRS-2 laser operates at a wavelength of 532 nm (Nd: YAG), at 
a pulse width of 400 ps, with a power output of 4 MJ and a repetition rate of 10 
pulses per second (NASA 1983). Satellite laser rangers have been used (like EDM 
instruments) for measurements to terrestrial reflectors on rare occasions.
12

A total of five sets of reflectors were placed on the moon by successive lunar 
missions by the U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R. The four reflector arrays set-up by the 
Apollo 11, 14, 15 and the Lunakhod 21 missions are operational and form a 
quadrilateral with about 1000 km side length. Several laser ranging stations have 
been measuring to the moon for earth rotation studies and for the determination 
of the moon’s shape, structure and orbit, with the University of Texas McDonald 
Observatory near Fort Davis, Texas, being the most successful observatory. The 
flight time of pulses to the moon and back amounts to about 2.6 s. The returns 
from the moon are received at single photon level and need to be averaged over 
some time to become recognizable. Single shot accuracy is thought to be at the 
0.1 m level for most lunar data (Wilkins 1980).
Battery-operated military-type laser rangefinders may be binocular-shaped for 
handheld use, tripod-based or attached to sighting periscopes of vehicles, for ex­
ample. Typically, Q-switched Nd: YAG lasers are employed, operating at 1064 nm 
and with pulses of 3 to 15 mJ energy, 10 to 20 ns width and repetition rates of 
0.5 to 1 Hz. Maximum range varies between 10 and 20 km, minimum range be­
tween 50m and 250m and ranging accuracy between ±3 m and ±5 m.
General purpose pulse distance meters may be divided into three groups. A 
first group includes instruments developed for use in industry and civil engineer­
ing with maximum ranges from 8 to 100 m and 8 to 400 m to matt black and matt 
white targets, respectively, and resolutions between 10 and 100 mm. The second 
group includes hand-held or theodolite/tripod-mounted instruments with ac­
curacies of ±(0.5 m+30-1000 ppm) and maximum ranges of 100 m and 3000 m 
to passive and single prism targets, respectively. The third group is formed by 
EDM instruments with accuracies of ±5 mm employing the pulse rather than the 
phase measurement technique. These EDM instruments have longer range than 
comparable phase measuring instruments because they can compensate the in­
creased energy emission during a pulse with the idle times between pulses. They 
permit distance measurements to non-cooperative targets on close range. This 
third group of pulse distance meters will be discussed later in more details.
Helicopter-mounted laser terrain profilers are routinely used for the deter­
mination of longitudinal profiles in the design of roads and transmission lines, 
typically in connection with inertial surveying systems (Engler 1983). Typically, 
pulsed GaAs lasing diodes emitting at 904 nm are employed. The single shot ac­
curacies of the systems vary from about ±0.05 to 0.45 m depending on the signal- 
to-noise ratio. Discrimination of first and last pulse returns successfully permits 
mapping terrain as well as ground cover heights (Mamon et al. 1978).
A Laser Airborne Depth Sounder (L.A.D.S.) is being developed for the 
Hydrographic Service of the Royal Australian Navy. It is designed to measure 
water depths from 2 to 30 m (up to 50 m at night) for charting purposes on the 
continental shelf. Two frequencies of a neodymium-doped yttrium-alumini­
um-garnet (Nd: YAG) laser are employed. The fundamental IR wavelength of 
1064 nm is employed for the height measurement to the sea surface and the fre­
quency-doubled green wavelength of 532 nm for the height measurement to the 
sea floor. Resolution and accuracy are stated as 0.1 and 0.5 m, respectively (Billard 
1988; Myres 1983).
Typical radiowave applications of the pulse method are:

- RADAR (RAdio Detection And Ranging)
DME (Distance Measuring Equipment for aircraft)
- LORAN (LOng RAnge Navigation for aircraft)
- Satellite Radar Altimetry
- Airborne Radar Altimetry
Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) is part of a short-range navigation 
system for aircraft. Together with VHF omni-range beacons (VOR), it provides 
bearing and distance (rho-theta) information to pilots. The DME in the aircraft 
transmits pulse pairs. A ground transponder receives the pulses, delays them for 
50 jxs and then transmits pulse pairs with a different spacing. The DME measures 
the time lapse between transmission and reception of the pulse pairs, removes the 
50 jxs beacon delay and computes the distance to the beacon in nautical miles 
(Kendal 1979).
Satellite radar altimeters measure continuously the distance between satellites 
and the surface of the sea. A first instrument was used in the Skylab mission in 
1973, a second one in the GEOS-C satellite from 1975. A third operated in 
SEASAT-1 between June and October 1978 and a fourth in GEOSAT since March 
1985. Satellite altimetry is used for ocean geoid determinations and for detailed 
determinations of the sea surface topography. The accuracy of altimeter data is 
better than one metre.
3.2 Phase Difference Method
The phase difference method is defined here as the method of measuring phase 
differences of continuous waves for distance measurement.
3.2.1 Phase Difference Between Transmitted and Received Signal
Most common EDM instruments used in surveying are based on this principle, 
regardless of whether they use light waves, infrared waves or microwaves as carrier 
waves. The measuring signal, which is modulated on the carrier wave in the emit­
ter, travels to the reflector (in the case of an optical carrier wave) and back to the 
EDM instrument, where it is picked up by the receiver (see Fig. 3.2).
In the receiver, the phases of the emitted and the received signals are compared
and the phase lead AO is measured.
Emitted signal yE = A sin (cot) 
(2.5 a)
= AsinO . 
(2.5 b)
Received signal yR = A sin co (t+At) 
(2.7 b)
= Asin(O + AO) . 
(2.7a)
Because a continuous signal is used, the values of yE and yR will change with 
time. But the phase lead AO (as well as the time lead At) will remain constant.
14

The instrument can therefore measure a constant phase lead despite the fact that 
the amplitudes of both signals vary continuously. According to Eq. (3.1), the dis­
tance could be computed as follows:
d = - At' .
2
(3.2)
Unfortunately, At' cannot be obtained through phase comparison. Phase compar­
ison provides only a time lead At. A time equivalent to the number of full cycles 
elapsed during the flight of a specific signal has to be added to At to obtain the 
total flight time At'.
At' = mt* +At ,
(3.3)
where At' = flight time of a specific signal 
m
t*
At
= integral number of full wavelengths over the measuring path (am­
biguities)
= elapsed time for one full cycle of the modulation signal (period)
= time lead in phase measurement.
In Eq. (3.3), all variables except m and At' are known. The time lead At can 
be derived from Eq. (2.8 a) as a function of the measured phase lead A<1>. 
Substituting co and f from Eqs. (2.6 b) and (2.2) leads finally to
At = ^
2nc
(3.4)
where X is the modulation wavelength.
The time interval (t*) of one full cycle of the modulation wavelength (or 
period) can be obtained by substituting for A<P in Eq. (3.4). This leads to:
* 
t* = —
c
(3.5)
Equation (3.2) can now be written in a new form, considering also Eqs. (3.3), (3.4) 
and (3.5):

(3.6)
With the exception of the ambiguities m, all variables of Eq. (3.6) are known.
Usually, the term X/2 is replaced by U, which is called the unit length of an 
EDM instrument. The unit length U is the scale on which the EDM instrument 
measures a distance.
U = - . 
(3.7)

The second term of Eq. (3.6) is also replaced by a new term, L, indicating the frac­
tion of U.

(3.8)
where L = fraction of unit length U to be determined by phase measurement, 
A0 = (measured) phase lead (in radians) 
U = unit length of distance meter.
The fundamental Eq. (3.6) now reads as follows:
d = mU+L , 
(3.9)
where m is an integral number of unit lengths and is still unknown. The ambiguity 
of Eq. (3.9) is solved, not by the determination of m but by the introduction of 
more than one unit length in an EDM instrument. The procedure may best be ex­
plained by some examples. The most important unit length of an instrument is 
always the smallest, which coincides with the highest frequency. This so-called 
“main” unit length is used for the fine measurement of distances. The precision 
of an instrument depends on the choice of this main unit length, because of the 
limited resolution of the phase measurement.
3.2.L1 First Example: Hewlett-Packard HP3800B
The Hewlett-Packard Distance Meter HP38OOB used a total of four unit lengths 
ranging from 10 m to 10 km. The basic principle of operation is explained in the 
table below.

The underlined figures are on display. The phase measurement is done auto­
matically by digital means. Step one of the procedure is called fine measurement, 
step two coarse measurement. For distances longer than 1 km, 1000 m would have 
to be added to the readout of the instrument.
Later instruments in the 500 series (DM 503, DM 504) employ a third modula­
tion frequency to resolve the multiples of 1000 m. The third unit length is derived 
from synthetic frequencies, as shown below in the third example.
3.2.1.3 Third Example: Nikon DTM-1 and NTD-3
The two Nikon distance meters do not use a set of unit lengths which are related 
by factors of ten, hundred, thousand, etc. They employ unit lengths which are 
close to each other. The coarse measurements of distance are derived by computa­
tion from differences of three fine measurements carried out with slightly differ­
ent unit lengths. The procedure is similar to techniques used in early Geodimeters, 
such as the models 4, 6, 6 A and 8 (Rtieger 1988).

(3.12)
where c0 = velocity of light in vacuum 
nREF = reference refractive index.
Subtracting smaller frequencies from larger frequencies (as no negative fre­
quencies can exist) leads to the following synthetic coarse measurement frequen­
cies and unit lengths:
f i—f2 = 0.038 MHz -> U4 = 4000 m

3.2.1.4 Fourth Example: Kern Mekometer ME5000
The precision distance meter Kern Mekometer ME 5000 operates on a slightly dif­
ferent principle. Rather than using fixed modulation frequencies and measuring 
18

phase differences, the modulation frequency is adjusted (within a certain range) 
until the transmitted and received signals are in phase. This is done at four fre­
quencies, namely at both ends of the tuning range and in the middle. The frequen­
cies are obtained from a frequency synthesizer and are, thus, known. The step in­
terval of the frequency synthesizer is 10 MHz/61824 or 161.749482 Hz (Meier and 
Loser 1986). All measured frequencies will therefore be multiples of this fre­
quency.
The equations for the four distance measurements can be expressed as
do = moUo 
(3.15)
d1 = m1U1 
(3.16)
d2 = m2U2 
(3.17)
d3 = m3U3 , 
(3.18)
where U, =

mi = multiples of unit length Uj (ambiguities), 
c
With Eq. (2.2) Xj = - the unit length computes as
U, = — . 
(3.20)
2fi
Starting at the lowest frequency, the first phase minimum is tracked and the fre­
quency recorded (f0). Then the next minimum with higher frequency is tracked 
and the frequency recorded (ft). Therefore
mt = m0 + l .
Solving Eqs. (3.15) and (3.16) for mi yields

It should be noted that the procedure outlined above reflects the principle of the 
measurement of the Mekometer ME 5000. In reality, the instrument is likely to 
20

measure a greater number of phase minima and is likely to use all measurements 
in the computation of the final distance. The procedure described by Meier and 
Loser (1988) for a two-colour instrument in fact features more measured minima.

ME 5000 measurement.

3.2.2 Phase Difference Between Two Received Signals
Another form of distance measurement by phase measurement is adopted in 
navigation systems such as Toran and Decca which work in the so-called hyper­
bolic mode.
Two radio transmitters M and S transmit continuous unmodulated signals of 
equal frequency. The signals are received at a station R of unknown position (see 
Fig. 3.3).
If <E>m and C>s are the phase angles of the two radiated signals at any instant, 
their phase difference at station R will be

0M» <&s = phase angles of the M and S transmitters respectively 
f = frequency of the M and S transmitters
__ c = velocity of light in air
MR = distance between transmitter M and receiver R
SR = distance between transmitter S and receiver R.
The phase angles OM and Os are kept in a constant relation. Both transmit­
ters are phase locked, which produces a constant (<I>M — <PS). The second term in 
22

Eq. (3.34) is variable and depends on the difference of path lengths from the two 
transmitters. Lines of equal path difference generate a set of hyperbolae with S 
and M as foci. A position fix by means of one hyperbola intersecting another re­
quires a second base, S2M. As shown in Fig. 3.4, this is provided by a third 
transmitter.
More information about navigation systems may be found in Burnside (1991) 
and Laurila (1991).
3.3 Doppler Methods
The variation in the pitch of a tone, heard whilst the source of the tone is moved 
relative to the observer, was first studied by the Austrian physicist Christian 
Doppler (1803-1853) and later named after him. The Doppler effect is observed 
not only with acoustic waves but also with all electromagnetic waves. It may be 
explained with the aid of a terrestrial example; its application in satellite geodesy 
will be discussed later. Figure 3.5 depicts a mobile instrument which consists of 
a microwave transmitter and receiver. The instrument moves at speed v towards 
a reflecting surface. The transmitted signal is reflected at this surface and picked 
up by the receiver.
The emitted frequency is expressed as
fT = |, 
(3.35)
A
where c = velocity of light in a medium 
% = wavelength of emitted radiation.
The following frequency arrives at the reflecting surface:
fS = £iy. 
(3.36)

where v = speed of instrument relative to reflecting surface.
Back at the receiver, R, the frequency fR is received.

The procedure for measuring the Doppler frequency depends on the type of waves 
used. The Doppler frequency fD may be obtained by either:
1. Counting the beats per second in the case of sound waves.
2. Counting the bright (or dark) fringes of an optical interference pattern in the 
case of light waves.
3. Counting the cycles of the Doppler signal (“Doppler counts”) per second in 
the case of radio waves.
Equation (3.38) may be written as:
v = ffDX . 
(3.39)
The distance travelled by the instrument between time tt and time t2 is 
h
d12=j±fDXdt. 
(3.40)

The Doppler method is used in surveying and metrology for distance measure­
ments of highest precision. The Hewlett-Packard HP 5526 A and HP 5528 A Laser 
Measurement Systems (laser interferometers) employ the Doppler effect to mea­
sure distances travelled by a reflector with a resolution of 10 nm. Because fringe 
counts need to be obtained, the reflector must travel along the laser beam. This 
is usually achieved by mounting the reflector on a carriage which travels on a rail.
In geodesy, the Doppler method became well known with the introduction of 
the U.S. Navy Navigation Satellite System (TRANSIT, NAVSAT) early in 1963. 
The system was released for public use in 1967 and will be supported until 1992 
(Hoskins 1982). (By that time, the new NAVSTAR Global Positionning System 
(GPS) will have taken over the functions of the TRANSIT (or NAVSAT) system 
in navigation.) In geodesy, Doppler receivers are employed to track satellite 
signals (see Fig. 3.6). The most successful instrument, the Magnavox MX 1502 
Geoceiver Satellite Surveyor, consists of three portable parts, namely an antenna 
(which is set-up and centred over the survey mark), the receiver unit with cassette 
recorder and a power supply (e.g. 12 V battery). The on-board microprocessor 
permits on-line and off-line processing of data.
The TRANSIT system relies on five to six U.S. navigation satellites in orbit 
around the earth and provides a world wide navigation system. Setting up a
24

received satellite broadcast frequency and the internal reference frequency.

(3.42)
The satellite orbit is known and the position of the ground station can therefore 
be obtained by intersecting hyperboloids of revolution. Hyperboloids are the loci 
in space of equal distance differences with respect to two points. Each time inter­
val At (Fig. 3.6) produces one pair of hyperboloids of revolution with focal points 
corresponding to the satellite positions at the beginning and the end of the time 
interval. The position of the Doppler receiver is obtained in a geocentric coor­
dinate system.
The accuracy of Doppler positioning depends on how long the satellite signals 
are recorded and on the type of subsequent processing. Assuming observations 
over 2 days, absolute horizontal positions can be obtained with an accuracy of 
around ±10m. Relative (differential) positions between two stations can be 
established at the ±0.5-1.0m level through use of on-board processing. 
Postprocessing using multi-station (network) solutions may provide accuracies 
down to ±0.3 m (Hoar 1981).

3.4 Interferometry
The principle of optical interference is presently used in interferometers for 
metrology, for high precision distance measurements over short distances and for 
the definition of the metre. The development of interferometers dates back to 
1880, when A. A. Michelson had his first interferometer built in Germany. A first 
measurement of the metre in terms of light waves followed in 1889. For his work 
on interferometers, Michelson received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1907 (Swen­
son 1987).
3.4.1 Principle of a Michelson Interferometer
The basic principle of an interferometer is depicted in Fig. 3.7. A light source such 
as a laser produces a light beam which is directed towards a beam splitter. This 
allows one portion of the beam to pass to the moving reflector and deflects 
another portion to the fixed reflector. The beams, returned by the reflectors, pass 
again through the beam splitter and produce an interference pattern there. The 
interference pattern is recorded by the photodetector and Doppler counts are 
recorded by the digital counter.
The two waves superimposed in the beam splitter are of equal frequency and 
amplitude (coherent waves) because they are generated by the same light source. 
They have, however, a constant phase difference because of the difference in path 
lengths. They may be described according to Eqs. (2.5 a) and (2.7 a):
yt = A sin (cot)
y2 = Asin(cot+AO) .
The superimposed signal is of the form
y = yi+y2 =
• ( Ao\
sm I o>t-+----- I
\ 2 /
(3.43)
and reaches a maximum for a phase lead of AO = 0 (constructive interference) 
and a minimum for AO = n (destructive interference). During a displacement of
Fig. 3.7. Principal components of a Michelson Interferometer. LS light source; FR fixed reflec­
tor; BS beam splitter; PD photo detector; MR moving reflector; C counter
26

the movable reflector MR, the photodetector counts the number of bright fringes 
in the interference pattern of the beam splitter.
The distance between the first and the last positions of the reflector is derived 
from
2d = (number of bright fringes)xX , 
(3.44)
where X = wave length of light source.
Or in the final form:
%
d = (number of bright fringes) x- . 
(3.45)
2
The high resolution of interferometers is based on the direct use of the wave 
length of light waves for measurement. Some EDM instruments use light waves 
as carrier, but a modulated signal is used for the measurement. Considering a 
laser interferometer with a HeNe-laser light source, the wave length is 
X = 632.8 nm, thus leading to a least count of about 0.3 pm. The overall accuracy 
of such systems, however, is limited to about 0.1 ppm by the uncertainty of the 
refractive index through the limited accuracy of the measurement of ambient tem­
perature and pressure. Common laser interferometers have a maximum range of 
about 60 m and are mainly used indoors. They are utilized not only for precise 
length measurements but generally in metrology for measurement of straightness, 
squareness, parallelism, flatness and angle. For example, the Hewlett-Packard 
HP 5526A laser measurement system, as discussed in the next section, is used for 
such measurements.
3.4.2 Principle of Operation of the HP5526A Laser Measurement 
System
The HP 5526A uses a two-frequency laser. The two laser frequencies are obtained 
by so-called Zeeman splitting by applying a weak longitudinal magnetic field to 
the laser tube (see Fig. 3.8). They are separated by a few MHz. The two frequen­
cies have left and right hand circular polarization. The frequency difference 
results from different indices of refraction for the two polarizations in the laser 
tube. The two polarizations are converted to orthogonal linear polarizations by 
the X/4, X/2 plates shown in Fig. 3.8. The two-frequency laser is stabilized by 
balancing the output powers of the two polarizations. Refer to differential 
amplifier in left bottom corner. Tuning is partly automatic, partly manual.
Both optical frequencies are directed to the polarizing beam splitter (actual in­
terferometer) where the one frequency (f j) is bent by 90° and the other (f2) is let 
through. Both beams then travel to separate reflectors where they are shifted and 
reflected. The beam separation is 13 mm. The two beams recombine at the beam 
splitter and then fall on the photodetector. The photodetector senses the dif­
ference or beat frequency ft - f2.
If, however, the reflectors are moving with velocities Vi and v2, the beat fre­
quency will be

If the difference between Doppler beat frequency from the interferometer (ex­
ternal path) and the reference beat frequency (ft - f2) is counted for a time At, 
the resulting cumulative count corresponds to the differential displacement Ad of 
the retroreflectors in wavelengths of light, X, and, by simple conversion, in length

fringe contrast is degraded because of diffraction and turbulence and may result 
in the failure of the optoelectronics of the interferometer to recognize fringes. The 
Hewlett-Packard interferometer displays an error message whenever the Doppler 
count is lost.
A limitation of the two frequency laser is the low maximum displacement 
speed, vmax, of the reflector. The forward counter in the figure can store only 
pulses. If (ft-f2)±Af approaches zero and crosses zero, the count will increase 
again, because there is no such thing as a negative frequency. The counter cannot

3.4.3 Vaisala Interference Comparator
The Vaisala interference comparator (Vaisala 1923, 1927, 1930) was originally 
developed to calibrate 24 m invar wires under field conditions. The invar wires 
were then used, in turn, to determine the length of so-called standard baselines. 
In 1947, the Finnish Nummela Baseline was measured for the first time directly 
with the interference comparator with an accuracy of 6 parts in 108. This base­
line features marks at 0, 6, 24, 72, 216, 432, and 864 m, with the 24 m multiples 
governed by the earlier determinations by 24 m invar wires.
The working principle of the interference comparator and the observation 
procedures are described in Kukkamaki (1968), for example. Interference of white 
light is used to multiply previously determined sections. The fundamental length 
scale is determined by a 1-metre-long quartz rod, from which the first section 
(0 m-6 m) is derived. The length of the standard quartz rods are determined by 
laboratory techniques. The interval between the first and third mark (0 m-24 m) 
is determined by “multiplication” of the first section. The process continues until 
the 0 m to 864 m interval is derived from the 0 m to 432 m interval.
Subsequently, the IXth General Assembly of IUGG (Brussells 1951) passed a 
resolution suggesting that baselines be measured by similar techniques in different 
countries. The following standard baselines were established and measured by in­
terference comparators (Kukkamaki 1978):
- Nummela, Finland (1947, 1952, 1958, 1961, 1966, 1968, 1975, 1977)
- Buenos Aires, Argentina (1953)
- Loenermark, Netherlands (1957, 1969)
- Mata Das Virtudes, Portugal (1962, 1978)
- Potsdam, G.D.R. (1964)
- Mansfield, Ohio, U.S.A. (1966)
- Pienaars River, South Africa (1976)
- Valladolid, Spain (1978)
- Eberberger Forst, Munich, F.R.G. (1958, 1960, 1963)
- Chang Yang, China (1985)
- Godollo, Hungary (1987)
The dates in brackets refer to the year(s) of determination(s). Most of these 
baselines follow the geometrical design of the Nummela baseline. Measurements 
29

on the Munich baseline with a Kern Mekometer ME 5000 indicate that the scale 
of the two determinations is not different. The standard deviation computed from 
differences between comparator values and ME 5000 values amounts to ±0.2 mm 
only (Meier and Loser 1986). Vaisala baselines have also been used to field 
calibrate precision distance meters prior and subsequent to determining a general 
purpose EDM calibration baseline (Maurer et al. 1988; Humphries 1989).

4 Basic Working Principles of Electronic Distance Meters
EDM instruments are classified according to the type of carrier wave employed. 
Instruments using light or IR waves are classified as electro-optical instruments. 
Instruments based on radio waves are generally called microwave instruments. 
Because of the different structure of these two types of instruments, they will be 
discussed separately.
4.1 Electro-optical Instruments
4.1.1 Principle and Components
The basic working principle of an electro-optical distance meter is explained with 
reference to the type of instrument which uses an analogue phase measuring 
system. Such instruments display the functions of the different components more 
clearly.
The light-source produces the so-called carrier wave. The wave is described by 
the carrier wavelength Xcarr. The following light sources are presently in use (in 
order of importance):
1. GaAIAs infrared emitting diode and GaAlAs lasing diode
0.800 < Xcarr < 0.950 pm .
Gallium aluminium arsenide (GaAIAs) diodes have spectral bandwidths of 
between 2 and 30 nm between half-power points and are, therefore, almost 
monochromatic. The degree of coherence of the radiation depends on the 
structure of the diode and the operating mode. The radiant power output of 
a single diode could be as high as 30 W but is usually much lower. The effec­
tive source size is a few tenth of a millimetre. Gallium aluminium arsenide 
diodes are used in most short-range and medium-range EDM instruments. 
They are further discussed in the next section.
2. HeNe-laser
%Carr = 0.6328 pm .
The radiant power output of these “red” gas lasers varies between 1 mW and 
10 mW. Lasers produce a coherent and monochromatic light of high power 
density and small divergence. Lasers are used mainly in long range EDM in­
struments. Distances up to 80 km may be measured, visibility permitting.
3. Xenon flash tube
31

%carr = 0-480 |Lim .
High pressure Xenon flash tubes are used in the Kern Mekometer ME 3000 and 
the COM-RAD Geomensor 204 DME. In the Mekometer ME 3000, flashes of 
1.0 |is duration and 0.04 Joule energy are produced at a repetition rate of 100 Hz.
The modulator varies the amplitude by intensity modulation of the carrier 
wave at a modulation frequency produced by an oscillator. The light beam will 
therefore alternate between bright and dark sequences. The modulation 
wavelength XMOD is always much longer than the carrier wavelength, Xcarr, or in 
other words, the modulation frequency is much lower than the carrier frequency. 
Different modulation techniques are discussed in Section 4.1.2.
The transmitter lens system, which may have a fixed or adjustable focus, pro­
duces a beam divergence of about 5 min of arc for short range instruments and 
20 s of arc for long range laser instruments such as the Geodimeter model 8. Nar­
row beams produce strong return signals, but because of the pointing precision 
demanded they may take pointing to distant reflectors a very tedious operation.
The reflector consists of a glass prism in a housing. All incident rays are 
reflected in such a way that the reflected rays are parallel to the incoming ones. 
The rays are therefore returned to the EDM instrument without the necessity of 
very accurate orientation of the reflector. Details of reflectors are described in 
Section 10.
The receiver lens system may again be of the fixed or adjustable focus type. 
It focusses the return signal onto the photo detector.
The photo detector transforms the light beam’s intensity variations into varia­
tions of current. Two devices are commonly used for this purpose:
1. In the range of semiconductors such as Si-(silicon)-photodiodes or Si-ava­
lanche-photodiodes (APD), silicon-photodiodes are preferred to germanium- 
photodiodes because of their higher response at wavelength % = 900 nm. Si- 
avalanche-photodiodes are preferred to Si-photodiodes because of their better 
signal-to-noise ratio, and are therefore used in most short-range EDM in­
struments.
2. Photomultipliers (photo tubes): Light falls onto the cathode which, being 
coated with a photo-electric substance, emits electrons according to the light’s 
energy. Between anode and cathode, the number of electrons is multiplied by 
an array of dynodes. Amplification factors up to 108 are possible. Such 
devices are used mainly in long range EDM instruments.
Refer to Burnside (1982) and Saastamoinen (1969) for further details.
The oscillator produces the modulation frequency and consists of an 
oscillator circuit which is locked to the resonant vibration frequency of a quartz 
crystal. To obtain a unit length of 10 m, the modulation frequency needs to be 
approximately 15 MHz. The resulting frequency is a function of the shape and 
size of the quartz crystal employed. Changes in ambient temperature and ageing 
of the quartz yield changes in the frequencies of oscillators. Differing systems are 
employed in EDM instruments to minimize temperature effects:
32

1. Oven-controlled crystal oscillators (OCXO) are used in some precision and 
long range EDM instruments and are accurate to ± 1 ppm or better. They need 
a warm-up time of at least 15 min. High performance OCXO’s (used in fre­
quency counters and geodetic satellite receivers, for example) feature propor­
tionally controlled double ovens and may exhibit stabilities of better than 
±0.01 ppm between -55 and +75 °C.
2. Temperature-compensated crystal oscillators (TCXO) are commonly used in 
short-range EDM instruments. They need no warm up time and are accurate 
to ± 1 ppm in the range 0 to + 50 °C and ±3 ppm in the range -20 to + 50 °C. 
Temperature compensation is typically achieved by analogue compensating 
networks which employ temperature-sensitive capacitors, thermistors and/or 
resistors.
3. Non-compensated room temperature crystal oscillators (RTXO) typically ex­
hibit frequency stabilities of ±5 ppm from -20 to +70°C and ±2.5 ppm 
from 0 to +50 °C.
The effects of the temperature characteristic of oscillators on distances measured 
with EDM instruments can be further reduced. Factory calibration of the 
oscillator’s frequency drift with temperature in connection with a built-in temper­
ature sensor permits the application of appropriate corrections to measured 
distances by the on-board microprocessor.
Typical annual ageing rates of TCXO’s and OCXO’s are 1 ppm and 0.2 ppm, 
respectively. The short-term stabilities (one second average) of TCXO’s and 
OCXO’s are typically 0.001 ppm and 0.0005 ppm, respectively, with high perfor­
mance OCXO’s reaching 3 parts in 1012. In EDM, the most critical oscillator pa­
rameters are the frequency drift with temperature and the frequency drift with 
time (ageing). More details on oscillators and their performance may be found 
in Frerking (1978) and Rueger (1982).
The resolver shifts the phase of the reference signal. In Fig. 4.1, a rotation of 
the phase shift knob simultaneously changes the readout and the resolver angle, 
and thus the phase of the reference signal.

ment

The phase detector provides the phase comparison between the return and the 
reference signal. The result of this phase detection is displayed on the null in­
dicator. The null indicator reads zero when both signals are exactly in phase. This 
is achieved by turning the resolver as explained above. More information on phase 
measurement is given in Section 4.1.3.
The display is directly coupled with the resolver. It indicates the position of 
the resolver and is therefore a readout of the measured phase difference. Both dis­
play and resolver position can be altered by turning the phase shift knob.
4.1.2 Methods of Modulation and Demodulation of Light and NIR 
Waves
4.1.2.1 Infrared Emitting and Lasing Diodes and their Modulation
The first commercial EDM instrument using GaAs infrared emitting diodes was 
released in 1968 (Wild Distomat DI 10), only 6 years after lasing in GaAs p-n 
junctions was first observed. Infrared emitting and lasing diodes provide a low 
cost, light weight, small, low voltage and low current alternative to gas lasers. The 
former exhibit a larger divergence and inferior spatial and spectral characteristics, 
but permit much simpler modulation techniques.
Infrared diodes can be classified according to their structure, operation, 
manufacturing process and direction of emission, to name just a few classifica­
tion criteria. All devices feature an active region (or laser cavity) which consists 
typically of undoped low-bandgap material surrounded by higher bandgap n-type 
(donor) and p-type (acceptor) material. Cross-sections through two typical diodes 
are depicted in Figs. 4.2 and 4.3.

ty. (After Lau 1988)
The principle of GaAlAs emitting diodes is explained with reference to Olsen 
and Ban (1987). Under forward bias, electrons from the n-region and holes from 
the p-type region are injected into the active region. The confinement of these car­
riers to the active region is achieved by the energy barriers and refractive index 
steps at each heterojunction. This confinement leads to electron-hole recombina­
tion in the active layer that generates spontaneous and incoherent infrared emis­
sion in all directions. The external quantum efficiency of such LED’s (Light 
Emitting Diodes), namely the ratio of emitted photons to input electrical power, 
is only a few percent. The high refractive index of the GaAlAs semiconductor ma­
terial (3.5 to 3.6) causes most of the radiation to be reflected (by total reflection) 
at the semiconductor/air interfaces and absorbed internally.
Following again Olson and Ban (1987), the working principle of lasing diodes 
is derived from that of the LED’s discussed above: Each photon generated within 
the active layer can stimulate the recombination of additional electron-hole pairs 
to emit photons that are coherent (same wavelength and phase) with it. With in­
creased injection current, the gain due to the stimulated emission can approach 
and then exceed the absorption losses in the active layer. The device becomes an 
amplifier and exhibits a narrowing of the emitted spectrum as well as an abrupt 
increase of radiated power (lasing). Amplification is greatest parallel to the active 
layer [and perpendicular to the mirrored end faces if a Fabry-Perot cavity (see Fig. 
4.3) is provided]. This is due to the waveguiding effect of the refractive index steps 
at the layer boundaries and the gain profile defined by the material parameters. 
Typically, lasing diodes exhibit higher output, narrower spectral bandwidths and 
permit higher modulation rates.
In terms of structure, homojunction, single heterojunction and double hetero­
junction diodes are distinguished. For example, Figs. 4.2 and 4.3 show a double 
heterojunction surface emitting diode and a heterojunction edge emitting lasing 
35

diode, respectively. Increases in the complexity of the layer structure provide thin­
ner and better-defined active layers, faster response times, reduced drive currents 
and narrower bandwidths of the emitted radiation. The wavelength of the emitted 
radiation is determined by the structure, doping level, aluminium content and 
operating temperature of these GaAlAs devices. In principle, emission wave­
lengths between 710 and 900 nm can be achieved. However, devices with visible 
wavelengths below 800 nm have been rare so far.
In comparison with lasing diodes infrared emitting diodes (usually referred to 
as LED’s) provide a lower temperature sensitivity, a superior linearity of output 
power versus input current characteristic, higher reliability, lower cost, greater 
availability, lower degradation rate, gradual (rather than catastrophic) failure 
characteristics, permit operation at higher temperatures and require less com­
plicated circuitry. Most EDM instruments have their infrared diodes mounted on 
printed circuit boards with the output coupled through glass fibres to the 
transmitting telescope (pig-tailed diodes). In consequence, small area high ra­
diance diodes are favoured. Figure 4.2 depicts an early design of such a surface 
emitting diode (Burrus 1972). The active area has typically a diameter of 50 
micrometre. Small emitting areas can also be achieved by edge emitting LED’s.
Different designs are employed for continuous (high duty cycle, low power) 
lasing diodes and for pulsed (low duty cycle, high power) diodes. The former type 
is typically used for fibre optics communication systems and EDM and employs 
double heterojunction structures. It features rise/fall times of about 0.5 ns and 
modulation bandwidths of 10 GHz (Lau 1988). Figures 4.3 and 4.4 depict the 
cross-section and the output power versus input current characteristic of a typical 
laser diode. The transfer characteristic (Fig. 4.4) shows that lasing occurs only 
when the threshold current is exceeded. Below threshold, the lasing diode operates

as an emitting diode. When using lasing diodes it must be considered that the 
threshold current as well as slope of the output/input characteristic are strongly 
temperature-dependent. If follows that the drive current producing the maximum 
permissible output power is also temperature dependent, and thus must be 
changed with temperature if no burn-out at low temperatures is to occur. Laser 
diodes must therefore be temperature-stabilized (typically in interferometers) or 
their optical output must be monitored and stabilized through an adjustment of 
the drive current (most non-interferometry applications, including EDM).
The technical data of some typical diodes are listed in Table 4.1, which clearly 
shows the different operational parameters of pulsed and continuous wave lasing 
diodes. Gallium-aluminium-arsenide diodes have some further properties which 
are of particular relevance to EDM applications:
- The emission wavelengths of diodes change with temperature at a typical rate 
of 0.25 nm/°C, although higher values have been measured (Kopeika et al. 
1983: 0.36nm/°C). In EDM, scale changes of 0.004 ppm/°C result due to 
uncompensated errors in the first velocity correction. This can lead to an 
error of 0.1 ppm per 25 °C change from temperature at which wavelength is 
nominal.
- The actual emission wavelength of specific diode may differ from nominal (as 
stated in the manual of the EDM instrument) because of manufacturing 
tolerances of the diodes or change of diode supplier. Typically, these dif­
ferences are likely to be smaller than 15 nm. The resulting scale errors are thus 
likely to be smaller than 1.2 ppm.
- The output power of all diodes decreases with increased diode temperature 
and, thus, ambient temperature. The output power at +70°C may be 30% to 
50% less than at +25 °C. In the case of lasing diodes, larger currents are re­
quired at higher temperatures to maintain lasing. This increases power con­
sumption.
- The lifetime of GaAlAs diodes is limited due to gradual degradation of the 
devices. It is important to note that the lifetime for operation at 25 °C can be 
10 times longer than for operation at +50 °C. Typically, the output power 
drops to 75% after 10000 h of operation at room temperature.
37

It follows from the above properties that EDM instruments are best operated at 
the coolest possible temperature. Shading instruments will greatly assist in this 
matter.
— Because of transit time delays in the GaAlAs material of high refractive index, 
modulated signals emerging from different parts of the diode surface will 
typically not be fully in phase. The modulation signal on the infrared carrier 
will therefore not have a plane wavefront. The magnitude of the effect depends 
on the transit times of the holes and electrons to the p-n junction as well as 
on the design, size, shape and location of the electrical contacts. The rise times 
(time taken for the radiant flux to increase from 10 to 90% of its peak value 
in response to a step function in the drive current) and fall times of the diodes 
give an indication of the delays involved. The so-called phase inhomogeneities 
can be determined by scanning of the diode surface. Figures 4.5 and 4.6 depict 
scans of power and phase across the emitting surface of a diode (after Leitz 
1977; Daino et al. 1976). The maximum variation of phase of 90 mm in Fig. 
4.6 refers to a worse than average diode of earlier design. The glass fibres used 
in most distance meters to connect the diode with the telescope of the instru­
ment have a smoothing effect so that the transmitted beam is likely to exhibit 
reduced phase inhomogeneities.
Because of the basically linear relationship between input (injection) current and 
output power (radiant flux) of infrared emitting diodes (over entire operating 
range) and lasing diodes (specific sections below and above threshold current, on­
ly), the infrared output beam can easily be modulated. Considering the input ver­
sus output characteristic in Fig. 4.4, it becomes evident that a sinusoidal variation 
of the drive current between 10.2 A and 11.8 A leads to a sinusoidal modulation 
of the output power between 0.2 W and 0.75 W.

Further information on diodes, their properties and applications may be 
found in Hayashi (1984); Kressel and Ettenberg (1982); Arecchi and Schulz- 
Dubois (1972) and Sze (1969), for example.
4.L2.2 Direct Demodulation
Photodiodes have the property of transforming radiation into electrical current: 
the higher the radiation power, the higher the current flow through the diode. The 
mechanism of photodiodes will not be explained in depth, because they display 
basically the reverse effect of emitting diodes. EDM instruments use mainly 
silicon (PIN) photodiodes or Si-avalanche photodiodes (APD). The latter pro­
duce a much higher amplification due to the internal multiplication (avalanche) 
effect. The properties and deficiencies of photodiodes are similar to those of IR 
emitting and lasing diodes. Please refer, for example, to Webb et al. (1974) and 
Arecchi and Schulz-Dubois (1972) for further details on photodiodes.
4,1.23 Indirect Modulation
Indirect modulation may be achieved by passing a continuous light beam through 
two polaroid filters of perpendicular polarization planes. Between the two filters 
the plane of the polarized light is rotated by a special device in phase with a 
modulation signal. This results in an amplitude modulated light beam emerging 
from the second filter. The principle is explained in Fig. 4.7. Two devices for the 
rotation of the polarization plane are commonly used in conjunction with EDM 
instruments.

LIGHT
SOURCE
Fig. 4.7. Principle of indirect modulation using Kerr cell. The two Polaroid filters Pt and P2 
are mounted in such a way that their polarization planes are at a right angle to each other. A 
diagram of output power versus modulation signal is shown on the right and refers to the inten­
sity variations of the light beam after passing through P2
Kerr Cell. The Kerr cell is a glass tube filled with nitrobenzene and containing two 
built-in parallel plates, which form the two electrodes of a capacitor. A potential 
difference across these plates causes a rotation of the plane of polarization of 
light passing between them. This electro-optical Kerr-effect makes it possible by 
rotating the incident polarization plane of light, to modulate the intensity of the 
emerging light beam.
In Fig. 4.7, Pi and P2 indicate polaroid filters with polarization planes set 
perpendicular. The Kerr cell’s electrodes make an angle of 45° with the polariza­
tion planes of Pt and P2.
In order to produce the light modulation shown, the modulation frequency is 
superimposed on the high bias voltage applied to the Kerr cell electrodes. See 
Saastamoinen (1969) for details of Kerr cells. The Geodimeter models 6, 6A, 6B, 
6 BL, 700/710, 600 as well as all earlier Geodimeter instruments, were equipped 
with Kerr cells.
Electro-Optic Crystals. A number of crystals exhibit the linear electro-optical ef­
fect called Pockel’s effect. From linear polarized light at the input face of the 
crystal elliptically polarized light is produced at the output face with the semi-axes 
of the ellipse changing with the applied modulation frequency. After passing a 
second polarizing filter, the emerging light beam is amplitude-modulated. 
Crystals exhibiting the Pockel’s effect are potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP, 
KH4PO4), ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (ADP, NH4, H2PO4), lithium 
niobate (LiNbO3) and lithium tantalate (LiTaO3), to name just a few. KDP 
crystals are employed in the AGA Geodimeter Model 8, the Kern Mekometer 
ME 3000 and the Com-Rad Geomensor 204 DME. Keuffel and Esser did develop 
lithium tantalite modulating crystals for use in Rangemaster II and III as well as 
some Ranger models (Erickson 1983).
4.1.2.4 Indirect Demodulation
Indirect demodulation is mostly combined with the subsequent phase measure­
ment. Two devices of this kind are used in present-day instruments.
40

Photomultiplier. The conversion of light into electric current by means of 
photomultipliers has already been mentioned in Section 4.1.1. The photomul­
tiplier can be operated with a modulated voltage, the modulation being equal to 
that of the outgoing light wave. The photomultiplier will then produce a maxi­
mum current output when the transmitted and the received measuring signals are 
in phase. It will produce a minimum current if both signals have a phase dif­
ference of 180°. The Geodimeter models 6, 6 A, 6B, 600, 8 and 700/710 are equip­
ped with photomultipliers.
Electro-Optic Crystals. Electro-optic crystals can not only be used for modulation 
but also for demodulation purposes. The same amplitude-modulated voltage ap­
plied to the transmitter crystal is applied to the receiver crystal. A maximum light 
output after the second crystal and its Polaroid filter results if there is no phase 
difference between transmitted and received signal. For a phase difference of 180° 
the light output would be zero. Such a system is employed in the Mekometer 
ME 3000 where the light output is detected by a photomultiplier. In the 
Mekometer ME 5000, a single crystal is used for modulation and demodulation. 
In this case, the light output is monitored by a photodiode.
4.1.3 Methods of Phase Measurement
4.L3.1 Optical-Mechanical Phase Measurement
The principle of optical-mechanical phase measurement is depicted in Fig. 4.8. 
The return signal travels through an internal light path the length of which can 
be varied by one full unit length. The phase difference can be measured easily and 
directly in terms of length, by recording that displacement of the moving prisms 
which is required to null the null-indicator. Such a manual system is employed in 
the Mekometer ME 3000, where it has been found to be unaffected by cyclic er­
rors. However, linear errors over the 0.3 m unit length were found in some in­
struments. A similar though less convenient arrangement was already employed 
in the Geodimeter NASM2 in 1950.
4.1.3.2 Electric Analogue Phase Measurement
The principle of the analogue phase measurement involves the delay of a reference 
signal of the same characteristics as the transmitted signal until a zero phase lag 
with the return signal is obtained. Electrical delay lines are mostly designed as 
resolvers, which are very similar to an electric motor. The phase angle therefore 
becomes a physical quantity based on the revolution of the resolver. All in­
struments equipped with resolvers (e.g. Geodimeters 6 and 8, Wild Distomat

measurement interval. These so-called cyclic errors are sometimes termed the non­
linearity of the phase measurement. The wave length of such cyclic errors is nor-

The Hewlett-Packard HP3800B featured another system of analogue phase 
measurement where the phase angle was transformed into a direct current. In this 
process some systematic errors may also occur but will not be of sinusoidal 
nature.
The testing of analogue phase measurement systems is usually carried out in 
conjunction with the examination of cyclic errors.
4.1.3.3 Electric Digital Phase Measurement
The digital phase measurement is based on the comparison of two low-frequency 
sinusoidal signals of equal frequency. One signal is the reference (or transmitted) 
signal, the other the return signal. Both signals are converted into square waves 
and operate a gate. The gate is opened when the reference signal begins a new cy­
cle, and closed when the return signal does the same. During the time of the open 
gate, pulses from a high frequency oscillator are accumulated in a counter (see 
Fig. 4.9 for the corresponding block diagram).
The phase difference between the two signals can be deduced in two different 
ways. A first possibility is depicted in Fig. 4.10, which also illustrates the whole 
measurement: (1) depicts the reference (transmitted) signal, (2) the return signal, 
(3) the triggered reference signal, (4) the triggered return signal, (5) shows the 
phase counts “i” between the opening of the gate (GO) and the closure of the gate 
(GC). In (6), a full wavelength is counted (“j” counts). The phase difference L 
can be computed according to Fig. 4.10 as:
L = -xU , 
(4.1)
j
where U is the unit length which corresponds to the frequency of reference and 
return signals.
This procedure does not need a constant ratio between the oscillator’s high 
frequency and the low frequency of the return and reference signals.
Another solution is possible if the high frequency pulses are in a fixed ratio 
to the low frequency of the measurement signals. This can be easily achieved, if

ference between reference 
and return signals are

the reference signal on

both frequencies are derived from the same master oscillator in the transmitter. 
In the Hewlett-Packard HP 3805, for example; the return and reference signals 
have a low frequency of 3745 Hz whilst the high frequency pulses are at 
14987103 Hz. There are therefore, during one full low frequency cycle, exactly 
4000 pulses of the high frequency. The number of “j” need not be measured but 
is obtained by calculation as 4000. This leads to the following formula for the 
phase difference L:

4.2 Microwave Instruments
As microwave distance meters are not discussed in more detail later in this text, 
some information in addition to the basic working principle is given here. For fur­
ther details of such instruments, the reader may refer to Burnside (1982); Kahmen 
(1977); Laurila (1976); Rinner and Benz (1966) and Saastamoinen (1969), for ex­
ample.
4.2.1 Introduction
Microwave instruments, like optical instruments, measure along the shortest path 
between the two instruments and therefore need intervisibility between the sta­
tions. (It is, however, possible to measure long distances a few metres above the 
sea without the requirement of intervisibility.) Several carrier wavelengths have 
been used in microwave EDM, 8 mm (Q band), 18 mm (K band), 30 mm (X band) 
and 100 mm (S band). S band instruments display very large ground swing effects, 
while Q band instruments have less power to penetrate haze and cloud and 
therefore have a reduced range. For these reasons X band and K band instruments 
have proved to be the most popular.
Microwave instruments are mainly used for the measurement of long 
distances, up to 150 km, although their all-weather capability may justify even 
medium or short range applications. The accuracy of microwave distances is 
mainly dependent on the accuracy of the refractive index. With measurement of 
atmospherical parameters at the terminals only, an accuracy of 2-3 ppm may be 
expected. Higher accuracies may be achieved by using better atmospheric models.
4.2.2 Working Principle and Components
A general outline of a microwave instrument using an analogue phase measuring 
system will now be given. Figure 4.11 depicts the basic design of the Tellurometer, 
the first microwave instrument which became available in 1957. In Fig. 4.11, the 
two functions of microwave instruments are clearly distinguished, namely the 
“master” and the “remote” mode. However, both modes are usually incorporated 
in the instrument at each terminal of a line, so that the distance can be measured 
in “forward” and “reverse” directions.
The presence of a parabolic or horn radio antenna and the absence of optical 
parts are the most obvious differences from an electro-optical EDM instrument. 
In addition, microwave instruments not only make use of amplitude modulation 
(AM) but also of frequency modulation (FM) and they provide a built-in phone 
link between the two stations.

MASTER STATION

employing analogue phase measurement techniques
The oscillator has the same function as that in electro-optical instruments. It 
can be switched through different quartz crystals to produce several modulation 
frequencies. Because microwave instruments are long range instruments, oscillator 
frequencies have to be temperature-controlled, normally by provision of an oven.
The klystron or cavity resonator is an electronic tube producing a microwave. 
It is operated in such a way that the emerging microwave is frequency modulated 
by an oscillator frequency.
In newer microwave instruments solid state microwave sources (Gunn Diodes) 
are used instead of klystrons.
The antenna can be of parabolic shape (about 300 mm diameter) and has two 
small dipoles at its focus. These are perpendicular to each other and set at 45° 
to the vertical. Transmitted and received signals are polarized in two planes 
perpendicular to each other.
The mixer mixes transmitted and received signals at the antenna.
Demodulators demodulate amplitude modulated (AM) signals into alter­
nating currents (AC).
Discriminators demodulate frequency modulated (FM) signals into alter­
nating currents.
The functions of the resolver, phase detector, null indicator and the diplay 
have already been discussed.
To obtain a distance measurement, the master and remote stations transmit 
frequency modulated signals at slightly different frequencies of carrier and 
modulation. At the time of transmission, the phases of the modulations signals 
are taken as <pM and <pR, respectively. Due to the flight time of the signal be­
tween the stations the two stations receive the following phase informations:
at remote station: ((PM+ti^i) 
(4.3)
at master station: (<pR+tt <n2) , 
(4.4) 
45

where the angular velocities of the modulation signals at master and remote sta­
tions are denoted by Ot and a>2, respectively.
Through mixing of transmitted and received signals at both stations, the 
following phase differences can be derived:
at master station: (p^ = (Pm-C^r+Ii^ 
(4.5)
at remote station: <Pr = ((pM+tcoi)-(pR . 
(4.6)
The master phase difference information is demodulated by the demodulator and 
then used as “return” signal in the phase measurement process.
Because both phase differences must be available at the master station for the 
final phase measurement, the phase difference gained at the remote station is 
transmitted back to the master instrument by an additional frequency modulation 
of the remote carrier wave. After demodulation in the discriminator, the remote 
measurement (with the added time delay of the beat signal) is available at the 
master station and used as “reference” signal in the phase measurement process:
<PM = (<PM+t®i)-<PR+t1((01-a)2) . 
(4.7)
Subtraction of the master phase difference from the (relayed) remote phase dif­
ference leads to the following expression:
<Pm-<Pm = <Pm+t(0i -<pR+1®! -(tt(O2)-<pM + <pR+tj0)2 , 
and, after taking note of the cancellation of some if not most terms:
A<p = ItiCOt .

4.2.3 Effects of Reflections in Microwave EDM (Multipath)
Because microwave instruments have a much larger beam divergence than optical 
instruments, certain parts of the beam may reach the ground or other reflecting 
surfaces and may be reflected there. The reflected wave travels a longer distance 
and, being received with the direct wave, has an effect on the measurement of the 
distance. The effect is usually called ground swing. The amplitude of the ground 
swing is dependent on the reflectivity of the specific ground surface. Water, snow 
and street surfaces may be highly reflective (Kiipfer 1968).
The multipath effect has been expressed in mathematical terms by Poder 
(Saastamoinen 1969) and Kiipfer (1968). Ground swing is mainly a function of 
the excees path length, the reflectivity of the reflecting surface, the modulation 
frequency and the carrier frequency. The last two parameters can be chosen by 
46

the designer of such instruments, and this has led to two different instrumental 
designs for the reduction of ground swing:
1. One such design involves the measurement of a distance with up to 20 slightly 
different carrier wavelengths. The resulting distances may then exhibit slight 
variations, which may be plotted. If a sine curve eventuates, the mean may be 
taken and this will be free from ground swing effects. For very large and small 
(< 1.3 m) excess path lengths however, no full “swing” curve is obtained and 
the mean is hard to estimate (Kupfer 1968). Different carrier waves are, for ex­
ample, used in the Tellurometers MRA-5, MRA-7 and CA1000.
2. Another method of reducing ground swing is the use of higher modulation 
frequencies. This method was adopted in the Siemens-Albis MD60 (equivalent 
to the former Wild Distomat DI 60), where a modulation frequency of 
150 MHz (unit length = 1 m) is employed (Kupfer et al. 1971) and to a lesser 
extent in the Tellurometers MRA-5 and MtRA-7 (unit length = 1.87 m).
Ground swing may be further reduced by setting up instruments in positions 
where the reflected beam is prevented from reaching the antenna by a hump in 
front of the instrument or by ensuring that the beam cone never reaches any 
reflecting surfaces (peak to peak, tower to tower) (Rinner and Benz 1966). On flat 
ground, the effect may be reduced by setting-up very close to the ground (Kahmen 
1977), or by variation of the height of instrument. Kupfer (1968, p. 339, Fig. 16) 
has derived formulae indicating the necessary variation of the height of instru­
ment in order to obtain a full period of the ground swing for various excess path 
lengths and distances.

5 Propagation of Electromagnetic Waves Through the 
Atmosphere
5.1 Atmospheric Transmittance
The transmittance of the atmosphere is usually described by the quotient of inci­
dent radiant power divided by transmitted radiant power. It is a measure of the 
attenuation and extinction of wave propagation. The transmittance is a function 
of numerous variables: wavelength, distance, temperature, barometric pressure, 
gaseous mixture, rain, snow, dust, aerosols, bacteria and, in more detail, the size 
of particles of all these constituents. The limitations of atmospheric transmit­
tance are given by the scattering and absorption of the emitted radiation. Scatter­
ing by air molecules (Rayleigh Scattering) and scattering by larger aerosol par­
ticles (Mie scattering) can be distinguished. Absorption in several spectral regions 
is mainly caused by water vapour, carbon dioxide and ozone. Figure 5.1 depicts 
the transmittance of atmosphere as a function of wavelength for a part of the visi­
ble and near-infrared (NIR) spectrum under specific conditions. The figure shows 
that only a limited part of the NIR spectrum is suitable for EDM.
Attenuation of radiation through the atmosphere is the intensity reduction of 
wave propagation through scattering and absorption [attenuation (in %) = 100 
minus transmittance (in %)] and may be expressed by Bouguer’s rule
J = 4e’zd, 
(5.1)
d
where J = radiant intensity at some distance d from the emitter
Jo = radiant intensity at emitter 
d = distance 
z = attenuation coefficient or extinction coefficient.
The first factor of Eq. (5.1) accounts for the purely geometrical propagation. The 
second, exponential, factor accounts for the transmittance of the atmosphere. The 
attenuation coefficient is a function of several variables already mentioned at the 
beginning of this section.
If the “visibility range” or the “meteorological range” is known, the attenua­
tion coefficient can be derived as
where zv is the attenuation coefficient for the visible spectrum (XEFF = 0.555 pm) 
and dv is the meteorological range in kilometres. The meteorological range is 
defined as the distance over which a large, black target (such as a pine forest) can 
just be distinguished from the horizon.

26 °C and at a partial water vapour pressure of 8 mb. (After RCA 1974). Water molecules 
(H2O) cause the absorption effects at 930, 1120, 1450 and 1900 nm, for example. Carbon diox­
ide is responsible for the absorption effects at 1400 and 2050 nm. Both constituents of air cause 
the total loss of transmittance between 2550 and 2800 nm
In EDM, the transmittance of the atmosphere affects the range of instruments 
and the strength of the return signal.
5.2 Range of EDM Instruments
Following Eq. (5.1) and Leitz (1977), the range of a distance meter can be express­
ed as
Ry = (y/a)°'5e“zRy , 
(5.3)
where Ry = range of distance meter with y prisms (in km)
a = instrument specific parameter depending on energy density of trans­
mitter, sensitivity of receiver, aperture of telescopes, aperture of 
prisms (in km-2)
z = attenuation coefficient (in km-1) 
y = number of prisms used.
An iterative procedure is required for a solution of the above equation and the 
parameters a and z need to be known. Leitz (1977) quotes 0.2 km“2 and 
0.38 km-1 for a and z, respectively, and for a Zeiss Eldi 2 and average weather 
conditions. The same author uses z values of 0.3 and 0.5 for a visibility of 8 km 
and overcast conditions and sunny conditions with strong heat shimmer, respec­
tively.
In the case of the instrument specific parameter a not being known, an alter­
native approach can be chosen. Richter (1970), considering Eqs. (5.1) and (5.2), 
derived an equation which permits the computation of the range of a distance 
49

meter for a particular visibility if the range of the same distance meter is already 
known for another visibility.

The attenuation coefficient z can be computed as the ratio X/dv as in Eq. (5.2). 
The value of 2.5 for X agrees with the z values suggested by Leitz (1977) for over­
cast conditions. For sunny conditions with strong heat shimmer, Leitz employs X 
values between 4.0 and 4.5.
Equation (5.4) allows for the computation of the range Rj at dv. if dVo is 
known for R^; iteration is required for a solution. It so to say reflects the condi­
tion for a single prism observation. With a number y of prisms, the range Ry 
computes as follows:
Ry. — Rj

(5.5)
A term (y)1/3 instead of (y)1/2 is employed for the AGA Geodimeter 14; (y)1/2 is 
used for the AGA Geodimeter 600. Equations (5.4) and (5.5) in connection with 
experimental data permit the computation of range versus visibility diagrams. An 
example is shown in Fig. 5.2.

tance meter. (After Geotronics AB, 1985)
50

The above range equations should be used with caution, as the effective range 
does not solely depend on the visual range. In practice, the range is also affected 
by the quality and condition of the prisms (temperature gradients through the 
prism cause deformations), atmospheric turbulence and heat shimmer, ambient 
light, atmospheric brightness and ground reflections (Ehbets et al. 1983). These 
authors define good conditions as overcast, no haze, 30 km visibility, no heat tur­
bulence, and poor conditions as very hazy, 3 km visibility or strong sunlight with 
substantial heat turbulence. The measuring range differs by a factor of 5 between 
good and poor conditions. Best range is achieved in overcast conditions, at dawn 
and, particularly, at night, when air turbulence is minimal and the signal-to-noise 
ratio of the photodiode improved due to the reduction in ambient light (Ehbets 
et al. 1983).
5.3 Phase Refractive Index
The phase refractive index n of a medium is defined as
n = — , 
(5.6)
c
where c0 = velocity of light in a vacuum
c = velocity of light in a medium (phase velocity).
The refractive index of air is a function of:
1. the gaseous composition of the atmosphere, which is very nearly a constant 
2. the amount of water vapour pressure in the atmosphere
3. the temperature of the gaseous mixture
4. the pressure of the gaseous mixture
5. the frequency of the radiated signal.
The variation of the refractive index with frequency constitutes the phenomenon 
of dispersion.
5.4 Group Refractive Index of Light and NIR Waves for Standard 
Conditions
In electro-optical EDM, the refractive index is dependent on the wavelength of 
the visible or infrared radiation, i.e. a well-defined frequency and its associated 
frequency band which is formed by several frequencies. The different frequencies 
would have the same propagation velocity in a vacuum, but not in air, as in­
terference between the different frequencies occurs. The signal resulting from the 
sum of all frequencies will have the so-called group velocity which is always 
smaller than the phase velocities of its individual frequencies:
de
cg = 
% , 
(5.7)
a a,
51

where cg and c are the group velocity and phase velocity respectively.
Calling ng the group refractive index, the following equation may be written:
c0 = cgng . 
(5.8)
Substitution of Eqs. (5.8) and (2.4) in Eq. (5.7) leads to
Co = Co_d(coAOx 
(59)
ng n dX
and, after differentiation of the bracket term, to
(5)0)
ng n dX
From an expansion with (ngn/c0) follows 
and after setting (ng/n) = 1.0 and rearranging
ng = n-— 1, 
(5.11)
8 dX
where X is the wavelength in a vacuum.
As soon as an equation for n = f (X) is known, it may be differentiated and 
the group refractive index derived.
The group refractive index may be calculated according to Barrell and Sears 
(1939):
z xx xzv6 ^o^^zxx „/1.6288\ c /0.0136\
(ng-l)xl06 = 287.604+3 I---- F~)+5 (----~ ) 5 
(5.12)
where X is expressed in pm (micrometres).
This formula is valid for visible light in dry air at 0°C, 1013.25 mb 
(760 mm Hg) and 0.03 percent CO2. X is the “effective” wavelength in a vacuum. 
Equation (5.12) describes the group refractive index with an accuracy of 
±0.1 ppm or better.
Equation (5.12) was derived from experiments at wavelengths between 436 and 
644 nm. It was adopted in 1963 by the XHIth General Assembly of the Interna­
tional Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG) in Berkley, together with 
another formula by Edlen (1953). Both adopted formulae agree within 0.1 ppm 
for wavelengths of 560 nm as well as 900 nm.
The agreement of Eq. (5.12) with the more recent dispersion formulae by 
Edlen (1966) and Peck and Reeder (1972) is better than 0.1 ppm at wavelengths 
between 400 and 1000 nm. The above equation can therefore be used in connec­
tion with infrared distance meters. However, for high precision EDM at all visible 
and infrared wavelengths, it is strongly recommended that the formulae listed in 
Appendix A be used in place of Eq. (5.12).
52

Refractive index formulae refer to standard air which is defined as dry air at 
15 °C [note that Eq. (5.12) is defined at zero degrees Celsius] and at a total 
pressure of 1013.25 mb. The molar (or volume) percentages of the major consti­
tuents are 78.09% nitrogen (N2), 20.95% oxygen (O2), 0.93% argon (Ar) and 
0.03% carbon dioxide (CO2) (Owens 1967). The concentrations of some constant 
minor constituents are (Iribarne and Cho 1980): neon (Ne) 18 ppm, helium (He) 
5 ppm, methane (CH4) 1.5 ppm, krypton (Kr) 1 ppm, hydrogen (H2) 0.5 ppm. 
Typical concentrations of some variable constituents depend on pollution levels: 
ozone (O3) 0.005-0.5 ppm, nitrogen dioxide (NO^ 0.001-0.1 ppm.
It is known that the amount of carbon dioxide and methane in the air are in­
creasing with time. The carbon dioxide content increased from 316 ppm in 1974 
to 346 ppm in 1985 and might reach 600 ppm by volume in 2070. The latter con­
tent would lead to an error of 0.05 ppm in refractive index computed with Eq. 
(5.12). The methane content increased from 1.52 ppm in 1977 to 1.65 ppm by 
volume in 1985. However, values of 4 ppm have been measured close to the 
ground in urban areas. The normal concentration of carbon monoxide is 0.1 ppm 
but can reach 7.5 ppm close to the ground in urban areas (Pelli and Meier- 
Bukowiecki 1986).
For distances measured in enclosed rooms (factories, laboratories) the refrac­
tive index formulae specified for standard air may also not apply in all cir­
cumstances. As a worst case example, the effect of a non-standard atmosphere in 
the car manufacturing industry onto the refractive index was computed as 
1.9 ppm (Wilkening 1986). If the composition of a particular non-standard at­
mosphere is known, the refractive index equations for standard atmosphere [Eq. 
(5.12), Appendix A] can be corrected accordingly (see Bittel 1985; Landolt-Born- 
stein 1962).
5.4.1 First Example
The Hewlett-Packard Distance Meter HP 3800B has a Ga-As diode emitting at a 
wavelength of 910 nm. Under standard conditions of 0°C, 1013.25 mb, dry air 
(e = 0) and 0.03% CO2 in the air, the group refractive index reads:
(n,-1)10‘=287.604+i^+“?® 
(5.13)
and for % = 0.910 pm,
(ng — l)106 = 293.604
ng = 1.0002936 .
5.4.2 Second Example
The distance meter section of the Topcon ET-1 electronic tacheometer employs a 
GaAlAs diode emitting at 820 nm.
53

For standard conditions (see above) the group refractive index computes as 
(ng — 1) 106 = 287.604+7.2671+0.1504
= 295.022 
ng= 1.0002950 .
5.4.3 Third Example
Long range instruments such as AGA Geodimeter 8, Geodimeter 600, K+E 
Rangemaster II as well as Ranger V employ He-Ne lasers as radiation source: 
X = 632.8 nm
= 287.604+12.203+0.424
= 300.231
ng = 1.0003002 (for 0°C, 1013.25 mb, dry air, 0.03% CO2) .
5.4.4 Error Analysis
Differentiating Eq. (5.12) with respect to the wavelength demonstrates that an er­
ror of 5 nm in wavelength causes an error of 0.08 ppm in the group refractive 
index. The carrier wavelength must therefore be known quite accurately. This is 
the case with stabilized gas lasers such as HeNe lasers, which are monochromatic 
and feature well-defined wavelengths. Short range distance meters employ typical­
ly GaALAs diodes which may have a centre wavelength 10 to 20 nm off the 
nominal value (stated in the instrument’s handbook) and which may exhibit a 
drift of the centre wavelength of 0.25 nm per degree Celsius (see Chap. 4.1.2.1 for 
details). Both effects limit the accuracy with which ng can be computed for in­
frared distance meters.
5.5 Group Refractive Index of Light and NIR Waves 
at Ambient Conditions
The International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG) resolved in 1963 at 
its Xlllth General Assembly in Berkley that the refractive index in electronic dis­
tance measurement be reduced to ambient conditions by
ng-l p _ 4.125 X1O~8

where nL = group refractive index valid for atmospheric conditions described by 
t, p, e.
t = “dry bulb” temperature of air (°C)
p = atmospheric pressure (mb)
a = coefficient of expansion of air (= 0.003661 per °C) 
e = partial water vapour pressure (mb).
The above formula is a simplified version of the interpolation equation given by 
Barrell and Sears (1939). It can also be found in Kohlrausch (1955), although with 
a slightly different value for the coefficient of expansion of air. Expansion of the 
above equation with 273.15( = 1/a) leads to the final form of the interpolation 
formula.

(5.15)
Barrel and Sears (1939) state that their equation is valid (at the ±0.015 ppm level) 
for temperature and pressure ranges of +10 to +30 °C and 720 to 800 mm Hg, 
respectively. No range of partial water vapour pressures is stated. However, 
Edlen’s (1966) statement of “not deviating too much from 10 mm” may be taken 
as a guide. Edge (1960) stated a maximum error of the above equation of 0.2 ppm 
for temperature and pressure ranges of -40 °C to +50 °C and 533 to 1067 mb, 
respectively.
The numerous deficiencies of Eqs. (5.14) and (5.15) were evaluated by Deichl 
(1984) and their systematic errors (the computed refractive index is too large) esti­
mated as about 0.15 ppm at t = 20 °C, p = 1013.25 mb and e = 13.3 mb. The same 
author notes errors of at least 0.4 ppm at +45 °C and 100% relative humidity. 
The humidity term is clearly a weak element in the above equations.
For high precision EDM at all visible and infrared wavelengths and whenever 
the systematic errors mentioned above are not tolerable, it is strongly recommend­
ed that the formulae listed in Appendix A be used in lieu of Eqs. (5.12), (5.14) 
and (5.15).
5.5.7 Error Analysis
The effects of errors in the variables p, t and e on the derived quantity nL may 
be analyzed by their partial differentials. For a temperature of 15 °C, a pressure 
of 1007 mb, a partial water vapour pressure of 13 mb and a group refractive index 
ng of 1.0003045 differentiation of Eq. (5.15) yields:
dnLxlO6= —1.00 dt+0.28 dp-0.04 de , 
(5.16)
where dnL = differential of the (group) refractive index of light 
dt = differential of temperature t (°C) 
dp = differential of pressure p (mb)
de = differential of partial water vapour pressure e (mb).
The significance of Eq. (5.16) can be summarized as follows:
55

1. An error in t of 1 °C affects refractive index and distance by 1 ppm.
2. An error in p of 1.0 mb affects refractive index and distance by 0.3 ppm.
3. An error in e of 1 mb affects the refractive index by 0.04 ppm and e therefore 
need not be known very accurately.
Temperature is critical for the determination of the refractive index. Temperature 
may be measured accurately at both terminals of a line and the refractive index 
calculated for both terminals and the mean taken. Even so, the mean value of the 
refractive index generally does not represent the prevailing integral value over the 
wave path to better than 1 ppm. The accuracy of electro-optical distance measure­
ment is therefore normally limited to 1 ppm of the measured distance, although 
a better accuracy (> 0.1 ppm) can be obtained using special techniques (see Sect. 
5.9.3 for more details).
5.5.2 Omission of Humidity
Very often, the effect of the partial water vapour pressure e is omitted in formulae 
provided by manufacturers. Ignoring the following term of Eq. (5.15)

The relative humidity h is related to e. Its definition will be given later.
In summertime, the refractive index could be in error by 1.3 ppm in the 
Sydney area (30 °C, 80% relative humidity), if the partial water vapour pressure 
is not taken into account.
Users of reduction formulae or diagrams designed by instrument manufac­
turers should be aware of this fact. It is recommended that humidity be con­
sidered for more precise work and over longer distances.
5.6 Refractive Index of Micro waves
The Xlllth General Assembly (Berkley) of the International Union of Geodesy 
and Geophysics (IUGG) adopted in 1963 the formula by Essen and Froome 
56

(1951) (as amended) for the determination of the refractive index of microwaves. 
The equation is the result of experiments carried out at the National Physical 
Laboratory (U.K.) with the aid of cavity resonators.

where nM = refractive index for microwaves
t = “dry bulb” temperature of air (°C) 
p = pressure of air (mb)
e = partial water vapour pressure (mb).
According to Edge (1960), the accuracy of Eq. (5.17) is ±0.1 ppm under normal 
conditions and better than ±1.0 ppm under extreme conditions. The above equa­
tion is most accurate for wavelengths larger than 8 mm (frequencies smaller than 
40 MHz). Deichl (1984) noted that Essen and Froome used 273.00 in the 
denominator of the above equation. The same author states that the effects of 
this and other simplifications may cause systematic (refractive index too small) 
errors in the refractive index of microwaves of about 0.35 ppm.
5.6.1 Error Propagation
The total differential of Eq. (5.17) allows the effects of errors in p, t and e on nM 
to be assessed. The coefficients of the total differential are computed for 
t = 10°C, p = 1013.25 mb and e = 13 mb.
dnMxl06= -1.4dt+0.3dp+4.6de , 
(5.18)
where dnM = differential of refractive index of microwaves nM
dt = differential of temperature t (°C) 
dp = differential of pressure p (mb) 
de = differential of partial water vapour pressure e (mb).
Equation (5.18) leads to the following statements:
1. An error of 1 °C in t causes an error of 1.4 ppm in nM and therefore in dis­
tance.
2. An error of 1 mb in the atmospheric pressure p causes an error of 0.3 ppm in 
nM or distance.
3. An error of 1 mb in the partial water vapour pressure e causes an error of 
4.6 ppm in nM or distance.
From these values it becomes obvious that the critical parameter in the case of 
refractive index of microwaves is the partial water vapour pressure. This is the 
main reason why microwave measurements are likely to be of lower accuracy than 
the corresponding measurements using light or “near-infrared”. An accuracy 
better than ±3 ppm in nM cannot easily be achieved, even if e is measured very 
precisely at both instrument stations, unless special techniques are employed 
(Sect. 5.9.3).
57

Unlike measurements with light wave carriers, microwave EDM requires the 
partial water vapour pressure e to be measured under all circumstances, if the full 
precision is required. The measurement of e will be discussed later.
5.7 Coefficient of Refraction
It is known from the theory of trigonometric levelling, that the refractive index 
of air not only affects the velocity of light but also the geometry of its path. When 
a wave path passes through regions of differing refractive index n, the wave path 
will depart slightly from a straight line. The effect will be different for light waves 
and microwaves because of their different refractive indices.
If R is the mean radius of curvature of the spheroid along a line and r the 
radius of curvature of the wave path, the coefficient of refraction is defined as:
curvature of ray path _ 1/r _ R 
curvature of spheroid 1/R r
(5.19)
The curvature of the wave path itself is defined as
. 1
— smz - 
n
1
r
(5.20)
where (dn/dh) is the vertical gradient of the refractive index of air, and z is the 
angle between the direction of the gradient of the refractive index and the tangent 
to the wave path. The change of n with height h is caused by the vertical density 
gradient of air.
The following mean values are usually adopted for EDM lines high above the 
ground:
Light waves: kL = 0.13 rL = 8R .
Micro waves: kM — 0.25 rM — 4R .
(5.21)
(5.22)
These values may vary considerably under differing atmospheric conditions, for 
example during the night, at sunrise or at sunset. The variation of k increases the 
smaller the ground clearance of the lines becomes. Some examples may illustrate 
the range of values. Hopcke (1964) has reported the following range of refraction 
coefficients for the layer of air between 40 m and 100 m above ground.
k]M = +0.25 to +0.50 , k£ = +0.13 to +0.30 .
Larger variations were reported for the layer between 2 m and 13 m:
kM = -1.2 (early morning) to +3.5 (early evening) ;
kL = -0.5 (noon) to +2.5 (early morning) .
Brunner (1975) has reported refraction coefficients kL in the range of -2.3 to 
+ 1.5 for light paths 1.5 m over ground on clear days. The coefficients of refrac­
tion for rays in 3 m height above ground were found to be between -1.0 and +1.0 
on clear days. Riieger and Brunner (1981) found coefficients of refraction be-

tween —2.3 and +1.6 on clear days during an EDM height traversing experiment 
in Australia featuring line lengths between 190 m and 490 m.
Depending on latitude, season, ground cover and wind speed, the coefficient 
of refraction will exhibit a daily cycle on clear days (and nights). Figure 5.3 gives 
an indication of the magnitude of the cycle for different heights of lines above 
ground.
Different coefficients of refraction are experienced over ice. Lindner and Rit­
ter (1985) report changes of the coefficient of refraction for lines 1.5 to 1.8 m over 
ice in Antarctica from -0.2 to +3.0 to +5.0 on clear days between 13 h and 18 h 
and constant coefficients of +0.5 on overcast days during the same time period. 
Similar values of -0.5 (at 14 h) to +2.0 (at 18 h) are given by Ritter (1987) for 
clear and calm days with temperatures of about -5 °C and instrument heights of 
1.5 m. The same author lists the maximum value measured as k = 14.9. A good 
summary of measured coefficients of refraction over ice may be found in Angus- 
Leppan (1974).
The mean values given in Eqs. (5.21) and (5.22) should therefore be used with 
great caution for the reduction of electronic distance measurements. In long range
59

EDM, the coefficient of refraction is required for the first arc-to-chord correction 
as well as the second velocity correction. Where highest precision is required (such 
as in geodetic control networks), simultaneous reciprocal zenith angle measure­
ments should be carried out for the sole purpose of determination of k. In short 
range EDM, the coefficient of refraction is often required for the computation 
of horizontal distances and height differences. Considering Fig. 5.3, a value of 
k = 0.0 for the coefficient of refraction is as good an assumption as k = 0.13 in 
these cases. Where required, the uncertainty in the value of k can be greatly re­
duced by direct determination of the coefficient of refraction by simultaneous 
reciprocal zenith angle measurements.
5.8 Measurement of Atmospheric Parameters
The extent and precision required in the measurement of atmospheric parameters 
depends largely on the EDM instrument type, its internal accuracy, the distance 
accuracy required and the length to be measured. Temperature measurements for 
short range instruments with an internal accuracy of ±5 mm require a simple 
mercury thermometer for distances of about 1000 m; an aneroid will suffice for 
the measurement of pressure. For shorter distances of a few 100 m length, a good 
estimate of temperature (based on experience or weather information broadcast 
by radio/tv stations) and standard pressure at field elevation (refer to Appendix 
C - do not employ pressures reported in weather bulletins/broadcasts as they are 
reduced to sea level!) may be sufficient. Actual atmospheric pressures are unlikely 
to deviate by more than 30 mb from the standard pressure at the field elevation 
(see Appendix C) and, thus, unlikely to cause errors in excess of 1 mm over 100 m. 
An error of 10 °C in temperature, for example, would cause an error in a 100 m 
distance of only 1 mm, which can be neglected in relation to the instrument’s in­
ternal accuracy of ±5 mm. Thermometers and barometers used for these pur­
poses would not required precise calibration. However, regular comparison of the 
instruments with calibrated instruments or standards should be made.
Medium and long distance measurements with microwave instruments, long 
range measurements with light or infrared instruments and precision short range 
measurements require precise determination of atmospheric temperature, pressure 
and humidity at least at the terminals of the EDM line. Details of accurate 
meteorological measurements and some related computations follow in the next 
sections. More refined and alternative methods of refractive index determination 
are discussed in Section 5.9 and 6.5.
5.8.1 Measurement of Atmospheric Pressure
It has been demonstrated in Sections 5.5 and 5.6 that an error of 1 mb affects 
distances by only 0.3 ppm. Depending on the length of the EDM lines and the 
resolution of the distance meter used, good quality aneroid barometers are 
generally sufficient. Such instruments are:
60

1. Pocket barometers with accuracies of about ±1.0 mb
- with mechanical pick-up and display
- with electronic pick-up and display (least count: 1.0 mb)
2. Handheld (precision) barometers with accuracies of about ±0.5 mb
- with mechanical pick-up and display
- with electronic pick-up and display (least count: 0.1 mb).
Aneroid barometers may require corrections for temperature, scale errors and zero 
errors. They should be checked against a reference mercury barometer before and 
after field trips. Barometers can be submitted to National Standard Laboratories, 
local Bureaus of Meteorology and registered Testing Laboratories for calibration. 
A standard test would include the determination of the hysteresis effect, correc­
tions at a number of points over the full range of the barometer and possibly, an 
evaluation of the temperature compensation (National Measurement Laboratory 
1975).
Aneroids should be handled with great care and should always be set up level 
and in the shade. They should be allowed time to settle and be tapped gently 
before reading.
5.8.2 Measurement of Atmospheric Temperature
In connection with precision or long range EDM, the temperature should be mea­
sured with an instrument which provides an accuracy of ±0.2 °C. Such in­
struments are:
1. mercury-in-glass thermometers
2. platinum resistance thermometers
3. electronic thermistor thermometers.
The advantage of equipment (2) and (3) is that the actual measuring device 
(probe, sensor) is separated from the display unit, and from the thermal effects 
of the observer. The probe can be put on a mast, enabling a continuous, electronic 
recording of data. Temperatures should be measured in the shade, exposed to 
wind and well above the ground. The distance to any object, including the ground 
or people, should be more than 1.5 m. At low temperatures, mercury ther­
mometers should be shielded from the heat radiation of the human body by a 
transparent plastic plate. During distance measurement, temperature readings 
should be taken at a rate of at least one reading per minute for a minimum period 
of 5 min, to account for the fluctuations of meteorological parameters. Electronic 
devices have a much faster response to temperature changes than mercury ther­
mometers. More observations should therefore be taken to provide a reHable mean 
value if no automatic recording device is used. Thermometers should be 
calibrated from time to time, at least for the zero error. Graduation errors need 
to be checked at least once. Calibration services are usuaHy provided by the labo­
ratories listed in the previous section.
61

5.8.3 Measurement of Atmospheric Humidity
Three types of instruments and procedures for the measurement of atmospheric 
humidity are discussed below, although only the latter two are currently employed 
in EDM work.
L Hygrometer
The hair hygrometer was originally based on the change in length of human hair 
as a function of relative humidity. The present day hygrometers may also use 
other materials for the same purpose. Hair hygrometers provide the relative 
humidity directly in percent. The accuracy is about 3% which is not always ac­
curate enough for EDM purposes. Hygrometers have a very slow response to 
humidity changes and thus provide a mean value over a period of time.
2. Aspiration Psychrometer
Designed by R. Assmann, the aspiration psychrometer consists basically of two 
thermometers, one of which is covered with a cotton wick which must be kept wet 
with distilled water. The “dry bulb” and “wet bulb” thermometers are enclosed 
in tubes to protect them from radiation. An air current of at least 3 m/s is used 
to aspirate the thermometer bulbs. The psychrometer provides readings of the dry 
bulb and the wet bulb temperature from which the partial water vapour pressure 
is derived.
Two types of aspiration psychrometers are commercially available:
a) Mercury-in-glass psychrometer Originally designed by Assmann, these com­
prise a dry bulb and wet bulb thermometer and a small spring driven fan and are 
accurate to 0.2 °C.
b) Thermistor psychrometer. The mercury thermometers are replaced by ther­
mistors, which allow temperature readings at a distance from the probes. The fan 
is operated electrically. An accuracy of about 0.2 °C can be achieved.
In addition to the operating instructions for simple thermometers, given in 
Section 5.8.2, further care is required in using (mercury) psychrometers. After 
wetting the wet bulb wick, repeated readings must be taken to confirm that the 
wet bulb has reached its equilibrium. An increase in wet bulb temperatures may 
indicate that the wick has run dry. The wick must be clean and in contact with 
the thermometer. No water should bridge the gap between wick and shield. The 
pbserver should avoid breathing on the air intake, especially at low temperatures, 
4nd should stand clear of the instrument. More advice may be found in Bomford 
(1975, page 54). Some of the problems are eliminated if thermistor instruments 
are used.
A psychrometer should be calibrated periodically and needs some mainte­
nance with regard to the polished shields and thermometers and the replacement 
of the wick. The internal air velocity also must be checked and should be at least 
3 m/s to ensure proper functioning.
3. Humidity Sensors
With the emergence of hand-held solid state thin film humidity sensors, an alter­
native to psychrometer measurements has become available in EDM in cases 
62

where humidity (and partial water vapour pressure) is required, typically in preci­
sion EDM and long range EDM.
The humidity is sensed by a hygroscopic dielectric between two electrodes. By 
absorbing or desorbing water, the element puts itself in equilibrium with the am­
bient conditions and alters the capacitance of the device at the same time. The 
capacitance change is used to derive the humidity reading. The thin film reacts 
very fast, e.g. 5-10 s for 90% response. As the temperature is required to correct 
the humidity reading, humidity sensors used in surveying are typically combined 
with (platinum resistance) temperature sensors.
The accuracy of humidity sensors is typically specified as ±2% relative 
humidity (R.H.) between 0 and 80% R.H. and ±3% between 80 and 100% R.H. 
The temperature sensitivity of the humidity reading is typically 0.05% R.H./°C. 
Frequent calibration is essential to maintain these accuracies.
5.8.4 Computation of Partial Water Vapour Pressure 
from Psychrometer Measurements
The partial water vapour pressure e, which is required for the determination of 
the refractive index (see Sects. 5.6 and 5.5), can be derived from dry bulb and wet 
bulb readings of an aspiration psychrometer. The psychrometric equation by A. 
Sprung is (Rinner and Benz 1966, p. 228):
e = E^-0.000662p(t-t') , 
(5.23)
where E^ = saturation water vapour pressure for temperature t' (wet bulb tem­
perature) in mb over water
t = dry bulb temperature (°C)
t' = wet bulb temperature (°C) 
p = atmospheric pressure (mb) 
e = partial water vapour pressure (mb).
This formula is accurate to ± 1 % and valid for t > 0 °C and t' > 0 °C. In case of 
a frozen wet bulb wick, the following equation must be used:
e = E{ce-0.000583p(t-t') , 
(5.24)
where EJce is the saturation water vapour pressure over ice at the temperature t' 
(wet bulb temperature) in millibar.
The saturation water vapour pressure over water and over ice can be obtained 
from the table in Appendix B. Alternatively the saturation water vapour pressure 
may be calculated according to the equation by Magnus-Tetens (Rinner and Benz 
1966, p. 228):
E(v = 10^.5t'/(237.3+t'))+0.7858] 
(5.25)
Eice = 10[(9-5t7(265-5+t/))+0-78581 
(5.26)
or its revised form by Murray (1967):
63

Ew = 6.1078 exp
17.269t'
237.30+t'
EiCE = 6.1078 exp
21.8751'
265.50+t'
(5.25 a)
(5.26 a)
where E(v and E'iCE are the saturation water vapour pressures (in mb) over water 
and ice, and t' is the wet bulb temperature (°C). Equations (5.25), (5.25a) are valid 
for the temperature range —70 °C to + 50 °C. Equations (5.25) and (5.25 a) are ac­
curate to 0.1 mb between 0°C and 40 °C.
Improved formulae for the saturation water vapour pressures have been pub­
lished by Buck (1981). These formulae are more accurate than those by Murray 
[Eqs. (5.25 a) and (5.26a)], Magnus-Tetens [Eqs. (5.25) and (5.26)] and Goff- 
Gratch (on which the tables in Appendix B are based).

272.55+t'
(5.27)
(5.28)
where p is the ambient atmospheric pressure (in mb). The maximum errors of Eq. 
(5.27) occur at -20 °C and +50 °C and amount to 0.20%. The maximum errors 
of Eq. (5.28) do not exceed 0.02% at -50 °C and 0°C (Buck 1981).
Example: 
t = 21.3°C t' = 17.9°C p= 1010.6 mb
EW = 10[(7-5x17.9/(237.3 + 17.9))+0.7858] = 20.50 mb
e = 20.50—0.000662(1010.6)(21.3 —17.9)
= 20.50-2.28 = 18.22 mb .
[from Eq. (5.25)]
Effect of the Precision of t, t' on nM. If the refractive index nM of microwaves is 
computed from a value of the partial water vapour pressure obtained by 
psychrometer observations of t and t', it can be shown that an error of 0.22 °C 
in the dry bulb temperature t or an error of 0.14 °C in the wet bulb temperature 
t' causes an error of 1 ppm in nM. Psychrometer observations must therefore be 
carried out with the highest possible care. On long distances, the accuracy of a 
distance is limited mainly by the accuracy of the psychrometric data.
Effect of the Precision of t, t' on nL. In the same manner, it can be shown that 
an error of 1.0 °C in the dry bulb and an error of 12.5 °C in the wet bulb reading 
each cause an error of 1 ppm in the refractive index of light and NIR waves. The 
wet bulb reading is significantly less critical than in the case of nM.
64

5.8.5 Computation of Partial Water Vapour Pressure from Relative 
Humidity
The partial water vapour pressure e may also be derived from known values of 
relative humidity, h. Relative humidity can be measured with humidity probes and 
hygrometers or may be available from daily weather information. As will be 
shown below, partial water vapour pressures computed from relative humidity 
values may not be accurate enough for all EDM applications.
The partial water vapour pressure is computed from
Eh 
e — — , 
100
(5.29)
where e = partial water vapour pressure (mb)
E = saturation water vapour pressure (mb) at temperature t (dry bulb 
temperature)
h = relative humidity in percent.
The values for E may be taken from the table in Appendix B or computed from
Eqs. (5.25) to (5.28). Replace E' by E and t' by t.
Effect of the Precision of h (and t) on nL and nM. It can be shown that a preci­
sion of ±3% and ±0.2 °C of measured relative humidity h and measured temper­
ature, respectively, lead to the following precisions of the humidity term of the 
refractive index formulae at 50 and 100% relative humidity.

The above table indicates that humidity probes permit the measurement of 
humidity with sufficient accuracy for all but the most accurate distance measure­
ments with light and NIR waves. In the case of microwave distance measurements, 
the use of measured relative humidity causes a significant loss of accuracy in most 
cases. Psychrometer measurements are therefore the preferred humidity measure­
ment option for microwave distance measurement.
Computation of e from Weather Reports in Newspapers. Daily average values of 
the partial water vapour pressure can be recovered from weather reports of the 
past day in newspapers as long as the temperatures and humidities published refer 
to the same time and location.
65

For example, the following data were published by the Sydney Morning Herald 
on 30 March 1988 for the 29 March 1988 under the heading “Yesterdays 
Weather”: 9 am: 19.4 °C, 74% R.H.; 3 pm: 23.8 °C, 63% R.H.; 8 pm: 22.3 °C, 
61% R.H. Using Eq. (5.29), the following values of e are obtained: 9 am 16.7 mb, 
3 pm 18.6 mb, 8 pm 16.4 mb.
Such information may be used to correct electro-optical distance measure­
ments carried out on the specified day in the local area covered by the weather 
report in cases where no humidity was measured in the field and where complete 
omission of the humidity term in the refractive index equation is not acceptable.
Mean Values of Partial Water Vapour Pressure. In some cases it is warranted to 
use yearly mean values for the partial water vapour pressure. This applies to cases 
where the field measurement of humidity is not warranted but where the total 
omission of the humidity correction [see Eq. (5.16a) in Sect. 5.5.2] would cause 
unacceptable systematic errors. Annual mean values of partial water vapour 
pressure may be derived from data held by the local Bureau of Meteorology or 
from retrospective weather reports in newspapers (see above).
As a first example, the 10-year mean (1962—1971) of partial water vapour 
pressure at Richmond Aerodrome (near Sydney, Australia) at 15.00 hours 
Australian Eastern Standard Time may be mentioned. From 3358 days of mea­
surements, a mean value of 12.8 mb is obtained. The measured partial water 
vapour pressures vary betwen 3.3 and 31.0 mb and have a standard deviation of 
±5.8 mb about the above mean.
As a second example, some values given by Kneissl (1956) for Western Europe 
are quoted. Averaging over 30 meteorological stations, mean values of 6.1 and 
14.8 mb are given for January and July, respectively.
5.9 Determination of the Refractive Index
In principle, electronic distance measurements should be corrected for the integral 
refractive index over the entire wave path. (In later sections, the correction for the 
refractive index will be referred to as first and second velocity correction). This 
could involve the measurement of temperature, pressure and humidity along the 
wave path to calculate the refractive index and the subsequent integration of these 
refractive index values along the wave path. In practice, simplified methods based 
on endpoint measurements are usually adopted. These methods, their limitations 
and some alternative methods are discussed below.
5.9.1 Normal Procedures
The representative refractive index of a line is computed from meteorological 
observations taken at one or both terminals of the line. For lines in excess of a 
few kilometres and whenever high accuracy is required, t, p and t' or h are mea­
sured at both endpoints and the refractive indices are computed separately for 
both terminals. The mean refractive index is then used to correct the measured 
66

distance. This procedure provides the best refractive index corrections in cases 
where solely meteorological measurements at the endpoints are considered.
For distances of a few hundred metres to a few kilometres, t, p and, possibly, 
t' or h are measured at both terminals of the line. In this case, the above procedure 
may be simplified by taking the mean of the endpoint meteorological measure­
ments before calculating the refractive index once. Small errors are introduced in 
the process due to the non-linearity of the refractive index equations. These errors 
are sufficiently small to be ignored in most cases, as a numerical example may 
demonstrate: Considering an infrared distance meter and a height difference of 
1000 m with changes of 6.5 °C and 114.4 mb in t and p between the terminals, the 
simplified computation incurs an error of 0.2 ppm in comparison with the 
rigorous method above.
For short distances (such as in EDM tacheometry), t and p (and, rarely, t' or 
h) are only measured (or estimated) at the instrument station. The meteorological 
measurements taken at the instrument station are then used to calculate the 
refractive index. As a result of this, the temperature and pressure variations over 
the lines are ignored. Because of the change of pressure with height, systematic 
errors are incurred which amount to 1.6 ppm per 100 m height difference between 
instrument and reflector.
Numerical examples of such computations are given later in Chapter 6, on 
velocity corrections.
5.9.2 Limitations of Normal Procedures
Refractive indices evaluated from temperature, pressure and humidity readings 
taken at endpoints do represent the integral value over the wave path reasonably 
well as long as the EDM wave path is parallel to the ground. This case occurs most 
likely on close range. For lines of more than a few hundred metres length, the aver­
age ground clearance is likely to exceed the instrument and reflector heights sig­
nificantly. In these cases, the refractive indices computed from meteorological 
observations at the terminals will no longer closely approach the integral value 
over the wave path because the temperature and humidity measurements at the 
endpoints are strongly influenced by the closeness of the ground (ground proximi­
ty effects).
Figure 5.4 depicts some typical temperature variations with height on clear 
(sunny) days. It becomes evident that temperatures measured at instrument height 
(e.g. 1.5 m above ground) are not representative for temperatures at a height of, 
say, 100 m above ground. Temperatures measured during day light hours are too 
high and those measured at night too low when compared with temperatures at 
100 m.
To illustrate the ground proximity effects on endpoint measurements of at­
mospheric parameters (and EDM corrections derived from such) further, it is 
assumed that the temperature distributions of Fig. 5.4 apply and that distances 
with an average ground clearance of 100 m were measured at 04.00 h and at 
14.00 h. It can be shown that the first velocity corrections make the distances at 
04.00 h and 14.00 h 4 ppm too short and 2 ppm too long, respectively. It should

of the atmosphere on clear 
(sunny) summer days in 
Southeastern England. (After 
Jones 1971; Best et al. 1952)
be noted that these errors apply to clear nights and sunny days as defined above. 
The magnitude of these effects will be considerably reduced for similar lines on 
heavily overcast and windy days.
The ground proximity effects on endpoint measurements of temperature and 
humidity also explain why it is a common experience to find light wave in­
struments giving longer distances than microwave instruments during simulta­
neous measurements in day time. The difference amounts usually to 2-5 ppm. 
It could be easily explained by the ground level partial water vapour pressure ex­
ceeding the integral value by 0.7 mb. The diagrams of e versus height above 
ground given by Jones (1971) and Best et al. (1952) support such an assumption. 
Based on an analysis of a large sample of Austrian radio sonde and ground 
meteorological data, Brettenbauer (1975) concludes that temperatures and partial 
water vapour pressures measured at terminals of lines at 1500 m above sea level 
are typically too high by 3.0 °C and 1.3 mb, respectively. The temperature error 
leads to light wave and microwave distances being 3 ppm and 4.2 ppm too long, 
respectively. The humidity error leads to microwave distances being 6 ppm too 
short. In consequence, the light wave minus microwave difference becomes 
+4.8 ppm. A similar difference was reported for long distance measurements in 
Switzerland (Fischer 1971). The temperature and humidity structure in the lower 
atmosphere has been reviewed by Webb (1984).
It becomes evident from the above discussions that refractive indices (and first 
velocity corrections) computed from measurements of atmospheric parameters at 
the terminals of lines can severely bias the corrected distances. The ground prox­
imity effects are worst during clear sunny days (unstable stratification with tem­
perature decreasing with height and upward heat flux) and during clear nights 
(stable stratification, inversion layer, with temperature increasing with height and 
downward heat flux).
Reduced ground proximity effects are experienced during neutral stratification 
with no heat transfer between ground and air (zero heat flux) and zero tempera­
ture gradient. Neutral and near-neutral conditions are usually restricted to the 
transition periods between stable and unstable conditions, typcially 1.5 h after 
68

sunrise and 1.5 h before sunset or whenever the heat flux does not exceed 
10 W/m2 (Riieger 1984). Near-neutral conditions also prevail in heavily overcast 
weather with moderate to strong wind. Generally speaking, cloud cover over 
EDM lines and/or moderate to strong winds will reduce the ground proximity ef­
fects on meteorological endpoint measurements. With respect to microwave dis­
tance measurements, Brunner and Groenhout (1979) reported on experiments 
where measurements taken during periods of rainfall exhibited drastically reduced 
ground proximity effects.
As it is not practical to restrict EDM observations to heavily overcast condi­
tions with strong winds or to times around sunrise or sunset, methods have been 
developed which overcome some of the limitations of the endpoint measurements 
of atmospheric parameters. Some of these techniques are briefly discussed in the 
next section.
5.9.3 Special Procedures
The special procedures developed to overcome the limitations of the endpoint 
measurements of atmospheric parameters can involve instrumental solutions, 
modelling of the atmosphere (rectification models) and modified field and com­
puting procedures (operational models).
5.9.3.1 Atmospheric Measurements Along the Wave Path
With the aid of suitably equipped planes, motor gliders or helicopters, continuous 
recordings of temperature and humidity along the wave path can be obtained. 
Pressures need to be extrapolated from measurements at the terminals of the 
EDM lines. This technique is used by the U.S. Geological Survey on a routine 
basis for distance measurements carried out in connection with the monitoring 
of crustal movements in California. The accuracy of the Geodolite measurements, 
as corrected with the aid of airborne meteorological observations, is generally 
given as ±(3 mm+0.2 ppm) (Savage and Prescott 1973; Savage et al. 1979, 1987).
5.9.3.2 Multiple Wavelength EDM Instruments
Simultaneous distance measurements with two or three different carrier waves 
take advantage of the dispersion effect and permit the determination of the dif­
ferential refractive indices between the different carrier waves. This method leads 
to a greatly reduced dependency on accurate determinations of atmospheric pa­
rameters. In the case of “two-colour” instruments, the distance is derived as 
follows (Riieger 1980b):
D = dred-A(dblue-dred) , 
(5.30)
where dred = distance measurement with red laser (HeNe)
dbiUe = distance measurement with blue laser (HeCd)
A = coefficient, dependent on wavelength, pressure and water vapour 
pressure
= approximately 21 for red and blue light.
69

Being the largest residual effect of atmospheric conditions on distance, an er­
ror of 1 mb in water vapour pressure leads to 1 part in 107 error in distance. To 
obtain the water vapour pressure to 1 mb, one would need to know the relative 
humidity to 5%, which seems feasible.
Although the two-colour method eliminates a considerable part of the uncer­
tainty of the refractive index, the distance difference has to be measured with at 
least 20 times higher resolution than required in the final result due to the factor 
A in Eq. (5.30).
One two-colour instrument (Terrameter LDM-2) has been produced in small 
commercial quantities (Huggett 1981). The accuracy of the instrument is quoted 
by Langbein et al. (1987) as ±(0.3 mm+0.12 ppm) and by Gervaise (1984) as 
±0.08 ppm in a network with distances between 3.5 and 13.6 km. Other develop­
ment work on two-colour instruments were reported by Bradsell (1976); Querzola 
(1979); Kasser (1982); Levine (1984) and Meier and Loser (1988). Accuracies of 
0.15 ppm (and better) were obtained using the prototype of a “three-colour” 
[HeNe (red), HeCd (blue) and microwave! instrument (Huggett and Slater 1975).
5.9.3.3 Atmospheric Rectification Models
It has been mentioned in Section 5.9.2 that the measurements of atmospheric pa­
rameters at the endpoints of EDM lines do often not approximate the integral 
values of the wave path. Brunner (1984) notes that the use of the endpoint mea­
surements “limits the accuracy of EDM to about 2 to 4 ppm, even under 
favourable conditions”. The endpoint measurements of temperature, pressure and 
humidity are representative for the atmospheric surface layer close to the ground. 
To make these measurements representative for a wave path high above the 
ground, they need to be transformed to the boundary between the surface layer 
and the adjoining adiabatic (convection) layer.
Brunner (1984) summarizes the large number of atmospheric rectification 
models developed for EDM applications. Models for short range applications 
were developed by Angus-Leppan and Brunner (1980). They are restricted to lines 
of maximum lengths of 3 km and a ground clearance of 100 m and aim at an ac­
curacy of ±0.5 ppm for the reduced distances. Different equations are proposed 
for unstable (sunny days) and stable (nights) conditions. Three additional param­
eters must be evaluated in the field on the basis of diagrams. Another two must 
be measured or estimated: wind speed and the elevation angle of the sun. A rough 
profile of the line must also be known. The fictitious examples given by the two 
authors indicate clearly that the additional corrections on clear days are negative 
(e.g. -2 ppm) and on clear nights positive (e.g. +4 ppm). They confirm the 
evaluations in Section 5.9.2. A partial field test of the short range model was re­
ported by Rueger (1984).
For long range lightwave/infrared and microwave measurements, Brunner and 
Fraser (1978) developed the atmospheric Turbulent Tranfer Model (TTM). The 
method is restricted to periods of free convection during which a turbulent regime 
applies, namely to clear sunny days between about 10.00 and 15.00 h. The TTM 
requires the determination of some additional parameters, namely net radiation, 
heat flux into the ground, evaporation and wind speed. The former three can be 
70

estimated from empirical formulae. Successful applications of the TTM to 
microwave and light wave distance observations were reported by Brunner and 
Fraser (1977) and Fraser (1984).
5.9.3A Refractometers
Refractometers are devices which determine the ambient refractive index directly 
without the requirement for the measurement of atmospheric parameters. In most 
cases, refractometers are designed as dual-beam laser interferometers, with the 
first beam travelling in vacuum and the second beam in ambient air. During the 
evacuation of the chamber of the second beam, the change in the optical length 
can be measured by interferometric techniques. Wilkening (1986) claims uncer­
tainties of 0.2 ppm for such a device.
Refractometers cannot overcome the limitations of atmospheric measure­
ments at endpoints of EDM lines, as their measurements also reflect the condi­
tions of the atmospheric surface layer rather than integral values along the wave 
path. However, they are ideally suited for indoor precision EDM and in­
terferometry in general and for measurements in an industrial or laboratory envi­
ronment in particular, where temperature, pressure and humidity are usually 
uniform and the composition of the atmosphere is often non-standard. The 
refractive index equations given in Sections 5.4 and 5.5 are only valid for air of 
standard composition. For example, errors of 1.9 ppm were reported when using 
the standard refractive index formulae for the correction of distances measured 
in car manufacturing halls featuring a non-standard composition of air (Wilken­
ing 1986).
Historically it is of interest to note that the refractometer principle was used 
by the designers of the Mekometer ME 3000 for the direct application of the 
refractive index correction within the instrument (Froome 1971). Although the in­
ternal microwave refractometer (standard cavity) took care of most of the first 
velocity correction, additional corrections were required, for example to account 
for the conditions at the reflector stations (Meier and Riieger 1984).
5.9.3.5 Ratio Method
The length ratio method is an operational model (Brunner 1984) and makes use 
of the fact that all distance measurements made from one station to a number 
of reflector stations in a short time interval exhibit proportional atmospheric 
(refractive index) effects. The principles and applications of line ratios were first 
discussed by Baarda (1962, 1967); Allan (1967); Vincenty (1969) and Robertson 
(1971). Angus-Leppan (1979) gives a summary of early applications of the meth­
od. Originally, the ratio of line pairs was formed and introduced as observations 
into least-squares adjustments. It is, however, of advantage to employ the tech­
nique in the form of a “local scale parameter model” (Vincenty 1979), where all 
distances (or groups of distances) measured on a station are assigned a common 
but unknown scale parameter. When compared with the pure ratio method of line 
pairs, a much improved degree of freedom results for the network adjustment.
71

In principle, no measurements of atmospheric parameters are required when 
using this operational model, nor is there any need for the scale calibration of the 
distance meter. This greatly simplifies the field operations of EDM. The model 
has, however, two disadvantages. Firstly, most lines in a geodetic network have to 
be measured both ways in order to maintain a suitable degree of freedom of the 
adjustment (Brunner 1984). This increases the fieldwork considerably. Secondly, 
the absolute scale of the distances is lost as no first velocity corrections are ap­
plied. To permit network solutions, the scale must be defined by fixing the coor­
dinates of two stations, for example. The resulting coordinates of the unknown 
stations are biased by the selection of the fixed points. Depending on the func­
tions of the network, this may not be a serious disadvantage.
The ratio method works best for EDM lines of similar length and similar pro­
files. Slater (1979) quotes precisions of ±0.2 ppm and ±0.5 ppm of length ratios 
of lines of similar and dissimilar profiles, respectively. Typically, precisions of 
±0.5 ppm are reported for lines of a few kilometres length (Riieger 1984). On 
shorter lines, the effects of the (phase) resolution of the distance meter may limit 
the gains of the ratio method to a certain extent. Because of the pressure (and 
temperature) gradient with height, the measured distances will exhibit different 
scales whenever the reflector stations contributing to a unknown scale parameter 
are not at the same height above sea level (Jager 1985). In addition to this correc­
tion for the height difference, distances must be reduced to a common horizon, 
if a two-dimensional network adjustment program is used. Successful applica­
tions of the method in engineering networks were reported by Jager (1985) and 
Grundig and Teskey (1984). An improvement of about 30% and 70% in the ac­
curacy of point positions and in the external reliability, respectively, was achieved 
in comparison with the use of distances reduced by standard methods.
The local scale parameter model is extremely powerful in terms of achievable 
accuracies and is extremely user-friendly as far as the meteorological field opera­
tions are concerned. It is very likely the cheapest and easiest special procedure 
which may be used to overcome the limitations of endpoint measurements of at­
mospheric parameters. This operational model is particularly suited for applica­
tions where a network has to be measured repeatedly, such as in monitoring net­
works. The loss of the absolute scale is not critical in these cases.
72

6 Velocity Corrections to Measured Distances
The basic formula for the computation of d was introduced in Sections 2.1 and 
3.1.1. Equation (3.1) may be written, after substitution of Eq. (2.4) for c, to 
describe the distance value d' actually displayed on a distance meter.
c0 At'
nREF 2
(6.1)
where d' = the distance displayed on the EDM instrument, 
c0 = the velocity of light in a vacuum,
At' = the measured “flight” time of the signal to the reflector and back, 
Href = the reference refractive index of the instrument.
6.1 Reference Refractive Index
The reference refractive index is instrument-specific. It defines that refractive in­
dex for which the distance meter provides directly a correct readout. No refractive 
index (or first velocity) corrections are therefore required whenever the integral 
refractive index along the wave path equals the reference refractive index.
The instrument constant nREF is defined by the following equations:
__ co
nREF“------------ -----------
^MOD^MOD
_ Co
2UfMOD
(6.2)
(6.3)
where XMOd = the constant modulation wavelength of the fine measurement for 
which the instrument is designed,
fMOD = the constant modulation frequency of the fine measurement, 
U = the exact half of %MOD, called the unit length of the instrument.
It may be seen from Appendix E that 10 m is presently the most common unit 
length.
The reference refractive index nREF of an instrument is fixed by the manufac­
turer by adopting a suitable unit length and by adjusting the main oscillator to 
such a modulation frequency fMOD that the then fixed value nREF corresponds 
more or less to an average refractive index encountered under field conditions. 
Reference refractive indices for some electro-optical EDM instruments are given 
in Appendix D.
73

If such details as XMOd and fMOD are not available for a specific instrument, 
a reference pressure Pref and a reference temperature tREF may be available in­
stead. Substitution of the reference meteorological conditions into Eqs. (5.15) or 
(5.17) provides the reference refractive index in these cases.
Example: For the Kern DM501, the manufacturer specifies meteorological 
reference data of +12 °C and 1013 mb as well as a carrier wavelength 
of 900 nm.
Application of Eq. (5.13) leads to a group refractive index ng of 1.00029374. 
The reference refractive index follows then from the substitution of ng as well as 
t = 12 °C and p = 1013 mb into Eq. (5.15) and assuming a partial water vapour 
pressure of e = 0.0 mb:
Urj?f =: 1.00028238 .
Use of the above Eq. (6.3) in connection with
c0 = 299792458 m/s
fmod =: 14985400 Hz
U = 10 m exactly
provides the following value for the reference refractive index:
Urff = 1.00028180 .
The differences between the two values are insignificant and due to round off er­
rors in the specified reference atmospheric parameters.
6.2 First Velocity Correction
The length of the wave path d is
n 2
(6.4)
where n is the actual refractive index which ideally is the mean value over the dis­
tance.
In order to obtain the (true) wave path length d from the read-out distance 
d', the term c0At'/2 = n^d' can be derived from Eq. (6.1) and substituted in 
Eq. (6.4). This provides the following rigorous correction equation:
d=(W\d'. 
(6.5)
\ n /
However, it is usually preferred to work with a differential equation. The first 
velocity correction K' is now derived by subtracting d' [Eq. (6.1)] from d [Eq. 
(6.4)]:

(6.6)
and, after substitution of Eq. (6.1):
K' =
nREF~n 
n
(6.7)
d' .
The above equation is rigorous. For simplicity, the denominator in Eq. (6.6) is 
usually set equal to 1. It can be shown that this simplification does not introduce 
errors in excess of 0.02 ppm. The first velocity correction K' thus may be written 
with sufficient accuracy as
K' = d'(nREF-n) 
(6.8)
and the corrected distance d as
d = d'+d'(nREF-n) 
(6.9)
= d'+K' . 
(6.10)

generally given in a form like

1013.25 1013.25 s
(6.13)
where the reference refractivity and the group refractivity are denoted by Nref 
and Ng, respectively. A list of C and D values is given in Appendix D for a num­
ber of instruments. Eqs. (6.11) and (6.13) are based on Eqs. (5.14) and (5.15). The 
overall accuracy of these equations has been discussed in Section 5.5 and is unlike­
ly to be better than 0.5 ppm. This is, however, entirely sufficient for most EDM 
applications.
For high precision EDM at all visible and infrared carrier wavelengths and 
whenever the systematic errors mentioned above are not tolerable, it is strongly 
recommended to use the formulae listed in Appendix A together with the rigorous 
Eqs. (6.5) or (6.7) with (6.10).

Meter Pentax PM-81
The Pentax PM-81 features an on-board compensation facility for the first veloci­
ty correction based on refractivity rather than on temperature and pressure or 
ppm correction input. The equations supplied by the manufacturer can be con­
verted to the form given in Eq. (6.11) for post-processing as shown below.

The following correction input is stated by the manufacturer:
(PPM) = 2^P0xunHgL

Expansion with —-— and conversion to mb leads to:

[273.15+t(°C)]
The PM-81 incorporates a default value for the refractivity of (PPM) = 278, cor­
responding to 15 °C, 760 mm Hg. Therefore, to apply the first velocity correction 
by computation:
1. Set (PPM) in instrument always to 278 (default value)

The Distomat Wild DI 3000 is a pulse distance meter. Equations (6.2) and (6.3) 
for the computation of the reference refractive index therefore do not apply. As 
the operators’ manual does not state reference atmospheric parameters, the first 
velocity correction for post-processing in the form of Eq. (6.11) can be easily 
derived from the correction equation given by the manufacturer:

This equation may be used for post-processing if the ppm correction is set to

Distance Meter Siemens-Albis SIAL MD60

c0 = 299792500 m/s 
fMOD = 149848300 Hz 
%mod = 2 m exactly 
U = 1 m exactly .
The modulation frequency fMOD, the modulation wavelength XMOD and the unit 
length U refer to the fine measurement of the distance. Using Eq. (6.2) the 
reference refractive index of the SIAL MD60 may be computed as follows:

the displayed readout would be the correct distance.
The first velocity correction K' is obtained according to Eq. (6.8) as:
K' — (Uref ~ n) d'

6.3 Real-Time Application of First Velocity Correction 
by EDM Instrument
Most short-range distance meters permit the application of the first velocity cor­
rection in real-time in one form or another. Originally, this required the input of 
a ppm (or environmental) correction value. More recently, keyboard entry of tem­
perature, pressure (and humidity) became available. The key-board entry of 
refractivity (see Sect. 6.2.2, for example) is unlikely to gain wide acceptance. Two 
precision distance meters apply the first velocity correction based on internal 
measurements without external input. The Kern Mekometer ME 3000 employs, in 
principle, a microwave refractometer. Some models of the Com-Rad Geomensor 
204DME feature built-in temperature and pressure sensors and apply the first 
velocity correction by computation. It should be noted that the real-time applica­
tion of the first velocity is really only practicable as long as the measurements of 
the atmospheric parameters are carried out at the instrument station only and the 
errors incurred in the process (see Sects. 5.8 and 5.9.1) are tolerable.
For instruments with ppm input, manufacturers provide either correction 
charts or slide rules for the evaluation of the appropriate setting of the ppm (or 
environmental) correction dial (or switches, key-board entry). The ppm correction 
charts are entered with temperature and pressure or with temperature and eleva­
tion above sea-level. (Humidity is generally ignored, see Sect. 5.5.2 for an estimate 
of the errors incurred.) In the latter case, the conversion from sea level elevation 
to pressure is based on a standard atmosphere such as the one described in Ap-
79

pendix C. Differences between ambient and standard pressures lead to errors in 
the first velocity correction, and thus in the distances displayed by the instrument 
at the rate of 0.28ppm/mb [refer to Eq. (5.16)].
The errors incurred by the use of standard pressures may be assessed with the 
aid of the following table of pressure variations (Anthes et al. 1975):
1084 mb
Highest recorded sea level pressure
1050 mb
Very strong anticyclone
1033 mb
Moderate anticyclone
1013.25 mb
Mean sea level pressure
996 mb
Moderate cyclone
976 mb
Very strong cyclone
908 mb
Hurricane Camille (1969)
877 mb
Lowest recorded sea level pressure
The highest and lowest sea level pressures recorded in Sydney (Australia) are 
1039.7 mb and 982.2 mb, respectively. Based on the above information, the likely 
maximum difference between ambient and standard pressures under surveying 
weather conditions may be estimated as about 20 mb. This is equivalent to a maxi­
mum error of 6 ppm in the first velocity correction. In cases where such 
systematic errors cannot be tolerated, the first velocity correction should be com­
puted from measured atmospheric pressure.
The direct input of measured temperatures, pressures (and, possibly, humidi­
ty) is likely to replace the traditional ppm input. This procedure is likely to be 
more accurate, as no diagrams or nomograms need to be entered and read. Most 
instruments ignore the effect of humidity and do not offer the entry of elevations 
instead of pressure.
Users should be aware of the first velocity equations employed by the instru­
ment manufacturer before using ppm inputs or temperature and pressure inputs. 
Instrument users should always have the option of by-passing the real-time first 
velocity correction by either entering zero ppm or the reference temperature and 
reference pressure.
6.4 Second Velocity Correction
As mentioned earlier, pressure and psychrometer observations are taken normally 
only at instrument and reflector stations or, for microwave instruments, at the 
master and remote stations. The first velocity corrections are computed for both 
terminals of a line. The mean of both values is subsequently used to correct the 
distance. However, an error is introduced if the mean first velocity correction of 
both stations is used without a further small correction, called the second velocity 
correction.
In Fig. 6.1, the mean refractive index n = y(nt +n2) would be correct for the 
upper curve with a radius R but not for the actual wave path below it having 
radius r, assuming a spherically layered atmosphere on a sphere. For the actual 
wave path, the correct refractive index would be, assuming linear vertical gradients 
of temperature and pressure (Hopcke 1964; Saastamoinen 1964):

Fig. 6.1. EDM wave paths in a spherically layered atmosphere. The upper curve indicates a wave 
path featuring a coefficient of refraction of k = 1.0 and a radius equivalent to the earth’s radius 
R. The lower curve depicts a wave path with a coefficient of refraction of less than 1.0 (but 
larger than 0.0) and, thus, a radius of curvature r larger than R. The midpoint of the upper curve 
is at the mean height (Hi +H2>/2 of the terminals Pt and P2 of the line

where K" = second velocity correction

d' = measured distance, displayed on instrument 
R = mean radius of curvature of the spheroid along the line.
The second velocity correction K" is more important for microwaves than for light 
waves and more important on long distances than on short distances. For exam­
ple, K" would become -50 mm for a distance d' of 50 km, measured by a 
microwave instrument (kM = 0.25).
The wave path length dt is obtained as
dt = d'+K'+K" , 
(6.28)
where d' = measured distance, displayed on instrument
K' = first velocity correction (according to Sect. 6.1.2) 
K" = second velocity correction.

6.5 Refined Method of Reduction of Measured Distance to Wave Path 
Chord
Using basic theorems of geometrical optics a formula can be developed which 
gives the direct relation between the measured optical path and the straight line 
between two stations. This formula replaces not only the first and second velocity 
correction, but also the first arc-to-chord correction, which is discussed later in 
Chapter 7. A few basic theorems are listed here. A comprehensive treatise of the 
principles of optics and electromagnetic waves is given by Born and Wolf (1970). 
The development of appropriate EDM reduction formulae has been demonstrat­
ed by Brunner and Fraser (1978) and Brunner and Angus-Leppan (1976).
The principle of Fermat (Principle of shortest optical path or principle of least 
time) states that the optical length o of an actual ray between any two points, Pt 
and P2, is shorter than the optical length of any other curve through the same 
two points. In mathematical form:

o = f do = f nds = c f dt , 
(6.29)

where ds is an incremental chord element: ds2 = dx2+dy2+dz2. Since EDM is 
based on the measurement of time, the optical length o can be derived from the 
direct readout distance d' as follows (Fraser 1984):

The first order partial differential equation of the optical length o is also known 
as the eikonal equation and describes the effect of vertical and horizontal refrac­
tion for EDM. The solution of the eikonal equation corresponds to the conformal 
projection of the geodesic and was developed by Moritz (1967). In the form of 
Brunner and Angus-Leppan (1976), the correction of the optical length to the 
wave path chord becomes:

where o is the optical length (o = d'nREF), s is the wave path chord, N is the 
refractivity [N = (n-l)xlO6] and is an integration variable along x.
The origin of the Cartesian coordinate system x,y,z is defined at one endpoint 
of the line. The x-axis is colinear with the chord. The z-axis is perpendicular to 
the x-axis and on a vertical plane through the origin. The y-axis is in a horizontal 
plane through the origin. All integrations are carried out along the x-axis. Equa­
82

tion (6.32) is mathematically accurate to 2x10“11 s assuming that the laws of 
geometrical optics are valid for describing the wave propagation. However, the 
practical accuracy of As will largely depend on the accuracy of the refractivity N 
and its gradients. The gradients can be derived from a combination of measure­
ments of atmospheric parameters (see Sect. 5.8) and atmospheric models. Dif­
ferent atmospheric models apply depending on the specific conditions of the at­
mosphere.
Refined methods of reducing an optical length (or measured distance) o to its 
chord length s will not be considered further in this text, because their application 
requires both field observations of additional atmospheric parameters as well as 
more extensive computations. Some atmospheric rectification models have been 
discussed in Section 5.9.3, together with alternative methods. For high precision 
and long range EDM, the application of refined methods should be considered.
With respect to the following, the correction As = s - o will be approximated 
in the traditional way by the sum of the first and the second velocity correction 
and the first arc-to-chord correction.
83

7 Geometrical Corrections
In principle, the wave path dt is obtained after applying the two velocity correc­
tions to an actual observation of the length. Unless the length is subsequently pro­
cessed in a three-dimensional network adjustment, it has to be reduced to the 
equivalent spheroidal distance on a geodetic reference surface, for example the 
Australian Geodetic Datum. Selected methods of reduction to the spheroid will 
now be reviewed, prior to a discussion of additional corrections and computa­
tions.
There are basically two different methods of reduction. The first method uses 
known or measured heights, the second measured zenith angles. The first method 
is employed in conjunction with medium to long range distance measurements. 
The second method is used for short ranges where the heights of target stations 
are usually not available.
In connection with three-dimensional networks, the wave path dj only needs 
to be reduced to the wave path chord d2 with the aid of the first arc-to-chord 
correction discussed below. This provides the space distance between the two ter­
minals of the line.
It should be noted that some additional corrections may be necessary after the 
application of the velocity corrections before the correct wave path length is ob­
tained. Such additional corrections may be necessary for telescope- and 
theodolite-mounted EDM instruments and when measured zenith angles are used 
in the reduction process. These corrections are discussed later in detail in Sections 
8.1 and 8.2.
7.1 Reduction to the Spheroid Using Station Heights
The reduction problem is illustrated in Fig. 7.1; dt stands for the wave path 
length, d2 for the wave path chord, d3 for the spheroidal chord and d4 for the 
spheroidal distance. The spheroidal distance corresponds to the length of a nor­
mal section and differs only slightly from the length of the geodesic. The dif­
ference is less than 20 mm for a distance of 3000 km and may therefore be ignored 
(Bomford 1975). The radius of curvature of the wave path is denoted by r and 
the mean radius of curvature of the spheroid along the line by R. Ht and H2 are 
the spheroidal heights of stations Pt and P2, measured along the normal to the 
spheroid. The spheroidal height is the sum of the orthometric (geoidal) height and 
the corresponding height of the geoid above the spheroid (geoid-spheroid separa­
tion). y is the angle between the normals to a sphere of radius R through Pt and 
P2, and p is the angle between the tangents to the wave path through Pt and P2 
and also the angle between the wave path normals through Pi and P2.
84

Fig. 7.1. Reduction of the wave path length dx to the spheroidal arc length with the aid of 
the elevations and of the terminals Pi and P2. The wave path chord and the spheroidal 
chord lengths are denoted by d2 and d3, respectively. The angle y is subtended by the normals 
to the spheroid of radius R and through the terminals of the line. Similarly, the angle fl is 
subtended by the normals to the wave path with radius r
85

The value R is computed from
R = ;ve .2
v cos a+ q sm a 
(7.1)
where v = radius of curvature of the spheroid in the prime vertical 
q = radius of curvature of the spheroid in the meridian 
a = azimuth of the measured line, clockwise through 360 ° from the 
north.
The two radii of curvature follow from (e.g. Cooper 1987):
g. a(1~e2> 
(7.2)
° (I-e2sin2 <p)3/2 
' ’
(l-e2sin2<p)1/2 ’
where (p is the latitude and where the eccentricity e and the flattening f of the 
spheroid are given by
e2 = (a2-b2)/a2 
(7.4)
f =(a-b)/a . 
(7.5)
The semi-major and semi-minor axes of the spheroid are denoted by a and b, 
respectively. National (and international) reference spheroids are usually defined 
by a and e. For example, the Australian National Spheroid is defined by 
a = 6378160 m and f = 1/298.25 exactly and the ellipsoid of the World Geodetic 
System WGS84 is based on a = 6378137 m and f = 1/298.257223563.
The spheroid between the terminals of a line is always replaced by a sphere 
of radius R for the reduction of distances. This leads to an intersection of the 
spheroidal normals which were originally skew. Sometimes, a mean radius RM is 
adopted for a certain area to avoid repeated computations of R. The Integrated 
Survey Grid in the State of New South Wales (Australia) refers for example to a 
mean radius of RM = 6370100 m causing errors of less than 1 ppm in reduced 
distances for N.S.W. latitudes.
The average radius of curvature RM at a point on the spheroid can be express­
ed by
Rm = (vp)1/2- 
.6)
Spheroidal heights are often replaced by orthometric (geoidal) heights because the 
former are not readily available. Orthometric heights, for example heights based 
on the Australian Height Datum (A.H.D.), may be obtained from spirit and 
trigonometric levelling. The use of orthometric instead of spheroidal heights for 
the reduction of distances may lead to errors in the spheroidal distance depending 
on the height of the geoid above the spheroid at the two terminals of a line 
(Vincenty 1975). Two cases may be distinguished:
1. Equal heights of geoid above spheroid at the terminals of a line introduce er­
rors of 1 ppm per 6 m geoid-spheroid separation.
86

2. Unequal heights of geoid above spheroid at the terminals produce an addi­
tional error which may be estimated using the second term of Eq. (7.40) in 
Section 7.1.3. For extreme cases in alpine areas, errors of up to 0.15 m for 
2.5 km lines have been reported (Elmiger 1977).
Spheroidal heights should be used in high order geodetic surveys. However, the 
difference between spheroidal and orthometric heights is often ignored in low 
order and short range surveys. The effects of this omission are not always negligi­
ble. With the introduction of surveying techniques based on satellite positioning 
systems such as the Global Positioning System (GPS), the determination of the 
geoid-spheroid separation has found renewed interest and may lead, eventually, 
to more accurate and more readily available local geoid maps.
Two calculation methods are now presented. The first executes the reduction 
in several steps. The second gives a closed solution.

Hi,H2 = spheroidal heights
R 
= radius of curvature of the spheroid along the line [see Eq. (7.1)].
Equation (7.16) is a rigorous formula for a spherical reference surface of radius 
R. The spheroidal heights Ht and H2 refer, in the case of electro-optical EDM, 
to the trunnion axes of EDM instrument and reflector, respectively. For an EDM 
instrument mounted on the telescope of a theodolite, Hi refers to the trunnion 
axis height of the theodolite.
The chord-to-chord correction is sometimes split into two separate correc­
tions, namely
88

Both corrections may be derived from the rigorous Eq. (7.16), which may be writ­
ten as follows:

The magnitude of the terms in the second bracket may be estimated by 
substituting maximum values (applicable in Australia) for = H2 = HM =

Hm = 4x10~4 , 5i^ = 8xl0“8, ^5 = 2.4x10-7..........

Also, all terms with R2, R3 etc. in the denominator may be safely disregarded. 
The maximum error resulting from this omission of terms will not exceed 0.2 ppm 
for heights below 2500 m.
Equation (7.20) may therefore be written in a reduced form 
(\ 2-11/2

(7.21)
Multiplication of the first two factors in Eq. (7.21) leads to a “horizontal” dis­
tance d6 computed in a right-angled triangle. The correction which has to be ap­
plied to the “slope” distance to obtain the “horizontal” distance d6 is traditional­
ly called the slope correction. Considering the first two factors of Eq. (7.21) and
Eq. (7.18) the slope correction K2 (d2 to d6) may now be defined as
K2 = d2

(7.23)
(7.24)
Considering Eqs. (7.18), (7.21) and (7.22), the so-called sea level correction K3 
(d6 to d3) yields:
K3 =

Substitution of K2 in Eq. (7.26) by Eq. (7.24) leads to a third equation for K3:
K3 = -5m d2 + Hm AH2 + Hm+ Hm AH6 +.... 
(7.28)
R 2d2R 8d2R 16d^R
The first term is the conventional value for the sea level correction which is not 
only used in EDM but also in reductions of horizontal distances to sea level and 
vice versa. The first term of Eq. (7.28) is not always sufficient for reducing EDM 
slope distances accurately to the spheroid because the slope correction K2 does 
not lead to the chord at mean height HM, which would be the true horizontal 
distance. The terms of higher order in Eq. (7.28) may be estimated by inserting 
extreme values of AH = 1 km, d2 = 1.5 km and HM =1.5 km. The second term 
then becomes 78 mm, the third 9 mm and the fourth 2 mm. The use of the first 
term of Eq. (7.28) alone is therefore insufficient. It is advisable to use the rigorous 
formulae (7.25) or (7.26) for the sea level correction, in conjunction with slope 
corrections according to Eqs. (7.22) and (7.23).

The reduction of the wave path length dt to the spheroidal distance d4 can be 
done in one step, if several formulae of Section 7.1.1 are combined. Considering 
the equation

which is mounted on the telescope of a theodolite, the height refers to the trun­
nion axis height of the theodolite.

Note on the Use of Pocket Calculators and Computers. Before Eq. (7.37) is used 
in conjunction with pocket calculators the accuracy of the pocket calculator’s 
trigonometric functions for small angles must be known. If the number of ac­
curate significant digits is smaller than the number required, both trigonometric 
functions in Eq. (7.37) should be replaced by series expansions. When program­
ming Eq. (7.37) on personal and other computers, it is essential to declare all pa­
rameters involved as double precision variables, as squares of large numbers are 
involved.
7.1.3 Analysis of Errors
To test the effect of the parameters in Eq. (7.37) on the spheroidal distance d4, 
the propagation of real errors is assessed on the basis of Eqs. (7.11), (7.16) and 
(7.32).
Defining
AH = H1-H1 
(7.38)
HM = f(H1+H2) , 
(7.39)
and assuming
(R+H1)(R+H2) = (R+Hm)2
R2/(R+Hm)2= 1.0 ,
the following total differential may be derived:
d7 AH 
d 
d
8(d4) = 
8(dj)-------8(AH)-------------8(R+HM)+- 8(R) 
where d may be taken as d4 and where the partial derivatives of the variables d4, 
d1? AH, (R+Hm), R and k are denoted by 6. It should be noted that any error 
8(R) will create an error 8(HM) of equal magnitude but opposite sign and that 
the error 8(R+HM) becomes zero.
If an error 8d4 in d4 should not exceed a certain limit, the maximum 
allowable errors in each of dt, AH, (R+HM), R and k can be calculated from the 
total differential above.
7.1.3.1 Example of a Long Line
Given are the following approximate quantities:
dt = 20 km, AH = 1000m, HM = 500m,
R = 6370 km and k = 0.13 .
How accurately must the spheroidal height difference AH, the mean spheroidal 
height Hm, the radius of curvature of the spheroid R and the coefficient of 
92

refraction k be known so that the effect of each parameter on the spheroidal dis­
tance d4 does not exceed 5 mm?
With 8 (d4) = 5 mm, the individual errors can be solved for as
8 (AH) = (d/AH)8(d4) = 100 mm
8(R+Hm) = (l/d)(R+HM)8(d4) = 1.6 m
8(R) = (R/d)8(d4) = 1.6 m
8(k) = (12R2/kd3)8(d4) = 2.3 .
It becomes evident that the height difference must be known with much higher 
accuracy (0.1 m) than the spheroidal mean height of the line (1.6 m). It should be 
noted that the former value must also include the uncertainty of the change of 
the geoid-spheroid separation between the endpoints of the line and that the latter 
must include the uncertainty of the mean geoid-spheroid separation of the line 
(refer to Sect. 7.1). No state-wide mean radius of the spheroid can be adopted if 
the above accuracy has to be achieved. Equations (7.2), (7.3) and (7.6) should be 
used instead. The coefficient of refraction is not critical.
7.13.2 Example of a Short and Steep Line
Considering high precision EDM on close range, such as for the purpose of the 
monitoring of structures, the following parameters are assumed:
dt = 140m , AH = 100m .
How accurately must AH be known, if the effects of its uncertainty on the re­
duced distance should not exceed 0.1 mm?
Solving for 8 (AH) in the second term of Eq. (7.40) and omission of the 
negative sign leads to
8 (AH) = (d/AH)8(d4)
= (140/100)0.1 mm
= 0.14 mm .
It follows that the use of given height differences for the reduction of relatively 
short distances may cause considerable errors in the reduced distances, if the 
height differences are not known with the necessary precision. In this case, the 
height difference would have to be established by precise geodetic levelling or, 
possibly, by simultaneous reciprocal trigonometric heighting. The measurements 
of the heights of instrument and reflector would also need to be accurate to 
0.1 mm.
7.2 Reduction to the Spheroid, Using Measured Zenith Angles
7.2.7 Introduction
The problem is depicted in Fig. 7.2, where

Figure 7.2 clearly assumes that the two zenith angle measurements as well as the 
distance measurement were collinear, and that the trunnion axis heights (above 
ground marks) of theodolites, EDM instruments, reflectors, traversing targets, 
94

were thus the same on any one station. The spheroidal heights at the endpoints 
refer to these common trunnion axis heights of all equipment used. Additional 
corrections to measured zenith angles and/or distances may apply, if the condi­
tions are not fulfilled (see Sect. 8.2).
A rigorous reduction of the wave path length dt to the spheroidal distance d4 
is only possible if the spheroidal heights and the deviations of the vertical e are 
available. For practical purposes, the spheroidal zenith angles £ are usually replac­
ed by the measured zenith angles z, the spheroidal heights by the orthometric 
(geoidal) heights and R by the mean radius of spheroid for a specific area RM. 
For example, R is usually replaced by RM = 6370100 m for computations in the 
Integrated Survey Grid of the State of New South Wales (Australia).
The impact of such approximations is described in Section 7.1 and in Vincenty 
(1975). The height difference AH may be computed from either spheroidal £ or 
measured zenith angles z. In the former case, spheroidal height differences are ob­
tained, in the latter case, orthometric height differences.
The relationship between the spheroidal zenith angle £ and the measured 
zenith angle z is given by
= Z + £ .
(7.41)
Again, two different calculation methods are presented.
7.2.2 Reduction to the Spheroid: Closed Solution
Following a solution given by Dabrowski and Maier (1977) and referring to Fig. 
7.2, the distances QPt and QP2 may be computed in the right-angled triangle 
PiP2Q as
Q Pt = d2 cos (zt + £! + §) 
(7.42)
QP2 = d2sin(z1 + £1 + 8) . 
(7.43)
Considering the right-angled triangle QCP2 the angle y may be derived as 
follows
d2 sin (zj + £t + 8)
y = arc tan LR+Ht+d2 cos (zt + Ei + S)
The spheroidal distance d4 may now easily be computed as
(7.44)
d4 = R arc tan
d2 sin (zt + £t + 8)
R+Ht + d2 cos (zt + £t + 8)
(7.45)
The computation of the refraction angle 8 follows from Fig. 7.2:
8 = - = — = ^ . 
(7.46)
2 2r 2R
The wave path chord d2 is computed from Eq. (7.7) of Section 7.1.1.1 and Eq. 
(5.19) of Section 5.9:

A 2R « 
d = ---- Sm
k
(7.47)
Equations (7.45), (7.46) and (7.47) permit a rigorous computation of the 
spheroidal distance d4. For k = 0.13 and R = 6370 km, the difference between d2 
and dt (the first arc-to-chord correction according to Sect. 7.1.1.1) amounts to 
only 0.02 mm for d = 10 km, and 0.47 mm for d = 30 km. The wave path chord 
d2 may therefore be safely replaced by the wave path length dj in all practical 
cases. Equation (7.45) may subsequently be written as
d4 — R arc tan
dt sin (zt + +dj k/2R) 
R+Hi+dt cos(z1 + 81+d1k/2R) ’
(7.48)
where d4 = spheroidal distance
dt = wave path length
H! = spheroidal height of station Pt
zt = measured zenith angle at Pt (in radian) 
k = coefficient of refraction of light (=0.13) 
R = radius of curvature of the spheroid along the line Pt P2 
St = deviation of vertical at Pt in azimuth of PtP2, derived from addi­
tional observations (e.g. astronomical observations) (in radian).
The deviation of the vertical is usually unknown, which means that 8 is very often 
ignored in computing the spheroidal distance d4. The effect of 8 on d4 can be 
derived by taking the total differential of Eq. (7.48). Replacing spheroidal heights 
by orthometric heights (geoidal heights) leads to additional errors which have al­
ready been discussed in Section 7.1.
Note on the Use of Pocket Calculators and Computers. The use of arc tan in Eqs. 
(7.45) and (7.48) may be critical because the term in brackets is always very small. 
The accuracy limitations of a particular calculator should be checked for small 
arguments of this trigonometric function. If necessary, arc tan may be replaced 
by its series expansion. Pocket calculators should be switched to radian entry of 
arguments of trigonometric functions before using Eqs. (7.45) and (7.48). When 
programming personal or other computers for the computation of Eqs. (7.45) and 
(7.48), all parameters involved should be defined as double precision variables.
7.2.3 Reduction to the Spheroid: Step-by-Step Solution
Apart from the one-step solution of the problem, given in Section 7.2.2, the 
reduction of distances can also be evaluated by a similar method as shown previ­
ously in Section 7.1.1.
7.23.1 First Arc-to-Chord Correction Kx (dx to d2)
This correction has already been discussed in Section 7.1.1. The wave path chord 
d2 has been obtained as follows
96

'y d?
d2 = dt+Kt , where Kt = -k2----- - . 
(7.10)
24 R2
The size of Kj may be evaluated for R = 6370 km and a coefficient of refraction 
kL = 0.13 (light waves). Kt then amounts to -0.02 mm for d = 10000 m and to 
-0.47 mm for d = 30000 m.
The first arc-to-chord correction may therefore be ignored in almost all cases.
7.2.3.2 Slope Correction K5 (d2 to d5)
The slope correction reduces the wave path chord d2 to the horizontal distance 
d5 at the height H1( All necessary parameters are depicted in Fig. 7.3. Applying 
the sine rule to triangle PtP2P2 yields

Y d2 sin z 
2~2(R+Ht) *
(7.50)
Using the series expansion of cosine and Eq. (7.50), it can be shown that the 
denominator in Eq. (7.49) may be safely taken as unity for all practical cases. The 
approximation causes an error of 1 part in 108 over 2 km of horizontal distance 
of 3 parts in 107 over 10 km.
Rearrangement of the numerator in Eq. (7.49) leads to
d5 = d2 sin zt cos
Y- (2 - k) - d2 cos zt sin

Because - is small, the term

will also be small.
Substituting cos

2
considering Eq. (7.50) yields

d2(2-k) .

(7.52)
Finally, using a theorem of trigonometric functions and neglecting Hi leads 
to 
2
d5 = d2 sin zt - 
—— sin 2zt , 
(7.53)
4R
where d5 = horizontal distance at height
d2 = wave path chord
zt = zenith angle in Pt
R = mean radius of curvature of spheroid along the line 
Hi = height of station Pt.
The effect on d5 of neglecting Ht can be evaluated by multiplying the figures in 
the table below by the factor Ht/R. The maximum error owing to the omission 
of Ht in d5 is smaller than 0.4 mm, if the slope distances d2 are smaller than 
5000 m and the zenith angles between 70° and 110°.
Note: To reduce distances correctly to the spheroid, spheroidal zenith angles 
and spheroidal heights need to be used (see Sect. 7.2).
The magnitude of the second term in Eq. (7.53) is demonstrated with the aid 
of a table. It is seen that the term should usually be taken into account.

For zenith angles of 90°, the second term is zero. The above table assumes 
= 0 and k = 0.13 (light waves).
7.23.3 Sea Level Correction K6 (d5 to d3)
The sea level correction K6 will be slightly different from the solution in Section 
7.1.1.2 because d5 is defined at the station height of Pj and not at the mean 
height Hm as before.
K6=-^d5 
(7.54)

d3 = d5+K6. 
(7.55)
Equations (7.54) and (7.55) are rigorous and can be easily derived from the 
triangle Pj P2C of Fig. 7.3:

(7.56)

7.23.4 Second Chord-to-Arc Correction K4 (d3 to d4)
This correction has already been discussed in Section 7.1.1.3. It can be shown, by 
using Eq. (7.32) and assuming R = 6370.1 km and k = 0.13, that the omission of 
this correction causes errors of only 0.1 mm and 1.0 mm on lines of 5 km and 
10 km length. K4 may therefore be ignored in almost all cases.
7.2.4 Analysis of Errors
The effects of errors in the parameters of Eq. (7.45) may be analyzed by the total 
differential of Eqs. (7.45) and (7.48). After some substitutions and with a radius 
R = 6370000 m the total differential of Eq. (7.45) yields (Dabrowski and Maier 
1977):
S(d4) = sinz8(d1)-1.6xl0-7d48(Hi)+AH5(z)+7.8xl0-8d1AH5(k) ,
(7.57)
where AH is defined by (^-Hj) and all length parameters are taken in metres.
The first two terms will not be discussed further. The third term evaluates the 
effect of errors in the measured zenith angle or of the omission of the deviation 
of the vertical. An error of 2 seconds of arc leads to the following errors 8(d4):
for AH = 50 m 
100 m 
200 m 
1000 m
8(d4) = 0.5 mm 
1.0mm 
1.9mm 
9.7mm .
99

These effects are critical for precise distance meters such as, for example, the 
Mekometer, which has an internal accuracy of 0.2 mm. This may require precise 
levelling for the determination of the height differences. The knowledge of the 
deviations of the vertical is essential in this case if the accuracy in measurement 
is not to be spoiled by inaccurate reduction due to errors in, or omission of, the 
deviations of the vertical.
The fourth term in Eq. (7.57) demonstrates the effect of the difference be­
tween the actual coefficient of refraction and the assumed value of k = 0.0, which 
is typically used for EDM reduction. It has been shown in Section 5.7 that the 
coefficient of refraction of “grazing rays” can easily vary between k = 0 at sunrise 
and sunset and k = -2 or 3 in the middle of the day. Based on an (optimistic) 
error of 5(k) = 1.0 in the assumed value of k, the following errors 8(d4) may be 
computed for the spheroidal distance:
d( = 100 m
300 m
600 m
1000 m
2000 m
3000 m
AH = 100 m 0.8 mm
2.3 mm
4.7 mm
7.8 mm
15.6 mm
23.4 mm
300 m
7.0 mm
14.0 mm
23.4 mm
46.8 mm
70.2 mm
1000 m
156.0 mm
234.0 mm
The resulting errors S(d4) are quite large, due to the large error in k. Smaller 8(k) 
may be expected, if distances are measured well above the ground (8(k) = 
0.1 -0.4). Two or three times larger 8(k) may be expected on clear, sunny days in 
summer, as indicated in Section 5.7. For precise EDM, large height differences 
should be avoided or the coefficient of refraction should be determined, through 
reciprocal trigonometric levelling for example.

8 Miscellaneous Corrections, Computations and 
Numerical Examples
Occasionally, some additional EDM corrections are required in order to achieve 
the collinearity requirements between EDM wave path and zenith angle ray paths 
which were assumed during the derivation of the geometrical corrections in Sect. 
7. A number of approaches to the problem are discussed below. These derivations 
are followed by the discussion of three EDM-related computational problems, 
namely the computation of height differences from measured zenith angles and 
slope distances (EDM-Trigonometric Heighting), the computation of the coeffi­
cient of refraction from reciprocal zenith angle (and slope distance) measurements 
and the centring of measured zenith angles and slope distances from satellite sta­
tions to their respective centre stations. This section then concludes with fully 
worked examples for the reduction to the spheroid of the measurements of a short 
and a long EDM line.
8.1 Correction of Measured Distance to Zenith Angle Ray Path
Whenever measured distances are to be reduced with the aid of measured zenith 
angles (see Sect. 7.2) although they were not measured along the zenith angle’s 
ray path, a correction from the EDM wave path (dEDM) to the zenith angle ray 
path (dTH) is required. The resulting distance (dTH) refers then to the trunnion 
axis heights of theodolite and theodolite target applicable during the zenith angle 
measurement. The correction equations depend on the degree of integration be­
tween the EDM instruments and theodolites concerned.
Such corrections are not necessary in the case of electronic tacheometers (total 
stations) with co-axial EDM and visual telescope axes measuring zenith angles 
and distances to the same reflector and in cases where the vertical offset of the 
distance meter from the theodolite is compensated by the same vertical offset of 
a special reflector-target assembly. This aspect is discussed later in more detail.
8.1.1 Correction for Unequal Heights of Theodolite, EDM Instrument, 
Target and Reflector
The correction derived below is typically required when zenith angles and distance 
measurements are executed independently with separate station occupancies.
The correction is best applied after the application of velocity corrections (see 
Sect. 6.2 and 6.4) and the first arc-to-chord correction (see Sect. 7.2.3.1) but 
before the slope correction. The situation is depicted in Fig. 8.1, where the follow­
ing elements are defined:

target (T)
dEDM = wave path chord (d2)
dTH = distance along zenith angle ray
hEDM = height of trunnion axis of EDM instrument (above survey mark Pj) 
hTH = height of trunnion axis of theodolite (above survey mark Pt)
hT = height of target (above survey mark P2)
hR = height of reflector (above survey mark P2)
zTH = measured zenith angle at station Pt between theodolite and target.
Application of the cosine rule in the hatched triangle together with the equation 
for Ah:
Ah - hEDM - hTH+hT - hR
(8.1)
leads to
^edm == din + Ah2 ~ dTH Ah cos zTH
(8.2)
and
djH = dEDM+dTH Ah cos zTH — Ah2 .
(8.3)
The distance dra may be replaced, with sufficient accuracy, by dEDM in the sec­
ond term of Eq. (8.3), because the value of the term is very small and because 
the difference between dTH and dEDM is small.

where Ah is defined by Eq. (8.1).
The above reduction procedure is used if, for example, the theodolite observa­
tions are carried out independently of the EDM measurements (viz. with different 
equipment, on different days). On steep and short lines, the heights above the 
survey mark of theodolite, EDM instrument, target and reflector have to be mea­
sured carefully and accurately. The volume of computations may be reduced at 
least for the reduction of the distance, by using constrained centring. The relation­
ships between hTH and hEDM as well as between hT and hR become constant and 
may be measured with high accuracy, thus reducing the errors of Ah in Eq. (8.5).
8.1.2 Correction for Theodolite-Mounted EDM Instruments
The reduction from the measured distance to the distance along the zenith angle 
ray path for theodolite (or standard) mounted distance meters follows easily from 
the derivation given in the previous section as the trunnion axis of the distance 
meter will always be vertically above the trunnion axis of the theodolite. The cor­
rection applies in cases where the slope distance and the zenith angle are measured 
to the centre of the reflector. (No correction is necessary if the vertical offset of 
the distance meter is compensated by a special reflector-target assembly with the 
prism vertically offset from the target by the same amount.)
This necessary correction may be derived from Eqs. (8.1) and (8.5) in Section 
8.1.1.

8.1.3 Correction for Telescope-Mounted EDM Instruments
Telescope-mounted EDM instruments are usually adjusted so as to have an op­
tical axis parallel to the optical axis of the theodolite’s telescope. Figure 8.2 in­
dicates that distance and zenith angle measurements require two independent 
pointings and a reduction from dEDM to dTH as long as both measurements are 
taken to the centre of the prism.
The problem is explained in Fig. 8.2, which depicts a vertical section through 
the theodolite (T), EDM instrument (E) and reflector (R). Assuming that the 
EDM axis (ER', E'R) is always parallel to the optical axis of the theodolite (TR, 
TR"), the telescope is first pointed at R, taking the zenith angle and the direction, 
then the EDM instrument is aligned with R. This tilt causes the EDM instrument

ray for telescope mounted EDM instruments. It is assumed that slope distance as well as zenith 
angle are measured to the centre of the reflector. The optical axis of the distance meter during 
the zenith angle measurement is indicated by the line ER'. The optical axis of the theodolite 
points along the line TR" during the distance measurement

centre E to move to E'. The distance dEDM is then measured from E'. Defining 
the eccentricity of the EDM instrument with e, the corrected distance dTH be­
tween the horizontal axis of the theodolite T and that of the reflector R may be 
computed as

The correcting term in Eq. (8.10) depends on the eccentricity of the EDM instru­
ment and the measured distance. A numerical example illustrates the magnitude 
of the correction. Assuming an eccentricity of 0.1 m, the correction is +0.5 mm 
for d = 10 m and +1 mm for d = 5 m and therefore smaller than the usual preci­
sion of such instruments.
8.2 Eye-to-Object Corrections for Zenith Angles and Distances
Occasionally it is of advantage to reduce separately measured zenith angles and 
slope distances to the corresponding values between the ground marks at the ter­
minals. This approach is commonly used to fulfil the requirement for collinearity 
between two (reciprocal) zenith angles and a slope distance unless collinearity can 
be achieved in the field by suitable procedures and equipment.
8.2.1 Eye-to-Object Correction for Zenith Angles
The zenith angle zG from the survey mark at Pj to the survey mark at P2 can be 
derived from the upper shaded triangle in Fig. 8.3. Using the sine rule in the said 
triangle yields

y = angle between spheroid normals throught Pt and P2 [see Eqs.

hT = height of target (at P2)
hTH = height of theodolite (at P^.
The second term in Eq. (8.13) amounts to less than one second of arc for distances 
larger than 16 m, if (hT- hTH) is less than 0.5 m. It can be ignored in most cases. 
It can also be shown that (8 - y) in the first term affects Q by a maximum of 0.02" 
if (hT-hTH) is less than 0.5 m. For most practical cases, the above equation can 
be simplified to:

application of the cosine rule to the lower shaded triangle in Fig. 8.3.

dG = dEDM-^^^d^+^--~h^^ COS (zG + S)+... , 
(8.19)
2d£ 
do
where dG = slope distance between ground marks
dEDM = measured slope distance (d2) 
hEDM = height of EDM instrument (at PJ 
hR = height of reflector (at P2).
Equations (8.15) and (8.18) include the unknown dG on the right hand side of 
the equations. An iterative solution procedure is therefore required. It is suggested 
to compute an initial value of dG by using dEDM for dG and zTH for zG on the 
right hand side of Eqs. (8.18) or (8.19). This initial value of dG is then used to 
compute zo through Eqs. (8.15) and (8.12) or (8.14), which, in turn, is then used 
in the final computation of dG.
The second computation of dG can be omitted, if maximum errors of 1 mm 
and 10 seconds of arc in dG and zG are permissible and the following conditions 
are met:
II^edm~hR| <0.5m ; |hT—hTn| <0.5m
and 70° < z < 110° 
; dEDM > 30 m
or 
80° < z < 100° 
; dEDM > 11 m .
Similarly, maximum errors of 0.1 mm and 0.2 seconds of arc are not exceeded for 
dG and zG, respectively, if the following restrictions apply:
|1*edm—hR| < 0.5 m ; |hy—hyjj| <0.5m
and 70° < z < 110° 
; dEDM > 200 m
or 
80° < z < 100° 
; dEDM > 60 m .
8.2.3 Numerical Example
Given are dEDM = 400.000 m ; zTH = 81 °00'00" 
^edm ~ 2.000 m j hR = 0.700 m 
hTH = 1.000 m ; hT = 1.500 m .
Using dG = 400.000 m and zG = 81°00'00" in Eq. (8.19) yields
107

= 400.000 - 0.0021 +0.2034 m
= 400.2013 m .
Substitution in Eq. (8.14) leads to
Q = 0.0012340 rad
= 4'14.5"
zG = 81°04'14.5" .
Using dG = 400.2013 m and zG = 81°04'14.5" in Eq. (8.19) gives finally
dG = 400.000-0.0021 +0.2017 m
= 400.1996 m .
As a check, zG may be recomputed with the final value for dG.
8.3 Height Difference from Measured Zenith Angle(s) 
and Slope Distance
With the introduction of EDM, the determination of height differences by 
trigonometric levelling has become very convenient. This combination of conven­
tional trigonometric levelling and EDM (and, often, precise electronic 
theodolites) let the new survey method of EDM-height traversing become a real 
alternative to spirit levelling, both in precision and in speed. A summary of this 
new technique may be found in Riieger and Brunner (1982). More recently, one- 
kilometre standard deviations of ± 1 mm to ±2 mm have been reported for simul­
taneous reciprocal EDM-height traversing (Kasser 1985; Whalen 1985).
In the field, height differences are required for a wide range of setting-out 
work. Most semi-electronic tacheometers and all fully electronic tacheometers 
provide a facility for the on-board computation of height differences, with the 
first type of instrument requiring a manual entry of observed zenith angles. Users 
of the reduction facilities of such instruments should be fully aware of the equa­
tions on which a tacheometer’s software is based. This includes the knowledge of 
the value of the coefficient of refraction used. The basic equations for the com­
putation of height differences are developed below and may be used to critically 
review the formulae which are implemented in electronic tacheometers.
8.3.1 Single Zenith Angle Measurement
The problem is depicted in Fig. 7.3 (Sect. 7.2.3). The deviations of the vertical are 
ignored because orthometric heights (= geoidal heights) are sought.
The angle of refraction 8 can be computed according to Eq. (7.46) and Fig.
7.2 as follows:
P 
d2 d2k k
o = — = — =---- — — v .
2 2r 
2R 
2
(7.46)
108

In triangle PiP2P2, the following angles can be derived:
v = z1 + 8-y = z1-f(2-k) 
(8.20)
a = 7C-(f-f)-(z1 + 5) = f-[z1-f(l-k)] . 
(8.21)
Based on Fig. 7.3 and Eqs. (7.46), (8.20) and (8.21), the sine-rule applied to the 
triangle Pt P2P2 gives
H2-Ht = d2 
= j2 cos tzi~ 
(g.22)
sin(f+-£) 
cos2"
Considering that y is very small, cosine is taken as unity.
H2-H4 = d2{cosz! cos [-*-(1 — k)]4-sinzt sin [^-(1-k)]} . 
(8.23)
With cos [£(1 -• k)] = 1.00 and sin [^-(1-k)] = ^-(1-k) as in Section 7.2.3.2:
H2 -Hj = d2 cos Zj + -^-(1 -k)d2 sin Zj . 
(8.24)
The unknown parameter may be derived from Eq. (7.44) in Section 7.2.2:
I,-------- d^sinz,--------- 
(g25)
2 2(R+H1)+2d2cosz1
Ignoring the second term of the denominator and setting Hj = 0, produces in 
conjunction with Eq. (8.23) the final form given by Brunner (1973):
H2 - Hj = d2 cos Zj + —(d2 sin zt)2 , 
(8.26)
where 
= orthometric height difference between Pi and P2
d2 = wave path chord
k = coefficient of refraction of light
R = radius of curvature of spheroid along the line [see Eqs. (7.1) 
and (7.6)]
zt = observed zenith angle in Pp
So far, all data are assumed to be measured or reduced to the points Pj and P2. 
The omission of H from the denominator of Eq. (8.25) causes an error in 
(H2-H1), computed according to Eq. (8.26) of only 1 mm for a height above sea 
level of 1000 m and a horizontal distance of 10 km.
A graph depicting the accuracy of Eq. (8.26) is given by Brunner (1973). The 
maximum error in (H^-Hj) is <0.1 mm for slope distances <2.5 km and 
height differences < 1000 m.
To cater for the heights of theodolite (hTH) and target (hT) at the terminals 
and considering further the corrections of Section 8.1 (if required), the above 
equation may be written as
H2—— ^th cos Z-pu +
1-k\
2R )
(dTH sin Zyj|)^+h^jj — hy .
(8.27)
109

The coefficient of refraction in Eqs. (8.26) and (8.27) refers to theodolite observa­
tions and not to the EDM measurement. It has been discussed in Section 5.7 that 
the actual coefficient of refraction of “grazing” rays (close to the ground) may 
vary between (-3.0) and (+4.0). Grazing rays are usually encountered in short 
range EDM. As the actual coefficient of refraction is usually unknown, the height 
differences are computed assuming a mean coefficient of refraction of 0.13. (For 
lines close to the ground, k = 0.0 would be as good or bad an assumption!)
The difference S(k) between the mean and the actual value of the coefficient 
of refraction will affect the computed height difference (H2—H^) by an error 
S(H2-Ht). The equation for 8(112-11!) is obtained by differentiating Eq. (8.26) 
with respect to k:
8 (H2 - Hj) = (d2 -nzl)2 5k 
(8.28) .
The table below gives some values for likely errors 8(H2—Hj).

The above table should be kept in mind when assessing the reliability of 
heights obtained by electronic tacheometry. If the above uncertainties are not 
tolerable, the coefficient of refraction can easily be determined on a particular 
day and at a particular location by reciprocal zenith angle measurements on one 
or more lines. The details are discussed in the following section.
8.3.2 Reciprocal Zenith Angle Measurements
The uncertainty in the coefficient of refraction k can be greatly reduced if 
reciprocal, simultaneous zenith angles are observed. The counterpart of Eq. (8.26) 
in the case of reciprocal zenith angle observations reads (Brunner 1975):
d9
H2 - Hj = — (cos z12 - cos z2i) , 
(8.29) 
where H2—= orthometric height difference between Pj and P2
d2 = wave path chord
z12 
= zenith angle at Pt to P2
z2i 
= zenith angle at P2 to Pt
Ht,H2 = orthometric ( = geoidal) heights.
Equation (8.29) can be easily derived from Eq. (8.26) and assumes colinear mea­
surements of both zenith angles and the distance. If this assumption does not 
110

hold, the eye-to-object corrections derived in Section 8.2 should be applied to all 
three measured quantities prior to the application of the above equation. The cor­
responding equation for the determination of spheroidal height differences may 
be found in Brunner (1975).
It was assumed in Eq. (8.29), that the coefficients of refraction are equal for 
the reciprocal observations. This will rarely eventuate. The uncertainty of the 
height difference (H2“Ht) caused by the uncertainty of the difference of 
reciprocal coefficients of refraction (Iq -k2) may be calculated as follows (Brun­
ner 1975):
_ 
(djsinzj)2-
O(H2-H,) - 
— G(k,-k2) »
(8.30)
where O(H2-Ht) and a(k1-k2) denotes the appropriate standard deviations.
The following values have been estimated for O(kt-k2) (Brunner 1975):
^(kj-k^ = ±0.3 for simultaneous, reciprocal zenith angle observations, and
°(k1-k2) - ±0.5 for non-simultaneous, reciprocal zenith angle observations. 
A short table may illustrate the effect of the standard deviation of Ak on the stan­
dard deviation of the height difference AH:

8.4 Determination of the Coefficient of Refraction from Reciprocal 
Zenith Angle Measurements
Reciprocal and simultaneous zenith angles are sometimes measured at the same 
time as EDM observations in order to determine the coefficient of refraction k 
for the prevailing atmospheric conditions. Sometimes this is because the uncer­
tainty of the coefficient of refraction determines the accuracy of the combined 
correction for K", Kp K4 [see Eq. (7.35)] and therefore the accuracy of the dis­
tance reduction. In other cases, such as EDM tacheometry, the prevailing coeffi­
cient of refraction is determined on a few lines to improve the accuracy of com­
puted height differences [see Eq. (8.28)].
8.4.1 Derivation of the Equation for the Coefficient of Refraction
Considering the triangle CP1P2 in Fig. 7.2, the following equations may be 
derived
111

Y+(7t-;1-5)+(n-C2-8) = 7r
Y+k = 2S+^ + £2 •
All angles are to be taken in radians.
From Fig. 7.2 and Section 7.1.1.1 follows that
x P dt dtk 
o = — = — =----  .
2 2r 2R
(8.3)
(8.32)
(7.46)
Substitution of Eq. (7.46) in Eq. (8.32) leads to 
d k
y+TC = + + 
(8.33)
d k 
= Zi + Z2 + ——F (Sj — S2) • 
(8.34)
R
Considering Eq. (7.29), the above equation may be written as
^ = ^+n-(z1+z2)-(E1-e2) , 
(8.35)
R R
thus leading to the final rigorous equation for k
k = ^+^ [7t-(z1+z2)-(Ei-g2)] , 
(8.36)
di dt
where all angles are in radians and where 
k = coefficient of refraction
di 
= wave path length
d4 
= spheroidal distance
R = radius of curvature of spheroid along the line (or mean radius) 
z15z2 = observed zenith angle at Pt and P2 respectively
£1,82 = deviation of vertical at Pt and P2 respectively (see Fig. 7.2 for sign 
of s).
A first simplification of the rigorous Eq. (8.36) may be obtained by assuming 
d4 = dt sinzi and = s2 and by expansion with 1/sinzp
J^_d, + R[K-(z,+z2)l 
(g37)
sin zt dt dt sin zt
Setting sinzt = 1.0 for the denominator on the left hand side of Eq. (8.37) leads 
to the form given by Riieger and Brunner (1981, 1982):
k = 1.0+^t1zi+z^. . 
(8.38)
dj sin zt
This equation is suitable for most short range determinations of the coefficient 
of refraction. For the computation of the coefficient of refraction on long EDM 
lines, Eq. (8.36) may be further simplified, by assuming dt = d4 and = e2, to 
the form given by Kahmen and Faig (1988):
112

T>
k = l + -(Jt-(z1+z2)} . 
(8.39)
di
It is evident from Eq. (8.36) that an omission of the (usually unknown) deviations 
of the vertical will not affect the value of k as long as the deviations are equal 
at both terminals of the line.

Assuming that
oz = o, and
Z1 Z2
OE, = % = 0 >
Eq. (8.40) may be expressed as
(8.41)
where oz is now to be taken in seconds of arc.
To investigate the effect of the accuracy of measured zenith angles on the 
derived coefficient of refraction and the combined correction (BC'+Kj +K4), Eq. 
(7.35) is differentiated to give [see also Eq. (7.40)]:
d?
a(K"+K1 +IQ = —“2 C1 “ k) °k • 
(8-42)
1ZK
To achieve an accuracy of, say, 0.3 ppm in the combined correction 
(K"+KI+K4), the accuracy of the coefficient of refraction should not be less 
than the values listed below
dj = 10 km 
= 30 km 
= 50 km 
= 70 km
= +1.46
= ±0.16
= ±0.06
= ±0.03
A worst case of (1 -k) = 1.0 has been considered in the above table.
113

On longer EDM lines, the determination of the coefficient of refraction is 
therefore justified if large deviations of the coefficient of refraction from its mean 
value of 0.13 are expected. The necessary accuracy of the zenith angle measure­
ments may be computed from
]/2d?sin(l")z,
°(K"+k1 +k<) - ------ rrr----- (1 ~k)oz • 
(8.43)
12 K
This equation can be easily derived from Eqs. (8.41) and (8.42).
To obtain the combined correction (K"+K1+K4) to an accuracy of 
±0.3 ppm, the reciprocal and simultaneous zenith angles must be measured with 
the following accuracies
dt = 10 km oz = ±5.6'
= 30 km 
=±1.9'
= 50 km 
= ±1.1'
= 70 km 
=±0.8'
Again, the term (1-k) has been taken as 1.
8.5 Reduction to Centre of Distances
Distances (and angles) are sometimes measured from a satellite station, because 
the permanent mark is occupied by a beacon or another instrument. Two different 
possibilities have to be considered. The zenith angles and horizontal directions 
may be measured at the permanent mark or at the satellite station. A three dimen­
sional solution is given, assuming that the correction for unequal heights has al­
ready been applied, where necessary.
8.5.1 Angles and Distances Measured at Satellite Station
The problem is depicted in Fig. 8.4, where
S 
= satellite station
C 
= permanent station
Pt = target (reflector) station number one
(Pt) = projection of Pt on sphere of radius r = 1
(C) = projection of C on sphere of radius r = 1
zc 
= measured zenith angle from S to C
zt 
= measured zenith angle from S to Pt
e 
= measured slope distance between S and C (eccentric distance)
d* 
= measured slope distance between S and Pt
d = centred slope distance between C and Pt
a = measured horizontal angle (C/S^O', clockwise from x axis
(C)' = projection of (C) on xy-plane
(Pt)' = projection of (Pt) on xy-plane
O = angle (C) S (Pt) = angle C SPj.
114

Y
Fig. 8.4. Reduction to the centre station C of slope distances and zenith angles measured at a 
satellite station S. (Explanation see text)
The slope distance d between C and Pt is unknown and must be determined.
In Fig. 8.4, the three-dimensional coordinate system has its origin at S and its 
x-z plane through C; an application of the cosine rule of spherical trigonometry 
to the hatched triangle yields:
cos 0 = cos zc cos zt + sin zc sin zt cos a .
Applying the cosine rule to the plane triangle SCPt gives
d2 = d*2+e2-2d*ecos 0
d = d*
2ecos(|) 
d*
Combining Eqs. (8.46) and (8.44) leads to:
d = d*

(8.44)
(8.45)
(8.46)
(8.47)
Equation (8.47) is a rigorous formula for the slope distance d between the two 
permanent stations C and Pp
115

The zenith angle at S to Pt has also to be centred. This is achieved by form­
ing the sum of height differences:
AH(CPt) = AH (S Pt)-AH (SC) 
(8.48)
d cos zCi = d* cos zt — e cos zc . 
(8.49)
The centred zenith angle from C to Pi (zc ) now becomes: 
d* e
cos zCi = — cos zt—- cos zc , 
(8.50)
where d* e, zt, zc are measured and d is known from Eq. (8.47).
8.5.2 Angles Measured at Centre Station, Distances at Satellite Station
This situation occurs in tacheometry when an EDM instrument cannot be fitted 
to a theodolite. Distances and angles to radiation points are taken simultaneously 
at the EDM and theodolite stations.

The notation in Fig. 8.5 is the same as in Fig. 8.4. As in the previous section, 
a three-dimensional co-ordinate system is assumed. In this case, the origin is coin­
cident with station C. The unknown slope distance d between centre station C and 
target station Pt may be found as
d = d*

e = measured slope distance between satellite S and centre station C 
(eccentric distance)
zs = measured zenith angle from C to S
Zj = measured zenith angle from C to Pt
a = measured horizontal angle (S)' C^)', clockwise from x-axis.
The Eq. (8.51) is rigorous. Since d appears on both sides of Eq. (8.51) an approx­
imate value d* is taken for d and improved by iteration, if necessary. The subse­
quent slope reduction uses the zenith angle zP Direct solutions for the computa­
tion of the horizontal distance between C and Pt may be found in Menzies 
(1972) and LeRoux (1976).
8.6 Numerical Examples
The process of reduction of EDM distances is explained with the aid of two 
numerical examples. The first example explains the reduction scheme for long 
distances, the second for short distances.
8.6.1 Reduction of a Long Distance
A distance was measured six times with a Siemens Albis SIAL MD60 microwave 
distance meter between the trigonometric stations Perth and Ovens in the vicinity 
of Bathurst (Australia). Three observations were taken in the master mode and 
another three in the remote mode of each instrument. The following data set was 
recorded:
Measured distance d' = 22395.667 m (mean of six observations, corrected for 
instrumental constants).
Meteorological data:
Perth p = 921.3 mb Ovens p = 882.6 mb
t =6.1 °C dry 
t =5.3 °C dry
t' = 3.2 °C wet 
t' = 3.1 °C wet
All pressures and psychrometer readings, corrected for instrumental constants of 
barometers and psychrometers, are mean values for the period of distance mea­
surement. The station coordinates and heights are as follows

Survey Grid (LS.G.) and the elevations to the Australian Height Datum 
(A.H.D.). Instrument heights above the top of the pillar may be ignored for this 
case as they are equal on both sides.

8.6.1.6 Sixth Step: Reduction to Map Grid
In most cases, geodetic computations are not carried out on the reference 
spheroid but rather in a (map) projection. The point or line scale factors which 
apply to specific national or state-wide projection systems may be taken from rele­
vant publications.
In the context of this numerical example, the equation and parameters ap­
plicable to the Integrated Survey Grid of the State of New South Wales (Australia) 
have been selected. The equation below for the line scale factor is valid for all 
Transverse Mercator Projections, the constants and false origin definition, how­
ever, not.

Thus: K = 0.999940 (1 + 0.000046839) 
= 0.999986836
The plane distance on grid (grid distance) S may be written as:
S = Kd4 
(8.53)
= 0.999986836(22389.3129) m 
= 22389.018 m .
This is the grid distance on the ISG Grid, Zone 55/3, equivalent to the measured 
EDM distance between Ovens and Perth.

8.6.2.1 First Step: First Velocity Correction
The manufacturer states the following first velocity correction for the HP 3805 A:
K'=f278.7—P 10-6d' 
(8.54)
\ 
(273.15+t)/
= f278.7-g9:148)(1008.3)\ 1q_6 
7 t
\ 
(273.15+23.8) /
= +0.0058 m .
Substituting K' in Eq. (6.8) leads to:
d = d'+K' = 587.134+0.0058 = 587.1398 m .
The fourth decimal place is carried through the computation in order to obtain 
reductions correct to three decimal places. For the reduction of distances accurate 
only to several mm, the fourth decimal place may be omitted.
8.6.2.2 Second Step: Correction for Unequal Heights
Equation (8.1) in Section 8.1.1 reads:
Ah = hEDM—h'pjj+h'p — hR — —0.211m 
(8.1)
and Eq. (8.5)
Ah2
dra — cIedm + Ah cos zth- —-----  • 
(^-5)
2dEDM
Substituting dEDM = 587.1398 m and zTH = 85°41'53" yields:
dTH = 587.1398-0.0158-0.00004 = 587.1240m .
8.6.23 Third Step: Reduction to Sea Level
Repeating Eq. (7.48) of Section 7.2.2:
a Dam tat. F d1sin[z1 + s1+(d1k/2R)]
a a = R arc tan --------------------------------------------
I R+Hj + di cos [zt + Ej + (dj k/2 R)]
(7.48)
Assuming a coefficient of refraction of light k = 0.13, a mean radius 
Rm = 6370100 m and a deviation of the vertical = 0 (and with dt = dTH and 
Ht = HA+hTH) the above equation becomes:
/ 585.47009 \
d4 = 6370100 arc tan I------------- ) = 585.3687 m
\6371203.9/
121

The second velocity correction only amounts to 1.4x10 13 m; it may be ig­
nored.
8.6.2.4 Fourth Step: Reduction to Map Grid
It is sufficient to replace the line scale factor by the point scale factor for relatively 
short distances. In the case of the Integrated Survey Grid of the State of New 
South Wales (Australia) the point scale factor is given by
K = 0.99994+1.23 (10~7y)2 
(8.55)
for y = Easting-300000 m. Considering Eq. (8.53) in Section 8.6.1 leads to:
S = Kd4
= [0.999 94+(1.23) (0.0063)2] 585.3687
= 585.362 m ,
where S is the grid distance on ISG, Zone 56/1.

9 Electro-Optical Distance Meters
Distance meters featuring visible light or near infrared (NIR) radiation as carrier 
waves are called electro-optical EDM instruments. These carrier waves follow the 
laws of geometrical optics; normal telescopes are used for transmitting and receiv­
ing the signals.
9.1 Classification of Electro-Optical Distance Meters
Several criteria may be used to classify electro-optical distance meters. A few are 
mentioned here:
1. range
2. accuracy
3. degree of integration with a theodolite.
Other criteria for classification have been discussed in Sections 4.1.3 (phase mea­
surement), 4.1.1 (light source) and 4.1.2 (modulation technique).
9.1.1 Classification According to Range
Three classes of instruments may be distinguished with respect to range:
1. short range EDM instruments
2. medium range EDM instruments
3. long range EDM instruments.
Short range instruments have a range from around 0.1 m to between 1000 m and 
2000 m using a single prism. They are usually equipped with infrared (IR) emit­
ting or lasing diodes.
Long range instruments may have a larger minimum distance (for example, for 
the Geodimeter 8, 15 m) and are usually equipped with a HeNe laser. The maxi­
mum range of such instruments depends very much on visibility (see Sect. 5.1) 
and the number of prisms used. With a large number of prisms (20- 40) distances 
up to 70 km may be measured on clear days. Night time ranges of 120 km have 
been reported for the Keuffel & Esser/Cubic Precision Rangemaster III.
A class of medium range instruments with a maximum range of 5-10 km is 
also available; manufacturers usually classify these as long range instruments. 
Medium range instruments may eventually disappear, because the maximum 
range of short range instruments is steadily increasing towards the medium range.
123

9.1.2 Classification According to Accuracy
Five categories of instruments may be distinguished with respect to their accuracy. 
The accuracy specifications presently used by manufacturers are based on the 
assumptions that the prescribed observation procedures are followed and that at 
least the additive constant and the scale are calibrated by the user. It should be 
noted, for example, that the uncertainty of the measurement of the atmospheric 
parameters is not included in the ppm values listed below. (More details on the 
definition of accuracy specifications may be found in Section 13.5.)
1. Instruments with a standard deviation of one obser­
vation greater than
2. Instruments with a standard deviation of one obser­
vation equal or smaller than
3. Instruments with a standard deviation of one obser­
vation of about
4. Instruments with a standard deviation of one obser­
vation equal or smaller than
5. Instruments with a standard deviation of one obser­
vation equal or smaller than
±(5 mm+5 ppm)
±(5 mm+5 ppm)
±(5 mm+1 ppm)
±(1 mm+2 ppm)
± (0.2 mm+0.2 ppm)
Group (1) includes a number of pulse distance meters used for measurements to 
passive targets or to moving targets. The second group of instruments includes 
most short range distance meters found in general surveying practice. Group (3) 
refers mainly to specialized long range distance meters such as the AGA 
Geodimeter Model 8 or the Keuffel & Esser/Cubic Precision Rangemaster III. 
The instruments of Group 4 are often referred to as precision distance meters and 
include some infrared instruments. The instruments of Group 5 may be called 
high precision distance meters and include the laser instruments Kern Mekometer 
ME 5000 and Terra Technology Terrameter LDM-2. A more comprehensive list of 
instruments is given in Appendices E, F and G.
9.1.3 Classification According to the Degree of Integration with 
Theodolites
As the combination of angle and distance measurements is typical in general 
survey practice, the integration of EDM instruments with theodolites is very im­
portant from an operational point of view. Because of the large variety of integra­
tion concepts, any classification of the degree of integration between EDM in­
struments and theodolites will necessarily remain incomplete. The major concepts 
of EDM-theodolite integration are outlined below and their relative merits 
discussed.
9.1.3.1 Full Electronic Tacheometers
Electronic tacheometers are fully integrated EDM instruments and electronic 
theodolites featuring coaxial optics and digital output of all measured data. They 
124

are best used in conjunction with electronic data processing and plotting in large 
detail or contour surveys and also for large setting-out surveys. Electronic 
tacheometers have become smaller, lighter and more versatile during the last few 
years.
The development of electronic tacheometers was pioneered by Zeiss (Reg 
ELTA14 in 1970) and AGA (Geodimeter 700 in 1971). Second generation in­
struments by Hewlett-Packard (HP3820A), Wild (Tachymat TC1), Zeiss (ELTA2 
and ELTA4) became available around 1978. By 1985, electronic tacheometers 
were available from most surveying instrument manufacturers, with the Topcon 
ET-1 (1983) being the first Japanese instrument of this type.
The reduction of distances causes no problem because of the coaxial design 
which integrates the EDM instrument and theodolite. The centre of the reflector 
is used as a target for the measurement of horizontal directions and zenith angles. 
For more precise angular work the precision of pointing the reflector to the elec­
tronic tacheometer becomes critical. The virtual displacement of the reflector’s 
glass cube corner due to refraction at the reflector’s front surface depends on its 
size, construction and pointing facilities. It will not exceed a few millimeters, as 
shown in Section 10.2.5.3.
9.1.3.2 Modular Electronic Tacheometers
A combination of a telescope-mounted EDM instrument with an electronic 
theodolite may be called a modular electronic tacheometer. Modular electronic 
tacheometers feature on-line data transfer between EDM instrument and elec­
tronic theodolite as well as on-board computation of horizontal distance and 
height difference. Such modular electronic tacheometers should require only 
single pointing for angular and distance measurements and no cables for the con­
nection of the EDM instrument to theodolite and battery (“hot shoe” connection 
between theodolite and distance meter).
Some further aspects relating to telescope mounted EDM instruments are 
discussed below in Section 9.I.3.4.
9.13.3 Semi-Electronic Tacheometers
Such instruments may be fully integrated as far as the optics are concerned but 
may feature optical (rather than electronic) circles in the theodolite part of the 
instrument. Alternatively, the integration of the optical paths may be lacking but 
at least the zenith angle may be read electronically. Two groups of semi-electronic 
tacheometers are selected for further discussion:
1. Fully integrated EDM instrument and theodolite with visually read glass 
circles featuring coaxial EDM and theodolite telescopes. Angles and distances 
are measured simultaneously to the prism, thus requiring only one pointing 
in FL (as long as the angles need not be repeated in FR!). Typically, the instru­
ment permits on-board computation of horizontal distance and height dif­
ference after manual input of the measured zenith angle.
125

This type of semi-electronic tacheometer was pioneered by Zeiss with the 
SM11 (1970) and SM4 (1977). It became very popular after the first Japanese 
instruments became available in the early 1980’s (e.g. Topcon GTS-2 in 1981).
2. EDM instrument with built-in zenith angle sensor featuring on-line computa­
tion of horizontal distance and height difference without external input. Such 
instruments are either mounted on the telescope of an optical theodolite or 
are fully integrated instruments of the type described above. In both cases, the 
built-in level sensor can easily be checked and calibrated by comparison with 
the zenith angle measurements obtained with the theodolite.
9.13.4 Telescope-Mounted EDM Instruments
This group includes all EDM instruments which are mounted on the telescope of 
a theodolite. The advantage of this system is the combined pointing for EDM, 
zenith angles and directions, and the virtual absence of any additional correc­
tions. The weight of such instruments is kept low because of the strain on the ver­
tical and horizontal axis of the theodolite. Three designs may be distinguished:
1. Only one pointing for angles and distances is necessary. The offset of the 
EDM instrument axis relative to the theodolite’s telescope axis is taken into 
account by a special reflector-target system with the same offset between 
reflector and theodolite target. The reflector-target has to be tiltable about a 
horizontal axis through the target to compensate for the tilt of the EDM in­
strument about the trunnion axis of the theodolite. It should be noted that 
poor vertical pointing of the reflector leads to relatively large errors in mea­
sured distances.
2. EDM instruments with the transmitter and receiver on opposite sides of the 
theodolite telescope need only one pointing to the centre of the reflector for 
direction, zenith angle and distance, as described in Section 9.1.3.1 (e.g. Kern 
DM 500/501 /502/503/504/550).
3. EDM instrument-theodolite combinations, using a reflector as target, normal­
ly require two pointings, one for zenith angle and direction and one for dis­
tance. The zenith angle measured to the reflector centre is subsequently used 
for distance reduction. Theoretically, a small additional correction should be 
applied to the measured distance on very close range. However, this correction 
is so small that it may be omitted in most cases. This (small) distance correc­
tion for telescope-mounted EDM instruments has been discussed previously 
in Section 8.1.3.
Most telescope-mounted EDM instruments permit theodolite observations in one 
face only as long as the EDM instrument is attached. However, some EDM instru­
ment-theodolite combinations allow a change of face with mounted EDM instru­
ment. For example, all Kern EDM instruments of the DM500 Series on Kern 
theodolites permit full 360 degree rotation of the telescope and most Wild dis­
tance meters on Wild theodolites permit theodolite measurements in two faces.
126

9.1.3.5 Theodolite-Mounted EDM Instruments
EDM instruments which are fixed on the standards of a theodolite are called 
theodolite-mounted instruments. They feature a horizontal axis and a sighting 
telescope of their own, because the EDM pointing has to be independent of the 
theodolite pointing. Transitting of the theodolite telescope is possible. The advan­
tage of such a design is that no strain is put onto the transit axis. The vertical axis 
system of the theodolite has to carry the additional weight. Because of the fact 
that the EDM instrument has a large eccentricity relative to the horizontal axis 
of the theodolite and does not tilt with the telescope of the theodolite, relatively 
large (a few centimetres) distance corrections apply if zenith angles and slope 
distances are observed to one and the same prism. The relevant equations as well 
as some numerical values have been given in Section 8.1.2.
In order to avoid the additional distance corrections, special reflector-target 
combinations may be used. These reflector-target assemblies must have a vertical 
separation of target and reflector equal to the vertical separation of theodolite 
and EDM instrument and separate tilting axes of prism and target (although the 
latter may not be necessary in some cases).
9.1.3.6 Separate EDM Instruments
Most instruments in this category are either long range or high precision in­
struments. At long distances, simultaneous angle measurements are usually not 
required because the distances are reduced with the aid of given station heights. 
Any direction measurements would be carried out with first-order theodolites 
which should not carry the additional weight of an EDM instrument. (Eccentric 
theodolite set-ups are used if reciprocal zenith angles are to be measured for the 
determination of the coefficient of refraction.)
Some telescope- or theodolite-mounted short range EDM instruments are also 
available as stand-alone instruments with appropriate yoke mounts, and thus also 
fall into this category. In short range applications with such instruments, as well 
as with high precision or precision distance meters, the measurement of zenith 
angles is often required. In these cases, the geometrical correlation between zenith 
angle and distance measurements may be achieved by
either 1. replacing the EDM instrument by a theodolite which fits the same con­
strained centring system and measuring the zenith angle to the centre 
of the reflector
or 2. replacing the EDM instrument by a theodolite, and the reflector by a 
traversing target in a common constrained centring system and then 
measuring the zenith angle to the target.
The first method requires distance corrections according to Eq. (8.6) in Section 
8.1.2. The second method needs no corrections for unequal instrument and target 
heights, if the target has the same “height” as the theodolite and the reflector the 
same “height” as the EDM instrument; “height” relates to the common con­
strained centring system. Such a system was adopted for the precision distance 
meter Mekometer ME 3000 in conjunction with Kern theodolites (DKM2A,
127

DKM3) and a combined reflector-target. The method has been further improved 
by the use of “fixed height” two-foot-screw instrument bases. Such fixed height 
levelling bases are a feature of the Kern Mekometer ME 5000, its reflector, the 
Kern electronic theodolites El and E2 and the Com-Rad Geomensor 204DME. 
If the second method is used in conjunction with equipment which does not fulfil 
the conditions of corresponding “heights” specified above, corrections according 
to Eq. (8.5) have to be applied (see Sect. 8.1.1).
9.1.4 Special Features of Modem Short Range Distance Meters
Most short range EDM instruments provide a wide range of features which make 
the operation of the instruments more efficient and convenient. A selection of 
such special features is explained below.
9.1.4.1 On-Board Application of First Velocity Correction
Most modern distance meters feature a facility for the on-line application of the 
first velocity correction, as discussed previously in Section 6.3. Use of the facility 
leads to first velocity corrected display distances. A manual input is required to 
enable this facility. Typical input quantities are:
- ppm correction value
- temperature, pressure (humidity) 
- refractivity.
Traditionally, the ppm correction is derived from measured temperature and 
pressure (or, alternatively, mean sea level height) with the aid of correction charts 
or slide rulers supplied by manufacturers and then entered through a (environ­
mental correction) dial, switches or a numerical keyboard. The least count of the 
input facility should be such that the specified accuracy of the instrument is not 
downgraded by the use the ppm input. Early instruments such as the Wild 
Distomat DI 3 and the Hewlett-Packard HP 3805 A had dials graduated in steps 
of 30 ppm and 10 ppm, respectively, leading to maximum errors in the display 
distances of 15 ppm and 5 ppm. More recent instruments feature a least count of 
the ppm input of 2 ppm, 1 ppm or even 0.1 ppm. To eliminate any round-off er­
rors of the ppm input or to achieve the most accurate first velocity correction, the 
ppm input may be set to zero and the first velocity correction applied by computa­
tion in the office using the equations derived in Section 6.2.
As an alternative to the ppm input, the direct input of temperature, pressure, 
and possibly humidity is becoming more popular with manufacturers. No an- 
cilliary charts or slide rulers are required as directly measured (or estimated) 
quantities are entered through a keyboard. The alternative of using heights above 
mean sea level rather than pressure is usually not available unless the values in 
Appendix C are considered. Based on the input values, the EDM instrument’s 
computer calculates the first velocity correction according to formulae similar to 
those shown in Section 6.2. Humidity is typically ignored. The accuracy of the 
on-board computation is limited by the resolution of the temperature and pressure 
128

input, the inaccuracies of the equation used and the numerical accuracy of the 
computer. To eliminate any residual errors (or the omission of the humidity term) 
of the on-line correction, reference temperature and pressure (see Section 6.1) may 
be entered in the field and the normal correction applied in the office following 
the equations given in Section 6.2.
As a third option, refractivity may be used as an input variable. This approach 
has rarely been used. This method has no advantages over the ppm method 
because the value of refractivity must be computed by using charts or slide rulers. 
For example, the Precision International/Cubic Precision Citation CI 450 and the 
Pentax PM-81 (see Section 6.2.2) distance meters feature a first velocity correction 
input based on refractivity.
On-line first velocity corrections are appropriate for short distances, where 
temperature and pressure are typically recorded at the instrument station only (for 
further details, refer to Sects. 5.8, 5.9.1 and 5.9.2). On longer distances, at­
mospheric data are recorded at both terminals. Although a mean correction could 
be entered into (or computed by) the instrument, it is usually preferred to set the 
distance meter to zero ppm (or equivalent reference temperature and pressure) and 
to apply the first velocity correction subsequently by office computations.
The environmental (or first velocity) correction system of a distance meter 
may be easily checked by measuring a 1-km distance with differing dial settings; 
a change of 1 mm in distance then corresponds to 1 ppm and the internal accuracy 
of the instrument (e.g. ±5 mm) affects the test result by an insignificant amount 
(e.g. ±5 ppm). Test measurements may be carried out at +50 ppm, +25 ppm, 
±0ppm, -25 ppm and -50 ppm, for example.
EDM instruments equipped with a ppm correction facility may be used to 
apply a combined scale correction consisting of:
1. the first velocity correction
2. the sea level correction
3. the point scale factor of the map projection.
Such a combined correction is useful for setting out work based on map grid 
coordinates. However, it is important to realize that such a combined correction 
would also be applied automatically to any height differences computed by the 
distance meter. Combined scale corrections should therefore be restricted to cases 
where solely horizontal distances are required, unless the errors caused in the 
height differences are negligible.
The full advantage of an on-board first velocity correction is only gained in 
setting out and if other computations (e.g. slope correction) are also carried out 
by the distance meter. Distance reductions which are executed on office computers 
may well include all parameters and corrections and thus render separate field 
reductions less efficient and accurate. It is important to note that all parameters 
required for the correction are booked in the field, as well as the applied correc­
tion itself, to allow a checking in the office.
9.1.4.2 Computation of Horizontal Distance and Height Difference
A large number of short range instruments provide the facility of computing the 
horizontal distance and the height difference. Electronic tacheometers provide 
129

these data automatically; with other instruments, the zenith angle has to be di­
alled in manually. Automation is very convenient for setting out work in which 
horizontal distances are provided. Users of such instruments should know exactly 
how the internal programs determine the horizontal distance and height dif­
ference and the accuracy of the determination. For longer distances and higher 
accuracies it may be better to reduce the measured slope distances with formulae 
given in Section 7.2.
9.1.43 Tracking Mode
The tracking mode of an EDM instrument is that measuring routine which 
measures the distance to a moving reflector continuously or at constant time in­
tervals (e.g. every 2 s), if continuous pointing is provided. This facility is therefore 
very useful for setting out. Distances obtained in the tracking mode are usually 
less accurate than those in the normal mode because the distances are based on 
smaller observation samples. The full advantage of the tracking mode is obtained 
only if the instrument reduces slope distances automatically to horizontal 
distances, thus providing the tracking of horizontal distances and possibly the 
tracking of height differences.
9.L4.4 Audio Signal
An audio signal may supplement or replace the traditional galvanometer for the 
display of the return signal strength. The pitch of a tone becomes a measure for 
the strength of the return signal. The volume of an audio signal should be ad­
justable. The audio signal may be transmitted by radio to the reflector-man, thus 
enabling him to align the reflector. This possibility should be very helpful in set­
ting out.
9.L4.5 Automatic Data Recording
All full and modular electronic tacheometers, as well as some semi-electronic 
tacheometers and a few other EDM instruments, provide on-line recording 
facilities. The actual recording media may consist of
- solid state memory
- magnetic bubble memory
- cassette tape
- diskettes (floppy disks),
and may reside inside the EDM instrument (or tacheometer) or inside an external 
unit, such as
- on-board recording module (instrument-specific)
- external field data recorder (instrument-specific)
— pocket calculator (through interface, e.g. HP41C)
— field computer (through interface)
- office computer (through interface).
130

Please note that manufacturers typically support only a limited number of the 
above options for specific instruments. Make-specific field data recorders are 
common and may support between one and all EDM instruments and electronic 
tacheometers of the same make. The provision of interfaces for calculators and 
computers is increasing.
In the case of recording modules, no additional cables are required. In all 
other cases, the cable between the EDM instrument (or tacheometer) and the ex­
ternal recording unit should not interfere with the operation of the EDM instru­
ment and its host theodolite. Ideally, the EDM data are transmitted through the 
host theodolite to a cable port in the (non-rotating) base of the theodolite. Often, 
this is achieved by use of the internal power supply cabling as communication 
link. In these cases the power supply port doubles as communication port.
Additional equipment is needed to read data from recording modules residing 
in or on EDM instruments and to transfer such data to a computer for processing. 
External recording units typically allow data transfer to computers, possibly re­
quiring additional interfaces.
It is important that only one command is required to record a full data set 
comprising, for example, point number, horizontal direction, zenith angle, slope 
distance, height of instrument and target. The sequence and redundancy of 
storage is very important. Some manufacturers provide processing programs to 
bring stored data into a usable form. Automatic data recording is of limited use 
unless a full chain from field measurements to computations and plan is secured.
9.1.4.6 Computer-Assisted Surveying
The first electronic tacheometer to provide any integrated computing facilities in 
excess of slope reduction, height difference, standard deviation and possibly bear­
ing and distance computations was the Zeiss ELTA2. Already the first electronic 
tacheometer REG ELTA14 had an attachment for the same purpose in later years.
The Zeiss ELTA 2 allows the storage of control points and detail points to be 
set out in the solid state recording unit prior to the fieldwork. In the field, an ad­
ditional computer unit (slide-in) will determine, for example, the station coor­
dinates of a free stationing point (from radiations to 4 stations) and will assist 
in setting out by indicating left-right and forward-backward movements to get 
from the reflector station to final point to be set out.
Ten years after the introduction of the Zeiss ELTA 2 in 1978, most fully in­
tegrated and modular electronic tacheometers provide, in connection with their 
respective data recorders, some form of computing assistance. Some manufac­
turers put the computing power into the tacheometers, some others into the cor­
responding data recorders. This leads to combinations of “dumb” data recorders 
with “intelligent” tacheometers and “intelligent” data recorders with “dumb” 
tacheometers.
As an example, some of the EDM-related computing tasks provided by the 
Geodimeter Geodat 126 data recorder (in connection with the Geodimeter System 
400) are listed below:
131

- Horizontal distance and height difference (see Sect. 9.1.4.2).
- Station coordinates (x, y, z) from resection with directions and distances.
- Traversing: Carrying forward of coordinates and traverse adjustment after 
closure of traverse.
- Bearing and distance between instrument station and reference object (point 
of known coordinates used for the orientation of the horizontal circle), in­
cluding computation of orientation unknown and its subsequent application 
for the conversion of measured directions into measured bearings.
- Detail point coordinates (x, y, z) from radiations.
- Setting out data from given coordinates and comparison with actual measure­
ment; display of necessary move of reflector forward/backward and left/ 
right.
- Setting out of straight lines defined by two coordinated points: the distance 
from the starting point of the line as well as the offset from the line to be set 
out is computed.
- Height difference between reflector (or ground level) and inaccessible point 
directly above (or below), e.g. height of buildings, ground clearance of power 
lines. The same routine can also be used for the setting out of heights.
- Distance and elevation difference between two radiated points.
Similar (and additional) computing routines are available for some other makes 
of tacheometers and data recorders and might include routines for the setting out 
of circular curves and EDM height traversing. Some “intelligent” data recorders 
as well as all interfaced calculators and computers can be programmed by the 
user. This allows the implementation of any other required field computing tasks.
9.1.4.7 Computer-Controlled Distance Measurement
A number of electronic tacheometers and other distance meters permit two-way 
communication with computers through standard RS-232 C interfaces, either 
directly or through their respective data recorders. Computers may be linked to 
the instrument or data recorder through cables, telephone lines (using modems) 
or even through radio communication links.
If a single distance needs to be measured repeatedly, the computer can be pro­
grammed to start distance measurements at predetermined times and to analyze 
and store these observations. Such an application for the remote monitoring of un­
stable slopes has been reported by Kern (1987). A similar arrangement can be used 
for the real-time control of linear motions of machines and cranes. In such cases, 
the computer becomes part of a feed-back loop which monitors and controls the 
movements of the machines or cranes. A special distance meter (HP 3850A) was 
developed at one time for this very purpose by Hewlett-Packard and used in-house 
for the control of the manufacturing of printed-circuit boards (Brown et al. 1981). 
AGA offers the Total Control System (TCS) for similar purposes.
As soon as computer control for the measurement of a number of different 
distances is required, the distance meter must be mounted on or be part of a 
motor-driven electronic theodolite or tacheometer, so that the pointing of the dis­
tance meter can be automated. A complete slope monitoring system has been 
132

developed by Geodimeter (Model 140 SMS) based on the Geodimeter 140 and a 
IBM-PC compatible computer (Geotronics 1987). The initial pointing to all 
reflectors is done manually. Afterwards, the instrument is pointed automatically 
to the initially recorded reflector position, after which an electronic fine pointing 
is carried out and the horizontal direction, the zenith angle and the slope distance 
measured. The first velocity correction is applied using electronically measured 
temperatures and pressures at the instrument site. Prototypes of a similar instru­
ment based on the motorized version of the electronic theodolite Wild T2000 and 
a Wild distance meter were reported by Kahmen and Steudel (1988) and Schneuw- 
ly and Celio (1988). The automatic survey station Wild TM3000D was released 
in 1989.
A related application is the automatic tracking of moving ships or other 
targets. Such positioning systems are required in hydrographic surveying, for ex­
ample. Typically, only distances and directions (bearing) are required, with the 
third dimension given by the water surface. The instrument manufactured by 
Krupp Atlas Elektronik (Krupp 1983) features a remote controlled measuring sta­
tion on shore and the reflector, control unit and computer on the moving target. 
Two-way data communication is by a SHF telemetry link. The resolution of the 
pulse distance measurement (laser diode) is given as ±0.1 m. Similar instruments 
are available from other manufacturers.
9.1.4.8 Setting-Out Aids
The use of EDM tacheometry for setting-out purposes requires frequent com­
munications between the observer at the instrument and the assistant at the reflec­
tor in order to bring the reflector to its design position. Handheld two-way radios 
may be used for the purpose. However, less radio communications lead to a faster 
completion of the job.
Some Geodimeter instruments feature a one-way voice link between the instru­
ment and the reflector, with a microphone at the instrument and a small infrared 
detector and a loudspeaker at the reflector end. The voice signal is transmitted 
with an additional modulation of the EDM beam. Some Geodimeter instruments 
can be equipped further with a visible flash light which projects three coloured 
sectors. The assistant at the reflector sees a white light when on line and a red 
or green light when outside the centre of the beam. The flash rate doubles as soon 
as the EDM instruments receives a return signal. When using both facilities, the 
initial alignment into the measuring line is done by the assistant without help and 
the backward/forward information is communicated over the infrared voice link.
For the same purpose, Kern supplies a reflector mounted infrared receiver 
which is able to receive and display the “distances” measured by the distance 
meter. Depending on the host theodolite, the following displays can be selected: 
slope distance, horizontal distance or height difference. The latter two options are 
only available in conjunction with electronic Kern theodolites. Infrared detectors 
serving as an aid for the positioning of the reflector in the EDM beam are sup­
plied by a number of manufacturers.
133

9.L4.9 Pointing Aids
Pointing aids are designed to facilitate the pointing of EDM instruments to reflec­
tors in special cases. The aids can be based at the instrument or at the reflector 
station. No problems are usually encountered during close range distance mea­
surements, unless the reflector/target is hidden behind leaves, for example. In­
struments using visible light sources, such as HeNe lasers, can make use of the 
returned laser beam for pointing purposes. In the case of infrared distance meters, 
the pointing can be facilitated by mounting a flash light near the reflector or by 
mounting an aligned flash light on the distance meter. Flash lights for reflector 
mounts are available from Wild, for example. The second option is implemented 
in some Geodimeter instruments with the three-colour track light (see above).
When using infrared distance meters on medium or long ranges, it is often im­
possible to see the reflector or its tripod through the telescope. A flash light, cen­
trally mounted in a reflector array (such as the Wild target lamp GEB72), can 
greatly assist with the pointing of the distance meter and can double as a target 
for angular observations, which might be impossible otherwise. On sunny days, 
an efficient alternative is available: The assistant at the reflector can assist the 
EDM pointing by flashing the sun light towards the instrument with a small mir­
ror. At night, a torch may be pointed towards the reflector from the EDM instru­
ment side. The light reflected by the reflector may then be used for pointing pur­
poses.
The pointing of HeNe laser instruments on very long lines can be similarly 
difficult, due to their narrow beams and the small amount of light returned by 
the prisms. Aids similar to the above may be used.
9.1.4.10 Other Features of Short Range Distance Meters
A few other distinguishing properties of short range distance meters are men­
tioned because they may be important in selecting an instrument.
In 1988, most instruments feature fully automatic attenuation (“balancing”) 
of the return signal strength. This is typically achieved in two ways, namely op­
tically, through internal variable neutral density filters, and electronically, through 
automatic gain control (AGC) circuits. Older instruments may require manual 
“balancing” or “tuning” of the return signal, manual setting of an aperture 
diaphragm or manual attachment of a so-called attenuator to the transmitter or 
receiver optics. The latter may be in the form of a neutral density or infrared filter 
or a perforated disk.
Most short range distance meters permit user access to one or more preset in­
strument corrections or operating parameters. For competent instrument opera­
tors, this is advantageous. For incompetent operators, it may be disastrous. 
Typically, the user has access to the prism constant and/or the instrument con­
stant. Most (but, unfortunately, not all) manufacturers assign the sign of a correc­
tion to these values. The resolution of the input of these quantities should be in 
agreement with the stated accuracy of the respective instrument. A record of all 
preset constants should be kept in a log book for future reference and should be 
(automatically) transferred to the data recorder at each set-up.
134

Since the 1980’s, distance meters are usually able to detect beam breaks and 
to stop and re-start measurements automatically. The beam break routines differ 
from instrument type to instrument type, with some instruments coping better 
with repeated beam breaks than others. Intermittent loss of signal occurs typically 
when measuring through traffic, but also in severe heat shimmer conditions.
For a limited number of applications, it is essential that the distance meter or 
the tacheometer can measure in plumb line direction (upwards). Only a limited 
number of instruments permit such vertical measurements. Diagonal eyepieces 
are required for the main telescope and, possibly, for the circle reading telescope 
and the distance reading should remain visible for the upward-pointing instru­
ment.
Changing face of the theodolite is possible with some telescope-mounted 
EDM instruments but not with others. For lower accuracy work, this criterion is 
not really important because the measurement of directions and zenith angles in 
two faces may not be required.
The advantage of having no obstructing cables between the rotary part of the 
EDM instrument or the EDM instrument-theodolite combination and the tripod 
or ground may be another factor affecting the ease of EDM and angular measure­
ments. Cables cause additional unbalanced strain on the instrumental axes. Of the 
two types of interfering cables, namely power supply and data transfer (electronic 
tacheometers), the former may be easier to replace by better design.
9.2 Design of Some Electro-Optical Distance Meters
The working principle and some components of electro-optical EDM instruments 
were discussed in Section 4.1. The design of some instruments is now explained 
in more detail to demonstrate the different design principles and the interaction 
of different components. A wider range of instruments is covered in a number of 
books (e.g. Saastamoinen 1969; Burnside 1991; Laurila 1976; Kahmen 1978; 
Zetsche 1979; Bolsakov et al. 1985), patent applications and numerous technical 
papers.
9.2.1 Kern DM500
The Kern DM500 is a representative of the large group of electro-optical short 
range distance meters employing techniques such as direct modulation, direct 
demodulation and digital phase measurement. This telescope-mounted distance 
meter was first released in 1974. More recent models of the same basic design in­
terface with electronic theodolites and thus become part of modular electronic 
tacheometers. The block diagram of the original DM500 is depicted in Fig. 9.1 
(Munch 1973, 1974).
The transmitter includes a master oscillator, a digital divider (1:100), a 
modulator and two infrared emitting diodes. The master oscillator (RTXO) 
produces the fine measurement frequency of 14.985400 MHz (—15 MHz) cor­
responding to a unit length of 10 m. The coarse measurement frequency of
135

Fig. 9.1. Block diagram of the Kern DM 500 distance meter. The transmitting and receiving 
optics are not shown
149.854 kHz (—150 kHz) is then derived by the divider. The modulator has an in­
put for both frequencies and selects one of them according to the commands 
coming from the program control through a glass fibre. The power supply of the 
transmitter block is not shown in Fig. 9.1. The modulator drives two infrared 
emitting diodes. The radiation of the first travels either through the external or 
the internal light path, the second one through a glass fibre to the reference signal 
receiver, thus providing an optical coupling between the transmitter and receiver. 
Optical coupling has the advantage of full electrical isolation.
In front of the first emitting diode, a turning shutter opens either the interval 
or external light path according to commands from the program control. The 
measuring as well as the reference beam are amplitude-modulated by the 15 MHz 
or 150 kHz signal.
Two almost identical receiver blocks process the measuring and reference sig­
nal. Avalanche photodiodes transform the incident IR beams into modulated 
electrical currents which pass first through preamplifiers and then through mix­
ers. In the mixers a signal from an auxiliary oscillator, having a frequency of 
150 kHz below the master oscillator’s frequency (14.835 MHz), is multiplied with 
the 15 MHz or 150 kHz signal coming from the preamplifier thus generating 
signals of different frequencies. In the following selective amplifier, only the low 
frequency (LF) signal of 150 kHz is amplified. The output of the selective 
amplifier has therefore always a LF of 150 kHz irrespective of the modulation fre­
136

quency (either 15 MHz or 150 kHz) received at the photodiode. It can be shown 
that the phase difference between the signals in the reference and the measure­
ment channel, either LF or HF, does not change through the frequency transfor­
mation in the mixers (Munch 1973). Low frequencies are easier to handle in a 
digital phase measurement and are therefore preferred for that purpose. This prin­
ciple of down-converting HF signals into LF signals was first implemented in the 
AGA Geodimeter 6 A in 1967 after a proposal by Bjerhammar (1971).
The reference and measurement signals pass a trigger before they enter the 
block of the digital phase measurement as square waves. This type of phase mea­
surement is described in Section 4.1.3.3 and depicted in Figs. 4.9 and 4.10. The 
auxilliary oscillator of the phase measurement section is also used as a time base 
for the program control of the distance meter.
The program control organizes the entire distance measurement once the start 
button has been pressed. It controls the selection of the frequencies, the selection 
of the measurement signal path (turning shutter) and the counter.
The processor subtracts the number of counts of the internal path from those 
of the external path for the fine measurement. This differencing between internal 
and external path is essential as the phase drifts with time and temperature. 
Without it, the additive constant of the distance meter would be strongly time and 
temperature dependent. The processor then converts counts into length units, 
adds the additive constant (built-in) and brings all three digits after the decimal 
point onto the display. The number of full metres within the unit length of 10 m 
is stored, until the internal and external path of the coarse measurement 
(150 kHz) is also measured and processed. The value of full metres in the zero to 
10-m interval is then compared between the coarse and the fine measurement and 
the former adjusted. The digits of the coarse measurement then go onto the dis­
play.
The adjustment of the two values for the first digit on the left of the decimal 
point has to be made in such a way that the fine measurement takes precedence 
over the coarse measurement. In order to always obtain a positive correction to 
the 0 to 10 m value of the coarse measurement, 5 m is subtracted from the coarse 
measurement first by setting the start value of the display at 995 m. The reduced 
coarse value is then compared with the fine value and the necessary additional 
and integer terms computed. This system corrects for errors of up to 5 m in the 
coarse measurement. An example may illustrate the procedure:

The start constant of 995.068 m includes the -5 m offset (= +995 m) as well as 
the preset (built-in) additive constant of +0.068 mm. The results of the actual 
phase measurements at the fine and coarse unit lengths are shown in brackets. 
Before merging the coarse and fine measurements, 1 m is added to the coarse 
measurement to match the metre value of the fine measurement.
Like all distance meters with digital phase measurement, the DM500 has to 
check whether the measured phase differences of the external path are close to 
zero. Phase difference measurements around zero could lead to errors because of 
the erroneous averaging of, say, 0.01 m fine measurements with 9.99 m fine mea­
surements. The problem can easily be overcome by inverting (shift by 180 degrees 
or 5 m) the signal in the reference path and by elimination of the introduced 5-m 
bias later, prior to the display of the result.
The galvanometer has differing functions which may be selected by turning 
a switch located on the instrument panel. It measures the battery voltage, the 
strength of the reference or return signal, as may be seen on the different inputs 
on the block diagram in Fig. 9.1. The aperture diaphragm is used to adjust the 
strength of the return signal to that of the reference signal by changing the aper­
ture of the receiver optics.
The two beam splitters and the connecting glass fibre are part of the internal 
light path. The measuring sequence of the instrument is as follows:
1. 2 seconds of time: fine measurement (15 MHz), external path
2. 2 seconds of time: fine measurement (15 MHz), internal path
3. 2 seconds of time: coarse measurement (150 kHz), external path
4. 2 seconds of time: coarse measurement (150 kHz), internal path.
The equal time intervals for all four measurements result from the use of the same 
phase measurement routine for all four steps. About 300000 phase measurements 
can be made in 2 seconds of time at a frequency of 150 kHz.
The original DM500 had a range of 300 m to a single prism and a specified 
accuracy of ±(5mm+5ppm). The subsequent development of this instrument 
series may illustrate the rapid progress made in terms of built-in features, range 
and accuracy. The first (DM501) of the later models of the DM500 featured 
automatic attenuation (with liquid crystal filters), tracking mode and extended 
range (1.2 km). The DM502 featured LCD displays for better visibility and re­
duced power consumption, reduced measuring time (8 s) and an improved ac­
curacy of ±(3 mm+5 ppm). The introduction of the DM503 extended the range 
further (to 2.5 km), provided a ppm correction facility, a user-accessible instru­
ment correction and a display range to 16 km for the first time. The latter was 
achieved by adding a second LF modulation frequency, differing from the first 
one by 1.5 kHz. This provides a coarse measuring unit length of 100 km when us­
ing the techniques discussed in Section 3.2.1.3. The accuracy improved to 
±(3mm+2ppm), most likely through the use of a temperature-compensated 
crystal oscillator (TCXO). The measuring time was reduced eventually to 6.5 s in 
1987 with the DM504 model, which also includes a distance averaging mode, a 
flexible 5-15 V supply voltage, a number of remote control options, a reduced 
power consumption and, in the case of the DM550, a zenith angle sensor.

tacheometer. The diagram shows the horizontal separation of the two EDM beams. The 
transmitted rays are emitted through the right hand side of the telescope and the reflected rays 
are collected through the left hand side
9.2.2 Topcon ET-1
The distance meter section of the Topcon ET-1 electronic tacheometer (released 
in 1984) may be discussed as a second representative of the group of electro-op­
tical short range distance meters. Here, the distance meter is fully integrated into 
an electronic theodolite, using the same telescope for angular and distance mea­
surements. Distances are measured by digital phase measurement at three dif­
ferent modulation frequencies. The optical lay-out and integration is shown in 
Fig. 9.2. The electronic circle reading and level sensor systems do not make use 
of the distance meter’s phase measurement capability. They are not discussed in 
this context [see Kondo (1985) for example]. The principle of the design is discuss­
ed below. Further details may be obtained from Hamada and Ohtomo (1981).
Figure 9.2 explains the optical parts of the distance meter section of the ET-1. 
The carrier wave is produced by a GaAlAs diode of 820 nm wavelength. The 
bandwidth (to half-power points) is about 50 nm. The GaAlAs diode is mounted 
on a printed circuit board and connected to the telescope by a glass fibre. The use 
of glass fibres reduces the effects of phase inhomogeneities of transmitting and 
receiving diodes. Through a chopper, one part of the transmitted beam reaches 
the reflecting part of a prism, which deflects the transmitted beam onto another 
infrared reflecting surface in the optical axis of the telescope. From there the 
transmitted beam reaches the objective lens and the reflector. The latter returns 
the beam through the objective onto the same infrared reflecting surface in the 
telescope axis. The return beam then reaches via the partially reflecting prism the 
end of a glass fibre after passing through an interference filter (820 nm) and a 
variable neutral density filter.
139

Fig. 9.3. Block diagram of the electronic circuitry of the distance meter section of the Topcon 
ET-1 electronic tacheometer
Another part of the transmitted beam (reference beam) travels through an un­
coated part of the deviating prism directly into the receiver. Two variable neutral 
density filters maintain a constant signal strength of the return and reference 
beams, respectively. The chopper operates in a sector of ±60° with a frequency 
of 4 Hz (FINE MODE). The transmitted beam has a width of 7 minutes of arc 
and exits through the bottom half of the ET1 (in face left). The top half of the 
telescope (focal length: 115 mm, fixed focus) receives the return beam. This con­
struction permits the use of small prisms, even on close range.
The interference filter is an optical band pass filter with a centre wavelength 
of 820 nm. It improves the signal-to-noise ratio of the receiver by preventing all 
other wavelengths (of ambient day light, scattered sun light) from reaching the 
photodiode. The neutral density filters (in the chopper windows as well as in the 
rotary filter) are necessary to reduce the large return signal strengths obtained on 
close range to levels experienced on long range, as the dynamic range of the elec­
tronic gain control (AGC in Fig. 9.3) is limited.
A temperature-compensated crystal oscillator (TCXO) serves as master 
oscillator. It runs at 14985437 Hz and features specifications of better than 
±5 ppm between -20 °C and +50 °C. The first frequency produces a unit length 
140

of 10 m, the f3 frequency one of 2000 m. The f5 frequency is used for the phase 
measurement. The ft frequency is used as the clock signal for the digital phase 
measurement, leading to 14985437/2997 = 200 x 25 = 5000 pulses per LF period. 
Two additional frequencies are required to mix the received frequencies down to 
about 3 KHz. One synthesizer (with a phase locked loop) produces the f2 fre­
quency being f2 = ft-f5. A second synthesizer (with phase locked loop) pro­
duces the f4 frequency where f4 = f3-f5. The f4 signal is also transmitted to 
resolve the multiples of 2000 m, by using the (f3 - f4) unit length of 5000 m.
The signal received by the (temperature stabilized) avalanche photodiode 
(APD) is mixed according to the received frequency, so that a LF of 2997 always 
results for phase measurement purposes:
ft —f2 = 2997 Hz
f3-f4 = 2997 Hz
f4 —f3 = (—)2997 Hz .
The automatic gain control (AGC) stabilizes the signal level for the phase mea­
surement. Additional filters will remove all frequencies other than the required 
f5-
The measuring sequence in the FINE measuring mode is as follows:
f4 EXT 400 X 
f4 INT 400x 
f3 EXT 400 X 
f3 INT 400 x 
ft EXT 400 X 
ft INT 400 x
2x (1.0 s)
2x (1.0 s)
4x (2.0 s)
A total of 1600 fine measurements are carried out.
The COARSE measurement sequence comprises, after an initial full FINE 
measurement:
f3 EXT 200 X 
f3 INT 200 X 
fi EXT 200 X 
ft INT 200 X
1X (0.25 s)
1X (0.25 s)
The on-board microprocessor checks the spread of the measurments and extends 
the measuring time if required.
9.2.3 Distomat Wild DI3000
The Distomat Wild DI 3000 is a representative of the growing number of pulsed 
infrared distance meters. The principle of the pulse method has already been dis­
cussed in Section 3.1.1. In the case of the DI 3000, the total flight time is obtained
141

as the sum of an integer number of periods of the time base and fractions of the 
time base period. This coarse and fine measurement of the flight time resembles 
to a certain degree the procedures used in phase measuring distance meters.
As Grimm et al. (1986 a, b) point out, pulse distance measurements offer a 
number of advantages when compared to phase distance measurements. Firstly, 
a single internal and external measurement is sufficient to derive a distance. No 
switching of modulation frequencies is required. Secondly, the range is markedly 
increased by the larger output power of the short laser pulses. Thirdly, some 
systematic errors of phase measuring distance meters (cross-talk between trans­
mitter and receiver) are directly eliminated and some others (multipath) by careful 
monitoring of (multiple) return pulses.
A simple block diagram of the DI 3000 is given in Fig. 9.4. The switching be­
tween the internal and external ray paths is carried out by the motor-driven shut­
ter. The internal and external paths are attenuated by a constant and a variable 
neutral density filter, respectively. Following a start command from the micropro­
cessor, the time measurement is commenced and an infrared pulse [of about 12 ns 
(or 3.5 m) widthj is emitted by the GaAs laser diode. The drive current of the laser 
diode of several 10 amperes is varied with temperature to ensure a constant power 
output over the specified temperature range (see Sect. 4.1.2.1).
After travelling over the internal or external light path, the pulse is focussed 
onto the avalanche photodiode (APD). The resulting current surge through the 
diode is not used directly to stop the time measurement. Instead, the power surge 
is used to generate a (sinx)/x wave in a parallel resonance circuit (Chaborski 
1978). The second crossover of this sine wave is largely unaffected by changes in 
the power, shape and width of the return pulse and, in consequence, used as a 
stop signal for the time measurement. The flight time measuring procedure is ex­
plained in more detail in Fig. 9.5.

Fig. 9.5. Principle of flight time measurement used by the Distomat Wild DI 3000. (Grimm et 
al. 1986a, b)
Before the display distance can be computed according to Eq. (3.1), and with 
consideration of a reference refractive index of 1.0002815, the flight time tm 
must be measured for the external as well as for the internal path. As indicated 
in Fig. 9.5, the total flight time is derived from three separate measurements. The 
term nT is easily obtained by counting the number of full cycles of the time base 
frequency of nominally 15 MHz between the start and the stop marks. The two 
fractions ta and tb of the time base period (of 66.66 ns) are determined by a fast 
analogue time interpolation procedure. The start pulse activates a constant cur­
rent charge cycle of a capacitor, leading to the voltage-versus-time ramp shown 
in Fig. 9.5. The first leading edge of the 15 MHz time base signal stops the charg­
ing of the capacitor. The voltage across the capacitor is then amplified and fed 
through an analogue to digital converter into the microprocessor. Use of the full 
voltage range of 10 V of the 12 bit A/D converter would lead to a resolution of 
2.4 mm of the time interpolation process. In order to minimize the effects of com­
ponent tolerances and temperature drifts, the voltage range of the A/D converter 
is not fully used. The effective resolution of the time-to-amplitude (TAC) con­
verter is about 4 mm. After completion of the first timing sweep, the capacitor 
is discharged and is then ready for the measurement of tb. In this case, the tim­
ing sweep is started by the stop pulse and terminated by the leading edge of the 
next time base signal.
Some of the finer details of the design are depicted in Fig. 9.6. The reference 
oscillator is a quartz crystal oscillator (most likely a TCXO), the frequency versus 
temperature characteristic of which is further improved (to better than 1 ppm) by 
factory calibration between -30 and +60 °C. During (frequency calibration and) 
distance measurements, the temperature of the oscillator is monitored by a ther­
mally coupled temperature sensor and used to correct the displayed distances. Two 
key components are explained in detail before discussing the operation of the dis­
tance meter as shown in Fig. 9.6.

Fig. 9.6. Diagram of the components of the flight time measurement circuit and their interac­
tions. (Giger 1983)
The digital delay is required to permit the execution of the timing sweep for 
ta before the return pulse arrives. An auxilliary oscillator, a counter and two 
gates form the delay circuit (Giger 1983). Upon receipt of a timing (or syn­
chronization) pulse, the counter starts accumulation of pulses of the auxilliary 
oscillator. After reaching a first predetermined number of pulses, a first gate 
Reading to the time interpolator) is activated. The next pulse of the auxilliary 
oscillator then starts the ta measurement. After reaching a second predetermined 
number of pulses of the auxilliary oscillator, a second gate (leading to the laser 
diode driver) is activated. The next pulse of the auxilliary oscillator then activates 
the laser driver and the emission of the IR pulse. The delay between the start of 
the time measurement and the emission of the pulse will be as constant as the aux­
illiary oscillator. Depending on the latter, it will be the same for the measurements 
of the internal and external paths.
The calibration circuit is used to calibrate the slope of the timing ramp of the 
time interpolator. Prior to a distance measurement, the signal of the reference 
oscillator is used to generate well-defined start and stop pulses. The resulting time 
interpolation values are sent to the microprocessor for the purpose of the correc­
tion of subsequent time interpolation measurements. The effect of the small non­
linearities of the timing ramp (10-20 mm) are minimized by multiple time inter­
polation measurements with variation of the ta and thus tb, over the full period 
T of the reference oscillator. The variation of ta is achieved by synchronizing the 
timing pulse generator with the auxilliary oscillator of the digital delay (rather 
than with the reference oscillator) and by control of the auxilliary oscillator by 
the microprocessor.
Following Giger (1983) and Fig. 9.6, the measurement of a single distance may 
now be discussed as follows. With the shutter set appropriately, the internal path 
144

is measured first. After requesting a distance measurement, the calibration circuit 
is activated and the resulting calibration values of the timing ramp slope are 
stored in the microprocessor. The timing pulse generator is activated next. It has 
a pulse repetition rate of about 2 kHz. Each timing pulse initiates a distance mea­
surement. The timing pulse resets the coarse measurement counter to zero and 
triggers the digital delay circuit. This in turn starts the time interpolation circuit, 
and, later, the emission of the laser pulse. The first time interpolation measure­
ment (ta) is stopped and the coarse measurement counter started by the next 
leading edge of the reference signal. The return pulse triggers the resonance circuit 
of the photodiode. The stop signal is derived from the second crossover of the 
damped oscillation and used to start the second time interpolation. The edge 
detector is also triggered by the stop signal and enables the leading edge of the 
next reference oscillator signal to stop the coarse measurement counter as well as 
the second time interpolation measurement (tb). The coarse and both fine mea­
surements are stored in the processor, and averaged after the required number of 
repeat measurements.
The external light path is then opened by the shutter and the procedure 
repeated for the external path. Again, repeat measurements are taken and aver­
aged by the processor. Finally, the internal light path is again enabled by the shut­
ter for a second set of internal measurements. [This second internal measurement 
permits the elimination of linear drifts (with time) of the electronic circuits.] The 
two sets of internal measurements are meaned and then subtracted from the mean 
of the external measurements. The display distance is derived by using Eq. (3.1) 
and the reference refractive index given above.
9.2.4 Kern Mekometer ME5000
The Kern Mekometer ME 5000 differs markedly from the previously discussed in­
struments. It uses a HeNe laser as light source and, in consequence, the classical 
principle of indirect modulation. The short unit length of about 0.3 m is the same 
as with the earlier Kern Mekometer ME 3000 and the Com-Rad Geomensor 
204DME and follows from the high modulation frequency of 500 MHz. Rather 
than measure the phase difference between transmitted and received signals (as 
with the ME 3000, Sect. 4.1.3.1), the modulation frequency is changed until a zero 
phase difference results (similar to the Geomensor 204DME, but fully auto­
matic). The distance can then be calculated according to the equations given in 
Section 3.2.1.4.
Following Meier and Loser (1986), the operating principle of the Mekometer 
ME 5000 may be briefly described. Linearly polarized light at a wavelength of 
632.8 nm is emitted continuously by the HeNe laser and travels through an at­
tenuator and (unaffected) through the beam splitter of parallel polarization into 
the (unspecified) modulating crystal. In the modulator, the polarization of the 
laser beam is modulated at the frequency (about 500 MHz) provided by the fre­
quency synthesizer. The latter is based on a quartz crystal oscillator with an ac­
curacy specification of better than ±0.3 ppm between -10 and +40 °C. The 
emerging beam then travels through a quarter wavelength path, a beam expander

and a diaphragm to the reflector. The quarter wavelength plate is used to remove 
the effects of the temperature dependency of the polarization modulation of the 
modulating crystal (Meier and Loser 1988). The return beam travels on the same 
axis through the now collimating beam expander, through the quarter wavelength 
plate into the now demodulating crystal. No light will fall onto the photodiode 
whenever the transmitted and received signals are in phase or, in other words, 
whenever the measured distance is an exact multiple of the unit length of about 
0.3 m.
A technique similar to the earlier Mekometer ME 3000 is used to improve the 
resolution of the zero phase which would be given otherwise by the minimum of 
the photodiode current. The modulation signal is frequency modulated by the 
wobbler at a rate of 2 kHz and with frequency offsets of ±5 kHz (for distances 
larger than 500 m) or ±25 kHz (for distances shorter than 500 m), depending on 
the range knob setting. In the case of the transmitted and received signals being 
in phase, the photodiode will receive light pulses of equal intensity at a rate of 
4 kHz. If the two signals are not in phase, the 4 kHz pattern recorded by the 
photodiode will exhibit a saw-tooth pattern, with the odd and even pulses having 
different amplitudes. This amplitude difference is measured by the lock-in 
amplifier and passed on to the controller through the analogue-to-digital (A/D) 
146

converter. In turn, the controller will shift the synthesized frequency in steps of 
160 Hz or 0.3 ppm until the transmitted and received signals are in phase and the 
amplitude of the 4 kHz signal on the photodiode constant.
The A/D converter also feeds the signal strength display of the ME 5000. Mea­
surements are interrupted whenever the amplitude of the 4 kHz signal on the 
photodiode falls below a critical level. The attenuator and the diaphragm are ac­
tivated during the measurement of short distances so that the photodiode is not 
overloaded. The instrument can be operated in two ways, either with the on-board 
controls or with an external computer through the RS-232 compatible com­
munication port. The distances are derived according to the routine discussed in 
Section 3.2.1.4 and displayed to 0.1 mm. The displayed distance values are based 
on a reference refractive index of 1.000284514844.
The built-in frequency synthesizer has a range of 30 MHz, 15 Mhz of which 
are utilized by the on-board measuring routine. Considering the differences of the 
modulation frequency for adjacent phase minima at different distances [see Eq. 
(3.24)], the following number of phase minima are available in the 15 MHz range:

The requirement for a minimum of two independent distance measurements 
restricts the minimum range of the ME 5000 usually to 20 m. When operating the 
ME 5000 from an external computer and with additional input of approximate 
distances, the minimum range can be reduced to about 5 m (Maurer et al. 1988). 
Similarly, the upper range of normally 8 km can be extended by operation from 
an external computer and using least-squares techniques for the resolution of the 
“ambiguities”. A successful distance measurement of 17 km was reported by 
Maurer et al. (1988). The same authors quote the resolution of the ME 5000 as 
±0.03 mm.

10 Reflectors
10.1 Introduction
Apart from military laser rangers, electro-optical EDM instruments need a device 
at the target station which reflects the light (or infrared) beam back to the instru­
ment. Reflecting devices should have the following properties:
1. good reflectivity
2. complete illumination of the receiver optics of the instrument
3. no change direction of emerging rays through small movements of the reflect­
ing device, thus rendering a continuous alignment unnecessary.
Such devices are:
1. plane front surface mirror
2. spherical reflector
3. solid glass prism reflector (corner cube reflector)
4. hollow corner cube reflector
5. acrylic retroreflector
6. reflective sheeting.
Plane front surface mirrors were used in conjunction with the Geodimeter 
NASM2. Although they had the best reflective properties, their use was soon 
discontinued because of the requirements for a very stable and precise alignment. 
Spherical reflectors allow for a misalignment of ±30 minutes of arc and consist 
basically of a spherical mirror and a small plane mirror in its focal point. Their 
reflectivity (65%) is much smaller than that of the plane mirrors (90%) due to 
the greater number of reflections involved. Spherical reflectors were used in con­
junction with early Geodimeter models. Glass prism reflectors have proved to be 
the most suitable reflector system. They were first employed by the U.S. Army 
Map Service in 1953 (Rinner and Benz 1966) and are now almost exclusively used 
in terrestrial EDM as well as in satellite and lunar laser ranging (see Sect. 3.1.2). 
They are discussed in more detail in Section 10.2.
Hollow corner cubes operate on the same principle as the solid corner cubes 
discussed in Section 10.2. Three plane front surface mirrors are assembled at right 
angles to each other. Hollow corner cube reflectors are lighter than ordinary solid 
prism and adapt more quickly to changes in temperature. Coating may be 
aluminium or gold (for IR reflection). Typical diameters are 25 mm and 63 mm. 
The reflecting faces may become dirty as they are exposed to the elements. The 
coating of the plane mirrors may be subject to corrosion, particularly in humid 
climates, and may be scratched in the process of cleaning. Hollow corner cube 
reflectors are not necessarily cheaper than solid corner cube reflectors, if a high

distances could have been measured, and asterics that some 10 m errors were recorded on close

sonite acrylic retroreflector, clear, 28 mm diameter; Reflector D: red road delineator acrylic 
retroreflector, 77 mm diameter; Reflector E (for comparison): small glass prism reflector, 
25 mm diameter of aperture
accuracy of the 90 degree angle is required. The reflectivity depends on the type 
and the cleanliness of the reflective coating. The reflectivity of clean open corner 
cube reflectors may be estimated with 94% and 65% for gold and aluminium 
coatings, respectively.
Acrylic retroreflectors consist of arrays of small corner cubes, with each cube 
having typically a diameter of 2 mm. Such retroreflectors are commonly used for 
road traffic control purposes such as road delineators (red, yellow or white, 
85 mm diameter), sign buttons (white, diameters between 13 and 41 mm) and 
vehicle reflectors. Although they have a very much smaller reflectivity than glass 
prism reflectors, they may permit distance measurements on close range. They 
may be used as disposable and/or permanent reflectors for setting out and for 
displacement monitoring applications. Because of the small aperture of the in­
dividual corner cubes, the usable range will not depend solely on the output 
power of the distance meter but also on the separation between the transmitter 
and receiver. The first criterion affects the upper limit of the range, the second 
the lower limit. Maximum distances in excess of 1 km have been reported for 
HeNe laser instruments (Geodimeter 600, 1500 m). Table 10.1 gives the working 
ranges for some infrared distance meters. Red retroreflectors perform best in con­
nection with infrared distance meters. Further details on the use of acrylic reflec­
tors may be found in Johnson (1981), Kennie (1983) and Riieger (1989).
Reflective sheeting (or tape) is an even cheaper alternative to glass prisms. It 
is offered in basically three versions by the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing 
(3M) Company under the tradename of Scotchlite. The “flat-top wide angle 
reflective sheeting” has a layer of glass beads embedded in a durable transparent 
149

plastic and a metallic reflector coating underneath. The high intensity grade (en­
capsulated lens) sheeting is normally used for traffic signs and features a layer of 
glass beads, which is partially embedded in a plastic resin, and an enclosed air 
space above the beads. The transparent top film is supported by walls in a 
honeycomb pattern. The diamond grade cube corner sheeting replaces the glass 
beads with a plastic corner cube pattern sealed in a hexagonal pattern. Reflective 
sheeting is self-adhesive and may be attached to walls as temporary reference 
marks for setting out or displacement monitoring surveys. The usable range is 
governed by the reduced reflectivity as well as the small size of the glass beads 
of, say, 0.25 mm. Table 10.1 gives an indication of the practical working range of 
infrared distance meters with reflecting tape. Maximum ranges of about 200 m 
have been reported for HeNe laser instruments. A detailed description of reflec­
tive sheeting was given by Kennie (1983).
10.2 Glass Prism Reflectors
These common reflectors consist of a corner of a glass cube which was cut in such 
a way that the plane of the cut is perpendicular to the cube diagonal (equilateral 
cube corner). It can be shown that if the angles between the cube planes are exact­
ly equal to 90 degrees, all incident rays are reflected in such a way that incident 
and emerging rays are exactly parallel and symmetrical to the centre ray (ray to 
the prism corner), independent of the alignment of the reflector. The ray path 
through a prism is depicted in Fig. 10.1. The figure shows clearly that all rays are 
refracted two times at the front surface of the prism and reflected three times in­
ternally on the perpendicular prism faces.
The alignment of the prism has an effect on the effective aperture of the 
reflector and therefore on the retro-reflected radiant power. Figure 10.2 shows 
how the effective aperture Aeff expressed as a percentage of the aperture A varies 
with the angle of incidence a for a prism of circular aperture and a refractive in­
dex of 1.5.
The reflecting faces of the glass prisms are either uncoated or coated. In the 
former case, the rays are reflected by total internal reflection as long as their 
angles of incidence (on the reflecting faces) exceed the critical angle of 41.1 
degrees. It can be shown that the rays must enter the prism within a Y-shaped area 
around the centre of the aperture in order the meet the critical angle on the re­
flecting surfaces (Arnold 1979). As long as the reflecting faces are perfectly clean, 
no power is lost by the three total internal reflections. (It should be noted that 
fingerprints on the surfaces can cause loss of the total internal reflection.) Some 
power is, however, lost due to reflection on the front face and absorption inside 
the glass. Under the assumptions that the acceptance angle limitations are fulfiled 
(all input rays enter through the Y-shaped area defined above), the reflectivity of 
uncoated prisms may be estimated as 90-95%. Unpolarized input beams become 
partially polarized by the total internal reflection. Polarized incident beams have 
their polarization changed, depending on which of the six sectors (defined by the 
three real edges and their three reflected images) the beam enters and exits. Chang 
et al. (1971) demonstrated that the far-field diffraction pattern of the exiting

of the centre ray. Points and P5 indicate the same two points for an eccentric ray. The eccen­

beam of original polarization (same polarization as incident beam) differs 
markedly from that of the orthogonal polarization. This aspect would be of par­
ticular relevance to distance meters using polarization modulation.
Most EDM prisms have coated back faces and carry an anti-reflex coating on 
the front face. No acceptance angle limitations apply as no critical angles must 
be met on the reflecting surfaces. The coating of the reflecting faces may be silver, 
copper or gold, which all perform very well at infrared wavelengths. The quoted 
reflectivities of silver-coated prisms vary considerably from about 70% (Rinner 
and Benz 1966) to < 92% (Chang et al. 1971). The reflectivity depends heavily 
on the actual reflective and anti-reflex coatings as well as on the absorption losses 
in the glass. Coated prisms do not introduce additional polarizations. However, 
polarized light will be changed in amplitude and phase depending on the coating, 
the angle of incidence and the azimuth of incidence. Considering the real edges 
and their images in a prism, six sectors can be distinguished. Changes in polariza­
tion depend on the sector, onto which the incident EDM beam falls (Chang et al. 
1971). The effects must be considered for prisms used in connection with distance 
meter using polarization modulation. The orientation of prisms may have to be 
specified in such cases. (In the case of the Terrameter LDM-2, the problem is 
avoided altogether by using spherical reflectors.)
At the front face of the prism, about 4% of the beam is reflected (rather than 
refracted) each time it enters or exits the glass corner cube. The beam, which is 
reflected at the time of exit, travels again through the prism before exiting. The 
strength of this multiple reflection beam is small (0.16%) and unlikely to cause 
significant distance measurement errors. The beam reflected at the time of enter­
ing the prism is returned to the distance meter at normal incidence. This case of 
the front face of the prism being perfectly normal to the incident EDM beam will 
apply on rare occasions, and thus affect the distance measurements. The problem 
can be reduced by antireflex coating of the front face of the prism or by mounting 
the prism at a slight tilt against the prism case.
Two principles are followed by manufacturers (more or less rigorously) when 
mounting the glass prisms inside the reflector housing. Minimizing the reflector 
constant leads to so-called zero error prisms. Alternatively, the distance and 
angular errors caused by poorly pointed prisms can be minimized by mounting 
the prisms in such a way that their “optical centres” coincide with the mechanical 
vertical and horizontal reflector axes (Peck 1948). The absolute reflector con­
stants of such prisms amount typically to a few centimetres (e.g. 30 mm prisms). 
In connection with electronic tacheometers, the second design is to be preferred, 
because angular pointings are usually carried out to the refracted image of the 
apex of the glass prism. The errors caused by misaligned prisms will be discussed 
in detail in Sections 10.2.5.2 and 10.2.5.3.
10.2.1 Accuracy of Reflectors
Glass prism reflectors may be classified according to their accuracy and their 
shape. The accuracy of a prism may be defined in terms of the maximum devia­
tion of the angle between its faces from the ideal theoretical angle of exactly 90° 
152

and the maximum deviation of its faces from an ideal plane. The old AGA long 
range prisms were ground to 2 seconds of arc maximum deviation from a true 
right angle and the old Aga short range prisms only to 20 seconds (AGA 1975). 
The facing of Keuffel and Esser prisms is true within ±546 nm and is at right 
angles within 4 seconds of arc (Keuffel and Esser 1976).
Prisms are costly. For example, the cost of single prism reflectors is between 
6 and 14% of the price of the EDM instrument. It is therefore wise to be perfectly 
clear about the required range, accuracy and number before ordering them. Their 
performance is checked by manufacturers through inspecting interference pat­
terns in an interferometer (Hewlett-Packard 1973).
10.2.2 Shape and Size of Reflectors
The shape of the reflectors is determined in advance by the relative position of 
the transmitter and receiver optics of the corresponding EDM instrument because 
it is required that the return beam always fully illuminates the receiver optics. 
EDM instruments with coaxial transmitter and receiver optics require reflectors 
with a circular aperture; instruments with parallel but separated transmitter and 
receiver optics need, in principle, prisms with a rectangular aperture to displace 
the rays at the reflector by an offset equal to that of the two instrument optics. 
Reflectors of rectangular aperture are used in conjunction with the following in­
struments: Wild DI 3, DI3S, Kern DM500, DM501, and Keuffel & Esser 
Autoranger. It may be mentioned that differing solutions were adopted for the 
prisms of earlier Geodimeters (models 2, 3, 4). The prisms were either ground to 
an angle larger than 90° or were fitted with a special wedge in front of the prism 
to spread the beam in order to reach the eccentric receiver optics.
The reflector’s size is determined by the diameter of transmitter and receiver 
optics and by the requirement that the receiver optics must always be fully il­
luminated by the reflected beam. For an instrument with coaxial optics it can be 
easily proved that
4>b = <t>r+2(|)p , 
(10.1)
where (|)B is the diameter of the return beam at the receiver, (|)T the diameter of 
the transmitter optics and <J>P the diameter of the reflector’s aperture. Denoting 
the diameter of the receiver optics by 0R the above condition may be written in 
the form:
<t>R . 
(10.2)
The minimal reflector diameter may then be computed as
*p = t(I«I>r-<I>tI) • 
(10.3)
The actual diameter of reflectors is usually larger than the minimal value given 
in Eq. (10.3), thus increasing the radiant power of the return signal.
The more common case of parallel transmitter and receiver axis is depicted in 
Fig. 10.3. This case applies also to all fully integrated tacheometers, where the

telescope is shared (two 180 degrees sectors) by the transmited and received beams 
and where the eccentricity, e, does not exceed a few millimetres. On close range, 
the ideal diameter of the prism is given by
0P = (|>r + (|)r+e , 
(10.4)
where all the parameters are defined in Fig. 10.3. At longer distances, where the 
beam divergence exceeds 20P/D, the minimum prism diameter computes as
(|)p = (|)R+e . 
(10.5)
It further follows from the solid rays in Fig. 10.3, that the diameter of the smallest 
possible prism to return any part of the transmitted beam must exceed the eccen­
tricity e of the optics. This consideration explains why some distance meters can­
not measure to reflective tapes and acrylic reflectors on close range. The problem 
is reduced to a certain degree by the large divergence of these inexpensive reflec­
tors. Table 10.1 gives experimental values for these cases.
EDM instruments with separate transmitter and receiver optics and relatively 
large eccentricities e may use reflectors with rectangular apertures. Assuming 
equal diameters of transmitter and receiver, such a prism would have widths of 
(|)T and lengths of between 0T+e and 2(j>T+e.

10.2.3 Phase and Group Refractive Index in Glass
Prisms used in EDM are usually made of BK7 optical glass. The phase refractive 
index of BK7 may be computed from the dispersion formula (Melies Griot 1975): 
nGp^ = Aq+A^ X2+A2 A. 2+A3X 4+A4% 64-A5X * 
(10.6)
with the constants Aq= 2.2718929

A2= +1.0592509X10-2
A3 = +2.0816965X10-4

A5= +4.924099lx 10-7 ,
where nGph = phase refractive index in optical glass BK7
X = wavelength of carrier wave of EDM instrument (pm).
The dispersion formula (10.6) is accurate to ±5 ppm in the spectral region be­
tween 365 nm and 1014 nm.
Because of the EDM ray being modulated, the group refractive index accord­
ing to Eq. (5.11) has to be considered:
dnG
nG = nGph-—(10.7)
Differentiation of Eq. (10.6) provides the differential in Eq. (10.7). The group 
refractive index in BK7 optical glass therefore yields:
nG = nG —— (AiX2-A2V2-2A3V4-3A4V6-4A5V8) ,

The phase and group refractive indices of glass are listed in Table 10.2 for some 
wavelengths commonly used in EDM. Only group refractive indices should be 
considered in EDM applications.
10.2.4 Reflector Constant
If only one particular type of reflector is used in conjunction with a particular 
EDM instrument, the reflector constant is combined with the additive constant 
for the EDM instrument. The determination of this combined constant is de­
scribed in Sections 13.2.4.3 and 13.2.4.4.
Various type of reflectors may be employed if their relative or absolute con­
stants are determined. The relative reflector constant may be determined by 
measuring a large number of different distances with all reflectors. The mean dif­
ferences of distances using two reflectors is a measure of the relative reflector con­
stant. In practice, relative constants are usually computed in relation to one 
specified reflector (reference reflector). The absolute reflector constant, which 
refers to the vertical axis of a reflector, may be worked out from the known or 
measured dimensions of a reflector. Technical data of a selection of reflectors is 
given in Appendix H. Figure 10.4 illustrates the situation.
The first velocity correction of a distance measurement assumes that the EDM 
beam travels in air between instrument, reflector and instrument. In consequence, 
the glass path (a) needs to be reduced to the equivalent air path.

where a is the height of the cube corner above the front surface, nG the group 
refractive index of light in glass, nA the group refractive index of light in air and 
b the distance between the front surface of reflector and the vertical axis of reflec­
tor assembly. The refractive index of glass prisms depends on the type of glass 
and the carrier wave (dispersion). The group refractive index of glass has been 
discussed in the previous section. A table of reflector-specific a and b is given in 
Appendix H.
The reflector constant should be added to the distance measurement to obtain 
the corrected distance. It follows from Fig. 10.4 that it is possible to build so- 
called zero constant prisms which can be fixed on ranging rods. The front surface 
of the reflector is then at a distance of (nG/nA)a from the centre line of the rang­
ing rod (zero of prism).
The method of measuring absolute reflector constants can also be used to 
derive relative constants. The reflector constants of several reflectors of the same 
design and brand can be expected to be within a range of ± 1 mm (Hewlett- 
Packard 1973), although worse results were reported for old AGA prisms and one 
make of newer prisms (McLean 1984).

Example: Computation of Relative Reflector Constant.
An instrument Zeiss SM4 was calibrated using a prism Zeiss TR2. What 
relative reflector constant would have to be applied, if the SM4 was used in con­
junction with a Kern DM501 reflector?
From Appendix H:
Zeiss Reflector TR2
Kern DM501 Reflector
a = 40 mm , b = 27 mm
a = 81 mm , b = 34.5 mm
From Appendix D:
%carr of SM4 = 910nm
Uref — 1.0003 — nA
With the group refractive index of glass taken as 1.523, the Absolute Reflector 
Constants (A.R.C.) for the two reflectors compute as:
(
1 523
—-----40-27} = -33.9 mm
1.000 
)
(1 523
Kern Reflector: A.R.C. = - ]------ 81-34.5 = -88.9 mm
(1.000 
)
The ARC of -33.9 mm is already taken into account by the additive constant of 
the SM4, as the Zeiss prism was employed during calibration. The additional ad­
ditive constant to be applied if the Zeiss SM4 is used with the Kern DM501 reflec­
tor amounts to
Relative Reflector Constant (R.R.C.) = -88.9-(-33.9) = -55.0 mm
Another way of solving the problem would be to recalibrate the EDM instrument 
with the Kern prism on the baseline!
10.2.5 Effects of Errors of Reflector Alignment
10.2.5.1 Tiltable Reflector-Target with Eccentric Prism(s)
It was mentioned in Section 9.1.3.4 that several telescope-mounted instruments 
employ reflector-target combinations which compensate for the offset between 
telescope and distance meter. The horizontal axis of such reflector-targets is 
usually located through the centre of the target. Any erroneous vertical pointing 
of the reflector-target leads to a small error in the measured distance. The effect 
on distance of an error in vertical pointing a together with an eccentricity e of 
the reflector centre from the tilting axis may be written as follows:
Ad = e sin a , 
(10.14)
where Ad is the error in distance and a is given in degrees. An angle a of 5° and 
an eccentricity e of 45 mm (Wild DI 3) would lead to a distance error of 4 mm. 
It can be seen that reflectors need to be aligned carefully in cases where the axis 
of the prism has an eccentricity relative to the tilting axis of the reflector-target.

Fig. 10.5. Change of point of incidence of the central ray between a properly aligned and a tilted 
solid corner cube reflector. The apex of the prism is denoted by C and the point of rotation 
(vertical and/or horizontal axis) by R. The distance II" is a measure of the angular errors incur­
red when measuring angles to the refracted image of the prism corner. The distance errors can 
be derived from a comparison of the distances I" to Co and Z to C
10.2.5.2 Effect of the Reflector's Alignment on Measured Distance
Another effect of inaccurate alignment, which affects all prisms whether they are 
tiltable or not, is that the EDM rays travel a longer distance within the glass of 
the prism if the prism’s front surface is not exactly perpendicular to the EDM 
rays. Because of the different refractive indices of glass and air a different distance 
is then measured. The situation is depicted in Fig. 10.5, where the broken lines 
depict a properly aligned prism and the solid lines a misaligned prism.
The corner of the aligned prism is denoted by Co and that of the misaligned 
one by C. The point of incidence of the EDM ray which travels to the prism cor­
ner Co and back is termed Io and that of the ray which proceeds to the prism cor­
ner C (and back) is denoted by I. Only the corner rays are considered because they 
allow a two-dimensional solution of the problem. The final statement, however, 
holds for all rays in the three-dimensional case.
The vertical or horizontal axis is denoted by R and the dimension of the reflec­
tor and its relationship to the axis are given by the parameters a and b. The angle 
of incidence aA and the angle of refraction aG refer to the maladjusted prism 
(A = air, G = glass). The corresponding angles in the case of the correctly aligned 
prism are zero.
The of refraction is defined by the formula
= 
(10.15)
nG sin aA
It permits the computation of the unknown angle of refraction aG for a given 
angle of incidence aA, equal to the error angle in alignment, as
159

aG = arc sin ( — sin aA ) . 
(10.16)
\nG /
In order to compare the distance measurements in the cases of an aligned and a 
deflected prism, the measured lengths I"C0 and IC are compared. Considering 
the appropriate refractive indices the difference Ad between the measured 
distances to the aligned and the deflected prisms amounts to
Ad = I"Io + (IoCo) —-(IC) — . 
nA nA
(10.17)
If Ad is added to the distance measured to the deflected prism, the correct dis­
tance, equal to the distance measured to the aligned prism, is obtained. In Eq. 
(10.17), the refractive indices of glass and air are denoted by nG and nA, respec­
tively.
The line elements in Eq. (10.17) may be derived from Fig. 10.5 as
IC =asecaG 
(10.18)
IC' = ICcos(aA-aG)
= asec aG cos (aA - aG) 
(10.19)
RC" = (a-b) cos aA 
(10.20)
I"I0 = IC'-RC"-b
= asecaGcos(aA-aG)-(a-b)cosaA-b . 
(10.21)
Substitution of Eqs. (10.18) and (10.21) in Eq. (10.17) yields

Ad = a (n - ]/n2 - sin2 a) - b (1 -cos a) , 
(10.26)
where n is defined as the quotient (nG/nA) of the group refractive indices of glass 
and air and a as the angle of incidence. The distance correction Ad for misaligned 
prisms given in Eq. (10.26) is equivalent to the formulae given by Pauli (1969, 
1973) and Heister (1988). It can be seen that the possible errors in distance depend 
largely on the size of the prism and on the position of the vertical or horizontal 
axis (R) in relation to the prism.
According to Peck (1948), the distance correction can be minimized by the 
reflector manufacturer for small angles of incidence by selecting
b = anA/nG 
(10.27)
or, considering a previous substitution [Eq. (10.23)],
b = a/n . 
(10.28)
It can be shown that substitution of the above equation in Eq. (10.26) leads to 
the following distance correction equation (Heister 1988)
Ad = an(l-cosP)-a(l-cosa)/n , 
(10.29)
where P is the angle of refraction aG. It should be noted that Eq. (10.29) applies 
only to prisms which have their tilting and rotation axis in the “optical centre” 
as defined by Eq. (10.27). Normally, either Eq. (10.22) or Eq. (10.26) has to be 
used.
A numerical example may illustrate the magnitude of the error in distance Ad 
caused by the misalignment of the reflector. The following parameters are as­
sumed (Wild GDR11 reflector):
a
= 60 mm
nA = 1.00
b
= 22 mm
nG = 1.52 (X = 900 nm)
«A = 1°
Ad = 0.00 mm

= 0.07 mm
= 10°
= 0.26 mm
= 15°
= 0.58 mm
= 20°
= 1.01 mm
= 25°
- 1.53 mm
= 30°
= 2.13 mm
161

An alignment of the reflector to ±15° will lead to a maximum error in distance 
of only 0.5 mm (Wild reflector GDR11). The alignment of a centrally supported 
reflector is therefore not critical at all with regard to the distance measurement. 
See Section 10.2.5.1 for additional errors of eccentrically supported prisms and 
Appendix H for technical data of other reflectors. Numerical examples for other 
reflector types may be found in Riieger (1978 a) and Heister (1988).
10.2.5,3 Effect of the Reflector's Alignment on Angular Measurement
The corner of a prism is sometimes used as a target for the measurement of zenith 
angles and horizontal directions. Because the prism corner is observed through 
the glass, the ray is refracted at the incident plane of the prism, if the reflector 
is not exactly aligned. As can be seen from Fig. 10.5, the image of C appears in 
I, which has an offset of II" from the true direction to the axis of the reflector R.
Considering Eqs. (10.16) and (10.18) of the previous section and inspection of 
Fig. 10.5 lead to
II" =CC"-CC' 
(10.30)
CO = ICsin(aA~aG)
= a sec aG sin (aA - aG) 
(10.31)
CC" = (a-b) sin aA . 
(10.32)
The displacement of the ray is then given by:
II" = (a-b)sinaA-asecaGsin(aA-aG) , 
(10.33)
where the angle of refraction aG is computed according to Eq. (10.16):
. /nA . 
\
aG = arc sm i — sm aA I .
\nG /
The displacement II" produces the following error Az in a zenith angle measured 
at the EDM instrument station or Aa in a measured direction:
II"
Az" (or Aa") =-----------
dsin(l")
= (a-b) sin qA-a sec aG sin (aA- aG) 
(10 34)
dsin(l")
where aA is the vertical or horizontal misalignment of the reflector and d the dis­
tance between EDM instrument and reflector. The effects of the misalignment of 
the reflector on angular measurements taken to the refracted image of the prism’s 
apex can again be minimized by the manufacturer of the reflector by selecting b 
according to Eqs. (10.27) or (10.28).
Table 10.3 gives a numerical example of the magnitude of angular errors incur­
red when pointing to a misaligned prism. The selected reflector type does almost 
fulfil the relationship of Eqs. (10.27) and (10.28), namely that the reflector rotates

The prism parameters are taken from Appendix H as a = 41 mm, b = 35 mm, 
nA = 1.00 and nG = 1.52 (from Table 10.2, for % = 900 nm). The angles of 
incidence (for misalignment) and refraction are denoted by aA and aG 
respectively. The length IT' indicates the shift of the apex image caused by 
the rotation or tilt of the prism
about its “optical centre” (Peck 1948). Experiments have shown that the reflector 
in question can be pointed in the horizontal direction with an accuracy of about 
±40 minutes of arc (Riieger 1978a). The resulting errors in measured directions 
are therefore minimal. As the particular type of reflector is not tiltable, zenith 
angle measurements (z) are heavily affected as aA = 90°-z.
Table 10.3 indicates clearly that, for example, the cube corner of a non-tiltable 
AGA reflector (old type) should not be used as theodolite target if accurate zenith 
angle observations are required over short ranges. Angular errors caused by the 
misalignment of other types of reflectors may be computed using Eq. (10.34). The 
technical data of some reflectors are given in Appendix H. Further numerical ex­
amples may be found in Riieger (1978 a), for example.
In order to avoid the problems involved in theodolite pointings to cube corners 
of reflectors, many reflectors are equipped with additional targets for angular 
measurements. However, additional eccentricities may affect the angular measure­
ments unless such targets are strictly in the tilting axis and in the vertical axis for 
zenith angle and horizontal direction measurements, respectively.
10.2.6 Temperature Effects
The reflectivity of a reflector is only optimal if its entire glass mass has the same 
temperature. Unequal temperature distribution in the prism causes deformations 
of the faces and thus divergence of the emerging beam. Prisms need 1 h or more 
to adapt to a new temperature after a change in ambient temperature (Dalcher 
1975). Naturally, the larger the prism the longer it will take to settle down in new 
temperature conditions. If distances at the upper limit of the range of an EDM 
instrument and its reflectors are attempted, it may be advisable to shade not only 
163

the instrument but also the reflector and to expose the reflector to (shade) field 
temperatures well before the measurement.
10.2.7 Care of Reflectors
Basically, reflectors should be treated with the same care as theodolites. Wet or 
dusty surfaces should be cleaned with a soft cloth, avoiding any scratching of the 
glass surface. Wet prisms should be allowed to dry before they are stored. Finger­
prints on the glass should be avoided, but may be cleaned with a soft cloth 
dampened with ether or alcohol.
During measurements in rain or snow, the reflector should be protected to 
avoid water drops on the front surface of the prism. Water drops on the plane 
of incidence of the prism decrease the reflectivity and thus the range of the EDM 
instrument. In wet conditions the front surface of the reflector may also be 
treated with an “antimist” towel or covered with a thin soap layer to produce a 
thin layer of water rather than water drops (AGA 1969).

11 Batteries and Other Power Sources
11.1 Review of Power Sources
Power sources are very important in electronic distance measurement as no power 
means no distance measurements. The most common types of power sources are: 
1. batteries 
2. solar cells 
3. generators
4. mains-operated DC power supplies.
Batteries are by far the most common power sources in EDM. They are discussed 
in the next section in more detail. Usually, batteries are also employed in connec­
tion with solar cells and generators, where the latter are used to charge the bat­
teries or to operate the EDM instrument through an intermediate battery.
Commercial panels of photovoltaic (solar) cells are usually made of semi­
crystalline silicon (Si). The voltage of each cell is about 0.5 V, irrespective of light 
intensity or size. The current output of solar cells is proportional to light intensity 
and size. The voltage is increased by placing cells in series. The output current can 
be increased by connecting cells in parallel. A single solar cell panel of 1.0 by 
0.5 m may, for example, produce 2.6 A at 16.2 V at peak power (42 W). This would 
be sufficient to operate most infrared short range distance meters. Typically, solar 
cells would not supply EDM instruments directly but rather charge their batteries, 
either concurrently with distance measurements or off-line, while a second battery 
powers the distance meter. Figure 11.1 shows the wiring and components required 
for the former case. To prevent the battery from discharging through the solar 
cells (at night, for example), a blocking diode must be put in series with the 
positive line. The charge controller is required to protect the battery from ex­
tended overcharging. Charge controllers or regulators are usually supplied by the 
manufacturers of solar panels. Some suitable circuits may be found in Byers 
(1984).
In EDM, solar panels are of interest whenever overnight charging from mains 
supply is not possible. Such cases might arise when surveying in remote locations. 
Solar panel back-up might also be of interest in certain monitoring surveys where 
continuous measurements are carried out over days and weeks. The required 
power output may be computed as follows (Solarex 1986):
Solar system peak output > (Ah/day+system loss)/peak sun hours , (11.1) 
where the peak output is taken in amperes (A), the system loss as 20% and 40% 
for lead-acid and nickel-cadmium batteries, respectively, and the peak sun hours 
from diagrams published by solar cell manufacturers. Solarex (1986) suggests the
165

BLOCKING
Fig. 11.1. Wiring diagram of a solar panel used to charge the EDM instrument’s battery during 
EDM operation. (After Byers 1984)
following peak sun hours per day (yearly average): Sydney (Australia) 5.5, Alice 
Springs (Australia) 6.5, Central Europe 3.65; Alaska 2.75. Considering the solar 
panel mentioned above (2.6 A), a 40% system loss of NiCd batteries and Sydney 
(Australia), the 12 V nickel-cadmium battery of an EDM instrument could be 
charged with 10 Ah/day (yearly mean value).
Small portable petrol generators can be used in similar ways to charge the bat­
teries of EDM instruments. However, it is not advisable to connect an EDM in­
strument directly to the battery being charged because of temporary voltage peaks 
and static discharges. Portable generators usually provide AC and DC (12 V). 
Typical units weigh about 20 kg and may provide 1 A at 240 V AC and 8 A at 12 V 
DC. The DC output may be used for the direct charging of 12 V (car) batteries. 
Where required, the charge current through the batteries can be reduced by charg­
ing two batteries in parallel.
Mains-operated DC power supplies are of advantage in stationary (often in­
doors) applications. The power supply should deliver rectified (and stabilized) 
12 V direct current, with a current rating which exceeds the current requirements 
of the distance meter. It should be noted that mains supplies often suffer from 
interference, such as voltage peaks at the time of turn on/off of large machines. 
Such interference may reach the distance meter and cause malfunctioning. Wild 
(1988) suggests the use of a commercially available mains filter between the power 
point and the power supply as well as a special cable between power supply and 
distance meter. The suggested cable features a basic interference suppressor and 
a protection against wrong polarity. However, full protection from conducted 
electromagnetic interference can only be provided by batteries!
Most manufacturers of EDM instruments supply mains operated battery 
chargers for the make specific battery packs. Apart of a charge regulator, these 
battery chargers also include a AC-DC converter. Usually, these battery chargers 
cannot be used to operate distance meters directly.
166

11.2 Batteries Used in EDM
The batteries presently used as power sources for EDM instruments may be 
grouped as follows:
1. Primary batteries
a) Alkaline cells
b) Lithium cells
2. Secondary batteries (rechargeable storage batteries)
a) Automotive lead-acid batteries
b) Sealed lead-acid cells and batteries
c) Sealed nickel-cadmium (NiCd) cells.
11.2.1 Primary Batteries
The use of primary batteries in EDM is not common, as the cost would be pro­
hibitive. However, some distance meters permit alternative operation with primary 
batteries. This option may be helpful in cases were the normal power source is 
exhausted. When using primary batteries, only alkaline manganese oxide batteries 
should be used (e.g. Duracell). Alkaline batteries perform much better than the 
older carbon-zinc (dry cell, Leclanche cell) batteries. The former exhibit better 
low temperature operation, a much improved discharge characteristic, larger 
capacity and smaller volume in comparison with the latter. The negative electrode 
(anode) is formed by jelled zinc powder. Electrolytic manganese dioxide (EMD, 
MnO2) and graphite is used as positive electrode (cathode). An aqueous solution 
of potassium hydroxide (KOH) forms the electrolyte. Mantell (1983) gives the 
following overall equation of the chemical reaction:
2Zn+2KOH+3MnO2->2ZnO+2KOH + Mn3O4 .
Lithium cells and batteries are a relatively new type of primary battery. The 
capacity of lithium cells is four times that of alkaline cells of the same weight and 
two times that of alkaline cells of the same volume. Common types of lithium 
cells (size AA to D) are: lithium thionyl chloride (Li-SOCl^, lithium sulphur 
dioxide (Li-SO2) and lithium copper oxide (Li-CuO). They have very good dis­
charge characteristics and perform very well at very low as well as very high tem­
peratures. Lithium cells and batteries are expensive. Present usage includes 
(military) communication equipment, CMOS and other electronic circuit back-up 
applications and life-support devices (e.g. heart pacemakers). EDM instruments 
and electronic theodolites may make use of the second type of application of 
lithium cells.
11.2.2 Secondary Batteries
Automotive lead-acid batteries (car batteries) normally supply power for starting, 
lighting and ignition (SLI) of road vehicles. Accordingly, the specifications state 
cranking current in amperes (CCA) and reserve capacity, rather than the more 
167

familiar capacity in Ah. The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 
defines CCA as the current (in amperes), delivered at a temperature of -18 °C 
for not less than 1 min to a voltage of not less than 8.4 V for a 12 V battery. IEC 
defines the reserve capacity as the number of minutes a fully charged battery can 
maintain a current of 25 A to a voltage of not less than 10.5 V for a 12 V battery 
at a temperature of 25 °C (Barak 1980). Although automotive batteries are not 
optimized for use with EDM instruments, they usually serve as a stand-by power 
source. All manufacturers of EDM instruments supply the necessary cables (and 
DC/DC converters, if required) to connect their distance meters to a 12 V car bat­
tery. Wild (1988) suggests that the car engine and car lights be turned off before 
the EDM instrument is connected. Distance meters should be protected from 
wrong polarity of the connection to external batteries.
The cathode (positive electrode) of lead-acid batteries is made from lead oxide 
(PbO2) and the anode (negative electrode) from spongy lead (Pb). Diluted 
sulphuric acid (H2SO4) is used as electrolyte. A full description of the chemical 
reaction as well as performance data may be found in Barak (1980). It should be 
noted that car batteries generate highly flammable hydrogen and oxygen during 
charging. Considering that, in Australia, 250 people per year suffer eye injuries 
due to exploding lead-acid batteries, great care should be used when charging and 
handling batteries.
Since about 1965, non-spill lead-acid batteries were developed for so-called 
cordless appliances. EDM instruments fall into this category. The development 
started with gel batteries and led later to sealed lead-acid cells (e.g. Gates) and 
batteries. The sealed lead-acid (or lead-calcium) batteries approach the energy 
density of the nickel-cadmium batteries discussed below. Gas re-combination 
techniques are employed to control the generation of gases. Sealed lead-acid 
(SLA) cells have similar performance characteristics as nickel-cadmium alkaline 
cells, although the capacity of the former is slightly less in terms of weight and 
volume. In comparison to NiCd cells, the SLA cells have a better discharge char­
acteristic at elevated temperatures, feature a much smaller self-discharge rate and 
are cheaper than NiCd cells. However, NiCd cells can sustain more charge/dis- 
charge cycles during their service life. This is most likely the reason why most 
EDM instrument manufacturers supply NiCd batteries. The principle and charac­
teristics of these batteries are discussed in the next section in more detail.
11.3 Sealed Nickel-Cadmium Batteries
11.3.1 Construction and Principle
Most EDM instruments employ batteries which are series combinations of in­
dividual cylindrical cells assembled in packs. The individual cells are usually rated 
at 1.2 V DC. They consist of a nickel-plated steel case as the negative terminal and 
a cell cover as the positive terminal. The positive and negative electrode plates are 
wound to form a compact roll and are isolated from each other by a porous 
separator. An electrolyte furnishes the ions for conduction between the positive 
and negative electrodes. As a safety measure, a high-pressure vent is usually incor-
168

Cover

porated in the button of the cell cover. The construction of a sealed Ni-Cd cell 
is depicted in Fig. 11.2.
The electrodes in Ni-Cd cells undergo changes in oxidation state without any 
change in physical state and, because of this, have a long life. Nickel hydroxide 
is the active material in the positive plate. The charged nickel hydroxide (NiOOH) 
is transformed to a lower valence state, namely Ni(OH)2, during discharge. In the 
negative plate, cadmium (Cd) metal is the active material and is oxidized to cad­
mium hydroxide [Cd(OH)2] during a discharge of the cell. The reactions in the 
electrolyte (KOH, potassium hydroxide), during charge and discharge may be 
summarized according to General Electric (1975) as
_ , 
. 
Discharge
Cd+2H2O+2NiOOH > 2Ni(OH)2+Cd(OH)2 .
Charge
The pressure relief safety vent opens if the internal pressure of the cell, caused 
by hydrogen and oxygen gases, exceeds 1 to 2 MPa (General Electric 1975).
Note of Caution, Ni-Cd batteries should not be incinerated or multilated because 
they may burst or release toxic materials. They should not be short circuited either 
because this may cause burns. Even a small amount of the electrolyte causes 
serious problems if it gets in the eye. Immediate flushing with water for 15 min 
and subsequent medical attention is absolutely necessary in this case.

CAPACITY AVAILABLE
Fig. 11.3. Capacity of sealed nickel-cadmium cells versus ambient temperature during charge 
and discharge of cell. (After General Electric 1975)
11.3.2 Discharge Characteristics
The discharge characteristics depend on various operating variables such as dis­
charge rate, discharge duration, temperature during the discharge and the previ­
ous charge, previous charge rate and time and the previous cycling history.
The capacity of Ni-Cd cells of 1.2 V nominal voltage is given in Ah and is 
based upon a discharge down to 1.0 or 1.1 V at a specified discharge rate. At lower 
drain rates, the actual capacity of a cell will be greater than the rated capacity; 
at higher drain rates the available capacity will be smaller. The temperature during 
the discharge as well as during the previous charge also has an effect on the avail­
able capacity. Both effects are depicted in Fig. 11.3. The drop in available capacity 
at low temperatures is considerable. However, the low temperature performance 
of Ni-Cd batteries is better than that of most other battery types. A decrease in 
available capacity also occurs at temperatures above 40° to 50 °C.
The voltage of Ni-Cd cells remains relatively flat throughout most of the dis­
charge period, with only a 100 mV drop for the rated discharge current. Higher 
drain rates produce curves of steeper slopes and at lower voltage levels. The dis­
charge voltage is also affected by previous long term overcharging. The effect 
called voltage depression may lead to a 0.1 V smaller discharge voltage during the 
entire discharge. One or more discharge/charge cycles will remove the effects of 
this voltage depression.
A multi-cell battery should never be discharged down to zero voltage because 
it may cause reverse charging of the lowest capacity cells within the battery, 
leading to a build-up of pressure in these cells. It is recommended that the dis­
charge should be terminated when the battery voltage reaches a value equivalent 
to the product (cell voltage) x(n-l) where n is the number of cells in a battery. 
A ten-cell battery (12 V) should therefore not be discharged below 10.8 V. How­
ever, deeper discharges of single cells are possible and sometimes required for 
reconditioning purposes.

11.3.3 Charge Characteristics
Four types of charge may be distinguished:
1. slow charge (14-16 h, “overnight”) Charge current = 0.1 C
2. quick charge (3-7 h) Charge current = 0.3 C
3. rapid charge (15-60 min) Charge current = 1.0C
4. ultra-rapid charge (1-3 min).
The parameter C is the current in amperes equal to the numerical value of the 
nominal ampere-hour capacity of the cell. In EDM the technique of overnight 
charge is usually adopted because overcharging of batteries is not critical at low 
charge rates of 0.1 C and because charging during field work is usually not possi­
ble. A few high rate cells allow overcharging at quick charge rates. Quick, rapid 
and ultra-rapid charging may be possible with normal Ni-Cd cells, but requires 
a sophisticated charge control to avoid overcharging, which would cause excessive 
temperatures and pressures in the cells.
Nickel-cadmium batteries should not be charged at temperatures below 5 °C 
unless the charge rate is reduced according to specifications. The batteries can be 
fully charged at temperatures between 5° and 25 °C and partially charged 
(< 70%) at higher temperatures (< 45 °C). Long periods of overcharging should 
be avoided because they produce the effect of voltage depression, discussed in the 
previous section, during the next discharge. If batteries are overcharged beyond 
their design capability, a permanent loss in capacity will result.
The charge retention is the ability of a stored battery to retain its energy once 
it has been charged and this is both time and temperature dependent as shown 
in Fig. 11.4. The self-discharge may be reduced and the charge retention increased 
by storing batteries below 20 °C. Charged Ni-Cd batteries will eventually lose all 
of their charge through this chemical self-discharge, which is, however, in no way 
harmful either to their life or to their storage characteristics.
171

The memory effect is an almost constant reduction of the discharge voltage 
level (about 0.1 V) during the discharge period and subsequently a reduction in 
the stated capacity to a predetermined discharge voltage cut-off point. It is 
developed in the battery from repetitive usage patterns. If repeated partial charge 
and discharge cycles of exact magnitudes are applied, the cell may become so con­
ditioned that it will deliver only slightly more capacity than in the previous 
repetitive cycles. The memory effect does not occur when the battery is discharged 
to random end-voltages or overcharged for random amounts of time as is usually 
the case in EDM applications.
11.3.4 Capacity and Life of Battery
The capacity rating of a cell is generally stated in terms of .ampere-hours and is 
referred to as an operating variable, indicating the integral of the discharge cur­
rent-time relationship under certain qualifying conditions, rather than as a rating 
of total electrical charge capability. The qualifying conditions define the charge 
current and time, the discharge current and the end-of-discharge voltage after a 
discharge.
The only way to measure the capacity of a battery accurately is to discharge 
it while measuring and integrating time and current of discharge. This should be 
done under the qualifying conditions specified for the battery. The battery is 
usually discharged at a constant current rate (specified by qualifying conditions) 
to the cut-off voltage (end-of-discharge voltage) laid down for the battery. The 
calculation of the ampere-hour capacity is simply obtained by multiplication of 
time and current.
Two types of loss of capacity may be distinguished: 
1. temporary (reversible) loss 
2. permanent loss.
Temporary loss results from continuous overcharging at high temperatures, pro­
grammed cyclic charges and discharges (memory effect) of repetitive nature and 
other long-term constants in the manner of operation. The full capacity of the 
battery may be restored by simply discharging the battery completely at a low rate 
of discharge and recharging it at the 0.1 C rate for 20 h at 25 °C. Only one or two 
of these cycles are generally needed. It is possible to extend the useful battery life 
by such periodic reconditioning.
Permanent loss of capacity may result from an internal short circuit (physical 
contact of two plates of opposite polarity after decomposition of the separator 
material) or from an open circuit caused by loss of water in the electrolyte (dry­
outs). The life span of a battery to its permanent failure is affected by a large 
number of factors. The battery temperature is one such factor. Temperatures 
above room temperature (20-25 °C) accelerate the degradation of the separator 
and seal of a cell. Frequent exposure to high temperatures will therefore shorten 
the life expectancy, as will charging at very low temperatures. The time element 
is also very important, both on its own (electrolyte loss) and in conjunction with 
temperature (separator decomposition). High pressure may cause venting and 
172

thus loss of electrolyte. However, only frequent venting will have an effect on the 
life and performance of a battery. The depth of discharge also has an impact on 
the life expectancy because the probability of an internal short circuit is greater 
during as low state of charge than during a partial or full state of charge.
The end of the useful life of a battery is reached when the remaining capacity 
reaches 50 to 60% of the rated value (Barak 1980). It should be noted that some 
suppliers use 80% of original capacity to define the life-time of batteries. It is 
usually given in time and/or number of charge/discharge cycles. Plessey (1975) 
state a cycling life for SAFT/VR cells of approximately 500 cycles with 100% 
depth of discharge and 2000 cycles with 50% depth of discharge. General Electric 
(1975) state a range of life expectancy from 500 cycles to more than 30000 cycles 
depending on the conditions of use. The expected life may amount to more than 
10 years with regard to the loss of electrolyte through gas diffusion. To achieve 
the above values the following operating conditions have to exist:
storage -40 to +45° (+65°)
discharge (-40) -20°C to +45°C (+65°)
charge +5°C to +45°C (+65°) (at 0.1 C rate)
Data in brackets refer to specific cells only.

12 Errors of Electro-Optical Distance Meters
All electro-optical distance meters suffer from a large number of usually very 
small instrumental errors, irrespective of the use of the pulse measurement or 
phase measurement principle. The errors may be inherent to the electrical and op­
tical design and/or caused by manufacturing and component tolerances. The 
magnitude of these errors is kept small by the manufacturers and usually ac­
counted for in the accuracy specifications of instruments. In view of the fact that 
a small number of errors must be calibrated by the user of EDM instruments and 
that errors occasionally exceed the specified accuracy and may change with time, 
the user must be aware of the main error pattern of instruments.
Before giving a review of most known error effects, the traditional com­
ponents of the overall instrument correction (I.C.) are discussed. These are: the 
additive constant, the scale correction, the non-linear distance-dependent correc­
tion and the short periodic error correction.
12.1 Additive Constant
Because the virtual electro-optical origin or zero of an EDM instrument is usually 
not located on the vertical axis of the instrument, a small correction has to be 
added to all distance measurements to refer the distance to the instrument’s ver­
tical axis. This correction is usually called the additive constant and compensates 
for electrical cable and component delays as well as optical path lengths. The 
terms “zero error” or “instrument error” are sometimes used to describe the 
equivalent error (negative value of the additive constant). A correction which 
combines the additive constant of the distance meter and the constant of the cor­
responding reflector (see Sect. 10.2.4) is usually determined by the manufacturer 
and incorporated in the instrument. This built-in correction is usually correct to 
1 or 2 mm for instruments with an internal accuracy of ±5 mm at the time of the 
factory adjustment and when using the specified reflector. The built-in constant 
can amount to a few centimetres and is accessible to the user in some instruments.
The residual additive constant can change with time and in the course of ser­
vice or repair work. In consequence, it should be determined periodically and ap­
plied to all measured distances by either changing the built-in correction or by 
computation.
Test measurements have shown that the additive constant may also be affected 
by a number of other parameters. For example, the additive constants of most dis­
tance meters are temperature-dependent. However, the temperature coefficient is 
usually very small. An exceptionally large temperature coefficient of +0.19 mm/° C 
was reported by Riieger (1987). Because of the existence of phase inhomo­
174

geneities in the emitting and photodiodes, the additive constant may change due 
to changes in attenuator or diaphragm settings or when changing the number of 
prisms. The introduction of glass or plastic attenuators obviously delays the EDM 
signal in function of the refractive index and thickness of the material (similar to 
the reflector delays).
Some instruments were found to exhibit voltage-dependent or signal strength­
dependent additive constants. The return signal strength depends on ambient at­
mospheric conditions as well as on attenuator and diaphragm and internal neutral 
density filter settings. Some older instruments also exhibited day-night changes 
of the additive constant due to changes in the operating point of the photodiode. 
In the case of telescope-mounted EDM instruments, the additive constant may 
change between mountings on different host theodolites.
12.2 Short Periodic Errors
EDM instruments based on the phase measuring principle may exhibit periodic 
errors with wavelengths equivalent to the fine measuring unit length U (often 
10 m) or its harmonics. The periodic errors, which repeat at multiples of the unit 
length U, may be due to electrical or optical crosstalk (feedthrough) or due to a 
systematic error in the phase measuring system. The former are typically 
sinusoidal. The latter may be any pattern repeating at intervals of U. Periodic er­
rors of wavelength U are called first-order short periodic (or cyclic) errors. 
Periodic errors with wavelengths equivalent to U/2, U/3, U/4 etc. are termed 
higher-order short periodic (or cyclic) errors. Mathematically, these errors are ex­
pressed as forced period Fourier series unless the errors follow clearly another 
pattern (e.g. linear trend).
Pulse distance meters are free of the crosstalk problem, as the transmitted and 
received pulses are separated in time. (Time interpolation procedures may, how­
ever, exhibit systematic errors repeating at the distance equivalent of the time in­
terpolation interval.)
12.2.1 Electrical or Optical Crosstalk Errors
Short periodic errors may be caused by electrical coupling between the reference 
signal and the measurement signal and by optical crosstalk between the transmit­
ter and receiver optics in electro-optical distance meters. It occurs in all distance 
meters to a greater or lesser degree, and is independent of the type of phase 
measuring system. The amplitude of cyclic errors in short range instruments with 
±5 mm internal accuracy is usually smaller than 5 mm.
The effect of electrical or optical crosstalk may be explained by a 
mathematical model. Considering Eqs. (2.5 a) and (2.7 a, b) the transmitted signal 
yt and the return signal y2 may be written as
yt = At sin (cot) 
(12.1)
y2 = A2sin((Ot+A0) . 
(12.2)
175

Fig. 12.1. Periodic error (<50) caused by vector addition of a crosstalk signal (y3) to the re­
ceived signal (>2)- The distance meter uses the combined and erroneous signal (y) rather than 
the correct return signal O2) and thus measures the erroneous phase (A 0') rather than the cor­
rect one (210)
A component y3 of the transmitted signal yt is superimposed on the return signal 
y2. The contaminating signal y3 has the same phase and frequency as the 
transmitted signal, but a much smaller amplitude:
y3 = A3 sin (cot) , 
(12.3)
where A3<At. The superimposed return signal in the receiver channel then 
becomes
y = y2+Y3
= A3sin(<ot)+A2sin(cot+AC>) . 
(12.4)
Because two waves of equal frequency are superimposed, the resulting wave has 
the same frequency but different phase and amplitude
y = Asin(cot+\|0 . 
(12.5)
Under the condition of A3 < A2, Eq. (12.5) may be written as
(
/ 
Aa 
\")
cot+ I A<1>------ sin AO ) > . 
(12.6)
\ 
A2 
J)
Proof of Eq. (12.6) follows easily from Fig. 12.1. In the figure, the amplitude of
the periodic function in Eq. (12.6) is denoted by A' and the periodic error by 8C>.
Because electro-optical EDM instruments are based on the measurement of 
phase differences, only the last term of Eq. (12.6) is important:
A<&' = A0+50 
(12.7)
AO' = AO-— sin AO , 
(12.8)
A2
176

where AO' is the time lead of the contaminated return signal. Using the terms unit 
length U and fraction of unit length L, Eq. (3.8) of Section 3.2.1 yields
L' = L- A.
a2
(12.9)
where L' = measured fraction of unit length of the contaminated return signal
L = fraction of unit length of return signal
U = unit lenght of EDM instrument
A2 = amplitude of the return signal
A3 = amplitude of the contaminating part of the reference signal.
The second term in Eq. (12.8) is called the first-order short periodic error because 
it is mainly a function of the fraction of the unit length and thus repeats itself 
every U metres. The error is, however, also a function of the return signal strength 
A2 which decreases with increasing distance. Depending on the design of the dis­
tance meter and the point where the crosstalk(s) occur, the first-order short 
periodic may or may not increase with distance. Assuming a unit length U of 10 m 
and an amplitude of the contaminating signal A3 = 0.003 A2 the amplitude of 
the cyclic error will be
A3
A2
= 0.003
10m\
------| = 4.8 mm .
2n 1
(12.10)
For example, the first-order short periodic error may be distance-dependent if the 
crosstalk occurs between the optical attenuators (typically neutral density filters) 
and the reflector, that means before the return signal is attenuated to the appro­
priate level. In such cases, the constant crosstalk signal adds to a return signal 
which becomes weaker with increased distance: The effect of the crosstalk in­
creases with distance. On the other hand, if the crosstalk occurs after the return 
signal has been attenuated to the appropriate level, then the ratio between the two 
signal as well as the periodic error is constant. It should be noted that often both 
types of crosstalks (or feedthrough) occur, although one or the other type may 
be more dominant.
12.2.2 Analogue Phase Measurement Errors
Some analogue phase measuring systems may display non-sinusoidal periodic er­
rors over one unit length U of the instrument. The first Hewlett-Packard distance 
meter (HP 3800B) belonged to this category. The Kern Mekometer ME 3000 was 
an instrument with another type of “analogue” phase measurement system. The 
optical-mechanical phase measurement system of the ME3000 (see Sect. 4.1.3.1) 
was sometimes found to exhibit a small linear error within the 0.3 m unit length.
Early EDM instruments generally used phase shifting resolvers for the 
analogue phase measurement (see Sect. 4.1.3.2). These devices often displayed 
177

sinusoidal errors with wavelengths equivalent to one half of the distance meter’s 
unit length, or second-order short periodic errors (Kahmen 1978). The amplitudes 
of all periodic errors caused by analogue phase measurement systems are con­
stant, and thus independent of distance.
12.2.3 Multipath Errors
Short periodic errors of first and higher order can also be caused by signals 
travelling more than two times over the distance from the instrument to the reflec­
tor. The return signal may be reflected by the distance meter’s optics or highly 
reflective GaAlAs and/or Si diodes (or by the optics of the host theodolite) and 
travel once more to the reflector and back. This process can repeat itsself a few 
times, although the signal strength is reduced greatly by each reflection. Uncoated 
glass surfaces may reflect a maximum of 4% of the incident ray and GaAlAs, 
with its refractive index of 3.6 (see Sect. 4.1.2.1), a considerable 32%. Normal in­
cidence is assumed in both cases. Considering Eq. (12.7), the periodic errors 
caused by multipathing may be described by the following equation (Covell and 
Riieger 1982):
8O = A5/A2 sin (A<D)+A6/A2 sin (2 A0>)+A7/A2 sin (3 AO) , 
(12.11)
where the amplitudes of the double, triple and quadruple path signals are denoted 
by A5, A6 and A7, respectively. Some numerical examples may be found in 
Covell (1979) and Covell and Riieger (1982). As all amplitudes A decrease with 
distance, the short periodic errors caused by multipathing become smaller with 
increased distance. It should be noted that the first term in Eq. (12.11) has op­
posite sign of the last term in Eq. (12.8) and that these two first-order short 
periodic errors may cancel each other.
12.2.4 Experimental Results
Experimental results indicate that first-order short periodic errors may change 
their amplitudes (and phase) with distance, changes in signal strength, time, am­
bient light, and in the course of service and repair work. Amplitudes may exceed 
10 mm in some cases. Please note that fingerprints on the front lens of an elec­
tronic tacheometer may generate crosstalk and, thus, a short periodic error.
Multipath errors are usually small and restricted to first-order short periodic 
errors. However, larger errors may occur in special circumstances. On one occa­
sion, it was possible to trace a multipath error, featuring 70 mm amplitude at 10 m 
and reducing to 13 mm at 80 m, to an optical part in a host theodolite, which did 
not carry an anti-reflex coating.
Statistically significant higher order short periodic errors are often present in 
test results. In some cases they can be explained by effects discussed in previous 
sections, in other cases not. In this context it should be noted that forced period 
Fourier series [as the one shown in Eq. (12.11)] can satisfactorily model most 
178

systematic errors within the interval of one unit length even if the latter are not 
sinusoidal. A physical explanation may therefore not always be possible. This 
follows also from the fact that the sum of a number of periodic errors is measured 
(and not the individual contributors) and that the sections above do not cover all 
possible errors.
12.2.5 Reduction of Short Periodic Errors
The manufacturers reduce the amplitude of these errors by rigorous electrical 
shielding of transmitter and receiver, separation of optical channels, special anti­
reflex coating of common optical parts and/or electronic compensation. Com­
pensation may be by adding to the received signal an analogue signal equal in 
phase and amplitude but with opposite sign of the latter. Alternatively, the short 
periodic error may be determined by the manufacturer numerically and the ap­
propriate correction stored in the distance meter for on-line application. Both 
compensation mechanisms must assume that amplitude and phase of the short 
periodic error do not change with distance. Short periodic errors may also be 
reduced by an execution of the phase measurement at four different phases (90° 
apart) of the return signal (Hines 1976). As long as the crosstalk signal remains 
unaffected by the 90° shifts, the mean of the four phase measurements will be 
free of first- and second-order periodic errors. It has also been suggested that the 
crosstalk signal be measured (by disabling the internal and the external light path) 
and stored and then used to correct subsequent distance observations (Ohtomo 
1983).
It will be shown later how a user of a distance meter can calibrate the short 
periodic error and then correct distance measurements by computation, if so re­
quired.
12.3 Scale Errors
Scale errors in EDM instruments are caused primarily by the oscillator and by the 
emitting and receiving diodes. It should be noted that a large number of other 
scale errors are caused by external effects, such as using an incorrect value of the 
velocity of light, using an incorrect first velocity correction, omission of humidity 
correction, limited resolution of ppm correction input, errors in temperature or 
pressure measurements/estimates, erroneous geometrical reductions (includes 
omission of geoid-spheroid separation), to name just a few.
12.3.1 Oscillator Errors
The most significant oscillator error is its dependency on temperature. As out­
lined in Section 4.1.1, oven-controlled crystal oscillators (OCXO’s) perform best 
in this respect once they have reached their operational temperature. Most short 
range distance meters feature temperature-compensated crystal oscillators

istics of the first and second instrument are labelled H and K. The curves I and J refer to the 
third instrument and show the good day-to-day repeatability of the frequency measurements. 
The curves L, M, N, O and P describe the characteristic of the fourth instrument. The discon­
tinuity (±3 ppm) at about 10°C is real but not typical for distance meters. (After Riieger 1982)
(TCXO’s) as time bases. The frequency versus temperature characteristic of (AT- 
cut) quartz crystal oscillators can be modelled by a third degree polynomial. The 
inflection point is at about 25 °C. The frequency drops and rises steeply at low 
and high temperatures, respectively. The test results depicted in Fig. 12.2 show 
that not the full pattern may be evident within a relative narrow temperature 
range. Three out of four instruments shown are obviously equipped with TCXO’s 
and perform very well. The fourth instrument is likely to employ a room tempera­
ture crystal oscillator (RTXO) and features a frequency versus temperature gra­
dient of about 0.45ppm/°C and an unusual discontinuity at about +10°C 
(Riieger 1982). Because of the temperature dependence of the oscillator, the scale 
of short range distance meters is also affected by warm-up effects. This means 
that the oscillator’s frequency is dependent on how long the distance meter has 
been operating. During operation, the distance meter dissipates heat, which, in 
turn, warms up the oscillator. Different measuring modes lead to different warm­
up effects. Warm-up effects may amount to as little as 1 ppm over the first hour 
or as much as 5 ppm, depending on instruments (Riieger 1982).
180

The frequency versus time behavior of oscillators is described by the short­
term and the long-term stability. The short-term stability is usually very good. The 
long-term stability (or ageing) is typically less than 1 ppm/year. Normally, the fre­
quency drops with time as particles settle on the quartz slice and effectively in­
crease its thickness (and decrease its resonance frequency). Because of the ageing 
pattern, the scale of distance meters must be checked periodically. Quartz crystal 
oscillators are also susceptible to a number of other (but usually negligible) 
effects, such as drive voltage changes, retrace, hysteresis and electro-magnetic 
interference (EMI). More details may be found in Riieger (1982).
12.3.2 Diode Errors
Diode errors may affect the scale of distance meters in three ways. Firstly, the ac­
tual carrier wavelength of the GaAlAs diode’s emission may be different from the 
nominal or published value. Errors arise because the latter rather than the former 
is used in the derivation of the first velocity correction. Secondly, the actual car­
rier wavelength may be temperature-dependent and affect scale in a similar way. 
Thirdly, the linear component of the effect of phase inhomogeneities across the 
emitting as well as the receiving diode also affects the scale of EDM instruments. 
Some earlier instruments exhibited scale errors of 10 to 30 ppm due to phase in­
homogeneities, thus exceeding oscillator errors by at least a factor of 5 (Schwarz 
and Witte 1986)! Further details on the effects of phase inhomogeneities are given 
in the next section.
12.4 Non-Linear Distance-Dependent Errors
All distance-dependent systematic errors, which are repeatable and reproducible 
but do not fit the above three classes (Sects. 12.1, 12.2, 12.3) may be termed non­
linear distance-dependent errors and include the so-called non-periodic errors as 
well as long-periodic errors. These errors are most likely caused by the phase in­
homogeneities in both the emitting and receiving diodes. The effect has been 
discussed previously in Section 4.1.2.1 and Fig. 4.6. The aperture of a reflector 
moving further and further away from the EDM instrument will collect and 
return less and less of the non-uniform phase pattern across the measurement 
beam (see Fig. 4.6). The average phase information returned by the reflector may 
be imagined as the integral of the phase across the reflector’s aperture weighted 
by the corresponding power (see Fig. 4.5). The weighted phase integral will be dis­
tance-dependent as soon as the power of phase pattern is not uniform. In conse­
quence, the resulting errors will depend on the shape, size and number of the 
reflectors used.
Other contributing error sources may be: changes in diaphragm setting, step- 
wise changes in attenuator setting, changes of the operating point of the ava­
lanche photodiode (e.g. stepwise variation of multiplication factor) and other 
signal strength effects.

vals between 3 and 68 m against a laser interferometer. Dominant are the 10 m (first-order) short 
periodic error and the non-linear distance-dependent error (change of 7 mm over first 20 m). 
The ordinate values represent measured distances minus true distances. The measurements are 
depicted by dots and the fitted 4th degree polynomial by a continuous curve. Note that the fit­
ted curve has the sign of an error; the corresponding correction [in Eq. (12.12)] has the opposite 
sign
The non-linear distance-dependent errors are usually modelled as a poly­
nomial expression of n-th degree and may then be called non-periodic errors 
(Covell 1979; Schwarz 1983). Test measurements indicate that non-periodic errors 
are most pronounced on close range, typically to about 20 m. Non-linear changes 
of 5 to 20 mm have been reported in some cases within this interval. Figure 12.3 
shows an example of a non-periodic error on close range combined with a signifi­
cant first-order short-periodic error. The equation for the fitted instrument cor­
rection (IC) in Fig. 12.3 is as follows:
IC = CONST-167.8 (D/100)+679.0 (D/100)2-1239.9 (D/100)3
+ 820.1 (D/100)4-2.5 SIN (27tD/10)-1.6 COS (2nD/10) , 
(12.12)
where IC 
= instrument correction (millimetre)
D 
= distance (metre)
CONST = additive constant at zero distance (millimetre).
182

In some instances, the error patterns may be better represented by so-called long- 
periodic errors (Riieger 1987; Covell and Riieger 1982). The wavelengths of the 
latter sometimes agree with the coarse measurement wavelengths used by the dis­
tance meters (e.g. 1 km, 2 km). In other cases, the wavelengths of such long- 
periodic errors may be obtained with frequency analysis techniques. Long- 
periodic errors of 5 mm amplitude and 1000 m wavelength have been reported for 
some instruments.
The user may evaluate (but not calibrate) the magnitude of the problem of 
phase inhomogeneities by establishing so-called false pointing diagrams (Kahmen 
1977; Kahmen and Zetsche 1974; Riieger et al. 1975; Witte and Schwarz 1982). 
After an initial pointing and distance measurement to the centre of the reflector, 
the distance meter is deliberately mispointed in steps of several minutes of arc to 
the left, to the right, upwards and downwards, each time taking one or more dis­
tance measurement. The plots of distance measurement versus mispointing 
(separately for vertical and horizontal scan) are referred to as false pointing 
diagrams. The test may be improved by taking measurements in a grid pattern 
around the centre of the reflector. As mentioned before, these scans provide infor­
mation on the magnitude of the problem only. Calibration has to occur elsewhere, 
usually on multistation EDM baselines, as discussed later in Section 13.
12.5 Summary and Mathematical Model of Errors
A brief summary of instrumental and non-instrumental errors is given in Table 
12.1. The former have been discussed in the sections above. The latter are self- 
explanatory. The list of errors is by no means exhaustive nor have all independent 
variables been taken into account. For example, repair and servicing of in­
struments might affect quite a few error patterns. Also, non-tiltable reflectors lead 
to errors which depend on the zenith angle of the wave path. References for most 
listed errors may be found in Riieger (1977).
Following from Table 12.1 and the previous sections, the mathematical model 
of most instrumental errors may be given as (Riieger 1987):

The first three terms in Eq. (12.13) represent the three components of the additive 
constant, namely the constant, temperature-dependent and warm-up terms. The 
coefficients A10 to A15 model the scale corrections. The coefficients A14 and A15 
refer to the ageing and warm-up effects. The fifth degree polynomial (coefficients 
A2q to A50) expresses the non-linear distance-dependent errors or non-linearity 
of the instrument correction. The last four lines of Eq. (12.13) constitute a fourth­
order Fourier series with forced period U and model the short periodic errors. The 
amplitudes of the periodic errors cater for a change with distance (e.g. coefficient 
B12). The wavelengths of the first-, second-, third- and fourth-order terms are U, 
U/2, U/3 and U/4, respectively.
It is not suggested that Eq. (12.13) be used routinely for calibration purposes. 
All instrument users are advised to periodically test the coefficients Aoo (additive 
constant), A10 (scale correction) as well as Bn and Cn (first-order short periodic 
error correction). In some cases it might also be necessary to determine the coeffi­
cients A20 to A50 (non-linear distance-dependent errors) as well as B21 and C21 
(second-order short periodic errors). When operating distance meters within their 
claimed accuracy bands, it should not be necessary to calibrate any further terms. 
For improved accuracy performance, further terms might have to be considered. 
Some appropriate calibration procedures are discussed in the following chapter.

13 Calibration of Electro-Optical Distance Meters
13.1 Introduction
In this context, the calibration of a distance meter is defined as the determination 
of its instrument correction and associated precision. The instrument correction 
IC [see Eq. (12.13), for example] is added to distance measurements to obtain the 
correct distance. It has been shown previously that the instrument correction is 
a function of a number of independent variables, the most important being dis­
tance, temperature and time. The instrument correction is determined for a par­
ticular instrument-reflector combination. All distance-dependent and the con­
stant terms require re-evaluation when using the distance meter with another type 
of reflector.
13.1.1 Reasons for Calibration
Electro-optical distance meters may be calibrated for a number of reasons. The 
most important ones are:
- quality control
— at time of purchase
- periodically thereafter
- improvement of accuracy 
- legal metrology.
The quality control measurements at the time of purchase have to establish if an 
instrument fulfils the manufacturer’s specifications. The most important 
specifications are those of accuracy, temperature range and distance range. The 
accuracy specification can be tested in the context of EDM instrument calibra­
tion. Possible interpretations of accuracy specifications are discussed later in Sec­
tion 13.6. The specified temperature range for the operation of distance meters 
cannot be easily verified by users. If operation of an instrument is expected to be 
predominantly at the upper (or lower) end of the specified temperature range, it 
is advisable to consult the manufacturer prior to ordering. [Riieger (1987) re­
ported the failure of two out of eight distance meters at -20 °C.] The verification 
of the range specifications is possible, but very time-consuming. It should be 
noted that range specifications usually imply the use of specific reflectors. Sect. 
5.2 provides some information on range formulae.
After the initial quality control measurements, it is advisable to schedule 
periodic quality control measurements, typically at half yearly or yearly intervals. 
General purpose distance meters require the periodic determination of precision 
and instrument correction. The latter can usually be restricted to the constant, 
186

linear and short periodic terms or, in other words, to additive constant, scale cor­
rection and short periodic error corrections. Calibrations should also be carried 
out after any service or repair work on instruments. It is strongly recommended 
to maintain a file on all calibration measurements carried out with a particular 
distance meter. If the same quality control tests are carried out each time, the file 
will indicate any variations and deterioration of the instrument constant and the 
instrument’s precision. The key parameters of each test should be summarized in 
a table for easier detection of such changes with time. It is advisable to include 
ambient temperature and prevailing weather conditions in such tables as some pa­
rameters are, for example, temperature-dependent.
The quality control measurements discussed above are a necessity rather than 
an option and are essential if the specified accuracy of a distance meter is to be 
realized. In consequence, most manufacturers prescribe the determination by the 
user of the additive constant and scale (modulation frequency). If a distance 
meter features additional and repeatable systematic errors, it may be possible to 
calibrate such errors and to compensate them by the application of corrections. 
If relatively large errors are detected and compensated, a sizable improvement in 
accuracy may be possible. Often, the improvement in accuracy by calibration re­
quires some changes in the field procedures as the measuring conditions during 
calibration and field measurements should be as equal as possible. Some 
systematic errors can be eliminated by suitable field procedures alone.
Corrections should be applied for statistically significant systematic errors only. 
Economic reasons usually dictate a further restriction to the largest significant er­
rors which provide maximum improvement in accuracy. To establish these, a com­
prehensive calibration similar to Eq. (12.13) needs to be executed initially. Subse­
quent periodic calibrations are then restricted to the verifications of the significant 
terms. The accuracy of an EDM instrument can typically be improved by a factor 
2 to 4 through a more extensive calibration and improved field procedures (Riieger 
1987). The cost of extensive calibrations should always be compared with the cost 
of hiring or purchasing a distance meter with better accuracy specifications.
In some countries (such as Australia), the length measurements carried out by 
surveyors in the context of “legal” (usually cadastral) surveys are governed by na­
tional “weights and measures” legislation. This requirement for legal metrology 
may provide a third reason for the calibration of EDM instruments. The re­
quirements of legal metrology necessarily differ from country to country. In 
Australia, the following coefficients of Eq. (12.13) are evaluated and incorporated 
in the “legal instrument correction” if found to be significant: A^, A10, A20, 
A30, A40, A50, B11s Ctl, B21, C21. The coefficients Aoo (additive constant) and 
A10 (scale correction) are always stated by the legal instrument correction. More 
information on legal EDM instrument calibration in Australia may be found in 
Riieger (1985) and Norton (1986). Some results of routine legal EDM calibration 
may be found in Benwell et al. (1985).
13.1.2 Concept of Calibration
As indicated before, the calibration of a distance meter consists in the determina­
tion of its instrument correction and associated precision. It follows from the 
187

discussions in Chapter 12 that this instrument correction is dependent on many 
variables, such as distance, temperature, time, supply voltage and ambient at­
mospheric conditions, to name the most important relationships. The change of 
the IC with distance could be determined by mounting the reflector on a carriage 
and moving this on a rail of one or more kilometre(s) length. With the distance 
meter mounted at the end of the rail, distances of different lengths could be mea­
sured over the total working range of the distance meter and instantly compared 
with a working standard of length. The temperature effects could be determined 
by placing the facility (with a length of a few kilometres) in a temperature 
chamber and by repeating the test versus distance at equally spaced temperatures 
over the total specified temperature range of the instrument. The long-term com­
ponent of the time effect could be established by repeating the distance/tempera- 
ture tests periodically, say every year. The voltage effect could be calibrated by car­
rying out all distance measurements in the above tests at selected input voltages.
It is needless to say that the costs of such an approach would be prohibitive. 
However, the concept could be realized by using an underground tunnel as labora­
tory (and by air-conditioning it) and the Kern Mekometer ME 5000 as length stan­
dard. On a smaller scale and at one temperature only, the rail concept is used by 
most manufacturers as well as some universities and national standard laborato­
ries for general-purpose EDM instrument testing on close range. The range of 
these facilities is typically restricted by the working range of the laser in­
terferometers used as length standards (presently 50 to 70 m).
As it is generally not practical to test the instrument correction simultaneously 
against all variables, separate tests are used to determine one coefficient or groups 
of coefficients of Eq. (12.13) at a time. As the largest number of (known) errors 
are distance-dependent, procedures have been developed to efficiently determine 
the distance-dependent coefficients of the instrument correction (IC). For prac­
tical reasons, the ideal rail approach is usually replaced by a finite number of 
survey marks (or pillars) along a line. Such testlines are typically called EDM 
(calibration) baselines. Three basic baseline designs will be discussed later. They 
all permit determination of most if not all distance-dependent terms of the instru­
ment correction as long as the true baseline lengths are known. Short periodic er­
rors are sometimes determined on specialized testlines, either outdoors or in a lab­
oratory.
Additional laboratory tests may be used to efficiently determine the tempera­
ture dependence of an instrument’s scale as well as its additive constant. The 
warm-up effects on additive constant and scale can also be established in the labo­
ratory. It should be noted that repeated baseline observations also provide data 
on temperature variations of additive constant, scale and, possibly, other coeffi­
cients of Eq. (12.13), if the ambient temperatures experienced during baseline 
observations vary greatly between baseline measurements.
The change with time of some coefficients of the instrument correction can 
only be established through repeated measurements on baselines (and, possibly, 
in the laboratory) over long periods of time.
The step-by-step approach to instrument calibration is less rigorous than the 
ideal approach discussed before as some potential dependencies remain untested. 
Table 12.1 and Eq. (12.13) indicate the most widely (but not all) reported error 
188

patterns. This should always be kept in mind when analyzing calibration measure­
ments.
13.2 Calibration on EDM Baselines
EDM calibration baselines have been the preferred approach to general-purpose 
EDM instrument calibration since the introduction of infrared distance meters. 
A first publication on distance measurements in all combinations on EDM 
baselines dates back to 1968 (Pauli 1968). Alternative calibration schemes, such 
as radial patterns and calibration networks, are rarely employed by users. Mea­
surements in a radial pattern to fixed reflectors (e.g. from an elevated window) 
are used by most manufacturers and their agents for routine tests on longer lines. 
The properties of the baseline design compare favourably with the two other 
designs mentioned:
- (relatively) low cost of installation
— few stations, many observations
- little space needed (but linear)
- high precision for additive constant, even if known distances are not available 
or are out of date
- distances (evenly) spread over the whole range of the instrument
- easy computation, with or without known distances.
The discussions below refer to EDM baselines only.
13.2.1 Geometric Design of EDM Baselines
13.2.1.1 Golomb Rulers in EDM Baseline Design
All baseline designs discussed below aim at an equal distribution of all measured 
distances between the shortest and longest line on the baseline, with no repeti­
tions. Some designs require each length to be a multiple of a basic unit length. 
In two of the three cases, this requirement must be fulfilled by distances measured 
in all combinations. Staiger (1987) pointed out that the equivalent mathematical 
problem may be found in Golomb’s Graceful Graphs and in Golomb’s Rulers 
(Gardner 1983; Bloom and Golomb 1976). A ruler marked at 0, 1, 4, 6 (cm) is 
called gracefully labelled because such a ruler can measure all integral distances 
from zero to the length of the ruler, namely 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (cm). In this case, all 
distances between pairs of marks are different and run consecutively from zero 
to the ruler’s total length. Golomb proved that gracefully numbered rulers can be 
found for rulers of four marks or less. This means that it is impossible to design 
baselines of five or more stations with truly equal spacing of distances measured 
in all combinations. For rulers with more than four marks, non-redundant, mini­
mum-length rulers “with best numbering” have been found. These semi-graceful 
rulers are the shortest possible rulers of a given number of marks (end points in­
cluded) with all distances between pairs of marks being different but not featuring 
189

all consecutive distances from zero to the total length of the ruler. Tables of pos­
sible rulers with 2 to 11 marks may be found in Bloom and Golomb (1976) and 
Staiger (1987). These semi-graceful Golomb rulers may be used in lieu of the 
design equations given below for the Heerbrugg-type and Aarau-type baselines. 
Golomb rules provide four design options for six station baselines and five op­
tions for seven station baselines. Only one design option each is available for 
baselines with 8 to 11 stations.
13.2.1.2 Heerbrugg Design
Schwendener (1971, 1972) published a baseline design which features an (almost) 
equal distribution of the distances measured in all combinations over the baseline 
length as well as over the unit length of the distance meter. The original design 
has seven stations, provides 21 observations in all combinations and a total length 
of 1021.5 m. It is based on a unit length of 10 m and has the following section 
lengths (in metres): 19.5, 39.0, 68.0,127.5, 256.0, 511.5. Some fractions of the unit 
length are repeated: 1.5 m three times and 7.5 m two times. The design of this 
baseline permits the detection of all distance-dependent errors, including the 
short periodic errors.
The original publication gives the least-squares solution for the additive con­
stant and six unknown baseline distances. The short periodic errors have to be 
checked by a plot of the residuals versus the corresponding fraction of the unit 
length. If present, the adjustment has to be repeated with data corrected for the 
short periodic error. If the latter is not done, the additive constant may be in error 
by up to 75% of the short periodic error’s amplitude (Riieger 1976).
A design equations for Heerbrugg-type (Schwendener-type) baselines is given 
in Tables 13.1 and 13.2. The baseline design is based on four input parameters:
U = unit length of distance meter(s) to be tested
A = shortest distance on baseline (multiple of U)
Co = desired total length of baseline 
n = number of baseline stations
The value Co should be selected according to the maximum distance which can 
be measured to a single reflector in worse than average atmospheric conditions. 
The range between parameters A and Co should include the lengths of lines ex­
perienced in everyday survey work with the distance meter in question. The num­
ber of stations has to be decided on the basis of the required precision of the ad­
ditive constant, the availability of true distances and the expected field effort per 
calibration. A reasonable cost versus precision balance is obtained with six to 
seven stations. The following parameters are determined in the design process:
C = final total length of baseline
Bo = estimate of first design parameter
B = final value of first design parameter (Bo rounded to the nearest multiple 
of A)
D = second design parameter.

Firstly, Bo is determined according to Table 13.1 and then rounded downwards to 
the next multiple of the unit length U. The second design parameter D follows 
directly from the number of stations and the unit length U. Its value is listed in 
Table 13.1. Based on the values of A, B and D, the baseline sections as well as 
the final baseline length C may be computed from the equations given in Table 
13.2. With the section lengths known, all combinations of distances can be com­
puted. It is advisable to plot all combinations of distances versus distance to 
verify the quality of the design. As the distribution of the distances within the 
unit length is exactly the same as the distribution over the total baseline length, 
a plot of the former is not required. If the design is not totally satisfactory, it may 
be varied by small changes to A or B or both. B should not be equal to A if repeti­
tions of distances are to be avoided. Good designs result in cases where B is 
equivalent to 2 A.

Input values: U = 10 m, A = 2U = 20 m, desired baseline length (Co) = 1000 m, eight stations. 
Bo = 40.47 m, rounded to B = 40 m. Final total length (C) = 990 m. D = 0.204 m.
A numerical design example is given in Table 13.3. The general design formula 
leads to an equal distribution of distances over the baseline length as well as over 
the unit length. Distances or their fractions of the unit length do not repeat.
Because all combinations of distances are distributed in exactly the same way 
over the unit length as over the baseline length, short periodic errors will be map­
ped as long periodic errors in a plot of the residuals of a baseline adjustment ver­
sus distance unless short periodic errors are solved for simultaneously. It should 
also be noted that additive constants obtained from baseline adjustments with 
solution for additive constants and scale (or baseline distances) only may be in 
error by as much as 75% of the amplitude of the first-order short periodic error. 
To remove the error from the additive constant, the short periodic error may be 
determined and the baseline measurement corrected prior to the adjustment. 
Generally it is preferable to always include the short periodic errors as unknown 
parameters in the least-squares adjustment.
13.2.1.3 Aarau Design
Although a first multiple-of-unit-length design was reported by Pauli in 1968, the 
concept of all combinations of distances being equally distributed over the total 
baseline distance in combination with a separate determination of the short 
periodic errors was first reported by Aeschlimann and Stocker (1974) and Kern 
(1974). The particular baseline in Aarau has a total length of 520 m with sections 
of 30, 70, 80, 120, 170 and 50 m length. This design features baseline sections 
which are exact multiples of the unit length U. Assuming that the amplitudes and 
phases of the short periodic errors do not change over the length of the baseline, 
the short periodic errors will affect each combination measured on the baseline 
by an equal amount. Any short periodic errors will therefore map into the additive

constant which is derived from the baseline measurements. The determined scale 
or unknown baseline distances will not be affected. Because of the effect of short 
periodic errors on the additive constant, the short periodic errors must be deter­
mined separately on special “cyclic error testlines” and the bias of the additive 
constant removed. This aspect will be dealt with in Section 13.3.
A generalized design equation for Aarau-type baselines is given in Tables 13.4 
and 13.5. The definitions of the parameters are the same as in the previous sec­
tion. With all combinations being multiples of the unit length, the parameter D 
is no longer required. A numerical example is given in Table 13.6. Because of their 
separate determination, the short periodic errors as well as non-linear distance­
dependent or long periodic errors are obtained with a higher precision than in the 
case of Heerbrugg-type baselines. The measuring effort increases accordingly. 
Should the assumption of the short periodic errors remaining constant over the 
baseline length prove to be wrong, biased additive constants and distance-depen-

on the measurement of all combinations of distances like the two designs above. 
It also differs from the two other designs by relying on true baseline distances be­
ing known at all times. The stations are spaced at equal intervals over the total 
baseline range. The distance meter to be calibrated occupies only one endpoint 
of the baseline as well as an auxiliary station half a unit length apart. The pillar 
coordinates of the original Hobart EDM baseline are given as 0, 5, 10, 123, 231, 
359, 477 and 595 m (Sprent 1980), with the 5 m pillar being used for 10 m unit 
length distance meters and the 10 m pillar for 20 m unit length instruments (e.g. 
Wild Distomat DI 3). This specific baseline features six fundamental stations as 
well as two auxiliary stations.
The test measurements are completed in minimum time as the distance meter 
does not move more than a few meters. The design permits the computation of 
the additive constant and the scale correction by simple linear regression tech­
niques. Both parameters are not affected by any first-order short periodic errors 
present and minimally by any third-order short periodic errors. Their estimated 
standard deviations, however, are. Both parameters are affected by any second- 
order short periodic errors. The poor redundancy of the original Hobart design 
can be improved by an increased number of fundamental stations and/or addi­
tional auxiliary stations at 1/4 and 3/4 unit length from the first station.

Baseline options marked by asterisks are not recommended as the dis­
tribution of measurements from the auxiliary station over the unit 
length is exactly the same as from the first station. The ability to 
resolve higher-order short periodic is reduced in these cases. The sec­
tion lengths between all fundamental stations are constant and defined 
by the sum of B and D.
Table 13.7 gives generalized design equations for Hobart-type EDM baselines.
The description of the parameters is as follows:
U = unit length of EDM instrument
Co = desired total length of baseline
C = final total length of baseline
Bo = approximate value of first design parameter
B = final value of first design parameter (= Bo rounded downwards to 
nearest multiple of U)
D = second design parameter
B+D = section length between fundamental stations.
A numerical example may now be given. Assuming a desired baseline length Co of 
800 m, a unit length of 10 m and eight fundamental stations, values of 110 m and 
1.43 m are obtained for B and D, respectively. The coordinates of the stations com­
pute then as: 0.00, 5.00, 111.43, 222.86, 334.29, 445.71, 557.14, 668.57, 780.00 m.
13.2.2 Physical Design
An ideal baseline site should have the following properties:
1. be of required length
2. even (or slightly concave) ground surface (horizontal or even slope)
3. equal irradiation by sunlight on entire line (no change between shaded and un­
shaded sections)
4. even vegetation, small growth (e.g. open grassland)
5. limited or no public access (vandalism, beam interruptions)
6. bedrock not too far below ground surface
7. easy access (road)
195

8. access road along base (to speed up transport of reflectors and instruments 
between stations)
9. North-South orientation (allowing measurement with and against the sun) 
10. sympathetic owner.
If the baseline is to be used for one specific instrument only, it should have 
a length equal to the maximum distance normally measured in practice. This dis­
tance should be measurable with the normal number of prisms (1 or 3) under av­
erage atmospheric conditions.
If the baseline is to be used for instruments of varying range, a length may 
be chosen corresponding to the instrument having the longest range. In such a 
case more stations than normal should be considered in order to be able to ac­
curately determine the instrument correction of the instruments with shorter 
ranges, even if this means that only a selection of all distances can be measured 
with the latter. Alternatively, the base length may be chosen to correspond to the 
range of the instrument with the shortest range, the whole length of the base then 
being used for all instruments (easier solution for computations).
Concrete pillars have some invaluable advantages over ground marks, and con­
sequently are commonly used where high precision is required. The advantages 
of pillars are:
1. Stability during measurement (effects of operator and sun)
2. no danger of movement when interchanging reflector and heavy instruments 
3. fast instrument and reflector set-up resulting from
- constrained centring
- pre-levelled centring plates
4. precise centring to 0.1 mm or better
5. constant height of instrument and reflector resulting in standardized com­
putations.
Ground marks on the other hand require many tripods to provide constrained 
centring. The centring of these tripods and the measurement of zenith angle, 
every time a calibration is carried out, is very time-consuming. In addition, it is 
not possible to achieve the same accuracy in centring as on pillars and there is a 
degree of uncertainty about the stability of tripods due to the effects of operators, 
sun and interchange of reflectors, EDM instruments and theodolites. Therefore 
a pillared baseline is always preferable to one with ground marks. The costs of 
establishing pillars will soon be compensated by savings of time in the field and 
during computation.
For the pillar design, different solutions are available. The pillar centring 
system is a very crucial point and full attention should be paid to this problem. 
Suitable pillar designs are described in Kern (1974); Raphael (1983) and 
Kaariainen et al. (1986), for example.
Although pillared EDM baselines are the preferred option, it should be noted 
that pillars may exhibit diurnal movements due to the daily change in sun ex­
posure. Kobold (1958, 1961) and Borutta and Maass (1986) report on diurnal 
peak-to-peak pillar movements of 1.0 mm. Slightly smaller values of 0.6 mm have 
been measured for roof pillars at the University of New South Wales (Riieger 
196

1983). The effect of such short-term movements may have to be considered when 
deciding on a priori centring errors unless the pillars are protected from direct 
sunlight. Pillars may also exhibit long-term movements. Such movements may be 
caused by settlement due to the dead weight of the mark, slope creep, shrinkage 
and swelling of cohesive soils following changes in the water table as well as by 
underground mining, to name just a few.
Because of the possible long-term movements of pillars, national standard 
baselines measured with the Vaisala compensator are traditionally marked by 
both primary underground marks and secondary observation pillars (about 2 m 
apart). On occasions, the short-term pillar movements did adversely affect the 
Vaisala comparator measurements on such standard baselines. The marking of 
two recent Vaisala baselines is described by Kaariainen et al. (1986, 1988).
13.2.3 Measurements on EDM Baselines
The procedures listed below are suggested for routine baseline measurements for 
the purpose of legal calibration of EDM instruments in Australia. They may be 
taken as a guide. More elaborate procedures are required when calibrating preci­
sion or high precision distance meters.
1. The observation sequence should be chosen in such a way that short lines are 
measured first and long lines later. (For example, if all 21 combinations on 
a 7-station baseline are to be measured: 6-*7, 5-*7, 5->6, 4-*6, 4-*5, 4-* 7, 
3->7, 3->6,..., H5, l-*4, l->3, 1~>2. (On Hobart-type baselines, the 
reflector will move from the closest to the most distant station and back.)
2. The EDM instrument station must be shaded by an umbrella.
3. Temperature and pressure is measured (in the shade) at the instrument station 
at the beginning of baseline measurements, upon completion of these and at 
half-hourly intervals between the two times and at other times when a change 
in weather is experienced.
4. Partial water vapour pressure or relative humidity is not measured. A baseline 
specific yearly average should be taken into account by the analysis.
5. On the first EDM instrument station to be occupied, the EDM instrument 
is set up and shaded (without switching on) at least 15 min prior to measure­
ment of the first line on the baseline.
6. The “ppm-knob” is set to the neutral position, usually 0 ppm.
7. On each line, four distance measurements are taken, with repointing after each 
measurement. Pointing is “optically” or “electronically” (maximum signal 
strength) as prescribed by the manufacturer of the instrument concerned.
8. If possible, all distances are measured with one single prism. If necessary, lon­
ger distances may be measured to one triple prism. This (these) prism(s) 
should carry a permanent and unique identification label(s).
9. The measurements should be executed with the attenuator or aperture setting 
as prescribed by the instrument’s manufacturer for a particular distance 
range.
10. Between the first and the last measurement on the baseline, the EDM instru­
ment should be kept in the open air and in the shade.
197

11. EDM instruments should be operated according to the manufacturer’s in­
struction and/or according to the measuring procedures followed during field 
surveys. Should the manufacturer suggest a number of alternative procedures, 
the field notes and the verification certificate should clearly indicate which 
procedure was followed.
12. The EDM instrument should be switched on immediately prior to the four mea­
surements of a line and it should be turned off after these four measurements.
13. On pillared baselines, the height of the reflector, of any tilting axis on 
target/reflector assembly, of the EDM instrument and of the height of 
theodolite (if EDM equipment mounted on such) above the bottom plate of 
the tribrach used should be measured and booked to millimetres before and 
after the baseline measurements. This is best done in the office on a table, 
by measuring the heights from the table top with a pocket tape in four car­
dinal directions. The footscrews should be in mid-position during these mea­
surements. Before levelling theodolite, EDM instrument and reflector on any 
station, the footscrews should be returned to the mid-position.
14. Whenever spot bubbles (circular levels) are used for levelling purposes, which 
cannot be rotated through 180° about the vertical axis of the respective equip­
ment, they need to be checked and adjusted, if necessary, against a plate level 
of a theodolite before commencing the first measurement on a baseline and 
again after completion of all measurements on baseline.
15. The temperatures should be measured at instrument height and in the shade 
with good quality mercury thermometers or with platinum resistance or ther­
mistor thermometers designed for temperature measurements of gases. Tem­
peratures should be read to one degree Celsius. The error of the thermometer 
used, at the points of the scale used during the baseline measurements, should 
not exceed ± 1.0 °C. The thermometer(s) used should carry a permanent and 
unique identification label.
16. The pressures should be measured in the shade and with a horizontal 
barometer carrying a permanent and unique identification label. Aneroid 
barometers should be graduated to at least 2 mb and should be gently tapped 
prior to reading. Pressures should be read to at least 2 mb.
The barometers should be calibrated against a mercury column barometer 
at least prior to baseline measurements. If a malfunction is detected on the 
baseline, a second calibration after the baseline measurements should be ex­
ecuted.
Mercury column barometers may usually be found at weather stations 
operated by the local Bureau of Meterology. Comparisons should be made 
against station level pressure and NOT against sea level pressure.
17. In the case of telescope- or theodolite-mounted EDM instruments, the axis 
of the EDM beam should be adjusted according to the manufacturers instruc­
tions. Under no circumstances should this adjustment be changed during the 
baseline test.
18. For theodolite (standard)-mounted instruments the field form should clearly 
state, if the EDM instrument was attached in the face left or face right posi­
tion of the theodolite (when EDM instrument and theodolite telescope are 
pointing to reflector).
198

19. The levelling of theodolite, EDM instrument and reflector is critical and 
should be done with utmost care. The field form should feature a field, which 
can be ticked upon completion of levelling.
20. Baseline measurements should be carried out either fully during day-time or 
fully during night-time.
13.2.4 Analysis of Baseline Measurements
13.2.4.1 Preprocessing of Data
The following information is required for the preprocessing of the measured data:
- elevation of all stations above a reference level
- offset of all stations from a vertical plane through the first and last station 
- calibration value (additive constant) of barometer(s) and thermometer(s) used.
The measured distances may then be processed as shown below:
1. For each line measured the mean (of four) distance measurements is computed 
as well as the standard deviation of a single distance measurement (SD).
2. The standard deviations (of single distance observations) from all lines are 
plotted versus distance. A simple linear regression leads a reasonable a priori 
standard deviation of distances for subsequent least-squares adjustments:
SD= ±(Amm+Bppm) . 
(13.1)
As the manufacturer’s specifications are totally unsuitable for the estimation 
of the precision of distance measurements on baselines, this is done on the 
basis of the actual measurements. Using the propagation law of variances, A 
may be increased to account for centring errors and B for tempera- 
ture/pressure reading errors, for example.
3. For each line, the corresponding temperature is interpolated (according to 
time) from the temperatures measured, at, typically, 30 minutes intervals and 
corrected for the calibration value.
4. After applying the calibration constant to all barometer readings, the pressure 
readings for all lines may be obtained by interpolation according to time. On 
sloping baselines, the change of pressure with height may have to be taken into 
account (see Appendix C).
5. A first velocity correction K' of the form given by Eq. (6.11), is then added 
to all mean distances. An early average value of the partial water vapour 
pressure e is used as determined for a particular baseline site.
6. Where necessary, lines are corrected for any eccentricities their respective ter­
minals may have from the straight line between the first and last station.
7. Where necessary, an additional correction has to be applied for EDM instru­
ments which are attached to theodolites. However, no correction is required if: 
a) the EDM instrument is mounted on the standards of the theodolite and 
features its own trunnion axis provided that the tilting axis of the reflector 
is vertically above the mark. hEDM and Iiref are measured according to the 
definition in Eq. (13.2).
199

b) the EDM instrument is mounted on the telescope of the theodolite at an 
offset and the reflector is mounted at an offset above a target, with the 
reflector tilting about an axis which goes through the centre of the target, 
provided that the reflector/target is always tilted to point at the theodolite, 
that the theodolite height is entered as hEDM and the target’s tilting axis 
as hREF in Eq. (13.2) below. Refer to Sections 8.1.2 and 8.1.3 for details.
8. Finally, all lines are reduced on the same horizontal reference elevation ER:

where D = corrected mean distance of line i to j 
H = 0.5 (Hi + hEDM + Hj + hREF) 
AH =(Hi + hEDM)-(Hj + hREF)
Hj - elevation of instrument station “i” (in m)
Hj = elevation of reflector station “j” (in m)
hEDM = height of EDM instrument (in m)
hREF = height of reflector (in m)
R = mean radius of curvature of the earth (in m) 
HDjj = horizontal distance from i to j at elevation ER.
All horizontal distances HD are colinear as far as the horizontal component is 
concerned and at exactly the same elevation (ER). The above equation can be 
derived easily from Eqs. (7.1) and (7.28).
13.2.4.2 Review of Baseline Adjustment Options
The available adjustment options depend on whether “true” baseline distances 
are known or not, whether a complete or reduced instrument correction is re­
quired, and on the computers to be used. It has been discussed before that the 
Hobart baseline design requires true distances at all times. The other two baseline 
designs permit the determination of most coefficients of the instrument correc­
tion with or without known distances. Table 13.8 outlines the four major least­
squares adjustment options. Solutions for unknown baseline distances are only 
possible if distance measurements in all (or most) combinations are available. 
This case is restricted to the Heerbrugg and Aarau baseline designs.
The two pocket calculator solutions are described in the next two sections in 
more detail. For the general least-squares solutions, the reader is referred to text 
books on least-squares estimation techniques as well as to Eqs. (13.1) and (12.13) 
for the stochastic and mathematical models, respectively.
The residuals and the standard deviations of all determined coefficients of the 
instrument correction IC should be computed in all four cases shown in Table 
13.8. In the case of the closed pocket calculator solutions, the former should be 
plotted against distance as well as unit length to check for remaining systematic 
(non-linear distance-dependent or long periodic) errors. Both plots of residuals

are also recommended when using general least-squares solutions unless short 
periodic errors are solved for. In this case the plot versus unit length may be omit­
ted. In general least-squares solutions, a large number of coefficients of the IC 
are solved for initially. After testing the statistical significance of the coefficients, 
the least-squares adjustment is repeated with the significant terms only. The 
pocket calculator solutions assume equally weighted data. Correctly weighted 
data are used in general least-squares solutions. It has been shown that correctly 
weighted data provide more consistent coefficients of the instrument correction 
in repeated determination (Elmiger and Siegerist 1977).
13.2.4.3 Determination of Additive Constant and Scale Correction on 
Known Baselines
Linear regression solutions may be used to resolve additive constant and scale cor­
rection from measurements obtained on any of the three baselines designs 
whenever the “true” lengths of the baselines are known.
For y = measured distance [see Eq. (13.2)]
and x = given or “true” distances
the equation of the linear regression line is given as
y = a+bx , 
(13.3)
where y = estimated y for given x.
The closed least-squares solutions for the unknown parameters a and b are as 
follows:
_ (Ex2)(Ey)—(Ex)(Exy)
a —------------ z--------- z-----  
u j.h-j

x= -a/b+(l/b)y .
(13.5)
(13.6)
(13.7)
(13.8)
(13.9)
The first and second terms on the right hand side represent the additive constant 
and the scale correction, respectively.
The following example may demonstrate the necessary steps. A distance meter 
was calibrated on a seven-station baseline. Twenty-one measured and true 
distances are available. Table 13.9 lists the corresponding data pairs. Defining the 
given distances as independent variables x and the measured distances as depen­
dent variables y, the following solutions are obtained:
y =+0.0057 m+1.00000218x 
(13.10)
x = -5.7 mm+0.99999782y 
(13.11)
IC= -5.7mm—2.18(D/1000) , 
(13.12) 
where D = distance (in m)
IC = instrument correction (in mm)
The following standard deviations are calculated

sb = ±2.6 ppm

sa = ±0.8 mm
= standard deviation of the additive constant.
The corresponding 95% confidence intervals are obtained by multiplication with 
2.093 (two-tailed t-distribution, degree of freedom = 21-2 = 19). It follows that 
the additive constant is statistically significant and the scale correction not. As 
the data were obtained on an Aarau-type baseline (all distances being multiples 
of 10 m), the short periodic errors would need to be determined separately and 
the additive constant corrected accordingly. The plot of residuals versus distance 
is omitted here.
13.2.4.4 Determination of Additive Constant and Unknown Baseline 
Lengths
Closed least-squares solutions for additive constant and unknown baseline 
distances from distance measurements in all combinations are available. In this 
context, the solution given by Halmos and Kadar (1972) is used, which provides 
the additive constant as well as the adjusted lengths between the first and any 
other station. This solution gives the precision of the total length of the baseline 
directly. [A number of other authors (Schlichting 1980; Heck and Heil 1981; 
Reissmann 1982; Emenike 1982 a) report solutions for the baseline sections.] The 
method suits pocket calculators well. No approximate values are required as the 
measured values are employed directly.
The Halmos and Kadar (1972) solution is first presented for a five-station 
baseline. The additive constant (here denoted by c) and the four unknown base­
line distances are calculated as:
C=------- [3(S12±S23 + S34 + S45 — Si5) + (St3 + S35 — S25 + S24 — s14)] , 
(13.13)

where = observed (EDM) distance from point i to point j.
§12 = y [2c+2Si2±(Si3 — S23 + S14 — S24 + S15 — S25)] 
(13.14 a)
S13 = ± [4c+2S13 + (S12 + S23 + S14--S34 + S15 - S35)] 
(13.14b)
§14 = y [6c + 2S14 + (S12 + S24±S13+S34 + S|5 — S45)] 
(13.14c)
§15 = X[8c+2S15 + (S12+S25 + S13 + S35 + S14 + S45)] , 
(13.14d)
where Stj = adjusted value of distance between first point of baseline and point 
j of baseline.
The residuals may then be computed from the following relationship:
S^Sij+c+vs* . 
(13.15)

The standard deviation of a measured (input) distance is obtained in the usual 
way from

For baselines with N stations, the formulae for the additive constant c and the 
(N—1) unknown distances may be given as (Halmos and Kadar 1972, 1976; 
Halmos 1977, 1980):
Sij = ^ [2G-l)c+2Slj + ESij] ,
where 2 j N
Sjj = adjusted value of distance between first and j-th point 
Stj = measured value of distance between first and j-th point 
N = number of baseline stations
and where XSy is determined as follows:
N
ESy = Y (Slk + Skj) k =#j 
k = 2
where Slk = measured distance between first and k-th point 
Skj = measured distance between k-th and j-th point.
(If k > j, replace Skj by (-Sjk.)

where m = (N-2)/2 for even number of stations (N) 
m = (N-l)/2 for odd number of stations (N)
and where the polygonal closing errors are denoted by A,. The distance 
misclosures are computed first (m = 1) for neighbouring points, then for points 
spaced by two sections (m = 2), then for points separated by three sections 
(m = 3) and so forth. Rather than trying to define the misclosures A, any further, 
the equations for baselines with 6, 7 and 8 stations are listed as examples.

Substitution of the measured data of Table 13.10 into the above equations leads 
to the following values of the adjusted parameters and their standard deviations:

It should be noted that the given additive constant is provisional pending separate 
tests for short periodic errors. The standard deviation of a measured (input) dis­
tance follows from Eq. (13.16) as ±1.14 mm. The standard deviations of the ad­
justed parameters are computed with the aid of Eqs. (13.32) and (13.33). The 
above least-squares adjustment problem includes 8 unknown parameters and 28 
observations, leading to a degree of freedom of 20. The 95% confidence intervals 
of the parameter may be obtained by multiplication of the standard deviations 
with a factor of 2.086 (two-tailed t-distribution). It follows that the additive con­
stant is (just) statistically significant.
13.2,5 Determination of Baseline Lengths
EDM calibration baselines of known length have at least two distinct advantages 
over baselines of unknown length. Firstly, they permit the establishment of the 
absolute scale [coefficient A10 in Eq. (12.13)] of a distance meter. Secondly, they 
provide a much larger degree of freedom in the least-squares adjustment as the 
baseline lengths need not to be solved for. This leads to a better accuracy of the 
derived instrument correction and/or permits the solution for a larger number of 
terms of Eq. (12.13). (For example, it is unlikely that the solution for the fifth 
degree polynomial (parameters A2o, A30, A40, A50) is feasible in the case of 
baselines of unknown length.) In the case of legal metrology, the baseline 
distances must be known as the determination of the scale of an instrument is of 
prime importance.
207

The “true” lengths of EDM calibration baselines may be established by:
- invar taping
- Vaisala interference comparator
- high precision EDM
- length transfer between baselines
- multiwavelength interferometry.
The first two options are no longer economically viable but were used successfully 
in the past (see Sect. 3.4.3, for example). High precision EDM instruments might 
be used in an absolute mode or in a relative mode. In the former, they provide 
a direct determination of baseline through self-calibration of the additive con­
stant and through laboratory calibration of the on-board master oscillator. 
Single-colour instruments are likely to be used on relative short baselines and two- 
colour instruments on baselines in excess of a few kilometres lengths. In the 
relative mode, they are employed as transfer standards between known (e.g. 
Vaisala standard baselines) and unknown baselines. In this case, calibration of the 
transfer instrument occurs on the reference baseline. (Because of the more com­
prehensive field calibration involved, less sophisticated precision distance meters 
may also be used as transfer instruments between baselines of known and un­
known lengths.)
Multiwavelength interferometers are in development and may eventually per­
mit measuring 100 m directly to interferometric accuracies [refer to Walsh (1987), 
for example]. With such instruments, some sections of baselines may be measured 
directly, with the remainder extrapolated by high precision (or precision) distance 
meters (Holscher 1980; Konttinen 1988) and use of the local scale parameter 
method (see Sect. 5.9.3.5). The use of commercial laser interferometers is a less 
practical alternative, as a rail is required to shift the reflector between stations. 
A commercial laser interferometer was originally used on at least one baseline to 
determine a (41 m) section (Dodson et al. 1981).
The maintenance of the true lengths of known baselines is a major task, in 
particular, if one or more stations prove to be unstable. Pillar movements of 1 mm 
per year are not uncommon. (The author has even recorded cyclic pillar 
movements of 15 mm peak-to-peak over one year and for a particular baseline!) 
It is strongly recommended to select the site for known baselines very carefully 
and to analyze all data from such known baselines in two ways, namely with and 
without the known lengths. Comparisons of computed baseline lengths with 
given lengths will provide a first indication of the stability of a baseline or other­
wise. Unstable baselines need to be remeasured more frequently than stable ones 
with the techniques listed above. Proper deformation analysis techniques may be 
used to track station movements between periodic remeasurements on the basis 
of data gathered with normal EDM instruments (Caspary 1987; Riieger 1983).
13.3 Calibration on Cyclic Error Testlines
The calibration of short periodic errors on “cyclic error” testlines is complemen­
tary (a must) or supplementary (an option) depending on the type of EDM 
208

calibration baseline used for the calibration of the distance-dependent terms of 
the instrument correction.
Complementary measurements on cyclic error testlines are required whenever:
- the instrument correction has been determined on an EDM calibration 
baseline of the Aarau design
- the instrument correction is determined on an EDM calibration baseline of 
the Heerbrugg or Hobart design, which was not designed for the unit length 
of the distance meter in question.
In the former case, the independent determination of the short periodic errors is 
required to remove any bias from the additive constant. As most Heerbrugg- or 
Hobart-type baselines are designed for unit lengths of 10 m, distance meters with 
“exotic” unit lengths such as 33.33 m, 30.77 m and 10.10 m will often require 
separate testing for short periodic errors. However, EDM calibration baselines 
designed for a unit length of 10 m may also accommodate instruments with unit 
lengths of 5 m and 20 m.
Supplementary measurements on cyclic error testlines may be appropriate 
whenever:
— the change of the short periodic errors with distance needs to be evaluated, 
— the accuracy of the short periodic errors determined on Heerbrugg- or 
Hobart-type baselines is not sufficient.
Separate calibrations on cyclic error testlines are therefore required if the variation 
with distance of the short periodic errors needs to be evaluated. This might be 
required to improve the precision of a distance meter or to resolve suspected 
multipath errors (see Sect. 12.2.3). Heerbrugg- and Hobart-type baselines permit 
the detection of short periodic errors but often do not provide sufficient redun­
dant data to determine the short periodic errors accurately enough or with a suffi­
ciently large number of higher order terms. Separate tests may be required in such 
cases.
13.3.1 Design of and Measurements on Cyclic Error Testlines
In this context the discussion on testlines for the calibration of short periodic er­
rors is restricted to simple outdoor facilities which can be easily established. More 
sophisticated indoor facilities are usually based on rails for the movement of 
reflectors and on laser interferometers as length standards (see Sect. 13.1.2). 
Details of an indoor facility may be found in Ciddor (1987) and Riieger and Cid- 
dor (1987), for example.
The general layout for such a test is depicted in Fig. 13.1. The wall should have 
a flat but not necessarily horizontal top. A good quality 30-m steel tape 
(graduated at centimetre intervals) is fixed at standard tension (usually 50 
newtons) and fully supported on top of the wall. A reliable anchorage at the zero 
end of the tape must be assured. For general purpose testing, the EDM instrument 
should be set up on line about 50 to 100 m from the wall and at a height which

Fig. 13.1. Longitudinal section through a cyclic error testline. The pulley and 5 kg weight ensure

wavelength. The axis of the EDM beam (A-B) must be parallel in three dimensions to the axis 
of the tape (C-D)
makes the line of sight to the prism parallel to the steel tape and thus the top of 
the wall.
To test an EDM instrument with a unit length of 10 m (modulation wavelength 
of 20 m), the reflector is placed on the 1.0-m mark in such a way that one 
footscrew of the tribrach points to the distance meter. The edge of the tribrach’s 
footplate pointing to the instrument is aligned precisely with the tape mark. The 
tribrach is levelled and the distance measured (e.g. four times). The reflector 
assembly is then moved to the tape marks 3.0, 5.0, 7.0, 9.0, 10.0, 8.0, 6.0, 4.0, 2.0 
in turn, measuring distances to the reflector at each of these set-ups. This pro­
cedure yields ten distances equally spaced over the 10-m unit length. For higher 
resolution, the reflector may be shifted in 0.5-m or even 0.25-m intervals instead 
of the 1.0-m interval described here.
Critical are, first, the accuracy with which the reflector’s tribrach can be posi­
tioned on the tape and the accuracy of the tape graduations as such. The latter 
is specified by the German standard for steel tapes as ±(0.2 mm+100 ppm), being 
the maximum deviation from nominal (in mm) between any two marks at 20°C 
and 50 newtons tension. A distance between two marks 10 m apart would there­
fore be accurate to at least 1.2 mm. A corresponding setting accuracy of the reflec­
tor’s tribrach on the tape of ±0.2 mm can be achieved.
To match the tape’s scale uncertainty of 100 ppm may prove more difficult. 
The appropriate ppm correction for the distance meter is usually less than 
50 ppm, and may be ignored. Otherwise, the ppm correction can be easily set on 
most distance meters. Changes in air temperature are more critical. Assuming the 
distance meter at a distance of 100 m from the reflector, a change of 10 °C during 
the test will lead to a change of the measured distance of 1 mm and thus to a scale 
error of 100 ppm over the 10 m. Should the temperature change more than 5 °C 
during a short periodic error test over 100 m, the distances should be corrected 
or the ppm-dial reset whenever necessary.
Furthermore, the average scale of the tape during the test should not differ 
significantly from true scale. Quoting the German standard, the difference will 
be less than 100 ppm at 50 newtons and 20°C. It can be assumed that this value 
could be reduced considerably by calibration of the steel tape. If a tape is not at 
210

20 °C (or standard temperature), a scale error of about 10 ppm per degree Celsius 
will result. It is therefore suggested to apply an average correction to the tape mea­
surements whenever the average field tape temperature differs by more than 5 °C 
from the standard temperature.
It is suggested that the tape (and its support) be shaded on clear days and the 
tape temperature measured directly, for example, with contact thermistor ther­
mometers. On overcast days, the air temperature may be substituted for the tape 
temperature; therefore overcast days are best suited for short periodic error tests.
A last effect to be considered is the change of the tape temperature during the 
test. Again, should this temperature change by more than 5 °C, it should be taken 
into account. Such changes are likely to occur only on clear days and for unshad­
ed tapes if conditions change from wind-still to windy and/or from clear to over­
cast (Angus-Leppan 1979).
The measures to be observed to ensure correct EDM and tape scale should be 
selected on the basis of the precision required for the short periodic error deter­
mination. For example, a residual scale error of 100 ppm or 1 mm/10 m produces 
a fictitious error of 0.3 mm amplitude and 10-m wavelength, as well as errors of 
shorter wavelengths and smaller amplitudes.
This induced error is well below the intrinsic resolution of standard EDM in­
struments. Scale is therefore not a serious problem whenever induced periodic er­
rors of up to 1 mm amplitude are acceptable. Also, the measurement sequence 
suggested above, namely, to measure every second data point in a forward and the 
remaining points in a reverse sense, tends to compensate linear changes in air and 
steel tape temperatures which occur during the test.
Cyclic error testlines can be integrated with EDM calibration baselines by 
building of a, say, 35-m-long wall (or other structure) beyond one of the two ter­
minal stations. This then permits the determination of short periodic errors from 
each of the (typically seven) baseline stations and at increasing distances to the 
full length of the baseline.
13.3.2 Semi-Graphic Determination of Short Periodic Errors
The reductions are made according to Table 13.11. The resulting s* values are 
subsequently plotted as a function of distance as shown in Fig. 13.2 (unit length 
in this example is 10 m).
In Fig. 13.2, s* is plotted as a function of s and the mean of s* is drawn as 
a line. A sine curve of 10 m wavelength (unit length in this example) with its axis 
as s* mean is now fitted to the data. The correction to the original additive con­
stant de for an exact multiple of the unit length (here 10 m) is obtained as the dif­
ference, in ordinate s* between the estimated sine curve of the short periodic error 
and s* mean. The correction de, which is required to remove the bias from an ad­
ditive constant c (or the instrument correction IC) established on an Aarau-type 
EDM calibration baseline, is taken as positive if the curve for this abscissa is 
above the line of s* mean and negative if the curve at this point is below s* mean. 
In this example (see Fig. 13.2), de is equal to +8 mm for s = 100 m or for 
s = 110 m (multiple of unit length =10 m). Together with the additive constant c

determined on a baseline of the Aarau design the total additive constant ctot then 
yields
Ctot = c+dc . 
(13.31)
The total additive constant is equivalent to the first parameter Aoo of the in­
strument correction as defined by Eq. (12.13). It is important that the supplemen­
tary correction de is required only if the corresponding additive constant is deriv­
ed from measurements on Aarau-type EDM calibration baselines. There is no 
such simple way of correcting for the bias caused by short periodic errors in ad­
ditive constants derived from Heerbrugg- (and Hobart-) type baselines. Refer to 
Sections 13.2.1.2 and 13.2.1.4 for a discussion of the effect (and its removal) of 
short periodic errors on additive constant (and scale) in the case of Heerbrugg 
and Hobart baseline designs.
212

The correction (cy) for short periodic errors may be derived graphically from 
Fig. 13.2, irrespective of the design of EDM calibration baselines used, cy is defin­
ed as the interval between the estimated cyclic error curve and s* mean for a cer­
tain fraction of the unit length, cy is taken positive if the curve is below s* mean 
and negative if the curve is above the s* mean line.
The short periodic error correction (cy) is equivalent to the Bh and Ch terms 
in the general formula for the instrument correction in Eq. (12.13). In practice, 
short periodic error corrections (cy) may be omitted whenever their magnitude is 
below the stated accuracy of the distance meter or below the accuracy re­
quirements of a particular survey task. The accuracy of the determination of the 
short periodic error correction can be improved by moving the reflector in shorter 
steps (rather than the 1.0-m intervals shown in Table 13.11 and Fig. 13.2, steps 
of 0.5 or 0.25 m may be selected) and by replacing the semi-graphic solution by 
a rigorous least-squares adjustment. The latter option is discussed below.
13.3.3 Analytical Determination of Short Periodic Errors
First-order short periodic errors (cyclic errors) may be described by the following 
expression (Pauli 1977b; Halmos 1980; Rtieger 1978)
CE = At sin [(2n)/U(S+Bt)] , 
(13.32)
where Ai is the amplitude of the error, U is the unit length, S is the measured 
distance, Bt is the phase of the error, and CE is the error caused at the distance 
S.
The above equation may be developed into the following form, using well- 
known identities:
CE = At [sin(2kS/U)cos (2kB1/U)+cos (2kS/U)sin(2KB/U)] . (13.33)
Considering the substitutions
bj = At cos (27CB/U) ; at = At sin (2kBj/U) , 
(13.34)
the first-order short periodic error can be given in a form better suited for com­
putations (Couchman 1974; Halmos 1980; Sprent and Zwart 1978; Witte and 
Schwarz 1982; Emenike 1982 a, b)
CE = at cos (27tS/U)+b1 sin(2kS/U) . 
(13.35)
Considering all short periodic errors to the n-th order, the combined error 
(CE') yields: 
n 
n
CE'= J aj cos [(27rS/U)j]+ £ b,sin [(2nS/U)j] . 
(13.36)
j=i 
j=i
The original form of periodic errors [see Eq. (13.32)] may be reproduced using 
the equations below, which follow directly from Eq. (13.34):
Aj = (a?+b2)1/2 ; B, = (U/2n) arctan (aj/bj) . 
(13.37)
213

It is now assumed that the total number of m observations (equally distributed 
over a unit length U) has been made during a short periodic error test with:
mD = U , 
(13.38)
where the spacing of the measuring points is denoted by D. Therefore, in terms 
of fractions of the unit length, the measurements have been made at the points:
0,D,2D,... (m—2)D,(m—1)D . 
(13.39)
For each of the m measurements, an observation equation of the following 
form can be formulated:
n 
n
si+vi = Si + S ajcos[(27cj/U)Si]+ £ bj sin [(2jc j/U)SJ , 
(13.40)
j=i 
j=i
where Sj = i-th distance measurement
Vj = residual of i-th measurement
Sj = adjusted distance to i-th tape mark
i = 0,1,2,3,.. .,(m-l)
j = degree of periodic error = 1,2,3,4,.. .,(n)
aj = adjusted amplitude of j-th cosine-term
bj = adjusted amplitude of j-th sine-term 
m = total number of observations
n = highest order of periodic error considered where m > (2n+l).
Assuming that the tape graduations and thus the increments D are free of er­
ror, the parameter Sj may be replaced by:
Si = S0+iD , 
(13.41)
where D is equal to U/m and So is equal to the adjusted distance to the nullth 
reflector position (i = 0). The latter should ideally be an exact multiple of the unit 
length U.
Defining as in Table 13.11:
m-1
s^Sj-iD and s* = (1/m) £ sf 
(13.42)
i = 0
the adjusted distance So may be expressed as:
S0 = s* + ds . 
(13.43)
Substitution of Eqs. (13.42) and (13.43) into Eq. (13.40) and considering the 
substitution
Ej = (2n/U)(s* + ds+iD)
yields the following observation equations:
(13.44)

n
Ij+Vj = ds+ Y ajCos(jEi)+ £ bj sin (jEj) , 
j=i j=i
(13.45)
where

li = Si*-s* . 
(13.46)
Equation (13.45) leads to the classical case of a harmonic analysis where m 
values Yj (here lj) are known for the corresponding m abscissa values x (here Ej), 
with the Xj equally distributed from 0 to 2tc. The solution for all the unknown
parameters ds, aj, and bj are given by Carslaw (1950) as follows:
m-1
ds = (1/m) £ lj
(13.47)
i = 0
m-1
aj=(2/m) £ [IjCOsGEj)] ; j#=(m/2)
(13.48)
i = 0
m-1
bj = (2/m) £ [liSinGEj)] ,
(13.49)
i = 0
where m > 2j + l.
Substitution of Eqs. (13.46) and (13.42) in Eq. (13.47) leads to 
ds = 0 ,
(13.50)
which means that Ej reduces to: 
Ei = (2jt/U)(s*+iD) .
(13.51)
The standard deviation sEDM of the observed distances (in fact, 1,) about the ad­
justed cyclic error curve CE' is computed as:
sEDM= ±(Ev?/f)1/2 , 
(13.52)
where f = degrees of freedom = m-2j-1.
The standard deviations of all Fourier coefficients aj, bj are equal to
saj = sbj = sEDM(2/m)1/2 . 
(13.53)
The significance of each individual coefficient is investigated by testing its dif­
ference from zero statistically. A coefficient is not significantly different from 
zero and may be ignored for practical purposes if the following unequality is 
fulfilled
(a/sa.)<tfjO , (bj/sb.) < tf>o , 
(13.54)
where t denotes the test statistic (t-distribution)
a = level of significance (two-tailed test) and 
f = degree of freedom.
Application of the propagation law of variances to Eq. (13.36) yields the stan­
dard deviation of short periodic error correction (cy):
Scy = sEDM(2j/m)1/2 
(13.55)
where j = number of wavelengths represented in the short periodic error correc­
tion (cy).
215

As an example, the data of Table 13.11 are evaluated using the analytical method 
described above. Only the results are given [a fully worked example may be found 
in Rueger (1986)]. A first solution for short periodic errors of orders one to four 
establishes the two components of the first-order short periodic error as the 
largest terms. (The sine term of the third-order short periodic error featured the 
next largest amplitude of 0.5 mm.) A second solution for the first-order terms on­
ly of the cyclic error leads to
CE' (mm) = 8.34 cos (E)+0.98 sin (E) , 
(13.56)
, 
_ . j. D2tc
where E (rad) =..—..
and D = measured distance (m)
U = unit length (m)
number of unknown parameters = 3
number of measurements =10
standard deviation of input distance (sEDM) = ±0.71 mm
standard deviation of Fourier coefficients (sa.,sb.) = ±0.32 mm.
The statistical significance of the coefficients is then tested on the basis of Eq. 
(13.54). The critical t-value amounts to 2.36 in this case. Both coefficients are 
found to be significantly different from zero.
The short periodic error correction (cy = -CE') may then be written as
cy = -8.34 cos (E)—0.98 sin (E) , 
(13.57)
where the first and second coefficients are equivalent to Btl and Cn of Eq. 
(12.13).
Assuming firstly that the same distance meter was calibrated on an Aarau-type 
EDM baseline and secondly, that the data of Table 13.9 as well as the instrument 
correction of Eq. (13.12) refer to the same distance meter, the supplementary ad­
ditive correction de may be computed and both de and cy added to the instrument 
correction. The instrument correction as computed in Section 13.2.4.3 is repeated 
here:
IC= —5.7mm-2.18(D/1000) . 
(13.12)
The supplementary correction de computes easily as the short periodic error at 
an exact multiple of the unit length. At multiples of the unit length (here 10.0 m) 
the cosine and sine in Eq. (13.56) become 1.0 and 0.0 exactly. Therefore:
de = +8.3 mm . 
(13.58)
Adding de and cy to the IC above leads to the final instrument correction (in mm)
IC = +2.6 mm—2.18 (D/1000)—8.34 cos (2tiD/U)
—0.98 sin (2D/U) , 
(13.59)
where the arguments of the trigonometric functions are taken in radians and the 
distance D in metres.

13.4 Calibration of Modulation Frequency
The calibration of the master oscillators of EDM instruments is typically carried 
out in addition to baseline measurements. Frequency calibrations are usually not 
carried out by the EDM instrument user. Frequency calibration services are 
typically provided by EDM instrument service organizations, national standard 
laboratories, registered testing laboratories as well as some universities. All orga­
nizations can provide spot measurements of frequency at ambient temperatures 
in order to determine the ageing of the oscillator’s crystal [see parameters A10 
and A14 in Eq. (12.13)] and, if required, the warm-up effect [see parameters A15 
and A16 in Eq. (12.13)]. It should be noted that frequency checks are straightfor­
ward as long as the distance meter is equipped with a frequency output socket. 
As most instruments do not have such sockets as standard features, frequency 
testing laboratories outside instrument-specific service organizations require in­
formation from the instrument manufacturer as far as the preferred mode of fre­
quency measurement is concerned.
The determination of the frequency versus temperature characteristic [see Fig. 
12.2 and parameters A10 to A13 of Eq. (12.13)] requires an additional piece of 
equipment in the form of a refrigerator/incubator which permits stabilization at 
any temperature within the EDM instrument’s specified temperature range. Local 
agents of EDM instrument manufacturers usually do not own such devices and 
are therefore unable to determine the said temperature characteristic. Such 
facilities are available at EDM instrument factories and at some university depart­
ments.
It is important to realize that the parameter A10 of the instrument correction 
(IC) in Eq. (12.13) is caused in part only by the frequency offset of the main 
oscillator. Any parameter A10 determined by frequency measuring techniques 
should therefore be verified on baselines of known length. Traditionally, an excep­
tion has been made for long range distance meters employing HeNe lasers in com­
bination with continuous modulation through electro-optical crystals. As there 
are few EDM calibration baselines of, say, 30 km length with known distances, 
the additive constant is determined on shorter baselines and the scale correction 
(A10) is derived from frequency measurements alone.
13.4.1 Frequency Measuring Techniques
A laboratory for the frequency calibration of distance meters requires a frequency 
counter for frequencies to usually about 50 MHz and with a display of at least 
8 significant digits. (For the frequency calibration of the Kern Mekometer 
ME 3000, a 500 MHz counter is necessary.) The internal or external time base of 
the frequency counter should have an accuracy specification of about 1 part in 
108 between 0 and 50 °C. The frequency counters should be calibrated themselves 
periodically against the (national) standard of time either by direct comparison 
with a counter of superior specifications or indirectly with the aid of time transfer 
techniques based on radio broadcasts, television transmissions or GPS time 
signals receivers.
217

The modulation frequency of distance meters may be tapped as follows for 
connection to the counter:
— cable to test points on printed circuit board
- permanent frequency output socket on EDM instrument
- induction loop either inside or outside instrument
- opto-coupler (EDM instruments with continuous emission)
- opto-coupler with phase locked loop (EDM instruments with chopped emis­
sion).
The first option is sometimes available without opening of the instrument (e.g. 
Topcon GTS-2). In most cases, the relevant test points must be ascertained from 
the manufacturer and the instrument opened. As the instrument requires sealing 
of the case on completion of the measurement, the method should normally not 
be used. Permanent frequency output sockets are available on some instruments, 
either as a standard feature or as an optional extra. It has been shown experimen­
tally that the attachment of cables can change the modulation frequency by 
0.2 ppm. It has also been established that frequency measurements on open and 
closed instruments may differ significantly. Differences of 0.7 ppm and 0.4 ppm 
were reported by Sobotta et al. (1980) and Riieger (1982). It follows that cable 
connections and opening of instruments should be avoided where possible. Induc­
tion loops have been successfully used but may also require opening of the instru­
ment due to the heavy shielding of modern instruments.
Opto-couplers are routinely used by some manufacturers for frequency testing 
and adjustment of EDM instruments in order to avoid secondary effects of cables 
and open cases as well as to improve the efficiency of servicing. Opto-couplers 
consist of a complete EDM receiver section with lens, photodiode and necessary 
drive and amplification circuits [see Riieger (1982) for a full description]. As long 
as a distance meter features an operating mode with an uninterrupted emission 
of the modulated signal for extended periods of time, the opto-coupler is simply 
set up in front of the transmitting telescope. After alignment (collimation) of the 
two telescopes (of EDM instrument and opto-coupler), the opto-coupler supplies 
the modulation signal to the counter. The method is not applicable in this simple 
form whenever the distance meter transmits a chopped rather than a continuous 
signal. Phase locked loops have been built to bridge the missing gaps in the 
transmitted signal and to supply a continuous signal to the frequency counter 
(Sobotta et al. 1980). Some problems are experienced with instruments which 
switch the phase of the modulation signal or turn themselves off after a certain 
period with no distance measurements.
13.4.2 Calibration of Ageing and Warm-up Effects
As the modulation frequency of a distance meter is dependent on the temperature 
of its quartz crystal, periodic calibration of the frequency must be carried out 
under well-defined conditions. The calibration must occur at a specific ambient 
temperature, after a specific number of minutes of continuous operation as well 
as after (and during) operation in specific measuring mode (e.g. tracking mode) 
218

as all three parameters affect the oscillator’s temperature. Failure to do so will 
result in the ageing results being biased by secondary effects. To establish the age­
ing rate [or parameter A14 in Eq. (12.13)], the frequency offset needs to be 
established repeatedly, for example at yearly or half-yearly intervals. If the fre­
quency offset is the sole contributor to the scale parameter in the instrument cor­
rection IC of Eq. (12.13), it may be used to define A10 directly.
The effect of the actual (or measured) frequency (fact) differing from the 
nominal modulation frequency (fnOm) can be compensated by the following cor­
rections
scorr = “ Smeas 
(13.60)
*act
or
/ f 
_f \
_ 
_  _ if xnom Aact i 
/i 'I
bcorr ~' ^meas I 
J Smeas > 
^IJ.017
\ xact /
where scorr is the distance corrected for scale errors. It is evident that the scale 
parameter A10 of the instrument correction becomes then
f —f
A10 = —----act 
(1362)
fact
and is usually given in parts per million.
Example:
fact = 14985412.0Hz (HP3800 S/N 1141A00110 on 6th October 1976, at 
20 °C, after 60 min continuous operation)
fnom = 14985453.0 Hz
Using Eqs. (13.60) and (13.61) yields
scorr = 1.000002736 smeas
and
Scorr = Smeas + 2.736 X 10 Smeas
A10 = +2.7 ppm .
The warm-up effect on frequency may be determined by acclimatisation of the 
switched-off distance meter (e.g. over night, or for 24 h) at a desired temperature 
and by continuous monitoring of the modulation frequency for 1 to 2 h after 
switch-on. Again, the mode of the distance measurements carried out in parallel 
will affect the warm-up characteristic. It is advisable to determine the effect with 
the distance meter in the aim mode as well as in the tracking mode, for example. 
The coefficients A15 and A16 of the instrument correction in Eq. (12.13) may 
then be resolved by least-squares estimation. In most practical cases the warm-up 
effect is minimized by either always measuring with a “cold” (immediately after 
switch on) or a “warm” (fully warmed-up) distance meter in connection with fre­
quency calibrations (A10 and A14) under similar conditions.
219

13.4.3 Frequency Versus Temperature Characteristic
The frequency versus temperature characteristic (parameters A10 to A13) in Eq. 
(12.13) can be established if a refrigerator/incubator unit is available. Again it has 
to be decided if the calibration of the curve is to be carried out with a cold or 
a warm instrument. The latter is often easier as the refrigerator/incubator unit 
needs not to be opened to switch the distance meter on and off. Sufficient time 
has to be given to the distance meter to settle (acclimatise) at a new ambient tem­
perature after a temperature change is induced in the refrigerator/incubator.
Typically, 2 days are required to establish the characteristic between, say, 
-20 °C and +50 °C. The intervals between the setting of new temperatures 
depends on the response time of the distance meter as well as the response time 
of the refrigerator/incubator, typical values being 1.5 to 2 h for 10 °C changes. 
Results of such tests are depicted in Fig. 12.2. The parameters A10 to A13 of the 
instrument correction may be determined by least-squares estimation. More 
details on such tests may be found in Riieger (1978, 1982) and Riieger and Pascoe 
(1989), for example.
13.5 Accuracy Specifications of EDM Instruments
Most manufacturers state the accuracy of their instruments in the following form
s= ±(A+Bd) , 
(13.63)
where A in mm, B in ppm, d = distance (in km).
The variance follows as
s2 = (A+Bd)2. 
(13.64)
Most manufacturers consider the Eq. (13.63) as a standard deviation at 66% con­
fidence level, but use it as a tolerance in their predelivery testing procedures.
The term A includes:
1. phase resolution of EDM instrument
2. maximum amplitude of short periodic error (or average effect)
3. maximum effect of non-linear distance-dependent errors (or average effect) 
4. accuracy of a built-in (preset) additive constant
5. compatibility of reflectors.
Considering short range EDM the term B is either:
1. the range of the typical frequency drift of the main oscillator within the 
specified temperature range (e.g. -20°C-* +40°C) or
2. the maximum error which may be caused by the limited step interval of the 
“ppm dial”.
Please note that there is a very careless mixing of random and quasi-random er­
rors (e.g. short periodic errors) with purely systematic errors (frequency drift with 
temperature). Because of this, the Eqs. (13.63) and (13.64) should not be used as 
220

a priori variances in least-squares adjustments. For example, under homogeneous 
temperature conditions in the field, the distance proportional term is likely to be 
much smaller [see Eq. (13.1) instead].
As mentioned above, most manufacturers tend to specify accuracy rather than 
precision. Some manufacturers, however, specify precision rather than accuracy. 
In these cases, the oscillator specifications and linear as well as non-linear terms 
of the instrument correction are not taken into account.
The meaning of the accuracy specification in Eq. (13.63) may be further il­
lustrated by the following test. In the case of the manual of a distance meter not 
prescribing the calibration of additive constant and scale correction by the user, 
the accuracy specification could be verified by the instrument user as follows: 
Firstly, 14 known lengths are selected which cover the total specified distance 
range of the distance meter. Secondly, each of these distances is measured once 
only across the entire specified temperature range of the distance meter, e.g. at 
—20°C, -10°C, 0°C, + 10°C, +20°C, +30°C, +40°C. This leads to a total 
of 98 observations. In a plot of the errors (measured distance minus true distance) 
versus distance, 68 errors should fall within the error band given by Eq. (13.63) 
and 95 errors should fall within the doubled error band of ±(2 A+2Bd). Natural­
ly, the instrument-specific reflector would have to be used in such a test and the 
user’s instructions would have to be followed closely. Such a test would clearly 
establish if an instrument fulfils the manufacturer’s accuracy specification or not. 
The test is unfortunately of little practical use as it is restricted to localities with 
a yearly temperature cycle between -20°C and +40°C and by the fact that it 
would take one full year to verify the accuracy specification.
In future, manufacturers may adopt the German Standard DIN 18723, Part 6, 
on Accuracy Tests of Geodetic Instruments: Electro-Optical Short Range Dis­
tance Meters (DIN 1985) or a corresponding ISO standard. In such a case, preci­
sion rather than accuracy would be specified, as the German draft standard 
derives the one-term DIN standard deviation according to Eq. (13.16) from mea­
surements in all combinations on a seven-station EDM calibration baseline of the 
Heerbrugg design and of unknown length. The DIN standard deviations are unaf­
fected by scale errors, as the latter map into the unknown baseline distances. The 
additive constant is determined in the same process. The author hopes that the 
manufacturers of EDM instruments will specify the oscillator specifications 
separately after adoption of the DIN (or similar) precision specifications in order 
to convey some information on the accuracy of instruments.
221

Appendix A. First Velocity Correction 
for Precise Electro-Optical Distance Measurement
In most cases of electro-optical EDM, the first velocity correction according to 
Eqs. (6.11) to (6.13) is sufficiently accurate. The said equations are based on the 
refractive index equations given by Eqs. (5.12) and (5.15).
For the reduction of high precision measurements, it is suggested to employ 
the first velocity correction given by Eq. (6.5)
d = AW) d, 
(6,5)
\ nL / 
and to use the equations given below for the computation of the group refractive 
index for light and infrared rays (nL).
The phase refractive index (n) is given by Peck and Reeder (1972) in a two-term 
Sellmeier form as
(n-l)xlO8
5791817 
167909
238.0185-o2 57.362-o2
(A.l)
where o = vacuum wave number
_ 1
X = carrier wavelength in vacuum (in micrometres).
This formula is satisfactory for the representation of all experimental data from 
the farthest infrared IR down to the ultraviolet (UV) (or from 1960nm to 
230 nm). The root mean square deviation of the experimental data about Eq. 
(A.l) amounts to ±0.0018 ppm between 230 and 690 nm and to ±0.0017 ppm be­
tween 720 and 1690 nm (Peck and Reeder 1972). Equation (A.1) fits the data in 
the IR region much better than the Edlen (1966) formula.
Equation (A.l) applies to standard dry air, at 15 °C, with 0.033% CO2 con­
tent. In order to derive the group refractive index at ambient conditions, the effect 
of the CO2 content is removed by division by 1.000162 (Owens 1967):

The coefficient of Dw in Eq. (A.3) has been taken from Owens (1967). 
The group refractive index nL of light and infrared rays has been defined pre­
viously as [see Eq. (5.7)]

223

The first term (dry air) of Eq. (A.10) is valid between 230 nm and 1690 nm 
(Peck and Reeder 1972), 240K and 330K (-33°C to +57°C) and 0-4000mb 
(Owens 1967). The second term of Eq. (A.10) (water vapour) is valid between 361 
and 644 nm, 250K and 320K (-23 °C and +47 °C) and for water vapour 
pressures between 0 and 100 mb or 0-100% relative humidity (Owens 1967). The 
above (simplified) equation provides nL with an accuracy of two parts in 108, 
assuming the validity of the Lorenz-Lorentz equation (Owens 1967).
Owens (1967) published a general formula which is accurate to one part in 
109 and includes a carbon dioxide term. This equation is, however, based on the 
Edlen (1966) refractive index equation which models the infrared region less 
satisfactorily than the simpler Peck and Reeder equation used in this context.
Although it is suggested that Eq. (A.10) be used, Owens (1967) “simplified 
equation” is listed for comparison:

The first bracket term is based on Edlen’s (1966) formula. Equations (A.10) and 
(A.11) differ by less than 0.0015 ppm between 633 nm and 900 nm. Equation 
(A.10) is preferred as it contains less terms and provides a better fit of experimen­
tal data in the infrared region.

Appendix D. Data of a Selection of Electro-Optical 
Distance Meters as Required for the Derivation of the 
First Velocity Correction and for Calibration Purposes
All data have been supplied by the manufacturers or their Australian agents. The 
main modulation frequency and the unit length may be used to compute the 
reference refractive index according to Eq. (6.3). The carrier wavelength is re­
quired for the computation of the group refractive index at standard conditions 
according to Eq. (5.12). The parameters C and D refer to Eq. (6.11) repeated 
below and may be computed from Eqs. (6.12) and (6.13). It should be noted that 
slightly different results may be obtained when doing so as manufacturers may 
base their computations (see C and D in tables) on Edlen’s rather than Barrell and 
Sears’ equation.
For high precision distance meters, the refractive index should be calculated 
according to Appendix A.
The parameters C and D may be substituted in the following first velocity 
equation:
K' = C DP I 1L27e
\ 
(273.15+t) (273.15+t) 
10~6d' ,
(6.H)
where p in mb, t in °C, e in mb.
Note: This first velocity correction applies only if the distance meter is set to zero 
ppm (or equivalent) during distance measurement.

Appendix E. Technical Data of a Selection of Short 
Range Distance Meters
Some relevant technical data of a selection of short range distance meters is given 
in the following tables. The data have been supplied by the manufacturers or their 
Australian agents or have been gathered from information in promotional 
brochures.
The range of the distance meters is given for one prism and three prisms. Both 
distances refer to so-called average atmospheric conditions, the definition of 
which varies slightly between manufacturers.
The standard deviations are specified accuracies for single distance measure­
ments using the most precise measuring modes. The definition has been given in 
Eq. (13.63) of Section 13.5. Values in brackets refer to alternative measuring 
modes.
Most manufacturers supply batteries of different capacities. The smallest are 
listed in the tables.
The beam divergence refers to the angle subtended by the 50% power points 
of the power profile across the beam.
The angular accuracy is relevant for tacheometers, only. For tacheometers with 
either electronic or optical circles, accuracies of zenith angles and horizontal 
directions are listed. For distance meters with on-board zenith angle sensors, the 
resolution of the zenith angle is listed, only.

Appendix F. Technical Data of a Selection 
of Pulse Distance Meters
Some relevant technical data of a selection of pulse distance meters is given in the 
following tables. The data have been supplied by the manufacturers or their 
Australian agents or have been gathered from information in promotional 
brochures.
The range of the distance meters is given for passive reflecting surfaces, an 
acrylic reflector and three glass prisms. The distances refer to so-called average 
atmospheric conditions. The range to passive reflecting surfaces depends heavily 
on the structure of such and on the ambient light.
The standard deviations are specified accuracies for single distance measure­
ments in the most precise measuring modes. The definition has been given in Eq. 
(13.63) of Section 13.5.
Most manufacturers supply batteries of different capacities. The smallest are 
listed in the tables.
The beam divergence refers to the angle subtended by the 50% power points 
of the power profile across the beam.
The length of the emitted IR pulses is given, as is the pulse repetition rate. The 
latter becomes relevant when tracking moving reflectors.

Appendix G. Technical Data of a Selection 
of Long Range Distance Meters
Some relevant technical data of a selection of long range distance meters is given 
in the following table. Separate tables are given for electro-optical and microwave 
instruments. The data have been supplied by the manufacturers or their 
Australian agents or have been gathered from information in promotional 
brochures.
The standard deviations are specified accuracies for single distance measure­
ments in the most precise measuring modes. The definition has been given in Eq. 
(13.63) of Section 13.5.
Long range distance meters usually have a minimum as well as a maximum 
range. Both values are listed. It should be noted that the maximum range refers 
to excellent conditions during day-time, and, in the case of electro-optical in­
struments, to a large number of prisms (possibly as many as 40).
The column “phase measurement” makes a distinction between analogue and 
digital phase measurement. The former is carried out manually.
The beam divergence refers to the angle subtended by the 50% power points 
of the power profile across the beam. In the case of microwave distance meters, 
different antennae with different divergence may be available.

Asterisks indicate prism systems which minimize pointing errors on 
distances and angles [see Eq. (10.27)]. Some nominal absolute reflec­
tor constants are given in brackets. The parameters a and b are defined 
as follows: a = height of prism corner above front plane of prism 
(refer to Fig. 10.4, Sect. 10.2.4), b = distance between horizontal and 
vertical axis of reflector and front plane of prism.
The manufacturing tolerances of parameters a and b are usually better 
than 0.5 mm. However, the tolerance for the Kern ME5000 prism is 
given as ± 0.05 mm.
