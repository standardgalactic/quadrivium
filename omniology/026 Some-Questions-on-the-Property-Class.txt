The property Class
Can we define properties without using the property class?
Yes!
The property class is a convenience class, but we don't have to use it
But it is really convenient and works just fine most of the time!
Where might it fall short?
Reusability
If we want to have the same property (with same functionality) in 
many different classes, having to redefine the accessor methods 
in each of the classes can become tedious
More control
may want more control over a property's behaviors
We'll come back to this when we study data descriptors

Another Question
We saw how to use the property class (and corresponding decorators) to define instance properties
Can we create class properties (that are bound to the class)
à like a class attribute, but using accessor methods
à Yes!
à metaclasses
