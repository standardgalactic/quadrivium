About the Authors
Since 1996, Janine Warner has written more than a dozen books about the 
Internet, including Web Sites Do-It-Yourself For Dummies, Dreamweaver For 
Dummies (all eight editions), the last i ve editions of Teach Yourself Dreamweaver 
Visually, and the Digital Family Album book series (Amphoto Books). 
Janine is the host of a growing collection of training videos for KelbyTraining.
com in Web design, Adobe Dreamweaver, and Cascading Style Sheets. She’s 
also a regular columnist for Layers magazine.
A popular speaker, Janine offers training in techy topics, such as Web design, 
and gives keynotes on Internet trends, the growing importance of the mobile 
Web, social media, and online reputation. Janine is l uent in Spanish and has 
given many speeches in Latin America and Spain.
Janine has worked on large and small Web sites. From 1994 to 1998, she ran 
Visiontec Communications, a Web design i rm in Northern California, where 
she worked for a diverse group of clients including Levi Strauss & Co., AirTouch 
Communications, and many other small- and medium-size businesses.
From 1998 to 2000, she worked for The Miami Herald, i rst as its Online 
Managing Editor and later as Director of New Media. She left that position to 
serve as Director of Latin American Operations for CNET Networks, an inter-
national technology media company.
Since 2001, Janine has run her own business as a writer, speaker, and consul-
tant. To i nd out more about Janine, i nd free Web design training materials,

David LaFontaine’s i rst cellphone came in a backpack and weighed about 20 
pounds, and the closest he got to using gestures to control the phone came 
when it fell on his toe. Despite this early mishap, Dave remains fascinated 
with the promise of these little portable pieces of technology.
He has more than 20 years experience as a journalist, editor, and multimedia 
producer working on a variety of projects in i lm, television, print, radio, and 
the Internet. The Newspaper Association of America commissioned him to 
write two case studies about the promise of mobile advertising, which gave 
him a front-row seat on the tectonic shifts in what is now known as “the atten-
tion economy.” He’s also a popular blogger whose work can be found on Sips 
from the Firehose (www.sipsfromthefirehose.com) and the Mobile Web 
Design blog (www.mobilewebdesignblog.com). Dave is a partner in Artesian 
Media; to learn more, visit his personal site (www.davidlafontaine.com).
Dave has spoken to audiences around the world about the promise of mobile 
and set them loose on GPS-fueled scavenger hunts designed to teach them 
how to leverage the power of content everywhere, all the time. He continues 
to worry about what will happen when we’re all able to plug digital content 
directly into our neo-cortexes, but i gures that by the time this happens, 
there’ll be an app for that.

Dedication
To all those who venture on the mobile Web, and to all who are working to 
make sure they i nd something of value when they get there.
Authors’ Acknowledgments
Janine Warner: Over the years, I’ve thanked many people in my books — family, 
friends, teachers, and mentors — but I have been graced by so many wonderful 
people now that no publisher will give me enough pages to thank them all. In 
this book, I focus on the people who contributed directly to these pages, start-
ing with the fantastic editorial team at Wiley Publishing: Rebecca Huehls, Leah 
Cameron, Jennifer Riggs, Susan Pink, Jeff Noble, and Steven Hayes.
Above all, I have to thank my brilliant coauthor and partner in all things digi-
tal and analog, David LaFontaine. Your sense of humor, your ability to tell a 
great story, and your passion for technology and communication have made 
this a better book, and me, a better person. 
A heartfelt thanks to David Mitchell for providing the haven we escape to 
after impossible deadlines are i nally done. And to my family, my parents, 
Malinda, Janice, Robin, and Helen, my brother Brian, and my brother Kevin 
and his family, Stephanie, Mikayla, Savannah, Jessica, and Calahan, for all 
their love and support.
Special thanks to Gail Rahn Frederick who wrote the section on HTML5 in 
Chapter 5. Gail is a mobile Web enthusiast, instructor of standards-based 
mobile Web development, and the creator of the site Learn the Mobile Web 
(http://learnthemobileweb.com). She’s also the author of Beginning 
Smartphone Web Development: Building JavaScript, CSS, HTML and Ajax-Based 
Applications for iPhone, Android, Palm Pre, BlackBerry, Windows Mobile, and 
Nokia S60 (Apress), an introduction to building standards-compliant Mobile 
Web sites for any mobile device.
Thanks to Lee Andron, Director of Information Design and Strategy for 
Ansible, Interpublic Group’s full service mobile marketing agency. Lee 
generously spent hours on the phone with us, sharing his work and help-
ing us develop a case study on the Microsoft Cloud Web site, which we 
feature in Chapter 6. For all his time, we also want to thank his new baby, 
Grace Elizabeth, and wife Tricia for sharing Lee with us. Thanks also to Sia 
Ea, Creative Director for Ansible, for all her design talent and for her time 
explaining her role in the Microsoft Cloud site project. Special thanks to 
Anouk Pape and Jamie Conner, Central Marketing Group, Microsoft, and the 
entire Microsoft Cloud Site team. 
www.allitebooks.com

Thanks to Jonathan Thaler (www.whenimmobile.com) for sharing his expe-
rience creating multimedia sites for Tori Sparks (www.torisparks.com) 
and Radio Paradise (www.radioparadise.com). Thanks to Andrew Taylor 
(www.taopro.com) for his help with ecommerce site research. And thanks 
to Mark Jenkins (www.mobilynx.net) for his expertise in mobile devices 
and testing.
Most of all, I want to thank all the people who have read my books or 
watched my videos over the years and gone on to create Web sites. You 
are my greatest inspiration and I sincerely enjoy it when you send me links 
to your Web sites. You can always i nd me at www.DigitalFamily.com. 
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
David LaFontaine: I want to thank my parents, Gail and Dave, for making 
trips to the library such a treat when I was young (and for the lifelong love of 
the written word that those trips engendered), and my sisters Linda, Beth, 
and Sara for the lively (ahem) discussions that taught me to always be pre-
pared to examine and logically defend my conclusions. 
A big shout-out goes to all the other ink-stained wretches of the Fourth Estate 
working at newspapers all over the world, laboring to produce the daily 
miracle; I hope that the spread of mobile content helps them regain so much 
of what has been lost these past few years. I also want to thank all the panel 
members, attendees, and innocent bystanders at industry events including 
the Online News Association, OMMA, and Digital Hollywood that I have pes-
tered over the years; some of their patient wisdom is contained in this book.
But always and ever, I want to thank my wife and coauthor Janine, whose 
easy grace and good-humored patience make the nerdy seem glamorous. Esto 
si es amor.

Introduction
I
n the nearly 15 years that we’ve written about Web design, we’ve seen 
many changes — from the early days when you could create only simple 
pages with HTML 1.0, to the elaborate interactive designs you can create 
today.
But just as the Web seemed to finally be coming of age, the rapid growth of 
cellphones and other mobile devices that connect to the Internet is simulta-
neously propelling everyone forward (because these devices make the Web 
available everywhere, all the time) and setting everyone back (because of the 
design limitations of small screens, the limited bandwidth, and other limita-
tions most thought were left behind by now).
One of the challenges of Web design is that Web pages aren’t only displayed 
on different kinds of computers; pages are also downloaded to computers 
with monitors that are as big as widescreen televisions and to devices as 
small as cellphones. As a result, creating Web sites that look good to all visi-
tors is a lot more complex than it used to be, and standards have become 
a lot more important. That’s why in this book, you find out not only how to 
use all the great features in Dreamweaver, but also how to determine which 
flavor of markup language best serves your goals and your audience when 
designing for the wide variety of screen sizes and display limitations of 
mobile Web browsers.
About This Book
We designed Mobile Web Design For Dummies to help you find the answers 
you need when you need them. You don’t have to read this book cover to 
cover, and you certainly don’t have to memorize it. Consider this a quick 
study guide and a reference you can return to. Each section stands alone, 
giving you easy answers to specific questions and step-by-step instructions 
for common tasks.
Want to find out how to test your designs when you don’t have a dozen 
mobile phones of your own? Jump right in and go directly to Chapter 7 on 
mobile testing. Concerned about the simplest feature phones and what 
version of HTML they support? Jump to Chapter 5 for a review of markup 
languages, or go on to any other topic that interests you. Don’t worry about

getting sand on this book at the beach or coffee spilled on the pages at break-
fast. We know that with your mobile device, you can read this book and test 
your Web pages anywhere, and we promise this book (and its authors) won’t 
complain if you take it with you.
Conventions Used in This Book
Keeping things consistent makes them easier to understand. In this book, 
those consistent elements are conventions. Notice how conventions is in ital-
ics? We frequently put new terms in italics and then define them so that you 
know what they mean.
When we include URLs (Web addresses) or e-mail addresses within regu-
lar paragraph text, they look like this: www.mobilewebdesignblog.com. 
Sometimes, however, we set URLs on their own line, like this:
www.mobilewebdesignblog.com
That’s so you can easily spot them on a page if you want to type them into 
your browser to visit a site. You can type domain names with all lower-
case letters, all uppercase, or a mix. Domain names aren’t case sensitive, 
but remember that you must match the case exactly for any part of a Web 
address that comes after the extension, such as .com or .net. So for an 
address, such as www.digitalfamily.com/videos, you must type videos 
in all lowercase.
We also assume that your Web browser doesn’t require the introductory 
http:// for Web addresses. If you use a really, really old browser, remem-
ber to type this before the address (also make sure you include the http:// 
of the address when you’re creating links in Dreamweaver).
Even though Dreamweaver makes knowing HTML code unnecessary, you may 
want to wade into HTML waters occasionally. We include HTML code in this 
book when we think it can help you better understand how things work in 
design view. Sometimes it’s easier to remove or edit a tag in Dreamweaver’s 
code view than in design view. When we provide examples, such as the fol-
lowing code which links a URL to a Web page, we set off the HTML in the 
same monospaced type as URLs:
<A HREF=”http://www.mobilewebdesignblog.com”>Janine’s Blog 
about Mobile Web Design</A>
When we introduce you to a new set of features, such as options in a dialog 
box, we set these items apart with bullet lists so you can see that they’re all 
related. When we want you to follow instructions, we use numbered step lists 
to walk you through the process.

Introduction 
Foolish Assumptions
Most of the Web pages on the Internet don’t work well on mobile phones, a 
limitation that’s increasingly important as more and more people surf the 
Web on BlackBerrys, iPhones, Droids, and other mobile devices.
If this is your first foray into Web design, this book may not be the best place 
to start. We’ve written several guides to Web design that are designed for 
beginners, including Web Sites Do-It-Yourself For Dummies and Dreamweaver 
CS5 For Dummies.
This book is designed for Web designers who already have a basic under-
standing of Web design and want to develop new skills for designing pages 
for the mobile Web. That said, we don’t expect you to be a professional devel-
oper or to know everything there is about Web design. To make sure that you 
can follow along even with just a basic grasp of Web design, we include some 
basic material, such as an overview of XHTML and Cascading Style Sheets 
(CSS) in Chapter 4, to give you a review and to make sure you have a solid 
foundation before you move on to the more advanced chapters on which 
markup languages work best on mobile devices and how to work around the 
limitations of CSS on many cellphones.
We don’t assume you’re a pro — at least not yet. In keeping with the phi-
losophy behind the For Dummies series, this book is an easy-to-use guide 
designed for readers with a wide range of experience.
If you’re an experienced Web designer, Mobile Web Design For Dummies is 
an ideal reference for you because it gets you working quickly, starting with 
basic mobile Web pages and progressing to more advanced page features.
How This Book Is Organized
To ease you through the learning curve associated with any new material, 
we organized Mobile Web Design For Dummies as a complete reference. This 
section provides a breakdown of the four parts of the book and what you can 
find in each one. Each chapter includes an introduction to general concepts, 
step-by-step instructions, and tips to help you understand the vocabulary 
and basic rules of Web design as you go along.

Mobile Web Design For Dummies 
Part I: Designing for Mobile Devices
Part I introduces you to how designing for mobile devices is different from 
designing for the Web, and helps you appreciate what makes mobile dif-
ferent and why following Web development standards is so important. In 
Chapter 1, you find an overview of the mobile Web and the trends that 
are shaping how — and why — Web designers are adapting their sites 
to so many devices. In Chapter 2, we give you an overview of the many 
approaches to mobile Web design, cover a range of design challenges, and 
introduce you to some of the common differences among mobile devices.
Part II: Following Mobile Web Standards
Chapter 3 shows you how to create a simple version of your Web site that 
will work on most mobile devices. Chapter 4 provides an introduction to 
using XHTML with CSS. CSS is the way to create Web page designs.
In Chapter 5, we take you further into markup languages and CSS, delving into 
the many challenges specific to mobile Web design with a review of WML, 
XHTML MP, and HTML 5.
In Chapter 6, we focus on the high-end of mobile Web design and feature 
a real-world case study on a complex mobile launch. We also review how 
device detection works and how you can automatically redirect visitors to 
the mobile version of your site.
In Chapter 7, we take you on a tour of the many ways you can test your 
mobile Web designs with online emulators and programs, such as Adobe 
Device Central, that make it possible to view how a design will look on a 
mobile phone, even if you don’t have the phone. You also find out how 
to publish the mobile version of your Web site by using FTP features in 
Dreamweaver to put your site online.
Part III: Multimedia, Marketing, 
and E-Commerce
In Part III, you discover the limitations of mobile phones when it comes to 
multimedia, and how to get around those limitations with a few special tips 
that make it possible to add audio, video, and even Flash Lite. In Chapter 
8, you find instructions for optimizing images for mobile and using tricks, 
such as using percentages instead of fixed widths, to make your images

Introduction 
and multimedia more adaptable. In Chapter 9, you find out what it takes 
to make a blog mobile-friendly and discover the best mobile templates for 
WordPress and other blogging tools. In Chapter 10, we explore some of the 
best ways to market your mobile site after you launch it. From advertising 
to social media, mobile offers many new advantages with the ability to 
reach people based on geographic location, time of day, and more. In 
Chapter 11, you find out what it takes to make e-commerce work on the 
mobile Web and how Google Checkout makes it easy for anyone to add a 
mobile-friendly shopping cart to their site.
Part IV: The Part of Tens
Part IV features two quick references to help you develop the best mobile 
Web sites possible. In Chapter 12, you find ten design tips to help you over-
come the challenges and take advantage of the best that mobile design has 
to offer. And finally, in Chapter 13, you find reviews of ten great mobile Web 
sites with screenshots that show how they look across multiple devices.

Part I
Designing for 
Mobile Devices

In this part . . .
I
n this part, we discuss how the mobile Web is different 
from the standard Internet. We also discuss how to 
design for the mobile Web with those differences in mind. 
Designing Web pages for cellphones and other mobile 
devices is a bit like going back in time to the early days of 
the Internet, when small computer monitors and limited 
bandwidth restricted what people could create. The 
mobile Internet is best served by creating a smaller, sim-
pler version of your Web site, one that focuses on the 
information and services (such as directions to find your 
store or office) that are likely to be most important to 
someone on the go.

Chapter 1
Understanding What Makes the 
Mobile Web Different
In This Chapter
▶ Getting an introduction to the mobile Web audience
▶ Brushing up with a mobile Web history lesson
▶ Assessing where the mobile Web is now
▶ Planning for the mobile Web future
T
rying to predict the future is always dangerous, particularly when it 
comes to the mobile Web. Experts have been predicting that “this is 
the year of mobile” pretty much every year for the last decade. Cynics point 
to this as proof that the mobile Web is merely a mirage — that the iPhone, 
Droid, and their smartphone brethren are fun little toys, but that they’ll never 
rival the Internet on a computer screen.
The problem with this pessimism is that it doesn’t take into account all the 
advantages that come with the mobile Web, just the obvious limitations.
People put up with all the problems associated with the Internet, on top of 
the uncertain wireless connections, because the power and possibilities of 
having access to all the information — instantly available wherever you are, 
whenever you want — outweigh the little inconveniences. Although trying 
to use most current Web sites on the mobile platform can be an exercise in 
pain, frustration, and the barely suppressed urge to hurl an expensive device 
into the nearest junkyard car-crusher, the pace of technology puts the com-
puting power that used to cost $10 million and fill an entire building at MIT 
into an 8-ounce chunk of plastic that fits in your shirt pocket.
In this chapter, we help you assess your mobile users’ overall needs, recognize 
the limitations of the platform and the new functions available, and understand 
how your Web site can deliver the right resources in the right place at the right 
time — in a way that your visitors can access on any device.

Part I: Designing for Mobile Devices 
Introducing the Mobile Web Audience
Designing for your audience has always been important, but designing for the 
mobile Web is even more complex because you have to design for so many 
different audiences and mobile devices — and do it all in a tiny space.
Your audience is growing
The sheer size of the potential audience for the mobile Web is staggering. 
Selling the first billion cellphones took 20 years; the next billion sold in 4 
years; and the third billion sold in only 2. The next billion will be sold in a 
year, so that by 2011, more people on earth will have cellphones than those 
who don’t.
Most of these last billion cellphones will be bought by people living in rural 
areas of developing countries; people who have never owned any phone in 
their lives, and for whom the prospect of being connected to the larger world 
is absolutely life-changing. This part of the audience will probably experience 
the Web for the first time on the 3-inch screen of a mobile device.
Already, sites like ESPN.com report that on weekends during football season, 
they receive more traffic to their Web site from mobile phones than they do 
from computers. Market researchers for Yahoo! find that in sports bars, sur-
rounded by dozens of giant-screen high-definition (HD) TVs with 5.1 Dolby 
sound, fans had their heads bowed, looking at their cellphones — following 
the up-to-the-minute point totals of their fantasy football teams.
The convergence of this explosive growth in audience size and the restric-
tions (and amazing possibilities) of the mobile Web pose a unique challenge 
for Web designers.
Your audience wants to save time, 
kill time, or socialize
If the Internet was driven by the ability to access words, pictures, videos, and 
sounds, the mobile Web is driven by even more immediate needs. Speaking 
on a panel for the Online News Association, Nick Montes, president of the 
mobile gaming company VivaVision, told the audience that people are driven 
to use the mobile Web for three primary reasons:
 
✓ To connect with their friends and social group
 
✓ To save time or money
 
✓ To kill time

11
 Chapter 1: Understanding What Makes the Mobile Web Different
When users come to your site, they’re reacting to one of these needs. If you 
want them to find you, to be able to use the content that you’ve so painstak-
ingly crafted, and to use the two-way communication of the Web to interact 
with what you’ve done, you need to have a site optimized for the mobile 
Web. This means not only offering the right content, but also employing 
mobile Web design standards to organize that content in ways that mobile 
Web users will be able to use, which we cover throughout this book.
Your audience uses different 
mobile devices
Our goal is to help you design the best Web site you can to deliver the right 
resources in the right place at the right time. We say “the best Web site 
you can” because designing for the mobile Web is still an imperfect science 
and how far you go in making sure your site is optimized for all the mobile 
devices that might ever visit will depend on your budget, skills, time, and the 
return you can expect on your investment. As a result, we include a range of 
options and approaches in this book with the goal of helping point you in the 
right direction to make the best choice for you.
For many graphic artists and experienced Web designers, the restrictions 
imposed to create Web pages that work at the lowest end of the mobile 
Web can make them feel like Picasso being asked to paint bar charts and pie 
graphs using crayons.
But today, the biggest challenge of the mobile Web is not just designing 
within the constraints of the low end, it’s designing mobile sites that take 
best advantage of both the low end and the high end of the mobile spectrum, 
which now includes iPhones, and even iPads, capable doing almost every-
thing that works on the desktop Web, as well as many things that are only 
possible on a mobile device. (We explore some of the design challenges of 
the mobile Web in Chapter 2.)
Your audience may be any age
Never has the divide been more dramatic, or more blurred, among the gen-
erations. The Internet generation is made up of people who use the iPhone 
intuitively and trade instant messages 100 times a day with their friends. But 
grandparents today are different, too. The baby boomer generation may be 
slower to the Web and mobile, but they’re catching on. And don’t forget the 
moms and dads in between those two extremes, or the next generation that’s 
coming along. Toddlers play games on mobile phones before they can talk.

12
Part I: Designing for Mobile Devices 
Evolving Standards: WAP, WML, 
and the Mobile Web
The first mobile Internet experience was very slow and came with hideously 
expensive digital data plans that were available only in certain large markets, 
and even then only in the densely populated areas with clear wireless signals.
Basically, the early mobile Web looked a lot like Prodigy, if you remember 
that early online service. Prodigy had eight bland colors, tiny photos, and 
only a few lines of text per screen. Paging through a story — or, if you were 
really daring and had a high pain threshold, a photo gallery — took both 
saintly patience and deep pockets.
Although the mobile Web seems to be forever moving forward, understand-
ing how early mobile Web sites worked and the technology those sites were 
based on is helpful. You may run into the terms WAP and WML if you’re rede-
signing an old mobile site, and the technologies in use today have evolved 
from these early technologies. The following sections explain what you need 
to know as you begin designing mobile Web sites.
Sizing up WAP, WML, and XHTML
The earliest mobile sites looked a little bit like pictures drawn on the old dot-
matrix printers. The pages were designed within the limitations of Wireless 
Access Protocol (WAP 1.0) in the late ’90s, when programmers first started 
thinking about cramming Web page functionality onto the cellphones of the 
time. (And no, WAP isn’t the sound of designers slapping themselves on the 
forehead when confronted with the restrictions of the day.)
This is where things get a little confusing. Many mobile Web designers and 
experts (who should know better) have gotten into the habit of referring to 
anything related to the mobile Web as WAP. Others use WAP only to refer to 
the simplest, most bare-bones sites, calling them “WAP sites” because they 
were designed using the Wireless Markup Language (WML), which was part 
of WAP 1.0.
Unfortunately, just using the blanket term “WAP site” to refer to all sites 
designed for the mobile Web is both confusing and inaccurate. WAP is a 
series of rules and specifications, not design principles. These rules were 
updated in 2002 with WAP 2.0 to include support for XHTML MP, and just 
about every phone sold since 2004 supports this more sophisticated markup 
language. (You find more on the best markup language options for the mobile 
Web today in Chapter 5.)
www.allitebooks.com

13
 Chapter 1: Understanding What Makes the Mobile Web Different
To make things even more confusing, very few mobile devices in use today 
support only WML content. Many mobile phones sold today support both 
WML and some variation of XHTML. At the high end, sophisticated smart-
phones like the iPhone display Web pages pretty well even if they’re not 
designed with WAP standards. You could say that most mobile Web design-
ers now work in a WAP 3.0 environment, but that term hasn’t caught on, and 
clear standards for WAP 3.0 have not been agreed upon.
In this book, we decided to avoid all the confusion around the term WAP. 
Instead, when we distinguish between Web sites that are designed for mobile 
devices and those designed for computer screens, we use the phrases mobile 
Web and desktop Web, respectively. See the glossary in the “Mobile alphabet 
soup” sidebar in this chapter for a better explanation of these and some of 
the other terms we use throughout this book.
The browser wars and WAP
The browser wars on the desktop Web greatly 
shaped the development of the mobile Web. In 
the late ’90s, Netscape Navigator leapt out to an 
early lead in market share — at one point, nearly 
80 percent of the people accessing the Internet 
did so through Netscape. Then Microsoft 
started bundling Internet Explorer for free with 
every copy of Windows. The two companies 
struggled to dominate the market and competed 
to add features to their Web browsers (“Look! 
Here’s a command to make the text blink on and 
off! Obnoxiously! How cool is that?”) without 
paying attention to the security holes and bugs 
that often caused the program or the entire 
operating system to crash. Chaos, wild swings 
in stock prices, and antitrust lawsuits ensued.
The early mobile Web designers looked upon this 
carnage and shuddered. If that kind of Wild West 
mentality were to take hold on the mobile plat-
form, it could strangle this new medium in the crib.
Broadly speaking, WAP 1.0 sites were all 
about functionality. The WAP 1.0 protocol was 
invented when phones had a minimum of but-
tons to use; trackballs or rocker switches were 
rare, and touch screens like on the iPhone were 
barely a gleam in Apple’s eye. If you think of the 
kind of navigation controls you’d find on your 
ATM screen, well, that’s a pretty good approxi-
mation of what early mobile Web design and 
use is like; there’s a numbered menu, you press 
on keys to move up and down or input very 
basic data. Or you can press a 0–9 button to 
highlight the choices, and then press another 
button to select and move to the next screen.
Additionally, a lot of sites that were designed 
under the restrictions of WAP 1.0 were what are 
known as “walled gardens,” maintained by the 
wireless carriers. Instead of being able to type a 
URL into an address bar to access the news site of 
their choosing, users were restricted to the con-
tent that the carriers allowed them to see, usually 
from content providers that had signed deals with 
the carrier. So while you’d be able to “Push 3 for 
Sports News” and get a list of the latest college 
football scores, you’d never be able to access a 
smaller, more specialized site like “Mid-Atlantic 
Hamster Racing Results” that wasn’t part of the 
content mix the carrier figured would appeal to 
the widest possible demographic.
These days, nearly all mobile phones, even low-
end feature phones, are capable of accessing 
the World Wide Web, and a growing number can 
display Web sites with complex features, includ-
ing e-commerce, multimedia, and so much more.

14
Part I: Designing for Mobile Devices 
Designing low-end mobile Web sites: 
Like Mozart forced to play a kazoo
Much of the look and feel of the mobile Web was established before touch 
screens and was designed to work within the limitations of up/down and for-
ward/back navigation options. Unfortunately, there are still quite a few low-
end feature phones on the market with these limitations, and although many 
of us hope they’ll disappear completely in the next few years, it’s too early to 
give up on them completely if you want to reach the broadest audience.
Navigation menus designed for feature phones often look a bit like the color-
coded Homeland Security terror-alert charts. Multicolored bars are stacked 
horizontally; you either highlight the link you want to follow by pressing the 
buttons (or use a central rocker switch that you can push right/left or up/
down) to move around the screen. If the Web designer was smart enough to 
use Access Keys (covered in Chapter 5), you might also have the option of 
pressing a number key to trigger the link you want.
Although the touch screens of today’s high-end phones are vastly superior, 
the legacy of these early devices lives on. Thus, if you want to reach the 
broadest audience on the mobile Web, don’t let your iPhone spoil you. Many 
people on the mobile Web today still suffer with very limited ways of interact-
ing with Web pages.
When you review the statistics from many popular mobile sites today, you 
find that traffic comes from many different kinds of devices. For example, the 
Microsoft Cloud Site, featured in the case study in Chapter 6, attracts an audi-
ence of relatively high-end users, and not surprisingly, more than 40 percent 
of the audience views the site on a touch-screen device — iPhone (about 
20 percent), iPod (about 10 percent, and nearly 10 percent more arrive via 
phones that use the Android operating system, which also supports many 
high-end Web features. After those three devices, however, the numbers 
drop off sharply and the list of more than 400 devices that represent less 
than 1 percent of the traffic to the site continues for seven pages of 10-point 
type, single spaced.
“The long tail is ridiculous when it comes to mobile devices,” said Lee 
Andron, Director of Creative Development for Ansible Mobile, the company 
that built the Microsoft Cloud site. “We took the top 10 devices visiting 
across all of Microsoft sites and tested on those. We can assure you the 
site will look good on those 10 devices, but after that, you can expect dimin-
ishing results.”
In fairness to Lee and the team at Ansible, the site held up quite well across 
all the devices we used to test it for this book. That’s because Ansible, 
Interpublic Group’s full-service marketing agency, has been developing 

15
 Chapter 1: Understanding What Makes the Mobile Web Different
mobile sites for a long time and clearly understands how to create sites that 
look great at the high end and still work at the low end. (Read the full case 
study in Chapter 6.)
If you’ve only surfed the mobile Web on an iPhone, iPod, Droid, or other high-
end mobile device, you probably can’t appreciate just how challenging it is to 
surf the Web on a feature phone.
To help you appreciate what it takes to design a site that works within the 
limitations, consider how the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) cre-
ated a design that is optimized for the limited navigation options of low-end 
devices. On a well-designed mobile site like the one created by the BBC 
(shown in Figure 1-1), this is the kind of user experience you can expect:
 
Figure 1-1: 
The BBC’s 
mobile Web 
site design 
is easy to 
navigate, 
even on 
a feature 
phone 
like the 
Motorola 
RAZR 
shown here.
 
 
1. You browse to the mobile version of a site by entering the URL into the 
device on a number keypad, which means that you have to press most 
keys multiple times to spell out all the letters in BBC.mobi.

16
Part I: Designing for Mobile Devices 
 
 The BBC site is designed with multiple mobile URLs, including bbc.
com/mobile/i for the iPhone version. But like many well-designed 
mobile sites, if you enter the main URL (bbc.com or bbc.co.uk) into a 
mobile device, the server automatically redirects you to the best version 
of the site for the phone you’re using.
 
 On the main page of the BBC news site, you find the three top stories of 
the day/hour with tiny images and links, optimized to fit well, even on 
the 240-pixel-wide screen of the Motorola RAZR V9 shown in Figure 1-1.
 
2. Scroll down a little further, and you find a few more links with familiar 
section names, including More News, Sports, World, and Weather.
 
 Using short words as links and sticking to common, easily recognized 
terms are good practices on the mobile Web because you need to 
convey a lot of information in a very small space.
 
3. Click any section name to summon a submenu with links to a few more 
items in that category.
 
4. Clicking those links, in turn, leads you to more links or to the text and 
photos of each story.
 
 In this way, a well-designed mobile site guides you to the information 
you seek quickly because you only need to click links to two or three 
fast-loading pages to reach your destination.
 
5. If the story is long, you may have to scroll down a page or two or follow 
a link to continue reading.
 
 The amount of text on each screen is limited because scrolling can be 
challenging on low-end feature phones, such as the RAZR shown in 
Figure 1-1. On a RAZR, like many feature phones, you can only scroll a 
few tedious pixels at a time.
 
6. To move on to another story or another section, you can click the back 
button on the handset of most phones (even feature phones) to return 
to the previous list of links or move on if additional navigation links are 
provided, as they are on the BBC site.
It’s good practice to offer at least a few navigation options on any mobile 
page. As the designer, you must find a delicate balance between enabling a 
visitor to easily find what they want and overloading each page with so many 
links that users have to wait a long time to load the content when they get to it.
If the desktop Web is the information superhighway, using low-end feature 
phones, even on sites that are designed for the mobile Web, can feel more 
like backing out of your garage, driving down your driveway, driving over to 
your neighbor’s driveway, pulling into his garage, and then backing out into 
the street again, only to pull into yet another narrow driveway — while being 
at least partially blindfolded.

Mobile alphabet soup
Some handy definitions to keep in mind:
 ✓ Feature phone: An industry term that was 
originally used to distinguish mobile phones 
that had such advances as cameras or MP3 
players built into them from the first wave 
of mobile phones that were only capable 
of sending and receiving calls. The term 
feature phone is now generally used to 
describe the simplest, low-end phones on 
the market, those that lack typewriter-like 
QWERTY keyboards, large display screens, 
or other more advanced technologies.
 ✓ Smartphone: When technology companies 
like Palm and RIM (the official name of the 
company that makes BlackBerry phones) 
rolled out devices that brought together the 
mini-computer functions of PDAs like the 
Palm Pilot with wireless phone functional-
ity, the industry called them smartphones 
to differentiate them from the more limited 
feature phones. While the lines between 
“smart” and “feature” are blurring, broadly 
speaking, a smartphone is one with strong 
computer-like capabilities. It has a color 
screen, a keyboard that looks like a type-
writer, and storage for music or video, and 
it can run applications or “apps” that allow 
it to do complicated tasks.
 ✓ Touch-screen phone: The most famous 
example is the iPhone, but in the years 
since Apple launched this device, many 
others with a dizzying array of capabilities 
have hit the market. Their distinguishing 
feature is that they have large, high-resolu-
tion color screens. Also, you can use your 
fingers to tap on the screen to type on a vir-
tual keyboard, use two or more fingers to 
click and drag items or pinch and expand 
images, or flick your fingers to make Web 
pages scroll.
 ✓ Dumbphone: An industry term used for 
mobile phones that look like they have the 
hardware features of an iPhone, but lack 
the software to back it. A touch screen 
without a sophisticated Web browser, like 
the Safari browser on the iPhone, can be 
especially misleading because mobile 
sites designed for touch-screen phones 
won’t work well on these poorly designed 
knockoffs.
 ✓ Mobile Web: Anything on the World Wide 
Web that can be viewed on a mobile device.
 ✓ Desktop Web: Used to describe Web pages 
designed to be viewed in Web browsers, 
such as Firefox and Internet Explorer, on 
desktop computers.
 ✓ Open Mobile Alliance (OMA): In June 
2002, this international organization formed 
to develop specifications for the mobile 
Web. One of the things that distinguishes 
the OMA is that they bring together repre-
sentatives from every aspect of the mobile 
industry, including mobile operators, device 
and network suppliers, information technol-
ogy companies, and content and service 
providers. The goal, according to the OMA 
Web site, is to create “interoperable mobile 
data service enablers that work across 
devices, service providers, operators, net-
works, and geographies.” Essentially, they 
want to create standards that work across 
all devices and services, a lofty goal that 
would definitely make the mobile Web a 
better place.
 ✓ Wireless Access Protocol (WAP): WAP 
basically sets down what a mobile Web 
browsing session is, how the phone is 
allowed to talk to the network, how the 
network is allowed to talk back, and how 
(continued)

18
Part I: Designing for Mobile Devices 
(continued)
that communication is to be kept (reason-
ably) secure. WAP 1.0, which restricted the 
mobile Web to very limited technologies, 
such as WML, has been replaced by WAP 
2.0, which supports more advanced tech-
nologies, including XHTML.
 ✓ Wireless Markup Language (WML): The 
first of many programming languages used 
to design mobile Web pages. Documents 
in WML are known as decks, and the data 
in each deck is broken down into cards (or 
pages). WML allows information in a Web 
page to interact with the mobile phone, 
such as clicking a phone number on a WML 
page causes the mobile phone functions 
to wake up, kick in, and call that phone 
number. (You find more information about 
WML and other mobile markup languages 
in Chapter 5.)
 ✓ eXtensible Markup Language (XML): A 
set of rules governing how documents are 
encoded, with the goal of allowing docu-
ments created by different programs on dif-
ferent platforms to share data (such as Excel 
on a Mac sharing data with Word on a PC).
 ✓ Wireless Universal Resource File (WURFL): 
A configuration file that contains informa-
tion about the capabilities of nearly every 
mobile device on the planet. You can 
download the WURFL file for free from 
www.SourceForge.net and use it to 
help you direct mobile phones to the best 
version of your site. (You learn more about 
WURFL and developing for multiple devices 
in Chapter 6.)
 ✓ eXtensible Hypertext Markup Language 
(XHTML): This is a stricter standard for 
HTML, which is the language that Web 
pages are created in. The goal of XHTML 
is to organize the chaos of the Web into a 
stricter set of standards that prevent pages 
from displaying so differently across brows-
ers. (You find an introduction to XHTML and 
CSS in Chapter 3.)
 ✓ XHTML Mobile Profile (XHTML MP): A 
variation of XHTML designed specifically 
for mobile phones. (You learn more about 
XHTML MP and other mobile markup lan-
guages in Chapter 5.)
Assessing the Current State of the Web
If the early years of the mobile revolution were marked by a kind of bemused 
dazzlement that had people using early cellphones to call from unusual 
places (“Hey, I’m standing in the surf on the beach!”), the massive adoption 
of cellphones since then has made people regard them as essential to their 
survival. More than 40 percent of Americans have said that “they could not 
live without” their cellphones; these little devices are integral to life as we 
know it.
There’s only one choice for the device most responsible for taking the mobile 
Web from the Nerds Only Clubhouse into the popular consciousness. And 
this device is the elephant in the room in any discussion of the mobile Web.
 
So here goes: In the mobile Web world, the iPhone changed everything. There. 
We said it.

 Chapter 1: Understanding What Makes the Mobile Web Different
Understanding the iPhone factor
From the moment Apple CEO Steve Jobs strode out on stage to introduce the 
iPhone (shown in Figure 1-2), a kind of over-the-top techno-frenzy enveloped 
the mobile phone industry. Lines of eager Mac fans crawled around city 
blocks waiting for Apple stores to open and sell iPhones on June 29, 2007. 
Before iPhones became available outside the United States, enterprising trav-
elers could buy the iPhone for $300 and sell it on the streets of Moscow or 
Bangkok for $2,000 or more.

20
Part I: Designing for Mobile Devices 
Within weeks of the iPhone’s launch, copycat HiPhones appeared in the 
gray-market stalls all over China. Later models, such as the SciPhone shown 
in Figure 1-3, adapted Apple’s design to the Chinese market, putting in slots 
for two SIM cards so that the owner could have, in essence, two separate 
phone lines in his pocket — one for business and one for personal use. The 
SciPhone costs a fraction of what the iPhone costs; however, like many other 
phones, dubbed “dumphones” by developers, it suffers from uneven quality.
Although those who style themselves to be true “mobile Web purists” often 
sneer at the iPhone as being more hype than substance, the iPhone really 
kick-started the mobile Web revolution into high gear. Apple applied for 200 
patents for new technology for the iPhone. Obviously, something was break-
ing new ground.
 
Figure 1-3: 
The 
SciPhone 
is just one 
of many 
“dumb-
phones” 
designed to 
look like  the 
iPhone.
 
Compared to the clunky navigation of early mobile sites, the iPhone creates a 
new and delightful user experience for mobile content:
 
✓ The multi-touch screen wows people with game-changing interactive fea-
tures, such as the ability to use pinching or opening motions with your 
fingers to shrink or enlarge Web pages, photos, and text.
 
✓ Scrolling is a breeze. Zipping your finger down a Web page or a list 
makes the contents spin past like the wheels in a slot machine.

21
 Chapter 1: Understanding What Makes the Mobile Web Different
 
✓ An accelerometer (a tiny gyroscope) can tell when the phone was 
moved, and in what direction, so shaking the phone can be used to do 
things, like randomly changing the song you listen to on the built-in 
iPod. The accelerometer also determines whether the phone is being 
held in portrait or landscape mode.
 
✓ The iPhone doesn’t come with a manual. It’s so easy to use, that most 
people learn by just playing around with it and figure out things as they 
go along.
The iPhone can be credited with a 500 percent increase in traffic to the 
mobile Web. It was the first mobile device that could display desktop Web 
pages as well as most desktop computers (except for the inability to play 
Flash or other rich-media video technologies). According to AdMob, by 
November 2009, the iPhone and iPod touch accounted for more than 40 
percent of mobile data traffic worldwide — this despite the fact that the 
iPhone still wasn’t available in most markets, and even in the United States, it 
accounted for less than 10 percent of the total phones in use.
Every other month, Apple’s competitors roll out a phone that’s billed as “the 
iPhone killer,” with about as much success (so far) as the challengers to the 
iPod in the digital music-player space. If imitation is the sincerest form of 
flattery, the efforts to replicate Apple’s success are almost embarrassingly 
fawning.
 
What this means to Web designers is that the other phone manufacturers, 
who have already copied the touch-screen format of the iPhone, want to rep-
licate its browsing capabilities, in the hopes of draining some of its market 
share. And, as is inevitable in the technology world, what was once prohibi-
tively expensive quickly becomes affordable — and eventually cheap.
Cellphone technology is a perfect example of this class-to-mass movement 
because the early “brick” phones (so called because the clunky things were 
the approximate size, shape, and weight of a brick) that were such rarities 
in the early ’90s and cost a relative fortune have given way to disposable 
phones that are half the size of a deck of cards and so cheap you can throw 
them away when you’re done with them. Most disposable phones are feature 
phones with shoddy construction that can be purchased without a service 
plan.
By 2011, the prediction is that more than half the cellphones in the United 
States will be the equivalent of smartphones — that is, phones that can 
browse the Web and run stripped-down versions of applications, such as 
Outlook, Excel, Word, or Apple’s App Store.

22
Part I: Designing for Mobile Devices 
The siren song of “apps”
Apple’s ubiquitous marketing campaigns have ensured that anyone more 
connected than a Patagonian llama herder has heard of its App Store (www.
apple.com/iphone/apps-for-iphone); no matter what you want to 
do, you hear, “There’s an app for that.” These commercials promising near-
divine powers were even successfully parodied by the tourism board of Nova 
Scotia, which faked a Web site for its Pomegranate phone that purported to 
include a video projector, live voice translator, harmonica, coffee maker, and 
shaving razor (see Figure 1-4 or visit the site at www.pomegranate.com). 
Although the phone was completely fictitious, it’s not hard to image that all 
these features are in some stage of development in some mobile testing lab 
even as we write this.
An app is a small computer program that runs on your cellphone and causes 
it to do things that the phone normally can’t do. For instance, you can play 
games, use light versions of software programs (such as Word, Excel, or 
Photoshop), or use any of the more than 200,000 apps and counting to wow 
your friends and kill time.
Developers can give away apps for free, hoping to pay for the development 
cost through advertising, or they can charge for it. One early iPhone app — I 
Am Rich — cost $1,000 and did . . . nothing. Well, other than serve to prove 
that you had enough money to be able to waste $1,000 just to brag to other 
people that you could. Apple quickly killed the application but not before the 
developer raked in thousands of dollars from status-crazed app buyers.

 Chapter 1: Understanding What Makes the Mobile Web Different
Still, the media has been alight with stories about 14 year olds making a mil-
lion dollars in a month from the sale of quirky apps. The iFart prank applica-
tion made $10,000 a day, and it spawned other apps, such as Pull My Finger, 
and a long list of updates, including the Rock Band Fart Pack, which features 
the sounds of Fartwood Mac.
The revenues are no laughing matter. Within the first nine months of opening 
the App Store, Apple had 1 billion downloads, of which they take a hefty 30 
percent cut.
The Android Market (www.android.com/market) and BlackBerry App 
World (http://na.blackberry.com/eng/services/appworld) app 
stores are hot on Apple’s heels, and you can expect to hear a lot more about 
apps for the next year or so as developers chase this brand-new revenue 
stream.
But already there’s backlash against apps; advertising agencies host How 
to Talk Your Client Out of Wasting Money on an App seminars. More than 
200,000 apps are swimming around the App Store, with the number growing 
exponentially. This means that as the novelty factor wears off, people will 
realize that they’re paying a premium to build what’s essentially a Web-based 
experience that works only on one kind of phone. Similar to software pro-
grams that can work only on a Mac or PC, separate apps must be designed 
for each kind of phone. Thus, if you want to reach a broad audience with 
an app, you need to create one for the iPhone, another for the BlackBerry, 
another for Droid, and so on.
 
If you work the numbers, you quickly realize that it’s much more cost-effective 
to create one Web site than to have an app or apps, even if you design differ-
ent versions of your Web site for each phone. The bottom line is this: Apps 
are great for games and other highly complex programs, such as Photoshop 
for the iPhone, but for just about anything else, you’re almost certain to get a 
better return on investment by creating a mobile version of your Web site.
Seizing the power of geolocation
One of the things that differentiates the mobile environment from the desk-
top Web is that location sensitivity is increasingly becoming part of the mix. 
From 2008 to 2009, local searches from mobile phones grew by more than 50 
percent, as about 20.7 million users per month started using mobile brows-
ers to find products and services near them. One of the buzz words of 2010 
is geolocation, used generally to mean the act of assessing a location. It is a 
promising capability that is making smartphones smarter and more aware of 
their surroundings.

24
Part I: Designing for Mobile Devices 
Now that GPS receivers are becoming as standard in cellphones as cameras 
are, the business opportunities inherent in local searches are exciting. One 
of the most persistent examples of what this could mean is the scenario in 
which a Web-enabled cellphone user walks through a mall, and her phone 
lights up and shows her special offers from stores nearby. Dozens of mobile 
consultants have trotted out footage from the movie Minority Report where 
the character played by Tom Cruise walks through a shopping mall and video 
screens in the shop windows start calling to him by name, telling him about 
specials tailored to his shopping history, his needs, and other data that is 
stored in a big database. The mobile consultants like to say that this is a 
preview of how the stores of the future will send ads, directly to your mobile 
phone, that use your name and mention that they noticed you were looking 
at new shoes recently. Groups concerned with consumer privacy and govern-
mental agencies like the FCC have held hearings about the dangers of having 
companies know who you are, where you’ve been, who you’ve been with, and 
how long you spent with them. All this information is available to mobile car-
riers, who have solemnly promised that they will safeguard its use.
At this time, leveraging GPS data is a pretty advanced feature, and one that 
the iPhone, for example, has restricted by allowing only native apps to use 
this data. However, the much-anticipated HTML5 standards do include a 
<location> tag to take advantage of this function. It is expected that the 
next few years will see mobile device manufacturers rush to ensure that their 
products will be able to work with this advanced function.
The ability to add geolocation features is one of the most exciting additions of 
the latest markup language, HTML5, covered in Chapter 5. But even if you’re 
not pushing the bleeding edge of Web design with the not-yet-fully-supported 
HTML5 specification, you can take advantage of the fact that most people with 
mobile devices are on the move, and many have maps in their pockets thanks 
to the basic features of their phones and Google Maps. In Chapter 2, you dis-
cover how even if you only create one simple mobile design, you should make 
sure to include your address and a link to a Google map.
Offering deals and data with QR codes
In Japan, the mobile advertising models are years ahead of the U.S. market, 
and they employ sophisticated technologies, such as Quick Response (QR) 
codes. These are 2-D bar codes — you may have seen them on FedEx pack-
ages — that look a little bit like a randomized checkerboard. They can con-
tain up to 4,296 characters of information in them. Scan or photograph a QR 
code and it can launch a browser and navigate to a Web site, add contact 
information to an address book, or dial a phone number, among many other 
things. Putting thousands of characters of data or commands into a little pic-
ture means that advertisers can add rich detail and interactivity to print ads 
(you can find QR codes in a growing number of magazines already). In addi-
tion to enhancing an advertiser’s message, mobile Web designers should take 

25
 Chapter 1: Understanding What Makes the Mobile Web Different
note of QR codes because they can free up users from having to type in com-
plex and lengthy data on the small keypads of mobile devices. You can create 
your own QR code quickly and easily via free Web sites, such as http://
qrcode.kaywa.com, shown in Figure 1-5, or Microsoft Tag, which provides 
similar functions, and is covered in Chapter 10.
 
Figure 1-5:

make it easy 
to create 
QR codes, 
which can 
deliver a 
wealth of 
data when 
they are 
scanned 
or photo-
graphed 
by mobile 
devices.
 
To use a QR code, you generally have to download a small application capa-
ble of interpreting the data. Then just point your phone’s camera at the QR 
code and the application on the phone reads the code and automatically con-
nects to the Web to unlock special content. Here are a few examples of how 
people use QR codes around the world:
 
✓ In Japan, QR codes are printed on escalator handrails in malls; you can 
point your phone at any code and get messages and discounts, like an 
offer for 20 percent off a haircut at a salon a couple of floors up.
 
✓ QR codes are huge, literally. In Figure 1-6, you see a QR code that was 
printed on the side of a skyscraper so you can easily access the Web site 
of the company that owns the building.
 
✓ In San Francisco, restaurants put the QR codes in their windows. 
Passers-by who are interested in the restaurant can point their phone at 
the code, click, and then receive reviews of the restaurant, descriptions 
of the menu, and a link to make a reservation.

✓ In England, Ford organized a mobile campaign to publicize its new Ka 
car. They printed stickers with QR codes on them, and when users 
pointed their phone cameras at them, up popped an image of the car 
on the phone’s screen. As the users twisted and turned the phone, the 
car on the screen rotated and eventually revealed a secret code that led 
users on a scavenger hunt.
You learn more about QR codes and a similar technology by Microsoft called 
Tags in Chapter 10.
Watching video anywhere, anytime
The mobile phone has been termed the third screen, with television as the 
first and the computer monitor as the second. Already ads promise seamless 
experience of movies and TV shows from one screen to another — so that 
you can start watching a TV show on your big-screen HD monitor at home, 
walk out the door, keep watching it on your phone, and finish by gazing at 
the computer screen in your office or on your laptop at a coffee shop.
The growth of video on the mobile phone is something akin to the Loch Ness 
Monster — long rumored, but it somehow never quite shows up. Until now, 
that is.

27
 Chapter 1: Understanding What Makes the Mobile Web Different
 
In the last year, the growth in online video has been phenomenal. Forty-five 
percent of college students now shoot, send, and receive video on their 
mobile devices, and almost half the videos on Facebook are now coming in 
from mobile device uploads. This video production used to require $20,000 
video cameras, control rooms full of technicians, and fenced-in yards of satel-
lite dishes. Now, you can shoot video with your phone and stream it live to a 
worldwide audience, from anyplace that has a robust wireless signal.
Researchers measure time spent using media to see how popular various 
forms of media are with the public. As of 2009, college students spend about 
2.5 hours per day watching TV — an amount that might seem low to parents 
of teenagers. But those same students spend 2.4 hours per day interacting 
with their mobile phones — texting, calling, surfing the Web, listening to 
music, watching video, playing games, or using apps.
Designers who want to add video to their sites have two basic choices:
 
✓ Rely on an online video-hosting site like Vimeo or YouTube that has 
carefully built up transcoders and detection scripts that allow it to serve 
up the appropriate format of video to the users’ devices.
 
✓ Customize the video into formats appropriate for the most popular 
devices that will access the site, and use sophisticated detection scripts 
to route users to the appropriate version of the video for their devices.
You find more on adding video to your mobile Web designs in Chapter 8.
Appreciating privacy issues
The mobile phone is a very personal medium for each user. For instance, 
most people don’t share their mobile phones, they take them everywhere 
they go, and their phones become an essential part of their lives. Research 
shows that users notice that they’ve left their phone behind in a restaurant 
or at a friend’s house within an hour; in contrast, it usually takes about half a 
day before they realize that their wallet is missing.
Take a second and think about all the things that a modern cellphone knows 
about you:
 
✓ It knows who all your friends are — they’re in your phonebook — how 
often and what time of day you call them, and how long you talk.
 
✓ If your phone has GPS, your phone knows where you live, where you 
work, how long your commute is, where you like to go out for lunch, and 
whose house you go to on weekends to watch football.

28
Part I: Designing for Mobile Devices 
 
✓ If you use it to browse the Web, your phone knows what sites you like to 
visit and where you are when you access them.
 
✓ Like to take photos with your phone? It sees everything you see through 
the camera lens.
 
✓ If you use your phone to communicate, it knows what kinds of instant 
messages (IMs) and e-mails you send, and who you send them to.
 
✓ With advanced sensors in phones that allow you to talk via Bluetooth to 
your cars, your home entertainment systems, and even your shoes, your 
phone can tell what kind of car you drive, what movies or TV shows you 
like to watch, and how often you really go to the gym.
 
✓ If you use mobile coupons to shop, it knows your favorite brands and 
what kind of a discount it takes to make you change your mind and try a 
new product.
 
✓ If you’ve used the phone to check on your bank accounts, with the ever-
more-popular mobile-banking applications, your phone knows what 
bank you’re with, how much money you have in your accounts, what 
your passwords are, and what the routing and transfer numbers for your 
accounts are. Your phone even knows what stocks you follow, where 
your IRA or 401(k) is, and how involved you are in planning for your 
retirement.
Just listing all these data points that are trackable and recoverable from your 
phone should make you take a second look at the possible little snitch in 
your pocket.
Web designers will find that the next couple years are critical for privacy — 
the breaches of information security that lead to users’ credit card numbers, 
Social Security numbers, and medical records leaking onto the Web are noth-
ing compared to the damage that can be done with a hacked phone. Because 
the phone is connected to all kinds of information about you, identity theft is 
much more devious and harder to counter; it also makes it possible for gov-
ernments, business rivals, or obsessed ex-spouses to track your every move 
and intrude on your life — to cyber-stalk you with ruthless efficiency.
Mobile Web designers need to be aware of the tightrope they walk with their 
users’ privacy. While making Web sites as efficient as possible by tailor-
ing them to a user’s needs and preferences — time of day, place, situation, 
behavior and searches, contextual awareness (that is, searching for cardinals 
in a football stadium, in the Vatican, or in a forest) — designers must also 
ensure that all that information is safeguarded. Abusing your user’s trust is 
the quickest way to get a whole bunch of people mad at you, and quite possi-
bly a whole bunch of lawyers suddenly very interested in suing you.

29
 Chapter 1: Understanding What Makes the Mobile Web Different
 
Mobile Web designers should keep in mind that their users may lose their 
device or have it stolen, and, in response, they should build sites that don’t 
automatically allow whoever currently has the device to log in to secure ses-
sions without having to input a password. As you design Web sites, make sure 
you use a secure Web server, and if you collect personal data, include a pri-
vacy policy that informs visitors to your site how you may use their data.
Planning for the Future
Futurists, like Ray Kurzweil, have extrapolated the exponential increases in 
computing power and decreases in size. They predict that in 20 years com-
puters will be as powerful as laptops and the size of blood cells, allowing 
Olympic athletes to run for 15 minutes without having to take a breath.
Although having a phone hardwired directly into your brain appeals to cer-
tain readers of cyberpunk science fiction stories, back in the real world, very 
few people are likely to want to have prank calls beaming into their frontal 
lobes at 4 a.m.
That said, the next generation of phones coming out stretches the limits of 
designers’ imaginations. Just consider these examples:
 
✓ A phone that’s also a wristwatch: Thought up by Japanese phone com-
pany NTT DOCOMO. To answer the phone, you snap your fingers and 
stick your finger in your ear. The sound vibrations are sent via the bones 
in your wrist and hands, through your fingers, and directly into your 
eardrum. You talk into your pinkie and hang up by snapping your fingers 
twice.
 
✓ A phone with a screen that stretches like stiff Silly Putty: If you want 
the image you’re looking at to get bigger, you just grab the sides of the 
phone and pull.
 
✓ Waterproof phones: Designers apparently forgot that it’s hard to say 
more than a sentence underwater without choking. Perhaps they’re 
chasing the mermaid market segment.
 
✓ Perfume dispensers: The phone shown in Figure 1-7 looks like a melting 
bar of chocolate, and you can buy a perfume pack that makes it smell 
like one, too. These are nice in theory. The problem with this convenient 
design wasn’t that women didn’t want to be able to re-apply perfume 
before a hot date, it was that too many users hit the wrong key while tex-
ting and accidentally spritzed themselves in the eyes.

30

Figure 1-7:

DOCOMO’s

yummy as it 
looks.
 
 
✓ Built-in tasers: See unfortunate accidents mentioned in the preceding 
bullet.
 
✓ Phones built into the grip of a Glock semiautomatic pistol: Again, see 
the earlier bullet.
 
✓ A recyclable phone made out of organic components: The phone was 
made out of hay sprayed with resins, but it dissolved into green goo 
when it rained, when users’ hands were sweaty, or when it was humid.
 
✓ A phone that extended little metal legs and used its camera, GPS, and 
face-recognition imaging to chase you around when people called: 
Thought up by a Japanese company, the design was dropped when 
users reported epic nightmares of their phone coming to life, only to 
find that their phone had, in fact, come to life and was hunting them 
down like the Terminator.
Although no one can predict the future, by keeping up with the latest trends 
in mobile phone development (we’ll let the aforementioned experiments 
speak for the themselves), you can identify some of the larger trends and 
extrapolate how these trends may impact what users want to accomplish on 
the mobile Web and start planning now how best to design sites that take 
advantage of these new features in the future.
Saving time or money with 
targeted searches
Even though the mobile Web is still in its infancy, the early adopters are 
quickly discovering that having a connection to all the information and enter-
tainment on the Internet is changing their behaviors in fundamental ways. 
For example, people used to have arguments and just throw out facts or ask 
unanswerable questions. But so many people have taken to just whipping out 
their Web-enabled phone and looking up the facts on Google that newspaper 
columnists have written to decry the death of good arguments. Minor points 

31
 Chapter 1: Understanding What Makes the Mobile Web Different
that once formed the foundation for long disputes — say, “Who played 3rd 
base for the Dodgers in 1937?” — are now no longer the stuff of a good couple 
rounds of discussion at a sports bar.
Basically, people are turning into a nation of fact-checkers. If you want to 
know the answer to any question right now, right here, just pull out your 
phone and check it out.
This becomes especially important when you consider a growing function 
for the phones — that of price-checker and deal-finder. Indeed, the next 
big demographic group that marketers and politicians want to focus on is 
already being dubbed the iPhone mom (the latest in a series of mom-focused 
marketing campaigns that started with soccer mom). Blessed with both dis-
posable income and purchasing power, the iPhone mom (or dad) stalks the 
aisles of any supermarket, pulling out a phone and using its bar-code reader 
to check whether the price on arugula is really a good deal. Enter that infor-
mation into the Web and consumers are better armed than ever before to 
find mobile coupons and comparison shop until they save a few more bucks 
at the cash register.
 
If people find that the mobile Web can actually save them time and money, 
that’s the strongest possible inducement to adoption. Users will rationalize 
away the costs of a slightly more expensive data plan as long as they can see 
the benefits in their daily lives.
Killing time with multimedia
If your site is dedicated to amusing people or has quirky information that 
helps people while away the time, mobile Web definitely figures large in your 
future.
All those hours spent waiting in line at the bank, the DMV, or doctors’ offices, 
or for a chronically late friend are no longer exercises in counting the dots 
on the ceiling tiles or leafing through 10-year-old issues of Aggregates and 
Roadbuilding magazine.
Already, many hairdressers keep their patrons happy by placing a smart-
phone on the counter next to their stations, right next to the scissors and 
comb. The patron then can browse the latest celebrity gossip or watch the 
top-ten college slam-dunks of the week.
One overlooked space is the increasingly sophisticated entertainment sys-
tems included in many SUVs and minivans. Currently, most of these systems 
allow kids in the backseat to watch DVDs or play video games. But a simple 
connection to a fast wireless data network will allow kids to poke each other 
on Facebook, update their Twitter feeds, and play a World of Warcraft death 
match with the carload of kids in the adjacent lane.

Meanwhile, as data rates get faster, more and more video is consumed. In 
2009, more than 25 percent of cellphone users reported watching video on 
their devices — much of this is snacking videos, or videos less than 5 minutes 
in duration. These are usually the kinds of things that your friends e-mail you 
to say, “Can you believe this? It’s a roller-skating giraffe!”
With the growth of Webisodics (short video programs that appear at regular 
intervals) on the desktop Web, you can expect to see a rise in soap-opera-
type programming for video for the mobile Web as well. Long and involved 
storylines tracking the trials and tribulations of long-suffering characters who 
look like they’ve just run a marathon and are panting for breath are sure to 
attract a following.
Again, this kind of rich content may be driven by the willingness of the audi-
ence to pay a subscription rate for this kind of entertainment on the mobile 
platform because it offers something worth paying for.
Connecting with people on 
social networking sites
We doubt you’re surprised that the number-one most popular usage of smart-
phones is for Facebook. Rounding out the top ten are MySpace, Twitter, blog-
ging software such as WordPress, and so on.
Just as the early Internet was dominated by users flocking to bulletin boards 
to trade insults on dialup modems, share Grateful Dead trivia, or express 
their inner poet, so too are early mobile Web users participating in the popu-
lar social sites in which they connect with their friends.
People naturally want to reach out and connect with others — well, the cell-
phone already made that possible through its voice services. But the mobile 
Web makes it more powerful for people to come together to do complex tasks, 
such as the street protests in Iran after the disputed election in June 2009. The 
crowds of protesters warned each other through Twitter updates sent from 
their cellphones where the police were massing and what kinds of violence 
were being used against them. The cellphone video shots of Neda Agha-Soltan 
dying in the street made her into an international symbol and martyr.
For mobile designers, this means the power of organic searches is growing. 
That is, rather than a user typing a query into Google, he asks a question on 
Twitter or his Facebook profile to see what his friends and social group have 
to say on the matter.
 
Word-of-mobile referral is a powerful force that can drive traffic to your Web 
site. Designers want to make it as easy as possible for users to share the con-
tent on their sites via social networking.

 Chapter 1: Understanding What Makes the Mobile Web Different
Having some kind of community/interactivity functionality in mobile Web 
sites is as important as ever because users are becoming accustomed to 
adding their input to what appears in the content.
Because the GPS capabilities of phones are growing, it’s not hard to imagine 
that sites that allow users to see which of their friends are nearby or what 
other people have said about the restaurant they’re about to enter, the park 
they’re about to walk their dog in, or the office they’re about to apply for a 
job in are going to see explosive growth.

Chapters 9 and 10, respectively.
Using smartphone functions 
in unexpected ways
Putting technology into the public’s hands has always had unexpected con-
sequences. The human impulse to tinker, modify, soup up, re-imagine, and 
tear apart can’t be denied and will always result in usages that the original 
designers never could have anticipated. For instance, microwaves were born 
when scientist Percy Spencer walked past a radar emitter and noticed that 
the Hershey bar in his pocket melted.
The same kind of exploration is happening now with phones — and the 
products are as impossible to predict as the lunar rover would have been to 
Henry Ford. Here are a few examples of people finding novel uses for smart-
phone technology:
 
✓ Medical diagnostics: Scientists at UCLA recently discovered that when 
they removed the little glass lens from above the sensor in a cellphone’s 
built-in digital camera, all kinds of exciting possibilities opened. When 
they put a droplet of blood directly on the sensor, they could then gen-
erate a microscopic 3-D image of the blood, showing whether viruses or 
parasites were present.
 
 Efforts are underway to perfect this application because phones 
equipped with this functionality will be powerful diagnostic tools in 
remote areas; doctors in countries with shortages of medical devices 
could track disease outbreaks in real time and send medicine to head off 
outbreaks before they turn into pandemics.
 
 It’s not hard to foresee a time when your cellphone will constantly moni-
tor your vital signs — like having TV’s Dr. House in your pocket, con-
stantly monitoring your heart rate and blood sugar levels, and calling an 
ambulance for you if you have a heart attack or are knocked unconscious.

Part I: Designing for Mobile Devices 
 
✓ Paying for goods: Meanwhile, the money to pay for all these goods and 
services is also starting to migrate to the mobile platform. In Japan, com-
muters pay for their subway train rides by swiping their phone over sen-
sors installed above the turnstiles and buy food out of vending machines 
by waving their phone over the control panel.
 
 Taxi drivers in Indonesia accept payment via phones and report that 
they are far happier this way because they’re no longer at risk of being 
mugged for cash.
 
✓ Transferring money to remote areas: Manual laborers in Africa faced 
special challenges trying to support their families when they moved 
from the rural countryside to cities to find jobs. The village they came 
from didn’t have any banks, and the amounts of money they earned 
weren’t enough to open an account anyway. They could take a bus back 
home, but the ticket would pretty much eat up all their savings. They 
could pool the money and give it to a courier, but there was always the 
possibility that he’d disappear with their money or be robbed on the 
way.
 
 Under these pressures, they hit on an elegant solution — sente, or send-
ing money via airtime. The worker buys a prepaid phone card and calls 
the person in his home village who has the mobile phone kiosk and 
reads the code on the phone card — usually about 10,000 Ugandan shil-
lings or about $6.
 
 The owner of the phone verifies that the code works, checks to see that 
all the minutes are there, and then pays the man’s family the money, 
minus a 10–20 percent charge. It’s like an offshore bank account for 
people without the means to have an offshore bank account.
We don’t know what the effects of this kind of radical innovation are going 
to be, but keeping up with the latest trends will obviously help mobile Web 
designers adapt their sites to take advantage of these kinds of advances.
 
The biggest imminent change in the United States is the rollout of 4G data 
connections to mobile devices. This means that users have Internet connec-
tion speeds in excess of 100 megabits per second (Mbps; by means of refer-
ence, the average top speed for a business-level cable modem is only about 8 
Mbps). Uncompressed HD video requires about 10 Mbps.
Even the most technically savvy mobile analysts pale at the thought of the 
changes that such connectivity is going to cause. “We don’t know what it’s 
going to do, but it’s going to be big,” said Montes at a meeting of the Online 
News Association in Los Angeles.

n Greek mythology, Procrustes was a monster who notoriously forced 
people to fit in his iron bed. If you were too long, he cut off your feet. If 
you were too short, he stretched you until your body reached (uncomfort-
ably) from the foot of the bed to the headboard. Today, procrustean describes 
things of different lengths or sizes that are forced to fit an arbitrary standard.
Transcoder is another term that seems inspired by the story of Procrustes. If 
you don’t optimize your Web site for mobile devices, many mobile carriers 
do so for you through transcoding, which is a complex process of reformat-
ting a page layout to make it display better on a mobile device. As you might 
imagine, the result of this type of automated reformatting often ends up look-
ing like your site was put through the same sort of gruesome manipulations 
required to make everyone fit in the same iron bed.
If you’ve picked up this book, we have to assume you’re at least considering 
developing a special version of your site for the mobile Web — the fact that 
transcoding can lead visitors to a distorted version of your site if you don’t 
is just one of many reasons you’re right to take an active role in designing a 
mobile version of your Web site.
In this chapter, we explore how to make sure your Web site fits well on 
mobile devices, without cutting off its feet or stretching it to within a pixel of 
its life. We also cover some of the key considerations in designing for mobile 
and some important design tips to keep in mind when you delve into the rest 
of this book.

Part I: Designing for Mobile Devices 
Avoiding Unpredictable Mobile Designs
A couple of processes unique to the mobile Web work behind the scenes in 
your Web site code. One is transcoding and the other is the way mobile brows-
ers process (or fail to process) mobile-specific style sheets. Understanding 
these issues when you begin can help you avoid many headaches down the 
road. We explain what you need to know in the following sections.
Transcoding: Forcing full-sized Web 
pages into tiny mobile spaces
If you don’t develop a mobile design for your site, you run the risk that trans-
coders do so for you. Transcoding generally involves
 
✓ Stripping any video or multimedia.
 
✓ Shrinking photos.
 
✓ Breaking large Web pages into a series of smaller pages that link 
together. (These bite-sized pages load better over a low bandwidth 
connection in a way the carrier deems reasonable.)
 
If you have any experience surfing the mobile Web, you probably aren’t sur-
prised to find out that this automated repurposing of a page’s code provides 
disappointing results, at best, and embarrassingly terrible, unreadable results, 
at worst. If you just want to see how a Web page might look in a mobile device, 
you can enter any URL into Google’s transcoder and you’ll get a good idea 
of what the page will look like, even if all you have to test with is a desktop 
Web browser like the one used in Figures 2-1 and 2-2. In Figure 2-1, you see 
author Janine Warner’s desktop site (www.jcwarner.com) in the Firefox Web 
browser on a Windows computer, and in Figure 2-2, you see the effect of the 
Google transcoder on the same site when it’s automatically reformatted in the 
browser as it would be for mobile devices.
Keep in mind that transcoding is generally used only when someone uses 
a very limited mobile device and connects over a low bandwidth service. If 
you surf with a Wi-Fi network or use a mobile emulator on your desktop com-
puter, you’ll probably never see transcoding in action unless you use one of 
the transcoding services listed below.
If you want to get an idea for how transcoding works, you can enter the URL 
of any Web site into either of the following tools by replacing yourdomain.
com with any Web address:

Part I: Designing for Mobile Devices 
 
If you don’t want Google or other transcoders to automatically reformat your 
Web site, you can direct users to an alternate page by including the following 
link tag in the Head area at the top of the HTML code of any Web page:
<link rel=”alternate” media=”handheld” href=”alternate_
page.html” />
Just replace alternate_page.html with another page on your site, and 
Google and most other transcoders direct users to that page instead of trans-
coding your main page. This tag doesn’t automatically redirect all mobile 
traffic to the mobile version of your site, but it is a simple way to redirect 
many visitors to your site. You can read more about the options for redirect-
ing traffic and creating multiple versions of your Web site in Chapter 6.
Designing mobile pages with the XHTML Mobile Profile markup language 
and using the corresponding doctype will also prevent most transcoders 
from reformatting your pages. You find a review of mobile markup language 
options and doctypes in Chapter 5.
Creating a mobile CSS file is not enough
If the challenges of designing for the mobile Web simply could be solved by 
creating a special style sheet for mobile, well, that’d be lovely. Unfortunately, 
it’s not that simple. The rules for Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) include the 
option to create a mobile version, as well as special style sheets for printing 
and other uses, so many people who have learned CSS assume this will solve 
the problem.
In theory, creating a mobile style sheet makes great sense and is the clear 
winner in terms of efficiency. Because CSS makes separating content from 
style possible, you should be able to deliver the same page content to both 
a desktop computer and a mobile phone by simply using a different style 
sheet. For example, you could create a style sheet for the mobile Web that 
strips problematic features, such as big background images, and then have 
a different one that takes advantage of all that the desktop Web has to offer. 
Because you can link any page to more than one style sheet, you should be 
able to instruct mobile browsers to use your mobile style sheet instead of the 
desktop version.
Unfortunately, this approach falls short of the needs of many of the devices 
on today’s mobile Web because:
 
✓ Many mobile devices don’t support CSS at all.
 
✓ Other mobile devices don’t distinguish correctly between the style sheet 
you create for a mobile device and the one that’s used for desktop surfing.

39
 Chapter 2: Designing for the Mobile Web
 
Even in a world where CSS was supported universally (wouldn’t that be awe-
some), consider your visitor’s perspective. You’re asking a lot of visitors on 
slow mobile networks to download an HTML page designed for the desktop. 
Even if you use CSS to hide some things that may not work on a phone, you’re 
still making visitors download more than they need, which can cost your visi-
tors more than wasted time — many pay access fees, a price too high to think 
you won’t lose visitors with this approach.
 
You can use CSS in your mobile Web page designs; just don’t rely on it exclu-
sively. You can read more about when you can use style sheets in mobile Web 
design in Chapter 5.
Picking a Strategy for Different Devices
If you have the time, expertise, and budget, your best strategy is to design 
different versions of your Web site, each optimized for the different sizes and 
capabilities of various devices. Then set up a program on your Web server 
that detects what type of device each visitor to your site is using and directs 
them to the page that best serves their device. (You learn more about how 
device detection scripts work in Chapter 6.)
That doesn’t mean you need a different design for every device, which is a 
good thing because your visitor may be using any 1 of an estimated 8,000 
plus kinds of mobile phones and other devices in the world. No, even with 
this strategy, what most designers do is
 
1. Create a few categories, or profiles, of devices, based on screen size, 
JavaScript support, and so on. (More on that in Chapter 6.)
 
2. Create a few versions of the site optimized for each category, or adapt 
one version to work on many different devices.
You find out more about this approach to designing for different devices in 
Chapter 6.
In the sections that follow, we explore the most common approaches to 
designing for the plethora of devices that access the mobile Web.
Create a simple version of your site
 
If you want to make sure that the largest number of visitors to your site can 
at least get the most important information on your site (such as your phone 
number when they’re on their way to your office), create a simplified version 
of your site designed to work on even low-end mobile devices.

40
Part I: Designing for Mobile Devices 
This is the most cost-effective approach (after the do-nothing option), and 
it’s especially important if you have a site that uses a lot of multimedia or is 
designed in Flash, which doesn’t work at all on most mobile phones.
To make your site work, even on the most limited cellphone systems (think, 
unbelievably low bandwidth and a tiny screen that barely supports images, 
text, and links), you need to strip down your site to only the most important 
elements by limiting the home page to
 
✓ One or two tiny images (if you have any at all)
 
✓ A little text
 
✓ A few links
A good example of a very simple mobile site design is Mark Jenkin’s Web site 
at http://mobilynx.net (shown in Figure 2-3). Mark, a specialist in mobile 
devices who helped with some of the testing for this book, designed the 
mobiLynx site to provide easy access to a directory of links to sites that are 
optimized for mobile phones. We explore this approach, creating one version 
of a site that works on most mobile devices, in Chapter 3.

41
 Chapter 2: Designing for the Mobile Web
Design multiple versions
The best mobile Web design strategy is to create more than one version of 
your Web site, optimized for different devices, and then automatically direct 
visitors to the best version for their device’s screen size and features.
This high-level solution can be achieved by creating two or more completely 
different designs, each at its own URL, or by creating one design that can 
be altered on the fly to best serve each device. This increasingly popular 
approach to mobile Web design is called content adaptation.
 
If you’re working for a site that needs to reach a broad audience — especially 
if you want to serve that audience with interactive features or multimedia — 
designing multiple versions of your site or using content adaptation is the best 
strategy for reaching the broadest audience most effectively. If you’ve guessed 
that these are also the most complicated options, you’re right.
A growing number of large national and international companies have cre-
ated multiple versions of their sites using content adaptation or separate 
URLs or both. If you design a site for a big company, such as American 
Airlines, that has to reach a broad, diverse audience and provide highly inter-
active features with advanced security and other complex options, you have 
to create different versions of the site to deliver a good mobile experience.
When you opt to create multiple mobile versions, you can decide how spe-
cialized you want those versions to be. Consider the following examples:
 
✓ Broad categories: Some companies create just three or four versions 
optimized for each of the main cellphone categories — smartphones, 
touch phones, and feature phones. (We describe these in more detail in 
the section “Considering Device Differences,” later in this chapter.)
 
 If you just want to make sure your pages look pretty good to most 
people, you can generally get away with creating just a few variations 
that target the main categories of devices. As shown in Figure 2-4, the 
Geek Squad site — one of the better sites on the mobile Web — delivers 
the same design to both the iPhone and the Droid, but a different ver-
sion is sent to the BlackBerry Bold 9700.
 
✓ Specialized profiles: Some mobile Web developers create as many as a 
dozen or more profiles for mobile devices based on screen size, multi-
media capabilities, and other factors. This level of complexity is gener-
ally best managed by doing content adaptation. In this model, designers 
use dynamic site capabilities to design pages on the fly. For example, as 
each device is detected and identified, a page is created to match the 
features of that device. By drawing from a collection of elements in a 
database, such as images in various sizes and video and audio in differ-
ent formats, you can generate as many different combinations as you 
need to suit the devices that are used to visit your site.

 Chapter 2: Designing for the Mobile Web
Design one high-end version
Many designers have decided that the only visitors who matter are the ones 
who’ve shelled out the money for a high-end phone, such as an iPhone, 
Droid, Palm Pre, or Windows Mobile device. Before you decide that looking 
good on smartphones is good enough, understand the arguments for and 
against this approach:
 
✓ Argument for: This strategy is based on usage statistics that show most 
of the people who actively surf the mobile Web today use iPhones, 
Droids, or other high-end smartphones.
 
✓ Argument against: The people using low-end devices still far outnumber 
the people using smartphones. Many people don’t surf the Web on low-
end mobile phones because most of the Web is unusable on them. As 
more Web sites are optimized for mobile devices, the world will become 
more accustomed to finding information when it’s needed. If your site is 
still hard to access on the majority of low-end mobile devices, you’ll be 
left out.
The evidence used to make these cases adds to the confusion. Here’s an 
example: According to the mobile advertising network, AdMob, in April 2010, 
the iPhone was the device most likely to be used to surf your site, but it still 
represented only 19 percent of the global traffic to advertising on the mobile 
Web. That number approaches 30 percent when you add iPod users, and if 
you lump Droid phones into the mix, many sites now get close to 50 percent 
of their traffic from high-end phones.
But here’s the rub. One of the most striking things about traffic reports to 
most mobile Web sites today is that the list of devices that represent only 1 
or 2 percent of the traffic is really, really long. That means that reaching the 
high end is relatively easy — design for smartphones and you may take care 
of as much as 50 percent of your audience — but reaching the low end, effec-
tively, requires a complex strategy that can meet the needs of dozens or even 
hundreds of different devices, each being used by less than 2 percent of your 
audience, but combining to represent more than 50 percent of the traffic to 
most sites today.
 
Although we don’t think designing only for high-end smartphones is the best 
way for most Web sites to serve the broad mobile audience, if you know that 
your target market is likely to use a high-end phone, such as an iPhone or 
Droid, this may be a fine option for your Web site. Sites like Jasper Johal’s 
photography Web site (see Figure 2-5) look great on an iPhone, and because 
his site is designed to showcase his work to creative directors and other 
design professionals who might hire him as a photographer, he’s not overly 
concerned about providing an alternative design for people using feature 
phones or other low-end devices.

Optimizing Mobile Web Site Designs
When you begin thinking about how best to design the mobile version(s) of 
your Web site, consider the unique challenges of the mobile Web covered in 
this section.
The key considerations to keep in mind while you design sites for the mobile 
Web are
 
✓ Urgent need for information: Many people resort to the mobile Web 
because they have to, because they’re lost or late, or because they really 
need to know who won the Super Bowl in 1987 to win a bar bet.
 
✓ Limited real estate: Mobile designs need to fit on small screens.
 
✓ Low bandwidth: Limit images and text so pages load quickly even at 
slow connection speeds.
 
✓ Interface limitations: Create links and other navigation options that are 
easy to click with a (fat) finger, stylus, or other limited input options.
 
✓ Limited processing power and memory: Large files and scripts that 
require fast processors won’t display well on most mobile devices.
 
✓ Distracted users: Navigating road or foot traffic is just one of many dis-
tractions that may compete for your users’ attention.
 
✓ Time and place: Don’t forget that your users’ actions are likely to be 
affected by where they are, what time of day it is, and even whether 
it’s raining. Make sure to include location-specific information, such as 
maps, and consider adding geolocation features, such as those included 
in the new HTML5 specification, covered in Chapter 5.

45
 Chapter 2: Designing for the Mobile Web
Designing for small screens
If every mobile phone had the same screen size, we might not have had to 
write this entire book about mobile Web design. Okay, there are many other 
considerations, but limited real estate is one of the most important to keep 
in mind. The chart shown in Figure 2-6 provides a quick reference to many 
of the shapes and sizes of the screens used to surf the mobile Web today. 
(There are actually even more, but these are the ones most mobile designers 
are targeting.) As you can see, there is no standard size for mobile devices.
Creating a single design doesn’t work if you want to take best advantage of 
the real estate available on each screen. Even smartphones that are 320 x 
480 can be rotated, so you can’t assume that you’ll always have 480 pixels of 
width when a visitor lands on your site. You can find more specific informa-
tion about the screen sizes of different devices in the section “Considering 
Device Differences,” later in this chapter.

common

Sticking to bandwidth limitations
If you’ve been online long enough to remember the days when modem 
speeds clocked in at 14.4 or 28.8 Kbps, think back to how frustrating it was 
to wait . . . and wait . . . for a page to load. Although the 4G network promises 
great download speeds on mobile devices, too many cellphone users still 
make their way through the mobile Web at molasses-slow speeds.

46
Part I: Designing for Mobile Devices 
When you design for the Web, try to keep the page sizes small (that is, limit 
the amount of data the entire page contains and what your visitors have to 
download to access your site):
 
✓ To reach low bandwidth users, keep pages to no more than 10–25K 
(yeah, we know that’s really, really small).
 
✓ If you know your users have high bandwidth (3G or 4G networks), you 
can get away with 150–200K, but that still makes it tough to include very 
much multimedia on your pages.
Navigating on mobile devices
If you’ve ever yelled at your computer in frustration knowing that it couldn’t 
understand you anyway, you’ll probably be delighted when you can start 
talking to it rationally instead, especially when it can fully understand you. 
That’s coming to the mobile Web soon, but full voice recognition isn’t here 
yet. In the meantime, keep in mind that mobile visitors to your site may have 
trouble navigating the links on your site if you don’t make them easy to click.
Your mobile visitors are most likely
 
✓ Touching the screen
 
✓ Tapping the screen with a stylus
 
✓ Entering information through a wheel, buttons, or a keypad
That means you need to
 
✓ Make links easy to see and easy to click. If you design multiple ver-
sions of your site, make sure you optimize for the input options on each 
device. If your visitors use a stylus, they can click links relatively close 
together, but if they use a touch screen, you need to separate links 
with enough space between them to make it easier to tap them with a 
fat fingertip.
 
✓ Limit the total number of links, especially on the low-end version of 
your site. Help people move through your site by leading them from 
one short list of links to the next until they reach the content that best 
serves them.
 
✓ Organize the levels of links. Don’t include too many levels with your 
links and consider adding breadcrumbs to help users find their way 
back through different levels of your site. Breadcrumbs are a list of links, 
usually added to the top of a page, that can help you identify where you 
are in the structure of a site with links to each section and subsection 
that appears above the page your are on in the site’s structure.

47
 Chapter 2: Designing for the Mobile Web
 
 The BBC uses breadcrumbs effectively on its mobile site. In Figure 2-7, 
you can see the breadcrumbs just below the BBC Sport logo. The links 
represent each section of the site that the user has navigated through 
to get to the page. In this example, you can see BBC Home (a link to the 
home page), BBC Sport (a link to the main page of the sports section), 
and finally Tennis (a link to the front page of the Tennis section, con-
tained within the sports section).
 
✓ Provide a navigation menu instead of a navigation bar. Although most 
desktop Web sites include a navigation bar that links to all the main sec-
tions of a site at the top of every page, that’s generally not the best use 
of the real estate on a small screen. Instead, consider including one link 
at the top of every page with a name like Menu, and then link to a naviga-
tion bar from that one link.
 
 Including a list of links to all the main pages of your site on every page 
may not be worth the download time, but creating a small site map 
and including a link to that page from every other page on the site can 
provide a similar option. This strategy can also be used to include a 
list of links at the bottom of each page, with a Menu link at the top that 
“jumps” visitors down to the links at the bottom. (You find more on cre-
ating jump links in Chapter 5.)
 
✓ Link from one site version to another. Always good practice is to 
include a link on the front page of your mobile site to the desktop ver-
sion and vice versa. Visitors to your mobile site may already be familiar 
with your desktop version and prefer to visit that full site, especially if 
they are using a smartphone, such as an iPhone or Droid.

Part I: Designing for Mobile Devices 
Considering Device Differences
You’re probably catching on that the world of cellphones and other mobile 
devices lacks standards (technical standards, at least), but it does have some 
common themes. As you consider how best to design the mobile version(s) 
of your site, it’s helpful to start with at least a general understanding of the 
kinds of differences common among device categories.
Although some people opt for creating just one simplified version of their 
site for the mobile Web (a strategy covered in Chapter 3), keep in mind that 
unless you create multiple versions, you can’t really meet the needs of the 
different kinds of devices on the market. The next sections describe some of 
the key differences among the most common devices (and device families) in 
use today. In Chapter 6, you find more information on how to design different 
versions of your site for different devices.
Apple iPhone: The game changer
Apple, with its “there’s an app for that” ad campaign, captured the imagi-
nation of people around the world and made surfing the Web on a mobile 
device more appealing and more satisfying than ever.
Of all the mobile devices on the market, the iPhone (and its siblings the iPad 
and iPod touch) does the best job displaying desktop Web sites. The iPhone 
spoils you quickly if you use it to surf the mobile Web. Just keep in mind that 
not everyone on the planet can afford this fabulous device and that the Web 
looks far worse on most other mobile devices.
With the release of the iPhone 4 (as shown in Figure 2-8), the iPhone continues 
to improve, adding two cameras, mobile video conferencing capabilities, and 
a screen resolution that rivals anything else on the market. (Note: iPhone 4, 
sometimes mistakenly called the iPhone 4G because Apple called its prede-
cessor the iPhone 3G, refers to the fourth generation of the product, not the 
speed of the network.) Therefore, if you design only for the iPhone, you have 
a great advantage. The mobile version of the Safari Web browser aims to dis-
play any desktop site as well as a desktop computer (and with the exception 
of the smaller screen size, it comes pretty darned close).
Specifications for the iPhone and iPad are
 
✓ Screen size: 320 x 480 pixels (rotates from portrait to landscape auto-
matically)
 
✓ Usable display area: 320 x 480 pixels

49
 Chapter 2: Designing for the Mobile Web
 
✓ Operating system: Proprietary iOS
 
✓ Browser (Safari WebKit): Supports XHTML Mobile Profile (MP) and 
CSS2, as well as most of the HTML5 and CSS3 specifications.
 
✓ Multimedia support: GIF87, GIF89a, JPEG, PNG, MIDI, MP3, 3GPP, and 
MP4 (see Chapter 8 for more on multimedia formats and support)

Google Android: Catching on fast
Although the iPhone has gotten all the hype in the last few years, Droid 
phones, which run on the Google Android operating system, started outsell-
ing iPhones in the first quarter of 2010 and are likely to continue to do so in 
the future. Many predict that Google could beat Apple with the Android oper-
ating system on the mobile platform in much the same way that Microsoft 
won on the desktop.
Because Android phones, generally shortened to Droid, can be created by 
many companies, they’re cheaper and available on more networks. And 
although the iPhone has a head start with its famous App Store, the Droid 
world of apps is catching up, and support for the mobile Web is solid and 
improving all the time.

50
Part I: Designing for Mobile Devices 
The list of phones that offer the Android operating system is growing, and 
one of the most popular phones today is the Motorola Droid (which can be 
used horizontally or vertically, and boasts a slide-out keyboard, as shown in 
Figure 2-9).
Specifications for the Motorola Droid are
 
✓ Screen size: 480 x 854 pixels (rotates automatically)
 
✓ Usable display area: 320 x 240 pixels
 
✓ Operating system: Google Android
 
✓ Browser: Supports XHTML MP and CSS2, and supports most of the 
HTML5 and CSS3 specifications
 
✓ Multimedia support: GIF87, GIF89a, JPEG, PNG, MIDI, MP3, 3GPP, and MP4

RIM BlackBerry: So many to choose from
Unlike the iPhone, which is nearly identical from version to version in terms 
of screen size and support for everything from multimedia to markup lan-
guage support, the RIM (Research in Motion) BlackBerry varies dramatically 
from version to version. And so far, there are 87 versions. In fact, many 
mobile Web designers complain that there are too many kinds of BlackBerry 

51
 Chapter 2: Designing for the Mobile Web
phones to design for them as one category of phone. Worse yet, BlackBerry 
phones give users many options about what kinds of content they want to 
view on the mobile Web.
As a result, many sites, such as GameSpot (see Figure 2-10), include a link and 
instructions for how to optimize a BlackBerry phone to best display its site. You 
see this link only if you visit GameSpot with a BlackBerry, but it’s good practice 
if you include multimedia, JavaScript, or other high-end features on your pages.
Although we can’t give one set of specs for the BlackBerry, we chose the 
BlackBerry Bold 9700 (as shown in Figure 2-10) as an example.
Specifications for the BlackBerry Bold 9700 are
 
✓ Screen size: 480 x 360 pixels (rotates automatically)
 
✓ Usable display area: 460 x 348 pixels
 
✓ Operating system: Proprietary OS RIM
 
✓ Browser: Supports XHTML MP and CSS2
 
✓ Multimedia support: GIF87, GIF89a, JPEG, PNG, MIDI, MP3, 3GPP, and MP4

Palm: A great OS with a little audience
Many developers would tell you that the Palm operating system is one of the 
best, but with such a tiny market share, it seems destined to the same obscu-
rity suffered by so many other superior technologies over the years.
With the recent acquisition by computer giant Hewlett-Packard (HP), the 
future of Palm is even less certain. Today, 24 mobile devices are in the Palm 
family, including the Palm Pre, shown in Figure 2-11, but HP reports it won’t 
make any new mobile phones, although it will continue to support the ones 
sold so far.
Instead, most industry analysts assume HP will use the Palm OS to develop 
tablet devices like Apple’s iPad.
Specifications of the Palm Pre are
 
✓ Screen size: 320 x 480 pixels
 
✓ Usable display area: 316 x 480 pixels
 
✓ Operating system: Palm OS
 
✓ Browser: Supports XHTML, XHTML MP, and CSS2 and provides limited 
support for HTML5 and CSS3
 
✓ Multimedia support: GIF87, JPEG, PNG, MP3, 3GPP, and MP4

Windows Mobile: The Microsoft advantage
With the slew of new devices entering the market, Windows Mobile is getting 
more and more attention these days.
The number of mobile phones featuring the Windows Mobile operating 
system (such as the ones shown in Figure 2-12) is increasing, and this OS 
provides support for limited versions of Internet Explorer, Word, and other 
popular Microsoft programs.
Phones and other devices that run Windows Mobile generally support 
XHTML MP and CSS2, as well as audio, video, and JavaScript. Most also have 
large screen sizes, similar to the iPhone and Droid phones.

The Motorola RAZR and 
other feature phones
By many estimates, the majority of mobile phone users in the world are still 
restricted to low-end feature phones, like the Motorola RAZR. Although even 
these limited phones support XHTML MP, most display little or no CSS, and 
their low connection speeds can make multimedia nearly impossible to play.

54
Part I: Designing for Mobile Devices 
In Chapter 13, we review ten sites we consider well designed for the mobile 
Web and include screenshots of those sites as shown on an iPhone, a 
BlackBerry Bold, and a Motorola RAZR. Looking through the figures in 
Chapter 13 will help you appreciate how limited the display area is on a small 
RAZR and why you should limit the content of your Web pages to just a few 
links and one small image when you design for feature phones.
Symbian: The global phenomenon
Outside the United States, the Symbian operating system is one of the most 
popular on the planet. If you want to reach the global market, you can’t 
ignore the Symbian operating system, estimated to be used by the larg-
est audience worldwide. Although some of the newest phones that run on 
Symbian offer high-end features and multimedia support, the vast majority of 
phones that run on Symbian are low-end feature phones.
One of the distinguishing features of high-end Symbian phones is that unlike 
the iPhone, they support Adobe Flash (at least the mobile version, Flash Lite).
The sheer number of people who use Symbian phones around the globe 
makes this low-end audience tantalizing because of the potential for volume. 
Although Short Message Service (SMS), or text messages, may still be the 
best way to reach most Symbian phones, they’re improving in capabilities 
and increasingly supporting the mobile Web. (You find resources for con-
ducting ad campaigns using SMS in Chapter 11.) We don’t include specifica-
tions for Symbian phones because, again, they range so dramatically from 
phone to phone, but if you create a simple mobile site, covered in Chapter 3, 
you can reach most of this audience just fine.
Finding specifications for nearly 
any device at DeviceAtlas
 
We reviewed the specifications of some of the most popular phones in the 
previous section to give you a general idea of what you’re up against and 
what you can expect visitors to use when they visit your Web site. But this 
is just a small portion of the kinds of devices on the market. If you want to 
know about more phones, check out DeviceAtlas at http://deviceatlas.

Beware of dumbphones
One last word of warning when reviewing mobile phone specifications. 
Dumbphone isn’t a term we made up; it’s an actual industry term that refers 
to feature phones dressed up to act like smartphones (with a touch screen, 
fancy hardware, and so on) without really supporting everything they might 
appear to support.
Dumbphones almost always have browsers that claim to support Web stan-
dards but have such flawed implementations that even the best-designed 
mobile sites may not display well on them. Don’t take it personally. If you run 
into dumbphones and they don’t like your otherwise well-designed pages, 
send them a low-end version of your site as if they were feature phones.
Making a Mobile Site Search-
Engine-Friendly
After you go to all the trouble of making your Web site mobile-friendly, don’t 
forget to make it mobile search-engine-friendly as well. Although many of the 
same rules of search engine optimization (SEO) apply, you need to under-
stand a few key differences and special additions, as well as a few things you 
shouldn’t do on your mobile site if you want to be included in mobile search 
engines, such as Google’s, as shown in Figure 2-14.

56
Part I: Designing for Mobile Devices 
 
Figure 2-14: 
Most of 
the major 
search 
engines

optimized 
search 
options, 
but Google

the most 
advanced 
mobile 
search 
services.
 
 
Here are some do’s and don’ts for mobile SEO:
 
✓ Do add a meta tag that identifies your site as mobile. Search engines, 
such as Google, are much more likely to find your mobile site, and 
deliver to mobile devices, if you include this piece of code in your pages. 
Just enter the code below, exactly as it appears, anywhere between the 
<head> and </head> tags at the top of your mobile-optimized Web 
page:
<meta name=”HandheldFriendly” content=”True” />
 
✓ Do make sure your XHTML code is valid. This is even more important 
on the mobile Web than on the desktop Web. Take the time to run your 
site through online validators, like the ones at the W3C, and make sure 
you code is up to snuff. (You find more on testing and using code valida-
tors in Chapter 7.)
 
✓ Do register your mobile site with search engines. Mobile search 
engines, such as Yahoo!, shown in Figure 2-15, feature mobile sites, but 
only if they know that they’re there. Make sure to submit your mobile 
URL. (You find a list of mobile search engines in this book’s Cheat sheet; 
see the inside front cover for details.)

visitors to

✓ Don’t stuff in extra keywords. Although keyword stuffing is a popular 
strategy in the world of SEO, it’s increasingly frowned upon by search 
engines. Plus, it’s downright self-sabotaging on the mobile Web where 
every word counts and adding extra words can cost you in valuable 
download times.

Following Mobile 
Web Standards

In this part . . .
D
esigning a Web site that looks good on all the differ-
ent Web browsers available for computers is a chal-
lenge, but creating a site for all the different kinds of 
mobile devices out there takes this challenge to an 
entirely new level. That’s why in this part, we discuss why 
Web standards are so important, especially when it comes 
to mobile Web design. The more you follow standards, the 
more likely your designs will work well for the wide range 
of devices in use on the Internet.

Chapter 3
Creating a Simple Mobile Site
In This Chapter
▶ Planning a mobile version of your site
▶ Guiding visitors through your site
▶ Creating a simple mobile page design
I
magine that you’re on your way to a restaurant for a job interview with 
the coolest company on earth. You’re late, and you’re lost. You pull over 
and get out your phone to look for the restaurant’s Web site. (You would pull 
over before trying to type into your phone, right?)
Now think about what you want to find on the restaurant’s site. You probably 
wouldn’t want a highly graphical, animated, Flash-based site complete with 
a virtual tour of the restaurant and a full-color menu. (And that would be a 
good thing because, at the time of this writing, Flash doesn’t work on most 
mobile phones.) Like most people, you probably want the restaurant’s phone 
number and address as well as a mobile-optimized map and directions. But 
you’d be surprised how many restaurant Web sites can’t deliver these basic, 
crucial pieces of data to a mobile phone.
If you’re creating one version of your site for the mobile Web, the most 
important lesson is to make sure to design it so that people can get what they 
need in a format they can quickly understand on their tiny phones. (By the 
way, in this fantasy, you find the restaurant, nab the perfect parking place, 
and arrive in plenty of time to impress your new boss and land the job, all 
because the restaurant hired a smart Web designer.)
Planning a Simple Mobile Design
Will you create multiple versions of your site optimized for different devices? 
Or have you decided to build a single simplified version of your site for the 
mobile Web? Either way, this chapter helps you create a simple version of 
your site that works on most mobile devices — even ones that aren’t that 
smart. If you have the time and budget to create several versions of your site 

62
Part II: Following Mobile Web Standards 
or are designing your mobile site only for the iPhone and other more sophis-
ticated phones, you can get the basics from this chapter and then read other 
chapters to discover how to create more advanced designs with more com-
plex layout options and technologies.
 
You can include more content and more complex features on a site designed 
for a high-end mobile device, such as an iPhone or Droid, than you can for a 
site designed for a low-end feature phone, such as a RAZR.
Streamlining the content on your pages
All the elements on the first page of your mobile Web site should total no 
more than 10K to 25K. Yes, 10K to 25K. Some mobile designers think that up 
to 100K is acceptable. But users of low-bandwidth mobile devices won’t wait 
for such a slow site to load, especially when they’re rushing to get some-
where, late for a meeting, or trying to check the site at a traffic light.
When you strip a site to something smaller than 25K, you’re limited to only 
the most essential elements — a little text, a few links, and maybe one or two 
tiny, highly optimized images. Links offer more bang for the bandwidth hit 
than anything else you can include on the first page of a mobile site. Because 
links are just text, they download quickly. Five links on the main page of a 
simple mobile site work well; more than seven is usually too many.
Making ruthless decisions
If your goal is to design a simple site that works on most mobile phones, the 
biggest challenge isn’t the limitations of the technology; it’s the ruthless deci-
sions you have to make about content.
Start by considering what is worth including in your site, from most to least 
important. Strip the features of your desktop site to the essential elements 
that are most likely to be important to someone using a mobile device. Think 
about visitors with an urgent need for what your site offers.
Following are a few guidelines for determining what you need to include on 
the simplest version of a mobile Web site:
 
✓ Include a small version of your company logo or a text version of the 
name of your company.
 
✓ Provide a way for people to contact you, including an e-mail address and 
a phone number on the front page, unless you don’t take phone calls. 
(See “Making it easy for people to call,” later in this chapter for how to 
make a phone number easier to dial on a mobile device.)

63
 Chapter 3: Creating a Simple Mobile Site
 
✓ If people visit your business in person, make sure the address is on the 
front page, as well as directions and a link to a map (see “Adding links to 
maps and multimedia,” later in this chapter).
 
✓ Limit your design to one small or two or three tiny images. (See Chapter 8 
for more information on using images on mobile devices.) Optimize the 
images so that they total no more than a few K. (For instructions on opti-
mizing images, see Appendix B.)
 
✓ Never insert multimedia on the front page. If you feel you need to 
include a slide show, video, or audio file, link to it from the front page 
and let your visitors decide whether they want to view multimedia by 
following the link.
 
✓ If you don’t have the expertise or resources to set up a device detection 
script to automatically route mobile phones to the best version of your 
site (covered in Chapter 6), add a link to the mobile version in the top-
left corner of your desktop site. Browsers load pages starting from the 
top left, so including the link in the top-left corner means the link to your 
mobile site will load before anything else on your page, making it easier 
for mobile phone users to get to the mobile version faster.
 
✓ Include a link from your mobile site back to your desktop site. 
Smartphones display desktop sites reasonably well, and some visi-
tors may prefer to view the site they’re familiar with, even if it’s a little 
harder to navigate on a mobile phone.
Guiding visitors through a mobile site
As you’re planning what to include on the mobile version of your site, con-
sider the most compelling reason why people would come to your site with 
their phone. For example, if you own an insurance company, you may be 
dealing with someone who has nothing left but the cellphone he grabbed as 
he ran from his burning house.
Including a phone number on the front page is almost always a good idea on 
a mobile site, but what might your visitors want to find next? How will you 
help them find the information they need, even if that info takes a while to 
download or requires advanced interactive features?
If you’re an insurance company, the first page might have your contact infor-
mation and perhaps links to two forms: one for current customers to use to 
file a claim and another for visitors who want to apply for a new insurance 
policy.

64
Part II: Following Mobile Web Standards 
The first page needs to contain key information that everyone might need, 
such as your contact information, and then, in a few links, visitors should 
be able to move on to additional information. You want to guide people as 
quickly as possible to the information they need, keeping each page as fast-
loading as possible.
A good example of a site that helps visitors find what they need quickly on 
a mobile device is the mobiLynx Web site (www.mobilynx.net), which 
provides a collection of links to sites optimized for mobile devices. The site 
was carefully designed by its creator, Mark Jenkins, to help visitors find what 
they need by organizing sites into categories and providing a series of links 
so users can find their way quickly to the site, or category of sites, that most 
interests them.
For example, in Figure 3-1, you can see how in just three links a visitor can 
get from the front page, to the travel section, to a specific airline. Mark didn’t 
include images on the front page because he wanted it to load quickly, but he 
does include logos of the specific airlines to make it easy to identify the air-
line at a glance after visitors have progressed through the site to the airline 
page — a great example of designing for the distracted.
 
Figure 3-1: 
On the 
mobiLynx 
site, you can 
find a spe-
cific airline 
in just three 
clicks.
 
Creating a Simple Mobile Page Design
At the high end of the mobile Web design spectrum, experienced Web design-
ers often create three or more versions of a Web page, optimized for different 
mobile devices. To direct visitors, they add a special script that detects each 
device as it arrives on a site, determines its capabilities, and then delivers a 
page optimized with the best images, multimedia, and other features for that 
device. (See Chapter 6 for more on detection scripts and designing for mul-
tiple devices.)

65
 Chapter 3: Creating a Simple Mobile Site
Those with a more limited budget, who must settle for one simple Web page, 
can still include valuable information and even multimedia by linking to 
Web sites that have already mastered the art of delivering content to mobile 
devices.
You don’t have to do all the design work for your mobile site. By taking 
advantage of sites that are already optimized for the mobile Web, you can 
extend the capabilities of even a simple mobile site design. Among our favor-
ite options: Upload a video to YouTube and link to it from your mobile site. 
Because YouTube has already developed a sophisticated system for deliver-
ing video to mobile devices, you don’t have to worry about creating mul-
tiple versions of each video file — you upload one video to YouTube, and it 
converts your video into different formats and delivers the best one to each 
device for you. Similarly, you can link to a map on Google Maps or to direc-
tions on MapQuest and rely on the advanced mobile detection and optimiza-
tion these sites have already invested in developing.
Case study: A simple mobile site 
for a multimedia company
When we were asked last year to create a Web site for XVIVO, a scientific 
animation company, we were excited about the challenge of creating a highly 
interactive multimedia site. XVIVO is well known for its beautiful, award-
winning animations and capability to understand and interpret cutting-edge 
science.
Our biggest challenge after we created the desktop site (shown in Figure 3-2) 
was to help them create a simpler version that would work on mobile 
devices. In the sections that follow, you see two versions: a super-simple ver-
sion and a slightly more complex version that includes CSS.
In addition to making it easy for anyone to find their phone number, address, 
and directions from nearly any mobile device, the partners at XVIVO wanted 
to showcase their demo video. The desktop version includes many large, 
colorful graphics, randomly loaded background images that change while 
you navigate through the site, and lots of videos in the Flash video format. 
These multimedia features provide a rich experience on the desktop but are 
problematic on most mobile devices, which can’t display large background 
images or Flash files.

66
Part II: Following Mobile Web Standards 
 
Figure 3-2: 
The desktop 
version of 
the XVIVO 
Web site 
has large 
graphics, 
background 
images, 
and video 
in the Flash 
format.
 
When you create a mobile version of a complex Web site, the first step is 
to identify the elements to preserve. In this case, it was clear we’d have to 
give up the big images and Flash videos, but we still wanted to include some 
images and video. And like most Web design projects, we had a limited 
budget and time frame to develop the site. In the simplest version of the site 
(shown on a Motorola RAZR V9 in Figure 3-3), we used a tiny version of the 
company’s logo, kept one small image to showcase their animation talents, 
and added a brief text description of the company’s services. If you scroll 
down the page, you quickly find the company’s main phone number and 
address, and a link to a map on Google.
We determined the best way to include their demo video was to upload the 
video to YouTube and link to it. The advantage of hosting their video on 
YouTube was that we uploaded one relatively high-resolution version of the 
video, and YouTube automatically optimized the video for different mobile 
devices. YouTube uses sophisticated device detection to deliver the best ver-
sion of the video to each device. That means that two visitors to the XVIVO 
site using different devices may see a different version of the video when 
they click the link to view the demo on YouTube. For example, on an older 
iPhone, you see a more compressed version because YouTube recognizes 
that the iPhone version 1.0 has much slower download speeds. On an iPhone 
on the 3G network, you see a higher-quality version of the same demo.

67
 Chapter 3: Creating a Simple Mobile Site
 
Figure 3-3: 
This mobile 
version of 
the XVIVO 
Web site 
was created 
with simple 
XHTML MP 
code so it 
displays 
well even in 
the limited 
browser 
on the 
Motorola 
RAZR.
 
We wanted to make it easy for clients and other visitors to find not only a 
sampling of the company’s work but also their offices, so we included the 
address and a link to a Google map, another great third-party service for 
including interactive features that work well on mobile devices. To make it 
easy to call the phone number on the site, we formatted the number with the 
link tag and a special attribute that enables users to simply click the number 
to call. (You find detailed instructions for creating all elements featured in 
this mobile site in the exercises that follow.)
Figure 3-4 shows how this same page looks when we used CSS to add back-
ground and text colors. Using CSS even in very simple mobile site designs 
like this works because phones that don’t support CSS ignore the style infor-
mation and display the content formatted with XHTML, as shown in Figure 
3-3. But the design looks best on more sophisticated phones, such as the 
BlackBerry Bold 9700, as shown in Figure 3-4, which displays the background 
color defined in a CSS rule.

Using XHTML MP to create 
a simple mobile design
If you’re creating just one simple mobile page, use XHTML MP (the Mobile 
Profile of the Hypertext Markup language, covered in detail in Chapter 5). 
Although there are still a few old, low-end mobile devices that support only 
WML (Wireless Markup Language), since 2004, the vast majority of mobile 
phones have supported XHTML MP and CSS2, and many smartphones, 
including the iPhone, already support HTML5. (You find a review and com-
parison of the various markup languages for mobile devices in Chapter 5.) As 
we write this, less than 5 percent of mobile devices in the United States are 
limited to WML, and studies show that most people with such limited devices 
don’t even try to surf the Web, so we assume you don’t need to design for 
that audience.

 Chapter 3: Creating a Simple Mobile Site
If you’re still new to Web design and the basics of XHTML, pay special atten-
tion to the introduction to working with XHTML and CSS in Chapter 4. If all 
you want to do is create a simple Web page for your mobile site, the instruc-
tions that follow are all you need. If you don’t have Dreamweaver, copy the 
XHTML MP code at the end of this exercise into any text editor and fill in the 
text and image references with your own content to make the page your own.
In Dreamweaver, follow these steps to create a simple page with XHTML MP 
that displays well on a variety of mobile devices:
 
1. Choose File➪New.
 
 The New Document window opens, as shown in Figure 3-5.
 
Figure 3-5:

2. In the leftmost column, click the Blank Page tab.
 
3. In the Page Type list, select HTML.
 
4. In the Layout section, select <none>.
 
5. To make the code more mobile-friendly, choose XHTML Mobile 1.0 
from the DocType drop-down list, as shown in Figure 3-5.
 
 By default, Dreamweaver creates pages using the XHTML Transitional 
1.0 doctype, which is the best option for most Web pages. If you’re work-
ing on a site for the mobile Web, however, change this setting to XHTML 
Mobile 1.0, and Dreamweaver uses the correct doctype for the mobile 
Web page. (You find a list of doctype options and their best uses at the 
end of Chapter 5.)

70
Part II: Following Mobile Web Standards 
 
6. Click the Create button.
 
 The New Document window closes, and a new blank page is created and 
opens in the workspace.
 
7. In the Title field, at the top of the workspace, type a title.
 
 Although the title isn’t displayed in many mobile Web browsers (including 
the Motorola RAZR, shown in Figure 3-3), it’s still good practice to include 
a title for mobile phones that do (such as the BlackBerry Bold, shown in 
Figure 3-4). Title text is also used when a visitor bookmarks a Web page.
 
8. Choose File➪Save, navigate to the folder where you want to save the 
file, enter a name for the page, and click the Save button.
 
 It’s best to save the mobile version of your site in a subfolder with a name 
such as mobile, or simply m. Then name your mobile page the same as 
the main page of your site, such as index.html or index.php, depending on 
the technology you’re using and your server. For example, suppose that 
you save the page as index.html in a folder named mobile. When you pub-
lish the mobile version of your site in its own folder, the address for your 
site is www.domainname.com/mobile. If you can create subdomains on 
your server, using an address like m.domainname.com is an even better 
option because low-end mobile phones, such as the RAZR, which are lim-
ited to a number keypad, make it difficult to enter a slash mark.
 
9. Enter text on the page as you would on any other Web page.
 
 Simply type to enter text into the main workspace in Dreamweaver.
 
10. Format text with basic XHTML tags, such as heading tags, as shown in 
Figure 3-6.
 
 It’s good practice to use basic HTML tags, such as the heading tags, to 
format headlines. Similarly, you should separate images and sections of 
text with the <div> divider tag, <p> paragraph tag, or break tag <br />.
 
11. Choose Insert➪Image and add one or two small images.
 
 Use very small, optimized images that load quickly. (For more on the 
best image options for mobile Web design, see Chapter 8.)
 
12. Specify the height and width attributes in the image tag.
 
 If you’ve optimized the image to a small enough size to display well on 
all devices (220 pixels wide or less), you can safely include the height 
and width attributes, which Dreamweaver inserts automatically.
 
 Alternatively, you can use a larger image (320 pixels wide is a good 
option) and set the width to a percentage so that the image adjusts to 
the size of the device. In the example shown in Figure 3-7, we changed 
the width by entering 95% in the W (width) field in the Properties 
inspector. At this setting, the image will fill 95 percent of the available 
space in the display area of any mobile browser. You don’t need to spec-
ify a height.

13. Set your links:
 
a. Select an image or a section of text that you want to serve as the link 
and then choose Insert➪Hyperlink.
 
 The Insert Hyperlink dialog box opens.
 
b. In the URL field, enter the address of the page where you want the 
link to open.

72

 You can create links to other pages on your site or another site. 
You can also copy the URL to a Google map or a YouTube video 
and paste it into the Link field.
 
14. To indicate that this is a mobile-friendly page, add a meta tag 
as follows:
 
a. Choose Insert➪HTML➪Head Tags➪Meta.
 
 The Meta dialog box opens.
 
b. Select Name from the Attribute drop-down list.
 
c. Type HandheldFriendly in the Value field.
 
d. Type True in the Content field.
 
 Your screen looks like Figure 3-8.
 
e. Click OK.
 
15. Choose File➪Preview➪Device Central and then click any device to 
view the page in one of the mobile device simulators in Dreamweaver 
(see Figure 3-9).

If you don’t have Device Central, a simple way to test your HTML page is to 
reduce the size of your browser window to 320 pixels, or even to 240 pixels, 
to see how the page will display on a small screen.

The best way to test your mobile page designs is to view them on real mobile 
devices. Simply reducing the size of a browser window gives you only a general 
idea of how the page will appear on a small screen, and even mobile simula-
tors, such as the ones included in Adobe Device Central, can’t replicate all 
the limitations of real-world mobile phones working over wireless carriers. 
Chapter 7 has tips for testing your pages and a list of resources, including more 
sophisticated mobile simulators than the ones included in Device Central.
Making it easy for people to call
Turning a phone number into a link that activates the dial feature on many 
mobile phones requires a simple piece of HTML code. The code is similar to 
what you use to turn an e-mail address into a link that launches an e-mail pro-
gram and starts a message on your user’s computer.
Follow these instructions to make a phone number hot, meaning users can 
click the number on their mobile device to initiate a phone call:

74
Part II: Following Mobile Web Standards 
 
1. Type the phone number into your Web page.
 
2. Turn the phone number into a link.
 
• If you’re using Adobe Dreamweaver, select the phone number, 
choose Insert➪Hyperlink, and enter the phone number in the Link 
field. Add the text tel: to the beginning of the number in the Link 
field, as shown in Figure 3-10. Note that there is no space between 
tel: and the number.
 
• If you’re using a text editor, type the following:
 
<a href=”tel:555-555-5555”>555-555-5555</a>
 
Figure 3-10: 
Users can 
simply click 
the phone 
number to 
initiate a 
call.
 
 
Note that the only thing different from the standard link tag is the addition 
of tel: to make the telephone number active. This is similar to the code for 
an e-mail link, which uses mailto: before an e-mail address to make the e-mail 
address active.
Writing the XHTML MP code
Following is the XHTML code we created in Dreamweaver in the earlier section 
for the simplest XVIVO page layout with all the details removed (see Figure 
3-11). You can type this code into any text editor or Web design program to 
create a simple mobile Web page. If you prefer not to do that much typing 
(or you don’t want to risk making typos), go to www.digitalfamily.com/
mobile and copy the code from there.
 
Although we used some CSS in the example shown in the figures in the earlier 
exercise, we left it out of this code example to keep this code simpler and 
easier to copy. You don’t have to use CSS when designing for the mobile Web, 
but you have more formatting options in most mobile devices if you use CSS. 
On our Web site at www.digitalfamily.com/mobile we include both ver-
sions of this code, with and without the CSS, for your reference. (See Chapters 
4 and 5 for more on designing pages with CSS.)

Adding links to maps and multimedia
Even on the simplest mobile sites, you can include far more than just text, 
images, and links by linking to third-party sites for special features, such as 
videos and maps.
If your page has an address, include a link to its Google map or a link to 
MapQuest (www.mapquest.com) for directions so users can find you easily. 
Otherwise, users have to memorize or write down the address and then navi-
gate to a map site and enter the address because most mobile phones don’t 
allow you to copy and paste or to have more than one open browser window. 

77
 Chapter 3: Creating a Simple Mobile Site
Save your users the hassle by simply entering your address into http://
maps.google.com and then including a link to that page on your site.
You can include video, audio, and other rich multimedia, such as slide 
shows, through YouTube. YouTube delivers mobile-friendly content to a 
variety of mobile phones and other devices, and if you link to a video on 
YouTube, you can be sure that it will be optimized for your user.

Understanding XHTML and CSS
In This Chapter
▶ Exploring HTML and XHTML
▶ Understanding mobile Web design and layout options
▶ Styling Web pages with CSS
S
ince the early days of the Web, one of the biggest challenges when 
designing Web pages is making them look good in all the different Web 
browsers in use on the Internet. The creators of Web browsers and the com-
panies that create software for designing Web pages do not always agree on 
the same standards. That means that even on desktop computers a page that 
looks great in Firefox 3 may be unreadable in Internet Explorer 6.0 (widely 
considered one of the most problematic Web browsers on the Internet).
The mobile Web makes designing Web pages even more complicated because 
so many different types of cell phones and other devices exist and they use 
different kinds of software.
Most professional designers agree that the best way to create a Web page is 
to follow the latest in Web standards and use XHTML (eXtensible Hypertext 
Markup Language, a strict form of HTML) with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).
In the next few chapters, we focus on the many versions of XHTML and CSS 
and why you might use one over another for designing mobile sites. But 
before we describe the variations that work best for mobile use, it’s impor-
tant to understand the basics of XHTML and CSS.
If you’re already an expert in XHTML and CSS design, I recommend that you 
at least skim this chapter because the basic concepts covered here are the 
foundation for the more advanced topics that follow.

Part II: Following Mobile Web Standards 
HTM-What? Exploring HTML and XHTML
Contrary to popular belief, HTML isn’t a programming language. Rather, it’s 
a markup language: That is, HTML is designed to “mark up” a page, or to pro-
vide instructions for how a Web page should look. HTML is written by using 
tags, markup instructions that tell a Web browser how the page should be 
displayed. For example, to make a section of text italic, you use the HTML tag 
<em>, which stands for emphasis. Most tags in HTML include both an open 
tag and a close tag, indicated by the forward slash /. Thus, to make the name 
of this book appear in italics, I would write the code like this:
<em>Mobile Web Design For Dummies</em>
XHTML is a stricter version of HTML and is the recommended language for 
Web design today. XHTML differs from HTML in several ways. For example, 
XHTML must be written in lowercase letters but HTML tags can be written 
in uppercase or lowercase. Also, XHTML, unlike HTML, requires that all tags 
include a close tag (more on that later in this chapter). All templates and 
code examples in this book follow the XHTML standard.
To see what the code behind a Web page looks like in most browsers, choose 
View➪Source. If you’re using Dreamweaver, as shown in Figure 4-1, you can 
click the Split button (in the upper-left corner of the workspace) to see the 
code and the design areas of the program at the same time in split view.
 
Split view in Dreamweaver is a useful way to keep an eye on what’s going on 
behind the scenes, and, as a bonus, it can help you learn a lot of XHTML.
Dreamweaver offers three view options:
 
✓ Code: In code view, you see only the XHTML and other code.
 
✓ Split: In split view, the page is divided so you can see the code in one 
part of the workspace and a view of the how the page should be dis-
played in a Web browser in the other part.
 
✓ Design: In design view, you see the page as it should appear in a Web 
browser.
Dreamweaver’s split, code, and design views are integrated, so if you select 
something in design view, such as the headline you see in Figure 4-1, the 
same text is highlighted in code view, making it easy to find your place in 
the code.
If at first glance you think that XHTML code looks like hieroglyphics, don’t 
give up too quickly. With just a little experience, you can start to recognize 
common tags, such as the <h1> (heading 1) tag that was used to format the 
headline on the page shown in Figure 4-2.

Figure 4-2: 
A heading 
1 tag high-
lighted in

To help distinguish the code from the text in a Web page, Dreamweaver dis-
plays tags in a contrasting color, usually blue. You can change the size, color, 
font, and other features of the code in Dreamweaver’s preferences.
Following are a few points to help you better understand XHTML:
 
✓ In XHTML, all tags must include the closing slash. XHTML tags, even 
those that stand alone such as the <br /> tag, must have a close tag, 
and close tags always contain a forward slash (/). For example, the line 
break tag is <br> in HTML, but <br /> in XHTML.
 
✓ XHTML includes many hierarchical tags. Examples are the <h1> 
through <h6> tags, which are ideally suited to formatting text accord-
ing to its importance on a Web page. Reserve the <h1> tag for the most 
important text on the page, such as the top headline. <h2> is ideal for 
subheads or secondary headings, <h3> for the third level of headings, 
and so on. A headline formatted with the <h1> tag looks like this:
<h1>This is a headline</h1>

82
Part II: Following Mobile Web Standards 
 
✓ Some tags are complex, and the open and close tags don’t always match. 
More complicated tags, such as the tags used to create links or insert 
images into pages, are more challenging to use because they include link 
information, and the close tag doesn’t always match the open tag. For exam-
ple, the code to create a link to another Web site looks like this:
<a href=”http://www.digitalfamily.com”>This is a link 
to DigitalFamily.com</a>
 
At its heart, XHTML is just text, and believe it or not, you can write XHTML in 
a plain-text editor as simple as Notepad, SimpleText, or TextEdit. You have to 
be careful to type all the code perfectly because there is no room for errors 
or typos in XHTML. After writing code yourself, even to create a simple page, 
you’re sure to quickly appreciate programs — such as Dreamweaver — that 
write the code for you.
One of the great advantages of using Dreamweaver is that you can specify 
formatting by clicking buttons or using menu commands instead of writing 
the XHTML code. For this and many other reasons, we use Dreamweaver in 
this book.
Creating Page Designs with HTML Tables
In the early days of Web design, most page layouts on the Web were created 
with tables. By merging and splitting table cells, and even adding background 
images, you could create complex Web designs with tables. CSS expands 
upon this concept by adding many new design options, including the capabil-
ity to precisely add margins and padding around elements as well as better 
control over how and where background images appear.
How Web browsers work
Web browsers such as Internet Explorer, 
Firefox, Safari, and most microbrowsers for 
cellphones are designed to decipher HTML, 
XHTML, CSS, AJAX, and other code and display 
the corresponding text, images, and multimedia 
on a computer screen. Essentially, browsers 
read the code in a Web page and interpret how 
the page should be displayed to visitors.
Unfortunately, because Web browsers are cre-
ated by different companies and the code they 
display has evolved dramatically over the years, 
not all Web browsers display Web pages the 
same way. Differences in browser display can 
lead to unpredictable (and often frustrating) 
results because a page that looks good in one 
browser may be unreadable in another. Add all 
the mobile devices on the Web and that chal-
lenge only gets worse. Much worse. For more 
information on testing your mobile page design 
to make sure it looks good to all your visitors, 
see Chapter 7.

83
 Chapter 4: Understanding XHTML and CSS
CSS also enables you to keep formatting information separate from content, 
making it possible to use less code and create pages with smaller file sizes, 
which download more quickly. Using CSS also makes pages easier to update 
because you can streamline formatting changes. You can read more about 
CSS in the next section, “Designing with Cascading Style Sheets.”
Figure 4-3 provides an example of an old-school site created with the HTML 
<table> tag. To help you appreciate how this page was created, I altered the 
original design to display the table borders. (Most designers turn off table 
borders to create a cleaner layout.)
 
If you visit the site at www.chocolategamerules.com, you can see how this 
same page was created using <div> tags and CSS. (I explain how <div> tags 
work within CSS in “Designing with Cascading Style Sheets” later in this chapter.)
Although tables are no longer recommended for creating page layouts, 
they’re still considered the best way to format tabular data, like the data in 
a spreadsheet program. In mobile designs, however, it’s important to limit 
the overall width of tables so that they fit on the smaller mobile screens. 
For example, you use tables to format a consistent collection of information, 
such as the photos and scores in the list of winners from the Chocolate Game 
Rules site shown in Figure 4-4, but when creating a page for the mobile Web, 
we would recommend you reduce the image size and use narrower columns 
than those used in the desktop page design.
 
Figure 4-3: 
In the old 
days, HTML 
tables con-
trolled text 
and image 
placement.
 

84
Part II: Following Mobile Web Standards 
I understand that many designers still find it easier to create layouts with 
tables, and not everyone has time to redesign their Web sites right away. 
However, I recommend using only CSS today for all your Web page layouts, 
except when you are creating a layout for tabular data. And in those tables, 
use CSS to add styling, such as background colors or padding.
 
In mobile Web design it’s even more important not to use tables for layout 
because many mobile devices don’t render tables well and tables with more 
than two rows generally won’t fit on the mobile small screens.
 
Figure 4-4: 
Tables are 
still con-
sidered the 
best way 
to display 
tabular data 
like the 
rows and 
columns of 
information 
here.
 
Don’t even think about using HTML frames
Frames enable you to display multiple Web 
pages in one browser window. When you use 
frames, the URL at the top of a Web browser 
doesn’t change, even when you click links 
and change the pages displayed within the 
frames. As a result, you can only bookmark, or 
create a link to, the first page of a site that uses 
frames. Worse yet, frames make it harder for 
search engines to index a site properly, which 
can diminish your search engine ranking. On 
a mobile device, frames are a very bad idea 
because there just isn’t enough room to display 
multiple pages. For these reasons, we, like most 
designers, don’t like frames. 

85
 Chapter 4: Understanding XHTML and CSS
Designing with Cascading Style Sheets
The concept of creating styles has been around since long before the Web. 
Desktop publishing programs (such as Adobe InDesign) and word processing 
programs (such as Microsoft Word) use styles to manage the formatting and 
editing of text designed to be printed. In a word processor, you can create 
and save styles for common features, such as headlines and captions. In 
Desktop publishing and word processing programs, styles are great timesav-
ers because they enable you to combine a collection of formatting options 
(such as Arial and bold and italic) into one style and then apply all those 
options at once to any selected text in your document by using only a single 
style. The advantage is that if you change a style, you can automatically 
apply the change everywhere you’ve used that style in a document.
With CSS, you can use style sheets for more than just text formatting. For 
example, you can use CSS to create styles that align images to the left or right 
side of a page, add padding around text or images, and change background 
and link colors. You can also create more than one style sheet for the same 
page — say, one style sheet that makes your design look good on computers, 
another for cellphones, and a third for printed pages. For all these reasons 
(and more), CSS has quickly become the preferred method of designing Web 
pages among professional Web designers.
Appreciating the advantages of CSS
A Web site designed with CSS separates content from design. Keeping the site 
content (such as the text and headings) separate from the instructions that 
tell a browser how the page should look benefits both the designers and your 
site visitors:
 
✓ CSS simplifies design changes. For example, instead of formatting 
every headline in your site as 24-point Arial bold, you can create a style 
for the <h1> tag that contains all the formatting information and then 
apply that style to the text in the XHTML file. You save CSS styles in the 
header section at the very top of an XHTML page or in a separate file 
that you can attach to multiple XHTML pages. If you decide later that 
you want your headlines to use the Garamond font rather than Arial, you 
simply change the style for the <h1> tag once.
 
✓ Separating content from design enables you to create different style 
sheets for different audiences and devices. In the future, separating 
content from design is likely to become even more important as a grow-
ing number of people view Web pages on everything from giant, flat-
screen monitors to tiny, cellphone screens, as shown in Figure 4-5.

86
Part II: Following Mobile Web Standards 
 
Figure 4-5: 
With CSS, 
you can 
create 
designs that 
display well 
on large 
or small 
screens.
 
 
✓ Using CSS makes your site comply with the current standards. Today, 
the W3C, which sets standards for the Internet, recommends using CSS 
for nearly every aspect of Web design because the best CSS designs are 
accessible, flexible, and adaptable.
 
✓ Pages designed with CSS have cleaner, leaner code. CSS is a more effi-
cient way of designing pages than the HTML attributes we used to use 
because attributes had to be repeated throughout a page, even when 
you were adding the same formatting. In contrast, one defined style 
can be used many times throughout a site. The less code, the faster 
pages load, which is especially important when you’re designing for 
mobile devices.
 
✓ Web sites designed in CSS are accessible to more visitors. Today, 
there’s a growing movement among some of the best designers in the 
world to get everyone to follow the same standards, create Web sites 
with CSS, and make sure they’re accessible to everyone.
 
 When Web designers talk about accessibility, they mean creating a site 
that can be accessed by anyone who might visit your pages — including 
people with limited vision who use special browsers (often called screen 
readers) that read Web pages aloud as well as others who use special-
ized browsers for a variety of other reasons.

87
 Chapter 4: Understanding XHTML and CSS
 
 If you work for a university, a nonprofit, a government agency, or a 
similar organization, you may be required to create accessible designs. 
Even if you’re not required to design for accessibility, it’s still good to do 
so because pages that meet accessibility standards also tend to score 
better in search engines.
Combining CSS and XHTML
Most professional Web designers today recommend creating Web page 
designs by combining XHTML and CSS. How the two work together can be 
complicated, but you essentially do the following:
 
1. Use XHTML to create the structure of a page with tags, such as division 
<div>, heading (<h1>, <h2>, and so on), and paragraph <p>.
 
2. Create styles in CSS that specify the size of these elements, where they 
appear on a page, and a variety of other formatting options.
Similarly, you use XHTML to insert images and create links, and then add 
styles to change formatting options, such as removing the underline from 
your links or changing the color that appears when someone rolls a cursor 
over a link.
Creating page layouts with CSS and XHTML
The key to understanding how CSS works in page layout is to think in terms 
of designing with a series of infinitely adjustable containers, or boxes. This 
approach to Web design is commonly referred to as the box model. First you 
use HTML tags, such as the <div> tag or <p> tag, to create a box around 
your content. Then you use CSS to style each box, controlling the position 
and alignment of each box with attributes and specifying such settings as 
margins, padding, and borders.
Although you can use any XHTML tag as part of your page layout, the <div> 
tag is used most often to create the boxes for the main sections of a page, 
such as the banner area, main content area, sidebars, and footer. The <div> 
tag is like a generic container designed to hold text, images, or other content, 
or it makes a division on the page that separates one section of content from 
another. Unlike other XHTML tags, <div> has no inherent formatting fea-
tures. Unless CSS is applied to a <div> tag, it can seem invisible on a page. 
However, the tag has a powerful purpose because any content surrounded 
by opening and closing <div> tags becomes an object (or a box) that can be 
formatted with CSS. When you create or edit a style that corresponds to a 
<div> tag ID, you can specify properties such as alignment, border, margin, 
height, and width to control how the <div> tag is displayed on the page.

88
Part II: Following Mobile Web Standards 
In many CSS layouts, each <div> has an ID, which corresponds to a style 
in the style sheet (although you can use Class styles with <div> tags, it’s 
common to use ID styles for the main <div> tags on the page). The ID 
appears in the XHTML within the <div> tag brackets so that the browser 
knows which style to use to control the formatting of that <div> when it 
displays the page. For example, all the templates have a <div> with the ID 
container that controls the overall size of the design area. In the code, the 
<div> looks like this:
<div id=”container”></div>
In the corresponding style sheet, which you can easily access through the 
CSS panel in Dreamweaver, you’ll find a style called #container, which con-
trols the width and other settings for that <div>. If this is confusing, don’t 
worry too much at this stage; my main goal here is to introduce you to the 
general concepts of XHTML and CSS.
You can find many more lessons on how to create, define, and edit CSS styles 
in Dreamweaver CS5 For Dummies (Wiley).
Understanding style selectors
When you create a new style, you need to know which selector to use for 
which job. You can use four main selector types when designing with CSS. 
If you’re new to working with styles, understanding each selector and its 
respective restrictions and best uses is a good place to start. The descrip-
tions of each selector in this section can help you understand your options 
before you move on.
 
Don’t feel you have to memorize this information. Instead, refer to this list of 
selectors when you create and edit styles later.
Class selectors
The class selector is the most versatile selector option. You can use class 
styles as many times as you want to format any element (from text to images 
to multimedia on any page in a Web site).
Class style names begin with a period and cannot contain any spaces or spe-
cial characters (for example, no apostrophes or exclamation points). Note: 
Hyphens and dashes are okay. Thus, you could create a style called caption 
for the text that appears after your pictures, but “my cool captions!” would 
not be a good name for a class style. Here’s what a class style named caption 
should look like:
.caption

89
 Chapter 4: Understanding XHTML and CSS
If you choose class as the selector type and forget to include a period (dot) 
at the beginning of the name, Dreamweaver adds one for you. Note: Don’t 
include any space between the dot and the style name.
However, when you apply a class style to text or another element, the dot 
doesn’t appear in the name when it’s added to your HTML code. Thus, if you 
applied the .caption style to a paragraph tag to format the text below an 
image, it would look like this:
<p class=”caption”>This is a photo of an Egret in 
flight.</p>
 
Class styles must be applied to an element, such as the paragraph tag shown 
in this example. You can add class tags to elements that are already defined 
by other styles.
When you create a class style in Dreamweaver, the style is displayed in the 
CSS Styles panel on the right side of the workspace (shown in Figure 4-6). You 
can apply class styles by using the CSS drop-down list, also shown in 
the figure.
 
Figure 4-6: 
To create 
a style with 
a class 
selector, 
use the CSS 
drop-down 
list.
 

90
Part II: Following Mobile Web Standards 
A common style is one that aligns images and other elements to the right 
or left of a page. In all our Web sites, we create two such styles to align 
images to the right and left of any page and name them .float-right and 
.float-left. These styles typically include margin spacing to create a 
little white space between an image and text when the text wraps around the 
aligned image (refer to Figure 4-6).
ID selectors
ID styles are the building blocks of most CSS layouts. You should use ID 
styles only one time per page, making them ideally suited to formatting 
<div> tags and other block-level elements that are used to create distinct 
sections in a design and appear only once per page.
ID styles must begin with a pound (#) character. Dreamweaver adds # to the 
beginning of the style name automatically if you forget to include it. As with a 
class style, don’t include a space between # and the style name.
The ID selector option is a new addition to the CSS Rule dialog box in 
Dreamweaver CS4. (In CS3, you had to choose the Advanced option to create 
an ID style.) Like class styles, you can name ID styles anything you like as 
long as you don’t use spaces or special characters (hyphens and under-
scores are okay). An ID style used to identify the sidebar section of a page 
might look like this:
#sidebar
The # isn’t used in the HTML code when you apply a style to an element, 
such as a <div> tag:
<div id=”sidebar”>Between these tags with the sidebar ID 
style, you would include any headlines, text, 
or other elements in your sidebar.</div>
In the predesigned CSS layouts included in Dreamweaver, all the designs are 
created by combining a series of <div> tags with ID styles using names such 
as #container, #header, and #footer to identify the main sections of the 
design. Figure 4-7 shows a collection of ID and class styles displayed in the 
CSS Styles panel.
Tag selectors
The tag selector is used to redefine existing XHTML tags. Select this option 
if you want to change the appearance of an existing XHTML tag, such as the 
<h1> (heading 1) tag or <ul> (unordered list) tag.

91
 Chapter 4: Understanding XHTML and CSS
 
Figure 4-7: 
Styles 
created 
with the ID 
selector are 
used only 
once per 
page and 
are ideal for 
creating a 
CSS layout.
 
Redefining existing XHTML tags with CSS often has advantages over creat-
ing new styles. For example, the Web recognizes content formatted with 
the heading 1 tag as the most important text on the page. For that reason, 
many search engines give priority to text formatted with the heading 1 tag. 
Similarly, the hierarchical structure of the <h1>–<h6> tags helps ensure that 
text formatted with the heading 1 tag will be larger relative to text formatted 
with the heading 2 tag (and so on), even if visitors to your site change the 
text size in their Web browser.
Because you can change the appearance of headings and other tags with CSS, 
you can use common XHTML tags with all of the advantages they offer, while 
still being able to define the font, size, color, spacing, and other formatting 
options that you prefer in your Web design. When you use the tag selector to 
create a new style, the style definition you create for each tag is applied auto-
matically to any text or other element formatted with that tag. For example, if 
you format a headline with an <h1> tag and then create a new <h1> style, the 
new style (and its formatting) replaces the original style of the <h1> tag.
When you use Adobe Dreamweaver to create a new style, the New style 
dialog includes a drop-down list where you can choose a tag selector type. 
If you choose the tag selected, a long list of XHTML tags appears in a drop-
down list in the New CSS Rule dialog box. This list makes it easy to select the 
tag style you want to create, such as the <h1> tag shown in Figure 4-8.

Creating compound styles
You use the compound selector to combine two or more style rules. The 
advantage of compound styles is that you can create style definitions that 
control the formatting of elements in one part of a page differently from the 
way they are formatted in another because compound styles only work in 
places were a defined style is contained within another style. Compound 
styles are useful when you want to do something like use the heading 1 tag 
multiple times to format headlines in different ways on the same Web page. 
For example, you could create one style for headlines that appear in the main 
story area of a page and another style for headlines that appear in the side-
bar on the page but use the heading 1 tag to format both.
To create a compound style, you combine the ID, class, or tag styles. For 
example:
#sidebar1 h1
Figure 4-9 shows you how an <h1> style defined within a #sidebar1 ID style 
looks in the New CSS Rule dialog box. Note that in a compound style, you 
must include a space between each name or tag in a compound style, and 
you don’t include the brackets around the tag. In this example, the style defi-
nition applies only to <h1> tags that appear within another element, such as 
a <div> tag with an ID style #sidebar1.
If a compound style combines more than one tag, it’s written like this:
#sidebar1 h1 a:link

93
 Chapter 4: Understanding XHTML and CSS
 
Figure 4-9: 
Use the 
compound 
style 
selector to 
combine 
styles and 
create more 
specific 
style 
definitions.
 
Again, you must include a space between each name or tag. In this example, 
you see a style that defines the appearance of the active link tag only when 
the link is located inside an element formatted with the <h1> tag inside an 
element formatted with the #sidebar1 ID. A compound style like this makes 
it possible to create links that look different in a headline in the sidebar of a 
page and in another part of the sidebar.
Here’s another example of a compound style that includes styles created 
with an ID and class selector. This style would specify the way the class style 
.caption should appear only when it is contained within the <div> tag 
styled with the ID #sidebar. Note that there is a space between each style 
name and that the punctuation used in class and ID styles is maintained.
#sidebar .caption
Understanding rule definition options
In CSS, you have the option of creating internal, external, or inline styles. You 
can also use a combination of these options, or attach multiple external style 
sheets to the same Web page. Following is an explanation of these options:
 
✓ Internal styles: If you create internal styles, the CSS code is stored in 
the <head> area at the top of the HTML page you’re working on, and 
the styles can be applied only to the page in which they were created. If 
you’re creating a one-page Web site or creating styles that will be used 
only on one page, an internal style sheet is fine, but for most sites, exter-
nal style sheets offer more advantages.

94
Part II: Following Mobile Web Standards 
 
✓ External styles: If you save your styles in an external style sheet, they’re 
stored in a separate file with the .css extension. External style sheets 
can be attached to any or all pages in a Web site in much the same way 
that you can insert the same image into multiple pages. You can also 
attach multiple external style sheets to the same page. For example, you 
can create one style sheet for styles that format text and another for 
layout styles. You can also create external style sheets for different pur-
poses, such as one for print and one for screen display. One of the big-
gest advantages of external style sheets is that they make it faster and 
easier to create new pages, and they make it possible to update styles 
across many pages at once. Note: You can attach more than one exter-
nal style sheet to the same Web page.
 
✓ Inline styles: Inline styles are created in a document where the style is 
used and applied only to the element it’s attached to in the document. 
These styles are the least useful of the three style sheet options because 
any changes to the defined style must be made to the code that contains 
the element, which means you lose many of the benefits of styles, such 
as the ability to make global updates and create clean, fast-loading code. 
For example, creating one style for all your headlines and saving it in an 
external style sheet is more efficient than applying the style formatting 
options to each headline separately using inline styles.
At the bottom of the New CSS Rule dialog box, shown in Figure 4-10, you find 
a Rule Definition drop-down list. Use this list to specify where and how you 
want to save each new style that you define. The options are
 
✓ This Document Only: Create an internal style that can only be used in 
the open document.
 
✓ New Style Sheet file: Create the new style in an external style sheet and 
create a new external style sheet simultaneously.
 
✓ An existing external style sheet: Choose any existing external style 
sheet attached to the page by selecting the name of the style sheet from 
the Rule Definition drop-down list (see Figure 4-10, in which the existing 
style sheet named main.css is being selected).
 
Figure 4-10: 
When defin-
ing a new 
CSS rule, 
save it in 
an internal 
or external 
style sheet.
 

95
 Chapter 4: Understanding XHTML and CSS
 
If you’re creating a style that you’ll likely want to use on more than one page 
in your site, save the style to a new or existing external style sheet. If you save 
a style in an internal style sheet and later decide you want to add it to an 
external style sheet, you can move the style by dragging the style into the 
external style sheet list in the CSS Styles panel.
Why so many fonts?
Although you can specify any font you want for 
text on your Web pages, you don’t have com-
plete control over how that font appears on 
your visitor’s computer because the font you 
apply is displayed properly only if your visitors 
have the same font on their hard drives. To help 
ensure that your text appears as you intend, 
Dreamweaver includes collections of the most 
common fonts on Windows and Macintosh 
computers, grouped in families, such as Arial, 
Helvetica, sans serif, and Georgia, Times New 
Roman, Times, and serif.
When you apply a collection of fonts like these 
to your Web page, the browser displays the for-
matted text in the first font available in the list. 
For example, if you choose the Georgia font col-
lection and your visitors have Georgia on their 
hard drives, they’ll see your text in Georgia. If 
they don’t have Georgia, the text will be dis-
played in the next font on the list — in this case, 
Times New Roman — if your visitors have that 
font. If they don’t have that font either, the text 
is displayed in Times; if they don’t even have 
Times (which would be unusual), the browser 
looks for any serif font. (A serif font, such as 
Times, has little curly things on the edges of let-
ters; sans serif, such as Arial, means no curly 
things.)
You can create your own font collections by 
selecting the Edit Font List option at the bottom 
of the Font-Family drop-down list in the Property 
inspector or the Type category of the CSS Rule 
Definition dialog box. Use the plus and minus 
buttons at the top of the Edit Font List dialog 
box, shown here, to add or remove a font col-
lection. To add individual fonts to a collection, 
select the font name from the bottom right of the 
dialog box and use the double left arrows to add 
it to a font list. (Use the double right arrows to 
remove a font from a collection.)
The only way to ensure that text appears in the 
font you want is to create the text in a graphic 
in a program, such as Photoshop or Fireworks, 
and then insert the graphic with the text into 
your page. That’s not a bad option for special 
text, such as banners or logos, but it’s usu-
ally not a good option for all your text because 
graphics take longer to download than text and 
are harder to update.

96
Part II: Following Mobile Web Standards 
Looking at the code behind the scenes
Even if you prefer not to look at the code behind your Web pages, it’s helpful 
to at least have some familiarity with different kinds of tags, CSS, and other 
code that Dreamweaver creates for you when you design Web pages. The 
following examples show what the CSS code in an internal or external style 
sheet looks like in Dreamweaver for the following styles:
 
✓ An ID style created with the ID selector named #container and defined 
as 960 pixels wide with the left and right margins set to auto (a cool trick 
for centering a CSS design).
#container {
 
width: 960px;
 
margin-right: auto;
 
margin-left: auto;
}
 
✓ A style created with a class selector named .caption and defined as 
Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans serif, small, italic, and bold.
.caption {
 
font-family:  Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-
serif;
 
font-size: small;
 
font-style: italic;
 
font-weight: bold;
}
 
✓ A style created with a tag selector to redefine the HTML tag <h1> as 
Arial, Helvetica, sans serif, large, and bold. (Note: Because the heading 
tags already include bold formatting, it’s not necessary to include bold 
in the style definition.)
H1 {
 
font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
 
font-size: large;
}

n a recurring story line in the popular Peanuts comic strip, Lucy pulls the 
football away from Charlie Brown, just as he’s starting to kick. He ends up 
on his back every time, and every time he seems surprised. If you’ve read the 
comic strip and seen this exchange repeated, you may have trouble imagin-
ing how Charlie Brown could keep coming back to the field and falling for 
Lucy’s prank. Unfortunately, many who have been trying to choose the right 
markup language for mobile Web design are starting to feel a special connec-
tion to Charlie Brown.
Although no one is trying to prank you on the mobile Web (at least as far as 
we know), the number of markup languages that have come and gone and 
the inconsistent support you’ll find among the different devices may make 
you feel like the ball is getting yanked away just as you are about to kick it 
through the end zone.
At the risk of leaving you feeling tricked yet again, the best option for most 
mobile Web designs is the XHTML Mobile Profile (or XHTML MP), and there 
is growing reason to be optimistic about using HTML5 in the future. Indeed, 
if you have the luxury of designing multiple sites or you’re focusing your 
efforts only on designing for high-end smartphones, you can go ahead and 
use HTML5 right away.

98
Part II: Following Mobile Web Standards 
In this chapter, we explore the range of mobile design options, from the early 
days when WML (Wireless Markup Language) was the soup du jour, to a 
glimpse of what the future and HTML5 have to offer. Although the basic 
concepts of HTML and CSS, covered in Chapter 4, remain the same on the 
mobile Web, which version is best to use still depends on the devices for 
which you’re designing. Many mobile designers create more than one 
version of their mobile Web site, which is why we cover the range of options 
in this chapter.
Reviewing Markup Languages
To help you keep all the options in markup languages in perspective, we 
begin with a quick review of how everyone got to where they are today. 
The World Wide Web was built on good old HTML, the Hypertext Markup 
Language, which was born out of SGML, the Standard Generalized Markup 
Language, which dates all the way back to 1986 — the same year the song, 
“That’s What Friends Are For,” sung by Dionne Warwick, Elton John, and 
Gladys Knight, topped the pop charts. (Yeah, it’s nice to have friends to lean 
on when you’re figuring out all this techy stuff.)
XML, eXtensible Markup Language, was also born out of SGML. And if you’re 
starting to think that all these acronyms would make a good skit on SNL (the 
Saturday Night Live comedy show), we’d love to consult with you about script 
ideas. XML caught on so well that it became a standard for sharing data 
across all kinds of documents and systems.
The popularity of XML led to the evolution of HTML to XHTML. Essentially, 
XHTML is a more restrictive subset of SGML, one that can be read better by 
XML parsers because it follows the rules so strictly. If you can picture the 
typical “odd couple,” HTML is the sloppy roommate, and XHTML keeps the 
contents of the medicine cabinet in alphabetical order.
You could think of HTML5 as what happens when HMTL grows up, gets a job, 
and has to start wearing socks, at least most of the time. HTML5 is not as 
strict as XHTML (slobs never clean up completely), but it has some grown-up 
features, such as better ways of presenting multimedia and location aware-
ness, which make it especially exciting in the mobile world.
This five-minute version of the history of XHTML, however, is only part of the 
story of how people got to where they are today. In what many now consider a 
misguided effort, the makers of the first mobile Web browsers created another 
markup language, WML. Perhaps an understandable reaction to the limited 
options of early feature phones, WML is quickly being discarded today.

99
 Chapter 5: Comparing Mobile Markup Languages
And while we’re introducing acronyms, we should note that Wireless 
Application Protocol (WAP) describes everything related to the mobile Web. 
WAP 1.0 represents the earliest attempts at mobile Web design, including 
sites created with WML.
When the mobile Web evolved to WAP 2.0 in 2002, most mobile devices could 
display pages designed in XHTML Basic (a subset of XHTML that has no sup-
port for CSS). Since 2004, most phones can handle XHTML MP, which sup-
ports CSS2 (at least mostly).
C-HTML is yet another mobile markup language you may run into on the Web. 
C-HTML was designed to be used on NTT DOCOMO’s phones in Japan, but 
most mobile designers in Japan now predict that the iPhone’s growing popu-
larity in Japan means C-HTML will eventually be replaced by XHTML MP.
If your head is spinning from all these acronyms, don’t worry. What follows 
are more detailed descriptions of the markup languages you’re most likely to 
need for your mobile designs. You also find a few tips to help you manage the 
transition from WML to XHMTL MP to HTML5.
The good news is that all the code designed for the mobile world is based on 
good old HTML. So if you have a background in HTML, you’re off to a great 
start.
Comparing WML and XHTML MP
The limitations of the early mobile Web led to the creation of WML and then 
XHTML MP. Both WML and XHTML MP are more limited than XHTML, but 
they also add new capabilities specific to mobile design. What can be confus-
ing is that WML and XHTML don’t follow the same rules, so if you’ve been 
working with WML, update to XHTML MP, which we cover in the next section.
Here’s an example: XHTML MP includes attributes, such as tel:, which is a 
great little addition to the link tag that turns a phone number into a link 
that you can click to dial automatically. Here’s what the code looks like in 
XHTML MP:
<a href=”tel:+1-555-555-5555”>+1-555-555-5555</a>
But WML, which came before XHTML MP, has its own code for turning a 
phone number into a link. In WML, the code for a phone number that can be 
dialed automatically looks like this:
<a href=”wtai//wp/mc;+1-555-555-5555”>+1-555-555-5555</a>

100
Part II: Following Mobile Web Standards 
Today, only really old mobile devices are more likely to support the WML 
option: wtai. Newer phones (those made after 2002) all support XHTML 
MP. Unless you design for populations likely to be using very old or recycled 
phones, most mobile designers agree that XHTML MP is the best choice.
In the sections that follow, we explore some of the differences between these 
markup languages and which tags are specific to each. At the end of this 
chapter, you find instructions for adding the correct doctype to your code so 
that browsers know how to render your pages.
In Chapter 6, you discover more about designing multiple versions of a 
mobile site and how to deliver the right version to each device.
Replacing WML with XHTML MP
WML was introduced in the late ’90s, so it’s really old in Web years. Early 
mobile sites were designed with WML, but spending much time on WML 
today seems about as important as going back to HTML 1.0. Some devices 
still support WML, but the few that support only WML are becoming 
obsolete, and every mobile designer we’ve spoken to agrees that WML has 
no future.
Replacing WML with XHTML MP offers many advantages, including the 
following:
 
✓ You can use CSS when you use XHTML MP, which makes it possible to 
separate content from design and create mobile pages with many of the 
same advanced design features of today’s desktop sites.
 
✓ Desktop sites designed in XHTML and CSS can be converted to mobile 
site designs in XHTML MP with minimal changes.
 
✓ You can use the same software to develop desktop and mobile sites. 
(Dreamweaver is our top choice for all Web design, but you can also use 
Microsoft Expression Web or any other programs that support XHTML 
and CSS.)
 
✓ If you already know XHTML and CSS, you can develop mobile sites right 
away because designing pages with XHTML MP is similar.
 
✓ You can use desktop Web browsers to view mobile sites designed in 
XHTML MP, a handy way to test while you’re developing — just make 
sure you test using emulators and real mobile devices before launch 
(see Chapter 7 for more on testing).

101
 Chapter 5: Comparing Mobile Markup Languages
Working with XHTML MP instead of WML has many clear advantages but also 
some tradeoffs. In addition, some mobile developers miss the mobile-specific 
features in WML.
Table 5-1 lists some of the most important WML features that aren’t sup-
ported in XHTML MP as well as the closest equivalent you can use as an 
alternative.

Events
WML supported four events: ontimer,

replace ontimer, but XHTML MP has no 
equivalent for the other events.

XHTML MP does not support variables, but 
you can do similar processing on the server.

You can use server-side scripting or 
JavaScript on devices that support it.
Programmable softkeys
You can use access keys, described later in 
this chapter.
<u> tag
Most Web designers avoid the <u> (under-
line) tag because underlining should be 
restricted to use with links. If you need to 
underline text, you can create a CSS text 
decoration rule.
Posting data using anchor links
Use the submit button to post form data.

Part II: Following Mobile Web Standards 
Following the rules of XHTML MP
As mentioned, if you already have a background in XHTML, XHTML MP is 
relatively easy to figure out. (We include a crash course in XHTML and CSS 
in Chapter 4.) Mostly, you just need to subtract a few tags that aren’t allowed 
in XHTML MP (we provide a list of those tags at the end of this section) and 
add a few new options that are useful on the mobile Web, such as the tel 
attribute described in the section, “Comparing WML and XHTML MP,” earlier 
in this chapter.
 
When you develop pages with XHTML MP, you must follow the rules to the 
letter. Mobile Web browsers are even more unforgiving about errors in code 
than most desktop Web browsers. Even a simple omission, such as a missing 
close tag or a misspelled tag name, can cause a mobile browser to reject 
your page.
In the sections that follow, we describe some of the most important rules of 
XHTML MP.
Don’t include comments and empty spaces
Most Web designers don’t worry about including extra spaces in XHTML 
code because blank spaces and line breaks aren’t displayed in Web browsers 
(mobile or desktop), unless you use the <p> (paragraph) or <br /> 
(break) tag.
Similarly, you can create comments in XHTML MP just as you would in any 
other XHTML document. However, in XHTML, never include double dashes 
within the body of a comment, only at the beginning and end. Here’s an exam-
ple of a properly formatted comment:
<!-- You can add notes to your code by using the comment 
tag in XHTML MP -->
Although spaces and comments aren’t displayed in mobile browsers, the 
memory they require adds up. Every byte counts on the mobile Web, where 
you often want to keep page sizes 7K to 25K. Use extra spaces and comments 
sparingly in XHTML MP or strip them before publishing your pages to the 
server.
Set links with the anchor tag, but don’t target links
Links work nearly the same in XHTML MP as in XHTML, but you can’t use 
the target attribute in XHTML MP to open a link in a new window or tab 
because most mobile devices don’t support tabbed browsing. You can, how-
ever, use the anchor tag (also called a jump link) to link to elements within 

103
 Chapter 5: Comparing Mobile Markup Languages
the same page, an increasingly popular option for managing navigation in a 
limited space. For example, in the Microsoft Cloud site, shown in Figure 5-1, 
the Menu button at the top of the page links to the navigation options at 
the bottom.
 
Figure 5-1: 
Using the 
anchor tag, 
you can 
create links 
to elements 
on the same 
page.
 
If you generally use a touch phone, jump links may seem an unnecessary 
extra because it’s so easy to scroll by sliding your finger down the screen. 
Feature phones, however, can scroll only a few pixels at a time, so jump links 
make navigation less tedious.
The following example is the markup for a page that has a link from the Menu 
button at the top of the page (<a href=”#menu”>) to the anchor at the 
beginning of the list of links (<a id=”menu”>). At the bottom of the page, 
the link labeled Back to top returns the user to the anchor at the top of 
the page <a id=”top”>. Here’s how the code looks:
<p><a id=”top”><h1>Our Company Logo</h1><a 
href=”#menu”>Menu:</a></p>Page content would 
go here, but remember, don’t make your mobile 
pages too long.
<a id=”menu”>
    <ul>
      <li><a href=”/mainpage.html”>Menu Link 1</a></li>
      <li><a href=”/secondpage.html “>Menu Link 2</a></li>
      <li><a href=”/thirdpage.html”>Menu Link 3</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p><a href=”#top”>Back to top</a></p>

104
Part II: Following Mobile Web Standards 
Add access keys to links
Access keys make it possible to activate a link by pressing a key on a keyboard 
instead of clicking the link with a mouse and are generally used in desktop 
Web design to make a site more accessible for people with disabilities.
In XHTML MP, you can add access keys matched to the numbers on a phone 
pad or keyboard. Numbered shortcuts can be associated with links, so 
instead of clicking an image or a block of text, users can simply press a num-
bered key (1–9) to activate a link.
Following is an example of an accesskey attribute added to link code. The 
basic link tag is <a href>. By adding the accesskey=”1” attribute, users 
can click the text of the link or enter the number 1 to trigger the link:
<a accesskey=”1” href=”chapter1.xhtml”>Chapter 1</a><br />
<a accesskey=”2” href=”chapter2.xhtml”>Chapter 2</a><br />
<a accesskey=”3” href=”chapter3.xhtml”>Chapter 3</a><br />
Close all tags
Closing all tags is a rule that applies to all XHTML, but it’s especially impor-
tant that you follow the rules when you create mobile Web sites because 
mobile Web browsers are even less forgiving of code errors. If you start a 
paragraph with a <p> tag, for example, make sure you end it with a close 
</p> tag. If you use one of the few tags that doesn’t include a close tag, such 
as the image tag, include a space and a forward slash at the end of the tag, 
like this:
<img src=”/images/logo.jpg” />
Lowercase all tags and attributes
As with XHTML, all code should be lowercase in XHTML MP. Similarly, all 
attributes must be enclosed in quote marks. Here’s an example of correct 
XHTML MP code to create a link (note that it’s okay to use capital letters in 
the URL in the text that serves as the link and is displayed in the page):
<a href=”http://www.digitalfamily.com”>http://www.DigitalFamily.com</a>
Tags must be nested properly
Nesting refers to the order of tags, and getting this order wrong can cause 
problems in Web browsers.
The following nesting is correct:
<p><strong>A bold paragraph</strong></p>

105
 Chapter 5: Comparing Mobile Markup Languages
Do not use this type of nesting:
<strong><p>A bold paragraph</strong></p>
Use heading tags, but don’t expect six levels of formatting
The heading tags, which include the <h1> through <h6> tags, are the best 
choice for formatting headlines on any Web page. Stick with the <h1> tag for 
the most important headline, <h2> for the next most important, and so on. 
However, not all mobile devices support enough different text sizes to distin-
guish all six levels of heading tags. For best results, stick with heading tags 
1–3; heading tags 3 through 6 are likely to display in the same size on most 
mobile devices.
Style text with CSS, not attributes
Attributes such as font face and font size aren’t recommended in XHTML 
and are not supported by mobile devices. You can use the <small> and 
<big> tags in XHTML MP, but our best recommendation is to use CSS for 
formatting because you can create cleaner code that better follows modern 
Web standards.
Format lists with the ordered and unordered list tags
It’s good practice to use list tags for lists of links and other items because the 
list tags, like the heading tags, are well recognized HTML tags and add addi-
tional meaning to your page code. XHTML MP supports both the unordered 
<ul> list tag, which creates a bulleted list, and the ordered <ol> list tag, 
which creates a numbered list. In XHTML, you must include a close tag for 
the list item (<li>) tag, even though doing so was not necessary in earlier 
versions of HTML.
The only attribute of the list tags that is supported is start, which can be 
used to specify the number to use to begin an ordered list. For example, 
<ol start=”5”> starts an ordered list with the number 5. To change the 
style of the bullets in an unordered list, you need to use CSS.
Avoid tables or only use small, simple tables
Many feature phones don’t support the <table> tag, so if you’re design-
ing for the low-end market, you may want to avoid them. That said, XHTML 
MP does include the <table> tag, and tables will work on many mobile 
devices. Where supported, you can include the <tr> (table row), <th> (table 
header), <td> (table data), and <caption> tags within open and close 
<table> tags. The colspan and rowspan attributes can be used with the 
<th> and <td> tags, but none of the other table attributes, such as cell pad-
ding, are supported.

106
Part II: Following Mobile Web Standards 
If you want to add padding, spacing, or a border, use CSS because table attri-
butes aren’t supported. Also keep in mind that setting a table width can be 
problematic, especially if it exceeds the available space on a small mobile 
screen. Many mobile devices aren’t wide enough to display a table and its 
contents, especially if it has more than two or three columns.
Don’t use tables to create page designs. Tables should be used only for tabu-
lar data (such as the contents of a spreadsheet); you shouldn’t cram too 
much content into table cells. On some devices, table cells that don’t fit in 
the display area are reformatted to display vertically in a narrow cell, instead 
of horizontally, making the text hard to
r
e
a
d.
Separate content with the div and paragraph tags
As on a desktop site, the best way to separate content on a mobile site is to 
use block-level tags, such as the <div> (divider) tag or the <p> (paragraph) 
tag, especially if you want to use CSS to format that content. You can also use 
the <span> tag to assign a style to text that appears in line with, or within, a 
paragraph or other block element.
Use HTML entities for special characters
You can add a copyright symbol to your mobile Web pages, but make sure 
you use the HTML entity &copy; and not the © symbol. Similarly, you need 
HTML entities for accents and other foreign language characters.
In Dreamweaver, you can insert HTML entities by choosing Insert➪HTML➪
Special Characters, and then selecting the character you want to add to your 
page. (Select Other to find a more extensive list of options.)
You can find a comprehensive list of entities on the Digital Family Web site at 
www.digitalfamily.com/dreamweaver/special-characters.html.
Insert images with the image tag and add Alt text
The image tag is supported by nearly all mobile devices, and most devices 
display PNG, GIF, and JPEG images. Some mobile devices even support ani-
mated GIFs. Make sure to include the Alt attribute so that your alternative 
text is shown if the image is not displayed. Also include the height and width 
of each image so browsers can load the page more efficiently.
<img src=”logo.gif” alt=”Company Logo” height=”55” 
width=”120” />

107
 Chapter 5: Comparing Mobile Markup Languages
Add multimedia with the object or param tags
You can link to multimedia files, including audio and video files, just as 
you link to any other files using the hyperlink tag <a href>. You can also 
insert multimedia directly into a mobile Web page using the <object> and 
<param> tags, which are supported in XHTML MP. The biggest challenge 
with multimedia is that support for audio and video formats varies dramati-
cally among devices. See Chapter 8 for instructions on adding multimedia to 
a mobile Web page.
Use the script tag only for high-end mobile browsers
Although you can use the <script> tag to add JavaScript to pages created 
with XHTML MP, only the most advanced smartphones support scripts, even 
for relatively simple actions, such as rollovers and image swaps. If you use 
scripts, make sure the page design is readable if the script doesn’t work on a 
low-end phone.
Create forms for user input
The basics of creating HTML forms are the same for mobile pages as for 
pages designed for the desktop Web. You can use forms to collect data from 
visitors to your site and create a variety of interactive features. For example, 
the American Airlines site includes pages where users can check to see what 
gate their flight is departing from. Figure 5-2 shows a page on a BlackBerry 
Storm, and Figure 5-3 shows the same page on an iPhone. Note that form 
fields where users input data are displayed quite differently from one device 
to another based on the type of phone.

XHTML MP supports the <form> tag as well as the following form field tags: 
text field, password field, check box, radio button, selection list, hidden field, 
and submit button.
 
When designing a form, you must specify a method (get or put) in the 
<form> tag, as well as an action, and you must be able to execute a script on 
your Web server to complete the action. Check with your Web hosting service 
or system administrator to find out more about how to set up scripts on your 
Web server.
Use the right doctype
Any well-crafted Web page (for the mobile Web or the desktop) should begin 
with a doctype that identifies the kind of markup used in the page. If you 

109
 Chapter 5: Comparing Mobile Markup Languages
design your mobile pages with XHTML MP, make sure you use the corre-
sponding doctype. (You find more on this topic in the “Using Mobile-Specific 
Doctypes” section, later in this chapter.)
Use the head, body, and title tags
The <head> and <body> tags work the same in XHTML MP as in other ver-
sions of HTML, although you shouldn’t use attributes of the <body> tag, such 
as background color. (If you want to specify background and text colors, use 
CSS.) It is good practice to include a short, descriptive title in the <title> 
tag of each page, even though many mobile devices don’t display the con-
tents of the <title> tag. Some mobile phones include the page title at the 
top of the browser window, and most will use it if the page is bookmarked.
Avoiding tags not included in XHTML MP
If you have a background in XHTML, you may find it helpful to know about 
the tags that you can’t use when designing with XHTML MP. Following are 
some of the common tags that you should cut out of your markup language 
skills when you design with XHTML MP:
 
✓ <applet>: Although many mobile devices can run Java applications, 
they don’t support Java applets in the Web browser.
 
✓ <basefont>: Mobile devices have limited font options, so you should 
use CSS to specify fonts for devices that support CSS.
 
✓ <button>: The generic button tag for forms is not supported, but you 
can use the submit button option.
 
✓ <frame> and <iframe>: Frames, which are used to divide the browser 
window into multiple pages, are no longer recommended for the desktop 
Web, and they’re a definite no-no for the mobile Web. The same is true 
for iframes. Mobile screens are small enough; don’t try to stuff more 
than one Web page into them at once.
 
✓ <center>: We know it’s hard to break the habit of using the center tag and 
center attribute, as in <p align=”center”>Some people love to 
center text</p>. Instead, use CSS to center text and other elements.
 
✓ <dir>, <menu>: Although XHTML MP supports the ordered list <ol> 
and unordered list <ul> tags, the Directory and Menu List tags are not 
included in the XHTML MP specification.
 
✓ <map>, <area>: Image maps are not supported.
 
✓ <u>: The underline tag is not supported and should be removed from 
all the other variations of markup languages, too (in our opinion). 
Underlining should be reserved for links; there are better ways than 
underlining to make text stand out on a Web page, mobile or otherwise.

110
Part II: Following Mobile Web Standards 
Test your XHTML MP skills
Following is an example of some badly written code in a seemingly simple XHTML MP page. Can 
you find the mistakes?
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-//WAPFORUM//DTD XHTML Mobile 1.0//EN”
“http://www.openmobilealliance.org/tech/DTD/xhtml-mobile12.

<li> <a href=” http://www.digitalfamily.com/games/goldengate-
puzzle.html”>Play the puzzle games at Digital Family</a>
</ul>
</body>
</html>
Did you find all the mistakes in this XHTML MP document? Check your answers with the following:
 ✓ The close heading tag </h1> should not be uppercase.
 ✓ There is no close </p> tag to complete the open <p> tag.
 ✓ The break tag should include a close tag within the break tag, like this: <br />.
 ✓ The <em> and <strong> tags are not nested properly.
 ✓ There is no close </caption> tag.
 ✓ The <ul> tag, like all tags, should not be capitalized.
 ✓ The <li> tags must include close </li> tags in XHTML.
 ✓ In the link to the Chocolate Game Rules site, the end of the URL is missing its quotation mark. 
See the link just after that link, with the text “Play the puzzle games at Digital Family” for the 
correct use of quotations.
Note: The doctype and other info at the top of the document are correct.

111
 Chapter 5: Comparing Mobile Markup Languages
Styling with Cascading Style Sheets
Further complicating the many ways to design mobile Web sites is the fact 
that multiple versions of CSS are available. Because most mobile devices 
that support XHTML MP also support at least some CSS, the two work well 
together on the mobile platform, just as they do for desktop Web sites. 
However, many mobile phones provide only limited support for CSS, and you 
will find that the display of CSS varies among mobile Web browsers.
As we write this, most desktop sites are designed with CSS 2, and most 
mobile devices that support XHTML MP support most of the CSS 2 specifica-
tion. For older mobile devices, you may want to limit your designs to the CSS 
options in more mobile-specific flavors of CSS, including CSS MP and Wireless 
CSS, which are both subsets of CSS 2.
Working within the limitations 
of CSS on mobile devices
Both CSS MP and Wireless CSS follow the basic rules of CSS2, but with their 
own variations. The Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) developed the Wireless CSS 
standard, and the W3C is responsible for CSS MP. Fortunately, the two groups 
say that they are now working together to merge the two specifications into 
one, which will probably be named CSS-MP. Keep any eye on the W3C site at 
www.w3.org/TR/css-mobile/ (shown in Figure 5-4), as well as the OMA 
site at www.openmobilealliance.org for more details.
When using CSS on the mobile Web, you have to work within a more limited 
set of rules than you have available on the desktop Web and follow more 
strict standards. For example, although you can define sizes in CSS without 
identifying the measurement and the style will still render properly in most 
desktop browsers, mobile devices often choke on this omission.
For example: margin-top: 10 renders fine in most desktop browsers, 
but you need to include a measurement, such as pixels (here’s an example, 
margin-top: 10px), for mobile browsers.
Similarly, use of the float option in CSS to align images and other elements 
doesn’t always work. Sometimes the tag isn’t supported by the browser; 
other times the mobile screen doesn’t have enough room to display an image 
aligned to the left or right with text wrapped around it.

As mobile browsers begin to support HTML5 (covered in the section “Using 
HTML5 with Mobile Browsers,” later in this chapter), they will probably also 
support at least some of the CSS 3 specification. However, using these tech-
nologies today is still premature.
Using internal, external, 
or inline style sheets
As with most things in mobile Web design, the question of whether it’s best 
to use internal or external style sheets (introduced in Chapter 4) depends on 
the capabilities of the device that displays your pages.
On the desktop Web, most designers prefer external style sheets because 
using the same external style sheet linked across multiple pages of a Web site 
is more efficient. The same is true in most mobile Web designs but with some 
limitations. Depending on how the mobile browser supports CSS and how the 
device manages caching, using an external style sheet may require that the 
device connects to the server to download the styles with each new page. 
If that’s the case, styled pages would download more quickly if you use an 
internal style sheet rather than an external one.

113
 Chapter 5: Comparing Mobile Markup Languages
Inline styles should be used sparingly, if it all. Like the desktop Web, internal 
and external style sheets are more efficient because they keep content sepa-
rated from style, whereas inline styles can complicate code because they 
must be included with each tag you style.
Identifying levels of support for CSS
No definitive guide lists which devices support which CSS rules. However, to 
find out more about designing with CSS for specific types of devices, do the 
following:
 
✓ Visit the CSS Mobile Profile page on the W3C Web site at www.w3.org/
TR/css-mobile.
  
✓ Review the documentation provided by mobile device manufacturers.
 
✓ Visit the DeviceAtlas Web site (www.deviceatlas.com), which offers a 
comprehensive collection of reports on mobile devices. Although these 
reports often include little or no data specific to CSS (at least at the time 
of this writing), the mobile phone profiles on DeviceAtlas do include the 
type of HTML supported and it’s generally safe to assume that devices 
that support XHTML MP also support CSS2.
The best way to make sure that your CSS works well for your intended audi-
ence is to test your page designs across the devices you think will most likely 
be used by your visitors. You can find resources and tips for testing your 
mobile page designs in Chapter 7.
Using HTML5 with Mobile Browsers
HTML5 is the next major revision of HTML and is a big deal, especially for 
mobile browsers. If all draft features are present in the final version, HTML5 
will standardize document structure, offline browsing, canvas animation, and 
location-based services in supporting mobile browsers.
HTML4, the previous version of the Web’s markup language, was finalized in 
1999 but never formally accepted as a W3C standard. (It remains in limbo as 
a recommendation. Go figure.) Eleven years later, HTML5 proposes an over-
haul of Web document structure, interactivity, and offline behavior.
The HTML5 standards effort kicked off in 2007 and is not expected to con-
clude until at least 2011. W3C and technology industry working groups are 
working together to develop and refine the standard. They have worked for 
more than three years (as of this writing) to craft a major restructuring of the 
foundational markup language of the Web.

114
Part II: Following Mobile Web Standards 
Killer features for mobile Web design
HTML5 is great news for the mobile ecosystem. Mobile users get richer Web 
applications and improved usability. Mobile browsers reclaim the rendering 
of rich Web content from third-party plug-ins. Mobile developers get testable, 
cross-platform and standards-based interfaces for content development.
The new features of HTML5 standardize technologies that are common in 
smartphone-optimized mobile Web applications. In today’s mobile Web 
XHTML MP or HTML4 documents, these killer features are implemented 
using proprietary device and browser APIs. With HTML5, advanced Web 
application features are available in all mobile browsers supporting the 
markup language, using the same standard syntax and displaying the same 
standard behavior.
The following are the most important HTML5 features for mobile browsers:
 
✓ Location awareness: The geolocation API makes the mobile device’s 
geographic location available to a Web application. In the past, obtain-
ing device location was possible only by using proprietary extensions to 
JavaScript or server-side integration with a mobile operator API.
 
✓ 2D animation API: The new <canvas> element and the JavaScript 
API allow two-dimensional drawing, graphics, and animations. Cross-
platform games are now possible in mobile browsers. (Beware: Script 
execution effects battery life on mobile devices.)
 
✓ Persistent storage: The Web Storage API allows documents to persis-
tently store data in a mobile browser. Mobile browsers can write data in 
one browsing session and read it in the next session.
 
✓ Offline application caching: Network connectivity may be intermittent 
for mobile devices as they roam in and out of coverage areas. In HTML5, 
the user can interact with a cached mobile Web application while out of 
coverage. Web documents list all external resources (such as CSS files 
and JavaScript libraries) required for the document to be completely 
displayed and usable. Mobile browsers that support HTML5 can use this 
list to cache an entire Web application for offline use.
 
✓ Structural elements: New <header>, <footer>, <nav>, <section>, 
<article>, <figure>, and <aside> elements were added to HTML5 
to make it easier to design Web pages with a logical structure. Structural 
elements make it easier for mobile browsers to navigate document com-
ponents and display partial documents.
 
✓ Native media support: New <video> and <audio> elements embed 
multimedia into a Web document without using third-party browser 
plug-ins. Mobile browsers may natively control multimedia display, user 
interfaces, and codecs, which encode or decode data for playback.

115
 Chapter 5: Comparing Mobile Markup Languages
HTML5 supplants XHTML
HTML5 supplants the XHTML specification. In HTML5, XHTML is redefined as 
a set of syntax rules and is no longer an independent markup specification. 
HTML5 can be expressed using either the strict syntax rules of XML or the 
looser syntax of HTML, which tolerates unclosed tags. This sensible change 
restores the unity of markup language functionality while allowing the mobile 
developer or designer the flexibility of choosing precise or lenient syntax. 
(Slackers, you can continue to slack off in HTML5.)
Motherhood, apple pie, and HTML5
Mobile pundits tout HTML5 as the antidote to practically every problem in 
mobile Web development. HTML5 is indeed a great leap forward in stan-
dardizing the advanced features of Web browsers. Its new elements and 
APIs unlock consistent implementations of rich Web application behavior. 
However, HTML5 will not lessen or extinguish several sins of mobile Web 
development, including the following:
 
✓ Fragmentation: Too many vendors implement mobile browsers, creating 
a fragmented marketplace and forcing developers to adapt Web content 
to play to browser strengths and avoid browser weaknesses.
 
✓ Bugs: As with any Web standard, HTML5 features may be incompletely 
or incorrectly implemented in some mobile browsers.
 
✓ The rush to market: Mobile browsers may support HTML5 too quickly, 
implementing features or syntax that end up changed in or cut from the 
final standard.
 
✓ Lack of support for the mass market: Many popular mobile Web sites 
use simple markup to quickly provide snackable chunks of relevant 
information to users. Upgrading these mobile Web sites to use HTML5, 
without implementing content adaptation to provide different versions 
of your site to different devices (covered in Chapter 6), could cut off 
access to millions of users with older, Web-accessible mobile browsers.
HTML5 on smartphones and dumbphones
The promise of HTML5 is realized only on mobile devices with modern, 
updatable Web browsers. As of this writing, iPhone, Droid, and Palm Pre 
smartphones implement portions of the HTML5 specification, as well as the 
latest version of CSS, CSS3. Smartphones provide an excellent platform for 
rolling out HTML5 applications to savvy mobile Web users. However, a large 
percentage of mobile subscribers still use non-smartphone devices, which 
have no capability for updating the browser or operating system.

✓ www.whatwg.org: The site for Web Hypertext Application Technology 
Working Group (WHATWG), founded by people working for major desk-
top Web browser vendors
 
✓ www.w3.org/TR/html5: The latest version of W3C’s HTML5 Draft
Using Mobile-Specific Doctypes
The doctype, or Document Type Definition (DTD), is a declaration that should 
appear at the very top of any Web page, even before the open <html> tag. 
Essentially, the doctype tells the Web browser which markup language was 
used to write the page so that the browser knows how to render the page.
Web browsers struggle to provide support for all the different ways Web 
pages are written. If you leave off the doctype or use a doctype that doesn’t 
match the code in your Web page, many browsers will resort to Quirksmode 
and take a best-guess approach to rendering your page. As you might imag-
ine, the results are not very pretty sometimes. Don’t let this happen to your 
pages, especially after you spend so much time making sure that your mobile 
pages were designed with the right markup language.
Following are some of the most common doctypes and what they tell a Web 
browser:
 
✓ By default, Dreamweaver adds the XHTML 1.0 Transitional doctype to 
its pages. Although you can change this setting in the preferences in 
Dreamweaver, by default, all pages are created using the XHMTL 1.0 
transitional markup language. This doctype is a common choice for Web 
pages designed for the desktop Web. The following complies with the 
W3C recommendation:
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 
Transitional//EN” “http://www.w3.org/TR/
xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd”>
 
✓ Three versions of XHTML MP are available: versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2. 
Most designers use version 1.1 or 1.2. The doctype for 1.1 is

117
 Chapter 5: Comparing Mobile Markup Languages
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-//WAPFORUM//DTD XHTML Mobile 
1.1//EN” “http://www.openmobilealliance.org/
tech/
DTD/xhtml-mobile11.dtd”>
 
✓ And the doctype for version 1.2 is
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-//WAPFORUM//DTD XHTML Mobile 
1.2//EN”
“http://www.openmobilealliance.org/tech/DTD/xhtml-
mobile12.dtd”>
 
✓ For pages designed with WML version 1.3, use the following:
<!DOCTYPE wml PUBLIC “-//WAPFORUM//DTD WML 1.3//
EN””http://www.wapforum.org/DTD/wml13.dtd”>

n the spacious kitchen of Spago Beverly Hills — the flagship restaurant of 
Chef Wolfgang Puck — each gourmet dish is carefully prepared to satisfy 
the supermodels and billionaires that dine there. The chefs are happy to 
accommodate their every wish.
In contrast, just a few miles away at the crowded take-out counter at the 
Wolfgang Puck Café at the Los Angeles County Airport, what you see in the 
little plastic lunch packages is what you get. The staff at this busy airport 
café work quickly and efficiently, but the goal is to help travelers get their 
food in a hurry — no one here has the time or resources to handle special 
requests.
As you consider the range of options for designing a mobile Web site for all the 
different mobile devices that may visit your pages, it may be helpful to use this 
culinary example for comparison. At the high end of the mobile Web design 
spectrum, companies such as Microsoft have implemented mobile design strat-
egies akin to the fine dining experience at Spago. Developers put tremendous 
resources into creating a complex system that delivers different versions of 
the Microsoft Cloud Computing site (shown in Figure 6-1), optimized for each 
device that visits the site. At the low end of the list of mobile design options, 
other companies create just one alternate version of their desktop Web site, 
stripped down and streamlined to meet the basic needs of mobile devices, 
much like the prepackaged meals sold at the Wolfgang Puck Café.
In this chapter, we review what it takes to deliver different versions of your 
Web site to different mobile devices. In the first section, we describe a few 
key concepts and discuss how to develop such a system. In the second part

of the chapter, we explore in detail how to plan and design a site that meets 
the needs of many different devices. To illustrate these concepts, we use the 
Microsoft Cloud Web site and include comments, interviews with designers, 
and screenshots of planning documents and designs. Figure 6-1 gives you an 
idea of what went into this complex mobile site.

Detecting and Directing Mobile Devices
Restaurants must get the right meal to the right table while the food is still hot, 
or they won’t be in business long. To meet these goals, well-informed waitstaff 
must write the order correctly, and staff in a well-organized kitchen must pre-
pare variations of the same meal quickly, without compromising quality.
Similarly, if you want to deliver tailored versions of your mobile Web site, 
you must properly detect what kind of device each visitor is using (device 
detection, which is like getting the order right), and then deliver the best ver-
sion of your site for each device (content adaptation, which is like preparing 
each meal to order).
Before we delve into the details of device detection, let’s begin with an 
overview. If you want to deliver different versions of a Web site to different 
devices, follow these general steps:

121
 Chapter 6: Delivering Different Designs to Different Devices
 
1. Develop device profiles or parameters.
 
 You first have to determine which devices you want to design your site 
to work well on. Since there are thousands of mobile phones and other 
devices available, it’s generally best to categorize devices into a set of 
profiles or develop a set of parameters (such as image sizes) that you 
can mix and match, based on things like the screen size and multimedia 
support of each device.
 
2. Develop (or acquire) a device database or a configuration file.
 
 To deliver the right version of your site to the right device, you need a 
configuration file or database that contains detailed information about 
every device. Many private companies create their own device data-
bases, but you can also use the open-source WURFL (Wireless Universal 
Resource File), described in the “Using open-source device detection 
scripts and services” section, later in this chapter.
 
3. Write (or acquire) a program that can deliver the right version of your 
site to the right device.
 
 The challenge here is to develop an application that can match the 
contents of the device database with the different design options (the 
device profiles, special URLs, or other parameters) that you’ve cre-
ated for your site. Top mobile design firms create their own solutions, 
but you find information about open-source solutions, including Andy 
Moore’s device detection solution (shown in Figure 6-2) in the “Using 
open-source device detection scripts and services” section.

Part II: Following Mobile Web Standards 
 
4. Develop a design that can be adapted to the needs of different devices 
on the fly, or create multiple designs, each optimized for a different 
device or device profile.
 
 Each approach has tradeoffs, which we explore in the “Designing for 
Different Devices” section, later in this chapter. With either approach, 
expect to spend a significant amount of time creating a design (or 
designs) that will display well within the constraints of each device.
 
5. Test, test, and test again, making adjustments as needed.
 
 The many variations among devices and the sheer number of devices in 
use on the mobile Web make it almost impossible to deliver a perfectly 
optimized page to every device every time. Even if you do get your 
mobile design strategy right, the mobile Web is a moving target. Develop 
a strategy that best meets the needs of your site users today (and the 
limitations of your time and budget), and make refinements to keep your 
strategy up to date in the future.
Developing a device detection system
The basic concept of device detection is straightforward: A system identifies 
the visitor’s device when it arrives at your site, and then directs the visitor to 
the best version of your Web site based on what the system knows about the 
device. (For a more technical explanation, see the upcoming sidebar “User 
agents and device detection.”)
The challenge with device detection — and the subsequent redirection of 
visitors — is that approximately 8,000 devices are in use, with more being 
added all the time. Although the various categories of mobile phones have 
similarities, the specifics of what each device supports vary.
For example, you may think that all smartphones are similar, and that within 
that category, all BlackBerry phones are pretty much the same. However, 
BlackBerry phones vary dramatically. Many BlackBerry phones have screens 
that are 480 pixels wide, but some are limited to 160 pixels. The latest 
BlackBerry phones support JavaScript, XHTML MP, and CSS2 (covered in 
Chapter 5), but older models provide minimal or no support for CSS. In 
addition, you have the human factor: BlackBerry phones offer users many 
options, including the ability to turn JavaScript support on and off.
How you deliver the right version of your site to the right phone is the 
secret sauce of many high-end mobile Web design firms. Companies such as 
Ansible, which developed the Microsoft Cloud Computing site featured as a 
case study later in this chapter, have spent years developing a finely tuned 
device database and device detection applications.

123
 Chapter 6: Delivering Different Designs to Different Devices
Essentially, you build up libraries of “ways of dealing with different stuff,” 
explained Lee Andron, Director of Information Design and Strategy for 
Ansible. With every new mobile site that they develop, the company adds 
more processes to its object-oriented library. Thus, Ansible is constantly get-
ting better at delivering video, audio, scripts, and other Web content to all 
the devices that visit their mobile sites.
You might not be able to compete with companies such as Ansible, but you 
can set up a similar system with far fewer resources. Like most things on the 
Web, open-source options are available, thanks to the generosity of program-
mers who share their work and offer applications for free (or for a donation). 
We cover a few of these options in the section that follows.
Using open-source device detection 
scripts and services
Although you can create your own configuration file or device database 
with the specifications of every mobile device you want to support and can 
write your own device detection scripts (if you’re an experienced program-
mer), you’re almost certainly better off starting with one of the open-source 
User agents and device detection
When you open a Web page, your Web 
browser sends a user-agent string to the 
server that hosts the Web site. The user-agent 
string essentially introduces you to the server, 
describing what browser (and browser ver-
sion) you’re using, as well as other things 
about your computer or mobile device, such as 
the operating system. If you want to see how 
your browser introduces you, go to http://
whatsmyuseragent.com/.
Device detection systems are designed to 
recognize user-agent strings and direct visi-
tors based on the capabilities of each device. 
Because many Web sites use device detection 
to direct mobile visitors, you can’t just open 
the mobile versions of some sites in a desk-
top browser on your computer. That’s where 
the User Agent Switcher comes in handy. This 
plug-in for Firefox (available at https://
addons.mozilla.org/en-US/
firefox/addon/59/) enables you to 
change the user agent of your Web browser, 
effectively tricking the server into thinking 
you’re using an iPhone or any of the other user 
agents you can load into the plug-in.
Because the User Agent Switcher makes it 
possible to visit the mobile version of a Web 
site with a browser on a desktop computer, it 
also makes it possible to view the source code 
behind those pages. This is especially valu-
able because browsers on mobile devices do 
not offer an option to view the source code, 
which is standard in desktop browsers such as 
Firefox, Safari, Chrome, and Internet Explorer.

options included in this section. However, even with these great resources, 
you’ll need some programming experience to get these solutions to work on 
your server.
WURFL
http://wurfl.sourceforge.net/
Used by a growing list of mobile Web developers, WURFL (Wireless Universal 
Resource File) is a freely available configuration file created by many con-
tributors with the goal of providing a comprehensive list of all mobile devices 
in use today and what they can support in terms of Web design standards. 
Although no one claims that the list is flawless, it is regularly updated and 
well respected in the mobile development community.
Tera-WURFL
www.tera-wurfl.com
Built on WURFL (and linked to from the WURFL site), Tera-WURFL is an 
application created with PHP and MySQL. The Tera-WURFL application 
detects and matches mobile devices by first collecting user agent information 
from each site visitor and then passing that information to the Tera-WURFL 
library where it is evaluated and assigned to a UserAgentMatcher. Each 
UserAgentMatcher is designed to work with a device profile, made up of a 
group of devices with similar capabilities. Essentially, the Tera-WURFL gets 
you most of the way through the device detection and redirection process, 
but you still need to have a script that redirects visitors to the right version 
of your site based on the results.
Device Atlas
http://deviceatlas.com
If you want to create your own device database, or configuration file, a great 
place to start is Device Atlas. On the Device Atlas Web site you can look up 
the specific features supported by nearly any mobile phone, including what 
markup language, multimedia, and image formats each phone supports. 
Device Atlas also offers an API that you can use if you’re developing your own 
device detection solution.
Andy Moore’s solution detects and redirects visitors
http://detectmobilebrowsers.mobi
Andy Moore’s solution is the simplest we’ve found for setting up an auto 
detection and redirection solution for your site. Note, however, that you still 
need at least basic PHP skills to set up and install the code.

125
 Chapter 6: Delivering Different Designs to Different Devices
Andy Moore’s solution is a PHP function, which has eight parameters that 
you can easily define to handle common devices. As you see in Figure 6-3, 
you can use the drop-down menu options on his Web page to alter the set-
tings for each option.

Designing for Different Devices
You can design for different mobile devices using essentially two approaches. 
First, you can create two or more versions of your site and set each one up at 
a different URL. You can think of this as a small, medium, or large approach 
to mobile Web design.
The second option, content adaptation, could be likened to providing a 
custom suit for each frame or at least enough mix-and-match options to 
ensure a better fit than the first option.
You can also combine these two approaches, creating multiple page designs, 
matching them to a general device profile, and then tailoring each design a 
little further, based on screen size and other factors. However, few mobile 
designers we’ve spoken with go to this length to produce a usable mobile 
experience.
We prefer the content adaptation approach, although it is the more compli-
cated option. Following is an overview of both design strategies and how 
mobile Web designers use them.

126
Part II: Following Mobile Web Standards 
Designing for content adaptation
In the content adaptation approach, you create one Web site design and then 
adapt it to each device. Thus, the basic site structure is the same across 
all devices, but specific elements, such as image size or the appearance of 
videos, change based on what the device can support. For example, you can 
optimize your images in several sizes and then deliver the version of the 
image that best fits the screen size of each device.
This approach is possible only if you’re working on a dynamic Web site, 
meaning the content of the site is stored in a database and the pages are 
created on the fly (as they are requested by a browser). Dynamic sites are 
generally built with technologies such as PHP, ASP.NET, or Java combined 
with a database like MySQL. An example of a dynamic Web site is Amazon, 
which creates a page that recommends books for you that are different from 
the ones it recommends for others, based on your previous visits to the site 
and books that you have purchased. A sophisticated dynamic site such as 
Amazon works by retrieving the images and descriptions of the books from a 
database and assembles them on a Web page as you access the site.
Many developers who follow the content adaptation approach also use cach-
ing. That means they can save, or cache, a version of the site optimized for 
a particular kind of phone. For example, if 40 percent of your traffic comes 
from iPhones, and all iPhones have the same specifications, you can save a 
lot of server power by creating the iPhone version once and then caching it 
so that you can serve that cached version rather than generate a new version 
for every iPhone that comes along.
The content adaptation approach is complicated and only suited to dynamic 
Web sites. If you’re working on a static Web site, where each page of the site 
is a separate HTML file, your best option is to create a few different page 
designs and set each one up at its own URL, which is the approach covered 
in the next section.
Creating mobile versions of a blog
Web blogs created with WordPress (or other 
blogging software) are a kind of dynamic Web 
site. All headlines, posts, and images are stored 
in a MySQL database, and pages are generated 
on the fly. Thus, creating a mobile-optimized ver-
sion of a blog is relatively easy, and there is an 
ever-expanding list of blog themes available on 
the WordPress Web site to help you automate 
the process. Some mobile-optimized WordPress 
themes even take care of device detection, 
including the one featured in Chapter 9.

127
 Chapter 6: Delivering Different Designs to Different Devices
Creating different versions of a site
Creating different versions of a Web site is easier to implement than the con-
tent adaptation approach, but you won’t be able to match your designs to the 
unique specifications of every device as effectively. Still, creating different 
site versions is far superior to creating just one mobile version of your site 
(an approach covered in Chapter 3).
Because it’s impractical (if not impossible) to create a different design for 
each of the thousands of devices that might visit your site, most developers 
start by creating two or more device profiles — categories of phones with 
similar features.
Here’s an example of the two main profile categories you should consider, 
followed by a more detailed breakdown for low-end phones:
 
✓ Profile 1: A device profile for high-end touch-screen phones would 
include the iPhone, phones that run the Android operating system, 
those with the latest Palm OS, and the newest phones with the Microsoft 
Internet Explorer Web browser. With these as your target, you can 
design a version of your site optimized for a 320-pixel-wide screen, that 
includes JavaScript, video, and the latest markup language HTML5, as 
well as CSS3 (covered in Chapter 5). Because these high-end phones 
all use Web browsers that support this technology, you can do a lot 
with them.
 
✓ Profile 2: A device profile for low-end phones would include older 
BlackBerry and other smartphones, as well as all feature phones. In this 
profile, you would leave out JavaScript, which is not supported consis-
tently (or at all) across these phones, limit or remove any video or audio 
files, and create the page markup with XHTML MP and CSS MP (covered 
in Chapter 5).
You can create as many profiles as you want and can base the profiles on any 
number of factors, but these two broad categories will cover most phones 
today. If you want to better serve the low-end phones, you could then create 
a second level of device profiles based on screen size.
If you create device profiles based on screen size, and you make them a 
subset of the first pair of profiles, you might define them as follows:
 
✓ Profile 2A: Tiny screens, those limited to 132 pixels or less
 
✓ Profile 2B: Small screens, between 132 and 240 pixels
 
✓ Profile 2C: Medium screens, those between 240 and 320 pixels

128
Part II: Following Mobile Web Standards 
As you create each mobile version of your Web site, consider how to take 
best advantage of the capabilities of the phones in each profile. For example, 
you may want to include video in the version you design for the Profile 1 
phones, but not in the Profile 2 version you create for feature phones, which 
don’t support video as well.
After you’ve built the different versions, you can publish each one at a spe-
cial URL. For example, you could publish the site designed for Profile 1 at 
smartphones.yourdomainname.com and then publish the Profile 2 version 
at http:m.yourdomainname.com because it’s more difficult to type on a 
feature phone. Also note that although you can use a domain name such as 
yourdomainname.com/mobile, instead, for a feature phone, it’s best to use 
the m.domain example because it’s difficult to add a forward slash on most 
feature phones. If you then go on to the second level of profiles, you could 
create three variations on that domain, one for each screen size.
With separate domains set up for each profile, you can then direct visitors 
to the best version using a simple detection script, like the one available 
on Andy Moore’s Web site, covered previously (in the “Using open-source 
device detection scripts and services” section).
Planning a Mobile Web Project
Whether you will be creating multiple versions of a site or using content adap-
tation, it’s wise to begin by thinking about what you want to include on the site 
and how to design the site so that it works on a wide range of devices.
Top-down and bottom-up design
Whether you create multiple versions of your 
site design or use content adaptation, at some 
point you have to step back and think about 
what the site should look like. The two common 
approaches to site design follow:
 ✓ Design for the high end and strip down: In 
this approach, you come up with a great 
design that takes advantage of top-of-
the-line features, and then you strip the 
design to a bare-bones version for low-
end phones, while maintaining as much of 
the same look and feel as possible. In our 
unscientific survey of mobile Web design-
ers, we found that people with a design 
background tend to favor this approach.
 ✓ Design for the low end and build up: In the 
second approach, you determine the mini-
mum of text, links, and images you want on 
your site, and then you add more design 
features, multimedia, and interactive con-
tent for devices that support it. In our many 
discussions with developers, we found that 
programmers and those who specialize in 
site architecture (covered in the last part of 
this chapter) prefer this approach.

129
 Chapter 6: Delivering Different Designs to Different Devices
To help you understand some of the best practices in planning a mobile Web 
site, this section focuses on a real-world mobile design success story from 
Ansible, Interpublic Group’s full service mobile marketing agency.
The case study is based on a project that the Ansible team developed for 
Microsoft: transforming the desktop version of the Cloud Computing site, 
shown in Figure 6-4, into a mobile version that displays well on nearly every 
mobile device that might visit the site, including the Motorola RAZR, Apple 
iPhone, and BlackBerry Bold, also shown in Figure 6-4. Lee Andron, direc-
tor of information design and strategy, and Sia Ea, senior creative manager, 
generously granted us a series of interviews. In addition, the Ansible team 
provided access to planning and design documents.
For the Cloud Computing site, Andron created the wireframe and the final 
Project Planning Document, Ea created the design, a team of programmers did 
the development work, and a project manager oversaw the entire process.

Part II: Following Mobile Web Standards 
Creating wireframes
On larger projects such as the Cloud Computing site, Creative Director 
Andron explained, it’s good practice to start by creating a wireframe, a skel-
etal model of a site not unlike a blueprint for a building. Wireframes are not 
unique to mobile design; most design firms that build big, complex Web sites 
create wireframes.
A good wireframe is like a diagram of a site that shows what happens when 
someone clicks on each page. Most developers who create wireframes agree 
that it’s important to not add design elements at the initial stages — no color, 
no fancy fonts. The wireframe is a structural document designed to help you 
focus on how a site works without being distracted by design details, such as 
the color scheme. As the development process evolves, the initial wireframe 
document may grow to include design mockups and other details.
 
In the top-right corner of each wireframe document (such as the one in 
Figure 6-5), Andron included a miniature site map that shows where the 
page fits with the rest of the site.
 
Figure 6-5: 
The initial 
wireframe 
document 
shows 
only the 
bare-bones 
structure of 
each page.
 

131
 Chapter 6: Delivering Different Designs to Different Devices
Although beginning by creating a wireframe may seem like it delays the start 
of development, most Web designers find that the project is more efficient in 
the long run because the design team can work out potential problems with 
navigation and functionality before adding the complexity of programming 
and design. And after the wireframe is approved, you can move forward with 
technology and design simultaneously because everyone is working from the 
same blueprint.
Dividing a project into manageable phases also makes it easier for clients to 
approve each stage of development; each phase can have a distinct focus, 
Andron said. Our client approves functionality, then design, and finally the 
text used on each page. Each approval is documented in the growing Project 
Design Document, which serves as a set of blueprints in the development 
process.
Resources and software for creating wireframes
You can create a wireframe document in 
almost any software program. Some designers 
use common applications, including Microsoft 
Word or PowerPoint, but there are a number of 
programs and online services designed specifi-
cally for creating wireframes. Here are a few:
Cacoo (www.cacoo.com): This online draw-
ing program includes many icons and other 
features designed for creating wireframes, 
sitemaps, and charts. (Cost: free)
Balsamiq Mockups (www.balsamiq.com): 
This online drawing and collaboration tool 
offers more sophisticated features than Cacoo. 
(Cost: $79)
iPlotz (www.iplotz.com): An online tool 
you can use to create clickable and navigable 
wireframes and prototypes. (Cost: $15/mo)
Fairbuilder (www.flairbuilder.com): 
This online tool can be used to create complete 
interactive prototypes and wireframes. (Cost: 
$24/mo)
Microsoft Visio (www.microsoft.com/
visio): A popular program among profes-
sionals who favor Microsoft products, Visio 
is only available for Windows computers. The 
program uses vector graphics and features 
a broad collection of templates and other 
sophisticated tools designed for developing 
complex projects. (Cost: $500+ for the profes-
sional version)
Omnigraffle (www.omnigroup.com): This 
program works on Macintosh computers and 
iPads and can be used to create diagrams, 
wireframes, and charts with many great design 
features built in. Omnigraffle can also import 
and export Visio documents. (Cost: $200 for the 
professional version)

132
Part II: Following Mobile Web Standards 
Stepping through the development process
At Ansible, each new project begins with a Vision Document that defines the 
concept of what the site will accomplish. It helps the firm come to an agree-
ment with the customer about the goals the site needs to achieve as well as 
the expected return on investment, or ROI. Andron is quick to admit that just 
because you can develop a different design for every mobile device, doesn’t 
mean doing so is the best investment for all of his clients. As with any design 
project, you have to balance the options with the expected return on investment.
Even before Ansible signs a contract with a client, Andron often creates an 
initial site map. The initial site map often changes quite a bit by the time they 
get to the final version of the wireframe document (shown in Figure 6-6), but 
it serves as a guide that can help make sure the client and the development 
team are on the same page in terms of the scope of the project.
After a client signs off on the initial site map document, Andron and his team 
create a statement of work, where they define a budget and timeline.
 
Figure 6-6: 
A site 
map in the 
wireframe

project’s 
scope and 
how each 
page links.
 

133
 Chapter 6: Delivering Different Designs to Different Devices
Once the client signs a contract, the team is ready to move full steam ahead. 
The entire development process goes something like this:
 
1. Create the detailed wireframe designs complete with site maps (refer to 
Figures 6-5 and 6-6) and discuss with the client to get approval.
 
2. The creative designer creates the initial page designs and presents them 
to the client for approval. For this project, the senior creative manager, 
Sia Ea, created designs for each of the main pages of the site, including 
the one shown in Figure 6-7.

134
Part II: Following Mobile Web Standards 
 
3. Add the final copy — the text that will appear in the pages of the site, 
and get the client to sign off on all content.
 
 The team at Ansible, like many designers, often uses “greeked” or 
placeholder text to show how copy will look on the initial page designs. 
However, Andron prefers to use real content from the site whenever 
possible because it can help clients more clearly visualize how the site 
will come together in the end. Screen designs are so small that text plays 
a fundamental roll in the design. He says, “If we include text in the site 
sourced from the campaign, we save time in the long run by suggesting 
what the copy of the site should say to achieve the goals of the project.”
 
4. Combine all the elements (wireframe, design mockups, and content) into 
one complete Project Design Document, like the one shown in Figure 6-8.
 
Figure 6-8: 
The middle 
of the page 
shows two 
kinds of 
naviga-
tion, one 
for touch-
screen 
phones 
and one for 
keypads on 
a feature 
phone.
 
 
 Creating a wireframe helps you work out complex navigational chal-
lenges before you get to the programming and development of a site. For 
example, the middle section of Figure 6-8 shows two kinds of navigation 
that will appear on the home page, one for devices with touch screens 
and a second for feature phones that are limited to numeric keypads. 
The need for dual navigation options makes mobile sites complex, but 
working out how to handle these differences before you start program-
ming helps the development go more smoothly.

135
 Chapter 6: Delivering Different Designs to Different Devices
 
5. Notes are added to the document throughout the process.
 
 At each stage of review with the client, Andron adds notes from the 
client to the Project Planning Document and includes those notes when 
the final document is passed on to the programmers. One of the chal-
lenges with creating a wireframe and other parts of the planning docu-
ment, he explained, is that you’re really serving two masters — one is 
the customer because the document must get their approval, and the 
other is the development team because, ultimately, the document has to 
be useful to the programmers and designers who create the site.
 
6. After the wireframes, creative designs, and copy deck are approved, the 
Project Design Document is complete and the programmers put the plan 
into action.
 
7. The final phases before the site goes live involve lots of testing.
 
 Andron said his team uses services like DeviceAnywhere to help with 
initial testing because it offers so many different devices on one site and 
the ability to test mobile services in other countries without having to 
physically go there. “The best way to test a mobile design, however, is 
to use real mobile devices,” he said. In his office, Andron keeps several 
mobile phones on hand and uses them to view pages and test interactive 
features throughout the development process. (You find more about 
DeviceAnywhere and other testing options in Chapter 7.)
 
 After the site is built on a testing server and ready for final review, 
Andron demonstrates the site for the client on at least five phones run-
ning different operating systems and browsers (depending on the cli-
ent’s target audience).
 
 “Developing mobile Web design effectively requires a constant improve-
ment process,” Andron said, noting that at every stage, they are testing 
their assumptions and making changes as necessary to ensure that the 
final project will be successful.
The entire process of developing a Project Design Document with planning 
documents, such as the ones shown in Figures 6-5 through 6-8, may require 
more than a dozen revisions as new elements are added and changes are 
requested. The Ansible team created 14 versions of the Microsoft Cloud 
Computing site Project Design Document in the process of developing a site 
to reach the project goals. The final version consisted of an 18-page docu-
ment, complete with a site map, navigation documents, real content, and 
design mockups plus the copy deck.
Andron saves a copy of the wireframe document with each significant revi-
sion so he can backtrack if things change significantly along the way, which is 
a common challenge with projects that include so many moving pieces. “We 
might have six or seven revisions before we even show the wireframe to a 
client,” he said.

Part II: Following Mobile Web Standards 
Considering the designer’s perspective
The constraints that designers face when creating sites for the mobile Web 
would leave many artists feeling as though they were being asked to build 
three different model ships in one tiny bottle, while wearing a straightjacket. 
But Sia Ea, who was the design lead on the Ansible team for the Microsoft 
Cloud Computing site project, enjoys the challenge.
“Creating a Web design that looks good and works across a wide variety of 
mobile phones and other devices isn’t easy,” she said, “but it is satisfying.” 
Ea likes to start by creating a version of the design that includes all of the 
most advanced features possible, and then stripping out the elements that 
won’t work on low-end devices as she creates different versions.
Because the development process begins with a wireframe, her options are 
limited from the start by more than just the constraints of the mobile Web. 
“The wireframe is a map for the site, and includes many assumptions that 
also affect the design,” she said. Although she had to base her design on the 
wireframe, she was able to negotiate some adjustments with Andron before 
they presented the design to the client.
Ea kept the colors already in use on the desktop version of the Cloud 
Computing site (refer to Figure 6-4), which consisted of bright colors on a 
white background. Fortunately, this color scheme makes text easy to read on 
a mobile device as well as on the desktop site. That said, Ea prefers to use 
darker backgrounds, with a light text color for navigation links because it 
helps them stand out on a small screen and makes it easier to identify where 
a user must click on a link (see the bottom of Figure 6-9 for an example).
Ea thinks anyone who has been designing for the desktop Web has a great 
background for mobile design because they already have experience design-
ing for different computer platforms and browser differences. But they may 
still have to learn to deal with the fact that the differences among mobile 
devices are much greater because there are so many different devices and 
resolutions. In addition, browsers have different capabilities; for example, 
some can’t render tables, and others don’t render CSS or JavaScript. Knowing 
these limitations is critical when creating a design that will work across 
many devices.
Now the iPad is adding new challenges and opportunities in mobile design. 
In the past, the largest design Ea would create was 320 pixels wide, for an 
iPhone. As mobile screens got larger, she started making the largest images 
480 pixels wide. Now she makes graphics that are 768 pixels wide so that 
they fill the screen on an iPad. In general, Ea creates the design with images 
in the largest size and then scales down the design for smaller devices.

gation at

Following are some of Ea’s tips for mobile Web design:
 
✓ Stick with fundamental design principles. An element’s typography, com-
position, location, and scale are all important.
 
✓ Use grids for layout, and use colors that provide contrast. Use a white 
background and dark text when you have lots of copy, and use the 
reverse for site imagery. Keep links simple and easy to navigate.
 
✓ Don’t make pages too long (no more than two or three screens). Keep 
copy short and ensure that the most important information appears 
at the top of the screen. “Having an iPhone will spoil you,” she said, 
“because scrolling down a page on many devices requires tediously 
pressing a key, so limiting page length is extremely important.”
 
✓ Keep users entertained and give them the capability of moving forward 
or backward.
Ea is quick to admit there are exceptions to any design rule. Although she 
generally recommends that you limit each page to no more than two screens 
of content, Figure 6-10 shows a page in the Cloud Computing site that is 

138
Part II: Following Mobile Web Standards 
longer. The page shown in Figure 6-10 lists all the RSS feeds to which users of 
the Cloud Computing site can subscribe. “The desire to show the extensive 
list of articles users could choose from justified creating a longer page layout 
in this case,” she said.

▶ Finding and fixing broken links and missing images
▶ Testing your work with the Dreamweaver Site Reporting feature
You don’t want your initial visitors to send you messages like, “Is it 
supposed to look like someone threw random pages of clip art into 
a blender?” That’s why testing your site before you publish it live on the 
mobile Web is important.
The bad news is that just as designing for the mobile Web is more painstak-
ing and demanding, so too is it tougher to reliably test your pages to make 
sure they look good on every possible mobile device, under every conceiv-
able set of circumstances.
The good news is that mobile developers and designers have been aware of 
this problem for a long time and have gradually chipped away at the problem. 
At least four levels of mobile testing are available right now, and this chapter 
explains the testing methods you can choose from, ranging from free and open 
source on the low end, to an expensive and complex device farm (an array of 
mobile devices, all activated with data plans and connections to the mobile Web) 
on the high end. You find an introduction to the online testing tools, including 
the ones provided by the World Wide Web Consortium (WC3) for testing your 
site’s code (which tests how the code works under the hood rather than how the 
page looks in different devices). You find steps that walk you through checking 
links with Dreamweaver. And when you complete all the rigors of testing, you 
also find steps for publishing your site using Dreamweaver’s built-in File Transfer 
Protocol (FTP) tools as well as an introduction to other popular FTP options.

Part II: Following Mobile Web Standards 
Comparing Mobile Testing Solutions
The most important principle to understand when testing your mobile Web 
site can be summed up in one well-worn aphorism: “In theory, there is no dif-
ference between theory and practice — but in practice, there is.” Just so is it 
with the mobile Web. Although the simulators and emulators we include in 
this chapter approximate how various devices will display a Web page, in the 
real world of mobile devices and carriers lurk all sorts of variables, quirks, 
and oddities you can’t replicate with even the best mobile simulators on your 
desktop computer.
 
No matter how accurate the emulators or browser add-ons you use to make 
the computer on your desktop act like a mobile phone, they can’t factor in all 
the variables of local wireless carriers. Wireless carriers have a lot of power 
and they can cause real problems by, for example, deciding that video gobbles 
up too much bandwidth and putting a cap on usage. No matter how much 
work you’ve put into optimizing your mobile video Web site, the ultimate 
performance of your pages will depend on the wireless connection and any 
Understanding user agents and user agent switchers
You see a couple terms a lot in this chapter: user 
agent, user agent switcher, and HTTP request 
header. Most of mobile Web testing involves 
interpreting or manipulating these snippets of 
computer code. Why are user agents and head-
ers important in mobile Web design? Because 
they tell the Web server what kind of device, 
operating system, and browser you are using 
when you visit a Web site.
If you’ve ever seen one of those movies about 
upper-crust Victorian England in which polite 
guests requesting to be admitted into a man-
sion place their business cards on a silver tray 
that a silent, obsequious butler then carries and 
presents to the master of the house, well, user 
agents aren’t quite that stuffy, but the basic 
principle is the same.
When you type a Web address into a Web 
browser, or click a link to navigate to a Web 
page, a series of functions happen invisibly 
and with lightning speed. Your browser sends 
an HTTP request header, which includes a 
user agent, to the Web server. The user agent 
includes information about what kind of phone 
or mobile device is accessing a Web site. Many 
mobile Web developers install scripts on the 
server which use the information submitted 
by user agents to determine which version of 
the Web site to deliver to each visitor based on 
what mobile device the user agent identifies. 
You learn more about how to set up systems 
like this in Chapter 6. What’s important to under-
stand when you’re testing mobile Web sites is 
that if a Web site is set up to deliver a particular 
version of a site based on the user agent, you 
may not be able to see the mobile version of a 
site if you’re using an emulator or simulator on 
a desktop computer, unless you find a way to 
“trick” the server into believing you’re using a 
mobile device. That’s where user agent switch-
ers come in and why the user agent switcher 
add-ons, available for the Firefox and Safari 
Web browsers, and so useful when you’re 
developing or testing mobile Web sites.

141
 Chapter 7: Testing and Publishing Mobile Web Sites
number of things a carrier might do to your pages before they get to a user’s 
mobile device (including blocking large video files).
For example, in September 2007, Vodaphone UK (one of the big mobile carri-
ers in the United Kingdom) decided to start stripping out the user agent from 
the HTML headers coming in from mobile devices (find more on user agents 
in the nearby sidebar “Understanding user agents and user agent switchers”). 
Overnight, mobile sites all over England stopped working properly because 
the detection scripts on Web servers could no longer recognize whether visi-
tors to sites were using mobile devices or desktop computers, which meant 
they couldn’t direct mobile visitors to the mobile version of a Web site (more 
on how detection scripts work in Chapter 6). Usually, when a Web site isn’t 
working properly for your audience, you look for problems on either end of 
the chain — that is, either the site on the server is poorly designed or the 
implementation on the device in the user’s hand is breaking down. But in this 
case, the problem occurred somewhere in the middle, in a place completely 
outside the view or control of mobile Web designers. Fortunately the com-
pany reversed its decision and things are working well again in England, but 
it’s a good example of how even the best mobile simulators aren’t perfect 
because you can’t test all of the variables in mobile design unless you factor 
in wireless carriers.
This is why — in practice — there simply is no substitute for pulling out a 
mobile device, firing up the browser, and loading the Web page you’ve just 
designed on real devices, on each of the carriers your visitors are likely to be 
using. However, before you go out on a crazed shopping spree to amass your 
own collection of the 8,000 (and growing!) mobile devices that can access the 
Web, there are some easier and far cheaper means by which to test your site 
that will give you a good idea of how your pages will work on mobile devices.
Here are the three main methods for testing mobile Web designs:
 
✓ Browser add-ons or plug-ins
 
✓ Mobile emulators and simulators
 
✓ The actual device(s)
We examine each one of these in detail in the following sections.
Installing Mobile Add-Ons for Firefox
 
The quickest (and cheapest) way to see whether your mobile Web designs are 
at all functional is to use add-ons in Firefox to impersonate a mobile device 
requesting a page. One of the most useful add-ons for mobile Web designers is 
the User Agent Switcher described in detail in this section. This add-on makes 
it possible for you to control the HTTP request header and user agent that 

142
Part II: Following Mobile Web Standards 
Firefox sends to a Web server, tricking the server into identifying your com-
puter as a mobile device so that sites that use device detection will send back 
the mobile version of a Web page rather than the desktop version.
Combining the User Agent Switcher with other add-ons that cause Firefox to 
render Web pages in a narrow window can give you a rough approximation of 
how mobile Web pages will display. Most Firefox add-ons are free, although 
some developers ask that you donate money if you like how they work. We 
encourage you to support their efforts.
 
Although these add-ons are constantly improving, there are some very basic 
ways in which a desktop browser, no matter how it’s configured, will never 
match the behavior of a mobile device. Because processor speed, memory, stor-
age, and connection reliability are so much better in the desktop environment, 
any emulator you use on your computer can give you a false sense of confidence.
Although there are add-ons for Safari and Internet Explorer, they’re nowhere 
near as extensive and up to date as the stuff created by the vibrant open-
source community that develops for Firefox. If you want to browse through 
the entire list of add-ons for the Firefox browser, go to the Firefox add-on 
home page at https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox.
To install any Firefox add-ons, including the ones that we describe specifi-
cally in the following sections, follow these steps:
 
1. Using the Firefox Web browser, navigate to the page on the Firefox 
site that features the add-on you want to add to your browser.
 
 One of our top recommendations is the User Agent Switcher, described 
in more detail in the following section. You can find that add-on at 
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/59 or you 
can search for the title of the add-on using the search box on the Firefox 
add-on home page.
 
2. Click the Add to Firefox button.
 
 A window pops up, asking whether you’re certain that you want to 
install this add-on and warning you to install add-ons only from develop-
ers you trust.
 
 Meanwhile, a little countdown timer runs while the add-on loads, until 
finally the Install button is no longer grayed out.
 
3. Click the Install button.
 
 Another window opens, and a progress bar shows that the add-on is 
installed. After the add-on is installed into Firefox, you’re prompted to 
restart Firefox.
 
4. Restart Firefox after each add-on.
 
 Alternatively, you can install a bunch of add-ons at once and then restart 
to activate them all.

143
 Chapter 7: Testing and Publishing Mobile Web Sites
The following sections highlight some of our favorite add-ons for doing 
mobile Web testing using your desktop computer.
User Agent Switcher
The User Agent Switcher is one of the most useful add-ons we’ve found for 
basic mobile testing. As you might suspect from the name, the User Agent 
Switcher (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/59) 
allows you to change the identifying string of code that your browser sends 
to a server to introduce you (for more on user agents, read the sidebar, 
“Understanding user agents and user agent switchers” earlier in this chapter).
Without the User Agent Switcher, Firefox sends its default user agent code 
in the HTTP request header, and you will have a hard time viewing many 
mobile-optimized Web pages because many sites automatically redirect visi-
tors to the mobile version of a site based on the information in the request 
header. The User Agent Switcher (see Figure 7-1) comes with an eclectic mix 
of about a dozen browsers and devices that you can set your Firefox browser 
to impersonate. After you install the add-on, you can add more user agents, 
so you can test your Web site designs across a broader spectrum of devices.
 
Figure 7-1: 
The User 
Agent 
Switcher for 
the Firefox 
browser.
 
To activate the User Agent Switcher, in Firefox, choose Tools➪Default User 
Agent➪Browser You Want to Emulate. Then reload the page in Firefox to see 
the new version.

144
Part II: Following Mobile Web Standards 
To install more user agents:
 
1. After you install the User Agent Switcher, covered in the previous 
section, open the Firefox Web browser and navigate to http://
mobiforge.com/developing/blog/user-agent-switcher-config-
file.
 
 At the end of the blog post is a link to a text file containing user agents 
for a wider variety of phones and mobile browsers.
 
2. Right-click (Ô-click on a Mac) the useragentswitcher.xml_.txt link and 
choose Save Link As.
 
 The Enter Name of File to Save To dialog box opens.
 
3. Navigate to the folder on your local hard drive where you want to 
save the file.
 
4. In the File Name field of the Enter Name of File to Save To dialog box, 
you need to change the name of this file by deleting the _.txt from 
the end of the filename.
 
 This is a little clumsy, we know — but the file must end with .xml not 
.txt for it to be recognized by the User Agent Switcher when you 
import it in the steps that follow. Fortunately, the solution is easy. 
Just delete the _.txt off the end so that the filename is shortened to 
useragentswitcher.xml. (If you prefer, you can delete the .txt 
extension from the filename after you save the file; just make sure you 
do it before you move on to Step 6.)
 
5. Click the Save button.
 
6. Choose Tools➪Default User Agent➪User Agent Switcher➪Options.
 
 The User Agent Switcher Options dialog box opens to allow you to 
import other user agents.
 
7. Click the Import button.
 
 The Import User Agents dialog box opens.
 
8. Navigate to where you saved the useragentswitcher.xml file, click 
the file to select it, and then click the Open button.
 
 The Import User Agent dialog box closes and returns you to the User 
Agent Switcher Options dialog box, which now displays a longer list of 
browsers and devices because it includes all of the user agents from the 
.xml file (as shown in Figure 7-2).
 
9. To activate any of these new user agents, choose Tools➪Default User 
Agent and select the user agent you want to emulate.
 
 If you want to add more devices to the list, do a Google search for user 
agent .xml files and repeat the steps in this section.

Small Screen Renderer
The Small Screen Renderer add-on (https://addons.mozilla.org/
en-US/firefox/addon/526) displays Web pages in a very narrow colum-
nar format in Firefox. Used in conjunction with the User Agent Switcher add-
on, this can give you a pretty good visual approximation of what a Web page 
might look like on the small screen of a mobile device.
To activate the Small Screen Renderer, choose View➪Small Screen 
Rendering. You can use the Small Screen Renderer without the User Agent 
Switcher. However, if you don’t have the User Agent Switcher activated and 
set to a mobile device, all the Small Screen Renderer will do is display the 
desktop version of a Web site in a very narrow columnar format. We encour-
age you to use these two add-ons together for best results.
For example, ESPN devotes significant resources to making their Web pres-
ence as mobile-friendly as possible, but you won’t be able to see the mobile 
versions of the site by entering www.espn.com into a Web browser on a 
desktop computer unless you use the User Agent Switcher (covered in the 
previous section). Combine the User Agent Switcher add-on with the Small 
Screen Renderer, and you can get a pretty good idea of how a site like ESPN 
will look in a variety of different mobile devices. Figure 7-3 shows the ESPN 
site as it appears in Internet Explorer 8 on a desktop computer. Compare that 
to Figure 7-4, which shows how the ESPN site displays in Firefox on a desk-
top computer, when the Small Screen Renderer add-on is used with the User 
Agent Switcher set to impersonate a Nokia N70 mobile phone.

 Chapter 7: Testing and Publishing Mobile Web Sites
XHTML Mobile Profile
The XHTML Mobile Profile add-on (https://addons.mozilla.org/
en-US/firefox/addon/1345) allows Firefox to display XHTML MP Web 
pages more effectively. You learn more about designing pages for mobile 
devices using the XHTML Mobile Profile in Chapters 3 and 6.
wmlbrowser
The wmlbrowser (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/
addon/62) runs in the background to allow Firefox to display mobile Web 
pages designed in Wireless Markup Language (WML). Most Mobile Web 
designers don’t use WML anymore, but there are still many old Web pages on 
the Internet that were created this way. For more on WML, see Chapter 5.
Using Mobile Emulators
You can preview mobile designs and get a pretty good idea of how they will 
look on many different mobile devices by using mobile emulators (also called 
simulators). We offer more detailed descriptions in the section that follows, 
but here are three general categories of mobile testing options that simu-
late mobile Web browsers, operating systems, and the limitations of mobile 
devices:
 
✓ Mobile emulators that work within a desktop Web browser: You’ll find 
many Web sites that offer mobile emulators. These are the simplest but 
most limited options for testing how Web sites will appear on mobile 
devices.
 
✓ Emulators you download and install on your computer: Many device 
manufacturers offer emulators of their devices, as well as more com-
plete SDKs (software development kits) that can be downloaded and 
installed on your computer.
 
✓ More advanced options: It’s difficult to categorize all of the testing 
options in the ever-changing world of mobile Web design, so we’re lump-
ing several high-end services (including our favorites) into this category.

148
Part II: Following Mobile Web Standards 
Testing with online mobile emulators 
in a Web browser
Although they offer the simplest option for testing mobile Web designs, 
most emulators that work within a Web browser suffer from two big limita-
tions. First, they are running on your computer, which almost certainly has a 
much faster processor and many other capabilities you won’t find on mobile 
phones, and second, unless you’re using the User Agent Switcher described 
in the “Installing Mobile Add-Ons for Firefox” section earlier in this chapter, 
all you’re doing is opening the desktop version of a site in a small window 
within a Web browser.
iPhone
Although you may be tempted to test your pages in the online emulators at 
www.iphonetester.com or www.testiphone.com, beware that they can 
be very misleading if your goal is to see what your site will look like on an 
actual iPhone. For example, we tested both of these online tools by enter-
ing the URL of a site we know includes files created with Adobe Flash. If you 
know much about the limitations of the iPhone, you know that the iPhone 
doesn’t support Flash. But, despite that well-known limitation, both of these 
iPhone emulators displayed the Flash files perfectly. We consider that rather 
misleading and have to give them low marks as a result. Like many online emu-
lators that work within a Web browser, these services do little more than show 
you how your pages will look within the limited screen size of a mobile phone.
Opera Mini
If you want to see how your mobile Web page looks on some of the most 
limited, low-end mobile devices on the market, you can test with the Opera 
Mini demo site (www.opera.com/mini/demo), which does a pretty good 
job of showing how a page will display within the limited functionality of the 
Opera mini Web browser. This emulator is especially useful if you are target-
ing the vast international market that is more likely to use the Opera browser 
than most mobile phone users in the United States. Tip: For best results, use 
this emulator in combination with the User Agent Switcher described in the 
“Installing Mobile Add-Ons for Firefox” section earlier in this chapter.
dotMobi
The dotMobi site features an emulator at http://mtld.mobi/emulator.
php, which simulates how Web sites look on some of the most basic mobile 
devices, including the Sony K750 and the Nokia N70 (see Figure 7-5). Although 
the selection is very limited, and like other options in this category it works 
best when used with the User Agent Switcher described in the “Installing 
Mobile Add-Ons for Firefox” section earlier in this chapter, the service can 
give you an idea of what your mobile site may look like in some of the most 
limited phones still in use today.

149

although 
limited to 
just a few 
choices,

site looks 
like.
 
The dotMobi site also includes a code-testing engine similar to the testing 
services on the W3C Web site (see the “Testing Your Site Code with the W3C 
Tools” section, later in this chapter). The dotMobi code-testing engine checks 
your mobile code for conflicts or errors that might have slipped past you. To 
use this service, navigate to http://ready.mobi/index.html and enter 
the URL of any site that you want to test.
Downloading mobile emulators and SDKs
Although it takes more time and effort to download, install, and use Mobile 
emulators and SDKs, these tools generally do a better job of simulating how 
a mobile device will work on a desktop computer than most of the emulators 
you’ll find on the Web. These tools are most often used by programmers cre-
ating applications for mobile devices, but they can also be useful to mobile 
Web designers.
Phones that run Android
The Google Android operating system is being used in an ever-growing list of 
mobile devices. You can download the Android SDK, which includes a mobile 
device emulator, by visiting http://developer.android.com/guide/
developing/tools/emulator.html.

150
Part II: Following Mobile Web Standards 
The Android emulator, as shown in Figure 7-6, is a little tricky to manipulate 
using a desktop computer. Be careful when clicking on the screen to use the 
directional buttons (also known as a “D-Pad”) when you move around pages 
because they can cause the screen to keep moving long after you stop.
BlackBerry
The profusion of BlackBerry devices, which come in many different screen 
sizes and with different versions of the browser and operating system, make 
designing for BlackBerry phones especially demanding. To help manage these 
variations, you can download emulators for a wide range of BlackBerry devices 
at www.blackberry.com/developers/downloads/simulators/. You 
must sign up for an account with BlackBerry before you can download the 
emulators, but they are available for free.
As you can see from the menu shown in Figure 7-7, BlackBerry offers emula-
tors for dozens of BlackBerry phones, used on a variety of carriers. Once you 
have decided which BlackBerry emulator you want to download, double-click 
the name of the device, and follow the instructions on the BlackBerry Web 
site to install the emulator on your computer.

Testing with more sophisticated services
If you have the money and you work on a project in which it’s critical that 
your mobile Web site be tested across a wide variety of devices, the high-end 
services may be worth the cost.
DeviceAnywhere
Our favorite option for testing mobile designs on a wide variety of devices 
using a desktop computer, DeviceAnywhere (www.deviceanywhere.com) 
allows you to access more than 1,500 handsets and test them as they would 
perform on carriers in the United States, Canada, England, Spain, Germany, 
France, and Brazil.
The electronic innards of all the devices are wired into long racks connected 
to the Internet; when you sign up for the service, you can choose a device 
(see Figure 7-8 for an idea of the line-up of available devices) and then use 
your computer mouse and keyboard to manipulate it. For example, you can 
type a URL into a browser on any phone directly to see how it will display in

that phone’s Web browser, on its operating system, as it should be delivered 
by the carrier you selected. You can also click a simulated keypad to send a 
Short Message Service (SMS, or “text”) message, and even connect a micro-
phone and speaker to your computer to test audio-related features, such as 
listening to music or using the microphone to leave a short voice message.
 
Figure 7-8:

Anywhere 
shows the

To use DeviceAnywhere, you first sign up for an account and then download 
and install their special software on your hard drive. After you launch their 
program, you access the DeviceAnywhere service using their program over 
the Internet where you can access a wide variety of mobile devices.
After you open the DeviceAnywhere service, you scroll through a list of avail-
able phones, as shown in Figure 7-8. Sometimes devices are busy or out of 
commission, but after extensive testing, we found the service to be remark-
ably reliable. When you find a device you want to use, right-click (Ô-click on 
the Mac) to select and open the device.
After a device opens on your screen, you can use your mouse to click the but-
tons on the image of the phone to interact as if you were pressing the keys 
on the phone’s keypad. It can take a little trial and error to figure out how to 
use some devices, especially limited feature phones that you may never have 
used before, but DeviceAnywhere includes a few special tools to help you 
enter URLs and interact with each phone.

The first three hours of testing are free (albeit limited to eight of the most 
popular devices), but after that, the testing packages can get expensive. The 
time spent testing the devices is measured in 6-minute (1/10 of an hour) 
increments, and the devices have a built-in fail-safe mechanism that shuts 
them down and disconnects you if you forget and leave one running in the 
background for 30 minutes. Additional testing hours cost about $16/hour, 
with package deals reducing the cost.
 
The quickest way to run through your minutes is to get carried away with 
the cornucopia of devices that are available to play with at DeviceAnywhere. 
Always right-click (on a Mac, Ô-click) to disconnect the device as soon as 
you’re done testing.
Keynote
Keynote (www.keynote.com) offers a high-end service that includes test-
ing your mobile Web sites, applications, and other services for you. Keynote 
serves big companies and is a premium (by that, we mean not cheap) service 
that provides testing and monitoring using real devices on a broad range of 
mobile carriers all over the world.
Services from device manufacturers
Some device manufacturers provide support services for designers and 
developers of mobile Web sites and applications, although you may have to 
pay hefty fees for such special help. For example, Research in Motion (RIM), 
the maker of the BlackBerry line of smartphones, might set up a server and 
custom-built emulator to help a large bank test its mobile banking site across 
a variety of BlackBerry phones. Check with device manufacturers for more infor-
mation on their custom services if you need this kind of high-level support.
Testing with Adobe’s Device Central
If you use Adobe Dreamweaver, bundled along with it is the Device Central 
application that makes it possible for you to see your designs on some 
mobile devices. The initial selection is quite limited, but you can add new 
phone profiles. The functionality of the devices is still somewhat less 
accurate than in high-end emulators like DeviceAnywhere, but if you use 
Dreamweaver, this is a quick way to at least get an idea of how your site will 
display on a variety of devices. While much of Device Central focuses on 
empowering you to test Flash Lite applications on mobile devices, you can 
test any Web page on your hard drive using this program.
Follow these steps to preview your pages with Device Central:
 
1. Open a Web page that you want to preview in Dreamweaver, choose 
File➪Preview in Browser, and select Device Central from the list 
of options.

154
Part II: Following Mobile Web Standards 
 
 The page opens in Device Central, which displays the page in one of the 
many mobile emulators installed in the program.
 
2. In the Test Center panel on the left, choose My Devices. Then in the 
panel in the middle, select any device.
 
 The page you’re previewing displays in that device. You can choose any 
of the available options (indicated by a green circle) in the list of devices 
in the center panel to view the page in different devices.
 
3. Study the page carefully and test all the links, rollovers, and any other 
special effects to make sure that the page appears the way you want it 
to on this mobile device.
 
 You navigate around a Web page using these devices, much like you 
would if you had the real phone. For example, use your mouse to click 
the navigation arrows just above the keypad to scroll up, down, left, 
and right.
 
4. Close Device Central and return to Dreamweaver to make any neces-
sary changes to the page.
 
You can add more devices to Adobe Device Central on a Windows computer 
by choosing Devices➪Download Device Profile, but your computer must 
be connected to the Internet for this feature to work. On a Mac, choose 
Devices➪Add to Test Devices.
Testing with the Actual Devices
Every mobile designer worth his salt admits that you can only do so much 
with tools on a desktop computer to simulate what users do in the real world 
with your carefully crafted mobile Web pages. For instance, the following are 
just some of the problems that could arise when you view your Web designs 
the way mobile phone users see them:
 
✓ Your color scheme is unreadable under harsh daylight conditions.
 
✓ Your multimedia files are too large to work on the limited processor of a 
mobile device.
 
✓ Clicking on your navigation links is frustrating, or even impossible, given 
the limited interface options of a mobile device.
 
✓ Scrolling through long pages of data is exceptionally tedious.
 
✓ Having your page open for 15 minutes completely drains the battery.
You can’t know these things sitting in a comfy chair in a safe, air-conditioned 
office with all of the power of your desktop computer and the interface 
options of a mouse and keyboard.

155
 Chapter 7: Testing and Publishing Mobile Web Sites
 
True mobile gurus say the best option is to have shelves, drawers, or closets 
overflowing with mobile testing units, but most settle for a representative 
sampling of the 3 to 10 most common devices. If you don’t have the resources 
to keep multiple mobile phones on hand for testing, consider these options:
 
✓ Use the friends and family plan. That is, reach out to all your friends 
and family members, ask them what kinds of phones they use, and then 
enlist them as testers for your site(s).
 
✓ As your needs grow, you may find that you need to add more handsets 
to your roster of supported testing platforms (after all, you can’t expect 
your friends to rush out and buy the latest, greatest mobile gizmo just 
because you need to see how your images resize). The next stage in 
assembling an ad-hoc mobile testing network is to start reaching out 
to people through social-networking sites, such as Facebook, Twitter, 
MySpace, or LinkedIn. Simply ask via these networks whether people 
can check out your mobile site and leave you a note about what they 
think and what device they used to access the site.
 
✓ Join professional associations, such as Mobile Monday (www.mobile
monday.net), or any group of Web designers, and attend (or organize) 
gatherings where you get together and test each other’s sites.
 
✓ Make frequent trips to electronics and cellphone stores (rotating the 
stores so that the clerks don’t get sick of your incessant questions), and 
even stop people on the street or in shopping malls to ask them whether 
they can help.
Testing Your Site Code with the W3C Tools
Before you take that last fateful step and hit the button to make your mobile 
Web site finally go live, do one last check (dubbed an idiot check) to make 
sure that you haven’t missed something obvious.
Testing your Web designs with the W3C validation tools has always been a 
good idea, but it’s even more important for mobile Web design. Desktop Web 
browsers, including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome, are surprisingly 
forgiving of common errors in XHTML code. Mobile Web browsers are not. 
That’s because mobile Web browsers are much smaller applications than 
their desktop counterparts and don’t have the capacity to handle even the 
most common mistakes in coding.
The W3C, long revered for its work on developing and encouraging the use 
of standards on the Web, has a new mobileOK Checker (see Figure 7-9) that 
checks for known issues on mobile phones (http://validator.w3.org/

156
Part II: Following Mobile Web Standards 
mobile). The tester runs through your site, checking your code for known 
conflicts and errors, and then returns a report on what you need to do to 
clean up things.
While you’re at it, test the markup language on your site at http://
validator.w3.org/ and then test the CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) on 
your site at http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/.
 
Your pages work better in Web browsers when they’re error-free, and search 
engines will like them better, too.

can be a bit 
of an ego-
deflator, but

to make

minute fixes 
on glaring 
errors.
 
Choosing a Mobile Domain
You can upload your mobile Web page files to your Web server using FTP, 
just as you would upload the files of any desktop Web site (as you learn in 
the section that follows). The real challenge is deciding where to put your 
mobile version. At least eight (at last count) domain variations are commonly 
in use for mobile Web sites. Some mobile Web designers publish their mobile 
sites to a new domain with the .mobi domain ending. Many other designers 
are using subdomains, a version of a regular domain that shares the same 
basic address.
Table 7-1 demonstrates some common subdomains and shows some exam-
ples of what the full URL would look like.

157
 Chapter 7: Testing and Publishing Mobile Web Sites
Table 7-1 
Common Mobile Subdomains
Subdomain Prefix
Example
iphone
iphone.slightlyusedcats.com
m
m.slightlyusedcats.com
mobile
mobile.slightlyusedcats.com
pda
pda.slightlyusedcats.com
xhtml
xhtml.digitalfamily.com
wap
wap.artesianmedia.com
wml
wml.hardnewsinc.com
wireless
wireless.sipsfromthefirehose.com
Some mobile designers prefer to use folder names to add a mobile address. 
In this case, you simply upload the mobile version of your site to a special 
folder with a name such as /m, /mobile, /i or /iphone, /gmm, /portable, 
or /wireless. If you set this folder up at the main root directory level of 
your site, and name the home page of your mobile site index.html, the URL 
would look something like this: www.digitalfamily.com/m/.
 
Our testing has shown that on low-end feature phones, it is often difficult to 
enter the “/” character. If you are designing a site for such basic devices, you 
might want to consider setting up a subdomain that uses a prefix, such as 
those included in the Table 7-1, rather than a folder name.
After you set up your mobile site (or sites) at one or more special URLs, 
you can link directly to those addresses and promote the addresses in your 
advertising. If you want to route the traffic from mobile sites directly to these 
addresses, you have to use some kind of mobile detection and redirection 
system. For more on this subject, please see Chapter 6.
Publishing Your Mobile Web Site
After you create and test your Web site so that it’s ready to publish on the 
Web, you can use Dreamweaver’s publishing tools to upload your site to 
your Web server. Which features you use depends on the kind of Web server 
you use. If you use a commercial service provider, you most likely need 
Dreamweaver’s FTP features, which we cover in detail in the following sec-
tion. (If you prefer to use your own FTP program, see the nearby sidebar, 
“Using a dedicated FTP program.”)

158
Part II: Following Mobile Web Standards 
You need the following information from your Web hosting service before you 
can configure Dreamweaver’s FTP features. Most service providers send this 
information in an e-mail message when you sign up for an account. If you don’t 
have this information, you need to contact your service provider for it because 
it’s unique to your account on your Web hosting service. Here’s what you need:
 
✓ The FTP hostname: A hostname is basically a human-readable nickname 
used by the Internet to locate a particular server. For example: ftp.
domainname.com.
 
✓ The path to the Web directory (optional but highly recommended): 
The path looks similar to /web/htdocs/slightlyusedcats.
 
✓ Your FTP login or username: This is your personal username, which 
you created or was assigned to you when you established your Web 
hosting account.
 
✓ Your FTP password
 
✓ Any special instructions from your server: For example, you may need 
to use Passive FTP or any of the other advanced settings covered in 
the section that follows. This varies from server to server, so you need 
to ask your Web hosting service. (If you’re having trouble connecting 
Using a dedicated FTP program
If you prefer to use a dedicated FTP program 
instead of Dreamweaver’s built-in features, you 
can download FTP programs for the Mac and 
PC at the following Web addresses:
 ✓ http://fireftp.mozdev.org: 
FireFTP is a nifty little FTP program that’s 
an add-on to Firefox and a great alterna-
tive to Dreamweaver’s FTP features. Ideal 
for fixing things when you’re on the road 
and don’t have Dreamweaver handy or 
when you just want to view the files on 
your server without using Dreamweaver, 
this program can be added to any version 
of Firefox (for free).
 ✓ http://filezilla-project.org: 
FileZilla is a popular open-source option 
that works on computers running Windows, 
Mac, and Linux operating systems.
 ✓ www.ipswitch.com: A popular FTP 
program for the PC, WS_FTP is such a 
sophisticated FTP program that many Web 
designers will pay for the cost of this pro-
gram, which offers a free trial version.
 ✓ www.cuteftp.com: A popular Windows 
program, CuteFTP, can be downloaded 
from the Web site.
 ✓ www.fetchsoftworks.com and 
www.panic.com/transmit: If you 
use a Macintosh computer, popular options 
are Fetch, available for download at the 
former Web address, and Transmit, avail-
able for download at the latter address.
 ✓ http://cyberduck.ch: Web design-
ers working on the Mac platform are sin-
gling out the freeware program Cyberduck 
for praise because it works not just with 
FTP programs, but also for managing 
Amazon S3 cloud-based sites.

159
 Chapter 7: Testing and Publishing Mobile Web Sites
and you’re not sure about these options, you can always experiment by 
selecting and deselecting these options to see whether a setting enables 
you to connect.)
Setting up Dreamweaver’s FTP features
After you gather all your FTP information, you’re ready to set up 
Dreamweaver’s FTP publishing features. This process can seem daunting and 
often takes a few tries to get right, but the good news is that you have to do 
it only once. (Dreamweaver saves these settings for you so you don’t have to 
set them up every time you want to upload new pages to your site.)
Follow these steps to set up Dreamweaver’s FTP features and publish files to 
a Web server:
 
1. Open Dreamweaver and choose Site➪Manage Sites.
 
 The Manage Sites dialog box opens.
 
2. In the list of defined sites, select the site you want to publish and then 
click the Edit button.
 
 The Site Setup dialog box opens. If your site isn’t listed in this dialog 
box, you haven’t set up your site.
 
3. Select Servers from the categories listed in the left panel of the Site 
Setup dialog box.
 
 The server list appears. If you haven’t set up any Web servers in 
Dreamweaver, this list is blank, as shown in Figure 7-10. Any servers you 
have set up properly are listed in this dialog box.
 
Figure 7-10: 
Click the 
small plus 
sign at the 
bottom of 
the Site 
Setup dialog 
box to open 
the Basic 
server con-
figuration 
window 
where you 
can enter 
your FTP 
information.
 

160
Part II: Following Mobile Web Standards 
 
4. Click the small plus sign at the bottom left of the server list area, as 
shown in Figure 7-10.
 
 The Basic tab opens in the Servers dialog box and FTP is selected auto-
matically, as shown in Figure 7-11. (If you need to use an option other 
than FTP, look ahead to the list at the end of these steps.)
 
Figure 7-11: 
Enter all the 
information 
from your 
Web hosting 
company, 
including 
your name 
and pass-
word, in 
the Basic 
Server 
Setup dialog 
box.
 
 
5. Enter a name in the Server Name field.
 
 You can name your server anything you like. Choose a name that lets 
you easily choose among the servers you’ve set up. (If you only use one 
Web server to host your site, this doesn’t matter as much as if you host 
your site on multiple sites, which is generally done only by very large or 
international sites.)
 
6. Enter the FTP address for your Web server account.
 
 Again this information depends on how your Web server is set up, but 
most use one of the following: ftp.servername.com, ftp.your
domainname.com, or simply yourdomain.com without anything at the 
beginning of the domain.
 
7. In the Username and Password fields, type your username (or login 
name) and password, respectively.
 
 Again, this information is unique to your account on your Web server.

161
 Chapter 7: Testing and Publishing Mobile Web Sites
 
8. Select the Save check box to the right of the Password field if you 
want Dreamweaver to store your access information.
 
 This is handy because you can then automatically connect to the server 
anytime you want to upload or download pages. However, selecting the 
Save check box could enable anyone with access to your computer to 
gain access to your Web server.
 
9. Click the Test button to make sure you’ve entered everything 
correctly.
 
 Making a mistake is so easy, so the ability to test the connection and 
make any needed adjustments before you close this dialog box is help-
ful. If you connect without any problems, Dreamweaver responds with a 
box saying Dreamweaver connected to your Web server suc-
cessfully. (Note: You must save the password to use the test feature, 
but you can deselect the Save box after you test if you prefer not to save 
the password in the program.)
 
 If you have trouble connecting to your site, skip ahead to Step 11 for a 
few advanced options that may help.
 
10. In the Root Directory (also known as the local site folder) field, type 
the directory name of the remote site in which documents visible to 
the public are stored.
 
 The root directory usually looks something like public_html/ or www/
htdocs/. Again, this depends on your server.
 
 If you upload your files to the wrong directory on your server, they 
aren’t visible when you view your site through a browser.
 
11. Click the small arrow to the left of More Options.
 
 You may not need to change any of these settings, but if you have trou-
ble connecting to your server and are sure you’ve entered your user-
name, password, and FTP address correctly, adjusting these settings 
may enable you to connect.
 
 Select and deselect each of these options and then click the Test button 
after each change to see whether any of these adjustments make the dif-
ference and enable you to connect to your server.
 
 A little experimentation with settings before waiting on hold with tech 
support is usually worth the effort. But if you’re really having trouble 
establishing a connection with your server, call or e-mail the tech sup-
port staff at your Web server. The only people who can help you are 
those who run your Web server because the settings are specific to your 
service provider and can vary dramatically from one hosting company 
to another. We’ve done our best to give you the most common options 
here, and with a little trial and error, the suggestions here should help 
you connect to most Web hosting companies. If you’re really stuck 
though, ask for more help from the people who run your server.

162
Part II: Following Mobile Web Standards 
 
12. After you fill in everything, click the Test button; if you successfully 
connect to your server, click the Save button to save your settings.
 
 Dreamweaver saves all your FTP settings (assuming you opted to save 
the password). The beauty is that you never have to enter these settings 
again after they work properly, and you can access your Web server 
from the Files panel in Dreamweaver, as you can read about in the next 
section.
 
Dreamweaver provides five access options. If you work at a large company or 
university, you’re likely to use one of the following options rather than FTP. 
The options available from the Connect Using drop-down list (see Figure 7-11) 
are as follows:
 
✓ FTP: Provides basic File Transfer Protocol connection and transfer 
features.
 
✓ SFTP: Provides a more secure FTP connection. If you can use a secure 
connection, it’s definitely the preferred choice, and it’s required by 
some Web servers to maintain higher levels of security.
 
✓ Local/Network: Select this option if you’re using a Web server on a local 
network, such as your company’s or university’s server. For specific set-
tings and requirements, check with your system administrator.
 
✓ WebDAV: Select this option if you’re using a server with the WebDAV 
(Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning) protocol, such as 
Microsoft IIS.
 
✓ RDS: Select the RDS (Rapid Development Services) option if you’re using 
ColdFusion on a remote server.
Publishing files to a Web server with FTP
You can upload pages to your server and download pages from your server 
using the built-in FTP capabilities of Dreamweaver.
To transfer files between your hard drive and a remote server (after you’ve 
successfully set up the FTP features we cover in the preceding section of this 
chapter), follow these steps:
 
1. Make sure the site you want to work on is selected in the Files panel 
in Dreamweaver.
 
2. In the top left of the Files panel, click the Connects to Remote Host 
button (which looks like a blue electrical cable plugging into itself).
 
 If you’re not already connected to the Internet, the Connects to Remote 
Host button starts your Internet connection. If you have trouble con-
necting this way, establish your Internet connection as you usually do to 

163
 Chapter 7: Testing and Publishing Mobile Web Sites
check e-mail or surf the Web, and then return to Dreamweaver and click 
the Connects to Remote Host button after you’re connected. When your 
computer is online, Dreamweaver should have no trouble automatically 
establishing an FTP connection with your host server.
 
 If you still have trouble establishing a connection to your Web server, 
refer to the preceding section, “Setting up Dreamweaver’s FTP features,” 
and make sure that you specified the server information correctly.
 
3. After you establish a connection between your computer and your 
Web server, click the Expand/Collapse button (which looks like 
stacked horizontal lines at the far right of the top of the Files panel).
 
 When you click this button, Dreamweaver displays both the local folder 
with your site on your hard drive and the remote folder with the site on 
your server. We prefer this dual view because seeing both folders side 
by side makes moving files from one place to another easier. This dual 
view also helps us visualize the structure of the site on the server.
 
 You can also view your local site folder by choosing Local View from the 
drop-down list at the top right (see Figure 7-12). Or choose Remote View 
to see only the files on the server.
 
Figure 7-12: 
The row 
of buttons 
across 
the top 
control FTP 
functions, 
making it 
easy to con-
nect to your

4. To upload (or transfer from your hard drive to your Web server) a 
file, select the file from the Local View panel (which displays the files 
on your hard drive) and click the Put Files button (the up arrow) in 
the Files panel.
 
 The files are copied automatically to your server when you transfer them. 
You can select multiple files or folders to be transferred simultaneously.

164
Part II: Following Mobile Web Standards 
 
 After you upload files to you server, test your work by using a Web 
browser to view them online. Sometimes things that look and work fine 
on your computer (such as links) don’t work on the server.
 
5. To download (or transfer from your Web server to your hard drive) 
files or folders, select the files or folders from the Remote View panel 
(which displays the files on your server) and click the Get Files button 
(the down arrow) in the Files panel.
 
 The files are copied automatically to your hard drive when you transfer 
them.
 
 When you copy files to or from your server, the files you transfer over-
write the files already at the destination. Dreamweaver notifies you about 
the overwriting if it notices you’re replacing a newer file with an older one, 
but it can’t always correctly assess the proper time differences. Take note 
of these warnings but keep in mind that you can get warnings that aren’t 
always accurate when they’re based on the age of a file, especially if you 
use more than one computer to work on your Web site.
 
 When the transfer is complete, you can open the files on your hard drive.
 
6. To close this dual-panel dialog box and return to Dreamweaver’s main 
workspace, simply click the Expand/Collapse button again.
Finding and Fixing Broken Links
If you’re trying to rein in a chaotic Web site or if you just want to check a site 
for broken links, you’ll be pleased to discover Dreamweaver’s Link Checker. 
You can use this feature to verify the links in a single file or an entire Web 
site, and Link Checker can automatically fix all the referring links at once if a 
link is broken.
For example, assume that someone on your team (because you would never 
do such a thing yourself) changed the name of a file from new.htm to old.
htm without using the Files panel or any of Dreamweaver’s automatic link 
update features. Maybe this person changed the name using another program 
or simply renamed it in Explorer (Windows) or Finder (Mac). Changing the file-
name was easy, but what this person may not have realized is that if he didn’t 
change the links to the file when the file was renamed, the links are now broken.
If only one page links to the file that your clueless teammate changed, fixing 
the broken link isn’t such a big deal. As long as you remember which file the 
page links from, you can simply open that page and use the Property inspec-
tor to reset the link the same way you created the link in the first place.
But many times, a single page in a Web site is linked to many other pages. 
When that’s the case, fixing all the link references can be time-consuming, and 
forgetting some of them is all too easy. That’s why Link Checker is so helpful.

165
 Chapter 7: Testing and Publishing Mobile Web Sites
 
If you’re working on a dynamic, database-driven site or if your site was altered 
with programming that was performed outside Dreamweaver, Link Checker 
may not work properly. Link Checker works best for sites with static HTML 
pages and sites created using DWT Dreamweaver templates.
 
You must have the entire site on your hard drive and you must have com-
pleted the site setup process for Link Checker to work properly.
Checking for broken links
To check a site for broken links, follow these steps:
 
1. In the drop-down list on the left at the top of the Files panel, select the 
site you want to work on.
 
 If you already have the site open in Dreamweaver, you can skip this 
step.
 
2. Choose Site➪Check Links Sitewide.
 
 The Link Checker tab opens in the Results panel at the bottom of the 
page, just under the Property inspector, as shown in Figure 7-13. The tab 
displays a list of internal and external links as well as any pages, images, 
or other items not linked from any other page in the site — dubbed 
orphans. Unused images can waste space on your server, so this list 
is handy if you want to clean up old images or other elements you no 
longer use on the site.
 
 Most service providers limit the amount of space on your server and 
charge extra if you exceed that limit. You can save valuable server 
space by deleting unused files, especially if they’re image or multi-
media files. But just because you delete them from your hard drive 
doesn’t mean they’re deleted from the server. Make sure you remove 
them from the Remote Site window in the Files panel as well as the 
Local Site panel.
 
Figure 7-13: 
The report 
can be 
organized 
by broken 
links, exter-
nal links, 
and unused 
files.

Part II: Following Mobile Web Standards 
Fixing broken links and missing images
Broken links are one of the worst problems you can have on a Web site. After 
you identify a broken link in a site, fix it as soon as possible. Nothing turns 
off visitors faster than clicking a link and getting a File Not Found error 
page, especially if they’re looking for information fast on a mobile device. 
Fortunately, Dreamweaver makes it simple to fix broken links or detect when 
images are missing by providing quick access to files with broken links and 
automating the process of fixing multiple links to the same file.
After using the Link Checker tab described in the preceding section to iden-
tify broken links or missing images, follow these steps to fix them by using 
the Results panel:
 
1. With the Results panel open at the bottom of the page, double-click 
a filename that Dreamweaver identifies as a broken link or missing 
image.
 
 The page and its corresponding Property inspector open. The Results 
panel remains visible.
 
2. Select the broken link or missing image on the open page.
 
3. In the Property inspector, click the Browse button (which looks like 
a folder) to the right of the Src text box to fix an image. To fix a link, 
click the Browse button next to the Link text box.
 
 If you’re fixing an image, the Select Image Source dialog box appears, 
where you can select the image file you need. However, if you’re fixing 
a link, you see a slightly different dialog box, where you need to browse 
for the file in your site folder.
 
4. Click to select the file you need and then click OK.
 
 If you replace an image, the image file reappears on the page. The link 
automatically changes to reflect the new filename and location.
 
 If the link that you correct appears in multiple pages and you fix the 
link using the broken link’s Results panel, Dreamweaver prompts you 
with a dialog box asking whether you want to fix the remaining broken 
link references to the file. Click the Yes button to automatically cor-
rect all other references. Click the No button to leave the other links 
unchanged.

Testing Your Work with Dreamweaver’s 
Site Reporting Feature
If you’ve used Dreamweaver to build your mobile Web site, you can check 
your work using the Dreamweaver Site Reporting feature. This feature allows 
you to create a variety of reports and even customize them to identify prob-
lems with external links, redundant and empty tags, untitled documents, and 
missing alternate text. You can easily miss things — especially when you 
work on a tight deadline — and common problems in Web design are magni-

Follow these steps to produce a site report of your entire Web site:
 
1. In the drop-down list at the top left of the Files panel, select the site 
you want to work on.
 
 If you already have the site you want to test open in Dreamweaver, you 
can skip this step. Note: Your site appears in the Files panel list only if 
you’ve completed the site setup process. See “Setting up Dreamweaver’s 
FTP features,” earlier in this chapter, for more on this.
 
2. Make sure any documents you have open in Dreamweaver’s work-
space are saved by choosing File➪Save All.
 
3. Choose Site➪Reports.
 
 The Reports dialog box appears (see Figure 7-14).

4. In the Report On drop-down list, choose Entire Current Local Site.
 
 We most commonly use this feature to test an entire site just before pub-
lishing it to the Web, but you can choose to check only a single page by 
opening the page in Dreamweaver and then choosing Current Document 
in the Report On drop-down list. You can also run a report on selected 
files or on a particular folder. If you choose Selected Files in Site, you 
must first click to select the pages you want to check in the Files panel.
 
5. In the Select Reports section, select the check boxes for the reports 
you want.
 
 You can select as many reports as you want. Table 7-2 demonstrates 
some of the reports that you can generate.
 
6. Click the Run button to create the report(s).
 
 If you haven’t already done so, you may be prompted to save your file, 
set up your site, or select a folder.
 
 The Results panel appears, as shown in Figure 7-15, displaying a list of 
problems found on the site. To sort the list by category (such as file-
name, line number, or description), click the corresponding column 
heading.
 
Figure 7-15:

7. Double-click any item in the Results panel to open the corresponding 
file in the document window.
 
 The file opens, and the error is highlighted in the workspace.
 
 You can also right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac) any line of the 
report and choose More Info to find additional details about the specific 
error or condition.
 
8. Use the Property inspector or another Dreamweaver feature to correct 
the identified problem and then save the file.

the code by removing the second <h1> tag to make 
the code look like this: <h1>Good headlines 
are harder to write than you might

Removable Empty Tags
Lists the empty tags on your site. Empty tags can occur 
when you delete an image, text section, or other element 
without deleting all the tags applied to the element.
Untitled Documents
Lists filenames that don’t have a title. The title tag 
is easy to forget because it doesn’t appear in the body 
of the page. The title tag specifies the text that 
appears at the very top of the browser window and also 
the text that appears in the Favorites list when someone 
bookmarks a page. You can enter a title for any page by 
entering text in the Title field just above the work area 
or in the Title field in the Page Properties dialog box.

▶ Choosing between CDNs and online video-sharing sites
Just two decades ago, the predominant way that pictures and phones 
interacted was when an unruly 4 year old used a crayon to draw on the 
handset; as for video, the involvement was pretty much limited to chucking 
the device at the TV, hoping to hit the Off button when your legs fell asleep 
on the couch.
How times have changed.
According to Nielsen’s “Three Screen Report,” nearly 50 percent of mobile 
phone users have watched video on their handsets, with teenagers leading 
the way at about seven hours a month spent staring at tiny screens with 
headphones crammed in their ears, immersed in what researchers dub 
cocooning media.
Meanwhile, the widespread inclusion of increasingly higher-resolution cam-
eras onto mobile devices has resulted in forests of hands upraised at just 
about any noteworthy public event as the crowds of people use their mobile 
phones to take pictures or record video.
People use their mobile devices to record, play, and share the significant 
experiences in their lives, the way that an earlier generation used Polaroid 
pictures or scrapbooks to capture moments in time. The challenge for 
designers is that in the last decade, everyone has taken it for granted that 
we can put all manner of media onto Web sites, as increasing broadband 
penetration, disk storage, and display resolution have made the browsing 

174
Part III: Multimedia, Marketing, and E-Commerce 
experience almost as quick and rewarding as changing channels on an HDTV. 
It’s almost commonplace for movies and TV shows to use audio, video, and 
wild animated “splash” pages that load in Flash before the rest of the site is 
displayed.
If you’re old enough to remember the early days of the Internet, just seeing 
a photo-realistic image appear on a full-color monitor was a thrill. We aren’t 
saying that the mobile Web has to go back to those days (even though many 
experts say that a good way to think of designing for mobile is to pretend it’s 
1996, the era of 56K dialup modems).
Although the multimedia that spices up Web sites can be problematic on the 
mobile platform, that doesn’t mean you can’t use multimedia at all. In this 
chapter, we explain the best strategies to make your mobile Web sites dazzle, 
despite the constraints.
Understanding Screen Resolution 
and Color Depth
Before we talk about putting visual elements onto mobile device screens, we 
need to take a moment to define some of the essential terminology. If you’re 
new to creating multimedia for the Web, understanding these basic concepts 
can help you when you optimize photos, videos, and more for your mobile 
site design. If you have a good grasp of display technology, consider this a 
review. If you’re anxious to get into the meat of this chapter, skip to the sec-
tion “Optimizing Images for the Mobile Web,” later in this chapter.
This chapter explains basic concepts and options that work well in mobile Web 
designs. For steps that explain how to set these options by using a graphics 
editor, such as Photoshop or Photoshop Elements, flip to Appendix B.
Color depth
Color depth refers to the number of colors a screen can display, generally 
referred to by the number of bits. Each pixel on a display has a numerical 
value; for example, 1-bit color means that the pixel could be either black or 
white. That pixel would either be on (white) or off (black). The color depth 
then increases in binary (computer language) code. For example, 8-bit color 
is 28, or 256 colors.
You can choose or change an image’s color depth in a graphics editor. 
Here’s what you need to know about color depth when you design for 
different phones:

175
 Chapter 8: Using Images and Multimedia in Mobile Designs
 
✓ Feature phones: Many low-end feature phones still display in 8-bit color, 
which gives images a vaguely cartoony look.
 
✓ Smartphones: Most smartphones use the same standard as desktop 
and laptop computers, and display in 24-bit color, which translates into 
16,777,216 possible colors.
 
Some very high-end graphics cards support 40- and 64-bit color (281.5 trillion 
possible colors), which most sane people would argue is overkill for a device 
that might be viewed in bright sunlight or under sickly fluorescent lamps.
 
Web designers have worked for years to master the art of compressing JPEG 
images or reducing the number of colors in GIF and PNG files to make them 
download faster. On the mobile Web, optimizing images so they download 
quickly is even more important. The more you can restrict your color palette, 
the smaller the file sizes of your images and the faster the page loads.
Screen resolution
Hand in hand with color depth, screen resolution is the other factor that 
affects how crisp and lifelike the images appear. You’re probably more 
familiar with the calculations and proportions relating to screen resolution 
because they’re the type of thing that monitor manufacturers like to tout 
when marketing their products.
As you might expect, the screen resolutions on mobile devices are nowhere 
near as large as on desktop or laptop computers. A good, new, LCD monitor 
or laptop display probably clocks in at around 1920-x-1080-pixel resolution.
 
The highest-resolution mobile devices as of this writing are 960 pixels wide, 
and many mobile phone displays are restricted to 120 pixels wide.
Aspect ratios and orientations
The problem with mobile displays is that not only are they in different resolu-
tions, but they’re also in different aspect ratios, which can be affected by the 
way you hold the device. First, look at aspect ratios: A standard TV displays 
video in 4:3 aspect ratio (or 1:1.33). This is the almost-square format that 
generations of boob-tube addicts know and love. Basically, for every 4 pixels 
across, 3 pixels are down. So the standard-definition TV signal is 640 x 480. 
Recently, with HDTV, there’s been a move to 16:9 aspect ratio (or 1:1.85). 
This ratio is also dubbed widescreen, and a common resolution is 1280 x 720.
The fun starts when you design mobile Web sites, which display on screens 
with different aspect ratios:

176
Part III: Multimedia, Marketing, and E-Commerce 
 
✓ Feature phone aspect ratios: These vary. For instance, the Motorola 
RAZR, in which the display is built into a clamshell-style unit, is tall and 
skinny with a resolution of 176-x-220 pixels, which breaks down into the 
unwieldy resolution ratio of 49:55. Many Nokia models have screens that 
are 176 x 144 in resolution. These narrow and tall feature phone screens 
are still massively popular in emerging markets, and designing for them 
is one of the more challenging tasks you can face.
 
✓ Smartphone aspect ratios: Fortunately, the trend is that new smart-
phones come out in more standard resolutions, such as 320 x 240. 
Astute mathematicians may note that this is exactly half the resolution 
of standard-definition TV. Online video addicts may note that this is the 
resolution used by YouTube for most of its early existence — hardly 
a coincidence given the increased demand by users to watch at least 
some rudimentary video on their handsets.
 
 Further complicating the situation is the increasing use of accelerom-
eters in handsets that detect when the phone is held upright (portrait 
mode) or tilted sideways (landscape), and the soon-to-be-common 
touch-screen phones with ultra-high display resolutions of 960 x 640.
For a sample of all the possible permutations of display capabilities, check 
out the list of more than 8,000 devices maintained at DeviceAtlas (http://
deviceatlas.com/user/10138).
Optimizing Images for the Mobile Web
Just as there is a world of difference between the images for print designs 
and the images used on the desktop Web, so is there a difference between 
images on the desktop Web and the mobile Web. In both cases, moving to 
the newer platform means having to adjust images to have the best quality 
while taking up the smallest possible file size. In this section, we’ll guide you 
through the process of taking images meant for the desktop Web and pro-
cessing them so that they still look decent on mobile devices.
Sizing images for small screens
Cramming your 360-degree panorama photos onto a tiny feature phone’s 
screen makes no sense. Not only would the photos not display correctly, but 
that files alone would probably eat up the user’s entire monthly data plan 
allowance (and take a day to download). Your designs need to honor the 
constraints your users labor under and give them the option to click through 
to higher-resolution images only if they want to see them, rather than forcing 
visitors to download large images on the home page of your mobile site.

177
 Chapter 8: Using Images and Multimedia in Mobile Designs
If you plan to put images on your mobile Web site, the design process goes 
more smoothly if you have a strategy to handle the different screen resolu-
tions and aspect ratios on mobile devices. If you’re designing just one version 
of your Web site for the mobile Web (as described in Chapter 3), you can 
get away with optimizing just one small version of each image that will work 
on most screen sizes. If you have the resources to develop more than one 
mobile version of your site, as we cover in Chapter 6, your best option is to 
create several versions of each image, optimized for different screen sizes, 
and then deliver the best version of the image to each device. The follow-
ing sections explain strategies for sizing your image files, depending on the 
design strategy you choose.
Sizing one image to fit most screens
A practical and timesaving way to create images optimized to work on a par-
ticular handset and operating system is to create one simple Web-optimized 
image that displays on the majority of phones. You rely on the browser 
rendering engine on the phone to perform the resizing tasks. Although this 
isn’t a foolproof method, most mobile browser creators know the browser 
needs to access a wide variety of sites and content, and they build render-
ing engines that transcode (or transform) that content so it displays more or 
less correctly onscreen. (For an introduction to how transcoding works, see 
Chapter 2.)
Using multiple image sizes
If you have the resources and time, the best solution is to tailor a site to each 
handset’s capabilities. With this approach, you create multiple versions of 
each image in different sizes, from 120-pixels wide to 640 pixels, and then 
deliver the size that best fits the device with some kind of device detection 
script, as we describe in Chapter 6.
This is obviously much easier said than done, particularly if you’re trying to 
keep a dynamic site such as the Huffington Post or ESPN updated with fresh 
content on a daily (or even hourly) basis.
 
If you design a portfolio site — where the whole point is to empower your 
client to show off images of his work anywhere, anytime — you may have a 
legitimate need to include higher-resolution images with larger file sizes. The 
best way to handle this situation is to link to the larger images from thumb-
nails or short text descriptions on the home page, or in the main portfolio sec-
tion of your site. That way, your most important pages load quickly with small 
versions of your images that can be viewed by all your visitors, and those 
who are interested in (and have devices capable of handling) high-resolution 
images can choose to download them.

178
Part III: Multimedia, Marketing, and E-Commerce 
If you have a lot of images that need to be resized (for example, if you have a 
fashion portfolio in which the clothing designs are updated each season), you 
can automate the process of resizing and optimizing images using the Actions 
panel in Photoshop (for detailed instructions about setting up actions to 
resize many images at once, see Appendix B).
Choosing an image format
If you work with photos or other images with millions of colors, the JPEG 
format is your best choice for the mobile Web, just as it is for the desktop 
Web. With JPEGs, you can make the file size smaller by applying compres-
sion. The more compression, the smaller the image, but if you compress the 
image too much, the image can look like it was sandblasted and left out in 
the sun. For more about the differences among the various image formats 
and tips on how to best convert an image to a mobile-friendly format, see 
Appendix B.
For images with limited colors, such as line art, logos, and cartoons, the best 
format for mobile devices and Web pages is PNG. Some designers will tell 
you that the GIF format is the safer choice for very old mobile devices and 
some low-end feature phones, but the vast majority of phones surfing the 
mobile Web today support the PNG format, and this format does a better job 
at maintaining image quality and small file sizes than GIFs. With both GIF and 
PNG files, you optimize (or reduce the file size) by reducing the number of 
colors. You find detailed instructions for optimizing GIF, PNG, and JPEG files 
using the Save for Web and Devices dialog box, discussed in Appendix B.
 
Fancy image effects, such as transparent GIFs and PNGs, that are precisely 
laid out with text wrapped around them are extremely iffy on low-end feature 
phones and older mobile devices. Mobile browser rendering engines are likely 
to display the image and text on top of each other, to break apart the words 
letter by letter, to show the text in narrow vertical lines, or to just have a ner-
vous breakdown and display nothing at all. You’re better off simplifying the 
design for the mobile site, choosing a design that doesn’t require transpar-
ency, or both.
Keeping file sizes small
After you know how to optimize PNGs and JPEGs and appreciate the goal of 
making them as small as possible, you may ask, “How small is small enough?”

179
 Chapter 8: Using Images and Multimedia in Mobile Designs
 
Mobile Web designers obsess over ways to make their page sizes smaller, 
without crossing the invisible line between “loads too slow” and “looks junky.” 
Although this is a mostly subjective judgment call, the following points are 
good to remember:
 
✓ The larger your graphics files, the longer people have to wait for them 
to download before they can see them. You may have the most beau-
tiful picture of Mount Fuji on the front page of your Web site, but if it 
takes forever to download, most people aren’t patient enough to wait to 
see it.
 
✓ When you build pages with multiple graphics, you have to consider 
the cumulative download time of all the graphics on the page. Even if 
each image is a small file size, they can add up. Unlike most other things 
in life, smaller is definitely better on the mobile Web.
 
✓ Limit a mobile Web page to about 25K, although you can get away 
with larger sizes if you design for smartphones on a 3G or 4G net-
work. In contrast, most Web pros consider anything from about 75K 
to 150K a good maximum cumulative size for all the elements on a page 
designed for the desktop Web. Without getting too technical, the most 
basic 2G data connections range from about 80 to 100 Kbps, meaning 
that a 150K desktop page in this size range takes up to 20 seconds to 
transmit (and possibly a few seconds longer for the mobile device’s CPU 
to process and render). Most mobile users get frustrated and abandon a 
page that takes that long. The 3G and 4G networks promise data speeds 
that range from 14 Mbps to 1 Gbps, although the actual speeds delivered 
to customers is the subject of some rather fierce debate.
 
Dreamweaver makes it easy to determine the total file size and download time 
of your page:
 
✓ A page’s total file size appears in the status bar at the bottom of the 
document window, as shown in Figure 8-1. In the small text at the 
bottom of a Web page, the status bar shows the total size of all the 
images, text, and code on the page. In the figure, at more than 100K, 
this page is far too large to download efficiently over most mobile 
connections.
 
✓ The download time, based upon a particular connection speed, also 
appears in the status bar. You can change the connection speed by 
choosing Edit➪Preferences➪Status Bar➪Connection Speed. On a Mac, 
choose Dreamweaver➪Preferences➪Status Bar➪Connection Speed.

Resizing images in WordPress
If you use the WordPress blogging tool, depending on how large the image 
you are embedding in your blog is, you can specify up to three sizes for 
images. When you upload an image to the media manager, WordPress auto-
matically resizes the image to small, medium, and large sizes. You can specify 
the dimensions of those three options in the WordPress Dashboard adminis-
trative tools. (Note: If the image you upload is already smaller than the speci-
fied option, the blogging software pretty much doesn’t bother with it. If the 
image is larger than the largest size, the original size is preserved as a fourth 
option.) If you are designing your blog for the mobile Web, one approach to 
managing image size is to take advantage of this automatic resizing function 
by setting the small photo size to the dimensions for a low-end phone (240 
pixels is a good choice), the medium to the dimensions for a high-end phone 
(320 pixels is a good choice), and the large size to best fit the desktop version 
of your site (the best size will depend on the design of your site).
You can change the specified sizes on the Media Settings page in WordPress 
Dashboard. To find these options (as shown in Figure 8-2), open the Dashboard 
and then choose Settings➪Media. Many of the plug-ins we cover in Chapter 9 

181
 Chapter 8: Using Images and Multimedia in Mobile Designs
take care of image resizing, but setting the default images sizes to what you 
want to use on the different pages of your blog is a good practice and a great 
way to automate the delivery of differently sized images to different devices.

Automating image resizing 
in Adobe Photoshop
Optimizing images for the Web is time-consuming enough (you find detailed 
instructions in Appendix B), but if you need to optimize multiple versions in 
multiple sizes, you can waste hours on this task if you try to resize each one 
manually.
Luckily, Photoshop, the most popular image-editing program, makes it pos-
sible to resize images automatically by creating Actions (macro scripts that 
automate a series of steps; see Figure 8-3). In Photoshop, you can create 
Actions with the Actions panel. Creating Actions takes some concentrated 
attention, but after you set them up, you can save lots of time when you 
create multiple versions of images. You find detailed instructions for creat-
ing Actions to automate the process of resizing and optimizing images in 
Appendix B.

Inserting Images into 
Mobile Page Designs
You can insert images into pages designed for mobile devices just as you 
would insert them into any other Web page, using the HTML image tag. The 
HTML image tag is supported by nearly all mobile devices, making it rela-
tively easy to include images in the display area of nearly any mobile phone.
The following is a well-crafted image tag that will insert a photograph that is 
280 pixels by 55 pixels in size and saved as a JPEG:
<img src=”GoldenGateBridge.jpg” alt=”Golden Gate Bridge” 
height=”55” width=”280” />
Here are a few best practices when inserting images into any Web page. 
These are especially important when you’re designing for the mobile Web:
 
✓ Use ALT text. Make sure to include Alternative text to describe the 
image. Because many mobile phones include the option to turn images 
off, the Alt text may be all that your visitors see. If you insert a logo or 
other image with text, make sure to include the text in the Alt field of the 
image tag (as shown in the image tag code example above).

183
 Chapter 8: Using Images and Multimedia in Mobile Designs
 
✓ Limit the size of images. It’s best to use a relatively narrow width, 280 
pixels or smaller, to fit within the limited space of most mobile screens. 
When designing for the smallest mobile devices, you can specify the 
width using a percentage so that the image automatically adjusts to the 
screen size. For example, if you set the size attribute in the image tag to 
width=95%, the image will fill 95 percent of the width of the display area. 
If you use a percentage for width, you don’t need to specify a height.
 
✓ Specify a height and width for each image. Using the height and width 
attributes, as shown in the image tag code example above, helps Web 
browsers load pages more quickly because they don’t have to download 
each image to determine the height and width. 
 
✓ Use supported image formats. Most devices display GIF and JPEG 
images. Increasingly, mobile devices also support images in the PNG 
format, and some even support animated GIFs.
Creating Mobile-Friendly Galleries 
and Slide Shows
Many desktop Web sites feature galleries and slide shows. Unfortunately, 
many of these implementations rely on Flash to work, and as you might be 
aware of by now, many mobile devices don’t support Flash. Slide shows usu-
ally differ from galleries in the following ways:
 
✓ Once you click on the “Play” button on a slide show, the images cycle 
through in the order that the creator of the slide show set up, and as 
rapidly (or slowly) as that person decided was optimal. Good slide 
shows have buttons that you can push to advance to the next picture, to 
pause, or to skip backwards. Bad ones replicate the experience of being 
trapped in some boring relative’s basement, forced to watch hours of 
bland vacation photos.
 
✓ Slide shows often incorporate some kind of accompanying sound that 
goes with the photos; this can be a voiceover, explaining what the 
photos are about, or a musical track. Adding sound to the photos means 
that the photos have to be synced to appear and disappear to the cues 
in the soundtrack, which can be tricky.
 
✓ Galleries tend to be more passive. Usually, there’s an array of thumb-
nail shots of the photos, and when users click on them, the photo 
selected expands to fill most of the page. Some galleries do use Flash or 
Microsoft’s Silverlight technology to animate the transitions from one 
image to the next.
One of the best options for smartphones and touch-screen phones is to 
create slide shows or galleries with JavaScript. Although not all phones 

184
Part III: Multimedia, Marketing, and E-Commerce 
support JavaScript — and even some that do (BlackBerry phones, for 
example) aren’t consistent about their support and allow users to turn off 
JavaScript if they prefer — most of the recent generation of Web-enabled 
phones can handle galleries and slide shows designed with JavaScript.
If you know enough about JavaScript, you can create your own scripts, but 
many programs can help. The following sections introduce a few options for 
galleries and slide shows, as well as a cool way for you to create a photo gal-
lery using your mobile phone camera, where the photos you take are shown 
with little markers on an online map.
 
Make sure the photos you add to any gallery you create are optimized for the 
mobile Web, as we explain earlier in the section, “Optimizing Images for the 
Mobile Web.”
Finding a gallery plug-in or service
Here are a few programs, plug-ins, and online photo services that you can use 
to spruce up your mobile site with slide shows and galleries:
 
✓ Flickr: (www.flickr.com) One of the most popular photo-sharing 
sites, Flickr makes it easy to upload photos to its server and to display 
them on any site in a variety of ways. Flickr does a great job on many 
high-end mobile devices, such as the iPhone, shown in Figure 8-4, but 
doesn’t always take best advantage of the display space, even on high-
end phones, such as the Motorola Droid, shown in landscape view in 
Figure 8-5. To embed a slide show of Flickr images in any Web page, 
navigate to the Flickr photostream you want to add to your site, click on 
the Slideshow link, and then click on Share. On the share page, click on 
the Customize This HTML link to open a page where you can specify the 
dimensions for the slide show. After you adjust the settings, you simply 
copy the HTML code from Flickr in your Web page.
 
✓ SmugMug: (www.smugmug.com) This photo-sharing site offers some 
very cool tools to customize the way your galleries display on your site. 
You can choose whether first time visitors to your site see a banner 
prompting them to switch to the lightweight mobile version. You can 
also password-protect the photos in your galleries, and SmugMug has an 
integrated shopping cart to allow you to sell your photos as well.
 
✓ Jaipho: (www.jaipho.com) This JavaScript gallery is designed for the 
iPhone and makes it easy to create a gallery that mimics the look and 
feel of the original iPhone Photo application. You can quickly scroll 
through photos, both vertically and horizontally. Just tap a photo to 
enlarge it and then tap again to return to browsing. Jaipho includes a 
companion application — Pipho (www.jaipho.com/content/pipho-
php-image-gallery-iphone) — which is installed on the server to 
make it easy for users to add images to galleries by uploading them.

✓ Dreamweaver extensions: (www.adobe.com/exchange) As we write 
this book, none of the extensions on the Adobe site are designed spe-
cifically to create JQuery or AJAX features for mobile devices, but if 
you design pages for high-end phones, most of these extensions create 
code that displays on iPhones and other touch-screen phones or smart-
phones. Extensions are little plug-ins or widgets that you can add to 
Dreamweaver to empower it to do things that weren’t included in the 
original program.
 
✓ Shadowbox: (www.shadowbox-js.com) If you use a WordPress blog, 
Shadowbox is one of the most popular and flexible plug-ins. Shadowbox 
handles images and video (although if your video is in a format incom-
patible with the device, it won’t solve this conflict). With Shadowbox, 
you can easily scroll through a gallery of images. The JavaScript displays 
well on most high-end phones, but the results vary, depending on how 
the device handles JavaScript.

similar to Shadowbox, but it works on sites that don’t have WordPress 
installed. You can also set Visual LightBox to import images from Flickr.
Creating mobile slide shows 
in the 3GP format
 
3GP is the name for files encoded with specifications developed by the 3rd 
Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). The video codec used is pretty much 
the same as MPEG-4; it’s a media container that’s playable on 3G phones, 
although some 2G and 4G phones also play it. Files in this format have the 
.3gp file extension. A version of 3GP exists for CDMA-based phones, dubbed 
3GPP2; files encoded with this standard have the extension .3g2.

When you create slide shows for the mobile platform, use the image-
optimization measures we explain in the earlier section, “Optimizing Images 
for the Mobile Web,” to create folders of photos appropriate for the devices 
you target. Additionally, follow the guidelines in the following section, 
“Optimizing Audio for the Mobile Web,” to encode your audio files so they 
play smoothly on mobile devices. Here are some programs and sites where 
you can create a slide show that plays on anything but the most basic 
feature phones:
 
✓ Animoto: (http://animoto.com) This online service allows you to 
upload photos, choose from themes and fancy transitions, and add 
music from its library. You’re limited to slide shows of only 30 seconds 
in duration unless you pay $30 a year to upgrade to Animoto’s profes-
sional level.

✓ Adobe Premiere Elements: (www.adobe.com/products/premiereel) 
This is the simplest video-editing program that exports to the 3GP format. 
If you’re new to video editing, Premiere Elements has an Instant Movie 
feature that automatically takes your images and adds fancy transitions 
and effects to the presentation. Adobe Premiere Elements costs about 
$80 (although you may find promotions and deals, sometimes packaging 
Premiere and Photoshop Elements together). Adobe Premiere Elements 
8 For Dummies, by Keith Underdahl, can guide you through the basics of 
editing and exporting video in this program.
 
✓ DVD-Photo-Slideshow.com: (www.dvd-photo-slideshow.com) 
This program allows you to easily create slide shows and export them 
to a variety of platforms, including 3GP. This program is specifically 
designed to help you easily create fancy slide shows for a variety of 
distribution platforms, and it includes many transitions and effects, 
although many of them are aimed more toward the family market. A free 
trial is available on the Web site, and the program costs about $60.
 
✓ Adobe After Effects: (www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects) 
This is a rather high-end solution, and many professional media compa-
nies that give presentations use After Effects to make their slide shows 
have that stunning, television-commercial look and feel. After Effects 
exports in 3GP, MP4, and just about any other video format you can 
think of, although the learning curve for this program can be kind of 
steep. The current version of After Effects costs about $999.
Mapping a photo gallery
A fun way to get users more engaged and take advantage of the unique 
powers of the mobile Web is to create a photo gallery in which pictures taken 
with a mobile phone can be uploaded and displayed on a Google map that 
automatically places the photos where they were taken.
You could build all this functionality by hand-coding scripts that take the GPS 
data encoded in the latest digital photos, but Google has already built sites 
and scripts that do this for you for free, so why reinvent the map?
Many mobile sites benefit from including maps, because location is so 
important to mobile users. You can make your maps even more interactive 
and useful by combining them with photos. Whether you’re looking for an 
easy way for you to add photos to your own maps, or you want to open up 
the maps on your site to your online community, combining the power of 
Google’s free Picasa photo-sharing service (see Figure 8-7) with Google Maps 
(as shown in Figure 8-8) is a powerful, easy, and cost-effective option. (Did we 
mention it’s free? All you have to do is sign up for a free Google account.)
Adding photos to maps is a great way to improve the directions on your 
Web site. For example, if you’re creating a site for a restaurant that’s down 

189
 Chapter 8: Using Images and Multimedia in Mobile Designs
some tricky side streets, with a blind entrance from the parking lot, just use 
this process to create a map that potential customers can follow along with 
on their mobile device to show not only where the restaurant is located on 
the map, but also a picture (or a series of pictures) that shows the street-
level view of where customers should park, how best to enter, and any other 
useful details.

If your Web site serves a community, such as a travel club, marathon racers, 
or any other group that likes to share photos, the nifty features at Picasa 
make it easy for anyone to upload photos from a cellphone and automatically 
create photo galleries. If the phone includes geo data (most smartphones 
do), you can add photos automatically to a Google map. Then when your 
travel club members are taking photos out the window on their next road 
trip, everyone on your site can see the photos in real time and track where 
the club members go by following the photos across a map.
If you already have a Gmail account, you’re already signed up for Picasa and 
Google Maps. If you don’t have a Gmail account, sign up for one at http://
picasaweb.google.com before following these steps.
To set up Picasa so that you (and anyone you share your account with) can 
automatically upload photos from a phone, follow these steps. (To then add 
your photos to a map, continue with the instructions in the next section.)
 
1. Log in to your Picasa account with your Google user ID and password 
and then click the Settings link in the upper-right corner.
 
 The User Settings page opens.
 
2. Click the General tab and specify the options you want.
 
 You can set your nickname, upload a profile picture, and change the 
URL for your photo gallery.
 
3. Select the Allow Me check box to upload photos by e-mail.
 
 You must select this check box if you want to send photos directly from 
your phone.
 
4. In the Enter a Secret Word field, type a secret word.
 
 This secret word is used as part of the e-mail address for you or 
your users to send photos to Picasa. The secret word must be 6–15 
characters, and it looks like this when you use it as an e-mail: 
YourName.Secretword@picasaweb.com. You can see the address 
appear below the secret word box while you type it in.
 
 Any photos sent to this e-mail address are published automatically in 
your or your client’s Picasa photo feed. This opens the possibility that 
some prankster could upload objectionable photos, so be careful to use 
a secret word that’s hard to guess and only give this address to people 
you trust.
 
5. Click the Save Changes button and then e-mail a photo from your 
mobile device to the address you generated from Picasa that includes 
the secret word.
 
 The subject line for your e-mail is the headline. Just attach the photo or 
image to the e-mail as you normally would from your mobile phone.

191
 Chapter 8: Using Images and Multimedia in Mobile Designs
If your phone has a newer digital camera with a GPS sensor in it, you can add 
your photos to a Google map by continuing the Picasa setup process with 
these steps:
 
1. Click the My Photos tab in Picasa.
 
 The page with your photo albums opens.
 
2. Click the Drop Box album and then choose Edit➪Album Properties.
 
 The Edit Album Information window opens. You can edit the title and fill 
in a description of the gallery.
 
3. In the Share drop-down list, choose Public and then click the Save 
Changes button.
 
4. On the right side of the screen, right-click the RSS link and choose 
Copy Link Location.
 
5. Open a new tab in your browser and navigate to http://maps.
google.com.
 
 The Google Maps page opens.
 
6. Press Ctrl+C (on a Mac, Command+C) to paste the RSS link into the 
Search Maps field.
 
 This causes little pins to appear on the Google map, and the pins cor-
respond to the places where you took the photos. See Figure 8-8 for an 
idea of how this will display on the map. Clicking a thumbnail brings up 
a larger version of the image, along with the latitude and longitude, the 
title of the photo, and the option to view the photo at full size.
 
7. In the top-right corner of your Google map, click the Link link.
 
 The Link dialog box opens.
 
8. Do either of the following with the code:
 
• Send the link to this map to your friends via e-mail.
 
• Embed code that allows you to add this live map of all the places you 
take photos of to any blog or Web site.
Optimizing Audio for the Mobile Web
Getting sound to come out of your phone seems like a no-brainer, right? 
After all, phones were pretty much designed to play sounds — if they didn’t, 
everyone would walk around shouting into these plastic rectangles for no real 
reason. The key here is that increasingly, phones come with decent-quality 
headsets (or earbuds) that allow users to listen to songs and podcasts in 
stereo. Although the iPhone has definitely accelerated this trend, other mobile 
devices played music long before Apple’s game-changing device hit the market.

192
Part III: Multimedia, Marketing, and E-Commerce 
Most enlightened Web designers know that users get annoyed when you set 
up Web pages to automatically play cheesy 8-bit MIDI songs that sound like 
the soundtrack to an ’80s vintage video game. But there are valid reasons to 
include audio on your mobile Web site. If you haven’t already added audio 
content to the mix on your Web site, here are some possible innovative uses 
for audio that mobile users might want to have at their fingertips — for con-
venience, to pass the time productively, to better answer a question, or to 
solve a crisis situation while they’re away from the home or office:
 
✓ Nature sites could include examples of birdcalls or wild animal noises, 
so birdwatchers can identify birds (or grouchy mama bears) by sound 
when they’re out in the field.
 
✓ A bed-and-breakfast could have a site that provides instructions for 
motorists who are driving, who can’t (and shouldn’t) take their eyes off 
windy country roads to constantly check the small print on a mobile 
screen.
 
✓ A religious site that wants members of the congregation to hear the 
latest sermon, hymns, or meditation.
 
✓ Health sites may want to demonstrate exactly what a dangerous whoop-
ing cough sounds like as opposed to just the flu.
 
✓ Musicians can provide short teaser clips of their works to incentivize 
fans to click to download a higher-quality version.
 
✓ A health and fitness site in which a personal trainer talks users through 
a special workout program that they can follow along with at the gym.
In the following sections, you discover the basics you need to know if you 
want to add audio to your mobile site.
Figuring out formats, file size, and more
As with any other multimedia, the biggest challenge comes from the fact that 
the capabilities, bandwidth, memory, and wireless connection speed are 
uneven and unpredictable across different devices. The good news is that 
unlike so many other multimedia elements, there is one format for audio that 
nearly every device is equipped to play: MP3.
MP3 doesn’t provide the best compression codec (the mathematical formula 
that takes an audio file and reduces its size). In fact, music engineers groan 
and rub their temples when forced to listen to what highly compressed MP3s 
played through tiny speakers sound like. But MP3 is pretty much a universal 
standard just because so many people have used it for so long. Thus, the 
main choice is how much to compress your MP3 to make sure that a mobile 
user can play it?

193
 Chapter 8: Using Images and Multimedia in Mobile Designs
Essentially, you compress an audio file in an audio editor by setting the 
bitrate for the file. Bitrate — a measure of the file’s audio quality — is the 
number of bits of digital information per second that is decoded and turned 
into a sound. In much the same way that reducing color depth in images 
(which we describe earlier in this chapter) represents a tradeoff between 
quality and file size, so too does bitrate work for audio files. Bigger is usually 
better, up to a point. The following explains the differences in bitrate for the 
desktop and mobile Web:
 
✓ On the regular desktop Web, bitrates range from 96 to 320 kbps. 
Professionals consider 96 kbps (kilobits per second, sometimes referred 
to as kbit/s, or even abbreviated to just the capital “K”) adequate for a 
file that contains human speech, such as an interview or monologue. 
Until recently, 128 kbps was considered standard for music, and the 
vast majority of songs sold on iTunes were at this bitrate; however, 
sites like MOG (www.mog.com) are making a name for themselves by 
offering music at 320 kbps or higher for true audiophiles.
 
✓ For the mobile Web, aim for 64 kbps or lower. The giant music-
streaming service Pandora has found that 64 kbps is the highest 
practical bitrate due to bandwidth and dropout constraints.
Streaming audio versus downloads 
versus podcasts
You can enable your mobile user to access your audio files in a few ways:
HE-ACC: Improving on MP3?
Competing audio compression formats, such 
as HE-AAC (High-Efficiency Advanced Audio 
Coding), are emerging. They claim to offer 
the same quality as MP3 at half the file size. 
However, the performance of this standard is 
unpredictable, even on the latest smartphones, 
because to uncompress the audio file, you need 
an extremely fast (for mobile, at least) CPU 
operating at full load capacity.
If you’re absolutely committed to provid-
ing the best possible audio experience at the 
lowest possible file size, you can experiment 
with common audio-ripping software, such as 
Nero (www.nero.com), to encode some of 
your audio files into HE-AAC and then test to 
see whether your targeted mobile devices play 
them under real-world conditions (many manu-
facturers’ claims of compatibility turn out to be 
somewhat, shall we say, overly optimistic). Just 
be aware that the quest for perfect audio fidel-
ity can be a bottomless rabbit hole down which 
many good Web developers have disappeared.

194
Part III: Multimedia, Marketing, and E-Commerce 
 
✓ Streaming audio refers to a process whereby the audio files are trans-
ferred continuously, bit by bit, to the mobile device while the user lis-
tens. The file isn’t saved on the device but is sent to the user every time 
she requests it. This option is the best for low-end feature phones that 
have very little (or no) memory to store files for playback. However, to 
stream audio, you need to clear complicated technical hurdles (which 
we explain in the next section) to ensure that the audio files play as 
promised.
 
✓ Downloadable audio is a file that, not surprisingly, you download and 
then play on your mobile device without being connected to the wire-
less Web.
 
✓ Podcasts are downloadable audio files with a Really Simple Syndication 
(RSS) tag that allows users to subscribe to the podcast so that every epi-
sode of the podcast series downloads automatically. Creating podcasts 
is beyond the scope of this book, but you can find free videos and tips 
for creating podcasts at www.dummies.com. For a more in-depth look 
at podcasting, check out Podcasting For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Tee 
Morris, Chuck Tomasi, Evo Terra, and Kreg Steppe.
Linking to audio files
Providing a link so your visitors can download an audio file is the simplest 
option, especially compared to streaming audio. We recommend linking to 
audio files rather than using the <object> tag, which is more common on 
the desktop Web. Even some of the best designed mobile sites that feature 
audio, including National Public Radio, link to audio files rather than insert-
ing them directly into a Web page.
Linking to audio from a mobile site works the same way it does on a desktop 
Web site: You upload the audio file to a folder on your Web server (or to the 
content-delivery network or CDN that you use). Then you simply insert a link 
to the audio file in any Web page in your site. A link to an audio file looks 
like this:
<a href=”http://www.YourSite.com/audio/YourSong.mp3”> 
Click to play my song!</a><Tip>
The long-awaited HTML5 standard promises to simplify the process of adding 
audio and video to Web pages. Unfortunately, until the HTML5 standard is 
adopted by the majority of mobile devices, we recommend sticking with the 
simplest options for maximum compatibility. If you use device detection and 
content adaptation (see Chapter 6) to direct the users of the latest smart-
phones, then HTML5 is a great option for smartphones, including the iPhone, 
Droid, and a growing list of other devices that support HTML5.

195
 Chapter 8: Using Images and Multimedia in Mobile Designs
 
We strongly discourage any use of the <bgsound> command to play back-
ground music for a mobile Web page. Similarly, using the <object> or 
<embed> tag with the autostart=true command to automatically play an 
audio file upon page load is a real no-no. These commands either cause an 
error or force the mobile user to download the entire audio file to see the con-
tents of your page.
Playing downloadable audio
How audio plays over the mobile Web depends on the device that tries to 
play it. Here’s a quick review of the often uneven results you can expect when 
someone tries to play an MP3 by clicking a link to a song on a mobile phone:
 
✓ The iPhone exits the browser and launches its QuickTime app to play 
the song.
 
✓ Some BlackBerry phones launch BerryTunes or another app or widget 
that handles multimedia. Other BlackBerry phones (including many 
issued by big corporations or government agencies that have imposed 
strict security controls) return an error message.
 
✓ The most recent releases of the Motorola RAZR on the AT&T network 
download the song to the phone and bring up a media player. The 
original Motorola V3 versions on Sprint try to add the song to the ring-
tone library.
 
✓ Depending on the version of Android and the user settings, the phone 
plays the song in a browser, exits to a widget, or prompts the user to 
enable Flash 10.1 to handle multimedia content.
Streaming your audio
If audio is a significant element of your site, you may want to invest in the 
resources to set up your own streaming audio server. Before you start down 
this path, we should warn you this is a technically complex and often expen-
sive option. Here’s what you need to know to get started:
 
✓ Choosing a streaming format: Almost every device plays MP3s, but 
many devices require streaming audio to be delivered in 3GP or MP4 
format. Additionally, field testing has shown that using the audio/3GPP 
format is problematic, and some devices will only play audio that is 
contained in the video/3GPP format. We recommend that you consult 
DeviceAtlas to see if the devices you are targeting support the format 
you want. If you are unsure, you can use the video/3GPP format for 
maximum compatibility, even though the resulting file sizes are some-
what larger.
 
✓ Setting up a streaming server: If you want to consistently stream large 
quantities of audio to your users, you have to set up or have access to 
a streaming media server, such as Darwin Streaming Server (http://
dss.macosforge.org).

196
Part III: Multimedia, Marketing, and E-Commerce 
 
 If you want to get serious about streaming audio to your users, having 
the audio stored on your own server can make a difference in the 
amount of time it takes before the audio loads because the mobile 
device doesn’t have to access two servers — your Web site’s server and 
the server where the audio is hosted. If you can deliver the audio from 
the same server that your Web site is hosted from, it almost always 
plays faster (unless you have a very slow server).
 
✓ Following streaming protocols: You then have to make your files com-
pliant with Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP), which means you have 
to include a hint track with the file during the encoding process to tell 
your server how to package the data so that it flows across the wireless 
connection to the mobile user as seamlessly as possible. You can add 
the hint track when you are encoding with most recording software, or 
even with Apple’s QuickTime Pro.
E-mailing audio files to get around 
mobile problems and restrictions
Before you throw up your hands in frustration and resort to just buying a 
really loud boombox and driving through the streets blasting your audio files 
at top volume to make sure people hear them, we have a simple and elegant 
workaround that not only allows you to deliver audio to users on both their 
desktop and almost any mobile device but also encourages them to register 
and give up some valuable data in exchange.
First, we credit Jonathan Thaler (www.whenimmobile.com) for allowing 
us to share this neat trick with you. Jonathan works with a number of musi-
cians and knows that one of the most important things for a musician is to 
share her latest singles. Here’s how he solved the problem of making it easy 
for anyone with a mobile device to hear the music of his client, singer Tori 
Sparks (www.torisparks.com).
Tori has offered music on her desktop Web site, shown in Figure 8-9, for 
some time, but she wanted to make it easy for fans at her concerts and other 
events to easily get her music — and not have to remember to go visit her 
Web site later.
Because Jonathan designed multiple versions of Tori’s site, optimized for dif-
ferent types of mobile devices, you find more options on some phones than 
others. All the mobile versions of the site include the ability to e-mail a sound 
file. High-end phones, such as the iPhone, also include images and video files 
you can play within the pages of the site (more on how to do that in the 
next section).

197
 Chapter 8: Using Images and Multimedia in Mobile Designs
You can see the mobile version of Tori’s site shown on a BlackBerry phone in 
Figure 8-10. And in Figure 8-11, you see the iPhone version, which has more 
images and video clips hosted by YouTube.

Fans can download an audio file from any of the versions of Tori Sparks’ Web 
site because of the innovative use of an e-mail form on a mobile site. Rather 
than wrestling with all the conflicting standards to make sure that none of her 
fans felt left out, Jonathan worked out an e-mail solution that automatically 
sends an MP3 file to almost any mobile device when a user enters an e-mail 
address into a form. Here’s how it works:
 
1. He set up a simple HTML form with a field for an e-mail address and a 
submit button and connected it to an automated e-mail script on his 
server.
 
 Because HTML form tags are widely supported on mobile devices, fans 
can fill in the form with their e-mail addresses using almost any Web-
enabled mobile phone.
 
2. Fans who enter an e-mail address are sent a message with the music file 
as an attachment.
 
 Sending the MP3 as an attachment to an e-mail message means the song 
isn’t subject to the vagaries of the many mobile browsers. Any phone 
capable of browsing the mobile Web can also send and receive e-mail.

199
 Chapter 8: Using Images and Multimedia in Mobile Designs
 
3. When the message comes in, the users can save the attachment to 
the device.
 
4. To play the file, fans can then exit the e-mail program and use whatever 
MP3 player was installed in the device to play the song.
 
 Again, because MP3s are so popular, every device built in the last five 
years supports them.
 
 Better still, when they get back to their home or office, most of Tori’s 
fans find a copy of the same message waiting in their e-mail inbox, so 
they can also add it to iTunes, Winamp, Windows Media Player, or any 
other audio player they may have on their computer. And, of course, the 
e-mail also contains links so the user can buy more of Tori’s music.
This elegant solution not only makes it easy for Tori to share her music with 
almost anyone who has a mobile phone, it’s also a great excuse to collect 
e-mail addresses, which she uses to promote upcoming shows and merchan-
dise in her store.
To set up a system like the one on Tori’s site — that e-mails a sound file when 
a user enters an e-mail address — do the following:
 
✓ Optimize the audio file so that it downloads quickly. Make sure that 
you abide by the bitrate encoding suggestions in the section “Figuring 
out formats, file size, and more” earlier in this chapter; MP3 files quickly 
reach the multi-megabyte size, and a large download may be blocked by 
the user’s e-mail service.
 
✓ Set up an e-mail form and script that works on your server. Creating 
an HTML form where a user can enter an e-mail address is easy: Use the 
standard HTML form tag, a simple form text field, and a submit button. If 
you’re not familiar with setting up scripts to handle e-mail forms on your 
Web server, you may need to consult with your Web hosting service to 
set up an e-mail form script. Many hosting services include an e-mail 
form script as part of the service, but on some servers you may need to 
install and configure script yourself. Any standard form mail script that 
allows attachments should work; however, beware that most hosting 
services have strict rules about how scripts can be set up on their sys-
tems to prevent malicious users from sending obscene content or spam.
Adding Video to Your Mobile Web Site
Ever since the days of the first portable TVs, video addicts have dreamed 
of ways to watch their favorite shows, no matter where they were. Early 
attempts at this ranged from suitcase-sized monstrosities that weighed as 
much as a small child, to the Sony Watchman with its rabbit-ear antenna that 
required viewers to wrap tinfoil around it and stand in awkward yoga-like 
positions to get good reception.

The advent of so-called “TV anywhere” always seems a few years down the 
road, but the rollout of the high-speed wireless data networks may finally 
bring the dream to reality.
As you might have figured out, video brings together all the most difficult 
challenges of designing for the mobile Web: the plethora of screen resolu-
tions to display the picture on and the large file sizes burdening the digital 
distribution networks. Video professionals who are trying to make the transi-
tion to the mobile space mutter darkly about dense technical specifications 
and toss around phrases like backhaul and data packet prioritization (words 
so obscure we don’t even bother to define them here). And, not to be repeti-
tive, but one of the biggest challenges is that the most popular video format 
on the Web (Flash) isn’t supported on the vast majority of mobile devices.
If we shovel out the reams of data specifications and intricate formatting 
requirements you need to become an expert in creating your custom mobile 
video site, we’d take up the remainder of this book (and probably a couple 
others). Unless you’re part of a dedicated, well-funded team working for 
a large media company, this would probably only confuse the issues and, 
worse yet, would get you no closer to actually delivering video clips to visi-
tors of your Web sites. Therefore, we suggest that (at least to start out) you 
leave the deeply technical issues to people who have already spent years 
working on this problem and concentrate instead on how best to take advan-
tage of the fruits of their labors. In Figure 8-12, you see how the programmers 
at YouTube design video to display on an iPhone. Hosting video on YouTube 
makes it easy because you can simply add a link to the video and YouTube 
delivers the best version for the detected device.
In the following sections, we introduce you to your video-hosting options, 
namely content delivery networks (CDNs) and video-sharing sites. We then 
explain the basics of embedding a video hosted on the video-sharing site 
YouTube into your mobile Web site. And finally, we include a sample of the 
code you can use to embed video directly on your pages if you host the video 
on your own Web server.
Comparing CDNs with video-sharing sites
When you look for a third party to deliver your video content to your mobile 
users, a dedicated content delivery network (CDN) provides high-end services 
for a price. A video-sharing site, such as YouTube, Vimeo, or Viddler, offers 
free or low-cost services.

The essential trade-off between a CDN and a video-sharing site is cost versus 
control. The more you pay, the more you can control the kind of experience 
that your mobile users get. The less you pay (and free is about as less as you 
can get), the more you’re at the mercy of someone else’s decisions. You have 
to weigh the trade-offs, and we encourage you to do your research. To help 
you get started, the following sections provide a comparison of the advan-
tages and disadvantages of each.
Checking out CDNs
Dedicated CDNs offer many advantages:
 
✓ Provide tools for you to customize the player with your own logo or 
messages.
 
✓ Allow you to insert your own advertising, and in some cases, they 
maintain their own ad server so you can customize which ads appear 
depending on the user, time of day, location of user, and so on.

202
Part III: Multimedia, Marketing, and E-Commerce 
 
✓ Maintain their own performance metrics system, so you can track who 
watches your videos, when and where they watch, and all sorts of other 
data useful to you (and advertisers).
 
✓ Provide better customer support; after all, if you’re paying for their ser-
vices, there better be someone there to help if you need it.
 
✓ Allow for batch uploading so that you can publish a collection of videos 
all at once, rather than having to do so one at a time.
 
✓ Offer better copyright protection of your content.
 
✓ Make it possible to restrict which geographic regions or domains are 
allowed to access your videos.
 
✓ Allow you to post videos of any length (within reason).
 
✓ Deliver video in higher quality because CDNs spend more time tinker-
ing with compression algorithms.
Some of the disadvantages of dedicated CDNs:
 
✓ Can be very costly — hosting packages start in the hundreds of dollars 
for 200 gigabytes of videos served per month (about 50 full-length DVDs) 
and rise sharply after that.
 
 Did we mention that CDNs are expensive? If you get a hit viral video, 
your hosting bills can quickly skyrocket into the thousands (or tens 
of thousands) of dollars. That may be fine if you’ve worked out a great 
advertising model or charge for your videos, but if you don’t, this prob-
ably isn’t your best option.
 
✓ Require you to manage social-media aspects of your videos, such as 
sharing, commenting, embedding, and so on.
Hundreds of CDNs are on the market. Some of the most popular are
 
✓ Akamai: www.akamai.com
 
✓ Delve Networks: www.delvenetworks.com
 
✓ Ooyala: www.ooyala.com
 
✓ EdgeCast Networks: www.edgecast.com
 
✓ Limelight Networks: www.limelightnetworks.com
 
✓ Mobile CDN: http://mobilecdn.com
Exploring video-sharing sites
Video-sharing sites offer many advantages:

203
 Chapter 8: Using Images and Multimedia in Mobile Designs
 
✓ Free or at least very cheap when compared with CDNs.
 
✓ Easy to use. If they weren’t, millions of teenagers around the world 
couldn’t share their deeply held convictions that homework is, like, 
totally unfair.
 
✓ Bandwidth costs and concerns are someone else’s problem.
 
✓ Easy to share the content — your users can embed your videos on their 
sites, e-mail friends, leave comments, post to Facebook, and so on.
 
✓ Traffic already comes to these sites, so you don’t have to go out of 
your way to do lots of search engine optimization (SEO) to get your 
video to appear in search engines.
Some of the disadvantages of video-sharing sites:
 
✓ Videos may be delivered with poor quality. Because video-sharing 
sites process many thousands of videos per day, they really can’t pay 
attention to all the details of making your little project look its best.
 
✓ Their ads may appear on your content. If you try to put in your own 
ads or if your video is blatantly commercial, many sites yank it.
 
✓ Your content can be banned or taken down at anytime, for any 
reason, solely at their discretion.
 
✓ After you upload your content to their site, you may no longer be 
the sole owner of the rights to control where, when, and how your 
video is displayed, packaged, advertised, or sold. Read the End User 
Licensing Agreements fully; don’t just agree to it.
 
✓ The length of the videos is limited to what the video-sharing site dic-
tates (usually ten minutes or less).
 
✓ Analytics are limited. You probably don’t get much data to gauge user 
engagement, or to see which sections of a video are the most popular, 
where the audience fast-forwarded, and so on.
 
✓ Because the videos are hosted on someone else’s server, the value of 
the traffic that comes from your site goes to the video-sharing site, not 
yours. Traffic can cost you money because of hosting and bandwidth 
fees, but it can also contribute to higher search engine rankings and 
advertising opportunities.
Among the most popular video-sharing sites:
 
✓ YouTube: www.youtube.com
 
✓ Vimeo: www.vimeo.com
 
✓ Viddler: www.viddler.com

Hosting mobile video on YouTube
For designers who don’t want to struggle too much to figure out whole new 
lexicons of technical specifications, the simplest option is to let YouTube do 
all the work of hosting and delivering video.
Upload a video to this popular Web site, set a link to it on your mobile Web 
page, and you’re all set. YouTube is smart enough to detect your users’ 
devices and deliver videos optimized for their platform. For example, even 
with the mighty iPhone, users with the 3G version get higher-quality videos 
than iPhone 1.0 users because YouTube knows that the first-generation 
iPhones download video much more slowly, and even the most beautiful 
video in the world does no good if the user yanks out his hair while all the 
data tries to fit through a 2G pipe.
Inserting a YouTube video directly 
into a mobile Web page
If you want to take the YouTube video solution to the next level, here’s 
another great tip from Jonathan Thaler. Instead of just linking to YouTube, 
peel out the actual reference to the video from the YouTube page and add 
your own code to insert the video directly into your mobile page. The advan-
tage of this approach is that you don’t have to send users to the YouTube 
site. Although the video is still hosted on YouTube, you can make a video 
play within your mobile page. See Figure 8-13 for an example of videos 
hosted on YouTube that are inserted into a mobile Web page; Figure 8-12 
shows those videos as they appear if you link to them on the YouTube page. 
Inserting videos into your pages works best when designing pages for high-
end mobile devices, such as the iPhone and Droid phones.
To insert a YouTube video directly into your mobile Web page, you need the 
User Agent add-on for Firefox (covered in Chapter 7). The User Agent add-on 
is important because you need to visit the correct page on YouTube — 
the one that’s optimized for your mobile device. The Firefox User Agent 
tricks YouTube into identifying the Firefox Web browser as a mobile device 
(even when you use it on a computer), which makes it possible to view the 
code you need for each type of mobile phone. To find the code you need on 
YouTube, follow these steps:

205
 Chapter 8: Using Images and Multimedia in Mobile Designs
 
Figure 8-13:

eos hosted 
on YouTube

optimized 
Web pages.
 
 
1. Launch Firefox with the User Agent add-on installed.
 
2. Choose Tools➪Default User Agent and then select the device you want 
Firefox to mimic, such as the iPhone.
 
 In Chapter 7, you find instructions for adding user agents for many dif-
ferent devices to the User Agent add-on.
 
3. Open the YouTube page with the video you want to add to your page.
 
 With the user agent activated, YouTube displays a version of the video 
optimized for the device you have selected from the user agent options.
 
4. Right-click (Command-click on a Mac) and chose Properties.

206
Part III: Multimedia, Marketing, and E-Commerce 
 
5. Copy the last string of code, just after the equal (=) sign, from the 
Address field in the Element Properties window, shown in Figure 8-14.
 
 This code corresponds directly to the version of the video that is 
being displayed in your browser. It should look something like this: 
0NesG6e74Jw. (This is the code for a video we took of the Golden Gate 
Bridge. You’re welcome to use it to test this trick yourself.)
 
6. In a Web page editor, such as Dreamweaver, paste the code you 
copied in Step 5 into your Web page using the code we provide in 
Listing 8-1.
If you want to reach the broadest audience, stick with XHTML and use the 
<object>, <param>, and <embed> tags, as we show in Listing 8-1. (If you 
prefer not to type this code, you can copy it from our Web site at www.
DigitalFamily.com/mobile.)
Listing 8-1 shows the code you need in order to insert mobile-optimized 
video from YouTube so that it will play within a mobile Web page.

in the

Properties’

field, you

Inserting video hosted on your 
server into a mobile Web page
If you host your videos on your own Web server, you can insert them into 
a Mobile Web page just as you would insert them into any other Web page 
using the <object>, <param>, and <embed> tags. The trick is to make 
sure you deliver your video in a format that works well on mobile devices, 
and, ideally, you should deliver different versions of each video to differ-
ent devices based on the capabilities of each device. Because getting the 
video into the best format and hosting it on your own server are relatively 
complicated tasks, we recommend that you consider using a CDN or a video 
service like YouTube. However, if you want to host your own video and need 
instructions for inserting video into a Web page using Dreamweaver, you 
will find detailed instructions in Dreamweaver CS5 For Dummies. You can 
also find tutorials on inserting video in the Dreamweaver section at www.
DigitalFamily.com.
Designing your mobile site 
so users watch your video
One of the most common mistakes made by designers jumping into the 
mobile Web is to assume that because designing Web pages that work on 
mobile devices is so different from designing for the desktop Web, the people 
who use these devices must be starting from scratch, too.
If you’re in that camp, picture us clearing our throats, holding up a bullhorn 
and then shouting “WRONG!”
Your users arrive at the mobile Web with a lot of baggage. Anyone who has 
spent time surfing the desktop Web has assumptions and expectations about 

208
Part III: Multimedia, Marketing, and E-Commerce 
how things work and burned fingers from all the bad experiences they’ve 
had. If you’re old enough, you may remember the awful experience common 
to Web surfers in the late ’90s (at least until Microsoft plugged the security 
hole in IE) when unexpected problems frequently arose, such as an unending 
stream of pop-up windows mouse-trapped in your browser, no matter how 
desperately you clicked to close them.
So with video on your mobile Web site, realize that this isn’t the first time 
around the block for your users. They’ve probably watched online videos 
before. They know how the video’s supposed to work; more importantly, 
they know how it’s not supposed to work and what can go wrong. Things 
that are annoying on the desktop Web can become major roadblocks on the 
mobile platform.
Remember, your mobile users are likely to be in a hurry, going in and out of 
cell coverage, or paying by the byte for the data you send them. You need 
to give visitors the confidence that you aren’t going to abuse their trust by 
sending them something massively long, horridly inappropriate, or worse. 
(If you’ve ever had the experience of being Rickrolled — clicking a seemingly 
relevant link that actually takes you to the Rick Astley’s “Never Gonna Give 
You Up” video — you can appreciate why many Web surfers have become 
cautious about clicking video links.)
When you add video to your mobile site, abide by these simple guidelines:
 
✓ Use descriptive text. Make sure that you tell your users what they’re 
going to get if they choose to invest their time and attention in your 
video. On mobile, even a modest length video can take a long time to 
load and play. If your users feel deceived, they aren’t likely to click other 
videos on your site or perhaps come back at all.
 
✓ Make the video easy to play. Clicking an image or title of a video needs 
to make it play. Moving the cursor on tiny mobile screens is hard 
enough; don’t make your users hunt to find the link or control to make 
your video play.
 
✓ Show video length and file size. Related to descriptive text, but impor-
tant enough to warrant its own mention. Be upfront about your content; 
tell your users how long the video runs and how big the file is. Better 
to have them bookmark your page to look at later on a desktop than 
to frustrate them with a sluggish download or infuriate them by eating 
their allowed data transmission for the month.

B
efore we get to the technical details, it’s necessary to take a minute and 
think conceptually about the why before we get all tangled up in the 
how. Specifically. . . .
 
✓ Why would someone want to read your blog on their mobile device, and 
under what circumstances?
 
✓ Why would you want to update your blog using the rudimentary (by 
comparison) keyboard, camera, screen, and data connection of a mobile 
device?
The answer to both questions is the same: because you can do it away from 
the home, office, or home office.
Of course, the next consideration becomes the circumstances that compel 
that kind of interaction versus the more established means of accessing the 
Web. If people are looking at your blog on their phone, fancy design flour-
ishes are obviously not what they’re after. Therefore, the simple plug-ins we 
demonstrate in this chapter will allow you to serve up a stripped-down ver-
sion of your blog specifically for mobile.

210
Part III: Multimedia, Marketing, and E-Commerce 
Streamlining the blog-reading experience to adapt to the mobile platform is 
balanced by immediacy, which is what mobile contributes to blog creation. 
Writing from anywhere, at any time — even live-streaming audio and video 
on some of the new services — means you can share your experiences with 
a global audience in real time. It’s comparable to being the star of your very 
own Truman Show.
We begin this chapter by explaining how to install the dotMobi WordPress 
plug-in. Certainly many other options are available, each specific to the par-
ticular blogging software you use, but because WordPress is the preeminent 
blogging platform, we feature it here.
Additionally, this chapter shows off some of the exciting new tools that allow 
bloggers to break out of the “blogging in your pajamas” stereotype and take 
creating blog posts away from the desktop and into the world. If you like, 
though, you can still wear your pajamas.
Prioritizing Your Blog Features
A hard and fast design rule is “All emphasis is no emphasis.” If you have a 
page full of huge bold type and exclamation points, and everything is flash-
ing and jumping around, what are you really telling your readers? Not much, 
actually, because most sane humans will quickly click away from that kind of 
monstrosity.
When it comes to re-conceptualizing what your blog should look like on the 
mobile platform, you have to apply the rules of mobile Web design with ruth-
less efficiency. Most bloggers, as they grow comfortable with their blogs, 
start collecting widgets, plug-ins, and features that they like.
Bloggers are, by their very nature, like technology magpies. We see some 
new, shiny thing and want to drag it into the nest and play with it for a while. 
Before you know it, the blog’s sidebars are overflowing with code snippets 
that show off the top books you’ve read lately, the countries your blog visi-
tors are from, the tune you’re listening to, and the number of cows you 
milked in the Facebook game Farmville.
On a desktop, this means your readers have to scroll down a bit more to find 
your older posts, or they have a momentary giggle while contemplating the 
dancing bears next to the podcast player.
But on the mobile platform, those sidebar widgets slow down page loads, 
create conflicts with operating systems or handset capabilities, and generally 
just gum up the works.

211
 Chapter 9: Making Your Blog Mobile-Friendly
Similarly, the complex multi-box layouts of some of the more sophisticated 
blogs — the ones that make a blog front page look like the front page of The 
New York Times or ESPN — just don’t translate well to a 2-inch, 128-pixel-wide 
screen — or even to a 4-inch, 320-pixel-wide screen.
We recommend that you take a few minutes to think strategically about 
your blog and what you really want people to see when they access it from 
a mobile device. Table 9-1 offers suggestions, based on some of the most 
common blog subjects.

Adding the dotMobi Plug-in 
to Your WordPress Blog
Obviously, designing a plug-in that functions with every blog’s style and 
configuration is impossible. There are just too many variations on the basic 
themes of WordPress for any one-size solution to fit all.
However, the dotMobi plug-in transforms most standard blogs in the follow-
ing ways:
 
✓ Simplifies the banner and color scheme. Large images or rich media 
content in banners slows down page loading.
 
✓ Stacks headlines in a long row. Mobile users like to zip up and down 
through easy-to-grasp headlines, rather than the traditional blog format, 
where posts can make pages scroll through six or seven screen-lengths.
 
✓ Moves sidebars to the bottom of the page. Because most mobile 
screens are still narrow, having content appear on the sides means 
either things get squeezed and unreadable, or the users have to scroll 
side-to-side as well.
After you install the dotMobi plug-in, you can adjust several settings so that 
your blog and its contents display as logically and attractively as possible. 

213
 Chapter 9: Making Your Blog Mobile-Friendly
Although we cannot anticipate every situation or need, the following sections 
should get you started on “mobilizing” your blog so that you can test and

Installing the dotMobi plug-in
The steps in this section walk you through the process of installing the dot-
Mobi plug-in on your WordPress blog.
 
One risk of installing complex plug-ins, including the dotMobi pack, is that 
when WordPress periodically updates its software, the update sometimes con-
flicts with your plug-ins. If this happens, you may have to deactivate or unin-
stall the plug-in until it is updated as well.
Now that you know what the gotchas are, you’re prepared to look out for 
them and are ready to install the plug-in as follows:
 
1. Open a new tab in your browser and navigate to http://wordpress.
org/extend/plugins/wordpress-mobile-pack.
 
 The WordPress Mobile Pack page appears, as shown in Figure 9-2.
 
Figure 9-2: 
WordPress 
Mobile Pack 
page in 
the Plugin 
Directory of 
WordPress.
org.
 
What’s a plug-in?
A plug-in is a software package that you add 
to your blog so your blog can do things beyond 
the capabilities in the basic installation. Plug-
ins allow your blog to have long comment 
threads and fight off spammers, or let your 
users give five-star ratings to your blog posts 
and then share them on Twitter, Digg, Reddit, 
or Facebook.
Thousands of WordPress plug-ins can be found 
at http://wordpress.org/extend/
plugins. You can spend hours browsing 
the myriad ways that programmers around the 
world have tried to customize the functions of 
your blog; if you have any PHP programming 
skills, you might even come up with some new 
ways on your own.

2. Click the Download button on the right of the WordPress Mobile Pack 
page (not the Download button in the WordPress.org header at the 
very top right).
 
3. In the window that appears, choose where you want to save the Zip 
file containing the WordPress Mobile Pack plug-in. Click Save to 
download the file.
 
4. Log in to your WordPress blog, and click Plugins on the sidebar on 
the left of the page.
 
5. On the drop-down menu that appears, choose Add New.
 
 The Install Plugins page appears, as shown in Figure 9-3. This page is 
very useful for WordPress bloggers; you can use it to browse all kinds of 
plug-ins. The tag cloud in the center of the page gives you a snapshot of 
the most popular plug-ins that bloggers are searching for and using. This 
page is also where you upload plug-ins you want to add to your blog.

8. Navigate to where you just saved the WordPress Mobile Pack Zip file. 
Select it and then click the Open button.
 
9. Click the Install Now button.
 
 Your computer automatically uploads the plug-in to the proper direc-
tory in your WordPress blog and unzips the contents of the file.
 
10. Click the Return to Plugins Page link.
 
 The Manage Plugins page opens.
 
11. Click the Activate link under WordPress Mobile Pack.
 
 Your blog activates the plug-in and Plugin Activated appears at the top of 
the page. If there is a conflict between this plug-in and one of your other 
plug-ins, or with your blog’s theme, you receive an error message. If this 
happens, you have to troubleshoot by systematically deactivating and 
reactivating the conflicting plug-ins or features of your blog.
 
You can shortcut this process by navigating to the plug-in directory of 
WordPress and searching for the Mobile Pack plug-in there. Unfortunately, 
whenever a plug-in gets popular, there are always spammers and scammers 
who try to piggyback on the plug-in’s success by putting out copycat versions 
that can damage your blog — or worse. These copycat versions are often 
variations on the spelling or word order of the original plug-in, and they can 
be hard to spot. If you do choose to install the Mobile Pack using the one-click 
method, be sure that you have researched this thoroughly, and that you’re 
getting what you expect.
At this point, you can sit back and let the automatically selected settings take 
over and determine how your blog will look on mobile devices, or you can dig 
a little deeper into the various settings to try to customize the look. We lead 
you through some of the options in the upcoming sections. You don’t have to 
know any real computer programming to adjust these options, although you 
have to invest some time and effort in testing the various settings.
If you have some PHP and CSS skills, you can really take matters into your 
own hands and edit the various files to totally customize how this plug-in 
makes your blog look.
Tweaking the mobile switcher
With the dotMobi plug-in installed, the first thing that a mobile browser 
encounters when it tries to access your blog is the mobile switcher. Before 
we get into customizing how this nifty bit of code works, here’s a brief expla-
nation: The mobile switching agent tells the mobile browser to ignore all the 
files on how to format the blog’s content for the desktop environment and to 
use the coding in the WordPress Mobile Plugin pack to filter the content. For 
more on mobile switchers, see Chapter 2. Here’s how to adjust the settings:

3. Scroll to the WordPress Mobile Pack plug-in and click the Switcher link.
 
 Alternatively, you can access the Mobile Switcher by selecting it from 
the Appearance tab, as shown in Figure 9-4.
 
 The Mobile Switcher page opens, as shown in Figure 9-4. This page con-
tains various drop-down menus you can use to adjust the settings.
 
Figure 9-4: 
The Mobile 
Switcher 
page 
allows you 
to control 
what mobile 
users see 
on your site.
 
 
4. On the Switcher Mode drop-down menu, choose from the following 
options:
 
• Disabled: Choose this when you want there to be no switching, per-
haps because you have a site that is designed to be seen only on 
mobile devices.
 
• Browser Detection: When users access your blog, their browser 
sends a little information to your server, telling it what kind of 
browser and operating system is making the request. Think of it 
like a polite guest knocking on your door and announcing who 
they are. This mode is pretty effective, although very new or non-
standard browsers may not be recognized; therefore, the users 
would be sent to your desktop site. (To guard against that kind of 
error, see Step 9).

Part III: Multimedia, Marketing, and E-Commerce 
 
• Domain Mapping: This identifies whether the visitor to your blog 
is trying to access a mobile domain (say m.slightlyusedcats.
com, slightlyusedcats.com/m/, or slightlyusedcats.
mobi) or just the regular desktop site. This is quite effective if your 
users are typing in the complete address. However, it requires that 
you create a completely separate mobile site at that address.
 
• Both Browser Detection and Domain Mapping: The advantage of 
using this setting is that it covers almost all possible mobile user 
access scenarios and flashes a warning message when your user 
tries to access the mobile site through a desktop browser or 
vice-versa.
 
5. On the Mobile Theme drop-down, choose which theme you want your 
mobile users to see.
 
 The defaults are limited to the base color scheme, as well as blue, green, 
or red. If you customize and save a mobile theme of your own, it appears 
here, too.
 
6. On the Browser Detection drop-down menu, choose User-Agent 
Prefixes if you like.
 
 This drop-down menu is available only when you choose Browser 
Detection or Both Browser Detection and Domain Mapping in Step 4, 
because if you’re not using Browser Detection, the choices here will not 
be available.
 
 As we write this book, the only option here is User-Agent Prefixes. 
However, updates to this mobile pack may provide more options.
 
7. In the Desktop Domains box, change the text only if you have a com-
plicated or custom-built site.
 
 The default is your primary Web address where users hitting your site 
from traditional desktop or laptop computers are sent. If you don’t know 
what you’re doing here, leave it alone.
 
8. In the Mobile Domains box, enter the names of any custom mobile 
domains you’ve created.
 
 As we mention in Step 4, you can create a completely different site at an 
m.whatever.com or whatever.mobi domain. However, just filling in 
a variation of your existing domain address does not magically create 
this site. Creating subdomains like these requires a fair amount of spe-
cialized knowledge and access to server-level functions that not all Web 
hosts offer.
 
9. (Optional) Select the Footer Links check box to allow your users to 
override the mobile switcher.
 
 This places a link on the bottom of the page that allows users to defeat 
the switcher in case it sends a desktop user to a mobile page, or vice-
versa. If you’re confident in the switcher and want to save space on your 
page, don’t include the link, but most people choose to just in case.

219
 Chapter 9: Making Your Blog Mobile-Friendly
 
 Allow your users to choose which version of your blog they want to see; 
maybe a desktop user is on a particularly slow connection and just 
wants to access the simplest version of your site.
 
10. Click the Save Changes button when you are done.
Customizing your mobile theme
Although you can choose the basic color scheme of the existing mobile 
themes when you configure the mobile switcher (see the preceding section), 
the Mobile Theme page allows you to further customize what your mobile 
users see when they access your blog.
 
1. Open a browser and navigate to your WordPress blog’s Dashboard.
 
2. Click Plugins on the left sidebar.
 
 The Manage Plugins page appears.
 
3. Scroll to the WordPress Mobile Pack plug-in and click the Themes link.
 
 Alternatively, you can click on the Mobile Theme link under the 
Appearance tab, as shown in Figure 9-5.
 
 The Mobile Theme page opens, as shown in Figure 9-5. This page con-
tains various drop-down menus you can use to adjust the settings.

4. Ensure the Enable Nokia Templates option is selected (checked).
 
 Despite all the hype about smartphones, such as the iPhone or Droid, 
Nokia handsets are still the most popular in the world, especially in 
developing nations.
 
5. If you have a dedicated page, deselect the Show Home Link in Menu 
check box.
 
 If you have a dedicated home page for your blog (such as a big picture, a 
video, or an animation), you want to deselect this check box. Otherwise 
the plug-in places two Home links on your mobile page. If you do not 
have a dedicated home page, leave this check box selected. 
 
6. Choose the number of posts to display on your home page or 
archive page.
 
 The default is five. If you want your blog to load quicker, type a smaller 
number. If you want your readers to see more items and aren’t worried 
about load times (or believe that your readers mostly have fast phones 
or a lot of patience), then increase the number. Experiment with this set-
ting until you are happy with how your blog downloads and displays in a 
browser.
 
7. On the Lists of Posts Show drop-down menu, choose one of the follow-
ing options:
 
a. Title Only causes the mobile version of your blog to display only 
the title of your blog posts. Again, this is a tradeoff between detail 
and loading speed.
 
b. Title and Teaser for the First Post, Title for the Rest is a good com-
promise setting. Your readers see the title of your most recent 
post and the first few words of the post; after that, readers just see 
the headlines.
 
c. Title and Teaser for All Posts displays as much information as possi-
ble to get your readers to click through to the full posts. Of course, 
having this setting selected means that the pages load slower. 
Your readers may get frustrated and abandon your blog.
 
8. Select the Display Metadata for Posts option if you want to display 
additional information about your posts.
 
 If you choose this, each post also shows the name of the author and any 
tags you’ve chosen.
 
9. Choose the teaser length (if any).
 
 The default is 50 characters. If you want a longer teaser, type a larger 
number. Again, this is something you should experiment with.
 
10. Type the number of widget items you want to display.
 
 The default is five. Your widgets will not display in a sidebar on your 
mobile blog; instead, they appear in a bar at the bottom of the page. If 

221
 Chapter 9: Making Your Blog Mobile-Friendly
your widget has a lot of information in it, only a short teaser and a link 
to the full list will appear.
 
11. Select the Remove Media option if you want remove all rich media 
content from on your blog.
 
 Depending on what you blog about, this can be one of the most crucial 
decisions you make. If you use a lot of multimedia in your blog posts, 
then removing all your audio, video, or Flash files may leave you with 
little content to offer mobile visitors. However, if you mostly post text 
and photos on your site and occasionally have audio, video, or Flash, 
removing these elements may be in your best interest. Rich media ele-
ments are usually large in size; users may not want to wait around — 
or burn up their limited data plans — waiting for your home page to 
download. When you choose to remove media, the plug-in removes the 
object, embed, marquee, script, frame, and iframe HTML tags and their 
content. 
 
12. Select the Partition Large Pages option to break up your content into 
bite-size pieces.
 
 If you tend to write long posts (if your post requires the user to scroll 
through more than four screens of content, it’s long), you might want 
to give your audience a break with this option. If, however, you want 
people to load only one page at a time and avoid clicking repeatedly to 
load page after page, then leave this check box deselected.
 
13. Select the Shrink Images option to resize your pictures to fit on mobile 
screens.
 
 Shrinking images might not be a good idea in some circumstances. If 
you are a photographer and are afraid that the resizing engine in this 
plug-in might add noise or distortion to your photos, or you prefer to 
handle the resizing yourself, leave Shrink Images unchecked. Otherwise, 
it doesn’t make much sense to have a poster-resolution image on a post-
age-stamp-size screen.
 
14. Select the Clear Cache Now option if you want to ensure that the 
resized images are the ones that appear for mobile users.
 
 Sometimes, WordPress caches images locally so that it doesn’t have 
to keep going into the database to retrieve them. If you chose to resize 
images, but haven’t cleared the cache, your blog could continue to 
deliver the large image files.
 
15. Select the Simplify Styling option.
 
 This removes any little flourishes that have crept into your posts and 
pages, such as having ornate initial capital letters or having unique 
styles as frames around pictures. On the mobile Web, these kinds of 
elements are referred to as “drag,” as in “All the fancy typography and 
design on that blog are dragging it down like an anchor thrown into bot-
tomless quicksand.”

16. Click Save Changes when you are done customizing your settings.
 
 Call up your blog on your mobile device to see what your changes have 
done to your blog’s appearance.
Choosing which widgets to display
If you’re a blogger, you’ve probably added a widget or two (or ten). When 
you set up your WordPress blog for the mobile Web using the dotMobi plug-
in, here’s how to display widgets for your readers:
 
1. Open a browser and navigate to your WordPress blog’s Dashboard.
 
2. Click Plugins on the left sidebar.
 
 The Manage Plugins page appears.
 
3. Scroll to the WordPress Mobile Pack plug-in and click the Mobile 
Widgets link.
 
 The Mobile Widgets page appears, as shown in Figure 9-6. This page con-
tains various check boxes that allow you to winnow your widgets to just 
the ones that are absolutely essential to your blog. You can enable your 
widgets on the regular Widgets page, where you can drag and drop the 
elements to add, subtract, or re-order the content.
 
Figure 9-6: 
The Mobile

223
 Chapter 9: Making Your Blog Mobile-Friendly
 
4. Select which widgets you want to appear on the mobile version of 
your blog.
 
 Accepted wisdom is that no more than three widgets should load when 
you hit a mobile page. (Purists say anything more than three is pushing 
it.) Consider carefully what information absolutely, positively has to be 
on your mobile blog. Widgets for stock tickers, Twitter feeds, Flickr slide 
shows, or MP3 players can severely clog page load times. Keep widgets 
to things like your About page or Recent Posts.
 
5. Click the Save Changes button.
Blogging from a Mobile Device
As mobile devices increasingly include full alphanumeric (“QWERTY,” for the 
letters on the top row) keypads, users are taking advantage. Before, typing 
a post with a telephone keypad, where you had to push the 9 key four times 
to enter a Z, was something only die-hard bloggers with fast and muscular 
thumbs dared to try.
You have dozens of ways to post to your blog from mobile devices; the vari-
ous App Stores are overflowing with custom-built tools to empower bloggers 
to capture every waking second of their lives in words, pictures, and video. 
We encourage you to check these apps out (if your mobile device supports 
downloaded apps) and see whether any of them suit your needs.
However, if you don’t want to tie your blogging future to the whims of an 
App developer, some free and easy tools enable you to add and update posts 
using the most basic skills and setup — namely mobile blogging via e-mail.
In only 20 years, e-mail has become so ubiquitous; it seems that every life 
form on the evolutionary scale higher than an amoeba has a Gmail account. 
One of the strengths of blogging is that refreshing a Web page is (almost) as 
easy as typing an e-mail message and attaching a file. Well, that last step has 
been bridged by updates to blogging software that allow blogs to take incom-
ing e-mails and turn them into blog posts. Admittedly, sending an e-mail does 
not allow you to format the post with precision or to preview it to see how it 
looks — but it gets the content into your blog immediately from any device 
that is capable of sending an e-mail.
In the sections that follow, we explain how you set up a WordPress blog 
to accept blog posts via e-mail. If you use a blogging platform other than 
WordPress (such as Blogger or TypePad), the specific steps you follow will 
vary but the basic idea is the same.

224
Part III: Multimedia, Marketing, and E-Commerce 
With the addition of audio recording, cameras that take up to 8 megapixel 
images, and even video recording, bloggers now have a cornucopia of tools 
at their disposal. If you want to use photo-sharing services, such as Picasa, 
to construct geotagged maps showing the exact locations of the pictures you 
take, or use live streaming sites, such as Ustream or Kyte, to be your own 
broadcast network, flip to Chapter 8. This section focuses only on text posts.
Creating a secret e-mail address
Before you start blogging via e-mail, you have to create a unique e-mail 
address to send your blog posts to. The creation process will vary depend-
ing on the way your Web hosting service or e-mail is set up. Essentially, you 
can use any e-mail address, but there are significant risks to doing this with a 
Gmail, Hotmail, or Yahoo! account because so many spammers and noxious 
advertisers randomly blanket every possible address with messages that 
would then wind up as content on your blog.
 
Don’t use your regular e-mail address. All the e-mail you get in your Inbox 
daily (including secret love notes or chain letters from your crazy uncle) posts 
automatically and immediately to your blog. WordPress recommends you 
create a really obscure e-mail address (see the examples below) and keep this 
e-mail address as secret as possible. If it gets out in the open, spammers can 
then hijack your blog by sending whatever noxious material they want to that 
Inbox, and your blog will automatically post it.
So before you start down this path, make sure that you have a safe and 
secure e-mail address that is dedicated only to receiving e-mails that will 
then be converted into blog posts. You can share this e-mail address with 
(very) trusted friends, say a group on a vacation or at a big concert, so they 
can post their impressions to your blog as quickly and easily as possible.
To make your special blogging e-mail address safe and secure, WordPress 
prompts you to use semi-random strings of letters and numbers, such as 
4lrp59qs@yourmail.com. Since nobody sane has a name like 4lrp59qs, the 
automated programs that spammers use to guess common names won’t hit 
upon this combination for their unwanted messages.
Converting e-mails into WordPress posts
Here’s how to set up your WordPress blog to accept your e-mails and turn 
them into content:
 
1. Open a browser and navigate to your WordPress blog’s Dashboard.
 
2. Click Settings on the left sidebar.

225
 Chapter 9: Making Your Blog Mobile-Friendly
 
 Depending on how you have set up your own blog, your Settings tab 
may be in a different location, such as at the bottom of the sidebar.
 
3. Click the Writing link.
 
 The Writing Settings page opens, as shown in Figure 9-7. This page 
enables you to adjust many of the settings for creating new posts. Skip 
the first two sections because they have nothing to do with creating 
posts via e-mail; make changes to them only if you know what you are 
doing.
 
 Under the Post via E-Mail heading is a paragraph containing three sug-
gested “random strings,” which look like this: 23anir8r2c. These are for 
you to use as usernames to send your blog posts to. That is, you send 
your e-mails to 23anir8r2c@yourdomain.com and they automatically 
publish.
 
4. Enter the mail server for your e-mail account.
 
 If you have your own self-hosted WordPress blog, the mail server will 
probably look similar to mail.yourblogname.com.
 
5. Enter the secret e-mail address in the Login Name box. 
 
6. Enter the password you established for this e-mail account.
 
7. Choose a category from the Default Mail Category drop-down menu.
 
 If you want the posts from your mobile device to go into a special cat-
egory (such as Out and About), you would choose that here.
 
8. Click Save Changes.

Blogging on the mobile Web: 
An interview with Doc Searls
Doc Searls — alpha blogger and co-author 
of “The Cluetrain Manifesto” — is one of the 
guys who was around when the Internet was 
created, and who had a real hand in shaping 
and giving voice to its emerging culture. He is 
a firm believer in the righteousness of open-
source technology, the wisdom of the crowd, 
the promise of many-to-many communication, 
and taking pictures out of airplane windows.
Searls has made it his life’s work to study the 
implications of the many-to-many information 
flow that blogging makes possible (see his blog 
shown in the figure). His long-term insights on 
where blogging is headed, now that it can be 
created and consumer anywhere, are essential 
to any blogger hoping to make the transition to 
the mobile platform.
Q: Migrating blogs to function on the mobile 
platform seems to run headlong into a whole 
bunch of conflicting considerations; are any of 
the following guidelines (culled from “expert” 
advice) accurate, and if so, to what extent?
Before we go there, it’s important to note that 
WordPress, Drupal, and other popular author-
ing systems are not yet optimized for mobile 
[Ed. Note: Besides the plug-in demonstrated in 
this chapter, which helps optimize the theme 
for a blog]. This is bound to change, but soon 
isn’t fast enough. I think the presence of the 
iPad in the world will help. Authors will soon be 
writing, consciously, for three sizes of screens: 
desktop/laptop, tablet, and smartphone.
Meanwhile, the best format for mobile is plain 
HTML. This is what Dave Winer does with his 
news rivers. I keep a bookmark for http://
nytimesriver.com in my iPhone browser 
because it loads instantly, and looks great — if 
what you’re trying to do is actually read.

227
 Chapter 9: Making Your Blog Mobile-Friendly
Sometimes simpler is better. This is especially 
the case when space and processing power 
are limited, as they are with mobile devices. 
The same goes for streaming. The streaming 
equivalent of a 50,000-watt radio station is a 24 
Kbps stream: the lowest useful bit rate. That’s 
because you can receive it with GPRS (Edge) 
and not just 3G and Wi-Fi.
The problem at the moment is that designers 
want to fancy things up, which is only natural. 
They want pretty Web sites, sparkling audio, 
and high-resolution video because those things 
flatter their work and align with their ideals. 
But, in the real world, those ideals are often at 
odds with actual use. In the long run, this con-
flict sorts out because we get both the pretty 
and the practical. But, right now, we’re in a tug 
between them, and the designers are winning.
Perspective: It’s only 15 years since the first 
popular graphical browser came along, and 
the commercial Web (Amazon, eBay, and so on) 
followed. The ’Net is still young. It’s a sopho-
more in high school, not even old enough to get 
its driving permit. So, some patience is required, 
along with as much innovation as we can stand.
 ✓ Bloggers have to write even shorter, pithier 
pieces because the readers are on the 
move.
 
 I don’t agree. Years ago people said blog-
ging should be short-form, yet long-form 
blogs often did better than the short kind. 
The trick is to make them easy to read. 
People tweet and re-tweet most of my blog 
posts, and nearly all those posts are hun-
dreds or even thousands of words long.
 ✓ Bloggers need to make sure they have 
longer content available, because readers 
are sometimes killing time and are willing to 
drill down deep.
 
 That’s true. I sometimes go to a long blog 
post before I get on the train and then read 
it underground, on my iPhone.
 ✓ It’s essential to have good-looking multime-
dia content to take advantage of the new 
smartphones that play video so well.
 
 No. You need interesting material. Good 
beats fancy every time. This is not to say 
that multimedia is bad, just that it won’t be 
the only thing. TV didn’t obsolete text. Nor 
will smartphones.
 ✓ Multimedia content has to be stripped out 
because of the still-shaky data connections 
and the whole Flash controversy.
 
 Well, it needs to be optional — grace-
fully added and subtracted as bandwidth 
requires.
 ✓ People are searching for immediate, useful 
information on their mobiles.
 
 Of course. In fact, in the long run people will 
be publishing their own demand selectively 
to markets on the fly — “I need a stroller for 
twins in White Plains in the next two hours. 
Who’s coming through?” — without having 
to do that within the silos of eBay, Amazon, 
or Craigslist. (And this isn’t a knock on 
those. Just an observation that we need an 
open marketplace as well as these closed 
ones.)
Q: Facebook’s growth on mobile has been 
absolutely shocking — 600 percent last year.
Thank a killer — and very simple — Facebook 
iPhone app.
Q: Does this qualify as blogging?
No. Facebook is still a closed and private 
silo — or a giant walled garden. In this respect, 
it is still AOL 2.0.
Q: Is this kind of growth going to continue? Or 
are we going to get sick and tired of playing 
in Zuckerberg’s garden and head off to more 
bespoke social communities?
We’ll always head back in an open direction, 
away from beautiful but limited closed spaces.
(continued)

228
Part III: Multimedia, Marketing, and E-Commerce 
There is a market ecosystem at work here. 
We have the Facebooks and Apples creating 
vertical apps and devices that create new cat-
egories (or vastly improve old ones) and show 
much of what can be done there. Then we have 
the Googles and open-source communities 
working horizontally, doing openly what closed 
systems prevent.
Q: You once described being an “alpha blog-
ger” as being akin to being an “alpha parame-
cium.” Does that make an alpha mobile blogger 
an alpha virus? Or a paramecium with legs?
The latter, I suppose.
What I meant there was that blogging is essentially 
a personal act: a one-man or one-woman show. It 
is social in the way all of us are social — humans 
are social animals — but it is not a collective 
activity.
Humans are also mobile animals, and phones 
are far more popular than computers for a good 
reason: They’re more personal, more conversa-
tional, and you can carry them in your pocket.
The problem with blogging is that it is essen-
tially a text activity. Given the difficulty of writ-
ing while walking or driving, blogging is likely to 
remain mostly a sitting-still activity as well. But 
there are endless possibilities here: speech-to-
text, audio and video postings, mashing up work 
by other people. . . .
Q: Is being able to file live reports from out 
in the field such a big deal? Outside of a few 
high-profile successes, is this really that big 
of a selling point for a blogger?
The appeal of photography and video is that 
there’s no limit to what you can do with them. 
Few of us imagine we’ll be filing live reports, but 
knowing we can is not a trivial consideration. 
Most of us don’t expect to be dialing 911 either, 
but knowing we can is a good thing.
Q: How often do you read blogs on your mobile?
Every day, usually several times a day.
Q: Under what circumstances and what are 
you looking for?
Usually, I’m following links in tweets, simply 
because they’re interesting to me.
Q: What do you think is going to be a big 
growth area in mobile blogging over the next 
couple of years? What’s going to take off that’s 
just started getting traction?
The biggest thing will be video. The ability of 
anybody to upload, mash up, and edit video is 
going to put a big stress on existing systems, 
which are built with a bias for bandwidth in the 
downstream direction. This stress can break 
in one or both of two ways. One is resistance 
from the carriers, which would rather persist 
in their few-to-many entertainment industry 
dreams (TV moving to the ’Net, and available 
only to subscribers). The other is carriers (and 
other parties, such as municipal fiber systems) 
embracing users as producers and a wide-
open marketplace where everybody can supply 
ideas and content to everybody else. There is 
far more economic vitality in the latter than the 
former.
Q: What is on your wish list? Is it an actual 
established business model for content 
creators?
That’s one of them. See EmanciPay at 
http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/
projectvrm/EmanciPay.
Also,
 ✓ Grass-roots growth of municipal and 
regional broadband utilities — rising tides 
that lift all boats.
 ✓ Preservation of the ’Net as an open, 
simple, end-to-end style system that’s NEA: 
Nobody owns it, Everybody can use it, and 
Anybody can improve it.
 ✓ Success of open mobile devices running 
on Android, Symbian, and other operating 
systems that no one company controls.

 ✓ Evolution of journalism from the exclusive 
province of the few into the standard prac-
tice of the many — with a sense or moral 
purpose and balance and purpose in the 
course of it. For a little on that, see my post

edu/doc/2010/04/21/write-
and-wrong.
I could go on, but that’s probably more than 
enough.

it’s possible for people with a compelling mes-
sage to make up a revenue stream on the fly?
Well, it’s that too.

T
he only phone advertising you used to have to think about was the pesky 
telemarketers calling you right when you sat down to dinner. These days, 
advertising can be beamed to that device in your pocket wherever you go, 
whenever advertisers want to reach you. But before you chuck your phone 
into the nearest landfill, remember that you’re probably reading this book 
because you’re interested in having a mobile Web site of your own and that 
you want people to come and see what you’ve poured so much time and 
energy into.
Getting page traffic is a complex subject, one that has fueled innumerable 
books, Web sites, seminars, and blog posts. One of the most basic ways is to 
use advertising to make people aware that your site exists and to give them a 
reason to come there.
Of course, another reason to know about mobile advertising is that you’re 
a content publisher and you want your stories, photos, videos, or songs 
to earn some money. Sure, you can do this by selling subscriptions (see 
Chapter 11, which is all about e-commerce), but adding advertising to your 
mobile site is a growing revenue stream.

232
Part III: Multimedia, Marketing, and E-Commerce 
Finally, if your mobile site is part of your overall business, and the whole 
point of all this is to get people to come to your restaurant, book a vacation, 
or buy your custom-painted T-shirts, you will most certainly want to start 
using mobile advertising.
In this chapter, we look at some early mobile marketing success stories and 
demonstrate how you can launch your own custom campaign using free or 
low-cost tools.
Understanding Mobile’s Advertising 
Advantage
At first glance, advertising on mobile devices seems to be a losing game. The 
screens are tiny fractions of a proper flat screen TV, the connection to the 
Internet is far more tenuous than a cable modem or DSL line, and typing on 
the itty-bitty keyboards is comfortable only for leprechauns. However, the 
reality is that the mobile Web offers important advantages:
 
✓ People take their mobile phones with them wherever they go. Studies 
show that when you leave your phone behind in a restaurant, you prob-
ably realize it within an hour or two; however, most people take about 
a day to realize they’ve left their wallet with their ID, cash, and credit 
cards behind. This is how integral mobile phones are in people’s lives.
 
✓ Mobile phones offer one of the few times in modern life when you 
have the audience’s undivided attention. Think of the environment that 
most advertising gets tossed into, to sink or swim. The average teen-
ager’s room has a TV that she flips through channels on, a radio blaring, 
a laptop open to Facebook while instant messaging, glossy magazines 
open on the bed, and a video game console blasting aliens. Good luck 
breaking through that chaos.
 
 In contrast, when that same teenager is on the bus to school, what does 
she do? She cocoons with her media — that is, she sits down, pulls out 
her mobile phone or media player, puts headphones in her ears, and 
plays music or a video. Even in busy and crowded environments, where 
visitors to your site may be distracted, researchers say that having 
the media player in her hand creates a special state of connection 
and concentration.
 
✓ People trust content delivered via their mobile devices. According to 
mobile marketing experts, that trust is built up from hearing your mom’s 
voice come out of the device or relying on it to reach 911 when you wit-
ness a car accident.

233
 Chapter 10: Mobile Marketing and Social Media
 
 That trust translates into a much better chance that your marketing 
message actually gets through. But don’t just take that at face value; 
early research shows that, when done properly and integrated with 
other media, mobile advertising yields a return on investment that’s sur-
prising even seasoned advertising executives — a point we illustrate in 
the section, “Assessing the Impact of Mobile Advertising.”
 
✓ Mobile devices increasingly come with GPS built in. With GPS, your 
mobile phone knows where you are (and can tell you where to go 
when you get lost). This also means that advertising can take advan-
tage of that data to put in ads that are even more effective because 
of relevance — the advertising message reaches potential customers 
wherever they are. For example, a woman walks down a busy street 
when her phone suddenly lights up with a coupon for 20 percent off at 
the Starbucks up the block.
 
 Similarly, restaurants can send mobile alerts at 11 a.m. on workdays to 
their most loyal customers (that is, those who have signed up to receive 
alerts and offers), inviting them to try the business lunch specials. The 
Pittsburgh Penguins hockey team started using mobile ads to alert rabid 
fans within a 10-mile radius of the rink that last-minute tickets had just 
become available, if fans could make it to through traffic in time to 
claim them.
 
 Targeting your ads to appear where and when your customers need 
them transforms them from intrusive spam that everyone grumbles 
about into a useful service that solves a need. For instance, you might be 
glad to know
 
• Where the nearest tire repair shop is when your car blows a tire on 
the way to work
 
• Who can help you get a red wine stain out of a cashmere sweater 
before the stain sets in
 
• Where the nearest place is to get a refill on your allergy medication 
before you wind up in the hospital
 
Of course, this kind of targeting raises all kinds of privacy concerns, which is 
why so many mobile advertising practitioners talk about opt-in marketing cam-
paigns. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the major cell-
phone carriers (AT&T, Verizon, and Sprint) constantly work on establishing 
the rules and regulations for mobile advertising. Violations of the FCC rules 
can get you banned by the carriers, fined, or worse by the FCC. You can find 
an example of the codes of conduct at http://mmaglobal.com/codeof
conduct.pdf.
In the upcoming sections, we take a look at what kinds of ads you need to 
check with your audience before you send them.

Checking Out the Types of Mobile Ads
Because the mobile Web has unique attributes and advantages, as we explain 
in the preceding section, mobile advertising sometimes works differently 
than traditional ads you see in print, on TV, or online. Here’s a brief introduc-
tion to the most common types of ads, which you can explore in more detail 
later in this chapter:
 
✓ Banner ads: These ads are much like the banner ads you see all over the 
desktop Web. As a designer, the differences you need to understand are 
the ad’s size, download speed, and placement. See “Creating Banner Ads 
for Mobile Sites” for details.
 
✓ SMS messages: Short Message Service (SMS), or text messages, are lim-
ited to 160 characters in length, so your advertising message has to be 
short and sweet. The messages can contain links to Web sites or click-
to-call messages — you click the SMS so that your phone places a call. 
The section, “Launching a free SMS advertising campaign” explains the 
basics of setting up this type of ad.
 
✓ CSC messages: Common Short Codes (CSCs) are a series of numbers, 
usually five or six digits, to which a user can send a text message. A 
response message from an advertiser is sent back with information or 
content, or with a contest you can enter (for example, American Idol 
encourages viewers to text vote to a number corresponding to their 
favorite contestant to place their vote). The section “Connecting with 
Customers via Short Codes” explains how they work.
 
✓ QR Codes: Quick Response Codes, or 2D barcodes, look like the little 
jumbled checkerboard patterns used to track FedEx or UPS shipments. 
In 1994, Denso Wave created them to track auto parts because they can 
contain so much more data than traditional bar codes (such as the ones 
on packages in grocery stores).
 
 QR Codes work this way: Each code can contain up to 4,296 characters 
(or a string of 7,089 numbers). Users with cellphone cameras and the 
right software installed can take a picture of the QR Code, launching the 
phone’s browser and redirecting to the URL contained in the code. Find 
out how to create your own QR Codes in the section “Offering Links and 
more with QR Codes.”
 
✓ Coupons: Touted as “the coupons that you never forget to take with 
you,” mobile coupons are attracting attention from major advertisers 
like Hollywood Video, 1-800-Flowers.com, Sears, Supercuts, McDonalds, 
and others. Juniper Research estimates that by 2011, about 3 billion 
mobile coupons will be redeemed for $7 billion in discounts. One of the 
big advantages is that mobile coupons can deliver demographic informa-
tion about the users, in addition to motivating them to come to a store 
and make a purchase. You find details about coupon ads in the section, 
“Handing out Coupons via the Mobile Web.”

235
 Chapter 10: Mobile Marketing and Social Media
 
✓ Image recognition: Image recognition advertising allows you to take a 
picture of something (usually an ad in a magazine or on a billboard) and 
send it to the publisher or advertiser. In return, you get exclusive con-
tent or prizes. The offer might be a ringtone, coupon, or anything else 
that can be sent directly to a person’s mobile phone. See “Sharing Offers 
via Image Recognition” for more on this model.
Assessing the Impact of 
Mobile Advertising
Although mobile advertising agencies still debate the best way to measure 
how mobiles sway consumers to make purchases (is it intent to purchase 
after seeing an ad or do only dollars-and-cents sales figures count?), pioneers 
in the field report some compelling successes. Of course, the saying “The pio-
neers get all the arrows” also still holds true because detractors can point to 
ads that seemingly had no impact.
 
When mobile ads are targeted correctly and the campaign is well thought out, 
the response rates are much higher than direct mail or even Internet cam-
paigns in which getting 0.1 percent of the audience to respond is considered 
success. Some mobile campaigns have response rates as high as 20 percent; 
basically, the ads are 200 times more effective than regular advertising.
Some notable examples of successful mobile campaigns include the following:
 
✓ The Stanislaus County Fair in central California was seeing sparse atten-
dance during the middle of the day because of the hot sun during the 
day and concerts at night. By using mobile coupons, the fair was able to 
recruit young tech-savvy teens to show up in return for a $3 discount. 
Even in this rural market, the conversion rate on the coupons was 44 
percent.
 
✓ The Gunstock Mountain Resort in New Hampshire started a program 
called JitterGram (basically, clever SMS messages) to get users to sign 
up for notices on lunch and happy hour specials, sales on ski clothes, 
and discounted lift tickets (that the resort used to drive traffic to the ski 
runs on off days). For each JitterGram sent to subscribers, the resort 
netted an extra $1,000 of business that day.
 
✓ In July 2009, Chicago’s Shedd Aquarium tested the difference in 
response rates. In one TV commercial, viewers were sent to a Web site 
to register for a contest. In the other TV commercial, viewers we told to 
enter the contest by sending a text message to a short code.
 
 The short code campaign generated 325 percent more entries than the 
Web-based call-to-action. Although the short code campaign ran only in 
25 percent of the ads, it generated 52 percent of the total entries.

236
Part III: Multimedia, Marketing, and E-Commerce 
 
✓ Yamaha WaterCraft (the division that makes WaveRunners) ran a cam-
paign in which people who texted WAVE to a short code or entered 
their mobile phone number into a form on the Yamaha mobile Web site 
were entered into a sweepstakes. Yamaha saw a 400 percent increase 
in the number of people who entered the sweepstakes (and also opted 
to receive more marketing information from Yamaha about their boats, 
motors, and Jet Skis).
 
✓ Lane Bryant started a program in which customers waiting in line at the 
cash register signed up for coupons and discounts to be delivered over 
their phones. When the customers walked out of the store, their phones 
lit up with text messages offering them special deals, such as cash back 
or a percentage off their next purchase. Nearly 20 percent of the custom-
ers re-targeted this way came back within two weeks to use the discount 
codes they were sent on their phones to make additional purchases.
 
✓ Reebok ran a campaign in which soccer fans could download pictures 
of their favorite players’ jerseys and then send them to their friends via 
e-mail or SMS. This Gift a Jersey program led to Reebok vastly expanding 
its network of interested customers as well as a 14.6 percent increase in 
traffic to stores selling the real jerseys.
 
✓ When Volkswagen experimented with the launch of their redesigned 
GTI, it was determined not to spend a single cent on TV, print, or the 
Internet. Instead, Volkswagen licensed a driving game designed specifi-
cally to be played on the iPhone, and put its new GTI in it, with all the 
performance and handling characteristics of the real car. More than 2 
million people downloaded the game, and the six best players won a 
free souped-up GTI. And in the ultimate measure of success, Volkswagen 
reported that the marketing cost per car sold dropped by 97 percent.
 
✓ PlayStation ran a mobile ad campaign for their Resistance 2 game. Out 
of 170,000 SMS messages sent, PlayStation got 27,000 people to click 
through and watch the video — about a 16 percent response rate.

Marketing Association’s Web site at http://mmaglobal.com/resources/

ad campaign that could work for you.
Creating Banner Ads for Mobile Sites
Every new medium is influenced by what came before it. The first movies 
were basically plays on film; directors plunked their cameras on tripods in 
front of a stages and called “Action!” Decades passed before anyone picked 
up a camera and moved it around or did any of the trick photography people 

237
 Chapter 10: Mobile Marketing and Social Media
now take for granted. When television came along, Hollywood figured it was 
just like radio — only with pictures. So directors took radio actors and stuck 
them in front of cameras, finding out in the process what the phrase “has a 
face for radio” means.
Banner ads came about through just such a process; early Web publishers 
took ads destined for newspaper or magazine pages, and then published 
them on Web pages (albeit with some enhancements such as simple anima-
tions that asked users to click to “Punch the Monkey”). The first impulse for 
mobile advertising was to take those existing banner advertisements from 
the Internet, shrink them, and stick them on the mobile Web. Although this 
may not be the most innovative approach, at this stage of development, it 
may be good enough (as long as the ads don’t include the Flash animations, 
which are common to the desktop Web but won’t work on many mobile 
devices). Of course, as mobile advertising evolves, banner ads will have to 
evolve and change with it.
All kinds of considerations come into play when displaying banner ads on a 
mobile phone. These include
 
✓ Screen resolution: Most often expressed as screen width, screen resolu-
tion refers to how many pixels wide the screen on the phone handset is.
 
✓ File size: Particularly crucial in mobile advertising because phones typi-
cally don’t have the random access memory (RAM) and hard drive stor-
age that computers do. Larger file sizes are risky on the mobile platform, 
because uncertain wireless connections can cause significant load time 
delays.
 
✓ Phone processor speed: Just like in computers, the speed here is con-
stantly improving, which means that most phones can render and dis-
play video.
 
✓ Software/operating system on the phone: These include Opera Mini, 
Symbian, Windows Mobile, Android, iPhone OS, Moblin, and more every 
day. If you’re designing an application instead of a Web site, you will 
need to create a different version for each operating system.
 
✓ Functionality: Clicking an ad on a mobile device can activate a script 
that causes your phone to make a call, launch an application, or go to a 
browser page.
At first glance, the technical challenges seem daunting: Handsets in the U.S. 
market have 31 screen widths coupled with different color depths.
The Mobile Marketing Association (MMA) has a chart that shows the recom-
mended sizes in pixels for banner ads as well as the size of the graphic file. If 
you create a banner ad, you need to know and abide by these specifications. 

238
Part III: Multimedia, Marketing, and E-Commerce 
Table 10-1 outlines what you find in the chart. The universal specification 
refers to basic banner ads that should display on most devices, while the 
supplemental specification is for banner ads that involve animation and that 
may have to be individually tailored to devices using content adaptation (see 
Chapter 6 for more on designing for different devices). The MMA is producing 
updated charts for the new wave of higher-resolution mobile device displays 
hitting the market; we have used the specifications for the 4:1 banner ads. A 
4:1 aspect ratio refers to the relationship between the height and width of the 
ad, so that the ad is 4 times as wide as it is tall. Another common aspect ratio 
is 6:1; banner ads in this aspect ratio are therefore much wider than they are 
tall. You can download a PDF explaining these concepts in more depth at 
http://mmaglobal.com/mobileadvertising.pdf. You can see exam-
ples of the relative sizes and types of banner ads in Figure 10-1.

The newest thing in mobile banner ads is the Adhesion product from Crisp 
Wireless. Adhesion is a banner ad that follows the user while he scrolls down 
the page — only unlike the other tagalong banners, this one disappears during 
the scrolling action and reappears only when the user comes to rest again. 
Adhesion is generating a lot of excitement in the mobile advertising world 
because one of the big problems with mobile banners is that the screen space 
is so limited that advertisers’ messages appear onscreen only for a few sec-
onds before the users move past them.
Reaching Out with Text Messaging (SMS)
Most advertisers use SMS as a way to contact their (potential) customers to 
alert them to a special event, offer, or opportunity. A lot of merchants see 
SMS alerts as a great way to maintain customer loyalty. Few see SMS alerts as 
a way to bring in new customers because the messages go out to users who 
have opted-in already to hear about the products, rather than to people who 
are unaware that the merchant even exists. Here are some ways that you can 
use SMS ads to drum up new business:
 
✓ Promo ads: These are short marketing messages, with no special links 
or functions included. For example:
 
 Special discount this week. Mention DigitalFamily.com and get an 
extra 50% off all training.
 
✓ Site links: Text messages that include a link that, when clicked, causes 
the user’s phone browser to open and navigate to the advertiser’s 
Web site.

240
Part III: Multimedia, Marketing, and E-Commerce 
 
✓ Ad downloads: These links download an ad to the phone. This down-
load can be an audio file (usually a song), a photo, a video, or even a 
branded video game.
 
✓ Appended ads: These ads appear after some other kind of content. 
Think of them as the mobile equivalent of sponsorship, such as
 
 Packers 31–Vikings 10. These sports score alerts sponsored by 
DigitalFamily.com. Click here to get a 25% discount on all jerseys.
 
✓ Voice call ads: These ads use click-to-call functionality to deliver a 
prerecorded message. These are useful in situations when you want 
the impact of multimedia ads, but the data transmission network isn’t 
reliable. You can either set the user’s phone to make a call, or you can 
use a service that makes the calls (particularly useful in situations when 
incoming calls are free, and users don’t use all their minutes). An exam-
ple could be

report on Malibu Beach.
 
Most carriers charge mobile users for the text messages they send and 
receive. If you indiscriminately blast people with SMS, they may get charged 
money to see your ads. This can lead to very angry ex-customers, not to men-
tion litigation from the FCC or cellphone carrier networks that have set up 
strict policies governing how cellphone users may be contacted.
You must get permission from your customers to send them SMS alerts. 
Usually this is done by having them text you an activation code from their 
cellphone or having them fill out a form that clearly expresses to them that 
they agree to receive text messages on their cellphones. An activation code 
is usually included in other marketing materials; common places such codes 
appear include posters outside concerts or sporting events, on soft-drink 
packages, in radio spots, at the end of TV ads, or on the back side of clothing 
tags. Typically, the message says something like “Text [a six-digit code] to 
[the advertiser’s number] to receive news and special offers.”
Finding an SMS campaign provider
SMS campaigns are much simpler to deal with than CSC (common short 
code) campaigns. Companies, such as the following, have lots of information 
on their Web sites about what you need to do if you want to run a large-scale 
SMS messaging campaign: 
 
✓ Clickatell: www.clickatell.com Clickatell claims to be the first online 
SMS gateway; that means that they were the first to allow users to send 
SMS messages to mobile devices from desktop computers. They say 
they can send SMS messages to devices in more than 220 countries and 
territories around the world. They also sell short codes in six countries, 
including the United States.

241
 Chapter 10: Mobile Marketing and Social Media
 
✓ txtwire: www.txtwire.com Originally created specifically to take 
advantage of mobile marketing, txtwire has branched out to also provide 
emergency alert services for schools and local government. They are 
not as large as some of the other companies here, and they seem to be 
more open to working with small businesses.
 
✓ TxtImpact: www.smsgatewaypro.com This diversified company offers 
SMS applications to let people vote, enter contests, play trivia games, 
and much more. They also sell shared CSCs (ones that run only while 
your marketing campaign is running) as well as dedicated CSCs that 
would belong only to you.
 
✓ iLoop Mobile: www.iloopmobile.com They have slick templates for 
SMS marketing campaigns and aim their product offerings at large adver-
tising agencies. While they are not an SMS gateway, they do work with 
bulk SMS providers and bundle the technical services with their profes-
sional consulting work in a way that may be attractive to people who 
just want a one-stop solution.
If you want to shop around, search for SMS gateway; new companies spring 
up daily.
 
Most reputable companies charge 5 cents or less per text message sent. But 
be aware that the rates these companies charge for advertising campaigns can 
vary wildly; some want as much as 50 cents per customer for each text mes-
sage they send. Make sure you understand what you’re signing up for before 
you start the campaign or you can wind up with a much more expensive bill 
than you expect.
 
If you want to get your feet wet, social media company Brightkite (http://
brightkite.com) just rolled out a free service that you can use to send bulk 
SMS messages to as many as 25 people at a time. Brightkite was originally 
conceived of as a kind of location-based Twitter; that is, a place where people 
could quickly and easily upload where they were and what they were doing. 
Then, their friends could track them and see whether they were nearby for 
a serendipitous meet-up. Like many other social networking sites, Brightkite 
expanded its range of functions to include sending mass text messages and 
to allow the message receivers to message each other (and you). This may be 
enough for a small business to stay in touch with its most loyal customers.
As an added bonus, the Brightkite Group Text service allows you to use 
Facebook, Twitter, and Flickr to share the messages with friends — which 
may help your loyal customers and fans reach out to their friends. Although 
Brightkite imposes a 25-person limit on the number of people you can send 
an SMS message to at any one time, you can always have multiple groups. If 
your business scales up to the point that you send hundreds of text message 
ads, make the jump to a dedicated bulk SMS gateway anyway. You can also 
use Brightkite’s iPhone or Android app to send these bulk SMS messages; these 
apps have their own sets of instructions to lead you through the process.

Launching a free SMS 
advertising campaign
To set up a free SMS text-messaging advertising service and send your first 
message, follow these steps:
 
1. Open your browser and navigate to www.brightkite.com.
 
 The Brightkite home page opens, as shown in Figure 10-2. This is where 
you log in to send SMS messages or to check whether any of your cus-
tomers responded to the messages that you sent.
 
 If you already use Brightkite, skip to Step 6 and log in the way you 
always do. Otherwise, continue to Step 2 to create an account.
 
2. Click the Group Text tab.
 
 The Log In page opens.
 
3. Click the Sign Up link, and on the page that appears, fill in your e-mail 
address, username, and password, and then type a security question 
answer.
 
 For your username, use the name of your business, or if you promote your 
own services, use your name. Don’t get too funky with your choice — 
you don’t want to turn off your customers.
 
 The security question makes sure that automated bots don’t take over 
the service by creating thousands of spam accounts.

4. Click the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy links.
 
 Yes, reading these are tedious, but it’s good to know what you’re getting 
into, so make an effort.
 
5. Click the Sign Up button.
 
6. On the Brightkite home page, click the Log In button and enter your 
username and password.
 
 Your home screen appears with posts from users near you.
 
7. Click the Group Text tab again.
 
 The screen welcoming you to Group Text opens, with a short explana-
tion of the features.
 
8. Click the Start Conversation button.
 
 A box opens on your screen with fields for you to fill out to send the text 
messages.
 
9. Type the phone numbers for the people that you want to send mes-
sages to.
 
 Press the Tab key to enter multiple phone numbers. And note that you 
enter the phone numbers without parentheses, commas, dashes, or 
periods. See Figure 10-3 for an example of how the text input field for the 
Group Text function looks when you are typing the phone numbers of 
your contacts into the fields.
 
10. Type the short (fewer than 160 characters) message and click the 
Send button.
 
 Congratulations! You just sent your first mass text message. You can 
also type the names of friends on Brightkite, if they have integrated 
Brightkite with their mobile phones. You can type in their names rather 
than having to remember their phone numbers if you have added them 
as friends on Brightkite. Because Brightkite is integrated with Facebook, 
if you have a Facebook page for your business, you can use that to 
contact your customers (if they have a cellphone associated with their 
Facebook account). You can also use your Facebook account to send 
out an SMS message to that person, rather than having to remember or 
know their mobile phone number.
Another way to build up your list of friends is to set Brightkite to show posts 
from people in a specified region. You can choose to find people who are 
anywhere from within 60 miles to 20 yards of your location. Take the time to 
fill out your profile so that people who friend you on the service learn about 
your location and what your business is about.

244

The first time you send a mass text message with Brightkite, test this process 
on your phone and on the phones of some close friends to make sure that it 
works the way you expected.
 
Figure 10-3:

When your customers receive the message, they can respond to you with a 
message of their own. Their messages are also sent to the other people on 
your SMS list, and you can monitor what they say about you or your business.
You can also geo-tag (include GPS data in your messages so that your loca-
tion will show up on a mapping program like MapQuest or Google Maps) your 
messages to alert people to where you are, or send along photos for every-
one to look at.
Connecting with Customers 
via Short Codes
To run an advertising campaign with CSC requires a lot of coordination; all 
the various carrier networks have to be notified and paid to allow the text 
messages sent to a number to go to the same place. Then the users have to 
be told that they need to send a text, to either opt-in to receive more content 
or to enter a contest.

245
 Chapter 10: Mobile Marketing and Social Media
To run a CSC ad campaign (such as “Text Free Pizza to JOESPIZZA to get a 
free Chicago deep-dish pizza delivered to your house”), you have to contract 
with a CSC reseller, who has contracts with all the major carrier networks so 
that your code works with all the phones in your area. These kinds of cam-
paigns cost upward of $2,000 to set up and anywhere from $500 to $1,400 a 
month to maintain. They’re that expensive because they require a lot of 
coordination to run across an entire country. In the list of SMS campaign 
providers shown earlier in this chapter, we included a couple of companies 
that also offer CSCs.
Offering Links and More with QR Codes
QR codes (or 2D barcodes) can appear on newspaper pages, signs, buses, 
business cards, or any object on which you can print a decent resolution 
image. These examples illustrate just a few ways these codes are used:
 
✓ In San Francisco, Scanbuy partnered with Citysearch to produce QR 
codes that were placed in the windows of 580 restaurants. Customers 
with the ScanLife software on their phones can point their phone cam-
eras at the code in the window. As soon as the software recognizes the 
code, the phone displays a Citysearch review and information about the 
food and drinks available.
 
✓ Not to be outdone, Antenna Audio put QR codes at tourist attractions in 
San Francisco. Users can point their phone cameras at the codes and are 
treated to an audio tour of the site and an explanation of its history.
 
✓ Newspapers, such as the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, run QR codes alongside 
concert reviews or sports stories. Readers can point their phone cam-
eras at the code, and then their phones open a page where the reader 
can buy and download songs the reviewed band played, or browse 
through jerseys of teams that played in the game.
 
✓ Another very successful use of QR codes was done by the magazine Get 
Married. This magazine uses the Microsoft Tag engine, which makes it 
possible to create QR codes in color, rather than the black-and-white 
codes used in most QR codes. Another advantage is that with Microsoft 
Tags, you can turn almost any picture into a QR code, making the codes 
far more visually appealing. Get Married now includes Microsoft Tag QR 
Codes in nearly every ad in the print and online editions.
With the Microsoft Tag, anyone can create QR codes for mobile devices for 
free, which makes them an increasingly popular addition to everything from 
business cards to bumper stickers. For people to read your tags, they need 
a phone with an Internet connection and a camera, as well as the Tag Reader 

246
Part III: Multimedia, Marketing, and E-Commerce 
application installed on their phone. On the iPhone, after you install the Tag 
Reader app, when you point the phone’s camera at any QR code, the phone 
buzzes in your hand, launches the Web browser, and takes you to the related 
content. Tag Reader already works with most smartphones and some feature 
phones. Find the most up-to-date details about Tag support at http://tag.
microsoft.com/resources/mobile-support.aspx.
You can create colorful QR codes for free on the Microsoft Tag site, and 
you can even customize them with your own photos in the background. To 
get started:
 
1. Open your browser and navigate to http://tag.microsoft.com.
 
 The Microsoft Tag home page opens. As you can see in Figure 10-4, 
Microsoft is making a concerted effort to reach out to the hip, urban 
market that is the most connected with mobile technology.
 
2. Click the Sign In link in the upper-right corner.
 
 Microsoft Tag requires that you sign up with a Windows Live account. 
Although you can use this account to access other Microsoft products, 
you don’t have to. If you already have a Windows Live ID (which you 
have if you’ve ever used Hotmail, Windows Live Messenger, or Xbox 
LIVE), you can use that to sign in. If you don’t have one, you can create 
an account for free.

 To create a Windows Live account, navigate to https://login.live.
com/ and follow the instructions there. If you sign in on the Windows 
Live page, Microsoft will place a cookie (a snippet of software code that 
is temporarily stored on your computer’s hard drive, depending on 
whether or not you have your browser’s security settings set to accept 
cookies) onto your computer that will keep you signed in to all Microsoft 
sites with that Windows Live ID. That means that when you navigate 
back to the Microsoft Tag page, you will remain signed in with your 
Windows Live ID (as long as you are doing it during the same browsing 
session that you were in when you created the Windows Live ID or 
during the same session that you were using when you signed in to 
Windows Live using your Windows Live ID and you haven’t deleted your 
cookies). If you already have a Windows Live account, all you will have 
to do is sign in on the Microsoft Tag site, using the Sign In button and 
your existing Windows Live ID.
 
 After you click the Sign In button next to your username, enter your pass-
word, and click the Sign In button again, the Manage Tags page opens.
 
3. Click the Create a Tag button.
 
 The Tag Manager page opens.
 
4. Type the title in the Tag Title text box.
 
 Start with something simple, such as Test Tag. When you run your own 
QR advertising programs, be more descriptive so that you can keep 
track of which QR codes correspond to what content.
 
5. Choose what kind of QR code you want to create from the Tag Type 
drop-down list:
 
• URL: This is just a link to whatever Web site you want your users’ 
phones to navigate to.
 
• Free Text: You can have a secret message appear on the phone’s 
screen; if you want, you can even protect that message with a 
secret password. This can be useful if you want to run a game, 
such as a scavenger hunt with clues.
 
• vCard: This is the universal format for contact information that the 
user can then put into his electronic address book. Many people 
print these types of codes on their business cards in lieu of the 
increasingly diverse and complicated ways people have invented 
to contact each other.
 
• Dialer: This is just a code that causes the user’s phone to wake up 
and dial the number you specify.
 
 For this example, we create a code that drives users to a Web site, so as 
you can see in Figure 10-5, we chose www.slightlyusedcats.com.

6. Enter a brief description of the tag in the Tag Notes text box.
 
 This reminds you what the tag does.
 
7. Click the calendar next to the date to specify a different start date 
than the one shown.
 
 This is available if you want the code to be posted somewhere but to not 
deliver its content payload until a certain date (such as a code, printed 
on concert posters to let fans buy tickets, that you want to coordinate 
with the date and time the tickets go on sale).
 
8. (Optional) Choose an end date for the code.
 
 You can either leave the code open-ended — the code always works — 
by selecting the No End Date radio button, or you can limit the time the 
code works, such as when the code is for a coupon or a special phone 
message, by selecting the End By radio button and then choosing a date 
from the calendar.
 
9. Enter the URL that you want the users’ phones to navigate to in the 
URL text box.
 
 This can be the home page of your site or some special content on your 
site that you want the users to see, such as the menu for your restaurant 
or the map to your special super-secret party location.
 
10. Click the Save button.
 
 The Manage Tags page opens, showing you all the tags you have 
created.

11. Under the Render heading, click the tag image to get an image file of 
the QR code you just created.
 
 You can generate an image of the tag as a PDF, WMF, JPEG, PNG, GIF, or 
TIFF file, depending on your needs. You can also choose to have just the 
code or an image with brief instructions on how to use it, as shown in 
Figure 10-6, along with the URL of the Web site where users can down-
load the app that reads these codes to their smartphones.
 
 That’s it — congratulations! You just created your very own customized 
code.
 
To check how people respond to your code, log in via the Microsoft Tag home 
page and click the Reports tab. You see a summary of how many people have 
clicked your tag along with tracking and demographic information.

Handing Out Coupons via the Mobile Web
When customers use a printed coupon, you can only gather very limited 
information about them, such as what general zip code you distributed the 
coupon to (assuming your customers didn’t share their coupons with some-
one from across town).
In contrast, when you use mobile coupons, you can track exactly who you 
sent that coupon to, how long it took them to redeem it, what kind of phone 
it was sent to, and all kinds of other demographic information that can help 
you make your marketing and sales efforts more efficient.

250
Part III: Multimedia, Marketing, and E-Commerce 
The capability of the mobile Web to deliver a coupon to the user exactly 
when and where it will do the most good creates an immediate and personal-
ized call-to-action that results in instant gratification. Imagine reaching out to 
customers with discounts and special offers to tempt them while they walk 
past your place of business.
Research done by Michael Hanley at Ball State University shows two-thirds 
of college students (one of the most hard to reach and eagerly pursued 
demographics) will change their behaviors if they have coupon incentives. 
The top-three coupons they’re most eager to use include at least one real 
surprise:
 
✓ Sit-down restaurants (because although college students may be broke, 
they’re still hungry and like to impress their dates once in a while)
 
✓ Movies (again for dates or entertainment)
 
✓ Dry cleaning (because sometimes Mom just isn’t available)
Scanning mobile coupons
There is, however, a major snag with mobile coupons: Because the coupon 
barcode appears on a phone’s LCD screen, many older laser barcode readers 
can’t process the information. Target recently spent tens of millions of dol-
lars to replace all the scanners at their cash registers around the country for 
just this reason.
One way around this is to use other means to scan coupons. The mobile 
coupon companies are rolling out various small, point-of-sale terminals that 
can be used for coupons or for setting up toll-free numbers for merchants to 
call to verify and track coupons.
For example, Xtra Mobile Coupons (www.xtracoupons.com) ran a test 
campaign with Outback Steakhouse. In this campaign, Xtra provided the res-
taurants with a small terminal (about the size of an iPhone) that allows the 
server to read an eight-digit code on the customer’s mobile phone screen and 
then punch that code into the coupon terminal to add the discount to the 
customer’s bill. Outback is delighted with the program because it can map 
and track the zip codes that the customers are from and what times of day 
they come into the restaurant. Based on this information, Outback re-targets 
customers with incentives to come back. The technology has also helped 
Outback avoid the type of coupon fraud that bedeviled the Subway sandwich 
chain a few years ago.

Sharing coupons with mobile technology
The next wave of mobile coupons is likely to be driven by the growing 
inclusion of GPS functionality in mobile devices. Already, startups such as 
mobiQpons and Yowza!! show coupons based on the user’s proximity to 
stores. Yowza!! even allows users to share coupons with their friends through 
social networking; thus, tying their coupons to the most popular use of the 
mobile Web today — updating Facebook and Twitter.
Creating free mobile coupons
You can try a free mobile coupon service to see whether it gets any traction 
and whether your customers like it. The following steps explain how to take 
advantage of the new technology platform created by MixMobi. MixMobi 
allows you to try its mobile coupon service for 14 days (and 5,000 page 
views). To continue after that costs $19.95 per month for the most basic plan. 
Follow these steps:
 
1. Open your browser and navigate to http://mixmobi.com.
 
 The MixMobi home page (see Figure 10-7) opens.
 
2. Click the Free Trial tab.
 
 The sign-up page opens.
 
Figure 10-7: 
The 
MixMobi 
home page.
 

252
Part III: Multimedia, Marketing, and E-Commerce 
 
3. Fill in the name of your company and your e-mail address, and then 
choose your time zone.
 
4. Pick a username and password, and then click the Create Account 
button.
 
 The Account Dashboard page opens. Here you can manage your coupon 
campaigns. By clicking on the tabs, you can access a list of all the 
coupon campaigns you have running, schedule when coupons will be 
sent and when they will expire, track the redemption rates for your cou-
pons, and, of course, pay for upgraded services on an account page.
 
5. Click around the various pages to familiarize yourself with some of 
the features that will be available to you and then click the New Offer 
button in the upper-right corner of the page.
 
6. Click on the radio button next to “a template.”
 
 The other choices are to create a coupon from an existing offer or a 
blank offer. Once you have created a few coupons, you can choose from 
your existing offers, but if you’re starting out, you obviously don’t have 
any to choose from yet. The blank offer option is a real sparse, stripped-
down layout that you can play with later, once you get the hang of using 
the more user-friendly templates that MixMobi has provided.
 
7. Choose the layout of your mobile coupon from the Offer Template 
drop-down list or the gallery of templates below it.
 
 You can mix and match pictures, text, logos, and message headers, and 
choose from a variety of layouts (see Figure 10-7 for a sampling of how 
many headers you can choose from). For now, just choose a simple 
image and code.
 
8. Type the name of the coupon and a brief description of what it’s for in 
the Name and Description text boxes, respectively.
 
 As the page says, the description you type (or not) here is just for your 
internal use and will not be seen by your customers. It’s just a handy 
way for you to be able to tell at a glance what the coupon is for.
 
9. Choose the dates that the coupon is valid.
 
 The default is to start today and run for a week. You can even choose 
the exact times the coupon is valid, which can come in handy when you 
want to have coupons cascade during a day — that is, to give 50 percent 
off to the people who show up first, 20 percent to the ones who are 
there an hour before closing, and 10 percent to the people who show up 
at the last minute.
 
10. On the drop-down menu, choose which campaign this coupon is for, 
or click the New Campaign link next to the drop-down menu to create 
a new campaign.

253
 Chapter 10: Mobile Marketing and Social Media
 
 The first time you create a coupon, the default is “Your First Campaign.” 
After you have created your first coupons, you can get more ambitious 
and click New Campaign to start creating categories to organize your 
efforts.
 
11. Type tags relevant to what you create the coupon for.
 
 Tags help search engines find and categorize stuff on the Web. For exam-
ple, if you sell a cat in a hat, you could use tags like Cat, Hat, Apparel, 
Cute, Feline, and so on.
 
12. Select the check box next to “list builder” if you want to add a field 
to your coupon where customers can send you their e-mail address or 
phone number.
 
 Choosing this feature for your coupons will enable you to start build-
ing a mailing list of your best customers, or at least people who have 
responded to your special offers. When one of your customers regis-
ters, an e-mail will be sent to the e-mail address you used to open your 
MixMobi account.
 
13. Next to Page Views Allowed, enter the maximum number of page 
views that you want to allow users of your mobile coupon to do. Leave 
this field blank if you do not want to limit the number of page views, 
although MixMobi says that their limit is 500,000 page views for your 
entire account.
 
 This field is only crucial if you are running a large-scale mobile coupon 
campaign where you anticipate that hundreds of thousands of people 
are going to be responding to your offer, or if you have a lot of rich 
media (such as a video that takes up many megabytes of space) on the 
page that you are directing your users to.
 
14. Click the Continue button.
 
 The Edit Offer page opens to allow you to further customize your 
coupon. Here you can replace the text and images in the template with 
your own. The default for the images is a JPEG that’s optimized for the 
Web and 320 x 305 pixels. If you have a picture of one of your products, 
make sure that when you resize it to use in this coupon, you use the 
Save for Web function in your image editor. For more about optimizing 
images for mobile, see Chapter 8 and Appendix B.
 
15. Click on the drop-down menu under Offer Elements to find options 
that you can use to design your coupon, as shown in Figure 10-8.
 
 You can choose to add design elements such as images, headlines, and 
descriptive text. Choose the category from the drop-down list and fill 
in the fields for that category. You can include any or all of the options. 
Each has its own fields for you to fill out.

254
Part III: Multimedia, Marketing, and E-Commerce 
 
16. Click on the green arrows to the left of the elements that you have 
added to your coupon, and drag them up or down in the list to change 
the order they appear on your coupon.
 
17. Click the Save button to see a preview of how your coupon will look.
 
 The updated coupon will load into the right side of the page, reflecting 
the changes and updates you have made.
 
18. If you are completely satisfied with the way the coupon looks, click 
the Save and Close button to proceed to the Share page.  
 
 The Share page opens with links to the coupon you just created as well 
as buttons to send your coupon to friends, customers, and other con-
tacts via Twitter or Facebook.
 
19. Click the Clipboard icon next to the link to the right of the words 
Public URL to copy the link code for your mobile coupon.
 
 If you run an SMS campaign (such as one created with Brightkite, dis-
cussed in the section “Launching a free SMS advertising campaign,” 
earlier in this chapter), you can paste the link code for your coupon into 
the Group Text page on Brightkite. That will allow you to send this URL 
to people via SMS messages; they can then click on the URL in the SMS 
message to open their browser and navigate to the mobile coupon that 
you just created. Taking the initiative for distributing the coupon is a 
simple way to “close the loop” on this campaign.
 
Test the link code first by sending it to your own phone by using the Private 
URL so that you don’t mess up your tracking statistics. After that, send the 
code to a few friends and see what they think about it.

Sharing Offers via Image Recognition
Similar to QR codes, image recognition advertising allows the user to take 
a picture of any object, including a print advertisement, send that image to 
a publisher or advertiser, and, in return, get exclusive content (wallpaper, 
ringtones, coupons, and so on). Men’s Health and Rolling Stone were the first 
print publications to take advantage of this new product, which is attractive 
for publishers because it allows them to offer advertisers a chance to tie 
together their print and online ad campaigns in a seamless way.
This technology faces some initially daunting challenges. For instance, many 
cellphone cameras produce blurry, dim images, sending those images can be 
expensive or complicated, and the computing power required to process and 
recognize those photos is significant.
Among the companies making inroads with image recognition ads are:
 
✓ GetFugu: The mobile start-up company GetFugu recently launched its 
See It technology, which allows users to point their phone’s camera at 
any modern corporate logo or sign, take a picture, and then be directed 
to that brand’s Web site. The app also includes voice and GPS search 
functions.
 
 GetFugu claims that its technology has made the logo recognition pro-
cess almost 90 percent accurate and that it can discern among such 
similar items as the Apple logo, the AT&T logo, and the Death Star from 
Star Wars.
 
✓ Amazon: Amazon tests its own image recognition engine and claims that 
if a user takes a picture of his dog, the phone responds by showing ads 
for dog food or flea medication.
 
✓ Google Goggles: This app runs only on the Android operating system, 
but it’s gotten a lot of press because it has a great “wow factor.” With 
Google Goggles you can point your phone’s camera at almost anything 
and get more information about it. Point the camera at a label on a wine 
bottle, and you’ll likely be directed to the winery or a wine distributor. 
Point your phone’s camera at a building or other landmark, and you get 
information on the architect, the history of the location, or other details. 
You can even take a picture of someone’s business card, and Goggles 
automatically enters that information into your contact database. This 
technology seems destined to become increasingly popular for all kinds 
of uses.

256
Part III: Multimedia, Marketing, and E-Commerce 
Advertising via the Power 
of Mobile Social Media
The number one use of the mobile Web is to participate in social media sites; 
after all, social media is all about communicating with your friends, and the 
one tried-and-true use of phones is to call friends, right? The statistics about 
how people use social media are enough to make advertisers perk up: Users 
spend about 2.7 hours a day on the mobile Web. Forty-five percent post com-
ments on social networking sites, 43 percent connect with friends on social 
networking sites, 40 percent share content with others, and 38 percent share 
photos.
That’s a lot of time and attention, but advertising over social media is still 
an extremely tricky thing. Advertising conferences are full of woeful stories 
of social media campaigns gone wrong, such as when Facebook tried to roll 
out a Beacon service that served up ads that mined all the things people had 
done on the Web and then offered suggestions. A businessman got all kinds 
of suggestions for expensive jewelry and racy underwear based on his recent 
purchases. Was he happy to see these ads? His wife certainly wasn’t.
If you haven’t been running social media advertising campaigns, the best 
way to begin is to start using the medium that you’re going to be working 
in. People use social media — blogs, Twitter, Facebook, MySpace, YouTube, 
Foursquare, Brightkite, hi5, and dozens of others — as virtual water coolers 
or corner bars. Places to congregate and swap gossip, trade good-natured 
insults, flirt, plan outings, and generally commiserate. Using the traditional 
advertising techniques in this kind of milieu is like barging into someone’s 
intimate private party and pulling out a briefcase full of samples; it comes off 
as rude and intrusive.
The best use of social media that advertisers have found so far is to use it to 
reinforce relationships and empower their best customers to say nice things 
about them to all their friends. Marketers talk about engagement (although 
there is a lot of disagreement as to what an engaged customer actually 
means) as the goal of forward-thinking campaigns to get people engaged in 
the brand or product you’re marketing. The means to achieve this include 
SMS notifications, newsfeeds, integrated profiles, partner pages, surveys, 
competitions, games, widgets, and more. When you give your customers 
something that they like and then provide them with the means and encour-
agement to share it with all their friends, you can earn a lot of great buzz, but 
you also give up a lot of the power and control that come with more tradi-
tional forms of advertising.

257
 Chapter 10: Mobile Marketing and Social Media
 
When consumers get exclusive or early information, invitations to special 
events, promotions, or free stuff, they naturally feel like the advertiser has 
formed an intimate bond with them. And what do people like to do when they 
get something special? They like to brag to their friends. Make sharing infor-
mation about your product easy for them to do, and you’re off to a good start 
with a social-media marketing campaign.
 
The quickest and easiest tool for adding Facebook features to your Web site 
is available via the Facebook developer’s page at http://developers.
facebook.com/docs/guides/web. If you have some basic knowledge 
of HTML (you find an introduction to the Hypertext Markup Language in 
Chapter 4) and you aren’t afraid of a few lines of code, you can download the 
files from Facebook and follow the instructions in the Readme.mdown file. 
Facebook Connect allows you to let your customers (who have experience 
with your product) click and post their enthusiastic recommendations to 
their Facebook pages. The service also lets users log into comment sections, 
forum boards, and other content using their Facebook profiles as their login 
identities, which saves them having to create new usernames and passwords.
Exploring Video and Other 
Rich Media Ads
With video on the mobile platform, the same forces that constrain other 
forms of advertising apply, only more so. So the dictum, “Never use four 
words when two will do,” translated to mobile means that the traditional 
30-second TV spots that advertisers shrunk to 15-second pre-rolls for the 
Internet get cut down to 7 seconds on the mobile platform. Any more than 
that and users get frustrated, or the ad interferes with the content users 
wanted to get to in the first place.
Even for a seven-second video clip, the challenges of serving targeted video 
ads to the mobile platform are still daunting. The restrictions on banner ads 
seem quaint when considering the demands of serving video or animated 
content to a cellphone. Consider the following hurdles:
 
✓ A humble, low-resolution YouTube video can take up 3–5 MB (mega-
bytes) of space. An iffy cellphone connection or a dropped call means 
the mobile user never sees the content or the ad.
 
✓ The phone has to have enough processor power to render the video, 
and enough storage space and RAM buffer to hold the data until it’s 
ready to stream.
 
✓ The carrier has to have a server backbone sufficient to deliver the files.

258
Part III: Multimedia, Marketing, and E-Commerce 
The tradeoff for the length of the ad is (at least in theory) a radical increase 
in effectiveness because the ad can be targeted to the user based on the time, 
location, browsing habits, and all the other data points available to a mobile 
advertiser. Marrying the mobile video ad with another content form has 
shown great results for companies, such as Mogreet and Vdopia (see Figure 
10-9), as well as a recent interactive video product out of AdMob.
The AdMob Interactive Video Mobile Ad Unit product was bought by Google, 
a clear sign that Google sees a big future in the mobile advertising market. 
The considerable resources and expertise of Google mean that the AdMob ad 
product will probably get a wide market rollout. The technology allows users 
of iPhones and Droid phones to order products or get more information by 
simply tapping a button, a link, or even an image of a product on their mobile 
screens while a video is playing. It works like this: Imagine you’re watching 
a movie and see a character wearing a really cool pair of sunglasses; with 
the AdMob product, you can pause the video, tap on the sunglasses on the 
screen, and a window pops up asking whether you want to learn more or 
order the merchandise on the spot.
This very sophisticated technology is still not quite ready for prime time and 
it will be complicated to make it all work because the ad servers will have to 
be able to interpret in real time the actions of a user (which item in the video 
the user is clicking on, for example) and then connect to one or more data-
bases containing both the description of the product and the user’s financial 
information to pay for it. Whether Google (or any other company) can make 
all these moving pieces work well together remains to be seen, but it seems 
promising.
The predictions are that mobile video will grow at the rate of 137 percent 
per year, and that it will comprise the single largest segment of global mobile 
data usage by 2013. Because advertising follows where the eyeballs are, most 
major ad agencies are feverishly working to prepare their creative directors 
and staff to take advantage of this shift.

Advertising via Apps and Immersive 
Environments
The runaway success of Apple’s iPhone App Store has been both a benefit 
and a nightmare for mobile advertising designers: It’s a benefit because the 
market awareness that Apple’s “There’s an App for that” saturation TV cam-
paign has created with the public, along with the widely publicized stories of 
14-year-old coders becoming overnight millionaires when their quirky apps 
hit the big time, has finally made people take mobile advertising seriously.
The downside is that the App Store has sparked a frenzied gold-rush type 
mentality on the part of marketers who, in their panicked rush to not feel 
left out, have demanded that developers build apps for their products — no 
matter how absurd the resulting app is. Entire sessions at mobile advertising 
conferences are devoted to topics like “To App or Not to App?” and “How to 
Talk Your Client Out of an App.” So before you rush toward apps as an adver-
tising platform, make sure you’ve truly weighed the craze for apps against 
the drawbacks of investing time and resources into app development. Here 
are the key issues to consider:
 
✓ The limited market reach of apps: A truly well-designed mobile Web 
site can offer most of the functionalities that advertisers crave without 
having to custom-code an application — a process that then has to be 
repeated for each handset operating system. The iPhone, despite all the 
buzz, is still less than 5 percent of the market in the United States and 
far less than that worldwide. When you create an app for the iPhone, 
you freeze out the other 95 percent of the market. The same goes for 
apps that are designed for any of the other operating systems, such as 
Android, Symbian, BlackBerry, Palm, and so on. If you create an app, you 
need to create a different version for each operating system.
 
✓ The competition among apps in the App Store: Just about any human 
activity imaginable has had some bright coder try to produce an app to 
help do it better. But with more than 150,000 apps (and growing) in the 
App store, and many more on the way in the Android store, the idea of 
using an app to advertise your products is somewhat backward. Just 
to get people to become aware of the existence of your app, much less 
to download it and try it out, requires that you actually put money into 
advertising on other platforms. Thus, an app can become a net cost 
rather than a revenue-generator.
 
✓ Ease of updates: If you want to change an app, the user has to download 
and install updates for it. On a mobile site, however, you can simply 
update your mobile Web pages, and the user sees the new content the 
next time he visits your site.

260
Part III: Multimedia, Marketing, and E-Commerce 
Still, an app can do some things that provide advertisers with significant mar-
keting opportunities. Notable successes include
 
✓ The Pizza Hut app allows users to register with their home address and 
login information and then build their own pizza using the touch-screen 
menus. People can add ingredients, choose the crust, and take advan-

✓ Southwest Airlines lets you book and modify airline reservations, view 
flight status and flight schedules, and check your rapid rewards all from 
your iPhone.
 
✓ The E*Trade app allows investors to check stock prices, trends, and 
recent stories as well as place orders all from the same screen.
One emerging trend is that of stub apps — small applications that reside on 
the home screen of the mobile device and mainly open the device’s Web 
browser and navigate to the mobile Web site of the app designer. To some 
developers, these combine the best of both worlds; because they’re on the 
screen all the time, the mobile user is aware of it (the “out of sight, out of 
mind” paradigm is particularly powerful in the mobile world) and uses it 
more often. And because the content in the app resides on the mobile Web, 
it can be updated frequently, without requiring that the user download and 
install updates every time he wants to try something new and fresh.
 
Stub apps are also much cheaper to design and implement than full-fledged 
mobile apps, which start at about $10,000 and get more expensive from there.
The business of converting expectations: Interview 
with United Future CEO Scott Holmes
Mobile is an extension. Brands want to control 
their brand perception, and mobile is a part of 
that. When you talk about the scenarios that 
a consumer has with a brand’s touch points, 
where does mobile fit? Mobile typically fits in
 ✓ Utility, such as Alaska Airlines in which you 
can check in using your phone
 ✓ Push-pull to give users some opportunity 
to sign up for some kind of redemption and 
reward
 ✓ Entertainment, whether it be some kind 
of game play, social interaction (because 
that’s a form of entertainment), your 
Facebook account, or highlights of the 
Super Bowl
If you accept that these are the three main 
areas, United Future looks at the utility first. 
Mobile advertising has to be done in the form 
of a reward. If you can check in sooner or 
check pricing on a product from Best Buy when 
you’re in the store (versus making you go down 
the street or getting a quick validation on some 
type of local-based service or product), that has 
real utility and you’ll use it. Things are becoming 
more common as people get used to the utility 

261
 Chapter 10: Mobile Marketing and Social Media
of a mobile device and the speed and connec-
tivity. Very quickly mobile broadband will be just 
as fast as Internet connectivity.
United Future designs the mobile Web site for 
Holland America Line, which was developed to 
increase information and decrease the amount 
of confusion. Holland America Line really put a 
depth of information there because when book-
ing a cruise, people plan six months out. People 
who go on these cruises have to go through 
pages and pages of choices in advance, plan-
ning everything from being on the Veranda deck 
to the Lido deck and the 57 excursion choices.
Holland America was very fearful of having too 
good of an online experience because it didn’t 
want to disrupt its most important channel — 
travel agents. You never want to outsell your 
best salesmen. So United Future walked a very 
fine line between how much information to pro-
vide and how easy you could make a reserva-
tion or a conversion from researching a cruise 
to booking a cruise. United Future did such a 
good job that cruise bookings have gone up 
191 percent. And most surprising of all, instead 
of resenting and fearing it, the travel agents 
started using the site as a tool. They now use 
the site as a one-stop shop to be able to explain 
to their customers on the phone what the differ-
ence is between the Veranda and the Lido and 
to say, by the way, here’s your room. They have 
something to show the person in their office.
United Future is now building out the experi-
ence on the cruise. Now you can record your 
trip, not just with a video camera, but with your 
mobile device that’s with you all the time.
People forget, though, that consumers don’t 
adapt as well as companies would like them 
to. All this wonderful technology is out there, 
but how many people can take advantage of 
it? When does technology become a barrier? 
Companies have to make sure they aren’t over-
doing it.
When people encounter something while 
they’re out of their home or office and they 
have their phones with them, eight times out 
of ten, they go to their calendar function and 
write it down. Isn’t that strange? They add it to 
their to-do list. Your phone is your organizer. 
Philosophically, people still use the phone as 
an organizer, even though you can do all these 
things with it. People still instinctively come 
back to that initial use — it’s what people are 
trained or programmed to do. A 13 year old 
doesn’t do that with his phone, but that’s a dif-
ferent story.
When Scott is in client conversations and stra-
tegic discussions, so many times people say, 
“We need a mobile app. We need an iPhone 
app.” They saw the ads on TV, and they’re in 
their heads. The first question Scott asks is 
“What is it that you’re looking to achieve when 
the consumer uses that app?” Anything you 
want them to achieve, you can typically do it 
online, and if your Web site was semantic in 
nature, they could probably just type in your 
Web site.
What Scott tries to envision these days is what 
happens when advertising really goes to the 
mobile device. What’s acceptable? United 
Future accepts banners on the Web page; it 
accepts pre-rolls and post-rolls in online video, 
but they’re a little frustrating. Will you accept 
that on a mobile device?
Scott may not be the only one who thinks this 
way, but we say no. As a mobile user, it’s going 
to cost you money for the data. So why sit 
through a pre-roll or a post-roll or anything? You 
want access to information right now; Scott’s 
patience for advertising is teeny.
People skip commercials because the com-
mercials don’t mean anything to them. If a com-
mercial meant something to you, maybe you’d 
watch it. If you’re watching TV, you’re relaxed 
and in a casual mode. If you’re online, you’re 
(continued)

262
Part III: Multimedia, Marketing, and E-Commerce 
(continued)
in search mode. If you’re on mobile, you’re in a 
rush. What that means is that you don’t want to 
be annoyed with an ad unless it’s really, really 
relevant to you.
It’s all about finding your niche audience. 
Television has a place. You can get the word 
out and do a mass approach, a roadblock. 
If you have the money, someone can reach 
you.
But then the next step is paying attention to 
what happens next. Because ads are the busi-
ness of converting expectations: It’s not a 
lead until somebody’s interested, and it’s not a 
sale until someone’s been enticed and under-
stands enough about the product and probably 
researched three other places to come back 
and purchase it.
After you convert them, did you give them 
something to make them a loyalist and part 
of your brand community? Mobile is about 
loyalists.
That’s why mobile Web sites will become more 
and more important. After a customer decides 
to make a purchase, she’s going to be in the 
store handling the merchandise, and she’s 
going to do a last-second reality check, using 
her mobile phone.
Your mobile Web site has to validate that 
purchase.
The way you do that is to show them reviews 
and tell them that they’re making the right deci-
sion. Maybe there’s a service you can provide 
that provides more utility after the purchase is 
made — some added value.
The question then becomes how do people 
make this service on the mobile a loyalty ser-
vice rather than an advertisement? Scott won’t 
push ads on the mobile device. When you can 
do so much more on an interactive device like 
mobile, why settle for replicating the old TV 
interruptive advertising model? It’s the equiva-
lent of shovelware.

ellphone enthusiasts predict the day when your wallet, keys, and phone 
will all join together as the smartphones of the future fulfill all those 
functions in one. Outside James Bond movies, phones aren’t quite magical 
open-sesame devices yet, but increasingly, they’re turning into digital wallets.
For instance, cellphones are already taking on the functions of portable, vir-
tual ATMs and credit-card processing devices. In Japan, commuters pay their 
subway fares by swiping their phones over sensors on turnstile gates, and 
use them to buy snacks and drinks from vending machines or convenience 
stores. Workers in the Middle East are paid via credits sent to their mobile 
phone accounts, which they then can transfer easily to their families in other 
countries. And in Los Angeles, street vendors are using iPhones to process 
credit cards for the lunch crowd.
Setting up a system that turns phones into offshore bank accounts is a task 
far beyond the scope of this book, but it demonstrates how quickly mobile 
is changing everything about commerce. For our purposes, let’s define 
e-commerce as any kind of transaction that occurs via the Internet that 
involves money being transferred from one person, business, or organiza-
tion to another. The transaction can be as simple as a teenager buying a 99 
cent song on iTunes, or as complex as millions of donors around the world 
clicking a button to donate money in dozens of currencies to an international 
charity like the Red Cross.
M-commerce is essentially a subset of e-commerce, in that they both depend 
on the Internet to make the money go from one account to another. But what 
makes m-commerce different is that it can happen anywhere, not just in offices 
or on home computers. With m-commerce, people can take all kinds of actions 
involving money, such as transferring payments from bank accounts to mobile 
phones, from phones to bank accounts, and even from phones to phones.

264
Part III: Multimedia, Marketing, and E-Commerce 
In this chapter, we explore how mobile phones and other devices are increas-
ingly used to sell things and transfer money, and we tackle how to set up 
your mobile Web site so that your users can buy your products and services, 
subscribe to your news feed, or pay to download digital goods, such as songs 
and videos.
Looking at How Users Adapt 
to Mobile Commerce
The advantages of having mobile commerce (or m-commerce) on your site 
seem, at first glance, rather esoteric. More than ten years passed before 
people felt comfortable buying and paying for items on their computers at 
home (and in the office, when the boss doesn’t catch you on eBay). And still 
people tell scary stories about buying things online and then having their 
credit card numbers and identities stolen. Doing this over a phone, when 
(theoretically, at least) thieves can intercept radio signals, would seem to be 
a step further than most people are comfortable with.
And yet, the market indicates that m-commerce is growing rapidly:
 
✓ Retailers reported that sales to people using mobile phones were up 300 
percent over Christmas 2009, and that people weren’t just buying trin-
kets. Shoppers bought sailboats and Corvette sports cars for hundreds 
of thousands of dollars, using their phones to complete the transaction. 
Major chains, such as Pizza Hut, rolled out sites and apps that let you 
custom-build your pizza, type in the address you want it sent to, and pay 
for it from your phone.
 
✓ The worldwide market for m-commerce will hit about $120 billion by 
2015, according to ABI Research.
 
✓ M-commerce growth in the United States has been stunning; mobile 
shoppers spent $396 million in 2008, tripling to $1.2 billion in 2009.
 
✓ More than half of shoppers now use their phones to check prices in stores.
 
✓ Nearly one in five shoppers in the crucial 18- to 24-year-old demographic 
has used a phone to buy products.
 
The advantage of m-commerce is that your customers can impulse-buy wher-
ever they are, whenever the urge hits them. Your job as a Web developer is 
to make that process as safe and as smooth as possible so that they don’t 
think twice or feel creeped-out and abandon ship before they hit the Confirm 
Purchase button. Think of m-commerce as the equivalent of having operators 
standing by to take your order; the only differences are that these operators 
never sleep or take breaks, and after you go through the expense of setting 
them up properly, they just keep working.

265
 Chapter 11: Adding Mobile Commerce
Understanding the Basic Building Blocks 
of an M-Commerce Solution
Whether you sell just one thing or have a site chock-full of thousands of items 
of all shapes, sizes, and prices, each store must have some of the same ele-
ments. The following sections guide you through the basics of how online 
commerce services (both for mobile and for the desktop Web) work so that 
you can better understand your options. We also tell you what to look for 
when you design a shopping system for your Web-based business.
Creating a mobile shopping 
experience: The front end
This front end of your site is where your customers shop and pick out what 
they want to buy. Whether you sell one item with a simple Buy Now button or 
you design a sophisticated shopping cart, think of your m-commerce site as 
your virtual showroom.
 
Just like in traditional brick-and-mortar stores, your goods in your mobile 
store need to be displayed in a logical, attractive manner, and your store 
needs to be laid out in a way that’s clean and easy to navigate.
Everyone has wandered through a warehouse-style store at some point: You 
can easily get lost, the prices aren’t always marked clearly, and no one’s 
around to help you when you need them. Few things cost you more sales 
online than getting your customers lost in a sea of poorly organized links. 
You also don’t want visitors to question your credibility because they feel 
they’ve wandered into a crummy junk shop with the merchandise piled 
in heaps. Even if they find something they like, they can’t wait to get out. 
Remember: Design is about making the site attractive and easy to use.
Imagining your target customers
One of the most valuable things you can do before creating your store is to 
step back for a second and imagine your target customers (the people most 
likely to spend money on your products). Don’t just try to visualize who your 
target customers are — put yourself in their shoes. Where are they, and what 
are they doing when they come to your site on a cellphone? Anyone who’s 
going to spend money while browsing a store on their mobile device is prob-
ably in one of five situations:

266
Part III: Multimedia, Marketing, and E-Commerce 
 
✓ They’re looking for a special deal while they’re out and about. For 
example, a couple on a date just found out that the restaurant they 
planned on eating at is closed and the movie they wanted to watch 
is sold out. Now they just want to order some takeout, go home, and 
snuggle in front of the TV. So they do a GPS-enabled search and find that 
your place is within two blocks and will have their food waiting by the 
time they arrive.
 
✓ They’re in a critical situation. They absolutely need to buy your prod-
uct and close the deal as soon as possible. For example, a diehard 
sports fan just got your text alert that a whole section of seats to the 
Super Bowl just opened. However, the tickets are going fast and prob-
ably will be gone by the time she can rush home — unless she places a 
bid on your site right this instant via her mobile phone.
 
✓ They’re impulse shopping. Maybe they’ve trudged through snowdrifts 
past your billboard advertising tropical cruises for the last month. 
Today, the bus splashed them with a wave of freezing slush and muck. 
Shivering in their seats, they pull out their phones and punch in your 
travel agency’s Web address.
 
✓ They’re in-store bargain-hunters. Retailers are starting to notice that 
shoppers are whipping out their mobile phones and punching in prod-
uct names and details to make sure that they’re getting the best deal.
 
✓ They’re bored and killing time. A group of 15 year olds decides to see 
what the new super-exclusive designer sneakers you just got in look like 
and how many chores they may have to do to earn themselves a new pair.
In each case, immediacy is one of the driving factors behind customers 
making a purchase with their phones. People buy things for all sorts of rea-
sons, but when it comes to m-commerce, a lot boils down to just being in the 
right place, at the right time, with the right offer.
Following mobile design do’s and don’ts
What makes m-commerce so exciting is that the mobile Web puts your store 
in your customer’s pocket wherever they go. Before you get too excited by 
visions of round-the-clock shoppers, here are a few deadly design errors you 
need to avoid:
 
✓ Don’t cram too many things on your page. The screen size is small, and 
even if you have hundreds of things you want to offer, if you try to put 
them all in one space, your customers can’t figure out what they’re sup-
posed to click.
 
✓ Don’t use gimmicks, such as hokey animations and music to try to 
grab users’ attention. If they’ve made the effort to hit your mobile site, 
they’re already interested. But they’re also skittish — mobile shopping 
is still a new experience for most people. If your site looks like a 13-year-
old girl’s MySpace page, they’re probably not going to trust that their 
financial information is safe with you.

267
 Chapter 11: Adding Mobile Commerce
 
✓ Don’t get cute and hide the prices from people. Maybe your mobile 
customer is running up stairs, rushing into a meeting, or stopped at a 
traffic light. If they have to go through the whole checkout process only 
to find that your price isn’t what they thought it was, they may never 
come back.
Guide customers, with just a few options per screen, until they’re ready to 
make a buying decision. Mobile commerce in Japan is years ahead of the rest 
of the world; the online shopping site Rakuten is a particularly good example 
of how good mobile Web design can boost sales and profits. By designing for 
the mobile Web, they encouraged millions of users to shop using their mobile 
phones — and made hundreds of millions of dollars in profit.
The differences between the desktop experience and the mobile Web experi-
ence come into sharp focus when you look at how Rakuten appears when 
you navigate to the regular desktop site on a smartphone, as shown on the 
left side of Figure 11-1. Note how tiny the icons all look, how they all seem 
jumbled together, and how you can’t really read any of the links. On the right 
of Figure 11-1 is Rakuten’s site, as it appears when you go to the version that 
is optimized for the mobile platform. Note how having fewer choices (even if 
you can’t read Japanese) makes it easier to figure out where you’re supposed 
to click.

and mobile

Understanding your shopping cart needs
After your customers see your showroom and click through to read more 
detailed descriptions of your merchandise, you want to give them a shopping 
cart to put the stuff into. Why? Well, if you only allow people to buy one thing 
at a time, chances are they will buy only one thing and then leave.
If all you want to do is sell one thing at a time, add a PayPal Buy button or a 
simple Google Checkout Buy Now button and then you’re done. You can find 

268
Part III: Multimedia, Marketing, and E-Commerce 
instructions in the “Creating a simple PayPal Buy button” section later in this 
chapter. The steps for adding a Buy Now button with Google Checkout are 
very similar to the steps for PayPal.
If you want to sell more than one item, you need a shopping cart that allows 
your customers to add and remove items while they move through your 
site’s pages. Google and PayPal also offer a simple shopping cart solution 
that makes it easy to add these services with a minimal investment of time 
and no upfront costs. (See the section “Creating a simple shopping cart with 
Google Checkout,” later in this chapter. The steps for adding a PayPal shop-
ping cart are similar to Google Checkout.)
If you want a more sophisticated solution, consider one of the more 
advanced m-commerce options described in the “Comparing Mobile 
Commerce Solutions” section later in this chapter.
At the high end of these services, you’ll find sophisticated options, such as 
shopping carts that integrate with existing inventory systems and features 
that allow customers to make comparisons among products, set up bridal 
registries, view recommendations, and more. To see a list of options across 
all these levels, read the section “Comparing Mobile Commerce Solutions.” To 
read about more of the things you need to consider when choosing a shop-
ping cart, see the sidebar “What to consider when choosing an m-commerce 
solution,” later in this chapter.
Exchanging money with a checkout system
If everything else goes well, you ultimately guide your shoppers to the check-
out: The place where the key action — money comes out of their accounts 
and goes into yours — happens. As you might expect by now, this is also 
where most of the second thoughts (or cart abandonment) happen. If you’ve 
designed your site well, you will overcome your customer’s initial reservation 
to make a purchase and close the sale.
Your checkout must be as smooth and frictionless as possible; studies show 
that every 15 seconds of delay increase the chances of cart abandonment by 
as much as 25 percent. That is, if a whole minute passes for a mobile user 
(who moves around and has a short attention span) to get a response after 
clicking the Pay Now button, the odds of him just chucking the whole process 
approach 100 percent.
 
If your customers don’t see what’s happening, their fear overcomes their 
desire. You must not only use Internet-based security measures that use 
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology (see the section “Securing transactions 
with your customers”), but also prominently reassure your customers that 
their financial information won’t get stolen or misused. Nobody wants to risk 
a virtual credit card thief buying a pallet of yak vitamins just to buy a vintage 
concert T-shirt. We discuss this in a little more depth in the upcoming sec-
tions that discuss the back end of a site.

269
 Chapter 11: Adding Mobile Commerce
A good checkout system needs to
 
✓ Total the cost of all the items in the potential customer’s shopping cart 
including any tax and shipping costs.
 
✓ Allow the customer to choose shipping options. Customers like ship-
ping options — FedEx, delivery vans, in-store pickup, friendly kayakers, 
whatever.
 
✓ Send the customer tracking information and a confirmation e-mail. 
Pay attention to that confirmation e-mail because it’s a great way to 
entice customers to come back and shop again, rate their transaction 
efficiency, or receive discounts by referring their friends.
 
Do some research. Go to your competitor’s online stores and go through the 
buying process on as many mobile phones as you can get your hands on. 
Go to big online sites that have invested millions in perfecting the shopping 
experience, such as Amazon, eBay, Dell, and so on, and ask yourself questions 
every step of the way. Do you like the way the product’s pictures are dis-
played and how the ad copy is written? What can you do better? What do you 
need to include? Take careful notes. If you start out armed with a clear vision 
of what you want and how you want to do it, you have a much better chance 
of coming out with a store that you like.
Amazon’s shopping cart, shown in Figure 11-2, is a good model. This cart 
has both a large image of the item and a link to more images. The price is 
prominently displayed with a link to immediately check out and pay. And at 
the bottom of the cart is a suggestion to try to sell the customer some other 
items that go nicely with their selection. All the links are clear and easily 
understood, and the navigation at the bottom of the screen is unobtrusive.

Part III: Multimedia, Marketing, and E-Commerce 
Working behind the scenes: The back end
Broadly speaking, the back end of your m-commerce site includes all the 
things that your customers don’t see. Think of this as your stockroom where 
you store all your stuff on shelves, next to filing cabinets and order sheets. 
You use the back-end features of your m-commerce solution to
 
✓ Enter product and pricing information
 
✓ Manage shipping and tax options
 
✓ Configure any other features provided by the m-commerce service 
you use
The back end of your m-commerce site also has to integrate smoothly with 
your payment solution. If you choose a service like the Google Merchant 
(which is part of Google Checkout), you get everything you need in one easy 
package. If you want a more customizable shopping cart that offers mobile 
services, consider Magento (www.magento.com), but keep in mind that 
you have to integrate the cart features with a transaction service yourself 
(see the section “Comparing Mobile Commerce Solutions” for more on this 
option).
Google and PayPal offer many levels of service, so you can use Google or 
PayPal as an all-in-one solution for simple shopping sites, or you can use 
Google or PayPal just to handle the transactions if you use a more sophisti-
cated shopping cart, such as Zen Cart, for the front end. 
Securing transactions with your customers
Not to sound like a broken record, but security is one of the biggest hurdles 
m-commerce has to clear. Your customers watch TV ads about having their 
identities and credit card numbers stolen (particularly the ones that show 
little old ladies chortling in some gruff man’s voice, bragging about all the 
expensive stuff he scammed by stealing granny’s identity).
Here are the three main goals of security:
 
✓ Protect your customer: Customers who don’t get robbed are much more 
likely to come back . . . and still have money in their pockets when they 
arrive.
 
✓ Protect the merchant: You want to keep your site from being used to 
launder money or having all your products drop-shipped to a P.O. Box in 
some prince’s name.
 
✓ Protect yourself: If you’re a Web designer creating m-commerce sites for 
clients, you don’t want an angry customer coming after you with a law-
suit because someone hacked the system you designed.

271
 Chapter 11: Adding Mobile Commerce
 
If you’re a designer and don’t take security seriously, there could be legal ram-
ifications. If credit card numbers and personal identities are stolen, expensive 
lawsuits could result. Depending on the kinds of contracts you develop with 
clients, you may be liable. Consult an attorney for the best way to protect your 
business and consider investing in a business insurance policy that covers 
online commerce.
 
The standard technology to protect transactions is Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). 
All the information sent between a computer or mobile phone and the pay-
ment site is encrypted. Options range from 128- to 256-bit encryption, but 
128-bit is more than enough for most businesses. Banks and brokerage houses 
that transfer billions of dollars around the world use 256-bit security, but they 
pay a high price for that level of security, as well as the bandwidth and com-
puting power that go along with a site built to securely manage such high-end 
services.
Think of mobile security this way: You don’t need to hire a helicopter gun-
ship to hover over your business to fend off robbers, but an alarm system 
and a good insurance policy are well worth the expense. Be safe, but not so 
paranoid you blow all your potential profits on security.
Inventory tracking and adjustment
The process of tracking and controlling inventory is something you’re prob-
ably familiar with in the brick-and-mortar world, but in m-commerce, the pro-
cess can get tricky. Here are some of the essential inventory functions to any 
good m-commerce system:
 
✓ You can add new products and services easily.
 
✓ You can adjust prices easily and have those adjustments applied glob-
ally to any mention of the same product.
 
✓ You can take things off the virtual shelves if you run out or need to do 
a recall for some reason. Make sure you can do this quickly and effi-
ciently before you need to do so urgently. If you depend on a third-party 
solution to create and manage your online store, you may have to have 
someone else do this for you and you may not be able to control how 
long it takes them to get around to it.
 
✓ You get good records and can track the ups and downs in your inven-
tory sales so you can figure out when to raise or lower prices or order 
more products from your suppliers.
 
✓ You have customer relationship management (CRM) features. A good 
CRM system tracks what your customers looked at, what they added to 
their shopping carts, and what they actually checked out and paid for, 
and then follows up and asks the customers how they felt about what 
they bought and allows them to write (hopefully glowing) reviews about 
you. Depending on how elaborate you want to get, and what your sales 
volume looks like, these services can get expensive. But when you can 

272
Part III: Multimedia, Marketing, and E-Commerce 
track what each customer buys and how they felt about it, you can start 
doing things (such as recommending related products and services) 
that can really increase sales.
Calculating taxes, shipping, and handling
After your customers buy your goods, the back end of your system needs 
some way of getting that merchandise to them. Whether you offer digital 
downloads, package your products in bubble wrap and cardboard boxes, or 
use a pizza delivery scooter, make sure it’s clear to your customers what, 
if anything, you’re charging them for delivery. If you offer multiple choices, 
such as rush services, make sure the m-commerce service you choose 
includes features to handle different shipping options (some are directly con-
nected to common services, such as UPS and FedEx, to make things even easier).
Another charge that you need to be able to track and record is the amount 
of sales taxes you collect. Trust me, if you ignore this step, your accountant 
(not to mention the IRS) will have some very interesting things to say to you. 
And charging taxes isn’t as easy as you might think because in most cases, 
you only need to charge taxes from those who live in your same state, and 
depending on your state, those taxes may vary from county to county. This 
can get complicated fast, and to ensure you’re in compliance in your state, 
check your state business and sales tax requirements.
What to consider when choosing 
an m-commerce solution
There are a lot of factors that should go into 
choosing which m-commerce solution is best 
for your business, some of which may not have 
occurred to you. While we can’t possibly antici-
pate all the needs of your business, the following 
are some questions you should answer for your-
self; having a clear picture in your head of what is 
important can help you sort through the dizzying 
array of options in m-commerce solutions.
 ✓ How secure is the service against hacking, 
viruses, fraudulent transactions, and data 
corruption?
 ✓ What’s the process and cost for rebuilding 
a store if your data becomes corrupted? 
Keep in mind you may be responsible for 
not only your data but the data and security 
of your customers.
 ✓ Can you install, set up, customize, and 
administer the store yourself or do you 
need to hire a Web designer, programmer, 
or e-commerce specialist to help you?
 ✓ Is the store scalable? Can you add as many 
products as you like or is there a limit?
 ✓ How many customers can the system 
manage at a time? How does the service 
manage spikes in traffic?

273
 Chapter 11: Adding Mobile Commerce
 ✓ Can you easily import your current data into 
the system and then export your data at a 
later time?
 ✓ Does the software have application pro-
gramming interfaces (APIs) that link to your 
legacy applications for inventory manage-
ment and financial records? Will the soft-
ware interface with the popular content 
management systems (CMS) or CRM?
 ✓ Does the store include a virtual shopping 
cart that allows online shoppers to browse 
through your store’s inventory as well as 
add or remove items before logging in or 
checking out and paying for the items?
 ✓ Does the service handle all the different 
kinds of products, services, and digital 
goods you want to sell?
 ✓ Does the service support automatic reoc-
curring subscription payments? This is 
important if, say, you want to charge a 
monthly fee and automatically bill custom-
ers each month.
 ✓ Can you organize your products the way you 
want them within the shopping cart system? 
For example, can you group your products 
into categories and subcategories?
 ✓ Does the service support multiple sales tax 
levels and shipping cost calculations?
 ✓ What payment types (MasterCard, Visa, 
American Express, and so on) does the 
service support? Can you set up the system 
to work with your bank directly if you prefer 
to use its transaction services, or are you 
required to use a particular payment gate-
way or payment processing service?
 ✓ Can you modify the visual look of your store 
with customizable templates, and what 
additional software features are available?
 ✓ Does the store have integrated promotional 
tools? For example, can you easily offer 
sales on selected items or send coupons 
and customer notices via e-mail?
 ✓ Does the service support social networking 
and customer product reviews?
 ✓ Can you generate detailed reports of cus-
tomer activity, inventory levels, and other 
data?
 ✓ What are the options to administer your 
store, such as processing orders, pricing, 
and modifying inventory? Some e-com-
merce platforms offer Web browser access 
whereas others may require separate soft-
ware for each computer.
 ✓ How popular is the software, and is it time-
tested or is it a new product without much 
history?
 ✓ Is the program an open-source solution 
(that is, it’s free but may not have a com-
pany behind it that provides customer 
support)? If the service is open source, 
how active and responsive is the support 
community in addressing security patches, 
design templates, and software feature 
add-ons?
 ✓ What is the total cost of ownership and 
upkeep of your store? When you factor in 
all the expenses (not just the setup and 
transaction fees), what will the store really 
cost? Make sure to include costs for cus-
tomization, Web hosting, updates, and cus-
tomer support.

Comparing Mobile Commerce Solutions
When adding shopping carts and other e-commerce services to your mobile 
site, you can choose from many options. Many familiar brands, such as 
PayPal and Google, have made major efforts to migrate their online commerce 
technology to the mobile platform. And a crop of new companies are emerg-
ing, with dedicated mobile services that include everything from m-commerce 
to short messaging service (SMS, also known as text-messaging), mobile 
coupons, and other mobile features.
Choosing from four main flavors 
of mobile commerce solutions
With mobile commerce, you have a wide range of options. The following 
helps you appreciate the four main ways you can add m-commerce to your 
site, each with its own pros and cons:
 
✓ A Buy button or simple shopping cart: Google and PayPal offer one-
click Buy buttons that make it easy to add the ability to sell one product, 
service, or digital good, such as a subscription or e-book, to your 
Web site.
 
• Pros: You can complete this task in a few minutes and there are 
no upfront costs. Plus, everything you need is in one package, so 
you don’t have to worry about setting up credit card processing or 
other transaction services.
 
• Cons: You can sell only one item at a time, there are no shopping 
cart features, and you have few options about the way this button 
looks on your site.
 
✓ A wide range of shopping carts combine mobile features with a pay-
ment service: At the low end, Google and PayPal (see Figure 11-3) offer 
simple shopping carts in an all-in-one package. More sophisticated Web-
based shopping carts, including Magento (www.magento.com), offer 
robust features but they come at a price, and not just in upfront costs 
and transaction fees. High-end shopping cart services can be complex 
to install and set up, but if you sell a lot of items, or need your online 
system to be integrated with your brick-and-mortar inventory system, 
you may find them well worth the cost. Dedicated shopping carts also 
require a separate transaction service to handle payment processing. 
For this part of the process you can use the transaction services provided 
by Google or PayPal. You may also be able to handle transaction process-
ing with your own bank if it offers these kinds of merchant services.
 
• Pros: You can better control how your merchandise is displayed, 
manage more products more easily, and even integrate online and 

275
 Chapter 11: Adding Mobile Commerce
offline inventory management. Some shopping cart services offer 
added features to help manage customers, product discounts, cou-
pons, and so on.
 
• Cons: Using a shopping cart service requires considerable work 
to set up the software on your server and integrate it with your 
Web site. These services are also more expensive and generally 
only worth the added cost and effort if you sell at least a dozen 
products.
 
✓ Dedicated mobile shopping carts: A growing list of shopping carts and 
m-commerce services are designed specifically to work on the mobile 
Web. Some of the newest m-commerce companies are set up to do all 
the work for you; others offer shopping carts you can design or custom-
ize and build into your site yourself.
 
• Pros: Designed from the start for the mobile platform, you can 
expect companies such as asknet (www.asknet.com) and mPoria 
(www.mporia.com) to provide solid support for mobile devices 
and understand the unique challenges of the mobile Web.
 
• Cons: This is an exciting area of the mobile Web, but like any new 
technology, you won’t find much history behind some of these 
companies, so it can be harder to compare customer reviews or 
find third-party help or tech support.
 
✓ A completely custom-built cart with your own back end: This is for the 
intrepid mobile Web designer only. If you want complete control over 
the look and functionality of your m-commerce site, as well as control 
over how the checkout and money-transfer process is handled, you can 
build your own integrated solution from the ground up. Most likely, you 
would need a team of experts to handle all the complex issues involved 
in such an undertaking.
 
• Pros: You have total control over the look and feel of the shopping 
cart. If something goes wrong, you can take matters into your own 
hands to fix it, rather than relying on someone else’s customer ser-
vice to pick up the phone or respond to e-mails. All the data about 
your customers and what they buy is under your control.
 
• Cons: You have to take care of every little nitpicky detail. If you 
miss something, only you can fix it. And if you’re away and the site 
goes down while you’re on vacation, you’re out of business (at 
least until you can access your site again). You will need to have 
your own mechanism for transferring the funds, and maintain your 
own secure database for your customer’s financial data.
 
Mobile commerce is evolving so rapidly that the companies listed here 
may well have added new features by the time you read this. Visit www.
MobileWebDesignBlog.com for updates to the providers and services fea-
tured in this chapter and elsewhere in the book.

For this chapter, we focus on the two simplest options. The nearby sidebar 
“Developing a custom system for mobile commerce” can help you get started 
with a custom solution if that’s the route you need to go.
 
No matter what route you choose, the key points in the earlier section 
“Understanding the Basic Building Blocks of an M-Commerce Solution” apply 
because all m-commerce sites have some basic things in common.
Checking out m-commerce 
payment solutions
Most sites are best served by the latest online m-commerce tools, which 
combine the flexibility of displaying merchandise on your own site with 
offloading the heavy-duty banking and money-transfer functions to close the 
deal. Most Web designers agree that the best way for individuals and small 
to mid-size businesses to add m-commerce is to use a company that includes 
a shopping cart and transaction service or to combine a dedicated shopping 
cart with a transaction service. In this section, we introduce you to compa-
nies that offer m-commerce services.

277
 Chapter 11: Adding Mobile Commerce
Amazon Payments
http://payments.amazon.com
This powerful and flexible payment engine allows users who are already 
familiar with, and trust, the Amazon brand to purchase goods from your 
Web site using their Amazon customer ID. The advantage is that Amazon has 
established itself as one of the biggest retailers on the Web, and its techno-
logical backbone is very strong.
The downside, however, is that your customers have to already have an 
account with Amazon; otherwise, they’re forced to create one when they 
make their first payment. As you can see in Figure 11-4, the Amazon brand 
is all over every page (on the buttons, in the colors, and in the typography), 
which helps your customers know they’re dealing with a reputable firm — 
but that also means Amazon promotes itself all over your site.
Still, if you sell digital downloads, such as ringtones, MP3s, videos, or pic-
tures, Amazon’s payment and pricing system is innovative and robust. And 
if you already sell your stuff on Amazon, it’s very easy to integrate the links 
and payment system on your Web site because customers who have already 
paid with Amazon at your m-commerce store can buy with just one click. The 
Amazon site has detailed instructions for both amateurs looking for the sim-
plest solution and seasoned developers looking to customize.
Developing a custom system for mobile commerce
If you truly want to create your own custom-
built site, look for more advanced books or 
other training specific to developing shopping 
carts, or consider paying for one of the services 
described in the “Comparing Mobile Commerce 
Solutions” section or hiring a contractor to take 
care of it for you.
To create such a system, here’s what you need:
 ✓ You need to know how to use sophisticated 
functions in a dynamic programming language 
or technology, such as ASP.NET or PHP.
 ✓ You need the ability to integrate your system 
into a payment system in ways that require 
managing a secure server, SSL certificates, 
and other settings on your Web server.
Because all that gets complicated quickly, 
some great services solve all your problems 
at once, and if you like that approach, decide 
how much you want to be able to customize the 
design and what the services cost.
Major e-commerce sites, such as Amazon or 
eBay, have spent millions on developing custom 
shopping functions for their sites. If all you want 
is the simplest solution, you can list your goods 
on those sites and then simply include a link to 
that item on your mobile site. That’s the simplest 
option, and the initial investment is minimal, but 
many people outgrow that option pretty quickly.

278

iTunes
www.apple.com/itunes
As of this writing, iTunes is still limited in what it sells, restricting anyone 
using the service to music, videos, and iPhone applications. You must submit 
your digital goods to iTunes for review before they can be listed on the site, 
and Apple’s approval process can take a few days or even weeks.
But with more than 100 million credit card accounts on file (outnumbering 
even the 94 million Amazon customers or the 75 million PayPal customers), 
speculation is rife that Apple will extend its iTunes checkout processing tech-
nology to allow merchants to sell their stuff to customers who want to pay 
via their existing iTunes accounts. And iTunes provides digital goods for the 
iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad, so the combined audience is significant.
PayPal
www.paypal.com
PayPal is highly customizable and offers a wide range of services, broad 
international e-commerce support, and everything from simple one-click 
buttons to high-end transaction services you can integrate into most of the 
popular shopping cart services.
At the high end, you need quite a bit of technical coding skills to tweak 
PayPal’s API to work with third-party shopping carts, but PayPal has been 

279
 Chapter 11: Adding Mobile Commerce
around for a long time, so you can draw on a large international developer 
network when you need help. At the low end, you can easily add PayPal 
buttons. See the section “Creating a simple PayPal Buy button,” later in 
this chapter.
As with Amazon, the PayPal brand is the one your customers see on each 
Buy button when it comes time to make their payments.
PayPal has also created some extremely powerful and extensible technol-
ogy to allow people to transform their cellphones into wallets. And because 
PayPal is owned by eBay, the integration between the two services is quite 
good. If you’re selling your items through your eBay store, this may be all 
you need.
PayPal has also introduced an app for the iPhone that allows users to trans-
fer money directly from one phone to the other, simply by bumping together 
the two phones.
Google Checkout
https://checkout.google.com/sell
Google has spent enormous amounts of time and money developing a whole 
host of other products and services to go along with its core business of 
being the top search engine on the planet. We discuss setting up Google 
Checkout later in this chapter because of the wide panoply of other products 
and services that Google has — most especially Google’s recent acquisition 
of the mobile advertising company AdMob for $750 million. Spending that 
kind of money is a clear indication that Google takes the mobile Web seri-
ously, and that it’s going to continue to devote significant time and resources 
to ensuring that its existing products are mobile-friendly.
Google Checkout is easy to set up, and because it piggybacks on Google’s 
massive network of server farms, it loads quickly — no matter where on 
earth your user accesses your m-commerce site from (not an insignificant 
consideration as billions of people come online via their mobile devices).
Like PayPal, you can use Google Checkout to add a Buy Now button to your 
site, to set up a simple shopping cart and transaction package, or to use 
Google for the transaction processing in combination with any number of 
shopping carts that are designed to work with Google. (Some shopping carts 
can be integrated with PayPal, Google, or both if you want to give customers 
the option.)
Similar to Amazon, if you use Google Checkout, the downside is that your 
customers have to already have an account with Google; otherwise, they’re 
forced to create one when they make their first payment. The Google brand 
is what your customers will see when they make their payments; the but-
tons will have the Google logo on them, the color scheme will look like the 

280
Part III: Multimedia, Marketing, and E-Commerce 
color scheme that is used by Google, the words “Fast checkout through 
Google” will appear on the screen, along with a link that says “What is Google 
Checkout?” and leads to a page that is all about Google Checkout. Another 
possible downside for you may be that Google Checkout doesn’t support 
currency in as many countries as PayPal. At the time of this writing, Google 
Checkout accepts U.S. dollars, euros, and British pounds sterling, but expect 
that list to grow over time.
Dozens of e-commerce shopping cart providers have made a special effort 
to make sure that they integrate cleanly with Google Checkout. If you want 
to use a more sophisticated shopping cart than the one provided by Google, 
you can view Google’s recommended list of third-party vendors in the 
Integration Partners section on its Web site at checkout.google.com/
seller/integrate_cart.html.
 
If you use Google Checkout, Google offers a couple other features that can tie 
into your Google Checkout system:
 
✓ Google also has a wizard that allows you to easily convert a Google Docs 
spreadsheet into a shopping cart. If you have a Google ID, you can use 
Google Docs to create a spreadsheet via the Web. Basically, in Google 
Docs, you fill the spreadsheet with any data you want to include about 
your products, including descriptions, pictures, pricing info, and so on. 
Then, run the wizard at https://storegadgetwizard.appspot.
com/storegadgetwizard/ to convert your spreadsheet into a 
shopping cart.
 
✓ Google Analytics allows you to track page traffic information, such as 
how many users come to your site, which items are most popular, and 
how long visitors spend on each page.
asknet
www.asknet.com
This large, international e-commerce company is based in Germany. asknet 
offers custom-built mobile sites and high-end m-commerce.
asknet is partnered with many Internet security companies and software 
retailers, and the company specializes in handling m-commerce across 
international boundaries. asknet provides support for multiple currencies, 
tax laws, delivery of goods, and customer tracking. Videos on their site (see 
Figure 11-5) explain how their service works.
asknet also has a network of warehouses that can handle fulfillment, so you 
can use it to store your merchandise and handle shipping around the world. 
asknet even burns CDs/DVDs, applies your labels, sticks them into jewel 
cases, and delivers them to your customers if you sell digital merchandise. 
As you might expect, asknet is far from the cheapest solution; it doesn’t even 
list its prices on its site, but you can contact asknet for more information.

CardinalCommerce
www.cardinalcommerce.com
Another high-end company that specializes in constructing the back-end 
payment solutions for major multinational corporations (see Figure 11-6), 
CardinalCommerce has made mobile a key part of its strategy.
CardinalCommerce’s expertise centers on creating secure mobile banking and 
bill payment platforms for which it’s been granted multiple original patents.
CardinalCommerce works with companies like Visa and MasterCard to 
build debit-based payment sites, and with international banks to develop 
identification and authorization systems for money transfers. Because 
CardinalCommerce built m-commerce sites for companies like SkyMall, 20th 
Century Fox, and Secure Vault, it obviously can handle many currencies. We 
assume this is one of the more expensive options, but CardinalCommerce 
doesn’t publish its price list on its Web site.
mPoria
www.mporia.com
Designed from the ground up for the mobile Web, mPoria offers many great 
features, including secure checkout, site reporting, and real-time inventory 
management. This is one of the only dedicated mobile shopping carts we’ve 
found that you can customize and update yourself. And with prices starting 
at $20 per month, it’s one of the most cost-effective options.

282
Part III: Multimedia, Marketing, and E-Commerce 
 
Figure 11-6: 
Cardinal-
Commerce 
offers

mPoria is a service for small to mid-level businesses that want to dip their 
toes into m-commerce but don’t want to invest thousands just to get started. 
Prices range from $20 per month to $100 per month, based on the number of 
products in your online store. The pricing is based on 20–700 items per store.
mPoria offers a wizard that guides you through creating your own 
m-commerce portal, but it has some limits on how much you can custom-
ize the service. mPoria does have an automated process to help you build 
Open-source shopping carts for mobile
Many Web sites already use popular open-
source shopping carts, including Zen Cart 
(www.zen-cart.com) and OS Commerce 
(www.oscommerce.com). Because they 
are open-source, they are free to download, but 
many people make money by charging to take 
the plain cart and make it look good.
The Web is full of design shops that make it their 
business to construct templates and themes 
that allow businesses to change the look and 
layout of their online stores. Some sites offer 
mobile store templates, but the forums and 
bulletin boards of the open-source community 
are full of complaints from people who have 
tried to use these plug-ins. People have found 
that these templates either break their stores 
or require far more technical expertise than 
advertised.
However, thousands of software developers 
and coders are working on this problem, so if 
you already have a popular shopping cart like 
one of the above, plug-ins that you could try 
with your existing e-commerce solution may be 
hitting the Web every day.

283
 Chapter 11: Adding Mobile Commerce
the site yourself (see Figure 11-7). However, the list of phones that are sup-
ported by mPoria’s GoMobile! Sites (the sites that they custom-build for 
their clients) is incomplete, and it handles only U.S. dollars as a currency 
(although that may change as the company grows). At the higher levels of 
service, mPoria offers inventory tracking and other CRM tools.

Setting Up Commerce 
on Your Mobile Site
In this section, we guide you step by step through the process of setting 
up m-commerce with popular and easy-to-use services. You begin with the 
simplest option — adding Buy buttons with the popular PayPal service. You 
also discover how to create a basic shopping cart with Google Checkout. We 
guide you through the process of adding your Buy button or shopping cart to 
your mobile Web site using Dreamweaver and WordPress.
 
Both Google Checkout and PayPal offer simple Buy buttons, as well as shop-
ping cart features, making it easy for anyone to sell products on a Web site 
with no upfront costs and a competitive transaction fee. Why would you 
choose Google over PayPal or vice versa? Two key differences: Google has a 
nicer interface design, but it doesn’t support as many foreign currencies as 
PayPal. The PayPal interface is a bit clunky: Each time a user ads a product 
to the shopping cart, they are sent off to the PayPal site and have to navigate 
back to your site to add more products. However, you can send products to 
more countries using PayPal.

284
Part III: Multimedia, Marketing, and E-Commerce 
Creating a simple PayPal Buy button
The simplest and quickest option if you want to sell only a few products or 
services on your Web site is to create a PayPal button for each item you want 
to sell. Follow these steps:
 
1. Open your browser and navigate to www.paypal.com.
 
 If you have a PayPal account, log in here. If you don’t have an account, 
click on the Sign Up link to establish an account, and follow PayPal’s 
easy online instructions. Depending on what level of account you want 
to sign up for, you will need a valid credit card and your merchant 
account information handy.
 
2. Click on the Merchant Services tab.
 
 A page will open with many links to all the various actions you can take 
with your PayPal account, as well as links to various resources to help 
you run your online business.
 
3. Click on the Website Payments Standard link in the box on the left 
side of the page.
 
 The Website Payments Standard: Overview page opens (see Figure 11-8). 
This page allows you to choose from a couple other options, but for 
now, stick with creating a button for just one item at a time. PayPal also 
offers a Website Payments Pro service, but this requires that you reg-
ister for a business account with PayPal and that you use an integrated 
shopping cart or build one with PayPal’s APIs.
 
4. Below the Sell Single Items heading, click the Create One Now link.
 
 The Create PayPal Payment Button page opens with fields in it for the 
description of your item.
 
5. Below Choose a button type, choose Buy Now from the drop-down list.
 
 You can also create a payment button to sell your services, set up a sub-
scription or recurring billing process, collect a donation, or buy a gift 
certificate. In this example, we make a simple button to sell one item.
 
6. Type the item name in the Item Name field.
 
 The optional Item ID field allows you to enter a tracking code for the 
item you’re selling, if you want to use that number in your spreadsheets 
or inventory programs.
 
7. In the Shipping section, fill in the amount you charge for the shipping 
and handling of your item.
 
8. In the Tax section, fill in the amount of sales tax and other applicable 
taxes you charge.
 
9. Choose how you want to be notified when someone has bought 
your item.

285
 Chapter 11: Adding Mobile Commerce
 
 You can be notified through your secure merchant account. If you select 
this option, your e-mail address doesn’t appear in the button’s HTML 
code. This may or may not be important to you. Some merchants want 
to appear as transparent and open as possible; others are afraid of 
having their e-mail inboxes overflow with spam.
 
 If you choose to use your PayPal e-mail address, you receive a notifica-
tion in your e-mail inbox every time someone buys something from you 
with this PayPal button.
 
10. Click the Create Button button.
 
 The You’ve Created Your Button page opens. In a panel in the middle of 
the page is the code for your PayPal button. Don’t worry that the code 
looks like a lot of gobbledygook. You don’t have to type this in anywhere.
 
11. Click the Select Code button to select the button code.
 
 The code is highlighted.
 
12. Press Ctrl+C (on a Mac, Ô+C) to copy the code.
 
 You aren’t done yet. . . .
 
13. Depending on what you use to create your Web site, skip to the sec-
tion “Adding a shopping cart to WordPress,” or “Adding a shopping 
cart with Dreamweaver,” later in this chapter. Start with Step 1 in 
each section.

Creating a simple shopping 
cart with Google Checkout
Because so many people already use Gmail, Google Docs, or some other 
Web-based Google product, integrate Google Checkout. If you already have 
a Google account, you’re halfway there. Also, Google Checkout has a special 
integration with Google AdSense, so you can easily advertise your products.
 
Make sure that you have handy some basic information about your products 
before you proceed further. You need to know the names of your items, their 
prices, what options are available (size, color, weight, materials, and so on), 
and the URL where the picture of that item appears on your Web site. After 
you have that info, follow these steps:
 
1. Open your browser and navigate to http://checkout.google.com/
sell.
 
 The sign-in page opens.
 
2. Type your e-mail address and password.
 
 If you’ve used Gmail, your username may already appear; if so, just type 
your password.
 
3. Click the Sign In button and then follow the steps to either use an 
existing account or create a new one.
 
 The Google Checkout page opens.
 
4. Click on the Tools tab.
 
 The Integrate Your Website with Google Checkout page opens.
 
5. In the Google Checkout sign-in screen, enter your e-mail address and 
password, and then click the Sign In and Continue button.
 
 The Tell Us about Your Business page opens. One of the somewhat 
annoying tics of Google Checkout is that it prompts you to enter your 
username and password at every turn. You may be prompted during 
several steps along the way to re-enter this information. Some of that is 
because Google times-out the sessions with Google Checkout to prevent 
you from leaving the screen open on your computer when you walk 
away from it and allowing someone else to quickly drain your accounts 
or hijack your site.
 
6. Type the contact information, public contact information, and financial 
information for your business into the boxes provided on the page.
 
7. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and select the I Agree to the 
Terms of Service check box.
 
 The Signup Complete page opens.

287
 Chapter 11: Adding Mobile Commerce
 
 Note: Read through the Terms of Service. You must agree to them if you 
want to continue and use the service.
 
8. Click the Google Checkout Shopping Cart link on the right side of 
the page.
 
 A page opens (see Figure 11-9) with fields for you to enter the details of 
your product.
 
9. Choose from the following product types:
 
• Simple means that there’s only one product, with no other options 
or prices, such as an antique vase.
 
• With Multiple Options enables you to let your customers choose 
multiple options that are all the same price for a product, such as a 
T-shirt that can be white, blue, or black.
 
• With Multiple Prices enables you to take a basic item and charge 
different prices, depending on the options that the customer 
chooses. This is the option shown in Figure 11-9 in which you can 
buy the snaggletoothed tabby with or without his jester’s cap, 
which of course costs much more.
 
10. Enter a product name in the Title field.
 
11. (Optional) Enter the URL where the image of your product appears on 
your Web site.

 Adding the image’s URL causes a small thumbnail of the item to appear 
next to the item title and price in the shopping cart when your customer 
clicks to purchase it. Because this is just a little extra flourish, don’t feel 
like you have to do this if it gets difficult or time-consuming.
 
a. To get the URL, navigate to where the item appears on your site and 
then right-click (on a Mac, Command+click) the photo of the item.
 
 A menu opens with options that allow you to do many things with 
the photo.
 
b. Click Copy Image Location in the drop-down menu and then navigate 
back to the Google Checkout page.
 
c. Click in the Image URL field and press Ctrl+V (on a Mac, 
Command+V) to paste the image URL into the field.
 
12. (Optional) Enter the options in the fields next to the words Option 1 
and Option 2.
 
 The default fields are Small and Large, but you can type whatever you 
want. If you have many options for the item, click the Add an Option 
link and keep typing until all the sizes, colors, time lengths, or whatever 
other variables your item has are covered.
 
13. Enter the price.
 
 Next to each option is a field for the price associated with that option. 
Click the fields and then type the prices.
 
14. Test your changes in the Preview box.
 
 You can see what your shopping cart will look like by clicking the but-
tons in the Preview box. If you spot an error, go back through the previ-
ous steps and re-enter the correct information.
 
15. When you have the description the way you want it, select the Yes, 
I Have Configured My Account to Accept Unsigned Shopping Carts 
check box and be sure to configure your account at some point.
 
 If you haven’t configured your account yet, you can come back and do it 
later; just make sure to select the check box here.
 
 Because the Google Checkout shopping cart works entirely in the Web 
browser, a visitor to your site can alter the pricing in Google Checkout 
when she places an order. Unfortunately, Google can’t protect the secret 
key needed to sign a shopping cart, but you can get around this limita-
tion by letting the shopping cart work without being signed.
 
 To accept unsigned carts:
 
a. Click the Settings tab and then click the Integration link on the left 
side of the page.

289
 Chapter 11: Adding Mobile Commerce
 
b. Deselect the My Company Will Only Post Digitally Signed Carts check 
box and then click the Save button.
 
16. To generate the code to add to your Web page, click the Create Button 
Code button.
 
 A page opens with two boxes of code generated by Google. The top box 
contains the code that needs to be copied into your page where you 
want the button to appear.
 
17. Select the code and press Ctrl+C (on a Mac, Command+C).
 
 The next step depends on whether you sell your items from a blog, such 
as WordPress, or from a static Web page that you’ve designed with a 
program, such as Dreamweaver. The bottom box contains the code that 
creates the cart; it needs to be pasted into the bottom of each HTML 
page, which we address in the two following sections.
 
18. Repeat these steps for each item in your store.
 
 You have to go through these steps for each separate store item.
Adding a shopping cart to WordPress
Many site owners are migrating away from having a collection of static pages 
or using expensive, custom-made content management systems. Instead, 
they’re opting for open-source solutions like WordPress. Yes, WordPress 
started as a free blogging-software solution; however, its widespread use has 
spurred legions of developers around the world to customize its source code 
to make it do all sorts of wonderful things.
When you use WordPress for your shopping cart, you need to know the pros 
and cons:
 
✓ Pros: WordPress allows a site owner to quickly and easily update the 
site’s content; as the saying goes, “If you can type an e-mail, you can 
write a blog post.” Adding the shopping cart buttons you create in the 
previous two sections to a WordPress blog is as easy as cutting and 
pasting.
 
✓ Con: Adjusting the look and functionality of a WordPress site can be 
tricky and requires expert knowledge of the programming language PHP.
To copy and paste button code into a WordPress blog post, follow the steps 
here. (If you use another CMS, such as Joomla!, Drupal, Movable Type, or 
Blogger, you can still use the basic concepts explained here to make the but-
tons show up next to your items.)

1. Open a new tab in your browser and navigate to your blog’s 
Dashboard.
 
 This is the page where you compose new posts, control which widgets 
appear in your sidebars, or adjust your site’s theme.
 
2. In the Posts heading, click the Posts link.
 
3. Scroll until you find the post containing the item that you just created 
either the PayPal button or Google Shopping Cart for.
 
 When you run your mouse pointer over the title of the post, a menu 
appears, with the options for editing that post.
 
4. Click the Edit link.
 
 The post opens in the familiar window that you use to type text and 
upload photos.
 
5. In the upper-right corner of the editing window, click the HTML tab.
 
 In the editing window, the text changes to the code view of the blog 
post.
 
6. Click in your post where you want to insert the button for the item 
you want to sell and then press Ctrl+V (on a Mac, Command+V) to 
paste in the code for the button.
 
 This is the code that you copied in Step 11 (for the PayPal button) or 
Step 17 (for the Google Shopping Cart) above. See Figure 11-10 for an 
example of what inserting this code will look like.
 
7. Click the Visual tab to see where the button appears in your post.
 
8. If you don’t like the button’s placement, switch to HTML view, delete 
the button code from where you’ve placed it, and then repeat Step 6 
to put it in the new location.
 
9. When you have the button where you want it to appear, click the 
Publish button on the right to publish the page. (If you are editing an 
existing page, the Publish button changes to an Update button.)
 
10. (For Google Checkout) Click to return to the tab in your browser 
where you got the code you just placed in the blog post.
 
 This is the page where you got the code for your shopping cart. You’re 
going to have to get one more piece of code to make this work in your 
WordPress blog.
 
11. Select the code in the bottom box on the page and press Ctrl+C (on a 
Mac, Command+C); click to return to the tab where your WordPress 
blog’s dashboard is still open in your browser.
 
 The bottom box is the one with the heading that reads “Add this code 
only once for each html page, just before the </body> tag.”

291
 Chapter 11: Adding Mobile Commerce
 
12. In the Appearance panel on the left side of your Dashboard, click the 
Editor link.
 
 The Edit Themes page opens in your browser. In the middle panel is the 
code for your blog. On the right are the various templates controlling 
how the elements of your blog (such as the header, the sidebar, or the 
comments) appear.
 
13. On the right side of the page, click the Footer link.
 
 The PHP code for the footer that appears on every page of your blog 
appears in the middle panel.
 
14. Scroll until you see the </body> code and then click the line above 
and press Enter (on a Mac, press Return).
 
15. Press Ctrl+V (on a Mac, Command+V) to paste the code here.
 
 This code allows every page on your blog to know how to handle the 
buttons and Google Checkout shopping cart. This piece of code has your 
Merchant ID number in it and the currency you use.
 
16. Click the Update File button and then test your work by clicking the 
name of your WordPress blog at the top of the Dashboard page.
 
 Test how well your button works by going through the order process — 
right up to placing an order to yourself from your site.

Part III: Multimedia, Marketing, and E-Commerce 
Adding a shopping cart with Dreamweaver
If you sell your merchandise through a static site, insert the button(s) by 
using whatever tool you used to construct the site. In the example here, we 
will show you how to use Dreamweaver, the industry-standard tool used to 
create custom Web sites. To insert a button with Dreamweaver, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Open the page of the item using Dreamweaver and then click the Split 
button at the top of the workspace.
 
 This opens the dual-panel view, where you see the underlying code and 
the page’s design.
 
2. Click the page where you want the button to appear and then press 
Ctrl+V (on Mac, Command+V) to paste the code for the button into 
your page.
 
 Again, this is the code that you copied in Step 11 (for the PayPal button) 
or Step 17 (for the Google Shopping Cart) above.
 
3. Return to the tab in your browser where you created the shopping 
cart code, and then select and copy the code in the lower panel.
 
 Press Ctrl+C (on a Mac, Command+C) to copy the code.
 
4. Return to Dreamweaver, scroll to the bottom of your page, and find 
the </body> tag.
 
5. Click just above this tag and press Ctrl+V (on Mac, Command+V) to 
insert the code.
 
 This code needs to be added to each HTML page that you have the 
shopping cart button on (see Figure 11-11 for an example of what insert-
ing the code in Dreamweaver will look like). If you have multiple pages, 
put this code at the bottom of each page. It’s helpful to use the Split 
view when you paste in the code for your button, not only so you can 
control exactly where it goes in amidst your other page elements, but so 
you can get a sense of how it fits into the rest of your page design.
 
 If, however, you have multiple items on one HTML page, return to your 
browser to generate the other buttons for the other items on your page.

f you’re looking for a quick reference to some of the biggest do’s and 
don’ts of mobile Web design, this chapter is for you. We cover most of 
these tips in greater detail in other chapters of this book, but this collection 
of ten mobile interface tips gives you a quick overview of the most common 
issues you’re likely to face while you create a mobile version of your 
Web site.
Design for Distracted Surfers
We’re sure you’d never surf the Web while you’re driving, and everyone 
would be a lot safer on the roads if no one else did, either. Unfortunately, the 
fact that we even have to write that is an indication of one of the biggest chal-
lenges in mobile Web design — distracted surfers.

298
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Keep in mind that when people visit a mobile site they’re often doing some-
thing else at the same time, and they’re often under pressure to find informa-
tion quickly.
Here are a few quick tips to make your mobile site easier for distracted visi-
tors to use:
 
✓ Make key information, such as your address and phone number, easy to 
find right away.
 
✓ Make all links big and easy to click.
 
✓ Use text and background colors with good contrast so that your mobile 
Web site is easy to read, even in low light.
Surf the Web on Many Mobile Devices
To appreciate the challenges of the mobile Web, surf to your Web site on a 
mobile phone. But don’t stop at one phone, especially if you have an iPhone 
or Droid. These phones may get all the headlines (and a majority of the traffic 
on the mobile Web), but they’re not the only phones likely to visit your site — 
they’re just the ones most likely to make your site look good, even if it’s not 
optimized for the mobile Web.
Don’t let these smartphones fool you with their relatively sophisticated fea-
tures that make many desktop Web sites look good (or at least good enough). 
Those same sites viewed on a BlackBerry or, worse, a RAZR, may be com-
pletely unreadable.
Although you can test your mobile site using online emulators (see Chapter 7), 
the best way is to hold a device in your hand so you can see how it feels and 
looks.
Visit a mobile phone store and be really nice to the salespeople while you 
test your sites on their phones. Better yet, compare notes with friends and 
family. Ask people to visit your Web site on different phones and watch what 
they do, how they find their way around (or where they get lost), and how 
hard it is for them to get to the information they need when they interact 
with your site.

299
 Chapter 12: Ten Quick Tips for Mobile Design
Set Up Mobile Web Addresses
So that everyone with a mobile phone can easily get to the URL of your 
mobile site (by typing as little as possible), set up multiple mobile addresses 
and direct them all to the mobile version of your site.
Until a clear winner appears in the mobile URL game, use the most common 
addresses to increase the odds that your visitors find you on their first try.
The following are among the mobile addresses in common use on the 
mobile Web:
 
✓ m.yourdomain.com: Recommended for ease of typing
 
✓ wap.yourdomain.com: A common address for sites created using the 
WML, Wireless Markup Language)
 
✓ yourdomain.com/mobile: Common alternative because of the easy 
server setup
 
✓ yourdomain.com/i: If you create a version specifically for the iPhone
 
✓ yourdomain.mobi: Requires registering the .mobi version of your 
domain name, which many sites don’t seem to bother with
Whatever you do, drop the www. — no one should ever have to type those 
three letters and that dot again on the modern Web.
Create a Virtual Demo or Showcase
Consider what’s most important for your audience. If you don’t have a physi-
cal location but want to use your mobile site to showcase your work, create 
a portfolio that displays well on a small screen. Then, the next time you’re at 
a party or business event, your mobile phone will be everything you (or your 
sales and marketing staff) need to give an impromptu demo of your products 
or services anywhere, anytime.
Location, Location, Location
Most people who surf the desktop Web are in an office, school, library, or 
cybercafé. Mobile Web surfers can be anywhere, including in front of your res-
taurant, office, or store, right now, or worse, lost on the road trying to find you.

300
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
As you consider how to design a mobile version of your Web site, consider not 
just how to make things smaller but also how to best present the information 
most likely to be useful to someone using a mobile device, wherever he is.
One of the most common uses of mobile phones is still the most obvious — 
making phone calls. So make sure your phone number is easy to find on the 
first screen of your mobile site, and include your street address and links to 
maps for those who may get lost on their way.
 
Including a link to a Google map is a great way to make it easy to find you, but 
for best results, make sure you link to the mobile version of Google Maps.
Both Yahoo! and Google let you prioritize searches for local matches on their 
mobile sites. Take the time to optimize your mobile site and make sure to 
include location-specific keywords, such as the names of the cities, states, 
and even local neighborhoods you serve.
Optimize for Low Bandwidth
The smaller screen size isn’t the only thing that limits how well you can dis-
play images and multimedia on a cellphone; bandwidth also places limits. 
Although a growing number of mobile users take advantage of the faster 3G 
and 4G networks, most are still restricted by very slow connections.
The same challenges of limited bandwidth that throttled the early Web slow 
the mobile Internet, which lags far behind the high-speed DSL and cable 
modem connections that are common ways to access the Internet from com-
puters.
 
When you design the mobile version of your site, the following tips can help 
your site reach visitors with a low bandwidth:
 
✓ Get ruthless with your images and multimedia files, limiting your mobile 
site to a precious few images that help tell your story and adding visual 
interest.
 
✓ As you streamline your site, replace banners and button images with 
text links, which work on any device.
 
✓ Give careful consideration to how you include multimedia. For example, 
don’t put video or audio files on the front page of your mobile site. 
Instead, link to multimedia files so they’re optional for mobile browsers, 
and include warnings about how big the file is and how well it will dis-
play on different devices.

301
 Chapter 12: Ten Quick Tips for Mobile Design
 
✓ If you’re designing for the lowest-level mobile phones, try to keep the 
total size of your front page to 7k or less. Yes, you read that right, 7k — 
that’s one tiny image and a few links, and that’s all folks.
Follow the YouTube Mobile Video Model
Point any Internet-enabled device that supports video at www.youtube.
com and you quickly see that the biggest site for video on the Web has made 
mobile a priority.
YouTube uses the MP4 video format for mobile users, and that makes all the 
difference between a video you can watch anywhere, anytime and a blank 
screen on mobile phones that don’t support Flash (a common video format 
used by YouTube only for desktop devices).
To fully appreciate YouTube’s mobile adaptability, compare the early iPhone 
model with one that runs on the new 3G network — YouTube delivers two 
versions of the same video to accommodate the bandwidth difference. The 
result is that YouTube videos look a bit choppy in their heavily compressed 
versions for mobile devices with limited bandwidth, but they don’t take all 
day to get there. On a fast 3G iPhone, the higher-resolution version of the 
same video plays smooth and clean over the faster connection.
 
Follow YouTube’s model when you add videos to your site and avoid video 
formats that aren’t well supported by mobile devices. If you want to make the 
process of publishing video to your site really easy, upload your videos to 
YouTube and then embed them into your mobile Web pages using their simple 
embed code — it’s as easy as copy and paste, and you can rest assured your 
videos will play on most mobile devices thanks to YouTube’s careful attention 
to the mobile Web. Already YouTube is starting to roll out video using the new 
HTML5 options covered in Chapter 5.
You find more information about video and other multimedia options in 
Chapter 8.
Follow Standards and Use Style Sheets
Desktop browsers, such as Firefox and Internet Explorer, are surprisingly for-
giving when it comes to errors on Web pages. You can miss a close tag here 
or add an extra quotation mark there, and much of the time your pages still 
look okay.

302
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
Browsers that can handle code that’s not written quite correctly have to be 
bigger programs with more complex code. You just can’t run a browser that 
sophisticated on a mobile device. That’s why following standards and testing 
your work carefully are more important than before you launch a mobile site. 
You find tips and links to some great sites where you can test your pages in 
Chapter 7.
Here are a few quick suggestions for creating clean, standards-based mobile 
sites:
 
✓ Separate content from style: Use Cascading Style Sheets and well-writ-
ten semantic code to design clean pages that work well on many devices 
(you find instructions in Chapters 4, 5, and 6).
 
✓ Use alt tags behind images: Alternative text is text that you include in 
the alt attribute of the image tag (which we cover in Chapter 5). Alt text 
displays when images are turned off or can’t be seen by the user. This 
simple addition as you insert images into your pages helps ensure that 
your designs are clear and understandable to everyone.
 
✓ Use HTML heading tags: The HTML heading tags <h1> through <h6> 
are well-recognized tags that create a hierarchy of information on your 
page. Your most important headline needs to be formatted with the 
<h1> tag, your next level of headlines with the <h2> tag, and so on. 
 
✓ Follow the W3C mobile guidelines: The World Wide Web Consortium 
sets the standards for the Web, and they have a lot to say about design-
ing for mobile devices. Check out www.w3.org/mobile to read more 
about standards, and test your site in the validator at http://
validator.w3.org/mobile/.
 
✓ Validate your code: Mobile Web browsers are notoriously unforgiving 
about errors in markup. To make sure your mobile site won’t fail to open 
on a phone because of a typo or missing quotation mark, make sure 
to run your URL through the W3C Validator at http://validator.
w3.org.
Don’t Make Anyone Type or Click Much
Even on the best mobile devices, typing and clicking links can be a real chal-
lenge. Therefore, make links big and easy to click for mobile visitors, and 
don’t overload any page with too many options.
The best approach is to lead users through a series of simple choices, limit-
ing the options to no more than five to seven big links at any stage, and direct 
visitors to increasingly specific sets of links until they find the information 
they need.

303
 Chapter 12: Ten Quick Tips for Mobile Design
Avoid drop-down lists, or anything else that uses AJAX or JavaScript around 
links, because many mobile devices don’t support these advanced Web tech-
nologies, making these links impossible to use.
Some information, such as contact information, should never be more than 
one click away, and in many cases, including your phone number on the main 
page of your mobile site is good practice — after all, you know your visitor 
has a phone handy.
Prepare for Fast Updates
The Internet increased the speed with which people share news and gossip 
around the world, and the advent of the mobile Web has accelerated the 
rumor mill.
As you create a mobile Web site, make sure you build it in a way that’s easy 
to update, preferably from your mobile device and computer. There are 
many great online services that can help you update your Web site or blog 
using a mobile device. In Chapter 9 you find resources for blogging from a 
mobile device, and in Chapter 8 you find online services that make it easy to 
upload photos and post them automatically.
While you’re at it, make it easy for visitors to your site to send you informa-
tion from their mobile phones as well. Services, such as Picasa, featured in 
Chapter 8, make it easy for anyone with the right login information to upload 
photos to your site. Picasa works with Google Maps so it can even add geo-
codes to photos to show exactly where the photos were taken.
The mobile Web provides a powerful vehicle for individuals, businesses, and 
organizations to present their side of any story and get the word out quickly 
when tragic events, bad press, and other crises arise. But don’t wait for an 
emergency to find out whether you’re prepared to add new information to 
your Web site quickly, and don’t fool yourself into thinking that just because 
you don’t manage a daily Internet newspaper, you don’t have to worry about 
speedy updates. Today, your staff and key constituents are more likely to 
have access to a mobile phone when disaster strikes than to a desktop com-
puter. Don’t wait for an emergency to prepare — host a training session, 
set up a mobile phone emergency drill team, and make sure the people who 
matter to you are prepared to use mobile devices to coordinate efforts and 
collect information from the field today.

C
reating the best design for the mobile Web isn’t easy, especially if you 
want your site to work on a wide variety of devices. The sites featured 
in this chapter illustrate some of the best early adopters on the mobile Web, 
complete with screenshots so you can see how the site designs vary across 
devices.
The sites selected for this top ten list won their place in history for creating 
Web sites that look great on everything from an iPhone to a Motorola RAZR. 
The sites featured in this chapter win points not only for their mastery of 
mobile technology but also for their innovative and effective presentation 
of information within the constraints of the small screens of mobile phones. 
Creating a great mobile Web site, such as the ones we feature in this chapter, 
requires more than just mastering a few new technical skills and cramming 
information onto a small screen. What makes the mobile Web different is that 
it requires an almost Zen-link ability to concentrate on all the tiny details, 
while at the same time remaining cognizant of the bigger picture. Only by 
having a strong grounding in the technical limitations and expanded func-
tionalities of the mobile Web will a designer truly be able to give the user the 
right content in the right place at the right time — and then go a step further 
to ensure that the site functions on the device each visitor uses.

306
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
For each site, we include a screenshot of the desktop version (taken in 
Internet Explorer 8, on a computer monitor set to a resolution of 1024 x 768) 
and screenshots taken on the iPhone 3G, BlackBerry Bold 9700, and Motorola 
RAZR V9x.
We chose these phones because they represent the main categories of 
devices on the market today: a touch-screen phone (the iPhone), a smart-
phone (the BlackBerry), and a feature phone (the RAZR). With every device, 
we entered the URL for the site’s home page and let the site redirect us to the 
version it thought best for the phone we were using. (You find out how to set 
up a site to redirect visitors like this in Chapter 6.)
Comparing the designs on each device in this chapter can help you figure 
out how best to take advantage of the limitations and features of each 
phone type.
Over the coming months and years, these designs are sure to evolve, and 
the list of favorite mobile sites is sure to grow (we already have a longer 
list of great examples than we could ever include in this book). Keep up 
with our favorites and send us yours via the e-mail link on our blog at www.

Facebook Keeps You Connected
www.facebook.com
Perhaps not surprisingly, one of the best designed sites for the mobile Web 
was created with the goal of helping people connect with each other. You 
can take your friends from your home computer to your office to any mobile 
device you have with you when you sign up for an account on Facebook. The 
Facebook site performs well on everything from the simplest low-end feature 
phones to the latest smartphones to touch-screen phones, with a special 
version optimized for each type of phone, as shown in Figure 13-1. Facebook 
reports that more than 100 million people access their site via the mobile 
Web, that those users are twice as active as non-mobile users, and that more 
than 200 mobile operators in 60 countries are trying to make sure that their 
users can access Facebook on their mobile devices. And yes, of course, 
Facebook has an iPhone app with additional features.
The premise of this book is that every Web site needs to be optimized for 
mobile devices, and some may warrant an app as well. Facebook is a great 
example of a company that does both well.

307
 Chapter 13: Ten Great Mobile Sites
The team at Facebook understands that mobile technology facilitates a dra-
matic cultural shift as people rely more and more on cellphones to connect 
IRL (that’s in real life for those who don’t text much). Yes, most still want 
to get together IRL at least once in awhile, and that’s part of why Facebook 
has become such a popular part of the Internet. The addition of mobility to 
Facebook makes it easier than ever to stay in touch all the time no matter 
where you are and to hook up almost anywhere when you’re in the same 
neighborhood.

BBC Sends News Around the Globe
www.bbc.com
Serving a diverse international audience, the British Broadcasting 
Corporation (BBC) recognized earlier than most the importance of creating 
a mobile version of its Web site that would work on a variety of devices. An 
early player on the mobile Web, the BBC succeeded in creating one design 
that looks good on a wide variety of devices — no small feat for a site that’s 
updated around the clock with breaking news. In Figure 13-2, the designs 
vary across all three types of phones, but they all are quite different from the 
desktop version. Like most news sites, the front page of BBC.com is packed 
with stories, photos, and advertising when viewed on a desktop computer.

On the mobile phone version, the site is stripped to the bare minimum, with 
just three tiny photos and links to quickly follow the top stories or navigate 
to the section that most interests you with just a few clicks. The most dra-
matic difference between the desktop and mobile version is hard to appreci-
ate in the black and white figures in this book. The desktop version is red, 
and the mobile version is blue — a popular color among mobile designers 
because blue displays well on many devices under a wide variety of lighting 
conditions.
Google Wants to Know Where You Are
www.google.com
Google, the most popular search engine on the Internet, pays close attention 
to the explosive growth in wireless Web surfing. Google has not only opti-
mized its designs to work well in a variety of devices, but it also produces 
different search results when you search the mobile site. Although Google 
guards its search algorithms closely, the search giant favors sites that are 
optimized for mobile devices when delivering results to mobile phones. In 
Chapter 2, you find a few tips for optimizing your mobile site to score better 
in Google and other mobile search engines. (You find the URLs for several 
other mobile search engines on this book’s online Cheat Sheet; see the inside 
front cover for details.)
In Figure 13-3, you can see that Google’s minimalist design requires little 
adjustment on the mobile Web. Most sites limit the amount of informa-
tion they present in the mobile version, but Google, king of the We Love 
Whitespace home page, actually added text to the mobile version that’s not 
on the desktop Web site.
In the iPhone version, you see My Location: Off followed by a Turn On link. 
If you click the link, Google asks you to confirm that you want to turn on this 
feature, which uses geo-location technology (either GPS or triangulating via 
the signals from the cell towers) to enable Google to provide location-specific 
information when you search.
 
Anytime you want to collect information through a Web page, especially some-
thing as potentially revealing as the exact location and movements of your 
users, take a lesson from Google (a company that has faced its share of con-
troversies over privacy) and ask permission first.

Dictionary.com
www.dictionary.com
You can clear off the bookshelves and empty your student backpack because 
soon you’ll have every reference manual you could ever need in the palm 
of your hand. Start with Dictionary.com (and don’t forget Wikipedia, a non-
authoritative but still useful site when you want to start exploring a topic, 
which has also been optimized to display well on mobile devices).

311
 Chapter 13: Ten Great Mobile Sites
In Figure 13-4, you see the difference in designs at Dictionary.com. In this 
case, the designers stripped the site to its core function — looking up words. 
The focus in the mobile version is the search field, and most of the other 
information visible on the home page of the desktop site can be found only 
by following links deeper into the mobile version’s site.
If you include advertising on your pages, you may want to pay special atten-
tion to how Dictionary.com delivers ads. On the RAZR and the BlackBerry, 
a small banner ad is included in the page design. Although you can’t see an 
ad in the iPhone screenshot, when you open the Dictionary.com site on an 
iPhone, a full-screen ad loads and then you move on to the home page.

Discovery Channel Creates a Sense of 
Wonder on Any Platform
www.discovery.com
From popular television shows, such as Deadliest Catch, MythBusters, and 
Dirty Jobs, to games, blogs, and other Internet-only content, the team at 
Discovery Channel works hard to make sure you can interact with their 
award-winning content anywhere, anytime. In Figure 13-5, you can see that 
stripping this highly interactive multimedia site to just the core elements 
wasn’t easy.

 Chapter 13: Ten Great Mobile Sites
On Discovery mobile, you don’t find all the cool features of the desktop 
version — the main part of the desktop site rotates through a series of full-
screen, rich media content related to each of its shows. On the mobile ver-
sions, especially on a low-end feature phone, you find a much more limited 
set of links and very few images, but you can still access key content and 
keep up with Discovery Channel’s most popular shows.
The Wall Street Journal Serves Its 
Well-Heeled Audience on Any Phone
www.wsj.com
Internationally respected as a carefully researched news source on business 
and the economy, The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) was an early player on the 
mobile Web. The newspaper’s readership, made up primarily of business 
executives and financial experts, serves an audience that’s likely to carry the 
latest in mobile gadgetry.
An unusually high percentage of readers of The Wall Street Journal is likely 
to have BlackBerrys, and the designers created a special version for these 
smartphones (see Figure 13-6). Like many sites, WSJ delivers the desktop 
design to the iPhones, also shown in Figure 13-6. The iPhone can display 
most Web pages without requiring special markup, and many iPhone surfers 
prefer the desktop version (one of the reasons it’s considered good practice 
to include a link to the desktop site from any mobile version you create). 
Although the experience isn’t as rich, you can still access the WSJ’s stories 
even on a low-end feature phone, as shown in Figure 13-6.

Share Photos with Anyone on Flickr
www.flickr.com
One of the most popular places to share photos on the Internet, Flickr has 
devised the magic formula to maintain its impressive collection of interactive 
features while still being accessible from a variety of mobile devices 
(see Figure 13-7).
From the high-resolution images you can access with a desktop computer 
to the stripped-down version for feature phones, Flickr makes it as easy to 
upload photos as it is to download them. Since so many phones now come 
with cameras, it’s a natural fit for Flickr to empower you to share all the snap-
shots you take.

YouTube Brings Video to 
(and from) the Masses
www.youtube.com
Unfortunately, a large percentage of video on the Web is completely inac-
cessible to mobile devices because it’s presented in the Flash video format, 
which isn’t supported on many mobile devices, including the iPhone.
All the more reason to admire YouTube for figuring out how to deliver differ-
ent versions of its videos, optimized to play well on nearly any mobile device 
on the planet. In Figure 13-8, you see a video clip from one of author Janine 
Warner’s training videos. Thanks to YouTube, this video plays on the lowly 
feature phone almost as well as the iPhone.

316
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
If you want your videos to display well on a mobile device, uploading them to 
YouTube and then linking to them from your mobile site is an easy shortcut 
to ensure that your video looks good to a broad mobile audience. (You can 
read more about adding multimedia to your mobile designs in Chapter 8.)

Checking Flights on American Airlines
www.aa.com
The American Airlines site offers rich, interactive features, including the abil-
ity to check your gate while you run through the airport to catch your flight. 
(Assuming you can juggle your carry-on bags and your phone while you 
dodge and weave through the airport.)
 
The form tag, which creates search options and other interactive features like 
the ones at AA.com, works fairly consistently across most mobile devices. 
But anything you can do to more easily allow visitors to fill out forms, such as 
offering multiple-choice options instead of requiring users to type a lot of data, 

317
 Chapter 13: Ten Great Mobile Sites
makes it easier to interact with your site on a mobile device. (You find a list of 
form tags supported in mobile markup languages in Chapter 5.)
When you look over the four versions of AA.com, shown in Figure 13-9, note 
that the mobile versions offer just a few options — the things you’re most 
likely to need if you’re about to catch a flight. Note that on the desktop site, 
making a reservation is the most prominent option on the home page. If you 
scroll down the page on the mobile versions, you find links that take you to a 
page where you can make reservations.
When you adapt a site for the mobile Web, determining what content is most 
useful to someone on a mobile phone is often the most challenging and most 
important part of the job.

Appendix A
Interviews with Mobile Experts
I
f writing about the Web is like shooting at a moving target, writing about 
the mobile Web is like trying to hit a cheetah in full stride. The contradic-
tory claims, promises, criticism, and grandiose world-conquering rhetoric 
can be hard to sort through. This is why we reached out to high-level mobile 
experts to get their perspectives on what the mobile Web really is, what it’s 
good for, and where it’s headed.
Patrick Collins, CEO, 5th Finger
www.5thfinger.com
The company name — 5th Finger — is a mobile Web pun; it refers to the 
thumb, which is the digit most people use to tap SMS messages on their 
smartphones. 5th Finger designs mobile marketing campaigns and sells in-
store mobile commerce tools that allow shoppers to check prices and com-
parison shop.
Q: What are the biggest mistakes people make when getting started with 
the mobile Web? 
Short-term thinking is really dangerous in mobile. Because even an effective 
iPhone app, when you launch with a three-month test budget and leave it 
alone, is going to fail. You have to look at your mobile Web presence as an 
ongoing program to talk to the consumers.
People who come to us are generally pretty passionate about mobile already. 
In fact, I find a very high correlation between the success of a mobile cam-
paign and the passion of someone who’s leading it. Passion is one of the 
biggest drivers; when you find people [who are already knowledgeable and 
enthusiastic], that makes creating a marketing campaign a lot easier because 
the question isn’t “Should I do it?” but “What’s the best way of locating a cer-
tain segment?”

322
Mobile Web Design For Dummies 
Every week someone comes up to us wanting an app. You can choose to talk 
the client off the ledge or run with it.
Q: What are some tools you use to help people figure out how they should 
use the mobile Web?
We approach this question by just trying to understand what a client’s objec-
tives are. Often you can use reason and statistics to help them understand 
why they should or shouldn’t go down that route. The most common one is 
asking them, “Who are your consumers, what are they using, and how are 
they using it?” Okay, so if they’re 50-year-old females, they’re not going to 
be a large proportion of iPhone app users, so you might want to think 
about that.
In addition to the user base, we look at the existing marketing mix [to see 
what advertising channels the clients are spending money on at the present 
time]. If the existing marketing mix has a heavy amount of TV spending, we 
try to figure out how we can utilize that. If there’s a heavy amount of online 
spending, we figure out how to use that. We find that most clients are at least 
somewhat attuned to what they can achieve or what mobile can do.
Often, clients have already done the homework, but you also want to take 
that step back, make sure you get the objectives, and do some basic planning 
on the fly. The clients we love let us do a planning session with their team. 
We just get amazing outcomes from that process and really try to understand 
which divisions and which people in the company view mobile differently. A 
lot of people approach mobile through the lens of, “Well, we don’t do much 
advertising, not on mobile anyway; we don’t have an iPhone app, and there-
fore, we don’t do mobile.” But it’s quite a lot more than that.
Q: What kinds of missed opportunities just make you cringe?
Well, start with the fact that only one in four of the URLs that went up during 
the Super Bowl — which, mind you, is $2 million for 30 seconds — were 
mobile-friendly. When you think about where the people are going to access 
the site from, that makes absolutely no sense.
People are at Super Bowl parties with their friends, and when they see these 
ads (which are some of the most-watched ads ever), they hopefully want to 
follow up. They’re going to whip out their mobile phone and do a search, and 
75 percent of the time, they’re going to find . . . nothing. 
What a waste. 
We just ran an ad campaign for a major pharmaceutical company during the 
Oscars. There was a text-to-call action: “Text this word to this number and 
your phone automatically dials this number.” We spent a lot of money setting 
up the program. When the ad came on, this SMS messaging program was only 

323
 Appendix A: Interviews with Mobile Experts
onscreen for like the final half a second in the bottom-left corner. The ad was 
in such fine print that you couldn’t even see it. Then they said, “Why did we 
get only 150 entries?”
Niles Lichtenstein, Director, Velti Plc, 
formerly Managing Director, Ansible 
www.ansiblemobile.com
Ansible, Interpublic Group’s full service mobile marketing agency, specializes 
in building mobile Web sites that work across a broad spectrum of mobile 
devices. Ansible also custom-builds applications and manages mobile mar-
keting and advertising campaigns.
Q: Because you work with apps and mobile sites, which do you think is 
more useful?
We joke around and say that the iPhone app is like the TV ad. Just like every 
client wants to see his brand on TV, now everyone wants to see their icon on 
an iPhone; it’s just one of those things. We really do focus on the mobile Web 
though. Our slogan is “no phone left behind.”
If someone is just dead set on having an app, we recommend she builds a 
mobile Web site that will reach more or less all platforms, and just put an 
iPhone stub (an app that basically just opens a browser and navigates to the 
mobile Web site) on it. That gives you the app you want and a way you can 
actually scale it relatively well across different platforms. Then you reach 
that larger audience.
Q: What are the various levels of experience you can build to use the 
mobile Web, starting with the cheapest ones that don’t require everyone to 
have an expensive phone to access the site?
We’re working with one auto company and with dealerships closing and cut-
ting back on staff; their questions were, “How do we still service the custom-
ers; how do we get people information about the cars around them when 
they’re on the lot?”
If the customer has a text plan, he can text a code from the sticker in the car. 
The phone then rings, and an automated voice response message “walks” 
him around the car and explains everything in it. That’s just with your most 
basic phone.

324
Mobile Web Design For Dummies 
If the customer has a phone that can access the mobile Web, you can actu-
ally pull up the mobile Web, see the car videos, look at some of the specs, get 
some information, and enter your e-mail for a sign-up brochure.
If that customer has a phone with a compass (more phones have those these 
days), we can kick the experience up to the next level. We can put in an aug-
mented reality layer so that while the customer walks around the car, mes-
sages pop up that say, this is a hemi engine, and so forth.
The idea that more people can participate if we actually think about it and 
go through that planning session is pretty important. There are ways to get 
it done.
Q: What’s been your biggest recent success with a mobile Web site?
We recently launched Intel’s corporate site, and during the Super Bowl, the 
commercial launched where the Android comes up to the lunch table. We 
knew that not many people in the middle of a Super Bowl party were going 
to whip out their laptops. But still, we set a record that day for the highest 
total of people looking at the Intel site — for that day — because people 
were using their mobile phones, looking and searching for Intel, trying to find 
the commercials.
We worked hard to prepare the site for that traffic. We knew there was this 
audience — a large audience — that was going to be captivated by the Super 
Bowl and was going to look for the site.
If they had all gone to this Intel site and had gotten redirected to a crappy 
situation, maybe it’s so commonplace that it’s okay. But you lose that engage-
ment. You lose that whole entire opportunity to capture the conversation 
past that Super Bowl ad.
Ajay Luthra, Senior Director of Advanced 
Technology, Home and Networks 
Mobility, Motorola
www.motorola.com
Motorola’s RAZR phone was a breakthrough device in the early ’90s, and is 
still the most sold handset in the world. Motorola’s global presence gives it 
insight into trends outside the U.S. market, and it is working hard to build 
smartphones, like the Droid, that are designed to take advantage of the 
mobile Web.

325
 Appendix A: Interviews with Mobile Experts
Q: What are some of the things Motorola is learning from the global market 
that would surprise people in the U.S.?
Our world is changing at an exponential rate; many of us thought we knew 
where it was going, but we always get surprised. There are 4 babies born every 
second in the world, but there are 32 mobile devices sold every second.
That’s right. Mobile devices are growing at eight times the speed of human 
population.
And more and more phones can access the mobile Web and play multi-
media. Most of our old business was more like broadcasting. When we got 
very excited about interactivity, it was video on demand. That’s about it. 
Nowadays we get excited about capturing video and then sending it and 
interacting with the people after we send around the video.
I still remember quite clearly when I was watching the announcement of a new 
Pope on TV. Thousands of people were watching in St. Peter’s Square, which 
is thousands of years old. And in that historic spot, at that historic moment, 
thousands of hands went up with their cellphones — to take pictures.
Q: All this mobile interactivity is nice, but what does that mean to compa-
nies that want to make money off the mobile Web?
How content will be monetized on mobile still isn’t clear. We talk with our 
customers all the time; sometimes it’s a very heated discussion. One way to 
monetize is through a subscription system; the other is advertisement.
But good gosh. How many advertisements can one person see in one day 
and keep in one’s head? It reminds me of those travels where I go through 20 
airports and when I come back, I have no idea whether I was in Bangkok or 
France — where in the world was I?
There’s the same problem emerging now with advertising. I see so many that 
I’ve become like my kid who automatically tunes me out. The only time I pay 
attention is when someone texts me to say, “That was a cool ad,” and I say, 
“Well, let me go back and see.”
I could easily say that we’ll send more ads, but we’re getting saturated. So 
people are trying to work on subscription models. 
We’re seeing a slow but very steady shift in the way that people think about 
advertisements on TV. It all started with DVRs that allow you to skip all the 
ads. You get used to skipping the ads and boring parts and finishing the 
whole thing in 20 minutes.
So the issue has come that if they aren’t watching the ads, what’s the worth 
of them?

326
Mobile Web Design For Dummies 
Q: What are some other trends you see in the rest of the world that haven’t 
hit the U.S. yet?
We’re seeing more companies working to embed the ad inside the content — 
either on the boundary or literally inside the content so that you can’t skip 
over it [unlike what the TiVo and other DVRs allow users to do with TV ads]. 
We tried a lot of interactive things, but when you’re watching TV, it doesn’t 
work too much or too well.
People aren’t really that interested in seeing an ad and then going and buying 
the thing, unless you’re watching a really boring program. And if you’re 
watching a boring a program, why are you watching that program? So we’ve 
tried a lot of things — but it hasn’t been too successful so far. 
We see a lot more adoption of video being distributed, especially in Japan. 
Even in a country like India, I was surprised. About five years back, I saw a 
cricket match on a cellphone in India. We’re seeing a lot more there than in 
the U.S. or Europe. 
When people ask me why mobile is moving so much slower in the U.S. than it 
is in Europe, I say, “Well there are a lot more lawyers here in the U.S. than in 
Europe. There are a lot more silos here because of that.”
In India, there are even bigger silos. The market there has grown more like a 
tangled vine in which regional warlords have created their own network, and 
so there’s this jumble of disconnected networks trying to come together.
Thomas Ellsworth, CEO, GoTV
www.gotvnetworks.com
GoTV specializes in delivering video content to mobile phones; it offers the 
content through both the mobile Web and branded apps. Companies trying 
to crack the “TV anywhere” puzzle face the steepest challenges in the mobile 
content realm. 
Q: What are some of the changes in the market that make it feasible to 
build a business out of delivering video to mobile phones?
The best estimates I’ve seen say that in the U.S., 15 percent of the market 
uses smartphones, with about 280 million subscribers. We have a long way to 
go with smartphones, but we’ve gotten a lot of heat and buzz, thanks to the 
iPhone changing the game for everyone else. Google reacted very well with 
their Android. Now you have a platform that you can monetize, or charge a 
small subscription for.

327
 Appendix A: Interviews with Mobile Experts
So start with that. Only 15 percent of the U.S. carries a smartphone. And 33 
percent of that is enterprise-class BlackBerrys, meaning those users may or 
may not be allowed to buy applications and other things because they’re 
salespeople at a pharmaceutical company or working for the government, 
and their rate plan doesn’t allow them to buy ringtones, songs, or anything 
else. If I’m being generous, I’ll say that two-thirds of the smartphones 
can even run apps or other content. That’s about 10 percent of the 
mobile subscribers.
With only that, think of all the heat and buzz we’ve generated in the last 18 
months. We’re just getting warmed up with how effectively priced smart-
phones with unlimited data plans allow the consumers to do something.
If you look back on the last year only, there have been some starts and stops. 
But if you look forward, you have huge, huge handset makers that are speak-
ing in the hallways at industry conferences. They say that by 2013, we’ll be 
50 percent smartphone platforms, dominated by Android. Now, you step 
back and think that’s three years from now. Right now, when you look back 
at video advertising, 2009 was a year of testing, emergence, and rumors. But 
from this point forward, you have audiences. 
If you have great content and an audience that’s willing to pay for it, you have 
an audience that an advertiser would be willing to pay to be a part of.
Q: What kind of advertising works on video on mobile phones?
For video ads on the mobile, you have to take a cue from television networks 
that have done a really good job with the floating network promos in the 
lower-thirds of the screen. You also have to put the ad in context — an ad 
for Wrigley’s 5 gum probably doesn’t fit on Discovery Health, where there’s a 
quick clip from a dentist talking about the danger of cavities. So the context 
has to be there.
A video ad needs to create a positive, strong impression without being a neg-
ative, interruptive impression. To do so, you can integrate the sponsor into 
the programming, or you can respect the consumer while making a strong 
impression with a seven-second [ad] at the beginning and maybe a four-sec-
ond [ad] at the end. There’s a variety of things you can do to test [what kinds 
of ads work best].
A ton of phones can deliver a really nice experience to the user. It’s up to 
content creators and advertisers to make effective impressions and ensure 
that we don’t cause a negative effect on the viewer or advertiser. You don’t 
want transitive property of blame, for the consumer to say, “Aw, not another 
ad for Bud Light. I hate those guys now.”

328
Mobile Web Design For Dummies 
Q: So is there also room to charge people to watch video on their phones? 
Sort of like a mobile pay-per-view model?
The notion that the Internet is free is a false notion. People know that they 
pay a monthly recurring charge to get their mobile access. And on top of 
that, they pay some dollars to get the Wall Street Journal application, and 
then there will be ads nested around that and some of them will be video. 
We’re all going to experiment, but the consumer inherently understands that 
ads and a subscription are part of the game.
I wish it was a year from now, and we had another 20 million people buying 
applications with smartphones they love, hopefully under a 3G umbrella and 
Wi-Fi at home, that provide them just wonderful access to do whatever it is 
that they want to do.
Our biggest challenge is time. We wish it’d go a little faster because we’ve 
spent four years preparing GoTV and building a business in this space. And 
now we’re in a great spot and are just trying to drive forward.
Soren Schafft, General Manager of North 
America, Fox Mobile Distribution, a Unit 
of Fox Mobile Group (FMG)
http://foxmobile.com
Fox Mobile Group takes the content from all the Fox properties (such as Fox 
News, 20th Century Fox movies, FX Network, and so on) and decides which 
pieces are appropriate for delivery via the mobile platform.
Q: Is there any generation gap between older users and kids who have 
grown up attached to their mobile phones?
I was talking to a neighbor, and he was complaining about how many text 
messages his daughter sends. So I tried to console him; I told him that our 
research shows that girls in that age group do a lot of texting. How many did 
she send? He said, “700.” I said, well, we see that kind of usage in Scandinavia; 
some girls hit that every month.
He said, “That was yesterday.”
Kids don’t watch TV anymore. They watch the Internet; they watch short-
form videos. They do a lot of social networking and online games. The way 
they engage and experience content is really different. So we have a studio 
that creates content, and we do short-form series.

329
 Appendix A: Interviews with Mobile Experts
When we show the sizzle reels (short teasers that show off the best moments 
of the shows) for these series to our staff, the younger viewers have com-
pletely different tastes from what I would’ve expected. 
Q: How do you pick and choose what content you try to move into the 
mobile realm?
It depends on who you are and what your objectives are. For a number of 
content creators, it makes sense to do only an iPhone and Android app. For 
others, it makes sense to create a broad-based inventory for as many devices 
as you can and to get repeat users to that inventory so you can monetize that 
through advertising, cross-selling, and upselling.
It depends on the type of content you have, the type of distribution reach 
you have, and how you want to take advantage of the core assets you have as 
a company.
Within five years, we’re going to see content that was originally created for a 
mobile phone move up the chain and become a hit sitcom.
Q: How does Fox plan on monetizing its content on the mobile platform?
I think if you look at where the revenues are generated, it’s all about usabil-
ity, user experience, and engagement. Those are real key issues. If you’re 
engaged in some service that brings you closer to a brand, something that 
you enjoy, or something you are interested in, that is a value. In that case, 
advertising isn’t a detriment.
If you’re into the more advanced services, some of the programs we’re put-
ting together have the advertising mixed in with the programming — similar 
to what you see on 30 Rock, where it’s just contextually integrated.
What we’re trying to do is contextual integration of experiences where users 
are, based on what things they like to do, and engagement of users in the 
world and environment that they enjoy. In terms of growing the business and 
engaging customers, that’s really the thing to focus on.

Mobile coupons are billed as “the coupon you never forget at home” because 
they live on your cellphone. NetInformer’s product, known as Xtra! mobile 
coupons, works to make sending coupons to phones as easy as opening enve-
lopes that arrive in the mail.

Mobile Web Design For Dummies 
Q: Is there really a market for coupons on mobile phones?
Obviously, I think the mobile Web is the wave of the future, and we’ve seen 
strong indications that that’s the case. To back that up, the story of one of 
our customers — Shoe Station — comes to mind. Shoe Station is an online 
and brick-and-mortar shoe store in the South. We added mobile coupons to 
their existing TV and newspaper ads.
They saw a great big turnaround. People walked in with these mobile cou-
pons on their phones. Shoe Station came back to us within two days and said, 
“We want to continue with the coupon because it’s so phenomenal.” Their 
database now has more than 5,000 people that they can send mobile 
coupons to.
All this can be geo-targeted to people in a state, in a zip code. We’re work-
ing on targeting people who are walking down a specific block, but for right 
now, most of our clients seem comfortable with just getting as specific as zip 
codes, which fit in with the direct-mail paradigm that they’re familiar with. 
Q: We keep hearing about targeting — is it really that big a deal?
The future looks like this: Apps will allow merchants to know when you walk 
into a mall and if you’ve opted-in previously to receive special offers, and 
then, these apps will send special offers right to your phone as you walk by. 
I don’t want to get blasted like in the movie Minority Report, but when I walk 
into the mall, I want to get the offer of the day from one of the stores that I’m 
interested in.
You’re going to be tying information about the things that you’re interested 
in to what you see so that you can filter the things that you don’t want. That’s 
going to drive up the value of that advertising; publishers will make more 
money, and the consumer will be a lot happier because she’s not getting 
bombarded with stuff she doesn’t care about.
Q: But is any of this applicable to the average, small, or mid-sized business?
Well, the restaurant down the street is a client of ours. The dad owns the res-
taurant, and the son runs it daily. Perfect small business snapshot. One day, 
the dad comes in to check how the new mobile coupon campaign is doing 
and asks, “How many coupons did we give away today?”
It was $700. The dad’s jaw dropped; he almost had a heart attack. But the son 
said, “Yeah, but we had a $10,000 day instead of $5,000.”
The dad shakes himself, and then says, “Well, okay. I don’t mind giving away 
$700 if I made an extra $5,000.”

 Appendix A: Interviews with Mobile Experts
Q: Where do you stand on the whole mobile Web versus device-specific 
apps battle?
My take is that mobile advertising is going to have to reside both on the 
mobile site and the mobile apps designed for the individual devices. On one 
side, the Google model is willing to put everything into the cloud (that is, all 
the content and the ads exist only on internet servers). You put out a book-
marked badge that brings the coupons into whatever site you’re on via the 
mobile Web.
But depending on the device, I think in the near-term, it’ll be easier to bring 
up an app. If you’re looking for ValPak to send you a package in the mail once 
a month, you know where to look for that. That’ll be like the app.
When you get down to it, there’s not much different that can be done with an 
app than can be done with a Web page.
Chris Cunningham, Co-Founder and CEO, 
appssavvy
www.appssavvy.com
The runaway success of Apple’s App Store has made having your very own 
custom-built application the first thing that people want on the mobile Web. 
At the center of this maelstrom are companies like appssavvy, which has 
learned crucial lessons from the work it’s done for major companies.
Q: How do you deal with people who just want an app because everyone 
else seems to have one?
What we try to do is take a step back and answer the following questions:
 
✓ Why do you want to get into this space?
 
✓ Are you planning on supporting it for a while?
 
✓ Do you have content to provide users?
To bring a brand or company to mobile, our advice is don’t look at mobile as 
just mobile; look at it as an extension of the platform.
Because mobile is daunting and overwhelming, I have to educate my clients 
and my colleagues on it. Mobile is really just an extension; it’s just another 
platform to leverage. A lot of what we do is the education process because so 
much of this is so new.

332
Mobile Web Design For Dummies 
Q: What has been the biggest evolution that you’ve seen happen on the 
mobile Web?
The way that the Internet has supported itself so far is through the banner 
ad. You’re supposed to click the banner that some media agency displays 
that’s hopefully targeted and maybe has a rich media component. You then 
go to a Web site that some creative shop spent millions of dollars building.
That model is just broken; it doesn’t make any sense. People don’t want to go 
to Web sites to look at content. They want to hang out with their friends.
Prior to smartphones, before the Android and iPhone, there was really noth-
ing there as far as the mobile Web. There was nothing to be excited about 
from a mobile perspective, but that’s changed drastically. They are provid-
ing a true value, a true resource for people. To see a brand come with such 
a strong presence, that looks beautiful, shows just how far mobile has come 
and how much opportunity there is.
Q: What are some of the big challenges of building an app that you don’t 
get with the mobile Web?
The thing to remember is that the problems with integrating all your content 
into an app are bigger. On a Web site, if you want to change and integrate a 
piece, you just change it and upload it, and it’s live.
With Apple, if we want to significantly modify the interstitial [ads that appear 
between content in applications], we have to go through an Apple approval 
process, which can take anywhere from one week to three weeks. So you 
have to build in at least a month. You also have to factor in the amount of 
time it takes to get your advertisers on board, which can take 30–90 days or a 
year. Our largest advertiser took a year to develop and cultivate.
Right now, everyone keeps talking about Apple and the iPhone because that’s 
where designers and developers can go to make a business and generate 
revenue. Android is making a surge, and although developers had ignored it, 
it’s starting to get traction. Maybe in the future Android will dominate, but 
right now, the truth is Apple is going to be the dominant player for the fore-
seeable future.
Mobile should always be part of a multi-platform strategy. All the content 
should be promoted across every platform you can to increase adoption 
and usage.

333
 Appendix A: Interviews with Mobile Experts
Tom Limongello, Head of Business 
Development, Crisp Wireless
www.crispwireless.com
Crisp Wireless builds advertising products for both apps and the mobile Web 
and also has its own technology to allow companies to track how well their 
ad campaigns are working.
Q: Why have you concentrated on the mobile Web rather than on apps?
The thing with apps is that after the first month, the amount of time spent 
with them by the average user just plummets. However, the mobile Web 
grows and grows. This year, 30 percent of the people in the U.S. use the 
mobile Web regularly, and that’s going to go up to 35 percent in 2011. As you 
look at Nielsen stats, by 2011, more than 50 percent of the U.S. is going to be 
using smartphones. iPads and all the other types of devices will only contrib-
ute to the growth of the mobile Web.
So, what are the top mobile Web sites? Obviously Google, Yahoo!, Facebook, 
and portals are huge on the mobile Web. But you may not know that The 
Weather Channel, CNN.com, and MocoSpace are also huge. This is some tre-
mendous reach. Other than maybe Pandora and Facebook, no apps have the 
kind of traffic that a good mobile Web site will have.
Q: What are some of the things that you’re doing on the mobile Web to 
compete with the functions that apps offer?
Most people think that the most engaging ads and content for wireless have 
to be within applications. But we’ve built ads that can run on the mobile 
Web, such as the photo gallery for Ford that looks like Cover Flow in iTunes. 
Or we have an in-banner, data input, full-screen ad for the Hampton Inn in 
which you can actually book a room. If you go to CNN.com’s mobile site, you 
can see an Intel ad that actually allows you to drag and drop the features you 
want in your new CPU chip into an area that has multiple-choice questions 
appear within that ad.
We also offer Adhesion, which is a happy medium between a full-screen take-
over and a standard MMA (Mobile Marketing Association — the group that 
sets the standards for the sizes of mobile advertisements) banner.
There’s nowhere near as much flexibility in applications as there is on the 
mobile Web. On the mobile Web, if I want to make a change to my site, I can 
make it tomorrow. I don’t need to go through Apple, Google, or whoever it 
might be.

334
Mobile Web Design For Dummies 
Q: Can you provide an example of one of the sticking points with apps?
When applications are provisioned, they have a software development kit 
(SDK; a list of rules and processes for building the app) for serving ads and 
rendering ads within the application. That SDK is rigid.
The SDK doesn’t allow expansions beyond the 350 pixel by 50 pixel place-
ment, it doesn’t allow full-screen, and it doesn’t allow other things [like 
changing the multimedia or interactivity]. So if an advertiser comes along 
and wants to do something innovative on the ESPN.com application, they’d 
have to modify the SDK and modify the application to support new and inno-
vative ad units.
Q: Is anyone bridging the gap between apps and the mobile Web?
Right now, the ones that are doing the best are the ones who aren’t winning 
the race, such as Palm. They’re probably the closest to app-mobile Web con-
vergence that you can get.
You’re actually seeing the ability to basically download a Web site and have 
features enabled with HTML5 so that you can do the things that you’re sup-
posed to be able to do only within an app. Eventually, you’ll just have Web 
features built into something like an app wrapper.
Users don’t like to be taken off the site that they’re on. The more seamless 
you can make that transition from app to mobile Web and back again, the 
more likely that the user is going to stick around. Because of the load times, 
crashes, and the inconvenience of getting back to where they were, users 
usually abandon the process.

Optimizing Graphics 
for the Mobile Web

aking sure your images download quickly is even more important 
for the mobile Web than for sites designed for desktop comput-
ers. If you’re familiar with using a graphics-editing program, such as Adobe 
Photoshop or Fireworks, to create graphics for the Web, you’re a step ahead. 
If not, in this appendix, you find out how to convert images for the mobile 
Web, discover the best image formats to use, and discuss how to optimize 
images for faster download times.
We use Adobe Photoshop CS5 in the examples in this appendix, but because 
the features we use are nearly identical in both Photoshop and Photoshop 
Elements, you can use these same instructions to complete these tasks in 
Photoshop Elements. (See the nearby sidebar “Comparing Web graphics pro-
grams,” in this appendix, to read more about the differences.)
Creating and Optimizing Web Graphics
The most important thing to keep in mind when creating images for the 
Web — especially the mobile Web — is that you want to optimize your 
images to make your file sizes as small as possible so that they download 
as quickly as possible.
 
How you optimize an image depends on how the image was created and 
whether you want to save it as a JPEG, PNG, or GIF. You find instructions for 
optimizing images with Photoshop in the sections that follow, but the bottom 
line is this: No matter what program, format, or optimization technique you 
choose, your biggest challenge is finding the best balance between small file 
size and good image quality. Essentially, the more you optimize, the faster the 
image downloads, but the compression and color reduction techniques used 
to optimize images can make them look terrible if you go too far.

336
Mobile Web Design For Dummies 
As a general rule, do any editing, such as adjusting contrast, retouching, or 
combining images, before you reduce their size or optimize them because 
you want to work with the highest resolution possible when you edit. Also, 
resize an image before you optimize it. You find instructions for resizing an 
image in the following section and instructions for optimizing in the sections 
“Optimizing JPEG images for the Web” and “Optimizing images in GIF and 
PNG formats,” later in this appendix.
Comparing Web graphics programs
Most professional designers strongly prefer 
Adobe Photoshop, although we have to 
say we’ve been impressed with Photoshop 
Elements, which is a “light” version but offers 
many of the same features for a fraction of the 
cost. The following is a list of some of the most 
popular image-editing programs on the market. 
All these image programs are available for Mac 
and Windows:
 ✓ Adobe Photoshop: (www.adobe.com/
photoshop) By far the most popular 
image-editing program on the market, 
Photoshop is a widely used standard among 
graphics professionals. With Photoshop, 
you can create original artwork, edit and 
enhance photographs, and so much more. 
Photoshop has a wealth of powerful paint-
ing and selection tools, special effects, and 
filters that enable you to create images 
far beyond what you can capture on film 
or create with many other illustration pro-
grams. Photoshop includes special tools 
for optimizing Web graphics, and because 
Photoshop and Dreamweaver are both 
Adobe productions, switching between the 
two is easy. 
 ✓ Adobe Photoshop Elements: (www.
adobe.com/elements) If you don’t 
need all the bells and whistles offered in the 
full-blown version of Photoshop, Photoshop 
Elements is a remarkably powerful program 
— for about a sixth of the price. If you’re 
a professional designer, you’re best served 
by Photoshop. But if you’re a hobbyist or 
small business owner and want to create 
good-looking images without the high cost 
and learning curve of a professional graph-
ics program, Elements is a great deal and 
well-suited to creating Web graphics. Like 
Photoshop, Photoshop Elements includes 
special tools for optimizing graphics for the 
Web.
 ✓ Adobe Fireworks: (www.adobe.com/
fireworks) Fireworks was one of the 
first image-editing programs designed to 
create and edit Web graphics. Originally 
created by Macromedia, the program is 
now part of the Adobe Web suite and is fully 
integrated with Dreamweaver. Fireworks 
gives you everything you need to create, 
edit, and output Web graphics, all in one 
well-designed product. Although Fireworks 
lacks many of the advanced image-editing 
capabilities of Photoshop, Fireworks shines 
when creating Web graphics.
If you have an Internet connection and want 
to do basic image editing for free, visit www.
gimp.org or www.photoshop.com/
express. Both sites let you edit and optimize 
images online without purchasing a software 
program.

337
 Appendix B: Optimizing Graphics for the Mobile Web
Resizing graphics and photos
Resizing is important for two reasons: The images must be small enough to 
display well on a mobile screen, and you want them to download quickly to 
a user’s phone or other mobile device. The smaller the image is, the faster it 
downloads.
 
Although you can change the display size of an image in a Web page by alter-
ing the height and width settings in Dreamweaver, you get much better results 
if you change the physical size of the image in a graphics editor, such as 
Photoshop.
 
When you alter an image’s height and width in the HTML code (via the Height 
and Width settings in Dreamweaver), you simply instruct a Web browser to 
display the image in a different size. Unfortunately, browsers don’t do a good 
job resizing images because browsers don’t change the image itself but just 
force it to fit in the assigned space when the browser loads the page. If you 
set the image to display larger than its actual size, the image is likely to look 
fuzzy or distorted because the image doesn’t contain enough pixels for all the 
details to look good in a larger size. If you set the code to display the image 
smaller than it is — a more likely scenario on the mobile Web — the image 
may look squished, and you’re requiring that your users download an image 
that’s larger than necessary, making them wait longer and using more of their 
bandwidth allowance (which not only costs time on the mobile Web, it can 
cost your visitors money for data usage as well).
Reducing an image’s size for use on the Web requires two steps. First, reduce 
the resolution of an image, which changes the number of pixels in the image. 
When you work with images for the Web, you want to reduce the resolution 
to 72 pixels per inch (or ppi). (If you’re wondering why 72, see the sidebar 
that’s appropriately named “Why only 72 ppi?”) Second, reduce the image’s 
physical size by reducing its dimensions. You want to size your images to fit 
well in a mobile browser window and to work within the design of your site.
Follow these steps to lower the resolution and reduce the image size in 
Photoshop (in Photoshop Elements or Fireworks, you follow a similar pro-
cess, but the specific steps may vary):
 
1. With an image open in Photoshop, choose Image➪Resize.
 
 The Image Size dialog box opens, as shown in Figure B-1.
 
 If you don’t want your original image to lose quality (or you just want 
to play it safe), make a copy of your image and resize the copy for your 
Web site.

338
Mobile Web Design For Dummies 
 
2. To change the resolution of your image, deselect the Resample Image 
check box at the bottom of the Image Size dialog box.
 
 For best results, always deselect the Resample Image check box when 
you change the resolution.
 
3. Highlight the number in the Resolution field and replace it by 
typing 72.
 
Figure B-1: 
To best pre-
pare your 
images for 
the Web, 
change the 
resolution 
to 72 ppi so 
the images 
download 
faster.
 
 
4. Select the Resample Image check box.
 
 With the Resample Image check box deselected, you can’t change 
the pixel dimensions, so it must be selected when you change the 
image size.
 
5. Enter a height and width for the image in the Height and Width fields, 
respectively.
 
 As shown in Figure B-2, we reduced the image size to 278 pixels wide.
 
6. (Optional) Select the Constrain Proportions check box at the bottom of 
the dialog box.
 
 Any changes you make to the height automatically affect the width (and 
vice versa) to ensure that the image proportions remain constant. We 
prefer to work this way, but if you want to change the image and not 
maintain the proportions, you can deselect this check box.
 
7. Click OK to resize the image.
 
 If you want to return the image to its previous size, choose Edit➪Undo. 
Beware that when you save the image, the changes are permanent.

339
 Appendix B: Optimizing Graphics for the Mobile Web
Why only 72 ppi?
When you save images for the Web, you save 
them at a resolution of 72 ppi. Most computer 
monitors and mobile device screens display 
no more than 72 ppi, so any resolution higher 
than that is wasted on the Web because you’d 
make your visitors download more pixels than 
they can see. Although some of the new smart-
phones, including the iPhone 4, have higher 
image resolutions, most designers still set the 
ppi to 72 for the mobile Web. However, if you 
want to print an image, you want all the pixels 
you can get, usually at least 200 ppi or higher, 
which is why most images you see on the Web 
look terrible if you try to print them in a large 
size.

When you 
resize an 
image in 
Photoshop 
in the Pixel 
Dimensions 
area, you 
can specify 
the new size 
in pixels.

Mobile Web Design For Dummies 
Using Actions to automatically resize 
images in Photoshop
If you’re only working on a few images, resizing and optimizing each image 
individually enables you to find the best settings for each image. However, 
if you’re working with a bunch of images and you need to resize them into 
multiple different sizes, the minor benefits of optimizing the settings for each 
image are probably not worth the time. That’s where Photoshop’s Actions 
(macro scripts that automate a series of steps) can really come in handy.
The following steps walk you through creating a macro to automatically 
resize images in Photoshop:
 
1. Save the images you want resized into a separate folder on your 
desktop.
 
 The macro resizes all the images in any one folder. Unless you want all 
the photos on your site given this treatment, it’s best to work with only 
the ones that you want to deal with now. Consider creating an Images 
to Be Resized folder (or name it something like that) so that it’s easy to 
find when you go through these steps.
 
2. Create a new folder for the resized images.
 
 Consider naming the folders according to the width of the photos so you 
can more easily keep track of which photos go with each version of your 
mobile sites. In this example, we name the folder 300 and save it in the 
Golden Gate folder to keep track of a collection of images of the Golden 
Gate Bridge that we resize to 300-pixels wide.
 
3. Launch Photoshop.
 
 You can use other image-editing programs, but the steps may vary.
 
4. Choose Window➪Actions.
 
 The Actions panel opens.
 
5. From the bottom row of the Actions panel, click the Create New 
Action button.
 
 The Create New Action button is the second button from the right, just 
to the left of the trash can.
 
6. Type a name for your new macro.
 
 We suggest using the pixel size in the title so you can quickly find and 
use this macro later. For example, we call this macro Resize to 300px.
 
7. Click OK.

341
 Appendix B: Optimizing Graphics for the Mobile Web
 
 The red record button appears at the bottom of the Actions panel. You 
are now recording.
 
 This step starts recording the macro, which means that every action you 
perform is saved so that it can be replicated by the computer when it 
runs the macro. From this point on, if you make a mistake, don’t panic! 
Just stop running the macro by clicking the stop button, return to this 
point, and start over.
 
8. Choose File➪Open and then select one of the images you want 
to resize.
 
 The image opens in the workspace.
 
9. Choose Image➪Image Size.
 
 The Image Size dialog box opens.
 
10. Enter the new width or height you want in the Width and Height 
fields, respectively.
 
 To maintain the proportion of your images, make sure that the Scale 
Styles, Constrain Proportions, and Resample Image check boxes are 
selected, and you need only to enter a height or a width, but not both.
 
11. Click OK and then choose File➪Save for Web and Devices.
 
 The Save for Web and Devices dialog box opens.
 
12. Specify the settings you want for the folder of images you’re 
converting.
 
 You find instructions for optimizing images in the “Saving images for the 
Web: The basics,” section later in this chapter as well as in the sections 
on optimizing JPEGs and GIFs.
 
13. Click the Save button and then select the folder where you want to 
save your resized, optimized images.
 
 In this example, we select the Golden Gate 300 folder we created 
in Step 2.
 
14. Click OK and then choose File➪Close.
 
 Including Close in the macro is important because you don’t want to 
overload your computer’s RAM by having all these image files littering 
your desktop.
 
15. Click the Stop button in the Actions panel.
 
 The Stop button is square and is the button farthest to the left on the 
bottom of the Actions panel. (You can relax because the computer no 
longer records your every move.)
 
16. Choose File➪Automate➪Batch.
 
 The Batch dialog box opens, as shown in Figure B-3.

342
Mobile Web Design For Dummies 
 
Figure B-3: 
The 
Photoshop 
Batch dialog 
box includes 
many 
options you 
can specify 
when creat-
ing Actions.
 
 
17. Choose the macro you just created from the Action drop-down list.
 
 Many other macros come with Photoshop and are included in this drop-
down list.
 
18. From the Source drop-down list, choose Folder, and then click the 
Choose button below Source and select the folder that contains the 
images you want to resize.
 
19. In the Destination drop-down list, choose Folder, and then click the 
Choose button and select the folder where you want the automatically 
resized images to be saved.
 
 Again, we select the folder named 300 (which we created and saved in 
the Golden Gate folder in Step 2).
 
 The rest of the settings in this dialog box are optional. If the macro 
doesn’t run smoothly — for example, if it hesitates when opening the 
images or warns you that you’re changing the color profile — you might 
solve problems by selecting the Suppress File Open Options Dialogs 
check box or the Suppress Color Profile Warnings check box.
 
20. Click OK to run the macro.
 
 Photoshop automatically opens each image and executes the recorded 
steps. If your computer is really fast, this is like a slide show for hum-
mingbirds; if it’s a little slow (or if you have a large number of high-
resolution images to process), this might be a good time to get a nice 
cup of tea.

343
 Appendix B: Optimizing Graphics for the Mobile Web
 
After you create an Action, you can use it over and over again, simply by spec-
ifying different folders of images to be resized.
Choosing the best image format
One of the most common questions about images for the Web concerns when 
to use GIF, PNG, or JPEG. Table B-1 provides the simple answer.
 
You can use transparency in both the GIF or PNG format, a great trick for 
making the background of an image invisible so that it seems to “float on a 
page.” Unfortunately, not all mobile devices support transparency in GIF or 
PNG files. You can still use transparency, and it will work on many mobile 
devices, including the latest smartphones, but if you do use transparency, we 
recommend you design your pages so that they still look okay, and are read-
able, if the background color is displayed.
Table B-1 
Image Formats for the Web
Format
Best Usage
GIF (.gif)
For line art (such as one- or two-color logos), simple drawings, 
animations, and basically any image that has no gradients or 
blends. The GIF format also supports transparency. 
PNG (.png)
PNG generally produces better-looking images with smaller file 
sizes than GIF for the same kinds of limited-color images. Most 
mobile devices support the PNG format, but some older feature 
phones only support GIFs. Before you choose this format, make 
sure that your target audience can support it. The PNG format 
also supports transparency.
JPEG (.jpg 
or .jpeg)
JPEG is the best format for colorful, complex images (such as 
photographs); images containing gradients or color blends; and 
any other images with millions of colors.
Saving images for the Web: The basics
If you’re new to saving images for the Web, the following basics can help you 
get the best results from your files, your image-editing program, and ulti-
mately, your Web pages. You can
 
✓ Convert an image from any format into the GIF, PNG, or JPEG format. 
For example, turn all your TIF, BMP, and PSD image files into a Web-
friendly file format.

344
Mobile Web Design For Dummies 
 
✓ Optimize images that are already in GIF, PNG, or JPEG format. Even if 
your files are already in a Web-friendly format, following the instructions 
later in this appendix for optimizing images with Adobe’s Save for Web 
dialog box further reduces their file sizes for faster download over the 
mobile Web.
 
✓ Make image edits before you optimize. When you edit, using the high-
est quality image possible is always best. Make sure to do all your edit-
ing, sharpening, and resizing before you use the Save for Web option. 
Similarly, if you want to make further changes to an image after you opti-
mize it, you achieve the best results if you go back to a higher-resolution 
version of the image rather than editing the version that’s been opti-
mized for the Web. (When you use the Save for Web & Devices feature, 
Photoshop creates a new copy of your image and leaves the original 
unchanged.)
Optimizing JPEG images for the Web
JPEG is the best choice for optimizing continuous-tone images, such as pho-
tographs and images with many colors or gradients. When you optimize a 
JPEG, you can make the file size smaller by applying compression. The more 
compression, the smaller the image, but if you compress the image too much, 
the image can look terrible. The trick is finding the right balance, which you

If you have a digital photograph or another image that you want to prepare 
for the Web, follow these steps to optimize and save it in Photoshop (in 
Photoshop Elements or Fireworks, the process is similar, but the specific 
steps may vary):
 
1. With the image open in Photoshop, choose File➪Save for Web & 
Devices (or File➪Save for Web).
 
 The Save for Web & Devices dialog box appears.
 
2. In the top-left corner of the dialog box, click either the 2-Up or 4-Up 
tab to display multiple versions of the same image for easy side-by-
side comparison.
 
 In the example shown in Figure B-4, we clicked the 2-Up tab, which 
shows the original image on the left and a preview of the same image as 
it will appear with the specified settings on the right. (If you’re working 
with a horizontal image, the previews appear one above the other.) The 
4-Up tab, as the name implies, displays four versions for comparison.
 
3. On the right side of the window, just below the Preset drop-down 
list, choose JPEG from the Optimized File Format drop-down list (see 
Figure B-4).

 Appendix B: Optimizing Graphics for the Mobile Web
 
Figure B-4: 
The JPEG 
format is 
best for 
photographs 
and other 
images with 
millions of 
colors.
 
 
4. Set the compression quality.
 
 Use the preset options Low, Medium, High, Very High, or Maximum from 
the Compression Quality drop-down list. Or use the Quality slider just 
below the Quality field to make more precise adjustments (see Figure 
B-4). Lowering the quality reduces the file size and makes the image 
download more quickly, but if you lower this number too much, the 
image looks blurry and blotchy.
 
 Photoshop uses a compression scale of 0–100 for JPEGs in this dialog 
box, with 0 the lowest possible quality (the highest amount of compres-
sion and the smallest file size) and 100 the highest possible quality (the 
least amount of compression and the biggest file size). Low, Medium, 
and High represent compression values of 10, 30, and 60, respectively.
 
5. Specify other settings as desired (the compression quality and file 
format are the most important settings).
 
6. Click the Save button.
 
 The Save Optimized As dialog box opens.
 
7. Enter a name for the image and save it into the images folder in your 
Web site folder.
 
 Photoshop saves the optimized image as a copy of the original and 
leaves the original open in the main Photoshop work area.
 
8. Repeat these steps for each image you want to optimize as a JPEG.

At the bottom of the image preview in the Save for Web & Devices dialog box, 
Photoshop includes an estimate of the time required for the image to down-
load at the specified connection speed. In the example shown in Figure B-4, 
the estimate is 3 seconds at 56.6 Kbps. As you adjust the compression set-
tings, the size of the image changes and the download estimate adjusts auto-
matically. You can change the connection speed used to make this calculation 
by clicking the small arrow just to the right of the connection speed and using 
the drop-down list to choose another option, such as 256 Kbps for Cable 
Modem speed, but I prefer to keep this set to a lower speed, such as 56.6 Kbps 
to better reflect the lower connection speeds of many mobile phone users. 
Use this estimate as a guide to help you decide how much you need to opti-
mize each image.
Optimizing images in GIF 
and PNG formats
If you’re working with a graphic, such as a logo, cartoon character, or draw-
ing that can be displayed in 256 colors or less, your best bet is to use the 
PNG format and reduce the total number of colors used in the image as much 
as possible to reduce the file size. (If you’re concerned about visitors using 
very old mobile phones, use GIF instead.)
To help make up for the degradation in image quality that can happen when 
colors are removed, GIF and PNG use a dithering trick. Dithering involves 
alternating pixels in a checkerboard-like pattern to create subtle color varia-
tions, even with a limited color palette. The effect can smooth the image’s 
edges and make it appear to have more colors than it actually does.
To convert an image to GIF or PNG in Photoshop, follow these steps (in 
Photoshop Elements or Fireworks, the process is similar, but the specific 
steps may vary):
 
1. With the image open in Photoshop, choose File➪Save for Web & 
Devices (or File➪Save for Web).
 
 The Save for Web & Devices dialog box appears.
 
2. In the top-left corner of the dialog box, click the 2-Up or 4-Up tab to 
display multiple versions of the same image for easy side-by-side com-
parison.
 
 In the example shown in Figure B-5, we chose 4-Up, which makes it pos-
sible to view the original image (displayed at the top of the dialog box) 
and three different previews of the same image.

347
 Appendix B: Optimizing Graphics for the Mobile Web
 
3. Select a preview image to begin changing its settings.
 
 Changing the preview images in the 4-Up view enables you to compare 
an image with up to four color settings, as shown in Figure B-5.
 
4. On the right side of the dialog box, just below the Preset drop-down list, 
choose GIF or PNG from the Optimized File Format drop-down list.
 
Figure B-5: 
The GIF 
and PNG 
formats 
are best 
for images 
with limited 
colors, such 
as cartoons 
and line art.
 
 
5. In the Colors box, choose the number of colors (see Figure B-5).
 
 The fewer colors you use, the smaller the file size and the faster the 
image downloads. But be careful; if you reduce the colors too much (as 
we have in the bottom-right preview in Figure B-5), you lose details. The 
ideal number of colors depends on your image; if you go too far, your 
image looks terrible.
 
6. (Optional) If you want to maintain a transparent area in your image, 
select the Transparency check box.
 
 Any area of the image that was transparent when you created the image 
in the editor appears transparent in the preview window. If you don’t 
have a transparent area in your image, this setting has no effect.
 
 Transparency is a good trick to make text or an image appear to float on 
a Web page. That’s because a transparent background doesn’t appear 
on the Web page. You can select transparency as a background option 
in the New File dialog box when you create a new image in Photoshop 
or Photoshop Elements. (Note: Transparency does not always work on 
older feature phones, but is well supported on most smartphones.)

348
Mobile Web Design For Dummies 
 
7. If you select the Transparency check box, also specify a Matte color.
 
 You want the matte color to match the background of your Web page so 
that the dithering along the transparent edge blends in with the back-
ground. If you don’t specify a matte color, the transparency is set for a 
white background, which can cause a halo effect when the image dis-
plays on a colored background.
 
8. Specify other settings as desired.
 
 The remainder of the settings in this dialog box can be left at their 
defaults in Photoshop.
 
9. Click the Save button.
 
 The Save Optimized As dialog box opens.
 
10. Enter a name for the image and save it into the images folder (or any 
other folder) in your local site folder.
 
11. Repeat these steps for each image you want to optimize as a GIF or 
PNG for your site.
 
Trial and error is a great technique in the Save for Web & Devices dialog box. 
In each of the three preview windows, displaying optimized versions of the 
graphic in Figure B-5, we used fewer and fewer colors, which reduced the file 
size with increasingly degrading effect.
The version displayed at the top of the dialog box is the original, which has 
a file size of 27.9K. Reducing the image to 256 colors dramatically reduced 
the file size to 2.771K but made little noticeable change to the image, as you 
see in the version shown second from the top. In the third version in the list, 
the image is reduced to 64 colors, which brought the size down to 2.346K 
but still made little change to the quality of the image. In the bottom version, 
we reduced it to two colors, which made the file size only 660 bytes, but 
the image quality suffered so dramatically you can no longer read the text 
Scientific Animation. Although it’s harder to tell in the black-and-white repro-
duction in this book, all the color and details disappeared. In this last case, 
the savings in file size are clearly not worth the loss of image quality.
