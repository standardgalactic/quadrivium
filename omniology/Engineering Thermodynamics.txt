Preface
Preface
Thermodynamics is an essential subject taught to all science and engineering students. If the coverage 
of this subject is restricted to theoretical analysis, student will resort to memorising the facts in order to 
pass the examination. Therefore, this book is set out with the aim to present this subject from an angle 
of demonstration of how these laws are used in practical situation.
This book is designed for the virtual reader in mind, it is concise and easy to read, yet it presents all the 
basic laws of thermodynamics in a simplistic and straightforward manner.
The book deals with all four laws, the zeroth law and its application to temperature measurements. The 
first law of thermodynamics has large influence on so many applications around us, transport such as 
automotive, marine or aircrafts all rely on the steady flow energy equation which is a consequence of the 
first law of thermodynamics. The second law focuses on the irreversibilities of substances undergoing 
practical processes. It defines process efficiency and isentropic changes associated with frictional losses 
and thermal losses during the processes involved.
Finally the Third law is briefly outlined and some practical interrepretation of it is discussed.
This book is well stocked with worked examples to demonstrate the various practical applications in 
real life, of the laws of thermodynamics. There are also a good section of unsolved tutorial problems at 
theend of the book.
This book is based on my experience of teaching at Univeristy level over the past 25 years, and my student 
input has been very valuable and has a direct impact on the format of this book, and therefore, I would 
welcome any feedback on the book, its coverage, accuracy or method of presentation.

General Definitions
1	 General Definitions
In this sectiongeneral thermodynamic terms are briefly defined; most of these terms will be discussed 
in details in the following sections.
1.1	
Thermodynamic System
Thermodynamics is the science relating heat and work transfers and the related changes in the properties 
of the working substance. The working substance is isolated from its surroundings in order to determine 
its properties.
System – Collection of matter within prescribed and identifiable boundaries. A system may be either an 
open one, or a closed one, referring to whether mass transfer or does not take place across the boundary.
Surroundings – Is usually restricted to those particles of matter external to the system which may be 
affected by changes within the system, and the surroundings themselves may form another system.
Boundary – A physical or imaginary surface, enveloping the system and separating it from the 
surroundings.

of thermodynamic properties are the Pressure, Volume and Temperature of the working fluid in the 
system above.

General Definitions
Pressure (P) – The normal force exerted per unit area of the surface within the system. For engineering 
work, pressures are often measured with respect to atmospheric pressure rather than with respect to 
absolute vacuum.
Pabs = Patm + Pgauge
In SI units the derived unit for pressure is the Pascal (Pa), where 1 Pa = 1N/m2. This is very small for 
engineering purposes, so usually pressures are given in terms of kiloPascals (1 kPa = 103 Pa), megaPascals 
(1 MPa = 106 Pa), or bars (1 bar = 105 Pa). The imperial unit for pressure are the pounds per square 
inch (Psi)) 1 Psi = 6894.8 Pa.
Specific Volume (V) and Density (ρ)
For a system, the specific volume is that of a unit mass, i.e.
mass
volume
v =
 	 	
Units are m3/kg.
It represents the inverse of the density, 
ρ
1
=
v
.
Temperature (T) – Temperature is the degree of hotness or coldness of the system. The absolute 
temperature of a body is defined relative to the temperature of ice; for SI units, the Kelvin scale. Another 
scale is the Celsius scale. Where the ice temperature under standard ambient pressure at sea level is: 0°C 
273.15 K and the boiling point for water (steam) is: 100°C 373.15 K.
The imperial units of temperature is the Fahrenheit where
T°F = 1.8 × T°C + 32
Internal Energy(u) – The property of a system covering all forms of energy arising from the internal 
structure of the substance.
Enthalpy (h) – A property of the system conveniently defined as h = u + PV where u is the internal energy.
Entropy (s) – The microscopic disorder of the system. It is an extensive equilibrium property.
This will be discussed further later on.

Quality of the working Substance
A pure substance is one, which is homogeneous and chemically stable. Thus it can be a single substance 
which is present in more than one phase, for example liquid water and water vapour contained in a 
boiler in the absence of any air or dissolved gases.
Phase – is the State of the substance such as solid, liquid or gas.
Mixed Phase – It is possible that phases may be mixed, eg ice + water, water + vapour etc.
Quality of a Mixed Phase or Dryness Fraction (x) The dryness fraction is defined as the ratio of the 
mass of pure vapour present to the total mass of the mixture (liquid and vapour; say 0.9 dry for example). 
The quality of the mixture may be defined as the percentage dryness of the mixture (ie, 90% dry).
Saturated State – A saturated liquid is a vapour whose dryness fraction is equal to zero. A saturated 
vapour has a quality of 100% or a dryness fraction of one.
Superheated Vapour – A gas is described as superheated when its temperature at a given pressure is 
greater than the saturated temperature at that pressure, ie the gas has been heated beyond its saturation 
temperature.
Degree of Superheat – The difference between the actual temperature of a given vapour and the saturation 
temperature of the vapour at a given pressure.
Subcooled Liquid – A liquid is described as undercooled when its temperature at a given pressure is 
lower than the saturated temperature at that pressure, ie the liquid has been cooled below its saturation 
temperature.
Degree of Subcool – The difference between the saturation temperature and the actual temperature of 
the liquid is a given pressure.
Triple Point – A state point in which all solid, liquid and vapour phases coexist in equilibrium.
Critical Point – A state point at which transitions between liquid and vapour phases are not clear for H2O:
• PCR = 22.09 MPa
• TCR = 374.14 °C (or 647.3 °K)
• vCR = 0.003155 m3/kg
• uf = ug =2014 kJ/kg
• hf =hg = 2084 kJ/kg
• sf = sg =4.406 kJ/kgK

Thermodynamic Processes
A process is a path in which the state of the system change and some properties vary from their original 
values. There are six types of Processes associated with Thermodynamics:
Adiabatic: 	
no heat transfer from or to the fluid
Isothermal: 	
no change in temperature of the fluid
Isobaric: 	
no change in pressure of the fluid
Isochoric: 	
no change in volume of the fluid
Isentropic: 	
no change of entropy of the fluid
Isenthalpic: 	
no change of enthalpy of the fluid

Thermodynamics Working Fluids
2	 Thermodynamics Working Fluids
Behaviour of the working substance is very essential factor in understanding thermodynamics. In this 
book, focus is given to pure substances such as gases and steam properties and how they are interrelated 
are important in the design and operation of thermal systems.
The ideal gas equation is very well known approximation in relating thermal properties for a state point, 
or during a process. However, not all gases are perfect, and even the same gas, may behave as an ideal 
gas under certain circumstances, then changes into non-ideal, or real, under different conditions. There 
are other equations, or procedures to deal with such conditions. Steam or water vapour is not governed 
by simple equations but properties of water and steam are found in steam tables or charts.
2.1	
The Ideal Gas
Ideally, the behaviour of air is characterised by its mass, the volume it occupies, its temperature and the 
pressure condition in which it is kept. An ideal gas is governed by the perfect gas equation of state which relates 
the state pressure, volume and temperature of a fixed mass (m is constant) of a given gas (R is constant) as:
P5


(1)
Where	 	
P – Pressure (Pa)
	
	
V – Volume (m3)
	
	
T – Absolute Temperature (K)
	
	
T(K) = 273 + t (C)
	
	
m – mass (kg)
	
	
R – gas constant (J/kgK)
The equation of state can be written in the following forms, depending on what is needed to be calculated
1.	 In terms of the pressure 	
	
	
P = mRT
V

(2)
2.	 In terms of the volume

The specific gas constant R, is a property related to the molar mass (M) in kg/kmol, of the gas and the 
Universal gas constant Ro as
R = Ro / M
(8)
where Ro = 8314.3 J/kgK
The ideal gas equation can also be written on time basis, relating the mass flow rate (kg/s) and the 
volumetric flow rate (m3/s) as follows:
P Vt = mt R T
(9)
2.2	
Alternative Gas Equation During A Change Of State:
The equation of state can be used to determine the behaviour of the gas during a process, i.e. what 
happens to its temperature, volume and pressure if any one property is changed. This is defined by a 
simple expression relating the initial and final states such as:

Van der Waals gas Equation of state for gases
The perfect gas equation derived above assumed that the gas particles do not interact or collide with each 
other. In fact, this is not true. The simpliest of the equations to try to treat real gases was developed by 
Johannes van der Waals. Based on experiments on pure gases in his laboratory, van der Waals recognized 
that the variation of each gas from ideal behavior could be treated by introducing two additional terms 
into the ideal gas equation. These terms account for the fact that real gas particles have some finite volume, 
and that they also have some measurable intermolecular force. The two equations are presented below:

As Z approaches 1 for a gas at given conditions, the behavior of the gas approaches ideal gas behavior. 
Although, different gases have very different specific properties at various conditions; all gases behave 
in a similar manner relative to their critical pressure, Pcr and critical temparature, Tcr.
Hence, the gas pressures and temperatures are normalized by the critical values to obtain the reduced

Processes1–2, 2–3, and 3–4 represents a typical constant pressure heating of water which initially heated 
to its boiling point, (1–2), upon continued heat input it starts to evaporate at point 2, it is completely 
liquid, then gradually some of the water becomes vapour till it reaches point 3, where all the water has 
evaporated, further heating will make the water vapour superheated (process 3–4).

At point state point 2, x = 0
at state point 3, x = 1 (Figure 2.3)
Values of vf and vg and other properties for real substances are normally given in tables. Suffix ‘f’ refers

Worked Example 2.5
An unkown gas has a mass of 1.5 kg contained in a bottle of volume 1.17 m3 while at a temperature of 
300 K, and a pressure of 200 kPa. Determine the ideal gas constant and deduce the gas?
Solution:
Assuming perfect gas behaviour:
PV = mRT
200 x 103 x 1.17 = 1.5 x R x 300
?R = 520 J/kgK
but R = Ro
M
hence  M = Ro/R = 8314.3/520 = 15.99
The nearest gas with such a molar mass is Methane, for which M=16.02 kg/Kmol.
The small difference may be attributed to measurements errors.

Solution:
a)	 Constant pressure process
h1= 3230.9
h2 = 2804.2
Thermal energy available Q=m × (h2 – h1) = (300/60)*(3230.9 – 2804.2) = 2133.5 kW
b)	 It can be seen from the table that the temperature at saturation is 233.90 C, so if the 
equation for heat exchange is used, then it is possible to state that:
Q = m.Cp.(Τ2 − Τ1)
Hence Cp = Q / (m × (Τ2 − Τ1) = 2133.5 /(2 × (500 – 233.9) = 4.009 kJ/kg K.
Which is lower than that at lower pressures, at 1 bar Cp for water is about 4.18 kJ/kgK.

Laws of Thermodynamics
3	 Laws of Thermodynamics
There are four laws which relates the thermodynamics of substances.
3.1	
Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics
If an object with a higher temperature comes in contact with a lower temperature object, it will transfer 
heat to the lower temperature object. The objects will approach the same temperature, and in the absence 
of loss to other objects, they will maintain a single constant temperature. Therefore, thermal equilibrium 
is attained.
The “zeroth law” states that if two systems are at the same time in thermal equilibrium with a third 
system, they are in thermal equilibrium with each other.
Figure 3.1: Analogy of the Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics.
If A and C are in thermal equilibrium with B, then A is in thermal equilibrium with B. Practically this 
means that all three are at the same temperature, and it forms the basis for comparison of temperatures. 
The Zeroth Law states that:-
“two systems which are equal in temperature to a third system are equal in temperature to each other”.
3.1.1	
Methods of Measuring Temperature
The Zeroth Law means that a thermometer can be used to assign a label to any system, the label being 
the value shown on the thermometer when it is thermal equilibrium with the system. We call the 
label “temperature’’. Temperature is a function of state which determines whether a system will be in 
equilibrium with another.

Laws of Thermodynamics
To put this into practice we need a thermometer, which is a device that has some easily measured property, 
X, that varies with temperature. This might be the length of the mercury column in a mercury-in-glass 
thermometer for instance, or the pressure of a constant volume gas thermometer. We then require easily 
reproduced calibration temperatures. For instance, the Centigrade temperature scale assigns temperatures 
of 0 and 100, to the temperature of ice in equilibrium with water (known as the ice point) and to the 
temperature of boiling water (the steam point). Letting the values of X at these two points be X0 and 
X100, then the temperature in Centigrade,
Therefore, measuring temperatures may be based on one of the following properties:-
a)	 Expansion of materials due temperature variations, e.g. gas thermometer, liquid-in-glass 
thermometer, bi-metal strip.
b)	 Electrical resistance of materials.
c)	 Electro-motive force induced within a circuit made up of two dissimilar materials.
d)	 Radiative properties of surfaces.
3.1.2	
International Temperature Scale
This scale is used to calibrate temperature measuring devices. It consists of a number of fixed points of 
known temperature which can be reproduced accurately (Table 3.1).

First Law of Thermodynamics
The first law of thermodynamics is the application of the conservation of energy principle.
3.2.1	
First Law of Thermodynamics Applied to closed Systems
consider a closed system where there is no flow into or out of the system, and the fluid mass remains 
constant. For such system, the first law statement is known as the Non-Flow Energy Equation, or NFEE 
abbreviated, it can be summerised as follows:
DU  = Q – W
(25)
The first law makes use of the key concepts of internal energy (DU), heat (Q), and system work (W).
3.2.2	
Internal Energy
Internal energy is defined as the energy associated with the random, disordered motion of molecules. It 
is separated in scale from the macroscopic ordered energy associated with moving objects; it refers to the 
invisible microscopic energy on the atomic and molecular scale. For example, a room temperature glass 
of water sitting on a table has no apparent energy, either potential or kinetic. But on the microscopic 
scale it is a seething mass of high speed molecules traveling at hundreds of meters per second. If the 
water were tossed across the room, this microscopic energy would not necessarily be changed when we 
superimpose an ordered large scale motion on the water as a whole.
During a non flow process the change in internal energy is calculated assuming the closed’s system 
volume remains constant, the following equation is used
ΔU = m.Cv.ΔT

Where Cv is the specific heat capacity of the fluid, and ΔT is the temperature difference during the process
3.2.3	
Specific Heat
Heat may be defined as energy in transit from a high temperature object to a lower temperature object. 
An object does not possess “heat”; the appropriate term for the microscopic energy in an object is 
internal energy. The internal energy may be increased by transferring energy to the object from a higher 
temperature (hotter) object – this is properly called heating.
In order to heat or cool a given quantity of a gas in a given time, the following equation is used:
Quantity of Heat (Q) = mass(m) × specific heat capacity (C) × temperature difference
Since this heat exchange may take place
Either at constant pressure:	
Q = m. Cp(T2 – T1)
(27)
Or at constant volume:	
Q = m. Cv(T2 – T1)
(28)
Where:
Cp	
	
specific heat at constant pressure (kJ/kg K), see Table 3.2
Cv	
	
specific heat at constant volume (kJ/kg K), see Table 3.2
Note that for a perfect gas	
Cp = Cv + R	
and 	
n=Cp / Cv
(29)
Specific Heat at Constant Volume Cv
Consider a closed system of unit mass, the first law of thermodynamics applied to this system is:-
q – w = du
If the volume is constant, then w = 0,	
it follows that	
	
q = du
But	
	
q = Cv dT
Hence	 	
du = CvdT
Or	
	
Cv = du/dT
This is known as Joule’s Law of internal energy which states that “the internal energy of a perfect gas 
depends upon its temperature only”.

Specific Heat at Constant Pressure Cp
Consider a constant pressure non-flow process, the first law:-
q – w = du
For a constant pressure process
	
W = p(v2 –v1)	  = (p2 v2 – p1 v1)
hence 	 	
q – (p2 v2 -p1 v1) = u2 – u1
or	
	
q = (u2 + p2 v2) – (u1 + p1 v1)	
 = h2 – h1
but 	
	
q = Cp dT
hence 	 h2 – h1	
= Cp (T2 – T1)
or	
 	
Cp = dh/dT

Relationship Between Specific Heats
Since	
	
H = U + PV
	
	
dH = dU + d(PV)	
;	
d(PV) = d(mRT) = mRdT
	
	
m Cp dT = m Cv dT + m R dT
Therefore, 	
Cp = Cv + R	
	
	
Ie	
	
Cp > Cv
The ratio 	
Cp/Cv = n is called the adiabatic index.
The reason for the differences between Cp and Cv is that in the constant pressure process part of the 
heat transferred is used in doing work against the moving system boundary and all heat therefore is not 
available for raising the gas temperature.

In calculating the process work, it is important to point out that for each process, the work done will be

a)	 for a constant pressure process, the work during an isobaric process is simply:

The first law of thermodynamics is based on the conversation of energy within a system. Open systems 
are associated with those, which have a steady flow, thus the first law applied to such systems is known

With the following simplifications are made
	
Q = 0,
	
Δke = 0,
	
ΔPe = 0 are all neglected.
∴ W = m(h1 – h 2) 

With the following simplifications are made
There is no process work on the fluid	 W = 0,
If Kinetic energy and Potential energy changes Dke = 0, DPe = 0 are neglected. Then the SFEE 
reduces to:

The Second Law of Thermodynamics
The second law of thermodynamics is a general principle which places constraints upon the direction of 
heat transfer and the attainable efficiencies of heat engines. It’s implications may be visualized in terms 
of the waterfall analogy.
Figure 3.2: Analogy of the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics
3.3.1	
Second Lay of Thermodynamics – statements:
The second law, indicates that, although the net heat supplied, Q1-Q2, in a cycle is equal to the network 
done, W, the gross heat supplied, Q1 must be greater than the network done; some heat must always be 
rejected by the system.
Q1 > W, 	
or to be precise:-
W = Q1 – Q2
(44)
Where, Q1 is the heat supplied and Q2 is the heat rejected.
The ratio of network output to heat supplied is known as the thermal efficiency of the system.
There are two ways in which the second law is expressed:-
a)	 Kelvin-Planck Statement
“It is impossible to construct a system which when operating in a cycle will extract heat energy 
from a single source and do an equal amount of work on the surroundings”.
I.e. never possible to achieve 100% thermal efficiency.
b)	 Clausius Statement
“It is impossible to construct a device which when operating in a cycle has no other effect than 
the transfer of heat energy from a cool to a hotter body”.
I.e. some work is done on or by the working fluid to the surroundings or vice versa.

In 1865 Clausius observed that the amount dQ/T is proper to describe the thermodynamic phenomenon. 
This amount was named reduced heat or entropy. During a process, the change in entropy is defined as:
dS = Q/T
(45)
Definitions of Entropy:
1.	 is a state variable whose change is defined for a reversible process at T where Q is the heat 
absorbed.
2.	 a measure of the amount of energy which is unavailable to do work.
3.	 a measure of the disorder of a system.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Implications of the Second Law of Thermodynamics
Since entropy is defined as a property which remains constant during a reversible adiabatic process; it 
follows that a temperature-entropy diagram would indicate a process by a straight line perpendicular 
to the entropy axis if the process is purely isentropic Figure (Figure 3.3). The friction in an irreversible 
process will cause the temperature of the fluid to be higher than it would have been in a frictionless 
(reversible) process. The entropy increased during an irreversible process.
Isentropic Efficiency – the entropy change in an irreversible adiabatic process leads to process efficiency. 
The ideal constant entropy process is termed isentropic and the ratio of the specific work transfer in the 
ideal process to that in the actual process is called the isentropic efficiency. Since the majority of adiabatic 
machines are flow processes, isentropic efficiency is usually expressed in terms of the useful work W.

If changes in kinetic and potential energy are negligible, the SFEE may be used to rewrite these 
expressions in terms of specific enthalpy change and for a perfect gas, enthalpy change may be expressed 
by temperature change. Thus, for compression processes, (Figure 3.3):

Third Law
The entropy of a perfect crystal is zero when the temperature of a the crystal is equal to absolute zero (0 K).
• At 0 K, there is no thermal motion, and if the crystal is perfect, there will be no disorder
• Once the temperature begins to rise above 0, the particles begin to move and entropy 
gradually increases as the average kinetic energy of the particles increases.
• When temperature reaches the melting point of the substance (Tm), there is an abrupt 
increase in entropy as the substance changes from a solid to a more disordered liquid.
Again the entropy increases gradually as the motion of the particles increases until the temperature 
reaches the boiling point of the substance (Tb). At this point, there is another drastic increase in entropy 
as the substance changes from a confined liquid particles to radom motion gas particles.

(If there is a phase change between 0 K and T we would have to add the entropy of the phase change.)

for all elements and compounds in their most stable and perfect crystalline state at absolute zero and 
one atmosphere pressure. (All except for helium, which is a liquid at the lowest observable temperatures 
at one atmosphere.)
The advantage of this law is that it allows us to use experimental data to compute the absolute entropy 
of a substance. For example, suppose we want to calculate the absolute entropy of liquid water at 25°C. 
We would need to know the Cp of ice from 0 K to 273.15 K and the Cp of liquid water from 273.15 K to 
298.15 K. The value of the Entropy is determined by the following equation:

Solution:
From steam tables at 6 MPa and 500°C, 	h1 = 3422.2 kJ/kg, and s1 = 6.8803 kJ/kg K
At 10 KPa, Sf = 0.6493, and Sg = 8.1502
S2’ = s1 and x2’ is found using
Then	
	
6.8803 = 0.6493 + x2’ (8.1502-0.6493), from which x2’ = 0.917
This is the state of steam at exit from the turbine (mixed phase with dryness fraction, x=0.917)

The SFEE, reduces to: h2 = h1
at 1.0 MPa , hf = 762.81 kJ/kg and hg = 2,778 kJ/kg
h1 = 762.81 + 0.95 × (2778-762.81) = 2677.24 kJ/kg
at 10 kPa with hg = 2,585 kJ/kg
since h2 = h1 = 2677.24, which is higher then hg at 10 kPa, the steam will be in a superheated condition.

Laws of Thermodynamics
Solution:
a)	 Q - W = m (∆h + ∆ke + ∆Pe)
Q = 0 , Dke = 0 , DPe = 0 are all neglected.
∴ W = m(h1 – h 2)
h1 = 2876 kJ/kg
h2 = 417.46 + 0.85 × (2676 – 417.46) = 2337.2 kJ/kg
∴ Wideal = 1×(2876 – 2337) 	 = 539 kJ/kg
b)	 Wactual	
   = 0.8 × 539 = 431 kJ/kg
Power = m × W = (600/60)× 431 = 4.31 MW

produced, determine:
a)	 the heat supplied in the boiler.
b)	 the efficiency of the boiler.
Assume the values of enthalpies at the two state points as:
h1 = hf@40°C = 169.33 kJ/kg

A mass of gas occupying 0.08m3 at 6kN/m2 and 80°C is expanded reversibly in a non-flow process 
according to a law PV1.2 = constant. The pressure at the end of expansion is 0.7kN/m2. The gas is then 
heated at constant pressure to the original temperature. The specific heat capacities at constant pressure 
and constant volume are 1.00 and 0.74 kJ/kg K respectively. Determine:-
a)	 the work transfer in the expansion process;
b)	 the heat transfer in the expansion process;
c)	 the volume at the end of the heating process;
d)	 the change in internal energy during the heating process.

Laws of Thermodynamics
Worked Example 3.24
A reversible adiabatic air turbine drives a small generator which requires a power of 2kW. The air supply 
for the turbine is provided by a reservoir and the pressure and temperature at turbine entry may be 
considered constant at 9 bar, 20°C respectively. The velocity of the air at inlet to the turbine is small and 
may be neglected but at exit the velocity is 55m/s. The exit pressure is 1.2 bar. Calculate:
a)	 the air temperature at exit from the turbine, and
b)	 the mass flow rate of air stating any assumptions made.
Air may be considered a perfect as for which the specific heat capacity at constant pressure Cp = 
1.005 kJ/kg K and n = 1.4.
Solution:
