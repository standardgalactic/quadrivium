Preface
Preface
This book of exercises is a companion to A youtube Calculus Workbook (Part II), which is itself a 
companion to a play-list of 109 youtube video lectures covering material consistent with a second semester 
long college level Calculus course. 
Part I was similarly a companion to a play-list of 94 youtube instructional videos consistent with a 
semester long first Calculus course at the college level. This book incorporated exercises and sample tests. 
In contrast, the second part is split into the workbook which is a set of extensive notes on the material 
covered in the videos, to simplify study from the playlist, and the present book of exercises. 
The latter includes, for 31 topics, a worksheet of exercises without solutions, which are typically meant 
to be either worked out in class with the help of the teacher or assigned, a homework set consisting 
of exercises similar to those of the worksheet, and the complete solutions of the homework sets. It is 
organized to mirror the structure of the workbook, which itself references the parts of this exercises book 
that can be worked on at various points in your study.
Four Mock Tests with full solutions, as well as a Sample Final with full solutions are included to test 
yourself on a regular basis. This is meant for self study, or use in a flipped classroom setting as outlined 
below. 
I hope that only few errors are left, but some are bound to remain. I welcome feedback and comments 
at calculusvideos@gmail.com.

To the instructor: A brief description of a  
flipped classroom model
To the instructor: A brief description 
of a flipped classroom model
I have used the material in A youtube Calculus Workbook (Part II) and the exercises in the present book 
for a one semester 4 credit-hours college level second semester Calculus course, using a flipped classroom 
model. The basic pattern is that students are assigned, for each class period, a set of videos to watch, and 
a homework set on the previous lesson. Class time is devoted to questions and to the worksheets. The 
homework exercises are very similar to those of the previous worksheet.
During class time, after grading the homework and after possible questions on the videos, I would typically 
give a very quick recap of what they have learned from the videos by questioning students. After that, 
students work on the worksheet while I would walk around the classroom to help them individually 
whenever needed. On regular intervals and when I see that many have been through a couple of 
exercises, I would go to the board to go over the solutions of the first exercises. Students then return to 
working on the next exercises, and this process is iterated until the end of the class period. Worksheets 
often contain more exercises than can be covered in one class period, and exercises of various levels of 
difficulties. This way, the teacher may chose a subset of exercises adapted to his/her class and/or his/her 
choice of homework exercises.

Self-graded homework
The homework is self-graded: students take a solution set when entering the class and have 5 to 10 
minutes to read the solutions and grade themselves. This is why homework solutions in this book contain 
indications of the number of points to attribute to various parts of a question. 
When done, they return their work to the teacher with the solutions on which they have entered their 
grade. The teacher can then keep track of the grades, and verify the work of the students as needed. My 
experience is that the first couple of homework sets may necessitate feedback for the students to adjust 
to the expectations for self-grading, but after that, students are typically grading themselves very fairly 
and even tend to be harsher on themselves than expected. At any rate, I find this method very fruitful, 
for it devotes a specific time every class period to actually read solutions to exercises. This way, students 
develop a better understanding of the way to present their work and justify their answers, and of the 
expectations in that respect. Questions on whether they should get credit or not for something that 
seems different from the solution are not rare but can lead to fruitful discussions.

To the instructor: A brief description of a

Mock Tests
Before each test, the students take a mock test in class, in the conditions of the test (no notes or books). 
I encourage them to get prepared for the test for that day, so they can benefit from the mock test the 
most. At the end of the class period, they keep their work and pick up the full solutions of the mock 
test on their way out. This way they can see what mistakes they’ve made, what they knew and what they 
need to review further for the actual test.
The actual test is modeled on the review test. The Mock Test thus also serves the purpose of making 
expectations for the test (and for the extent to which answers should be justified) very clear.

Your flipped classroom
Should you decide to use A youtube Calculus Workbook (Part II) for a flipped classroom course, the 
present volume of exercises and what I described above can only be seen as an example. The homework 
sets and solutions give you an idea of how they are structured, but you should probably make your own, 
if anything because the solutions to those in this book are freely available. You may find that you need 
more extensive comments on how to assign credit to your homework sets, for instance using margin 
notes in solutions. The present examples are in the format given to my students. Instructions to grade 
are minimal as I was present to clarify whenever needed.  
You may want to spend more time on part of the material and omit other parts. It is my hope that the 
material presented here can easily be adapted to your needs.
Beyond the material, there are many parameters in the outline for the course that you may adapt to your 
needs. In particular, depending on the number of students in your class, you may want to have students 
work in groups, have them present solutions, etc.

x−1.
(a)	
[2] Find a formula for f −1; 
	
Solution. Let y =

y −2.
	
Thus f −1(y) =

x−2, with x ̸= 2.
(b)	
[3] Calculate (f −1)

NAME:
GRADE:	
/ 11 
1.	 Solve the following equations for x:
(a)	
[1] ex2e4x+4 = 1.
	
Solution. ex2e4x+4 = ex2+4x+4 and 1 = e0, so that the equation rewrites as 
ex2+4x+4 = e0,
	
which is equivalent to 
x2 + 4x + 4 = 0 = (x + 2)2,
	
because the natural exponential is one-to-one. Thus x = −2 is the unique solution. 
(b)	
[1] e5x+1 = 2;
	
Solution. 
e5x+1 = 2 ⇐⇒5x + 1 = ln 2 ⇐⇒x = ln 2 −1
5
.
(c)	
[1] ln(1 −2x) = 2;
	
Solution. 
ln(1 −2x) = 2 ⇐⇒1 −2x = e2 ⇐⇒x = 1 −e2

.
2.	 Differentiate:
(a)	
[1] f(x) = eπx;
	
Solution. Using the Chain Rule 
f ′(x) = πeπx.
(b)	
[1] f(x) = x2ex −ex2;
	
Solution. Using the Chain Rule and Product Rule 
f ′(x) = 2xex + x2ex −2xex2.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

To find A, B and C, we identify the numerators after rewriting the left-hand side with 
denominator (x −1)3: 
x2 + 1 = A(x −1)2 + B(x −1) + C,
and we set x = 1 to the effect that 2 = C. Differentiating, we obtain 
2x = 2A(x −1) + B,

x3 + 2x2 = A

we see that 
2x = Ax(x + 2) + B(x + 2) + Cx2.
Setting x = −2 gives −4 = 4C  and C = −1. Setting x = 0 gives 0 = 2B  and B = 0 (1). 
Differentiating, we have 
2 = A(x + 2) + Ax + 2Cx,
where setting x = 0 yields 2 = 2A  and A = 1. That is

sketch] At what point(s) does the curve 

x = sin(2t)

 cross itself? Find the tangent lines at 
this point, then sketch the curve.
Solution. We can restrict ourselves to t ∈[0, 2π]. The curve crosses itself if 

sin(2t1) = sin(2t2)
cos(t1) = cos(t2)
⇐⇒

sin(t1) cos(t1) = sin(t2) cos(t2)
cos(t1) = cos(t2)
⇐⇒

cos(t1) (sin t1 −sin t2) = 0
cos(t1) = cos(t2)
,
that is, if cos(t1) = cos(t2) = 0 or if both sin t1 = sin t2 and cos t1 = cos t2 which means t1 = t2 
if we restrict ourselves to t ∈[0, 2π]. Thus the only self intersection correspond to t = π

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Solution. x2 + y2 = r2 and y = r sin θ  so that 
r2 = r sin θ ⇐⇒r(r −sin θ) = 0 ⇐⇒r = sin θ
	
because the pole r = 0 is on the curve r = sin θ .

Solution. Since y = r sin θ , a polar equation is 
r sin θ = −1,
	
which we may rewrite 
r = −

sin θ = −csc θ
	
(thus obtaining a curve of the form r = f(θ)) because values of θ making sin θ = 0 do 
not correspond to points on the curve (0 ̸= −1!).

Polar curves
(b)	
[5pts: 2 for setup, 3 for calculation] shared by the cardioids r = 1 + cos θ  and r = 1 −cos θ . 
	
Solution. Sketching the curves, we obtain:
 
	
Because 
1 −cos(π −θ) = 1 + cos θ,
	
the two curves are reflection of one another about the y-axis, and they intersect on the 
y-axis (at the pole, for θ = π
2 and for θ = 3π
2 ). Thus, by symmetry, we see that the desired 
area is 4 times the shaded area, which we can interpret as the area of the region bounded 
by the angular sector 0 ≤θ ≤π

(a)	
[10] Find the points on the curve where the tangent is horizontal, and those where the

Solution. The slope of the tangent line to the curve at the point of parameter t is 
dy

The tangent is horizontal whenever dy

[10] What are the intersection points of the curve and the x-axis? Show that one of them 
is a point of self-intersection of the curve and find the tangent lines at this point.
	
Solution. The curve intersects the x-axis if y = 2 sin 3t = 0, that is,

5.	 [20] Consider the curve of polar equation

(a)	
Describe the tangent lines at the tip of each “petal” of this curve. 
	
Solution. Note that |r| ≤1 so that r  is maximal when sin(3θ) = ±1, that is, if 
3θ = π
2 + kπ ⇐⇒θ = π
6 + k π

θ∈[0,2π)

Moreover, that corresponds to only 3 “tips of petals”, for r( π
6 ) = 1 and r( 7π
6 ) = −1 
represent the same point, r( π
2 ) = −1 and r( 3π
2 ) = 1 represent the same point, and 
r( 5π
6 ) = 1 and r( 11π
6 ) = −1 represent the same point. At any of these points, the tangent 
line is perpendicular to the radius joining the pole to the point, for this radius has slope 
tan θ  while the tangent has slope 
dy
dx = r′ sin θ + r cos θ
r′ cos θ −r sin θ = 3 cos(3θ) sin θ + sin(3θ) cos θ
3 cos(3θ) cos θ −sin(3θ) sin θ = −cot θ
	
whenever cos(3θ) = 0, which happens at each one of these points. Thus, for 
θ ∈

 the product of the slopes is –1 and the two lines are perpendicular. 
At π

[3: 1 decreasing, 1 bounded above, 1 bounded below] an = 2n+3

Solution. Since an = f(n) for f(x) = 2x+3
3x−2 and 
f ′(x) = 2(3x −2) −3(2x + 3)
(3x −2)2
= −
13
(3x −2)2 < 0
	
we conclude that f(x)is decreasing, and therefore {an}∞
n=1 is also decreasing. Thus, 
{an}∞
n=1 is bounded above by a1 = 5 and below by 0, because the sequence has only 
positive terms. Thus, {an}∞
n=1 is bounded.

n=1 is neither (eventually) increasing nor decreasing, for 
it takes alternatively positive and negative values. On the other hand, it is bounded, for 
|an| =

ln(n+1) is decreasing so that

We prove it by induction, that is, we prove that an ≤an+1 and an ≤1 for all n. We have 
already verified it for n = 1 for a1 = 1
2 ≤a2 = 7
8 and a1 ≤1. Assume now that for some 
n, an ≤an+1 and an ≤1. Note that f(x) = (x −1)3 + 1 is a non-decreasing function 
for f ′(x) = 3(x −1)2 ≥0. Thus 
an ≤an+1
=⇒
an+1 = f(an) ≤f(an+1) = an+2
an ≤1
=⇒
an+1 = f(an) ≤f(1) = 1.
	
The sequence {an}∞
n=1 is non-decreasing and bounded above, therefore convergent. Let 
L := limn→∞an. Then f(L) = L, so that 
(L −1)3 + 1 = L
⇐⇒
(L −1)3 −(L −1) = 0
⇐⇒
(L −1)

(L −1)2 −1

= 0
⇐⇒
L = 1
(L −1)2 = 1
⇐⇒
L = 1
L −1 = ±1
⇐⇒
L = 1
L = 0
L = 2.
	
Since {an}∞
n=1 is non-decreasing with a1 = 1
2, L ̸= 0, and since {an}∞
n=1 is bounded 
above by 1, L ̸= 2. Thus limn→∞an = 1.

[4 similarly] What is the limit of {an}∞
n=1 if a1 = 3
2? Justify your answer.
	
Solution. The first few terms are 
a1 = 1 + 1
2, a2 = 1 + 1
8, a3 = 1 + 1
83 , . . .
	
so that it seems that 
an = 1 +
1
23n−1 ,
	
for all n, which we set out to prove by induction. This is true for n = 1. 
	
Assume it is true for some n. Then

23n .
	
Thus 
lim
n→∞an = lim
n→∞1 +
1
23n−1 = 1.
	
Alternatively, we see from the first few terms that the sequence seems non-increasing 
and bounded below by 1. We prove it by induction, that is, we prove that an ≥an+1 and 
an ≥1 for all n. We have already verified it for n = 1 for a1 = 3
2 ≥a2 = 9
8 and a1 ≥1. 
Assume now that for some n, an ≥an+1 and an ≥1. Since f(x) = (x −1)3 + 1 is a 
non-decreasing function 
an ≥an+1
=⇒
an+1 = f(an) ≥f(an+1) = an+2
an ≥1
=⇒
an+1 = f(an) ≥f(1) = 1.
	
The sequence {an}∞
n=1 is non-increasing and bounded below, therefore convergent. 
We already have seen that the possible limits are 0, 1, and 2, and the we conclude that 
limn→∞an = 1 for 2 is not possible because {an}∞
n=1 is non-increasing with a1 = 3
2 and  
0 is not possible because {an}∞
n=1 is bounded below by 1.

Solution. The first few terms are 
a1 = 3, a2 = 9, a3 = 513, a4 = 134217729, . . .
	
so that it seems that the sequence grows without bounds. Indeed, we prove by induction 
that 
an = 23n−1 + 1
	
for all n. It is true for n = 1. Assume it is true for some n. Then 
an+1 = (an −1)3 + 1 =

Solution. We proceed by induction. In (a), we have already verified the case n = 1. 
	
Assume that it is true for some n. Note that f(x) = 1 + x −x2
3  is decreasing for x > 3
2 
for f ′(x) = 1 −2
3x . Thus 
3

=⇒
f(2) ≤f(a2n+1) ≤f(a2n) ≤f
3
2

=⇒
3
2 ≤f(2) = 5
3 ≤a2n+2 ≤a2n+1 ≤1.75 ≤2,
	
which proves the property by induction.
(c)	
[2] Show that {a2n}∞
n=1 is convergent.
	
Solution. By the previous question {a2n}∞
n=1 is bounded. We show by induction that 
it is non-decreasing, that is, that a2n ≤a2n+2 for all n. We have already verified it for 
n = 1 because a2 < a4. Assume that it is true for some n. Then, since all terms of the 
sequence are at least 3
2, we can use the fact that f is non-decreasing, and thus, that f ◦f  
is increasing to the effect that 
a2n ≤a2n+2 =⇒a2n+2 = f ◦f(a2n) ≤f ◦f(a2n+2) = a2n+4,
	
which completes the proof that {a2n}∞
n=1 is non-decreasing. Since it is also bounded, it 
is convergent.

[2] Show that {a2n+1}∞
n=1 is convergent.
	
Solution. By (b), {a2n+1}∞
n=1 is bounded. We show by induction that it is non-increasing, 
that is, that a2n+1 ≥a2n+3 for all n. We have already verified it for n = 1 because a3 > a5. 
Assume that it is true for some n. Then, since all terms of the sequence are at least 3
2, we 
can use the fact that f is non-decreasing, and thus, that f ◦f  is increasing to the effect 
that 
a2n+1 ≥a2n+3 =⇒a2n+3 = f ◦f(a2n+1) ≤f ◦f(a2n+3) = a2n+5,
	
which completes the proof that {a2n+1}∞
n=1 is non-increasing. Since it is also bounded, 
it is convergent.
(e)	
[3] Admitting that limn→∞a2n+1 −a2n = 0, deduce limn→∞an.
	
Solution. If limn→∞a2n+1 −a2n = 0 and {a2n}∞
n=1 and {a2n+1}∞
n=1 are both convergent, 
then 
lim
n→∞a2n = lim
n→∞a2n+1 = lim
n→∞an
	
and {an}∞
n=1 converges. Let L := limn→∞an. Then f(L) = L  because f is continuous. 
Thus 
1 + L −L2
3 = L ⇐⇒L2 = 3 ⇐⇒L = ±
√
3.
	
Moreover, only 
√
3 is between 3
2 and 2 as terms of an  for n > 1. Thus 
lim
n→∞an =
√
3.

3.	 (Bonus) Achilles and a Tortoise have a race. The tortoise gets a 1000 feet head start, but 
Achilles runs 10 ft/s while the tortoise only runs 0.01 ft/s. Zeno of Elea (ca. 490–430 BC) 
proposed the following paradox, known as Zeno’s paradox, to show that motion is nothing 
but an illusion: When Achilles reaches the tortoise’s starting point, she has moved ahead, 
although by a short distance. By the time Achilles reaches that new point, the tortoise has 
again moved a short distance ahead, and so on. Thus, it seems that Achilles can never catch 
up. Using series, explain why it is not the case, and calculate the time it takes Achilles to 
pass the Tortoise.

3.	 [Bonus:+5] Achilles and a Tortoise have a race. The tortoise gets a 1000 feet head start, but 
Achilles runs 10 ft/s while the tortoise only runs 0.01 ft/s. Zeno of Elea (ca. 490–430 BC) 
proposed the following paradox, known as Zeno’s paradox, to show that motion is nothing 
but an illusion: When Achilles reaches the tortoise’s starting point, she has moved ahead, 
although by a short distance. By the time Achilles reaches that new point, the tortoise has 
again moved a short distance ahead, and so on. Thus, it seems that Achilles can never catch 
up. Using series, explain why it is not the case, and calculate the time it takes Achilles to 
pass the Tortoise. 
Solution. When Achilles reaches the tortoise starting point, he has covered 1000 feet at 10ft/s, 
hence 100s have passed. Meanwhile, the tortoise has moved ahead by 0.01 × 100 = 1 ft . Achilles 
covers this feet in 0.1 second, and the tortoise has then moved ahead by 0.01 × 0.1 = 0.001 ft. 
It takes Achilles 0.0001 second to cover this distance, and meanwhile the tortoise moved ahead 
by 0.01 × 0.0001 = 0.000001 ft. As we iterate this process, the limit of the distance between 
Achilles and the tortoise is 0 and the time it takes Achilles to reach the tortoise is the sum of 
the geometric series

Solution. This series is of the form ∞

x2+3x+2 is non-negative 
continuous and decreasing on [1, ∞) for 
f ′(x) = 2(x2 + 3x + 2) −(2x + 3)2

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Solution. This series is convergent by the Alternating Series Test for

n=1 is decreasing with

Hence the error made in the approximation sn ≈∞
n=1

n2  is less than 10−3 whenever 
1
(n + 1)2 ≤10−4 ⇐⇒n + 1 ≥102 ⇐⇒n ≥99.
Thus 99 terms would be necessary to guarantee this accuracy.

Thus, the remainder Rn = ∞

n2 is a convergent p-series ( p = 2 > 1), so that, by Comparison, ∞

Moreover the error made in the approximation

so that we need n = 10000 to guarantee an error less than 10−4.
Alternatively, we can also use the Integral Test because f(x) =

x2+4 is a continuous, positive, 
decreasing function on [1, ∞), with antiderivative F(x) = 1

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!
