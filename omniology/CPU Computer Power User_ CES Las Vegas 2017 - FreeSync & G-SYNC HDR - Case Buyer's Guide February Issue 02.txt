Mushkin Introduces New SSDs, 
Including Helix, Its First M.2 Line
Among the new storage products Mushkin unveiled at 
CES in January was Helix, the company’s first PCIe 3.0 
SSD with an M.2 2280 form factor. Helix operates on the 
NVMe 1.2 protocol and has an SMI SM2260 controller 
and 3D MLC flash. It sports sequential read speeds up 
to 2.5GBps and sequential write speeds up to 1.1GBps. 
Random 4K read speeds for Helix reach up to 232K IOPS, 
and random 4K writes reach up to 185K IOPS. Mushkin 
says it will eventually roll out Helix models this year in 
multiple capacities ranging from 250GB to 2TB, with the 
first models arriving in Q1. Although the company hasn’t 
released specific pricing, enthusiasts should be pleased when 
the products hit shelves. Company officials say Mushkin 
intends to be extremely competitive with Helix pricing 
across all models, but particularly at the larger capacities.

Aerocool Ventures Into Gaming 
Furniture Territory With AC120/220
Aerocool announced it is expanding its product focus 
beyond cases, power supplies, and cooling products with the 
launch of the AC120 and AC220, two new lines of gaming 
chairs. The company says the sleek design of its new chair 
lines was influenced by the racing stripe motif and carbon-
fiber look of modern racing cars. Each model is available 
in six color combinations: black/white, black/blue, black/
red, black/green, black/orange, and full black. The chairs 
can support people up to 330 pounds, and the backs recline 
to a horizontal position so you can lay completely flat for 
napping. Aerocool hasn’t yet announced pricing for the two 
chair models, but the company says they both should be 
available at retailers sometime in March. 
Toshiba’s BG Class SSDs Include 
World’s Smallest NVMe Drives
Toshiba’s storage division has been showing off its new award-
winning BG Class SSD product lines. The BG Class products 
are ball-grid array drives with Toshiba’s BiCs FLASH memory 
that uses three bits per cell (TLC, or Triple Level Cell). The 
BG Class represents the world’s smallest SSDs operating with 
the NVMe PCIe Gen3 x2 interface. The two models currently 
available in the BG lineup include one in a removable M.2 
2230 format and one using the 1620 form factor. Both models 
are meant to be used in small and thin mobile devices and 
have ultra-low power requirements. The drives have a Toshiba 
controller and use HMB (Host Memory Buffer) technology 
that boosts performance despite their small size. The drives will 
be offered in 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB capacities, and you 
can expect more drives in other formats to follow. Toshiba says 
its new BG Class products will give users a cost-effective way 
to upgrade to SSDs with NVMe performance. 
Thermaltake’s The Tower 900 
Is A Huge Showcase For Components 
The Tower 900 case from Thermaltake was designed in 
collaboration with Watermod France, and it was built with 
liquid cooling in mind. The case is huge; it measures 29.6 x 
16.7 x 19 inches (HxWxD) and weighs 54 pounds. It can 
hold radiators up to 560mm on both the left and right sides, 
plus there’s plenty of room elsewhere for liquid-cooling fiends 
to stuff additional rads. The case handles motherboards from 
Mini-ATX to E-ATX, and it has room for graphics cards to 
400mm; CPU coolers to 260mm; and PSUs to 220mm. You 
can put four 140mm fans on the left and right sides, plus two 
140mm fans on the top and rear. There are six 3.5/2.5-inch 
drive bays with the HDD cage, one 5.25-inch bay, and two 2.5-
inch bays with the HDD tray. The chassis has eight expansion 
slots, and it comes in white or black. The Tower 900 from 
Thermaltake has an MSRP of $249.99.

IBuyPower’s Snowblind Now Online
IBuyPower is now taking pre-orders for Snowblind N450 
systems on its website. The Snowblind system was first revealed 
at the Computex trade show last June, and it was on display 
again at the CES trade show in January. The system uses an 
LCD panel as a side window in a white iBuyPower Noctis 
chassis. IBuyPower says it collaborated with Intel in designing 
the Snowblind, and Rainmeter, the desktop customization 
company, also created special widgets for the system. The 
widgets can be used as skins for aesthetic purposes or to show 
pertinent system information. The customization possibilities 
are endless, but when the LCD panel used in Snowblind is 
turned off, the case simply appears to have a regular clear side 
panel. You can outfit the Snowblind with various components, 
and iBuyPower currently has three variations available for 
pre-order: Snowblind ($1,499), Snowblind Pro ($1,799), 
and Snowblind Extreme ($2,499). Buyers can customize 
components on all three models. 
ASUS Announces First ROG 
Router, The Rapture GT-AC5300 
ASUS has upgraded its RT-AC5300 router with several new 
features and a sharp-looking Republic Of Gamers logo. The 
new ROG Rapture GT-AC5300 router is the first router to 
carry the ROG brand name. Like the RT-5300, the ROG 
version is a tri-band router operating with two 5GHz bands 
and one 2.4GHz band, and it has a total bandwidth of 
5,334Mbps. It has eight antennas in a 4 x 4 MIMO setup. 
The ROG Rapture GT includes twice as many gigabit LAN 
ports as the RT unit (eight, compared with four in the 
RT), and it has two USB 3.0 ports compared with the RT’s 
one. It also comes with a 1GHz quad-core 64-bit processor 
and a gigabyte of memory. ASUS has not yet announced 
availability or pricing.
ASRock Refreshes Mini PC Line 
With DeskMini RX/GTX Systems
ASRock has been hard at work on its new mini PC systems. 
The company announced at CES that it will refresh its 
small-form-factor computer lineup with new barebones 
systems based on its microSTX motherboard. The new 
motherboard is slightly longer than the Mini-STX board 
the company released a few months ago, and it features 
three ultra M.2 sockets and support for Intel’s latest 
7th-Generation Core processors. ASRock says the new 
DeskMini RX/GTX is the “world’s first” system based on 
a microSTX form factor. The DeskMini RX Micro STX 
comes with an Intel i7-7700K processor and AMD RX470 
MXM graphics card. The case for the system is just 2.7 liters 
in size. Pricing has not been released.

New System Could Lead To Fully 
Automated Speech Recognition  
Speech-recognition systems today rely on machine learning: 
poring through millions of audio files and transcriptions to 
learn the acoustic features that correspond with typed words, 
according to researchers at MIT. But a new system could reduce 
the cost and time needed to develop such a system by instead 
analyzing the correspondence between images and spoken 
descriptions of those images. “The goal of this work is to try to 
get the machine to learn language more like the way humans 
do,” said Jim Glass, a senior research scientist at CSAIL. 
Researchers tested the system using a database of 1,000 images 
and associated recordings of free-form verbal descriptions. They 
then gave the system one of the recordings and asked it to 
retrieve 10 images that best matched the recording; the system 
was able to return the correct image 31% of the time. Given 
that, Glass said the system under development is “taking baby 
steps” and has a long way to go. “But it’s an encouraging start.”
Research Aims To Make
Big Data More Meaningful
In many cases, big data represents the future of technology and 
helping consumers and companies make better decisions. But 
one challenge is finding systems that can store, manage, and 
interpret all the data. Researchers 
at MIT and Israel’s University 
of Haifa are working to solve 
that. At a high level, the coreset-
generation technique identifies 
a small subset of your data that 
preserves the salient mathematical 
relationships of the entire data 
set, according to MIT. You can 
then use that smaller data set and 
analyze it in ways that would be 
prohibitively time-consuming on 
the full data set. MIT reports that 
the technique is tailored to data 
analysis tools with applications 
in areas such as natural-language 
processing, computer vision, 
recommendation systems, 
weather prediction, and more. 
To test the technique, researchers 
worked with a matrix mapping 
every article against every word in the English version of Wikipedia 
and were able to come up with clusters of words that denote the 
100 most common topics on Wikipedia.

Study: Average Broadband Speed 
Continues Rapid Increase 
The Federal Communications Commission released its latest 
report on the performance of fixed broadband internet access 
service and, for the most part, the news is good. Broadband 
speeds available to the average consumer continue to increase 
rapidly, and service providers are delivering speeds that meet 
or exceed the speeds they advertise. But not everyone reaps 
the benefits: average DSL speeds have only increased slightly 
in the past five years, and satellite speeds have remained 
constant, according to the 
report, which looked at 
2015 numbers. Since 2011, 
the median download speed 
has almost quadrupled, the 
FCC reports, going from 
10Mbps in March 2011 to 
39Mbps in September 2015. 
When looking at the speeds 
advertised by service providers, 
the FCC found that subscribers to fixed cable and fiber 
broadband experienced speeds that were 100% or better than 
advertised speeds, but the actual speeds experienced on satellite 
technologies were, on average, slower than those advertised. 
Future launches of more advanced satellites should solve this, 
the FCC notes. The report also delves into latency and packet 
loss. Little surprise here, but subscribers to DSL, cable, and fiber 
systems generally experienced low latency, while consumers using 
cable, satellite, and fiber systems had the least packet loss.
FTC Launches IoT Security Challenge
It’s no secret that Internet of Things devices—all those “things” 
that connect to the internet and provide information and services 
with the goal of improving our lives—can be insecure. The folks at 
the FTC believe that private citizens are up to the task of making 
those devices more secure and launched the IoT Home Inspector 
Challenge. It will award a $25,000 top prize to the individual or 
team that develops the best tool to help protect consumers from 
security vulnerabilities caused by out-of-date software on the IoT 
devices in their homes. Contestants are encouraged to create a 
tool with other valuable features such as addressing hard-coded, 
factory default, or easy-to-guess passwords, according to the FTC. 
Tools could be physical devices, apps or cloud-based services, or 
dashboards or other user interfaces. To enter, you need a video 
demonstrating how the tool would work, using either a prototype, 
mockup, or other means. Entries also need to include both an 
easy-to-understand abstract explaining how the tool functions 
and a more detailed explanation. Find more information on the 
competition at www.ftc.gov/iot-home-inspector-challenge.
SITE SEEING
global news should come as little surprise: the U.S. election

PC Gaming Hardware 
Sales = $30 Billion
For the first time ever, global sales of PC 
gaming hardware have surpassed $30 billion. 
The market, which comprises DIY and pre-built 
gaming PCs, upgrades, and accessories, is 
forecast by market research outfit Jon Peddie 
to grow at a nice 6% clip for the next several 
years. The research company breaks down the 
overall market into three segments—entry-
level, midrange, and high-end—and says that 
computer gaming enthusiasts are in all three parts of the market. The company also reports that as 
more and more basic computing functions are capable of being performed by mobile devices such as 
the phone or tablet, the PC is becoming more of a tool for power users who want to do things such as 
create content, edit photos and video, and (of course) play games.

you connect a PCIe SSD to the M.2 or 
U.2 port.
Smart Fan 5 is one of the best 
upgrades on GIGABYTE/AORUS Z270 
motherboards. On the GA-Z270X-Ultra 
Gaming, GIGABYTE provides you 
with five 4-pin, hybrid fan headers that 
support both PWM and voltage modes. 
The intelligent fan headers automatically 
detect what type of cooling device 
you have connected, such as a liquid-
cooling pump or CPU, and adjust power 
delivery accordingly. Within the BIOS or 
GIGABYTE’s System Information Viewer 
utility, you can configure a fan’s rpm 
curve with custom temperature intervals. 
There are also six temperature sensors on 
the motherboard, and you can link each 
fan header to a particular sensor. This way, 
you have more control over heat triggers 
and system airflow.
Similar to previous GIGABYTE 
models aimed at gamers, the GA-Z270X-
Ultra Gaming comes with AMP-UP 
Audio to enhance onboard sound quality. 
GIGABYTE installs Realtek’s new 
ALC1220 that supports up to 120dB 
heatsinks and two of the PCIe slots, and 
between the DIMM slots. Its across-the-
board illumination makes it as much of 
a showcase piece as any AORUS option. 
There’s almost no drop in performance 
either. The GA-Z270X-Ultra Gaming 
supports up to 64GB of DDR4-3866, can 
handle SLI (up to 2-way) and CrossFire 
(up to 3-way), and natively supports both 
M.2 and U.2 PCIe SSDs.
With only one M.2 port, the storage 
subsystem is one area where the GA-
Z270X-Ultra Gaming takes a slight step 
back from the AORUS GA-Z270X-
Gaming 5. Due to the short list of PCIe 
SSDs that support U.2, we’d prefer to 
see two M.2 ports, rather than one M.2 
and U.2 port. It’s nice to see that the GA-
Z270X-Ultra Gaming’s M.2 slot supports 
type 2242/2260/2280/22110 form 
factors, so you can use 
any size M.2 SSD. Six 
6Gbps SATA ports are 
also present to support 
conventional SATA 
SSDs. The SATA ports 
all remain active when

IGABYTE’s motherboard division 
went through a big change at the 
beginning of the year. The company 
introduced AORUS as its premium 
gaming brand and released a whole lineup 
of high-end AORUS motherboards based 
on the newly minted Z270 chipset. With 
AORUS taking most of the upper echelon 
of Z270 motherboards, it’s fair to wonder 
what GIGABYTE has in store for more 
mainstream options. If the GA-Z270X-
Ultra Gaming is any indication, it appears 
GIGABYTE hasn’t held much back from 
its AORUS lineups.
The GA-Z270X-Ultra Gaming 
($164.99) stacks up well against the 
AORUS GA-Z270X-Gaming 5 ($194.99) 
we reviewed last month. It boasts RGB 
LEDs along most PCB edges, under the

might drive up the motherboard’s price, 
such as a second NIC or additional USB 
ports. The mainboard’s RGB lighting also 
sets it apart from much of the under $175 
competition—an important note for 
systems with a side panel window.  ■

The GA-Z270X-Ultra Gaming’s 
well-rounded design translated to 
solid numbers in our benchmarks. 
With a little help from Intel’s Core i7-
7700K, the board delivered excellent 
scores in Cinebench 15 (988 points) 
and POV-Ray 3.7 (2117.36 pixels 
per second). Our test system’s 32GB 
of Corsair Vengeance LED DDR4-
3200MHz played nicely with the 
mainboard, too, producing 36GBps 
in SiSoftware Sandra 2016’s Memory 
Bandwidth test. In games, we were 
able to top 100fps in Metro: Last Light 
(108fps) and Dying Light (110fps) by 
SNR, multi-channel surround sound, 
and hardware decoding of DSD128. The 
GA-Z270X-Ultra Gaming also features a 
smart headphone amp that automatically 
detects the impedance of your headset 
or headphones to deliver a low, medium, 
or high impedance audio. If you own 
a USB headset with a long cable, you 
want to connect it to one of the two USB 
DAC-UP 2 ports on the rear I/O panel. 
The yellow USB 3.0 ports have dedicated 
power to provide a clean, low noise signal 
that can compensate for voltage drop. 
USB DAC-UP 2 might also help to 
overcome power deficiency issues with 
gaming gear that draws a lot of power 
from the USB ports. 
Motherboards in the $150 to $175 
price range typically don’t boast much, 
if any, overclocking and troubleshooting 
extras. GIGABYTE equips the GA-
Z270X-Ultra Gaming with enough 
basics to get you started. To start, there 
are some robust heatsinks on the VRM 
and PCH. The heatsinks also feature an 
attractive brushed aluminum exterior. 
To help you troubleshoot problems, 
GIGABYTE includes a series of status

MSI Z270 GAMING PRO CARBON
CARBON includes both a standard Type-A 
and a reversible Type-C USB 3.1 port on 
its rear panel. The USB 3.1 ports, as well as 
one of the USB 3.0 ports, are equipped with 
MSI’s VR Boost technology to produce a 
clean, strong signal when you connect VR 
cables 10 feet or more in length.
When it comes to performance parts, 
the Z270 GAMING PRO CARBON 
matches up well with other mid-range 
Z270 motherboards. There are four 
DDR4 slots that support up to 64GB of 
3800MHz memory. The board supports 
up to a 3-way CrossFire or 2-way SLI 
GPU configuration, and if you install 
two cards, each will operate at x8 speed. 
As we mentioned earlier, the board’s 
bottom PCIe x16 slot can also be used 
with a PCIe add-in card SSD, and this 
slot doesn’t share bandwidth with the 
board’s M.2 or the SATA ports. The 
majority of the memory, GPU, and M.2 
slots are protected by MSI’s Steel Armor 
technology that strengthens the slot and 
shields it from EMI.
includes two M.2 slots that support Intel’s 
Optane technology, as well as RAID 
configurations. For the latter, MSI provides its 
M.2 GENIE utility that lets you easily create 
RAIDs with any PCIe SSD, including add-in 
cards (via the bottom PCIe x16 slot) or a U.2 
SSD (requires optional Turbo U.2 host card).
The top M.2 slot supports 2242/2260/
2280/22110 form factor M.2 SSDs, and the 
bottom M.2 slot is slightly shorter and only 
supports 2242/2260/2280 form factors. To 
reduce the chance of thermal throttling on 
your M.2 SSD, MSI includes an M.2-sized 
heat spreader that should work with any M.2 
SSD. The metal cover is similar to the heat 
spreaders you see on system memory, and 
it includes a thermal pad to transfer heat 
away from the NAND. MSI also includes an 
X-Boost utility that can further speed up the 
performance of storage and USB devices. 
MSI provides USB 3.1 connectivity 
by adding ASMedia’s 2142 USB 3.1 Gen 
2 controller, which is said to double the 
bandwidth when you connect multiple USB 
3.1 devices. The Z270 GAMING PRO 
T
o compete in today’s motherboard market, 
it’s no longer enough for a mainboard 
to support the latest hardware and up-
and-coming standards. Nor are enthusiasts 
surprised to see high-end amenities for 
onboard audio and networking—or other 
fancy gaming extras. Truly outstanding 
motherboards must now also look exceptional 
and be customizable to a build’s color scheme. 
The Z270 GAMING PRO CARBON is 
one of the most stylish options in MSI’s Z270 
lineup. Carbon fiber on the heatsinks and rear 
I/O panel give the black PCB a nice finish, 
and MSI’s Mystic Light RGB illumination 
adds some subtle flash to several areas of the 
motherboard, or you can turn them off if you 
want. A 4-pin header on the board also lets 
you match the board’s lights to a third-party 
12V RGB LED strip. 
With the Z270 chipset in tow, 
this motherboard features several big 
improvements over MSI’s Z170A GAMING 
PRO CARBON. The previous-generation 
board, for example, only has one M.2 slot, 
while the Z270 GAMING PRO CARBON 
“. . . it bears a level of 
sophistication that you 
don’t see in many 
mid-range motherboards.”

and Dying Light (112fps). Results in 
the processor-intensive tests were

as the ASMedia 3.1 Gen 2 controller 
and VR Boost ports. The performance

Rosewill GUNGNIR X
GUNGNIR X is free of embellishments. 
On the whole, this case leans toward 
“restrained” rather than “garish.”
To really appreciate the solid 
design choices Rosewill made with 
the GUNGNIR X, just pry off its 
side panels. Inside, you’ll see that the 
GUNGNIR X is equipped to handle a 
wide range of components. For example, 
the motherboard tray is built for ATX 
and E-ATX mobos, but it’s perfectly 
compatible with mATX and Mini-ITX 
motherboards, too. Continuing to explore 
the motherboard tray, the CPU cooler 
cutout is more than ample, while a 
pair of small, rectangular cutouts make 
it easy to run cables to the connectors 
on top edge of your motherboard. The 
GUNGNIR X’s three dedicated 2.5-inch 
drive brackets hide on the back of the 
M
ost of the time, you can tell if 
a particular case manufacturer 
“gets it” by looking at that company’s 
latest offerings. In a market overflowing 
with options, those that recognize 
and implement current trends typically 
produce the best cases, and those that 
don’t usually find themselves going out of 
business. Rosewill has a good track record 
of staying abreast of what enthusiasts value 
in a case, so we weren’t surprised to see 
the GUNGNIR X arrive on our doorstep 
bristling with features on our wish list.
On the outside, the GUNGNIR 
X makes a muted artistic statement 
rather than shout at you. Aside from 
the generous window on the left side 
panel, an asymmetrical glossy plastic 
façade adorning its front panel, and an 
LED fan attached to the rear panel, the 
motherboard tray, each secured with a 
thumbscrew.
Indeed, the GUNGNIR X goes 
out of its way to help you conceal the 
components you’d prefer to keep out of 
sight. A PSU shroud nearly spans the 
entirety of the case from front to back, 
leaving just enough room for you to 
add a radiator to the two 120mm fans 
preinstalled behind the front panel. The 
shroud also contains a pair of 2.5-/3.5-
inch drive bays. A second shroud on the 
right side of the motherboard tray covers 
up a pair of cable management holes; 
with an ATX or E-ATX motherboard 
installed, only the connectors of any 
cables that pass through the shrouded 
holes should be exposed. (The main 
ATX power cable is an exception.) We 
also found plenty of room between the 
motherboard tray and right side panel to 
wrangle system cables.
Builders can round out their systems 
with multiple high-end graphics card 
and a mighty liquid-cooling loop if they 
choose the GUNGNIR X. Graphics 
cards up to 16.5 inches long, which 
is basically all of them, are welcome 
inside the case. Although the case 
supports radiators up to 280mm and 
360mm along the front and top panels, 
respectively, hanging a triple rad from 
the GUNGNIR X’s rafters isn’t as simple 
as the spec sheet would lead you to 
believe. Expect an extremely tight fit 
unless you remove the 5.25-inch drive 
bay, something that—let’s face it—is a 
questionable inclusion to begin with.
Still, the GUNGNIR X gives you a lot 
of case for 75 bucks. If you want to build 
a powerful rig, this box lets you do it. ■

DXRacer Iron Series 
With the Iron Series, DXRacer isn’t 
setting out to reinvent the office chair. The 
two-tone seat features many of the same 
features you’ve probably come to recognize 
as hallmarks of the brand, including the high 
backrest designed to deliver support from 
your tailbone to your occipital ridge. The 
five-point base of the Iron Series, like most of 
DXRacer’s premium chairs, is constructed of 
aluminum and painted black. 
You can’t tell from the photos, but 
the 3-inch casters are a good deal larger 
than typical office chair casters, and 
moving the chair while seated is smooth 
in all directions. There is a 4-inch gas-
spring lift mechanism operated using the 
underseat paddle on the right and the 
two-position paddle on the left lets you 
rock the chair back and lock it to your 
desired position. You can also tilt the back 
of the chair up to 135 degrees using the 
lever on the right and even adjust the arm 
rests up and down, forward and back, 
and angle them outward to maintain a 
high level of comfort for hours on end. 
If you’ve never had an office chair that is 
D
XRacer makes premium chairs that 
appeal to those who value comfort, 
ergonomics, and aesthetics, in no particular 
order. The latest chair we’ve had the pleasure 
of reviewing is the new high-end Iron Series, 
model OH/IS166/NE. The latter two letters 
of the model indicate the color, and as usual, 
we opted for the green and black one. 
There is a test I like to perform whenever 
I’m presented with an item labeled “some 
assembly required,” and while it’s hardly 
scientific, its results do tend to say something 
about build quality and the balance between 
form and function. Basically, it entails 
unwrapping and laying out all the parts on 
the floor, tucking the assembly manual neatly 
away in a drawer, and then putting the thing 
together using nothing more than my wits and 
will (and sometimes a hammer). DXRacer’s 
chairs have always aced this test (no hammer 
required). So this time, I decided to see if I 
could go from sealed box to game-ready chair 
with even the lumbar and neck pillows in 
place in less than 20 minutes. But before I 
reveal whether or not the DXRacer Iron Series 
chair prevailed, let’s get to the important stuff. 
as fully adjustable as the Iron Series from 
DXRacer, you’re really missing out. 
The chair’s frame, covered in high-density 
mold-shaping foam, has a lifetime warranty 
and the accessories are guaranteed for two 
years. Like many of the DXRacer chairs we 
use in the office, this one is coated in bicast 
leather, which looks and feels like the real 
deal. You can get the Iron Series in orange, 
white, black, red, blue, or green. Sitting in 
this chair for a full workday quickly became 
preferable to sitting in our pricey—and 
decidedly bland—office chairs. 
The Iron Series chair feels solid and well-
made, but it’s still light enough to easily 
move from a sitting or standing position. 
Getting back to my timed assembly: I 
managed to accomplish complete assembly 
in 17 minutes, and a good portion of that 
time was just spent wrestling with the 
plastic wrap covering most of the parts.
They’ve done it again. The DXRacer Iron 
Series is another fantastically comfortable 
chair that looks as good as it feels. ■

way, and the front panel will also 
support a 360mm radiator.
While we’re on the subject of fans, 
Rosewill includes a three-position fan 
control switch up front by the USB 
and audio I/O ports. The switch’s 
internal connector, which is located on 
the back of the motherboard tray, will 
accommodate up to five fans.
The CULLINAN sports the clean, 
drive-cage-free interior that’s in vogue 
these days, thanks to a built-in metal 
power supply shroud, a dual-bay 3.5-
inch drive cage behind said shroud, and 
the three 2.5-inch drive mounts Rosewill 
attaches to the rear of the motherboard 
tray. Having a clutter-free interior 
is even more important when your 
entire left-side panel is made of glass; 
the result of these features combined 
with a motherboard tray that’s designed 
specifically to make cable management 
a snap means the CULLINAN will 
proudly show off the stuff you want 
to show off—and not much else. The 
I
n 2016, tempered-glass side panels 
were the trendy addition to lots of 
cases around the industry; costs came 
down, and manufacturers moved 
from offering just a single glass panel 
(usually the left, for obvious reasons) 
to having glass panels on both sides. 
PC parts maker Rosewill has upped 
the ante for 2017 with its brand-new 
CULLINAN chassis, which has 
tempered glass on both sides and a 
tempered-glass front panel.
Although it’s not the first case on 
the market to offer a translucent front 
panel, it’s a great addition to Rosewill’s 
lineup and the look is accentuated by 
the triple 120mm LED front-panel 
fans Rosewill ships pre-installed with 
the chassis. There’s a matching LED 
fan bolted to the back panel, and if 
you want you can add up to three 
120mm or 140mm fans beneath the 
top panel (or mount a 360 radiator 
there). You can also replace the front-
panel fans with 140s if you roll that 
large cable management slots that run 
vertically along the front edge of your 
motherboard are covered by an even 
larger plastic shroud that helps keep 
things looking even cleaner.
Rosewill gives the CULLINAN 
removable dust filters, both beneath the 
power supply mount and on the top of 
the case, the latter being a magnetic mesh 
piece that snaps on and comes off easily. 
Functional, builder-friendly features 
aside, the CULLINAN is all about 
creating a great-looking system, and in 
our estimation it delivers. In fact, the 
CULLINAN has replaced the B2 Spirit 
as our favorite among Rosewill’s extensive 
case lineup; take a look for yourself and 
we think you’ll see why. ■

ENERMAX REVOLUTION SFX 650W
above 195 watts, which means the unit 
will be completely silent when your PC is 
idle. ENERMAX also includes a bracket, 
should you want to use this PSU in an 
mATX or ATX chassis.
ENERMAX has recently overhauled the 
modular cabling on its PSUs, moving to 
either individually-sleeved cables or flexible 
flat cables. The REVOLUTION SFX 
650W uses flat black modular cabling, 
and these cables are notably shorter than 
what comes with a full-size PSU. It’s a 
smart design choice, because Mini-ITX 
cases don’t have much free space to stow 
away excess cable. Connector options are 
as follows: one 24-pin main power, a 4+4-
pin CPU power, two 6+2-pin PCIe, six 
SATA, and four Molex.
The REVOLUTION SFX 650W 
distributes most of its power over a single 
+12V rail. ENERMAX designs the +12V 
rail to support up to 54A (648 watts), 
while the +3.3V rail handles up to 18A 
and the +5.5V supports up to 15A. 
Japanese electrolytic capacitors rated for 
up to 105 degrees Celsius are responsible 
for handling the PSU’s power. Internal 
circuity (and by extension, any connected 
W
ith a growing number of enthusiasts 
building small form factor systems, 
we’ve seen a lot of case manufacturers 
release specially designed Mini-ITX 
cases that both optimize airflow and 
support for high performance parts. To 
maximum space, many of these Mini-ITX 
cases require an SFX power supply with 
standard dimensions of 2.5 x 4.92 x 
3.94-inches (HxWxD). Standard ATX 
PSU dimensions, by comparison, are 
generally 5.9 inches tall and 5.5 inches 
long, and many high wattage models are 
quite a bit longer. The REVOLUTION 
SFX 650W is one of the highest wattage 
SFX PSUs on the market, and according to 
ENERMAX, it’s the highest wattage SFX 
PSU with a standard 3.94-inch depth.
Outside of the REVOLUTION SFX 
650W’s small dimensions, the PSU offers 
the connectivity and features you’d expect 
on an enthusiast-level 650 watt power 
supply. The REVOLUTION SFX 650W 
meets the 80 PLUS Gold certification, is 
fully modular, and comes with a PWM 
controlled fan for quiet operation. The 
REVOLUTION SFX 650W’s 80mm 
fan won’t start spinning until load goes 
component) is protected against 
overpower, overvoltage, undervoltage, 
overcurrent, over temperature, and short-
circuit conditions. 
We paired the REVOLUTION SFX 
650W with a system running an Intel 
Core i7-7700K, a GIGABYTE GeForce 
GTX 1080 Xtreme Gaming, and 32GB 
of Corsair Vengeance LED DDR4-
3200. It had no trouble powering the 
high-end hardware and was able to push 
through the demanding combined load 
of Prime95’s In-Place test and Unigine 
Heaven 4.0. During testing, peak power 
reached 420 and a power factor of .986—
an excellent result. In most cases, power 
factor was between .980 and .988.
There are a lot less SFX power supplies 
on the market than standard ATX PSUs, 
so it’s smart for ENERMAX to design 
a SFX PSU that truly meets the needs 
of enthusiasts. Based on our testing, the 
REVOLUTION SFX 650W looks to be 
one of the best options for power users 
planning to use a high-powered graphics 
card in a Mini-ITX rig.  ■

So, apologies for the belabored 
introduction, but there are plenty of reasons 
that Patriot’s recently announced 256GB 
LX Series microSDXC card deserves time in 
the spotlight. Most of the time, we turn to 
Patriot for DDR4 and solid-state drives, but 
the company churns out memory cards like 
the LX Series on a regular basis, too. Patriot 
debuted the 256GB LX Series card at CES; 
power users take note.
Armed with a complement of 3D TLC 
NAND, the new LX Series microSDXC 
card follows the same trend we’ve seen with 
solid-state drives. TLC NAND allows for 
more storage without compromising much 
throughput. As a result, this card can claim 
some fairly impressive reads and writes. 
According to Patriot, with the pedal to the 
metal, the new LX Series card cruises along 
at 90MBps for sequential reads. The card’s 
maximum sequential writes are nearly as as 
fast, maxing out at 80MBps. Bottom line: 
You can fill up the 256GB LX Series with 
massive amounts of media, whether that’s 
hours of 4K video, thousands of  hi-res 
images, or a mix of both. Then, when the 
F
or a while, we forgot about memory 
cards. They were indispensable during the 
era of digital cameras (and they’re still vital for 
prosumers using D-SLRs), supplying enough 
ammo to take thousands of shots without 
needing to reload. Once smartphones and 
cloud storage came along, casual types 
stopped lugging around a separate camera, 
which of course obviated the need for 
capacious memory cards. Niche markets still 
demanded them, but SD, CF, microSD, and 
other varieties of pint-sized removable storage 
needed to find new homes.
Leave it to enthusiasts to revitalize demand 
for big and fast memory cards. Photos are so 
2004. Now, we’re using action cameras and 
zipping through the sky with drones. Digital 
images? That’s rich. Now, 4K video is all the 
rage, so high-performance memory cards 
with hundreds of gigabytes of capacity are 
more important than ever.
But don’t count out smartphones 
(and tablets), either. Plenty of Android 
devices have expandable storage, another 
opportunity for truly superior memory 
cards to give power users a leg up.
time comes to move everything to a PC, 
expect the LX Series card to make short 
work of the transfer.
To test the 256GB LX Series 
microSDXC card, we dropped it into the 
mircoSD slot of a Dell Venue 11 Pro tablet, 
which includes a 1.6GHz Intel Core i5-
4300Y, 8GB of DDR3-1600, and a 256GB 
SanDisk X110 SSD. First, we pitted the 
card against CrystalDiskMark’s sequential 
read and write tests. Next, we transferred 
a 2GB folder of assorted files to and from 
the card, timing the trip each direction. 
Predictably, the LX Series card likes to eat 
big bites of data: Images and videos flew 
back and forth between card and tablet, 
while tiny Office files caused throughput 
(particular writes) to plummet.
SSDs grab all the headlines, but this 
memory card knows how to wield its 
NAND, too. Not everyone needs a memory 
card with a quarter of a terabyte of storage, 
but for those who do, Patriot’s 256GB LX 
Series microSDXC doesn’t disappoint.  ■

State-Of-The-Art
Standards
FreeSync & G-SYNC
to introduce lag when HDR is used with 
videogames. Similar to the variable refresh 
rate techniques, FreeSync 2 and G-SYNC 
HDR allow a GPU to convey HDR 
metadata directly to a compatible display. 
The gaming evolution never stops.
What’s Wrong With Vsync?
For years, gamers have been using 
Vsync to combat the problem of screen 
tearing, and you don’t have to have a 
specific GPU to take advantage of Vsync. 
But some gamers opt to disable Vsync 
because it can cause choppy onscreen 
motion. Basically, Vsync forces to GPU 
to render frames at a fixed cadence to 
create a set of completed frames, and the 
monitor will signal when it’s ready for a 
new frame. Stutter can occur when your 
GPU’s frame rate falls below the Vsync 
cap, which is typically 60fps.
are misaligned on-screen content and 
fragmented scenes. 
AMD FreeSync and NVIDIA’s G-SYNC 
technologies solve screen tearing by 
synchronizing GPU and monitor refresh 
rates on a frame-by-frame basis. Because 
AMD and NVIDIA differ in how they 
implement the respective variable refresh rate 
technologies, both your GPU and monitor 
must be compatible for refresh rates to sync 
up. As such, you must use a compatible 
AMD GPU with a FreeSync-enabled display, 
or a compatible NVIDIA GPU with a 
G-SYNC-enabled display.
Recently, Team Green and Team Red 
raised the bar with new standards that add 
support for HDR (high dynamic range) to 
the respective adaptive-sync technologies. 
Titled FreeSync 2 and G-SYNC HDR, 
these technologies are necessary because 
existing HDR transport methods tend 
I
n the quest to produce the smoothest 
and most realistic gameplay, power users 
typically purchase the most powerful 
graphics card (or cards) their budgets will 
allow. More raw GPU horsepower typically 
translates to better FPS (frames per second) 
rates, and the faster the frame rate, the 
smoother gameplay will appear. A high-
powered GPU can also let you max out 
video settings to enhance effects and further 
immerse yourself in the game. Yet there are 
some graphics issues that even a pricey GPU 
can’t completely resolve by itself.
Screen tearing, for example, occurs 
when a GPU’s frame rate doesn’t match 
up with the monitor’s refresh rate. The 
result is that the display might show parts 
of multiple frames in a single draw, and 
where differences exist between those 
frames, noticeable artifacts will result. 
Classic symptoms of screen tearing 
24 February2017  /  www.computerpoweruser.com

FreeSync’s variable refresh 
rate capability is based on 
Adaptive Sync, which is a VESA 
(Video Electronics Standards 
Association) industry standard 
that was originally designed to 
support dynamic refresh rates 
over the DisplayPort interface. 
By using the existing DisplayPort 
protocol, AMD was able to 
reduce the complexity necessary 
to implement FreeSync into a 
display. NVIDIA’s G-SYNC, 
by comparison, requires a 
chip inside the monitor that 
coordinates the refresh rate of 
the display. FreeSync’s relative 
simplicity reduces cost and 
makes it easier for monitor 
manufacturers to support 
variable refresh rates.
Initially, FreeSync only 
worked over DisplayPort, but in 2016, 
AMD developed an extension of FreeSync 
to allow for variable refresh rates over 
HDMI. We’ve found that monitors 
typically only support FreeSync over either 
DisplayPort or HDMI. And unfortunately, 
not all monitor manufacturers have clear 
specifications about which display interface 
supports FreeSync, meaning you might 
have to dig through your display’s manual 
a bit to discover which port supports 
variable refresh rates.
create FreeSync displays, and in total, there 
were 121 FreeSync compatible monitors. 
AMD expects that most all of the partners 
who built FreeSync monitors will create 
FreeSync 2-compatible options. But don’t 
expect to see the market flood with as 
many FreeSync 2 monitors as you did with 
FreeSync monitors, because AMD will have 
strict standards for the minimum brightness, 
contrast, and color space. To make the cut, a 
monitor must be able to meet these standards 
while also delivering extremely low latency.
Vsync’s effect on input lag is another 
concern, because the GPU might have to 
hold onto a rendered frame for too long. For 
example, the GPU might buffer up to three 
fully rendered frames until the monitor is 
ready to draw a new on-screen frame. The 
lag trade-off can make Vsync unsuitable 
for shooters and other games that require 
precise, quick action. By perfectly matching 
the refresh rate of the GPU and monitor, 
FreeSync and G-SYNC do away with both 
screen tearing and Vsync’s stutter and lag. 
FreeSync
FreeSync’s dynamic refresh rate 
is supported by most Radeon GPUs 
released in 2014 or after, which 
includes the Radeon R9 290 and R7 
260X. Older Radeon GPUs, such as 
the HD 7000 and R9 280, support 
FreeSync for video playback and power-
saving jobs, but these cards don’t have 
a display controller that supports the 
transformative adaptive sync capabilities. 
GPUs based on AMD’s new Polaris and 
upcoming Vega architecture, of course, 
support FreeSync. Best of all, AMD says 
that any FreeSync-compatible Radeon 
GPU will also support FreeSync 2.
As of December 2016, 20 display 
makers had partnered with AMD to 
Vsync fixes one problem (screen tearing) but introduces two others (stutter and lag) in the process.
FreeSync & G-SYNC avoid screen tearing that can occur when Vsync is off.

purchase. Fortunately, many of the 
FreeSync displays released in 2016 offer a 
much wider variable refresh range. If you 
often game at more than 75fps—or below 
40fps—it’d be worth your time and effort 
to find a FreeSync monitor that supports 
the variable refresh rates you play at.
G-SYNC
NVIDIA was the first to develop 
adaptive-sync technology in 2013. 
G-SYNC is supported by GeForce GTX 
650 Ti or greater GPUs, so it works 
even if your NVIDIA GPU is a few 
generations old. Even some of NVIDIA’s 
mobile GPUs support G-SYNC, 
including the GeForce GTX 965M, 
970M, 980M, and 10-Series notebook 
GPUs. With a dedicated GPU, you’ll 
need to connect to a G-SYNC monitor 
via the DisplayPort cable. 
On the monitor front, supported 
panels feature a G-SYNC chip that’s in 
charge of the variable refresh rate. The 
approach helps NVIDIA to have a bit 
more control when using adaptive sync. 
NVIDIA indicates, for example, that 
G-SYNC displays don’t have a minimum 
refresh rate limit and the maximum 
refresh rate matches up with the panel’s 
the monitor’s minimum refresh rate to 
support LFC.
Again, the lack of strictly defined 
parameters requires you to research a 
monitor’s FreeSync capabilities before 
There are some other notable caveats 
with FreeSync technology. To start, 
FreeSync monitors feature both a 
minimum and maximum variable 
refresh range, and the supported range 
varies widely by monitor. The variable 
refresh rate might be as little as 40Hz to 
60Hz, or as wide as 30Hz to 144Hz. The 
maximum variable refresh range typically 
matches the maximum refresh range of 
the monitor, but the minimum could be 
as high as 48Hz. 
When FreeSync was first released, 
the standard was criticized because it 
had no way to handle frame rates that 
dropped below a monitor’s minimum 
variable refresh rate. In such cases, your 
system would revert back to Vsync, if 
you had it turned on, or introduce screen 
tearing, if Vsync was off. AMD’s Crimson 
driver added LFC (low framerate 
compensation), which is an adaptive-sync 
algorithm to adjust the GPU’s output 
and refresh rate for smooth motion when 
below the monitor’s minimum refresh 
rate. There’s a catch, though, because a 
FreeSync monitor must boast a maximum 
refresh rate that’s 2.5 times (or more) 
FreeSync works with many existing Radeon graphics cards, such as the R9 290 pictured here.
AMD introduced Low Framerate Compensation to FreeSync with its Crimson driver.
26 February2017  /  www.computerpoweruser.com

In 2016, the engineers at NVIDIA 
introduced another input latency-
reducing feature called Fast Sync that, 
although not technically part G-SYNC, 
does complement the variable refresh 
rate technology. It’s designed for the 
same group of people that wanted to 
turn off Vsync at high frame rates, yet 
still eliminates screen tearing. Fast Sync 
uses a triple buffer system, but the GPU 
renders the frames as if Vsync is off and 
grabs the most recent frame from the 
buffers. The resulting lag is only a little 
higher than with Vsync off and there’s 
no screen tearing.
To further avoid ghosting and input 
latency, some G-SYNC displays support 
NVIDIA’s ULMB (Ultra Low Motion 
Blur) mode, which strobes the backlight 
of a monitor to eliminate motion blur 
and reduce input latency. ULMB and 
G-SYNC can’t function at the same 
time, though, so you’ll need to choose 
which one to activate. Assuming ULMB 
is supported by the monitor, you can 
use the NVIDIA Control Panel to 
switch between the ULMB or G-SYNC 
display modes for specific games.
As you can see, NVIDIA’s latest 
GPUs and G-SYNC monitors provide 
you with several different ways to 
optimize your gaming experience. A 
quick perusal of the market shows that 
the majority of G-SYNC monitors 
support refresh rates all the way up to 
144Hz, which is ideal for enthusiasts 
with premium graphics cards. There are 
some FreeSync monitors that match up 
with the high-end G-SYNC panels, but 
many of the early FreeSync options lack 
the amenities of G-SYNC monitors.
FreeSync 2 & G-SYNC HDR
HDR is not yet common on PC 
displays—CES 2017 marked the debut 
of HDR monitors—but HDR was 
the “it” feature for HDTVs in 2016. 
HDR improves brightness, contrast, 
and color gamut, all of which help to 
make on-screen visuals more lifelike. 
At CES, we were treated to several 
demos that displayed content both on 
an HDR monitor and a conventional 
maximum refresh rate of the monitor. 
In this situation, G-SYNC would 
automatically revert to a Vsync mode 
to prevent screen tearing, and gamers 
didn’t want Vsync’s additional input 
lag. In 2015, NVIDIA updated 
G-SYNC to let you disable the 
technology at refresh rates above the 
monitor’s maximum, though doing 
so will reintroduce the possibilities of 
screen tearing. 
top refresh rate. The flip side is that 
G-SYNC monitors tend to be a bit more 
expensive than comparable FreeSync 
monitors, and there are fewer G-SYNC 
monitors on the market, due to the added 
complexity of the G-SYNC chip.
When G-SYNC was first released, 
NVIDIA received some complaints 
that gamers couldn’t turn off 
G-SYNC for fast-paced shooters, 
such as CS:GO, that exceeded the 
NVIDIA has supported G-SYNC on graphics cards since the advent of the GeForce GTX 650Ti.
G-SYNC monitors feature a G-SYNC module to coordinate GPU and monitor frame rates.
CPU  /  February2017 27

quantum-dot nanoparticles are able to 
produce a wider range of colors. 
AMD hasn’t officially certified 
any displays for FreeSync 2, but the 
company’s Senior Manager of Global 
Technology Marketing, Antal Tungler, 
tells us “several displays are in the 
certification pipeline now.” Again, there’s 
no definitive timeline on when FreeSync 
2 monitors will be available, but we 
expect some to see some announcements 
this year. One thing we can say for 
certain is that all FreeSync 2 monitors 
will support LFC, and AMD expects the 
monitors to provide twice the perceivable 
brightness and color volume over 
standard RGB panels.
A Game Changer
FreeSync and G-SYNC displays are 
readily available to produce exceptionally 
smooth, fluid gaming visuals, when paired 
with a compatible graphics card. FreeSync 
2 and G-SYNC HDR are the next step 
toward perfect pixels, but it will likely 
be a while before the HDR standards 
are widely supported by monitors and 
games. Even so, it’s nice to see AMD and 
NVIDIA get ahead of the curve with 
HDR, and the backing of Team Red and 
Team Green should help to move the 
needle with monitor manufacturers. ■
it easier to incorporate HDR rendering 
into new games.
There are no concrete details about 
the exact brightness, contrast, and 
color gamut specifications a monitor 
must meet for the new FreeSync 2 and 
G-SYNC HDR standards. But we do 
know that any monitor to meet the 
respective standards must be approved 
and certified by AMD or NVIDIA. 
And because most current monitors 
are based on standard dynamic range 
specifications, it appears that monitor 
manufacturers will need to make some 
significant improvements to meet the 
respective HDR standards. 
The ASUS ROG Swift PG27UQ is 
one of the first G-SYNC HDR displays, 
and it includes some features that 
most current premium displays can’t 
match. For example, ASUS indicates 
that the PG27UQ supports a 1,000cd/
m2. Conventional PC monitors are 
designed to deliver between 200 and 
300 cd/m2. ASUS achieves this through 
the use of quantum-dot technology 
and a backlight that can be selectively 
controlled over 384 zones. According 
to ASUS, breaking down the backlight 
to individual zones allows the HDR 
transmission to selectively dim zones 
and maximize contrast, while the 
monitor. Colors on the standard 
panel were flat and washed out in 
comparison to the HDR displays, 
where we could clearly see more 
vibrant hues and deeper contrast.
HDR metadata and tone mapping, 
which allows for the expanded color 
saturation and contrast, forces the 
monitor to deal with a lot more data 
than what it sees with standard dynamic 
range content. Existing HDR formats 
(HDR 10 and Dolby Vision) work fine 
with Ultra Blu-ray movies and HDTVs, 
for example, because input lag isn’t a 
concern. NVIDIA estimates that current 
HDR TVs produce at least 21 to 
45ms of latency, while AMD indicates 
input lag could be as high as 100ms. 
Such input lag would kill the HDR 
experience for gamers. Both FreeSync 
2 and G-SYNC HDR are designed to 
minimize input lag while supporting the 
tear-free adaptive-sync experience.
With FreeSync 2, AMD reworks 
the transport system for HDR. AMD 
indicates that FreeSync 2 takes the tone-
mapping duties away from the display 
and moves it over to the GPU. The 
game engine, in turn, maps content for 
targeted brightness, contrast, and color 
values. AMD is providing a FreeSync 2 
extension to game developers to make 
FreeSync 2 puts the tone-mapping duties onto your GPU, rather than the monitor, to reduce input lag.

Minerva
on the project, during which he worked with wood, copper, old 
gauges, antique parts, and gears, along with potentiometers to 
control the fans and old switches to control the LED lighting.
“I built this system because I love building, creating, and 
modding PCs,” Frost says. “I don’t like to adhere to any one 
doctrine. By that, I mean that I don’t follow what is traditionally 
done. For example, the traditional square case. For my girlfriend 
and me, modding PCs is just another form of art, and it is all 
about getting that artistic vision onto a canvas. In this case, it was 
a steampunk canvas. In addition, I just wanted to see if I could 
actually do everything my mind’s eye was seeing and for me the 
more difficult it is to accomplish, the more driven and determined 
I am to make it all work. Yes, the PC does fill a particular purpose; 
it is my daily PC, but it has also become a great conversation piece 
and, for us, artistically pleasing to look at.”
It’s safe to say they’re not alone; everyone who has seen this 
piece has been blown away by it.
“There are a lot of parts on this machine that are truly 
unique—one of a kind,” Frost says. “We avidly shop antique 
stores for unique pieces to collect so we can incorporate a lot of 
these rare finds into our projects. Finding old or rare items that 
are left behind in old, abandoned farms or houses has become a 
beneficial hobby of sorts.”
The “Steam” In “Steampunk”
As you can tell just by looking, this rig took a lot of hard 
work to complete. Frost rewired his power supply so that 
T
his month, as we have at CPU for many years now, we had 
to choose an overall winning mod from among the winners 
of all of the mod contests we’ve judged at LANFest LAN 
party events around the country in 2016. The competition was 
tough, and our top three contestants this time around wound up 
including one repeat Mad Reader Mod winner (the incomparable 
Brian “Boddaker” Carter) and two modders who’ve never yet 
won a spot in the feature.
Our final tallies showed the decision to be unanimous: 
This year’s winner was Christian “hashtag pound sign” Frost’s 
steampunk-themed mod, Minerva. Frost got a lot of help on 
this project from his girlfriend, Pixie Williams, and the two 
proudly showed off their work in September at CPULAN 2016 
in Lincoln, Neb., where it was a similarly unanimous winner.
Goddess
Frost provides the briefest of explanations as to his mod’s 
name, saying only that he and Williams “felt that the name 
captured the whole artistic side of the machine.” Fair enough, but 
in Roman mythology, Minerva was the goddess of wisdom and 
arts, among other things. This also fits the pair’s M.O.
“It’s really hard to say exactly where the inspiration comes 
from,” Frost says. “In some cases it will be a visual incentive, 
sometimes a thought or feeling. My girlfriend and I have always 
been very artistic, so the inspiration mostly comes from within.”
Unlike Minerva the goddess, Minerva the mod was not born 
fully grown. Frost says he spent roughly three weeks working 
36 February2017  /  www.computerpoweruser.com

he could have both AC and DC voltage for the steampunk 
lights and still only have one wire that plugs into the wall. 
He scavenged many of the gears and other small mechanical 
parts from broken watches, some of which had then been 
incorporated into jewelry and other items. 
Frost delidded his Core i7-3770K and left the integrated 
heat spreader off so that he could implement a more direct 
cooling solution; doing this required him in turn to mod 
the CPU socket to adjust for the proper pressure so that the 
CPU would work properly. He also disabled his graphics 
card’s overcurrent protection so that he could push GPU 
overclocks a bit.
In addition to his 3770K, Minerva’s components include 
a GIGABYTE motherboard, 32GB of PNY DDR3 memory, 
a GeForce GTX TITAN X graphics card, a 900-watt Antec 
power supply, a pair of 1TB SSDs in RAID configuration to 
run Windows 10, a pair of 256GB SSDs in RAID running 
Windows 7, and a 1TB hard drive for storage. The system’s 
cooling system mostly consists of XSPC waterblocks and 
custom radiators.
Next Up In The Pantheon
Frost tells us that he’s working on his next build already, 
but is characteristically mum on the details. “I hesitate to say 
what it is at the moment, because we are planning on bringing 
it to a LANFest event soon,” he says.
Fair enough, Mr. Frost. ■

Laptop Leadership 
MSI’s GT83VR TITAN SLI Sets The Bar For Portable Power
handle game designs, and run any other 
relevant programs.
“This laptop could function as a mobile 
workstation or desktop replacement 
when hooked up to multiple external 4K 
monitors,” he adds.
MSI’s goal of making an insanely 
strong laptop for enthusiasts, gamers, and 
professionals is realized in a number of 
features included in the GT83VR TITAN 
SLI. Its 18.4-inch screen is a 94% NTSC 
panel, which helps accurately reproduce 
colors on screen, a vital capability for visual 
artists, graphic designers, and others. The 
laptop also includes a Thunderbolt 3 port, 
which is quickly becoming the preferred 
interface among creative professionals. 
MSI also deployed its proprietary True 
Color Technology in the GT83VR TITAN 
U
tter the words “desktop replacement 
notebook” to any power user who’s 
been around the block once or twice, 
and he’ll immediately know what you’re 
talking about. These mighty mobiles focus 
more on might and less on mobile, as 
they’re built to have all the horsepower 
of a desktop system while maintaining 
portability (technically). You wouldn’t 
take a desktop replacement notebook to 
Starbucks to work on your Tumblr page, 
but they’ll fit right in at a LAN party.   
Because mobile components ad-
vance almost in lockstep with their 
desktop counterparts, DTR notebook 
manufacturers must constantly figure out 
new ways to pack the latest and greatest 
hardware into roughly the same physical 
shell. After all, the mammoth coolers 
bolted onto today’s graphics cards and 
CPUs don’t exactly fit inside a laptop. It’s 
a challenge that has existed for as long as 
DTRs have been around.
Recently, MSI has led the DTR charge, 
releasing a slew of new units you could 
easily mistake for high-end desktop PCs 
based only on their specs. Among this 
squadron of high-flying laptops is the 
GT83VR TITAN SLI, which is armed with 
an array of advanced weaponry. In order 
for this imposing DTR to take flight, MSI 
called in its top engineers and launched a 
skunkworks project of epic proportions.
Lofty Ambitions
From the beginning, MSI set out to 
create a laptop that would excel in a 
variety of roles, not just gaming. Lenny 
Tang, MSI associate marketing manager, 
explains that the “VR” in “GT83VR 
TITAN SLI” means the DTR is not only 
capable of playing virtual reality games 
but designing them, as well. According to 
Tang, MSI wanted to give VR developers 
a system that could render 3D models, 
SLI, further cementing the DTR as a true 
workhorse for virtually anyone who uses it.
Core Components
MSI has assembled a murderers’ row 
of components for the GT83VR TITAN 
SLI. Although mobile variants are used 
in the case of the CPU and GPUs, these 
chips are within striking distance of their 
corresponding desktop components. For 
example, in the case of the GT83VR 
TITAN SLI’s twin GTX 1080 GPUs, 
Tang notes, “the [performance] difference 
between true desktop and mobile is less 
than 5%.”
The brains of the operation is Intel’s 
brand-new Core i7-7920HQ, which is 
essentially the company’s most powerful 
mobile processor. Part of the Kaby Lake 
Boasting a new 7th Generation Intel Core i7 CPU and two—count ’em, two—NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 
GPUs in SLI, it should be obvious to enthusiasts that MSI’s GT83VR TITAN SLI will crush any benchmark, 
game, or other high-intensity task you put in front of it.
CPU  /  February2017 39

always directly translate to real-world, in-
game performance, but like the 7920HQ, 
the two GTX 1080s in the GT83VR 
TITAN SLI should be able to take on any 
game, VR or otherwise. MSI also took 
steps to ensure the GPUs were well fed. 
As it turns out, supplying adequate power 
to the GTX 1080 tandem was MSI’s 
highest hurdle to clear.
“The biggest design challenge was 
powering the two GPUs, which resulted 
in two power bricks, powering one GPU 
each,” Tang says.
MSI filled the GT83VR TITAN SLI 
with other components befitting its 
status as the company’s flagship laptop. 
It’s stuffed with 64GB of DDR4-
2400 system memory, which should 
be enough to make any regular user of 
Adobe Creative Cloud or Sony VEGAS 
salivate. This DTR’s storage subsystem 
is similarly well-appointed. Recognizing 
the dominance of PCIe solid-state 
drives, MSI has doubled down with a 
pair of 512GB PCIe SSDs and yoked 
them together with its Super RAID 4 
technology for even greater throughput. 
For bulk storage, the laptop contains a 
1TB 7,200rpm HDD.
For networking, MSI turned to Killer 
Networking. Specifically, the GT83VR 
TITAN SLI’s Ethernet controller is the 
crew, the Core i7-7920HQ is a quad-
core chip with Hyper-Threading, so it can 
handle up to eight instructions at once. 
The processor’s base operating frequency 
is 3.1GHz, which trails Intel’s leading 
Kaby Lake desktop CPU, the Core i7-
7700K, by 1.1GHz. One key reason 
behind the difference in base operating 
frequency is 7920HQ’s lean TDP—only 
45W. By comparison, the 7700K can 
draw up to 91W. Regardless, expect the 
7920HQ and its multithreaded prowess 
to yield excellent performance.
Arguably the GT83VR TITAN SLI’s 
centerpiece, its two GeForce GTX 1080 
GPUs should strike fear into the hearts 
of pixels everywhere. Based on NVIDIA’s 
Pascal architecture, the GTX 1080s 
found in the GT83VR TITAN SLI are 
almost indistinguishable from the GTX 
1080 desktop card. Both feature an 
8GB GDDR5X frame buffer that uses 
a 256-bit memory bus. The memory 
hums along at 10Gbps, which adds up 
to 320GBps of memory bandwidth. 
NVIDIA dials back the base frequency 
of the mobile GTX 1080, but only 
slightly. Instead of the 1,607MHz base 
clock of the desktop GTX 1080, the 
mobile GTX 1080’s base frequency is set 
to 1,556MHz, only a 3.2% difference. 
Granted, similar speeds and feeds don’t 
Most laptops aren’t known for their keyboards, but the MSI GT83VR TITAN SLI isn’t most laptops. For the system’s keyboard, MSI turned to SteelSeries to come 
up with something grand, and the Danish manufacturer didn’t disappoint. The GT83VR TITAN SLI features Cherry MX Speed Silver mechanical keyswitches, so 
gaming on the laptop should feel virtually identical to using a mechanical keyboard with a desktop PC.

diverting heat effectively and efficiently, 
especially on a mobile chassis.”
First, MSI beefed up the Cooler 
Boost TITAN increasing the number 
of heatpipes to 15. The company also 
redesigned the cooler’s fin structure 
in order to increase its surface area and 
maximize airflow. The cooling fans also 
received an overhaul. MSI made the fan 
blades wider and thinner, which made 
room to increase the number of blades. 
Between the CPU and GPU fans, 52 
blades work to cool the chips. According 
to Tang, the end result is a 30% increase 
in airflow.
Mechanical In A Mobile
From an input device standpoint, 
one clear advantage desktop PCs have 
traditionally enjoyed over laptops is the 
option to use a keyboard with mechanical 
keyswitches. From gaming to everyday 
typing, mechanical keyboards tend to be 
far superior to the low-quality keyboards 
typically found in laptops. Again, MSI 
was determined to build a laptop to rival 
any desktop, so addressing one of the least 
Killer E2500, which aims to crush latency 
with its Lag and Latency Reduction 
Technology. The 802.11ac adapter is 
another Killer chip, the Killer N1535.
Compared to previous generations, Tang 
says the Killer E2500 “has better program 
prioritization over previous versions and 
effectively uses the Ethernet controller to 
optimize bandwidth. Its newest Advanced 
Stream Detect 2.0 technology will prioritize 
games and real-time communication.”
Cool Your Jets
In addition to supplying the GT83VR 
TITAN SLI with enough juice for its 
components, MSI had to devise a cooler 
that could keep the laptop’s hottest (as 
in, literally) components in check. The 
solution was the Cooler Boost TITAN. 
Although it was based on the cooler 
inside MSI’s last-gen GT laptops, Tang 
says the new cooler went through several 
revisions before being completed.
“The biggest gripe we heard from users 
was that the GT series was overheating 
and throttling,” he says. “Our engineers 
know that there are only so many ways of 
frequently addressed aspects on laptops 
was a top priority.
With an assist from the gaming 
peripheral experts at SteelSeries, MSI 
equipped the GT83VR TITAN SLI with 
Cherry MX Speed Silver keyswitches. A 
linear switch developed with gaming in 
mind, the MX Speed Silvers have a very 
short actuation distance, a mere 1.2mm. 
The total travel distance of 3.4mm is 
similarly short. The switches only require 
45cN of force to actuate, the same as 
Cherry’s MX Reds.
“When designing the keyboard, our 
engineers studied the optimal wrist angle 
and length where it would cause the least 
fatigue over time,” Tang says. “When 
a standard wrist rest is used with the 
GT83VR, the keyboard on the laptop is 
actually very comfortable to type on.”
Big Picture
A laptop can have all the latest hardware 
and still fall short if it has an inferior 
display. Gamers need a clear picture of 
the action, but a high-quality screen is 
even more important for professionals 
whose jobs depend on things like on-point 
color reproduction. To serve both of these 
audiences, MSI gave the GT83VR TITAN 
SLI an IPS panel and complemented it 
with homegrown software.
The benefits are clear. Compared to 
TN panels, the GT83VR TITAN SLI’s 
panel offers 40% better contrast and 20% 
increased brightness. As mentioned, the 
panel boasts a 94% NTSC color gamut.
By using MSI True Color Technology, 
users can configure the GT83VR TITAN 
SLI’s display precisely to what they need. For 
example, Gamer mode boosts brightness, 
while Movie mode tweaks contrast for a 
proper cinematic experience. For professionals, 
True Color Technology can set the display to 
100% of the sRGB color gamut.
Super-Size Me
At 13.13 pounds, MSI’s GT83VR 
TITAN SLI is unapologetically large. 
Considering all of its cutting-edge hardware, 
though, it’s also unapologetically awesome. If 
you want to take as much computing muscle 
with you as possible, this is how you do it. ■
Using a pair of NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 GPUs in a laptop is bound to present thermal challenges, so MSI’s 
engineers went to work devising a cooler capable of dealing with all the heat. The end result is the Cooler 
Boost TITAN, which has a whopping 15 heatpipes to help wick away heat from the laptop’s CPU and GPUs.

AORUS RISING
This Is What An Enthusiast Motherboard Looks Like
A Growing Brand
AORUS, as a premium gaming brand, 
has been around for a few years. We know 
it as home to GIGABYTE’s enthusiast-
grade laptops, mice, and keyboards, but 
most recently it has been expanded to 
include a cross-section of graphics cards 
and motherboards that are designed to 
appeal to users looking for a little extra 
from their components in terms of 
features, aesthetics, and performance. 
GIGABYTE’s Ultra Durable, G1 
Gaming, and SOC Force product lines 
aren’t going anywhere, just skootching 
over to make room for GIGABYTE’s fist-
pumping raptor. If you listen real close, 
L
ast month we introduced you to 
the new Intel 200 Series chipset, 
formerly codenamed Union Point, 
and our first look at a motherboard 
outfitted with the Z270 variant –built 
for enthusiast class components– came 
in the form of the AORUS GA-Z270X-
Gaming 5. We liked what we saw from 
that board, but we knew there was 
another motherboard waiting in the 
wings that would really knock our socks 
off. If you think of Intel’s Z270 PCH 
as a blank canvas, then the topic of this 
month’s Whitepaper is what you get when 
GIGABYTE sets out to paint its Sistine 
Chapel. 
you can almost hear that logo screeching a 
very high-pitched “Let’s do this!”
Redefining The Flagship
When it comes to single-digit 
numbers, nothing beats a 9, which is why 
the highest-end AORUS motherboard 
in the lineup gets that number for a 
suffix. The AORUS GA-Z270X-Gaming 
9 ($499.99) is packed with so many 
enthusiast features that they’re listed on 
the box in font sizes typically reserved 
for legal disclaimers. But seriously, 
this motherboard offers superior 
overclocking, insanely fast storage, ear-
pleasing customizable premium audio, 
If you’re looking for the perfect platform for your Kaby Lake or Skylake processor, look no further.

with Isense technology. This portion 
of the motherboard is responsible for 
precise current sensing and thermal load 
regulation and distribution. According 
to GIGABYTE, “Clean efficient power 
delivery is important in any high-end 
system. Voltage is dynamic, spikes 
or drops can cause serious problems at 
worst or puzzling and/or annoying issues 
at best.” But beyond preventing power 
delivery issues, such a hearty VRM helps 
contribute to a longer motherboard 
lifespan, consistent reliability, more stable 
support for multiple GPUs in a variety 
of configurations, a crazy amount of 
high-speed I/O devices, and a top-rate 
LED lighting system that lets you decide 
whether to keep things low-key or go 
full-on Pink Floyd Laser Light Show. In 
GIGABYTE’s own words, “we set out 
to create a premium board that gave 
our customers the ability to adapt and 
customize every aspect of its operation. 
From RGB Fusion software, to Smart Fan 
5, headers galore, and a robust I/O, we 
feel that anyone looking to build a system 
that is uniquely their own will want 
to give the AORUS Gaming 9 serious 
consideration.” We couldn’t agree more. 
Advanced Tech Comes Standard
This motherboard is built to support 
6th and 7th Generation LGA 1151 Intel 
Core Processors, better known as Skylake 
and Kaby Lake. When you opt for an 
enthusiast motherboard, the complexity 
and capabilities of the VRM usually get 
a significant upgrade, and the AORUS 
GA-Z270X-Gaming 9 is no exception. 
The VRM hugging the top and left 
side of this motherboard’s CPU socket 
consists of an incredibly deep 22-phase 
power delivery system, comprising 4th 
generation IR digital power controllers 
and 3rd generation PowIRstage ICs, 
overclocking results, and cooler running 
temperatures. 
Cool Under The Collar
When your processor is under load, 
the VRM will heat up, which is why 
GIGABYTE enlisted the expertise of 
one of the world’s foremost experts in 
liquid cooling, EKWB, to help design 
a solution that can dissipate that heat 
in the most efficient way possible. The 
result is the G-Frost Hybrid waterblock, 
which is built on top of a C-shaped block 
of aluminum straddling the processor 
socket. If you choose to forego liquid 
cooling, the low-density lightweight 
heatsink base with a copper core will 
adequately keep your VRM well within 
safe operating temperatures. But that 
copper core is actually a precision-
milled liquid channel topped with a 
smoked black translucent acrylic cover 
and sealed with a custom-fitted O-ring. 
The G-Frost Hybrid features a pair of 
G1/4-inch threaded fittings, making it 
easy to incorporate the unique heatsink/
waterblock into your custom loop. If 
you do opt to go that route, you’ll get 
significantly better cooling performance 
and in turn decrease the chances that even 
a stout overclock will result in scenarios 
where thermal throttling occurs. Keeping 
this portion of your board cool can also 
ensure your processor lives a long full 
LED lighting on the AORUS Gaming 9 is only as bright and colorful as you want it to be.
Yes, this motherboard comes with a waterblock. Yes, the water block helps lower your system temps 
even if you opt to go the air-cooling route.

DRAM, Unlimited
There are four memory slots to the 
right side of the CPU socket and 
these support dual-channel Non-ECC 
Unbuffered DDR4 memory, with 
XMP-profile-based overclocks as high as 
DDR4-4133, and beyond. Each DIMM 
slot can handle a 16GB module, for a 
total of up to 64GB of system memory. 
GIGABYTE has also validated more than 
1,000 kits that span almost the entirety of 
DDR4 vendors, ensuring your memory 
life. GIGABYTE tells us that this is just 
one more area where the design of the 
AORUS Gaming 9 was dictated by a 
desire to ensure users have the flexibility 
to build their systems without limits. 
Traditionally, regardless of whether you 
choose air cooling or liquid cooling, you 
need to plug fans, and possibly a pump 
or two, into the appropriate headers on 
the motherboard. As we all know, not 
every cooling device works well with 
PWM (pulse width modulation) control, 
and pumps perform best within a rather 
strict set of minimum and maximum 
rpm settings. On the AORUS Gaming 
9, however, you can plug your CPU 
fan(s), case fans, pump(s), or radiator 
fans into a series of hybrid fan headers, 
which let the motherboard automatically 
enable the appropriate running mode, 
either PWM or voltage. Each hybrid fan 
header on this motherboard supports 
up to 2 amps with built-in overcurrent 
protection, which is particularly useful for 
enthusiast-grade high-current fans. But 
the fan headers don’t presume to know 
everything; if you have other ideas about 
how best to run your cooling subsystem 
(perhaps you prefer to create custom fan 
curves for each component?), you can do 
that using GIGABYTE’s intuitive Smart 
Fan 5 software. All told, there are seven 
internal temperature sensors, two external 
temperature sensors, and eight fan/water 
pump connectors, all with GIGABYTE’s 
Hybrid Fan technology baked in. 
has the best chance of working optimally 
out of the box. 
Graphics Galore
They didn’t put “Gaming” in this 
motherboard’s name for nothing. This 
is the only AORUS board available that 
supports up to 4-way SLI and CrossFire, 
thanks to a 32 lane boost that comes 
courtesy of PLX Technology’s PEX8747 
chip, a PCIe 3.0 switching device that 
provides users with the ultimate flexibility 
in setting up their system. If you’re 
running 2-way SLI or CrossFire, the first 
and third PCIe slots will take the 16 lanes 
from the processor and double it so that 
both cards run on 16 lanes each. 3-way 
multi-GPU setups let one card run at 
x16 and the remaining two at x8 and 
4-way multi-GPU setups will let all 
four cards run at x8 speeds. The chip is 
specifically optimized for high-resolution 
graphics applications and supports 
packet cut-through, with a maximum 
latency of 100ns, to all but eliminate the 
input lag that can result from running a 
multi-GPU rig. 
Now, there are those of you who will 
point out that even a pair of the fastest 
Some people say they can tell everything they need to know about a motherboard by the rear I/O. On 
the AORUS Gaming 9, the I/O is just the tip of the iceberg.

the top-right corner of the board that, 
during the boot process, light up as the 
component (CPU, memory, GPU, and 
storage drive) is checked. When the 
device passes the check, the light goes 
out. If there is a problem, however, 
the culprit’s LED remains lit, giving 
you a quick place to check first, so you 
can get back up and running quickly. 
Additionally, there’s a 4-digit POST code 
display that provides even more clues to 
help you troubleshoot. Once the OS has 
booted, you can configure it to display 
system voltages or temperatures. 
Super Speedy Storage
As we wait for Intel’s Optane 
Technology to deliver products we can 
actually buy, there’s are still tons of ways 
to supercharge the storage devices on the 
AORUS Gaming 9 motherboard. There 
are two native U.2 (Gen 3 x4) connectors 
onboard, and you can use an M.2 to 
U.2 converter to plug in a third NVMe 
device, and run all three 32Gbps devices 
in RAID 0 for insanely fast 3,525MBps 
sequential read and 2,841MBps 
sequential write speeds. There’s also a 
graphics cards available today running on 
PCIe 3.0 slots hamstrung at x8 speeds 
won’t be perceptibly slower than those two 
graphics cards running on slots with access 
to 16 lanes each. But GIGABYTE isn’t 
thinking about the graphics cards you’ll 
plug in today, they’ve got their sights on 
the card you’ll plug in next year, or the 
year after that. “Future proofing is relative, 
but yes, the PLX chip at 16/16 is the 
closest to ‘future proof’ as you can get!” 
We’re also happy to report that a 
system built with the AORUS Gaming 
9 can detect the currently populated 
PEG slot(s), so you’re not stuck using the 
topmost slot if something goes wrong or 
if you just want to move the card to an 
expansion slot further down the board. 
The Ultimate DIY Troubleshooter
If you’re reading the pages of CPU, 
chances are good that you’re the kind of 
person who likes to build your own PC, 
and that DIY mentality almost always 
extends to fixing any problems that 
crop up. To help you in those inevitable 
endeavors, the AORUS Gaming 9 
features a series of debug LEDs on 
Thunderbolt 3 controller onboard that 
you can tap into via the USB Type-C port 
for up to 40Gbps bandwidth, support for 
daisy-chaining up to six devices, and a 4K 
resolution display at 60fps. 
Tough Enough For Anything
All the amazing technology in the 
world isn’t worth bupkis if your system 
can’t even survive a trip to a LAN party. 
That’s why the AORUS Gaming 9 
features a series of steel-reinforced PCIe 
Armor slots and Ultra Durable Memory 
Armor slots. These keep the board from 
flexing during install, and heavy graphics 
cards from coming loose or shearing-off 
during transport. The motherboard’s 
many resistors also feature an Anti-
Sulfur protective coating, which keeps 
the Nickel layer pristine and highly 
conductive for the life of the board. Add 
this to the Durable Black solid capacitors, 
Nichicon fine gold and WIMA audio 
capacitors, 2x copper core PCB, the 
gold-plated CPU socket pins, and you 
know the AORUS Gaming 9 can handle 
whatever you put it through without 
missing a beat.
A Sound Choice
We’ve written at length about 
GIGABYTE’s upgradable OP-AMPs, but 
the AORUS takes it a step further, letting 
you swap out and upgrade three different 
chips, one each for the left and right 
channels that correspond to the rear I/O, 
and a third that corresponds to the front 
audio jack. Creative Sound Blaster ZxRi 
relies on a quad-core audio processor and 
a 127dB Burr-Brown DAC to deliver 
discreet-quality sound, in movies, games, 
and a variety of steaming video options. 
The Complete Package
The AORUS Gaming 9 represents 
a winning combination of the latest 
technologies, fastest protocols, and 
limitless potential that make building 
you own PC such a fun and rewarding 
experience. This is one of the rare 
motherboards that truly won’t hold you 
back. ■
Yep, the kitchen sink’s in there too. Probably.

Adam “DOHCDragon” Owen’s work has appeared in CPU’s “Mad Reader Mod” feature on three occasions, all of them in 
conjunction with our coverage of the QuakeCon mod contest. In the October 2013 issue, we enjoyed his NES Coffee Table 
Computer, we loved his 3D Printed Tiger Tank Computer in the September 2014 issue, and the September 2015 issue featured 
his Peace, Love and Rockets mod.
Modder Q&A: Adam Owen
DOHCDragon On QuakeCon, 
Builds & More
allows you to design and test things in a 3D 
environment and then print them to make 
them a reality. I don’t think it is necessary to 
use 3D printing in case mods, in fact I have 
seen some amazing computers made without 
it. But it is a tool I will use from now on, and 
I believe the work I have done shows some of 
the things it brings to the table.
Q
: The NES Coffee Table Computer 
was awesome, just from an aesthetic 
standpoint, but the fact that you could 
constructed of 3D-printed parts (except 
for the PC components, of course), and 
Peace, Love and Rockets had quite a bit 
of 3D-printed parts, as well. What would 
you say is the best thing about 3D printing 
from a modder’s perspective?
AO
: 3D printing is still not easy. 
When I built the tiger tank, I was 
overwhelmed and forced myself to learn the 
art of 3D printing. That being said, once 
you have it down, it is a valuable tool. It 
Q
: You told us a couple years ago that 
your goal was to build a new system 
each year for QuakeCon. Have you 
managed to keep up with that pace?
AO
: I have, the only exception was this 
last year. I was in the 24 Hours of 
Le Mods event with a fellow modder and 
friend, Mike “MikeKnight” Long. I did help a 
friend of mine (Rob “Whiskers” Wilson) build 
a mod, though. It’s based on Commander 
Keen’s ship, Bean-with-Bacon Megarocket.
Q
: How many QuakeCons have you 
been to now, and how did you get 
started attending?
AO
: I have been to every QuakeCon 
starting in 2006. A friend and fellow 
modder, Mike “whiterice” Walt talked me into 
going, and I have been addicted ever since.
Q
: Two of your three QuakeCon mods 
that we’ve covered won the contest’s 
Scratch Build category; do you favor 
scratch builds over case mods in general, 
or did it just work out that way, and why?
AO
: It definitely just worked out that 
way. I have always preferred case 
mods, but I wanted to try my hand at scratch 
builds, which is why I created the NES 
controller. The idea of the tank followed and 
the rest, as they say, is history.
Q
: Speaking of the 3D Printed Tiger 
Tank Computer, that was entirely 
Owen and his favorite mod project to date, The Behemoth.
CPU  /  February2017 47

actually play Nintendo with it was 
just amazing. Likewise, the Tiger Tank 
Computer was drivable and had a working 
camera built into its turret. Do you always 
go the extra mile like that with your mods, 
and where did you learn to do all that stuff?
AO
: One of my personal rules of 
modding is functionality. I want 
it to look cool, but I also want it to have a 
purpose. I think that flair is required. As for 
where I learned to do those things, I have 
always liked knowing how things work. 
When I was young I would take my toys 
apart to see how they worked . . . sometimes 
they even still worked when I put them back 
together. In the end, all of it is trial and error. 
Luckily that’s one of the things I enjoy.
Q
: How long have you been modding 
now, and how many mods have you 
completed in that time?
AO
: I have been building computers 
and gaming computers for over 
20 years. I have built countless systems 
for friends and family members that have 
a little flair added to them. I honestly 
couldn’t give you a number.
Here’s a year-by-year retrospective of Owen’s QuakeCon builds from 2006 to 2014, with only one repeat: The Behemoth.
Owen and Mike “MikeKnight” Long competed in the Modders-Inc GeForce Garage “24hr of Le 
Mods” event at QuakeCon 2016.
48 February2017  /  www.computerpoweruser.com

Q
: What’s your least favorite part of 
every mod project, and why?
AO
: The finishing touches. I always 
feel like there is more to do 
and I have to cut myself off and just 
say it’s done. Most of the time it’s while 
the paint is drying and I’m in the hotel 
about to take the computer to the BYOC 
at QuakeCon.
Q
: It’s time for Five Quick Questions!
1) Dremel or air brush?
Dremel!
2) AMD or NVIDIA?
NVIDIA!
3) Egg McMuffin or breakfast burrito?
Egg McMuffin.
4) Cowboys or Texans?
Texans.
5) Peace or rockets?
Love! ■
Q
: What do you think is the single 
most important tool in a modder’s 
toolkit, and why?
AO
: A drill. I can’t think of a single mod 
I didn’t need to drill out rivets or add 
a hole to a computer that wasn’t there. This 
was the toughest question you asked. So many 
tools used for every mod I have ever done!
Q
: Why did you start modding, and 
what was your first project?
AO
: I had converted part of my 
parents’ house into a LAN center 
when I was in my teens. My dad had brought 
home a custom computer desk that he had 
gotten from work in 1996. I wanted to use 
the two computers I had on it. I had to 
custom-design a case that would allow both 
computers to fit and not be in the way on 
the desk. I have been hooked ever since.
Q
: Of all the mods you built, which is 
your favorite, and why?
AO
: For QuakeCon 2009 I made 
a computer I called “The 
Behemoth.” It was an old server case my 
brother-in-law had found in a barn. It was 
set up for an AT motherboard and a bunch 
of 5.25-inch hard drives. I was able to gut 
the computer and fit a phase-change cooler 
inside the case. I gave the case an automotive 
paint job and used a plasma cutter to 
add a window to the side. I then added a 
watercooling system to it for the video cards. 
Don’t get me wrong, I am proud of the 
mods I have made in the more recent years, 
but “The Behemoth” is my favorite this far.

Classy Chassis
For enthusiasts, a case is not just a container for our PC parts.
A case’s interior design can make or break your ability to run high-performance parts and install custom 
cooling loops. Form factor, airflow, radiator support, and GPU compatibility are just some of things to 
consider. The chassis is also most power users’ primary media for artistic expression. You want your PC 
to be a showcase, and the perfect case is one that’s aesthetically pleasing, matches your build’s color 
scheme, and provides a bit of a “wow” factor. 
Don’t Temper Your Expectations
Tempered glass side-panel windows are currently the hottest trend in cases. Acrylic windows are still 
common, but case manufacturers are increasingly moving toward glass panels that provide exceptional 
visibility and are less likely to scratch than their acrylic counterparts. Tempered glass window panels 
aren’t exactly new, but in the past, such cases often came with prohibitively high price tags. A variety 
of recently released tempered glass cases are available for less than $200.
Light It Up
With all of the LED innovation happening to the parts inside your case, it was only a matter of time 
before big LEDs made their way to case exteriors. There are a lot of interesting takes on LED case 
lighting. Some of the models in our buyer’s guide feature LED light strips that serve primarily as accent 
illumination, while others build LEDs into the base of the case for ground effects. RGB LEDs, of course, 
are the ultimate in customization. Some models can even sync up with colors and effects running on 
the other components in your system.
In this month’s buyer’s guide, we examine the distinguishing features for more than a dozen cases from 
leading manufacturers. There are a variety of small form factor units, as well mid-towers and huge 
chassis that support most any build you can imagine. You’ll find a full list of specifications in the chart 
at the end of the guide.

also something that older DX11-based 
graphics cards from AMD and NVIDIA 
supported at Win10’s launch. 
DX11 is good at many things, but CPU 
utilization under this API was always seen 
as unnecessarily high. One way DX12 
solves this problem is through the use of 
draw call bundles, officially introduced in 
Xbox One as a part of its modified DirectX 
11.x API. These allow the rendering 
hardware to bundle and cache a series of 
operations likely to be reused. When that 
series is called for again, it executes with 
little to no overhead. Developers can also 
employ descriptor heaps and tables to 
store frequently-used resources to further 
spread the workload across the CPU and 
GPU more efficiently. Command lists, 
like draw call bundles, are yet another 
feature designed to decrease the number of 
repetitive tasks that the CPU performs. In 
short, DX12 is born to multithread. 
is the data available to us at the time. As 
such, it is our goal with this article to 
document the impact of DX12, if any, to 
help you make a more informed decision 
when it comes time to upgrade. 
Promises, Promises
Before we dig into the numbers, let’s 
recap some of the reasons DX12 seems 
to be getting off to such a healthy start. 
From a consumer standpoint, the new 
API is compelling because it was built 
to be significantly more power-efficient, 
resulting in better performance for 
gamers running even mainstream or 
entry-level components. Features such 
as descriptor tables and concise pipeline 
state objects, for instance, enable Win10 
to better pair up the graphics hardware 
with the appropriate DirectX abstraction 
layer. This lower-level abstraction 
is a key component of DX12, but it’s 
B
ack in June 2015, we took an in-depth 
look at Microsoft’s DirectX 12, the 
latest gaming-focused API that’s exclusive 
to Windows 10. Because that OS went 
on sale a month after that article’s 
publication, our coverage was necessarily 
limited to an analysis of the “on-paper” 
benefits of DX12. To truly experience 
DX12’s streamlined graphics pipeline and 
better multithreaded scaling, games that 
leverage the new API need to become 
available, and as we learned from DX10’s 
disastrous face-plant, (which may owe 
its failure more to its Windows Vista 
exclusivity than to any one feature or 
flaw), those games may never materialize. 
Fast forward to today: We’re happy to 
report that there are a decent number of 
DX12-exclusive games and even more that 
had optional DX12 running modes either 
at launch or patched in shortly thereafter. 
Perhaps most promising of all, the 
DX12 games that are currently available, 
including Forza Horizon 3, Gears Of 
War 4, Star Wars Battlefront, Rise Of 
The Tomb Raider, HITMAN, Deus Ex: 
Mankind Divided, and Battlefield 1 rank 
as some of the best games of last year. The 
API also currently enjoys hearty support 
from most modern game engines and 
numerous publishers. Although we’re still 
in DX12’s relative infancy, we’re confident 
that it has a bright future. 
A DirectX 12 Snapshot 
DirectX 12’s utility to PC gamers is 
a bit of a moving target at the moment. 
Evolving graphics hardware, OS tweaks, 
driver improvements, and developer 
support all tend to have a huge impact 
on the performance of a given title at a 
given point in its life span. Unfortunately, 
anytime we set out to weigh the 
advantages and drawbacks of making a 
particular upgrade, all we have to go on

respective CrossFire and SLI technologies, 
and the most common technique for 
splitting game workloads between two or 
more GPUs is AFR, or alternate frame 
rendering. This essentially gives frame 
No. 1 rendering duties to GPU A, and 
frame No. 2 rendering duties to GPU B,
and so on and so forth. DX9 through 
DX11’s APIs just saw two sequential 
frames coming from a single chunk of 
graphics hardware. 
AFR is essentially a 
workaround for an API 
that lacks specific support 
for more than one graphics 
adapter. It typically 
wouldn’t work unless the 
graphics adapters were 
identical models or at least 
very close to one another 
in performance, and when 
it worked, input lag was 
a common side effect. 
Furthermore, when you 
run two graphics cards 
with 4GB of GDDR5 
each, for example, DX11 
and prior APIs still only 
recognize 4GB of total 
memory, instead of the 
combined 8GB. All frames 
rendered ultimately get 
copied to both frame 
R.I.P. SLI & CrossFire
DX12’s new Explicit Multi-Adapter 
feature is another reason PC gamers can 
get excited. It lets games detect scenarios 
where more than one graphics adapter 
is present, from any vendor, and then 
enables the system to divvy up the 
workload in a variety of ways. Since 
DirectX 9, successfully running multiple 
graphics adapters was heavily reliant on 
vendors AMD and NVIDIA and their 
Other signature DX12 capabilities 
include volume tiled resources and 
conservative rasterization, which are 
both prerequisites for a realistic lighting 
technique called Voxel Global Illumination. 
This feature is also planned to be a part of 
DX11.3, which seeks to backport some of 
DX12’s features for Win7 and Win8/8.1 
users. Conservative rasterization differs from 
standard rasterization in that it is capable of 
producing more accurate results with regard 
to collision detection, occlusion culling, 
and shadow acceleration. Other features 
that require Win10 and DX12-compliant 
hardware include Shader Model 5.1 
support, shader-specified stencil reference 
values, typed UAV load, standard swizzles, 
default texture mapping, swap chains, 
swizzled resources, compressed resources, 
and a series of new blend modes. In DX12, 
raster ordered views enable real-time order-
independent transparency without crippling 
the rendering hardware. This feature could 
be used to render more life-like blended 
textures and complex transparent objects 
such as smoke, fire, and water. New concise 
pipeline state objects simplify how the 
state-changing process occurs and unify 
the pipelines to slash overhead and let 
the graphics hardware perform more calls 
per frame. 
The Xbox One even gets a taste of DirectX 12’s secret sauce. 
DirectX 12’s Explicit Multi-Adapter feature could render CrossFire and SLI unnecessary.

becomes necessary, developers also have 
more control over when and how that 
happens. These functions are good at 
filling in the gaps compared to the more 
traditional render path of a modern GPU, 
but it’s not a complete overhaul of the 
process by any means. The performance 
bump DX12 delivers for a game that uses 
this technique vs. the same game running 
under DX11 tops out at about 20%, but 
we suspect this performance improvement 
is restricted to the times when the GPU is 
at its most inefficient. In short, Microsoft’s 
Synchronization and Multi-Engine 
techniques are all about filling in the gaps 
to keep GPU utilization maxed out. 
of cache, and a handful of specialized 
function units that handle post-
processing duties. Giving developers a 
way to get more performance from a 
given bit of hardware, either in a console 
or PC, is always a good thing.
According to Microsoft, DX12’s take 
on Asynchronous Compute is referred 
to most often as Synchronization and 
Multi-Engine. In essence, this aspect of 
the API lets game developers employ 
queues and command lists to execute 
dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of 
threads concurrently without having to 
have those items pause to wait their turn. 
When synchronizing the thread output 
buffers, which is another major drawback 
of CrossFire and SLI. As anyone who has 
used SLI or CrossFire knows all too well, it 
doesn’t always work, and sometimes it even 
hinders performance compared to running 
the game with a single graphics card. 
Explicit Multi-Adapter in DX12 
changes all that and brings along a 
handful of new techniques for dividing 
up the workload between all GPUs. Split-
frame rendering essentially divides each 
frame into multiple tiles and distributes 
the tile-rendering tasks to the different 
adapters. Asymmetric multi-GPU is 
another technique that lets a game divide 
rendering tasks unequally, between a 
discrete graphics card and an on-CPU 
graphics adapter. For instance, the 
heavy lifting of the game rendering 
would likely fall to the discrete GPU, 
while something like lighting, physics, 
or post-processing would be handled 
by the integrated adapter. DX12 also 
lets the game workload see the two or 
more distinct pools of graphics memory 
as a single combined pool, so two cards 
with 4GB each let the DX12 API access 
all 8GB. 
Asynchronous Compute
There’s a lot of information on the 
internet about Asynchronous Compute, 
but depending on your sources, you’re 
likely to come away with three different 
impressions of how it works based on the 
terminology used by AMD, NVIDIA, 
and Microsoft. The important takeaway is 
that Asynchronous Compute is designed 
to eliminate GPU workload inefficiencies 
that crop up primarily when gaming. 
When AMD and NVIDIA come 
up with new GPU architectures, most 
of the changes that occur from one 
generation to another are designed to 
ensure that when the GPU is working, it 
is working hard, with 100% utilization, 
to give you the fastest frame rates, at 
the highest resolution, with as much eye 
candy as your visual cortex can handle. 
This is an incredibly tricky thing to do 
using a GPU that is largely comprised 
of a hundreds or thousands of general-
purpose units, with limited amounts 
The GIGABYTE GTX 1060 G1 Gaming 6GD features Pascal’s revamped scheduler, which is designed to 
better adapt to DX12 workloads. 
Our SAPPHIRE RX 480 NITRO+ has four ACEs, with each one supporting up to eight queues.
64 February2017  /  www.computerpoweruser.com

NVIDIA’s architecture yields the better 
results under lighter workloads; however, 
AMD’s architecture pulls ahead when 
those command lists start churning out 
more and more tasks to fill up those 
parallel queues. Although AMD got a 
bit of a head start on NVIDIA, both 
vendors are tailoring their respective 
GPU architectures to enable DX12’s most 
promising features. Console and PC game 
developers are diving in with both feet, 
and the DX12 games we have access to 
today are nothing short of stellar. 
Putting DX12 To The Test
A year and a half ago, we had no real 
option for testing DX12 with real-world 
workloads. As a result, we were forced 
to rely on one of the few tests available 
at the time, Futuremark API Overhead 
feature test, which is designed to hammer 
the system with draw calls per frame until 
the frame rate drops below a playable 
30fps. On a test system that relied on a 
decidedly midrange SAPPHIRE Radeon 
R9 285 graphics card with 2GB of 
GDDR5 memory, our multi-threaded 
scores jumped from 655,000 draw calls 
per second to more than 16 million draw 
giving game developers who work on 
multiplatform titles plenty of access to 
AMD’s async shader architecture. 
You may have heard that NVIDIA 
hardware can’t perform Asynchronous 
Compute, but that’s just not true. The 
firm’s Maxwell and Pascal architectures 
(GeForce GTX 900/1000 Series) are 
capable of letting command lists break 
up tasks to run in multiple queues, but 
NVIDIA has a different bag of tools for 
getting the job done. In Pascal, each SM 
(streaming multiprocessor) features a 
geometry engine, with rasterizers shared 
by all SMs in a GPC (graphics processing 
cluster). The GIGABYTE GeForce GTX 
1060 G1 Gaming 6GD we’re using in 
this article features three GPCs and 10 
SMs. Not a whole lot of the underlying 
structure of the GPU’s architecture 
changed between Maxwell and Pascal, 
but the latter now features a revamped 
scheduler designed to leverage Microsoft’s 
Synchronization and Multi-Engine 
strategy to improve SM utilization. Again, 
filling in the gaps for those times when 
GPU utilization drops slightly.
In head-to-head scenarios, using largely 
synthetic tests, it appears as though 
When talking about thousands of threads 
running in parallel, AMD’s architecture is 
the one that, at least on paper, appears to 
be better able to take advantage of DX12’s 
Multi-Engine approach. The AMD Radeon 
RX 480 has 2,304 stream processors, 
almost twice as many general-purpose 
processors such as the NVIDIA GeForce 
GTX 1060, which features 1,280 CUDA 
cores. Traditionally, multithreaded graphics 
workloads are synchronous, which means 
that there’s just one queue, and everything 
that passes through is scheduled and 
synchronized in advance. 
The Polaris architecture of AMD’s 
RX 400 Series GPUs (and most previous 
GCN-based GPUs) feature what AMD 
calls ACEs, or Asynchronous Compute 
Engines, which, when running in a DX12 
environment, give developers access to 
command lists that they can submit to 
three queues: graphics, compute, and 
copy. This opens up AMD’s ACEs to 
significantly more of the heavy lifting of 
games, including rendering 3D objects, 
calculating AI, and performing lighting, 
shadowing, and camera effects workloads. 
The SAPPHIRE Radeon RX 480 
NITRO+ we used for our testing features 
four ACEs, and each ACE supports up to 
eight queues. 
To further illustrate AMD’s favorable 
position with regard to DX12, it’s also 
important to point out that many consider 
AMD’s Mantle graphics API to have been 
the kick in the pants Microsoft needed 
to roll out DX12. Back when AMD was 
working on Mantle, the firm’s goal was to 
create a 3D rendering and gaming-centric 
API that lets developers get “closer to the 
metal,” which in developer-speak means 
unfettered access to the GPU, all of the 
cores of the CPU, and the system memory. 
Sound familiar? In 2015, AMD donated 
Mantle to the Khronos Group, and the 
organization renamed it Vulkan. 2016’s 
DOOM is an example of a game that runs 
on either OpenGL or the Vulkan API. 
The role consoles play in the success of 
a gaming API should not be downplayed. 
AMD’s hardware is under the hood of the 
Xbox One, PS4, as well as the souped-up 
PS4 Pro and Project Scorpio, which is

advantage of Asynchronous Compute. 
We tested this game in DX11 and DX12 
with the Level Of Detail slider set to Ultra, 
SMAA enabled, and texture quality maxed. 
Rise Of The Tomb Raider got its 
DX12 running mode patched-in post 
release, and it’s an NVIDIA TWIMTBP 
(The Way It’s Meant To Be Played) title. 
The game was running on the Very High 
graphics preset, with SMAA enabled, and 
we used the overall score for our results. 
The third game we ran was Deus 
Ex: Mankind Divided, another AMD 
Gaming Evolved title, at the Very High 
preset, with 4X MSAA. According to an 
AMD Community blog post, Deus Ex 
also uses Asynchronous Compute to yield 
“more efficient use of your GPU to enable 
these two cards because neither card 
is a clear winner, when priced equally, 
when subjected to a handful of DX11 
and DX12 games. We ran the game 
benchmarks at both 1,920 x 1,080 and 
2,560 x 1,440, which is the sweet spot for 
these cards in most games. 
The 3DMark Time Spy test, the 
synthetic benchmark, differs significantly 
from the API Overhead feature in that 
it is designed to at least mimic realistic 
gaming workloads in addition to natively 
supporting a host of DX12’s headlining 
features, including Asynchronous Compute, 
Explicit Multi-Adapter, and multithreading. 
As one of the most recent examples of an 
AMD Gaming Evolved title to implement

calls per second in DX11 and DX12, 
respectively. Although that sounds 
impressive, it’s still a synthetic test, and the 
workloads it generates aren’t even remotely 
similar to the workloads a typical game 
would put your system through. 
But things are different now. To 
document DX12’s real-world impact 
on games under AMD and NVIDIA

benchmark and four real-world game 
benchmarks that let us test in both DX11 
and DX12 modes. To reiterate, we’re 
pitting a SAPPHIRE Radeon RX 480 
NITRO+ against a GIGABYTE GTX 
1060 G1 Gaming 6GD, two midrange 
cards that can be had for about $250 
as we went to press. We also selected

Julien Bouvrais, CTO of 
Deus Ex: Mankind Divided’s

DX12 “the fastest adopted 
API in the last decade.” 
Even before Windows 10

handy, and we like that the feature is baked 
into Opera Neon. It’s almost exactly the same 
as Opera’s pop-out video, though, so you 
may want to temper your excitement.
Pop the hood, and you’ll see that Opera 
Neon is essentially the same as Opera, too. 
It relies on Chromium code and uses the 
Blink engine, so we weren’t surprised to see 
Opera Neon deliver the same performance as 
Google Chrome. We tested both browsers in 
SunSpider, Octane, Kraken, and JetStream. 
Chrome outperformed Opera Neon in every 
benchmark, but never by more than 5%.
Opera Neon’s UI is refreshing, and it’s 
just as usable as any other popular browser. 
Even if it’s just a staging ground for Opera 
Software’s flagship browser, it’s worth taking 
for a spin. ■
screen bubbles. You can, however, shuffle the 
order of any open “tabs” (in Opera Neon’s 
case, more bubbles) that show up in a column 
on the right side of the browser window.
Opera Neon also changes how you use the 
web. For example, the browser’s split screen 
mode lets you display two web pages within 
a single browser window, and you can easily 
adjust each page’s portion of the window. 
Sure, it’s not a particular revolutionary 
addition, especially if you’re already used to 
snapping two browser windows to either side 
of your Desktop, but it’s nonetheless a solid 
feature. Another neat but not quite mind-
blowing trick Opera Neon can do is capture 
screen shots (including a crop tool) of web 
pages and save them to its internal gallery.
Opera Software puts a big emphasis 
on Opera Neon’s video capabilities. The 
centerpiece is its pop-out video feature, 
which essentially clones a video to a separate 
window that lives outside of Opera Neon 
itself. However, this window is bound to the 
host tab; close the tab or pause the original 
video, and the pop-out video closes or pauses, 
as well. Popped-out videos are certainly 
W
hat does it take to “disrupt” web 
browsers these days? As far as market 
share goes, the Big Three—Chrome, Firefox, 
and Edge/Internet Explorer—have been 
firmly entrenched for a while. The remaining 
horde of less popular browsers usually rely on 
a novel feature or two to gain an edge as they 
scuffle over the sliver of pie that’s left over. 
Then there’s Opera. Existing in a kind 
of purgatory between the Big Three and all 
the other fringe browsers, Opera has always 
maintained a loyal following, but it’s never 
been a browser that people have flocked to 
en masse. Now, Opera Software wants to 
give you a glimpse of what the future of 
web browsing could look like, introducing 
Opera Neon, which the developer is calling 
a “concept browser.”
Opera Neon isn’t quite beta software in the 
strictest sense, but it’s also not a fully developed 
browser the same way that Opera itself is. 
For example, Opera Neon lacks several of 
Opera’s key features, including a native ad 
blocker, VPN, and extension support. Further, 
the developer indicates, “We do plan to 
incorporate some of [Opera Neon’s] best new 
features into Opera for computers as early as 
spring 2017.” So, anyone who uses Opera 
Neon isn’t beta-testing software so much as 
they’re beta-testing concepts. We like to call it 
“beta-esque.”
Whatever you want to call it, Opera Neon 
has a decidedly different look than other web 
browsers. When you first launch Opera Neon, 
you’ll notice it uses your Desktop wallpaper 
as its own. Front and center are a series of 
bubbles, which function similarly to other 
browsers’ Frequently Visited tiles. As you 
swing by your favorite websites, that site’s 
“bubble” will rise to the top of Opera Neon’s 
Home screen. The bubbles are somewhat 
customizable. If you don’t like a particular site’s 
ascension to the top of the Home screen, you 
can banish it by clicking its associated “X.” 
It then disappears with a satisfying “poof” 
animation. Less satisfying is the fact that you 
apparently can’t manually rearrange the Home

Super Bowl LI & Tech 
America’s Game Gets Fan-Friendly Upgrades 
B
efore and after Super Bowl 50 was 
played last year in Levi’s Stadium in 
the San Francisco Bay Area, experts cited 
the game as the most technology-driven 
Super Bowl ever. Expect that distinction 
to be short-lived. When Super Bowl LI 
kicks off Feb. 5 in Houston at NRG 
Stadium, it’s practically a given that 
technology will make a greater presence, 
including in terms of wireless connectivity 
available at NRG, how viewers at home 
will watch the game, and how everyone 
will share their experiences socially. 
Really, though, technology is altering 
seemingly every aspect of the NFL and 
sports in general. NFL-specific examples 
of how include players and coaches now 
using Microsoft Surface tablets instead 
of printed photos on the sidelines to 
review plays, players adopting VR to 
improve performance, and the NFL itself 
spearheading a movement to bolster the 
wireless networks in every NFL stadium 
to meet fans’ growing “connectivity 
everywhere” expectations. 
“With tickets at premium prices, it’s 
hard to ask fans to pay to spend time 
in a place where they can’t use their 
phones,” says Paul Kapustka, editor of 
Mobile Sports Report, about the growing 
importance Wi-Fi, mobile apps, and 
other technologies have assumed. “For 
many fans and teams, good connectivity 
is just table stakes.” Among other 
things, the improvements are making 
parking easier, helping fans navigate 
to and around stadiums, and enabling 
such digital ticketing options as easily 
transferring tickets to friends or family. 
NFL teams are also experimenting with 
letting fans order food from their mobile 
devices, complete with in-seat delivery; 
upgrade tickets and purchase game-day 
experiences (think live meetups with 
players); and use stadium-specific apps 
At Super Bowl 50 last year at Levi’s Stadium in the San Francisco Bay Area, a record-breaking 10.1TB 
of Wi-Fi usage was recorded. Largely to meet fans’ growing in-stadium expectations, the National 
Football League has worked to upgrade connectivity in all its stadiums. 
Prior to this past NFL regular season, Houston’s NRG Stadium, which is hosting this year’s Super Bowl 
LI, lacked a Wi-Fi network for fans. For the Super Bowl, 1,260 access points will reportedly be in place 
to support fans’ wireless usage, which essentially has doubled with each Super Bowl. 
70 February2017  /  www.computerpoweruser.com

Further, using the stadium app 
VenueNext developed for the game, 
Bloom was able to seamlessly order food 
and drinks to his seats. “If Houston can 
simply match the connectivity of Santa 
Clara from last year, then it will be a 
successful Super Bowl,” he says. 
The New Gridiron
To get an idea of how far the Super 
Bowl and football in general have 
advanced technically over the decades, 
consider that until recently, a fan couldn’t 
even watch a replay of 1967’s Super Bowl 
1, despite NBC and CBS broadcasting 
the game simultaneously (the only time 
that’s happened), because the tapes 
used to record it were erased following 
the contest. For Super Bowl 50, CBS 
reportedly utilized 70 cameras, including 
those integrated in end zone pylons and 
those part of the groundbreaking Eye 
Vision 360 system, which essentially stops 
a replay at any point to sweep 360 degrees 
around before continuing the replay. 
Today, though, you don’t even need 
to leave the practice field for examples 
of technology’s increasing influence 
on football. Take the MVP (Mobile 
Virtual Player), for example. The 
to view live action, replays, and multiple 
camera angles. “And don’t forget huge 
video scoreboards,” Kapustka says. “With 
the couch the ultimate competition, 
teams realize they need to make the 
game-day experience better than ever and 
are turning more and more to technology 
to help make that happen.” 
And fans are enthusiastically taking 
advantage. Super Bowl 50, for example, 
set several records for Levi’s Stadium, 
including records concerning data usage, 
unique Wi-Fi users, concurrent users, 
and peak Wi-Fi bandwidth. The game 
also generated a reported 4.3 billion 
views of related content on Twitter and 
155 million-plus fan interactions on 
Instagram, making Super Bowl 50 the 
most socially shared Super Bowl ever, 
according to Keith Bruce, last year’s Super 
Bowl Host Committee CEO. 
“Technology is everything at the Super 
Bowl,” says Taylor Bloom, co-founder 
of SportsTechie. “From the broadcast 
to connecting fans at the stadium with 
quality Wi-Fi, the entire spectacle runs on 
increasingly sophisticated technologies.” 
Bloom says the Wi-Fi performance in 
Levi’s Stadium during Super Bowl 50 
was the best he’s experienced anywhere. 
Mobile apps are becoming increasingly 
important to NFL fans, including in terms of 
enhancing their in-stadium experience. The 
stadium app for Super Bowl 50, for example, let 
fans order food from mobile devices and have it 
delivered to their seats. 
Live & Wireless: The Massive Data Usage A Super Bowl Generates
Sometimes, the numbers say it all. This is definitely true when 
considering how important wireless access, mobile apps, and 
technology in general have become to sports teams and fans attending 
games. Just consider data from various resources related to last year’s 
Super Bowl 50 at Levi’s Stadium in the San Francisco Bay Area where 
71,000-plus fans watched. 
According to MobileSportsReport.com, Super Bowl 50’s 10.1TB of Wi-Fi 
usage in the stadium set a single-day record for a Super Bowl. Comcast 
stated that equates to 1.2 million photos at 2MB each or streaming 
6,000-plus hours of HD video. The 10.1TB bested the 6.23TB recorded 
at 2015’s Super Bowl. Of the 10.1TB, 9.3TB reportedly stemmed from 
fans’ usage of the free Super Bowl network. Another 453GB was tied to 
media usage. Super Bowl 50 also broke records for unique Wi-Fi users 
(27,316) and concurrent users (20,300). Also impressive is the 15.9TB 
of combined cellular data MobileSportsReport.com states the four major 
U.S. cellular carriers saw on their networks in and immediately around 
Levi’s Stadium during Super Bowl 50.
Interestingly, Comcast documented the top 10 moments responsible for 
the most data traffic experienced during the Super Bowl at Levi’s Stadium. 
List toppers included the introduction of 50 Super Bowl MVPs, Lady Gaga 
singing the National Anthem while the Blue Angels flew over the stadium, 
the opening kickoff, and the first coach’s challenge. Rounding out the list 
was fan’s usage of apps to help them return home and to their hotels. 
Paul Kapustka, editor of Mobile Sports Report, says there’s always the 
potential for issues to pop up concerning the new wireless network that 
was implemented at Houston’s NRG Stadium prior to this season when 
it experiences the “ultimate stress test” that is a Super Bowl crowd. For 
years, after all, Super Bowl game-day wireless traffic has essentially 
doubled each year, and there’s “no plateau yet in sight,” Kapustka says. 
That said, he says the deployment and equipment teams behind the new 
network have a good track record for stadium deployments and have had 
a full season to work out the kinks. “Between them and the NFL’s own 
tech team, which helps oversee Super Sunday activities, I don’t foresee 
any issues for the fan networks for Super Bowl LI,” he says. 
CPU  /  February2017 71

as reaching 23.24mph while traversing 
139.37 total yards on a kickoff return.  
For Super Bowl LI, Bloom is interested 
in seeing how such technological 
innovations can provide fans watching at 
home with new perspectives into the game’s 
overall story. “Anything from cameras in 
the pylons to player-tracking technology 
that can help broadcasters quantify player 
performance in ways that were previously 
not possible highly interests me,” he says. 
“In the end, sports are content, and the best 
content comes from great stories. So I’m 
looking to see how technology can provide 
new story elements.”
The Road To Game Day 
Since 2013, the NFL has been on a 
mission to enhance the fan experience 
in every NFL stadium in terms of 
connectivity, mobile apps, video screens, 
and other tech-related features. The 
stadiums that have resulted from the 
heavy tech investments are “technological 
marvels,” Bloom says. 
As TechRepublic.com points out, 
the upgrades initially were meant 
to keep millennials—a generation 
of users who expect consistently good 
and analytics platform that captures 
real-time location data, speed, and 
acceleration “for every player, every play, 
on every inch of the field.” Essentially, 
RF sensors situated in players’ shoulder 
pads and throughout NFL stadiums help 
capture real-time game data that teams, 
broadcasters, fantasy owners, and fans can 
all dissect and use. This includes via an 
app for the Xbox One, Surface devices, 
and Windows.  
At NFL.com, Next Gen Stats are 
available for Passing, Ball 
Carriers, and Defense 
categories. Ball Carriers, 
for example, includes data 
that details the maximum 
speed measured in miles per 
hour that a player reaches 
on a given play carrying 
the ball. Longest play data, 
meanwhile, shows how 
far a ball carrier traveled 
during a play regardless 
of how many actual yards 
were gained. This season, 
for example, Next Gen 
Stats charted Kansas City 
Chiefs receiver Tyreek Hill 
Pittsburgh Steelers, Dallas Cowboys, and 
Indianapolis Colts are among eight teams 
that have tested this $8,300 practice 
tool billed as “the world’s first and only 
motorized, self-righting, mobile training 
dummy.” Conceived by Dartmouth 
College football coach Buddy Teevens, 
the MVP notably never gets tired and 
can run a five-second 40-yard dash. At 
180 pounds, the MVP was engineered to 
mimic the height and weight of college 
and pro players. Thus, the “MVP can 
take a hit” while giving players realistic 
tackling, pursuit, and pass defense 
reps without “the impact and fatigue 
associated with athlete-on-athlete 
training.” That means less man-on-man 
contact and risk of injury, including head-
related ones.
Another tech-driven practice 
tool teams have embraced is the 
HIGHandTIGHT Training Football, a 
$170 football that literally whistles when 
properly held. Meant to help running 
backs and receivers reduce their fumbles, 
the ball integrates multiple sensors so 
that if held incorrectly, the whistling 
stops. Tom Creguer, the ball’s inventor, 
told BizTech.com that the ball “teaches 
muscle memory” and “creates the habit of 
thinking about ball positioning first rather 
than running fast and avoiding guys.” 
A tech-related effort that doesn’t help 
improve skills but does offer insight 
into NFL players’ abilities is the data-
driven Next Gen Stats, a research, data, 
Through its Next Gen Stats project, the NFL is making various types of research and data available to 
fans, including fantasy football owners, to dig deeper into players’ abilities and performances. 
Technology is working its way into the NFL in numerous ways both 
on and off the field. An on-the-field example is the HIGHandTIGHT 
football, which integrates sensors and emits a whistle to indicate a 
player is holding the ball properly to reduce fumbles.

And as a team operator and ownership, they 
want people sharing their experience in their 
environment, as well,” Brams says.  
Fan demand only ramps up for Super 
Bowls. At Super Bowl 50, a record 10TB 
of data passed over Levi’s Stadium’s Wi-Fi 
network. “Fans come earlier and stay 
longer,” Brams says. “Everything from a 
network-capacity perspective ramps up, as 
well. You get a normal amount of people,

those, but think about a Super Bowl

John Brams, Extreme Networks director 
of sports and entertainment, says in-stadium

same way concessions and bathrooms are 
just expected. Realistically, he says, the 
network is there to support what fans do 
on a daily basis, which 50% of the time is 
social media. “People want to share their

what they’re doing in that environment.

games. Upgrades were also needed to 
handle the increase in higher-quality

enhancing in-stadium connectivity “was 
about the tolerance level for our younger 
fans” and much less about “accessibility 
and connectivity for other fans. Now, it’s 
every person who attends a game.” 
At Levi’s Stadium, enhancing 
connectivity meant 400 miles of data 
cabling, 12,000-plus physical network 
ports, 1,200-plus Wi-Fi access points, 
about 1,200 Bluetooth beacons, and a 
40Gbps backbone of available internet 
bandwidth. For the 2018 Super Bowl at 
the Minnesota Vikings’ new U.S. Bank 
Stadium, there will reportedly be enough 
antennas and Wi-Fi access points in place 
that “all 66,200 fans could theoretically 
jump on” the network at once. 
Historically, Kapustka says getting a 
good signal at a stadium was impossible. 
Today, though, most pro sports venues 
and many large college arenas and 
stadiums offer high-quality Wi-Fi and 
enhanced cellular. “It’s always a nice 
surprise when the basic connectivity 
exceeds your expectations, no matter 
where you roam inside a stadium,” he 
says. “At the NFL venues I’ve been in 
recently—Levi’s Stadium, AT&T 
Stadium, and Sports Authority Field 
at Mile High—coverage is solid across 
the board on both Wi-Fi and cellular.” 
Feature-wise, Kapustka says the in-seat 
delivery services at Levi’s Stadium “were 
surprisingly fast and welcome, allowing 
me to watch an entire touchdown drive 
while waiting for my beer and pretzel, 
instead of standing in line.”
For Super Bowl LI at NRG Stadium, 
Extreme Networks is serving as the official 
Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi analytics provider. Prior 
to this season, Wi-Fi didn’t even exist at 
NRG. Reportedly, the company’s wired 
and wireless solution includes 1,260 access 
points (including custom under-the-seat 
APs) located throughout the stadium. The 
company’s Wi-Fi Coaches program will 
Madden Gamers Get The NFL Treatment 
Where football and videogames are concerned, “Madden” is the word that comes to mind for 
most. Thus, it makes perfect sense that EA and the NFL announced in mid-December a national 
Madden 17 Club Series tournament involving participation from eight NFL teams, including the 
Pittsburgh Steelers, Minnesota Vikings, New England Patriots, Buffalo Bills, Seattle Seahawks, 
Jacksonville Jaguars, San Francisco 49ers, and Kansas City Chiefs.
Starting in late December, Madden players could select which team to represent in online 
qualifying ladder tournaments that started in early January, from which eight finalists will move 
on to club tournaments held at the team’s respective facilities. The Jaguars team, for example, 
was scheduled to hold its competition at US Assure Club East using NanoLumens LED displays 
measuring 19 x 11 feet to create a “larger-than-life Madden experience.” 
At the Club 
tournaments, the 
finalists will compete 
for $10,000 in prizes 
(including cash, 
player-autographed 
memorabilia, and team 
merchandise) before 
live audiences watching 
via streams on each 
team’s website and 
mobile app, as well 
as the Madden NFL 
Twitch Channel. Club 
tournaments will begin 
Feb. 18 in Minnesota 
and conclude March 
22 at the Chiefs’ 
Arrowhead Stadium. 
Eventually, one winner 
from each club tournament will advance to the Madden 17 Club Series Championship in April 
where another $50,000 in prizes will be on tap. Finalists will also have a chance to qualify for 
the 2017 EA Sports Madden Championship in May.    
Through its Madden 17 Club Series tournament, EA is giving players the

Last year, Japanese State broadcaster 
NHK actually used 8K cameras to 
broadcast Super Bowl 50 in 8K Super-Hi 
Vision (16 times the resolution of HD). 
4K.com reports NHK specifically used 
Ikegami SHK-810 cameras, which 
house a 33-million-pixel Super 35mm 
CMOS sensor. While the 8K broadcast 
was only viewable within Levi’s Stadium 
and at NHK’s Tokyo-based headquarters, 
broadcasting the game in 8K was part 
of bigger plan to air public 8K live 
broadcasts in time for the 2020 Olympic 
Games in Tokyo. 
Increasingly, other technologies are 
joining the television as visual options 
for fans to view football. During this 
Reality Sets In
One thing that’s certain about every Super 
Bowl is that one team will win and one will 
lose. Another is that every Super Bowl makes 
for big business and big viewing. Last year’s 
Super Bowl attracted 111.9 million television 
viewers, for example. The post-game show 
itself attracted 70 million, making it the 
second-most-watched telecast for 2016. In 
terms of business, beyond the ad dollars 
generated, the Super Bowl helps move a lot 
of television sets. Consumer Reports notes 
that stores discount units 22% on average 
in the weeks prior to the game, with deals 
tending to “favor crowd-pleasing large-screen 
sets.” This year, experts agree it’s larger 4K sets 
football fans are eying. 
with the entertainment going on before 
the game, the halftime show—that all goes 
above and beyond the actual football.” 
Further, Extreme Networks must build out 
capacity in and out of NRG Stadium to 
accommodate media requirements. 
Extreme Networks began its work 
about 18 months ago. Planning has 
notably included preparing for the 
unknown. “We’re still in weekly meetings 
in partnership with the NFL, stadium 
operations people, and our partners in this 
project, making sure we’re counting for 
the unknown,” says Brams, who points to 
the roughly 30-minute power outage that 
occurred during 2013’s Super Bowl XLVII 
as an example. 
The Bumpy Reception For Microsoft Surface Tablets
When the NFL and Microsoft inked a five-year $400 million deal in 2013 
to put Microsoft Surface tablets on NFL sidelines to use during games, the 
arrangement seemed a no-brainer. After all, tablets promised to eliminate 
the hassle of printing photos for players and coaches to review previous 
plays while simultaneously introducing greater speed, efficiency, and 
versatility. Not everyone has been a fan, however, including Bill Belichick, 
arguably the NFL’s greatest coach ever.  
Despite the advantages, some coaches and players have voiced 
complaints about tablet dependability. Such a claim came after last 
year’s AFC Championship game between the Denver Broncos and 
Belichick’s New England Patriots when the Patriots’ 
tablets malfunctioned for several minutes during a key 
touchdown drive by the Broncos, who won the game 20-
18. Belichick later depicted such malfunctions as being 
“fairly common.” The NFL and Microsoft maintained 
network issues were to blame and not the tablets.
Belichick never did become a fan. In October, he said the 
tablets were “too undependable” and he’d be sticking 
with photos, “which several of our other coaches do, as 
well, because there just isn’t enough consistency in the 
performance of the tablets.” Days later, Yusuf Mehdi, 
Microsoft corporate vice president, Windows and Devices 
Group, acknowledged the debate but pointed out that 
prior to tablets, “coaches and players pored over stacks of 
static, black-and-white photos,” meaning “someone had 
to take the images, send them to a printer, wait for black-
and-white prints, grab them from the printer, and work to 
stick them in a three-ring binder” before delivering them 
to the sidelines. 
Conversely, Mehdi stated tablets enable teams to “respond nearly in real-
time,” including with “dynamic, full-color images, up to seven times faster 
than the printed page. Game analysis is more efficient, productive, and 
competitive—enabling quicker decision-making by coaches and players, 
in a game often decided by inches and seconds.”
Elsewhere, The Ringer detailed other issues coaches and players have 
with tablets, including one related to the digital playbooks players now 
receive on tablets. One worry is players are missing “major details” by 
relying too heavily on technology and could experience an “information 
overload” leading to “paralysis by analysis” setting in. 
While some coaches and players have voiced complaints about the dependability of 
Microsoft Surface tablets, their use on NFL sidelines has also been credited with greatly 
enhancing how players and coaches can now review plays during games.

Because the Super Bowl is also 
an advertising event, Bloom foresees a 
scenario one day where advertisers use 
a device or fans’ smartphones to project 
Super Bowl ads into a living room. “As 
for the in-stadium experience, I’m again 
more bullish on AR than VR. AR could 
enhance the Super Bowl halftime show 
or action on the field more easily than 
placing someone in their own virtual 
reality to experience it when they are 
already there in person,” Bloom says.  
According to CRN.com, New England 
Patriots President Jonathan Kraft recently 
hinted at potential AR features fans might 
experience in Gillette Stadium, including 
accessing AR via smartphones or glasses. 
Fans, for example, could “look through 
the phone or glasses and see the 22 
players on the field and above them a 
little cloud seeing who that player is and 
letting you know anything pertinent you 
want to about them,” Kraft stated. 
Kapustka says AR and VR could 
eventually become part of the fan’s game-day 
experience, though he believes it will likely 
happen in a separate area, such as a lounge 
or club. “The ability to bring live VR content 
to seats via Wi-Fi is many years in the 
future because right now, there’s way too 
much bandwidth needed to generate VR 
content—a load Wi-Fi networks of today 
simply can’t handle in crowded places,” he 
says. “I think VR and AR broadcasts may 
end up being something more popular on 
the couch than in the stadium. It’s hard to 
cheer and high-five the person next to you if 
you’re stuck inside a VR headset.” 
Eventually, Kapustka foresees 
features already being used in television 
broadcasts, such as a player’s biological 
stats or the speed he’s running, coming 
to stadiums either on big screens or 
an AR display. “Fans love this kind of 
information, and if you can make it 
happen in a way that’s not claustrophobic, 
my guess is it will be very popular,” he 
says. That said, Kapustka says the biggest 
issues people still have with attending 
live events “are simple things like traffic, 
parking, and waiting in lines. Technology 
still hasn’t been used well enough to make 
those things go fully away.” ■
NFL regular season, for example, 
Twitter live-streamed 10 Thursday Night 
Football games, with later ones ranging 
in viewership from 2.6 to 3.1 million. 
Moving forward, expect VR and AR to 
also have a greater impact on the game. 
Already, the NFL plans to begin using 
VR simulators and POV cameras to help 
train referees. Through partnerships with 
NextVR and Voke, meanwhile, the league 
has been producing highlight packages 
fans can watch free in VR. NextVR, for 
example, teamed with NFL Films to 
offer highlights for three games in late 
November and December. (NextVR is 
also broadcasting 25 NBA games in VR 
this season available via the NBA League 
Pass.) Voke also worked with NFL Films 
to offer highlights for four games in 
December and early January. 
The NFL also partnered with Google 
on a nine-part series filmed in 360-degree 
VR using Google’s Jump system. Available 
for viewing using Google’s Daydream View 
headset, the series debuted Thanksgiving 
Day on the NFL’s YouTube channel. Intel, 
meanwhile, recently announced plans 
to use its 360-degree replay technology 
at Super Bowl LI via a “Be The Player” 
campaign featuring New England Patriots 
quarterback Tom Brady. It’s being billed 
as the “football fan’s ultimate dream.” Intel 
will reportedly use nearly 40 5K cameras 
to help Fox replay about 20 big plays in 
360-degree glory. Each replay reportedly 
consumes about 1TB of data. 
Moving forward, Bloom says VR and 
AR could be heavily involved in the at-
home experience for fans. “The Super 
Bowl is one of the most social viewing 
experiences for any sports fans. Therefore, 
VR will not penetrate the Super Bowl 
viewing experience as much as AR will,” he 
predicts. “AR can be presented in someone’s 
living room, and everyone in the room 
can interact with it at once to enhance the 
experience.” VR, though, isolates a user 
into his own reality, Bloom says. Even if 
a VR solution emerges that lets viewers 
collectively view an event, Bloom doesn’t see 
it “surpassing the experience of having 20 
friends enjoying each other’s company and 
sharing good food during the game.” 
The Modern Ways To 
Watch Super Bowl LI
When the opening kickoff for Super Bowl LI 
sails through the air in Houston’s NRG Stadium 
Feb. 5, 72,000 or so fans will see it live. The 
rest of us (meaning 110 million or more in the 
United States alone) will have to find another 
way to watch. There will be many options. 
Most people will simply catch Fox’s national 
broadcast in which Joe Buck and Troy Aikman 
will call the game. Fox will also provide a live, 
free stream on Fox Sports GO without any need 
for users to authenticate. Overall, users can 
watch via iOS, Android, Windows, and Amazon 
devices and via Apple TV, Roku, Chromecast, 
Amazon Fire, and Xbox One connected devices. 
Notably, Fox is working with 170-plus affiliates 
to sell and deliver local digital ads for the 
stream in addition to showing the national ads 
many people specifically watch Super Bowls 
to see. Last year, CBS’ stream of Super Bowl 
50 reportedly averaged 1.4 million viewers per 
minute and 3.96 million unique streams total. 
For cord-cutters and cord-nevers, connecting 
an over-the-air antenna to a television to pick 
up Fox’s signal is an option, as is acquiring 
a Fox-included package from Sling TV, 
PlayStation Vue, or DirectTV. NFL Game Pass 
subscribers can watch the game on-demand 
after it originally airs. If all else fails, there’s 
Westwood One’s national radio broadcast. 
In the stadium, fans won’t be hurting for 
screens to watch live action, replays, and 
more. NRGpark.com states the seating bowl 
area alone features two end-zone scoreboard 
displays, with each end zone including a video 
LED board and four lamp-matrix displays; 
one 360-degree LED Fascia display; two 
LED Fascia displays; two game-in-progress 
scoreboards; and a field-lighting array that 
includes “480 optically enhanced luminaries 
with more than 65,000 LEDs.” Each concourse 
and club area, meanwhile, sports an HD LED 
video board and four HD video projection 
screens. Overall, there are 1,550-plus HD LCD 
flat screens in the stadium’s public areas.

The King Is Back
BY CHRIS TRUMBLE
$59.99 (PC, XOne, PS4)   •   ESRB: (M)ature  •   Capcom
residentevil7.com
Longtime fans of survival horror videogames know that although there 
were one or two precursors, Resident Evil was the game that kicked off the 
popularity of SH games in earnest in 1996. Those same fans also probably 
know that for many years, alternating releases of Resident Evil games and 
Silent Hill titles were the tentpole launches that continued to fuel gamers’ 
appetite for scary games, which eventually led to the proliferation of horror-
themed games that we enjoy today.
Over the years, however, the Resident Evil and Silent Hill series diverged 
considerably in theme and content to the point where they were more like 
members of two distinct genres than entries in the same one. This began 
especially with the arrival of Resident Evil 4 in 2005; RE4 was a great game, 
but it was more of an action shooter with elements of horror mixed in here 
and there, and that trend continued with the releases of Resident Evil 5 and 
RE6. Silent Hill, on the other hand, mostly stayed true to its survival-horror 
roots, creating atmosphere with oppressive, creeping dread more than with 
automatic weapons and truckloads of ammo.
Earlier this week, Capcom debuted the latest entry in the Resident Evil saga, 
Resident Evil 7, and the game is notable for a couple pretty big reasons: 
For starters, it is the first major release in the series to shift the player’s 
perspective to full-time first-person, and second, it’s very clearly a return 
to the basic principles of survival horror: creepy environments, terrifying 
opponents, and extremely limited resources.
In RE7, you play the role of Ethan Winters, a regular guy whose wife Mia left 
home three years ago and never came back. The game opens as you drive 
to a dilapidated plantation out in the bayou in Louisiana in response to an 
email that arrived out of the blue from your wife, asking you for help. Although 
the old place is crumbling with decay, it is not vacant, and you very quickly 
encounter the Baker family, several people who are at best stark raving mad; 
it’s hard to say what the worst-case scenario is.
As Ethan, you must run, fight, hide, and solve puzzles to survive and 
to piece together the story of what has happened here to your wife 
and to the Baker family, not to mention the many travelers they have 
waylaid and who subsequently disappeared. You have access to a 
few weapons, but you will not find the ammo you’d need to go into 
every enemy encounter guns blazing—often, avoiding your foes is the 
best policy. RE7 also drops you into a number of boss fights at pivotal 
moments, and in these situations there are often more expedient ways 
to win than just shooting a lot, providing you can recognize and execute 
them (pun intended).
Along the way, you’ll collect keys for specific rooms, find herbs to heal your 
injuries, and enjoy other Resident Evil gameplay staples. The game is built 
on Capcom’s new RE Engine, and although there are a few uncanny-valley 
issues with the game’s characters, they generally look pretty good, and the 
environments are masterfully done. We played the Xbox One version, but 
it’s also available on PC and PlayStation 4. (The PS4 version is PS4 Pro- and 
PlayStation VR-compatible.)
This game is not for the faint of heart, as no horrific stone is left unturned 
throughout your journey. You’ll hear terrifying sound effects, witness mind-
bending acts of violence, experience jump scares, find creepy videotape 
messages, and wade through buckets of gore. But although the game has 
some flaws in mechanics and execution here and there, it delivers a superbly 
scary experience that no survival horror fan should miss. ■
Yeah, we know you have blogs to post, video to encode, reports to write, and code to compile. We do, 
too, but you have to take a break once in a while (and maybe blow some stuff up). That’s why each 
month we give you the lowdown on what to expect from the latest interesting games.

Purge The Xenos

$39.99 (PC)   •   ESRB: n/a   •   Focus Home Interactive
www.spacehulk-deathwing.com
In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only war. But for 
now, there are also some really fun games based on Games 
Workshop’s immensely popular Warhammer: 40K universe, and 
Space Hulk: Deathwing from Focus Home Interactive is one 
of them.
Those familiar with the Warhammer 40,000 premise will recall 
that space hulks are sort of like the interstellar equivalent of our 
oceanic garbage patches, except that instead of consisting of 
bottles and cans and the like, they are made of ancient derelict 
spaceships that were lost long ago in the immaterium. These 
twisted amalgamations of old ships are occasionally ejected from 
the warp for various reasons, and when they enter real space, 
they cause big problems, as they are ideal breeding grounds for 
Tyranid Genestealers and other (also terrible) things.
The very first Space Hulk game was a board game issued by 
Games Workshop in 1989, and since that time there have been a 
handful of videogame adaptations of that concept. Deathwing is 
the latest, drawing upon both the old Space Hulk lore and that of 
the Dark Angels, a Space Marine chapter steeped in mystery and 
betrayal. The Deathwing is the Dark Angels’ elite first company; in 
the game, Deathwing leader Grand Master Belial dispatches the 
company to intercept a space hulk that has entered real space 
and purportedly contains an ancient Dark Angels warship lost 
nearly 10,000 years prior during the great Heresy.
Long story short, the game is a first-person shooter that puts you 
in the role of a Deathwing Librarian, a superhuman psychic warrior 
with incredibly powerful armor and weapons. You have a squad of 
Deathwing Terminators at your disposal, and you have to fight your 
way through the hulk to the Dark Angels ship to unlock its mysteries.
The campaign portion of the game has some simple squad control 
elements, and you start out with just a couple of basic weapon 
options and a couple of basic (but very cool) psychic attacks. As 
you complete missions and discover ancient relics, you and your 
squad mates will have access to more advanced weaponry, which 
you can select before missions and during them when you use a 
psychic gate to jump back to your base of operations. There’s also 
a four-player co-op mode that lets you and your friends select 
your own classes and customize your loadouts to take on the 
dangers of the space hulk as a team.
At launch, the game had significant problems with bugs that in some 
cases could even break the game and cause you to have to restart 
from your most recent save point, but many of these have been 
ironed out with a patch that dropped Dec. 21. 
There are still some issues; squad AI isn’t as good as it could be, 
and some of the menus and especially the map screen are wonky 
and frustrating. But the core gameplay is very solid, and both 
the characters and the environments look like they were ripped 
right from the pages of your favorite Warhammer 40K novels. 
Deathwing does a nice job of making you feel like a massive 
Space Marine Terminator. The game doesn’t do a lot of hand-
holding for those who aren’t familiar with the universe, but if 
you’re a fan, this game is a must-play experience. ■

Manifest Destiny In Space

astroneer.space
ASTRONEER is a planet and space exploration game that’s currently in 
pre-alpha on PC and Xbox One. Although it’s rare that I review games that 
are unfinished, I decided to take a chance on this one because I’m a sucker 
for space, and January is such a wasteland when it comes to new game 
releases. I’m happy to report that ASTRONEER scratches the same itch as 
another unfinished indie game I took a chance on, called Minecraft. 
ASTRONEER opens with your space-suited character seated in a pod 
and blasting from the EXO Dynamics space station to the nearby 
planet. You are a 25th-century pioneer, and there’s a wide universe of 
procedurally generated planets available for colonization, exploration, 
and valuable mineral harvesting. You need but land, stake your claim, 
and survive to reap the rewards. 
Your pod becomes the central hub of your base, and it’ll sprout arms 
and new modules when fed the right resources. These modules include 
a printer for creating batteries, solar panels, generators, and fuel 
cells; a trade platform for exchanging your glut of mined resources for 
those hard-to-find elements you need to craft the next item on your 
list; smelters for turning ore into usable metals; research modules for 
turning enigmatic discoveries into useful equipment; and a vehicle 
bay for manufacturing rovers, trucks, shuttles, and spaceships for 
expanding your sphere of influence. 
When you’re near your pod, oxygen and energy are infinite, and you 
can run around freely mining and reshaping the landscape using your 
all-in-one matter manipulator. I’m borrowing that term from Starbound 
because it’s better than the official “deform tool.” With it you can dig 
holes, collect resources, and harvest organic material using the Lower 
Mode; or use the Raise Mode to create mounds, bridges over chasms, 
fill in holes, or point it at your feet to give yourself a higher vantage 
point. There’s also a Level Mode that acts like a smoothing function. 
Once you step too far away from your pod and its tentacular modules, 
however, your suit’s oxygen tank begins to empty and your matter 
manipulator taps into your suit’s very limited energy reserves. To 
explore farther afield, you’ll need to put down tethers that keep your 
O2 and energy topped off, and it won’t be long before you’ll need to 
venture into the unknown to gather more and rarer resources. 
With its pinkish, yellowish, purplish screenshots, space themes, 
and the procedurally generated buzzword in tow, you might think 
ASTRONEER bears more than a passing resemblance to No Man’s 
Sky. But by releasing early, ASTRONEER is avoiding all the major 
missteps of NMS. While it does feel like there are pieces of the 
puzzle still missing, ASTRONEER is fun to play and it’s still delivering 
surprises more than 15 hours in. Best of all, it’s just $20, and it 
supports up to four-player multiplayer. 
I played ASTRONEER like I played Minecraft when I first encountered 
it as a plucky indie title, by going in blind, sans wiki. The game’s 
inventory needs work, it plays much better with a mouse and keyboard, 
and there’s a definite sense that one could easily become stranded 
without a way back to safety. It can be frustrating at times, but as long 
as you accept that mild frustration is to be expected when trying to 
colonize an alien world, you’ll have an absolute blast. ■

Mo’ Mayor, Mo’ Problems
BY VINCE COGLEY
$39.99 (PC)   •   ESRB: Rating Pending
Kalypso Media   • www.kalypsomedia.com
Gamers have been building and running cities since 1982, when Don 
Daglow’s Utopia established the genre. Of course, seven years later city 
builders really rose to prominence in 1989, the year Maxis introduced 
the granddaddy of them all, SimCity. Dozens of city builders have come 
and gone since then, and although they’ve steadily grown more intricate 
(often allowing you to drill down to the thoughts, desires, and ambitions of 
individual citizens), the basic objectives haven’t changed much. 
Urban Empire, the work of Finnish developer Reborn Games, doesn’t want to 
be known as a city builder. Instead, it’s a “city ruler.” Sure, you build, but it’s 
a mostly hands-off process. Urban Empire instead focuses on the politicking 
necessary to successfully run your city. As your city develops, the game not only 
requires you to deal with all sorts of difficulties that typically affect a town but 
also pits you against political rivals to outmaneuver. It’s no wonder that Kalypso, 
which publishes the popular island sim Tropico, scooped up this game.
From the jump, Urban Empire presents you with options, options galore. You 
start by choosing from one of four political families, each with attributes that 
provide specific bonuses to your bottom line, to start and rule over a new 
town in the fictitious European country of Swarelia. The campaign begins 
in 1820 amidst the Industrial Revolution, and as you’ll quickly learn, the 
technology in Urban Empire is just as pivotal as the politics. 
Urban Empire has a distinctly Eurocentric feel to it. In most regards, locating 
the game world between Austria and Italy (per Kalypso’s blog) matters little. 
Buildings are buildings, and streets are streets. However, when it comes to 
the game’s political parties, this Yankee admits that it wasn’t always easy 
to keep track of what each faction wants. (“OK, now who are these guys in 
the Free Democratic Party, and exactly how free and/or democratic are they 
hoping our little burg will be?”) I learned quickly, though, because for as much 
as Urban Empire wants you to believe that you’re the boss, almost nothing
happens without the say-so of your city council.
Urban Empire kindly gives you the option to begin a campaign in tutorial 
mode, which is something I highly recommend. The actual building process 
essentially consists of drawing a district, allocating its zones (residential, 
commercial, industrial), and deciding whether to include infrastructure (gas, 
electricity, etc.) and public services (schools, clinics, police stations—a rare 
opportunity to actually place structures where you want them). Your town 
then grows itself; homes and businesses automatically spring up, requiring 
almost no input or guidance from the player. The first district is “free,” as far 
as spending political capital goes, but be prepared to throw down at City Hall 
when it’s time to expand. Want to make changes to an existing district? That’ll 
require—you guessed it—another vote.
Amping up the political aspect of building and running a city is definitely 
intriguing, so it’s a little disappointing that Urban Empire delivers very little 
intrigue. Yes, you can blackmail and bribe certain council members, and the 
game’s multiparty system is unlike anything you can expect to encounter in 
American politics. However, too often votes boil down to “Is there enough 
cash in the city treasury to afford this?” as opposed to real political wrangling.
In truth, Urban Empire shines brightest when it channels Nikola Tesla instead 
of Boss Tweed. Reborn Games clearly spent a lot of time constructing the 
game’s tech tree and keeping it reasonably consistent with technological and 
social trends as they’ve developed over the past two centuries. Encouraging 
innovation has a positive payoff for your citizens, but actually implementing 
new technologies has a price tag. I should note that you can use your family’s 
wealth to finance development, but once you zero out your own bank 
account, be prepared to do some more political panhandling.
The variety of architecture in Urban Empire, and how it changes through 
history, is also laudable. Ultimately, Reborn Games has created an interesting

Q&A With John Titlow 
The State Of 
Streaming Music Services
that growth trickles down to artists. In 
some cases it does. If you’re a big-name 
artist, you’re seeing some real money now 
from streaming. But if you’re a smaller, 
independent artist or a mid-tier artist, 
you’re still wondering how this is all going 
to play out for you. You might land on 
a Spotify playlist and see your plays go 
through the roof, and you might generate 
some interest and that might help you 
plot your tour or something like that, 
but the bigger question continues to 
loom of how does this new kind of music 
economy ultimately fare for especially the 
smaller and middle-class artist? 
I will say that there seems to be 
a growing emphasis on the part of the 
streaming platforms to cater to the needs 
of artists, or at least try to. Pandora is 
busy reinventing itself as we speak, but 
you can tell from its acquisitions at the 
end of 2015 of things like Ticketfly and 
Next Big Sound that it’s focused on 
that, and I think it’s kind of in its DNA 
some growth after years and years of 
decline. I think from its vantage point, 
things are starting to turn around, but 
again, there are multiple players in what 
we can call the “music industry” today. 
There are questions around whether 
Q
: Until relatively recently, some 
people wondered if the music 
industry as we’ve known it would be 
around much longer. Now, some people 
are saying music streaming has given 
the industry new life. Where do you see 
the industry?  
JT
: In general, I’d say overall there 
are reasons for promise, and there 
are reasons to be uncertain. Overall, 
music consumption is increasing. I think 
we saw an almost 5% increase in music 
consumption overall in 2016. That’s 
according to BuzzAngle Music, which just 
put out a report. Of course, that’s driven 
largely by streaming. Audio streaming 
reached a new high, something like 
250 billion streams last year. So clearly 
people are listening to more music. Sales 
of physical albums have been declining 
for quite a while, but we’ve reached a 
point in the past year or two where the 
record industry is finally able to report 
You only need to let a few findings from a January-released report from BuzzAngle Music sink in to understand the significant shift 
the U.S. music industry is undergoing. While overall consumption of music rose about 5% between 2015 and 2016, consumption 
of audio streams climbed a whopping 82.6% to reach about 250 billion streams in 2016. Arguably more important, the percentage 
of overall streams tied to paid music subscription services (Apple Music, Spotify, Tidal, etc.) reached 76% in 2016, up from 62% in 
2015. Conversely, physical album sales (down 11.7%), digital album sales (down 19.4%), and overall album sales (down 15.6%) all 
fell in 2016. In fact, audio streams on an average day in 2016 topped song sales for the entire year (734 million). 
Despite the encouraging growth for paid subscription streams, concerns still exist. For the music labels, there’s an issue 
concerning the difference in payouts artists see from subscription services compared to those from free, ad-supported options 
such as Spotify’s free listening tier. For subscription services, there’s still a matter of turning a profit, something the major 
players reportedly have yet to do. John Paul Titlow has covered the music-technology sector for years, including for Billboard,
Noisey, and Esquire. A musician himself, Titlow recently detailed for Fast Company seven ways the streaming music industry 
will change this year. One prediction calls for at least one major service not surviving the year. We spoke with Titlow about the 
impact music streaming is having on the industry; how home speakers/digital assistants such as the Amazon Echo could alter 
consumers’ views about paying for music; the growing importance that playlists are assuming; and more. (You can read our

clear. Some of it’s up there and it’s getting 
monetized or someone else is monetizing 
it. They’re figuring out various ways to 
improve that, but, again, the end result is 
a certain amount of content on YouTube 
is not generating revenue for the artists 
and songwriters and the labels. There is an 
enormous part of it that is, but even on a 
large scale, those ad rates either generated 
by YouTube or Spotify’s ad-supported tier 
just don’t add up to being the same as if 
you have someone’s credit card, they’ve 
committed to subscribing, they’re going 
to renew every month, it’s $10, and you 
know it’s just going to be there. So far, the 
ad side hasn’t come close to catching up. 
Q
: Some insiders believe that music 
downloads may go away in coming 
years, essentially because people are 
willingly shifting from wanting to own 
music to being OK with renting it. Do 
you see such a fate for downloads? 
JT
: I think people still do want to 
own music, but I think digital 
ownership becomes sort of an odd 
concept when you’re almost renting 
digital access. What I think you do see 
are some upward numbers in the physical 
album market. They’re not enormous, 
and I don’t think they’re going to catch 
up with streaming, but vinyl tends to 
have an uptick. Last year, even cassettes 
had an uptick around the holidays. So I 
think people who really love music still 
have an interest in owning, especially 
physical albums. Albums they really love. 
I do think we are moving to a world 
where something like 90% of the music 
listening that most people do will be from 
streaming. You’re going to see fewer and 
fewer downloads. 
It really comes down to Apple. 
There’s a rumor it’s going to stop selling 
downloads at some point, which it denies. 
But at a certain point, if it’s making a 
certain amount of money from Apple 
Music, it might not even make sense to 
run the iTunes store. Or maybe iTunes 
becomes, I don’t know, a place to 
get albums outside of the scope of the 
streaming library.
the “value gap.” There’s a huge explosion 
with streaming overall, and a lot of it 
is paid subscriptions, which is great 
from their vantage point, but there’s still 
quite a lot of it that is YouTube, that is 
Spotify’s free tier, that is SoundCloud. 
If you’re a consumer, it’s great. You can 
find just about everything in the world 
between those services. But if you’re the 
music industry, you’re getting a little bit 
frustrated with the fact that one just pays 
out a lot more than the other. 
Q
: Can you expand on the difference in 
revenue that paid subscription services 
generate compared to what is generated 
by ad-supported music streaming options 
such as Spotify’s free tier?
JT
: Really, it almost comes down 
to simple math. With paid 
subscription services, it’s a much more 
clear-cut formula. If you get people to 
pay—at this point, it’s typically $10 per 
month—for access to music as opposed to 
bringing in ad revenue from that music—
with rates that are simply lower, those are 
per-stream rates—I’m not sure what the 
latest numbers are, but they just don’t add 
up to the same amount. When you get 
into stuff like YouTube, I think the labels 
are especially frustrated because YouTube 
is user-generated, unlike Spotify’s free 
tier, for example. There’s just a lot on 
YouTube that either isn’t being monetized 
or isn’t being monetized the right way. 
YouTube has worked very hard to try 
and build tools to help with that. The 
content idea is all about trying to help 
rightsholders monetize or take down or 
whatever they want to do with content 
uploaded to YouTube. 
You almost forget because YouTube 
is primarily a video service, but it’s an 
enormous source of music, as well. And 
you’ve seen YouTube try and formulize 
that a bit last year with YouTube Red and 
even its music app, which are promising 
steps, but YouTube is still pretty much 
synonymous with free content, and 
a lot of that content is music. And it’s 
being supported with ads, but again, the 
ownership of the content is not always 
with folks like Tim Westergren [Pandora 
founder and CEO], who was a musician. 
Whether that works out for them we’ll 
see, but that’s definitely a motivation 
for them. Spotify last year hired Troy 
Carter [as global head of creator services] 
and is putting a heightened level of 
focus on serving artists and the creative 
community. And this is a crucial thing 
of course. There are those looming 
questions about how artists fare in the 
streaming world, and of course, Apple 
and Tidal are both known for doling out 
presumably very large sums of money for 
exclusive deals with artists. With Tidal 
specifically—even though it’s smaller than 
Spotify and Apple—a chief focus of theirs 
is trying to be more artist-friendly. 
Q
: The terms “music streaming” and 
“subscription music services” often get 
used interchangeably. Can you touch on 
the differences that actually exist between 
the two and why the music industry is 
particularly excited about the latter? 
JT
: From the consumer standpoint, 
they might not seem that much 
different, but you’re either paying for 
one or not. If I’m a listener and I say, “I 
subscribe to Spotify,” I might also jump 
over to SoundCloud or YouTube for other 
things. From the industry standpoint, 
there’s a big difference there, of course. 
Because getting people to pay $10 a 
month for access to music just generates 
more revenue than advertising-supported 
free streaming of the sort you see with 
YouTube and Spotify. 
Probably some of the confusion 
you see comes from Spotify, which is 
a paid service that also has a free [ad-
supported] tier. The industry likes where 
things are going with the paid version. 
They’re not so happy about the free tier. 
That’s been a big sticking point for a 
few years. That’s why folks like Taylor 
Swift are critical of Spotify. But from the 
industry standpoint, it’s quite a different 
thing because one generates more money 
than the other, and I think there’s a 
growing restlessness on the part of the 
music industry to close what they call

artists for expanding fan bases. Has the 
playlist taken on increased importance? 
JT
: For sure. As these platforms 
have grown and they’ve each put 
more and more emphasis on curation 
and building playlists, you end up with 
a situation where you have millions of 
people listening to some of these playlists. 
In a lot of ways, it’s kind of like the new 
radio in a sense. I mean radio is still radio, 
but this is a lot easier to penetrate. If 
you’re an artist at almost any level, if 
your music is on the service and comes 
across the radar of the person building 
the playlist or the algorithm building the 
playlist with something like Discover 
Weekly [on Spotify], then all of a sudden 
you can find yourself alongside much 
more recognizable names and getting a 
really substantial boost in exposure. 
I’ve talked to artists who have come 
out with a new album and a song lands 
on some genre-appropriate playlist or 
mood-appropriate playlist even—there are 
so many ways to divvy these things up—
but they see enormous activity suddenly 
around their catalog. So it’s become a 
major force. It’s now like pitching the 
playlist at Spotify has almost become like 
the new version of sending your demo 
tape into the radio station. It’s just that in 
this case, it’s much more likely to get on 
one of these playlists.
I remember talking to Troy Carter at 
Spotify about this. The odds of landing 
on one of these playlists is much greater 
because there are so many of them, and 
they’re divided up in so many ways, by 
genre, by era, by mood, by all kinds 
of things, or, again, by algorithm, by 
collaborative filtering, by people who like 
similar things and this logic, it makes 
sense it’s more accessible than radio. 
It might not have the same impact as 
getting your song on a Top 40 radio 
station, but it will get your music in 
the ears of roughly the right people, 
depending on the playlist. It obviously has 
the attention of the labels and the artists. 
I think they’re seeing now that if they 
land on one of these playlists, it really 
does pay off. ■
a device in your pocket at all times or you 
might have a car that can connect to these 
services, but there’s just something about 
having it in your home. This is something 
that Sonos has kind of been angling at for 
quite some time. And it has responded 
to the popularity of the Echo, as well, by 
kind of, like everyone else, working to 
add Alexa voice control into its speakers. 
These things are taking off, it seems 
pretty quickly, and I can imagine that if 
we reach a point where it’s a mainstream 
thing to have this smart connected 
speaker in one or multiple rooms of 
your house for people who may not have 
considered it before, it makes a lot more 
sense to pay a monthly fee for music. It’s 
interesting, there was a book that came 
out like 13 years ago called “The Future 
Of Music.” They called it a “manifesto 
for a digital music revolution.” That was 
back in 2005, sort of before you even had 
the iPhone or Spotify or anything. They 
talked about the concept of music like 
water, or basically a utility you paid for. 
At the time, it sounded sort of like science 
fiction, but that’s exactly where things 
seem to be headed. 
Q
: Another interesting trend is that 
playlists are becoming increasingly 
important to consumers for discovering 
music and to the music labels and 
Q
: You’ve mentioned the idea 
of people regarding music as 
a “utility.” You’ve also written about 
the impact that smart home digital 
assistants/speakers could have on music 
streaming. Will devices like the Amazon 
Echo lead more people to view music as 
a monthly utility they’re willing to pay? 
JT
: I haven’t seen data on this, but 
you have to imagine that with the 
pretty substantial success of the Echo and 
other Alexa-enabled products—then the 
rush among the competitors to launch 
often quite similar-looking products like 
Google Home, and then there are rumors 
that Apple is working on one—this whole 
idea of this AI-fueled, personal-assistant, 
smart speaker is a category that I don’t 
think most of us really imagined as existing 
or even really wanting a couple of years 
ago. But it’s here, and it seems to be huge. 
I think if you look at the success of 
those things—Amazon isn’t totally open 
about its numbers—that they’re doing 
well. Once you have a device in your 
home that enables you to very, very 
seamlessly, without a screen and without 
even that much thought, to start piping 
music into a room, the whole idea of 
music as a utility starts to make a lot 
more sense. I mean it makes a certain 
amount of sense, too, that when you have 
It might not have the same 
impact as getting your song 
on a Top 40 radio station, but 
it will get your music in the ears 
of roughly the right people, 
depending on the playlist.

Q&A With Andreas Rudnicki
Alphacool’s CEO 
On The Eisbaer Cooler Series
connectors and bring them to a level 
where we ourselves were satisfied with 
them. We also wanted to complete 
the development of our new CPU 
waterblock in order to incorporate its 
improved technology into the Eisbaer. 
The XPX Eisblock is currently the most 
powerful CPU DIY waterblock on the 
market. Furthermore, the spread of 
cheap steel or aluminium radiators is 
still a thorn in our side. We have always 
stood firmly by our full-copper radiators, 
which perform substantially better and 
have no corrosion issues that would need 
to be prevented with lots of chemicals.
Q
: We’d like to know more about 
the Eisbaer coolers’ quick-release 
mechanism; why did you add that, and 
what do you envision Eisbaer users 
doing with it?
is available separately as well as in the 
AIOs from be quiet! and Fractal Design. 
This pump is one of the quietest on 
the market.
Q
: What made this the right time 
for Alphacool to introduce an all-
in-one CPU liquid cooler?
AR
: We first wanted to optimize 
our pump and quick-lock 
Q
: So, Alphacool just launched the 
Eisbaer family of all-in-one CPU 
coolers, with four models. How did you 
pick the name? “Eisbaer” translates to 
“ice bear,” right?
AR
: The name “Eis” (“Ice”) denotes 
our high-end product series. 
At this point, we have whole product 
families under the name. Connectors, 
HardTubes, pumps, reservoirs, and much 
more. Everything starts with “Eis.” An 
“Eisbär” (polar bear) is an emblem of the 
North and stands for power, cold, and 
endurance. We’ve found that this fits our 
AIO coolers very well, since they have all 
these characteristics. A perfect name for 
a strong product.  
Q
: Obviously there are a lot of closed-
loop CPU liquid coolers on the 
market. What did Alphacool do with 
this latest line of coolers to make them 
stand apart?
AR
: We have a truly integrated 
reservoir which is also refillable. 
We use classic 11/8mm connectors with 
the standard G1/4-inch threads normally 
used in the DIY world instead of cheaper 
custom connectors. We have also 
developed a unique new pump, which 
“. . . the spread of cheap 
steel or aluminum radiators 
is still a thorn in our side.”

are made of copper in our NexXxoS 
radiators. That is the biggest and most 
important difference between us and all 
other brands worldwide. 
Q
: Thanks for your time, Andreas! 
Is there anything else you’d like 
readers to know about Alphacool’s 
Eisbaer cooler family?
AR
: We will be adding more 
models to the Eisbaer family. 
Next in line are additional radiator 
models, such as the simple 140mm 
radiator and the mighty 420mm 
radiator. We are also developing the 
Eiswand (ice wall): an external radiator 
with a 360mm radiator, six fans, and 
including the XP3 CPU waterblock, 
hoses, coolant, and of course the quick-
lock connectors. So the Eiswand can 
also be easily expanded with our new 
products. Or, it can be used as a stand-
alone CPU cooler in Quiet or Power 
mode. Just wait and see, and thank you 
for an enjoyable interview. ■
AR
: Of course, that’s the whole 
idea behind everything. It’s 
why we’re already offering the first 
true AIO solution for graphics cards, 
the Alphacool Eiswolf GPX-Pro. It 
also includes a pump and has already 
been optimized for graphics cards 
with HBM. Like always, we’ve used 
normal G1/4-inch connectors, which is 
especially important here since we also 
offer the Eiswolf without a radiator, just 
like the Eisbaer. The pre-filled radiators 
we’ve already mentioned. 
Q
: Many of our readers are familiar 
with Alphacool radiators, but for 
those who might not be, what can you tell 
us about the NexXxoS radiators that are 
part of the Eisbaer coolers?
AR
: We are the only company 
worldwide with real, full-
copper radiators. Our competitors are 
using zinc, steel, or brass for the water 
channels or the pre-chambers. All 
parts that come in contact with water 
AR
: We wanted to build a bridge 
between purely AIO and DIY 
users. Often, users are scared of the 
assembly and filling of a DIY system but 
are generally interested in the topic. We 
want to give these users the opportunity 
to enter the world of DIY water cooling 
in small steps. The Eisbaer was the start; 
our expandable GPU AIO Eiswolf was 
the second step. Now, we also offer pre-
filled radiators. Further components are in 
the planning stages. This way, every user 
can easily build a complete watercooling 
system without needing to come into 
contact with the water directly. That’s what 
we want to see with our users: the gradual 
assembly of a complete water-cooling 
system where everything can be connected 
easily with quick-lock connectors.
Q
: Do you plan to release additional 
cooling parts at some point that 
users can add to their Eisbaer coolers 
if they expand their systems or just 
want to extend liquid cooling to 
other components?
The Alphacool Eisbaer 360.
