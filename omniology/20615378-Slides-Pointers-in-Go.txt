Pointers - 1
●
The Computer Memory (RAM) can be thought of as a sequence of boxes or cells, placed 
one after another in a line. Each cell is labeled with a unique number, which increments 
sequentially; this number is the address of the cell or its memory location.
●
Each cell holds a single value. Everything the CPU does is fetching and storing values 
into memory cells.

What is a variable? 
 A variable is just a convenient, alphanumeric nickname or label for a memory location.
When we write var a int = 5 we create a label called a for a memory location where the 
value 5 of type int will be stored.
In a nutshell: memory is just a series of numbered cells, and variables are just nicknames 
for memory locations assigned by the compiler.
●
What is a pointer?
A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. 
The pointer points to memory address of a variable, just as a variable represents the 
memory address of a value.
A pointer value is the address of a variable or nil if it hasn’t been initialized yet.

In the above image, variable b has value 201 and is stored at memory address 
0xAA01BB10. The variable a holds the address of b. Now a is said to point to b or a is a 
pointer to b. 
●
Pointers have the power to mutate or change the data they are pointing to. 
●
Unlike C, Go has no pointer arithmetic.
