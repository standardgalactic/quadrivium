Wireless Security Protocols

• No Security (Open Authentication)
• Any client can connect 
Wireless Security Protocols
(Open)

• This is NOT a security features
• SSID not sent in broadcast beacons
• Prevents normal users from not seeing SSID
• Packet sniffer in monitor mode can scan for 
probe requests
• Netstumbler, Kismet etc. can all uncover 
hidden ideas with basic scans
Wireless Security Protocols
(Hiding SSID)

• NOT Secure! – Introduced in 1999
• 40 or 104 bit key length (easily cracked)
• Based on RC4 with known weaknesses
• Shared keys (1 key for all) – no session keys
• Weak IV (24 bit) – reused frequently
• Need to collect enough IVs 
• No data integrity protection 
• Crack-able within a few minutes
• Still in use in development countries
Wireless Security Protocols
(WEP – Wired Equivalent Privacy)

• Introduced in 2003
• Enhancements to crypto (256 bit key) & auth 
• TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol)
• TKIP generates unique encryption keys for 
each data packet
• MIC (Message Integrity Check) – Anti tamper
• Supports EAP / Radius 
• Also supports PSK 
• Security depends on passphrase in PSK
• Inherits some weaknesses of WEP
• Subject to dictionary / rainbow table attacks
Wireless Security Protocols
(WPA – Wi-Fi Protected Access)

• Firmware update from WEP was easy – no 
new hardware was required 
• Encr. key mixing (keys derived from PSK)
• Message Integrity Check (MIC)
• Per-packet key derivation
• Replay attack protection
• Still relatively weak crypto 
• Not recommended to be used
Wireless Security Protocols
(WPA – Wi-Fi Protected Access)

• Introduced in 2004
• aka 802.11i
• WPA2-PSK and WPA2-EAP (Enterprise)
• CCMP (Counter Mode Cipher Block 
Chaining) – based on AES
• CCMP requires new hardware / chipset
• Difficult to spot crypto patterns 
• Incorporates 802.1x auth framework
• Backward compatible (mixed mode)
Wireless Security Protocols
(WPA2 – Wi-Fi Protected Access 2)

• Pairwise Master Key (PMK) creates Pairwise 
Transient Key (PTK)
• Password and SSID are combined to create 
master key
• Defeats rainbow table attacks
• Still vulnerable to various attacks (capture 
hash, PMKID)
• KRACK (Key Reinstallation Attack) is a threat 
(malicious network and force victim to 
connect)
Wireless Security Protocols
(WPA2 – Wi-Fi Protected Access 2)

• Introduced in 2018
• Not widely adopted yet
• New protocols to avoid using passwords
• More secure handshake 
• Stronger brute force protection
Wireless Security Protocols
(WPA3 – Wi-Fi Protected Access 3)
