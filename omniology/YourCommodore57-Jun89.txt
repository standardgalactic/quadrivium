here goes. From MDS o f
Hemel Hempstead comes
the M D P S  750 printer
stand. Of all the peripherals,
printers seem to cause the
most positional headaches,
but this new stand could
solve all your problems
(although the £204 price tag
may put you off). It is, and
I quote "uniquely designed
to achieve maximum efﬁ-
ciency, and part of a com-
prehensive modular desk
system which measures
750mm wide, 710mm high
and 750mm deep, hs an 18
inch cut-out i n  the top,
making the unit suitable for
both top and bottom feed

point is the electronic cable

Hit The Jackpot At
The Commodore
Show!
ommodore are giving
away E,500 worth o f
computer equipment to the
Amiga user with the most
innovative and unusual use
for his machine. A  nation-
wide search h a s  been
launched t o  discover as
many weird and wonderful
applications for the Amiga
as possible, and entrants will
be judged b y a  panel o f
experts at the Commodore
Computer Show, which
opens at the Novotel, Ham-
mersmith on June 2,
The show itself has been
revamped b y  Database
Exhibitions, and will now
include seminars on making
music, graphics, Commo-
dore magazines (including,
of course, I T )  and game
writing. 'Beat The Author'
competitions a r e  a l s o
planned, in which punters
will be able to  take o n
'named' authors and try to
beat them at their own game.
But one of the big highlights
of the show will undoubtedly
be t h e  i n n o v a t i o n
competition.
Commodore has already
discovered a wide variety of
uses for the Amiga, from
bird-watching to betting on
horses, and has even heard
of one user who works out
menus fo r reptiles on his
machine! I f  you think you
can match these innovative
applications, all you need to
do is write a brief description
— no more than 500 words
and send it in, along with
any necessary support mate-
rial on disk, to:

Your chance to air your views in
Your Commodore
I have just received a Com-
modore PET 3032 Com-
puter from a friend. With it
was a 8050 Disk Drive and
4022(P) Printer. I  was
wondering if you or any of
your readers had any in-
formation on software avail-
ability. Please send any in-
formation to me, thank you.
R.M. Crock, 29 Grange
Road, Bromley Cross, Bol-
ton, BL7 9AU
I was recently given a PET
8032, a 8050 Dual Drive
and a 4023 Printer together
with fo u r good software
packages complete w i th
manuals and dongles, where
necessary. I only want to use
the PET for word processing,
and so I am sending out an
appeal. Is there anyone out
there that has a program for
the 8032 that they don't
want? If so, please contact
me at my address. Thank
YOU.

Come on now everyone. we
know these a r e  p re tty
ancient machines, but there
must be someone out there
who can help!
Dear YC
I  s there anything that can
be done with old printer
ribbons? I  feel that it's a
great waste to throw them
away.
Could one possibly rev-
italise them with ink in some
way? If so, which ink should
be used, or can I send them
somewhere to be done?
J. Osborn, Luton. Beds
Our reply
The answer, John, is yes.
Printer ribbons can be re-
inked. I f  you get a copy of
Micro Computer Mart, you
will ﬁnd a ﬁrm advertising
this service every week.

Dear YC
W
I have had some load-
ing problems. The fault lies
not with yourselves, but
rather with the newsagents,
when they stack magazines
on top of each other. I have
found that 'Validating' the
disk beforehand seems to
cure this problem.
I don't know what pro-
portion o f  failures a re
returned, but this Tip may
help in some way.
J.F. Paddock Wood, Ton-
bridge, Kent
Our reply
Thanks for this helpful little
tip. We  do get some re-
turned disks, and many o f
them are cured by this simple
method.
Unfortunately, news-
agents and booksellers do
not realise how delicate disks
are.

YOUR COMMODORE june 1989

Dear YC
I have been computing ever
since the Commodore 64
was ﬁrst produced. In this
time I have bought various
computer magazines, mostly
multi-format, a n d  I ' v e
noticed various discrepan-
cies between reviews of the
same game. Fo r instance,
Tetris received 50 out of 100
from one, but 97.5 from
another.
The trouble with two
completely different results
is which one do I believe? Do
take the advice of magazine
A and stay clear of it, or do
I take B's advice and sell my
TV so that I can buy it?
The best advice f o r
anyone is to try and get into
the reviewer's mind. Some
reviewers set their hopes too
high, and so i f  a  game
doesn't come up to their ex-
pectations, they give i t a
poor write up.
A recent review of Thun-
derbiade is a good example
of this. One reviewer of this
game said -  "The graphics
at this point, Level I stage
I, were very disappointing -
the buildings are just stacked
squares".
Personally, I  think the
graphics are very good.
Okay, the ﬁrst stage on each
level is blocky, but you can't
really expect hi-res graphics
can you? It would be much
too slow. Anyway, you've
always got stages 2 and 3 in
each level to make up for it.
Another annoying item
is 'Moaning'. You know the
kind o f  thing -  "The Q
button doesn't work, so you
have to use the F7 key". A
great example of this can be
found in the same review of
Thunderblade. The reviewer
said 'Unfortunately, i t  is
hard to ﬁnd any difference
between cannon and air-to-
ground rockets.' There are
two possible reasons for this
- (A) His/ Her cassette deck/
disk drive was faulty or (B)
their copy of the game was
faulty. These are the only
possibilities, as my copy of
the game is the opposite.
In conclusion then, what
do you do i f two reviews
differ? The ﬁrst option is to
see if you can have a demon-
stration o f  the program,
therefore allowing you to
make up your own mind.
The second option is to
simply take a chance.
N. Kingsley, Chichester,
West Sussex
Our reply
Thanks J r  such a long and
'critical' letter. However, I
think you're missing the
point (as do a lot of people).
Reviewers o f  software do
not differ from any other
form of reviewer, be it Films,
Videos, Records, Food,
Clothes Etc Etc.
The whole point here is
this - the comments passed
are the comments o f  that
particular person, NOT the
comments of a 'professional
critic'. For example, I  per-
sonally have never liked
Elite, b u t fo r 1,5 million
other users it is the best pro-
gram ever.
Likewise, fo r me Info-
corn are the only people that
produce decent adventures,
but 1 bet thousands ofpeople
would not agree. Basically,
one must remember that a
reviewer's comments are his
own personal comments. A
review only really tells you
what the objective is and
how the game plays. There
is only one person that can
say whether it is good or bad,
and that is you.

Britain's brightest event for Commodore
computer users is back! And there's more to
see than ever before.
This show has three main themes covering some
of the major uses to which Commodore machines
are put. There are over 70 key companies who will be
exhibiting their latest products, which means that
just about everything that's new in the Commodore
world will be on show!
Business
Many companies will be demonstrating their latest
software and hardware, specially designed to release
the full business potential of Commodore computers.
As well as products for the C64 and Amiga series,
you'll be able to try Otil applications for the price-
beating Commodore PC compatible micros.
And you'll also be able to attend seminars covering
all aspects of using Commodore micros in your
business.
Leisure
The C64 and Amiga computers are the most powerful
8 and 16 bit micros for producing fast-action arcade
quality games. The range of new software on show

tinually being stretched, producing faster and even
more addictive games with superb graphics.
If you're a keen game player, you'll ﬁnd there's so
much on offer at the show you're guaranteed a real
treat!
Education
Commodore micros are now used as educational
tools all over the country. With the development of
BBC Basic on the Amiga, and the advent of Desktop
Video (combining TV pictures with text and
graphicsh the range of educational applications is
endless.
At the show you'll see how the latest software

cational sector, and be able to tri them out for
yourself.
Special Events
As well as special events and presentations, you'll
also be able to meet some of your favourite celeb-
rities, and maybe get a chance to talk with them
about how they use micros in their work.
So for a great day out, whether you want to see
what the future holds for Commodore computers, to
boy the latest software or to get advice on speciﬁc
applications, the Commodore show is the place to
go. And if you send in the coupon today, well knock

more of a trauma than it need
be. A t Your Commodore, we
are aware that sometimes the process
seems difﬁcult o r even nonsensical.
Our Listings w i th  their Syntax
Checker and special codings may ease
the way, but sometimes more support
is required.
Many programs are listed i n
several parts and each part uses the
same line numbers. 1-low is this
possible and how do you set about
typing them in?
First of all it should be explained
that a set of these programs form a
suite which operate in unison. The way
to use them is to type in the ﬁrst
program and save i t .  N o w  th e
computer should b e  cleared b y
entering NEW or even by switching
the computer off and on.
Proceeding to the second listing,
the program is again typed in and
saved. If you're storing the programs
on tape, you should ensure that this
program is saved immediately after the
ﬁrst one. For disk users, i t doesn't
matter where it's saved as long as it's

on the same disk as the ﬁrst program.
After checking that all has been saved
safely, the machine is again refreshed
using NEW or the power switch.
Any subsequent programs should
be treated in the same way as the
second listing and the result will be
a string o f programs. One word o f
caution which should be heeded is that
the programs should be saved under
the name given in Your Commodore
because each program occasionally
uses one of these names to load in the
next program in the string.
Suite Confusion
One question which we're often asked
is why these multipart programs are
needed. The answer is that they are
a memory-saving o r  time-saving
measure.
Many programs use redeﬁned
characters, machine code patches and
sprites. The information for this has
to be poked into position because they
rarely occupy memory locations which
Basic uses. This difﬁculty can be
overcome in either of two ways.

The data can be poked i n to
position each time the program is
loaded and forms an integral part of
the program. This has the dual
disadvantage of the time the program
takes to move the data in but, more
importantly, reduces the amount o f
space for the master program itself.
Another way of achieving the same
result is to  use a  series o f set-up
programs before the main program is
loaded. The set-ups are loaded and run
in t u r n  a n d  e a ch  o n e  pokes
information into memory where i t
cannot be touched by any subsequent
loading actions. Consequently, once
the program has done its job it is no
longer needed and the program can
even be removed by typing in NEW
without ruining the effect of the main
program when it is eventually loaded.
One thing that you cannot do is
to switch the computer off and on
again! This action totally clears the
memory, including the data which has
been poked in.
When the ﬁrst program has done
its job, the next program is loaded
normally and run. Now there are two
•

blocks of data locked away safely. This
continues until the ﬁnal program is
loaded. This is the main program
which holds the key to unlocking and
using the data which the previous
programs positioned. The fact that
each o f  the programs may have
contained the same line numbers is
totally irrelevant because it's what each
program does and not how it does it.
It's a little like receiving a birthday card
and an electricity bill - they both carry
the same address but the effect they
have on the mind is totally different!

Although this system solves the
problem of memory space, it does not
save time and a long program can seem
to take forever to poke the data into
position. One way to overcome this
is to create a program which not only
pokes the data into position, but also
saves the pure data block afterwards.
These throwaway programs, o r
Basic loaders to give them their correct
name, are quite common and need
treating separately. The process can be

quite complicated so we'll take the case
of a single program ﬁrst.
As usual, the program is typed in
and saved before running it. Next a
new tape or disk should be placed in
the storage device. Now when the
program runs it will save the data back
onto the new tape but in a different
form. The new program will be loaded
directly into memory without the need
for a Basic program to poke it there.
These programs usually have to be
started with a  SYS command and,
once checked, the program that was
originally typed in can be forgotten
and erased.
The Basic program is rather like
a gift box which becomes useless once
the contents have been removed.
A program of this kind which is
separated into parts is immediately
recognisable because the master
program is the ﬁrst in the chain. I f
this is in Basic it should be typed in
and saved. I f  it is a Basic loader it
must be treated differently.
Spot The Loader
A Basic loader can be recognised by

the reams of DATA statements which
must be typed in. Another indicator
• is the shortness of the actual program,
excluding the D A TA  statements,
which o fte n  o n l y  contains a
FOR...NEXT loop separated b y
complex POKE commands.
If the main program proves to be
a Basic loader it should be typed in
and saved but when it is run a separate
disk or tape should be already in the
save device.
After dealing w i th  th e  main
program, any subsequent parts should
be typed in and this version saved to
the ﬁrst tape or disk. On running, the
resultant program should be saved on
the second tape immediately after the
preceeding part.
Basically, the rule to remember is
that a n y programs which have
duplicated line numbers cannot reside
in memory at the same time. They
should b e  typed i n  a n d  saved
separately a cco rd i n g  t o  t h e
instructions given in the relevant Your
Commodore article o r  the R EM
statements in the listings themselves.
Stick to this rule and you'll never go
wrong.. .well, rarely!

NEW TECHNOLOGY
The Case of the
Electronic Home
olmes, I've got a  letter
here from a  distraught
magazine editor asking us
to investigate the future o f  the
electronic house, but I don't know how
to go about the job,' 'Well Watson,
you can always pop down to  the
furniture exhibition at Earl's Court
and see what's new.' 'That's Ideal
Holmes!' (Oh God Ed).
So i t was that our two intrepid
detectives went off in search of clues
as to how long i t would be before
everything i n  the house could be
operated at the ﬂick of a switch.
When they arrived at the show
though. they were in for something of
a surprise. Whereas even a couple of
years before, every machine was being
heavily promoted as the all singing,
all dancing model with more lights and
buttons than you knew what to do
with, this year's displays were much
more minimalist in design. It was as
if it was assumed that the machine
could do everything that was asked of'
it, and it was simply left at that.
'There are two distinct problems
here' said Holmes. 'To start with, you
will notice that just about every
machine, from cameras to  washing
machines, has chips in it, which in turn
gives the end user access to a plethora
of functions. B u t  although th e
customer may appreciate having all
these extra facilities, he doesn't
actually use many of them, After all,
just about every single compact disc
player lets you program the tracks in
any order that you want. But who in
their right mind is going to mess about
with the order of the movements in
a Mozart symphony?'
'The second problem i s th a t
nothing is compatible unless you stick
to just one manufacturer. So  the
customer ends up with separate remote
control handsets fo r his television,
video and hi-ﬁ. None of them will turn
on his dishwasher, and he can only
use them over a limited range. What
is needed is some all-powerful control
system.
Leaving aside his relentless search for the dreaded
Moriarty, Mr Sherlock Holmes and his old friend Dr
Watson visit the Ideal Homes exhibition and discover
that 221 B Baker Street is not all that it should be_
'I notice that all the display houses
have a  study' commented Watson.
'The idea of people working more and
more from home persists, even though
there is little evidence to suggest that
it is actually happening. It seems that
computers are still regarded as toys
unless they possess those three magic
letters - IBM. Modems still have not
caught o n  as they have done i n

America. Instead, no home should be
without its own personal fax machine.'
we are not very careful Watson,
you and I could soon be out of a job.
The one major area of expansion in
the electronic ﬁeld i s i n  security
systems. I see that Modern Alarms are
offering a  wire-free programmable
system -  easy to install, no messing
up the decoration, and it can be taken

1
with you when you move. And every
type o f alarm imaginable is here --
magnetic contacts, heat, radar, sound,
vibration, breaking glass, infra red
beams and close circuit wiring. There
are even personal alarm buttons.'
'How is the enterprising burglar
supposed to get past that little lot, and
if there are no criminals, then what
are we to do? Ah, here is something
that would fool even me. A machine
that emits artiﬁcial barking noises.
Remember that ease of the dog that
didn't bark in the night?' This device
would have totally messed up that
story.'
'I can ﬁnd no trace of robotics here
Holmes. It looks as i f we will have
to p u t  u p  w i th  M r s  Hudson's
housekeeping for at least another year.
This is one ﬁeld that has deﬁnitely not
progressed as quickly as everybody
anticipated, although I  still hear
rumours that two of the biggest fast
food chains are battling to be the ﬁrst
NEW TE C H N O LO G Y
YOUR COMMODORE june 1989
15

to get their customers served b y
automatons.'
'At last. Watson, I think that we
have found what we were looking for,
A system that will control every
domestic appliance in the house and
which can be operated either from the
central processing unit, from a handset
or, more importantly, via a telephone
link. Just think of i t Being able to
phone home if we are out on a case
and instruct the video to  record
Crimewatch and Police 5:
'I see that the system - Credanet
from Creda -  works by means of a
series of transceivers placed in every
appliance. It then communicates with
the central processing unit using
existing mains circuitry. This c.p.u. has
a large display panel as well, so that
you keep addresses and diary dates as
well as being able to check up on share
prices and train times. That would
have been useful in the Baskerville
case.'
'We would be able to control the
temperature i n  every room i n  the
house, varying it as and when we saw
ﬁt. Lighting could b e  similarly
controlled, ranging from individual
lamps upwards. Imagine being able to
turn out the kitchen light from your
bed when you had forgotten to do so,
All your aforementioned security
devices could be checked easily,
although it would lessen the impact
of my detective powers i f  I  knew
beforehand exactly who had turned up
at my front door.'
'Turning on the cooker, doing the
washing in the middle of the night and
arranging for records of my beloved
violin music to start playing as soon
as I walked through the door. And all
available in the next couple of years
for about a thousand pounds.'
'This has got to be the way forward,
eh Watson? This is where the future
of the electronic house lies. It doesn't
matter what make of appliances you've
got - they can all be controlled from
the one system. I would guess that we
will be hearing of many more such
control systems in the next few years,
each offering more and more features
and with the price coming down all
the time.'
'There's only one thing left for us
to investigate now Watson, and that
is to ﬁnd out what is on the other side
of that yellow door.' What's so special
about the yellow door Holmes?' 'It's
a lemon entry my dear Watson!'(Have
mercy, Hamlett, no more please - a
distraught Ed).

Returner
Return to the menu al any time with this ingenious
program
T
of what's on your disk was
addressed in Commodore Disk
User Vol I ,  No 2 (Jan/ Feb 88) by
Menu Maker. This useful utility
allowed you to  load any program
direct from the Menu, but to return
to MENU you had to add the load
statement to each program on the ﬁle,
which is easy enough to do, but usually
means putting check questions in and
having to end the running up of the
program. You could also do i t by
pressing Run Stop and reloading
"Menu", but that's rather a waste of
time.
The program Returner allows you
to leave a program at any point or
time, and return to the menu to select
an alternative program without all the
problems outlined above.
On loading and activating the 'RE-
TURNER' program code, the ﬁrst job
that it does is to set up the 'RESTORE'
key, and automatically load a MENU.
Obviously, fo r the program to
work correctly, you must have a
'MENU' program on your disk. We
have published quite a few such pro-
grams in the past. Alternatively, you
could write one of your own. To get
the best results, it is advisable to have
at least two, i f not more, programs
on your menu.
Once you have your menu pro-
gram running, yu select which pro-
gram you want as normal. On running
the selected program, you can press
the 'RESTORE' key at any time to
return to your MENU program.
If the returner won't
work
'There are two reasons why Returner
may not work:
I. The program in memory is using the
NMI interrupt, or it is restoring the
interrupt vectors to normal values.
You need to alter your program (if
possible) so that it's not using the
NMI interrupt.
C64 PRO G RAMMING
N.B. The NMI interrupt values are
located at 792-793 ($318-$319).
2.The me mo ry location where
'Returner' is located is being used
by the program being run, See
solution below.
Program checker
This program will provide you with
alternative memory locations to hold
the 'Returner' program. L o a d
"CHECKER",8 & run. This will give
the following instructions on screen.
First Type in N
Then Load Menu, Load A  File, &
Reset
Load Menu, Load Another File. Reset
Repeat Until all Files Loaded
Load Checker & Type Y
Have You Wiped Before?
When running, 'Checker' will show
a blank screen until processing is com-
plete. This will take approximately
three minutes and then show on the
screen:
Ready
Load "Menu",8
Press Return. Run the menu, then
load ﬁrst ﬁle, then reset computer by
pressing R UNSTOP & RESTORE (or
by using a Reset cartridge) Do not
switch the computer off & on,
Reload the menu, run the next
program, then reset as before and
continue until all ﬁles have been
loaded. Once all the programs on the
disk h a v e  b e e n  r u n ,  re l o a d
CHECKER, run, and type in Y to the
question.
Option is given to output to printer
as well as screen. The result o f the
program is a  list o f free memory
positions available for insertion of the
program Returner. You can select the
desired position to place Returner (if
no space available it will tell you so,
i.e. Returner cannot be accommodated
on that disk.)

To change the position of returner
in memory
Load "EDIT",8 and run
The screen will ask for the new start
address. You can enter it in Hex or
Decimal numbers (th e  Checker
program provides location values in
decimal).
Once entered, press return.
The screen will then ask you to
state which ﬁle you want to  be
automatically loaded when you press
the RESTORE key. I f  not MENU,
then alter to your own requirements
press Return.
The screen will then ask what name
you wish t o  give th e  Returner
program. Put your own name in. The
screen will then ask "Are You Sure?"

Returner
Amm,

- if not, type N, i f you are, type Y.
N returns you to the beginning of the
screen, and you will have to re-input
memory location etc. When you type
Y, i t  will save the newly-named
program to disk.
Starting up yOur
computer
When you start up your computer, you
initially load and run the program you
named and saved above, It will auto-
matially install the RESTORE key
function and run the program you
asked to be ﬁrst loaded (see above).

I recommend that it is the menu as
pressing the RESTORE key will
automatically return you to  this
program u n ti l  th e  computer i s
switched off.
Note: A  good place to  p u t the
'Restorer' program in memory is 820
($334), as it is not normally used when
using disk. It relates to the tape drive
use, so you won't be able to use the
tape drive.
If you have a  multipart game,

Addition to Returner
instructions
It is n o t recommended to  press
RESTORE during the use of the disk
drive or printer, as the menu may not
work properly if you do so.
If you need to press RESTORE
while the printer or disk is in use and
the menu doesn't work properly, then
just press RESTORE again and the
menu should work properly.

Despite its name,
this is a compiler with
several very interesting
extras
By Norman Doyle
T
suite of four programs designed
to get the best from Basic and
beyond. The main part of the program
is a  stunning compiler but, before
using this section, the program has to
be optimised.
At the beginning o f the whole
process, a good set of utilities can speed
things up and keep it all neat. Oxford
Basic's Toolkit ﬁts into the high
memory slot at 49152, and offers ten
new commands which are outlined
elsewhere.
One glaring omission is an auto-
matic line-numbering command, and
another is a command to undo the
execution of a NEW or a recover a
program after a reset. It's only my
opinion o f course, but to me these
missing commands would have en-
hanced an otherwise comprehensive
package.
Vital Statistics
The Analyzer really gets inside a
program and squeezes Out every
possible value and measurement that
the programmers could think about.
It takes a little time for the program
to be read in, but the wait is worth-
while, because there are seven options
available for analysis afterwards.
A Flow Cross-Reference revealed
the following facts about the program:

The ﬁrst number in the GOSUB
section is the line that is accessed and
the line numbers that follow are the
lines which call up the routine.
When a Data Cross-Reference is
called, the variables are listed, followed
by the line numbers where they appear:
I M P  V A R I A B L E S - -
YOUR COMMODORE june 1989

As a program is developed, it's easy
to forget to delete lines which are no
longer needed. The Deadwood Anal-
ysis cleverly scans through the pro-
gram to ﬁnd lines that will never be
accessed. The offending lines are then
listed, and a  deadwood-free listing
generated if required.
Another improvement can be made
through the Create Header File op-
tion, which generates a short program
to initialise all of the variables used
in the program. The ﬁle is then saved
and can be MERGEd with the main
body of the program later using the
Toolkit. Initialisation may seem as
redundant as the LET command, but
it can actually improve the speed at
which the program operates.
When a variable is encountered in
a program, the computer checks
through the list of existing variables
to see i f  it's a  new entry, o r  a
modiﬁcation of an existing one. If the
label proves to be a new one, i t is
tagged onto the end o f the current
variable list. This involves a substantial
degree of memory movement and con-
sequently wastes time.
Added to this, a variable which is
commonly used may be at the end of
the list, which means that the routine
has to check through the full list before
the current value o f  the desired
variable is discovered. The generated
header program avoith these time
wasters by reserving space for the
variables i n  descending order o f
frequency right at the beginning of the
program.
A list of program statistics can be
displayed so that memory and variable
usage can be recorded. The Generate
Stats option also summarises other
facts such as the number of lines used,
GOTOs and GOSUBs as well as the
total number of variables and arrays.

There is also a menu option for
checking the disk directory, and to
make sure that any ﬁles have been
successfully saved.
The reports given b y the stats
generator and the ﬂow and data cross-
reference options can be saved to disk
alongside the ﬁnished program. There
is no direct hard copy option, but a
utility ﬁle is included which will read
a stored report to the printer for future
reference.
Arranged Crush
The ﬁnal pre-compilation routine is
the Compressor, which reduces the
program to its absolute minimum sin.
As each line is scanned, the routine
removes all REMs and spaces but the
compression goes beyond this. Lines
are combined to squeeze in as many
commands onto a line as possible.
After compression, a printout of
the program may contain lines which
physically span three or more screen
lines. This is possible because the
Compressor works with raw program
code so that a  command such as
PRINT only occupies one byte rather
than ﬁve. A  line could therefore
contain as many as 38 PRINT com-
mands. which would expand to 228
characters and colons or ﬁve screen
lines! This would make editing impos-
sibly difﬁcult, so the program must be
thoroughly debugged before this
operation is performed.
Although this optimises the pro-
gram's memory usage, difﬁculties were
experienced when using the compiler
so I eventually decided that compres-
sion was probably better used o n
programs which wouldn't be improved
by compilation.
Full Speed
OX-Comp is one of the best compilers
that I've ever seen. It is a full-facility,
four pass compiler which can cope
with all of the commands in the C64's
Basic library. The program also
REVIEW
accepts all types of variables and arrays
up t o  t w o  dimensions. Three-
dimensional arrays can be compiled,
but only after the program has been
pre-processed by a special utility which
is included on the disk.
A compiler converts Basic code
into a special form of machine code
which runs up to 40 times faster than
the original program. When a Basic
program runs, the operating system
has to scan each line in turn, turn each
command into an action, and create
and modify all o f the variables i t
encounters.
A compiler scans through the Basic
program and converts all o f  the
commands and their parameters
before the program is stored on disk.
The conversion also means that suf-
ﬁcient space can be made for all of
the variables which are to be used. The
ﬁnished program is therefore midway
between Basic and pure code.
The initial compilation can take a
long time to produce, because the full
program is scanned and rescanned
four times before the ﬁnal program is
produced. During these passes, the
compiler produces and erases tempor-
ary work ﬁles which adds disk access
time onto the process. A long program
can take up to half an hour to prepare,
but the results are worth waiting for.
Wisely, the producers insist that
the master disk should be used as little
as possible, and a  special back-up
routine is included which remasters the
compiler and its associated utilities
onto separate disks. Unfortunately, the
back-up is not the most efﬁcient of
utilities, and each sub-program is
transferred individually, regardless of
whether it occupies one block or 20.
The result is a constant swapping of
disks, which makes the whole process
very laborious and unnecessarily long.
Once the copies have been made,
the compilation process is automatic,
and the program to be processed is
placed on the same disk as the copied
compiler. This can cause problems
with disk space, but this problem has
been anticipated by offering suitable
error message generation and options
to erase programs which will no longer
be required for the ﬁnal compilation
- even the original program can be
erased once compilation has pro-
gressed beyond the ﬁrst pass.
The limitations of the compiler are
surprisingly few and petty. Arrays
must be ﬁnitely dimensioned, which
means that D I M  A(23) is a  legal
statement but D IM  A(X) would be
YOUR COMMODORE june 1989
23
queried. If an array slips through to
the compiler, which lacks an explicit
dimension, the program interrupts
compilation to ask for a suitable array
size before continuing through the rest
of the program. This may limit the
efﬁciency of memory usage, but few
programs would suffer appreciably by
this insistence on explicit dimension-
ing.
The only commands that the
compiler rejects are LIST, CONT,
SAVE and RUN when it has a line
number parameter. LIST is excluded
because there is nothing to list in a
compiled program, C ON T is an
acceptable omission and most people
could live without commands such as
RUN40 when a  CLR: RESTORE:
GOT040 could be substituted instead.
SAVE is harder to live without but
this could be remedied by including
an SYS in the original program to a
suitable machine code patch.
One worrying problem which
revealed itself under testing was that
the maximum string length is 254
characters, instead of Basic's 255. This
must surely be an oversight on the part
of the programmers because it is not
documented i n  the manual. Such
errors are slightly disconcerting
because they only show up at runtime,
and I'd rather not sit with my ﬁngers
crossed while a  program compiles
hoping that another unforeseen error
occurs.
All compiled programs are exe-
cuted with the RUN/STOP key dis-
abled. In most cases this is unimpor-
tant but it may be necessary to allow
such an interruption so a special form
of REM statement has been devised
to allow the key to be enabled and
disabled.
Error Tracing
If errors occur when the compiled
program is being tested, i t can be
difﬁcult to relate the problem back to
the original program. An error which
stops the execution of the program will
generate a message which is similar to
Basic's equivalent message, but instead
of a line number a memory location
is displayed.
A utility on the disk can be given
this value, and it will then automat-
ically cross-refer this and indicate the
corresponding line number i n  the
original program to assist debugging.
Of course, such an error should rarely
occur because any sensible pro-
grammer would have tested and

debugged the original program before
compilation, wouldn't they ?
Another utility which can aid
debugging was actually devised fo r
hybrid programs which require
parameters to  be accessed b y a
machine code patch. Variables and
arrays are stored differently in the
compiled program so any associated
code routines have to  be modiﬁed.
This works in favour of routines which
access a current variable value, because
the memory location of variable data
is ﬁxed i n  a  compiled program.
REPORT is a utility which scans the
original program and prints out a table
of variable locations to  ease the
problem of conversion.
Dotty Protection
Why, in this day and age of colour
photocopiers and cameras, do soft-
ware houses insist on these ridiculous
colour charts? I don't mind protection
systems, but I  object to  this form
because I am red/green colour blind
and the companies always seem to
insist on using red, green and two other
REVIEW
colours on these charts. Why black,
white, red and yellow can't be chosen
defeats me.
In th i s case th e  problem i s
increased because each o f the four
programs is individually protected. In
the end, I  got so annoyed that I
resorted to backing up the programs
using a cartridge copier - so much for
protection!
Despite this, the package maintains
a very high standard throughout all
four sections. Maybe if the space under
the ROMs had been used, the toolkit
could have been more comprehensive
in the manual, but no compiler is
perfect and this compiler is compar-
able, though slightly inferior, to
Supersoft's Blitz. What this has to offer
which Blitz doesn't is the other three
packages which make this package
stand out against the opposition.

Improve your 64's input
with this handy utility
T
ard Basic keyword "INPUT" on
the C64 is a bit of a pain. In
the event that a comma (",") needs to
be input as part of a string "INPUT"
C64 PRO G RAMMING
cannot do it, because the comma is
interpreted as being a  delimiter
between different lots of data which
are supposed to be assigned to separate
variables.
If you wanted to enter such a string
then it has to be enclosed by quotes
so that "INPUT" will read in every
character. This looks silly on the
screen, and is very confusing for users
YOUR COMMODORE june 1989
25
of the program who are not familiar
with the technique - they can't under-
stand why some text has to be enclosed
in quotes in order to enter strings
including commas, whereas other
forms of input such as numeric data
do not. It's even more confusing when
the program later requires that the user
use the comma to separate input into
different ﬁelds!

The other slightly aggravating
thing about "INPUT" is the fact that
the "?" prompt is always printed on
the screen prior to "INPUT", waiting
for keyboard entry. This is sometimes
a nuisance, since the message which
asks for the input on the part of the
user is not always of a kind where a
question mark at the end is relevant
- that is, it's not a question. Add to
this the need to follow it with quotes
- and then rub this out and type quotes
again so you can use the cursor move
keys to edit the line j u st so a comma
can be included where required in the
input string, and straight away we
aleady have two irrelevant characters
on the screen before anything is
actually typed in.
What's more, you always forget to
use the opening quotes at the start,
which itself suggests that it doesn't feel
natural t o  have to  do this. The
situation is worse when inputting from
an external channel -  here not only
the comma but also the colon and
semi-colon are interpreted as carriage
returns, o r  the end o f  the string,
wrhereas i n  actual fact i t  may be
nothing of the sort. Again, enclosing
the string in quotes before it is saved
to the external device prevents this, but
on inputting it back the quotes will
have disappeared. I n  either case,
whether inputting from the keyboard
or an external device, quotes cannot
be included as part of the text. But
why not, you may ask?
"GET" will input anything from
the keyboard, and a string comprising
all printable characters can be built up
using "GET". But the Basic coding
required to interactively edit this string
at the same time rapidly becomes
unwieldy and slow. Also, the input is
not automatically echoed to the screen,
so this must be done in Basic. There's
no ﬂashing cursor either.
A cursor can be forced, but it has
the peculiar behaviour of leaving some
characters in inverse video as soon as
the cursor move keys are used. "GET"
can be used to input text from an
external device, b u t using Basic
commands that retrieve one character
at a time and build it into a string can
be time-consuming to say the least. It's
frustrating when all you want is input
some text of an 'unusual' format.
If you're a  machine code pro-
grammer of any skill, then this can be
got around, except that you may ﬁnd
yourself having to  re-develop the
coding to  suit the requirements o f
different programs. But i f you want
C64 PRO G RAMMING
to stay in the Basic environment, then
while 'GET" and "Input( ) "  have
their place (and are very good at what
they do), what is really needed is a
new Basic keyword, one than will input
strings of all printable characters.
Well here i t is. Inspired, as i t
happens, by the IBM PC BASIC A's
action keyword of the same name the
utility is called "LINE INPUT( ) "
and is in the form of a machine code
routine stored at WACO to SCBBD
high up in the free RAM area above
the 64's BASIC interpreter. In actual
fact, it is not a real keyword at all,
but a  "SYS" call which cheats by
pretending to be an interpreter routine.
This is necessary because of the sort
of information that the routine needs
in order to carry out its task. The
"USR" function only allows one
numeric value to be passed on to a
machine code routine, which then can
only return one other value to  a
variable. The temporary register
storages for "SYS" calls are rather
long-winded to use, and in any case
none o f these are any use because
"LINE INPUT( ) "  must return a
string in a string variable.
The simple answer is fo r  the
routine, "LINE", to get these parame-
ters direct from the current Basic line
being processed using the subroutine
"CHRGET" - which retrieves the next
BASIC byte into the accumulator, and
also incidentally is the thing that skips
spaces not in quotes - in exactly the
same way as all the interpreter routines
get their information. This makes
"LINE INPUT" very easy to program
in Basic, because i f you excuse the
presence o f the word "SYS" at the
front it will appear in the listing, and
in operation, like a valid Basic key-
word. Furthermore, i f you make a
numeric variable equal to the "SYS"
call address and name this variable
"LINE", the subterfuge will be com-
plete. The syntax then is as follows:
SYS <  a d d re ss >  I N P U T
( <  channel N o . > , )  <  string
variable >
Note the full stop between < address >
and INPUT( # ). This is very impor-
tant as it ensures that the following
valid BASIC keyword, "INPUT" or
"INPUT # ", is crunched down to its
proper BASIC token when the BASIC
line which contains i t is entered.
Neither of these will be executed by
the interpreter in the normal way.
However, they exist here exclusively
YOUR COMMODORE june 1989
26
for use b y "L IN E". I n  fact, the
processing activity o f  ''LINE" will
make whichever of these two tokens
inaccessible to the interpreter.
The keyword fo r "IN PU T" o r
"INPUT # " i s included because
"LINE" has to vector within itself to
the appropriate processing for either
inputting from the keyboard and
screen, or from an external device. The
keyword is tokenised for three reasons:
I. to save memory space, although this
will be negligible; 2. because it's a
professional way of doing it; 3. since
"LINE" uses it to ﬁnd out which form
of input is required, it simpliﬁes things
greatly if only one byte can be exam-
ined instead of a string of characters.
This token, and the remaining parame-
ters, are read by "LINE" direct from
the Basic text using "CHRGET".
A number of subroutines are used
by "LINE" to read the parameters.
They themselves get the Basic bytes
using "CH RGET". One of these is a
contrived subroutine ailed "GET-
VAL " located a t SCBA7 (52135
decimal), and looks like this:
READ E Q U  S A D 8 A
FIX

"READ" is part of a Basic interpreter
routine which pickes up a numeric
value from the Basic line currently
being processed. The value may be
written as a string of decimal numbers,
or be in the form o f a numerical
variable. Whichever, "READ" con-
verts it into ﬂoating point format and
stores in Floating Point Accumulator
tt 1.
"FIX" is the familiar 'ﬂoat to ﬁx'
interpreter routine. The contents o f
FAC I  are converted into a I6-bit
integer and stored in zero page loca-
tions $14415 hex.
Therefore "GETVAL" performs
the action of reading a numeric value
or a variable's contents from a Basic
line and making same available in
handy double-byte integer format in
S14-$15 for a machine code to use, if
"GETVAL" is handled properly. I t
helps in understanding how "LINE"
operates, that the C64's Baisc inter-
preter follows a special convention that
every interpreter routine, including
those used by "GETVAL", expects the
ﬁrst Basic byte that i t has to deal
with to  already be i n  the CPU's
accumulator. Or, to put i t another

way, every Basic interpreter routine
calls "CH RGET" to get the next byte
of Basic text into the accumulator
before it exists. Also -
little bit limited, only positive numbers
in the range 0-65535 are allowable
otherwise an "IL L EGAL  QUAN-
TITY" error is generated. Invalidly
entered numbers produce "SYNTAX
ERROR".
On calling "LINE" with the "SYS"
command, true to the convention, the
interpreter runs "CHR GET
the accumulator with the next byte of
Basic text. Unfortunately this doesn't
arrive intact when "L IN E " takes
control, because the action of execu-
tive "SYS
the contents of the 'temporary storage
for A  reg.' location at $030C (780
decimal). So the accumulator has to
be refreshed w i t h  a  called t o
"CHRGOT", a  l e tte r p a r t o f
"CHR GET" which gets the same
BASIC byte again. This byte must be
a full stop (".") or $2E, i f it is not a
jump is made to SAF08 which prints
"SYNTAX ERROR IN LINE < n >",
and terminates the Basic program. The
byte following this, retrieved b y
-
for -
neither of these again a jump is made
to "SYNTAX ERROR".
Otherwise at this point the routine
"LINE" deviates. The bulk o f  the
routine comprises two separate pro-
cesses, the one chosen depends on
whether the input is from the keyboard
and screen, or whether it is from an
external device.
LINE INPUT from keyboard and
screen
Syntax:
SYS <  address >. INPUT <  string
variable >
Example:
100 LINE = 51904
110 SYS LINEINPUT A$
Input from keyboard and screen is
carried out in three stages. Firstly the
screen RAM address for the start of
C64 PRO G RAMMING
I-IERE IT
the input is found by locating the
cursor position with the kernal routine
"PLOT", and calculating the screen
address by the rather crude method
of adding 40 to the screen base of 1024
'y' (row count) number of times. 'x'
(column count) is added to the result.
I did originally write a proper mul-
tiplication routine, but this required
so much code that i t wasn't really
worth it. The calculated address is
stored in free zero page locations as
a pointer.
All you see on the screen is a
ﬂashing cursor with no "?" prompt.
Now a kernal routine called "CHRIN"
handles all the character getting and
printing with full editing support and
proper ﬂashing cursor. In  use i t is
identical to using the Basic editor in
direct mode. It has the same limita-
tions i f  quotes are keyed then cursor
move keys come onto the screen as
characters, but rubbing out quotes and
re-keying stops this, "LINE" discovers
the length of the line. This is done by
searching backwards from the maxi-
mum string length position, the default
of which is 80, looking for a non-space
character. On  ﬁnding a  non-space
character, its position ahead o f the
start of input becomes the new string
length.
The screen line, from the start
address up to the string length, is
copied to  a buffer. This is our old
friend the cassette header buffer at
$033C. However $033C is reserved to
hold the string length count, so the
buffer actually starts a t S033D. A
conversion routine is used to translate
screen coded characters into CBM
ASCII, and the most signiﬁcant bit is
stripped off in case the screen char-
acters were inverse video ("LINE
INPUT" needn't input a line which has
just been typed, it could just as easily
have been PR1NTed instead and the
keyboard buffer POKEd with a car-
riage return).
At the end o f this the string is
stored in the buffer and its length in
$03CC. At the ﬁnal stage "LINE" calls
interpreter routines "L OC ATE",
which goes in search o f the string
variable through the variable storage
YOUR COMMODORE june 1989
27
area "L OC A TE " gets the variable's
name from the Basic line. If it does
not exist then it is created. After this
the string storage for the variable, if
already i n  existence, is freed (by
"FRESTR'") and then a fresh storage
area is deﬁned using "STR R ES" which
does so according to the new string
length passed to it. We now have a
place in the string storage area to
which the contents of the buffer can
be copied.
It is impossible for characters to
be put in this area directly (without
being stored in a buffer ﬁrst) because
"LINE" does not yet know how long
the string will be until this stage.
In this manner any string variable
can be created o r  updated using
"LINE:INPUT" in just the same way
as it can by any other INPUT function.
However some care is required where
the variable is one of a dimensioned
array. Small arrays up to a 'safe' limit
of say 10 or 11 elements would be okay,
in other words:
110 SYS LINEINPUT TS(n)
Where 'n' is an index from 0 to
10 in the default provision for arrays
up to 11 elements, but otherwise a
'working variable' such as INS fo r
example would have to be used to
transfer the input to the element where
this is one o f a large, dimensioned
array, e.g.:
110 SYS LINEINPUT INS
120 AS(n) = INS
If this precuation is not observed
the process becomes too complex for
the simpler than normal string build-
ing techniques used and usually
crashes the 64.
Whatever the string is stored in the
proper place, and the extra does not
add perceptively to  the processing
time, even if a large string array is being
ﬁlled with text.
Because "LINE" is located in RAM
it can be modiﬁed. I mentioned that
for input from keyboard and screen,
it has a default maximum string length
of 80 screen characters (two screen
lines). I t  doesn't matter i n  which
column across the screen the start of
input occurs, the maximum remains
80 characters. You can change the
maximum length by a POKE to suit
your own requirements. For example,
a disk ﬁle name cannot exceed 16
characters in length. I f  "LINE. IN -
PUT" is used to get the ﬁle name it
can ﬁrst be modiﬁed only to accept

up to a maximum of 16 characters.
In the source listing the maximum
string length is labelled "MAXLEN"
and is at SCB4D (52045). Use the
following:
100 LINE = 51904
1000 MAXLEN = 52045
1010 POKE MAXLEN, 16
1020 PR IN T "ENTER A  N AME
FOR THIS FILE";
1030 SYS LINEINPUT 1N$
1040 N M$ =
1050 OPEN 2,8,2, NM$
1060 etc.
You can type as many characters
as you like for the ﬁle name, only the
ﬁrst 16 will be taken any notice of after
you press [RETURN].
Be aware though of a couple of
limitations of "LINEINPUT". One is
the same as that o f  the normal
"INPUT", namely if other characters
present on the screen come within the
range of the maximum string length,
it will be assumed that these constitute
the end of the string, even if you don't
want them. Enough blank space must
exist beyond the position where input
commences to prevent this.
Also, "L IN E IN P U T" doesn't
know if the start of input occurs on
the bottom line of the screen. I f  the
screen scrolls up where text exceeds
one screen line, the start address is not
adjusted u p  w i t h  i t .  A l s o
"LINE,INPUT" will assume that the
'rubbish' beyond the top of the screen
RAM area are characters to be input!
Consequently "LINEINPUT" should
not be used any lower than the 24th
row down.
LINE INPUT # from an external
device -
Syntax:
SYS < address>. INPUT <  chan-
nel No. > , < string variable
Example:
100 LINE = 51094
1000 OPEN2, 8, 2, "TEXT"
1010 SYS LINEINPUT 2,A$
1020 etc.
This is the only time that "GETVAL"
is used, and even then only the least
signiﬁcant byte of the resultant integer
is needed!
"GETVAL" retrieves the channel
number following "INPUT # " so that
C64 PRO G RAMMING
kernal routines can route input from
the appropriate channel. Inputted
characters are copied to the buffer, a
process that continues in a loop until
one of three conditions are true:
1. The ST variable indicates an EOF
signal from a disk drive. On detecting
"EOF" inputting is terminated.
2. The character read in is found to
be the termination character. The
default termination character is a
carriage return (13), on encountering
the termination character inputting is
terminated. The termination character
is NOT copied to the buffer.
3. The maximum number of bytes have
been copied to the buffer. The default
maximum number of bytes is 128. On
the I28th character being copied to the
buffer, inputting is terminated.
On i n p u t being terminated,
"LINEINPUT # " goes to the ﬁnal
stage of building the string to memory
exactly as before. As far as "EOF" is
concerned, it will be required that the
BASIC p r o g r a m  u s i n g
"LINEINPUT # " should also moni-
tor the " S T "  variable. Re-using
"LINEINPUT # " and forcing input
past EDF causes a rubbish character
to be copied to the buffer, overwriting
the previous string. This is not a
problem if other variables have been
made equal to this string.
As before, because the routine
exists in RAM, it can be customised
to behave in a special way. ''CHKCR"
is a label in the source listing which
represents the point where the char-
acter read is tested to see whether it's
the termination character or not. It
looks like:
CHKCR CMP # $0D
Where the operand is the value, in this
case 13. This can be changed as in the
following example:
CH KCR = 52065
POKE CHKCR + 1,0
Now the routine will stop reading
when i t  encounters a  zero byte.
Similarly the maximum number o f
bytes copied to  the buffer can be
changed:
CHKMAX = 52079
POKE CHKMAX + I,<  n >
Where < n > is any number up to a
limit o f  191, because this is the
maximum amount of space available
in the cassette buffer area.
Even better, "L IN EIN PU T "
YOUR COMMODORE june 1989
28
can be made to ignore any termination
character. Following the "CHKCR"
location is this:
ISTERM BEQ PUTLEN
which is where a branch is made to
the ﬁnal stage upon encountering the
termination character. By using:
ISTERM = 52067
POKE IS TE R M , 2 3 4  :  P O K E
ISTERM + I, 234
This has the effect of overwriting
the branch instruction with "NOP'S",
so the routine cannot exit if a termi-
nation character is found. This allows
enormous ﬂexibility for inputting data
of a 'strange' nature -  "LINE. IN-
PUT c a n  read in all byte values 0-
255. It is possible for example to read
machine code into string - supposing
you wanted to do such a thing!
Because "L IN E INPUT( # )" is
completely self contained, i.e. no part
of th e  conventional interpreter
INPUT( # ) routines are employed, we
are allowed to do something normally
quite illegal. The following is possible
in direct mode:
LINE = 51904
READY.
OPEN 2, 8, 2, "TEXT"
READY
SYS LINE.INPUT 2 ,A$
READY.
?A$
This is incredibly useful for veri-
fying that a Basic routine that you are
trying to  de-bug has saved data
properly or not. It's normally impos-
sible to get at this data in direct mode,
since using "INPUT # " results in an
illegal direct command error, You can
go o n  moving the cursor up an
dinputting and displaying successive
ﬁelds of data. This even works with
numeric data saved using "PRINT tt ",
since these are written as decimal
strings.
If you have an assembler you can
enter the source listing, and i f needs
must the ORG statement can be
changed to relocate the routine any-
where you like, but make a note o f
the new label locations i f you then
want to customise it with POKEs. It's
unlikely that you will need to  use
"LINE INPUT( tt )" very often, but
when you do, you'll be glad it's there.

A Flow of Ideas
I
directory from within a program,
but from Basic this can be very
difﬁcult. There is a  way, and this
method can reveal more information
than may at ﬁrst be obvious.
Before a disk directory program
can be written, it is essential to know
what data the drive makes available.
Using the following short program on
the directory in Table 1 gives all of
the information which is displayed in
Table 2.

The rendered data includes the
Block Allocation Map (BAM) which
lies from Sa102-SCXXX, as well as
the directory content itself (SCXXX-
SCXXX). Using GET # , each byte can
be read and used to  form quite a
powerful source of disk information.
From this readout, the aims of the
program can be derived. What we will
create is a ﬂow diagram for a program
which lists each directory entry, the
ﬁle type, blocks used and the track and
sector (the speciﬁc block location)
relating to each ﬁle. As the program
runs, it will keep track o f the total
number of programs on the disk for
a general round-up screen, which is to
be displayed after the individual
program detail screens.
The program can also keep a tally
of the total number of blocks used,
and this value can then be compared
with the number derived from the
RAM to ensure that the disk has been
validated correctly. Finally, a detailed
map o f the number o f free sectors
(blocks) on each track can be displayed
using colour to differentiate between
tracks which have not been used at
all, and those which have lost a few
sectors to ﬁle storage.
The ﬁrst duty of the program is
to set the screen colours and then
initialise the disk under examination.
This means opening command channel
15, and keeping it open for checks on
disk errors throughout the program.
Next, the directory ﬁle is opened
for a sequential read operation. After
the drive loads the ﬁrst sector into its

How easy is it to
incorporate a disk directory
reader in a program?
By Norman Doyle
internal buffer, variables are initialised
and dimensioned ready for the main
program to begin. The reading of the
BAM takes a little time, so a com-
forting message is displayed to assure
the user th a t this i s  a  normal
occurrence.
Exploded BAM
The layout of the BAM can be seen
from Table 3. There is no single byte
pair responsible fo r recording the
number of free bytes on the disk, so
this value has to be derived from the
data at the beginning of the BAN!. The
ﬁrst two bytes (the track and sector
links) are not loaded when the direc-
tory is read as a sequential ﬁle, and
the next two bytes are irrelevant, but
some of the next group of bytes are
essential to calculating the number of
free memory blocks on the disk.
The information is stored i n  a
speciﬁc way, with the bytes grouped
into clusters of four. The ﬁrst byte is
the total number of free blocks on a
particular track, and the three bytes
that follow can be used to calculate
which particular sectors these are. In
this case, the only byte of interest is
the total number of free blocks, so that
is read and added to a running total
while the others are discarded.
Apart from keeping a record of the
total number o f free blocks, each
YOUR COMMODORE june 1989
29
track's details must be stored in an
array if the aim of producing a tracks
map is to be fulﬁlled. There are 35
tracks on a normal Commodore disk,
and it can be seen from Table 2 that
there are, in fact, 35 groups of four
bytes in the BAM. A loop must read
each o f the groups, storing the ﬁrst
byte in an array and adding its value
to a grand total of free blocks. After
this is done, the next three bytes can
be ignored.
At the end of the BAM, the disk
name and ID numbers can be found.
This must be read and stored in a
suitable form for display at the head
of each screen page. First of all, the
string is initialised to produce a label
indicating that what follows is the
disk's title and, to  comply with
Commodore's convention, the RVS
ON character is added to display the
disk header in reversed characters. A
second convention is to place the disk
name in quotes. This is not catered
for from reading the directory ﬁle, so
the opening quote is added at this
point.
The disk name is allocated a space
of 16 characters in the BAM sector
of the directory. This means that by
simply reading the 16 character group
and adding it to the title string, any
disk name can be catered for without
any complicated checks. The resultant
string is then completed with a closing
quote mark.
To complete the screen page
header, the next 15 bytes are added
to the string. This actually reads more
than enough characters to cater for the
ID and the disk type descriptor (always
2a) on a normally formatted disk, but
is extended to cater for non-standard
formatting using four character 1Ds
and other such tricks. The difﬁculty
here is that some of the bytes will be
stored as 'null values', which is the
reason why string variables are being
used in the program instead of numer-
ical ones to avoid generating errors.
Because the bytes are stored as
ASCII values, the conversion routine
must look for these nulls and convert
them to  CHRS(0) to  avoid similar
errors when the bytes are converted
for use. This happens quite a lot, and
a subroutine is the ideal answer. Once
the disk name has been rendered as

a string, it is printed and, because this
string contains the clear screen symbol,
the name acts as a title for the screen
page.
Before reading i n  the directory
entries, the column heads must be
displayed. The convention that has
been derived for this routine is that
the program name will be followed by
the ﬁle type, block count and the track
and sector values for the ﬁrst program
block.
This information is not stored in
the correct order so it must be read,
stored and sorted o u t i n  a  print
statement. The layout o f  a single
directory entry can be seen in Table
4_ A subroutine deals with the actual
reading of the individual entries, and
this will be examined later.
As each directory entry is dealt
with, a counter is incremented so that
a check can be made for a full screen
page (20 entries). When this number
is reached, a 'Press Any Key' message
is printed and a  keypress detection
loop initiated.
Directories come in all shapes and
sizes, so the program cannot work on
a simple loop to read in the entries.
A way is needed to indicate when the
directory is complete. This is done by
reading the system variable, ST. When
this has a value of zero, work is still
in progress, but if it has a real value
one of two things has occurred.
It may just be that the directory
has been read in completely, or it could
be that an error has occurred. Before
closing the ﬁle, the routine checks the
error channel. If an error is detected,
the program will halt and the message
is printed; i f there is no error the
program continues to the next stage.
Under a screen page title of 'Vital
Statistics', the details of the number
of programs, and blocks used are
printed, suitably labelled_ Both are
derived from the individual directory
entries and supplied via the 'read entry'
subroutine.
The free blocks' value has been
calculated from the HAM record, but
before this is printed we can use this
value and the 'blocks used' value to
check for a correctly validated disk.
If the number o f  blocks used i s
subtracted from the total number of
blocks free on a newly formatted disk
(664), the result should equal the
BAM-derived free block count.
Any inequality means that the
HAM is faulty, and this is ﬂagged by
a suitable message. A word of warning
— inequalities could be the result o f
PR O G R AMMIN G
REL or USR ﬁles being used on the
disk, so ensure that this is not the case
before validating, or you could lose
valuable data!
After the free blocks have been
displayed, a table is drawn up with the
tracks listed above their unused sector
values. At each stage, these values are
checked against the sector capacities
for each track. If none of the sectors
have been used, the value is printed
in brown, but any tracks which contain
ﬁle data are highlighted by using light
blue characters.
This program can easily b e
extended and improved to give a full
BAM map, or reduced to produce a
disk-to-screen directory printout.
The subroutine to  reach each
directory entry is an integral to the
running o f the main program and,
therefore, worth a closer look.
Directory Delivery
The directory read routine takes over
immediately after the disk name has
been read from the disk. The directory
details are preceded by a series of null
bytes which must be discarded until
a 'real' byte value is read in. This
method saves time but has one serious
drawback when the ﬁrst ﬁle has been
deleted and not replaced.
File types are denoted b y byte
values as follows:
129 = SEQ
130 = PRG
131 = USR
132 = REL
If the ﬁle is 'locked', or protected,
these values are increased by 64 to give
a range o f 193-196. Deleting a ﬁle
simply results in these values being
replaced by a null byte. Using the
method of discarding null bytes would
mean that the ﬁrst signiﬁcant value
would be the old track number when
a deleted ﬁle was encountered.
Consequently, t h e  p ro g ra m
includes a check to see if the value read
is in excess of 35. If this is not true
then it must be a deleted ﬁle, so 'DEL'
is assigned as the program type and
the routine jumps to evaluating the
read in value as a track number. If
the value is valid for a ﬁle type, a check
is made to test if it is locked or not.
Provision is made to denote a locked
ﬁle by using a  reversed 'less than'
symbol, which is saved as a string. If
the ﬁle is unprotected, this string
remains as a space.
YOUR COMMODORE june 1989
30
A second string is derived from the
ﬁle descriptor value. This is the ﬁle
type which is calculated directly from
the ﬁle type value in conjunction with
a MIDS statement. After the next byte
has been read in, the pathway which
the DEL ﬁle option took converges
with the main program so that the
track value can be assigned to a string
before the sector value is read and
similarly stored.
The disk name had 16 bytes
assigned to it, and the same is true
for the program name which follows
the sector byte. A  loop reads this in
and concatenates a string. If a program
name has less than 16 characters, the
entry is padded out with shifted space
values (160), and this is useful for
formatting the screen printout later,
so they are not discarded here.
After the name there are nine zero
bytes which are read i n  and disre-
garded, so the next signiﬁcant bytes
denote the number of blocks that the
program occupies. This value is stored
in low byte/ high byte format and a
suitable routine is included to reveal
the true decimal value. A l l  that
remains is to print the information out
in the correct screen columns. Deleted
ﬁles names are shown in orange and
existing ﬁles in white.
One problem with ﬁlenames is that
they sometimes contain control char-
acters such as screen clear, case switch
or even colours. To  avoid these
messing up the beautifully formatted
display, location 212 is poked with a
value to  fool the computer into
thinking that it is in quotes mode, so
that the reversed character is printed
instead of the action which it repres-
ents being executed. Once the rest of
the information is printed, control is
then returned to the main program.
Directory Flow
The ﬂowcharts show the logic of the
program contained i n  the Listings
pages. This is rendered as a  Basic
routine, but the beauty of ﬂowcharting
is that the same logic pathways can
be applied to machine code or just
about any other language that has been
invented.
If you decide to investigate direc-
tory reading further, you'll also soon
realise how useful the charts are for
modifying the program. It's far better
than muddling through reams o f
listings, noting variables and then
trying to make sense of it all.

enemy and the screen will swap to the battle screen showing
all the combatants who will start the ﬁght without your
help.
You can effect the battle by using a cursor to move
men into the fray or you can control one character directly.
This may sound like a good idea but it doesn't quite work,
as to select a character you have to position the cursor
over his feet and the battles just take too long. This can
be annoying, particularly if the battle was only a decoy action
while the party move through the area.
Unfortunately, this spoilt an otherwise interesting game
which could have been so good.

favourite soap opera - Neighbours. Nab, seriously
guy, i t all takes place in Herbert Square, home
to the Squeals, Foulups and other unsavoury characters.
The story starts after Efﬂ has lost her Willie. Yes, in
case you haven't guessed, it's a spoof full of caricatures
and one or two slightly naughty jokes.
You play the part o f PC Donald Dance and your
mission, should you choose to accept it, is to ﬁnd out who
did the dirty on Willie. The inlay tells you that poor old
Willie turns up squashed, and with two holes in his neck.
Leave it out, mate, the missis'll never believe this'un. It
also goes on to say that you can talk to the characters
that you meet. "Ask Bendy about Colon" is cited as an
example. I tried it, and was met with a "You speak, but
it doesn't further your enquiries." None of the Deadenders
wanted to talk to me. Was it something I said?
The jokes are obviously geared towards Eastenders fans,
but I can quite believe that non-followers of the series would
get at least a smile from the game. Most of the humour,
for me at least, came whenever I examined a character.
When I examined Scary, I was told "Purple eyes and bright
green hair, she resembles a technicolour skunk." Great stuff.
All the descriptions are along these lines, and most are
less than charitable.
When it comes to gameplay, I have a few reservations.
The game doesn't accept some of the normal abbreviations.
I had to type in "inventory" as opposed to just "i". Not
all the exits were listed, even the ones that should have
been obvious, and mapping left something to be desired.
When standing on the landing of the Old Queen, I was
faced with the kitchen, bedroom and living room, yet no
directions were given. It was a case of "enter kitchen" etc,
and no matter which of them I went into, the exit was
always to the south. This system wasn't used consistently,
though. From Herbert Square I could see the pub, the cafe
and the corner shop. This time I had to input the usual
•
N, S. E and W, and hope I went to the building I wanted.
Some things should be taken for granted in an adventure
and sticking to one way of inputting directions is on this
agenda.
During the course of the game, I came across two bugs,
one funny and one annoying. I'd got a box from Arfer
and, whenever I tried to examine it, the game crashed.
However, I was allowed to "search box" with no ill effects.
Later, I discovered that I could "exam box" but only i f
I wasn't carrying it. I can just imagine how frustrating it
would be for someone to ﬁnd that out after going for a
long time with no saves! The other bug was a silly one.
I'd been searching through a dustbin, as one does, and my
investigations took me to  the launderette where I  was
reminded how disgusting my uniform was. No problem.
I took i t off, washed it in a machine, got it out again,
then found out I had two uniforms, one wet and one dirty.
In keeping with the spirit of the game, there's no ordinary
reply when you tell the computer to get something. Instead
you get a chirpy "Right, me old china." Should any copies
of this game reach America, it will only reinforce their beliefs
that we all talk like Dick Van Dyke,
The authors have got a nice line in schoolboy humour,
which I  greatly appreciate. What a  shame about the
programming.
If you can ignore the niggles that I picked on, get down
the frog an' toad an' give your dosh to the geezer in the
shop. But i f you're the sort who likes to be able to use
single key inputs, logical geography and no bugs, knock
it on the 'cad.
One last question. Where was Kylie?

PERFORMANCE
ANALYSER
B
which makes it very easy for
programmers to create complex
programs with a minimum of effort.
We pay a price for this programming
ease, and that price is often poor
performance, that is, our Basic pro-
gram runs slowly. Another problem
which confronts the Basic programmer
is what to do when a program runs
without failing, but doesn't give you
the results you expect. How do you
ﬁnd out what your program is doing
without adding PRINT statements to
your program to trace execution or
interrupt execution at strategic points?
The Performance Analyser helps to
overcome both problems. Not only
does it trace the logic ﬂow in a Basic
program, it also determines how long
each Basic line took to execute. Thus
the Performance Analyser is a gener-
alised performance analysis tool for
the Commodore 64.
C64 PR O G R AMMIN G
Performance Analyser
TRACE Facility
Most commercial traces usually
amount to a window displaying ﬁve
or six line numbers on the screen as
your Basic program runs. The line
numbers scroll in the window as each
line is executed, and the window may
or may not interfere with your pro-
gram output. You normally cannot
trace a Basic program which uses hi-
res graphics, and you certainly cannot
go back and check the line number
sequence previously displayed.
Although you can usually slow the
trace display down (by the space bar
for example), you have very little
chance o f  writing down the line
numbers on paper for a more detailed
analysis.
The Performance Analyser over-
comes all of these problems. It allows
you to trace any Basic program which
uses normal screen graphics, hi-res
screens, sprites or sound and does not
interfere with the operation o f the
program. The Analyser will not slow
YOUR COMMODORE june 1989
34
Programming can be made
simple with these three C64
performance analysers
your program down, and allows you
to give the trace display at your leisure.
You may scroll backwards or forwards
through the line numbers for as long
as you wish.
Performance Analysis
The Analyser also provides you with
a tool to determine how efﬁcient your
Basic program is. When it displays the
line number it also displays the time
it took to execute the line. As you scroll
through the line numbers you can tell
at a glance which line numbers are
slowing down execution and which
line numbers are executed most often.
Basic programs are the same as any
other program - they follow the 80/
20 rule. That is, 80 per cent of the work
is usually done by 20 per cent of the
program. The Performance Analyser
is the tool you need to tell you which
20 per cent of your program is doing
80 per cent of the work, and how long
it is taking to do it. You can then
concentrate on making that part o f
your program more efﬁcient.

Analysing a Basic
program
The Analyser is written entirely in
Machine Language, and is designed to
cause as little interference as possible
with the traced program. The Analyser
is normally loaded at 38912, and all
Analyser variables and constants are
contained in the 2k from 38192 to
40959. Your Basic program thus has
the RAM between 2048 and 38911, any
low storage locations it requires and
the free RAM at 49152. Should you
require the RAM at 38912, then set
the top of Basic pointer (55,56) to the
last RAM location available to Basic,
and the Analyser will use 2K of RAM
before this address. For example, i f
the top of the basic pointer is set to
32768, then the Analyser will load itself
at 30720.
Type in the Analyser loader pro-
gram and save it as ANALYSER 1.
Make sure you verify that what you
saved is correct. To use the Analyser,
simply issue a load "ANALYSER I"
after setting the top of BASIC pointer
if necessary. ANALYSER I will set the
required Basic pointers, POKE the
Analyser Machine Language logic into
the correct RAM, relocate all required
ML addresses and print messages to
indicate how to  start and stop the
Analyser and display the trace data.
The following messages are displayed
on the screen by ANALYSER! during
execution;
LOADING TH E ANALYSER A T
38912
LOAD OK
RELOCATION OK
I. START ANALYSER = SYS 38912
2. STOP ANALYSER = SYS 38915
3. DISPLAY DATA = SYS 38918
If the load fails, or the relocation of
addresses fails, a message is issued and
ANALSYER I stops.
Obviously to start the Performance
Analyser you SYS to 38912 or to the
address displayed by ANALYSER
You can do this from a program or
from direct mode. Th e  message
TRACE STARTED is displayed by
the Analyser, unless you start it from
a program. The message is not issued
then to ensure that the Analyser does
not interfere with program messages
or displays.
After the Analyser has been
loaded, you then LOAD the Basic
C64 PRO G RAMMING
program o r programs you wish to
analyse. The Analyser monitors exe-
cution of your program(s), and saves
trace data in the trace data buffer for
later display. If you only want to trace
part of a Basic program, you Nvould
do the following;
1000 REM START THE
ANALYSER
1010 SYS 38912
1020 FORTH = .6to6STEP.1
1030 X A*COS(TH)
1040 Y =B*COS(TH)/C
1050 NEXT
1060 REM STOP THE ANALYSER
1070 SYS 38915
1080 R E M  D IS P L A Y  TR A C E
DATA
1090 SYS 38918
1100 END
After your Basic program has ﬁnished,
or you stop it executing, you can stop
the Analyser if you want to. However,
you don't stop it to display the trace
data. You may leave it active to trace
another program if you want to.
Obviously, to  stop the Perfor-
mance Analyser you SYS to 38915 or
to the address displayed by ANAL-
YSER'. You can do this from a
program or from direct mode. The
message TRACE STOPPED is dis-
played by the Analyser, unless you
stop i t from a program. Again the
message is not issued to ensure that
the Analyser does not interfere with
program messages or displays.
Finally, you may display trace data
at any time by entering SYS 38918 or
SYS to  the address displayed b y
ANALYSER I, and of course you may
do this in direct mode o r from a
program. The message NO TRACE
DATA is displayed by the Analyser
if there is nothing to display. Again
the message is not issued i f you are
under program control. This is to
ensure that the Analyser does not
interfere with program messages or
displays.
If there is data to  display the
Analyser presents i t i n  full-screen
mode, that is a page or full screen data
consisting of line numbers and line
execution times is displayed and the
Analyser ML program waits for you
to press one of the function keys; Fl
terminates the display, F5 scrolls back
to the previous page of data and F7
scrolls forward to the next page o f
data.
You may scroll back and forward
through the trace data for as long as
YOUR COMMODORE june 1989
35
you like with function keys F5 and F7.
When the end o f the trace data is
found, the number of lines executed
and the total execution time is dis-
played, and the Analyser ML program
waits for you to press a function key.
The Analyser will only recognise F1,
F5 and F7 function keys. All other
keys are ignored. If you scroll forward
from the end of the display, you wrap
around to the start of the trace data
again. You can't scroll back from the
top of the trace data, you may only
scroll forward.
NOTE: Trace data will be displayed
automatically when the trace data
buffer area is full. The trace data buffer
is actually the RAM under the BASIC
ROM. As much trace data as possible
is stored there before the execution of
the Basic program is interrupted and
the trace data displayed. If you want
your Basic program to  continue,
simply press Ft and the trace display
is terminated. Your program begins
execution from where i t was inter-
rupted. If you want to browse the trace
data, then use F5 or F7 to scroll back
and forward through the data.
How the Performance
Analyser Works
The Analyser works by monitoring the
execution of Basic programs via the
character dispatch vector i n  low
storage. A s  each program byte is
interpreted, the Analyser checks to
determine if the current line number
(57,58) has changed from the previous
byte read. When the line number
changes, then the Analyser stores the
line number and current time in the
trace data buffer under the BASIC
ROM. This is done until such time as
the trace data buffer is full.
When the buffer is full, the Anal-
yser saves the ﬁrst 2K of low storage
(0-2047), colour R AM and various
control registers in the RAM under
the KERNAL ROM. The trace data
is then displayed, and when the display
is stopped via function key Fl , the
Analyser restores the ﬁrst 2K of low
storage, the colour R A M  and the
various control registers. This allows
the Basic program to restart execution
from the point where i t was inter-
rupted, and the program screen is
restored, as well as character colours
and backgrounds.
If your Basic program uses the
RAM under the Basic of KERNAL
ROMS, then you cannot analyse i t
with this utility. Note also that if your

Basic program resets the time (T1S =
"000000"). then the Analyser will not
fail, but the execution times displayed
will be unpredictable.

PROGRAM ANALYSIS
C
ysis (C64PANAL) is a Basic
program which analyses the
contents o f any Basic program and
displays the information on the screen
or printer. C64PANAL ﬁrst displays
summary information which contains
the program name, the size o f the
program in bytes, the number of lines
in the program, the total number of
commands (ie PRINT's, GOTO's, Ifs
etc.) and the number of variables.
Once the summary data has been
viewed, a detailed list of the commands
used -in the Basic program and the
number of times each command is used
is displayed. When you have ﬁnished
viewing the command data, a detailed
list of the variables and the use of each
variable is displayed, and when you
have ﬁnished viewing the variable data
you may end the display, ask for the
information to be reshown or send the
data to your printer.
Using C64PANAL
C64PANAI, allows you to  analyse
your Basic program. It does this by
running in the 4K o f free RAM at
49152 to 53247, and loading the Basic
programs it analyses at 2049. By not
using the R A M  between 2048 and
40960, C64PANAL is capable o f
analysing the largest Basic program.
However, with only 4K of RAM to
run in, C64PANAL will run slowly
analysing large Basic programs
because many garbage collections will
be done to ensure that there is suf-
ﬁcient space for C64PANAL to oper-
ate correctly. Also, only 50 variables
can be displayed because o f space
constraints.
Obviously if C64PANAL is to run
in the R A M  a t 49152 then some
changes need to  be made to  Basic
pointers in low storage. The start of
Basic and end of Basic addresses need
to be changed as well as the start of
variables etc. These changes are
handled by the C64PANAL loader
program. LOADER is the Basic loader
program which automatically loads
C64 PRO G RAMMING
C64PANAL. It sets the low storage
pointers, and then uses the dynamic
key facility to  automatically load
C64PANAL.
You m u s t create a n d  save
LOADER ﬁrst on tape or disk. Next
type in C64PANAL and save it directly
after LOADER on tape or on the same
disk as C64PANAL.
Note that if you are using disk you
need to change line no 10 in LOADER
from LOAD "C64PANAL", 1,1 to
LOAD"C64PANAL", 8,1 so  that
C64PANAL will be loaded from disk
and not tape.
Once you have saved LOADER
and C64PANAL to tape or disk then
simply load LOADER and RUN it.
LOADER will set the various low
storage pointers and then set up the
screen and keyboard buffer so that
when it ends, C64PANAL is automat-
ically loaded a t  49152. Wh e n
C64PANAL has been loaded it begins
execution automatically, clears the
screen and places the ﬁrst message on
the screen:
LOAD FROM DISK (Y/N)?
If you want C64PANAL to load the
Basic program it analyses from disk,
then reply Y. Otherwise reply N and
the program will be loaded from tape.
Before replying to this message, you
should have the tape or disk which
contains the program to be analysed
in the datasette or disk drive.
The next message to be displayed
is:
PROGRAM TO BE LOADED = = ?
Your answer to  this message tells
C64PANAL the name of the program
it is to load from tape or disk to
analyse.
C64PANAL then uses the KER-
NAL load subroutine to load the Basic
program at 2049 and begins to analyse
it. Since i t may take some time to
analyse large Basic programs,
C64PANAL places the line number
being analysed in the top left-hand
corner of the screen while scanning the
Basic program. When analysing is
ﬁnished the summary report is dis-
played as follows:
—PROGRAM STATISTICS----
PROGRAM NAME = C64PANAL
PROGRAM SIZE = xxxxx
NO OF LINES = xxxxx
NO OF COMMANDS = xxxxx
NO OF VARIABLES = xxx

If you press the R  key, then all

mary display is reshown. If you press

is displayed:
TIME TAKEN = xxxx.xx
This is the time in seconds it has taken
C64PANAL to analyse your program.
You may then use C64PANAL to
analyse another Basic program.
Press P and the information is sent
to the printer.
Applying C64PANAL
C64PANAL has many uses. You can
ﬁnd the size of your Basic program,
the number of variables you use and
the number of lines in your program.
The number o f lines is important,
because each line in a Basic program
carries an overhead of 4 bytes (2 bytes
for a link address and 2 bytes for the
line number). A 500 line program uses
2,000 bytes o f  storage fo r  l i n k
addresses and line numbers. I f  you
have an excessive number of lines, you
can conserve space by reducing the
number o f  lines (also known as
crunching your program). You reduce
the number of lines by placing multiple
commands on the same line seperated
by colons, removing blanks and
removing REM commands.
Processing new lines also carries
with i t a performance penalty. The
more lines in a Basic program, the
longer it normally takes to run. By
reducing the number o f lines, you
normally reduce program execution
time. C64PANAL will tell you how
successful you have been at reducing
the number of lines in your program.
It will give the size of your program
and the number of lines before crunch-
ing, and then after you have made your
changes you can run it again and get
the new ﬁgures.
The detailed list of commands (ie
PRINT's, GOTO's, 'F
be used to reduce program size and
increase performance. For instance, if
you ﬁnd that you have a very large
number of IF commands, then you
may be able to reduce them by using
the ON command. For example if you
have:
IF CC = I GOTO 1000
C64 PROGRAMMING
IF CC = 2 GOTO 1100
IF CC = 3 GOTO 1200
IF CC = 4 GOTO 2000
IF CC = 5 GOTO 2100
IF CC = 6 GOTO 2200
then you could replace the IF com-
mands with one:
ON CC GOTO 1000, 1100, 1200, 2000,
2100, 2200
It is also interesting to see the pattern
of commands in various programs and
which commands are used most
frequently. In  string operations the
LEFTS, RIGHTS, MIDS etc. wilt
ﬁgure prominently. However, the most
common commands used are the IF,
GOTO, FOR and NEXT and PRINT.
The list of variables is a powerful
tool to help in the exeuction of your
Basic program. Basic maintains a list
of variables, and the closer a variable
is to the start of that list, the less time
that is needed to ﬁnd the variable when
it is referenced in a statement. For
example, every time IF X = 3.7 TOTO
100 is executed, the X variable must
be found in Basic's list of variables to
check if it is 3.7 or not. Thus the closer
X is to the top of the list, the faster
it is found. The order o f variables
makes a signiﬁcant difference to the
execution time of your program if you
have a  large number o f  them.
C64PANAL helps by giving you a
guide as to which variables ought to
be deﬁned ﬁrst so that they appear at
the top of Basic's list of variables. You
can ensure the order of variables by
deﬁning them in the following anner:
X = 0:A = 0:Y = 0:PC = 0:TK% = 0
etc.
X will come ﬁrst, A second, Y third
in the list and so on.
If you have Basic programs where
execution time is crucial (for eg. games
programs) then C64PANAL will be an
important tool to help you analyse
those programs and make them faster.

SWITCH
C
short Machine Language (ML)
program which resides in RAM
just before the BASIC R OM. I t
occupies storage locations 40704 to
40959. C64 SWITCH allows you to
partition your C64 into two logical
machines. You switch between the two
partitions or regions with a single key
YOUR COMMODORE june 1989
37
stroke. With this utility, you can load
two Basic programs a t once and
compare them o r  work o n  them.
However, you cannot have both
programs running simultaneously.
Using C64 SWITCH
C64 SWITCH allows you to  set
variable region sizes. The regions are
designated zero (0) and one (1) and
region 0 will extend from location 2049
to the limit your set, while rzgion 1
extends from the end of region 0 to
40703.
To use the switching function,
simply load SWITCH, which is a Basic
loader program. When you run it,
SWITCH will load the ML routine at
40704 and display the message:
ENTER R E GION  0  E N D I N G
ADDR = = >7
You enter the ending address fo r
region 0 (and thus region 1 starting
addr) and the ﬁnal messages are
displayed:
REGIONS 0 and I INITIALISED
REGION ACTIVATED = 0
To switch between the two regions use
the Elf F7 keys. Fl will activate region
0 while F7 will activate region 1. The
active region is displayed in the upper
right-hand corner o f  the screen i n
reverse video. T o  deactivate the
SWITCH, simply hit RUN STOP/
RESTORE or turn the C64 off and
on.
Applying SWITCH
C64 SWITCH has three main uses.
You can load two Basic programs at
once, and work on them or compare
them. You can use region 1 as a data
region which is accessed by a program
in region 0 (SWITCH was originally
written for this purpose). Finally, you
can use SWITCH as a  means o f
merging two programs. If you want
to add code to a program in region
0 from a program in region 1, simply
LIST the statements in region 1 on
the screen, press Fl to activate region
0 and then move the cursor over the
lines you want added and press
RETURN. Each line will be entered
into the program in region O.

Enhance your help function with this handy utility
By Mark Everingham
I
ment (you know, the four page epic
which managed to  link Charles
Babbage, an elephant, and a teddy-
bear called BJ to buying a Commodore
computer fo r Christmas), special
emphasis was laid on the 'HELP'
function o f  the C16 and Plus/ 4
computers. Commodore claimed i t
helps you to debug your programs, yet
I have owned a  Plus/ 4 for several
months now, and can honestly say I
have never used the HELP function
except for the novelty. The BBC Micro
has a command *HELP which lists the
syntax o f a given command on a
sideways R OM, and I  decided to
implement such a  function on the
Plus/4. I decided on three features it
should have -
1. It should be compatible with the
Commodore do.
2. It should not take any memory from
the programmer.
3. I t  should not interfere with the
normal HELP function.
A tall order? Well, I decided that
to allow a reasonable amount of help
on the C16, the program must use the
Disk Drive. That way, I could put it
in the cassette buffer so as not to use
up any memory; and a  CHRGET
wedge like the DOS SUPPORT
program seemed appropriate to allow
for the normal HELP function. The
result is a 142 Byte piece of machine
code using standard PRG ﬁles on a
Commodore Disk Drive such as the
15511

Listing 1 T h e  Screen
Editor
When you've entered and debugged
the program, save it onto a disk using
DSAVE 'HELP EDITOR' and RUN
the program again. You should be
presented with a white screen showing
the usual ﬂashing cursor in the top-
left corner. At this stage, the editor
acts just as i f  you were editing a
document t y p e  text, in normal or
reverse, graphics symbols, anything
you want, even use the ESC functions
to format your screen.
Pressing RETURN from the ﬁrst
level puts you into the command
mode. A bar will appear at the bottom
of the screen with three options. Press
the relevant function key to select each
one.
LOAD prompts for a ﬁlename and
attempts to load this HELP screen
from the disk.
SAVE prompts for a ﬁlename and
saves the current screen to disk under
that name.
CONT puts you back into level - the
edit mode.
When you've created a help screen,
save it onto Disk under a suitable and
memorable name, a n d  e xi t th e
program. The HELP command now
has something to work with. I f  you
DIRECTORY the disk, you will see
a ﬁle 'ﬁlename.11' The designates

Listing 2 - The Basic
Loader
Now that you have some data on disk
type in Listing 2, the Basic Loader,
and save i t on disk using DSAVE
'HELP PROGRAM'. When you have
run it, try pressing function key I. You
should see the message 'SYS 933:REM
ON'. SYS 933 turns the H EL P
command on, press function key 2 or
type SYS 950 to turn it off.
With the HELP Command on, try
typing i n HELP (RETURN). This 1

simply does th e  normal H E L P

errors in it, nothing should happen.
Now, try typing HELP 'Filename',
where ﬁlename is the name you stored
your Help screen under. If all is well,
your screen should load and the
READY prompt will appear at the
bottom of the screen. If this does not
happen, something is wrong i f  you
get an error message '?STRING TOO
LONG ERROR' this means that you
have tried to type in a name more than
14 characters long. If you get the error
message '?DIRECT MODE ONLY

Practical use of the HELP
Command
When creating HELP ﬁles, try to give
them memorable and unambiguous
names. It is also a good idea to make
them short, though the ' "  and '?'
designators may be used in ﬁlenames.
For instance, i f  you are going to
replace the manual with a HELP disk,
divide the ﬁles into commands, each
showing the syntax and a few examples
of the command's use. E.g. Typing
HELP 'CIRCLE' might bring up all
the different ways o f  using the
command CIRCLE. The thing o f
utmost importance is to  'use your
common sense!' Its a system which is
very powerful when used properly, but
could end up not being helpful at all
if help ﬁles are designed without
thinking. Anyway, I  hope it will be
very useful to you

f you tried to imagine
what a game called
The Deep would be
like, you'd probably
think of buried wrecks,
sharks, octopuses or
perhaps submarines.
You certainly
wouldn't think
that you'd spend most
of the game on the
sea's surface! Unfortunately, this is exactly what you do
in this rather disappointing game.
It reminds me of a very old arcade game which I think
was called Submarine Attack, in which you controlled a
ship armed with depth charges that had to survive an assault
of submarines that released mines and ﬁred torpedoes at
you.
In The Deep, your task is to destroy subs, after which
small ﬂags are occasionally released and ﬂoat to the surface,
staying there for three seconds. If you manage to avoid
the ﬂoating mines and reach them in time, a helicopter
will ﬂy overhead and drop a package that you must catch.
These packages increase your chances in the game by
supplying hydrofoil speed to your ship so you can skim
across the surface, smart bombs to wipe out all subs, cursor
missiles that can be aimed and destroy everything in their
path, or submersible pods that can collect the tokens that

The early tracks are easy enough, and although the other
riders can get in your way and even cause a crash, you'll
easily catch up the time. Later on things get tricky, with
the addition of slippery road surfaces to send you sliding,
treacherous icy conditions, obstacles such as barricades and
cones to send you crashing, and a tighter time limit where
every second will count.
To add variety to the races, the scrolling landscape
changes from day to night, country to city, and mountains
to desert, the most impressive being the race near Cape

espite the split between Electronic Arts and
Accolade, the string of Accolade imports continues
from the EA stable. This latest one attempts to
recreate the world o f Formula I  racing, and offers you
the chance to drive for either the Ferrari, Williams or
Melaren teams in a world championship against nine other
drivers and over eight Grand Prix races.
Selecting the team you will drive for also selects the
type of car you will drive -  for example, the Ferrari is
slower than the others, but is not as likely to spin and
so is a good car to start with. When you think you can
control the car. you may want to swap to a Williams or
the fastest, the McLaren. A more detailed appraisal of each
ear is presented on-screen in a display that shows the power
curves or horse-power and torque, engine size, gear box,
chassis and weight, so that people who think these ﬁgures
are important can use them to decide which car to use
in the championship.
Perhaps of more importance is the game level you choose
to play at, as this can determine whether it will be a quiet,
sporting race without any mechanical problems, or a bitter
tight where the best car and driver will win. The problem
with the car is keeping it going at a speed fast enough
to maintain your race position, but slow enough to stop
it from blowinv, up.
Tyres are also a major headache, particularly in the
longer Grand Prix, where cornering too quickly and
spinning can cause excess wear. They can be changed in
the Pits, but this can cost you valuable seconds i f your
Pit team isn't quick enough.
The ﬁrst Grand Prix of the season is at Rio de Janeiro
in Brazil, but before you can think about the nine
championship points for winning it, you have to drive round
the circuit in a qualifying lap. This not only gives you a
preview of the track, but the time you take decides your
position on the starting grid.
The race screen display shows your view of the track
and your controls, which include a tachometer to watch
for engine strain, a damage indicator that plots the condition
of your car, especially braking and handling, a speedometer,
rear view mirrors to check that no-one's in your slipstream.
and a map box that includes a line drawing of the course
and a ﬂashing dot to plot your position.
Steering can bP a little tricky at ﬁrst, as moving the
joystick turns the wheel, and you must remember to turn
it back again as it doesn't auto-centre, unlike most driving
games. However, once you've mastered the basics you have
to contend with the competition, particularly at the higher
game levels when any collision will put you out of the race.
The corners are the best place to overtake, where the
driver with the strongest nerve will take the lead - it's all
down to when you apply the brakes. I f  you brake after
your opponent, you'll go round the bend in the lead, but
if you leave it too late you'll spin off.
While Grand Prix Circuit is a good simulation of a
formula l championship, an eight race season will probably
prove too much for all but dedicated formula l fans. There
is an option to race in a single Grand Prix, but there are
better racing games for the casual driver. This one's for
those who live on carbon monoxide car fumes.

ere's a second chance to ﬁll the ample boots of
the one and only Johnny "Jimbo Baby" McGibbets,
as he ﬁles off in his Whizzbang Enterprises Gizmo
chopper to save the world at least three times. The former
full-priced game has been re-released via the Kixxs label,
and it's excellent value for money.
His opponent in all this is the aptly described but
unnamed Mad Leader, who is threatening all sorts o f
despicable things if he isn't stopped, and Jimbo Baby's the
man for the job.
Each of the three missions follows a similar pattern ---
a three stage game in which you must ﬂy through enemy
airspace to ﬁnd the Mad Leader's camp, then ion foot)
inﬁltrate the heavily armed camp and search the buildings
for secret plans, weapons and so on.
In fact, Inﬁltrator is three games in one, starting with
a combat ﬂight simulator in which you must combine
stealth, to confuse the enemy, with ﬁghting skills to shoot
them down. In the camp, you are armed with false papers
and sleeping gas to get into the camp without raising the
alarm. Inside the buildings, things get tougher as you must
aNroid the guards and search (Impossible Mission-style)every
object in every room. If the guards get too nosey, showing
them your papers may satisfy them, if not, use some sleeping
gas and then get out before the come round and raise the
alarm.
Inﬁltrator was a smash hit in the States, but is still
underrated over here. At E2.99, it's a bargain.

scientists have been developing super-advanced
., m a c h i n e s ,  and so it was almost inevitable that one
day the machines would get so advanced that they wouldn't
need the men any more.
By the time the Denarians realised what had happened,
it was too late to launch a direct assault. They tried anyway,
but it just made the machines more powerful. Their only
chance to  break the tyranny and escape from their
underground prison is you, ﬂying a small ﬁghter.
The ﬁghter is, of course, highly tnanouverable, and can
be improved by collecting items and debris from enemy
ships. Before you start thinking that you've heard it all
before, and that this is just another Nemesis clone, I'm
delighted to tell you that it isn't. For one thing, two of
you can play together.
The ﬁghter is a DS-I-175 Eagle Fighter that begins the
game unprepared for the onslaught ahead. You'll face a
barrage of meteorites, swarms of mechanised ﬂyers and have
to brave the ﬁrepower of land-ﬁxed gun emplacements. The
other player controls a satellite that's activated by player
one collecting a crystal early in the game. From then on,
it can either move independently or dock with the ﬁghter
(which is what happens in the one player game).
As with Nemesis, you can pick up objects to improve
your ship, but these are harder to come by. They have
speciﬁc effects on your ship, and come in the shape of
crystals, extra weapons and balls. Crystals are split into
two groups, with the Geega crystal activating and improving
the ﬁrepower of the satellite, and the Zeela stars increasing
and decreasing the speed of the alien ships.
There are ﬁve types of balls that add a cumulative effect
on your ship - they include a red ball to increase shooting
power, green to add to the number of missiles, blue to
activate a temporary shield, grey to add 1000 bonus points
and yellow, which acts as a  smart bomb destroying
everything currently on the screen,
Extra weapon symbols are less common, and include
systems known as the Scatter Shot, Lightening Blitz Shot
and Power Shot. You can also collect protection satellites
that ﬂy above and below your ﬁghter and deﬂect incoming
missiles. You will need all this ﬁrepower and protection
if you are to survive the level, as well as the inevitable
monster machine that guards the way to the next screen.
Perhaps the most important thing to learn is control
over the ﬁre button, as this is not a game where an auto-
ﬁring joystick is the way to get a high score. Instead you
must choose the right moment to stab the ﬁre button for
a short burst of energy, or press and hold the button to
build up the power shot that can take out a medium-sized
asteroid or dent a super machine.
Obviously, Denaris is inspired by games like Nemesis,
but includes enough subtle differences to make it worth
a second look.

ool and snooker games are very popular, but they've
always had the problem of being played entirely from
a top-down perspective, making it difﬁcult to shoot
accurately. Now, thanks to Firebird and the skills of pool
champ 'Maltese' Joe Barbara, you can get into the action
in one of the ﬁrst true 3D pool games.
It's quite a remarkable piece of programming — you
can walk around the table, pull out for an overhead view
and then get down close to aim your shot. There are no
aiming lines or cursors, it's up to you to get down close
and judge the angles.
You'll need to practise a little on the controls before
you can expect to clear the table in a single break. Left
and right controls move you around the table, while up
and down zoom in and out. Pressing the ﬁre button up
and down increases and decreases the power of the shot,
moving it left and right controls the horizontal position
where the cue will strike the cue ball. This decides the "side"
on the ball, and whether it will swerve left or right after
it's hit another ball or a cushion.
Top or stun is added by hitting the cue ball above or
below its centre, and this, curiously enough, is controlled
by the same controls that zoom you in and out. Therefore,
to stun the ball back, you have to look down on the table
from overhead.
Eventually, you'll sort that one out and be ready to
take part in the tournament against seven other players
e right to play Maltese Joe himself. When you realise
e is pool's equivalent of Steve Davis, you'll appreciate
ou have to qualify ﬁrst.
is is also the ﬁrst C64 pool or snooker game which
es an actual tournament where each round is played
ore than one frame. For example, you begin your
ch n g e  in the quarter ﬁnal in a best-of-three match, then
it's best-of-ﬁve in the semis, and seven in the ﬁnal.
The computer opponents provide a reasonable game,
based on the fact that they know what they're doing, whereas
you're learning. As you get better, you'll get closer to the
challenge match with Maltese Joe. If that's too much for
you, or you ﬁnd i t too easy, then you can opt to play
against another human, or try one of the 15 trick shots
with which you can amaze your friends.
The game plays the popular pub version of pool, in
which you must pot all seven of your coloured balls before
sinking the black to win the match. However, any foul
shots (and the computer opponents occasionally play what
would describe as deliberate misses) are punished by
warding the other player an extra shot and a free ball.
This game is deﬁnitely a cut above the usual 2D style
of pool game, but it does have some rough edges. Although
the balls have shadows and reﬂections, they slide rather
than roll across the table, but that's probably more to do
with the technology of the hardware than the programming.
The oddest thing is the lack of cushions. Visually, they're
three, but the balls seem to drift through them and hang
off the edge of the table. However, I doubt there'll be too
many complaints about these minor graphical points.
As a ﬁrst 3D pool game it is exceptional and free from
ridiculous seven cushion shots that plague many 2D
sions.

This is an intriguing game. but it's let down somewhat
by an inadequate set o f instructions so that even after
prolonged playing, I still had little idea of what exactly
was trying to accomplish.

Three games for less
than a pound each is the
boast of 12.3 from Silverbird.
Pick of these titles is tin
doubtedly Rock 'n" Wrestle,
your chance to try out such
moves as ﬂying body presses
and aeroplane spins on the
likes o f Vicious Vivian and
Gorgeous Greg. Bouncing
off the ropes to build up
speed, you should attempt
to soften your opponent
up a bit before attempting
to pin him to the canvas.
The other two games are somewhat less noteworthy.
BMX Kick has you trying to qualify for the next race by
ﬁnishing in the top three in your current one. It is not
sufﬁcient just to complete the course, you have to perform
stunts and tricks as well. Collect cans of pop to boost your
energy and wheels to repair the damage caused by collision
with the other riders.
The ﬁnal game is Ninla Master, which is a truly dreadful
martial arts game, but one so had that it's almost worth
having for that fact alone. Dodge arrows, karate chop logs,
fend off death stars with your sword and ﬁnally shoot down
cannisters with your blow-pipe, if you can muster enough
interest.
Pi.R.Squared, also from Bug Byte, is a strange game.
You must chase round cogs trying to pick up the different
elements of assorted mathematical formulae. Pursuing you
round the perimeter of the cogs are the chasers. Contact
with these decreases your IQ, although you can restore this
by collecting books. Other objects may be beneﬁcial or
hazardous to your journey. I didn't particularly enjoy this
game ﬁrst time round, and I'm afraid that time has not
mellowed my opinion.
The ﬁnal game this month, and by far the best of the
bunch, is Dan Dare II on Mastertronic's Ricochet label.
Perhaps the most notable aspect of this sequel is that it
is actually different from the original something most
unusual in this industry. The evil Mekon has developed
a race of Supertreens, and it's up to Dan to penetrate the
four levels of the Mekon's ship and sabotage the control
boxes.
You can also choose to play the Mekon, attempting
to release the Supertrcen into outer space. In either case,
you only have a limited amount of time to accomplish your
task before moving onto the next level. This is a good-
looking game that plays exceptionally well, and if you don't
already have it in your collection, I suggest that you go
out and pick up a copy straight away.

A powerful 6502 assembler for both
tape and disk users.
By Steve Carrie
T
mode system whereby 6502
assembly language programs
may be compiled from either one or
more disk ﬁles and/or memory. I t
provides a set of commands to control
its various functions, and also allows
output to a Commodore printer.
The system has two modes o f
operation; disk mode and memory
mode. In disk mode, the source code
ﬁle is read from the source disk drive,
and i ts compiled output sent to
another ﬁle on the destination disk
drive. In  memory mode, the source
code is read from memory (where it
is edited in either mode) and output
to memory. Code relocation facilities
exist t o  allow a  program to  be
assembled to run at one address but
placed at another.
C64 PROGRAM
CI D
The AS M system has two error
modes, fatal and nonfatal. In  fatal
mode, an error will cause the assembler
to halt, whereas in nonfatal mode, the
assembler will process the whole ﬁle,
listing errors as it goes. Some facilities
also exist for control of disk drives and
errors reporting from these devices. A
printer re-direction facility allows all
output which is normally sent to the
screen to be sent to the printer at device
number 4 or 5. Source and destination
drive numbers may be set before
assembly commences. Whilst using the
editor, any Basic direct mode com-
mand may be issued.
Whilst ASM was designed prim-
arily for use with disk drives, the fact
that i t supports memory assembly
allows tape users to make use of it.
The memory mode was originally
YOUR COMMODORE june 1989
47
The ASM
Assembler
designed to allow short routines to be
tested without having to resort to disk
usage. Even in memory mode, you may
still make use of ﬁles from disk as the
ﬁle-link/ ﬁle-include facility still
works.
Getting it all in
Listed here as a Basic loader program,
ASM represents a considerable typing
task. You may type in the program
directly as it stands, but don't run it
until you have read the next bit! Before
running, (assuming you have saved a
copy to tape/disk ﬁrst) execute these
direct BASIC commands ﬁrst. These
will set the memory conﬁguration
correctly.

POKE 43, 01 :POKE 44, 35 :POKE
8960,0 :NEW
Now reload the Basic loader and
run it. ASM will be POKEd into
memory at the correct address and
saved to whichever device you set the
device no. to (1 or 819/ 10/ 11 see the
listing). Reset the machine and load
and run ASM. You should get a sign-
on message and a ﬂashing cursor.
When ASM is loaded and run, it
installs a small wedge into the BASIC
system. This has two important effects:
(1) Edited program lines are no
longer tokenised by Basic. This
means that you cannot edit a
Basic program. This is similar to
the EDIT program in my 'Con-
structing a Compiler' series in a
previous i s s u e  o f  Y o u r
Commodore.
A set o f additional commands
are introduced via the special
character * . These commands
allow you to easily access the
facilities provided.
(2)
The additional commands
The extra commands are as follows:
Assembly:
*assem: Start the assembler in the
mode set by the mode commands
*mem and *disk. The operation is as
follows. In disk mode, you are asked
for a ﬁlename whose default extension
is ,astn. The output ﬁle will have
extension .exe. In memory mode, the
source code is expected from memory
and output is to  memory. During
assembly, output of messages, listings,
etc to the list device will follow the
mode set by commands *printon and
*printoff whilst the treatment of errors
will be deﬁned by *fatal and *nonfatal.
Assembly may be halted at any time
by pressing the RUN/STOP key.
Assembler control commands:
*disk: Sets assembler disk mode.
Source code is expected from disk and
output is to a disk ﬁle. (see *assem).
*mem: Sets assembler memory mode.
Source code is expected in memory
and output is to memory.
*fatal: I f  an error is encountered
during assembly, the assembler will
stop.
*nonfatal: If an error is encountered
during assembly, i t is displayed but
assembly continues with the next line
of source code. Note that output is still
C64 PROGRAM
•
produced in this mode but it should
be noted that the program may not
run correctly.
Information and editing commands:
*rennin: Renumber a source program
in memory starting at 10 and going
up in steps of 10.
*symbols: Display the symbols listing
from the last assembly operation.
*show: Show the mode of operation.
This will show the assembly, error and
list device modes as well as device
selections.
*help: L i s ts  a l l  t h e  available
commands.
*reset: Set the ASM system to default
startup mode. All values are set to
default states: i.e. printer off, fatal
error mode, memory assembly.
*info: Display assembly information
from last assembly operation.
*scat: Display source device directory.
*cleat: Display destination device
directory.
Device control commands:
*source: Sets source device. Argument
is the device number which must be
in range 8 to 11.
*dest: Sets destination device. Argu-
ment is the device number which must
be in range 8 to 1
*scmd: Send a command to source
device. The command must be i n
quotes. e.g. *scmd “n0:diskl,d1" will
format a disk.
*dcmd: Same as *scmd but for the
destination device.
*serr: Display device error for source
device.
*derr: Display device error for desti-
nation device.
*printon: Enable printer output.
Argument is the select code for the list
device (4 or 5).
*printoff: Disable printer output.
Note that certain functions such as
listings are controlled from within a
source program; e.g. sym, 1st. (see
directives).

Errors and their meanings
The following is a list of the various
error messages which may be printed
during assembly:
Undeﬁned Symbol Error:
This occurs if a symbol has been
referenced but has not been deﬁned,
Redeﬁned Symbol Error:
Occurs when a symbol is deﬁned
more than once.
Mnemonic Not Recognised:
What the assembler took to be a
mnemonic does not appear to be a
valid one.
Bad Symbol Error:
Something is wrong with a symbol.
Typically an invalid character or it is
too long.
Illegal Operand Field:
Illegal Mnemonic Field:
These two errors point to a general
syntax problem in a source code line.
Missing Operand Error:
An operand was expected but was
not found.
Disk File Error:
General failure of disk system.
Syntax Error:
A problem with a directive is likely.
Illegal Quantity Error:
Some overrange condition has
occurred, typically a 16-bit value in a
byte mode instruction.
Illegal Addressing Mode:
An instruction was used i n  an
incorrect way.
Not X or Y Index:
Only X and Y index registers are
valid.
Symbol Table Full:
Pretty fatal one this. It indicates
that the space set aside for symbols
has been exceeded.
Branch Range Error:
Branch instructions are relative
and may only operate within a certain
range.
Linkﬁle name length error:
The argument to an Ink directive
is too long.
Linkﬁle name missing:
The argument isn't there at all!
Bad directive in memory mode:
You have used some directive not
valid in memory mode.
Bad directive in disk mode:
You have used some directive not
valid in disk mode,
Cannot open another linkﬁle:
Trapping error message when you
try to link another ﬁle whilst already
linked.

Things to look out for...
YOUR COMMODORE june 1989

When ASM is installed and running,
the following information is relevant.
The Basic chrget code is diverted to
a new routine within the ASM code
to allow the inclusion o f the new
commands. The program loads like a
Basic program into memory starting
at address $0801. When it has been
run, the start of Basic is shifted up
to about $2500. You may still type any
Basic direct command such as LOAD,
SAVE, POKE, etc but caution is
advised using POKE on addresses
between $0801 and $2500.
In both memory and disk modes,
code is edited above about $2500. In
memory mode, the symbol table begins
in memory after the source program.
This also applies in disk mode hence
any program i n  memory will be
preserved. This means that you should
type 'new' before commencing a disk
mode assembly to maximise symbol
space. During assembly, the BASIC
ROM is switched out. The space from
$C000 to SCFFF is left free. Symbols
thus occupy the space from the end
of any program in memory up to
SUFF.
ASM should co-exist peacefully
with the Basic interpreter. The *reset
command may be used to  resolve
certain situations where the system is
not operating correctly. However it
has a limited effect, and it may become
necessary to powerdown should the
system still operate incorrectly.
ASM is source code compatible
with my earlier FCL system assembler
published in a previous Your Commo-
dore and also my PLUS4 assembler.
AS M's facilities are in effect, a superset
of the FCL assembler's facilities and
ASM could therefore replace the FCL
assembler if desired.
To help you become familiar with
the system, I  have included some
example source ﬁles/listing which may
be assembled using ASM. The com-
ment ﬁelds at the beginning indicate
which mode they should be run in.
Good luck!

O R G  Set code origin. In disk mode
- also sets code load address.
e.g. org $COIA
R E S  Reserve memory.
e.g. res 60 (reserve 60 bytes)
1 S T  Causes assembler to list during

bling.
e.g. ink "symbols asm"
R E L  Relocation offset. The code
origin is set by the org direc-
tive. This directive allows you
to assemble code to run at one
address (org) whilst being sent
to another memory area (rel).

a casual disk user from a pro-
fessional. Once you can edit
disks, a whole world of seemingly im-
possible tasks becomes possible. Files
can be locked, unscratched, closed,
relocated, and renamed when you have
the commands and the know-how.
Firstly, a word o f warning: don't
edit a disk with important programs
on it, unless you know what you're
doing. Use unwanted disks for prac-
tice, and take backups o f valuable
disks. A good Disk Editor will make
things a lot easier: you have no need
for complex commands. There is a
good example in the December 1987
edition of Your Commodore. This is
not essential though - you can make
do with the commands and DISPLAY
T&S on the demo disk you got with
your drive.
Commands
The commands regarding direct disk
access are called the Block commands
(a Block is another name for a Sector).

Your disk drive manual contains more
detailed explanations, but a summary
follows.
To use these commands, you'll
need to have two ﬁles open - one for
commands and the other to a buffer
for data. The command channel you
will probably be familiar with:
OPENI5,8,15
The data channel can be any other
number, but 5 or 2 are usually used:
OPEN5,8,5," "
After th e se  o p e n  commands.
PRINT 1 5  will send commands, and
PRINT 5  will send data to  the
channel.
Note that when 'drive' is menti-
oned, this means 0 for a single drive.
The device is usually 8, but can be
changed. See the examples on the disk
for more information.
Block-Read
SYNTAX: P R I N T  1 5 , "B - R :";
channel;
drive;
track;
sector;
This command transfers the required
sector into the data channel (in our
case 5). Then use the GET 5  com-
mand to read the information into a
variable.
It's important to note that Block-
Read will only read up as far as the
Block-Pointer, which is usually O. The
USER I command is usually used, as
this sets the pointer to 255 automat-
ically, allowing the sector to be read
in one operation.
USER1
SYNTAX: P R I N T  1 5 , " U  I:";
channel;
drive;
track;
sector;
Block-Write
SYNTAX: P R I N T  #15,"B-W:":
channel;
drive;
C64 PR O G R A MMIN G
track;
sector;
To use this command, ﬁll up the
channel with information to  write,
using PRINT 5 ,  then use the com-
mand to write to the required sector.
This is the exact opposite of Block-
Read, so again USER2 is usually used.
USER2
SYNTAX: P R I N T  1 5 . "1 1 2 :";
channel;
Block-Pointer
drive;
track;
sector;
SYNTAX: P R I N T  At IS, "B - P :";
channel;
location
By using this command, you can
specify where exactly in the sector you
want the next read or write to begin.
This allows you to  read o r  alter
individual bytes in a sector, starting
at 'location'. See the Disk Name
program for a demo.
Block-Allocate
SYNTAX: PRINT 1 5 , "B-A:"; drive;
track;
sector;
This allocates a  bit i n  the Block
Availability Map to show a sector is
in use. It is used in connection with
random access databases.
Block-Free
SYNTAX: PRINT 1 5 , "B-F:"; drive;
track;
sector;
This is the opposite of Block-Allocate,
and frees up sectors for use without
destroying the actual data on them.
If save is made, the data will probably
be overwritten, as the B A M  has
marked the sector as empty.

Disk Maps
Before you can use these commands,
you will need some information on
disk structure. The maps will provide
this information, and information on
ﬁle structure.
Editing
Protect File
Disk Name
There are a number of ﬁles provided
here for demonstration purposes. The
best way to learn is to study these
programs with the maps close at hand.
They are heavily R E Med, but here are
some notes explaining what's going on.
Even if you don't learn anything, they
are useful utilities to have.
This program 'locks' (i.e. prevents it
from being scratched) the ﬁrst ﬁle on
a disk by setting bit 6 of the ﬁle type
to I, effectively °Ring it with SCO.
This prevents accidental erasure, and
has a  b e s i d e  its name i n  the
directory. By adding 32 to the last
pointer number, and changing the
sector number, any program in the
directory may be protected.
This allows you to change the name
of the disk without erasing the con-
tents. It makes use of the fact that the
disk name is stored at byte 144, track
18, sector O.
Load Address
This changes the load address of any
program to a given address. It searches
for the ﬁrst sector of storage, and bytes
2+3 contain the load address. It is most
useful with sprite data.
Unscratch
On scratching a ﬁle, the ﬁletype in the
directory is merely marked as being
deleted. This program searches the
disk fo r a  scratched program and
restores the ﬁletype, resurrecting the
ﬁle. You are advised to  save the
unscratched program to another disk
in case of another accident. Note that
this will probably not work if some-
thing has been saved to the disk since
the SCRATCH, as it may have been
saved over the old program. Enjoy
your disk editing!

O
machine code programs with
an assembler is that you can
declare labels for jumps and branches.
An example o f  this i s "Speedy
Assembler", written by yours truly,
and still available from Readers' Ser-
vices for everybody who wants to get
into serious machine code prog-
ramming!
Instead of having to give jumps and
subroutine calls as absolute addresses,
and having to  calculate relative
branches, you simply declare a label
on the left-hand side at the start of
the routine to be jumped or branched
to, and the assembler does the rest.
It stores the label in what is called the
symbol table
location at that point next to it,
Later on, when it ﬁnds that label
next to a jump or branch instruction,
it fetches the address from the symbol
table and, i n  case o f  a jump o r
subroutine call, assembles i t as the
location to be jumped or to be called
or, in the case of a branch instruction.
calculates the length of the branch. The
programmer doesn't have to trouble
himself with any of this. Nor does he
have t o  g o  t o  th e  trouble o f
calculating branches. Instead he just
attaches a  name to  the routine o r
subroutine in question.
And what's more, labels like this
add tremendously to the readability of
the program, because you can give
each routine and subroutine a name
that suits you. This helps quite a bit
when a  bug has developed i n  the

program (and doesn't it always!), and
the programmer has to  spend ages
ﬁnding it!
Labels in Basic
Because of all this, I felt for a long
time that it would be nice to be able
to use labels like this in Basic programs
too. N o  more memorizing o f  line
numbers, and, most of all, no more
renumbering of GOTO's and GOS-
U B's whenever one changes the
program.
It is actually surprisingly easy to
introduce such a facility to the rather
poverty-stricken Commodore 6 4
Basic. In the last article of this series
we've developed a  routine which
allows us to give GOTO and GOSUB
with variable names, So we've already
got the basic facility to labelize jumps
and subroutine calls, but we still have
to declare the value of the label at the
beginning of the program with a line

like: "Subroutine 1000". To do this
job for us, the computer has to build
a symbol table of sorts, and this has
to be done before the program is
actually run. This is because, during
execution, when a GOTO or GOSUB
is encountered, the computer has to
know where to jump to.
You m a y  k n o w  t h a t  m o s t
assemblers are called "Tw o  Pass
Assemblers". This is because in order
to deal with jumps and branches, the
assembler has to do its job in two gos.
First it goes through the whole of the
textﬁle and builds the symbol table,
and then it has a second go in which
it is able to assemble the source in
earnest.
To use labels to the full in Basic,
we have to do a similar thing. Before
the program is run in earnest, the
computer has to sift through the whole
of the textﬁle and collect all the line
numbers to which it has to GOTO and
GOSUB later on. This means that it

1
takes a bit of time until running proper
starts. But I don't think that this is
a major handicap, and it certainly is
worth it!
Running a Basic Program
So we have to  intercept the RUN
command. To do this, let's look ﬁrst
of all a bit closer at what it does under
normal circumstances.
After you've typed in your Basic
program and then given the RUN
command to execute your program,
the Basic interpreter jumps to  the
routine at SA871. Figure 1 gives you
a disassembly of that routine.
First the ﬂag register is saved on
the stack. Then a call to a Kernal
routine is made. This routine puts the
computer into the direct run mode by
loading the system variable $9D with
zero and setting ST, which is the status
variable.
Then the ﬂag register is pulled from
the -
one, that is, i f the last value in the
accumulator has been zero, then there
were no parameters with the RUN
command. In  this case the routine
continues, otherwise it branches for-
ward, because a line number has been
given with RUN.
If no line number is given with
RUN the routine jumps to the CLR
routine and doesn't return. I f  a line
number has been given with RUN, the
routine calls on the CLR routine and
then jumps to  the GOTO routine,
because in the end, RUN 100 is similar
to GOTO 100. The only difference is
that RUN clears all the Basic variables,
while GOTO leaves them untouched.
The CLR routine clears all the
Basic variables and gives Basic a fresh
start, so that variables and arrays can
be built up anew. This is mainly done
by setting the string storage pointer
and the array storage pointer to the
end of the Basic textﬁle, because, as
you might know, Basic stores all the
variables and arrays declared i n  a
program directly after the end of the
textﬁle,
Modiﬁed RUN
Our modiﬁed RUN routine starts at
line 1520 (Listing I). First we deal with
the RUN command more or less in
the same way as the ROM routine.
That is, we set the Kernal ﬂags to the
direct run mode (line 1520-1530), and
then we clear the Basic variables (line
1540).
PROGRAMMING
I haven't bothered about RUN line
number, so this won't work with the
routine as i t is. I f  you give a  line
number with RUN, i t will just be
ignored. But nevertheless, i f you do
want th i s little-used facility, i t
shouldn't be impossible for you to add
it with the help of the explanation of
the normal RUN routine, which I've
given above.
Next, we set zero page 254/ 255 to
the start of the Basic textﬁle (line 1580-
1610). Zero page locations 251 to 255
are never used by the Commodore
operating system, so these locations
are absolutely safe to be used for your
own purposes. There are many other
zero page locations which are used by
the Kernal or the Basic interpreter, but
which are usually quite safe to use. For
example, if you don't do any ﬂoating
point arithmetic, you may use loca-
tions $61 to $6F without any trouble.
But the point is always to think before
you use a zero page variable, otherwise
the system might do very funny things
indeed!
After that we go into the main loop
(SEARCHLP), whch looks at each
Basic line to see if it contains a label
(line 1630-1810). To  understand
SEA RCHLP, here is a short expla-
nation of how a Basic line is stored
in memory:
First of all the line number is given
in the usual low byte/ high byte
fashion. Next there are two bytes
%rhich contain the so-called link
pointer. Each link pointer points to
the beginning of the next line. This
makes it very easy to search through
a Basic textﬁle, because you just have
to jump from one link pointer to the
other, each time looking at the line
number preceding it, and in next to
no time you've found the line you're
looking for.
Each Basic line is ﬁnished with a
zero, which is the standard terminator
used by Commodore (strings too are
always terminated with zero!). At the
end of the textﬁle there will be two
zeros in the locations where otherwise
the next line number would be. So this
is how the computer will know when
it has reached the end of the textﬁle.
If you look at SEARCHLP in our
program, you'll ﬁnd the routine testing
for those two zeros right a t the
beginning of the loop (line 1630-1680).
Declaring a Label
Naturally we have to tell the computer
when it has found a label. For that
YOUR COMMODORE june 1989
67
we have to make a label stand out in
some way.
To do this I  have chosen the
following way of declaring a label: a
label has to be at the beginning of a
line, after the line number, and it has
to be preceded by a full stop. Of course,
you are free to  experiment with
methods which might suit you better,
because this is the whole purpose of
this series o f articles, to enable you
to develop extended Basic routines
which suit your particular needs!
Anyhow, in the routine given, the
computer looks for a full stop and that
tells him that it has found a label (line
1690-1720). So it jumps to the routine
which I  called LABLFOUND. First
of all the current location in the textﬁle
is saved in PA/ 7B, so that afterwards
the computer can continue searching
the texElle for more labels (line 1960-
'990).
Then it goes forward ﬁve bytes to
point at the label itself (line 2000-2060).
Remember, all we are doing here is
a simple LET operation, like, "LET
LABEL = IOW" (or "LABEL = 1000"
if you omit the LET). So the next
ROM routine ($1308B) w e  ca l l
‘ralidates our label, that is, ﬁnds out
if it is a permitted variable name (as
you know, a valid Basic variable name
has to start with a letter).
If the name is valid, the ﬁrst two
characters o f i t are stored i n  the
variable area, which starts immediately
after the end of the Basic textﬁle. On
return from $B0813, the low byte of
the variable location is in the accum-
ulator, and the high byte is in the Y-
Register. We store this in zero page
$49/ 4A which is the system variable
pointer (line 2110-2120).
Next we get the line number and
store it in zero page $62/63, which is
the ﬂoating point accumulator # 1
(line 2160-2210). The next routine
($13399) which we call converts the line
number into a proper ﬂoating point
number (line 2250). We have to do it
in this rather roundabout way because
variables of this type have to be stored
as ﬂoating point numbers in order to
be recognized later on!
Finally we call SBBDO (line 2260),
which stores the value contained in ﬂp
accu # I in the variable area itself.
Now our label has been stored like any
other Basic variable in the variable
store, including the number of the line
on which it appeared. We can return
to our main search loop and look for
the next label.
The fact that each of the labels we

declare is stored like any other Basic
variable means, of course, that only
the ﬁrst two characters of the label will
be recognized. The rest of the label
is ignored, which limits the use of labels

Therefore, in the next article I'd
like to develop a routine which builds

well as normal decimal values,
and where do ﬂoating point numbers
come into it?
David Kennedy, Easingwold
Dear David.
Another term for an integer is a 'whole
number' or, as you point Out, a number
without any decimal point. Other
numbers are referred to as 'ﬂoating
point' numbers because of the way in
which the mathematics is performed
in the computer's memory. Floating
point calculations are difﬁcult t o
explain in the space allowed here but,
luckily, the fact that they do work is
all that you really need to know for
Basic.
The reason that computers use
integers is because it helps to speed-
up arithmetic, and is more accurate
than ﬂoating points where a certain
amount of rounding up and down of
values occurs. The speed beneﬁt is
gained because there is no need to
calculate the position of the decimal
place, or to check if the value should
be expressed i n  exponential form,
where an extremely large o r small
number is expressed by a value, and
the power to which it has to be raised
to reveal the actual number.
A popular myth is that integers use
less memory than ﬂoating point
values, but this is not entirely true.
Integers use four bytes -  two for the
variable name, and two for the actual
number. Floating point numbers
similarly use two bytes for the variable
name, but ﬁve more bytes are needed
for the value. So, on the face of it,

integers do need less space, but the
integer value is followed b y three
unused bytes, which means that both
types o f variable physically occupy
seven bytes of memory.
lbought the Your Commodore
.1 Serious Users Guide 1988. and
found the 64 tips for the 64 quite
informative. One of the tips is how to
simulate a PRINT AT conunand with-
out using rows of cursor downs and
lefts. I  thought that you may be
interested in a technique that I've been
using for the past few .
10 P O K E 2 1 4 , 9 : P R I N T " E U P :
2 0  P O K E 2 1 1 , 1 5
30 P R I N T " H E L L O "
Location 214 is the vertical posi-
tion of the cursor on the screen (value
1 to 24). The PRINT command in line
10 is used to update this new row in
the Commodore's memory, and a cur-
sor up to replace the cursor onto the
required line. Next the cursor is placed
horizontaltv by poking a value to lo-
cation 211 and the message can then
be printed.
Two ﬁnal wordy on this routine re-
late to printing on the top and bottom
lines. For using the top line, printing
a cursor home with a semicolon will
set the row position and then the
column value can be poked into 211.
If the last line is used the screen will
scroll up unless you follow the message
printing command with a semicolon.
I  hope this is of use to someone,
somewhere.
Carol Seddon, Wigan
Dear Carol,
Thanks very much for that tip. I found
it very informative, and if anyone else
has a technical tip I'd be very pleased
to hear about it.

Could y ou explain wha t i t
achieves?
Clive Fowler, Midhurst
Dear Clive,
T
h his is an unusual b u t useful
1„ application of a comparison com-
mand. It is the sort of routine which
would convert a decimal value to its
hexadecimal equivalent.
To understand how it works, I'll
have to explain the principle behind
the greater than and less than com-
mands. When a comparison is made,
the result is a zero if the condition is
false and a minus one if the condition
is true.
In the example that you've supp-
lied, the value given by the comparison
would be zero if X had a value between
zero and nine but minus one i f the
value exceeds nine. What the equation
is doing is taking the value in A and
adding 48 to give a value whose CH RS
equivalent is the number character
which corresponds to X. This works
well up to a value of nine, but values
10 to 15 would produce punctuation
marks and symbols because there is
a gap of seven characters between the
CHRS value for nine and the C H M
value for the letter A. The program
has to be able to add seven to values
over 10, but not to values below that.
The solution is to compare the
value with nine, and then multiply this
by seven. This would mean that the
low values would subtract zero from
the CHR$ value but high values would
subtract -7  (-I multiplied b y  7).
Subtracting a negative value follows
the mathematical law that states that
two minuses gives a  plus, so the
program actually adds seven to the
CHR$ value.
To test this try setting up a loop
for A having values of zero to 15. Place
the equation inside the loop and a
statement to print each HEX$ value,
and the result will he a list o f hex
equivalents from 0 to F.
pave written a program which uses
1  several groups of DATA statements
but the only problem with it is that
RESTORE can't be set to point to a
particular line. Is there any easy way
around this, because at the moment
have to RESTORE and then read
YOUR COMMODORE june 1989

in DATA until the correct point is
reached?
Harry Ivy, Hampton
Dear Harry,
There are two ways to tackle your
problem. The ﬁrst is to read the data
into se' ,ral arrays and manipulate
these instead of using data READs.
The second method is to create a
special form of the RESTORE com-
mand. This is done by reading in the
data until the line where the program
is to be restored to, The actual memory
location can be stored b y peeking
locations 65 and 66 and storing this
in a table in a safe part of memory.
Each suitable point is similarly
stored until the table is complete.
When the data reading has to be re-
stored to any of these points, they can
be peeked from their storage point and
poked back to 65 and 66:
c'fan you tell me where I can ﬁnd
a good book containing a break-
down of the C128 Basic ROMs?1 have
a hunch that such a book may not
exist, because I  have a book which
gives a breakdown of the Kemal, but
which states that the Basic disassembly
would ﬁll a very large volume.
Richard Trey, York
Dear Richard,
You'll be pleased to hear that such a
book does actually exist, though you
are right i n  assuming that i t is a
weighty tome. Cl28 Bask 7.0 Inter-
nals, published by Abacus, runs to
over 600 pages. O f  this, 450 pages
contain an annotated ROM disassem-
bly, and the rest is packed with useful
information about the workings of the
system, alongside some useful pro-
gramming hints and routines. The
price is i16.95, and it is available from
Precision Software, 6 Park Terrace,
Worcester Park, Surrey KT4 7JZ, but
please include E1.40 fo r  post and
packing.

r r  he ﬁrst major task is getting the
SQ-2500 out of the box - ideally,
it's a job for two people. The SQ-2500
might be expensive, but it has a wide
carriage and you certainly get a lot of
printer for your money. Styling is
recognisably Epson, but the greatest
impression from the ﬁrst is that this
printer oozes quality. Construction is
superb. I didn't actually try it, but I'm
sure I  could jump on the SQ-2500
without damaging it (and I weigh over
16 stones).
Setting it up
This is an ink-jet printer so there's no
ribbon, just an ink cartridge, paper
feed knob, the mains lead and paper
guide. Open a cover on the right side
towards the rear of the printer, push
in the ink cartridge, close the cover
and that's done. On the left side is a
similar cover, but unless you want to
use either of the possible two extra font
cartridges, you needn't open it.
The interface and power lead
connect at the rear, as usual for Epson,
and the power switch is on the right
side. The paper guide easily slots into
position, and when an new ink car-
tridge is ﬁtted, the SQ needs priming
(this is the long cleaning cycle men-
tioned later, but it just means switch
on and press a button). After about
half a minute it's ready to go.
Both parallel and a serial interface
are standard, with provision for a third
one, and any o f  the extra Epson
interfaces (listed in the LQ-500 report)
can be used too. The standard buffer
is 8K. The manual is 170 pages, in
contrast to the LQ's 230, but contains
all the necessary ingredients, including
both types of command summary and
a quick reference card.
If you can afford an SQ, buy one!
If you do, don't waste time looking
for dip-switches -  there aren't any!
Four buttons (and one of those is on
off line) control EVERYTHING!!
This explains the short manual.
There's very little on trouble-shooting.
PRINTERS
THE EPSON *2500
To conclude last month:y feature on the world
of 24 pin dot matrix printers,
Robin Burton admires the highly impressive
Epson SQ-2500
The only way I can envisage anyone
having trouble with the SQ is if they
can't read, in which case the manual
wouldn't help much.
I'm not being ﬂippant! It's all set-
up, and manual selection is by question
and answer, but with a  difference.
There's a liquid crystal display at the
front of the printer next to the selection
buttons, and the SQ asks the ques-
tions. You answer by simply pressing
a button, and the settings are stored.
This is a dream machine.
Superb though this is, there's more!
The SQ also has four macros. Each
of these is a complete, permanently
stored deﬁnition containing everything
you could want the printer to know
about a job. Any one of the four can
be loaded automatically at power-up:
you choose which one you want in the
conﬁguration defaults, which remain
permanently set unless you alter them.
You can manually load any macro
by a couple of button presses, and can
also amend them manually, by soft-
ware or both, either temporarily, or
permanently. Simply re-save a macro
at any time (by pressing a button) if
you want the changes to be permanent.
If not, they're forgotten, either when
you switch off or when you load a
different macro. You might also want
to print out the settings, in which case
- press a button.
This is all so comprehensive yet
simple that describing it is difﬁcult. I've
therefore included a  print o f  my
conﬁguration settings separately, so
you can see for yourself. Everything
is stored - left and right margins, font,
style, pitch, page size, etc, etc.
YOUR COMMODORE itine 1989

As standard, the SQ-2500 is a cut
sheet machine, but an optional tractor
unit can be added fo r continuous
paper. You may have gathered by now
that the SQ-2500 is intended for high
quality, high speed, high volume
output. The fact that the tractor is top-
mounted and therefore without paper
parking is, in context, irrelevant.
Don't misunderstand -  swapping
between continuous and sheet-feed is
easy enough, but i f you need to do
it very often you don't need an SQ-
2500. It wasn't built for the average
home user's mixed low-volume needs,
and used that way would be like doing
the grocery shopping in a Formula
One ear, theoretically possible but...
If cut sheet is the major use a
double-bin automatic sheet feeder can
also be attached.
Speciﬁcation
The SQ-2500 is of course above all an
Epson, so the compatibility comments
for the LQ-500 all apply to the SQ,
including the 13 national character
sets.
Six fonts are standard for the SQ-
2500, each as usual with italic. Addi-
tional effects are limited to  double
width, double height or both. All fonts
are available in the usual 10, 12 and
15 cpi, and all can be condensed except
15 pitch.
There's also provision for two font
modules, but so far as I could see all
the Epson LQ fonts are standard in
the SQ except OCR-B. Minimum
vertical spacing is in 180ths of an inch,
and horizontal is in 360ths.

When the SQ powers-up it automat-
ically goes through a  self-cleaning
cycle. The printer informs you (via the
LCD) when the ink cartridge is getting
low, and when it's exhausted. Accord-
ing to the manual, a cartridge lasts for
3,000,000 characters i n  L Q, and
6,000,000 in draft. This seems fair
enough - I've gone through well over
1,500 sheets, largely in 1.Q, (roughtly
6,000,000 characters) and not a word
so far.
Using semi-automatic sheet feed is
simple and quick, and i t has been
absolutely reliable with all weights of
paper. Just drop a sheet into the guide,
press 'form feed' and the sheet is lined
up perfectly (I even tried it with a 9
x 4  inch envelope n o to r i o u s l y
difﬁcult to  keep straight -  with no
trouble at all).
If the tractor is ﬁtted, i t simply
attaches on top of the SQ - there are
no covers to change. Usefully, along
with the tractor, Epson provide a
matching base on which the printer
sits. Continuous paper is kept inside
this, out of the way. A paper rest is
also included to keep the paper clear
of the leads.
Manual line feed, form feed, self-
test and hex. dump are controlled by
the buttons, and the self test includes
the current conﬁguration and macro
settings too. As mentioned before, just
the conﬁguration and the four macros
can also be listed on demand (or
alternatively checked directly via the
LCD). Without altering any o f the
current settings you also can switch
between draft or LQ at any time by
pressing either the line-feed o r the
form-feed button,
Print quality is frankly so superior
to that of an impact dot-matrix printer
that a comparison is pointless. Because
there are no wires pressing through a
fabric ribbon, the individual dots are
much smaller and more precise. rve
PRINTERS
even asked when I  bought a laser-
printer by people who didn't know I
had the SQ. It might not be quite that
good, but it's obviously near enough,
and you'd have to put the two side
by side to notice a difference. Also
unlike any impact printer, the quality
never varies. There's no deterioriation
or fading o f print quality, because
there's no ribbon to wear out. Char-
acters are always perfect, and uni-
formly sooty black.
The SQ is the fastest matrix printer
I've ever seen. The ﬁgures don't
adequately tell the story -  you have
to see it to appreciate just how quick
it is. In fact its speed was at one point
an inconvenience. With such dense
character images, double strike is
almost unnecessary. Of course I tried
it, but output was quick enough to
allow the paper to  re-fold i n  the
collection basket before the ink had
fully dried. I  have now lowered the
basket.
The ﬁnal difference about the SQ
is noise, speciﬁcally the absence of it
- only ink touches the paper. You don't
realise just how much you are mentally
conditioned to brace yourself for the
onslaught o f noise from an impact
printer, at least not until you start
printing and i t doesn't happen. It's
rather uncanny at ﬁrst, and after years
of impact printers, it took me a week
to get used to this. Needless to say the
SQ easily passes the telephone test, in
fact if you were surrounded by them
it would be no problem.
Quite aside from its obvious desir-
ability, this aspect of the SQ's perfor-
mance (along with the others) offers
very serious beneﬁts for ofﬁces where
several printers are at work. I would
think the amount of noise from the
SQ (just the carriage moving back and
forth) would be acceptable even in
places like libraries and hospitals too.
The SQ-2500 has operated per-
fectly throughout.
YOUR COMMODORE june 1989

Conclusion
It hardly needs saying that the SQ-
2500 is Epson's top-of-the range
conventional dot matrix printer, and
it has been for a few years now. It
is built like the Forth Bridge, and has
by far the easiest manual control of
all operational features of any printer
I know. Macros are excellent, and
allow an automated switch between
four completely different set-up deﬁ-
nitions in literally a couple of seconds.
Of course the recent arrival of low-
cost laser printers must have eroded
SQ sales, but there are still plenty of
jobs that laser printers don't do very
well or at all, (like printing A3 pages
sideways), and their running costs are
also higher than the SQ's. One laser
printer limitation however is shared by
the SQ-2500. Because it's not an
impact device, multi-part sets are
impossible. though with its speed
you'd probably just print extra copies
as needed.
In its target market, I doubt that
the SQ-2500 has any competition.
Quality is beyond question in con-
struction, operation and output. I t
must be the fastest, quietest way of
getting high quality print onto paper,
with all the ﬂexibility of a conventional
printer and a  virtual absence o f
operator skill or training.
The recommended retail price is
t  1,349. Options include a tractor unit
at E90 and a  double-bin automatic
sheet feeder a t E370. (E1,551.35,
£103.50 and £425.50 including VAT.)
Ink cartridges are about E24, and have
a shelf life of two years.
Checking current advertisements I
found that the SQ-2500 can be pur-
chased for around E975 plus VAT,
with proportional reductions in the
optional ﬁttings.

Gordon Davis examines
a rare specimen - an
80- column graphics
package for C128 owners
S
Almost all Graphics packages
for the C128D operate in 40-
column high-resolution mode, but this
one is different - it offers a full graphics
capability in 80-column mode -  a
resolution of 640 pixels horizontally.
The package has been made pos-
sible by the release of Walrusoft's Basic
8, a  language package which we
reviewed last year. Basic 8 is designed
as a language which offers a graphics-
orientated environment to the system
designer. It's no surprise, therefore,
that the salient features of Sketchpad
are exactly those which Basic 8
supports most readily.
A Commodore 1351 mouse is a
necessity for Sketchpad. This, 1 think,
0)
C128 REVIEW
Little messing
is unfortunate, since it isn't the sort
of item that Commodore owners are
likely to just have hanging around.
Although, as the authors point out,
a mouse is by far the best device for
doing graphics, it would have cost little
to allow a joystick to be interfaced with
the program, just to get people started.
Fortunately, we managed to ﬁnd the
ofﬁce's 1351 mouse, so that play could
begin. There's very little messing
around following loading. Sketchpad
moves straight into the drawing screen
following the obligatory Basic 8
loading screen.
Free Spirit, which, as you might
guess, is a Californian software house,
has obviously done its Apple Macin-
tosh homework. The main screen
looks very Mac-like. All menu selec-
tions are made from the drawing
screen by clicking the left mouse
button. The right button is reasonably
consistent in returning the user to the
main menu.
YOUR COMMODORE june 1989

The main elements on the main
menu are exactly those which have
been made familiar by that seminal
program, MacPaint. Naturally, you
can draw freehand on the screen with
a variety of  different pens. The
indispensable airbrush is also there.
The annoying thing about this is that
the airbrush area cannot be sized,
which is something that you can see
even with C64 packages.
Sketchpad supports a suitably fast
ﬁll. This is a little worrying in the way
it operates, since it seems to leave many
lines unﬁlled along the way. But never
fear, the ﬁlling algorithm gets back and
ﬁlls them all back in too.
A multi-font option for writing is
also available. Different fonts can be
loaded from disk, and can be typed
anywhere on the screen in one of ﬁve
different sizes. A useful touch is that
Return will align the text cursor
exactly one line below the text you've
already put in.
This is not a multi-colour graphics
program, quite rightly, because unless
you are designing loading screens or
demos, anything other than two-
colour screens is functionally useless

for all owners of black-and-white
printers. Even so, you can alter the
foreground/background to give you
more screen readability.
Although clearing the screen is
fairly deadly on Sketchpad -  there is
no check on this, you can lock your
program into memory, which will put
it into a spare area of Ram for safety.
This is also useful if you're uncertain
about the changes you're making to
a picture.
The graphics shapes options are the
ones that show the most difference
over most graphics packages. All the
traditional favourites are there: lines,
boxes, circles, and so on. Producing
these is more or less as straightforward
as the commands on any other gra-
phics package. A unique extra, how-
ever, is the addition of the so-called
Rylander shapes.

Solid graphics
Rylander shapes are views of shaded
solids of three types: cylinder, sphere
and torus. They are named after the
programmer who designed a  set of
C128 REVIEW
algorithms for representing them
easily.
Basic 8 later incorporated these
calculations, and here they are at last
in a graphics package. The shading on
the Rylander shapes can be varied
between pixel dots or zonal shading,
and whatever you use them for, they
are an interesting addition.
Besides these shapes, another
useful feature is the inclusion of arcs.
You can provide arcs of any pitch and
angle. Rays can also be provided,
subtended at any angle from a central
point. Both of these make the produc-
tion of piecharts an easy matter.
One vital thing I spent ages looking
for was some form of Zoom option.
It's very uncertain using a graphics
package, and some means of adjusting
things on a pixel-by-pixel basis can be
useful. This is, annoyingly, not avail-
able from the main screen, but from
a sub-menu called the Gadgets menu.
Besides a pixel zoom, Gadgets also
supports a Cut/ Paste option which
allows you to move chunks of the
picture around, or  simply remove
them. You can also scroll your picture
- an interesting feature which few
packages support. This menu also
supports a number of patterns which
can be used to ﬁll areas. Unfortunately,
you have to drop the clip patterns in
yourself -  there is no automatic ﬁll
for these.
Free Spirit deserves compliment-
ing for the number of features which
have been included in Sketchpad -  I
haven't covered everything here. The
main ﬂaw in the program is that it
is a triﬂe slow, due to being written
entirely in Basic 8.
I'm also not sure about some of
the design priorities -  some of the
essentials are very hard to get to. The
program documentation is brief and
unhelpful. These days, this is some-
thing I expect software houses to get
right. On the other hand, C128 80-
column drawing packages are fairly
hard to come by, so it seems unfair
to cavil too much.

A bubbly routine
to sort lists into
orderly sequences
By Eric Doyle
YOUR COMMODORE june 1989
76
p
numbers or strings which have
to he displayed in an orderly
way. This could be alphabetically or
numerically. This bubble sort subrou-
tine can be used, suitably modiﬁed, for
either purpose.
Bubble sorts work by comparing
neighbouring list items and swapping
them over i f one exceeds the other.
Take this list as an example:
The ﬁrst number is compared to the rest of the numbers in the list one
at a time. If the number under comparison is smaller than the ﬁrst number,
a straight swap takes place. In this way the smallest value rises to the top.
After this process is completed, the second number is compared to all
of the following ﬁgures in a similar way.
This is repeated, grad-
ually passing down the
column until the last two
characters are compared
and swapped if necessary,
and th e  so rt i s  then
complete.

The two elements of the sort are a loop
which selects the character to be tested,
and a loop within this, a nested loop,
which selects the remaining characters
in the list for comparison.

E 0 2 0 0  F 0 R 2 1 - 1 T 0 2 - 1
5 0 2 1 0  2 2 - 2 1 + 1
6 0 2 2 0  F 0 R Z 3 = 2 2 T 0 2
The value Z is the number of items
in the list. Line 60200 forms the main
loop for the character to be tested. It
only runs from the ﬁrst to the master
penultimate character because there
would be no point in comparing the
ﬁnal character with itself.
Line 60210 calculates the ﬁrst
character to be tested by the nested
loop which is initiated in line 60220.
Line 60230 tests the two values, and
if they are already in the correct order
no action is taken and the exchange
routine is bypassed.
60230 I F Z C Z 1 ) < 2 1
If an exchange is necessary, this is done
by using a temporary store for one of
the values, so that values can be
swapped with ease.
E02q0 Z ( 0 ) - Z ( Z 1 )
60260 2 ( 2 1 ) = 2 ( 2 3 )
60260 Z C 2 3 ) - 2 ( 0 )
Z(0) takes the value held in Z(Z1) and
Z(Z I) can then be given the value held
in Z(Z3). The stored value can then
be moved from Z(0) to Z(Z3), and Z(0)
may then be discarded.
Now that everything has been
done, the loops can be closed and
P R O G R A MMI N G

eventually control is handed back to
the program w i th  a  R ETU R N
command.
The listings shown contain an example
of numerical sorting using this subrou-
tine and there is also an alphabetical
sort routine which shows how this
routine has to be modiﬁed for this use.
Really all that has happened is that
the Z(x) values are changed to Z$(x).

keyboard having just ﬁnished a marathon typing session
entering one o f  the superb programs from Your
Commodore. Your ﬁngers reach for the keyboard and press
the letters R, U and N. You press RETURN, sit back and
nothing happens.
. Everyone has probably faced this problem. When it does
happen it's a matter of spending hours searching through
the program for any typing mistakes. No matter how long
you look or how many people help you, you can usually
guarantee that at least one little but slips through unnoticed.
The Your Commodore Software Service makes available
all of the programs from each issue on both cassette and
disk at a price of 0.00 for disk and f4.00 for cassette.
None of the documentation for the programs is supplied
with the software since it is all available in the relevant
magazine. Should you not have the magazine then back
issues are available from the following address:
INFONET LTD. 5 River Park Estate, Berkahmsted, Herts,
HP4 IHL.
Tel: (04427) 76661
Programs on the disk will also be supplied as totally working
versions, i.e. when possible we will not use Basic Loaders
thus making use of the programs much easier. Unfortunately
at the moment we cannot duplicate C16 and Plus/ 4 cassettes.
However programs for these machines will be available on
the disk.
What programs are available?
At the top of each article you will ﬁnd a strap containing
the article type, C64 Program etc. So that you can see
which programs are available on which format, you will
also ﬁnd a couple of symbols after this strap_ The symbols
have the following meaning:
This symbol means that the program is available on cassette.
Please Note
Since the programs supplied on cassette are total working
versions of the program, we do not put disk-only programs
on tape. There is no sense in placing a program that expects
to be reading from disk on to tape.

Readers Problems
Though the Commodore 64 is one of
the vvorld's most popular microcom-
puters, it can be very difﬁcult to ﬁnd
speciﬁc information about your
particular machine.
At the Your Commodore ofﬁce we
receive literally hundreds o f letters
from you, our readers, on a wide range
of subjects ranging from the simple
Can you give me the telephone
number for...', to the more complex
I'm trying to write a program that uses
a split screen. How do I do it?'
Unfortunately, the volume of mail
received has become so great that it
is impossible to answer every letter and
still manage to publish a  magazine
each month.
For this reason we have felt i t
necessary to produce a  number o f
guidelines fo r getting information
from us:
1) We cannot guarantee to  answer
6Ti
Should i t  become apparent that a
number of readers are suffering from
the same problem, then we will reply
to the letter via the Letters page.
2) A new helpline has been set up. This
will be open fo r your queries on
Tuesday and Thursday afternoons
between 2.00pm and 4.00pm. We will
not be able to deal with our telephone
queries at any other time. If our tech-
nical adviser is not available when you
ring, then a message will be taken,
3) If you are having problems with one
of our listings, can you please let us
know in writing. This will enable us
to see if a number of people are having
the same problem. When a common
problem becomes apparent with a pro-
gram, then a correction sheet will be
issued. Enclose a  self-addressed,
stamped envelope and we will send you
a copy of the correction sheet as soon
as it is available.
We are sorry that it has become
necessary to instigate these rules. How-
ever. we are sure that you will agree
with us that the more time that we
can spend making Your Commodore
the mo st informative magazine
around, the better.

You?
At the Your Commodore ofﬁce we are
repeatedly asked for the address and
telephone number o f  Commodore

their computer manuals, believe them
to be based in Corby.
The Commodore plant at Corby was
closed down some time ago. Repro-
duced here you will ﬁnd the correct

CORRECTIONS FOR
MARCH '89
• HEAD FOR HOME
Once again those indestructible grem-
lins have caused havoc.
The program as it stands will not
run correctly. This is due to the fact
that quite a bit of code is missing from
the loader program. An amendment
is on its way. The update will be
published as soon as i t reaches our
ofﬁce. We  apologise fo r any in-
convenience to our Plus 4 readers.
CORRECTIONS FOR
APRIL '89

Unfortunately there appeared a couple
of errors in the Balance Sheet program
from the April Edition.

agraph 4 should read Load " U S W
and not Load "LIST!".

be POKE770,131:POKE771,164
3) All the REM statements should be
taken out of Listing 1.
4) Again on page 31, right hand col-
umn, paragraph I .  This should
