INTRODUCTION 
This exam is designed for candidates looking to demonstrate foundational level knowledge of cloud services 
and how those services are provided with Microsoft Azure. The exam is intended for candidates with non-
technical backgrounds, such as those involved in selling or purchasing cloud based solutions and services or 
who have some involvement with cloud based solutions and services, as well as those with a technical 
background who have a need to validate their foundational level knowledge around cloud services. Technical IT 
experience is not required however some general IT knowledge or experience would be beneficial. 
This exam can be taken as an optional first step in learning about cloud services and how those concepts are 
exemplified by Microsoft Azure. It can be taken as a precursor to Microsoft Azure or Microsoft cloud services 
exams. While it would be a beneficial first step, validating foundational level knowledge, taking this exam is not 
a pre-requisite before taking any other Azure-based certifications.

CLOUD CONCEPTS - PRINCIPLES OF CLOUD COMPUTING 
In this module, you will: 
• 
Explore common cloud computing services 
• 
Explore the benefits of cloud computing 
• 
Decide which cloud deployment model is best for you 
1.1 
WHAT IS CLOUD COMPUTING 
Cloud computing is renting resources, like storage space or CPU cycles, on another company’s computers. You 
only pay for what you use. The computing services offered tend to vary by cloud provider. 
A virtual machine (VM) is an emulation of a computer - just like your desktop or laptop you’re using now. Each 
VM includes an operating system and hardware that appears to the user like a physical computer running 
Windows or Linux. You can then install whatever software you need to do the tasks you want to run in the 
cloud. 
The difference is that you don’t have to buy any of the hardware or install the OS. The cloud provider runs your 
virtual machine on a physical server in one of their datacenters - often sharing that server with other VMs 
(isolated and secure). With the cloud, you can have a VM ready to go in minutes at less cost than a physical 
computer. 
VMs aren’t the only computing choice - there are two other popular options: containers and serverless 
computing: 
• 
Containers are similar to VMs except they don’t require a guest operating system. Instead, the application 
and all its dependencies is packaged into a “container” and then a standard runtime environment is 
used to execute the app. 
• 
Serverless computing lets you run application code without creating, configuring, or maintaining a server. 
The core idea is that your application is broken into separate functions that run when triggered by some 
action. This is ideal for automated tasks - for example, you can build a serverless process that 
automatically sends an email confirmation after a customer makes an online purchase. 
The serverless model differs from VMs and containers in that you only pay for the processing time used by 
each function as it executes. VMs and containers are charged while they’re running - even if the applications 
on them are idle. 
Here’s a diagram comparing the three compute approaches we’ve covered.

VM vs container vs serverless computing 
1.2 
BENEFITS OF CLOUD COMPUTING 
1.2.1 COST-EFFECTIVE 
Cloud computing provides a pay-as-you-go or consumption-based pricing model. Rather than paying upfront for 
a pre-defined amount of computing resources or hardware, you can rent hardware and pay for the resources 
that you actually use. 
This consumption-based model brings with it many benefits, including: 
• 
No upfront costs 
• 
No need to purchase and manage costly infrastructure that you may not use to its fullest 
• 
The ability to pay for additional resources only when they are needed 
• 
The ability to stop paying for resources that are no longer needed 
Renting infrastructure also allows for better cost prediction. 
1.2.2 SCALABLE 
Both vertical and horizontal scaling are supported, allowing to increase or decrease usage. 
Vertical scaling, also known as “scaling up”, is the process of adding resources to increase the power of an 
existing server. Some examples of vertical scaling are: adding more CPUs, or adding more memory. 
Horizontal scaling, also known as “scaling out”, is the process of adding more servers that function together as 
one unit. For example, you have more than one server processing incoming requests. 
Scaling can be done manually or automatically based on specific triggers such as CPU utilization or the number 
of requests and resources can be allocated or de-allocated in minutes. 
1.2.3 ELASTIC 
As your workload changes due to a spike or drop in demand, a cloud computing system can compensate by 
automatically adding or removing resources. 

Azure Fundamentals

1.2.4 CURRENT 
Cloud eliminates the burdens of maintaining software patches, hardware setup, upgrades, and other IT 
management tasks. 
1.2.5 RELIABLE 
Cloud computing providers offer data backup, disaster recovery, and data replication services to make sure 
your data is always safe. In addition, redundancy is often built into cloud services architecture so if one 
component fails, a backup component takes its place. This is referred to as fault tolerance and it ensures that 
your customers aren’t impacted when a disaster occurs. 
1.2.6 GLOBAL 
Cloud providers have fully redundant datacenters located in various regions all over the globe. This gives you a 
local presence close to your customers to give them the best response time possible no matter where in the 
world they are. 
You can replicate your services into multiple regions for redundancy and locality, or select a specific region to 
ensure you meet data-residency and compliance laws for your customers. 
1.2.7 SECURE 
Cloud providers offer a broad set of policies, technologies, controls, and expert technical skills that can provide 
better security than most organizations can otherwise achieve. The result is strengthened security, which helps 
to protect data, apps, and infrastructure from potential threats. 
1.3 
COMPLIANCE TERMS AND REQUIREMENTS 
When selecting a cloud provider to host your solutions, you should understand how that provider can help you 
comply with regulations and standards. 
1.4 
ECONOMIES OF SCALE 
Economies of scale is the ability to do things more efficiently or at a lower-cost per unit when operating at a 
larger scale. 
 
 

4 
1.5 
CAPITAL EXPENDITURE (CAPEX) VERSUS OPERATIONAL EXPENDITURE (OPEX) 
In the past, companies needed to acquire physical premises and infrastructure to start their business. There 
was a substantial up-front cost in hardware and infrastructure to start or grow a business. Cloud computing 
provides services to customers without significant upfront costs or equipment setup time. 
These two approaches to investment are referred to as capital expenditure and operational expenditure 
• 
Capital Expenditure (CapEx): CapEx is the spending of money on physical infrastructure up front, and 
then deducting that expense from your tax bill over time. CapEx is an upfront cost, which has a value that 
reduces over time. 
• 
Operational Expenditure (OpEx): OpEx is spending money on services or products now and being billed for 
them now. You can deduct this expense from your tax bill in the same year. There’s no upfront cost. You 
pay for a service or product as you use it.

1.6 
CLOUD DEPLOYMENT MODELS 
A cloud deployment model defines where your data is stored and how your customers interact with it – how do 
they get to it, and where do the applications run? It also depends on how much of your own infrastructure you 
want or need to manage. 
1.6.1 PUBLIC CLOUD 
There is no local hardware to manage or keep up-to-date in a public cloud – everything runs on your cloud 
provider’s hardware. 
Advantages 
Disadvantages 
High scalability/agility 
Security requirements that cannot be met by using public cloud 
Pay-as-you-go pricing 
Government policies, industry standards, or legal requirements 
which public clouds cannot meet 
Not responsible for maintenance or 
updates of the hardware 
You don’t own the hardware or services and cannot manage them 
as you may want to 
Minimal technical knowledge to set up 
and use 
Unique business requirements, such as having to maintain a 
legacy application might be hard to meet 
1.6.2 PRIVATE CLOUD 
In a private cloud, you create a cloud environment in your own datacenter and provide self-service access to 
compute resources to users in your organization. This offers a simulation of a public cloud to your users, but 
you remain completely responsible for the purchase and maintenance of the hardware and software services 
you provide. 
Advantages 
Disadvantages 
You can ensure the configuration can support 
any scenario or legacy application 
You have some initial CapEx costs and must purchase the 
hardware for startup and maintenance 
You can control (and responsibility) over security 
Owning the equipment limits the agility - to scale you must 
buy, install, and setup new hardware 
Private clouds can meet strict security, 
compliance, or legal requirements 
Private clouds require IT skills and expertise that’s hard to 
come by 
Economies at scale and integration with Azure 
Security Center

1.6.3 HYBRID CLOUD 
A hybrid cloud combines public and private clouds, allowing you to run your applications in the most 
appropriate location. 
Advantages 
Disadvantages 
Keep any systems running and accessible that use out-of-date 
hardware or an out-of-date operating system 
Can be more expensive than selecting one 
deployment model since it involves some 
CapEx cost up front 
You have flexibility with what you run locally versus in the cloud 
It can be more complicated to set up and 
manage 
You can take advantage of economies of scale from public cloud 
providers for services and resources where it’s cheaper, and then 
supplement with your own equipment when it’s not 
 
You can use your own equipment to meet security, compliance, or 
legacy scenarios where you need to completely control the 
environment 
 
1.7 
TYPES OF CLOUD SERVICES 
1.7.1 IAAS 
Infrastructure as a Service is the most flexible category of cloud services. It aims to give you complete control 
over the hardware that runs your application. 
Instead of buying hardware, with IaaS, you rent it. It’s an instant computing infrastructure, provisioned and 
managed over the internet. 
1.7.2 PAAS 
Platform as a Service provides an environment for building, testing, and deploying software applications. The 
goal of PaaS is to help you create an application quickly without managing the underlying infrastructure. 
1.7.3 SAAS 
Software as a Service is software that is centrally hosted and managed for the end customer. It is usually 
based on an architecture where one version of the application is used for all customers, and licensed through 
a monthly or annual subscription. Office 365, Skype, and Dynamics CRM Online are perfect examples of SaaS 
software.

pay only for what they 
consume. 
No upfront costs. Users pay only for what 
they consume. 
No upfront costs; they 
pay a subscription, 
typically on a monthly 
or annual basis. 
User 
ownership 
The user is responsible 
for the purchase, 
installation, configuration, 
and management of their 
own software, operating 
systems, middleware, and 
applications. 
The user is responsible for the development 
of their own applications. However, they are 
not responsible for managing the server or 
infrastructure. This allows the user to focus 
on the application or workload they want to 
run. 
Users just use the 
application software; 
they are not 
responsible for any 
maintenance or 
management of that 
software. 
Cloud 
provider 
ownership 
The cloud provider is 
responsible for ensuring 
that the underlying cloud 
infrastructure (such as 
virtual machines, storage, 
and networking) is 
available for the user. 
The cloud provider is responsible for 
operating system management, network, 
and service configuration. Cloud providers 
are typically responsible for everything 
apart from the application that a user wants 
to run. They provide a complete managed 
platform on which to run the application. 
The cloud provider is 
responsible for the 
provision, 
management, and 
maintenance of the 
application software. 
1.7.5 MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES 
One thing to understand is that these categories are layers on top of each other. For example, PaaS adds a 
layer on top of IaaS by providing a level of abstraction. The abstraction has the benefit of hiding the details that 
you may not care about, so that you can get to coding quicker. However, one aspect of the abstraction is that 
you have less control over the underlying hardware. The following illustration shows a list of resources that you 
manage and that your service provider manages in each cloud service category. 
 
• 
IaaS requires the most user management of all the cloud services. The user is responsible for managing 
the operating systems, data, and applications. 
• 
PaaS requires less user management. The cloud provider manages the operating systems, and the user 
is responsible for the applications and data they run and store. 
• 
SaaS requires the least amount of management. The cloud provider is responsible for managing 
everything, and the end user just uses the software.

CORE CLOUD SERVICES - INTRODUCTION TO AZURE 
In this module, you will: 
• 
Learn what Microsoft Azure is and how it relates to cloud computing 
• 
Use Azure Cloud Shell to launch a Windows or Linux virtual machine 
• 
Configure your virtual machine to run a basic web server 
• 
Scale up your server to give you more compute power 
2.1 
WHAT IS AZURE? 
Azure is Microsoft’s cloud computing platform. Azure gives you the freedom to build, manage, and deploy 
applications on a massive global network using your favorite tools and frameworks. Azure provides over 100 
services that enable you to do everything from running your existing applications on virtual machines to 
exploring new software paradigms such as intelligent bots and mixed reality. 
While migrating your existing apps to virtual machines is a good start, the cloud is more than just “a different 
place to run your virtual machines”. For example, Azure provides AI and machine-learning services that can 
naturally communicate with your users through vision, hearing, and speech. It also provides storage solutions 
that dynamically grow to accommodate massive amounts of data. Azure services enable solutions that are 
simply not feasible without the power of the cloud.

People are able to access more information than ever before. It began with personal digital assistants (PDAs), 
then morphed into smartphones. Now there are smart watches, smart thermostats, even smart refrigerators. 
Personal computers used to be the norm. Now the internet allows any item that’s online-capable to access 
valuable information. This ability for devices to garner and then relay information for data analysis is referred 
to as the Internet of Things (IoT). 
The Azure Internet of Things (IoT) is a collection of Microsoft-managed cloud services that connect, monitor, 
and control billions of IoT assets. In simpler terms, an IoT solution is made up of one or more IoT devices and 
one or more back-end services running in the cloud that communicate with each other.

quickly to state changes. 
2.2.8 BIG DATA 
Data comes in all formats and sizes. When we talk about Big Data, we’re referring to large volumes of data. 
Data from weather systems, communications systems, genomic research, imaging platforms, and many other 
scenarios generate hundreds of gigabytes of data. This amount of data makes it hard to analyze and make 
decisions around. It’s often so large that traditional forms of processing and analysis are no longer appropriate. 
Open source cluster technologies have been developed to deal with these large data sets. Microsoft Azure 
supports a broad range of technologies and services to provide big data and analytic solutions. 
Service name

Data services in Azure. 
2.2.9 ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 
Artificial Intelligence, in the context of cloud computing, is based around a broad range of services, the core of 
which is Machine Learning. Machine Learning is a data science technique that allows computers to use 
existing data to forecast future behaviors, outcomes, and trends. Using machine learning, computers learn 
without being explicitly programmed. 
Forecasts or predictions from machine learning can make apps and devices smarter. For example, when you 
shop online, machine learning helps recommend other products you might like based on what you’ve 
purchased. Or when your credit card is swiped, machine learning compares the transaction to a database of 
transactions and helps detect fraud. And when your robot vacuum cleaner vacuums a room, machine learning 
helps it decide whether the job is done. 
Some of the most common Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning service types in Azure are: 
Service name

software delivery to provide continuous value to your users. Azure DevOps Services allows you to create build 
and release pipelines that provide continuous integration, delivery, and deployment for your applications. You 
can integrate repositories and application tests, perform application monitoring, and work with build artifacts. 
You can also work with and backlog items for tracking, automate infrastructure deployment and integrate a 
range of third-party tools and services such as Jenkins and Chef. All of these functions and many more are 
closely integrated with Azure to allow for consistent, repeatable deployments for your applications to provide 
streamlined build and release processes.

CREATE A VIRTUAL MACHINE 
2.3.1 AZURE CLOUD SHELL 
Azure Cloud Shell is a browser-based command-line experience for managing and developing Azure resources. 
Think of Cloud Shell as an interactive console that you run in the cloud. 
Cloud Shell provides two experiences to choose from: Bash and PowerShell. Both include access to the Azure 
CLI, the command-line interface for Azure. 
You can use any Azure management interface, including the Azure portal, Azure CLI, and Azure PowerShell, to 
manage any kind of VM. 
2.3.2 WHAT IS A VIRTUAL MACHINE 
A virtual machine, or VM, is a software emulation of a physical computer. A snapshot of a running VM is called 
an image. Azure provides images for Windows and several flavors of Linux. You can also create your own 
preconfigured images to make deployments go faster. 
A virtual machine is defined by a number of factors, including its size and location. Before you bring up your 
VM, let’s briefly cover what’s involved. 
• 
Size: A VM’s size defines its processor speed, amount of memory, initial amount of storage, and expected 
network bandwidth. 
• 
Region: A region is a set of Azure data centers in a named geographic location. Every Azure resource, 
including virtual machines, is assigned a region. East US and North Europe are examples of regions. 
• 
Network: A virtual network is a logically isolated network on Azure. Each virtual machine on Azure is 
associated with a virtual network. Azure provides cloud-level firewalls for your virtual networks called 
network security groups. 
• 
Resource groups: Virtual machines and other cloud resources are grouped into logical containers called 
resource groups. Groups are typically used to organize sets of resources that are deployed together as 
part of an application or service. You refer to a resource group by its name. 
2.3.3 CREATING RESOURCES IN AZURE 
2.3.3.1.1 CREATING RESOURCE GROUP 
Normally, the first thing we’d do is to create a resource group to hold all the things that we need to create. This 
allows us to administer all the VMs, disks, network interfaces, and other elements that make up our solution as 
a unit. 
We can use the Azure CLI to create a resource group with the az group create command. It takes a --name 
to give it a unique name in our subscription, and a --location to tell Azure what area of the world we want 
the resources to be located by default. 
 
 

Azure Fundamentals

2.3.3.1.2 CREATING VIRTUAL MACHINE 
Example Azure CLI command: 
az vm create \ 
  --name myVM \ 
  --resource-group Learn-ed49b49c-4d23-418b-89c2-7d6186579226 \ 
  --image Win2019Datacenter \ 
  --size Standard_DS2_v2 \ 
  --location eastus \ 
  --admin-username $USERNAME \ 
  --admin-password $PASSWORD 
By default, Azure assigns a public IP address to your VM. You can configure a VM to be accessible from the 
Internet or only from the internal network. 
Let’s review the command you just ran. 
• 
The VM is named myVM. This name identifies the VM in Azure. It also becomes the VM’s internal 
hostname, or computer name. 
• 
The resource group, or the VM’s logical container, is named Learn-ed49b49c-4d23-418b-89c2-
7d6186579226. 
• 
Win2019Datacenter specifies the Windows Server 2019 VM image. 
• 
Standard_DS2_v2 refers to the size of the VM. This size has two virtual CPUs and 7 GB of memory. 
• 
The username and password enable you to connect to your VM later. For example, you can connect over 
Remote Desktop or WinRM to work with and configure the system. 
When the VM is ready, you see information about it. Here’s an example. 
{ 
  "fqdns": "", 
  "id": "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/myResourc
eGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/myVM", 
  "location": "eastus", 
  "macAddress": "00-0D-3A-1E-1B-3B", 
  "powerState": "VM running", 
  "privateIpAddress": "10.0.0.5", 
  "publicIpAddress": "104.211.9.245", 
  "resourceGroup": "myResourceGroup", 
  "zones": "" 
} 
 
 

16 
2.3.3.1.3 VERIFY YOUR VM IS RUNNING 
Run the following az vm get-instance-view command to verify that the VM was successfully created and 
is running: 
az vm get-instance-view \ 
  --name myVM \ 
  --resource-groupLearn-ed49b49c-4d23-418b-89c2-7d6186579226 \ 
  --output table 
The output you see resembles this.

VM running 
You see the VM’s name, its resource group, and its location. You also see that the VM was provisioned, or 
created, successfully and that it’s running. 
2.4 
ADD A WEB SERVER 
To configure a VM, you have several choices. You can connect directly and interactively configure your system. 
Manual configuration is a good start, but as you add systems, you can automate your deployments. Automation 
involves running repeatable processes such as programs and scripts that take care of the heavy lifting for you. 
2.4.1 CONFIGURE IIS 
The Custom Script Extension is an easy way to download and run scripts on your Azure VMs. It’s just one of the 
many ways you can configure the system once your VM is up and running. 
You can store your scripts in Azure storage or in a public location such as GitHub. You can run scripts manually 
or as part of a more automated deployment. Here, you’ll run an Azure CLI command to download a PowerShell 
script from GitHub and execute it on your VM. The script configures IIS. 
Internet Information Services, or IIS, is a web server that runs on Windows. You can use IIS to serve standard 
web content (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) or run ASP.NET and other kinds of web applications. IIS comes with 
Windows Server, but you need to activate it to start serving web pages. 
Here you’ll use the Custom Script Extension to configure IIS remotely on your VM from Cloud Shell. You’ll also 
configure the firewall to allow inbound network access on port 80 (HTTP). 
From Cloud Shell, run this az vm extension set command to download and execute a PowerShell script 
that installs IIS and configures a basic home page. 
 
 

Azure Fundamentals 
17 
 
 
az vm extension set \ 
  --resource-group Learn-ed49b49c-4d23-418b-89c2-7d6186579226 \ 
  --vm-name myVM \ 
  --name CustomScriptExtension \ 
  --publisher Microsoft.Compute \ 
  --settings "{'fileUris':['https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-w
elcome-to-azure/master/configure-iis.ps1']}" \ 
  --protected-settings "{'commandToExecute': 'powershell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricte
d -File configure-iis.ps1'}" 
The PowerShell file that is executed: 
# Install IIS. 
dism /online /enable-feature /featurename:IIS-WebServerRole 
 
# Set the home page. 
Set-Content ` 
  -Path "C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\Default.htm" ` 
  -Value "<html><body><h2>Welcome to Azure! My name is $($env:computername).</h2></bo
dy></html>" 
The script installs IIS and configures the home page to display a welcome message along with the VM’s 
computer name, “myVM”. The process to configure IIS, set the contents of the homepage, and start the service 
takes a couple minutes to complete. 
Run this az vm open-port command to open port 80 (HTTP) through the firewall. 
az vm open-port \ 
  --name myVM \ 
  --resource-group Learn-ed49b49c-4d23-418b-89c2-7d6186579226 \ 
  --port 80 
Now that IIS is set up, let’s verify that it’s running. Run this az vm show command to list your VM’s public IP 
address. 
az vm show \ 
  --name myVM \ 
  --resource-group Learn-ed49b49c-4d23-418b-89c2-7d6186579226 \ 
  --show-details \ 
  --query [publicIps] \ 
  --output tsv

2.5 
SCALE UP 
Tip: The cloud is elastic. You can scale down or scale in your deployment if you needed to scale up or scale out 
only temporarily. Scaling down or scaling in can help you save money. Azure Advisor and Azure Cost 
Management are two services that help you optimize cloud spend. You can use these services to identify 
where you’re using more than you need, and then scale back to the capacity you’re actually using. 
From Cloud Shell, run az vm resize to increase your VM’s size to Standard_DS3_v2. 
az vm resize \ 
  --resource-group Learn-ed49b49c-4d23-418b-89c2-7d6186579226 \ 
  --name myVM \ 
  --size Standard_DS3_v2 
Run az vm show to verify that your VM is running the new size. 
az vm show \ 
  --resource-group Learn-ed49b49c-4d23-418b-89c2-7d6186579226 \ 
  --name myVM \

CORE CLOUD SERVICES - AZURE ARCHITECTURE AND SERVICE GUARANTEES 
Azure provides a global network of secure datacenters you can deploy your services into. Learn about the 
physical architecture of Azure, how redundancy is provided, and what sort of service guarantees Microsoft 
provides. 
In this module, you will: 
• 
Explore the physical structure of Azure infrastructure 
• 
Understand the service level agreements provided by Azure 
• 
Learn how to provide your own service level agreements for your apps 
3.1 
REGIONS 
Microsoft Azure is made up of datacenters located around the globe. When you leverage a service or create a 
resource such as a SQL database or virtual machine, you are using physical equipment in one or more of these 
locations. 
The specific datacenters aren’t exposed to end users directly; instead, Azure organizes them into regions. A 
region is a geographical area on the planet containing at least one, but potentially multiple datacenters that 
are nearby and networked together with a low-latency network. 
Azure intelligently assigns and controls the resources within each region to ensure workloads are appropriately 
balanced. It also provides better scalability, redundancy, and preserves data residency for your services. Azure 
has specialized regions that you might want to use when building out your applications for compliance or legal 
purposes. 
Azure has more global regions than any other cloud provider. This gives you the flexibility to bring applications 
closer to your users no matter where they are. It also provides better scalability, redundancy, and preserves 
data residency for your services. 
Regions are what you use to identify the location for your resources, but there are two other terms you should 
also be aware of: geographies and availability zones. 
3.2 
GEOGRAPHIES 
Azure divides the world into geographies that are defined by geopolitical boundaries or country borders. An 
Azure geography is a discrete market typically containing two or more regions that preserve data residency and 
compliance boundaries. This division has several benefits. 
• 
Geographies allow customers with specific data residency and compliance needs to keep their data and 
applications close. 
• 
Geographies ensure that data residency, sovereignty, compliance, and resiliency requirements are 
honored within geographical boundaries. 
• 
Geographies are fault-tolerant to withstand complete region failure through their connection to dedicated 
high-capacity networking infrastructure. 
Data residency refers to the physical or geographic location of an organization’s data or information. It defines 
the legal or regulatory requirements imposed on data based on the country or region in which it resides and is 
an important consideration when planning out your application data storage. 

20 
Geographies are broken up into the following areas: 
• 
Americas 
• 
Europe 
• 
Asia Pacific 
• 
Middle East and Africa 
Each region belongs to a single geography and has specific service availability, compliance, and data 
residency/sovereignty rules applied to it. 
3.3 
AVAILABILITY ZONES 
You want to ensure your services and data are redundant so you can protect your information in case of failure. 
When you are hosting your infrastructure, this requires creating duplicate hardware environments. Azure can 
help make your app highly available through Availability Zones. 
Availability zones are physically separate datacenters within an Azure region. 
 
Availability zones 
Each availability zone is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and 
networking. It is set up to be an isolation boundary. If one zone goes down, the other continues working. 
Availability zones are connected through high-speed, private fiber-optic networks. You can use availability 
zones to run mission-critical applications and build high-availability into your application architecture by co-
locating your compute, storage, networking, and data resources within a zone and replicating in other zones. 
Keep in mind that there could be a cost to duplicating your services and transferring data between zones. 
 
 

Azure Fundamentals 
21 
 
Don't confuse an availability set with an availability zone. An availability set is a group with two or more virtual 
machines in the same data center. An availability set ensures that at least one of the virtual machines hosted 
on Azure will be available if something happens. This configuration offers 99.95% SLA. An availability zone is 
the next level of Azure Virtual Machines high-availability, because virtual machines are in different physical 
locations within an Azure Region. It can be deployed using one or more Virtual Machines in an Azure Region. 
Availability zones offer 99.99% SLA where availability sets offer 99.95% SLA. 
 
3.4 
REGION PAIRS 
Availability zones are created using one or more datacenters, and there are a minimum of three zones within a 
single region. However, it’s possible that a large enough disaster could cause an outage big enough to affect 
even two datacenters. That’s why Azure also creates region pairs. 
Each Azure region is always paired with another region within the same geography (such as US, Europe, or 
Asia) at least 300 miles away. This approach allows for the replication of resources (such as virtual machine 
storage) across a geography that helps reduce the likelihood of interruptions due to events such as natural 
disasters, civil unrest, power outages, or physical network outages affecting both regions at once. 
 
Region pairs 
Since the pair of regions is directly connected and far enough apart to be isolated from regional disasters, you 
can use them to provide reliable services and data redundancy. Some services offer automatic geo-redundant 
storage using region pairs.

3.5 
SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS FOR AZURE 
Microsoft maintains its commitment to providing customers with high-quality products and services by 
adhering to comprehensive operational policies, standards, and practices. Formal documents called Service-
Level Agreements (SLAs) capture the specific terms that define the performance standards that apply to Azure. 
• 
SLAs describe Microsoft’s commitment to providing Azure customers with specific performance 
standards. 
• 
There are SLAs for individual Azure products and services. 
• 
SLAs also specify what happens if a service or product fails to perform to a governing SLA’s specification. 
There are three key characteristics of SLAs for Azure products and services: 
• 
Performance Targets 
• 
Uptime and Connectivity Guarantees 
• 
Service credits 
3.5.1 PERFORMANCE TARGETS 
An SLA defines performance targets for an Azure product or service. The performance targets that an SLA 
defines are specific to each Azure product and service. For example, performance targets for some Azure 
services are expressed as uptime guarantees or connectivity rates. 
3.5.2 UPTIME AND CONNECTIVITY GUARANTEES 
A typical SLA specifies performance-target commitments that range from 99.9 percent (“three nines”) to 
99.999 percent (“five nines”), for each corresponding Azure product or service. These targets can apply to 
such performance criteria as uptime or response times for services. 
3.5.3 SERVICE CREDITS 
SLAs also describe how Microsoft will respond if an Azure product or service fails to perform to its governing 
SLA’s specification. For example, customers may have a discount applied to their Azure bill, as compensation 
for an under-performing Azure product or service. 
 
 

Azure Fundamentals 
23 
 
3.6 
COMPOSING SLAS ACROSS SERVICES 
When combining SLAs across different service offerings, the resultant SLA is 
called a Composite SLA. The resulting composite SLA can provide higher or 
lower uptime values, depending on your application architecture. For example: 
99.95 percent × 99.99 percent = 99.94 percent 
This means the combined probability of failure is higher than the individual SLA values. This isn’t surprising, 
because an application that relies on multiple services has more potential failure points.  
Conversely, you can improve the composite SLA by creating independent fallback 
paths. For example, if SQL Database is unavailable, you can put transactions into 
a queue for processing at a later time. 
With this design, the application is still available even if it can’t connect to the 
database. However, it fails if both the database and the queue fail 
simultaneously. 
If the expected percentage of time for a simultaneous failure is 0.0001 × 0.001, 
the composite SLA for this combined path of a database or queue would be: 1.0 
− (0.0001 × 0.001) = 99.99999 percent 
Therefore, if we add the queue to our web app, the total composite SLA is: 99.95 percent × 99.99999 percent 
= ~99.95 percent 
Notice we’ve improved our SLA behavior. However, there are trade-offs to using this approach: the application 
logic is more complicated, you are paying more to add the queue support, and there may be data-consistency 
issues you’ll have to deal with due to retry behavior. 
3.7 
IMPROVE YOUR APP RELIABILITY 
You can use SLAs to evaluate how your Azure solutions meet business requirements and the needs of your 
clients and users. By creating your own SLAs, you can set performance targets to suit your specific Azure 
application. This approach is known as an Application SLA. It’s important to understand the Azure SLAs that 
define performance targets for the Azure products and services within your solution. This understanding will 
help you create achievable Application SLAs. 
Resiliency is the ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function. It’s not about avoiding 
failures, but responding to failures in a way that avoids downtime or data loss. The goal of resiliency is to return 
the application to a fully functioning state following a failure. High availability and disaster recovery are two 
crucial components of resiliency.

CREATE AN AZURE ACCOUNT 
In this module, you will: 
• 
Learn about the different types of Azure accounts and subscriptions 
• 
Understand how billing works in Azure 
• 
Create a free Azure account 
• 
Learn how to get help when you need it with different support options 
With a free Azure account and subscription, you can build, test, and deploy enterprise applications, create 
custom web and mobile experiences, and gain insights from your data through machine learning and powerful 
analytics. 
4.1 
AZURE ACCOUNTS AND SUBSCRIPTIONS 
An Azure account is tied to a specific identity and holds information like: 
• 
Name, email, and contact preferences 
• 
Billing information such as a credit card 
An Azure account is what you use to sign in to the Azure website and administer or deploy services. Every Azure 
account is associated with one or more subscriptions. An Azure subscription is a logical container used to 
provision resources in Microsoft Azure. It holds the details of all your resources like virtual machines, 
databases, etc. 
An Azure subscription has a trust relationship with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), which means that the 
subscription trusts Azure AD to authenticate users, services, and devices. Multiple subscriptions can trust the 
same Azure AD directory, but each subscription can only trust a single directory. 
Every Azure Subscription includes: 
• 
Free access to billing and subscription support 
• 
Azure products and services documentation 
• 
Online self-help documentation 
• 
Community support forums 
4.1.1 AZURE FREE SUBSCRIPTION 
An Azure free subscription includes a $200 credit to spend on any service for the first 30 days, free access to 
the most popular Azure products for 12 months, and access to more than 25 products that are always free. 
This is an excellent way for new users to get started. To set up a free subscription, you need a phone number, a 
credit card, and a Microsoft account. 
4.1.2 AZURE PAY-AS-YOU-GO SUBSCRIPTION 
A Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) subscription charges you monthly for the services you used in that billing period. This 
subscription type is appropriate for a wide range of users, from individuals to small businesses, and many large 
organizations as well. 
 
 

Azure Fundamentals 
25 
 
4.1.3 PAY-AS-YOU-GO DEV/TEST 
Designed for the needs of teams of Visual Studio subscribers, the Pay-As-You-Go Dev/Test offer allows you to 
quickly get your team up and running with dev/test environments in the cloud using pre-configured virtual 
machines, including Windows 10, and low rates on virtual machines, Cloud Services, SQL Database, HDInsight, 
App Service and Logic Apps. You have the flexibility to create multiple Azure subscriptions based on this offer, 
enabling you to maintain isolated environments and a separate bill for different projects or teams. 
This offer is exclusively for active Visual Studio subscribers and is limited to development and testing only. This 
benefit is exclusively for development and testing your applications. Usage within the subscription does not 
carry a financially-backed SLA, except for use of Visual Studio Team Services and HockeyApp. 
4.1.4 AZURE ENTERPRISE AGREEMENT 
An Enterprise Agreement provides flexibility to buy cloud services and software licenses under one agreement, 
with discounts for new licenses and Software Assurance. It’s targeted at enterprise-scale organizations. 
4.1.5 AZURE FOR STUDENTS SUBSCRIPTION 
An Azure for Students subscription includes $100 in Azure credits to be used within the first 12 months plus 
select free services without requiring a credit card at sign-up. You must verify your student status through your 
organizational email address. 
4.2 
USING MULTIPLE AZURE SUBSCRIPTIONS 
You can create multiple subscriptions under a single Azure account. This is particularly useful for businesses 
because access control and billing occur at the subscription level, not the account level. 
 
Accounts and subscriptions 
4.2.1 ACCESS MANAGEMENT 
You can create separate subscriptions on your Azure account to reflect different organizational structures. For 
example, you could limit engineering to lower-cost resources, while allowing the IT department a full range. This 
design allows you to manage and control access to the resources that users provision within each subscription. 
 
 

26 
4.2.2 BILLING 
One bill is generated for every Azure subscription on a monthly basis. The payment is charged automatically to 
the associated account credit or debit card within 10 days after the billing period ends. On your credit card 
statement, the line item would say MSFT Azure. 
You can set spending limits on each subscription to ensure you aren’t surprised at the end of the month. 
Reports can be generated by subscriptions, if you have multiple internal departments and need to do 
“chargeback,” a possible scenario is to create subscriptions by department or project. 
4.3 
AUTHENTICATE ACCESS WITH AZURE ACTIVE DIRECTORY 
As you’ve seen, your Azure account is a globally unique entity that gives you access to your Azure subscriptions 
and services. Authentication for your account is performed using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). Azure AD is 
a modern identity provider that supports multiple authentication protocols to secure applications and services 
in the cloud. 
Azure AD is not the same as Windows Active Directory. Windows Active Directory is focused on securing 
Windows desktops and servers. In contrast, Azure AD is all about web-based authentication standards such as 
OpenID and OAuth. 
Users, applications, and other entities registered in Azure AD aren’t all lumped into a single global service. 
Instead, Azure AD is partitioned into separate tenants. A tenant is a dedicated, isolated instance of the Azure 
Active Directory service, owned and managed by an organization. When you sign up for a Microsoft cloud 
service subscription such as Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Intune, or Office 365, a dedicated instance of Azure AD 
is automatically created for your organization. 
When it comes to Azure AD tenants, there is no concrete definition of “organization” — tenants can be owned 
by individuals, teams, companies, or any other group of people. Tenants are commonly associated with 
companies. If you sign up for Azure with an email address that’s not associated with an existing tenant, the 
sign-up process will walk you through creating a tenant, owned entirely by you. 
Azure AD tenants and subscriptions have a many-to-one trust relationship: A tenant can be associated with 
multiple Azure subscriptions, but every subscription is associated with only one tenant. This structure allows 
organizations to manage multiple subscriptions and set security rules across all the resources contained within 
them. 
Here’s a simple representation of how accounts, subscriptions, tenants, and resources work together. 
 
Azure AD Tenant 

Azure Fundamentals 
27 
 
Notice that each Azure AD tenant has an account owner. This is the original Azure account that is responsible 
for billing. You can add additional users to the tenant, and even invite guests from other Azure AD tenants to 
access resources in subscriptions. 
4.4 
AZURE SUPPORT OPTIONS 
One final thing to know about subscriptions is how to get support when you need it. Every Azure subscription 
includes free access to the following essential support services: 
• 
Billing and subscription support 
• 
Azure products and services documentation 
• 
Online self-help documentation 
• 
Whitepapers 
• 
Community support forums

4.4.2 SUPPORT-PLAN AVAILABILITY AND BILLING 
The support plans available and how you’re charged depends on the type of Azure customer you are, and the 
type of Azure subscription you have. 
For example, Developer support isn’t available to Enterprise customers. Enterprise customers can purchase 
Standard, Professional Direct, and Premier support plans, and be billed for support as part of an Enterprise 
Agreement (EA). Alternatively, if you purchase a support plan within a pay-as-you-go subscription, your support 
plan is charged to your monthly Azure subscription bill. 
4.4.3 OTHER SUPPORT OPTIONS 
Several additional support channels are available outside Azure’s official support plans: 
• 
Azure Knowledge Center 
• 
Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) Forums 
• 
Stack Overflow 
• 
Server Fault

CORE CLOUD SERVICES - MANAGE SERVICES WITH THE AZURE PORTAL 
Azure is a cloud platform that provides the compute, storage, and networking resources needed to build cloud-
hosted applications. As a new user, the Azure Portal is likely to be the primary way you will interact with Azure. 
The Azure Portal lets you create and manage all your Azure resources. For example, you can set up a new 
database, increase the compute power of your virtual machines, and monitor your monthly costs. It’s also a 
great learning tool since you can survey all available resources and use guided wizards to create the ones you 
need. 
Here you will learn how to sign in to the portal and navigate the portal interface. You will also learn how to 
customize the dashboard, so it is convenient to locate and monitor your most essential services. 
In this module, you will: 
• 
Learn about Azure management options 
• 
Navigate the Azure portal 
• 
Customize the dashboard 
5.1 
AZURE MANAGEMENT OPTIONS 
You can configure and manage Azure using a broad range of tools and platforms. There are tools available for 
the command line, language-specific Software Development Kits (SDKs), developer tools, tools for migration, 
and many others. 
Tools that are commonly used for day-to-day management and interaction include: 
• 
Azure portal for interacting with Azure via a Graphical User Interface (GUI) 
• 
Azure PowerShell and Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI) for command line and automation-based 
interactions with Azure 
• 
Azure Cloud Shell for a web-based command-line interface 
• 
Azure mobile app for monitoring and managing your resources from your mobile device 
5.1.1 AZURE PORTAL 
The Azure portal is a public website that you can access with any web browser. Once you sign in with your Azure 
account, you can create, manage and monitor any available Azure services. The dashboard view provides high-
level details about your Azure environment. You can customize the dashboard by moving and resizing tiles, and 
displaying services you’re interested in. 
The portal doesn’t provide any way to automate repetitive tasks. For example, to set up multiple VMs, you 
would need to create them one at a time by completing the wizard for each VM. This makes the portal 
approach time-consuming and error-prone for complex tasks. 
 
 

Azure Fundamentals 
33 
 
5.1.2 AZURE POWERSHELL 
Azure PowerShell enables you to connect to your Azure subscription and manage resources. Windows 
PowerShell and PowerShell Core provide services such as the shell window and command parsing. Azure 
PowerShell then adds the Azure-specific commands. 
For example, Azure PowerShell provides the New-AzureRmVM command that creates a virtual machine for you 
inside your Azure subscription. To use it, you would launch PowerShell, install the Azure PowerShell module, 
sign in to your Azure account using the command Connect-AzureRMAccount, and then issue a command 
such as: 
New-AzureRmVm ` 
    -ResourceGroupName "MyResourceGroup" ` 
    -Name "TestVm" ` 
    -Image "UbuntuLTS" 
    ... 
Creating administration scripts and using automation tools is a powerful way to optimize your workflow. You 
can automate repetitive tasks. Once a script is verified, it runs consistently, which can reduce errors. Another 
scripting environment is the Azure CLI. 
5.1.3 AZURE CLI 
Azure CLI is a cross-platform command-line program that connects to Azure and executes administrative 
commands on Azure resources. 
az vm create \ 
  --resource-group MyResourceGroup \ 
  --name TestVm \ 
  --image UbuntuLTS 
  --generate-ssh-keys 
  ... 
5.1.4 AZURE CLOUD SHELL 
Azure Cloud Shell is a browser-based scripting environment for command-line administration of Azure 
resources. It provides support for two shell environments. Linux users can opt for a Bash experience, while 
Windows users can use PowerShell. In addition to these administrative tools, the Cloud Shell has a suite of 
developer tools, text editors, and other tools. 
5.1.5 AZURE MOBILE APP 
The Microsoft Azure mobile app allows you to access, manage, and monitor all your Azure accounts and 
resources from your iOS or Android phone or tablet. 
5.1.6 OTHER OPTIONS 
There are also Azure SDKs for a range of languages and frameworks, and REST APIs that you can use to 
manage and control Azure resources programmatically. 

34 
5.2 
NAVIGATE THE PORTAL 
The portal is a web-based administration site that lets you interact with all of your subscriptions and resources 
you have created. Almost everything you do with Azure can be done through this web interface. 
5.2.1 AZURE PORTAL LAYOUT 
The Azure portal is the primary graphical user interface (GUI) for controlling Microsoft Azure. You can carry out 
the majority of management actions in the portal, and it is typically the best interface for carrying out single 
tasks or where you want to look at the configuration options in detail. 
5.2.2 WHAT IS A BLADE? 
The Azure portal uses a blades model for navigation. A blade is a slide-out panel containing the UI for a single 
level in a navigation sequence. For example, each of these elements in this sequence would be represented by 
a blade: Virtual machines > Compute > Ubuntu Server. Each blade contains some information and configurable 
options. Some of these options generate another blade, which reveals itself to the right of any existing blade. 
On the new blade, any further configurable options will spawn another blade, and so on. Soon, you can end up 
with several blades open at the same time. You can maximize blades as well so that they fill the entire screen. 
5.2.3 WHAT IS THE AZURE MARKETPLACE? 
The Marketplace allows customers to find, try, purchase, and provision applications and services from 
hundreds of leading service providers, all certified to run on Azure. With Azure Marketplace, customers can 
discover technical applications built for or built on Azure. It combines Microsoft Azure’s market of solutions and 
services into a single, unified platform to discover, try, buy, or deploy solutions in just a few clicks. 
The solution catalog spans several industry categories, including but not limited to open-source container 
platforms, virtual machine images, databases, application build and deployment software, developer tools, 
threat detection, and blockchain. Using Azure Marketplace, you can provision end-to-end solutions quickly and 
reliably, hosted in your own Azure environment. At the time of writing, this includes over 8,000 listings. 
The Azure Marketplace offers technical solutions and services from Microsoft and partners built to extend 
Azure products and services. The solution catalog spans several categories, including but not limited to: 
• 
base operating systems 
• 
databases 
• 
security 
• 
identity 
• 
networking 
• 
blockchain 
• 
developer tools 
• 
...and more 
 
Azure Marketplace offers SaaS applications, Virtual Machines, Solution Templates, Azure-Managed 
applications, and consulting services. 
5.3 
CONFIGURING SETTINGS IN THE AZURE PORTAL 
If you click the Cloud Shell icon (>_), you will create a new Azure Cloud Shell session. Recall that Azure Cloud 
Shell is an interactive, browser-accessible shell for managing Azure resources. It provides the flexibility of 
choosing the shell experience that best suits the way you work. Linux users can opt for a Bash experience, 
while Windows users can opt for PowerShell. This browser-based terminal lets you control and administer all of 
your Azure resources in the current subscription through a command-line interface built right into the portal.

CORE CLOUD SERVICES - AZURE COMPUTE FUNCTIONS 
In this module, you will: 
• 
Identify compute options in Azure 
• 
Select compute options that are appropriate for your business 
6.1 
ESSENTIAL AZURE COMPUTE CONCEPTS 
6.1.1 WHAT IS AZURE COMPUTE? 
Azure compute is an on-demand computing service for running cloud-based applications. It provides computing 
resources like multi-core processors and supercomputers via virtual machines and containers. It also provides 
serverless computing to run apps without requiring infrastructure setup or configuration. 
There are four common techniques for performing compute in Azure: 
• 
Virtual machines 
• 
Containers 
• 
Azure App Service 
• 
Serverless computing 
6.1.2 WHAT ARE VIRTUAL MACHINES? 
Virtual machines, or VMs, are software emulations of physical computers. They include a virtual processor, 
memory, storage, and networking resources. They host an operating system (OS), and you’re able to install and 
run software just like a physical computer. And by using a remote desktop client, you can use and control the 
virtual machine as if you were sitting in front of it. 
6.1.3 WHAT ARE CONTAINERS? 
Containers are a virtualization environment for running applications. Just like virtual machines, containers are 
run on top of a host operating system but unlike VMs, they don’t include an operating system for the apps 
running inside the container. Instead, containers bundle the libraries and components needed to run the 
application and use the existing host OS running the container. For example, if five containers are running on a 
server with a specific Linux kernel, all five containers and the apps within them share that same Linux kernel. 
6.1.4 WHAT IS AZURE APP SERVICE? 
Azure App Service is a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offering in Azure that is designed to host enterprise-grade 
web-oriented applications. You can meet rigorous performance, scalability, security, and compliance 
requirements while using a fully managed platform to perform infrastructure maintenance. 
6.1.5 WHAT IS SERVERLESS COMPUTING? 
Serverless computing is a cloud-hosted execution environment that runs your code but completely abstracts 
the underlying hosting environment. You create an instance of the service, and you add your code; no 
infrastructure configuration or maintenance is required, or even allowed. 

36 
6.2 
EXPLORE AZURE VIRTUAL MACHINES 
Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) let you create and use virtual machines in the cloud. They provide infrastructure 
as a service (IaaS) in the form of a virtualized server and can be used in many ways. Just like a physical 
computer, you can customize all of the software running on the VM. VMs are an ideal choice when you need: 
• 
Total control over the operating system (OS) 
• 
The ability to run custom software 
• 
To use custom hosting configurations 
You can create and provision a VM in minutes when you select a pre-configured VM image. Selecting an image 
is one of the most important decisions you’ll make when creating a VM. An image is a template used to create 
a VM. These templates already include an OS and often other software, like development tools or web hosting 
environments. 
6.2.1 SCALING VMS IN AZURE 
You can run single VMs for testing, development, or minor tasks, or group VMs together to provide high 
availability, scalability, and redundancy. Azure has several features so that no matter what your uptime 
requirements are, Azure can meet them. These features include: 
• 
Availability sets 
• 
Virtual Machine Scale Sets 
• 
Azure Batch 
6.2.1.1 WHAT ARE AVAILABILITY SETS? 
An availability set is a logical grouping of two or more VMs that help keep your application available during 
planned or unplanned maintenance. 
A planned maintenance event is when the underlying Azure fabric that hosts VMs is updated by Microsoft. A 
planned maintenance event is done to patch security vulnerabilities, improve performance, and add or update 
features. Most of the time these updates are done without any impact to the guest VMs. But sometimes VMs 
require a reboot to complete an update. When the VM is part of an availability set, the Azure fabric updates are 
sequenced so not all of the associated VMs are rebooted at the same time. VMs are put into different update 
domains. Update domains indicate groups of VMs and underlying physical hardware that can be rebooted at 
the same time. Update domains are a logical part of each data center and are implemented with software and 
logic. 
Unplanned maintenance events involve a hardware failure in 
the data center, such as a power outage or disk failure. VMs 
that are part of an availability set automatically switch to a 
working physical server so the VM continues to run. The group 
of virtual machines that share common hardware are in the 
same fault domain. A fault domain is essentially a rack of 
servers. It provides the physical separation of your workload 
across different power, cooling, and network hardware that 
support the physical servers in the data center server racks. In 
the event the hardware that supports a server rack becomes 
unavailable, only that rack of servers is affected by the outage. 

Azure Fundamentals 
37 
 
With an availability set, you get: 
• 
Up to three fault domains that each have a server rack with dedicated power and network resources 
• 
Five logical update domains 
6.2.1.2 WHAT ARE VIRTUAL MACHINE SCALE SETS? 
Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets let you create and manage a group of identical, load balanced VMs. Imagine 
you’re running a website that enables scientists to upload astronomy images that need to be processed. If you 
duplicated the VM, you’d normally need to configure an additional service to route requests between multiple 
instances of the website. VM Scale Sets could do that work for you. 
Scale sets allow you to centrally manage, configure, and update a large number of VMs in minutes to provide 
highly available applications. The number of VM instances can automatically increase or decrease in response 
to demand or a defined schedule. With VM Scale Sets, you can build large-scale services for areas such as 
compute, big data, and container workloads. 
Scale sets are built from virtual machines. With scale sets, the management and automation layers are 
provided to run and scale your applications. You could instead manually create and manage individual VMs, or 
integrate existing tools to build a similar level of automation. The following table outlines the benefits of scale 
sets compared to manually managing multiple VM instances. 
Scenario 
Manual group of VMs 
Virtual machine scale set 
Add additional VM 
instances 
Manual process to create, configure, and 
ensure compliance 
Automatically create from central 
configuration 
Traffic balancing 
and distribution 
Manual process to create and configure 
Azure load balancer or Application 
Gateway 
Can automatically create and integrate with 
Azure load balancer or Application Gateway 
High availability and 
redundancy 
Manually create Availability Set or 
distribute and track VMs across 
Availability Zones 
Automatic distribution of VM instances 
across Availability Zones or Availability Sets 
Scaling of VMs 
Manual monitoring and Azure 
Automation 
Autoscale based on host metrics, in-guest 
metrics, Application Insights, or schedule 
There is no additional cost to scale sets. You only pay for the underlying compute resources such as the VM 
instances, load balancer, or Managed Disk storage. The management and automation features, such as 
autoscale and redundancy, incur no additional charges over the use of VMs. 
6.2.1.3 WHAT IS AZURE BATCH? 
Azure Batch enables large-scale job scheduling and compute management with the ability to scale to tens, 
hundreds, or thousands of VMs. 
When you’re ready to run a job, Batch: 
• 
Starts a pool of compute VMs for you 
• 
Installs applications and staging data 
• 
Runs jobs with as many tasks as you have 
• 
Identifies failures 
• 
Requeues work 
• 
Scales down the pool as work completes 

38 
6.3 
EXPLORE CONTAINERS IN AZURE 
If you wish to run multiple instances of an application on a single virtual machine, containers are an excellent 
choice. The container orchestrator can start, stop, and scale out application instances as needed. 
Containers are meant to be lightweight, created, scaled out, and stopped dynamically. This design allows you 
to respond quickly to changes in demand or failure. 
Another benefit of containers is you can run multiple isolated applications on a single VM host. Since 
containers are secured and isolated, you don’t need separate VMs for each app. 
6.3.1 CONTAINERS IN AZURE 
Azure supports Docker containers, and there are several ways to manage containers in Azure. 
• 
Azure Container Instances (ACI) 
• 
Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) 
6.3.1.1 AZURE CONTAINER INSTANCES 
Azure Container Instances (ACI) offers the fastest and simplest way to run a container in Azure. You don’t have 
to manage any virtual machines or configure any additional services. It is a PaaS offering that allows you to 
upload your containers and execute them directly. 
6.3.1.2 AZURE KUBERNETES SERVICE 
The task of automating and managing and interacting with a large number of containers is known as 
orchestration. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a complete orchestration service for containers with 
distributed architectures with multiple containers. 
6.3.1.3 USING CONTAINERS IN YOUR SOLUTIONS 
Containers are often used to create solutions using a microservice architecture. This is where you break 
solutions into smaller, independent pieces. For example, you may split a website into a container hosting your 
front end, another hosting your back end, and a third for storage. This allows you to separate portions of your 
app into logical sections that can be maintained, scaled, or updated independently. 
 
 

Azure Fundamentals 
39 
 
6.4 
EXPLORE AZURE APP SERVICE 
Azure App Service enables you to build and host web apps, background jobs, mobile backends, and RESTful 
APIs in the programming language of your choice without managing infrastructure. It offers auto-scaling and 
high availability, supports both Windows and Linux, and enables automated deployments from GitHub, Azure 
DevOps, or any Git repo to support a continuous deployment model. 
This platform as a service (PaaS) allows you to focus on the website and API logic while Azure takes care of the 
infrastructure to run and scale your web applications. 
6.4.1 TYPES OF WEB APPS 
With Azure App Service, you can host most common web app styles including: 
• 
Web Apps 
• 
API Apps 
• 
WebJobs 
• 
Mobile Apps 
Azure App Service handles most of the infrastructure decisions you deal with in hosting web apps: deployment 
and management are integrated into the platform, endpoints can be secured, sites can be scaled quickly to 
handle high traffic loads, and the built-in load balancing and traffic manager provide high availability. All of 
these app styles are hosted in the same infrastructure and share these benefits. This makes App Service the 
ideal choice to host web-oriented applications. 
6.4.1.1 WEB APPS 
App Service includes full support for hosting web apps using ASP.NET, ASP.NET Core, Java, Ruby, Node.js, PHP, 
or Python. You can choose either Windows or Linux as the host operating system. 
6.4.1.2 API APPS 
Much like hosting a website, you can build REST-based Web APIs using your choice of language and 
framework. You get full Swagger support, and the ability to package and publish your API in the Azure 
Marketplace. The produced apps can be consumed from any HTTP(s) based client. 
6.4.1.3 WEB JOBS 
WebJobs allows you to run a program (.exe, Java, PHP, Python or Node.js) or script (.cmd, .bat, PowerShell, or 
Bash) in the same context as a web app, API app, or mobile app. They can be scheduled, or run by a trigger. 
This is often used to run background tasks as part of your application logic. 
6.4.1.4 MOBILE APPS 
Use the Mobile Apps feature of Azure App Service to quickly build a back-end for iOS and Android apps. With 
just a few clicks in the Azure portal you can: 
• 
Store mobile app data in a cloud-based SQL database 
• 
Authenticate customers against common social providers such as MSA, Google, Twitter and Facebook 
• 
Send push notifications 
• 
Execute custom back-end logic in C# or Node.js 

40 
6.5 
EXPLORE SERVERLESS COMPUTING IN AZURE 
With serverless computing, Azure takes care of managing the server infrastructure and allocation/deallocation 
of resources based on demand. Infrastructure isn’t your responsibility. Scaling and performance are handled 
automatically, and you are billed only for the exact resources you use. There’s no need to even reserve 
capacity. 
You focus solely on the logic you need to execute and the trigger that is used to run your code. You configure 
your serverless apps to respond to events. This could be a REST endpoint, a periodic timer, or even a message 
received from another Azure service. The serverless app runs only when it’s triggered by an event. 
Azure has two implementations of serverless compute: 
• 
Azure Functions which can execute code in almost any modern language. 
• 
Azure Logic Apps which are designed in a web-based designer and can execute logic triggered by Azure 
services without writing any code. 
6.5.1 AZURE FUNCTIONS 
When you’re concerned only about the code running your service, and not the underlying platform or 
infrastructure, Azure Functions are ideal. Azure Functions scale automatically based on demand, so they’re a 
solid choice when demand is variable. 
Furthermore, Azure Functions can be either stateless (the default) where they behave as if they’re restarted 
every time they respond to an event), or stateful (called “Durable Functions”) where a context is passed 
through the function to track prior activity. 
6.5.2 AZURE LOGIC APPS 
Azure Logic Apps are similar to Functions - both enable you to trigger logic based on an event. Where Functions 
execute code, Logic Apps execute workflows built from predefined logic blocks. They are specifically designed 
to automate your business processes. 
You create Logic App workflows using a visual designer on the Azure Portal or in Visual Studio. The workflows 
are persisted as a JSON file with a known workflow schema. 
Azure provides over 200 different connectors and processing blocks to interact with different services - 
including most popular enterprise apps. You can also build custom connectors and workflow steps if the 
service you need to interact with isn’t covered. You then use the visual designer to link connectors and blocks 
together, passing data through the workflow to do custom processing - often all without writing any code. 
6.5.3 FUNCTIONS VS. LOGIC APPS 
Functions and Logic Apps can both create complex orchestrations. An orchestration is a collection of functions 
or steps, that are executed to accomplish a complex task. With Azure Functions, you write code to complete 
each step, with Logic Apps, you use a GUI to define the actions and how they relate to one another. 
You can mix and match services when you build an orchestration, calling functions from logic apps and calling 
logic apps from functions. Here are some common differences between the two.

6.5.4 AZURE EVENT GRID 
Azure Event Grid allows you to easily build applications with event-based architectures. First, select the Azure 
resource you would like to subscribe to, and then give the event handler or WebHook endpoint to send the 
event to. Event Grid has built-in support for events coming from Azure services, like storage blobs and resource 
groups. Event Grid also has support for your own events, using custom topics. 
You can use filters to route specific events to different endpoints, multicast to multiple endpoints, and make 
sure your events are reliably delivered. 
 
Azure Event Grid 
There are five concepts in Azure Event Grid that let you get going: 
• 
Events - What happened. 
• 
Event sources - Where the event took place. 
• 
Topics - The endpoint where publishers send events. 
• 
Event subscriptions - The endpoint or built-in mechanism to route events, sometimes to more than one 
handler. 
• 
Subscriptions are also used by handlers to intelligently filter incoming events. 
• 
Event handlers - The app or service reacting to the event. 

42 
6.5.4.1 CHOOSE BETWEEN AZURE MESSAGING SERVICES 
Azure offers three services that assist with delivering event messages throughout a solution: 
• 
Event Grid 
• 
Event Hubs 
• 
Service Bus 
Although they have some similarities, each service is designed for particular scenarios. This article describes 
the differences between these services, and helps you understand which one to choose for your application. In 
many cases, the messaging services are complementary and can be used together. 
Service 
Purpose 
Type 
When to use 
Event 
Grid 
Reactive programming 
Event distribution 
(discrete) 
React to status changes 
Event 
Hubs 
Big data pipeline 
Event streaming 
(series) 
Telemetry and distributed data streaming 
Service 
Bus 
High-value enterprise 
messaging 
Message 
Order processing and financial transactions 
Event Grid is an eventing backplane that enables event-driven, reactive programming. It uses a publish-
subscribe model. Publishers emit events, but have no expectation about which events are handled. 
Subscribers decide which events they want to handle. Event Grid is deeply integrated with Azure services and 
can be integrated with third-party services. It simplifies event consumption and lowers costs by eliminating the 
need for constant polling. Event Grid efficiently and reliably routes events from Azure and non-Azure resources. 
Azure Event Hubs is a big data pipeline. It facilitates the capture, retention, and replay of telemetry and event 
stream data. The data can come from many concurrent sources. Event Hubs allows telemetry and event data 
to be made available to a variety of stream-processing infrastructures and analytics services. It is available 
either as data streams or bundled event batches. This service provides a single solution that enables rapid 
data retrieval for real-time processing as well as repeated replay of stored raw data. It can capture the 
streaming data into a file for processing and analysis. 
Service Bus is intended for traditional enterprise applications. These enterprise applications require 
transactions, ordering, duplicate detection, and instantaneous consistency. Service Bus enables cloud-native 
applications to provide reliable state transition management for business processes. When handling high-value 
messages that cannot be lost or duplicated, use Azure Service Bus. Service Bus also facilitates highly secure 
communication across hybrid cloud solutions and can connect existing on-premises systems to cloud solutions. 
Service Bus is a brokered messaging system. It stores messages in a “broker” (for example, a queue) until the 
consuming party is ready to receive the messages.

EXPLORE AZURE IOT 
There are several IoT-related services in Azure and it can be confusing to figure out which one you want to use. 
Some, such as IoT Central and the IoT solution accelerators, provide templates to help you create your own 
solution and get started quickly. You can also fully develop your own solutions using other services available – 
it all depends on how much help you want, and how much control. Here is a list of the services available, as 
well as what you may use them for. 
 
Azure IoT solutions 
The Azure Internet of Things (IoT) is a collection of Microsoft-managed cloud services that connect, monitor, 
and control billions of IoT assets. In simpler terms, an IoT solution is made up of one or more IoT devices and 
one or more back-end services running in the cloud that communicate with each other. 
The main parts of an IoT solution are as follows: devices, back-end services, and the communications between 
the two. Devices are generally made up of a circuit board with sensors attached that connect to the internet. 
Many devices communicate via a Wi-Fi chip. Here are some examples of IoT devices: 
• 
pressure sensors on a remote oil pump 
• 
temperature and humidity sensors in an air-conditioning unit 
• 
accelerometers in an elevator 
• 
presence sensors in a room 
Your device can communicate with back-end services in both directions. Here are some examples of ways that 
the device can communicate with the back-end solution: 
• 
Your device may send temperature from a mobile refrigeration truck every 5 minutes to an IoT Hub. 
• 
The back-end service can ask the device to send telemetry more frequently to help diagnose a problem. 
• 
Your device can send alerts based on the values read from its sensors. For example, if monitoring a 
batch reactor in a chemical plant, you may want to send an alert when the temperatures exceeds a 
certain value. 

44 
• 
Your device can send information to a dashboard for viewing by human operators. For example, a control 
room in a refinery may show the temperature and pressure of each pipe, as well as the volume flowing 
through that pipe, allowing the operators to watch it. 
Connecting devices securely and reliably is often the biggest challenge in IoT solutions. This is because IoT 
devices have different characteristics when compared to other clients such as browsers and mobile apps. 
Specifically, IoT devices: 
• 
Are often embedded systems with no human operator (unlike a phone). 
• 
Can be deployed in remote locations, where physical access is expensive. 
• 
May only be reachable through the solution back end. There is no other way to interact with the device. 
• 
May have limited power and processing resources. 
• 
May have intermittent, slow, or expensive network connectivity. 
• 
May need to use proprietary, custom, or industry-specific application protocols. 
Here are some of the functions a back-end service can provide. 
• 
Receiving telemetry at scale from your devices, and determining how to process and store that data. 
• 
Analyzing the telemetry to provide insights, either in real time or after the fact. 
• 
Sending commands from the cloud to a specific device. 
• 
Provisioning devices and control which devices can connect to your infrastructure. 
• 
Control the state of your devices and monitor their activities. 
For example, in a predictive maintenance scenario, the cloud back end stores historical telemetry. The solution 
uses this data to identify potential anomalous behavior on specific pumps before they cause a real problem. 
Using data analytics, it can identify that the preventative solution is to send a command back to the device to 
take a corrective action. This process generates an automated feedback loop between the device and the 
cloud that greatly increases the solution efficiency. 
There are several IoT-related services in Azure and it can be confusing to figure out which one you want to use. 
Some, such as IoT Central and the IoT solution accelerators, provide templates to help you create your own 
solution and get started quickly. You can also fully develop your own solutions using other services available – 
it all depends on how much help you want, and how much control.  
Here is a list of the services available, as well as what you may use them for. 
• 
IoT Central: This is a SaaS solution that helps you connect, monitor, and manage your IoT devices. To 
start, you select a template for your device type and create and test a basic IoT Central application that 
the operators of the device will use. The IoT Central application will also enable you to monitor the 
devices and provision new devices. This service is for straightforward solutions that don’t require deep 
service customization. 
• 
IoT solution accelerators: This is a collection of PaaS solutions you can use to accelerate your 
development of an IoT solution. You start with a provided IoT solution and then fully customize that 
solution to your requirements. You need Java or .NET skills to customize the back-end, and JavaScript 
skills to customize the visualization. 
• 
IoT Hub: This service allows you to connect from your devices to an IoT hub, and monitor and control 
billions of IoT devices. This is especially useful if you need bi-directional communication between your IoT 
devices and your back end. This is the underlying service for IoT Central and IoT solution accelerators.

46 
6.6.3 IOT HUB 
IoT Hub is a managed service, hosted in the cloud, that acts as a central message hub for bi-directional 
communication between your IoT application and the devices it manages. You can use Azure IoT Hub to build 
IoT solutions with reliable and secure communications between millions of IoT devices and a cloud-hosted 
solution backend. You can connect virtually any device to IoT Hub. 
IoT Hub supports communications both from the device to the cloud and from the cloud to the device. IoT Hub 
supports multiple messaging patterns such as device-to-cloud telemetry, file upload from devices, and request-
reply methods to control your devices from the cloud. IoT Hub monitoring helps you maintain the health of your 
solution by tracking events such as device creation, device failures, and device connections. 
IoT Hub’s capabilities help you build scalable, full-featured IoT solutions such as managing industrial 
equipment used in manufacturing, tracking valuable assets in healthcare, and monitoring office building 
usageThis is the underlying service for IoT Central and IoT solution accelerators. 
You can integrate IoT Hub with other Azure services to build complete, end-to-end solutions. For example, use: 
• 
Azure Event Grid to enable your business to react quickly to critical events in a reliable, scalable, and 
secure manner. 
• 
Azure Logic Apps to automate business processes. 
• 
Azure Machine Learning to add machine learning and AI models to your solution. 
• 
Azure Stream Analytics to run real-time analytic computations on the data streaming from your devices. 
6.6.3.1 AZURE STREAM ANALYTICS 
Azure Stream Analytics is a real-time analytics and complex event-processing engine that is designed to 
analyze and process high volumes of fast streaming data from multiple sources simultaneously. Patterns and 
relationships can be identified in information extracted from a number of input sources including devices, 
sensors, clickstreams, social media feeds, and applications. These patterns can be used to trigger actions and 
initiate workflows such creating alerts, feeding information to a reporting tool, or storing transformed data for 
later use. Also, Stream Analytics is available on Azure IoT Edge runtime, and supports the same exact language 
or syntax as cloud. 
The following scenarios are examples of 
when you can use Azure Stream Analytics: 
• 
Analyze real-time telemetry streams 
from IoT devices 
• 
Web logs/clickstream analytics 
• 
Geospatial analytics for fleet 
management and driverless vehicles 
• 
Remote monitoring and predictive 
maintenance of high value assets 
• 
Real-time analytics on Point of Sale 
data for inventory control and 
anomaly detection 
 
 

Azure Fundamentals 
47 
 
An Azure Stream Analytics job consists of an input, query, and an output. Stream Analytics ingests data from 
Azure Event Hubs, Azure IoT Hub, or Azure Blob Storage. The query, which is based on SQL query language, can 
be used to easily filter, sort, aggregate, and join streaming data over a period of time. You can also extend this 
SQL language with JavaScript and C# user defined functions (UDFs). You can easily adjust the event ordering 
options and duration of time windows when preforming aggregation operations through simple language 
constructs and/or configurations. 
Each job has an output for the transformed data, and you can control what happens in response to the 
information you’ve analyzed. For example, you can: 
• 
Send data to services such as Azure Functions, Service Bus Topics or Queues to trigger communications 
or custom workflows downstream. 
• 
Send data to a Power BI dashboard for real-time dashboarding. 
• 
Store data in other Azure storage services to train a machine learning model based on historical data or 
perform batch analytics. 
6.6.3.2 IOT HUB TIERS 
The standard tier of IoT Hub enables all features, and is required for any IoT solutions that want to make use of 
the bi-directional communication capabilities. The basic tier enables a subset of the features and is intended 
for IoT solutions that only need uni-directional communication from devices to the cloud. Both tiers offer the 
same security and authentication features. IoT Hub also offers a free tier that is meant for testing and 
evaluation. It has all the capabilities of the standard tier, but limited messaging allowances. You cannot 
upgrade from the free tier to either basic or standard.

The IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service is a helper service for IoT Hub that enables zero-touch, just-in-time 
provisioning to the right IoT hub without requiring human intervention, allowing customers to provision millions 
of devices in a secure and scalable manner. 
 
 

48 
6.6.5 IOT EDGE 
Azure IoT Edge is an Internet of Things (IoT) service that builds on top of IoT Hub. This service is meant for 
customers who want to analyze data on devices, or “at the edge,” instead of in the cloud. By moving parts of 
your workload to the edge, your devices can spend less time sending messages to the cloud and react more 
quickly to events. 
6.6.6 AZURE DIGITAL TWINS 
This service enables you to create comprehensive models of the physical environment. You can model the 
relationships and interactions between people, spaces, and devices. For example, you can predict 
maintenance needs for a factory, analyze real-time energy requirements for an electrical grid, or optimize the

6.7.1 MACHINE LEARNING SERVICE 
Azure Machine Learning service is a cloud service that you use to train, deploy, automate, and manage 
machine learning models, all at the broad scale that the cloud provides. 
Machine learning is a data science technique that allows computers to use existing data to forecast future 
behaviors, outcomes, and trends. By using machine learning, computers learn without being explicitly 
programmed. Forecasts or predictions from machine learning can make apps and devices smarter. For 
example, when you shop online, machine learning helps recommend other products you might want based on 
what you’ve bought. Or when your credit card is swiped, machine learning compares the transaction to a 
database of transactions and helps detect fraud. And when your robot vacuum cleaner vacuums a room, 
machine learning helps it decide whether the job is done. 

Azure Fundamentals 
49 
 
Azure Machine Learning service provides a cloud-based environment you can use to prep data, train, test, 
deploy, manage, and track machine learning models. Start training on your local machine and then scale out to 
the cloud. The service fully supports open-source technologies such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, and scikit-learn 
and can be used for any kind of machine learning, from classical ml to deep learning, supervised and 
unsupervised learning. 
Explore and prepare data, train and test models, and deploy them using rich tools such as: 
• 
A visual interface in which you can drag and drop modules to build your experiments and then deploy 
models 
• 
Jupyter notebooks in which you use the SDKs to write your own code, such as these sample notebooks 
• 
Visual Studio Code extension. 
6.7.2 MACHINE LEARNING STUDIO 
Azure Machine Learning Studio is a fully-managed cloud service that enables you to easily build, deploy, and 
share predictive analytics solutions. 
 
Azure Machine Learning Studio 
To develop a predictive analysis model, you typically use data from one or more sources, transform, and 
analyze that data through various data manipulation and statistical functions, and generate a set of results. 
Developing a model like this is an iterative process. As you modify the various functions and their parameters, 
your results converge until you are satisfied that you have a trained, effective model. 
Azure Machine Learning Studio gives you an interactive, visual workspace to easily build, test, and iterate on a 
predictive analysis model. You drag-and-drop datasets and analysis modules onto an interactive canvas, 
connecting them together to form an experiment, which you run in Machine Learning Studio. To iterate on your 
model design, you edit the experiment, save a copy if desired, and run it again. When you’re ready, you can 
convert your training experiment to a predictive experiment, and then publish it as a web service so that your 
model can be accessed by others. 
There is no programming required, just visually connecting datasets and modules to construct your predictive 
analysis model.

Azure Machine Learning Studio 
6.7.3 HOW DOES AZURE MACHINE LEARNING SERVICE DIFFER FROM STUDIO? 
Machine Learning Studio is a collaborative, drag-and-drop visual workspace where you can build, test, and 
deploy machine learning solutions without needing to write code. It uses prebuilt and preconfigured machine 
learning algorithms and data-handling modules as well as a proprietary compute platform. 
Azure Machine Learning service provides both SDKs -and- a visual interface (preview), to quickly prep data, 
train and deploy machine learning models. This visual interface (preview) provides a similar drag-and-drop 
experience to Studio. However, unlike the proprietary compute platform of Studio, the visual interface uses 
your own compute resources and is fully integrated into Azure Machine Learning service. 
Here is a quick comparison.

pipeline, the data (raw or structured) is ingested into Azure through Azure Data Factory in batches, or streamed 
near real-time using Kafka, Event Hub, or IoT Hub. This data lands in a data lake for long term persisted 
storage, in Azure Blob Storage or Azure Data Lake Storage. As part of your analytics workflow, use Azure 
Databricks to read data from multiple data sources such as Azure Blob Storage, Azure Data Lake Storage, 
Azure Cosmos DB, or Azure SQL Data Warehouse and turn it into breakthrough insights using Spark.

In this module, you will: 
• 
Survey the data storage options in Azure 
• 
Discover how Azure data storage can meet your business demands 
• 
Compare Azure data storage with on-premises storage 
7.1 
BENEFITS OF USING AZURE TO STORE DATA 
7.1.1 WHY STORE YOUR DATA IN THE CLOUD? 
Here are some of the important benefits of Azure data storage: 
• 
Automated backup and recovery: mitigates the risk of losing your data if there is any unforeseen failure 
or interruption. 
• 
Replication across the globe: copies your data to protect it against any planned or unplanned events, 
such as scheduled maintenance or hardware failures. You can choose to replicate your data at multiple 
locations across the globe. 
• 
Support for data analytics: supports performing analytics on your data consumption. 
• 
Encryption capabilities: data is encrypted to make it highly secure; you also have tight control over who 
can access the data. 
• 
Multiple data types: Azure can store almost any type of data you need. It can handle video files, text files, 
and even large binary files like virtual hard disks. It also has many options for your relational and NoSQL 
data. 
• 
Data storage in virtual disks: Azure also has the capability of storing up to 8 TB of data in its virtual disks. 
This is a significant capability when you’re storing heavy data such as videos and simulations. 
• 
Storage tiers: storage tiers to prioritize access to data based on frequently used versus rarely used 
information. 
7.1.2 TYPES OF DATA 
There are three primary types of data that Azure Storage is designed to hold. 
• 
Structured data. Structured data is data that adheres to a schema, so all of the data has the same fields 
or properties. Structured data can be stored in a database table with rows and columns. Structured data 
relies on keys to indicate how one row in a table relates to data in another row of another table. 
Structured data is also referred to as relational data, as the data’s schema defines the table of data, the 
fields in the table, and the clear relationship between the two. Structured data is straightforward in that 
it’s easy to enter, query, and analyze. All of the data follows the same format. Examples of structured 
data include sensor data or financial data. 
• 
Semi-structured data. Semi-structured data doesn’t fit neatly into tables, rows, and columns. Instead, 
semi-structured data uses tags or keys that organize and provide a hierarchy for the data. Semi-
structured data is also referred to as non-relational or NoSQL data. 

Azure Fundamentals 
53 
 
• 
Unstructured data. Unstructured data encompasses data that has no designated structure to it. This also 
means that there are no restrictions on the kinds of data it can hold. For example, a blob can hold a PDF 
document, a JPG image, a JSON file, video content, etc. As such, unstructured data is becoming more 
prominent as businesses try to tap into new data sources. 
7.1.3 HOW AZURE DATA STORAGE CAN MEET YOUR BUSINESS STORAGE NEEDS 
Azure provides several storage options that accommodate specific types of data storage needs. 
7.1.3.1 AZURE SQL DATABASE 
Azure SQL Database is a relational database as a service (DaaS) based on the latest stable version of the 
Microsoft SQL Server database engine. SQL Database is a high-performance, reliable, fully managed and 
secure database. 
Azure Database Migration Service integrates some of the functionality of our existing tools and services. It 
provides customers with a comprehensive, highly available solution. The service uses the Data Migration 
Assistant to generate assessment reports that provide recommendations to guide you through the changes 
required prior to performing a migration. It’s up to you to perform any remediation required. When you’re ready 
to begin the migration process, Azure Database Migration Service performs all of the required steps. You can 
fire and forget your migration projects with peace of mind, knowing that the process takes advantage of best 
practices as determined by Microsoft. 
7.1.3.2 AZURE SQL DATA WAREHOUSE 
SQL Data Warehouse is a cloud-based Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) that uses Massively Parallel 
Processing (MPP) to quickly run complex queries across petabytes of data. Use SQL Data Warehouse as a key 
component of a big data solution. Import big data into SQL Data Warehouse with simple PolyBase T-SQL 
queries, and then use the power of MPP to run high-performance analytics. As you integrate and analyze, the 
data warehouse will become the single version of truth your business can count on for insights. 
SQL Data Warehouse is a key component of an end-to-end big data solution in the Cloud. 
 
SQL Data Warehouse 

54 
In a cloud data solution, data is ingested into big data stores from a variety of sources. Once in a big data 
store, Hadoop, Spark, and machine learning algorithms prepare and train the data. When the data is ready for 
complex analysis, SQL Data Warehouse uses PolyBase to query the big data stores. PolyBase uses standard T-
SQL queries to bring the data into SQL Data Warehouse. 
SQL Data Warehouse stores data into relational tables with columnar storage. This format significantly reduces 
the data storage costs, and improves query performance. Once data is stored in SQL Data Warehouse, you can 
run analytics at massive scale. Compared to traditional database systems, analysis queries finish in seconds 
instead of minutes, or hours instead of days. 
The analysis results can go to worldwide reporting databases or applications. Business analysts can then gain 
insights to make well-informed business decisions. 
7.1.3.3 AZURE COSMOS DB 
Today’s applications are required to be highly responsive and always online. To achieve low latency and high 
availability, instances of these applications need to be deployed in datacenters that are close to their users. 
Applications need to respond in real time to large changes in usage at peak hours, store ever increasing 
volumes of data, and make this data available to users in milliseconds. 
Azure Cosmos DB is Microsoft’s globally distributed, multi-model database service. With a click of a button, 
Cosmos DB enables you to elastically and independently scale throughput and storage across any number of 
Azure regions worldwide. You can elastically scale throughput and storage, and take advantage of fast, single-
digit-millisecond data access using your favorite API including SQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, Tables, or Gremlin. 
Azure Cosmos DB is a globally distributed database service. It supports schema-less data that lets you build 
highly responsive and Always On applications to support constantly changing data. 
7.1.3.4 AZURE STORAGE 
Azure Storage is Microsoft’s cloud storage solution for modern data storage scenarios. Azure Storage offers a 
massively scalable object store for data objects, a file system service for the cloud, a messaging store for 
reliable messaging, and a NoSQL store. 
Azure Storage includes these data services: 
• 
Azure Blobs: A massively scalable object store for text and binary data. 
• 
Azure Files: Managed file shares for cloud or on-premises deployments. 
• 
Azure Queues: A messaging store for reliable messaging between application components. 
• 
Azure Tables: A NoSQL store for schemaless storage of structured data. 
Each service is accessed through a storage account. 
 
 

Azure Fundamentals 
55 
 
7.1.3.4.1  AZURE BLOB STORAGE 
Azure Blob storage is Microsoft’s object storage solution for the cloud. Blob storage is optimized for storing 
massive amounts of unstructured data. Unstructured data is data that does not adhere to a particular data 
model or definition, such as text or binary data. 
Blob storage is designed for: 
• 
Serving images or documents directly to a browser. 
• 
Storing files for distributed access. 
• 
Streaming video and audio. 
• 
Writing to log files. 
• 
Storing data for backup and restore, disaster recovery, and archiving. 
• 
Storing data for analysis by an on-premises or Azure-hosted service. 
Users or client applications can access objects in Blob storage via HTTP/HTTPS, from anywhere in the world. 
Objects in Blob storage are accessible via the Azure Storage REST API, Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, or an Azure 
Storage client library. Client libraries are available for a variety of languages, including .NET, Java, Node.js, 
Python, Go, PHP, and Ruby. 
7.1.3.4.2  AZURE DATA LAKE STORAGE GEN2 
Blob storage supports Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, Microsoft’s enterprise big data analytics solution for the 
cloud. Data Lake Storage Gen2 makes Azure Storage the foundation for building enterprise data lakes on 
Azure. Designed from the start to service multiple petabytes of information while sustaining hundreds of 
gigabits of throughput, Data Lake Storage Gen2 allows you to easily manage massive amounts of data. 
Data lakes and data warehouses are both widely used for storing big data, but they are not interchangeable 
terms: 
- A data lake is a vast pool of raw data, the purpose for which is not yet defined.  
- A data warehouse is a repository for structured, filtered data that has already been processed for a specific 
purpose. 
The two common modes of accessing data are object-based (such as Azure Blob Storage) and file-based. In an 
object-based mode, there isn’t a hierarchy of objects. You simply store the object in a flat model. Traditional 
data lakes use the object-based access mode but using this mode isn’t always efficient because it requires 
that you individually interact with each object. A fundamental part of Data Lake Storage Gen2 is the addition of 
a hierarchical namespace to Blob storage. The hierarchical namespace organizes objects/files into a hierarchy 
of directories for efficient data access. A common object store naming convention uses slashes in the name to 
mimic a hierarchical directory structure. This structure becomes real with Data Lake Storage Gen2. Operations 
such as renaming or deleting a directory become single atomic metadata operations on the directory rather 
than enumerating and processing all objects that share the name prefix of the directory. 
The Data Lake feature allows you to perform analytics on your data usage and prepare reports. Data Lake is a 
large repository that stores both structured and unstructured data. Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 combines 
the scalability and cost benefits of object storage with the reliability and performance of the Big Data file 
system capabilities. It is ideal for performing analysis against large amounts of data that aren’t stored in a 
relational way.

In contrast, Azure Data Lake Analytics is an on-demand analytics job service that simplifies big data. Instead of 
deploying, configuring, and tuning hardware, you write queries to transform your data and extract valuable 
insights. The analytics service can handle jobs of any scale instantly by setting the dial for how much power you 
need. You only pay for your job when it is running, making it cost-effective. 
Azure HDInsight is a managed, full-spectrum, open-source analytics service for enterprises. HDInsight is a 
cloud service that makes it easy, fast, and cost-effective to process massive amounts of data. HDInsight also 
supports a broad range of scenarios, like extract, transform, and load (ETL); data warehousing; machine 
learning; and IoT. 
The easiest way to think of Data Lake is to think of this large container that has like a real lake with rivers 
coming into the river you never know where the rivers are coming from (or what “type” of river). Azure Data 
Lake was introduced to make big data easy for developers, data scientists, and analysts to store data of any 
size. It removes the complexities of ingesting and storing all your data while making it faster to get up and 
running with big data. Data Lake is able to store the mass different types of data (Structured data, 
unstructured data, log files, real-time, images, etc. ) and to blend that together, to correlate many different 
data types. The key thing here is as we are moving from traditional way to the modern tools (like Hadoop, 
Cassandra, NoSQL DB, etc.).  
Azure Data Lake includes three services: 
• 
Azure Data Lake Store, a no limits data lake that powers big data analytics 
• 
Azure Data Lake Analytics, a massively parallel on-demand job service 
• 
Azure HDInsight, a full managed Cloud Hadoop and Spark offering

Azure Data Lake Store is like a cloud-based file service or file system that is pretty much unlimited in size. We 
can run services on top of the data that’s in that store. So you could use Hadoop or Spark in an HDInsight 
cluster, or you could use the Azure Data Lake analytic service, which is a complement to the Azure Data Lake 
Store. And what that service will let you do is to run jobs that effectively query the data you have stored in the 
Azure Data Lake store and generate output results. 
7.1.3.4.3  AZURE FILES 
Azure Files enables you to set up highly available network file shares that can be accessed by using the 
standard Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. That means that multiple VMs can share the same files with 
both read and write access. You can also read the files using the REST interface or the storage client libraries. 
One thing that distinguishes Azure Files from files on a corporate file share is that you can access the files from 
anywhere in the world using a URL that points to the file and includes a shared access signature (SAS) token. 
You can generate SAS tokens; they allow specific access to a private asset for a specific amount of time. 
File shares can be used for many common scenarios: 
• 
Many on-premises applications use file shares. This feature makes it easier to migrate those applications 
that share data to Azure. If you mount the file share to the same drive letter that the on-premises 
application uses, the part of your application that accesses the file share should work with minimal, if 
any, changes. 
• 
Configuration files can be stored on a file share and accessed from multiple VMs. Tools and utilities used 
by multiple developers in a group can be stored on a file share, ensuring that everybody can find them, 
and that they use the same version. 
• 
Diagnostic logs, metrics, and crash dumps are just three examples of data that can be written to a file 
share and processed or analyzed later.

7.1.3.4.4  AZURE QUEUE 
Azure Queue storage is a service for storing large numbers of messages that can be accessed from anywhere 
in the world. 
Azure Queue Storage can be used to help build flexible applications and separate functions for better durability 
across large workloads. When application components are decoupled, they can scale independently. Queue 
storage provides asynchronous message queueing for communication between application components, 
whether they are running in the cloud, on the desktop, on-premises, or on mobile devices. 
You can use queue storage to: 
• 
Create a backlog of work and to pass messages between different Azure web servers. 
• 
Distribute load among different web servers/infrastructure and to manage bursts of traffic. 
• 
Build resilience against component failure when multiple users access your data at the same time. 
7.1.3.4.5  DISK STORAGE 
An Azure managed disk is a virtual hard disk (VHD). You can think of it like a physical disk in an on-premises 
server but, virtualized. Azure managed disks are stored as page blobs, which are a random IO storage object in 
Azure. We call a managed disk ‘managed’ because it is an abstraction over page blobs, blob containers, and 
Azure storage accounts. With managed disks, all you have to do is provision the disk, and Azure takes care of 
the rest. 
Disk storage provides disks for virtual machines, applications, and other services to access and use as they 
need, similar to how they would in on-premises scenarios. Disk storage allows data to be persistently stored 
and accessed from an attached virtual hard disk. The disks can be managed or unmanaged by Azure, and 
therefore managed and configured by the user. Typical scenarios for using disk storage are if you want to lift 
and shift applications that read and write data to persistent disks, or if you are storing data that is not required 
to be accessed from outside the virtual machine to which the disk is attached. 
7.1.3.4.6   AZURE TABLE 
Azure Table storage is a service that stores structured NoSQL data in the cloud, providing a key/attribute store 
with a schemaless design. Because Table storage is schemaless, it’s easy to adapt your data as the needs of 
your application evolve. Access to Table storage data is fast and cost-effective for many types of applications, 
and is typically lower in cost than traditional SQL for similar volumes of data. 
You can use Table storage to store flexible datasets like user data for web applications, address books, device 
information, or other types of metadata your service requires. You can store any number of entities in a table, 
and a storage account may contain any number of tables, up to the capacity limit of the storage account. 
Azure Table storage stores large amounts of structured data. The service is a NoSQL datastore which accepts 
authenticated calls from inside and outside the Azure cloud. Azure tables are ideal for storing structured, non-
relational data. Common uses of Table storage include: 
• 
Storing TBs of structured data capable of serving web scale applications 
• 
Storing datasets that don’t require complex joins, foreign keys, or stored procedures and can be 
denormalized for fast access 
• 
Quickly querying data using a clustered index 
• 
Accessing data using the OData protocol and LINQ queries with WCF Data Service .NET Libraries 

Azure Fundamentals

You can use Table storage to store and query huge sets of structured, non-relational data, and your tables will 
scale as demand increases.

7.1.3.4.7  DECIDING WHEN TO USE AZURE BLOBS, AZURE FILES, OR AZURE DISKS 
Microsoft Azure provides several features in Azure Storage for storing and accessing your data in the cloud. 
This article covers Azure Files, Blobs, and Disks, and is designed to help you choose between these features. 
The following table compares Files, Blobs, and Disks, and shows example scenarios appropriate for each. 
Feature 
Description 
When to use 
Azure 
Files 
Provides an SMB interface, client libraries, 
and a REST interface that allows access 
from anywhere to stored files 
You want to “lift and shift” an application to the 
cloud which already uses the native file system APIs 
to share data between it and other applications 
running in Azure. 
 
You want to store development and debugging tools 
that need to be accessed from many virtual 
machines. 
Azure 
Blobs 
Provides client libraries and a REST 
interface that allows unstructured data to be 
stored and accessed at a massive scale in 
block blobs.  
 
Also supports Azure Data Lake Storage 
Gen2 for enterprise big data analytics 
solutions. 
You want your application to support streaming and 
random access scenarios; You want to be able to 
access application data from anywhere.

and perform big data analytics. 
Azure 
Disks 
Provides client libraries and a REST 
interface that allows data to be persistently 
stored and accessed from an attached 
virtual hard disk 
You want to lift and shift applications that use 
native file system APIs to read and write data to 
persistent disks. 
 
You want to store data that is not required to be 
accessed from outside the virtual machine to which 
the disk is attached

7.1.3.5   STORAGE TIERS 
Azure storage offers different access tiers, which allow you to store blob object data in the most cost-effective 
manner. The available access tiers include: 
• 
Hot storage tier: optimized for storing data that is accessed frequently. 
• 
Cool storage tier: optimized for data that is infrequently accessed and stored for at least 30 days. 
• 
Archive storage tier: for data that is rarely accessed and stored for at least 180 days with flexible latency 
requirements. 
7.1.3.5.1   HOT ACCESS TIER 
The hot access tier has higher storage costs than cool and archive tiers, but the lowest access costs. Example 
usage scenarios for the hot access tier include: 
• 
Data that’s in active use or expected to be accessed (read from and written to) frequently. 
• 
Data that’s staged for processing and eventual migration to the cool access tier. 
7.1.3.5.2   COOL ACCESS TIER 
The cool access tier has lower storage costs and higher access costs compared to hot storage. This tier is 
intended for data that will remain in the cool tier for at least 30 days. Example usage scenarios for the cool 
access tier include: 
• 
Short-term backup and disaster recovery datasets. 
• 
Older media content not viewed frequently anymore but is expected to be available immediately when 
accessed. 
• 
Large data sets that need to be stored cost effectively while more data is being gathered for future 
processing. (For example, long-term storage of scientific data, raw telemetry data from a manufacturing 
facility) 
7.1.3.5.3   ARCHIVE ACCESS TIER 
The archive access tier has the lowest storage cost and higher data retrieval costs compared to hot and cool 
tiers. This tier is intended for data that can tolerate several hours of retrieval latency and will remain in the 
archive tier for at least 180 days. 
While a blob is in archive storage, the blob data is offline and cannot be read, copied, overwritten, or modified. 
You can’t take snapshots of a blob in archive storage. However, the blob metadata remains online and 
available, allowing you to list the blob and its properties. For blobs in archive, the only valid operations are 
GetBlobProperties, GetBlobMetadata, ListBlobs, SetBlobTier, and DeleteBlob. 
Example usage scenarios for the archive access tier include: 
• 
Long-term backup, secondary backup, and archival datasets 
• 
Original (raw) data that must be preserved, even after it has been processed into final usable form. (For 
example, Raw media files after transcoding into other formats) 
• 
Compliance and archival data that needs to be stored for a long time and is hardly ever accessed. (For 
example, security camera footage, old X-Rays/MRIs for healthcare organizations, audio recordings, and 
transcripts of customer calls for financial services)

7.1.3.6 ENCRYPTION AND REPLICATION 
Azure provides security and high availability to your data through encryption and replication features. The 
following encryption types are available for your resources: 
• 
Azure Storage Service Encryption (SSE) for data at rest helps you secure your data to meet the 
organization’s security and regulatory compliance. It encrypts the data before storing it and decrypts the 
data before retrieving it. The encryption and decryption are transparent to the user. 
• 
Client-side encryption is where the data is already encrypted by the client libraries. Azure stores the data 
in the encrypted state at rest, which is then decrypted during retrieval. 
7.1.3.7 REPLICATION FOR STORAGE AVAILABILITY 
A replication type is set up when you create a storage account. The replication feature ensures that your data is 
durable and always available. Azure provides regional and geographic replications to protect your data against 
natural disasters and other local disasters like fire or flooding.

8.1.1 CONNECTIVITY SERVICES 
This section describes services that provide connectivity between Azure resources, connectivity from an on-
premises network to Azure resources, and branch to branch connectivity in Azure. 
Service 
Why use? 
Virtual network 
Enables Azure resources to securely communicate with each other, the internet, and on-
premises networks. 
ExpressRoute 
Extends your on-premises networks into the Microsoft cloud over a private connection 
facilitated by a connectivity provider. 
VPN Gateway 
Sends encrypted traffic between an Azure virtual network and an on-premises location over 
the public Internet 
Virtual WAN 
Optimizes and automates branch connectivity to, and through, Azure. Azure regions serve as 
hubs that you can choose to connect your branches to. 
Azure DNS 
Hosts DNS domains that provide name resolution by using Microsoft Azure infrastructure. 
Azure Bastion 
(Preview) 
Configure secure and seamless RDP/SSH connectivity to your virtual machines directly in 
the Azure portal over SSL. When you connect via Azure Bastion, your virtual machines do not 
need a public IP address 
Azure Virtual Network (VNet) is the fundamental building block for your private network in Azure. You can use a 
VNets to: 
• 
Communicate between Azure resources: You can deploy VMs, and several other types of Azure resources 
to a virtual network  
• 
Communicate between each other: You can connect virtual networks to each other, enabling resources in 
either virtual network to communicate with each other, using virtual network peering. The virtual 
networks you connect can be in the same, or different, Azure regions. 
• 
Communicate to the internet: All resources in a VNet can communicate outbound to the internet, by 
default. You can communicate inbound to a resource by assigning a public IP address or a public Load 
Balancer. You can also use Public IP addresses or public Load Balancer to manage your outbound 
connections. 
• 
Communicate with on-premises networks: You can connect your on-
premises computers and networks to a virtual network using VPN 
Gateway or ExpressRoute. 
Azure Virtual Wide Area Network (WAN) is a networking service that provides 
optimized and automated branch connectivity to, and through, Azure. Azure 
regions serve as hubs that you can choose to connect your branches to. You 
can leverage the Azure backbone to also connect branches and enjoy 
branch-to-VNet connectivity.

8.1.2 APPLICATION PROTECTION SERVICES 
This section describes networking services in Azure that help protect your network resources. 
Service 
Why use? 
DDoS protection 
High availability for your applications with protection from excess IP traffic charges 
Web Application 
Firewall 
Azure WAF with Application Gateway provides regional protection to entities in public and 
private address space 
Azure WAF with Front Door provides protection at the network edge to public endpoints. 
 
Azure Firewall 
Azure Firewall is a managed, cloud-based network security service that protects your Azure 
Virtual Network resources. It’s a fully stateful firewall as a service with built-in high 
availability and unrestricted cloud scalability. 
Network security 
groups 
Full granular distributed end node control at VM/subnet for all network traffic flows 
Virtual network 
service endpoints

subnet 
8.1.3 APPLICATION DELIVERY SERVICES 
This section describes networking services in Azure that help deliver applications. 
Service 
Why use? 
Content Delivery 
Network 
Delivers high-bandwidth content to users. CDNs store cached content on edge servers in point-
of-presence (POP) locations that are close to end users, to minimize latency 
Azure Front Door 
Service 
Enables you to define, manage, and monitor the global routing for your web traffic by 
optimizing for best performance and instant global failover for high availability. 
Traffic Manager 
Distributes traffic based on DNS to services across global Azure regions, while providing high 
availability and responsiveness 
Load Balancer 
Provides regional load-balancing by routing traffic across availability zones and into your 
VNets. Provides internal load-balancing by routing traffic across and between your resources to 
build your regional application. 
Application 
Gateway 
Azure Application Gateway is a web traffic load balancer that enables you to manage traffic to 
your web applications. 
The services are broken into two categories. 
Global load balancing services such as Traffic Manager and Front Door distribute traffic from your end users 
across your regional backends, across clouds or even your hybrid on-premise services. Global load balancing 
routes your traffic to your closest service backend and reacts to changes in service reliability or performance to 
maintain always-on, maximal performance for your users 
Regional load balancing services such as Standard Load Balancer or Application Gateway provide the ability to 
distribute traffic within virtual networks (VNETs) across your virtual machines (VMs) or zonal service endpoints 
within a region. 
 

Azure Fundamentals 
65 
 
 
In summary:  
• 
Azure Front Door: a service that offers a single global entry point for customers accessing web apps, 
APIs, content and cloud services.     
• 
Application Gateway: uses Azure Load Balancer at the transport level and then applies the routing 
rules to support layer-7 ( HTTP) load balancing.  
• 
Azure Traffic Manager: load balancer for geographically distributed datacenters. Azure Traffic Manager 
uses DNS to redirect requests to an appropriate geographical location endpoint. Traffic Manager does 
not see the traffic passing between the client and the service. It simply redirects the request based on 
most appropriate endpoints 
8.1.4  NETWORK MONITORING SERVICES 
This section describes networking services in Azure that help monitor your network resources. 
Service 
Why use? 
Network Watcher 
Helps monitor and troubleshoot connectivity issues, helps diagnose VPN, NSG, and routing

8.2 
DEPLOY YOUR SITE TO AZURE 
8.2.1 USING AN N-TIER ARCHITECTURE 
An architectural pattern that can be used to build loosely coupled systems is N-tier. An N-
tier architecture divides an application into two or more logical tiers. Architecturally, a 
higher tier can access services from a lower tier, but a lower tier should never access a 
higher tier. 
Tiers help separate concerns and are ideally designed to be reusable. Using a tiered 
architecture also simplifies maintenance. Tiers can be updated or replaced 
independently, and new tiers can be inserted if needed. 
Three-tier refers to an n-tier application that has three tiers. Your e-commerce web 
application follows this three-tier architecture: 
• 
The web tier provides the web interface to your users through a browser. 
• 
The application tier runs business logic. 
• 
The data tier includes databases and other storage that hold product information 
and customer orders. 
The following illustration shows the flow of a request from the user to the data tier.  
8.2.1.1 WHAT’S AN AZURE REGION? 
A region is one or more Azure data centers within a specific geographic location. East US, West US, and North 
Europe are examples of regions. In this instance, you see that the application is running in the East US region. 
8.2.1.2 WHAT’S A VIRTUAL NETWORK? 
A virtual network is a logically isolated network on Azure. A virtual network allows Azure resources to securely 
communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks. A virtual network is scoped to a single 
region; however, multiple virtual networks from different regions can be connected together using virtual 
network peering. 
Virtual networks can be segmented into one or more subnets. Subnets enable you to segment the virtual 
network into one or more sub-networks and allocate a portion of the virtual network’s address space to each 
subnet. You can then deploy Azure resources in a specific subnet. Just like in a traditional network, subnets 
allow you to segment your VNet address space into segments that are appropriate for the organization’s 
internal network. This also improves address allocation efficiency. You can secure resources within subnets 
using Network Security Groups. 
Users interact with the web tier directly, so that VM has a public IP address along with a private IP address. 
Users don’t interact with the application or data tiers, so these VMs each have a private IP address only. 
You can also keep your service or data tiers in your on-premises network, placing your web tier into the cloud, 
but keeping tight control over other aspects of your application. A VPN gateway (or virtual network gateway), 
enables this scenario. It can provide a secure connection between an Azure Virtual Network and an on-
premises location over the internet. A VPN gateway is a specific type of virtual network gateway that is used to 
send encrypted traffic between an Azure virtual network and an on-premises location over the public Internet. 
You can also use a VPN gateway to send encrypted traffic between Azure virtual networks over the Microsoft 

Azure Fundamentals 
67 
 
network. Each virtual network can have only one VPN gateway. However, you can create multiple connections 
to the same VPN gateway. When you create multiple connections to the same VPN gateway, all VPN tunnels 
share the available gateway bandwidth. 
Azure manages the physical hardware for you. You configure virtual networks and gateways through software, 
which enables you to treat a virtual network just like your own network. You choose which networks your virtual 
network can reach, whether that’s the public internet or other networks in the private IP address space. 
8.2.1.3 WHAT’S A NETWORK SECURITY GROUP? 
A network security group, or NSG, allows or denies inbound network traffic to your Azure resources. Think of a 
network security group as a cloud-level firewall for your network. 
For example, notice that the VM in the web tier allows inbound traffic on ports 22 (SSH) and 80 (HTTP). This 
VM’s network security group allows inbound traffic over these ports from all sources. You can configure a 
network security group to accept traffic only from known sources, such as IP addresses that you trust. 
8.3 
SCALE WITH AZURE LOAD BALANCER 
8.3.1 WHAT ARE AVAILABILITY AND HIGH AVAILABILITY? 
Availability refers to how long your service is up and running without interruption. High availability, or highly 
available, refers to a service that’s up and running for a long period of time. High Availability is the concept or 
goal of ensuring your critical systems are always functioning. In practice, this means creating and managing 
the ability to automatically “failover” to a secondary system if the primary system goes down for any reason as 
well as eliminating all single points of failure from your infrastructure. 
Fault Tolerance describes a computer system or technology infrastructure that is designed in such a way that 
when one component fails (be it hardware or software), a backup component takes over operations 
immediately so that there is no loss of service. The concept of having backup components in place is called 
redundancy and the more backup components you have in place, the more tolerant your network is hardware 
and software failure. 
The main and most important difference between high availability and fault tolerance, is actually that if an 
error occurs during an active action, a highly available system does not ensure the correct end state of that 
action, whilst a fault tolerant one, does. In other words, if, for instance, a web request is being processed by 
your highly available platform, and one of the nodes crashes, that user will probably get a 500 error back from 
the API, but the system will still be responsive for following requests. In the case of a fault-tolerant platform, 
the failure will somehow (more on this in a minute) be worked-around and the request will finish correctly, so 
the user can get a valid response. The second case will most likely take longer, due to the extra steps. 
Disaster Recovery refers to the set of policies and procedures in place to ensure the continuity and recovery of 
mission critical systems in the event of a disruptive event such as a power outage, flood, or cyberattack. In 
other words, how quickly can you get your computers and systems up and running after a disastrous event? It 
might seem as though you don’t need a disaster recovery infrastructure if your systems are configured with HA 
or FT. After all, if your servers can survive downtime with 99.999% or better availability, why set up a separate 
DR site? DR goes beyond FT or HA and consists of a complete plan to recover critical business systems and 
normal operations in the event of a catastrophic disaster like a major weather event (hurricane, flood, tornado, 
etc), a cyberattack, or any other cause of significant downtime. HA is often a major component of DR, which 
can also consist of an entirely separate physical infrastructure site with a 1:1 replacement for every critical 
infrastructure component, or at least as many as required to restore the most essential business functions. 

68 
8.3.2 WHAT IS RESILIENCY? 
Resiliency refers to a system’s ability to stay operational during abnormal conditions. These conditions include: 
• 
Natural disasters 
• 
System maintenance, both planned and unplanned, including software updates and security patches. 
• 
Spikes in traffic to your site 
• 
Threats made by malicious parties, such as distributed denial of service, or DDoS, attacks 
8.3.3 WHAT IS A LOAD BALANCER? 
A load balancer distributes traffic evenly among each system in a pool. A load balancer can help you achieve 
both high availability and resiliency. The load balancer becomes the entry point to the user. The user doesn’t 
know (or need to know) which system the load balancer chooses to receive the request. 
Load balancing enables you to run maintenance tasks without interrupting 
service. For example, you can stagger the maintenance window for each VM. 
During the maintenance window, the load balancer detects that the VM is 
unresponsive, and directs traffic to other VMs in the pool. 
The load balancer receives the user’s request and directs the request to one 
of the VMs in the web tier. If a VM is unavailable or stops responding, the 
load balancer stops sending traffic to it. The load balancer then directs traffic 
to one of the responsive servers. 
 
Load balancing enables you to run maintenance tasks without interrupting service. For example, you can 
stagger the maintenance window for each VM. During the maintenance window, the load balancer detects that 
the VM is unresponsive, and directs traffic to other VMs in the pool. 
8.3.4 WHAT IS AZURE LOAD BALANCER? 
Azure Load Balancer is a load balancer service that Microsoft provides that helps 
take care of the maintenance for you. Load Balancer supports inbound and 
outbound scenarios, provides low latency and high throughput, and scales up to 
millions of flows for all Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram 
Protocol (UDP) applications. 
You can use Load Balancer with incoming internet traffic, internal traffic across 
Azure services, port forwarding for specific traffic, or outbound connectivity for VMs 
in your virtual network. 
 
 
 

Azure Fundamentals 
69 
 
8.3.5 AZURE APPLICATION GATEWAY 
If all your traffic is HTTP, a potentially better option is to use Azure Application Gateway. Application Gateway is 
a load balancer designed for web applications. It uses Azure Load Balancer at the transport level (TCP) and 
applies sophisticated URL-based routing rules to support several advanced scenarios. 
With Application Gateway, you can make routing decisions based on additional attributes of an HTTP request, 
such as URI path or host headers. For example, you can route traffic based on the incoming URL. So if /images 
is in the incoming URL, you can route traffic to a specific set of servers (known as a pool) configured for 
images. If /video is in the URL, that traffic is routed to another pool that’s optimized for videos. 
 
Azure application gateway 
This type of routing is known as application layer (OSI layer 7) load balancing since it understands the structure 
of the HTTP message. 
Here are some of the benefits of using Azure Application Gateway over a simple load balancer: 
• 
Cookie affinity. Useful when you want to keep a user session on the same backend server. 
• 
SSL termination. Application Gateway can manage your SSL certificates and pass unencrypted traffic to 
the backend servers to avoid encryption/decryption overhead. It also supports full end-to-end encryption 
for applications that require that. 
• 
Web application firewall. Application gateway supports a sophisticated firewall (WAF) with detailed 
monitoring and logging to detect malicious attacks against your network infrastructure. 
• 
URL rule-based routes. Application Gateway allows you to route traffic based on URL patterns, source IP 
address and port to destination IP address and port. This is helpful when setting up a content delivery 
network. 
• 
Rewrite HTTP headers. You can add or remove information from the inbound and outbound HTTP 
headers of each request to enable important security scenarios, or scrub sensitive information such as 
server names. 
Azure Application Gateway offers a web application firewall (WAF) that provides centralized protection of your 
web applications from common exploits and vulnerabilities. Web applications are increasingly targeted by 
malicious attacks that exploit commonly known vulnerabilities. SQL injection and cross-site scripting are 
among the most common attacks. A WAF solution can react to a security threat faster by centrally patching a 
known vulnerability, instead of securing each individual web application. Existing application gateways can 
easily be converted into firewall-enabled application gateways. The Application Gateway WAF is based on Core 
Rule Set (CRS) 3.0 or 2.2.9 from the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP). The WAF automatically 
updates to include protection against new vulnerabilities, with no additional configuration needed. 

70 
 
Web application firewall 
A content delivery network (CDN) is a distributed network of servers that can efficiently deliver web content to 
users. It is a way to get content to users in their local region to minimize latency. CDN can be hosted in Azure or 
any other location. You can cache content at strategically placed physical nodes across the world and provide 
better performance to end users. Typical usage scenarios include web applications containing multimedia 
content, a product launch event in a particular region, or any event where you expect a high-bandwidth 
requirement in a region. 
8.3.6 WHAT ABOUT DNS? 
DNS, or Domain Name System, is a way to map user-friendly names to their IP 
addresses. You can think of DNS as the phonebook of the internet. For 
example, your domain name, contoso.com, might map to the IP address of the 
load balancer at the web tier, 40.65.106.192.  
You can bring your own DNS server or use Azure DNS, a hosting service for DNS 
domains that runs on Azure infrastructure. 
8.4 
REDUCE LATENCY WITH AZURE TRAFFIC MANAGER 
Previously, you saw how Azure Load Balancer helps you achieve high availability and minimize downtime. 
Although your e-commerce site is more highly available, it doesn’t solve the issue of latency or create resiliency 
across geographic regions. How can you make your site, which is located in the United States, load faster for 
users located in Europe or Asia? 
8.4.1 WHAT IS NETWORK LATENCY? 
Latency refers to the time it takes for data to travel over the network. Latency is typically measured in 
milliseconds. Compare latency to bandwidth. Bandwidth refers to the amount of data that can fit on the 
connection. Latency refers to the time it takes for that data to reach its destination. 
Factors such as the type of connection you use and how your application is designed can affect latency. But 
perhaps the biggest factor is distance. 
Think about your e-commerce site on Azure, which is in the East US region. It would typically take less time to 
transfer data to Atlanta (a distance of around 400 miles) than to transfer data to London (a distance of around 
4,000 miles). Your e-commerce site delivers standard HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images. The network latency 
for many files can add up. How can you reduce latency for users located far away geographically?

8.4.2 USE TRAFFIC MANAGER TO ROUTE USERS TO THE CLOSEST ENDPOINT 
Recall that Azure provides data centers in regions across the globe. Azure Traffic Manager uses the DNS server 
that’s closest to the user to direct user traffic to a globally distributed endpoint. 
 
Azure Traffic Manager 
Traffic Manager doesn’t see the traffic that’s passed between the client and server. Rather, it directs the client 
web browser to a preferred endpoint. Traffic Manager can route traffic in a few different ways, such as to the 
endpoint with the lowest latency. 
8.4.3 COMPARE LOAD BALANCER TO TRAFFIC MANAGER 
Azure Load Balancer distributes traffic within the same region to make your services more highly available and 
resilient. Traffic Manager works at the DNS level, and directs the client to a preferred endpoint. This endpoint 
can be to the region that’s closest to your user. 
Load Balancer and Traffic Manager both help make your services more resilient, but in slightly different ways. 
When Load Balancer detects an unresponsive VM, it directs traffic to other VMs in the pool. Traffic Manager 
monitors the health of your endpoints. In contrast, when Traffic Manager finds an unresponsive endpoint, it 
directs traffic to the next closest endpoint that is responsive.

SECURITY, RESPONSIBILITY AND TRUST IN AZURE 
In this module, you will: 
• 
Learn how security responsibility is shared with Azure 
• 
Learn how identity management provides protection, even outside your network 
• 
Learn how encryption capabilities built into Azure can protect your data 
• 
Learn how to protect your network and virtual networks 
• 
Learn about advanced services and features Azure provides to keep your services and data secure and 
safe 
9.1 
CLOUD SECURITY IS A SHARED RESPONSIBILITY 
9.1.1 SHARE SECURITY RESPONSIBILITY WITH AZURE 
The first shift you’ll make is from on-premises data centers to infrastructure as a service (IaaS). With IaaS, you 
are leveraging the lowest-level service and asking Azure to create virtual machines (VMs) and virtual networks. 
At this level, it’s still your responsibility to patch and secure your operating systems and software, as well as 
configure your network to be secure. 
Moving to platform as a service (PaaS) outsources a lot of security concerns. At this level, Azure is taking care 
of the operating system and of most foundational software like database management systems. Everything is 
updated with the latest security patches and can be integrated with Azure Active Directory for access controls. 
PaaS also comes with a lot of operational advantages. Rather than building whole infrastructures and subnets 
for your environments by hand, you can “point and click” within the Azure portal or run automated scripts to 
bring complex, secured systems up and down, and scale them as needed. Contoso Shipping uses Azure Event 
Hubs for ingesting telemetry data from drones and trucks — as well as a web app with an Azure Cosmos DB 
back end with its mobile apps — which are all examples of PaaS. 
With software as a service (SaaS), you outsource almost everything. SaaS is software that runs with an internet 
infrastructure. The code is controlled by the vendor but configured to be used by the customer.

9.1.2 A LAYERED APPROACH TO SECURITY 
Defense in depth is a strategy that employs a series of mechanisms to slow the advance of an attack aimed at 
acquiring unauthorized access to information. Each layer provides protection so that if one layer is breached, a 
subsequent layer is already in place to prevent further exposure. Microsoft applies a layered approach to 
security, both in physical data centers and across Azure services. The objective of defense in depth is to 
protect and prevent information from being stolen by individuals who are not authorized to access it. 
Defense in depth can be visualized as a set of concentric rings, with the data to be secured at the center. Each 
ring adds an additional layer of security around the data. This approach removes reliance on any single layer of 
protection and acts to slow down an attack and provide alert telemetry that can be acted upon, either 
automatically or manually. Let’s take a look at each of the layers. 
 
9.1.2.1 DATA 
In almost all cases, attackers are after data: 
• 
Stored in a database 
• 
Stored on disk inside virtual machines 
• 
Stored on a SaaS application such as Office 365 
• 
Stored in cloud storage 
It’s the responsibility of those storing and controlling access to data to ensure that it’s properly secured. Often, 
there are regulatory requirements that dictate the controls and processes that must be in place to ensure the 
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data. 
9.1.2.2 APPLICATION 
• 
Ensure applications are secure and free of vulnerabilities. 
• 
Store sensitive application secrets in a secure storage medium. 
• 
Make security a design requirement for all application development. 
Integrating security into the application development life cycle will help reduce the number of vulnerabilities 
introduced in code. We encourage all development teams to ensure their applications are secure by default, 
and that they’re making security requirements non-negotiable. 
 
 

74 
9.1.2.3 COMPUTE 
• 
Secure access to virtual machines. 
• 
Implement endpoint protection and keep systems patched and current. 
Malware, unpatched systems, and improperly secured systems open your environment to attacks. The focus in 
this layer is on making sure your compute resources are secure, and that you have the proper controls in place 
to minimize security issues. 
9.1.2.4 NETWORKING 
• 
Limit communication between resources. 
• 
Deny by default. 
• 
Restrict inbound internet access and limit outbound, where appropriate. 
• 
Implement secure connectivity to on-premises networks. 
At this layer, the focus is on limiting the network connectivity across all your resources to allow only what is 
required. By limiting this communication, you reduce the risk of lateral movement throughout your network. 
9.1.2.5 PERIMETER 
• 
Use distributed denial of service (DDoS) protection to filter large-scale attacks before they can cause a 
denial of service for end users. 
• 
Use perimeter firewalls to identify and alert on malicious attacks against your network. 
At the network perimeter, it’s about protecting from network-based attacks against your resources. Identifying 
these attacks, eliminating their impact, and alerting you when they happen are important ways to keep your 
network secure. 
9.1.2.6 IDENTITY AND ACCESS 
• 
Control access to infrastructure and change control. 
• 
Use single sign-on and multi-factor authentication. 
• 
Audit events and changes. 
The identity and access layer is all about ensuring identities are secure, access granted is only what is needed, 
and changes are logged. 
9.1.2.7 PHYSICAL SECURITY 
• 
Physical building security and controlling access to computing hardware within the data center is the first 
line of defense. 
With physical security, the intent is to provide physical safeguards against access to assets. This ensures that 
other layers can’t be bypassed, and loss or theft is handled appropriately.

GET TIPS FROM AZURE SECURITY CENTER 
A great place to start when examining the security of your Azure-based solutions is Azure Security Center. 
Security Center is a monitoring service that provides threat protection across all of your services both in Azure, 
and on-premises. Security Center can: 
• 
Provide security recommendations based on your configurations, resources, and networks. 
• 
Monitor security settings across on-premises and cloud workloads, and automatically apply required 
security to new services as they come online. 
• 
Continuously monitor all your services, and perform automatic security assessments to identify potential 
vulnerabilities before they can be exploited. 
• 
Use machine learning to detect and block malware from being installed on your virtual machines and 
services. You can also define a list of allowed applications to ensure that only the apps you validate are 
allowed to execute. 
• 
Analyze and identify potential inbound attacks, and help to investigate threats and any post-breach 
activity that might have occurred. 
• 
Provide just-in-time access control for ports, reducing your attack surface by ensuring the network only 
allows traffic that you require. 
9.2.1 COVERAGE 
There are three primary areas of coverage in Security Center: 
• 
Policy & Compliance: Provides a secure and overall score of how secure your resources are. This area 
also covers your compliance with regulatory standards. 
 
• 
Resource Security Hygiene: Provides a high-level overview of the health of your resources from a security 
perspective. Security issues are categorized as high, medium or low severity. 
 
• 
Threat Protection: Shows you any active or past attacks or threats on your resources. 
Microsoft Threat Intelligence is used to identify security threats. It does this by using historical data and 
machine learning. This service is obtained by using the Azure Advanced Threat Protection service. 
9.2.2 AVAILABLE TIERS 
Azure Security Center is available in two tiers: 
• 
Free. Available as part of your Azure subscription, this tier is limited to assessments and 
recommendations of Azure resources only. 
• 
Standard. This tier provides a full suite of security-related services including continuous monitoring, 
threat detection, just-in-time access control for ports, and more.

9.3 
IDENTITY AND ACCESS 
Network perimeters, firewalls, and physical access controls used to be the primary protection for corporate 
data. But network perimeters have become increasingly porous with the explosion of bring your own device 
(BYOD), mobile apps, and cloud applications. 
Identity has become the new primary security boundary. Therefore, proper authentication and assignment of 
privileges is critical to maintaining control of your data. 
9.3.1 AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION 
Two fundamental concepts that need to be understood when talking about identity and access control are 
authentication and authorization. They underpin everything else that happens and occur sequentially in any 
identity and access process: 
• 
Authentication is the process of establishing the identity of a person or service looking to access a 
resource. It involves the act of challenging a party for legitimate credentials, and provides the basis for 
creating a security principal for identity and access control use. It establishes if they are who they say 
they are. 
 
• 
Authorization is the process of establishing what level of access an authenticated person or service has. 
It specifies what data they’re allowed to access and what they can do with it. 
Azure provides services to manage both authentication and authorization through Azure Active Directory (Azure 
AD). 
9.3.2 WHAT IS AZURE ACTIVE DIRECTORY? 
Azure AD is a cloud-based identity service. It has built in support for synchronizing with your existing on-
premises Active Directory or can be used stand-alone. This means that all your applications, whether on-
premises, in the cloud (including Office 365), or even mobile can share the same credentials. Administrators 
and developers can control access to internal and external data and applications using centralized rules and 
policies configured in Azure AD. 
Azure AD provides services such as: 
• 
Authentication. This includes verifying identity to access applications and resources, and providing 
functionality such as self-service password reset, multi-factor authentication (MFA), a custom banned 
password list, and smart lockout services. 
• 
Single-Sign-On (SSO). SSO enables users to remember only one ID and one password to access multiple 
applications. A single identity is tied to a user, simplifying the security model. As users change roles or 
leave an organization, access modifications are tied to that identity, greatly reducing the effort needed to 
change or disable accounts. 
• 
Application management. You can manage your cloud and on-premises apps using Azure AD Application 
Proxy, SSO, the My apps portal (also referred to as Access panel), and SaaS apps. 
• 
Business to business (B2B) identity services. Manage your guest users and external partners while 
maintaining control over your own corporate data Business-to-Customer (B2C) identity services. 

Azure Fundamentals 
77 
 
Customize and control how users sign up, sign in, and manage their profiles when using your apps with 
services. 
• 
Business to consumer (B2C) identity services. Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) B2C is a business-to-
consumer identity management service. This service enables you to customize and control how users 
securely interact with your web, desktop, mobile, or single-page applications. Using Azure AD B2C, users 
can sign up, sign in, reset passwords, and edit profiles. Azure AD B2C implements a form of the OpenID 
Connect and OAuth 2.0 protocols. The important key in the implementation of these protocols is the 
security tokens and their claims that enable you to provide secure access to resources. 
• 
Device Management. Manage how your cloud or on-premises devices access your corporate data. 
9.3.3 SINGLE SIGN-ON 
The more identities a user has to manage, the greater the risk of a credential-related security incident. More 
identities mean more passwords to remember and change. Password policies can vary between applications 
and, as complexity requirements increase, it becomes increasingly difficult for users to remember them. 
With single sign-on (SSO), users need to remember only one ID and one password. Access across applications 
is granted to a single identity tied to a user, simplifying the security model. As users change roles or leave an 
organization, access modifications are tied to the single identity, greatly reducing the effort needed to change 
or disable accounts. Using single sign-on for accounts will make it easier for users to manage their identities 
and will increase the security capabilities in your environment. 
9.3.4 MULTI-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION 
Multi-factor authentication (MFA) provides additional security for your identities by requiring two or more 
elements for full authentication. These elements fall into three categories: 
• 
Something you know 
• 
Something you possess 
• 
Something you are 
Something you know would be a password or the answer to a security question. Something you possess could 
be a mobile app that receives a notification or a token-generating device. Something you are is typically some 
sort of biometric property, such as a fingerprint or face scan used on many mobile devices. 
Using MFA increases security of your identity by limiting the impact of credential exposure. An attacker who has 
a user’s password would also need to have possession of their phone or their face in order to fully 
authenticate. Authentication with only a single factor verified is insufficient, and the attacker would be unable 
to use those credentials to authenticate. The benefits this brings to security are huge, and we can’t emphasize 
enough the importance of enabling MFA wherever possible. 
Azure AD has MFA capabilities built in and will integrate with other third-party MFA providers. It’s provided free 
of charge to any user who has the Global Administrator role in Azure AD, because these are highly sensitive 
accounts. All other accounts can have MFA enabled by purchasing licenses with this capability — as well as 
assigning a license to the account. 
 
 

78 
Multi-Factor Authentication comes as part of the following offerings: 
• 
Azure Active Directory Premium or Microsoft 365 Business - Full featured use of Azure Multi-Factor 
Authentication using Conditional Access policies to require multi-factor authentication. 
• 
Azure AD Free or standalone Office 365 licenses - Use pre-created Conditional Access baseline protection 
policies to require multi-factor authentication for your users and administrators. 
• 
Azure Active Directory Global Administrators - A subset of Azure Multi-Factor Authentication capabilities 
are available as a means to protect global administrator accounts. 
9.3.4.1 CONDITIONAL ACCESS 
Conditional Access is a capability of Azure Active Directory. With Conditional Access, you can implement 
automated access control decisions for accessing your cloud apps that are based on conditions. 
 
Conditional Access 
In a mobile-first, cloud-first world, Azure Active Directory enables single sign-on to devices, apps, and services 
from anywhere. With the proliferation of devices (including BYOD), work off corporate networks, and third-party 
SaaS apps, you are faced with two opposing goals: 
• 
Empower users to be productive wherever and whenever  
• 
Protect the corporate assets at any time  
By using Conditional Access policies, you can apply the right access controls under the required conditions. 
Azure AD Conditional Access provides you with added security when needed and stays out of your user’s way 
when it isn’t. 
Following are some common access concerns that Conditional Access can help you with: 
• 
Sign-in risk: Azure AD Identity Protection detects sign-in risks. How do you restrict access if a detected 
sign-in risk indicates a bad actor? What if you would like to get stronger evidence that a sign-in was 
performed by the legitimate user? What if your doubts are strong enough to even block specific users 
from accessing an app? 
• 
Network location: Azure AD is accessible from anywhere. What if an access attempt is performed from a 
network location that is not under the control of your IT department? A username and password 
combination might be good enough as proof of identity for access attempts from your corporate network. 
What if you demand a stronger proof of identity for access attempts that are initiated from other 
unexpected countries or regions of the world? What if you even want to block access attempts from 
certain locations? 

Azure Fundamentals 
79 
 
• 
Device management: In Azure AD, users can access cloud apps from a broad range of devices including 
mobile and also personal devices. What if you demand that access attempts should only be performed 
with devices that are managed by your IT department? What if you even want to block certain device 
types from accessing cloud apps in your environment? 
• 
Client application: Today, you can access many cloud apps using different app types such as web-based 
apps, mobile apps, or desktop apps. What if an access attempt is performed using a client app type that 
causes known issues? What if you require a device that is managed by your IT department for certain app 
types? 
Note 1: Using this feature requires an Azure AD Premium P1 license. 
Note 2: Azure MFA is enabled via the Conditional Access tab 
9.3.4.2 AZURE ACTIVE DIRECTORY IDENTITY PROTECTION 
Azure Active Directory Identity Protection enables organizations to configure automated responses to detected 
suspicious actions related to user identities. Azure Active Directory Identity Protection is more than a 
monitoring and reporting tool. To protect your organization’s identities, you can configure risk-based policies 
that automatically respond to detected issues when a specified risk level has been reached. These policies, in 
addition to other Conditional Access controls provided by Azure Active Directory and Enterprise Mobility + 
Security (EMS), can either automatically block or initiate adaptive remediation actions including password 
resets and multi-factor authentication enforcement. 
9.3.5 PROVIDING IDENTITIES TO SERVICES 
It’s usually valuable for services to have identities. Often, and against best practices, credential information is 
embedded in configuration files. With no security around these configuration files, anyone with access to the 
systems or repositories can access these credentials and risk exposure. 
Azure AD addresses this problem through two methods: service principals and managed identities for Azure 
services. 
9.3.5.1 SERVICE PRINCIPALS 
To understand service principals, it’s useful to first understand the words identity and principal, because of 
how they are used in the identity management world. 
An identity is just a thing that can be authenticated. Obviously, this includes users with a user name and 
password, but it can also include applications or other servers, which might authenticate with secret keys or 
certificates. 
A principal is an identity acting with certain roles or claims. Usually, it is not useful to consider identity and 
principal separately, but think of using sudo on a Bash prompt in Linux or on Windows using “run as 
Administrator.” In both those cases, you are still logged in as the same identity as before, but you’ve changed 
the role under which you are executing. Groups are often also considered principals because they can have 
rights assigned. 
A service principal is an identity that is used by a service or application. And like other identities, it can be 
assigned roles. 
 

80 
9.3.5.2 MANAGED IDENTITIES FOR AZURE SERVICES 
The creation of service principals can be a tedious process, and there are a lot of touch points that can make 
maintaining them difficult. Managed identities for Azure services are much easier and will do most of the work 
for you. 
A managed identity can be instantly created for any Azure service that supports it—and the list is constantly 
growing. When you create a managed identity for a service, you are creating an account on the Azure AD 
tenant. The Azure infrastructure will automatically take care of authenticating the service and managing the 
account. You can then use that account like any other Azure AD account, including securely letting the 
authenticated service access other Azure resources. 
9.3.6 ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL 
Roles are sets of permissions, like “Read-only” or “Contributor”, that users can be granted to access an Azure 
service instance. 
Identities are mapped to roles directly or through group membership. Separating security principals, access 
permissions, and resources provides simple access management and fine-grained control. Administrators are 
able to ensure the minimum necessary permissions are granted. 
Roles can be granted at the individual service instance level, but they also flow down the Azure Resource 
Manager hierarchy. 
Here’s a diagram that shows this relationship. Roles assigned at a higher scope, like an entire subscription, are 
inherited by child scopes, like service instances. 
 
Role Assignment Scope 
9.3.6.1 PRIVILEGED IDENTITY MANAGEMENT 
In addition to managing Azure resource access with role-based access control (RBAC), a comprehensive 
approach to infrastructure protection should consider including the ongoing auditing of role members as their 
organization changes and evolves. Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Privileged Identity Management (PIM) is a 
service that enables you to manage, control, and monitor access to important resources in your organization. 
This includes access to resources in Azure AD, Azure resources, and other Microsoft Online Services like Office 
365 or Microsoft Intune. 
 
 

Azure Fundamentals 
81 
 
PIM essentially helps you manage the who, what, when, where, and why for resources that you care about. 
Here are some of the key features of PIM: 
• 
Provide just-in-time privileged access to Azure AD and Azure resources 
• 
Assign time-bound access to resources using start and end dates 
• 
Require approval to activate privileged roles 
• 
Enforce multi-factor authentication to activate any role 
• 
Use justification to understand why users activate 
• 
Get notifications when privileged roles are activated 
• 
Conduct access reviews to ensure users still need roles 
• 
Download audit history for internal or external audit 
Using this feature requires an Azure AD Premium P2 license. 
9.4 
ENCRYPTION 
9.4.1 WHAT IS ENCRYPTION 
Encryption is the process of making data unreadable and unusable to unauthorized viewers. To use or read the 
encrypted data, it must be decrypted, which requires the use of a secret key. There are two top-level types of 
encryption: symmetric and asymmetric. 
Symmetric encryption uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt the data. Consider a desktop password 
manager application. You enter your passwords and they are encrypted with your own personal key (your key is 
often derived from your master password). When the data needs to be retrieved, the same key is used, and the 
data is decrypted. 
Asymmetric encryption uses a public key and private key pair. Either key can encrypt but a single key can’t 
decrypt its own encrypted data. To decrypt, you need the paired key. Asymmetric encryption is used for things 
like Transport Layer Security (TLS) (used in HTTPS) and data signing. 
Both symmetric and asymmetric encryption play a role in properly securing your data. Encryption is typically 
approached in two ways: 
• 
Encryption at rest 
• 
Encryption in transit 
9.4.1.1 ENCRYPTION AT REST 
Data at rest is the data that has been stored on a physical medium. This could be data stored on the disk of a 
server, data stored in a database, or data stored in a storage account. Regardless of the storage mechanism, 
encryption of data at rest ensures that the stored data is unreadable without the keys and secrets needed to 
decrypt it. If an attacker was to obtain a hard drive with encrypted data and did not have access to the 
encryption keys, the attacker would not compromise the data without great difficulty. 
 
 

82 
9.4.1.2 ENCRYPTION IN TRANSIT 
Data in transit is the data actively moving from one location to another, such as across the internet or through 
a private network. Secure transfer can be handled by several different layers. It could be done by encrypting 
the data at the application layer prior to sending it over a network. HTTPS is an example of application layer in 
transit encryption. 
You can also set up a secure channel, like a virtual private network (VPN), at a network layer, to transmit data 
between two systems. 
Encrypting data in transit protects the data from outside observers and provides a mechanism to transmit data 
while limiting risk of exposure. 
9.4.2 ENCRYPTION ON AZURE 
9.4.2.1 ENCRYPT RAW STORAGE 
Azure Storage Service Encryption (SSE) for data at rest helps you protect your data to meet your organizational 
security and compliance commitments. With this feature, the Azure storage platform automatically encrypts 
your data before persisting it to Azure Managed Disks, Azure Blob storage, Azure Files, or Azure Queue storage, 
and decrypts the data before retrieval. The handling of encryption, encryption at rest, decryption, and key 
management in Storage Service Encryption is transparent to applications using the services. 
9.4.2.2 ENCRYPT VIRTUAL MACHINE DISKS 
Azure Disk Encryption (ADE) is a capability that helps you encrypt your Windows and Linux IaaS virtual machine 
disks. Azure Disk Encryption leverages the industry-standard BitLocker feature of Windows and the dm-crypt 
feature of Linux to provide volume encryption for the OS and data disks. The solution is integrated with Azure 
Key Vault to help you control and manage the disk encryption keys and secrets (and you can use managed 
service identities for accessing Key Vault). 
9.4.2.3 ENCRYPT DATABASES 
Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) helps protect Azure SQL Database and Azure Data Warehouse against the 
threat of malicious activity. It performs real-time encryption and decryption of the database, associated 
backups, and transaction log files at rest without requiring changes to the application. By default, TDE is 
enabled for all newly deployed Azure SQL Database instances. 
TDE encrypts the storage of an entire database by using a symmetric key called the database encryption key. 
By default, Azure provides a unique encryption key per logical SQL Server instance and handles all the details. 
Bring your own key (BYOK) is also supported with keys stored in Azure Key Vault. 
9.4.2.4 ENCRYPT SECRETS 
We’ve seen that the encryption services all use keys to encrypt and decrypt data, so how do we ensure that the 
keys themselves are secure? Corporations may also have passwords, connection strings, or other sensitive 
pieces of information that they need to securely store. In Azure, we can use Azure Key Vault to protect our 
secrets. 

Azure Fundamentals 
83 
 
Azure Key Vault is a centralized cloud service for storing your application secrets. Key Vault helps you control 
your applications’ secrets by keeping them in a single, central location and by providing secure access, 
permissions control, and access logging capabilities. It is useful for a variety of scenarios: 
• 
Secrets management. You can use Key Vault to securely store and tightly control access to tokens, 
passwords, certificates, Application Programming Interface (API) keys, and other secrets. 
• 
Key management. You also can use Key Vault as a key management solution. Key Vault makes it easier 
to create and control the encryption keys used to encrypt your data. 
• 
Certificate management. Key Vault lets you provision, manage, and deploy your public and private Secure 
Sockets Layer/ Transport Layer Security (SSL/ TLS) certificates for your Azure, and internally connected, 
resources more easily. 
• 
Store secrets backed by hardware security modules (HSMs). The secrets and keys can be protected 
either by software, or by FIPS 140-2 Level 2 validated HSMs. 
The benefits of using Key Vault include: 
• 
Centralized application secrets. Centralizing storage for application secrets allows you to control their 
distribution, and reduces the chances that secrets may be accidentally leaked. 
• 
Securely stored secrets and keys. Azure uses industry-standard algorithms, key lengths, and HSMs, and 
access requires proper authentication and authorization. 
• 
Monitor access and use. Using Key Vault, you can monitor and control access to company secrets. 
• 
Simplified administration of application secrets. Key Vault makes it easier to enroll and renew certificates 
from public Certificate Authorities (CAs). You can also scale up and replicate content within regions, and 
use standard certificate management tools. 
• 
Integrate with other Azure services. You can integrate Key Vault with storage accounts, container 
registries, event hubs and many more Azure services.

PROTECT YOUR NETWORK 
Securing your network from attacks and unauthorized access is an important part of any architecture. Here, 
we’ll take a look at what network security looks like, how to integrate a layered approach into your architecture, 
and how Azure can help you provide network security for your environment. 
9.5.1 INTERNET PROTECTION 
If we start on the perimeter of the network, we’re focused on limiting and eliminating attacks from the internet. 
We suggest first assessing the resources that are internet-facing, and to only allow inbound and outbound 
communication where necessary. Make sure you identify all resources that are allowing inbound network 
traffic of any type, and then ensure they are restricted to only the ports and protocols required. Azure Security 
Center is a great place to look for this information, because it will identify internet-facing resources that don’t 
have network security groups associated with them, as well as resources that are not secured behind a 
firewall. 
9.5.2 WHAT IS FIREWALL? 
A firewall is a service that grants server access based on the originating IP address of each request. You create 
firewall rules that specify ranges of IP addresses. Only clients from these granted IP addresses will be allowed 
to access the server. Firewall rules, generally speaking, also include specific network protocol and port 
information. 
To provide inbound protection at the perimeter, you have several choices. 
• 
Azure Firewall is a managed, cloud-based, network security service that protects your Azure Virtual 
Network resources. It is a fully stateful firewall as a service with built-in high availability and unrestricted 
cloud scalability. Azure Firewall provides inbound protection for non-HTTP/S protocols. Examples of non-
HTTP/S protocols include: Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), Secure Shell (SSH), and File Transfer Protocol 
(FTP). It also provides outbound, network-level protection for all ports and protocols, and application-level 
protection for outbound HTTP/S. 
  
 
  
Azure Firewall 

Azure Fundamentals 
85 
 
• 
Azure Application Gateway is a load balancer that includes a Web Application Firewall (WAF) that provides 
protection from common, known vulnerabilities in websites. It is specifically designed to protect HTTP 
traffic. 
• 
Network virtual appliances (NVAs) are ideal options for non-HTTP services or advanced configurations, 
and are similar to hardware firewall appliances. 
9.5.2.1 AZURE FIREWALL 
You can deploy Azure Firewall on any virtual network, but customers typically deploy it on a central virtual 
network and peer other virtual networks to it in a hub-and-spoke model. You can then set the default route 
from the peered virtual networks to point to this central firewall virtual network. Global VNet peering is 
supported, but it isn’t recommended because of potential performance and latency issues across regions. For 
best performance, deploy one firewall per region. 
The advantage of this model is the ability to centrally exert control on multiple spoke VNETs across different 
subscriptions. There are also cost savings as you don’t need to deploy a firewall in each VNet separately. The 
cost savings should be measured versus the associate peering cost based on the customer traffic patterns. 
There are three types of rule collections available in Azure Firewall: 
• 
Network Address Translation (NAT) rules are used to forward traffic from the firewall to another device on 
the network 
• 
Network rules are rules that allow traffic on specific IP address ranges and ports that you specify 
• 
Application rules are used to allow applications such as Windows Update to communicate across you 
network. They can also be used to allow particular domain names such as azure.com and microsoft.com. 
When network traffic enters the firewall, NAT rules are applied first. If the traffic matches a NAT rule, Azure 
Firewall applies an implicit network rule so that the traffic can be routed appropriately, an all further rule 
processing stops. 
9.5.2.2 WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN APPLICATION GATEWAY WAF AND AZURE FIREWALL? 
The Web Application Firewall (WAF) is a feature of Application Gateway that provides centralized inbound 
protection of your web applications from common exploits and vulnerabilities. 
Azure Firewall provides inbound protection for non-HTTP/S protocols (for example, RDP, SSH, FTP), outbound 
network-level protection for all ports and protocols, and application-level protection for outbound HTTP/S. 
9.5.2.3 WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NSGS AND AZURE FIREWALL? 
The Azure Firewall service complements network security group functionality. Together, they provide better 
“defense-in-depth” network security: 
• 
Network security groups provide distributed network layer traffic filtering to limit traffic to resources 
within virtual networks in each subscription.  
• 
Azure Firewall is a fully stateful, centralized network firewall as-a-service, which provides network- and 
application-level protection across different subscriptions and virtual networks.

9.5.3 STOPPING DISTRIBUTED DENIAL OF SERVICE (DDOS) ATTACKS 
Any resource exposed on the internet is at risk of being attacked by a denial of service attack. These types of 
attacks attempt to overwhelm a network resource by sending so many requests that the resource becomes 
slow or unresponsive. 
 
Azure DDoS Protection 
When you combine Azure DDoS Protection with application design best practices, you help provide defense 
against DDoS attacks. DDoS Protection leverages the scale and elasticity of Microsoft’s global network to bring 
DDoS mitigation capacity to every Azure region. The Azure DDoS Protection service protects your Azure 
applications by scrubbing traffic at the Azure network edge before it can impact your service’s availability. 
Azure DDoS protection provides the following service tiers: 
 
Azure DDoS Protection 
DDoS Protection Standard can mitigate the following types of attacks: 
• 
Volumetric attacks: The attack’s goal is to flood the network layer with a substantial amount of seemingly 
legitimate traffic. It includes UDP floods, amplification floods, and other spoofed-packet floods. DDoS 
Protection Standard mitigates these potential multi-gigabyte attacks by absorbing and scrubbing them, 
with Azure’s global network scale, automatically. 
• 
Protocol attacks: These attacks render a target inaccessible, by exploiting a weakness in the layer 3 and 
layer 4 protocol stack. It includes, SYN flood attacks, reflection attacks, and other protocol attacks. DDoS 

Azure Fundamentals 
87 
 
Protection Standard mitigates these attacks, differentiating between malicious and legitimate traffic, by 
interacting with the client, and blocking malicious traffic. 
• 
Resource (application) layer attacks: These attacks target web application packets, to disrupt the 
transmission of data between hosts. The attacks include HTTP protocol violations, SQL injection, cross-
site scripting, and other layer 7 attacks. Use the Azure Application Gateway web application firewall, with 
DDoS Protection Standard, to provide defense against these attacks. 
There are also third-party web application firewall offerings available in the Azure Marketplace. DDoS 
Protection Standard protects resources in a virtual network including public IP addresses associated with 
virtual machines, load balancers, and application gateways. When coupled with the Application Gateway web 
application firewall, DDoS Protection Standard can provide full layer 3 to layer 7 mitigation capability. 
9.5.4 CONTROLLING THE TRAFFIC INSIDE YOUR VIRTUAL NETWORK 
9.5.4.1 VIRTUAL NETWORK SECURITY 
Once inside a virtual network (VNet), it’s crucial that you limit communication between resources to only what 
is required. For communication between virtual machines, Network Security Groups (NSGs) are a critical piece 
to restrict unnecessary communication. 
Network Security Groups allow you to filter network traffic to and from Azure resources in an Azure virtual 
network. An NSG can contain multiple inbound and outbound security rules that enable you to filter traffic to 
and from resources by source and destination IP address, port, and protocol. They provide a list of allowed and 
denied communication to and from network interfaces and subnets, and are fully customizable. 
You can completely remove public internet access to your services by restricting access to service endpoints. 
With service endpoints, Azure service access can be limited to your virtual network. 
9.5.4.2 NETWORK INTEGRATION 
Virtual private network (VPN) connections are a common way of establishing secure communication channels 
between networks. Connection between Azure Virtual Network and an on-premises VPN device is a great way 
to provide secure communication between your network and your VNet on Azure. 
To provide a dedicated, private connection between your network and Azure, you can use Azure ExpressRoute. 
ExpressRoute lets you extend your on-premises networks into the Microsoft cloud over a private connection 
facilitated by a connectivity provider. With ExpressRoute, you can establish connections to Microsoft cloud 
services, such as Microsoft Azure, Office 365, and Dynamics 365. This improves the security of your on-
premises communication by sending this traffic over the private circuit instead of over the public internet. You 
don’t need to allow access to these services for your end users over the public internet, and you can send this 
traffic through appliances for further traffic inspection. 
 
 

88 
9.6 
PROTECT YOUR SHARED DOCUMENTS 
Microsoft Azure Information Protection (MSIP or sometimes referred to as AIP) is a cloud-based solution that 
helps organizations classify and optionally protect documents and emails by applying labels. 
Labels can be applied automatically based on rules and conditions, manually, or a combination of both where 
users are guided by recommendations. 
 
Azure Information Protection 
After your content is classified, you can track and control how the content is used. For example, you can: 
• 
Analyze data flows to gain insight into your business 
• 
Detect risky behaviors and take corrective measures 
• 
Track access to documents 
• 
Prevent data leakage or misuse of confidential information 
The protection technology uses Azure Rights Management (often abbreviated to Azure RMS). This technology is 
integrated with other Microsoft cloud services and applications, such as Office 365 and Azure Active Directory. 
It can also be used with your own line-of-business applications and information protection solutions from 
software vendors, whether these applications and solutions are on-premises, or in the cloud. 
This protection technology uses encryption, identity, and authorization policies. Similarly to the labels that are 
applied, protection that is applied by using Rights Management stays with the documents and emails, 
independently of the location—inside or outside your organization, networks, file servers, and applications. This 
information protection solution keeps you in control of your data, even when it is shared with other people. 
9.7 
AZURE ADVANCED THREAD PROTECTION 
Azure Advanced Threat Protection (Azure ATP) is a cloud-based security solution that identifies, detects, and 
helps you investigate advanced threats, compromised identities, and malicious insider actions directed at your 
organization. 
Azure ATP is capable of detecting known malicious attacks and techniques, security issues, and risks against 
your network. It enables SecOp analysts and security professionals struggling to detect advanced attacks in 
hybrid environments to: 
• 
Monitor users, entity behavior, and activities with learning-based analytics 
• 
Protect user identities and credentials stored in Active Directory 
• 
Identify and investigate suspicious user activities and advanced attacks throughout the kill chain 
• 
Provide clear incident information on a simple timeline for fast triage

10 APPLY AND MONITOR INFRASTRUCTURE STANDARDS WITH AZURE POLICY 
Good IT governance involves planning your initiatives and setting priorities on a strategic level to help manage 
and prevent issues. 
You need good governance when: 
• 
You have multiple engineering teams working in Azure 
• 
You have multiple subscriptions in your tenant 
• 
You have regulatory requirements which must be enforced 
• 
You want to ensure standards are followed for all IT allocated resources 
You could enforce standards by not allowing teams to directly create Azure resources - and instead have the IT 
team define and deploy all cloud-based assets. This is often the solution in on-premises solutions, but this 
reduces the team agility and ability to innovate. Instead, Azure provides several tools you can use to enforce 
and validate your standards, while still allowing your engineering teams to create and own their own resources 
in the cloud. 
In addition to providing IT standards, you need to be able to monitor your resources to make sure they are 
responsive and performing properly. Azure provides several built-in features to track and analyze your resource 
utilization and performance. 
In this module, you will: 
• 
Apply policies to control and audit resource creation 
• 
Learn how role-based security can fine-tune access to your resources 
• 
Understand Microsoft’s policies and privacy guarantees 
• 
Learn how to monitor your resources 
10.1 DEFINE IT COMPLIANCE WITH AZURE POLICY 
Planning out a consistent cloud infrastructure starts with setting up policy. Your policies will enforce your rules 
for created resources, so your infrastructure stays compliant with your corporate standards, cost requirements, 
and service-level agreements (SLAs) you have with your customers. 
Azure Policy is a service in Azure that you use to define, assign, and, manage standards for resources in your 
environment. It can prevent the creation of disallowed resources, ensure new resources have specific settings 
applied, and run evaluations of your existing resources to scan for non-compliance. 
Azure Policy comes with many built-in policy and initiative definitions that you can use, under categories such 
as Storage, Networking, Compute, Security Center, and Monitoring. 
Imagine we allow anyone in our organization to create virtual machines (VMs). We want to control costs, so the 
administrator of our Azure tenant defines a policy that prohibits the creation of any VM with more than 4 CPUs. 
Once the policy is implemented, Azure Policy will stop anyone from creating a new VM outside the list of 
allowed stock keeping units (SKUs). Also, if you try to update an existing VM, it will be checked against policy. 
Finally, Azure Policy will audit all the existing VMs in our organization to ensure our policy is enforced. It can 
audit non-compliant resources, alter the resource properties, or stop the resource from being created. 
 
 

90 
10.1.1 CREATING A POLICY 
The process of creating and implementing an Azure Policy begins with creating a policy definition. Every policy 
definition has conditions under which it is enforced. And, it has an accompanying effect that takes place if the 
conditions are met. To apply a policy, you will: 
• 
Create a policy definition 
• 
Assign a definition to a scope of resources 
• 
View policy evaluation results 
10.1.1.1 CREATE A POLICY DEFINITION 
A policy definition expresses what to evaluate and what action to take. For example, you could ensure all public 
websites are secured with HTTPS, prevent a particular storage type from being created, or force a specific 
version of SQL Server to be used. 
The policy definition itself is represented as a JSON file - you can use one of the pre-defined definitions in the 
portal or create your own. 
Here is an example of a Compute policy that only allows specific virtual machine sizes: 
{ 
  "if": { 
    "allOf": [ 
      { 
        "field": "type", 
        "equals": "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines" 
      }, 
      { 
        "not": { 
          "field": "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/sku.name", 
          "in": "[parameters('listOfAllowedSKUs')]" 
        } 
      } 
    ] 
  }, 
  "then": { 
    "effect": "Deny" 
  } 
} 
Notice the [parameters(‘listofAllowedSKUs’)] value; this is a replacement token that will be filled in when the 
policy definition is applied to a scope. When a parameter is defined, it’s given a name and optionally given a 
value. 
 
 

Azure Fundamentals 
91 
 
10.1.1.2 ASSIGN A DEFINITION TO A SCOPE OF RESOURCES 
Once you’ve defined one or more policy definitions, you’ll need to assign them. A policy assignment is a policy 
definition that has been assigned to take place within a specific scope. 
This scope could range from a full subscription down to a resource group. Policy assignments are inherited by 
all child resources. This means that if a policy is applied to a resource group, it is applied to all the resources 
within that resource group. However, you can exclude a subscope from the policy assignment. For example, we 
could enforce a policy for an entire subscription and then exclude a few select resource groups. 
You can assign any of these policies through the Azure portal, PowerShell, or Azure CLI. When you assign a 
policy definition, you will need to supply any parameters which are defined. 
10.1.1.3 POLICY EFFECTS 
Requests to create or update a resource through Azure Resource Manager are evaluated by Azure Policy first. 
Policy creates a list of all assignments that apply to the resource and then evaluates the resource against each 
definition. Policy processes several of the effects before handing the request to the appropriate Resource 
Provider to avoid any unnecessary processing if the resource violates policy. 
Each policy definition in Azure Policy has a single effect. That effect determines what happens when the 
associated policy rule is matched. When that happens, Azure Policy will take a specific action based on the 
assigned effect. 
Policy Effect 
What happens? 
Deny 
The resource creation/update fails due to policy. 
Disabled 
The policy rule is ignored (disabled). Often used for testing. 
Append 
Adds additional parameters/fields to the requested resource during creation or update. A 
common example is adding tags on resources such as Cost Center or specifying allowed 
IPs for a storage resource. 
Audit, 
AuditIfNotExists 
Creates a warning event in the activity log when evaluating a non-compliant resource, but 
it doesn’t stop the request. 
DeployIfNotExists 
Executes a template deployment when a specific condition is met. For example, if SQL 
encryption is enabled on a database, then it can run a template after the DB is created to 
set it up a specific way. 
10.1.2 VIEW POLICY EVALUATION RESULTS 
Azure Policy can allow a resource to be created even if it doesn’t pass validation. In these cases, you can have 
it trigger an audit event which can be viewed in the Azure Policy portal, or through command-line tools. The 
easiest approach is in the portal as it provides a nice graphical overview which you can explore. You can find 
the Azure Policy section through the search field or All Services. 
 
 

92 
10.2 ORGANIZE POLICY WITH INITIATIVES 
Managing a few policy definitions is easy, but once you have more than a few, you will want to organize them. 
That’s where initiatives come in. 
Initiatives work alongside policies in Azure Policy. An initiative definition is a set or group of policy definitions to 
help track your compliance state for a larger goal. Even if you have a single policy, we recommend using 
initiatives if you anticipate increasing the number of policies over time. 
Like a policy assignment, an initiative assignment is an initiative definition assigned to a specific scope. 
Initiative assignments reduce the need to make several initiative definitions for each scope. This scope could 
also range from a management group to a resource group. 
Once defined, initiatives can be assigned just as policies can - and they apply all the associated policy 
definitions. 
10.2.1 DEFINING INITIATIVES 
Initiative definitions simplify the process of managing and assigning policy definitions by grouping a set of 
policies into a single item. For example, you could create an initiative named Enable Monitoring in Azure 
Security Center, with a goal to monitor all the available security recommendations in your Azure Security 
Center. 
You can define initiatives using the Azure portal, or command-line tools. In the portal, you use the “Authoring” 
section. 
10.2.2 ASSIGNING INITIATIVES 
Like a policy assignment, an initiative assignment is an initiative definition assigned to a specific scope. 
Initiative assignments reduce the need to make several initiative definitions for each scope. This scope could 
also range from a management group to a resource group. 
10.3 ENTERPRISE GOVERNANCE MANAGEMENT 
Access management occurs at the Azure subscription level. This allows an organization to configure each 
division of the company in a specific fashion based on their responsibilities and requirements. Planning and 
keeping rules consistent across subscriptions can be challenging without a little help. 
Azure Management Groups are containers for managing access, policies, and compliance across multiple 
Azure subscriptions. Management groups allow you to order your Azure resources hierarchically into 
collections, which provide a further level of classification that is above the level of subscriptions. All 
subscriptions within a management group automatically inherit the conditions applied to the management 
group. Management groups give you enterprise-grade management at a large scale no matter what type of 
subscriptions you might have. 

Azure Fundamentals 
93 
 
 
Create a hierarchy so you can apply a policy, for example, limit VM locations to US West Region on the group 
“Infrastructure Team management group”. This policy will inherit onto both EA subscriptions under that 
management group and will apply to all VMs under those subscriptions. This security policy cannot be altered 
by the resource or subscription owner allowing for improved governance. 
Another scenario where you would use management groups is to provide user access to multi subscriptions. By 
moving many subscriptions under that management group, you can create one role-based access control 
(RBAC) assignment on the management group, which will inherit that access to all the subscriptions. One 
assignment on the management group can enable users to have access to everything they need instead of 
scripting RBAC rules over different subscriptions. 
You can manage your Azure subscriptions more effectively by using Azure Policy and Azure role-based access 
controls (RBACs). These provide distinct governance conditions that you can apply to each management group. 
The resources and subscriptions you assign to a management group automatically inherit the conditions that 
you apply to that management group. 
10.4 DEFINE STANDARD RESOURCES WITH AZURE BLUEPRINTS 
Adhering to security or compliance requirements, whether government or industry requirements, can be 
difficult and time-consuming. To help you with auditing, traceability, and compliance with your deployments, 
use Azure Blueprint artifacts and tools. 
Azure Blueprint allows you to define a repeatable set of Azure resources that implement and adhere to your 
organization’s standards, patterns, and requirements. Blueprint enables development teams to rapidly build 
and deploy new environments with the knowledge that they’re building within organizational compliance with a 
set of built-in components that speed up development and delivery. 
Azure Blueprint is a declarative way to orchestrate the deployment of various resource templates and other 
artifacts, such as: 
• 
Role assignments 
• 
Policy assignments 
• 
Azure Resource Manager templates 
• 
Resource groups 

94 
With Azure Blueprint, the relationship between the blueprint definition (what should be deployed) and the 
blueprint assignment (what was deployed) is preserved. This connection supports improved deployment 
tracking and auditing. 
10.4.1 HOW IT’S DIFFERENT FROM RESOURCE MANAGER TEMPLATES 
Azure Blueprints are different from Azure Resource Manager Templates. When Azure Resource Manager 
Templates deploy r esources, they have no active relationship with the deployed resources (they exist in a local 
environment or source control). By contrast, with Azure Blueprint, each deployment is tied to an Azure Blueprint 
package. This means that the relationship with resources will be maintained, even after deployment. Managing 
relationships, in this way, improves auditing and tracking capabilities. 
 
The service is designed to help with environment setup. This setup often consists of a set of resource groups, 
policies, role assignments, and Resource Manager template deployments. A blueprint is a package to bring 
each of these artifact types together and allow you to compose and version that package – including through a 
CI/CD pipeline. Ultimately, each is assigned to a subscription in a single operation that can be audited and 
tracked. 
Nearly everything that you want to include for deployment in Blueprints can be accomplished with a Resource 
Manager template. However, a Resource Manager template is a document that doesn’t exist natively in Azure 
– each is stored either locally or in source control. The template gets used for deployments of one or more 
Azure resources, but once those resources deploy there’s no active connection or relationship to the template. 
With Blueprints, the relationship between the blueprint definition (what should be deployed) and the blueprint 
assignment (what was deployed) is preserved. This connection supports improved tracking and auditing of 
deployments. Blueprints can also upgrade several subscriptions at once that are governed by the same 
blueprint. 
There’s no need to choose between a Resource Manager template and a blueprint. Each blueprint can consist 
of zero or more Resource Manager template artifacts. This support means that previous efforts to develop and 
maintain a library of Resource Manager templates are reusable in Blueprints. 
 
 

Azure Fundamentals 
95 
 
10.4.2 BLUEPRINT DEFINITION 
A blueprint is made up of artifacts. Blueprints currently support the following resources as artifacts: 
Resource 
Hierarchy 
options 
Description 
Resource 
Groups 
Subscription 
Create a new resource group for use by other artifacts within the 
blueprint. These placeholder resource groups enable you to organize 
resources exactly the way you want them structured and provides a 
scope limiter for included policy and role assignment artifacts and Azure 
Resource Manager templates. 
Azure Resource 
Manager

Subscription, 
Resource Group 
Templates are used to compose complex environments. Example 
environments: a SharePoint farm, Azure Automation State Configuration, 
or a Log Analytics workspace. 
Policy 
Assignment 
Subscription, 
Resource Group 
Allows assignment of a policy or initiative to the subscription the 
blueprint is assigned to. The policy or initiative must be within the scope 
of the blueprint definition location. If the policy or initiative has 
parameters, these parameters are assigned at creation of the blueprint 
or during blueprint assignment. 
Role 
Assignment 
Subscription, 
Resource Group 
Add an existing user or group to a built-in role to make sure the right 
people always have the right access to your resources. Role assignments 
can be defined for the entire subscription or nested to a specific 
resource group included in the blueprint. 
10.5 EXPLORE YOUR SERVICE COMPLIANCE WITH COMPLIANCE MANAGER 
Governing your own resources and how they are used is only part of the solution when using a cloud provider. 
You also have to understand how the provider manages the underlying resources you are building on. 
Microsoft takes this management very seriously and provides full transparency with four sources: 
• 
Microsoft Privacy Statement 
• 
Microsoft Trust Center 
• 
Service Trust Portal 
• 
Compliance Manager 
10.5.1 MICROSOFT PRIVACY STATEMENT 
The Microsoft privacy statement explains what personal data Microsoft processes, how Microsoft processes it, 
and for what purposes. 
The statement applies to the interactions Microsoft has with you and Microsoft products such as Microsoft 
services, websites, apps, software, servers, and devices. It is intended to provide openness and honesty about 
how Microsoft deals with personal data in its products and services. 
10.5.2 MICROSOFT TRUST CENTER 
Trust Center is a website resource containing information and details about how Microsoft implements and 
supports security, privacy, compliance, and transparency in all Microsoft cloud products and services. The 
Trust Center is an important part of the Microsoft Trusted Cloud Initiative, and provides support and resources 
for the legal and compliance community. 

96 
10.5.3 SERVICE TRUST PORTAL 
The Service Trust Portal (STP) hosts the Compliance Manager service, and is the Microsoft public site for 
publishing audit reports and other compliance-related information relevant to Microsoft’s cloud services. 
STP also includes information about how Microsoft online services can help your organization maintain and 
track compliance with standards, laws, and regulations, such as ISO, GDPR or NIST. 
The STP is a launching point for the following resources: 
• 
Compliance Manager - a tool for managing your regulatory compliance in the cloud. 
• 
Audit reports - comprehensive reports and resources that allow you to see details on how Microsoft 
maintains compliance. 
• 
Data Protection Information - Full details on how Microsoft designs its cloud offerings to ensure that 
customer data is protected. 
• 
Privacy - Information related to how Microsoft helps you maintain compliance with GDPR. 
10.5.4 COMPLIANCE MANAGER 
Compliance Manager is a workflow-based risk assessment dashboard within the Trust Portal that enables you 
to track, assign, and verify your organization’s regulatory compliance activities related to Microsoft professional 
services and Microsoft cloud services such as Office 365, Dynamics 365, and Azure. 
Compliance Manager provides the following features: 
• 
Combines the following three items: 
• 
Detailed information provided by Microsoft to auditors and regulators, as part of various third-
party audits of Microsoft ’s cloud services against various standards (for example, ISO 27001, 
ISO 27018, and NIST). 
• 
Information that Microsoft compiles internally for its compliance with regulations (such as HIPAA 
and the EU GDPR). 
• 
An organization’s self-assessment of their own compliance with these standards and 
regulations. 
• 
Enables you to assign, track, and record compliance and assessment-related activities, which can help 
your organization cross team barriers to achieve your organization’s compliance goals. 
• 
Provides a Compliance Score to help you track your progress and prioritize auditing controls that will help 
reduce your organization’s exposure to risk. 
• 
Provides a secure repository in which to upload and manage evidence and other artifacts related to 
compliance activities. 
• 
Produces richly detailed reports in Microsoft Excel that document the compliance activities performed by 
Microsoft and your organization, which can be provided to auditors, regulators, and other compliance 
stakeholders. 
Compliance Manager is a dashboard that provides a summary of your data protection and compliance stature and 
recommendations for improvement. The Customer Actions provided in Compliance Manager are 
recommendations only; it is up to each organization to evaluate the effectiveness of these recommendations in 
their respective regulatory environment prior to implementation. Recommendations found in Compliance 
Manager should not be interpreted as a guarantee of compliance.

10.6 MONITOR YOUR SERVICE HEALTH 
Defining policy and access provides fine-grained control over resources in your cloud IT infrastructure. Once 
those resources are deployed, you will want to know about any issues or performance problems they might 
encounter. 
Azure provides two primary services to monitor the health of your apps and resources. 
• 
Azure Monitor 
• 
Azure Service Health 
10.6.1 AZURE MONITOR 
Azure Monitor maximizes the availability and performance of your applications by delivering a comprehensive 
solution for collecting, analyzing, and acting on telemetry from your cloud and on-premises environments. It 
helps you understand how your applications are performing and proactively identifies issues affecting them 
and the resources they depend on. 
 
Azure Monitor 
10.6.1.1 DATA SOURCES 
Azure Monitor can collect data from a variety of sources. You can think of monitoring data for your applications 
in tiers ranging from your application, any operating system and services it relies on, down to the platform 
itself. Azure Monitor collects data from each of the following tiers: 
• 
Application monitoring data: Data about the performance and functionality of the code you have written, 
regardless of its platform. 
• 
Guest OS monitoring data: Data about the operating system on which your application is running. This 
could be running in Azure, another cloud, or on-premises. 
• 
Azure resource monitoring data: Data about the operation of an Azure resource. 
• 
Azure subscription monitoring data: Data about the operation and management of an Azure subscription, 
as well as data about the health and operation of Azure itself.  
• 
Azure tenant monitoring data: Data about the operation of tenant-level Azure services, such as Azure 
Active Directory. 

98 
All data collected by Azure Monitor fits into one of two fundamental types, metrics and logs: 
• 
Metrics are numerical values that describe some aspect of a system at a particular point in time. They 
are lightweight and capable of supporting near real-time scenarios.  
• 
Logs contain different kinds of data organized into records with different sets of properties for each 
type. Telemetry such as events and traces are stored as logs in addition to performance data so that it 
can all be combined for analysis. 
As soon as you create an Azure subscription and start adding resources such as virtual machines and web 
apps, Azure Monitor starts collecting data. Activity Logs record when resources are created or modified and 
Metrics tell you how the resource is performing and the resources that it’s consuming. 
10.6.1.2 INSIGHTS 
Data monitoring is only useful if it improves your visibility of the operations in your computing environment. 
Azure Monitor includes several features and tools that provide valuable insights into your applications, and the 
other resources they may depend on. 
Application Insights is a service that monitors the availability, performance, and usage of your web 
applications, whether they’re hosted in the cloud or on-premises. It leverages the powerful data analysis 
platform in Log Analytics to provide you with deeper insights into your application’s operations. Application 
Insights can diagnose errors, without waiting for a user to report them. Application Insights includes connection 
points to a variety of development tools, and integrates with Microsoft Visual Studio to support your DevOps 
processes. 
Azure Monitor for containers is a service that is designed to monitor the performance of container workloads, 
which are deployed to managed Kubernetes clusters hosted on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). It gives you 
performance visibility by collecting memory and processor metrics from controllers, nodes, and containers, 
which are available in Kubernetes through the metrics API. Container logs are also collected. 
Azure Monitor for VMs is a service that monitors your Azure VMs at scale, by analyzing the performance and 
health of your Windows and Linux VMs (including their different processes and interconnected dependencies 
on other resources, and external processes). Azure Monitor for VMs includes support for monitoring 
performance and application dependencies for VMs hosted on-premises, and for VMs hosted with other cloud 
providers. 
Integrating any, or all, of these monitoring services with Azure Service Health has additional benefits. Staying 
informed of the health status of Azure services will help you understand if, and when, an issue affecting an 
Azure service is impacting your environment. What may seem like a localized problem could be the result of a 
more widespread issue, and Azure Service Health provides this kind of insight. Azure Service Health identifies 
any issues with Azure services that might affect your application. Azure Service Health also helps you to plan 
for scheduled maintenance. 
10.6.1.3 RESPONDING TO ALERT CONDITIONS 
In addition to allowing you to analyze your monitoring data interactively, an effective monitoring solution must 
respond proactively to any critical conditions that are identified within the data it collects. This might involve, 
for example, sending a text or email to an administrator who is responsible for investigating an issue, or 
launching an automated process that attempts to correct an error condition. 

Azure Fundamentals 
99 
 
Alerts. Azure Monitor proactively notifies you of critical conditions using alerts, and can potentially attempt to 
take corrective actions. Alert rules based on metrics can provide alerts in almost real-time, based on numeric 
values. Alert rules based on logs allow for complex logic across data, from multiple sources. 
Autoscale. Azure Monitor uses Autoscale to ensure that you have the right amount of resources running to 
manage the load on your application effectively. Autoscale enables you to create rules that use metrics, 
collected by Azure Monitor, to determine when to automatically add resources to handle increases in load. 
Autoscale can also help reduce your Azure costs by removing resources that are not being used. You can 
specify a minimum and maximum number of instances, and provide the logic that determines when Autoscale 
should increase or decrease resources. 
10.6.2 AZURE SERVICE HEALTH 
Azure Service Health is a suite of experiences that provide personalized guidance and support when issues 
with Azure services affect you. It can notify you, help you understand the impact of issues, and keep you 
updated as the issue is resolved. Azure Service Health can also help you prepare for planned maintenance and 
changes that could affect the availability of your resources. 
Azure Service Health is composed of the following views: 
• 
Azure Status provides a global view of the health state of Azure services. With Azure Status, you can get 
up-to-the-minute information on service availability. Everyone has access to Azure Status and can view all 
services that report their health state. 
• 
Service Health provides you with a customizable dashboard that tracks the state of your Azure services in 
the regions where you use them. In this dashboard, you can track active events such as ongoing service 
issues, upcoming planned maintenance, or relevant Health advisories. When events become inactive, 
they are placed in your Health history for up to 90 days. Finally, you can use the Service Health 
dashboard to create and manage service Health alerts, which notify you whenever there are service 
issues that affect you. 
• 
Resource Health helps you diagnose and obtain support when an Azure service issue affects your 
resources. It provides you details with about the current and past state of your resources. It also provides 
technical support to help you mitigate problems. In contrast to Azure Status, which informs you about 
service problems that affect a broad set of Azure customers, Resource Health gives you a personalized 
dashboard of your resources’ health. Resource Health shows you times, in the past, when your resources 
were unavailable because of Azure service problems. It’s then easier for you to understand if an SLA was 
violated. 
Together, the Azure Service Health components provide you with a comprehensive view of the health status of 
Azure, at the level of granularity that is most relevant to you.

11 CONTROL AND ORGANIZE AZURE RESOURCES WITH AZURE RESOURCE MANAGER 
Azure Resource Manager has a number of features that you can use to organize resources, enforce standards, 
and protect critical Azure resources from accidental deletion. 
In this module, you will: 
• 
Use resource groups to organize Azure resources 
• 
Use tags to organize resources 
• 
Apply policies to enforce standards in your Azure environments 
• 
Use resource locks to protect critical Azure resources from accidental deletion 
 
Azure Resource Manager 
11.1 PRINCIPLES OF RESOURCE GROUPS 
11.1.1 WHAT ARE RESOURCE GROUPS? 
Resource groups are a fundamental element of the Azure platform. A resource group is a logical container for 
resources deployed on Azure. These resources are anything you create in an Azure subscription like virtual 
machines, Application Gateways, and CosmosDB instances. All resources must be in a resource group and a 
resource can only be a member of a single resource group. Resources can be moved between resource groups 
at any time. Resource groups can’t be nested. Before any resource can be provisioned, you need a resource 
group for it to be placed in. 
11.1.1.1 LOGICAL GROUPING 
Resource groups exist to help manage and organize your Azure resources. By placing resources of similar 
usage, type, or location, you can provide some order and organization to resources you create in Azure. Logical 
grouping is the aspect that we’re most interested in here, since there’s a lot of disorder among our resources. 
 
Resource group 

Azure Fundamentals 
101 
 
11.1.1.2 LIFE CYCLE 
If you delete a resource group, all resources contained within are also deleted. Organizing resources by life 
cycle can be useful in non-production environments, where you might try an experiment, but then dispose of it 
when done. Resource groups make it easy to remove a set of resources at once. 
11.1.1.3 AUTHORIZATION 
Resource groups are also a scope for applying role-based access control (RBAC) permissions. By applying 
RBAC permissions to a resource group, you can ease administration and limit access to allow only what is 
needed. 
11.1.2 CREATE A RESOURCE GROUP 
Resource groups can be created by using the following methods: 
• 
Azure portal 
• 
Azure PowerShell 
• 
Azure CLI 
• 
Templates 
• 
Azure SDKs (like .NET, Java) 
11.1.3 USE RESOURCE GROUPS FOR ORGANIZATION 
So how can you use resource groups to your advantage in your new organization? There are some guidelines 
and best practices that can help with the organization. 
11.1.3.1 CONSISTENT NAMING CONVENTION 
You can start with using an understandable naming convention. We named our resource group msftlearn-core-
infrastructure-rg. We’ve given some indication of what it’s used for (msftlearn), the types of resources 
contained within (core-infrastructure), and the type of resource it is itself (rg). 
11.1.4 ORGANIZING PRINCIPLES 
Resource groups can be organized in a number of ways, let’s take a look at a few examples. We might put all 
resources that are core infrastructure into this resource group. But we could also organize them strictly by 
resource type. For example, put all VNets in one resource group, all virtual machines in another resource 
group, and all Azure Cosmos DB instances in yet another resource group. 
 
We could organize them by environment (prod, qa, dev). In this case, all production resources are in one 
resource group, all test resources are in another resource group, and so on. 

102 
 
We could organize them by department (marketing, finance, human resources). Marketing resources go in one 
resource group, finance in another resource group, and HR in a third resource group. 
 
We could even use a combination of these strategies and organize by environment and department. Put 
production finance resources in one resource group, dev finance resources in another, and the same for the 
marketing resources. 
 
There are a few factors that can play into the strategy you use to organize resources: authorization, resource 
life cycle, and billing. 
11.1.4.1 ORGANIZING FOR AUTHORIZATION 
Since resource groups are a scope of RBAC, you can organize resources by who needs to administer them. If 
your database administration team is responsible for managing all of your Azure SQL Database instances, 
putting them in the same resource group would simplify administration. You could give them the proper 
permissions at the resource group level to administer the databases within the resource group. Similarly, the 
database administration team could be denied access to the resource group with virtual networks, so they 
don’t inadvertently make changes to resources outside the scope of their responsibility. 
11.1.4.2 ORGANIZING FOR LIFE CYCLE 
We mentioned earlier that resource groups serve as the life cycle for the resources within it. If you delete a 
resource group, you delete all the resources in it. Use this to your advantage, especially in areas where 
resources are more disposable, like non-production environments. If you deploy 10 servers for a project that 
you know will only last a couple of months, you might put them all in a single resource group. One resource 
group is easier to clean up than 10 or more resource groups. 
11.1.4.3 ORGANIZING FOR BILLING 
Lastly, placing resources in the same resource group is a way to group them for usage in billing reports. If 
you’re trying to understand how your costs are distributed in your Azure environment, grouping them by 
resource group is one way to filter and sort the data to better understand where costs are allocated. 

Azure Fundamentals 
103 
 
11.2 USE TAGGING TO ORGANIZE RESOURCES 
You’ve gone through your resources and moved them into resource groups that are more organized than 
before. But what if resources have multiple uses? How do you better search, filter, and organize these 
resources? Tags can be helpful as you look to improve organization of your Azure resources. 
11.2.1 WHAT ARE TAGS? 
Tags are name/value pairs of text data that you can apply to resources and resource groups. Tags allow you to 
associate custom details about your resource, in addition to the standard Azure properties a resource has: 
• 
department (like finance, marketing, and more) 
• 
environment (prod, test, dev), 
• 
cost center 
• 
life cycle and automation (like shutdown and startup of virtual machines). 
Tags can be added and manipulated through the Azure portal, Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, Resource Manager 
templates, and through the REST API. For example, to add a resource tag to a virtual network using the Azure 
CLI, you could use the following command: 
az resource tag --tags Department=Finance \ 
       --resource-group msftlearn-core-infrastructure-rg \ 
       --name msftlearn-vnet1 \ 
       --resource-type "Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks"  
You can use Azure Policy to automatically add or enforce tags for resources your organization creates based on 
policy conditions that you define. For example, you could require that a value for the Department tag is entered 
when someone in your organization creates a virtual network in a specific resource group. 
11.2.2 USE TAGS FOR ORGANIZATION 
The above example is just one example of where you can use tags to organize your resources. With their 
flexibility, there are several ways you can use tags to your advantage. 
You can use tags to group your billing data. For example, if you’re running multiple VMs for different 
organizations, use the tags to group usage by cost center. You can also use tags to categorize costs by runtime 
environment, such as the billing usage for VMs running in the production environment. When exporting billing 
data or accessing it through billing APIs, tags are included in that data and can be used to further slice your 
data from a cost perspective. 
You can retrieve all the resources in your subscription with a specific tag name or value. Tags enable you to 
retrieve related resources from different resource groups. This approach is helpful when you need to organize 
resources for billing or management. 
Tagging resources can also help in monitoring to track down impacted resources. Monitoring systems could 
include tag data with alerts, giving you the ability to know exactly who is impacted. In our example above, we 
applied the Department:Finance tag to the msftlearn-vnet1 resource. If an alarm was thrown on msftlearn-
vnet1 and the alarm included the tag, we’d know that the finance department may be impacted by the 
condition that triggered the alarm. This contextual information can be valuable if an issue occurs. 

104 
It’s also common for tags to be used in automation. If you want to automate the shutdown and startup of 
virtual machines in development environments during off-hours to save costs, you can use tags to assist in 
this. Add a shutdown:6PM and startup:7AM tag to the virtual machines, then create an automation job that 
looks for these tags, and shuts them down or starts them up based on the tag value. There are several 
solutions in the Azure Automation Runbooks Gallery that use tags in a similar manner to accomplish this. 
11.3 USE POLICIES TO ENFORCE STANDARDS 
You’re organizing your resources better in resource groups, and you’ve applied tags to your resources to use 
them in billing reports and in your monitoring solution. Resource grouping and tagging have made a difference 
in the existing resources, but how do you ensure that new resources follow the rules? Let’s take a look at how 
policies can help you enforce standards in your Azure environment. 
11.3.1 WHAT IS AZURE POLICY? 
Governance validates that your organization can achieve its goals through effective and efficient use of IT. It 
meets this need by creating clarity between business goals and IT projects. 
Does your company experience a significant number of IT issues that never seem to get resolved? Good IT 
governance involves planning your initiatives and setting priorities on a strategic level to help manage and 
prevent issues. This strategic need is where Azure Policy comes in. 
Azure Policy is a service you can use to create, assign, and manage policies. These policies apply and enforce 
rules that your resources need to follow. These policies can enforce these rules when resources are created, 
and can be evaluated against existing resources to give visibility into compliance. 
Policies can enforce things such as only allowing specific types of resources to be created, or only allowing 
resources in specific Azure regions. You can enforce naming conventions across your Azure environment. You 
can also enforce that specific tags are applied to resources. Let’s take a look at how policies work. 
11.3.2 POLICIES TO ENFORCE STANDARDS 
We’ve seen how we could use policies to ensure that our resources have the tags that organize our resources. 
There are other ways policies can be used to our benefit. 
We could use policy to restrict which Azure regions we can deploy resources to. For organizations that are 
heavily regulated or have legal or regulatory restrictions on where data can reside, policies help to ensure that 
resources aren’t provisioned in geographic areas that would go against these requirements. 
We could use policy to restrict which types of virtual machine sizes can be deployed. You may want to allow 
large VM sizes in your production subscriptions, but maybe you’d like to ensure that you keep costs minimized 
in your dev subscriptions. By denying the large VM sizes through policy in your dev subscriptions, you can 
ensure they don’t get deployed in these environments. 
We could also use policy to enforce naming conventions. If our organization has standardized on specific 
naming conventions, using policy to enforce the conventions helps us to keep a consistent naming standard 
across our Azure resources. 
 
 

Azure Fundamentals 
105 
 
11.4 SECURE RESOURCES WITH ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL 
Implementing Azure Policy ensured that all our employees with Azure access are following our internal 
standards for creating resources, but we have a second issue we need to solve: how do we protect those 
resources once they are deployed? We have IT personnel that need to manage settings, developers that need 
to have read-only access, and administrators that need to be able to control them completely. Enter Role-
Based Access Control (RBAC). 
RBAC provides fine-grained access management for Azure resources, enabling you to grant users the specific 
rights they need to perform their jobs. RBAC is considered a core service and is included with all subscription 
levels at no cost. 
Using RBAC, you can: 
• 
Allow one user to manage VMs in a subscription, and another user to manage virtual networks. 
• 
Allow a database administrator (DBA) group to manage SQL databases in a subscription. 
• 
Allow a user to manage all resources in a resource group, such as VMs, websites, and virtual subnets. 
• 
Allow an application to access all resources in a resource group. 
RBAC uses an allow model for access. When you are assigned to a role, RBAC allows you to perform specific 
actions, such as read, write, or delete. Therefore, if one role assignment grants you read permissions to a 
resource group, and a different role assignment grants you write permissions to the same resource group, you 
will have write permissions on that resource group. 
11.4.1 HOW RBAC WORKS 
The way you control access to resources using RBAC is to create role assignments. This is a key concept to 
understand – it’s how permissions are enforced. A role assignment consists of three elements: security 
principal, role definition, and scope. 
11.4.1.1 SECURITY PRINCIPAL 
A security principal is an object that represents a user, group, service principal, or managed identity that is 
requesting access to Azure resources. 
 
Security principal 
• 
User - An individual who has a profile in Azure Active Directory. You can also assign roles to users in other 
tenants. For information about users in other organizations, see Azure Active Directory B2B. 
• 
Group - A set of users created in Azure Active Directory. When you assign a role to a group, all users 
within that group have that role. 
• 
Service principal - A security identity used by applications or services to access specific Azure resources. 
You can think of it as a user identity (username and password - or certificate) for an application. 
• 
Managed identity - An identity in Azure Active Directory that is automatically managed by Azure. You 
typically use managed identities when developing cloud applications to manage the credentials for 
authenticating to Azure services. 

106 
11.4.1.2 ROLE DEFINITION 
A role definition is a collection of permissions. It’s sometimes just called a role. A role definition lists the 
operations that can be performed, such as read, write, and delete. Roles can be high-level, like owner, or 
specific, like virtual machine reader. 
 
Role definition 
11.4.1.3 SCOPE 
Scope is the set of resources that the access applies to. When you assign a role, you can further limit the 
actions allowed by defining a scope. This is helpful if you want to make someone a Website Contributor, but 
only for one resource group. 
In Azure, you can specify a scope at multiple levels: management group, subscription, resource group, or 
resource. Scopes are structured in a parent-child relationship. 
 
RBAC Scope 
When you grant access at a parent scope, those permissions are inherited to the child scopes. For example: 
• 
If you assign the Owner role to a user at the management group scope, that user can manage everything 
in all subscriptions in the management group. 
• 
If you assign the Reader role to a group at the subscription scope, the members of that group can view 
every resource group and resource in the subscription. 
• 
If you assign the Contributor role to an application at the resource group scope, it can manage resources 
of all types in that resource group, but not other resource groups in the subscription. 

Azure Fundamentals 
107 
 
11.4.1.4 ROLE ASSIGNMENTS 
A role assignment is the process of attaching a role definition to a user, group, service principal, or managed 
identity at a particular scope for the purpose of granting access. Access is granted by creating a role 
assignment, and access is revoked by removing a role assignment. 
The following diagram shows an example of a role assignment. In this example, the Marketing group has been 
assigned the Contributor role for the pharma-sales resource group. This means that users in the Marketing 
group can create or manage any Azure resource in the pharma-sales resource group. Marketing users do not 
have access to resources outside the pharma-sales resource group, unless they are part of another role 
assignment. 
 
Role assignment 
11.4.2 BEST PRACTICES FOR RBAC 
Here are some best practices you should use when setting up resources. 
• 
Segregate duties within your team and grant only the amount of access to users that they need to 
perform their jobs. Instead of giving everybody unrestricted permissions in your Azure subscription or 
resources, allow only specific actions at a particular scope. 
• 
When planning your access control strategy, grant users the lowest privilege level that they need to do 
their work. 
• 
Use Resource Locks to ensure critical resources aren’t modified or deleted (more on that next!) 
Azure includes several built-in roles that you can use. The following lists four fundamental built-in roles. The 
first three apply to all resource types. 
• 
Owner - Has full access to all resources including the right to delegate access to others. 
• 
Contributor - Can create and manage all types of Azure resources but can’t grant access to others. 
• 
Reader - Can view existing Azure resources. 
• 
User Access Administrator - Lets you manage user access to Azure resources. 

108 
The rest of the built-in roles allow management of specific Azure resources. For example, the Virtual Machine 
Contributor role allows a user to create and manage virtual machines. If the built-in roles don’t meet the 
specific needs of your organization, you can create your own custom roles for Azure resources. 
Azure has data operations that enable you to grant access to data within an object. For example, if a user has 
read data access to a storage account, then they can read the blobs or messages within that storage account. 
For more information, see Understand role definitions for Azure resources. 
11.5 USE RESOURCE LOCKS TO PROTECT RESOURCES 
Resource locks are a setting that can be applied to any resource to block modification or deletion. Resource 
locks can set to either Delete or Read-only: 
• 
Delete will allow all operations against the resource but block the ability to delete it. 
• 
Read-only will only allow read activities to be performed against it, blocking any modification or deletion 
of the resource. 
Resource locks can be applied to subscriptions, resource groups, and to individual resources, and are inherited 
when applied at higher levels. 
When you apply a lock at a parent scope, all resources within that scope inherit the same lock. Even resources 
you add later inherit the lock from the parent. The most restrictive lock in the inheritance takes precedence. 
Unlike role-based access control, you use management locks to apply a restriction across all users and roles. 
In order to create a lock, you must either be in the ‘Owner’ or ‘User Access Administrator’ role in RBAC. 
Alternatively, an administrator can create a custom role that grants the right to create a lock. 
Applying ReadOnly can lead to unexpected results because some operations that don’t seem to modify the 
resource actually require actions that are blocked by the lock. The ReadOnly lock can be applied to the 
resource or to the resource group containing the resource. Some common examples of the operations that are 
blocked by a ReadOnly lock are: 
• 
A ReadOnly lock on a storage account prevents all users from listing the keys. The list keys operation is 
handled through a POST request because the returned keys are available for write operations. 
• 
A ReadOnly lock on an App Service resource prevents Visual Studio Server Explorer from displaying files 
for the resource because that interaction requires write access. 
• 
A ReadOnly lock on a resource group that contains a virtual machine prevents all users from starting or 
restarting the virtual machine. These operations require a POST request.

12 PREDICT COST AND OPTIMIZE SPENDING FOR AZURE 
When planning a solution in the cloud, there’s always the challenge of balancing cost against performance. It 
can feel like a guessing game whether your selected options will stay within budget or if you’ll have a surprise 
on your next bill. 
You need to be able to confidently answer several questions: 
• 
What will this solution cost this fiscal year? 
• 
Is there an alternate configuration you could use to save money? 
• 
Can you estimate how a change would impact your cost and performance without putting it into a 
production system? 
In this module, we’ll explore the tools you can use to answer these questions and more. In this module, you 
will: 
• 
Learn the different options you have to purchase Azure services 
• 
Estimate costs with the Azure pricing calculator 
• 
Predict and optimize costs with Azure Cost Management and Azure Advisor 
• 
Apply best practices for saving on infrastructure costs 
• 
Apply best practices for saving on licensing costs 
12.1 PURCHASING AZURE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES 
Let’s start by examining the purchasing options you have with Azure. There are three main customer types on 
which the available purchasing options for Azure products and services are contingent, including: 
• 
Enterprise - Enterprise customers sign an Enterprise Agreement with Azure that commits them to spend a 
negotiated amount on Azure services, which they typically pay annually. Enterprise customers also have 
access to customized Azure pricing. 
• 
Web direct - Direct Web customers pay general public prices for Azure resources, and their monthly billing 
and payments occur through the Azure website. 
• 
Cloud Solution Provider - Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) typically are Microsoft partner companies that a 
customer hires to build solutions on top of Azure. Payment and billing for Azure usage occur through the 
customer’s CSP. 
When you provision an Azure resource, Azure creates one or more meter instances for that resource. The 
meters track the resources’ usage, and generate a usage record that is used to calculate your bill. 
For example, a single virtual machine that you provision in Azure might have the following meters tracking its 
usage: 
• 
Compute Hours 
• 
IP Address Hours 
• 
Data Transfer In 
• 
Data Transfer Out 
• 
Standard Managed Disk 
• 
Standard Managed Disk Operations 
• 
Standard IO-Disk 
• 
Standard IO-Block Blob Read 
• 
Standard IO-Block Blob Write 
• 
Standard IO-Block Blob Delete 

110 
The meters and pricing vary per product and often have different pricing tiers based on the size or capacity of 
the resource. At the end of each monthly billing cycle, the usage values will be charged to your payment 
method and the meters are reset. 
The key takeaway is that resources are always charged based on usage. For example, if you de-allocate a VM 
then you will not be billed for compute hours, I/O reads or writes or the private IP address since the VM is not 
running and has no allocated compute resources. However you will incur storage costs for the disks. 
12.2 FACTORS AFFECTING COSTS 
Just like your on-premises equipment costs, there are several elements that will affect your monthly costs 
when using Azure services. Let’s look at a few of the primary factors including resource type, services, the 
user’s location, and the billing zone. 
12.2.1 RESOURCE TYPE 
Costs are resource-specific, so the usage that a meter tracks and the number of meters associated with a 
resource depend on the resource type. 
Each meter tracks a particular kind of usage. For example, a meter might track bandwidth usage (ingress or 
egress network traffic in bits-per-second), the number of operations, size (storage capacity in bytes), or similar 
items. 
The usage that a meter tracks correlates to a number of billable units. Those are charged to your account for 
each billing period, and the rate per billable unit depends on the resource type you are using. 
12.2.2 SERVICES 
Azure usage rates and billing periods can differ between Enterprise, Web Direct, and Cloud Solution Provider 
(CSP) customers. Some subscription types also include usage allowances, which affect costs. 
The Azure team develops and offers first-party products and services, while products and services from third-
party vendors are available in the Azure Marketplace. Different billing structures apply to each of these 
categories. 
12.2.3 LOCATION 
Azure has datacenters all over the world. Usage costs vary between locations that offer particular Azure 
products, services, and resources based on popularity, demand, and local infrastructure costs. 
12.2.4 AZURE BILLING ZONES 
Bandwidth refers to data moving in and out of Azure datacenters. Most of the time inbound data transfers 
(data going into Azure datacenters) are free. For outbound data transfers (data going out of Azure datacenters), 
the data transfer pricing is based on Billing Zones. 
A Zone is a geographical grouping of Azure Regions for billing purposes. The following zones exist and include 
the listed countries (regions) listed. 
 
 

Azure Fundamentals 
111 
 
Zone 
Areas 
Zone 1 
United States, Europe, Canada, UK, 
France 
Zone 2 
Asia Pacific, Japan, Australia, India, Korea 
Zone 3 
Brazil 
DE Zone 1 
Germany 
The cheapest outbound networking costs are in zone 1, followed by DE Zone 1, Zone 2 and Zone 3. 
Note: Billing zones aren’t the same as an Availability Zone. In Azure, the term zone is for billing purposes only, 
and the full term Availability Zone refers to the failure protection that Azure provides for datacenters. 
12.3 ESTIMATE COSTS WITH THE AZURE PRICING CALCULATOR 
To make estimates easy for customers to create, Microsoft developed the Azure pricing calculator. The Azure 
pricing calculator is a free web-based tool that allows you to input Azure services and modify properties and 
options of the services. It outputs the costs per service and total cost for the full estimate. 
 
Pricing calculator 
 
 

112 
The options that you can configure in the pricing calculator vary between products, but basic configuration 
options include: 
Option 
Description 
Region 
Lists the regions from which you can provision a product. Southeast Asia, central Canada, the 
western United States, and Northern Europe are among the possible regions available for 
some resources. 
Tier 
Sets the type of tier you wish to allocate to a selected resource, such as Free Tier, Basic Tier, 
etc. 
Billing Options 
Highlights the billing options available to different types of customer and subscriptions for a 
chosen product. 
Support 
Options 
Allows you to pick from included or paid support pricing options for a selected product. 
Programs and 
Offers 
Allows you to choose from available price offerings according to your customer or 
subscription type. 
Azure 
Dev/Test 
Pricing 
Lists the available development and test prices for a product. Dev/Test pricing applies only 
when you run resources within an Azure subscription that is based on a Dev/Test offer. 
12.4 PREDICT AND OPTIMIZE WITH COST MANAGEMENT AND AZURE ADVISOR 
We learned how to estimate your costs before you deploy services on Azure, but what if you already have 
resources deployed? How do you get visibility into the costs you’re already accruing? If we had deployed our 
previous solution to Azure and now want to make sure that we’ve sized the virtual machines properly and 
predict how much our bill will be, how can we do this? Let’s look at a few tools on Azure that you can use to 
help you solve this problem. 
12.4.1 WHAT IS AZURE ADVISOR? 
Azure Advisor is a free service built into Azure that provides recommendations on: 
• 
high availability 
• 
security, 
• 
performance 
• 
cost 
Advisor analyzes your deployed services and looks for ways to improve your environment across those four 
areas. We’ll focus on the cost recommendations, but you’ll want to take some time to review the other 
recommendations as well. 
Advisor makes high availability recommendations in the following areas: 
• 
Ensure virtual machine fault tolerance 
• 
Ensure availability set fault tolerance 
• 
Use Managed Disks to improve data reliability 
• 
Ensure application gateway fault tolerance 
• 
Protect your virtual machine data from accidental deletion 
• 
Configure Traffic Manager endpoints for resiliency 
• 
Use production VPN gateways to run your production workloads 

Azure Fundamentals 
113 
 
Advisor makes performance in the following areas: 
• 
Improve database performance with SQL DB Advisor 
• 
Improve App Service performance and reliability 
• 
Use Managed Disks to prevent disk I/O throttling 
• 
Improve the performance and reliability of virtual machine disks by using Premium Storage 
• 
Design your storage accounts to prevent hitting the maximum subscription limit 
• 
Add regions with traffic to your Azure Cosmos DB account 
Advisor makes cost recommendations in the following areas: 
• 
Reduce costs by eliminating unprovisioned Azure ExpressRoute circuits. This identifies ExpressRoute 
circuits that have been in the provider status of Not Provisioned for more than one month and 
recommends deleting the circuit if you aren’t planning to provision the circuit with your connectivity 
provider. 
• 
Buy reserved instances to save money over pay-as-you-go. This will review your virtual machine usage 
over the last 30 days and determine if you could save money in the future by purchasing reserved 
instances. Advisor will show you the regions and sizes where you potentially have the most savings and 
will show you the estimated savings you might achieve from purchasing reserved instances. 
• 
Right-size or shutdown underutilized virtual machines. This monitors your virtual machine usage for 14 
days and then identifies underutilized virtual machines. Virtual machines whose average CPU utilization 
is 5 percent or less and network usage is 7 MB or less for four or more days are considered underutilized 
virtual machines. The average CPU utilization threshold is adjustable up to 20 percent. By identifying

12.4.2 AZURE COST MANAGEMENT 
Azure Cost Management is another free, built-in Azure tool that can be used to gain greater insights into where 
your cloud money is going. You can see historical breakdowns of what services you are spending your money 
on and how it is tracking against budgets that you have set. You can set budgets, schedule reports, and 
analyze your cost areas.

12.5 ESTIMATE THE TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP WITH THE AZURE TCO CALCULATOR 
The pricing calculator and cost management advisor can help you predict and analyze your spend for new or 
existing services. 
If you are starting to migrate to the cloud, a useful tool you can use to predict your cost savings is the Total 
Cost of Ownership (TCO) calculator. The TCO calculator uses a comprehensive list of on-premises assumptions 
that Microsoft has put together based on years of experience, and these assumptions are used to provide you 
with the best estimate possible of your cost savings. 
To use the TCO calculator, you need to complete four steps. 
12.5.1 STEP 1: OPEN THE TCO CALCULATOR 
Start by opening the Total Cost of Ownership calculator website. 
12.5.2 STEP 2: DEFINE YOUR WORKLOADS 
Start by entering details about your on-premises infrastructure into the TCO calculator according to four groups: 
Group 
Description 
Servers 
Enter details of your current on-premises server infrastructure. 
Databases 
Enter details of your on-premises database infrastructure in the Source section. In the 
Destination section, select the corresponding Azure service you would like to use. 
Storage 
Enter the details of your on-premises storage infrastructure. 
Networking 
Enter the amount of network bandwidth you currently consume in your on-premises environment. 
12.5.3 STEP 3: ADJUST ASSUMPTIONS 
Adjust the values of assumptions that the TCO calculator makes, which might vary between customers. To 
improve the accuracy of the TCO calculator, you should adjust the values, so they match the costs of your 
current on-premises infrastructure. The assumptions you can customize include: 
• 
Storage costs 
• 
IT labor costs 
• 
Hardware costs 
• 
Software costs 
• 
Electricity costs 
• 
Virtualization costs 
• 
Datacenter costs 
• 
Networking costs 
• 
Database costs 
 
12.5.4 STEP 4: VIEW THE REPORT 
The TCO calculator generates a detailed report based on the details you enter and the adjustments you make. 
The report allows you to compare the costs of your on-premises infrastructure with the costs of using Azure 
products and services to host your infrastructure in the cloud.

12.6 SAVE ON INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS 
We have seen how to create cost estimates for environments you’d like to build, walked through some tools to 
get details on where we’re spending money, and projected future expenses. Our next challenge is to look at 
how to reduce those infrastructure costs. 
12.6.1 USE AZURE CREDITS 
Visual Studio subscribers can activate a monthly credit benefit which allows you to experiment with, develop, 
and test new solutions on Azure. Use Azure credits to try out new services such as App Service, Windows 10 
VMs, Azure SQL Server databases, Containers, Cognitive Services, Functions, Data Lake, and more without 
incurring any monetary costs. 
When you activate this benefit, you will own a separate Azure subscription under your account with a monthly 
credit balance that renews each month while you remain an active Visual Studio subscriber. 
12.6.2 USE SPENDING LIMITS 
By default, Azure subscriptions which have associated monthly credits (which includes trial accounts) have a 
spending limit to ensure you aren’t charged once you have used up your credits. This feature is useful for 
development teams exploring new solution architectures as it ensures you won’t have an unexpectedly large 
bill at the end of the month. 
Azure provides the Spending Limits feature to help prevent you from exhausting the credit on your account 
within each billing period. When your Azure usage results in charges that use all the included monthly credit, 
the services that you deployed are disabled and turned off for the rest of that billing period. Once a new billing 
period starts, assuming there are credits available, the resources are re-activated and deployed. 
You are notified by email when you hit the spending limit for your subscription. In addition, the Azure portal 
includes notifications about your credit spend. You can adjust the spending limit as desired or even turn it off. 
 
 

116 
12.6.3 USE RESERVED INSTANCES 
If you have VM workloads that are static and predictable, particularly ones that run 24x7x365, using reserved 
instances is a fantastic way to potentially save up to 70-80%, depending on the VM size. 
Reserved instances are purchased in one-year or three-year terms, with payment required for the full term up 
front. After it’s purchased, Microsoft matches up the reservation to running instances and decrements the 
hours from your reservation. 
12.6.4 CHOOSE LOW-COST LOCATIONS AND REGIONS 
The cost of Azure products, services, and resources can vary across locations and regions, and if possible, you 
should use them in those locations and regions where they cost less. 
12.6.5 RESEARCH AVAILABLE COST-SAVING OFFERS 
Keep up-to-date with the latest Azure customer and subscription offers, and switch to offers that provide the 
most significant cost-saving benefit. 
12.6.6 RIGHT-SIZE UNDERUTILIZED VIRTUAL MACHINES 
Recall from our previous discussion that Azure Cost Management and Azure Advisor might recommend right-
sizing or shutting down VMs. Right-sizing a virtual machine is the process of resizing it to a proper size. Over-
sized virtual machines are a common unnecessary expense on Azure and one that can be easily fixed. You can 
change the size of a VM through the Azure portal, Azure PowerShell, or the Azure CLI. 
12.6.7 DEALLOCATE VIRTUAL MACHINES IN OFF HOURS 
If you have virtual machine workloads that are only used during certain periods, but you’re running them every 
hour of every day, you’re wasting money. These VMs are great candidates to shut down when not in use and 
start back up on a schedule, saving you compute costs while the VM is deallocated. 
This approach is an excellent strategy for development environments. It’s often the case that development may 
happen only during business hours, giving you the flexibility to deallocate these systems in the off hours and 
stopping your compute costs from accruing. Azure now has an automation solution fully available for you to 
leverage in your environment. 
You can also use the auto-shutdown feature on a virtual machine to schedule automated shutdowns. 
12.6.8 DELETE UNUSED VIRTUAL MACHINES 
This advice may sound obvious, but if you aren’t using a service, you should shut it down. It’s not uncommon to 
find non-production or proof-of-concept systems left around following a project that is no longer needed. 
Regularly review your environment and work to identify these systems. Shutting down these systems can have 
a multifaceted benefit by saving you not only on infrastructure costs but also potential savings on licensing and 
operations.

117 
 
12.6.9 MIGRATE TO PAAS OR SAAS SERVICES 
Lastly, as you move workloads to the cloud, a natural evolution is to start with infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) 
services and then move them to platform-as-a-service (PaaS) as appropriate, in an iterative process. 
PaaS services typically provide substantial savings in both resource and operational costs. The challenge is 
that depending on the type of service, varying levels of effort will be required to move to these services from 
both a time and resource perspective. You might be able to move a SQL Server database to Azure SQL 
Database easily, but it might take substantially more effort to transfer your multi-tier application to a container 
or serverless based architecture. It’s a good practice to continuously evaluate the architecture of your 
applications to determine if there are efficiencies to be gained through PaaS services. 
Azure makes it easy to test these services with little risk, giving you the ability to try out new architecture 
patterns relatively easily. That said, it’s typically a longer journey and might not be of immediate help if you’re 
looking for quick wins from a cost-savings perspective. The Azure Architecture Center is a great place to get 
ideas for transforming your application, as well as best practices across a wide array of architectures and 
Azure services. 
12.7 SAVE ON LICENSING COSTS 
Licensing is another area that can dramatically impact your cloud spending. Let’s look at some ways you can 
reduce your licensing costs. 
12.7.1 LINUX VS. WINDOWS 
Many of the Azure services you deploy have the choice of running on Windows or Linux. In some cases, the cost 
of the product can be different based on the OS you choose. Where you have a choice, and your application 
doesn’t depend on the underlying OS, it’s useful to compare pricing to determine whether you can save money. 
12.7.2 AZURE HYBRID BENEFIT FOR WINDOWS SERVER 
Many customers have invested in Windows Server licenses and would like to repurpose this investment on 
Azure. The Azure Hybrid Benefit gives customers the right to use these licenses for virtual machines on Azure. 
That means you won’t be charged for the Windows Server license and will instead be billed at the Linux rate. 
To be eligible for this benefit, your Windows licenses must be covered by Software Assurance. 
 
 

118 
12.7.3 AZURE HYBRID BENEFIT FOR SQL SERVER 
The Azure Hybrid Benefit for SQL Server helps you maximize the value from your current licensing investments 
and accelerate your migration to the cloud. Azure Hybrid Benefit for SQL Server is an Azure-based benefit that 
enables you to use your SQL Server licenses with active Software Assurance to pay a reduced rate. 
12.7.4 USE DEV/TEST SUBSCRIPTION OFFERS 
The Enterprise Dev/Test and Pay-As-You-Go Dev/Test offers are a benefit you can take advantage of to save 
costs on your non-production environments. This benefit gives you several discounts, most notably for Windows 
workloads, eliminating license charges and only billing you at the Linux rate for virtual machines. This also 
applies to SQL Server and any other Microsoft software that is covered under a Visual Studio subscription 
(formerly known as MSDN). 
There are a few requirements for this benefit, one being that it’s only for non-production workloads, and 
another being that any users of these environments (excluding testers) must be covered under a Visual Studio 
subscription. In short, for non-production workloads, this allows you to save money on your Windows, SQL 
Server, and other Microsoft virtual machine workloads. 
Below are the full details of each offer. If you are a customer on an Enterprise Agreement, you’d want to 
leverage the Enterprise Dev/Test offer, and if you are a customer without an Enterprise Agreement and are 
instead using PAYG accounts, you’d leverage the Pay-As-You-Go Dev/Test offer. 
12.7.5 BRING YOUR OWN SQL SERVER LICENSE 
If you are a customer on an Enterprise Agreement and already have an investment in SQL Server licenses, and 
they have freed up as part of moving resources to Azure, you can provision bring your own license (BYOL) 
images off the Azure Marketplace, giving you the ability to take advantage of these unused licenses and 
reduce your Azure VM cost. You’ve always been able to do this by provisioning a Windows VM and manually 
installing SQL Server, but this simplifies the creation process by leveraging Microsoft certified images. Search 
for BYOL in the Marketplace to find these images. 
An Enterprise Agreement subscription is required to use these certified BYOL images. 
12.7.6 USE SQL SERVER DEVELOPER EDITION 
A lot of people are unaware that SQL Server Developer Edition is a free product for nonproduction use. 
Developer Edition has all the same features that Enterprise Edition has, but for nonproduction workloads, you 
can save dramatically on your licensing costs. 
12.7.7 USE CONSTRAINED INSTANCE SIZES FOR DATABASE WORKLOADS 
Many customers have high requirements for memory, storage, or I/O bandwidth but low CPU core counts. 
Based on this popular request, Microsoft has made available the most popular VM sizes (DS, ES, GS, and MS) 
in new sizes that constrain the vCPU count to one half or one-quarter of the original VM size, while maintaining 
the same memory, storage, and I/O bandwidth.

13 SERVICE LIFECYCLE 
13.1 PRIVATE PREVIEWS 
Private previews are generally the first release of a product and customers are invited to try the service to help 
provide feedback, to understand if the service is something that is needed as well as help to shape the future 
of the product. 
Generally there is a limited number of customers that are invited into a private preview and these customers 
are expected to spend time with the Product Group* providing their feedback of the product. 
All preview services are provided “as is” and aren’t covered by any Service Level Agreements (SLA). They are 
generally not supported by customer support either, however some support is provided via the Product Group. 
There is also no guarantee that a preview feature will go into General Availability. 
Previews are generally free of charge. 
13.2 PUBLIC PREVIEW 
After a product has went through the private preview stage, the next stage is a larger public preview. Again this 
is used to understand customer needs and help shape the future of the product. Private Preview offerings are 
often advertised on the Azure blogs or places such as Twitter. 
Again, as with the private preview, all preview services are provided “as is” and aren’t covered by any Service 
Level Agreements (SLA). Again though, previews are generally free of charge. 
Getting involved with the private or public previews is a great way of testing services and help drive products in 
the direction that would be useful for you and your organization. 
13.3 GENERAL AVAILABILITY (GA) 
When a service goes GA it is in full production mode. It is fully supported by SLAs, customer support and is 
viable for production workloads. Now that the service is live it is also chargeable. 
13.4 HOW TO ACCESS PREVIEW FEATURES 
You can activate specific preview features through the preview features page. This page lists the preview 
features that are available for evaluation. To preview a feature, select the Try it button for the relevant feature. 
Another preview area you can try is the next version of the Azure portal. Use the URL 
https://preview.portal.azure.com.
