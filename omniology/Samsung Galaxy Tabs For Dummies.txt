Samsung Galaxy Tabs For Dummies 
Beyond the Book
Bonus information for this title can be found online. You can visit the 
publisher’s website to find an online cheat sheet at
www.dummies.com/cheatsheet/samsunggalaxytabs
Supplemental online material has been created for this book. Because the 
book can only be so big, but also because the publisher is making me do it, 
seeing how people are growing more and more fearful of printed material, 
that supplemental stuff can be found at
www.dummies.com/extras/samsunggalaxytabs
Updates to this book might someday be found at
www.dummies.com/extras/samsunggalaxytabs
Beyond the stuff that the publisher requires me to write about, I do my 
own updates, blog posts, alerts, and helpful information. It’s updated more 
frequently than the publisher’s website because I’m an individual and the 
­publisher is a big corporation. You can find my own information at
www.wambooli.com
Specific support for the Galaxy Tab and Galaxy Note is found here:
www.wambooli.com/help/tablets/galaxy
My e-mail address is dgookin@wambooli.com. Yes, that’s my real address.  
I reply to all e-mail I get, and you’ll get a quick reply if you keep your  
question short and specific to this book. Although I do enjoy saying “Hi,”  
I cannot answer technical support questions, resolve billing issues, or  
help you troubleshoot your Galaxy Tab or Galaxy Note. Thanks for  
understanding.
Enjoy this book and your Galactic tablet!
Where to Go from Here
Start reading! Observe the table of contents and find something that interests 
you. Or look up your puzzle in the index. When these suggestions don’t cut it, 
just start reading Chapter 1.

20
Part I: A Galaxy in Your Hands 
	
13.	Touch the right-facing triangle.
	
	If you have another Android mobile device, or use any of Google’s online 
services, your account information is updated and synchronized with 
your new Galaxy Note or Galaxy Tab. For example, existing contacts are 
updated on the tablet, and settings made on other Android devices are 
copied to your new tablet. This process may take a few minutes.
	
14.	Continue working through the installation process.
	
	At this point, a number of things could happen, depending on which 
tablet or cellular provider you have. Continue answering questions, 
touching the Next or right-facing triangle, until the process is over.
	
	Eventually, you will . . .
	
15.	Touch the Finish button.
The good news is that you’re done. The better news is that you need to com-
plete this setup only once on your Galaxy tablet. From this point on, starting 
the tablet works as described in the next few sections.
	
✓	Most of the settings, choices, and options you’ve made during the initial 
setup process can be changed later.
	
✓	You may be asked various questions or prompted to try various tricks 
when you first start to use the tablet. Some of those prompts are helpful, 
but it’s okay to skip things or select the Do Not Show Again box.
	
✓	App is short for application, which is like a computer program but one 
that runs on a tablet. Part of the setup process (Step 13 in the preceding 
list) involves synchronizing your new Galaxy tablet with apps you’ve 
previously obtained for an Android mobile device.
	
✓	See Chapter 15 for information on obtaining apps from the Google Play 
Store.
	
✓	See the later sidebar “Who is this Android person?” for more ­information 
about the Android operating system.
Turning on your tablet
To turn on your Galaxy tablet, press and hold down the Power Lock key. After 
a few seconds, you see the tablet’s start-up logo and then some hypnotic ani-
mation. The tablet is coming to life.
Eventually, you see the main unlock screen, similar to what’s shown in 
Figure 2-1. The screen may appear in a vertical orientation, depending on 
how you’ve oriented the tablet.
Slide your finger across the screen, just above the text Swipe Screen to 
Unlock. The tablet unlocks and you can start using it.
You probably won’t turn on your Galaxy tablet much in the future. Mostly, 
you’ll unlock the gizmo. See the later section “Unlocking the tablet.”


22
Part I: A Galaxy in Your Hands 
The PIN lock requires that you type a secret number to unlock the tablet. 
Touch the OK button to unlock the tablet, or use the Del (X) icon to back up 
and erase.
To work the Pattern lock, you trace your finger over the nine dots that appear 
on the screen (refer to Figure 2-2) according to a preset pattern. Upon match-
ing the pattern, the tablet is unlocked.
The Password lock requires that you type a multicharacter password to 
unlock the tablet. Touch the Done button on the keyboard to accept the  
password and unlock the tablet.
Finally, the Face lock screen works when you hold up the tablet and gaze at 
the touchscreen. If the voice option has been added, you’ll be prompted to 
utter a vocal password, such as “open sesame.” This option may not be avail-
able on all tablets.
Whether or not you see these various lock screens depends on how you’ve 
configured your tablet’s security. Directions for setting the locks as well as 
for removing them and returning to the standard screen lock are found in 
Chapter 19.
	
✓	The Pattern lock can start at any dot, not necessarily the upper-left dot, 
as shown in Figure 2-2.
	
✓	For additional information on working the onscreen keyboard, see 
Chapter 4.
Unlocking the tablet
You’ll probably leave your Galaxy Note or Galaxy Tab on all the time. The tab-
lets are designed that way and the battery supports keeping it on for lengthy 
periods of time. When your tablet is bored or you’ve ignored it for a while, 
it locks itself in a manner similar to a computer entering sleep mode. When 
locked, the touchscreen turns off to save power.
	
✓	To unlock the tablet, press the Power Lock key. Unlike when turning on 
the tablet, a quick press is all that’s needed.
	
✓	You can unlock the tablet also by pressing the Home key.
	
✓	On the Galaxy Note, you can unlock the tablet by removing the S Pen.
After unlocking the tablet, you see the unlock screen (refer to Figure 2-1). Or 
if you’ve configured the tablet for more security, you see one of the unlock-
ing screens (refer to Figure 2-2). Simply unlock the screen, and you can start 
using the device.

Accessing a widget
Like apps, widgets can appear on the Home screen. To use a widget, touch it. 
What happens next depends on the widget and what it does.
For example, the YouTube widget lets you peruse videos. The Calendar 
widget shows a preview of your upcoming schedule.
Other widgets do interesting things, display useful information, or give you 
access to the tablet’s settings or features.
	
✓	Just like apps, new widgets are obtained from the Google Play Store. See 
Chapter 15 for information.
	
✓	See Chapter 19 for details on adding widgets to the Home screen.
Reviewing notifications
Notifications appear as icons at the top left of the Home screen (refer to 
Figure 3-3). To review them, you pull down the notifications shade by drag-
ging your finger downward from the top-left part of the screen. The 
notifications shade is illustrated in Figure 3-5.

 Chapter 3: Find Your Way around the Galaxy
Touch a notification to deal with it. What happens next depends on the 
notification, but most often the app that generated the notification appears. 
You might also be given the opportunity to deal with whatever caused the 
notification, such as a calendar appointment.
Dismiss an individual notification by touching it and then swiping to the right 
or left. To dismiss all notifications, touch the Clear button. Some ongoing 
notifications, such as the USB notification in Figure 3-5, cannot be dismissed.
When you’re done looking, you can slide the notifications shade up again: 
Swipe the notifications shade handle by dragging your finger up the screen. If 
you find this process frustrating (and it is), touch the Back button.
	
✓	If you don’t deal with notifications, they can stack up!
	
✓	Notification icons disappear after they’ve been chosen.
	
✓	Dismissing some notifications doesn’t prevent them from appearing 
again in the future. For example, notifications to update your programs 
continue to appear, as do calendar reminders.
	
✓	The text above the notification shade handle refers to the currently con-
nected Wi-Fi network. In Figure 3-5, it’s “Imperial Wambooli,” my office 
network.
	
✓	Some apps, such as Facebook and Twitter, don’t display notifications 
unless you’re logged in. See Chapter 8.
	
✓	The tablet plays a sound, or ringtone, when a new notification floats  
in. You can choose which sound plays; see Chapter 19 for more  
information.
Making Quick Settings
Many common settings and features for your Galaxy Note or Galaxy Tab can 
be found atop the notifications shade. These Quick Settings appear as large 
icons (refer to Figure 3-5).
To see all Quick Settings, swipe the row of icons left or right. Or you can 
reorient the tablet to a horizontal position. Touching the Quick Settings icon 
in the upper-right corner of the screen (refer to Figure 3-5) displays the whole 
lot of them.
To activate a setting, touch its icon. When the setting is on, it appears high-
lighted in green. Touch a highlighted setting to turn it off.
You find out how to use the various settings throughout the book. Generally 
speaking, any item that can be turned on or off — such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, 
Airplane Mode, Sound, and so on — can be accessed quickly from a Quick 
Settings icon.

Playing with Multi Window
Samsung Galaxy tablets feature a unique multitasking feature called Multi 
Window. It allows you to view two apps side-by-side on the touchscreen. This 
is opposed to how apps normally run, which is full screen.
Before you can use Multi Window, ensure that it’s activated. The quick 
way to turn on this feature is to pull down the notifications shade and 
choose the Multi Window quick action. When it’s activated, you’ll see 
the Multi Window handle on the right side of the Home screen (refer to 
Figure 3-3).
To use Multi Window, tap the handle to view the various apps sitting in the 
tray. Drag an app icon from the tray out onto the screen to start that app. To 
start a second app, drag another icon from the tray onto the screen.

If you don’t see the Air Command gizmus, ensure that it’s activated on your 
Galaxy Note. Open the Settings app, found on the Apps screen. Touch the 
Controls tab and choose the S Pen category from the left side of the window. 
On the right side, ensure that the Air Command item has a green ON button 
to its right. If not, touch the button.
Doing some S Pen tricks
Those Galaxy Tab owners are going to laugh at you if you use the S Pen just 
as a substitute for your finger. Make those guys seethe with jealousy by show-
ing them some of these fancy S Pen tricks:
Screen capture and scribble: To take a snapshot of the screen, press and 
hold down the S Pen button while long-pressing the S Pen to the touchscreen. 
After about two seconds, you’ll hear a shutter click sound. The screen shot 
is saved. You’re then given an opportunity to scribble on the screen shot and 
save it with your edits. This trick works just like the Screen Write command, 
covered in the preceding section.
Selective screen capture: Press and hold down the S Pen button and then 
draw around a chunk of information on the screen. That chunk — the 
exact size you drew around — is presented on the screen. Choose an app 
from the bottom of the screen and the chunk is sent to that app for further 
manipulation.
Quick launch the Action Memo app: When you’re in dire need to access the 
Action Memo app and using the Air Command control is too bothersome, 
press the S Pen button and double-tap the screen. Voilà!

Figure 4-1: The onscreen keyboard.
In Figure 4-1, the onscreen keyboard is shown in alphabetic mode. You see 
keys from A through Z in lowercase. You also see a Shift key for producing 
capital letters, and a Delete key, which backspaces and erases.
The Enter key, which is below the Delete key, changes its look depending on 
what you’re typing. Five variations are shown in Figure 4-1. Here’s what each 
one does:
	
✓	Enter/Return: Just like the Enter or Return key on a computer keyboard, 
this key ends a paragraph of text. It’s used mostly when filling in long 
stretches of text or when multiline input is needed.
	
✓	Go: This action key directs the app to proceed with a search, accept 
input, or perform another action.
	
✓	Search: You see the Search key when you’re searching for something. 
Touching the key starts the search.
	
✓	Next: This key appears when you’re typing information in multiple fields. 
Touching this key switches from one field to the next, such as when 
typing a username and a password.
	
✓	Done: This key appears whenever you’ve finished typing text in the 
final field of a screen that has several fields. Sometimes it dismisses the 
onscreen keyboard; sometimes not.
The large key at the bottom center of the onscreen keyboard is the Space key. 
The keys to the left and right may change depending on the context of what 
you’re typing. For example, a www or .com key may appear to assist in typing 
a web page or an e-mail address. Other keys may change as well, although the 
basic alphabetic keys remain the same.



51
 Chapter 4: Typing and Text
As you type, the key you touch is highlighted. The tablet may give a wee bit 
of feedback in the form of a faint click.
	
✓	Above all, it helps to type slowly until you get used to the onscreen 
­keyboard.
	
✓	When you make a mistake, press the Delete key to back up and erase.
	
✓	A blinking cursor on the touchscreen shows where new text appears, 
which is similar to how text input works on your computer.
	
✓	When you type a password, each character you type appears briefly, but 
for security reasons, it’s then replaced by a black dot.
	
✓	See the later section, “Text Editing,” for more details on editing your text.
Typing quickly by using predictive text
As you type, you may see a selection of word suggestions just above the key-
board. That’s the tablet’s Predictive Text feature. You can use this feature to 
greatly accelerate your typing.
In Figure 4-4, I typed the word I. The keyboard then suggested the word 
thought, which I chose from the Predictive Text list. Then I chose the word I 
again, and then the word was.
To see additional text, touch the arrow button, illustrated in Figure 4-4. You’ll 
see more words that you can choose from. Touching a word inserts it in the 
text.
When your desired word doesn’t appear, continue typing: The Predictive Text 
feature begins making suggestions based on what you’ve typed so far. Touch 
the right word when it appears.
To ensure that the Predictive Text has been activated on your tablet, follow 
these steps:
	
1.	Long-press the Microphone key on the onscreen keyboard.
	
2.	From the pop-up menu, choose the Gear icon.

	 The Gear icon represents settings. In this case, you see the Samsung 
Keyboard Settings screen.
	
3.	Ensure that the button next to the Predictive Text option is green.
	
	 Green means on. If the button isn’t green, touch it to turn it green and 
activate Predictive Text.
	
4.	Touch the Back button to return to your typing.
Likewise, if you find Predictive Text boring and predictable, disable it by 
repeating these steps but turning off the option in Step 3.
Adding SwiftKey Flow
If you’re really after typing speed, consider enabling the onscreen keyboard’s 
SwiftKey Flow feature. It allows you to type words by swiping your finger over 
the keyboard, like mad scribbling but with a positive result. To enable this 
feature, follow these steps when the onscreen keyboard is visible:
	
1.	Long-press the Microphone key.
	
2.	Choose the Gear icon from the pop-up menu.
	
3.	Ensure that the SwiftKey Flow item is selected.
	
	 Either place a check mark in the box or ensure that the SwiftKey Flow 
item is chosen from the list of options.
	
4.	If you see a warning about disabling cursor control, touch the OK 
button.
	
	 See the later section, “Moving the cursor,” for information on controlling 
the cursor.
When SwiftKey Flow is active, you type by dragging your fingers over letters 
on the keyboard. Figure 4-5 illustrates how the word hello would be typed in 
this manner.
Figure 4-5: Using SwiftKey Flow to type hello.
The SwiftKey Flow feature may not be active when you need to type a pass-
word or for specific apps on the tablet. If it doesn’t work, use the onscreen 
keyboard one letter at a time.

Providing that you followed my advice in Step 3, the new contact is automati-
cally synched with your Google account. That’s one beauty of the Android 
operating system used by the Galaxy Note and Galaxy Tab: You have no need 
to duplicate your efforts; contacts you create on the tablet are instantly 
updated with your Google account on the Internet.
	
✓	It’s also possible to use your Samsung account, should you have one, to 
synchronize contacts across multiple Samsung devices you may own. If 
so, choose that account in Step 3. (Refer to Figure 5-2 for the location to 
tap to choose another account.)
	
✓	Information from social networking sites is stirred into the Contacts list 
automatically, though sometimes the process creates duplicate entries. 
See the “Joining identical contacts” section to remedy such a situation.
Creating a contact from an e-mail message
Perhaps one of the easiest ways to build up the Contacts list is to create a 
contact from an e-mail message. Follow these steps when you receive a mes-
sage from someone not already in the tablet’s address book:
	
1.	Touch the picture by the contact’s name at the top of the message.
	
	 The picture, whether it shows a generic image or the contact’s actual 
visage, is a button. Touching that button displays a pop-up window with 
additional information and two buttons.
	
2.	Touch the Create Contact button.
	
3.	Choose your Google account as the location to save the contact’s 
­information.
	
	 Refer to the preceding section for my reason why Google is a good 
choice.
	
4.	Fill in the blanks on the New Contact screen, as shown in Figure 5-2.
	
	 The name and e-mail address may already be entered for you. Smart 
tablet, smart. Fill in other fields if you know them.
	
5.	Touch the Save button to finish adding the contact.
If the e-mail is from someone already in the tablet’s address book, touch the 
Update Existing button in Step 2. Scroll through the Contacts list to select the 
person. The contact information from the e-mail message is automatically 
added to that person’s entry in the address book.

 Chapter 5: All Your Friends in the Galaxy
Importing contacts from your computer
Your computer’s e-mail program is doubtless a useful repository of contacts 
you’ve built up over the years. You can export these contacts from your com-
puter’s e-mail program and then import them to the tablet. It’s not easy, but 
it’s possible.
The key is to save or export your computer e-mail program’s records in 
the vCard (.vcf) file format. These records can then be imported into the 
Contacts app. The method for exporting contacts varies depending on the 
e-mail program:
	
✓	In the Windows Live Mail program, choose Go➪Contacts and then 
choose File➪Export➪Business Card (.VCF) to export the contacts.
	
✓	In Windows Mail, choose File➪Export➪Windows Contacts and then 
choose vCards (Folder of .VCF Files) from the Export Windows Contacts 
dialog box. Click the Export button.
	
✓	On the Mac, open the Address Book program and choose File➪Export➪ 
Export vCard.
After the vCard files are created on your computer, connect the tablet to 
the computer and transfer them. Transferring files from your computer to a 
Galaxy tablet is covered in Chapter 17.
After the vCard files have been copied over, follow these steps in the 
Contacts app to complete the process:
	
1.	Touch the Menu button.
	
2.	Choose the Import/Export command.
	
3.	Choose Import from USB Storage.
	
	 If you’ve copied the contacts to the SD Card, choose Import from SD 
Card instead.
	
4.	Choose your Google account.
	
5.	Select the Import All vCard Files option.
	
6.	Touch the OK button.
	
	 The contacts are not only saved in the tablet but are also synchronized 
to your Gmail account, which instantly creates a backup copy.
The importing process may create some duplicates. That’s okay: You can join 
two entries for the same person in the Contacts app. See the “Joining identi-
cal contacts” section, later in this chapter.

Part II: Tablet Communications 
Grabbing contacts from your social networking sites
You can pour your whole gang of friends and followers from your social 
networking sites into the tablet. The operation is automatic: Simply add the 
social networking site’s app to the tablet’s inventory of apps as described in 
Chapter 8. At that time, you’ll be prompted to sync the contacts or the apps 
will be added instantly to the Contacts app’s address book.
Manage Your Friends
Nothing is truly perfect the first time, especially when you create things on a 
Galaxy tablet while typing with your thumbs at 34,000 feet during turbulence. 
You can do a whole slate of things with (and to) your friends in the tablet’s 
address book. This section covers the more interesting and useful things.
Editing contact information
To make minor touch-ups to any contact, start by locating and displaying the 
contact’s information in the Contacts app. Touch the Edit icon (similar to the 
pencil icon shown in the margin), and start making changes.
Change or add information by touching a field and typing with the onscreen 
keyboard. You can edit information as well: Touch the field to edit and 
change whatever you want.
Some information cannot be edited. For example, fields pulled in from social 
networking sites can be edited only by that account holder on the social net-
working site.
When you’ve finished editing, touch the Save button.
Taking a picture of a contact
Nothing can be more delicious than snapping an inappropriate picture of 
someone you know and using the picture as his contact picture on your 
Galaxy tablet. Then, every time he contacts you, that embarrassing, poten-
tially career-ending photo comes up.

69
 Chapter 5: All Your Friends in the Galaxy
I suppose you could use nice pictures as well, but what’s the fun in that?
To use the tablet’s camera to snap a contact picture, heed these directions:
	
1.	Locate and display the contact’s information.
	
2.	Touch the contact’s picture.
	
	 This trick works even when the picture is one of the boring generic 
images.
	
3.	Choose the Take Picture command.
	
4.	Use the tablet’s camera to snap a picture.
	
	 Chapter 11 covers using the camera. Both the front and rear cameras 
can be used (but not both at the same time). Touch the Shutter icon to 
take the picture.
	
5.	Review the picture.
	
	 Nothing is set yet. If you want to try again, touch the Discard button and 
start over in Step 4.
	
6.	Touch the Save button to confirm the new image and prepare for 
cropping.
	
7.	If you see a prompt asking you to choose an app, choose Gallery (Crop 
Picture) and touch the Just Once button.
	
	 Later, as you become more familiar with the tablet, you can touch the 
Always button, which speeds up the process.
	
8.	Crop the image, as shown in Figure 5-3.
	
	 Adjust the cropping box so that it surrounds only the portion of the 
image you want to keep.
	
9.	Touch the Done button to crop and save the image.
	
	 The image now appears whenever the contact is referenced on your tablet.

editing, and then choose the Remove command.
You can also use any image stored on the tablet as a contact’s picture. In  
Step 3, choose the Image command to view the Gallery. Browse for and select 
an image, and then crop.
See Chapter 12 for more information on the Gallery app.
Building contact groups
It’s possible to corral contacts into groups, which makes it easier to send that 
group an e-mail, to chat via voice or video, or to perform a number of inter-
esting group activities. The variety of things you can do depends on the apps 
installed on your tablet.

primarily need to specify only the incoming and outgoing server names.
	
	 Eventually, you’ll end up at the Account Options screen.
	
5.	Set the account options on the aptly named Account Options screen.
	
	 You might want to reset the Inbox Checking Frequency to something 
other than 15 minutes.
	
6.	Touch the Next button.
	
7.	Give the account a name and check your own name.
	
	 The account is given your e-mail address as a name. If you want to 
change the name, type something new in that field. For example, I name 
my ISP’s e-mail account Main because it’s my main account.
	
	 The Your Name field lists your name as it’s applied to outgoing mes-
sages. So if your name is really Wilma Flagstone and not wflag4457, you 
can make that change now.
	
8.	Touch the Done button.
	
	 You’re done.
The next thing you’ll see will be your e-mail account inbox. The tablet proceeds 
to synchronize any pending e-mail you have in your account, updating the 
screen as you watch. See the “You’ve Got E-Mail” section for what to do next.
Adding even more e-mail accounts
The Email app can be configured to collect mail from multiple sources. If you 
have a Yahoo! Mail, Windows Live, or corporate account, in addition to your 
ISP’s account, you can add them. Follow through with these steps:
	
1.	Visit the Apps screen and start the Settings app.
	
2.	Visit the Accounts area.
	
	 If you find category tabs across the top of the screen, tap the General 
tab to find the Accounts area. Otherwise, scroll down the items on the 
left side of the screen to find the Accounts area.
	
3.	Choose Add Account.
	
4.	If the list displays your account type, such as Yahoo! Mail, select it. 
Otherwise, select Email.
	
	 For accessing your evil organization’s Microsoft Outlook Exchange 
server, choose the Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync item. Be aware that 
this option requires a tad bit more setup than other types of e-mail 
accounts — but it can be done!
	
5.	Type the account’s e-mail address.
	
6.	Type the password for the account.

Reading e-mail
As mail comes in, you can read it by choosing the new e-mail notification, 
as described earlier in this chapter. Reading and working with the message 
operate much the same whether you’re using the Gmail or Email app.
Touch a message to read it. The message text appears on the right side of 
the window or full screen, depending on how the tablet is oriented. Scroll the 
message up or down by using your finger.
To work with the message, use the icons that appear above the message. 
These icons, which may not look exactly like those shown in the margin, 
cover common e-mail actions:

✓	The Email app’s composition window features a formatting toolbar 
(labeled in Figure 6‑4). If you don’t see it, touch the arrow icon on the 
right side of the composition window. Use the formatting icons as you 
type or select text and then apply a format. (Text selection is described 
in Chapter 4.)
	
✓	Use the Schedule Sending command to preset a time at which the Email 
app sends the e-mail. Normally, e-mail is sent right away. Or if an Internet 
connection isn’t available, e-mail is sent the next time the tablet is con-
nected. If you don’t see the Schedule Sending icon (refer to Figure 6‑4), 
touch the Menu button and choose the command from there.
	
✓	If the Priority icon doesn’t appear on the screen as shown in Figure 6‑4, 
touch the Menu button and choose the Priority command.
	
✓	Saved e-mail is found in the Drafts folder associated with the e-mail 
account you’re using. Select the Drafts folder from the left side of the 
screen, and then select the draft from the right side of the screen to edit 
or send.
	
✓	To cancel a message, touch the Discard button (refer to Figure 6‑4). 
Touch the Discard button in the Sending Canceled window to confirm.
Sending e-mail to a contact
A quick and easy way to compose a new message is to use the Contacts app 
to find a contact and then create a message using the contact’s information. 
Heed these steps:
	
1.	Open the Contacts app.
	
2.	Locate the contact to whom you want to send an electronic message.
	
3.	Touch the contact’s e-mail address.
	
4.	Select Gmail or Email to use the related app to compose the message.
	
5.	Touch Always to always use the app chosen in Step 4, or select Just 
Once to pick an app every time.
	
	 If you choose Always, the app you choose is always used to send e-mail 
to a contact; you won’t see the prompt in Step 4 again.
At this point, creating the message works as described in the preceding sections.
Message Attachments
The key to understanding attachments in the Galactic e-mail apps is to look 
for the paperclip icon. After you find that icon, you can either deal with an 
attachment for incoming e-mail or add an attachment to outgoing e-mail.

If you’re asked to sync your contacts, do so. I recommend choosing the Sync 
All option, which brings in all your Facebook friends to the tablet’s Contacts 
list. Touch the Sync button in the upper-right corner of the screen to begin 
using Facebook.
Eventually, you see the Facebook News Feed, similar to what’s shown in 
Figure 8-1.

Tweet Suite
Twitter is a social networking site, similar to Facebook but far briefer. On 
Twitter, you write short spurts of text that express your thoughts or observa-
tions, or you share links. Or you can just use Twitter to follow the thoughts 
and twitterings, or tweets, of other people.
	
✓	A message posted on Twitter is a tweet.
	
✓	A tweet can be no more than 140 characters long. That number includes 
spaces and punctuation.
	
✓	You can post messages on Twitter and follow others who post 
­messages. Twitter is a good way to get updates and information 
quickly, from not only individuals but also news outlets and other 
organizations.
Setting up Twitter
The best way to use Twitter on your Galaxy tablet is to already have a Twitter 
account. Start by going to http://twitter.com on a computer and follow-
ing the directions there for creating a new account.
After you’ve established a Twitter account, you can use the Twitter app 
on your tablet. Not all Galaxy tablets come with Twitter installed. If you  
don’t find the app on the Apps screen, you can obtain the Twitter  
app from the Google Play Store. Search for the Twitter app from Twitter, 
Inc. Refer to Chapter 15 for information on downloading apps to your 
tablet.
When you start the Twitter app for the first time, touch the Sign In button. Type 
your Twitter username or e-mail address and then type your Twitter ­password. 
After that, you can use Twitter without having to log in again — until you turn 
off the tablet or exit the Twitter app.
Figure 8-4 shows the Twitter app’s main screen, which shows the current 
tweet feed. The main screen may look subtly different on your tablet,  
depending on the Twitter app version.

Using Hangouts
The Hangouts app can be found on the Apps screen. If you don’t see it 
directly in the list of apps, look for it inside the Google folder. And if you still 
can’t find it, you can obtain the app from the Google Play Store. It’s free! See 
Chapter 15.
Hangouts hooks into your Google account. If you have any previous conver-
sations, they’re listed on left side the main screen, as shown in Figure 9-1. The 
right side of the screen shows frequent contacts. If you scroll down the right 
side, you’ll see all your Google contacts.

Figure 9-1: Google Hangouts.
The Hangouts app listens for incoming conversation requests; you can 
also start your own. You can even do other things on the tablet — you’ll be 
alerted via notification of an impending Hangout request.
To sign out of the app, which means you won’t receive any notifications, 
touch the Menu button and choose the Settings command. Choose the Sign 
Out item. (Scroll down to find that item.) Touch OK to confirm.
	
✓	When using the tablet in the vertical orientation, you need to swipe the 
right side of the screen to see previous conversations or the Contacts list.
	
✓	Conversations are archived in the Hangouts app. To peruse a previous 
text chat, select it from the list on the left. Video calls aren’t archived, 
but you can review when the call took place and with whom.
	
✓	To remove a previous conversation, long-press it. Touch the Trash icon 
that appears atop the screen.

Placing a Skype phone call
Ah. The big enchilada: Skype can be used to turn your Galaxy tablet — be it 
cellular or Wi-Fi — into a smartphone. It’s an amazing feat. And it works quite 
well, providing you have Skype Credit.
To ensure that you have Skype Credit, touch your Account icon on the main 
Skype screen, shown in Figure 9-5. Touch the Skype Credit item to see a sum-
mary of the credit and potentially get more, as illustrated in the figure.

After you have Skype Credit, you can use the tablet to make a “real” phone 
call, which is a call to any phone number on the planet (planet earth). Heed 
these steps:
	
1.	Choose a contact to call.
	
	 Your Skype contact must have a phone number listed in his contact 
information. Otherwise you’ll have to dial the number directly, which is 
described near the end of this section.
	
2.	Touch the Phone icon, in the upper-right corner of the screen.
	
	 If you don’t see the Phone icon, the contact’s information doesn’t 
include a real live phone number.

3.	Talk.
	
	 The Call screen looks similar to the one in Figure 9-6.
	
4.	To end the call, touch the red End Call button.
	
	 Refer to Figure 9-6 for the button’s location.
To dial a number not associated with a contact, touch the Phone icon at the 
top of the main Skype screen (refer to Figure 9-5, left). Punch in the number 
to dial, starting with 1 (for the United States), then the area code, and then 
the number. Touch the green Dial icon to place the call.
Lamentably, you can’t receive a phone call using Skype unless you pay for 
a Skype online number. In that case, you can use Skype to both send and 
receive regular phone calls. This book doesn’t cover the Online Number 
option.

Part III: Everything in the Galaxy 
There’s a Map for That
Your location, as well as the location of things near and far, is found on your 
Galaxy tablet by using the Maps app. Good news: You run no risk of improp-
erly folding the Maps app. Better news: The Maps app charts the entire coun-
try, including freeways, highways, roads, streets, avenues, drives, bike paths, 
addresses, businesses, and points of interest.
Using the Maps app
You start the Maps app by choosing Maps from the Apps screen. If you’re 
starting the app for the first time or it has been recently updated, you must 
agree to the terms and conditions. Do so as directed on the touchscreen.
The tablet communicates with global positioning system (GPS) satellites to 
hone in on your current location. (See the later sidebar, “Activate your loca-
tions!”) The position is accurate to within a given range, as shown by a blue 
circle around your location on the map, as shown in Figure 10-1. If the circle 
doesn’t appear, your location is either pretty darn accurate or you need to 
zoom in.
Here are some fun things you can do when viewing the basic street map:
Zoom in: To make the map larger (to move it closer), spread your fingers on 
the touchscreen.
Zoom out: To make the map smaller (to see more), pinch your fingers on the 
touchscreen.

Pan and scroll: To see what’s to the left or right or at the top or bottom of 
the map, drag your finger on the touchscreen; the map scrolls in the direction 
that you drag your finger.
Rotate: Using two fingers, rotate the map clockwise or counterclockwise. 
Touch the Compass Pointer (labeled in Figure 10-1) to reorient the map with 
north at the top of the screen.
Perspective: Touch the screen with two fingers and swipe up or down to view 
the map in perspective. You can also tap the Location button to switch to 
Perspective view, although this trick works only for your current location. To 
return to flat-map view, touch the Compass Pointer (refer to Figure 10-1).
The closer you zoom in to the map, the more detail you see, such as street 
names, address block numbers, businesses, and other sites — but no tiny 
people.
	
✓	The blue triangle (refer to Figure 10-1) shows in which general direction 
the tablet is pointing.
	
✓	When the tablet’s direction is unavailable, you see a blue dot as your 
location on the map.
	
✓	Touch the App icon to view the sidebar, shown in Figure 10-1. To hide 
the sidebar, touch the App icon again.
	
✓	When all you want is a virtual compass, similar to the one you lost as a 
kid, get the Compass app from the Google Play Store. See Chapter 15 for 
more information about the Google Play Store.
Adding layers
You add details to the map by applying layers: A layer can enhance the map’s 
visual appearance, provide more information, or add other fun features to the 
basic street map, such as Satellite view, shown in Figure 10-2.
The key to accessing layers is to touch the App icon in the upper-left corner 
of the screen. The sidebar displays several layers you can add, such as the 
Satellite layer shown in Figure 10-2. Another popular layer is Traffic, which 
lists updated travel conditions.
To remove a layer, choose it again from the Layers menu; any active layer 
appears highlighted in the sidebar. When a layer isn’t applied, the Street view 
appears.

Part III: Everything in the Galaxy 
Activate your locations!
The Maps app works best when you activate 
all location technology in the tablet. From the 
Apps screen, open the Settings icon. Select 
the Connections tab, and then select Location 
Services from the left side of the screen. If the 
Settings app lacks a Connections tab, scroll 
down the left side of the screen and choose 
Location Services.
Ensure that all the items on the right side of  
the screen are activated. Here’s what each 
means:
Access to My Location: Allows various apps 
to check in on the tablet’s (and therefore your) 
location. That information is used by the app for 
some purpose, usually locating things nearby or 
marking your location for later reference. If you 
don’t like that feature, turn it off.
Use GPS Satellites: Allows your tablet to access 
the GPS (global positioning system) satellites. 
But the tablet’s GPS is not that accurate, which 
is why you need to activate more than this ser-
vice to fully use your tablet’s location capabilities.
Use Wireless Networks: Allows the tablet to 
use signals from cell towers to triangulate your 
position and refine the data received from GPS 
satellites.
Use Mobile Network Location: Allows cellular 
tables to triangulate your location based on 
nearby cell towers. (This setting may be com-
bined with the Wi-Fi setting.)
The location services work best when you’ve 
activated the tablet’s Wi-Fi networking. See 
Chapter 16 for information.

Find Things
The Maps app can help you find places in the real world, just like the Internet 
app helps you find places on the Internet. Both operations work basically the 
same.
Open the Maps app and, in the Search text box, type something to find 
(refer to Figure 10-1). You can type a variety of terms in the Search box, as 
explained in this section.
Looking for a specific address
To locate an address, type it in the Search box; for example:
	
1600 Pennsylvania Ave., Washington, D.C. 20006
Touch the Search button on the keyboard, and the location is shown on the 
map. The next step is getting directions, which you can read about in the 
later section “Getting directions.”
	
✓	You don’t need to type the entire address. Oftentimes, all you need is 
the street number and street name and then either the city name or zip 
code.
	
✓	If you omit the city name or zip code, the tablet looks for the closest 
matching address near your current location.
	
✓	Touch the X icon in the Search box to clear the previous search.

 Chapter 10: Getting from Here to There
Searching for favorite or recent places
Just as you can bookmark favorite websites on the Internet, you can mark 
favorite places in the real world by using the Maps app. The feature is called 
Saved Places.
To visit your favorite places or browse your recent map searches, touch the 
Saved Places icon at the top of the Maps app screen. If you don’t see the icon, 
touch the X button in the Search box.
The Saved Places window sports various categories of places you’ve starred 
(marked as favorites), locations you’ve recently searched for, or places 
you’ve been.

The Whole Google Earth
The Google Earth map is similar to the Maps app, except it covers the entire 
planet. And while you can get around and explore your locale or destination using 
the Maps app, Google Earth is more of a look-and-see, interactive world atlas.
To run Google Earth, start the Earth app, found on the All Apps screen. You 
can also find a shortcut on the Maps app sidebar (refer to Figure 10-1).
If Google Earth isn’t installed on your tablet, then you can obtain the app 
from the Google Play Store. Refer to Chapter 15.

Capturing the moment
Picture-taking and video-recording duties on your Galaxy tablet are handled 
by the same app, the Camera app. You may be able to find a shortcut to that 
app on the Home screen, and it also dwells with all its app buddies on the 
Apps screen.
The Camera app controls both the main camera, which is on the tablet’s butt, 
and the front-facing camera, which is not on the tablet’s butt. The app also 
takes still images as well as records videos, depending on how it’s used.
After starting the Camera app, you see the main Camera screen, as illustrated 
in Figure 11-1.

To record video, touch the Video Camera icon (labeled in Figure 11-1). As 
video is being recorded, two new icons appear: Stop and Pause. Touch the 
Stop icon to end the recording; touch Pause to suspend recording; touch that 
same icon again, which is now the Record icon, to continue. Then, finally, 
touch the Stop icon to end the video.
To preview the image or video, touch the Previous Image icon, which appears 
in the lower-left corner of the screen (labeled in Figure 11-1). After viewing 
the preview, touch the Back button to return to the Camera app.

Part III: Everything in the Galaxy 
Touch the Switch Camera icon again to direct the Galaxy tablet to go back to 
using the main camera.
You can use the Self View icon (shown in the margin and in Figure 11-1) to 
take a picture or record a video using both the front and rear cameras at the 
same time.
Taking in a panorama
No, it’s not an exotic new alcoholic drink: A panorama is a wide shot, like 
a landscape, a beautiful vista, or a family photograph after a garlic feast. 
To take a panoramic shot using your Galaxy tablet, you need to switch the 
camera to Panorama mode and then capture several pictures in sequence. 
Obey these steps:
	
1.	Start the Camera app.
	
2.	Touch the Mode button.
	
3.	Choose Panorama.
	
	 Scroll the list of modes with your finger, and then touch Panorama.
	
4.	Hold your arms steady.
	
5.	Touch the Shutter icon.
	
	 You see a frame and a guide on the screen, which approximates the 
current shot and the extent (left-right or up-down) for the panorama. 
Arrows point in the directions in which you can pan.
	
6.	Pivot slightly to your right (or in whatever direction, but you must 
continue in the same direction).
	
	 As you move the camera, the onscreen frame adjusts to your new  
position. The tablet beeps as the next image in the panorama is snapped 
automatically. All you need to do is keep moving.
	
7.	Continue pivoting as subsequent shots are taken, or touch the Shutter 
icon again to finish the panorama.
	
	 After the last image is snapped, wait while the panorama is assembled.
The Camera app sticks the different shots together, creating a panoramic 
image.
	
✓	To exit Panorama mode, repeat Steps 1 and 2, but in Step 3 choose Auto 
as the shooting mode.

4.	Perform an action on the group of images or videos.
	
	 To remove the images, touch the Delete icon (labeled in Figure 12-6). To 
share the images with other sources, touch the Share icon. If you tap 
the Menu button, you’ll see commands to Copy and Move the images to 
another album in the Gallery.
To deselect items, touch them again. To deselect everything, choose the 
Unselect All command from the Selected menu. Or if you want to cancel 
deselecting items, touch the App icon button in the upper-left corner of the 
screen.
The type of commands you can use on a group of items in an album depends 
on the group. Some commands, such as Delete and Share, can be performed 
on any old group. Other commands, such as the image rotation commands, 
work only with pictures, not with videos.
Set Your Pics and Vids Free
Keeping your precious moments and memories by themselves in the tablet 
is an elegant solution to the problem of lugging around photo albums and a 
video projector. When you want to show your pictures to the widest possible 
audience, however, you need a bigger stage. That stage is the Internet, and 
you have many ways to send and save your pictures and videos online, as 
covered in this section.
Refer to Chapter 17 for information on synchronizing and sharing information 
between the Galaxy tablet and your computer.
Accessing your Picasa Web account
Part of your Google account includes access to the online photo-sharing 
website, Picasa Web. If you haven’t yet been to the Picasa Web site on the 
Internet, use your computer to visit http://picasaweb.google.com.
Configure things by logging into your Google account on that website.
The Picasa Web account should be synchronized and configured automati-
cally with your Galaxy tablet. So if you’ve saved pictures on the Picasa Web 
site, you can find them on the tablet, similar to those shown in Figure 12-1. If 
not, follow these steps to ensure that Picasa Web is being property synced:

3.	Touch the Turn On Camera Upload text.
	
	 The text is found below the Camera Upload heading. If it instead reads 
Turn Off Camera Upload, you’re all set. Unless you have a cellular tablet, 
in which case I recommend that you:
	
4.	Select the Upload Using item.
	
5.	Select Wi-Fi Only.
	
	 By setting this item, you ensure that the tablet uploads images only 
when connected to a Wi-Fi network. That means you won’t use precious 
megabytes from your monthly mobile data allocation.
With camera upload on, any image you snap is instantly copied to the Camera 
Uploads folder in your Dropbox account. If you use Dropbox on a computer, 
you can immediately access those pictures and videos. That’s handy.
Printing your pictures
Yes, it’s wireless. Yes, it’s mobile. No, it shouldn’t have a printer attached, but 
golly, it’s almost a crime not to be able to print some of those images in your 
Galaxy tablet. So rather than break the law, you can instead print from your 
tablet. You have several options. Two of the most popular are Bluetooth and 
Google Cloud Print, described in the following subsections.
Bluetooth
To print an image to a Bluetooth printer, follow these steps:
	
1.	Ensure that the Bluetooth printer has been paired with the computer, 
is on, and is ready to print.
	
	 The pairing process is discussed in Chapter 16.
	
2.	Locate the image you want to print in the Gallery.
	
	 Show the image full screen, not in an album.
	
3.	Touch the Bluetooth icon.
	
	 If you don’t see that icon, tap the touchscreen. If you still don’t see it, 
tap the Share icon (shown in the margin) and choose Bluetooth.
	
4.	Select the Bluetooth printer from the list.
	
5.	If prompted by the printer, confirm that the image upload is okay.
	
	 Not every Bluetooth printer has such a prompt; some just go ahead and 
print the image.

 Chapter 12: Image Madness and Management
Google Cloud Print
The Google Cloud Print option is perhaps the easiest way to print from your 
Galaxy tablet. The problem is that you need four things to make it work:
	
✓	A desktop computer or access to one
	
✓	A printer connected to that computer, either directly or over a network
	
✓	The Google Chrome web browser on that computer
	
✓	The Google Cloud Print app on your tablet
Providing you can wrangle those four items, the next step is to configure 
everything. It works like this:
	
1.	Log into Chrome by using your Google account, the same one you use 
for your tablet.
	
	 Google insists that you do this when you first obtain the Chrome pro-
gram for your computer.
	
2.	In Chrome (on your computer), click the Menu icon in the upper-right 
corner of the window.
	
3.	Still on your computer, choose the Settings command.
	
	 A new browser tab opens, listing Chrome Settings.
	
4.	Click the Show Advanced Settings link.
	
	 The link is at the bottom of the page. After clicking the link, the page 
grows longer with more options and settings.
	
5.	In the Google Cloud Print section, click the Sign in to Google Cloud 
Print button.
	
	 That’s it.
With the computer set up for Google Cloud Print, the next step is to download 
the Google Cloud Print app from the Play Store. General app-downloading 
directions are found in Chapter 15.
After the Cloud Print app is installed on your tablet, you can print from any 
app (not just the Gallery) by following these steps:
	
1.	Touch the Share icon.

The unusual thing with Google Cloud Print is that you don’t need to be in  
the same place as the printer. I’ve printed from the library and other states.  
I could even print a document on my home computer while flying cross- 
country, although I’m too cheap to pay $20 for in-flight Wi-Fi.
Posting a video to YouTube
The best way to share a video is to upload it to YouTube. As a Google account 
holder, you also have a YouTube account. You can use the tablet’s YouTube 
app to upload your videos to the Internet, where everyone can see them and 
make rude comments. Here’s how:
	
1.	Ensure that the Wi-Fi connection is activated.
	
	 The best way to upload a video is to turn on the Wi-Fi connection, which 
doesn’t incur data surcharges like the digital cellular network does. In 
fact, if you opt to use the 4G LTE network for uploading a YouTube video, 
you’ll see a suitable onscreen reminder about data surcharges.
	
2.	Start the Gallery app.
	
3.	Open the video you want to upload.
	
	 You do not need to play the video. Just have it on the screen.
	
4.	Touch the Share icon.
	
	 If you don’t see the Share icon, tap the screen.
	
5.	Choose YouTube.
	
	 The Upload Video window appears, listing all sorts of options and 
­settings for sending the video to YouTube.
	
6.	Type the video’s title.
	
	 Feel free to replace the timestamp title with something more descriptive.
	
7.	Type a description.
	
	 The description appears on YouTube when people go to view the video.
	
8.	Set whether the video is Private, Public, or Unlisted.
	
9.	Touch the Upload button.
	
	 You return to the gallery, and the video is uploaded. The video continues 
to upload even if the tablet falls asleep.
The uploading notification appears while the video is being sent to YouTube. 
When the upload has completed, the notification stops animating and 
becomes the Video Uploaded Successfully icon, as shown in the margin.

167
 Chapter 12: Image Madness and Management
To view your video, open the YouTube app. It’s found on the Apps screen and 
discussed in detail in Chapter 14.
	
✓	YouTube often takes awhile to process a video after it’s uploaded. Allow 
a few minutes to pass (longer for larger videos) before expecting the 
video to be available for viewing.
	
✓	Upload is the official term to describe sending a file from the Galaxy 
tablet to the Internet.
Sharing images with other apps
Just about every app wants to get in on the sharing bit, especially when it 
comes to sharing pictures and videos. The key is to view something in the 
Gallery and then touch the Share icon atop the screen (and shown in the 
margin). From the Share menu, choose an app and that image or video is 
instantly sent to that app.
What happens next?
That depends on the app. For Facebook, Twitter, and other social network-
ing apps, the image is attached to a new post. For Email or Gmail, the image 
or video becomes an attachment. Other apps treat the image in a similar 
manner: It’s made available to the app for sharing, posting, sending, or what 
have you. The key is to look for that Share icon.

✓	Two types of album artwork are used by the Play Music app. For pur-
chased music, the album artwork represents the original album. That 
may also happen for music copied (imported) from your computer. 
Otherwise, the Play Music app slaps down a generic album cover, as 
shown in Figure 13-1.
	
✓	When the tablet can’t recognize an artist, it uses the title Unknown 
Artist. This usually happens with music you copy manually to your 
tablet, but it can apply also to audio recordings you make.
Playing a tune
You listen to music by locating a song in the Play Music app library. From 
the Genres, Artists, or Albums categories, choose an item to open and then 
select a song to listen to. Touching the song title plays the song, as shown in 
Figure 13-2.
While the song plays, you’re free to do anything else on the tablet. In fact, the 
song continues to play even when the tablet is locked or goes to sleep.
After the song has finished playing, the next song in the list plays. The list 
order depends on how you start the song. For example, if you start a song 
from the album view, all songs in that album play in the order listed.
The next song in the list doesn’t play if you have the Shuffle button activated 
(refer to Figure 13-2). In that case, the Play Music app randomly chooses 
another song from the same list. Who knows which one will be next?

Many music-playing, or jukebox, programs are available. On Windows, the 
most common program is Windows Media Player. You can use this program 
to synchronize music between a PC and a tablet. Here’s how it works:
	
1.	Connect the tablet to your PC.
	
	 Use the USB cable that comes with the tablet.
	
	 Over on the PC, an AutoPlay dialog box appears in Windows, prompting 
you to choose how best to mount the Galaxy tablet onto the Windows 
storage system.
	
2.	Close the AutoPlay dialog box.
	
3.	Start Windows Media Player.
	
4.	Click the Sync tab or the Sync toolbar button.
	
	 The Galaxy tablet appears in the Sync list on the right side of Windows 
Media Player, as shown in Figure 13-3.
	
5.	Drag to the Sync area the music you want to transfer to your tablet 
(refer to Figure 13-3).
	
6.	Click the Start Sync button to transfer the music from your PC to  
the tablet.
	
	 The Sync button may be located atop the list, as shown in Figure 13-3, or 
it might be found on the bottom.

Alarm clock duties are the responsibility of the Alarm app, which you’ll find 
on the Apps screen. Its main screen looks similar to what’s shown on the left 
in Figure 14-1. The right side of the figure shows the alarm creation and edit-
ing screen.
You create alarms for the Alarm app by touching the Add (+) icon, shown in 
Figure 14-1. Use the next screen to edit details about the alarm. Set the sched-
ule, sound, name, and other details that appear on the screen. The most impor-
tant thing to set is the date and time. Touch the Save button to save the alarm.
As an example, to set an alarm that wakes you up at 6:45 every morning, 
touch the day icons, Mon through Fri (see Figure 14-1), and then place a 
check mark by Repeat Weekly. Scroll down to the bottom of the screen and 
type a name, such as “Get Outta Bed.” Touch the Save button and the alarm is 
created and set.
The alarm you create appears on the Alarm app’s screen, similar to what’s 
shown in Figure 14-1, left. Any new alarm you create is automatically set — it 
goes off when the proper time approaches. To disable an alarm, touch the 
Alarm Set icon (labeled in Figure 14-1).

Start the Calculator app by choosing its icon from the Apps screen. The 
Calculator appears, as shown in Figure 14-2. When used in a vertical orienta-
tion, the app loses the scary math buttons.
Type your equations using the various buttons on the screen. The paren-
theses button can help you determine which part of a long equation gets 
­calculated first. Use the C button to clear input.
	
✓	Long-press the calculator’s text (or results) to cut or copy the results.
	
✓	I use the Calculator most often to determine my tip at a restaurant. In 
Figure 14-2, a calculation is being made for an 18 percent tip on an $89.56 
tab.
	
✓	If your tablet doesn’t have a Calculator app, you can obtain one from the 
Play Store.
It’s a Calendar
Feel free to take out any datebook you have and throw it away. You never 
need to buy another one again. That’s because your tablet is the ideal date-
book and appointment calendar. Thanks to the Calendar app and the Google 
Calendar feature on the Internet, you can manage all your scheduling right on 
your Galaxy tablet. It’s almost cinchy.

Begin your reading experience by opening the Play Books app. If you’re 
prompted to turn on synchronization, touch the Turn On Sync button.
The Play Books app organizes the books into a library and displays them 
for reading, similar to the way they’re shown in Figure 14-6. The library lists 
any titles you’ve obtained for your Google Books account. Or when you’re 
returning to the Play Books app after a break, you see the current page of the 
e-book you were last reading. You can choose either mode from the sidebar, 
as shown in the figure.
Scroll through the library by swiping the screen.
Touch a book in the Play Books app library to open it. If you’ve opened the 
book previously, you’re returned to the page you last read. Otherwise, the 
first page you see is the book’s first page.
To begin reading, touch a book to open it.
Figure 14-7 illustrates the basic book-reading operation in the Play Books app. 
You turn pages by swiping left or right, but probably mostly left. You can turn 
pages also by touching the far left or right side of the screen.
The Play Books app also works in a vertical orientation, though when you 
turn the tablet that way, only one page is shown at a time.

It’s Google Now
Don’t worry about your Galaxy tablet controlling too much of your life: The 
tablet harbors no insidious intelligence, and the Robot Revolution is still 
years away. Until then, you can use your tablet’s listening capabilities to 
enjoy a feature called Google Now. It’s not quite like having your own per-
sonal Jeeves, but it’s on its way.
Google Now must be activated on your Galaxy Note or Galaxy Tab. To do 
so, start the Google app, found directly on the Apps screen or in the Google 
folder on the Apps screen. Obey the prompts on the screen to obtain Google 
Now. You might have to touch the Get Google Now link first.
Touch the Google app to start Google Now, or perform a Google search by 
using the Google Search widget on the Home screen. A typical Google Now 
screen is shown in Figure 14-8. Below the Search text box, you’ll find cards. 
The variety and number of cards depend on how often you use Google Now. 
The more the app learns about you, the more cards appear.

Touch an app to see details. Touch the Open button to run the app, the 
Update button to update to the latest version, or the Uninstall button to 
remove the app. Later sections in this chapter describe the details on  
updating and uninstalling apps.
	
✓	You can place a check mark by the Allow Automatic Updating option, 
which assists in keeping your apps current. Not every app features auto-
matic updating.
	
✓	Uninstalled apps remain on the All list because you did, at one time, 
download the app. To reinstall them (without paying a second time for 
paid apps), choose the app from the All list and touch the Install button.
Sharing an app
When you love an app so much that you just can’t contain your glee, feel free 
to share that app with your friends. You can easily share a link to the app in 
the Google Play Store by obeying these steps:
	
1.	In the Play Store, select the app to share.
	
	 You can select any app, but you need to be at the app’s details screen, 
the one with the Free or price button.
	
2.	Touch the Share icon.
	
	 A menu appears listing various apps and methods for sharing the app’s 
Play Store link with your pals.
	
3.	Choose a sharing method.
	
	 For example, choose Gmail to send a link to the app in an e-mail 
­message.
	
4.	Use the chosen app to send the link.
	
	 What happens next depends on which sharing method you’ve chosen.
The end result of these steps is that your friend receives a link. That person 
can touch the link on his mobile Android device and be whisked instantly to 
the Google Play Store, where the app can be viewed and installed.
Methods for using the various items on the Share menu are found throughout 
this book.
Updating an app
The Play Store notifies you of new versions of your apps. Whenever a new 
version is available, you see it flagged for updating, as shown in Figure 15-3. 
Updating the app to get the latest version is cinchy.

 Chapter 16: It’s a Wireless Life
Sharing the tablet’s Internet connection is not only possible but also rela-
tively easy. You can go about sharing in one of two ways: The wireless way is 
to create a mobile hotspot; the wired way is to use the tethering technique. 
Both methods are covered in this section.
Creating a mobile hotspot
You can direct your Galaxy tablet to share its digital cellular connection with 
as many as five other wireless gizmos. This process is referred to as creating 
a mobile wireless hotspot, though no heat or fire is involved.
To set up a mobile hotspot with your Galaxy tablet, heed these steps:
	
1.	Turn off the Galaxy tablet’s Wi-Fi radio.
	
	 You can’t be using a Wi-Fi connection when you create a Wi-Fi hotspot. 
Actually, the notion is kind of silly: If the tablet can get a Wi-Fi signal, 
other gizmos can too, so why bother creating a Wi-Fi hotspot in the 
first place?
	
	 See the earlier section “Activating and deactivating Wi-Fi” for informa-
tion on disabling Wi-Fi.
	
2.	If you can, plug in the tablet.
	
	 It’s okay if you don’t find a power outlet, but running a mobile hotspot 
draws a lot of power. The tablet’s battery power drains quickly if you 
can’t plug in.
	
3.	From the Apps screen, open the Settings app.
	
4.	Choose Wi-Fi.
	
	 If you don’t see the Wi-Fi item on the left side of the screen, touch the 
Connections tab.
	
5.	Touch the button by Mobile Hotspot.
	
	 When the button is green, the Mobile Hotspot feature is on.
Additional settings may appear after the Mobile Hotspot feature is activated. 
For example, you may be able to assign a password or change the network’s 
name. Touch the Menu button to view additional items, just in case they 
aren’t displayed directly on the screen.
While the mobile data signal is being shared, other devices can access it via 
their Wi-Fi connections. You can continue to use the tablet while it’s sharing 
the digital cellular connection.
To turn off the mobile hotspot, repeat the steps in this section but disable the 
Mobile Hotspot feature.

	 Touch the Bluetooth item, not the green button. You’ll see a list of avail-
able and paired devices shown in the right side of the screen, similar to 
Figure 16-2. Don’t fret if the device you want doesn’t yet appear in the list.
Figure 16-2: Finding Bluetooth gizmos.
	
6.	If the other device has an option to become visible, select it.
	
	 For example, some Bluetooth gizmos have a tiny button to press that 
makes the device visible to other Bluetooth gizmos. (You don’t need to 
make the Galaxy tablet visible unless you’re accessing it from another 
Bluetooth gizmo.)
	
7.	Touch the Scan button.
	
	 Eventually, the other device should appear on the Bluetooth window, as 
shown in Figure 16-2.
	
8.	Select the device.
	
9.	If necessary, type the device’s passcode or otherwise acknowledge the 
connection.
	
	 Not every device has a passcode. If prompted, acknowledge the pass-
code on the tablet or the other device.
After you acknowledge the passcode (or not), the Bluetooth gizmo and your 
tablet are connected and communicating. You can begin using the device.
Connected devices appear at the bottom of the Bluetooth Settings window, 
under the Paired Devices heading, such as the Photosmart Premium C309g-m 
printer shown in Figure 16-2.

5.	On your computer, type in the web browser’s address box the URL 
listed on your tablet’s touchscreen.
	
	 On my screen, I see the URL http://192.168.1.143:8080. What you 
see will probably be different.
	
	 After typing the URL in your computer’s web browser, you’ll see an 
Access Request prompt on the tablet. The prompt should state the name 
of the computer requesting access.
	
6.	In the proper location on the web page shown on your computer,  
type the PIN listed on the tablet’s touchscreen, and then click the  
OK button.
	
	 The tablet and computer are now connected via the Wi-Fi network.
A web page appears on the computer in the web browser’s window, similar to 
what’s shown in Figure 17-4. That web page is being hosted by your tablet. It 
allows access to the device’s resources, as illustrated in the figure.
Browse the various categories on the web page to explore files and media on 
your tablet.
To download an item, or copy it from the tablet to your computer, click to 
select the item (as shown in Figure 17-4) and then click the Download link. 
The item is transferred to your computer just like any file you download 
from the Internet, although the download comes from your Galaxy Note or 
Galaxy Tab.
To send a file to the tablet, click one of the Upload links, as illustrated in 
Figure 17-4. Click the Choose File button and use the Upload dialog box to 
find a file. Click to select that file, and then click the OK button to send it 
from the computer to the tablet.

✓	See Chapter 14 for more information on the Calendar app.
	
✓	Some airlines feature Android apps you can use while traveling. Find 
those apps by searching for the airline’s name in the Play Store app. You 
can use the apps to not only keep track of flights but also to check in: 
Eventually, printed tickets will disappear, and you’ll merely show your 
“ticket” on the tablet’s touchscreen, which is then scanned at the gate.
Into the Wild Blue Yonder
It truly is the most trendy of things to be aloft with the latest mobile gizmo. 
Like taking a smartphone on a plane, however, you have to follow some rules. 
Although the Galaxy tablet isn’t a smartphone, you still have to heed the 
flight crew’s warnings regarding smartphones.
First and foremost, turn off the Galaxy tablet when instructed to do so. 
Directions are given before takeoff and landing, so be prepared. This rule may 
change in the future, so simply obey the flight crew.
Before takeoff, you’ll most likely want to put the tablet in Airplane mode. Yep, 
it’s the same Airplane mode you see on a smartphone: The various scary 
and dangerous wireless radios on the tablet are disabled in that mode. With 
Airplane mode active, you are free to use the tablet in-flight and face little 
risk of your tablet causing the plane’s navigational equipment to fail and the 
entire flight to end as a fireball over Wyoming.
To enter Airplane mode on the Galaxy tablet, follow these steps just before 
takeoff:
	
1.	Open the Settings app.
	
	 It’s found on the Apps screen, though if you’re an old pro, consider using 
the shortcut found atop the notifications shade.
	
2.	If your tablet’s version of the Settings app features tabs, touch the 
Connections tab.
	
3.	Select the Airplane Mode item. If you don’t see that item, select More 
Settings first.
	
4.	Touch the OK button if prompted.
	
	 The tablet turns off Wi-Fi and Bluetooth if they were on when you first 
activated Airplane mode.
When the tablet is in Airplane mode, a special icon appears in the status area 
at the top of the screen.
And now, for the shortcut: To put the Galaxy tablet into Airplane mode, press 
and hold down the Power button and choose the Airplane Mode command.

Hanging new wallpaper
The Home screen has two types of backgrounds, or wallpapers: traditional 
and live. Live wallpaper is animated. A not-so-live (traditional) wallpaper can 
be any image, such as a picture you’ve taken and stored in the Gallery app.
To set a new wallpaper for the Home screen, obey these steps:
	
1.	Long-press any empty part of the Home screen.
	
	 The empty part doesn’t have a shortcut icon or widget floating on it.
	
	 Upon success, you see the Home Screen menu, shown in Figure 19-1.
	
2.	Choose Set Wallpaper.
	
	 The Set Wallpaper menu appears. You can choose to set wallpaper for 
the Home screen, the Lock screen, or both screens at once.
	
3.	Choose on which screen to set the wallpaper.
	
	 Choose Home Screen or Lock Screen to set separate wallpapers for each 
screen. Choose Home and Lock Screens to set both to the same image.
	
4.	Choose the wallpaper image source.
	
	 Use the Select Wallpaper From menu to select a wallpaper type. You’ll 
find at least three types: 
	
• Gallery: Choose a still image from the Gallery app.
	
• Live Wallpapers: Choose an animated or interactive wallpaper from 
a list.
	
• Wallpapers: Choose a wallpaper from a range of images preinstalled 
on the tablet.
	
	 Additional types may show up, depending on the apps installed on the 
tablet.

Both the Galaxy Note and Galaxy Tab come with a smattering of widgets  
preaffixed to the Home screen, possibly just to show you how they can be 
used. You can place even more widgets on the Home screen by following 
these steps:
	
1.	Touch the Apps icon on the Home screen.
	
2.	Touch the Widgets category atop the screen.
	
	 The widgets appear on the Apps screen in little preview windows. Pay 
attention to their size: Some widgets are bulky and can fit only on fairly 
empty Home screen panels.
	
3.	Scroll the list to find the widget you want to add.
	
4.	Long-press the widget, and drag it to a Home screen panel.
	
	 The widget is plopped on the Home screen, as shown in Figure 19-4.

4.	On the right side of the screen, select Screen Lock.
	
5.	If a secure screen lock is already set, you must trace the pattern or 
input the PIN or password to continue.
The window lists several types of lock settings:
	
✓	Swipe: Unlock the tablet by swiping your finger across the screen. Next 
to not having a lock, this is the least secure lock.
	
✓	Pattern: Trace a pattern on the touchscreen to unlock the tablet.
	
✓	PIN: Unlock the tablet by typing a personal identification number (PIN).
	
✓	Password: Type a password to unlock the tablet.
	
✓	None: The screen doesn’t lock. Choosing this option disables all locks.
Two additional items might also be found on some Galaxy tablets:
	
✓	Face Unlock: Use the tablet’s front camera and your adorable face as the 
unlocking mechanism.
	
✓	Face and Voice: Add a vocal utterance to the face unlock feature, which 
doesn’t make the lock more secure but does make it more interesting.
To set or remove a lock, refer to the following sections.
Removing the screen lock
You use the Screen Lock window not only to place a lock on the tablet but 
also to remove existing locks.
After visiting the Screen Lock window, as described in the preceding section, 
you can choose the None option to remove all screen locks. To restore the 
original screen lock, choose Swipe.
Setting a PIN
Perhaps the most common and (according to the Screen Lock window) the 
second most secure method of locking the tablet is to use a PIN, or personal 
identification number. This type of screen lock is also employed as a backup 
for the less-secure screen unlocking methods.
A PIN lock is a code between 4 and 16 numbers long. It contains only num-
bers, 0 through 9. To set a PIN lock, follow the directions in the earlier section 
“Finding the locks” to reach the Set Screen Lock window. Choose PIN from the 
list of locks.

252
Part IV: Nuts and Bolts 
Use the onscreen keyboard to type your PIN once, and touch the Continue 
button. Type the PIN again to confirm that you know it. Touch OK. The next time 
you turn on or wake up the tablet, you’ll need to type that PIN to get access.
To disable the PIN, reset the security level as described in the preceding section.
Assigning a password
The most secure — and therefore the most arduous — way to lock the tablet 
is to apply a full-on password. Unlike a PIN (refer to the preceding section), a 
password can contain numbers, symbols, and both uppercase and lowercase 
letters.
Set a password by choosing Password from the Screen Lock window; refer 
to the earlier section “Finding the locks” for information on getting to that 
screen. The password you select must be at least four characters long. 
Longer passwords are more secure.
You’re prompted to type the password whenever you unlock the tablet or 
whenever you try to change the screen lock. Touch the OK button to accept 
the password you’ve typed.
Creating an unlock pattern
One of the most common ways to lock a Galaxy tablet is to apply an unlock 
pattern: The pattern must be traced exactly as it was created to unlock the 
device and get access to your apps and other tablet features.
	
1.	Summon the Screen Lock window.
	
	 Refer to the earlier section “Finding the locks.”
	
2.	Choose Pattern.
	
	 If you’ve not yet set a pattern lock, you may see a tutorial describing the 
process; touch the Next button to skip over the dreary directions.
	
3.	Trace an unlock pattern.
	
	 Use Figure 19-7 as your inspiration. You can trace over the dots in any 
order, but you can trace over a dot only once. The pattern must cover at 
least four dots.
	
4.	Touch the Continue button.
	
5.	Redraw the pattern.
	
	 You need to prove to the doubtful tablet that you know the pattern.
	
6.	Touch the Confirm button.
	
7.	Type a PIN to back up the pattern lock in case you forget.
	
	 Specific details on setting a PIN lock are found earlier in this chapter.

To set the face unlock, follow these steps:
	
1.	Get to the Screen Lock window.
	
	 Refer to the earlier section “Finding the locks” for specific directions.
	
2.	Touch the Next button at the warning because you’re not silly enough 
to try to use Face Unlock while you’re driving your car.
	
3.	Choose Face Unlock.
	
	 In the directions on the screen that you probably didn’t read, it says that 
Face Unlock is less secure than other forms of locking the phone. But it’s 
fun, so what the heck?
	
4.	Touch the Set It Up button.
	
5.	Hold up the tablet so that it’s facing you at eye level — as though you 
were using it as a mirror.
	
6.	Touch the Continue button.
	
7.	Line up your face with the oval dots on the screen, and then hold the 
tablet steady as the dots change from white to green.
	
8.	Upon success, touch the Continue button.
	
9.	Choose Pattern or PIN to set a backup lock for those frequent times 
that Face Unlock fails.
	
	 Refer to later sections in this chapter for how to set up these types of 
locks.
	
10.	After confirming the pattern or PIN lock, touch the OK button.
	
	 Face Unlock is now ready for action.
Delaying the screen lock
The lock screen shows up right away whenever 
you unlock your tablet. It shows up also after 
a sleep timeout or a period of inactivity. When 
that happens, the touchscreen automatically 
turns off and the tablet locks. You can control 
the timeout delay for the screen lock as well as 
whether the tablet locks automatically when 
you press the Power Lock key.
To see the screen lock timeout delay, get to 
the Lock Screen window: Open the Settings 
app and choose the Lock Screen category (if 
necessary, touch the Device tab first). Choose 
the Lock Automatically option to set how long 
the touchscreen waits to lock after the tablet 
has a sleep timeout. This option appears only 
when a secure screen lock is set, so if you don’t 
see it, first set a secure lock. The value can be 
adjusted from 0 to 30 minutes.
Both the Galaxy Note and Galaxy Tab are con-
figured to immediately lock the screen when-
ever the Power Lock key is pressed. To change 
this option, remove the check mark by the Lock 
Instantly with Power Key item, also found in 
the Lock Screen window. (This option appears 
only when a secure screen lock is set.) With 
this option off, the tablet uses the sleep timeout 
value to specify when the lock screen kicks in.




258
Part IV: Nuts and Bolts 
Changing visual settings
Probably the key thing you want to adjust visually on the Galaxy tablet is 
screen brightness. This task is deftly handled by swiping down the notifica-
tions shade: Adjust the Brightness slider right (brighter) or left (dimmer).
You can also touch the Auto button next to the slider to have the tablet auto-
matically adjust its brightness based on the ambient light.
Brightness can be set also by using the Settings app: Select the Display cat-
egory on the left side of the screen. (If you don’t see that category, touch the 
Device tab.) Choose Brightness.
Another item worthy of note is the Screen Timeout setting. Select this item to 
see the Screen Timeout menu, from which you can set the inactivity duration, 
after which the Galaxy tablet touchscreen turns itself off. I prefer a value of 1 
Minute.
	
✓	The Timeout setting is the setting that the tablet uses to automatically 
lock itself.
	
✓	See Chapter 3 for more information on Quick Settings.

To add a lock screen widget, heed these directions:
	
1.	Open the Settings app.
	
	 It’s found on the Apps screen.
	
2.	Choose the Device category from the top of the screen.
	
	 Don’t sweat if you don’t see that category; not every Settings app  
features the category tabs.
	
3.	On the left side of the Settings app screen, select Lock Screen.
	
4.	Select the Multiple Widgets item.
	
	 That’s it.
Normally you’d be disappointed at this point because you don’t see the lock 
screen brimming with widgets. Silly. You have to add them. To do that, you 
need to first lock the tablet.
Lock the tablet.
Unlock the tablet, but on the lock screen, swipe the Clock widget (it’s really a 
widget) to one side or the other. You’ll see a large plus icon. Touch that plus 
icon, and then choose a lock screen widget from the displayed list, such as 
Calendar, Gmail, Digital Clock, or what-have-you.
	
✓	Multiple widgets can be placed on the lock screen, though you can see 
only one at a time. Swipe the screen to see others.
	
✓	To remove a lock screen widget, long-press it. Drag the widget up to the 
Remove icon and it’s gone. You can even remove the Clock widget, in 
which case only the large plus icon appears on the lock screen.
Smart Screen Tricks
Some Galaxy tablets feature a slew of Smart Screen tricks. These tricks 
greatly increase your fear of the device by making it frighteningly smarter 
than you would otherwise think.
Ensure that the Smart Screen repertoire of tricks is active by visiting the 
Settings app. Select the Controls category, and then touch the Smart Screen 
item on the left side of the screen. You’ll behold four basic Smart Screen actions:
	
✓	Smart Stay: This item directs the tablet not to dim the screen or auto-
matically lock as long as you’re looking at the screen.
	
✓	Smart Rotation: This item keeps the screen oriented in relation to your 
face. It’s perfect for watching movies or reading in bed.

Add Shortcuts to the Home Screen
Don’t bother looking: You won’t find a something called a “shortcut” to add 
to the Home screen. Older versions of the Android operating system had 
such a feature. Today, you apply shortcut widgets instead.
For example, say you desire a Bluetooth shortcut icon on the Home screen. 
You can use that icon to turn the Bluetooth radio on or off. Here’s how to add 
that shortcut, which is really a widget:
	
1.	Touch the Apps icon to visit the Apps screen.
	
2.	Choose the Widgets category.
	
3.	Choose the Settings Shortcut widget.
	
	 It’s way over there on the left, although not every tablet may have this 
widget.
	
4.	Apply the widget to the Home screen.
	
	 Specific directions are provided in Chapter 19.
	
5.	Choose an action for the widget by selecting an item from the  
scrolling menu.
	
	 In this case, you could choose the Bluetooth item to create a Bluetooth 
settings shortcut on the Home screen.
The shortcut icon provides a direct link to a specific entry in the Settings 
app. So although the shortcut doesn’t turn something on or off, it quickly 
gets you to the screen that does so.
Another popular Home screen shortcut is a contact shortcut: Repeat Steps 1 
and 2 but choose the Contact widget in Step 3. Continue working Step 4,  
but in Step 5 you choose a specific person from the tablet’s address book.  
To use the shortcut, touch the widget; you’ll see information about that  
contact.
Add Spice to Dictation
I feel that too few people use dictation, despite how handy it can be. Whether 
or not you use it, you might notice that it occasionally censors some of the 
words you utter. Perhaps you’re the kind of person who won’t put up with 
that kind of s***.

277
 Chapter 21: Ten Tips, Tricks, and Shortcuts
Relax, b******. You can lift the vocal censorship ban by following these 
steps:
	
1.	At the Home screen, touch the Apps icon.
	
2.	Open the Settings app.
	
3.	Choose the Controls tab, if you see it on the Settings app screen.
	
	 Not every Settings app uses the tabs across the top of the screen.
	
4.	On the left side of the screen, select Language and Input.
	
	
5.	Touch the Settings icon next to Google Voice Typing.
	
6.	Deselect the Block Offensive Words option.
And just what are offensive words? I would think that censorship would be an 
offensive word. But no, apparently the words s***, c***, and even innocent 
little old a****** are deemed offensive by Google Voice. What the h***?
Command the Tablet with Your Voice
I just tried this trick for my son, and he was really impressed. On my Galaxy 
tablet, I touched the Microphone icon on the Home screen’s Google Search 
widget. I uttered, “Phone Obama.” In less than five seconds, the tablet started 
the Skype app and phoned the White House.
Chapter 14 covers the Google Now feature, which is really the heart of this 
trick: The Google Search widget on the Home screen hooks you into the Google 
Search or Google Now app. Once started, you can bark out various commands.
What makes the “Phone Obama” command work, however, are two things. 
First, I have President Obama in my tablet’s address book. No, I don’t know him 
personally; I just always keep the current US president in my address book.
Second, I have the Skype app installed. Skype is covered in Chapter 9. Both 
apps — Google Now and Skype — work tougher on the tablet to carry out 
voice commands.
You can try similar tricks as well. Say, “Watch a video” or “Send e-mail to 
someone” or “Go to address/map location.” The tablet is uncanny.
Use the Galactic TV Remote
I didn’t point it out back in Chapter 1, but located on your tablet’s edge is an 
infrared remote. It’s a dark, glassy area about the size of a grain of rice. You can 
use that infrared hardware and the WatchON app as a super genius TV remote.

278
Part V: The Part of Tens 
This is an order: Go into your TV room with your Galaxy Note or Galaxy Tab. 
Sit down in front of the TV. Start the WatchON app and follow the directions 
on the screen. Configure the app to match your local cable or satellite pro-
vider. Set up your TV set based on its brand name.
Eventually, you’ll be able to use the tablet running the WatchON app as your 
TV remote, but that’s only a minor trick. The big deal is the program guide 
that appears on the screen, such as the one shown in Figure 21-1.
Scan for TVs
Display remote
Figure 21-1: The Galactic TV Remote app.
As long as the tablet is pointing at the TV, you can touch a show on the screen 
to instantly switch to that channel on your TV. Or use the remote feature (refer 
to Figure 21-1) to control the TV’s volume or manually cruise the channels.
Enter Location Information for Your Events
When you create an event for the Calendar app, remember to enter the 
event location. You can type either an address (if you know it) or the name 
of the location. The key is to type the text as you would type it in the Maps 
app when searching for a location. That way, you can touch the event loca-
tion and the tablet displays it on the touchscreen. Finding an appointment 
couldn’t be easier.


280
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Check Your Data Usage
Whether you have a Wi-Fi–only Galaxy tablet or one that can also access the 
mobile data network, you can use the Data Usage screen to check Internet 
activity and even control how much data is sent and received.
To visit the Data Usage screen, open the Settings app and choose Data Usage, 
which is found in the Connections tab if your tablet’s Settings app features 
tabs. You’ll see a graph charting data usage over time. Cellular tablets also 
feature red and orange limit bars, which you can adjust to set warnings when 
your mobile data usage gets too close to your monthly limit.
To review network access for a specific app, select it from the list. You’ll see 
an overlay of the app’s data usage, as well as a delicious pie chart. If you 
notice that the app is using more data than it should, touch the View App 
Settings button. You may be able to adjust some of the settings to curtail 
unintended Internet access.

 Chapter 22: Ten Things to Remember
Lock the Orientation
It’s nice to be able to rotate the tablet, alternating between portrait and land-
scape orientations. Some apps look good one way; others the other way. The 
orientation lock feature prevents the apps from switching when you don’t 
want them to: The screen stays fixed in whichever orientation it was in when 
you set the orientation lock.
To set the orientation lock, pull down the notifications shade. In the Quick 
Settings area, locate the Screen Rotation item. Touch it to lock orientation. 
Touch it again to unlock.
See Chapter 3 for more information about the Quick Settings.
Use the Keyboard Suggestions
Don’t forget to take advantage of the suggestions that appear above the 
onscreen keyboard when you’re typing text. In fact, you may not even need  
to type much text at all: Just keep choosing a word from the list presented. 
It’s fast.
To ensure that suggestions are enabled, follow these steps:
	
	 1.	Open the Settings app.
	
	 2.	On the left side of the screen, select Language and Input.
	
	 You may need to choose the Control tab atop the screen so that you can 
find the Language and Input item.
	
	 3.	Touch the Settings icon to the right of the Samsung Keyboard entry.
	
	 The icon is found on the right side of the screen, similar to the one 
shown in the margin.
	
	 4.	Ensure that the on-off icon that appears by the Predictive Text option 
is green, or on.
Also refer to Chapter 4 for additional information on using the keyboard 
­suggestions.

Yes, it’s okay to have more than one web browser app on your tablet.
Because Chrome is a Google invention, it plays well with other Google apps 
and services. If you have and use Chrome as your computer web browser, 
Chrome on your tablet will be familiar to you. Not only that, Chrome on your 
tablet coordinates your bookmarks, forms, and maybe even passwords on 
various websites. It can be a handy feature — but, again, only when you use 
Chrome as your computer’s web browser.
Google Finance
The Google Finance app is an excellent market-tracking tool for those of us 
who are obsessed with the stock market or want to keep an eye on our  
portfolios. The app offers you an overview of the market and updates to your 
stocks as well as links to financial news.
To get the most from this app, configure Google Finance on the web, using 
your computer. You can create a list of stocks to watch, which is then 
instantly synchronized with your Galaxy tablet. Visit Google Finance on  
the web at www.google.com/finance.
As with other Google services, Google Finance is provided to you for free, as 
part of your Google account.
Google Gesture Search
The Gesture Search app provides a new way to find information on your 
tablet. Rather than use a keyboard or dictate, you simply draw on the 
­touchscreen the first letter of whatever you’re searching for.
Start the Gesture Search app to begin a search. Use your finger to draw a big 
letter on the screen. After you draw a letter, search results appear on the 
screen. Touch a search result or continue drawing more letters to refine  
the search.
Gesture Search can find contacts, music, apps, and bookmarks in the  
Chrome app.
Movies by Flixster
The Movies by Flixster app is your Galaxy tablet’s gateway to Hollywood. It 
lists currently running films and films that are opening, and it has links to 
your local theaters with showtimes and other information. The app is also 

289
 Chapter 23: Ten Great Apps
tied into the popular Rotten Tomatoes website for reviews and feedback. If 
you enjoy going to the movies, you’ll find the Movies app a valuable addition 
to your tablet’s app library.
Netflix
It’s not the big screen. It’s not even the little screen (which I’m guessing is 
TV), but it’s still something to watch. The Netflix app gives you access to a 
streaming library full of television and movies. You can hook up the head-
phones, turn on the tablet, and sit back and enjoy your favorite show or a 
flick from the golden era of Hollywood.
The Netflix app is free, but to get the most from it you need a subscription to 
Netflix’s streaming video service. The subscription doesn’t cost much, plus 
the Galaxy tablet can count as one of the three devices you can use to access 
your Netflix account. So you can still watch on the TV or the computer while 
you enjoy taking movies with you anywhere.
Notepad
The Galaxy Note comes with the S Memo app, which I suppose you could 
work on a Galaxy tablet by using your finger instead of the S Pen. Never mind! 
When you need to jot down a quick note and don’t mind using the onscreen 
keyboard (or dictation), get the Notepad app, also known as GO Notepad.
For example, before a recent visit to the hardware store, I made (dictated) a 
list of items I needed by using Notepad. I also keep some important items as 
notes — things that I often forget or don’t care to remember, such as frequent 
flyer numbers, my dress shirt and suit size (like I ever need that info), and 
other important notes I might need handy but don’t want cluttering my brain.
Sky Map
Ever look up into the night sky and say, “What the heck is that?” Unless it’s a 
bird, an airplane, a satellite, or a UFO, the Sky Map can help you find what it 
is. You may discover that a particularly bright star in the sky is, in fact, the 
planet Jupiter.
The Sky Map app is elegant. It basically turns the tablet into a window you 
can look through to identify things in the night sky. Just start the app and 
hold the Galaxy tablet up to the sky. Pan the tablet to identify planets, stars, 
and constellations.

About the Author
Dan Gookin has been writing about technology for over 25 years. He com-
bines his love of writing with his gizmo fascination to create books that are 
informative, entertaining, and not boring. Having written over 140 titles with 
12 million copies in print translated into over 30 languages, Dan can attest 
that his method of crafting computer tomes seems to work.
Perhaps his most famous title is the original DOS For Dummies, published in 
1991. It became the world’s fastest-selling computer book, at one time moving 
more copies per week than the New York Times number-one bestseller 
(though, as a reference, it could not be listed on the Times’ Best Sellers list). 
That book spawned the entire line of For Dummies books, which remains a 
publishing phenomenon to this day.
Dan’s most popular titles include PCs For Dummies, Word For Dummies, 
Laptops For Dummies, and Android Phones For Dummies. He also maintains 
the vast and helpful website www.wambooli.com.
Dan holds a degree in Communications/Visual Arts from the University of 
California, San Diego. He lives in the Pacific Northwest, where he enjoys 
spending time with his sons playing video games indoors while they enjoy 
the gentle woods of Idaho.
