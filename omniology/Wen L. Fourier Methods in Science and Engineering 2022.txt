Fourier Methods in Science 
and Engineering
This innovative book discusses and applies the generalized Fourier Series to 
a variety of problems commonly encountered within science and engineering, 
equipping the readers with a clear pathway through which to use the Fourier 
methods as a solution technique for a wide range of differential equations and 
boundary value problems.
Beginning with an overview of the conventional Fourier series theory, this 
book introduces the generalized Fourier series (GFS), emphasizing its notable 
rate of convergence when compared to the conventional Fourier series expan­
sions. After systematically presenting the GFS as a powerful and unified solution 
method for ordinary differential equations and partial differential equations, this 
book expands on some representative boundary value problems, diving into their 
multiscale characteristics.
This book will provide readers with the comprehensive foundation necessary 
for solving a wide spectrum of mathematical problems key to practical applica­
tions. It will also be of interest to researchers, engineers, and college students in 
various science, engineering, and mathematics fields.

Preface
This book is intended for researchers, engineers, and college students who are 
interested in numerical and mathematical methods for solving differential equa­
tions and boundary value problems encountered in various scientific and engi­
neering disciplines. Since the readers are expected to be familiar with Fourier 
series, advanced calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, and mathemati­
cal physics methods, the relevant knowledge, if needed, is only briefly reviewed 
for sake of totality. Instead, the attentions are mostly focused on the content which 
best represents the distinguishing features of this book, also the cultivation of 
our many years of combined research and experience with the subject matters. 
While we strive to write this book as rigorously and concisely as possible, certain 
parts may still be considered too advanced or exhaustive to some readers. In our 
humble opinion, the current theories, algorithms, and implementation procedures 
can be better comprehended through applications in the form of term, research 
or practical projects with varying degrees of challenges, which, in the meantime, 
provide ample opportunities for expanding and furthering some aspects of the 
described mathematical framework.

Introduction
The interactions of computer technology, numerical methods, natural science, and 
engineering have led to a new discipline – computational science. Computational 
science is devoted to the development of computer technology-based algorithms 
and software to solve a wide spectrum of scientific and engineering problems. 
The capacities potentially offered by computer technology and the demands from 
various industries and scientific sectors have been driving computational science 
into an unprecedented opportunity of growth. It can be said that the impressive 
achievements of computational science have already made computer simulations, 
together with physical experimenting and theoretical analysis, the three pillars 
of scientific and engineering investigations, and continue to play a critical role in 
promoting the advancements of science and technology.
The analysis methods in computational science can often be divided into 
analytical methods and numerical methods. The former is typically adopted in 
mathematical physics in which a specific solution algorithm is derived for each 
type of differential equations or boundary conditions. An analytical method 
is usually more suitable for parametric study of a physical phenomenon or 
process, and understanding its behaviors. In practice, the analytical methods 
can not only save a lot of computational time, but also facilitate assessing the 
influences on the results of the particular parameters of interest. However, the 
use of an analytical method is seriously limited by its stringent requirements 
on the shapes of the solution domains, the load conditions, the boundary con­
ditions, or some other factors. In contrast, the numerical methods, such as, 
the finite difference methods, the finite element methods, the boundary ele­
ment methods, and other discretization-based methods can better cope with 
these practical difficulties and complexities, and have been extensively used 
in almost all engineering and scientific fields for several decades (Zienkiewicz 
and Taylor 2000).
1.1  SCALES AND SCALE EFFECTS
Scale often refers to the spatial or temporal unit used in describing a physical 
event, or can be broadly understood as the scope and frequency of an object, phe­
nomenon, or process in space and time.
The division of matter scales in the universe is usually made in an absolute 
sense, such as the use of the macroscopic (0.1 mm), microscopic (0.1 nm ~ 1 nm), 
and mesoscopic (1 nm ~ 100 nm) trichotomy. In comparison, the division of sci­
entific scales is relatively more flexible: each scientific field may have its own 
material scales defined in accordance with the specific research scope, subject 
matters, and other concerns.

Fourier Methods in Science and Engineering
The limit scale for human activities has stretched out magnificently in the past 
century. In the direction of large-scale, with the inventions of, such as satellites, space 
shuttles, and space telescopes, mankind has laid their eyes onto the deeper space 
of the boundless universe; in the meantime, in the direction of micro scale, arti­
ficial superlattices, nano-materials, Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS), 
­biochips and other technologies have taken our attentions to the mesoscopic world.
With expanding scientific limit scales, the scale effects have become increasingly 
evident and important. For example, on the mesoscopic scale, since the specific sur­
face area of a material is very large, the surface tension, electrostatic force, bonding 
force, magnetic force, and the likes can all emerge as important factors which may 
be administered to modify the physical and chemical properties of the material.
The flow and heat transfer laws under micro scale can also deviate signifi­
cantly from those under normal (macro) scale conditions. For example, in micro 
scale, heat conduction is often accompanied by the wave and radiation effects, 
and the thermal conductivity is greatly reduced. In micro scale convective heat 
transfer, the compressibility of fluid, especially gas, the surface effect of liquid 
and the rarefaction effect of the gas all need to be taken into account. On the 
micro scale, the thermal radiation is not only related to the phonon free path, but 
also dependent upon the photon wavelength and photon interference scale.
Similarly, the microminiaturization process of machinery also faces the issues 
of scale effects, such as the dependence of micro friction and micro lubrication 
mechanisms on the scale of micro machinery, the restriction of heat transfer and 
combustion on the micromechanical scale, etc.
The upsurges of scale effect studies and experimental verifications have 
spanned from the traditional fields of physics, chemistry, material science, engi­
neering, machinery manufacturing into other scientific and social disciplines 
such as geography, ecology, environment, meteorology, economics, and informa­
tion technologies.
1.2  MULTISCALE PHENOMENA AND 
MULTISCALE ANALYSIS METHODS
Recently, multiscale problems in science and engineering have attracted consider­
able attentions (Oden et al. 2003). The spatial, material, and/or physical param­
eters in a multiscale problem can vary easily by orders of magnitude, resulting 
in the appearance of boundary layers or other forms of local discontinuities with 
large gradients in the solution region (Onate 2003). In solving for multiscale prob­
lems, the traditional analysis methods tend to have the shortcomings of ineffec­
tiveness and low accuracy. Therefore, renovating the traditional methods to make 
them better fit for solving multiscale problems has become a hot topic nowadays.
Solving multiscale problems often requires us to first have a good understand­
ing of the scale dependences of the involved phenomena or processes, and define 
the appropriate scales accordingly. Of equal importance, we also need to pay 
attention to the scale coupling characteristics and skillfully deal with the prob­
lems concerning scale transformation and scale integration.

Introduction
Here, our attention is specifically focused on a class of multiscale problems in 
which some interesting features such as local defects or abrupt changes of some 
physical variables are potentially embedded in an event primarily described on a 
larger scale. Such a situation will typically involve at least two scales: a smaller 
scale to resolve the local behavior, and a larger scale to capture the macroscopic 
characteristic of the event.
The multiscale coupling provides a new perspective to understand the com­
plexity of a physical phenomenon or process. For example, the complex flow pat­
terns formed by turbulence can be regarded as the result of vortex interactions on 
different scales. When the physical mechanisms are similar on different scales, 
the so-called similarity solution method is formulated for the multiscale phenom­
enon. When the coupling is considered weak at different scales, the small param­
eter perturbation method is more suitable. It is the hybrid use of the similarity 
solution method and small parameter perturbation method that has overcome the 
major hurdles such as boundary layer simulations in aerospace. By fully recog­
nizing the diversity and the strong coupling of physical mechanisms on different 
scales, fluid turbulence research has entered a new era (Wang et al. 2004).
Multiscale phenomena are also prevalent in scientific and engineering simula­
tions. In 1995, Hughes studied the external field problem of the Helmholtz equa­
tion from the perspective of near-field and far-field multiscale coupling (Hughes 
1995). To this end, he first artificially selects a closed surface (such as a spherical 
surface), then the infinite solution domain can be decomposed into the near field 
(the area between the inner boundary and the selected closed surface) and the 
far field (region outside the selected closed surface). The near-field region can be 
regarded as a small scale and solved by using conventional numerical methods 
(such as finite element method). The far-field region is considered as a large scale, 
and the conventional numerical method is no longer suitable; instead, an analyti­
cal method (the Green’s function method) is adopted. The near-field scale and far-
field scale are then coupled together via the boundary conditions enforced on the 
interface (that is, the selected spherical surface), leading to a multiscale coupling 
phenomenon.
The solution space, which involves the scale coupling, via a differential 
equation, and/or its corresponding boundary/compatibility conditions, between 
the subspaces with different scales, also represents a familiar multiscale phenom­
enon in scientific and engineering simulations. The coupling between the sub-
regions with different scales in the solution region, and the coupling between 
subspaces corresponding to different scales constitute two typical manifestations 
of multiscale phenomena in science and engineering. Multiscale phenomena are 
frequently associated with:
1.	Boundary layer problems with convection-diffusion-reaction equation;
2.	Singular perturbation problems;
3.	Intermediate faults in the fracture processes of concrete, rock and soil 
materials;
4.	Fluid turbulence;

4
Fourier Methods in Science and Engineering
5.	Shear bands in solids;
6.	Shock waves of compressible fluids;
7.	Compressible, incompressible solid or fluid conversion problems.
Many techniques, such as the stabilized finite element methods (SFEMs), the 
bubble function methods, the multiscale finite element methods, the wavelet finite 
element methods, the meshless methods, the variational multiscale methods, have 
been proposed to better cope with one or more aspects of the multiscale charac­
teristics (Donea and Huerta 2003), and have spurred a wave of research activities 
related to the multiscale analysis methods.
SFEM was originally proposed to solve multiscale problems in fluid dynam­
ics (such as convection-diffusion equation and Stokes equation). Its basic idea is 
to introduce a stabilizing term into the Galerkin’s weak formulation. The stabiliz­
ing term is the weighted residual of the differential equation to be solved on each 
element. The uses of different weighting functions will potentially have diverse 
effects, hence leading to the various versions of the SFEMs.
SFEMs have been successfully applied to a spectrum of scientific and engineer­
ing problems such as the convection-diffusion equation (Agarwal and Pinsky 1996), 
the convection-diffusion-reaction equation (Huerta and Donea 2002), the Stokes 
equation (Bochev et al. 2007), Darcy equation (Burman and Hansbo 2007), the 
generalized Stokes equation (Araya et al. 2008), Navier-Stokes equation (Whiting 
and Jansen 2001), incompressible flows (Codina 2001), viscoplastic flow problem 
(Maniatty and Liu 2003), plate and shell stability problems (Bischoff and Bletzinger 
2004), and fluid-structure interactions (Thompson and Sankar 2001).
The bubble function methods represent another popular approach in solving 
multiscale problems in which special forms of bubble functions are employed to 
expand the finite element interpolation space. In the process, the proper selec­
tion of the bubble functions is critically important to ensuring the accuracy and 
stability of the resulting solution. The bubble function methods have demon­
strated certain successes in solving the Helmholtz equation (Franca et al. 1997), 
the convection-diffusion equation (Sangalli 2004), the diffusion-reaction equa­
tion (Parvazinia and Nassehi 2007), the Navier-Stokes equation (Canuto et al. 
1998), the Stokes equation (Franca and Oliveira 2003), the Brinkman equation 
(Parvazinia et al. 2006), etc.
Wavelet analysis is hailed as “digital microscope” with the multiscale and 
multi-resolution functionalities. Introducing wavelets as the interpolation func­
tions into the traditional finite element solutions has led to another general type of 
multiscale solution methods, wavelet finite element methods, in science and engi­
neering (Dahmen et al. 1997). The wavelet finite element methods can adaptively 
adjust to analysis scales, which tends to facilitate a better solution in terms of the 
numerical stability, efficiency and accuracy. In the last two decades, the wavelet 
finite element methods have emerged as a promising approach for solving various 
singularity and multiscale problems.
Most multiscale methods are built upon the existing numerical meth­
ods by considering a specific scale coupling characteristic of a multiscale

Introduction
phenomenon, or by integrating one or more suitable corrections into the cor­
responding solution scheme to strike a delicate balance between, such as accu­
racy and efficiency. More explicitly, since the existing multiscale methods still 
fall within the framework of the discretization-based solutions, they will inevi­
tably inherit some, if not all, of their shortcomings such as high computational 
cost, comparatively low accuracy of high order derivatives of the field vari­
ables, and the difficulties with isolating out the influences of a specific model 
parameter on the results of concern. Thus, in order to utterly resolve these 
problems, we need to walk out the comfort zone outlined by the conventional 
approaches and explore for new paths for the groundbreaking advancements of 
the multiscale solution methods.
Computational science may still be at its primary stage of development. 
Insightfully revealing and simulating multiscale phenomena, although currently 
considered out of the reach, have already posted monumental challenges to 
computational science and computer technology for many years or even decades 
ahead.
A powerful multiscale solution method needs to have the following technical 
merits:
1.	Feasibility: The traditional solution methods are typically only suitable 
for single-scale phenomena. However, when they are applied to multi­
scale problems, we will immediately face a dilemma: on the one hand, 
if a larger calculation scale is selected, the detailed information carried 
by the smaller scale tends to be lost in the solution process, which can 
adversely affect the accuracy and reliability of the results; on the other 
hand, if a smaller calculation scale is used, although the finer details 
can be recovered, the required computer memory and CPU time will 
become unreasonably high, or even technically impossible. Therefore, it 
becomes an inevitable trend to integrate the different scales into a single 
multiscale solution scheme to ease the struggle between computational 
accuracy and efficacy (Masud and Khurram 2004).
2.	Efficacy: Accuracy, efficiency, and effectiveness of a given analysis 
method may be found sensitive to some model parameters. For a multi­
scale problem, there typically exist more such model parameters which 
vary in wider ranges and hence can affect the solution in more drastic 
ways. Therefore, a comprehensive use of the validation and verification 
methodologies has become an integral part of consistently improving the 
efficacy of a multiscale method.
3.	Accuracy: For a multiscale phenomenon, the scale coupling effects can 
make the calculation errors be transferred from the larger scale to the 
smaller scale, which are often exhibited as violent oscillations, large gra­
dients or near-singularities in a very small region. Therefore, there is a 
genuine need for the correct capture and comprehensive characterization 
of the multiscale structures in the solution domain in order to increase 
the accuracy and reliability of the corresponding multiscale technique.

Fourier Methods in Science and Engineering
1.3  FOURIER SERIES METHODS IN SCIENTIFIC 
AND ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS
Since the creation of calculus in the late 17th century, most scientific and engineer­
ing problems have been formulated in terms of differential equations (especially, 
partial differential equations) with corresponding boundary conditions. In 1807, in 
studying the heat conduction problem, Fourier expressed the temperature field in 
an object as a trigonometric series (often called as Fourier series nowadays), and 
separated the heat conduction equation into different parts according to the physi­
cal conditions (or formally, the method of separation of variables). The integration 
of the trigonometric series expansion and the separation of variables has led to a 
useful analysis method – Fourier series method. The Fourier series method has 
offered a simple approach for solving a variety of linear partial differential equa­
tions such as wave equations, diffusion equations, Laplace equation, etc.
The method of separation of variables  has a long history, and its origin 
can be traced back to the study of string vibrations in the 18th century, which 
attracted the attentions of such mathematical giants as Euler, d’Alembert, Taylor, 
Bernoulli, Laplace, Lagrange, to name a few. In 1750, based on Taylor’s results, 
d’Alembert first proposed the idea of separation of variables, and derived the solu­
tion as the linear combination of the eigenfunctions of the string equation. Later 
Bernoulli extended the eigenfunction solution to the initial value problem, which 
was questioned by Euler and Lagrange. Fourier is recognized as the pioneer of the 
Fourier series method for his prominent contribution of expressing the solution 
as an infinite series of the trigonometric functions to satisfy the initial conditions. 
However, the whole theory of Fourier series surprisingly took more than a cen­
tury to be accomplished.
Although the method of separation of variables is widely discussed in mathe­
matical physics as a primary means for solving various boundary value problems, 
its applications are typically limited to the cases when the partial differential 
equations are linear and homogeneous, and the boundary conditions are homo­
geneous as well. When a complete system of eigenfunctions is used to expand 
the solutions, the process of solving the boundary value problems is simplified to 
seeking a set of expansion coefficients to specially satisfy the differential equa­
tion and/or boundary conditions. It is important to point out that such a solution or 
solution process is valid only when the convergence and effectiveness of the series 
solution can be confirmed a priori or verified a posteriori.
In comparison with the method of separation of variables, the application 
scope of the Fourier series method is even smaller due to the concerns about the 
differentiability and convergence of the series solutions. Since its early successes 
in solving heat conductions and string vibrations, the most influential applica­
tions of the Fourier series method are probably associated with Navier solution 
for the elastic bending of thin plates with simply supported boundary conditions 
(Timoshenko and Woinowsky-Krieger 1959), and Levy solution for the plates 
with two opposite edges being simply supported and the others arbitrarily sup­
ported (Leissa 1993). It can be said that the applications of the Fourier series

Introduction
method in its original form are still severely hampered by its picky choice of only 
particular types of boundary conditions.
Nevertheless, because the trigonometric functions have certain desired charac­
teristics such as, orthogonality, completeness, simplicity, and numerical stability, 
researchers have never ceased to pursue transforming the Fourier series method 
into a general means for solving a wide range of boundary value problems. Some 
of recent progresses include, such as: the superposition method by decomposing 
the boundary conditions into several suitable ones (Gorman 1982), direct Fourier 
series method with Stokes transformations (Wang and Lin 1996; Chaudhuri 
2002; Kabir et al. 2007), analytical form of Fourier series method (Huang 1992; 
Sun and Yang 1998; Sun et al. 2004), the modified Fourier series method with 
supplementary terms (Li 2000; Li et al. 2009; Jin et al. 2015).
1.4  SCOPE OF THIS BOOK
Development of accurate and effective multiscale analysis methods is still a hot 
research topic in computational science. By aiming at developing a general and 
effective (multiscale) Fourier series method for solving a wide spectrum of bound­
ary value problems in science and engineering, our attentions are here specifically 
focused on formulating systematic solution algorithms which are substantially 
different from the existing discretization-based numerical models. This goal will 
be achieved in three steps: (1) understanding the convergence characteristics of 
and other related issues with the traditional Fourier series solutions; (2) develop­
ing strategies, solution algorithms, and implementation procedures to effectively 
address these issues; and (3) applying the proposed solution method to various sci­
entific and engineering problems to demonstrate and validate its reliability, effec­
tiveness, and, in particular, multiscale capability. Accordingly, this book consists 
of three major topics.
The first one is focused on the fundamental theories about the Fourier series 
expansions and some of their modified versions. In Chapter 2, the basic knowl­
edge is briefly reviewed, including: the continuity of a function, the concepts of 
periodic extensions, the relations between the smoothness of a periodic function 
and the convergence of its Fourier series expansions, etc. The rules about the inte­
gration and differentiations of the Fourier series are also discussed with sufficient 
details. In Chapter 3, a convergence acceleration scheme and a few corresponding 
forms of Fourier series expansions are described for a function defined on a com­
pact interval. Specifically, a suitable supplementary function is incorporated into 
the original function to force the residual function to have the desired mathemati­
cal characteristics. The rapid convergence of the resulting Fourier series is dem­
onstrated using examples. In Chapter 5, the Stokes transformation is employed to 
derive the recursive relations between the Fourier coefficients for the derivatives 
of different orders. The sufficient conditions are then established for the term-
by-term differentiation of the Fourier series of a function to obtain its counter­
part for the derivative of any order. Similar formulas and theorems are presented

in Chapter 6 for two-dimensional cases, even though the corresponding results 
become much more complicated.
The second topic involves establishing a mathematical framework for expanding 
a sufficiently smooth function into the generalized Fourier series, and subsequently 
developing it into a general means for solving linear (partial) differential equa­
tions with arbitrary boundary conditions. In Chapter 4, the generalized Fourier 
series method is specifically applied to the Euler-Bernoulli beam problems with an 
emphasis on the procedures of determining the suitable supplementary polynomi­
als to accommodate the arbitrary boundary conditions. In Chapters 7 and 8, the 
generalized Fourier series expansions are further elaborated in a more systematic 
and abstract manner; that is, they are described as a generic means for performing 
structural decompositions of a function in accordance with the sufficient condi­
tions set forth for the involved Fourier series to be termwise differentiable. Such an 
approach makes it relatively easier to understand the specific forms of the general­
ized Fourier series for a two-dimensional function as discussed in Chapter 8. The 
excellent convergence characteristics and numerical accuracy of the generalized 
Fourier series are carefully validated using numerical examples. In Chapter 9, the 
generalized Fourier series are formulated into a general method for solving linear 
differential equations with constant coefficients. In order to enable the generalized 
Fourier series method to more effectively deal with multiscale phenomena, the 
structural decompositions are reformulated as the superposition of the general, 
particular and supplementary solutions to better capture the multiscale characteris­
tics or information imbedded in the differential equation and/or loading condition.
Finally, the multiscale Fourier series method is applied to some of the widely 
studied problems in science and engineering: the convection-diffusion-reaction 
equations in Chapter 10, the elastic bending of a thick plate resting on an elastic foun­
dation in Chapter 11, and wave propagation in elastic waveguides with rectangular 
cross-sections in Chapter 12. While the multiscale Fourier series method is repeat­
edly verified, through these examples, to be a reliable and effective means for solving 
general boundary value problems, we are equally fascinated by its competency of cor­
rectly capturing the multiscale phenomena which are deliberately created by substan­
tially varying certain model parameters. These applications also serve to depict the 
various schemes often used to derive the final system of linear algebraic equations, 
and to examine the numerical accuracy of the corresponding solutions.

Fourier Series 
Expansions of Functions
Fourier series is named after French mathematician Joseph Fourier for his break-
through in 1807 by claiming that all functions could be expanded into trigono-
metric series. As a matter of fact, the earliest development of Fourier theory can 
be traced back to the mid of 18th century, originating from the pioneering works 
of a number of prominent mathematicians, such as d’Alembert, Euler, Bernoulli, 
and Lagrange, who employed trigonometric series to solve heat transfer, string 
vibration, and wave propagation problems. However, the full formation of Fourier 
theory surprisingly took more than a century of endeavors as highlighted by the 
famous d’Alembert-Euler-Bernoulli controversy. Nevertheless, it did not take long 
before mathematicians and scientists came to appreciate the power and far-reach-
ing implications of Fourier’s claim regarding trigonometric series. Even today, it 
can be said that “by any yardstick, Fourier series is one of the greatest and most 
influential concepts of contemporary mathematics” (Iserles and Nørsett 2008).
2.1  PERIODIC FUNCTIONS AND THEIR FOURIER SERIES 
EXPANSIONS
Fourier series expansions have been extensively discussed in many books (e.g., 
Zygmund 1968; González-Velasco 1996; Hardy and Rogosinski 2013), and there 
is no need for a comprehensive presentation; instead, only some important results 
and conclusions will be briefly reviewed here for the sake of completeness.
Fourier series is also known as the trigonometric series expansion of a periodic 
function. A function ( )
f x  is referred to as periodic if it satisfies (see Figure 2.1)

(2.2)
where A, ω, and φ are its amplitude, angular frequency, and phase angle, 
respectively.
In practice, the harmonic function is often used to represent an oscillatory 
variation of a physical quantity, such as the x coordinate of a point moving along 
a circle of radius A at a constant rotational speed ω; or if

It is well known that the trigonometric functions, {1, cos x, sin x, cos2x, sin2x, 
cos3x, sin3x, }, constitute a complete system and can be used to expand any

respectively.

f x  
could be generally expanded into a Fourier series. In the above example, however, 
the function 
=
+
+
( )

f x
Ax
Bx
C is only explicitly defined on the interval 
π π
−
(
, ); 
there is no additional information about its behavior elsewhere. As far as expand­
ing a function into a Fourier series is concerned, it is no difference whether ( )
f x  is 
actually defined at the end points, x = π
− and x = π. As a matter of fact, the peri­
odicity condition has already been implicitly enforced upon the function ( )
f x  by 
the Fourier series expansion itself. Thus, if ( )
f x  is indeed a π
2 -periodic function, 
then the Fourier series will truthfully represent it almost everywhere on the whole 
x-axis. Otherwise, the Fourier series actually corresponds to its periodic exten­
sion ( )
f x , which is defined as:

elsewhere. This process of reinstating the periodicity of a function, which is origi­
nally defined in an interval 
π π

(

In addition to this periodic extension, there are other ways of extending a func­
tion (defined on an interval) into a periodic function. Let’s describe them through 
a simple example.

This function will be expanded into Fourier series in three different ways.

 is viewed as the local display of the 
π -period function (refer to Figure 2.3a). Using (2.6)–(2.8) with T

easily obtain its Fourier series as

onto the whole x-axis. The resulting Fourier series is the same as the previously 
obtained in (2.13), that is,

 is first extended onto 
(

 to form an even function on (

While these three Fourier series expansions (2.18)–(2.20) all converge to the same 
function

on

Therefore, a function defined on a compact interval can always be made peri­
odic by using any of these three schemes: periodic extension, even-periodic 
extension, and odd-periodic extension, and corresponding to them there exist 
three different forms of Fourier series expansions: the full-range Fourier series 
(2.3), the half-range Fourier sine series (2.14), and the half-range Fourier cosine 
series (2.16).
2.2  CONVERGENCE OF FOURIER SERIES EXPANSIONS
In (2.3), the sign ~ is used to indicate that the infinite series on the right-hand side 
is the Fourier expansion of the function ( )
f x  defined on 
π
π
−
<
<
(
)
x
. Strictly 
speaking, we cannot automatically replace the sign ~ with = without knowing, a 
priori, that the Fourier series indeed converges to the function correctly every­
where in the interval. To this end, let’s first review a few basic concepts about 
functions.
A function ( )
f x  is said to be continuous at the point 0x  (or 0x  is a point of con­
tinuity), if (
)
0
f x  is defined and
	
=

f x

(2.26)
we call 
0x  a point of discontinuity of the first kind, or more specifically jump

Accordingly, function ( )
f x  is said to be continuous over 
= [ , ]
D
a b  if, for every 
point

In geometrical terms, continuity is an indication whether a curve 
=
( )
y
f x  
jumps at some point(s). In studying the smoothness of a curve, we are also inter­
ested in other types of discontinuities, such as corners or sudden changes of 
directions of tangents. Mathematically, this is equivalent to determining if the 
derivative of a function is continuous; usually, a function is said to be smooth on 
an interval 
= [ , ]
D
a b  if its derivative is continuous at every point ∈
x
D.
In order to measure the smoothness of a function in a broad sense, we use the 
notation 
( )
C
D
k
 to represent a class of functions whose up to k-th order deriva­
tives all exist and are continuous in the domain D; specifically, 
( )
0
C
D  denotes the 
space of continuous functions, and 
( )

C
D  the space of continuously differentiable 
functions. For convenience, the term “sufficiently smooth” or “differentiable” is 
sometimes loosely used to describe a class of functions 
( )
C

 with k being as 
large as needed.

(2.30)
the Fourier series (2.3) is said to be convergent at point x. If (2.30) holds for every 
point x in ( , )
a b , the Fourier series is said to be convergent in this interval.
A question is then naturally raised: when the Fourier series (2.3) converges 
everywhere in the interval, does this mean that ( )
S x  is equal to ( )
f x ?
Theorem 2.1 If ( )
f x  is an absolutely integrable piecewise smooth function of 
period π
2 , then the Fourier series of ( )
f x  converges to ( )
f x  at points of continuity 
and to [

 at points of discontinuity.
The proof of this theorem can be found in most books about Fourier series, and 
will not be given here for shortness.
In light of this theorem, we can now clarify some of the ambiguities left in 
the above discussions. First, in (2.3) the sign ~ (rather than =) has been used to 
connect the function ( )
f x  with its Fourier series expansion. As a matter of fact, 
the replacement of ~ with = can be done only when the Fourier series is known to 
converge correctly to the function for all x in the interval, except at a finite num­
ber of points of discontinuity. Second, this convergence theorem is established 
based on the assumption that the function ( )
f x  is a piecewise smooth function of 
period π
2 . However, this will not prevent us from applying this theorem directly 
to a function defined on a compact interval 
π π
−
[
, ] (or 
π
[0, ]). The reason is that 
the periodicity condition can be easily supplemented to a locally defined function 

20
Fourier Methods in Science and Engineering
by using one of the three periodic extension schemes described in Sec. 2.1. It must 
be noted, however, that after the periodic extension, an originally smooth func­
tion will typically lose some of its continuities at 
π
π
=
± 2
x
m  
=
(
0,1,2,
)

m
, as 
illustrated in Figure 2.2. As a consequence, the Fourier series will only converge 
to the “means” at these discontinuity points.
To be more specific, let’s consider the function 
π
=
≤
≤
( )
,  0
f x
x
x
, which was 
previously discussed in Example 2.2. The function 
=
( )
f x
x is defined on the 
interval 
π
[0,  ]. It can be verified that the Fourier series given in (2.18) will cor­
rectly converge to the function everywhere in 
π
(0,  ). This allows replacing the 
sign ~ with = in (2.18), that is,

(2.31)
It is seen that the two end points, 
= 0
x
 and π, have been excluded from (2.31), 
although the function is fully defined there: 
=
(0)
0
f
 and 
π
π
=
( )
f
. Such exclu­
sion, however, is certainly justified since the Fourier series actually converges to 
the mean value 
π

( )]/2

f
 at each end, rather than the correct values, 
0 and π.
When the function ( )
f x  is even periodically extended (see Figure 2.3c), the 
resulting function is π
2 -periodic and continuous everywhere. Thus, the Fourier 
series (2.20) can be safely rewritten as

(2.33)
Generally, for a continuous function defined on an interval [ , ]
a b , the continuity 
is retained at the end points after the even-periodic extension. In contrast, the 
continuity is typically lost in the periodic (or odd-periodic) extension, and the cor­
responding Fourier series invariably converges to the mean value, 
+
[ ( )
( )]/2
f a
f b
 
(regardless of the actual values of ( )
f a  and ( )
f b ), at both ends =
x
a and =

b.
As an observation from Example 2.2, when the continuity of the function 
π
=
≤
≤
( )

f x

 is retained in the even-periodic extension, its Fourier series 
(2.20) converges at a faster rate of 
−2
m  in comparison to 
−1
m  for its counterparts, (2.18) 
and (2.19), respectively corresponding to the periodic and odd-periodic extensions.
One may then ask: (1) if this observation is generally applicable to all 
0
C  func­
tions and (2) if there exists any relationship between the smoothness of a periodic 
function and the convergence characteristic of its Fourier series expansion? The 
answers to these questions will be described below.

2.3  FOURIER SERIES FOR THE DERIVATIVES OF FUNCTIONS
Once a function has been expanded into a Fourier series, we are interested in 
knowing if and how some of the basic mathematical operations (such as integra­
tion and differentiation), which are originally intended for the function, can be 
directly applied to the Fourier series?

F x  is a function of period π

f

That is, the Fourier series of the derivative ′( )

At this point, we claim that the Fourier coefficients for an absolutely integrable 
function ( )
f x  approach to zero as 
→∞
m
. While this statement is often presented 
as a theorem in some Fourier series books, it suffices here to simply quote it as a 
fact to facilitate the current discussions.

This convergence assessment (2.45) can be generalized into an important theo­
rem as given below.

 derivatives are continuous and the n-th derivative 
is absolutely integrable (the n-th derivative may not exist at certain points). 
Then the Fourier series of all n derivatives can be obtained by term-by-term 
differentiations of the Fourier series of ( )
f x , where all the series, except possibly 
the last, converge uniformly to the corresponding derivatives. Moreover, the 
Fourier coefficients of the function ( )
f x  satisfy the relations

The proof of this theorem is kind of straightforward; it simply involves applying 
(2.45) successively to all the Fourier series for the derivatives of up to the 
−

-th 
order, and recognizing the fact that in the process all the involved derivatives are 
absolutely integrable and their corresponding series can be directly obtained from 
term-by-term differentiations.
More explicitly, (2.46) can be expressed as (Gottlieb and Orszag 1977)

Fourier Series Expansions of Functions
Theorem 2.3 is very useful in that it reveals the intrinsic connection between 
the smoothness of a periodic function and the convergence characteristic of its 
Fourier series expansion. In an ideal case, the Fourier series of a periodic analytic 
function can actually converge at an exponential rate (Tadmor 1986).
However, it must be emphasized that the periodicity is a prerequisite for this 
convergence theorem to hold. Once the periodicity condition is not met by a func­
tion, the convergence of its Fourier series can be seriously deteriorated, even 
when the function is defined sufficiently smooth on the interval.
To illustrate this point, let’s assume that ( )
f x  is sufficiently smooth on 
π π
−
[
, ]. 
The periodic extension will transform it into a periodic piecewise smooth function 
potentially having a number of discontinuity points, 
π
π

Consequently, the resulting Fourier series converges to ( )

odic extension, and the corresponding Fourier series converges in accordance

; that is, when the 
continuity or the smoothness of a function is partially or completely lost in the

tends to deteriorate considerably.
An immediate consequence of a slow convergence appears to be that more 
terms will have to be included in the Fourier series for a desired degree of approx­
imation accuracy. However, we are perhaps more concerned about the differentia­
bility and convergence of the Fourier series for the function and its derivatives, as 
stated in the following theorem.

The above discussions are primarily focused on the integrations and differentia­
tions of the Fourier series of a function ( )
f x  defined on 
π π
−
[
, ], implying that the 
function is actually considered to be π
2 -periodic. Giving a function ( )
f x  defined 
on 
π
[0, ], there exist, at least, three ways to extend it periodically onto the whole 
x-axis: the periodic extension, the odd-periodic extension, and the even-periodic 
extension.
If the periodic extension is adopted, the above discussions regarding the inte­
gration and differentiation of the Fourier series are readily applicable since the 
function ( )
f x  on 
π
[0, ] can be easily transformed into f x =
( )
f
x
π
+
[(
)/2] for 
π π
∈−
[
, ]
x
.
The even-periodic extension will create an even function over 
π π
−
[
, ] whose 
Fourier series is in the form of (2.16). Thus, if ( )
f x  is continuous in the interval 
π
[0, ], then the even-periodic extension will simply lead to a continuous function 
of period π
2 .
In comparison, even if ( )
f x  is continuous over 
π
[0, ], the odd-periodic exten­
sion will result in a π
2 -periodic function, which typically has an infinite number 
of jump discontinuities at 
π
= ±
x
n  
=
(
0,1,2,
)

n
, and its Fourier series in the 
form of (2.14) will invariably converge to zero at these locations regardless of the 
actual values of (0)
f
 and 
π
( )
f
.
Thus, if the function ( )
f x  is continuous and its derivative is absolutely inte­
grable over 
π
[0, ], then its Fourier cosine series is always termwise differentiable; 
and its Fourier sine series is termwise differentiable only if 
π =
≡
( )

If the condition

Theorem 2.5 Let ( )

The Generalized Fourier 
Series with Accelerated 
Convergence
Fourier series will lose much of its luster in expanding a nonperiodic function, 
even when this function is defined sufficiently smooth on a compact interval. It 
is well known that a continuous function can always be expanded into a Fourier 
series inside the interval; the word “inside” is highlighted to emphasize the fact 
that the two end points shall be excluded, unless proven otherwise. While this 
may not seem to be a big deal at the first glance, it actually has profound implica­
tions to the validity and efficacy of the Fourier series when used to approximate 
a function or solve a boundary value problem. In what follows, a strategy will be 
discussed on how to improve the convergence of the Fourier series expansions of 
a locally-defined sufficiently smooth function.
3.1  IMPROVING THE CONVERGENCE OF FOURIER SERIES
The convergence of Fourier series is perhaps the most important concern in prac­
tical applications. Faster convergence implies that a relatively small number of 
terms in the series expansion may lead to a decent approximation to the original 
function regardless of whether the function is explicitly known or not. Perhaps 
more importantly, the convergence rate dictates if the term-by-term differentia­
tions can be directly applied to the Fourier series of a function or solution to 
obtain the series representations for its derivatives, as often encountered in solv­
ing differential equations or boundary value problems.
By recognizing the slower convergence of sine series than its cosine counter­
part, a modified Fourier series was proposed as (Iserles and Nørsett, 2008)

If ( )
f x  is differentiable and its derivative has bounded variation, the expansion 
coefficients, am and bm, in (3.1) will both decay like (
)
2
m− (Adcock 2011), which 
is still considered slow in many cases.
To illustrate the possibility of improving the convergence of a Fourier series, 
let’s start with an example. Suppose that the function ( )
f x  has the Fourier series

In this way, the original Fourier series is split into two parts: one converges essen­
tially at an equal rate of 1/m and the other at a much faster rate of 1/

This example has shed some lights on how to improve the convergence of a 
Fourier series expansion: by splitting the original Fourier series into two or more 
and replacing the slower converged with an appropriate (closed-form) function(s), 
the residual Fourier series is then better shaped to converge at a faster rate. Such 
an approach can be mathematically described as

It needs to be pointed out that the convergence rates for the sine and cosine terms 
are typically different, and the slower one actually dictates the convergence of 
Fourier series as a whole. Therefore, if the Fourier series (3.5) is said to have an 
improved convergence, it means that the slower Fourier coefficients of (3.5) decay 
faster than their counterparts in (2.3).
More explicitly, suppose

The Generalized Fourier Series with Accelerated Convergence
While this example demonstrates the feasibility of improving the convergence 
of a Fourier series expansion via manipulating the Fourier coefficients, such an 
approach is practically of limited use in view of the fact that the Fourier coeffi­
cients have to be known explicitly and be manipulatable.
From a different perspective, however, (3.5) has indeed pointed a direction for 
accelerating the convergence of the involved Fourier series expansion; it is possi­
ble to decompose a function into an appropriate function and a Fourier series with 
improved convergence. As a matter of fact, we can restate it in a more affirmative 
tone: given a sufficiently smooth function ( )
f x  defined on a compact interval, by 
properly selecting the subtraction (or supplementary) function ( )
h x , the Fourier 
series of the residual function 
−
( )
( )
f x
h x  can be obtained to have better conver­
gence, as described below.
Theorem 2.3 in Sec. 2.3 tells that the smoothness of a periodic function actu­
ally determines the convergence rate of its Fourier series expansion, as formally 
established by (2.46). In practice, however, the function is often only explicitly 
defined on a compact interval. Thus, when the function is sought in a form 
of the Fourier series, the function has already been implicitly extended onto 
the whole x-axis via, such as, one of the periodic-extension schemes discussed 
in the previous chapter. This is evident from the series expansions (2.19) and 
(2.20): the same function 
=
( )
f x
x can have different series representations on 
the interval (0,
)
π , which respectively correspond to two different π
2 -periodic 
functions, as illustrated in Figure 2.3(b) and (c). While the periodic function in 
Figure 2.3(c) is continuous everywhere, its counterpart in Figure 2.3(b) is not, 
and this difference has been reflected in the convergence rates for the resulting 
Fourier series.
It is now clear that for a given function ( )
f x  defined on the interval [ , ]
a b , 
the convergence of its Fourier series can be accelerated by subtracting from it 
an appropriate supplementary function so that the residual function, when it is 
periodically extended, will have a desired smoothness and its Fourier series can 
accordingly converge at a faster rate.
This scheme was originally used to improve the convergence of the Fourier 
series expansion of a function which has a finite number of discontinuity 
points on the interval, and polynomials are often used as the subtraction func­
tions (Lanczos 1966; Jones and Hardy 1970; Baszenski et al. 1995; Eckhoff 
1998).
To be specific, we here assume that the function ( )
f x  is sufficiently smooth 
(e.g., having K continuous derivatives and the (
+1
K
)-th derivative being abso­
lutely integrable) in the interval [
, ]
π π
−
. When the function ( )
f x  is periodically 
extended, the resulting π
2 -periodic function and its derivatives will potentially 
have discontinuities at 
2
,
n
π
π
±
 = 0,1,2,...
n
.
In the polynomial subtraction techniques, the original function ( )
f x  is decom­
posed into the polynomial ( )
h x  and the residual function ( )
F x  as
	
=
+
( )
( )
( ).
f x
F x
h x

In other words, the residual function ( )
F x , if periodically extended, will have K 
continuous derivatives and its (

according to Theorem 2.3, its Fourier coefficients, if denoted by αm and βm, are 
to satisfy

Now, by assuming that the function ( )
f x  has 
+
(2

 continuous derivatives 
and the absolutely integrable 
+
2(

the generalized Fourier cosine series as:

The polynomial ( )
h x  can still be given in the form of (3.13). However, as evident 
from the previous discussions, regardless of the selection of ( )
h x , the continuities 
of ( )
F x  and its derivatives of even orders, at 
π
= ±
x
n  
=
(
0,1,2,...)
n
, can always 
be ensured by the even-periodic extension. As a result, the polynomial ( )
h x  only 
needs to be selected to secure the continuities of the odd-order derivatives of 
( )
F x  at these locations. In the meantime, notice that the odd-order derivatives are 
odd functions over the interval, then the only way for them to be continuous at 
π

In summary, assume that ( )

π  and its n-th 
derivative is absolutely integrable. Then the residual function ( )
F x  defined by (3.8) 
can be extended into a π
2 -periodic function of:
1.	C K continuity (
≤
−1
K
n
), if ( )
h x  is given by (3.26);
2.

3.

Therefore, their corresponding Fourier series expansions will be able to converge 
at faster rates in accordance with Theorem 2.3.

The Generalized Fourier Series with Accelerated Convergence
3.2  THE GENERALIZED FOURIER COSINE SERIES 
EXPANSION WITH ACCELERATED CONVERGENCE
For a sufficiently smooth function ( )
f x  defined on a compact interval [0,
]
π , it can 
always be expanded into Fourier cosine series as
	
( )
/2
cos
,
0
,
0
1
f x
a
a
mx
x
m
m
∑
π
=
+
≤
≤
=
∞
and the expansion coefficients am are known to decay like (
)
2
m−.
In the previous section, a Fourier series convergence acceleration scheme has 
been described in which an appropriate polynomial ( )
h x  is purposely subtracted 
from the original function ( )
f x  so that the residual function ( )
F x  can be expanded 
into a Fourier series with a better convergence rate.
While the polynomial ( )
h x  can be easily constructed, as described in Sec. 3.1, 
using the Lanczos polynomials or others, the combined use of the trigonometric 
functions and polynomials may appear to be non-traditional, among some other 
undesired characteristics. To keep a close similarity to the conventional Fourier 
series, while maintaining the improved convergence characteristic of the general­
ized Fourier series, the polynomial ( )
h x  in (3.36) will be replaced with trigono­
metric terms, leading to a “pure” trigonometric series in the form of

It is seen that while the conventional sine series decays with 1/m, the general­

rates of 1/

(3.167)
The series expansion (3.166) will converge at a rate of 
3
m− in comparison with 
2
m− for series (3.163).
It is seen from the above discussions that the complete Fourier series (3.139) looks 
slightly more complicated than its sine or cosine counterpart, in particular, with 
the inclusion of the function sn( )
x . In addition, its convergence rate is improved 
at a relatively slower pace of 
−1
m  (as compared with 
−2
m  for the sine or cosine 
series) each time when P or Q is increased by 1. However, this “incremental” way 
of improving the convergence rate may become necessary in some cases, such 
as when the smoothness of a (solution) function is preferred not to be artificially 
boosted for whatever reasons.

deformations is often attributed to the pioneering works of Bernoulli and Euler in 
the mid of 18th century, even though the beam problems might be actually attempted 
earlier by others. At the center of the beam theory is the so-called Euler-Bernoulli 
equation, a fourth order linear differential equation that, together with the suitable 
boundary conditions, governs the deflections of elastic beams under various load­
ing conditions. In Chapter 3, different forms of supplementary functions have been 
used to condition a sufficiently smooth function defined on a compact interval so 
that the involved Fourier series can have an improved rate of convergence. In what 
follows, this generalized form of Fourier series expansions is extended from a math­
ematical scheme for effectively approximating a function into a powerful and gen­
eral means for solving boundary value problems: specifically, the Euler-Bernoulli 
beam equation subjected to a set of arbitrary boundary conditions.

In different scientific fields, the solution y x

meaning. For instance, in studying the deflection of a string stretched between 
two points at 
=

0 and 
=

L, the differential equation (4.6) and the boundary 
conditions (4.7) and (4.8) accordingly become

Fourier Series Solutions of the Euler-Bernoulli Beam Equation
The differential equation (4.9) can also be used to solve for the longitudinal 
deformation of an elastic rod. In such a case, the tension T should be replaced by 
EA (E is the Young’s modulus of the material and A is the cross-sectional area of 
the rod) and f x
( ) should be understood as the distributed force applied along the 
rod. The boundary condition at an end (e.g., =
x
0) is accordingly prescribed as:

4.2  CHARACTERISTIC SOLUTIONS OF THE BEAM EQUATION
Solving for the static deformations of one-dimensional elastic bodies (such as 
strings, bars, or beams) will typically involve integrating the loading function a 
few times and then substituting the results into the boundary conditions to deter­
mine integration constants, which may be considered a trivial task. To better illus­
trate the current solution schemes, we take the vibration of an Euler-Bernoulli 
beam as example. The beam vibration is governed by the following fourth-order 
linear differential equation

respectively.

state conditions: the forcing function is sinusoidal with respect to time t, 
(i.e.

( )
), and the beam will respond it with a harmonic motion,

are often referred to as the eigenfrequencies, characteristic frequencies, modal 
frequencies, natural frequencies, etc., and the corresponding solutions (4.29) as 
the eigenfunctions, characteristic solutions, modes, normal modes, etc.
Although the simply supported beam is here used to demonstrate the proce­
dures of determining its eigen-parameters, the whole process equally applies to 
beams with other boundary conditions, except that the resulting characteristic 
equations tend to become much more complicated and may have to be solved 
numerically or approximately.

66
Fourier Methods in Science and Engineering
For a continuous beam there is an infinite number of eigenfunctions. The 
eigenfunctions for the simply supported beam, as given in (4.29), are evidently 
orthogonal with each other, and constitute a complete system. This is also true to 
the eigenfunctions of a beam with any other type of boundary conditions.

4.3  FOURIER SERIES SOLUTIONS OF THE BEAM PROBLEMS
In the modal superposition method, the displacement solution is expressed as 
a linear combination of the eigenfunctions, and its relevant derivatives can be 
simply obtained from term-by-term differentiations. When the eigenfunctions of 
a simply supported beam happen to be the sine functions as given in (4.29), the 
modal superposition method is then equivalent to expanding the solution into the 
Fourier sine series. Some attempts have been made of extending the Fourier series 
methods to beams with other boundary conditions (Greif and Mittendorf 1976; 
Wang and Lin 1996; Maurizi and Robledo 1998). The critical step is to recognize 
the fact that the Fourier series for the involved derivatives cannot be automatically 
obtained from the term-by-term differentiations.
To illustrate this point, consider the beam displacement function given in the 
form of the Fourier sine series

Since the elements of the coefficient matrix are explicitly dependent upon the 
frequency ω, the eigenfrequencies can thus be obtained from (4.50) as a special 
set of values which make the determinant of the coefficient matrix vanish. Such a 
process, however, will typically involve solving a nonlinear equation, which is at 
least a tedious task, if nothing more.
Alternatively, we will adopt a much simpler approach as described below.
The boundary values of the second-order derivative, B0 and B1, are first deter­
mined from the boundary equations (4.46) and (4.47), and then substituted into 
the governing equation (4.44), leading to

The above equation represents a standard characteristic equation about the matrix 
[
]
amn  from which the eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors can be read­
ily determined as adequately discussed in linear algebra.
4.4  THE GENERALIZED FOURIER SERIES SOLUTIONS
In Sec. 4.3, the beam displacement is assumed to vanish identically at each end. 
As a consequence, its odd-periodic extension is ensured to have C1 continuity, 
and its first two derivatives can be directly obtained from term-by-term differ­
entiations. According to Theorem 2.3, the Fourier series (4.35) can be ensured 
to converge at the speed of λ
→
A
m
m

 as 
→∞
m
. However, due to the presence 
of the λm
4-like terms in the coefficient matrix, it may not be guaranteed that the 
characteristic equation (4.54) will lead to the converged solution.
This difficulty, however, can be effectively resolved by using the convergence 
acceleration schemes described in the previous chapter.
Under the current framework, the solutions of the beam equation, regardless of 
the boundary conditions, will be invariably expressed as
	
=
+
w x
w x
h x
( )
( )
( ),	
(4.56)
where the supplementary function h x
( ), as mentioned earlier, is introduced to 
cope with all the potential discontinuities associated with the displacement and 
its three derivatives at the ends of the solution domain 
L
[0, ] when they are peri­
odically extended. In other words, the “residual” displacement w x
( ) now pres­
ents a periodic function and has at least three continuous derivatives. If w x
( ) is 
expanded into a cosine series

(4.57)
then all the required differentiations can be simply carried out term-by-term.
As described in Chapter 3, the supplementary function can be in the form of 
polynomials, sinusoidal functions, or any other suitable closed-form functions.

We can recap the major procedures just depicted for obtaining the generalized 
Fourier solutions as follows:
1.	Selecting a suitable supplementary function of any form;
2.	Defining the supplementary function as an explicit function of the 
unknown boundary constants to ensure a desired degree of continuities 
for the residual displacement when it is periodically extended;
3.	Determining the relationship between the unknown boundary constants 
and the Fourier coefficients by forcing the generalized Fourier solution 
to satisfy the boundary conditions;
4.	Solving for the Fourier coefficients from the governing differential 
equation.
However, it must be pointed out that there are plenty of rooms or flexibilities in 
following these solution steps.
4.5  CONVERGENCE ASSESSMENT
The Fourier series in (4.56) or (4.102) actually represents the residual or condi­
tioned beam solution, whose periodic extension is explicitly required to have at 
least three continuous derivatives. Thus, it will converge at a faster rate of

solution (4.56) can be directly estimated from the governing equation (4.72)

It must be noted that even though a same set of boundary constants, αi and βi, are 
used in (4.120) and (4.121), they actually have different meanings (refer to (4.63) 
and (4.64), and (4.103)–(4.106)).
If the displacement is expanded into the conventional Fourier sine series (4.37), 
(4.45) can be generalized to

where the potential discontinuities of displacement at the end points are also taken 
into account.
If the boundary constants are known a priori, then (4.120)–(4.122) can be 
directly used to assess the convergence rates for the corresponding Fourier series 
solutions. For instance, if a simply supported beam is elastically restrained by a 
rotational spring at each end, the constants β0 and β1 are then both equal to zero, 
and the generalized sine series solution will converge according to

For a generally supported beam, (4.16) and (4.17), the constants β

by using different numbers of terms in the generalized cosine series. It is seen that 
the generalized Fourier series solution converges so fast that only an inclusion of 
a small number of terms can lead to an excellent prediction. In contrast, as illus­
trated in Table 4.3, the conventional Fourier series solution based on (4.52) does

Once the eigenvalues are found, the corresponding eigenfunctions can be

Fourier Series Solutions of the Euler-Bernoulli Beam Equation
In each of the plots, M denotes the number of cosine terms actually used in the 
solution; for larger M’s, the corresponding curves virtually look identical to their 
analytical counterparts. All these results have indicated that eigenfunctions can 
be accurately obtained with only a few terms in the generalized Fourier series. 
The remarkable convergence characteristic of the current solution is perhaps best 
shown in Figures 4.5 and 4.6 where adding one more term has really made a big 
difference.
Let’s now consider two examples that involve both rotational and translational 
restraints. The first one concerns a pinned-free beam with a rotational spring at 
the pinned end and a translational spring at the free end. Table 4.4 lists the first 
eigenfrequencies for the various combinations of the spring constants. The results 
are very close to those previously given in reference (Maurizi et al. 1976).
The second example involves a beam supported at each end by both trans­
lational and rotational springs. By assuming

studied in reference (Rao and Mirza 1989) and an excellent agreement has been 
observed between the two solutions. The remarkable convergence of the current 
solution is again demonstrated in Table 4.6 for the elastically restrained beam.
In the above examples, the beam solutions are determined using the general­
ized Fourier cosine series expansions. It is stated in Sec. 4.5 that the generalized 
cosine series solution is able to outperform its sine counterpart for beams with 
general boundary conditions. To illustrate this point, a few more examples will 
be given below.
Let’s start with the clamped-pinned boundary condition, which corresponds 
to the second column for

both ends, the first derivative is typically not equal to zero at x = L. As mentioned 
earlier, this case favors the generalized sine series solution.

Fourier Series Solutions of the Euler-Bernoulli Beam Equation
Now, if the stiffness of the rotational spring at x = L also becomes infinitely 
large (i.e., the clamped-clamped boundary condition), then both the displacement 
and its derivative will vanish simultaneously at both ends. Even though this case 
represents a better scenario for both solutions, the generalized cosine series solu­
tion is expected to outperform its sine counterpart in terms of convergence 
(i.e., λ −4
M  vs. λ −

Fourier Series for the 
Derivatives of One-
Dimensional Functions
In Sec. 2.3, the simple integration and differentiation of a Fourier series have 
been briefly discussed with an important observation that the term-by-term dif­
ferentiation cannot be automatically applied to the Fourier series of a function to 
obtain the series representation of its derivative. In this chapter, our attention is 
directed to the Fourier series for the higher order derivatives of a one-dimensional 
function. In particular, the general relationships will be established among the 
Fourier series (actually, the Fourier coefficients) for the derivatives of various 
orders. Such an interest arises from the need of simultaneously expanding a func­
tion and its derivatives into Fourier series over a compact interval.
5.1  INTEGRAL FORMULAS REGARDING THE 
DERIVATIVES OF FUNCTIONS
Let u(x) be a sufficiently smooth function defined on the interval 
a a
−
[
, ] or 
a
[0, ]. 
We first define two specific forms of integrals involved with calculating the 
Fourier coefficients of higher order derivatives:
	
I
p x
u
x
x dx
C
x
a
p
m
∫
α

∫
α
=

( )sin(

( )

(5.2)
where u
x
p ( )
( )
 denotes 
( )
d u x
dx
p
p , the p-th order derivative of the function u x
( ).

In the last step, the terms in the summation are rearranged in a sequence from the

5.2  FOURIER COEFFICIENTS FOR THE 
DERIVATIVES OF FUNCTIONS
The function u x
( ) and its derivatives can typically be expanded into one of the 
three different forms:
1.	The function and its derivatives are expanded into full-range Fourier 
series over the interval 
a a
−
[
, ];
2.	The function is expanded into the half-range cosine series over the inter­
val 
a
[0, ], and its derivatives are expanded into the half-range Fourier 
series;
3.	The function is expanded into the half-range sine series over the interval 
a
[0, ], and its derivatives are expanded into the half-range Fourier series.
Unlike in the previous discussions, the words “full-range” and “half-range” are 
adopted here when the simple terms, such as, the complete Fourier series, cosine

Fourier Methods in Science and Engineering
series, and sine series cannot be adequately used to fully specify the natures of the 
relevant series representations. However, whenever such clarification is unneces­
sary, those words will be dropped off for simplicity. Actually, this shall not cause 
much confusion: “full-range” is often associated with the interval [−a, a] and 
“half-range” with the interval [0, a].
In the (full-range) Fourier series expansion, the function u x
( ) and its deriva­
tives, u

k ( )
(2 )
 and u

The above equations can be readily obtained from Theorem 5.1 by substituting 
x = 0

 into (5.3)–(5.6).

The above results show that the Fourier coefficients for any given order deriva­
tive can be calculated directly from those for the function u x
( ) and the bound­
ary values of the lower order derivatives. It must be pointed out that calculating 
the boundary values of the lower order derivatives is not equivalent to knowing 
their Fourier coefficients unless the corresponding Fourier series expansions are 
known to converge correctly at the boundary points.
5.3  EXAMPLES
In this section, the formulas above derived for calculating the Fourier coefficients 
of higher order derivatives will be verified by two different sample functions: 
polynomials and trigonometric functions.

As a cross-check, we will take three different approaches.
First, the expressions for the first three derivatives will be given explicitly 
and each of them is subsequently expanded into the Fourier series directly. The 
three derivatives of

the Fourier series expansions of

According to (5.37), the Fourier coefficients of the function ( )

Fourier Series for the Derivatives of One-Dimensional Functions
5.4  SUFFICIENT CONDITIONS FOR THE TERM-BY-TERM 
DIFFERENTIATIONS OF FOURIER SERIES
The above discussions have described a framework for directly determining the 
Fourier series for the higher order derivatives of a function. In the meantime, 
it also becomes evident that the applications of these general formulas require 
the specific knowledge about the values of the function and the relevant lower 
order derivatives at the boundary points of the interval over which the function is 
defined. This may not actually be a trivial task in the context of, such as, solving 
general differential equations or boundary value problems.
By now, it should have become clear that the difficulties associated with 
determining the Fourier coefficients for higher order derivatives are primarily 
caused by those terms which require the explicit calculations, if possible at all, of 
the boundary values of the lower order derivatives. Instead of taking a head-on 
approach to attack the problem, alternative options will be pursued here, and their 
feasibilities are based on the following theorems.
Theorem 5.2 Let the function u x
( ) C
a a
r
∈
−
−([
, ])
2
1
 and its 2r-th derivative be 
absolutely integrable. If u x
( ) is given in the form of the Fourier series over the 
interval 
a a
−
[
, ], then for any integer p
r

= 1,2,
,2 , the sufficient condition for this 
series to be termwise differentiable for the corresponding series of u
x
p ( )
( )
 is that

( )
( )
	
(5.86)
Proof. If (5.86) are simultaneously satisfied, the terms in (5.17)–(5.23) which 
involve the boundary values of lower order derivatives will vanish all together, 
which is mathematically equivalent to the applicability of the term-by-term dif­
ferential operations.
In light of (5.28)–(5.30) and (5.34)–(5.36), similar theorems exist regarding the 
half-range Fourier series expansions.
Theorem 5.3 Let the function u x
( ) 
C
a
r
∈
−([0, ])
2

 and its 2r-th derivative be 
absolutely integrable. If u x
( ) is given in the form of the Fourier cosine series over 
the interval [0, ]

Fourier Series for the 
Partial Derivatives 
of Two-Dimensional 
Functions
As a continuation to the previous discussions, we now turn to the Fourier series 
for the partial derivatives of two-dimensional functions. In comparison with the 
one-dimensional cases, the general formulas for calculating the Fourier coeffi­
cients of the partial derivatives will here become more complicated and tedious, 
but they are still quite manageable due to the similarities to the previous ones. 
More importantly, these formulas will be useful in establishing the sufficient con­
ditions for the term-by-term differentiations of the corresponding Fourier series 
for the partial derivatives of two-dimensional functions.

which can be easily rearranged into (6.5).
In (6.5), the dual-orders, (p1, p2), of the partial derivatives are both assumed to 
be even numbers. Obviously, in parallel with (6.5) there exist three other possible 
parity combinations which call for different expressions. For conciseness, the cor­
responding results, together with those for the other integrals in (6.2)–(6.4), are all 
given in Appendix A placed at the end of this chapter.

6.2  FOURIER COEFFICIENTS FOR PARTIAL DERIVATIVES 
OF TWO-DIMENSIONAL FUNCTIONS
Using the integral formula (6.5) and the likes in Appendix A, the Fourier coef­
ficients for the higher order partial derivatives of a two-dimensional function can 
be directly calculated in a way similar to what was described in Chapter 5 for 
one-dimensional functions.
The determinations of the Fourier coefficients for a two-dimensional function 
and its higher order partial derivatives are here specifically divided into the fol­
lowing five categories:
1.	The function and its partial derivatives are expanded into full-range or 
complete Fourier series over the domain −
× −
a a
b b
[
, ]
[
, ];
2.	The function is expanded into a half-range cosine-cosine series over the 
domain 
×
a
b
[0, ]
[0, ], and its partial derivatives are expanded into half-
range Fourier series over the domain 
×
a
b
[0, ]
[0, ];
3.	The function is expanded into a half-range sine-cosine series over the 
domain 
×
a
b
[0, ]
[0, ], and its partial derivatives are expanded into half-
range Fourier series over the domain 
×
a
b
[0, ]
[0, ];
4.	The function is expanded into a half-range cosine-sine series over the 
domain 
×
a
b
[0, ]
[0, ], and its partial derivatives are expanded into half-
range Fourier series over the domain 
×
a
b
[0, ]
[0, ];
5.	The function is expanded into a half-range sine-sine series over the 
domain 
×
a
b
[0, ]
[0, ], and its partial derivatives are expanded into half-
range Fourier series over the domain 
×
a
b
[0, ]
[0, ].
In the above, the term “half-range Fourier series” is generically used to refer 
to one of the four specific forms of series expansions: the half-range Fourier 
cosine-cosine series, the half-range Fourier sine-cosine series, the half-range 
Fourier cosine-sine series, and the half-range Fourier sine-sine series. In 
what follows, our discussions will only be focused on two of the five different 
categories.

It should be noted that the above formulas are specifically used to calculate the 
Fourier coefficients for the derivatives of even orders in both x and y directions. 
The corresponding results for other different order parities can be easily obtained 
because converting a derivative order from even into odd, or vice versa, will sim­
ply involve one step of integration-by-part. Thus, only the final expressions are 
directly given below for the sake of completeness.

The significance of these formulas lies in the fact that the Fourier coefficients 
for the derivatives can be calculated from those for the lower order derivatives if 
their boundary values are also known explicitly. In the meantime, these formulas 
also show that the Fourier series for the partial derivatives of a function can­
not be generally obtained from the term-by-term differentiations of the Fourier 
series for their “root” functions unless certain conditions are satisfied as clari­
fied later.
6.2.2  The Half-Range Fourier Series for the Partial Derivatives
It is obvious from the previous section that expanding the partial derivatives into 
the full-range Fourier series may easily become a tedious task in view of the fact 
that each of the four types of terms can have multiple expressions correspond­
ing to different index combinations, (m, n, k1, k2). In this regard, the half-range 
Fourier (sine-sine, cosine-cosine, sine-cosine, or cosine-sine) series may become 
more attractive because the number of terms involved is greatly reduced.
For instance, suppose that the two-dimensional function u x y
( , ) is expanded 
into a (half-range) Fourier sine-sine series on the domain 
×
a

[0, ]
[0, ] as

These formulas look like their counterparts in the full-range Fourier series expan­
sions except that a factor of 1/2 (or 1/4) shall be applied to the boundary (or cor­
ner) terms, and the lower order derivatives are now calculated at 
=
x
0 (and/or 
=
y
0), rather than at = −
x
a (and/or = −
y
b).
A two-dimensional function u x y
( , ) can also be expanded into a half-range 
cosine-cosine series, sine-cosine series, or cosine-sine series on the domain 
×
a
b
[0, ]
[0, ]. The resulting formulas are readily available by comparing the like 
terms in the full- and half-range series expansions and making some necessary 
modifications as done above for the Fourier sine-sine series.

Fourier Series Expansions for the Partial Derivatives
6.3  EXAMPLES
In this section, the above formulas derived for calculating the Fourier coefficients 
of the partial derivatives will be validated by using the polynomials and trigono­
metric functions given in Table 6.1.
For the given functions, their partial derivatives of any orders are readily 
obtained, and so are the corresponding Fourier coefficients, including the bound­
ary ones, regardless which particular form of Fourier series is chosen. The Fourier 
coefficients such calculated will be considered accurate and used as reference val­
ues for checking the accuracies of the Fourier coefficients determined using the 
formulas given in the previous sections.
For this purpose, some error indexes (or, norms) need to be first defined to mea­
sure the accuracies of the calculated Fourier coefficients for the partial derivatives 
of orders up to r
2  (r is a positive integer). Take the Fourier series expansion over 
the domain −
× −
a a
b b
[
, ]
[
, ] for example. For the sake of numerical calculations, we 
truncate all the series expansions to 
=
m
M and =
n
N, and define the error indexes as

40, presented in Table 6.2 are the error 
indexes of the Fourier coefficients for the various orders of partial derivatives of 
the sample functions given in Table 6.1.
It can be seen from Table 6.2 that while the calculated Fourier coefficients 
are generally very accurate, the error indexes tend to deteriorate as the orders 
of derivatives increase. Instead of viewing it as an indication of the unreliability 
of the formulas involved, we believe that this actually results from the increased 
truncation errors for the higher order derivatives; or more explicitly, each time 
a function is differentiated, the convergence rate of the corresponding Fourier 
series is roughly slowed down by a factor of αm or βn.
6.4  SUFFICIENT CONDITIONS FOR TERM-BY-TERM 
DIFFERENTIATIONS OF THE FOURIER SERIES

Proof. Although the complete proof of this theorem is quite lengthy and tedious,

culations of the Fourier coefficients of the partial derivatives. As an illustration,

which is equivalent to the term-by-term differentiations of the full-range Fourier 
series, (6.8), of the function u x y
( , ).
The similar expressions can be derived for other terms to complete the proof 
of this theorem.
The sufficient conditions for term-by-term differentiations can also be estab­
lished for the various forms of half-range Fourier series expansions, as stated in 
the theorems below.

tated by the parities of the derivative orders in x- and y-direction, as specifically 
given in (6.73)–(6.76).

The face values of these theorems lie in the fact that they specifically regulate 
under what conditions the Fourier series of the partial derivatives can be directly 
obtained from the term-by-term differentiations of the series for the root functions. 
More importantly, however, they actually point to a new direction for solving 
differential equations or boundary values problems as discussed later.

The Generalized Fourier 
Series of Functions
Thus far, it should have become clear that for a sufficiently smooth function 
defined on a compact domain, the convergence characteristics of the correspond­
ing Fourier series expansions are dictated by the smoothness of its periodically-
extended versions. In other words, preserving the smoothness of the original 
function as much as possible (or needed) during its periodic-extension is critical 
to ensuring a desired convergence behavior of the resulting Fourier series. Given 
a sufficiently smooth function, however, the process of periodic extension itself 
can do little toward realizing this goal. Instead, we have to resort to other means, 
such as, the use of appropriate supplementary terms, to achieve the desired degree 
of smoothness of the residual function which is subsequently to be expanded into 
a Fourier series, as described below.
7.1  STRUCTURAL DECOMPOSITIONS OF 
ONE-DIMENSIONAL FUNCTIONS
We denote by 
−
−([
, ])
2
1
C
a a
r
 (or 
−([0, ])
2
1
C
a
r
) the set of functions which have 
−
2
1
r
 
continuous derivatives over the interval −
[
, ]
a a (or [0, ]
a ). Based on the sufficient 
conditions for the 2r times term-by-term differentiations of a Fourier series, the 
one-dimensional function ( )
u x  is herein decomposed into two parts
	
ϕ
ϕ
=
+
( )
( )
( ),
0
1
u x
x
x 	
(7.1)
where ϕ ( )
0 x  is referred to as the internal function and ϕ ( )
1 x  as the boundary 
function.
In what follows, this decomposition scheme will be implemented in three dif­
ferent ways.
First, we assume 
∈
−
−
( )
([
, ])
2
1
u x
C
a a
r
 and its 2r-th order derivative is absolutely 
integrable over the interval −
[
, ]
a a . The boundary function ϕ ( )
1 x  is then such con­
structed that the internal function ϕ ( )
0 x  is forced to satisfy the sufficient conditions 
to ensure its (full-range) Fourier series to be 2r times termwise differentiable.
More explicitly, the sufficient conditions for the 2r times term-by-term differ­
entiations can be expressed as

In the second way, it is assumed that the function 
∈
−
( )

1
u x
C
a
r
 and its 
2r-th order derivative is absolutely integrable over the interval [0, ]

ary function ϕ ( )
1 x  is then such constructed that the internal function ϕ ( )
0 x  is 
forced to satisfy the sufficient conditions for its half-range Fourier cosine series to 
be 2r times termwise differentiable.
The sufficient conditions for the 2r times term-by-term differentiations can be 
accordingly written as

such a way that the internal function ϕ ( )

tions for its half-range Fourier sine series to be 2r times termwise differentiable.

7.2  GENERALIZED FOURIER SERIES OF ONE-DIMENSIONAL 
FUNCTIONS
On the basis of structural decompositions of a one-dimensional function 
described in the previous section, we now discuss how to select the boundary and 
internal functions for the simultaneous series expansions of the function and its 
derivatives.
7.2.1  The Generalized Full-Range Fourier Series 
of One-Dimensional Functions
Let’s first consider the generalized Fourier series (GFS) for the one-dimensional 
function 
∈
( )
u x
−
−([
, ])
2
1
C
a a
r
 and its derivatives.
In constructing the boundary function ϕ ( )
1 x , the vector of supplementary 
functions is defined as:

where

r, represent a set of closed-form functions which are 
linearly independent and sufficiently smooth on the interval −
[
, ]
a a . The term 
“sufficiently smooth” here implies that each of these functions is, at least, 2r times 
continuously differentiable on the interval. Such a requirement can be readily sat­
isfied by many forms of functions such as polynomials; theoretically, there exists 
a large (or even an infinite) number of possible choices for such supplementary 
functions.
The differential forms of (7.8) are simply given as

7.3  THE POLYNOMIAL-BASED GENERALIZED FOURIER 
SERIES FOR ONE-DIMENSIONAL FUNCTIONS
In Sec. 7.2, a framework has been established for the simultaneous series expan­
sions of a sufficiently smooth function and its derivatives defined on a compact 
interval. The key concept is to supplement the CFS with a set of closed-form of 
functions to allow performing term-by-term differentiations as many times as 
needed. Actually, the supplementary functions, 
( )
1,
p
x
j
, =

1, 2,
, 2
j
r, are only 
required to be sufficiently smooth and linearly independent. Thus, there is a large 
(theoretically, an infinite) number of possible choices, and for each choice, the 
corresponding GFS may be slightly different from others. However, regardless of 
what supplementary functions are specifically selected, it is evident from the above 
discussions that the GFS are essentially unaffected in terms of the execution pro­
cedures and final forms. For example, if the Lanczos polynomials or trigonometric 
functions are chosen as the supplementary functions, the current framework will 
basically lead to the same series expansions as presented in Sec. 3.1–3.4.
In what follows, the simplest set of polynomials will be specifically used:

The Generalized Fourier Series of Functions
Among other potential benefits, the polynomial-based GFS expansions are 
obviously capable of reproducing the complete polynomials of specific degrees, 
that is:
1.	The generalized Fourier series over −
[
, ]
a a  (or the generalized cosine 
series over [0, ]
a ) can reproduce a complete polynomial of degree 2r;
2.	The generalized sine series over [0, ]
a  can reproduce a complete polyno­
mial of degree

.
7.4  EXAMPLES
By setting

, we will here use the functions listed in Table 7.1 to investigate 
the convergence characteristics and approximation accuracy of the polynomial-
based GFS expansions.
7.4.1  Error Indexes of the Series Approximations
Error indexes will first be defined to assess the convergence and accuracy of the 
series expansions and, possibly, their spatial dependences.

Let M  be the truncation number for (the trigonometric series in) the GFS of

 be the corresponding partial sum.

Obviously, the index (7.75) measures the approximation error for a particular 
partial sum. We can also define an overall error index associated with the simul­

Additionally, the error indexes defined in (7.75) and (7.76) can be spatially refined

7.4.2  Convergence Characteristics
For the sample functions 2 and 4 given in Table 7.1, their GFS expansions are 
successively truncated to the first 2, 3, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 terms. By setting 
= 101
1
N t
, the overall, internal and boundary error indexes are respectively plotted 
in Figures 7.2 and 7.3 for these two sample functions and some of their derivatives 
of orders up to 6.
It is seen that in both cases the overall and internal approximation errors for 
the sample functions and their up to third order derivatives decrease rapidly as the 
truncation number increases. For instance, for the truncation number 
= 10
M
, the 
corresponding error indexes are all below 1.0E−4 and the trend of rapid and sus­
tained descending is continued; their values at 
= 40
M
 are further reduced by 
more than 2 orders of magnitude. In comparison, the boundary approximations 
are not as good as their internal counterparts in terms of convergence rates indi­
cated by the steepness of the corresponding error index curves.
As established by Theorem 2.3 in Chapter 2, the convergence rate is deter­
mined by the smoothness of a periodic function. Throughout the discussions thus 
far, it should have become clear that the supplementary terms in the GFS are 

155
The Generalized Fourier Series of Functions
literally used to get rid of the possible discontinuities at the boundaries of the 
interval which potentially result from the periodic extensions of the original (suf­
ficiently smooth) function. Specifically, by setting 
=
2
6
r
 as in the current exam­
ples, the internal functions, when periodically extended, are at least ensured to 
have 
5
C  continuity. Thus, the Fourier series of the internal functions, and hence 
the GFS, will converge in accordance to (
)
7
−
m
; each time the function is dif­
ferentiated, the convergence will be slowed down by a factor of M. This should 
have reasonably explained the noticeable deteriorations of the convergence rates 
with the derivative orders, as shown in Figures 7.2 and 7.3.
Strictly speaking, Theorem 2.3 or the convergence estimate given by (2.46) 
is specifically about the Fourier coefficients, rather than the above defined error 
indexes. However, it is not difficult to understand that the direct quote of this theo­
rem, if not completely appropriate, shall not be a serious offense either.
Finally, it needs to be mentioned that even though the error indexes for the 
sixth order derivatives are included in Figures 7.2 and 7.3, the corresponding 
GFS, by setting 
=
2
6
r
, will essentially degenerate into the CFS in regard to con­
vergence rates.

7.4.3  Reproducing Property of Polynomials
For the polynomial functions 1 and 3 in Table 7.1, the expansion coefficients/
constants for their GFS are listed in Table 7.2. For the non-polynomial (or trigono­
metric) terms, the corresponding coefficients are all essentially zero (numerically, 
in the order of 1.0E−16 or smaller). For the basis functions in the form of poly­
nomials, the corresponding coefficients can be combined to precisely reconstruct 
the original sample polynomial functions. This verifies the reproducing property 
of polynomials for the polynomial-based GFS expansions.
7.4.4  Approximation Accuracy
In view of the excellent convergence behavior and numerical stability of the poly­
nomial-based GFS method, the setting 
= 40
M
 will be used in the subsequent 
calculations.
Since the polynomial-based GFS has already been shown in Table 7.2 to 
be capable of precisely approximating the polynomial functions 1 and 3, only 
the trigonometric functions (No. 2 and No. 4 in Table 7.1) will be here used to

address the accuracy issue. Shown in Table 7.3 are the approximation errors 
associated with the GFS expansions of these two functions and their derivatives, 
together with those for the CFS for the purpose of comparison. It is observed 
that for the functions and their up to fourth order derivatives, the overall and 
internal accuracies of the corresponding GFS are far more better (by 4 orders 
of magnitude) than their counterparts. Surprisingly, in terms of the boundary

orders of magnitude.
For the fifth order derivatives, these two different forms of Fourier series 
expansions start to behave almost the same with respect to the overall, internal 
and boundary errors. This is easily understandable: the error indexes,

these points. Similarly, the continuities, at = 0

of the sample function 4 are automatically kept by the even-periodic extension, as 
implied by its Fourier cosine series expansion. As for the sixth order derivative, 
the setting

 indicates that the sixth (and higher) order derivative is out of 
bound, and the GFS and the CFS are essentially the same in terms of convergence.

The Generalized 
Fourier Series of 
Two-Dimensional 
Functions
A scheme was described in the previous chapter to accelerate the convergence 
of the Fourier series of a one-dimensional function which is defined sufficiently 
smooth on a compact interval. The key concept behind it is that a supplementary 
function (or the boundary function) is used to force the residual part (or the inter­
nal function) of the original function to have the desired degree of smoothness 
when it is periodically extended onto the whole x-axis as described in Sec. 2.1. In 
this chapter, this convergence acceleration scheme will be extended to the gener­
alized Fourier series expansions of two-dimensional functions and their partial 
derivatives. The excellent convergence and accuracy of the resulting series expan­
sions are subsequently demonstrated using numerical examples.
8.1  STRUCTURAL DECOMPOSITIONS OF 
TWO-DIMENSIONAL FUNCTIONS
It should have been well understood by now that the convergence rate and the 
term-by-term differentiations of the Fourier series are closely related. Since this 
statement about one-dimensional functions is easily extendable to two-dimen­
sional functions, we will directly focus on the sufficient conditions for the term-
by-term differentiations as established in Chapter 6.
According to Theorems 6.2–6.6, the sufficient conditions for term-by-term 
differentiations actually only regulate the behaviors of the functions on the 
boundaries of the domain, specifically including four corners and two pairs of 
parallel boundary lines. Thus, we will correspondingly decompose a given func­
tion ( , )
u x y  into four parts:

where ϕ ( , )

u x y  at 
the corners, ϕ ( , )
1 x y  and ϕ ( , )
2 x y  are boundary functions coping with the potential 
jumps along the boundary lines, and ϕ ( , )
0 x y  is the internal function which is 
conditioned to have the desired smoothness after a periodic extension. The word 
“jumps” here shall be broadly understood as the deviations, if any, from the com­
plete satisfactions of, such as, (6.93)–(6.95), which is then deemed as a violation

of the sufficient conditions for legally performing the term-by-term differentia­
tions of the involved series expansions. Thus, the implications of jumps will vary 
with the specific form of the Fourier series.
The structural decompositions of a two-dimensional function ( , )

 is expanded into full-range Fourier 
series, then all the corner terms will vanish from the relevant formulas, such as

late the Fourier coefficients for the partial derivatives.

Fourier Methods in Science and Engineering
More explicitly, this internal function ϕ ( , )
0 x y  satisfies the sufficient condition 
laid out in Theorem 6.2 so that its Fourier series can be termwise differentiated 
up to 2r times.
The other four forms involve various half-range Fourier series expansions. As 
an example, we will use the fifth one to demonstrate the corresponding structural 
decomposition process.
We first define a corner function ϕ ( , )
3 x y  such that

The internal function ϕ ( , )
0 x y  obviously satisfies the sufficient condition laid out 
in Theorem 6.3 and its half-range sine-sine series is termwise differentiable up 
to 2r times.
The structural decompositions for the other half-range series forms are essen­
tially the same and will not be elaborated any further. It suffices to point out that 
although the sufficient conditions there are slightly different in forms, the process 
of decomposing a two-dimensional function into four constitutive parts is equally 
applicable.
8.2  THE GENERALIZED FOURIER SERIES EXPANSIONS 
FOR TWO-DIMENSIONAL FUNCTIONS
Based on the decomposition schemes described in Sec. 8.2, we will now specifi­
cally determine the corner functions, the boundary functions, the internal functions 
and the corresponding forms of the generalized Fourier series expansions for 
two-dimensional functions and their partial derivatives.

In the above discussions, the objective for performing the structural decomposi­
tion is primarily stated from the perspective of ensuring the involved series expan­
sions to be termwise differentiable up to 2r times. As evident from Theorem 2.3, 
the smoothness of a periodic (or, the periodically extended) function dictate not 
only the term-by-term differentiability, but also the convergence characteristic of 
its Fourier series expansion. Thus, we will view the above structural decomposi­
tions and the accompanying series expansion schemes as a general approach for 
improving the convergence and accuracy of the Fourier series approximations of 
the (two-dimensional) functions and their (partial) derivatives.

8.3  THE POLYNOMIAL-BASED GENERALIZED 
FOURIER SERIES EXPANSIONS
Thus far, we have completed a general framework for the simultaneous series 
expansions of a two-dimensional function and its partial derivatives. The primary 
difference between the generalized and the conventional Fourier series expansions 
is that three supplementary or conditioning functions are literally used to force the 
internal (or residual) function, and hence the corresponding series, to behave in 
certain ways or with the desired characteristics. In the above discussions, the basis 
functions

, and

ΦΦ
) are 
only required to be sufficiently smooth over a compact domain, without regulating 
them to any particular forms. This implies that there is actually a large (theoreti­
cally, an infinite) number of possible choices for such basis functions in the process 
of implementing the generalized Fourier series expansions.
In what follows, the simple polynomials given in Table 8.1 are specifically 
employed for the construction of the supplementary functions.
In comparison with the conventional Fourier series method, the polynomial-
based generalized Fourier series methods typically involve three kinds of basis

The Generalized Fourier Series of Two-Dimensional Functions
functions: pure trigonometric functions, pure polynomials, and the products of 
polynomials and trigonometric functions. Thus, it can be expected that the gen­
eralized Fourier series not only are able to retain the essences of the conventional 
Fourier series, but also have the reproducing property of complete polynomials 
of certain degrees.
Specifically, the reproducing property implies:
1.	the polynomial-based generalized full-range Fourier series is able 
to reproduce any two-dimensional polynomial of degree 2r over the 
domain

reproduce any two-dimensional polynomial of degree

b .
While the second case is easily verified, a comprehensive proof of the first case 
involves collecting together all the polynomials from the corner function, the 
boundary functions and the internal function in the polynomial-based general­
ized full-range Fourier series expansion. This process is understandably lengthy 
and tedious, and will not presented herein for the sake of compactness.

subsets: ϒI

domain, the sampling points on the boundaries (excluding the four corner points) 
and the sampling points at the corners, respectively. If γI t , γI I

the numbers of elements of

By replacing the set (of sampling points) ϒt in (8.142)–(8.144) with ϒI

we will have the correspondingly internal, boundary and corner errors to account 
for their spatial characteristics, as summarized in Table 8.3.
8.4.2  Convergence Characteristics
The above defined error indexes obviously depend upon the truncation num­
bers and convergence characteristics of the generalized Fourier series expan­
sions. The term convergence is originally associated with the decay rates of the 
Fourier coefficients as 
→∞ 
m
and/or →∞
n
. However, it is understandable that

the convergence characteristic can be assessed by using the error indexes, perhaps 
even more rigorously from a statistical point of view.
In the following calculations, the generalized Fourier series of the sample 
functions are successively truncated, in each direction, to the first 2, 3, 5, 10, 20, 
30, and 40 terms. By setting 
=
= 101

N
N

, the error indexes are then determined 
for different sets of sampling points and partial derivatives of various orders: 
= 0,1,
, 6

p
. The results are selectively presented in Figures 8.2 and 8.3.
It is seen from these plots that the overall, internal, boundary, and corner error 
indexes associated with the sample functions and their up to fifth order deriva­
tives all decrease nicely as the truncation numbers increases. The corner error 
with the fifth order partial derivatives has failed to converge for the generalized 
Fourier series (see Figure 8.2(d)); in comparison, the generalized sine-sine series 
still displays a decent trend of converging (refer to Figure 8.3(d)).
While the internal errors with the sixth order derivatives may be considered 
acceptable in both cases, their boundary and corner counterparts have clearly 
failed the convergence tests. It is generally observed that for the given p-th 
order derivatives, the error indexes for the corresponding partial sums tend to 
behave better in the interior region, and worst at the corners. While it may well 
be true that a function and its derivatives are better approximated at interior 
points, we here have no intention of proving or disproving it even though the 
adverse impacts of the potential discontinuities with higher order derivatives

The Generalized Fourier Series of Two-Dimensional Functions
are probably confined locally to the boundary areas. Besides, since the total 
error index is primarily dominated by the errors calculated at the interior sam­
pling points, it will typically conform to its interior counterpart.
It is also shown that the convergence of the half-range Fourier series appears 
to outperform its full-range counterpart in both cases by more than an order of 
magnitude. This is indeed true for the present setting 
=

half-range sine-sine series expansion of the function ( , )

8.4.3  The Accuracy of the Generalized Fourier Series
Once the convergence characteristic of the generalized Fourier series is well 
understood, we can now turn to another important issue: the numerical accuracy 
of the series approximations. Based on the excellent convergence as demonstrated

The Generalized Fourier Series of Two-Dimensional Functions
these two sample functions. It is evident that for the non-polynomial forms of basis 
functions, the corresponding expansion constants or coefficients are all virtually 
zero (smaller than 1.0E−13). In contrast, for the basis functions in the form of poly­
nomials, the corresponding constants or coefficients enable a complete reconstruc­
tion of the original sample functions, thus validating the polynomial reproducing 
property of the polynomial-based generalized Fourier series expansions.
It’s worthy of noticing that for the given setting of 
=

, the basis functions in 
the half-range sine-sine series expansion include not only the complete set of the 
polynomials of degree 5, but also a polynomial, x a

Next, we will use the trigonometric functions (No. 2 and No. 4 in Table 8.2) 
to examine the approximation errors associated with the generalized Fourier 
series (GFS) of these two functions and their partial derivatives. Presented in 
Table 8.6 are some of the results together with those for the conventional Fourier 
series (CFS) which are determined directly from the explicit expressions for 
these functions and their derivatives. Even though the errors for the derivatives of 
lower orders are not shown here, it suffices to point out that for the partial deriva­
tives of up to the fourth order, the overall-, interior-, and boundary-errors with

Fourier Methods in Science and Engineering
the corresponding generalized Fourier series are much smaller, by orders of mag­
nitude, than those with their conventional counterparts. Comparatively, however, 
the degrees of the differences in the corner errors are not equally remarkable, 
especially in the case of the full-range series expansions. For the fifth order partial 
derivatives, the generalized Fourier series are still, by at least an order of magni­
tude, better than the conventional Fourier series in terms of the overall-, inter­
nal- and boundary-errors. For the sixth order partial derivatives, all of the error 
indexes (overall, internal, boundary and corner) are of no significant difference 
between the generalized and conventional Fourier series. This shall not come as a 
surprise since the corner and boundary functions in the generalized Fourier series 
expansion can only ensure the C r
2

− continuity of the internal function when it is 
periodically extended onto the entire x–y plane. In other words, by setting 
=

6
r
, 
we have no intention of improving the smoothness of the derivatives of order 6 or 
higher (or equivalently, the convergence and accuracy of their generalized Fourier 
series). This statement itself, however, may not actually constitute a practical limit 
on the orders of derivatives for which the generalized Fourier series methods 
can be applied effectively. For instance, if better accuracies are desired for the 
derivatives of order 6 or higher, it can be achieved by setting 
≥

 so long as the 
original function ( , )
u x y  is sufficiently smooth in the domain.

Multiscale Fourier Series 
Methods for Linear 
Differential Equations
Effectively solving linear differential equations has long been an important topic 
in mathematics and mathematical physics. Various solution methods, including the 
Fourier series methods, have been developed for a wide spectrum of scientific and 
engineering problems which are described by linear differential equations subjected 
to appropriate boundary conditions. However, the basis functions used to construct 
solutions are often required to explicitly satisfy either the governing differential 
equation(s) or the boundary conditions, thus making the resulting solutions be case-
dependent. The generalized Fourier series expansions discussed in the previous 
chapters have potentially opened up a new avenue for the simultaneous approxima­
tions of a solution function and its related derivatives defined on a compact domain 
with the desired smoothness and accuracy. Therefore, if the generalized Fourier 
series are used to represent the solutions of boundary value problems, the solving 
processes will simply involve determining a specific set of expansion constants or 
coefficients so that the governing differential equation(s) and the boundary condi­
tions are simultaneously satisfied either exactly or approximately. In addition, the 
flexibilities offered in selecting the basis functions allow the developments of various 
implementation schemes to take fully advantages of the intrinsic characteristics of a 
particular class of problems.
9.1  THE GENERALIZED FOURIER SERIES SOLUTIONS OF 
ONE-DIMENSIONAL BOUNDARY VALUE PROBLEMS
Based on the structural decomposition schemes discussed earlier, the solution for 
a one-dimensional boundary value problem can be expanded into the generalized 
Fourier series in one of the three different forms as described below.

Fourier Methods in Science and Engineering
Again, the general solutions and the particular solution together have to satisfy 
the prescribed boundary conditions (9.48).
9.3  LIMITATIONS OF THE POLYNOMIAL-BASED 
GENERALIZED FOURIER SERIES METHODS
In Sec. 3.1, 7.3, and 8.3, polynomials were specifically used as the basis func­
tions in the generalized Fourier series expansions of several one- and two-
dimensional sample functions given in the polynomial and trigonometric forms. 
It has been demonstrated that the generalized Fourier series expansions do not 
only have the reproducing property of complete polynomials, but also are capa­
ble of simultaneously approximating functions and their (partial) derivatives 
of up to 2r-th order with excellent accuracy and convergence characteristics. 
However, the simple polynomials and trigonometric functions may not (always) 
be able to effectively capture or resolute the rapid spatial fluctuations or local 
behaviors of a function or solution. We will elucidate this point by considering 
a simple function below

where the parameter α0a is used to control the shape of this function. For instance, 
when α0a takes the values of 0.01, 1.00, 10.0, and 100 successively, it is seen 
from Figure 9.1 that this function can display quite different characteristics: for 
smaller values 0.01 and 1.00, the function spreads pretty evenly over the interval; 
as α0a further increases, its activities are clearly confined within a narrow region, 
exhibiting a strong boundary layer type of behaviors. If this function is expanded 
into the polynomial-based generalized half-range sine series by setting 
=
2
6
r
, 
the corresponding error indexes are plotted in Figure 9.2 as the functions of the 
truncation number M.
FIGURE 9.1  Sample functions with different values of parameter α a

195
Multiscale Fourier Series Methods for Linear Differential Equations
It is observed that for the smaller α0a values, 0.01 and 1.00, the polynomial-
based generalized sine series converges rapidly and approximates the function 
and its derivatives well with decent accuracies. Even for the case of α
=10
0a
 when 
the sample function descends down to zero very quickly, the polynomial-based 
generalized sine series still behaves satisfactorily in terms of the convergence and 
accuracy. For α
=100
0a
, the sample function starts to show some strong pres­
ence of the boundary layer on the interval [0, ]
a . Consequently, the approximation 
errors for the generalized half-range Fourier series become substantially higher, 
even though the trends of converging are still noticeable.
As in the previous cases, this example has again demonstrated the excellent 
convergence characteristics of the polynomial-based generalized Fourier series. 
However, it also has revealed that the numerical accuracies of the generalized 
series expansions can deteriorate meaningfully when the involved functions 
exhibit some strong local variations or multiscale behaviors. This calls for an 
alternative implementation scheme to make the generalized Fourier series method 
better suited to this type of multiscale problems.
As illustrated in this example, the multiscale characteristic of the func­
tion (9.57) is primarily dictated by the parameter α0a. In practical terms, the 
parameters which affect the behaviors of the solution of a given boundary

value problem are often of clear physical or geometrical meanings as defined 
in the governing differential equation(s) and/or the boundary conditions. 
Thus, if it is possible to include these parameters, explicitly or implicitly, 
in the basis functions in accordance with the inherent rules imbedded in the 
mathematical physics equations, we believe that the multiscale characteristic 
of the solution can be, at least, partially captured by the generalized Fourier 
series representation. This sets up a framework for transforming the general­
ized Fourier series method into the so-called multiscale Fourier series method 
as described below.
9.4  DETERMINATION OF THE GENERAL SOLUTION
In the above discussions, the solution of a boundary value problem is consid­
ered as the combination of the general solution(s) and the particular solution. In 
a two-dimensional case, the general solutions actually represent two independent 
components; each of them satisfies the same homogeneous form of the govern­
ing differential equation, but with different sufficient conditions to ensure the 
term-by-term differentiations of the generalized Fourier series expansions. In 
what follows, we will focus on how to find the general solutions for one- and two-
dimensional problems.
9.4.1  The General Solutions of One-Dimensional 
Boundary Value Problems
Without loss of generality, the general (or homogeneous) solution involved in the 
generalized full-range Fourier series solution over the interval −

the exponential form as

9.5  EQUIVALENT TRANSFORMATION OF THE SOLUTION
The generalized Fourier series was first introduced as a generic means to expand 
a sufficiently smooth function and its derivatives defined on a compact domain. In 
the previous sections, it was further developed into a general method for solving 
linear differential equations with constant coefficients.
In the context of solving linear differential equations, it appears from Sec. 
9.1 and 9.2 that the involved Fourier coefficients and expansion constants can 
be fully determined from forcing the solution to satisfy the differential equation 
and the boundary conditions such as (9.3) or (9.26). However, this may encoun­
ter difficulties with the use of a variational method, where the pre-satisfaction 
of the displacement type boundary condition is often required (for convenience, 
the term “displacement” is here simply used to denote the solution function even 
though it may actually represent other physically-different variables such as pres­
sure, temperature, etc.). Therefore, an equivalent solution transformation scheme 
will be derived in this section for the generalized Fourier series solution defined 
on the domain −

Even though the solution given by (9.139) still looks similar to its origin (8.91), the 
displacement-type boundary conditions have already been explicitly incorporated 
into the solution. In other words, the original Fourier coefficients associated with 
the boundary functions, ϕ ( , )
1 x y  and ϕ ( , )
2 x y , have been transformed into a new 
set of Fourier coefficients which are compatible with the prescribed displacement-
type boundary conditions.
9.6  INTRODUCTION OF THE SUPPLEMENTARY SOLUTION
It is intuitively understandable that the characteristic of the external force func­
tion f  can more or less affect the convergence and accuracy of the generalized 
Fourier series solution of a linear differential equation. Accordingly, the external

force function will be here decomposed into two parts: the coarse scale compo­

For example, consider the two-dimensional full-range series solution over the 
domain −

[

a a
b b . We select a suitable form of function ϕs such that
	
ϕ =

Thus, the differential equation (9.24) becomes

Solving the differential equation (9.145) together with the boundary conditions 
(9.146) completely falls into the context of the above discussions, and does not call

Evidently, the supplementary term ϕs is now added to the generalized Fourier 
series solution which originally consists of the boundary functions, ϕ1 and ϕ2, 
and the internal and corner functions, ϕ0 and ϕ3. Since the general solutions and 
the particular solution have already been used to label the relevant constituents 
of the solution of (9.24), the term ϕs will be here referred to as the supplementary 
solution as a distinction.
9.7  THE MULTISCALE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE SOLUTION
It must be emphasized that the decomposition of the solution into several con­
stituents is carefully formulated to warrant a desired convergence characteristic 
of the resulting Fourier series solution (of a differential equation or boundary 
value problem). As mentioned earlier, there is theoretically an infinite number of 
possible choices for the basis functions. This will give us the leeway to select the 
ones which better fit the particular problems on hand.
The multiscale capability of a solution method is of special interests to many 
scientific and engineering applications. As described in Sec. 9.6, the decompo­
sition of the solution into the boundary and internal components permits them 

208
Fourier Methods in Science and Engineering
to be determined independently. Further, the boundary functions are sought as 
the general solution of the differential equations or the characteristic functions in 
the different coordinate directions. Thus, it can be expected that such boundary 
functions or general solutions shall be able to more appropriately interpret the 
meaning of the differential equation, and hence better capture the spatial charac­
teristics of the solution in the corresponding coordinate directions. The use of the 
supplementary solution will be considered beneficial to the solution by removing 
glitches or irregularities from the forcing function.
With developing the multiscale capability in mind, we would like to evolve the 
structural decomposition of a solution function into a scale decomposition of the 
solution space. Take the generalized full-range Fourier series of a solution over 
the domain −
× −
[
, ] [
, ]
a a
b b  as an example. In the structural decomposition of the 
solution, the internal function ϕ ( , )
0 x y  is a two-dimensional Fourier series over 
the domain and corresponds to the primary scale (or medium scale) of the solution 
space. The boundary function ϕ ( , )
1 x y  is a one-dimensional Fourier series along 
the y-direction on the interval −
[
, ]
b b  and its Fourier coefficients are the homoge­
neous solutions of the ordinary differential equations with respect to the variable 
x, thus manifesting itself with two facets: the primary scale in the y-direction and 
an adaptive scale (or a hidden scale related to the original differential equation) in 
the x-direction. Similarly, the boundary function ϕ ( , )
2 x y  has the primary scale 
in the x-direction and an adaptive scale in the y-direction. The corner function 
ϕ ( , )
3 x y  is a two-dimensional polynomial over the domain −
× −
[
, ] [
, ]
a a
b b  and 
corresponds to the global scale (or large scale) of the spatial decomposition scales. 
The global (large) scale, the primary (medium) scale, and the adaptive (hidden) 
scale, when combined, represent a multiscale spatial decomposition of the solu­
tion of a given differential equation or boundary value problem. Accordingly, 
the particular solution (sum of the internal function ϕ ( , )
0 x y  and the corner func­
tion ϕ ( , )
3 x y ) with large and medium scales and the general solution (sum of the 
boundary functions ϕ ( , )
1 x y  and ϕ ( , )
2 x y ) with the adaptive scales shall be able 
to effectively resolve or capture the multiscale characteristic of the solution of a 
differential equation or boundary value problem. In the current structural decom­
position scheme, small scales have not been explicitly mentioned. However, 
regardless of whether such small scales are actually related to the adaptive scales 
or not, the inclusion of the supplementary solution is capable of alleviating this 
concern to some extent, as illustrated later by examples.
Based on what have been said, the generalized Fourier series solutions (or 
methods) will also be referred to as the multiscale Fourier series solutions (or 
methods) to emphasize their multiscale capabilities.
9.8  SOLUTION SCHEMES
By far, the multiscale Fourier series methods have been adequately discussed 
with respect to their convergence characteristics, approximation errors, and 
the selections of basis functions. We will now briefly talk about some of the 
specific techniques used for deriving the multiscale Fourier series solutions. 

209
Multiscale Fourier Series Methods for Linear Differential Equations
The solution techniques can typically be classified into three categories. The first 
category represents an analytical approach by directly comparing the Fourier 
coefficients of the like terms on both sides of the final system of equations. The 
second one is based on the weighted residual methods (for instance, the colloca­
tion methods), which still fall into the classification of strong-form solutions. The 
third one includes the variational methods (for instance, the minimum potential 
energy method), which lead to the so-called weak-form solutions.
These three approaches will be illustrated separately in the following chapters 
by solving several boundary value problems of broad concerns in science and 
engineering. The unknown solution variables corresponding to each category are 
listed in Table 9.1.

Multiscale Fourier 
Series Method for the 
Convection-Diffusion-
Reaction Equation
The convection-diffusion-reaction equation is one of the most studied subjects in 
mathematical physics. The convection-diffusion-reaction equation and its special 
cases (i.e., the convection-diffusion equation, the Helmholtz equation, the con­
vection-reaction equation, and the diffusion-reaction equation) are widely used 
to describe many physical and chemical processes (Hauke and Garcia-Olivares 
2001; Hauke 2002), such as, turbulences, combustions, heat transfers, diffusion 
of pollutants, propagations of acoustic waves, etc. The understanding of these 
natural phenomena and chemo-physical processes are often perplexed by, among 
others, the multiscale characteristics of the physical fields as manifested in, such 
as, the presence of swift transition between the exponential and the propagation 
regimes (Onate et al. 2006).
Many multiscale solution methods have been developed for the convection-
diffusion-reaction equation, which include the stabilized finite element methods 
(Huerta and Donea 2002; Huerta et al. 2002), the bubble methods (Brezzi et al. 
1998; Franca et al. 1998; Sangalli 2004; Parvazinia and Nassehi 2007), the wave­
let finite element methods (Dahmen et al. 1997; Dahmen 2001; Donea and Huerta 
2003), the meshless methods (Liu and Gu 2005), and the variational multiscale 
methods (Hughes and Wells 2005; Song et al. 2010). It is evident from their names 
that these multiscale methods are primarily based on the traditional mesh-based 
or other discretization methods by making some suitable modifications, such as: 
use of stabilization terms, inclusion of different scale groups, decomposition of 
the solution into coarse and fine scale components, etc. Although these multiscale 
methods have been applied to a variety of boundary value problems, we are still in 
the constant struggles with respect to the stability of the solution algorithms, proper 
selection of computational scales, robustness and effectiveness of the methods, bal­
ancing the span of scale groups and solution accuracy, high computational costs, 
and low numerical accuracy for higher order derivatives of field variables.
The multiscale Fourier series method described earlier potentially represents 
a strategic shift from the existing framework toward better resolving multiscale 
problems. In what follows, it will be specifically employed to solve the famous 
convection-diffusion-reaction equation for a wide spectrum of model variables.

10.2  ONE-DIMENSIONAL NUMERICAL EXAMPLES
The convection-diffusion-reaction equation will now be solved for various com­
binations of model parameters and boundary conditions. Table 10.3 shows the 
parameter setups in each of the test groups specifically used to evaluate the con­
vergence characteristics and accuracies of the multiscale Fourier series solutions. 
These parameters are typically related to either the physical process itself (such 
as those directly specified via the convection-diffusion-reaction equation and the 
boundary conditions), or the solution procedures (such as, the order of the inter­
polation polynomials, the approaches taken in deriving the discrete system equa­
tions, etc.). The tests in the first group are specifically used to investigate if and 
how the convergence characteristics of the multiscale Fourier series solutions are 
affected by the mathematical processes (e.g., the FCCM and the CM) employed 
in deriving the final systems. In the second test group, our attentions are focused

The Convection-Diffusion-Reaction Equation
on the effects of the orders of the interpolation polynomials used to approximate 
the source function. The third test group is dedicated to studying the impacts on 
the convergence characteristics of the model parameters (i.e., Pe and Da) of the 
convection-diffusion-reaction equation when the corresponding physical states 
vary from the strong reaction type to the reaction-dominated type, then to the 
convection-dominated type, and eventually to the strong convection type. Finally, 
in the fourth test group, we will consider the effects of the boundary conditions on 
the convergence characteristics of the multiscale Fourier series solutions.
In all these tests, the source function remains to be the same, and is given by 
the following third order polynomial

into the exact solution (of the convection-diffusion-reaction equation), which will 
be subsequently used as the reference in calculating the numerical errors associ­
ated with the solutions obtained in other ways.
10.2.1  Convergence Characteristics
The first case in group 1 is considered as the baseline in the convergence studies. 
The internal and boundary approximation errors of the function ϕ( )
x  and its first 
and second order derivatives are displayed in Figure 10.1 against the truncation 
number: 
=
M
 2, 3, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40.

Fourier Methods in Science and Engineering
With the increase of the number of terms retained in the multiscale Fourier 
series solution, the internal error of ϕ( )
x  decreases at an impressive speed. Take 
the error index 
ϕ
(
)
(0)
eI
M  at 
= 10
M
 for example. Each time the truncation number 
M is doubled, the error index is reduced approximately by an order of magni­
tude. In the meantime, it is interesting to notice that the boundary approximation 
ϕ
(
)
(0)
eB
M  is error-free or extremely small (below 1.0E−16), even for small trunca­
tion numbers.
The internal approximation of ϕ
( )
(1) x  also shows a decent improvement as 
the truncation number increases. Even though the convergence rate of ϕ
( )
(1) x  
has slowed down noticeably as compared with ϕ( )
x , 
ϕ
(
)
(1)
40
eI
 is still smaller than 
ϕ
(
)
(1)
10
eI
 by an order of magnitude. The internal approximation of ϕ
( )
(2) x  dete­
riorates furthermore, but still displays a satisfactory trending as the truncation 
number increases.
The boundary error of ϕ
( )
(1) x  reduces slowly with the truncation number: the 
error index is approximately equal to 1.0E−1 for 
= 10
M
, and keeps a trend of 
sustained decreasing to about 1.0E−2 for 
= 40
M
. In contrast, the boundary error 
with ϕ
( )
(2) x  is almost unaffected by the truncation number, indicating a possible 
failure of the multiscale Fourier series in approximating the boundary values of 
the second order derivative. However, this shall not be automatically perceived as 
problematic because the boundary conditions only involve with the derivatives of 
orders lower than that of the differential equation (i.e., 
=
2
2
r
 in the current prob­
lem); thus, examining the boundary error of the second order derivative perhaps 
represents an over-reach of the current solution.
The first test group is designated to compare the efficacy of the approaches, 
the FCCM and the CM, which are adopted in deriving the final system of discrete 
equations as discussed in Sec. 9.8. The convergence characteristics of the result­
ing multiscale Fourier series solutions are compared in Figure 10.2 (the FCCM 
results are actually the reproductions of those previously shown in Figure 10.1). 
It is observed that, while the convergence trends (or more explicitly, the conver­
gence rates) for both of them are very similar, the internal approximation errors 
with the FCCM solution are noticeably much smaller than their CM counterparts. 
In the meantime, the boundary errors are roughly the same for both solutions. 
Based on these observations, the FCCM-based solution method is here considered 
the preferred choice, and will be invariably used in the subsequent testing cases.
Now, we turn to the cases in the second test group to examine the effects of 
the orders of the polynomials used to interpolate the source function. The conver­
gence characteristics of the corresponding multiscale Fourier series solutions are 
presented in Figure 10.3.
It is seen that by using the interpolated source functions, the corresponding 
multiscale Fourier series solutions all have demonstrated remarkable improve­
ments over their counterparts obtained directly from the original source func­
tion over the entire solution interval (internal plus boundaries). In particular, the 
internal errors are considerably reduced with the increase of the order of the inter­
polation polynomials. While we don’t wish to speculate too much in regards to 
the possible reasons, the use of the interpolation polynomials will certainly help 

223
The Convection-Diffusion-Reaction Equation
improve the continuity of the (periodically extended) source function fp (refer 
to (10.34)), and hence the convergence of the Fourier series (10.35) and the final 
solution (10.56).
Perhaps, the significance of using the interpolated source function is more 
meaningfully manifested in the substantial reduction of the approximation errors 
both in the interior and boundary regions. Also, the degree of the improvement 
is seen to increase with the orders of the interpolation polynomials. Even though

the interpolation polynomials are originally introduced to better capture the mul­

multiscale Fourier series solutions ϕ( )
x  and ϕ

(1) x  are almost unaffected by the 
model parameters. In comparison, the approximation errors can vary consider­
ably, even by orders of magnitude, as the parameters change.
The convergence of the multiscale Fourier series of ϕ( )
x  and ϕ

(1) x  are con­
sidered very satisfactory at the boundaries of the solution domain. Moreover, the 
approximation errors of ϕ( )

for the case of

The final group of tests is focused on the effects of the boundary conditions.

onstrated in Figure 10.5 for two different types of boundary conditions. It is seen

The Convection-Diffusion-Reaction Equation
the convergence of the multiscale Fourier series solution ϕ( )
x  has become notice-
ably deteriorated over the entire solution domain. In particular, the boundary error 
ϕ
(
)
(0)
eB
M  increases from 1.0E−16 to 1.0E−2 at 
= 40
M
, but a trending of converging 
is still clearly presented. A similar deterioration is also observed for ϕ
( )
(1) x . In the 
meantime, the convergence characteristics and approximation errors of ϕ
( )
(2) x  are 
kind of insensitive to the specified boundary conditions throughout the solution 
domain; we can speculate, if we have to, that the “error” with ϕ
=

 has indis-
criminately spilled over the entire solution domain.
10.2.2  Computational Efficiency
To check on the computational efficiency, we will compare the multiscale Fourier 
series method with the bubble function method (Franca and Russo 1997) by solv-
ing this one-dimensional convection-diffusion-reaction problem. The third test 
group in Table 10.3 is used for the comparative studies. Two types of source func-
tions are considered:

= 40
M
, and the solution domain is divided into 100 uniform meshes 
in the bubble function method. Thus, the number of unknowns is 83 in the mul-
tiscale Fourier series method, and 101 in the bubble function method; that is, 
the final system in the multiscale Fourier series method is slightly smaller than 
that in the bubble function method. For convenience, the model parameters and 
the corresponding results are summarized in Table 10.4. It should be noted that 
the errors for both solution methods are calculated at the 10001 sampling points 
evenly distributed in the solution domain.
For each of the 8 cases, the CPU time is 2 seconds for the multiscale Fourier 
series solution in comparison with 49 seconds for the bubble function solution. It 
is true that the CPU times can actually be influenced by the programming skills 
and some other known/unknown factors. However, the increase of computational 
efficiency by almost 25 times should be considered meaningful by any measure.
In the meantime, the numerical accuracies of the multiscale Fourier series 
solutions are also observed far better, by orders of magnitude, than the reference 
(the bubble function) solutions. Besides, the multiscale Fourier series method has 
exhibited an excellent robustness and unity in dealing with different physical

states as dictated by the model parameters and/or source functions, in view of 
the fact that the bubble function method has actually failed in the last two cases. 
Thus, it is fair to claim that the multiscale Fourier series method has convincingly 
outperformed the bubble function method with respect to the computational effi­
ciency and numerical accuracy.
10.2.3  Multiscale Characteristics
In this section, we use a Green’s function type of source to amplify the mul­
tiscale behavior of the one-dimensional convection-diffusion-reaction equation 
and to examine if the multiscale Fourier series solution can react responsively 
and appropriately.
As shown in Figure 10.6(a), the source function is theoretically specified as
	
δ
=
−

( )
1000 (
0.5),
[0,1].
f x

(10.61)
In the numerical calculations, this Green’s function type of source function is 
approximated by a piecewise function. For instance, the source function can be 
treated as a rectangular impulse of width 2a2 and height 500/a2, and being zero 
elsewhere, as illustrated in Figure 10.6(b). Accordingly, as listed in Table 10.5, 
we will here consider two different solution schemes: the whole interval solu­
tion and the subinterval solution. In the whole interval solution scheme, the

 in the mul­

ϕ1, ϕ2, ϕ3, and ϕ4 accordingly. According to (10.56), the multiscale Fourier series 
solutions within the subintervals 1e , 2e , and 3e  are then respectively given, in terms

The Convection-Diffusion-Reaction Equation
Hence, we determine ϕ2 and ϕ3, the values of the solution at the intermediate 
end points, and eventually the solution function on each subinterval (or the entire 
interval [0,1]) by using (10.62)–(10.64).
In order to converge to the original solution for the Green’s function type of 
source distribution, the whole interval and subinterval solutions will potentially 
involve two different limit processes of 
→∞
M
 and 
→
+
0
2
a
, respectively.
The convergence characteristics of the solutions corresponding to these two 
limit processes are displayed in Figures 10.7–10.10 for different sets of computa­
tional parameters Pe and Da. The multiscale behaviors of the solutions are here 
exhibited in the forms of, such as, glitches, knife edges, sharp gradients, and 
other irregularities in the solution interval, especially at/near the center where the 
source is located.
For instance, in the case of 
= 3
Pe
 and 
= 90
Da
, a small glitch appears with 
ϕ
( )
(1) x  at the action point ( = 0.5

) of the source function. For

 and

a peak and a steep gradient are respectively observed for ϕ( )

After all four constituents, (10.80), (10.81), (10.100), and (10.105), become avail­

where the vectors of unknown constants q0 and q fs are directly related to the 
source function ( , )
f x y  and its interpolation polynomial 
( , )
f x y
s
, as per (10.111)–
(10.114) and (10.89). However, the vectors of unknown constants q1 and q2 will 
have to be determined from the prescribed boundary conditions.
10.4  TWO-DIMENSIONAL NUMERICAL EXAMPLES
In the following discussions, we will adopt an inverse process to validate the 
multiscale Fourier series solutions of the two-dimensional convection-diffu­
sion-reaction problems. Accordingly, a reference solution ϕ
( , )
x y
ref
 will first be 
constructed, and then substituted into (10.69) to determine a compatible source 
function. The boundary values of the solution and its relevant derivatives are also 
calculated at the boundaries in accordance with the types of boundary condi­
tions to be prescribed. With such information available, the solutions of such two-
dimensional convection-diffusion-reaction problems can be simply obtained by 
following the standard procedures as presented in the previous section.
As an example, the reference solution will be simply given as a linear combi­
nation of homogeneous solutions

It is easy to verify that the source function now vanishes identically

(10.117)
Accordingly, the order of the interpolation polynomial of the source function is 
set equal to zero. FCCM will be used to derive the final system of equations.
As presented in Table 10.8, four different test groups are designated for better 
understanding the impacts on the multiscale Fourier series solution of the key 
variables such as the model parameters, inflow angle, boundary conditions, and 
aspect ratio. For instance, in the first group of tests, we will focus on the influ­
ences of the model parameters Pe and Da, which measure the relative importance 
of the convection and reaction terms in the differential equation.

242
Fourier Methods in Science and Engineering
The intentions of other test groups are quite clear since only one variable is 
singled out in each group. The Dirichlet type of boundary condition refers to the 
situation when the value of the solution itself is directly prescribed along a bound­
ary line. In contrast, the Neumann type specifies the distribution of its normal 
derivative, such as ϕ
( , )
(1,0) a y  along =
x
a. In the third test group, three different 
boundary conditions, DDDD, DDND, and DNND, are taken into account (refer 
to Figure 10.11). It should be noted that the first case in each group actually rep­
resents the same test which is used as the reference.

10.4.1  Convergence Characteristics
As before, the convergence characteristics of the multiscale Fourier series solu­
tions are investigated by focusing on how the overall and regional (internal, 
boundary, and corner) errors of the solution ϕ( , )
x y  and its first order partial 
derivatives are affected by the selected truncation numbers: 
=
M
 2, 3, 5, 10, 20, 
30, and 40.
For the reference or baseline configuration, Figure 10.12 demonstrates that the 
multiscale Fourier series of ϕ( , )
x y  and its first order partial derivatives converge 
nicely both inside the solution domain, and on the boundaries. Although bound­
ary error index for ϕ
( , )
(0,1) x y  appears to be considerably larger than that for 
ϕ
( , )
(1,0) x y , their convergence rates are actually very similar, as indicated by the 
fact that the difference between these two error curves is almost unchanged. 
If the convergence of ϕ( , )
x y  is considered acceptable at the corners, the first order 
partial derivatives have clearly failed the convergence test.
It is evident from Figures 10.13 and 10.14 that the model variables can affect the 
multiscale Fourier series solutions in various ways. While the model parameters

The Convection-Diffusion-Reaction Equation
Pe and Da clearly have the marked effects on the convergence behaviors and 
approximation errors of the solutions, the impacts of the inflow angles are kind 
of considered intangible.
It is illustrated in Figure 10.15 that in terms of the numerical accuracy, the 
multiscale Fourier series solution is better suited for the DDDD boundary condi­
tion than the other two boundary conditions involving Neumann type specified, 
at least, along one boundary line.
Figure 10.16 shows the convergence behaviors of the multiscale Fourier series 
solutions as the aspect ratio /
a b varies from 0.5 to 2.0. It is observed that the solu­
tion errors are considerably larger for the two smaller aspect ratios. An immediate 
reaction to this is to increase the number of terms retained in y-direction so that 
the series expansion approximately has an equal spatial resolution in both x- and 
y-direction (e.g., setting 
=
/
2
N M
 for 
=
/
0.50
a b
). Indeed, this has immediately 
led to a significant reduction of the solution errors, as illustrated in Figure 10.17. 
However, this cannot fully explain why the solution behaves satisfactory for the 
case of 
=
/
2.0
a b
 in Figure 10.16. Consequently, we may have to attribute it to the 
disparity of the inflow angle ( π
=
/3) which has resulted in the biased distributions 
in the x- and y-direction.

10.4.2  Multiscale Characteristics
Based on (10.116) and Table 10.7, it can be expected that the (reference) solution 
will exhibit some peculiar behaviors when, by properly administering the model 
parameters such as Pe and Da, the convection-diffusion-reaction equation accord­
ingly goes through the transition from the strong reaction type to the strong con­
vection type. Take the cases in test group 1 as example. The spatial distributions 
of the reference solutions and the multiscale Fourier series solutions (obtained by 
setting 
=
= 40
M
N
) are displayed in Figures 10.18–10.21 sequentially for each

corresponding solution varies from simple oscillations to exponential decay, and 
eventually to the forming of boundary layers, a typical multiscale characteristic 
with a strong convection phenomenon.
In each of these cases, the excellent convergence and numerical accuracy of 
the multiscale Fourier series solution are repeatedly demonstrated by its close

good, as predominantly indicated by presence of the glitches or spikes at or near 
the edges and corners.

Bending of Thick Plates 
on Elastic Foundations
Solid mechanics, Elasticity, and Continuum Mechanics are the typical titles 
for the college courses and technical books in which the deformations of 
elastic bodies under various loading conditions are of primary concerns. This 
is perhaps the oldest scientific and engineering discipline, and has given rise 
to many classical boundary value problems such as the vibrations of stretched 
strings and membranes, and deformations of elastic bars, beams, and plates. 
In  the literature, there is a rich pool of studies about the elastic bending of 
rectangular plates with various complicating factors. In this chapter, we will 
focus on one special class of plate problems: bending of thick plates resting 
on an elastic foundation. This topic is of not only practical interests to many 
scientific and engineering fields, but also technical challenges to mathematical 
physics methods (Henwood et al. 1982; Shi et al. 1994; Rashed et al. 1999; 
Sun et al. 1999; Wen 2008) due to the intrinsic complexities (e.g., multiscale 
characteristics) of the subject matters.
11.1  DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM
In this section, we consider a thick plate of length a, width b and thickness h, rest­
ing on an elastic foundation. The deformations of the plate are described by the 
deflection of the mid-surface w, and its rotations 
x
β  and 
y
β  about y- and x-axis, 
respectively.
The upper surface of the plate is subjected to a transverse load q, and the lower 
surface to a reactive force qe from the foundation. A perfect contact (or no gap) 
is assumed to exist between the plate and the foundation, and the reactive force 
q x y
e( , ) is given in the bi-parametric form as

11.2  THE MULTISCALE FOURIER SERIES SOLUTIONS
The bending deformations of a thick plate resting on an elastic foundation are 
described by a fourth order ( rw =
2
4) linear differential equation for the transverse 
displacement and a second order ( r =
ψ
2
2) linear differential equation for the 
stress function. Moreover, since the system of equations includes only the solu­
tion functions and their partial derivatives of even orders, the transverse displace­
ment w x y
( , ) and the stress function 
x y
ψ ( , ) will be here sought in the forms of the 
half-range sine-sine series and the half-range cosine-cosine series, respectively.

The multiscale Fourier series solution will be solved using the energy method.
As listed in Table 11.2, four groups of numerical tests are designated for 
a comprehensive investigation of the convergence and accuracy of the multi­
scale Fourier series solution against some of the key model variables, such as, 
foundation parameters, thickness-to-length ratio, length-to-width ratio, and 
boundary conditions. In particular, the first group involves with varying the 
foundation parameters k

 in the fairly wide ranges 
from 1 to 106 and 1 to 2 × 103, respectively. The second test group is focused on 
the effects on the solution of the different thickness-to-length ratios, 0.1, 0.01, 
0.2, and 0.4, since the plates here are specially considered “thick.” In the third 
group, our attentions are focused on the influences of the length-to-width ratios : 
0.5, 0.67, 1.0, 1.25, and 2.0. Finally, the fourth group concerns three different 
boundary conditions applied to each edge of the plate: the generalized clamped 
boundary condition (CCCC), the generalized simply supported boundary con­
dition (SSSS), and the generalized free boundary condition (FFFF). In the pro­
cess of applying the boundary conditions, if the bending moments, the torsional 
moments, or the shear forces are involved in the prescribed boundary condi­
tions, their distributions can be directly substituted into (11.73) to determine the 
vector of the resultant forces 
pf
Q ; if the transverse deflection or the rotations 
are involved in the prescribed boundary conditions, their Fourier coefficients 
will be calculated first and then assigned to the corresponding sub-vectors of 
the solution vector 
R
q  in (11.74).

The first test in each group represents the baseline case: kr = 1, Gpr = 1, a b =
/
1, 
h a =
/
0.1, and the plate is clamped along each edge.
11.4.1  Convergence Characteristics
In the following examples, the convergence and approximation errors are care­
fully studied by successively truncating the multiscale Fourier series to M
N
=
= 
2, 3, 5, 10, 15, and 20.
The convergence characteristics (actually, the error indexes) of the obtained 
solutions are first presented in Figure 11.1 for the baseline configuration; in 
particular, both local and global approximation errors with some of the solution 
variables, such as, the deflection w, the rotations 
x
β  and 
y
β , and the bending 
moments Mx and My are carefully assessed using the grid (or check) points 
located in the corresponding regions. It is evident that the displacement con­
verges nicely over the entire solution domain. In comparison, however, the 
approximation errors have deteriorated significantly for other solution variables 
like the rotations and the bending moments which involve the derivatives of the 
displacement function (the rotations and bending moments can be roughly con­
sidered to be linearly dependent upon the first and the second order derivatives

of transverse deflection, respectively). Besides, the errors tend to increase as the 
checking points move from the internal region to the boundaries, or from the 
boundaries to the corners.
As illustrated in Figure 11.2, the foundation parameters kr and Gpr can influ­
ence the solutions substantially, even by orders of magnitude, in terms of the 
convergence and approximation errors. Accordingly, we may indulge ourselves 
in speculating that as these two key physical parameters vary considerably, the 
behavior of the plate-foundation system has experienced some swift transitions 
from one state to another.
Figures 11.3 and 11.4 shows that except for h a
/
 = 0.4, the convergence and 
accuracy of the solutions are relatively insensitive to the plate geometries, such as, 
the thickness-to-length and length-to-width ratios. While it is noticeable that the 
convergence curves for different length-to-width ratios have more or less drifted 
away from each other (see Figure 11.4), we like to attribute this to the disparity of 
the spatial resolutions of the series expansion in the x- and y-direction.
In comparison with other model parameters, the adjustment of boundary con­
ditions appears to have more remarked effects on the convergence and accuracy 
of the multiscale Fourier series solutions. It is seen from Figure 11.5 that the 
transverse deflections can be satisfactorily calculated with only a small number

of terms included in the series solutions. The rotation 
x
β  and moment Mx can also 
be obtained with decent accuracy. While the convergences of the deflection, rota­
tion, and moment solutions are all considered great for the generalized clamped 
boundary condition (CCCC), the same cannot be said about the other two bound­
ary conditions. Since the rotations and the moments are respectively related to the 
first and second order derivatives of the transverse deflection, it is understandable 
that the convergences of the resulting solutions will accordingly deteriorate with 
the orders of the involved derivatives.
It should be added that for a specific boundary condition the selection of the 
most suitable form of Fourier series expansion is very important to the quality of 
the solution. For instance, for the clamped boundary condition, both the transverse 
displacement and rotations vanish along an edge, the corresponding supplemen­
tary terms will thus become unnecessary. However, the use of the Fourier cosine-
cosine series will be able to ensure the displacement to have the C2 continuity (in 
comparison, only C1 continuity for the Fourier sine-sine series). As discussed in 
Chapter 4, for the FFFF boundary conditions, a better performance of the solution 
can be expected if the displacement and the stress function are expanded into the 
generalized Fourier cosine-cosine and sine-sine series, respectively.
11.4.2  Multiscale Characteristics
As shown in Figure 11.2, the convergence and accuracy of the multiscale Fourier 
series solution are quite sensitive to the foundation parameters kr and Gpr. Among 
the possible reasons, we are particularly interested in knowing if this elastic sys­
tem actually exhibits a multiscale characteristic as the model parameters are in 
the neighborhoods of certain “critical” values. Specifically, by fixing kr = 104, 
we select the several different values for the parameter Gpr: 160, 170, 180, 190, 
and 300. By truncating the series expansions to M
N
=
= 20, the corresponding 
results for some primary solution variables are presented in Figures 11.6–11.10. 
It is clearly demonstrated that as the model parameter Gpr increases, the plate 
deformations and other relevant physical variables have accordingly undergone a 
transition from the relatively even wave-like oscillations into the boundary-layer 
type of multiscale distributions.
While the displacement solution generally compares well with the reference, 
the physical variables involving the derivatives (especially, those of higher orders) 
are relatively less accurate as manifested in the spikes at or near the edges or 
corners. Such approximation errors are considered as the direct results of the 
reduced degree of smoothness of the corresponding variables, and believed to be 
more locally confined to the boundary regions. In some cases, this kind of errors 
may be diminished by artificially boosting the smoothness of the involved solu­
tion variables. However, in view of the fact that the smoothness of the primary 
variable(s) within the solution domain is usually dictated by the physical process 
itself (or more explicitly, the order of the governing differential equation), this 
may not always be a viable option; instead, we will resort to increasing the num­
ber of the terms included in the series expansions if a better solution is desired.

Wave Propagation in 
Elastic Waveguides
The study of wave propagation in an elastic waveguide represents a specific aspect 
of the century-old research interest in the vibrations of bars, beams, plates, shells, 
and other shapes of solids. The waveguides refer to a class of elastic bodies which 
have neighboring parallel surfaces. The waves propagating in a waveguide will 
thus interact (in the forms of, such as, reflections, refractions, and diffractions) 
with the parallel boundaries, causing dispersions, partial mode conversion, or 
other complicating effects. The waves traveling in a waveguide is typically the 
superposition of many independent wave modes, and each of them has its unique 
characteristic and will react to geometrical and physical features or irregulari­
ties differently. While this tends to make the process much more complicated 
and difficult to understand, this phenomenon can potentially reveal a wealth of 
information about these features for the purpose of detection or interrogation. 
The wave propagation in waveguides has found broad applications in engineering 
(Miklowitz 1966) in the fields of, such as, non-destructive testing, vibration con­
trol, detection of defects or damages in mechanical systems and civil infrastruc­
tures, and in geophysics and seismology (Bullen 1963) for better understanding 
the earthquake phenomena and nuclear detection problems.

Basically, (12.44) tells that only six of the 12 undetermined constants are actually 
independent.
It must be noted that the transformation matrix 
1 1
n
T
 in (12.47) is derived from 
(12.40) and (12.42) and is specifically suitable for the case of 
0
1
∆>
 and 
0
2
∆>
. 
For the other three possible cases, the expressions for the transformation matrix 
1 1
n
T
 will have to be modified accordingly.

side into the Fourier series, and then compare the Fourier coefficients of the 
like terms on the both sides. Suppose that all the series expansions are trun­

12.3  SOLVING FOR SOLUTIONS
Based on the discussions in the previous section, it is evident that the multiscale 
Fourier series solutions given by (12.135) have already satisfied all the differential 
equations which govern the propagations of elastic waves in a rectangular wave­
guide. If the series solutions are respectively truncated to 
=
m
M  and =
n
N  in the 
x- and y-direction, there is a total of 12
12
15
+
+
M
N
 undetermined expansion 
coefficients in q. If the collocation method is used to derive the final system of 
equations, we need to select an adequate number, such as 12
12
15
+
+
M
N
, of col­
location points on the boundaries. By equating the displacements (12.135) and/or 

301

the stresses (12.136) to the prescribed values at each collocation point, a system of 
12
12
15
+
+
M
N
 homogeneous linear algebraic equations will be obtained about 
the expansion coefficients. Letting the determinant of the coefficient matrix be 
equal to zero, we thus yield a transcendental equation (often referred to as the fre­
quency equation) which regulates the relations between the frequency ω  and the 
wavenumber k . For instance, given a frequency, the frequency equation dictates 
that only the waves associated with the permissible wavenumbers can propagate 
in the waveguide. As the frequency changes, the wavenumbers will vary accord­
ingly to form the so-called dispersion curves. In the ω –k  plane, the frequency 
equation can lead to uncountable branches of the dispersion curves, and each of 
them corresponds to a cross-sectional deformation pattern or wave mode in the 
waveguide. The intersecting points of the branches and the ω -axis represent the 
cut-off frequencies.
As in studying the transverse vibrations of rectangular thin plates (Huang 
1992), symmetric decomposition of the wave modes will be performed herein 
against the symmetry of the applied boundary conditions.
For instance, as shown in Figure 12.2(a), the boundary condition (CCFC) for 
the rectangular waveguide is symmetric about the x-axis. Thus, the wave modes 
can be decomposed into two types: the longitudinal wave (L) and the bending 
wave (Bx) about the x-axis. Specifically, for the family of longitudinal waves, the 
displacements u, v , and w are respectively even, odd and even with respect to y. 
For the family of bending waves, the displacements u, v , and w are respectively 
odd, even and odd with respect to y.
In the meantime, the other two boundary conditions, FFFF and FCFC, in 
Figure 12.2 are simultaneously symmetric about the x- and y-axis. Therefore, 
the wave modes can be decomposed into four types: the longitudinal wave (L), 
the torsional wave (T ), and two bending waves (Bx and By) about the x- and y
-axis, respectively. In particular, for a square cross-sectioned waveguide, the first 
two types of waves with FFFF boundary condition can also be decomposed into 
the symmetric waves (Ts, Ls ) and asymmetric waves (Ta, La) with respect to the 
line

The numbers of unknown constants involved in the frequency equation are 
summarized in Table 12.2 for various types of wave modes. It should be noted that 
since

12.4  NUMERICAL EXAMPLES
As shown in Table 12.3, we have designated two groups of numerical tests to 
investigate the influences of some key factors, such as the side ratio b a/  and 
boundary conditions, on the convergence characteristics and approximation accu­
racies of the multiscale Fourier series solutions for the current wave propagation 
problems. In the first group, by fixing the boundary condition to FFFF, the side 
ratio varies from 0.5 to 2.0 with three intermediate steps 0.67, 0.50, and 1.25. The 
second group of tests is used to examine the effects of the boundary conditions 
whilst the side ratio is fixed to b a/
1.0
=
.
In all these tests, the Poisson’s ratio is set to 
0.3
υ =
. Additionally, the results 
are presented in terms of the non-dimensional wave frequency Ω and wavenum­
ber K :

First of all, the baseline case (the first test in Table 12.3) will be used to exam­

The corresponding results for the first order dispersion curves and the prediction 
errors for the various branches of dispersion curves over 
[0,1]
∈
K
 are presented 
in Tables 12.4 and 12.5, respectively.
The first branches of dispersion curves for various types of mode waves con­
verge consistently with the increase of the truncation numbers M  and N . For 
the dispersion curves 
1Ls , 
1
Ta , and 
1
Bx, the error indexes rapidly descend to about 
4.0E−3 when only 4 terms are retained in the series expansions. For the other 
two dispersion curves 
1La and 
1
Ts , the errors are relatively larger at about 4.0E−2 
for 
4
=
=
M
N
. In regards to the convergence characteristics, however, all these 
dispersion curves have displayed an impressive trend: as the truncation number is 
quadrupled to 16, the corresponding errors are all reduced approximately by an 
order of magnitude.
Noticeably, the current dispersion curves for 
1Ls , 
1
Ta , 
1
Bx agree well with the 
reference results (Fraser 1969), but significant differences are observed between 
the dispersion curves for 
1La and 
1
Ts . These deviations may be attributed to the 
disparity in selecting the forms of the basis functions because the basis functions 
used by Fraser are actually the analytical solutions for the wave propagations

in waveguides with a circular cross-section, rather than the rectangular cross-
section herein.
Next, we will investigate the effects of the side ratio by varying it from 0.5 to 
2.0, as specified in the first test group in Table 12.3. For conciseness, only the dis­
persion curves for 
1
Bx are presented in Table 12.6. It is seen that as the truncation 
number increases from 4 to 16, the calculated frequencies for the wave mode 
1
Bx 
have demonstrated consistent convergence characteristics in all these five cases.
The second test group is designated to investigate the impacts of the bound­
ary conditions by considering two more cases, as illustrated in Figure 12.2: free 
at two opposite edges and clamped at the other two (FCFC), and free at one edge 
and clamped at other three (CCFC). The corresponding results are presented in 
Tables 12.7 and 12.8.

Wave Propagation in Elastic Waveguides
Again, an excellent convergence characteristic is observed in both cases for all wave 
types: the solution errors are reduced, at least, by an order of magnitude as the truncation 
numbers increase from 4 to 16. It should be emphasized that this remark is insensitive 
to the boundary conditions, which may easily become an important merit of the current 
multiscale Fourier series method in contrast to other mostly BC-specific methods.
12.5  WAVE PROPAGATIONS IN A SQUARE WAVEGUIDE
In this section, some important aspects, such as frequency spectra and wave 
modes, of wave propagation in a square waveguide are investigated by using the 
multiscale Fourier series method. In the following calculations, the multiscale 
Fourier series solutions are invariably truncated to

12.5.1  Frequency Spectra
Wave propagation in a square waveguide is considered for three different boundary 
conditions: FFFF, FCFC, and CCFC. The frequency spectra for several selected 
mode waves are plotted in Figures 12.3–12.5. It is seen that the whole suite of the 
dispersion curves can be well predicted for all these wave types and boundary 
conditions considered, except that the small segments of dispersion curves for 
3La 
and 
4
La are missing in the region 
[0.43,0.60]
∈
K
 in the FFFF case. As shown in 
Figure 12.3(b), this blind region is roughly bounded by the two points where the 
dispersion curves for 
3
La and 
4
La intersect with each other.

12.5.2  Wave Modes
The dispersion curves regulate which wave modes are permissible to travel down 
the waveguide. Additionally, for any given point on a dispersion curve, the cor­
responding wave mode is fully specified with respect to its deformation charac­
teristic. For instance, presented in Tables 12.9–12.17 are the deformation patterns 
for several wave modes of various types and orders.

These plots carry some important information about the characteristics of the 
wave modes. However, it is not our intention here to try to fully comprehend the 
deformation patterns and their practical implications. Instead, the reason that they 
are exhaustively presented here is to demonstrate the potential complexities of the 
wave modes with respect to deformation patterns, dispersion behaviors, and the

strong dependences on the boundary conditions, and to validate the usefulness 
and robustness of the multiscale Fourier series method as well.
The one-dimensional structural models, such as the longitudinal and torsional 
vibrations of rods, the transverse vibrations of beams, etc., are mostly based on 
the hypothesis that the cross-section of a rod or beam remains to be planar in the 
process of deformation. It is seen from Tables 12.9–12.11 that this planer hypoth­
esis is only roughly valid for the wave modes corresponding to the first branches 
of the dispersion curves (such as, the 
1Ls , 
1
Ta , and 
1
Bx waves), when propagating 
at small wavenumbers in a waveguide with the FFFF boundary condition. More 
specifically, as shown in Table 12.9, for the small wavenumber 
0.1
=
K
, the domi­
nant component of the displacements in the 
1Ls  wave is in the longitudinal (z-) 
direction, namely the out-of-plane displacement w. In the same time, within the 
cross-sectional area the values of the out-of-plane displacement are almost the 
same and axially symmetric; that is, the cross-section remains planer. Similarly, 
it is observed from Table 12.10 that for 
0.1
=
K
, the 
1
Ta  wave basically still keeps 
the cross-section to be planar (with some minor out-of-plane warping) and the 
in-plane motion is mainly a cross-section rotation about the z-axis. Moreover, 
as shown in Table 12.11, for 
0.1
=
K
 the out-of-plane displacement w of the 
1
Bx 
wave varies linearly with the distance from the neutral axis (namely, the x-axis). 
During this deformation, the cross-section rotates about the x-axis and is still 
kept as a plane.
As the wavenumber increases, the wave modes, even those correspond to the 
lower order branches of dispersion curves, tend to become more complicated in 
terms of their deformation patterns. The wave modes corresponding to the higher 
order branches of dispersion curves are typically complicated in deformation pat­
terns, regardless of whether the wavenumbers involved are actually small or not. 
Particularly, sharp edges, steep gradients or other near-singular behaviors start to 
show up as a typical multiscale behavior.
