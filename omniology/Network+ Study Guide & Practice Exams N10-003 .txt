Foreword 
networking and prepare you for the Network+ exam. It also will prepare you for the 
networking industry if you are not already a part of it. 
Passing the exam is no easy feat, but it is not impossible either. With the proper 
motivation, study habits, and effort, you can pass this exam on the first attempt. This 
book was assembled to provide you with all the tools you need to pass and obtain this 
credential by focusing material presented against every posted Network+ objective.All 
authors have taken the new Network+ exam; some even took the first beta ever pre- 
sented. Some of the authors have even worked directly with and for CompTIA to help 
develop its exam content. Because of this experience, you simply won't find another 
study guide that prepares you quite like this one; the book's focus is from the perspec- 
tive of authors who were themselves trained by CompTIA.All objectives are covered 
in detail, and you are tested on all concepts at the end of each chapter in the Self-Test 
sections. 
So it's all up to you; we provide you with the tools, but you are the mechanic. 
Build yourself up to take and pass the exam with our help. Besides earning the 
Network+ credential, there are other benefits of reading this book; you will gain a 
wealth of knowledge from clearly written definitions, terms, explanations, exercises, 
and question items written by leading authors and proven specialists in the information 
technology (IT) industry. This book was written by experts following strict guidelines 
to bring you the best guide possible to learn from and pass the Network+ exam. Let's 
take a look at what makes up the Network+ exam. 
What Is Network+? 
More than half a decade ago, CompTIA released the first version of Network+ on 
April 30, 1999. Following the success of the A+ credential and since then, it has gone 
through multiple transformations and updates to the current version, the version this 
book covers. The 2005 objectives have been recently updated to remove old legacy 
information on the exam that no longer is important. Just like networks themselves, 
things get old, stagnant, and need updating. The older information has been replaced 
with new material that meets today's testing needs, such as moving testable questions 
from the limit of knowing Fast Ethernet to the new standards, Gigabit Ethernet and 
10 Gigabit Ethernet. This is just one example of the path the exam takes and how you 
need to navigate it. If you were studying for any test before 2005, this exam guide is 
still pertinent, as 90% of the old material is still covered. Newer material is seeded in, 
and items have been updated. The new objectives update the Network+ exam on new

technologies such as wireless networking and security technologies, keeping it current 
with the networking industry itself. 
If this study guide is used correctly, you will also gain the Network+ credential, 
which is accredited in other popular certification programs today such as the 
Microsoft-based MCSE (Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer) and the Novell CNE 
(Certified Novell Engineer). Moreover, anyone embarking on a career in "networking" 
moving on to more advanced curricula and credentials such as the Cisco CCIE (Cisco 
Certified Internetworking Expert) will benefit greatly from starting with the 
Network+ credential from CompTIA. Any way you look at it, if you are interested in 
local and wide area networking, Network+ is a great place to start. 
Successfully passing the CompTIA Network+ exam and understanding everything 
learned prepares you to successfully embark in the networking field and feel confident 
that you have learned the "basics of networking." In sum, the Network+ credential 
(and exam) makes sure that you, the candidate, are prepared to enter the world of net- 
working with provable skills and knowledge. If the credential doesn't prove it, perhaps 
the book will give you the experience you need to get those skills so that you can 
enter the workforce. Either way, Network+ is a winning certification with a lot of 
great industry backing, especially from the program's creators and managers, 
CompTIA.org. 
About CompTIA 
CompTIA (Computing Technology Industry Association), an association located at 
www.comptia.org, is one of the leaders in the certification arena today, especially in 
the entry-level certification market. Starting with the well-known A+ credential, 
CompTIA has paved a path to certifying not only entry-level PC technician skills but 
also networking, home automation, security, and Web design. The CompTIA 
Network+ exam has become the leading entry-level network certification available 
and has enjoyed some of the same success as CompTIA's flagship certification, A+. It 
has also been around for almost half a decade as of the publishing of this book and 
continues to be updated and made better each time it is reexamined by CompTIA and 
its panel of subject matter experts, or SMEs. Network+ is also highly recognized in the 
industry. As part of many training centers' education program offerings, Network+ is 
one of the hottest certifications you can obtain today, especially if you are new to the 
networking world and need to master the fundamentals. 

xxxviii Foreword 
About the Book 
The Network+ exam is thoroughly covered in this book. From every detail about how 
to get ready for test time all the way down to "full coverage" of the exam content and 
ways to prepare for the Network+ exam, it's all covered in this book and the Syngress 
Publishing Web site.Your book was also written by experts. In addition to being 
experts in writing and editing, the authors also are sought-after technology experts 
who work daily in the trenches of real-word networks~they design, manage, imple- 
ment, and secure networks. The authors of this book have lived through all the tech- 
nology listed in not only the Network+ objectives but also from a great many vendors 
of technology, such as Cisco, Microsoft, and Novell. The authors' biographies within 
this book show that this book was written by well-known published writers and full- 
time networking professionals, concentrating in the fields of network analysis, engi- 
neering, architecting, designing, implementing, and managing. The authors exemplify 
Network+ certified. 
The book was written in a way to map directly to the CompTIA Network+ 
testable objectives. It gives you, the reader, a way to follow how CompTIA laid out the 
exam, learn the technology, and then focus on what is testable. The test questions at 
the end of each chapter also cover the essential information you need to pass the 
exam. Both elements combined give you a nice education on the technology, as well as 
a way to focus on how you will see the same material tested on the exam. 
The exam is not hard, but it covers a lot of ground, and that is where the difficulty 
may come in for you. The exam also doesn't try to trick you; the questions are rather 
straightforward, but you may find yourself making mistakes you may have been able to 
avoid if you had read the questions more carefully. Remember, you are not in a rush; 
make sure you gauge your time so that you don't waste it or run out, but remember 
that if you prepared properly (with this study guide), then you should be able to move 
through the exam fairly rapidly (and carefully) and pass it on your first attempt. 
Network+ Objectives 
The new Network+ exam covers an updated set of objectives and has replaced the old 
Network+ exam as of the first quarter of 2005. Current holders of the CompTIA 
r

Network+ certification will not need to take the new version of the test in order to 
retain their certification, as all of CompTIA's certifications are valid for life. 
The objectives also broaden the scope somewhat, placing more emphasis on Linux 
as a viable networking operating system (NOS) and including AppleTalk as a network 
protocol. Although both Linux and AppleTalk have been covered on older versions of 
the exam, the topics have been refreshed to today's standards where Apple and Linux- 
based technologies are playing more and more of a role on many networks today. 
Because Novell and many other vendors are leaning very hard on using Linux 
(Novell's purchase of Germany-based SUSE, for example), it's important that it's cov- 
ered in this book.You will see more and more of Linux as you progress in your work 
as a network technician. Moreover, once installed, Linux has a plethora of freeware 
tools that you can use (and will start to learn about in this book) to help you isolate 
and find problems on your network. So, in essence, lust installing Linux will give you a 
new set of troubleshooting tools you may not have even known about--and this topic 
will be covered in depth in this study guide.You will learn about tools that run on 
Linux that will help you to manage your network; most of them are free or offered at 
very low cost. 
The CompTIA Network+ objectives are laid out very similar to the older exams 
with minor updates. CompTIA sets the exam up into four separate 
categories: 
• 
Media and Topologies 20% 
• 
Protocols and Standards 25% 
• 
Network Implementation 23% 
• 
Network Support 32% 
The list in the following section lust gives you an idea on some of what is 
expected of you as you read the book and prepare for the exam. 
Media and Topologies 20% 
You will need to know common media and topologies found on any typical 
or commonly seen network, local and wide (LAN and WAN). 
• 
Understand the basic differences between Ethernet, Fast Ethernet, and 
Gigabit Ethernet. 

xl 
Foreword 
• 
Understand and know the common types of Media such as 10BaseT, 
10Base2, 10BaseS, 100BaseTX, 100BaseFx, and Gigabit. as well as 10 Gigabit 
Ethernet. 
• 
What is Token Ring and FDDI? Knowing about these older or uncommon 
RAng-based topologies is still needed for the exam. Other older technologies 
also need to be covered in little details (such as knowing 10Base2 or 
10BaseFL; most times, you will not use these, but they are still out there en 
masse, unbelievably). 
• 
What is the backbone segment of a network and what is commonly used at 
the location? Do you know the difference between a Bus backbone and a 
Star backbone? 
• 
You need to know wireless, especially the 802 committee standards such as 
802.11 b, 802.1 la, and 802.1 lg, and hardware such as Access Points and so 
on. 
• 
Lastly, you must have a very solid understanding of switches, routers, hubs, 
bridges, firewalls and others such as IDS and the convergence of all of these 
devices into today's product offerings. 
Protocols and Standards 25% 
• 
TCP/IP was a Department of Defense (DoD) research project used to con- 
nect a number different networks designed by different vendors (or govern- 
ment agencies) into a single network of networks (called the "Internet"). To 
pass this exam, you will need to know TCP/IP fundamentals inside and out. 
• 
You need to memorize the OSI and DoD models and what protocols in 
each protocol suite map to each layer of each stack. 
• 
You need to also know port numbers such as HTTP (port 80), FTP (port 
21), and SMTP (port 25). Others will be covered in the study guide. 
Network Implementation 23% 
In this section of the exam you will receive questions on how to handle a 
particular situation or scenario. 
www.syngress.com 

Foreword 
xli 
• 
Make sure you cover "how to" in this section. In the book you will get many 
exercises on how to configure protocols and so on; this material needs to be 
known for the exam. Windows, Novell, Linux, and so on are covered in the 
objectives. 
Network Support 32% 
• 
In this section of the exam you will be tested on how you support your net- 
work; this would include documentation, polices, and procedures. 
• 
You will also need to know how to support your network via a plethora of 
troubleshooting tools on multiple platforms. 
• 
Tools to focus on would be ping, ifconfig, winipcfg, ipconfig, nslookup, 
tracert, pathping, and so on.You must also know the "switches" used such as 
ping-a produces a different result than just using ping with a switch. 
Network+ Study Tactics 
There are quite a few things you should strategize about while preparing for the 
CompTIA Network+ exam.You should plan your studies around things such as your 
current experience and knowledge level, your available study tools, and your motiva- 
tional focus, how well you prepare for exams in general. 
Let's begin by discussing the needed study plan you will want to use or develop to 
pass this exam because just as you need a solid methodology to troubleshoot a net- 
work, you should also have a similar type of plan constructed for taking this exam. 
It's very important that you fully prepare for the exam by studying correctly. Make 
sure that you do your due diligence when it comes to preparation; you are only going 
to cheat yourself if you don't. Try to set time aside each night to prepare properly by 
reading and working through the testable objectives in your mind, making sure you 
master the basics of each one so that you know what is expected of you come test 
time. 
Now, lay out a study plan that fits into your time schedule, as well as a study loca- 
tion.Your study location is very important for preparation. A nice quiet place with few 
distractions is ideal for studying. Ask loved ones to give you some time alone, take the 
phone off the hook, or do whatever it takes to get some quality study time set aside so 
that you can prepare properly.

Foreword 
If you can, use a test system or build a test lab. A single PC or a dual-PC lab can 
really help you to practice and follow along with the exercises.Anything else you may 
have or be able to get (such as a hub, any cables, or connectors) will help as visual aids. 
Many questions on the Network+ exam expect you to know what things look like. 
Experience helps, but is not mandatory. Some experience can be found in your 
lab; much of your true troubleshooting experience on full-sized networks will not.The 
more experience you have, the easier it will be for you to understand and digest the 
material.You will also learn how to use multiple types of tools on different systems. 
You will need to know multiple systems for this exam, so a lab can really help you 
gain the experience you need. It's strongly recommended. The exercises listed in the 
study guide are easy to follow and show you, step-by-step, what actions are being 
taken. 
Don't underestimate the exam! Although in most cases the Network+ exam is 
considered fair, it can be tricky in some areas if you do not study. 
How to Obtain Network+ 
To obtain the Network+ credential, you have to take and pass the CompTIA 
Network+ exam. There are no electives needed to take this exam. To take the exam, 
you can pay and register online or by phone. From each test provider's Web site, you 
can get up-to-date pricing information, as well as information about up-to-date, 
detailed information about the exam, such as the number of questions, time allotted, 
where in your area you can take the exam, and so on. The best way to prepare for the 
exam is to log on to the site, get all the way up to having to commit to taking the 
exam so you can read all the content about the exam without having to commit until 
you are ready. Between this and ensuring you visit the Network+ section of the 
CompTIA Web site, you are sure to have all the current information you need to be 
able to guide you in obtaining the Network+ credential. 
Exam Day Experience 
The CompTIA Network+ exam should be taken when you are ready; that is, after you 
have properly studied and reviewed all the material. Again, do not underestimate this 
exam, but don't overprepare for it either. The book covers all the testable material in a 
way that gives examples, tests you, and drives home points. By researching points 
online, you will also help to build up your knowledge. There is no escaping the posted 
objectives. Attack them as this book does, and you will be prepared. 

Foreword

The exam should be taken where you are comfortable. Dress comfortably and 
bring the right materials with you (proper identification, writing utensil, your test con- 
firmation number in case there is a problem), and do not be late. Remember, you are 
helping no one if you rush or skim through the material. 
The exam will have questions much like Microsoft's exams.You now have scenario 
questions.The Network+ questions are more straightforward. Straightforward does not 
mean "easy"; it just means that there are no 250-word scenarios.You won't need a 
scrap of paper to map out entire network topologies. It's much more to the point. 
Remember, this is a basic entry-level exam; the questions are made to be direct and 
expect a direct answer.

Chapter 1 • Network Fundamentals 
Introduction 
Networks have been around for many years, long before the first home computer was 
ever designed or created. Other forms of networking have been around since the dawn 
of time. Today, designing, planning, implementing, deploying, and managing computer 
networks is somewhat of a never-ending journey into technology as it develops and 
integrates, standardizes and grows. It's amazing to see where computer networks are 
today from just 15 years ago. Now, more than ever, computer networks are relied upon 
to produce not only data in the form of files or connectivity to a printer for printing... 
today, everything from surfing the Internet securely to making a call from New York to 
Tianjin, China over phone that solely works off the power of the network. Wired to 
wireless, satellites in the sky to home PC networks that allow 2 computers in your home 
to share the Internet at the same time. This is all done through networking. The won- 
derful world of networking is colorful, exciting, and is growing each and every day... 
routers, switches, and other infrastructure devices are deployed every day from compa- 
nies such as Cisco, Juniper, Nortel, and 3Com to name a few. So who deploys them? 
Who plans, designs, and leads the way for all of this ,equipment to be planned, pur- 
chased, implemented, and managed? Each and every day technology grows more and 
more complicated, and it evolves as we do. 
By the end of this chapter you will have learned what a network is, and you will 
start to build upon the initial concepts you need to develop to become a network tech- 
nician, as well as to pass the Network+ exam. In this chapter we cover a brief history on 
the development of networks, as well where they originated from and where they are 
heading. We also cover the fundamental terminology you absolutely must know to per- 
form your duties as a network technician and to pass the CompTIA Network+ exam. 
We cover network models such as centralized and decentralized, the differences between 
a local area network (LAN) and a wide area network (WAN). Network topologies such 
as bus, ring, mesh, and star are covered, as well as a discussion on wired and wireless net- 
works. We then cover the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers), which 
is a standards committee aimed at making things in networking standardized, and easier 
to support and maintain. We cover in detail the most common standards, testable on the 
exam. Finally, we cover RFCs (Requests for Comments), a common source for net- 
working professionals to get the definitive source on networking knowledge. So let us 
start from the very beginning... What exactly is a network anyway? 
What is a Network? 
Even someone who's new to computers has experienced the basic concept of net- 
working; it is the difference between standing alone or being part of a group. Networks 
are systems that are interconnected in some way and provide a method of communica- 
tion. If you think of your own experiences, you've probably networked with groups of 
colleagues, and perhaps discussed how you're planning on taking the Network+ exam.

Doing so provided a method of sharing information and possibly opened avenues to 
accessing important resources. Computers are the same; they can be standalone or part 
of a network. 
A computer network exists when two or more machines are connected together, 
thereby allowing them to share data, equipment, and other resources. If there are no 
resources to share, then making a network is pretty useless. By using a combination of 
software and hardware the computers gain added functionality, including the ability to: 
• 
Transfer data between machines. 
• 
Save and access files on the same hard disks or other storage devices. 
• 
Share printers, scanners, modems, and other peripheral devices. 
• 
Allow messages to be exchanged via e-mail, instant messaging (IM), and other 
technologies.

Fast Track sections of this book. To make it easy to review items that you may 
have a problem remembering and that may appear on the exam, highlight or 
bookmark these items in the book so that you can review them at crunch time. 
They will provide a quick approach to re-examining important information. 
Although networks may provide similar functions, they can be as different from one 
another as groups of people. Networks are characterized by a number of factors, which 
we'll discuss later in this chapter and throughout this book. Some of the elements that 
will define your network, and make it different from others include: 
• 
Hardware, which includes the physical components of a computer or net- 
work, such as network interface cards (NICs) or network adapters that allow 
computers to transmit and receive data across the network. Other devices that 
fall into the category of hardware would include routers, switches, and hubs, 
which pass the data to other computers or networks (discussed in Chapter 3). 
• 
Media, which consists of cables (discussed in Chapter 2) or wireless technolo- 
gies (discussed in Chapter 4) that carry the data across the network. 
• 
Protocols, which are sets of rules that control how the data is sent between 
computers. The most popular of these is the protocol used on the Internet, 
TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol), while other 
www.syngress.com 
h,~

Chapter 1 • Network Fundamentals 
protocols used on networks include IPX/SPX (Internetwork Packet 
Exchange/Sequenced Packet Exchange) and AppleTalk (discussed in Chapter 6). 
• 
Topology, which is the shape of the network. It defines how the network is 
designed and describes how computers are physically connected together (dis- 
cussed later in this chapter). 
• 
Network type, which defines the size of the network and its scale within a 
geographical area (discussed later in this chapter). 
• 
Network model, which determines the levels of security available to the net- 
work, and the components needed to connect the computers together (dis- 
cussed later in this chapter). 
• 
Access, which determines who can use the network and how, and if features 
of the network are available for private or public use (discussed in Chapter 7). 
• 
Network Operating Systems (NOS), such as Windows, NetWare, and 
Linux (discussed in Chapter 8). A NOS may be used for a server, which is a 
computer that provides services to numerous computers, and/or installed on 
computers that are used by individual users of the network. In some cases, such 
as with Novell NetWare, additional software may have to be installed on com- 
puters (clients) that use the server. 
• 
Other software and services, such as access to internal websites, e-marl, 
databases, and so forth. 
If some of these elements of a network seem foreign to you, don't worry. We'll 
expand on them as we move through the book, discussing areas of networking in great 
detail. Because there are so many components that make up a network, these factors 
influence the design of networks, so networks in different homes and offices aren't con- 
sistently the same. Networks may use different protocols, topologies, and other elements 
that make them unique. This means you can look at two networks in two different 
homes or businesses, and they can be completely different from one another. 
Despite this, there are similarities that will exist among different networks. In all 
cases, a computer is configured to use the network (either by configuring its operating 
system or installing client software), and has a device capable of transmitting and 
receiving data, such as a network adapter or modem. Using a protocol like TCP/IP, the 
computer communicates with other computers and sends data over media (such as 
cables or wireless) to a device (such as a hub, router, or switch) that will send the data to 
its destination (such as another computer or device, such as a printer). Although the 
specifics may vary greatly, the basic aspects of a network remain the same.

What is an Internetwork? 
Just as computers can be connected together, so can networks. An internetwork exists 
when two or more networks that are connected together. By connecting networks 
together, different businesses or locations can share data between their systems. 
Internetworks are particularly important in organizations where sharing data is vital 
to the company's ability to function or operate effectively. For example, the police may 
have a network of computers in their cars, which connects to a network of computers 
located in police stations. If you're pulled over by the police, the officer may check your 
license plate number on the computer in his or her car. This computer would connect 
to a server used by the network of cars, and then pass along the request to a server on a 
different network that's used by other members of the organization, such as a Records 
department. If additional information was requested, the request might also be sent to 
networks belonging to state/provincial or federal police. By internetworking these dif- 
ferent systems, the police can determine if the car is stolen, if it was used to commit a 
crime, or if the owner is wanted or believed dangerous. 
As you've probably guessed from the name, the largest internetwork is the Internet. 
The Internet originated as a Department of Defense (DOD) project in 1969, when the 
Cold War was still going on between the West and the former Union of Soviet Socialist 
Republics (USSR). Under the direction of the DOD's Advanced Research Projects 
Agency (ARPA), the goal was to create a network that could withstand a nuclear attack. 
If any part of ARPANET was destroyed, the other parts of it would continue to 
function. Initially connecting four universities (University of California Los Angeles 
(UCLA), Stanford Research Institute, University of California Santa Barbara, and 
r

Chapter 1 • Network Fundamentals 
University of Utah), it allowed researchers and government to exchange information and 
quickly grew to include other organizations. Using the TCP/IP protocol suite that 
ARPA developed, additional computers and networks were added over the years, until 
finally in 1990, ARPANET was disbanded and removed from the Internet. Today, hun- 
dreds of millions of computers and networks connect to the Internet, making it a funda- 
mental method of communication and data exchange. 
Internetworks used by corporations and the Internet aren't to be confused with 
intranets. Intranets use the same technologies and features of the Internet, such as 
Internet browsers, websites, and so on. This allows users of a network to view docu- 
ments, distribute data, share employee information, access shared databases, online pro- 
grams, and other components that are needed or wanted by an organization. The major 
difference between an intranet and the Internet is that an intranet is used internally. 
While the Internet allows the public to view Web pages and other resources, intranets 
are private and available to employees of a company.

A Brief History on 
Networking and Communications 
While the Network+ exam won't quiz you on the history of networking, learning 
about the foundations of networking and communications will give you a better under- 
standing of more difficult topics discussed in later chapters. Understanding past achieve- 
ments and how we've reached our present state of technology will also make you a 
better Network+-certified technician. 
The history of networking and communications is rich and complex, stretching over 
a hundred years in the past, with massive changes in the later part of the 20 th century. 
By looking at these changes, you will see the development of operating systems, hard- 
ware, and innovations that are still used today. 
Early Telecommunications and Computers 
Telecommunications got its start in 1870s in Brantford Ontario, when Alexander 
Graham Bell developed the idea of a telephone. After the first successful words were sent 
over the device on March 10, 1876, a revolution of communication began. Within 
decades of its conception, millions of telephones were sold, with operators connecting 
people using manual circuit switching. This method of calling the operator to have him 
or her connect you to another party was routine until the mid-20 tti century, when 
mechanical and electronic circuit switching became commonplace. These events would 
have a massive impact on the innovation of computers, even though they wouldn't be 
invented until sixty years after Bell's first successful phone call. 
Although arguments could be made as to whether ancient devices (such as the 
abacus) could be considered a type of computer, the first programmable computer was 
developed by a German engineer named Konrad Zuse. In 1936, Zuse created the Zl, a 
mechanical calculator that was the first binary computer. Zuse continued making inno- 
vations to his design, and five years later had reached the point where the Z3 was able to 
accept programming. Although the next version of his computer would use punch cards 
to store programs, Zuse used movie film to store programming and data on the Z3 due 
to a supply shortage of paper during World War II. Just as his computers evolved, so did 
his programming skills. Zuse's achievements also extended to creating the first algo- 
rithmic programming language called Plankalkfil, which later used to create the first 
computer chess game. 
During this same time, John Atanasoff and Clifford Berry developed what is acknowl- 
edged to be the first electronic-binary computer. Created at the University of Iowa, the 
initial prototype acquired this team a grant that allowed them to build their 700-pound 
final product, containing over 300 vacuum tubes and approximately one mile of wire. 
Although an historic achievement, it wasn't initially recognized as such, as World War II 
prevented Atanasoff and Berry from completing a patent on their computer. Perhaps even 
worse, the computer itself met an unceremonious end when the Physics department 
needed storage space that was being used by the machine and dismantled it. 

10 
Chapter 1 • Network Fundamentals 
The distinction of being first initially went to John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert 
for their ENIAC I computer, until a 1973 patent infringement case determined 
Atanasoff and Berry were the first. The ENIAC I (Electrical Numerical Integrator And 
Calculator) was developed with funding from the U.S. government, and was based on 
the work of John Atanasoff. Starting work in 1943, the project took two and a half years 
to design and build ENIAC I, at a cost of half a million dollars. The ENIAC I was faster 
than previous computers, and was used to perform calculations for designing a hydrogen 
bomb, wind-tunnel designs, and a variety of scientific studies. It was used until 1955 
when the 30 ton, 1800 square foot computer was ultimately retired. 
Another computer that was developed during this time was the MARK I computer, 
developed by Howard Aiken and Grace Murray Hopper in 1944 in a project co-spon- 
sored by Harvard University and International Business Machines (IBM). Dwarfing the 
ENIAC at a length of 55 feet and 5 tons in weight, the MARK I was the first computer 
to perform long calculations.Although it was retired in 1959, it made a lasting mark on 
the English language. When the MARK I experienced a computer failure, Grace 
Murray Hopper checked inside the machine and found a moth. She taped it to her log- 
book and wrote "first actual bug found," giving us the terms "bug" for a computer 
problem, and "debug" for fixing it. 
In 1949, Hopper went on from the MARK I project to join a company created by 
John Mauchly and J. presper Eckert, which was developing a 1500 square foot, 40-ton 
computer named UNIVAC (UNIVersal Automatic Computer). UNIVAC was the first 
computer to use magnetic tape instead of paper cards to store programming code and 
data, and was much faster than the previous computers we've discussed. Whereas the 
MARK I took a few seconds to complete a multiplication operation, and ENIAC I 
could perform hundreds of operations per second, UNIVAC could perform multiplica- 
tion in microseconds. What made UNIVAC popular in the public eye, however, was a 
1952 publicity stunt where the computer accurately predicted the outcome of the presi- 
dential election. Although Dwight Eisenhower and Adlai Stevenson were believed evenly 
matched going into the November 4 th election night, UNIVAC predicted that 
Eisenhower would get 438 electoral votes, while Stevenson would only get 93. In actu- 
ality, Eisenhower got 442 electoral votes, while Stevenson got 89. While political analysts 
had been unable to predict the outcome, UNIVAC did so with a 1% margin of error. 
Having earned its place in history, the original UNIVAC currently resides in the 
Smithsonian Institute. 
Although UNIVAC was the more successful computer of its day, 1953 saw IBM 
release the EDPM 701. Using punchcards for programs, nineteen of these were sold (as 
opposed to 46 UNIVACs sold to business and government agencies). However, develop- 
ment of this computer lead to the IBM 704, considered to be the first super-computer. 
Because it used magnetic core memory, it was faster than its predecessor. This series of 
computers further evolved to the development of the 7090 computer in 1960, which 
was the first commercially available computer to use transistors, and the fastest computer 
of its time. Such innovations firmly placed IBM as a leader in computer technology.

11 
The Space Age to the Information Age 
While IBM and the owners of UNIVAC were contending for clients to buy their com- 
puters, or at least rent computer time, the former USSR launched Sputnik in 1957. 
Sputnik was the first manmade satellite to be put into orbit, and it initiated a competition 
in space between the USSP,. and the United States that pushed technology to new limits. 
Sputnik launched a number of events that led to advances in computers and com- 
munication. While author Arthur C. Clark had published an article in 1945 describing 
manmade satellites in geosynchronous orbit being used to relay transmissions, communi- 
cation satellites didn't appear until after Sputnik's historic orbit. In 1960, Bell Telephone 
Laboratories (AT&T) filed with the FCC to obtain permission to launch a communica- 
tions satellite, and over the next five years, several communication satellites were orbiting 
overhead. 
Obviously, the most notable result of Sputnik was the space race between the U.S. 
and USSP,., with the ultimate goal of reaching the moon. The U.S. started the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), began launching space missions, and 
achieved the first manned landing on the moon in 1969. Using computers that 
employed only a few thousand lines of code (as opposed to the 45 million lines of code 
used in Windows XP), the onboard computer systems provided necessary functions and 
communicated with other computers on Earth. Communications between astronauts 
and Mission Control on Earth also marked the furthest distance of people communi- 
cating to date. 
The Cold War and the space race also resulted in another important milestone in 
computer systems and communication systems. As we discussed earlier, the U.S. govern- 
ment started the Advanced Research Projects Agency, which developed such important 
technologies as: 
• 
AR.PANET, the predecessor of the modern Internet, which connected mul- 
tiple institutions and areas of government together for research purposes. 
[] 
Packet-switched networks, where messages sent over a network are broken 
into packets. They are then sent over the network, and reassembled after 
reaching the destination computer. 
• 
TCP/IR which specifies rules about how data is to be sent and received over 
the network, and provides utilities for working over a network. 
Although only a few educational institutions and the government were networked 
together through ARPANET, it lead to the first e-mail program being developed in 
1972, and the first news server being developed in 1979. The Internet was years away, 
but its foundation was set here.

Hardware and Operating Systems 
Major advances pushed the development of computers and networking in the 1970s. In 
1971, Intel produced the first microprocessor, which had its own arithmetic logic unit 
and provided a way of creating smaller, faster computers. It was the first of many Intel 
processors produced over the years, including the: 
• 
8008 processor produced in 1972 
• 
8080 processor (an 8-bit processor) produced in 1974 
• 
8086 processor (a 16-bit processor) produced in 1978. Because other tech- 
nology needed to catch up to the speed of the processor, an 8088 processor (an 
8/16-bit processor) was released in 1979. It wasn't until 1983 that IBM 
released the XT with the 8086 processor (and option to add an 8087 match 
co-processor). 
• 
80286 (16-bit processor) produced in 1982 
• 
80386 (32-bit processor) produced in 1985 
• 
80486 (32-bit processor) produced in 1989 
• 
Pentium (32-bit processor) produced in 1993, which ended the x86 naming 
scheme for processors. After this, Intel chips bore the Pentium name, inclusive 
up to the Pentium 75 (in 1994), Pentium 120, 133 and Pentium Pro 200 (in 
1995), Pentium MMX and Pentium II (in 1997), and Pentium III (in 1999). As 
you would expect, each generation was faster than the last. 
Just as processing changed in the 1970s, so did storage. In 1973, IBM developed the 
first hard disk, and an 8" floppy drive, replacing the need to store data and programs 
solely on magnetic tapes. This massive floppy was quickly replaced by the 5.25" floppy 
in 1976, which was later succeeded by the 3.5" floppy disk that was developed by Sony 
in 1980. These methods of storing data became commonplace until 1989 when the first 
CD-1KOM was developed, and again changed in 1997 with the introduction of DVDs. 
With the advances in technology, it was only a matter of time before someone 
developed a home computer. Prior to the mid-1970s, computers were still too large and 
expensive to be used by anyone other than large corporations and governments. With 
the invention of the microprocessor, a company called Micro Instrumentation and 
Telemetry Systems (MITS) developed the Altair 8800 using the Intel 8080 processor. 
Although it included an 8" floppy drive, it didn't have a keyboard, monitor or other 
peripherals that we're accustomed to today. Programs and data entry were entered using 
toggle switches at the front of the machine. Although it couldn't be compared to per- 
sonal computers of today, it did attain the distinction of being the first. 
The Altair also provided a point of origin for Microsoft, as Bill Gates and Paul Allen 
developed a version of the BASIC programming language for Altair that was based on a 
public domain version created in 1964. Microsoft went on to create an operating system 

Network Fundamentals • Chapter 1 
13 
called PC-DOS (which required users to type in commands) for the first IBM computer 
(named "The Acorn") in 1981, but maintained ownership of the software. This allowed 
them to market their operating system to other computer manufacturers and build their 
software empire. Microsoft went on to develop such operating systems as MS-DOS, 
Windows, Windows for Workgroups, Windows NT, Windows ME, Windows 2000, 
Windows 2003 Server, and Windows XP. 
UNIX was another operating system that originated in the 1970s, and was the 
inspiration for developing another operating system that's widely used today. Ken 
Thomson and Dennis Ritchie of Bell Labs developed UNIX in 1970, which came to be 
used on high-end servers and (years later) Web servers for the Internet. Linus Torvalds 
used UNIX as the basis for developing Linux twenty years later. Linux is open source, 
meaning that the code is available to use for free, and is the only operating system that 
acts as competition for Microsoft and Apple today. 
Apple Computer's start also originates in the 1970s, when Steve Jobs and Steve 
Wozniak incorporated their company on April Fools Day of 1976, and introduced the 
Apple II the next year. It wasn't until the 1980s, however, that Apple really made its 
mark. In 1981, Xerox developed a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that used the win- 
dows, icons, menus, and mouse support that we're familiar with in operating systems 
today. However, Xerox never released it to the public. Developing its Apple Lisa and 
Macintosh on the work done by Xerox, Apple introduced Lisa as the first GUI personal 
computer in 1983. The Macintosh was easy to use and made Apple the major competi- 
tion of IBM after its release. 
The WIMP (Windows, Icons, Menus, Pointer) interface that gave Apple and 
Windows their looks wasn't the only major contribution Xerox made to computers and 
networking. While working at Xerox's Palo Mto Research Center, Bob Metcalfe was 
asked to develop a method of networking their computers. What he created was called 
Ethernet. Ethernet was different from other networks like the Internet, which connected 
remote computers together using modems that dialed into one another, or dumb termi- 
nals that had no processing power and were only used to access mainframe computers. 
Ethernet connected computers together using cabling and network adapters, allowing 
them to communicate with one another over these physical connections. If you think 
that Ethernet sounds like many networks in use today, you'd be correct; Ethernet is an 
industry standard.

Chapter 1 • Network Fundamentals 
After Ethernet was developed, operating systems that were specifically designed for 
networking weren't far behind. In 1979, Novell Data Systems was founded with a focus 
on developing computer hardware and operating systems. In 1983 however, Novell 
changed focus and developed NetWare, thus becoming an industry leader in network 
operating systems. Unlike other operating systems that resided on a computer and could 
be used as either a standalone machine or a network workstation, NetWare was two 
components. The NetWare operating system is a full operating system and resides on a 
server, which processes requests from a network user's' client machine. The computer that 
the network user is working on can run any number of different operating systems (such 
as Windows 9x, NT, etcetera), but has client software installed on it that connects to the 
NetWare server. When a request is made to access a file or print to a NetWare server, 
the client software redirects the request to the server. Due to its popularity as a network 
operating system, it is widely used on corporate and government networks. 
The Information Age Appears 
In the 1980s, computers became more commonplace in homes and businesses. Prices 
had dropped to the point where it was affordable to have a computer in the home, and 
powerful enough to be worth having a 286 or 386 computer. While many people found 
computers useful, they quickly outgrew the desire to have a standalone machine and 
wanted to be networked to others. 
The 1980s and 1990s saw growing popularity in BBSs (Bulletin Board Systems), 
where one computer could use a modem and telephone line to directly dial another 
computer. Computers with BBS software provided the ability for users to enjoy many of 
the features associated with the Internet, including message boards, e-mail, chat programs 
(to send messages instantly to other users), the ability to download programs and other 
files, or play online games. Because communications were carried out over a modem, 
BBSs were largely comprised of computer users within a single community, although 
message networks were used to have discussions with people in other cities or countries. 
While BBSs were eventually replaced by the Internet, the 1980s also saw changes 
that would affect the future of cyberspace. In 1983, the University of Wisconsin devel- 
oped the Domain Name System (DNS). DNS provided a way of translating the IP 
addresses used to uniquely identify computers on TCP/IP networks. Using DNS, a 
number like 207.46.250.222 can be translated to a friendly domain name like 
microsoft.com. In 1984, DNS became part of A1KPANET, and would eventually become 
a major part resolving domain names on the Internet. 
Also during the mid-1980s, the backbone of the Internet was developed.The back- 
bone was a central network that connected other networks on the Internet. Between 
1985 and 1988,T1 lines were developed to accommodate a necessary increase of 
dataflow and speed on the Internet. The speed that data could be sent over the back- 
bone was now increased to 1.544Mbps.

Perhaps the greatest defining moment in the shape of the Internet was Tim Berners- 
Lee's creation of HTML (HyperText Markup Language). In 1989, a textual version was 
created that supported hyperlinks, but this evolved into the language that was released by 
CE1KN in 1991, and used to create documents that can be viewed online (in the form 
of Web pages). In 1993, Mosaic became the first Internet browser, allowing users to view 
such Web pages, but others like Netscape and Internet Explorer soon appeared. 
When A1KPANET was retired in 1990, the first company to provide dial-up access 
to the Internet was formed. The World (www.theworld.com) provided the ability (for a 
fee) to dial into their system using a modem and connect to the Internet. In 1993, other 
Internet Service Providers (ISPs) appeared that provided this service, increasing the 
number of people using the Internet steadily. While initially used as a repository of pro- 
grams, research, and other resources, this opened the Internet up to commercial use, 
which evolved into the entity we know today. 
Networking Models 
Since networks vary from one another depending upon a range of factors, it should 
come as no surprise that there are different network models. The network model you 
choose will affect a network infrastructure's design and how it is administered. 
Depending on the model or models used, it can have an impact on the location of com- 
puters, how users access resources, and the number of computers and types of operating 
systems required. The models available to choose from are: 
• 
Centralized 
• 
Decentralized (Distributed) 
• 
Peer-to-Peer 
• 
Client/Server 
Centralized 
When a centralized network model is used, a network's resources are centrally located 
and administered. This approach allows network administrators to have better access to 
equipment and better control over security issues. However, because responsibility for 
managing these resources now rests with the network administrator or IT staff, the 
workload of administering them increases. 
A centralized model will affect the physical location of servers and certain other 
resources on your network.You'll remember that servers are computers that accept 
requests from client computers (which users of the network work on), and provide ser- 
vices and resources that the client has proper access to use. As we'll discuss later in this 
chapter, dedicated servers generally have larger hard disk space and memory, and have 
faster processors than the workstations accessing them. When a centralized model is 
r 
www.syngress.com 

16 
Chapter 1 • Network Fundamentals 
used, these servers are generally located in a secure, central location, such as a dedicated 
server room. This secured room can also be used to house other resources, such as 
routers, switches, firewalls, Web servers, plotters, and other devices. 
Because they are stored in a central location, additional work may be required to 
manage them. For example, let's say you had a plotter that was kept in a server room. 
Anytime anyone needed the plotter installed as a printer on his or her computer, you 
would need to set up permissions for him or her to use it. If the user sent a print job to 
this plotter, someone from the IT staff would need to enter the secure room to get the 
printout. In addition, there would also be the need to replace paper and toners used in 
the device. In a centralized model, administration of the resources is also centralized. 
Despite the previous scenario, in some ways, managing resources can be easier with 
this model. By keeping these resources in one area, a network administrator can easily 
change backup tapes, replace hard disks, or fix other issues as required. Imagine the issues 
with having servers in offices throughout a city or region, and having to visit each of 
them whenever a tape had to be replaced after a tape backup. By keeping resources cen- 
tralized, less work is required for their administration. 
Depending on the requirements of an organization, the centralized network model 
can also mean that fewer servers or other devices are needed. Rather than each building 
having its own server on the premises, users can save their work to a dedicated server in 
a central location. This would keep everyone's files on one or more servers, allowing 
their work to be kept secure and regularly backed up. 
Decentralized (Distributed) 
When a decentralized network model is used, a network's resources are distributed 
through different areas of the network, and administration is shared by designating 
responsibility to system administrators or individual users. For example, printers may be 
scattered throughout an organization, with managers of each office being responsible for 
assigning permissions to user accounts to use specific printers. By sharing administrative 
burdens in this way, certain resources can now be managed by other members of the 
organization. 
A decentralized network model has a variety of servers, equipment, and other 
resources distributed across the geographical area making up the network. While a net- 
work administrator may be able to access them over the computer network, such net- 
work components aren't readily accessible physically. As such, a network administrator 
must rely on people who are designated as system administrators in those locations. 
These people must be properly trained on the system, and responsible enough to take 
matters like security seriously. If not, something as simple as changing a backup tape 
could be problematic or even disastrous. 
Even if an organization initially decides on having a centralized network, decentral- 
izing the network may be the only viable option if cost factors or other issues come into 
play. For example, if a company had a slow network connection between buildings, users 

Network Fundamentals • Chapter 1 
17 
might find logging into the network, saving data to a server, or accessing network 
resources slow. A solution would be to put a server in each building so that computers 
could be authenticated and quickly access data on the server that's closest to them. By 
distributing servers in this instance, network performance would improve because users 
wouldn't have to authenticate or necessarily use the slow connection to the other server. 
Peer-to-Peer 
Years ago, most computers on a network weren't very powerful. Hard disks, memory, 
printers, and other components making up a computer system were expensive, creating a 
need for dedicated servers that other computers accessed to store data and access necessary 
resources. These dedicated servers could be mainframes or high-end computers with addi- 
tional memory, storage space, and processing power. As technology progressed, computer 
workstations came to be as powerful as, or in many cases more powerful than the servers 
of years past, making peer-to-peer networks a viable solution for smaller networks.

Chapter 1 • Network Fundamentals 
In a peer-to-peer network, computers on the network act as equals, with each 
workstation providing access to resources and data. This is a simple type of network 
where computers are able to communicate with one another, and share what is on or 
attached to their computer with other users. It is also one of the easiest types of archi- 
tectures to create. 
Individual users have responsibility over who can access data and resources on their 
computers. Operating systems like Windows 2000 Professional and Windows XP allow 
accounts to be set up that will be used when others users connect to a specified com- 
puter. Accounts, passwords, and permissions are saved in a local database, and are used to 
determine what someone can do when connecting to your computer. For example, one 
account may allow a user to send print jobs to your printer, while another account may 
allow the user to access files in certain directories, but not to print. 
Because peer-to-peer networks are generally small, creating one can be as simple as 
installing network adapters into each computer, attaching a network cable to the adapter 
and connecting the other end to a hub or router. If a wireless network is being created, 
then even the cables aren't necessary, as wireless adapters and a wireless router are all 
that's needed. Once this is done, each computer is configured to use the network 
adapter that's installed, and a protocol is configured to allow communication between 
the computers. In cases where operating systems like Windows XP are used, this config- 
uration can be done through a wizard program, which takes you step-by-step through 
the configuration process. 
One important issue with peer-to-peer networks is security. Each computer on this 
type of network may allow or deny access to other users, as access to data and resources 
are controlled on each machine. For example, a user could share a folder on his or her 
computer, allowing other users to access the files in that folder. 
Because users can have the ability to control access to files and resources on their 
computers, network administration isn't controlled by one person. However, problems 
may exist when users grant access to data and resources based on friendship with 
another person instead of that person's need to perform his or her job. As such, peer-to- 
peer networks are generally used in situations where security isn't a major concern, as in 
the case of home networks or very small businesses. 
~:. ~? 
WARNING 
A peer-to-peer network uses share level access and allows users to control 
access to files and resources on their computers. Each computer is equal in this 
....... ,~,:~ type of network. A client/server network has computers who act as clients to 
,~ii~ • servers that share resources. Access on a client/server network is based on 
accounts, which can determine whether users and computers have access to 
files and other resources. If resources are located and administered in a central 
location, it is a centralized network, while resources that are distributed and 
administered across the network are decentralized. Remember the differences 

Network Fundamentals • Chapter 1 
19 
and relationships between different network types for the exam, as they may be 
covered either directly or incorporated in the scenarios used to cover other 
material. 
Client/Server 
In looking at the peer-to-peer network model, when one computer requests data or 
other services from another computer, it acts as a client, while the other computer deliv- 
ering that data or service acts as a server. These roles seem obscured because both com- 
puters can act in either of these roles. In the client/server model, these roles are clearer 
because the model involves dedicated servers that provide services such as file and 
printer sharing and data to clients, without making similar requests of them. 
The client/server model consists of high-end computers serving clients on a net- 
work, by providing them with specific services upon request.Years ago, each server gen- 
erally performed a single role, such as: 
• 
File server, which allows clients to save data to folders on its hard drive. 
• 
Print server, which redirects print jobs from clients to specific printers. 
• 
Application server, which allows clients to run certain programs on the server, 
and enables multiple users to common applications across the network. 
• 
Database server, which allows authorized clients to view, modify and/or delete 
data in a common database. 
Today, computers are more powerful and network operating systems are more effec- 
tive, so each server may act in several different roles. For example, a server may be a Web 
server for the local intranet, but also allow users to access a database and store files in an 
area of its hard drive. The services provided by the server will vary greatly depending on 
how it has been configured and what's been installed. 
The software that's installed largely dictates the roles a dedicated server can perform. 
First and foremost, the server needs to have a network operating system like Windows 
NT, Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2003 Server, UNIX/Linux, or Novell NetWare 
installed on it. These server operating systems provide features specifically for servicing 
clients, and can respond more efficiently to a greater number of client requests than 
standard operating systems like Windows 9x, NT Workstation, Windows 2000 
Professional, or Windows XR 
Once a high-end computer has server software installed, the services provided by it 
have to be configured and other programs may have to be installed. Many of the server's 
functions are dependant on the server software installed on it. For example, a server that 
acts as an SQL server is a database server, but it has to have a program like Microsoft SQL 
Server installed on it. In the same way, a Web server on a Windows Server 2003 server 
www.syngress.com 

20 
Chapter 1 • Network Fundamentals 
would need Internet Information Services (IIS) configured. By installing server software 
on a dedicated server, you define the role that server will play on your network. 
While a dedicated server may play a variety of roles, you should determine whether 
the load placed on the server is too great, thereby causing performance to decrease. 
Some services provided by a server may be accessed frequently, creating a larger work- 
load for the server. Rather than creating a burden for the server, the server should be 
dedicated to performing a single role, or at least a decreased number of roles. For 
example, an e-mail server may be accessed frequently by users of the network who want 
to check for messages. Because it is used so often, many organizations will have one 
server performing this role alone to prevent it from being bogged down and providing 
slow access to e-mail. In the same way, if the service is essential to a business, such as 
Web server being necessary for a business that sells products on the Internet, that server 
will be dedicated to only that role. The more a server is dedicated to a specific or lim- 
ited number of functions, the better its performance and the less chance there will be of 
everything becoming unavailable if one server fails. 
Network Types and Topologies 
At the beginning of this chapter, we explained that a network exists when two or more 
computers are connected together so they can share various resources. While this defines 
the basic nature of a network, it doesn't provide an understanding of the different sizes 
and shapes a network can take as it's designed and developed. Having this understanding 
is important in determining the scope and physical layout of computers, cables, and 
other network components. It is also vital when considering the type of media that will 
be used, and whether additional components are necessary to expand your network. 

Network Fundamentals • Chapter 1 
21 
Network Types 
Just as we saw the Internet evolve from a relatively small network named ARPANET, 
networks can extend beyond their initial creation of a few computers connected 
together. A network can be in a single building, or comprised of computers connected 
together over a broader geographical area. To categorize the scope of a network, different 
terms have been created to classify these different network types. The types of networks 
that could be created include: 
• 
Local area network 
• 
Wide area network 
• 
Metropolitan area network (MAN) 
• 
Storage area network (SAN) 
• 
Personal area network (PAN) 
• 
Campus area network (CAN) 
LAN and WAN 
Local area networks and wide area networks were the first types of networks to be clas- 
sified by the area they covered, and are still the ones most commonly referred to. While 
each of the names refer to an area, an exact range has never been firmly established and 
is left vague. Although IEEE (which we'll discuss later in this chapter) defines a local 
area as being up to 4 km, no one will accuse it of not being a LAN if it is slightly over 
that. LANs are networks spanning a limited distance, while a WAN is a network that is 
larger than a LAN. What distinguishes a LAN from a WAN in terms of area is 
ambiguous and speculative at best. 
Local area networks are small- to medium-sized networks, and generally connect 
network devices that are no more than a few miles from one another. They include net- 
works that have been set up in homes, offices, the floor of a building, an entire building, 
a campus or group of nearby buildings, or facilities that are relatively close to one 
another. Basically, if you can walk or drive the distance of the network in a short time, 
you're dealing with a LAN. 
Another way to characterize a LAN is through ownership. Typically, the network is 
owned by a single person or organization, and is managed by a single person or group of 
people. For example, your home network would be a LAN that's owned and managed 
by you. In the same way, a large company with several buildings in a region that's run by 
a network administrator or IT department would also be a LAN. When you look at 
LANs in this way, you can see that most networks are actually local area networks. 
Wide area networks can span great geographical distances and connect different LANs 
together using high-speed solutions or telephone lines. A WAN may connect LANs in dif- 
ferent cities, regions, states/provinces, or even countries. This is something we saw when 
www.syngress.com 

22 
Chapter 1 • Network Fundamentals 
we discussed the first WAN, ARPANET, which connected the LANs of several institutions 
in different cities together. Over time, the number of computers and networks connecting 
to it grew until it spanned the world and became the Internet. By internetworking indi- 
vidual LANs together, the LANs become parts of a wide area network. 
When looking at WANs, ownership isn't a defining factor. Wide area networks are 
often owned and managed by more than one organization. Each LAN that is part of the 
WAN may be managed by individuals or IT departments, who either maintain their 
connections to the rest of the LAN or hire outside parties to perform that function. For 
example, in the case of the Internet, you may maintain your home network, but you 
hire an ISP to maintain the connection to the World Wide Web. In the same way, a 
company with offices in different cities may hire the phone company to maintain a T1 
line that connects the network together. 
An effective way of understanding how a local area network is related to a wide area 
network is to look at how they are connected and how data is sent. This may differ from 
organization to organization, as there are several different ways of getting data from a 
LAN to a WAN, including: 
[] 
Modem, which is a device that allows you to connect to other computers and 
devices using telephone lines. Generally, when a modem is mentioned, it refers 
to a dial-up modem (as opposed to the digital modems for other methods 
mentioned below). This type of connection is slow, and allows connections at a 
maximum of 56Kbps (meaning that 56000 bits of data can be sent or received 
per second). 
• 
ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network), which also transmits data over 
telephone lines but at higher speeds, up to 128Kbps, but averaging 64Kbps 
using an ISDN modem or router. 
• 
DSL (Digital Subscriber Line), which sends data across telephone lines at 
speeds ranging from 1.5Mbps (1.5 million bits per second) using a router or 
digital modem and configured phone lines. 
• 
Cable, which transmits the data across cable lines using the same lines used for 
cable television at speeds of up to 1.5Mbps. 
• 
Satellite, which transmits data to a satellite at speeds of up to 400Kbps. 
• 
T1 and T3, which are dedicated connections that provide extremely high 
speeds. A T1 line provides speeds of 1.544Mbps, while a T3 line provides 
speeds ranging from 3Mbps to 44.736Mbps.

study for the exam. While we'll discuss media in greater detail in Chapter 2 and 
23 
WAN technologies in Chapter 7, you will need to memorize the characteristics 
and speeds of various media before taking the exam. 
To illustrate the relationships between LANs and WANs, let's look at a situation that 
may be familiar to you: sending e-mail to another person. Using the e-mail program on 
your computer, you would click the Send button, and the data (your e-mail) would be 
sent to the device responsible for sending it to the Internet. As shown in Figure 1.1, this 
begins a process that will take the e-mail through a number of devices and possibly sev- 
eral LANs and WANs. If you have a dial-up account to the Internet, the device might 
be a standard modem. If you have a LAN in your home, the e-mail might be sent to a 
network adapter and sent over a network.

As we mentioned earlier, when a network is created, two or more computers are 
connected together. In a LAN, these computers are in the same locale, such as being in 
www.syngress.com 

24 
Chapter 1 • Network Fundamentals 
the same room. Each computer has a NIC installed in it, which transmits and receives 
data through a network cable or using wireless technology. When your data is sent to 
the network adapter, it is broken up into smaller chunks called packets that can be sent 
more efficiently over the network. As such, your e-mail would be broken into smaller 
packets, which would then be put back together by the computer receiving it. 
If you used DSL, these packets would be transmitted over your home LAN to a 
router (or other termination device) that is used to connect to the ISR Some of these 
devices come with the capability to act as hubs and switches, which allow them to be 
used to connect different computers on your LAN together. In cases where network 
cable is used, one end of a cable would be plugged into a network adapter and the other 
would plug into the router. Data is sent over the cable with information about its desti- 
nation, and the router determines if it's for a computer on the LAN or has to be sent to 
the ISP who provides DSL to you. Since you're sending e-mail to someone who isn't on 
your home network, the router would use the DSL connection to send it from your 
LAN to the ISP's LAN. In doing so, the e-mail message has gone beyond the boundaries 
of your local network, and has been passed to a WAN. 
When the ISP receives your e-mail, it also looks at where the data is destined. 
Because the ISP also has a LAN, it looks at whether the e-mail is destined for someone 
else who uses their service, a computer on their network, or another network connected 
to the Internet. Since you're sending the e-mail to someone who uses a different ISR it 
sends the e-mail over the Internet, which is a giant WAN, to be received by the destina- 
tion ISP's e-mail server. 
When the destination ISP receives the data, it will store the e-mail you sent on its 
e-mail server, until your friend dials into the Internet using a modem.Your friend's com- 
puter connects to the ISP's server, and then requests any e-mail that the e-mail server 
might have. This data is again broken into packets, and sent over the telephone line so 
that your friend's modem can receive the data, and the computer can reassemble these 
packets and display them in your friend's e-mail program. 
As you can see by this example, there are many different kinds of LANs and WANs 
that data may pass through. LANs may be as small as a couple of computers networked 
together, and a WAN may be as large as the Internet or as small as two LANs (yours and 
your ISP's) interconnected using routers. In each case, the LAN consists of computers 
that are part of the same network, and the WAN consists of geographically dispersed 
LANs that are internetworked.

know the difference between a LAN and a WAN, and that a WAN is a group of 
~ 
internetworked LANs. Other types of networks discussed below (MAN, SAN, 
CAN, PAN) aren't covered extensively on the exam. Specific elements of LANs 
and WANs are discussed throughout this book, and you will need to know them 
to pass the exam. 
MAN 
While most people refer to a network in terms of being either a LAN or a WAN, there 
are other terms to further categorize a network. One such category is a MAN, which is 
an acronym for a metropolitan area network. A MAN will generally cover a 
metropolitan area, like a city, but this isn't always the case. For example, if you lived in a 
small town and had your LAN connecting to another LAN in a neighboring town, you 
could also refer to this as a MAN. When LANs are connected together with high-speed 
solutions over a territory that is relatively close together (such as several buildings in a 
city, region or county), it can be considered a MAN. A MAN is a group of LANs that 
are internetworked within a local geographic area, which IEEE (an organization we'll 
discuss later in this chapter) defines as being 50 km or less in diameter. As shown in 
Figure 1.2, LANs can be joined together within this area to create a MAN, while still 
being part of a larger WAN.

Chapter 1 • Network Fundamentals 
SAN 
A SAN is a storage area network, and is used to connect storage devices together using 
high-speed connections. It is a segment of a network, and allows storage devices to be 
accessed by computers within the larger LAN or WAN. These storage devices consist of 
hard disks or other methods of storing data, and allow users of the network to view 
and/or save data to a centralized location. 
PAN 
A PAN is a personal area network, which is a wireless network that allows devices to 
exchange data with computers. Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), cell phones, and other 
portable devices that support this technology have a wireless transmitter in them. When 
they are within a certain distance of a receiver that's installed on a computer, data can be 
exchanged between the computer and the device. Using a PAN allows you to do such 
things as update a calendar in a PDA or an address book in a cell phone, and other tasks 
that are supported by the device. 
CAN 
A CAN is a campus area network, and refers to a series of LANs that are internet- 
worked between several nearby buildings. This is a common type of network that's used 
in organizations with facilities that are close to one another, such as in a pool of office 
buildings or a campus. It is larger than a LAN, but smaller than a MAN. 
~TE 
Wireless local area networks (WLANs) are covered in Chapter 4. 
Network Topologies 
Just as size defines a network, so does the way it's laid out. The topology of a network is 
the physical layout of computers, hubs, routers, cables, and other components. It provides 
a map of where things are and how the network is configured. 
While networks are often unique, the topology of each network will share charac- 
teristics with others. Networks will use one or a combination of these topologies:

Bus 
• 
Star 
Ring 
Mesh 
Wireless

WARNING 
One of the testable items on the Network+ exam is the ability to identify a 
topology based on either the description given, or a picture of the topology. 
.... ~:~ .... Make sure you know each of the topologies covered in this section, and can 
"~,;~ identify them simply by looking at them before taking the exam. 
  
Bus 
The bus topology is an older topology that is rarely seen and not normally deployed in 
modern networks. As shown in Figure 1.3, all of the computhrs in a bus topology are 
connected together using a single cable, which is called a trunk, backbone, or segment. 
Coaxial cable is commonly used for the trunk, which is the same type of cable that's 
used to connect to your TV to receive cable television. The computers are attached to 
the 50ohm coaxial cable segment using T-connectors, which get their name because 
they're shaped like the letter T. Because all of these computers use the same cable, only 
one computer can send packets of data (which are electronic signals) onto the network 
at a time. 
Figure 1.3 A Bus Topology 
When a computer sends a packet of data onto the trunk, it is sent in both directions 
so that every computer on the network has the chance to receive it. Each of the com- 
puters on this type of topology listens to the network traffic, so that it can determine 
whether a packet being sent over the network is for it. When a computer listens to the 
network, any packets that aren't addressed to it are ignored, while any specifically sent to 
it are accepted. The exception to this is when a broadcast is made, in which packets are 
destined for every computer on the network. 
Because the topology is linear, when data is sent over the trunk, it runs the length of 
the cable. To prevent data signals from staying on the cable indefinitely, the cable has to 
be terminated with 50ohm terminators at each end so electronic signals are absorbed 
when they reach the cable's end. The terminator absorbs the signal so that the cable is

28 
Chapter 1 • Network Fundamentals 
clear for other computers to send packets on the network. Without termination, a com- 
puter would send packets to another computer over the trunk, and the packets would 
bounce back and forth along the length of the cable making communication unreliable 
and prone to failure. 
Bus topologies provide several benefits to organizations. While we mentioned that 
they are easy to set up, they are also a passive topology. In other words, when a com- 
puter is on a bus network, it only listens for or sends data. It doesn't take data and then 
resend or regenerate it, so each computer isn't essential to the network as a whole. If one 
computer fails, it doesn't crash the entire network. 
Another benefit of this topology is that it is inexpensive, as less cable is used than in 
other topologies we'll discuss. As we'll see later, some topologies have redundant con- 
nections or require a significant amount of cable. In a bus topology, every computer is 
connected to a single cable. 
Having a single cable, however, does cause other problems. If the trunk cable breaks, 
each segment has an end that isn't terminated, and the entire network goes down. If the 
trunk is long enough, it can be difficult to isolate where the break is. 
Another disadvantage of this topology is that it isn't very scalable. The number of 
computers is limited to the length of the cable, and as your company grows, it can be 
difficult to change the size and layout of the network. Also, if changes or repairs are 
made to the cable, the network is down because there is no redundancy and termination 
of the cable is required.

use on a LAN. 
  
Star (Hierarchical) 
In a star topology, computers aren't connected to one another, but are all connected to a 
central concentrator, commonly called a hub or switch. When a computer sends data to 
other computers on the network, it is sent along the cable to the hub or switch, which 
can then pass the packets to the other computers or devices connected to it.As shown 
in Figure 1.4, when the computers are cabled to the hub, each point in the network 
appears similar to points in a star (hence the name of this topology). 

Network Fundamentals • Chapter 1 
29 
Figure 1.4 A Star Topology 
Although this is also considered an older topology that comes from the time when 
terminals were connected to mainframes as a centralized point, it is still a popular 
topology, having been reworked to today's needs and standards. In fact, the star topology 
is the most commonly used topology, thereby making it the one you will see most as a 
Network+ technician. Because cables run to a central point, if" one cable breaks or fails 
in some way, only the computer that is connected to that cable is unable to use the net- 
work. Other computers are unaffected because they have their own cables running to 
the hub. This can also make it easier to repair because, unlike the bus topology, it is easy 
to see where the cable failure has occurred. 
Another benefit of this topology is that it is scalable. As the network grows or 
changes, computers are added or removed from the hub. Unfortunately, because there is 
so much cabling that is being used to connect individual computers to a central hub, this 
also increases the cost of" expanding and maintaining the network. 
Mesh 
A mesh topology has multiple connections, making it the most fault tolerant topology 
available. Every component of" the network is connected directly to every other compo- 
nent. As shown in Figure 1.5, this creates a topology that provides redundant links across 
the network. If" a break occurs in a segment of" cable, traffic can still be rerouted using 
the other cables. In other words, if" one connection fails, a computer can still access 
another computer or resource using another connection.

Chapter 1 • Network Fundamentals 
Figure 1.5 A Mesh Topology 
Although it is almost impossible for a cable fault to crash a mesh topology, this 
topology is rarely used. There is significant cost and work involved in having network 
components directly connected to every other component. This topology provides 
redundant cable connections, but exponentially increases the workload and cost of main- 
taining them, making them difficult to manage and creating a cost that's greater than 
other topologies. 
Determining the number of cable connections required by a Mesh network can be 
done by using the following formula: 
Ln=n(n-1)/2 
In this connection n is the number of nodes (which is another term for the net- 
work's computers), while Ln is the number of connections required. If we were to use 
this formula on a mesh network with four computers (as depicted in Figure 1.5), then 
we would calculate it as follows: 
4(4-1)/2 
If we break this down, 4-1 =3. When we multiply this by 4, we get 12. When we 
divide this by 2 we get 6. This would mean that in a mesh network of six computers, we 
need six connections between the computers. While this might seem reasonable on a 
small network, consider what happens when we use this same formula on a network of 
100 computers: 
100(100-1)/2. 
Using the same formula, we find that on the network of 100 computers, 4950 con- 
nections would be needed to create a mesh network. When you consider the cost of 

Network Fundamentals • Chapter 1 
31 
purchasing this much cabling for the network, the reason why mesh networks aren't 
commonly used on LANs becomes clear. 
Rings 
A ring topology consists of computers connected to a cable that forms closed loop. As 
shown in Figure 1.6, there are no unconnected ends to the ring, so terminators aren't 
required. Data passes around the loop in one direction. As it reaches each computer, the 
computer examines each packet and determines if the destination address matches its 
network address. 
If it isn't, the computer sends the packet on to the next computer in the ring. In 
doing so, each computer acts as a repeater, resending the packet and thereby boosting 
the signal. When the packet reaches the destination computer, it removes the packet 
from the network.

Chapter 1 • Network Fundamentals 
Figure 1.6 A Ring Topology 
! 
Ring topologies only allow one computer to have access to sending data on the 
ring at one time, which makes it deterministic. Deterministic access is the capability of 
computers to have regular turns at accessing the media (the cable making up the ring), 
and thereby always has an equal or predetermined chance to transmit data. This is dif- 
ferent from the contention method of access that we saw earlier with a bus network, 
where computers must contend for access to the media. 
A ring topology provides equal access to the network through a token-passing 
media access method. A signal called a token is passed from one computer to the next in 
the ring. When a computer has the token, it has access to the ring, and can send data. 
Because a computer can't use the ring without having the token first, this prevents two 
or more computers from transmitting on the network at the same time. 
The Token Ring method of access provides equal access to each of the computers. 
This method of access is discussed further in this chapter, under the standard IEEE 
802.5. When the token is passed, it is sent to its Nearest Active Downstream Neighbor 
(NADN). Once this computer takes the token from its Nearest Active Upstream 
Neighbor (NAUN), it now has the ability to transmit data. 
On a Token Ring network, the first computer that is booted up and accesses the 
ring is called the active monitor. It has the responsibility of monitoring the ring for prob- 
lems, such as a break in the ring, by sending out a packet of data to its NADN every 
seven seconds. This packet is passed around the ring until the active monitor receives it. 
This ensures that the ring is functioning without error. The role of the active monitor is 
important because a break in the cable means that the ring can't be completed and the 
network can't function properly. 

Network Fundamentals • Chapter 1 
33 
Since the topology requires an unbroken ring, the active monitor takes further mea- 
sures if it doesn't receive a packet from its NAUN, by beaconing and notifying the net- 
work if a break is detected. When a packet isn't received or is received later than every 
seven seconds, the active monitor sends out a packet with its address. This packet reaches 
the furthest point it can reach on the network, which indicates the location of a break 
or other problems. By detecting and reconfiguring the ring, it can now avoid the point 
where the break exists. By doing so, the network is able to function until the failed 
computer can be repaired. 
Networks that use a ring topology operate at varying speeds. Token Ring networks 
operate at 4 and 16Mbps. While newer Token Ring cards run at 16Mbps, they provide 
backward compatibility to run at 4Mbps, allowing them to remain compatible with 
older Token ring equipment. When speed really comes into play in a ring topology, 
however, is when FDDI (Fiber Distributed Data Interface) is used, which operates at 
100Mbps on rings of up to 100 kilometers in size. 
Ring topologies that use FDDI also have other characteristics that differ from stan- 
dard Token Ring networks. As shown in Figure 1.7, a FDDI ring topology uses two 
rings, which are fiber optic cabling. The primary ring is used at all times, while the sec- 
ondary ring is only used if the primary ring fails. Each of these rings passes data in dif- 
ferent directions. If a break occurs in the ring, the broken section can be bypassed by 
using the secondary ring. The token can be passed from one ring to another without 
causing a change in direction. By passing the token from one ring to another, much like 
a car making a U-turn and moving into the reverse lane, the ring essentially remains 
whole because the token can continue making a continuous loop. 
Figure 1.7 FDDI 
www.syngress.com 

34 
Chapter 1 • Network Fundamentals 
Another aspect of a FDDI ring is that priority levels can be set on specific 
machines, so that they have priority in getting the token. For example, if a higher pri- 
ority was set on a server, the server would get the token more frequently, allowing it to 
transmit data over the cable. This allows the computer with priority to send more data 
than others on the network. 
~ 
FDDI is covered in Chapter 7 with other WAN technologies. 
Wireless 
A wireless topology broadcasts data over the air, so very few cables are used to connect sys- 
tems together. As shown in Figure 1.8, this topology uses transmitters called cells, which 
broadcast the packets using radio frequencies (RI=). The cells extend a radio sphere around 
the transmitter in the shape of a bubble that can extend to multiple rooms and possibly 
different floors in a building. Each cell is connected to the network using cabling so that it 
can receive and send data to servers, other cells, and networked peripherals. Computers 
and other devices have a device installed in them that transmits and receives data to and 
from the cell, allowing them to communicate with the network. 
Figure 1.8 A Wireless Network 
~i~ II ~ 

Network Fundamentals 
• 
Chapter 1 
35 
Wireless networks can also extend their transmission to wireless devices by imple- 
menting radio antennas that are situated on buildings or towers. The antenna serves as a 
cell that will cover a wider area, such as a building or campus. This type of wireless net- 
work is particularly beneficial for pools of buildings that are close together and have 
some difficulty in connecting LANs to each other using cables. 
Another method of wireless networking uses infrared communications, which 
requires a direct line of site and close proximity for the communication to work. This 
type of wireless networking is similar to using a remote control for a TV, where each 
device has to be lined up and within range of one another. Because of these limitations, 
it isn't generally used for networking, but may be seen in a networked environment for 
connecting laptops and other computers to devices like printers. 
Because very little may be directly cabled together on a wireless network, there is a 
greater chance of transmissions being blocked or experiencing interference. Machinery 
and other devices can emit radio frequencies or electrical interference that disrupts sig- 
nals being exchanged between the cell and wireless devices. Also, some buildings using 
cinderblocks, large amounts of metal, or heavy insulation to prevent transmissions from 
interfering with equipment can interfere with a wireless signal enough so that a wireless 
network could be hampered from working between rooms.You may have experienced a 
blockage like this when you tried using a cell phone in certain buildings and found it 
didn't work. Signals are prevented from passing through these materials, and may require 
different frequencies to be used.

BASIC NETWORK TOPOLOGY PLANNING 
1. 
Determine what the needs of the network will be. Identify whether users will 
be routinely moving laptops or other networked devices between locations of 
the business. This will help to determine whether a particular type of LAN 
will be necessary, such as a wireless LAN. 
2. 
Determine the types of data being moved over the network, and/or how 
much data is currently being moved over the existing LAN (that is, the 
amount of traffic). As we saw with ring networks, a standard Token Ring 
network provides lower bandwidth than a FDDI ring.As we'll discuss in 

36 
Chapter 1 • Network Fundamentals 
Chapter 2, different network media support different speeds and thereby will 
be able to move different amounts of data. 
3. 
Determine whether the network is expanding over the next few years, and to 
what level that expansion will be. If mergers occur, the network may become a 
hybrid network with different topologies being used. If offices of computers 
are added (possibly in other buildings or cities), then additional nodes will be 
added to the topology, and the network will have to accommodate the extra 
computers and distances between sites. Distance is important to the network 
media being used, as we'll see in the next chapter. 
4. 
Determine how software will be accessed by the machines. If computers have 
applications installed on them, they will be able to function if the network 
goes down (such as when a cable breaks, or another device fails). If applications 
are accessed from a server on the network, then additional bandwidth will be 
used by computers attempting to access these applications. 
5. 
Choose the network topology that best meets the previous requirements, and 
draw out how it will be implemented. This includes the physical topology of 
how computers and devices are laid out (in a star, bus, mesh, or ring network), 
and the logical topology of IP addresses and subnetworks used on the network. 
6. 
Review the requirements of the network to see if anything has changed before 
the new topology is implemented, or the existing one is modified. Sometimes, 
new conditions can affect the planning of your network, and will need to be 
modified to meet these conditions. 
IEEE Committee 
IEEE is an acronym for the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, which is an 
organization that develops and promotes standards dealing with various technologies. 
These standards serve as principles and guidelines of technology. While they aren't gov- 
ernment regulations that need to be followed, they are industry standards that should be 
followed. The IEEE standards are agreed-upon standards that (when followed) ensure 
that networks and technologies can work together and are more secure. Although IEEE 
standards have been used when government regulations are created, manufacturers, 
developers, and technicians more commonly use the information in these standards. 
Those who design and manufacture equipment and software look to these standards 
so their products can be compliant with IEEE standards. For example, if you bought a 
digital camera, you would want to be able to transfer the pictures to your computer. 
Without standards, cameras might use different cables or ports to transfer this data, 
meaning that you couldn't transfer the data easily to just any computer. Apple developed 

Network Fundamentals • 
Chapter 1 
37 
FireWire as a method of connecting devices to computers and transferring large 
amounts of data quickly, and IEEE 1394 was developed as a nonproprietary standard of 
transferring audio and video. Without such standards, your devices would work with 
one type of computer (such as an Apple computer), but not with others (such as a PC). 
By adhering to these standards, products have the capability to be compatible with other 
technologies and can operate with other equipment. 
History and Fundamentals of IEEE 
The IEEE was formed in 1963 from a merger of two organizations: the American 
Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE) and the Institute of lKadio Engineers (IRE). The 
AIEE was founded in 1884, as one of a number of engineering societies at that time. It 
succeeded in developing industry and professional standards for those involved in the 
electrical and engineering fields. As new technologies emerged, it formed committees to 
address specialized fields. 
The Institute oflKadio Engineers was founded in 1912 as an amalgamation of two 
earlier societies, and focused on obtaining international memberships. This organization 
focused on issues of standardization in radio, and not only affected manufacturing, but 
also assisted in developing broadcasting regulations and were part of conferences that led 
to the formation of the Federal Radio Commission in 1927, which later became the 
Federal Communications Commission (FCC). As technologies advanced, the IRE also 
assisted in standards dealing with FM radio and television. 
While the IRE started as the smaller organization of the two, it eventually gained a 
greater membership than the AIEE. However, neither organization fully represented all 
fields associated with electrical or electronic engineering. This lead to a merger between 
the IRE and the AIEE in 1963, and inspired the name change to the Institute of 
Electrical and Electronic Engineers. 
Over the years, the IEEE has developed and promoted numerous standards, provided 
education through publications and journals, and expanded its role in electricity, elec- 
tronics and communications to also include computers. By creating committees to 
address emerging technologies and developments in computer engineering and com- 
puter science, they have been predominant in providing the standards used in computer 
hardware, software, and networking.

Chapter 1 • Network Fundamentals 
802 Standards 
IEEE standards use a numeric naming scheme to identify and group the technologies 
being addressed. Standards beginning with the number 802 relate to networking technolo- 
gies and security, and are developed and evaluated by specialized committees within IEEE. 
The 802 committee was first formed as a project in February 1980, and became 
known as Project 802 after the year (80) and month (2) it was created. After more than 
two decades, the members of the IEEE continue to review and provide industry stan- 
dards for LANs, WANs, and issues related to the various types of networks. 
The 802 committee is broken down into smaller sub-committees or working groups 
that focus on specific aspects of networking. The various groups that have worked on 
standards include: 
• 
802.1 Higher-Layer LAN protocols 
• 
802.2 Logical Link Control (Inactive) 
• 
802.3 CSMD/CD - Ethernet

DAY TIP 
~ In reading this book, you will find comments throughout that pinpoint areas 
where you need to focus your attention. Additional information may appear in 
the book that is useful to networking, or will enhance your understanding of 
~% 
various topics. In terms of IEEE standards, for example, not all of the IEEE stan- 
dards will appear on the exam. Ensure that you know 802.2 (Logical Link 
Control), 802.3 (CSMD/CD), 802.5 (Token Ring), and 802.11 (wireless LAN). 
Because technology changes, so do the working groups. New working groups are 
added to address emerging technologies, while others are disbanded or become inactive. 
Reasons for disbanding or making a group inactive vary, but when older technology 
isn't used as much or further standards aren't required, it makes sense to evaluate the 
need for a group. An up-to-date list of working groups and their status can be found on 
the IEEE website at http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/802/dots.html. 
OSI and 802 
The services and protocols specified in the 802 standards correspond to the lower layers 
of the OSI model. OSI is an acronym for Open Systems Interconnect, and the OSI 
model is a seven-layer structure that maps to a logical structure for network operations. 
It is often used to show how protocols work, and what happens when data is sent over a 
LAN. When communication is sent over a network, it starts at the topmost layer, and 
works its way down to the bottom layers. While we'll discuss OSI in great detail in 
Chapter 5, it's important that you understand the lower layers so you can fully compre- 
hend what certain standards deal with. 
The bottommost layers of the OSI model are the Data Link and Physical Layers. 
Earlier, we mentioned how data is broken into smaller pieces before it is sent over a net- 
work, which is a primary function of the Data Link Layer. When another computer 
receives these pieces of data, they are reassembled at the Data Link Layer, and passed up 
to higher layers so they can be further assembled into the data's original format and be 
used by an application. 
N,twork+[ 
The 802 standards break the Data Link Layer of the OSI model into two separate 
= ~  
subcategories: Logical Link Control (LLC) and Media Access Control (MAC). The 
Logical Link Control is responsible for starting and maintaining connections with 
devices, while the Media Access Control allows multiple devices to share the media 
(such as coaxial cable, twist pair, etcetera) that data is being sent over. In other words, 
when you send data to another computer, it is the LLC that establishes the connection 
with the other computer, and it is the MAC that allows more than one computer to 
communicate on the network. 
The Physical Layer of the OSI model deals with how data is moves on and off the 
network media. While it doesn't specify what media is used, it does identify how it is

IEEE working groups have generated a lengthy number of standards over the years. As 
you can see by these standards, each uses the numeric value of 802 to show it is part of 
the 802 committee's networking standards.A decimal value is used to designate the 
working group that developed it, and to show the standard it relates to, while a letter 
further categorizes specifications, supplements, and other addenda. While the 802 stan-

Table of Standards (Testable) 
While numerous IEEE standards have been developed for networking, the Network+ 
exam only tests your knowledge on a limited number of them. The standards you'll be 
tested on, and that we'll discuss here, are: 
• 
802.2 Logical Link Control 
• 
802.3 CSMA/CD 
• 
802.5 Token Ring 
• 
802.11 Wireless 
~ M WARNING 
~/ IEEE standards are an important part of networking, and chances are that you'll 
~ 
see questions about them during the exam. You'll be tested on main features of 
Logical Link Control, CSMA/CD (Ethernet), Token Ring, and wireless technolo- 
~@)~)~ gies. Because Token Ring and wireless technologies are also part of the topolo- 
gies we covered earlier in this chapter, you should review these topologies to 
have a firm understanding of the standards. 
802.2 LLC 
Earlier in this chapter, we explained how IEEE 802 standards break the Data Link Layer 
of the OSI model into two sublayers: the Media Access Control (MAC) and the Logical 

Network Fundamentals • Chapter 1 
47 
Link Control (LLC). The Logical Link Control is used to establish connections between 
computers, and is used by other protocols defined by the 802 committee. 
When the LLC receives data in the form of aflame from the layer above it (the 
Network Layer), it breaks the data apart into smaller pieces that can be sent over net- 
work media. It also adds header information that identifies upper layer protocols sending 
the frame, and can also specify destination processes for the data. The computer receiving 
the data will view this header information, and use it to reassemble the data into its 
proper format. 
802.3 CSMA/CD 
Based on the original Ethernet network from DIX (Digital-Intel-Xerox), 802.3 is the 
standard for Ethernet networks today. The only difference between 802.3 Ethernet and 
DIX Ethernet V.2 is frame type. The two Ethernet networks can use the same physical 
network, but devices on one standard cannot communicate with devices on the other 
standard. 
The MAC sublayer uses Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection 
(CSMA/CD) for access to the physical medium. CSMA/CD keeps devices on the net- 
work from interfering with one another when trying to transmit; if they do, a collision 
occurs. To reduce collisions, CSMA/CD devices listen to the network before transmit- 
ting. If the network is "quiet" (no other devices are transmitting), the device can send 
data. Since two devices can think the network is clear and start transmitting at the same 
time, resulting in a collision, all devices listen as they transmit. If a device detects another 
device is transmitting at the same time, a collision occurs. The device stops transmitting 
and sends a signal to alert other nodes about the collision. Then, all the nodes stop trans- 
mitting and wait a random amount of time before they begin the process again. 
INetwork_~ 
CSMA/CD doesn't stop collisions from happening, but it helps 
the situa- 
manage 
r,~-a,a tions when they do occur. In fact, collisions are a normal part of Ethernet operation. It's 
only when collisions begin to occur frequently that you need to become concerned. 
Ethernet has evolved over the years to include a number of popular specifications. 
These specifications are due in part to the media variety they employ, such as coaxial, 
twisted-pair, and fiber-optic cabling. 
• 
The 10Base5 specification, commonly referred to as Thicknet, was the original 
Ethernet specification and has a maximum distance of 500 meters (approxi- 
mately 1640 feet) with a maximum speed of 2.94 to 10Mbps. 
• 
The 10Base2 specification, commonly referred to as Thinnet, uses a thinner 
coaxial cable than 10Base5 does and has a maximum distance of 185 meters 
(approximately 607 feet) with a maximum speed of 10Mbps. 
• 
The 10BaseT specification uses twisted-pair cabling with a maximum distance 
of 100 meters (approximately 328 feet) with a speed of 10 to 100Mbps.

Chapter 1 • Network Fundamentals 
802.5 Token Ring 
Although Token Ring was first designed in the 1960s, IBM's token passing implementa- 
tion did not become a standard until 1985. The 802.5 standard was modeled after the 
IBM Token Ring network, which had been in use for many years before the standard 
was developed. 
The 802.5 network introduced a unique access method: token passing. The Token 
Ring IEEE 802.5 standard passes a special frame known as a token around the network. 
This token is generated by the first computer that comes online on the Token Ring net- 
work. When a workstation wants to transmit data, it grabs the token and then begins 
transmitting. This computer will send a data frame on the network with the address of 
the destination computer. The destination computer receives the data frame, modifies it, 
and sends it onto the network back to the original computer, indicating successful trans- 
mission of data. When the workstation is finished transmitting, the token is released back 
onto the network. This ensures that workstations will not simultaneously communicate 
on the network, as in the CSMA/CD method. 
802.11 Wireless 
The IEEE 802.11 standard addresses wireless networking, which we'll discuss in greater 
detail in Chapter 4. This standard includes the wireless access point (WAP) devices and 
the wireless network interface cards that are used to send and receive broadcasts from 
the cell or WAP device. 
The WAPs and wireless NICs can be set to use different frequencies to allow for cell 
overlap. This technology does not include the same technology used by cell phones to 
manage the movement of PCs or mobile devices. The wireless NIC is set to a specific 
frequency and must be changed manually to be able to communicate with another cell. 
This means that a PC cannot be moved from one cell area to another without changing 
frequency, unless for some reason the cells operate on the same frequency and have no 
overlap of coverage area. 
...... ::~i~;iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii 
ii!i!iiiiiiii 802 standards will be revisited again in Chapter 5, "The OSI Model". 
Request for Comments 
Another set of standards is Request for Comments (RFC). RFCs are a series of docu- 
ments that were originally started in 1969, before the Internet was even conceived of in 
its current form and was still in its infancy of being ARPANET. 

Network Fundamentals • Chapter 1 
49 
While not all of the RFCs specifically deal with the Internet, all of the Internet 
standards are written as Requests for Comments. They focus on networking protocols, 
communication issues, procedures, concepts and other topics. 
RFCs are created and maintained by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). 
The IETF is an organization that consists of vendors, network administrators, designers, 
researchers, and other professionals who are interested in the operation and future of the 
Internet. These people can provide proposals to the IETF, who in turn provides a con- 
sensus on new standards that should be added. The proposals that are submitted are 
called "Internet Drafts," which are reviewed by working groups that specialize in specific 
areas. If a standard is developed as a result of the Internet Draft, it is written as an RFC 
and categorized as a standard. 
Using RFCs 
RFCs are categorized using a number that is preceded by the prefm "RFC". For 
example, the RFC dealing with the Domain Name System (DNS) is RFC 1034. In 
reading a RFC, you will find that there is a section that shows the category or status of 
the document.These categories include: 
• 
Standards-track documents, which have the status of being a standard, draft 
standard, or proposed standard. This shows its current state in becoming a stan- 
dard. 
• 
Best Current Practice, which provides procedures and recommendations. 
• 
Informational, which provides information on various subjects. This category 
also includes the IETF's parody RFCs, such as RFC1217 (Memo from the 
Consortium for Slow Commotion Research [CSCR]), and RFC1438 
(Statements Of Boredom [SOBs]). 
• 
Experimental, which designates a particular practice or topic as experimental 
in nature. 
• 
Historic, which are standards that are no longer used. 
Because the IETF doesn't remove RFCs, all of them are still available to view. The 
RFCs that aren't used are listed as being historic documents, but are still available for 
reference purposes. This provides those using RFCs with the ability to review practices, 
principles, and protocols that are no longer in use, but may be valuable when previous 
standards have to be reviewed.

Chapter 1 • Network Fundamentals 
Summary of Exam Objectives 
In this chapter we discussed the fundamentals of networking, including what defines a 
network and how networks came to be. By providing an overview of these elements, we 
have provided a basic foundation for other topics covered throughout this book. 
We also looked at the various network models available for a network. A network 
can use a centralized or distributed model, and be designed as a client/server model or 
peer-to-peer. Each of these models provides its own benefits and drawbacks in terms of 
administration and how resources are managed. 
The differences in terms of the location and management of resources are clearly 
seen in centralized and decentralized models. When centralized models are used, the 
resources of the network are centrally located and managed by network administrators. 
This can increase the security of network resources, as they can be kept in a secure 
server room or in areas that limit access to the equipment and the data they contain. In a 
decentralized network, the resources are distributed across the network and are managed 
by system administrators or other network users who have been delegated responsibility 
over managing the resource. 
The client/server and peer-to-peer models of networking also differ from with one 
another in terms of how resources and administration are handled. Client/server net- 
works use dedicated servers that respond to clients' requests for services, data, and other 
resources. In this type of network, network administrators determine the levels of access 
specific users and computers will have to files, folders, and other resources on the net- 
work. Conversely, a peer-to-peer network allows each user to control access to resources 
on his or her machine. This is called share level access, where a user shares a particular 
file, folder, printer, or other resource on his or her computer. 
In creating a network, we also discussed how it will use one or more topologies, 
which is the physical layout of network components. The topologies we covered in this 
chapter are bus, star, ring, mesh, and wireless. 
Bus topologies aren't commonly used anymore, but they may appear on the exam as 
an alternative for smaller networks. With this type of LAN, the computers use T-connec- 
tors to attach the computers to a single cable segment. The single cable runs the length 
of the network and is terminated at each end using 50ohm terminators, which prevent 
signals from bouncing from one end of the segment to the other. Termination is neces- 
sary and only one computer at a time can transmit on this type of network. 
Star topologies are the most commonly used topology, and have each computer on 
the network cabled to a central concentrator. The computers in this topology send data 
along the cable to the concentrator, which is a hub or switch, which then redirects the

data to the proper machine or all machines on the LAN. Because everything is sent 
through the concentrator, it can be a single point of failure for the network.

Mesh topologies are the most fault tolerant because every device on the network is 
cabled to every other component. If one cable breaks, the computer or device is able to

continue working on the network because it still has a redundant connection. Because

What is a Network? 
A computer network exists when two or more machines are connected 
together, thereby allowing them to share data, equipment and other resources. 
An internetwork exists when two or more networks are connected together, as 
in the case of the Internet. 
A network protocol is a set of rules used to control transmission and reception 
of data on a networked computer. TCP/IP is a default protocol used by the 
Internet and many current operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows and 
Novell NetWare. 
Networking Models 
A centralized network model has resources and administration that is centrally 
located. As resources are centrally located, this provides administrators with 
better access and control over security of equipment. However, management of 
these resources increases for network administrators, who must now administer 
and manage them. 
A decentralized network model has resources and administration that is 
distributed throughout the network. Management of these devices decreases 
for the network administrator, as designated users or system administrators are 
delegated responsibility over them. 
F-¢I A peer-to-peer network model has computers on a network acting as equals, 
and acting as both clients and servers of the network. When one computer 
requests data or other services from another computer, it acts as a client, while 
the other computer delivering that data or service acts as a server. 
In a peer-to-peer network, the user of a computer can control access to 
resources on his or her machine. Using share level access, users can grant access 
to folders, files, and other resources on their computers to other network users. 
A client/server network model has dedicated servers that provide services and 
esting computers (clients) who are authorized to access them. 

Network Fundamentals, Chapter 1 157 
I-4I In a client/server network, a network administrator controls access to resources 
by setting appropriate levels of access to network accounts. The access given to 
the account of a user or computer determines which resources he or she 
......... 
can use. 
Network Types and Topologies 
V4I Local area networks (LANs) are small- to medium-sized networks, and 
generally connect network devices that are no more than a few miles from one 
another. 
V4I Wide area networks (WANs) can span great geographical distances, and 
connect different LANs together using high-speed solutions or telephone lines. 
gl Metropolitan area networks (MANs) connect LANs together within a limited 
geographical radius. MANs generally exist within the same city or within a 50-

cables, and other components. Common topologies include bus, star, ring, 
mesh, and wireless. 
Bus topologies are a linear topology in which computers are networked 
i~iiii~iiiiiiill 
together through a single segment of cable called a trunk, backbone, or 
segment. The trunk must be terminated at each end or signals will bounce 
~i~ iii iiiiiii~ 
back and forth, preventing others from transmitting data. 
17I Star topologies have computers connected to a central concentrator, 
commonly called a hub or switch. It is the most commonly used topology 
.... 
today. 
..... 
V'---Z Mesh topologies have every component of the network connected to every 
other component using multiple connections. It is the most fault tolerant 
~
i
 
topology available, but is also the most difficult to manage. The number of 
~ 
connections required by a mesh topology can be calculated using the formula 
Ln=n(n-1)/2. 
t 
Ring topologies have all computers connected to a cable that creates a closed 
i 
loop. The computer that can transmit data onto the cable is determined by 
which computer has a token. FDDI networks use two rings that send data in 
different directions and provide added fault tolerance. Token Ring networks 
operate at speeds of 4 and 16Mbps, while FDDI ring networks can operate at 
~iiiiiiii 
speeds of lOOMbps on rings that are up to 100 kilometers in size. 
ii~ 
I-4I Wireless topologies broadcast data over the air, and use few cables to connect 
~!! 
......... 
systems together. This topology allows data to be sent between different 
locations without cabling, and is useful in areas where it's difficult or 
impossible to wire computers together.

IEEE 
IEEE is an acronym for the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, 
which is an organization that develops and promotes standards dealing with 
various technologies. 
V4I The 802 committee is responsible for standards dealing with networks, and has 
subcommittees or working groups the develop industry standards. 
V¢I IEEE 802.2 is a standard for the Logical Link Control. It breaks the Data Link 
Layer of the OSI model into two sublayers: Media Access Control and Logical 
Link Control. The Logical Link Control is used to establish connections 
between computers, and is used by other protocols defined by the 802 
committee.

are designed to both measure your understanding of the Exam Objectives 
presented in this chapter, and to assist you with real-life implementation of these 
concepts. You will also gain access to thousands of other FAQs at ITFAQnet.com. 
Q: What is the purpose of a WAN, and how could it be applied to a network? 
A: A WAN allows organizations in diverse geographical locations to be connected and 
function as if they were part of the same LAN. It can be applied to a network by 
implementing a high-speed connection between the two offices. 
Q" Which networking component is the most likely to fail? 
A: Cables. Cables are a common point of failure. Other network components have less 
failing than a damaged or faulty cable,

A: T3 lines are the fastest, but they are also the most expensive. T1 and T3 lines cost 
thousands of dollars a month, and may be more than your organization needs. 
Before deciding on a particular connection for your network, try to determine what 
users will be using it for, how often, and how much data will be transferred from

6 0  
Chapter 1 • Network Fundamentals 
A: The mesh topology is the most fault tolerant, because it uses multiple connections 
to the network. In this topology every computer is connected to every other com- 
puter, so if one cable breaks, the computer can continue using the network via 
another connection. 
Q" My company is thinking of using wireless technology, but I've heard that hackers 
can access the data being transmitted using wireless. Should this be a concern? 
A" Network security should always be a concern. Data being transmitted using wireless 
technology can be protected using data encryption methods, which can prevent 
unwanted individuals from being able to decipher the data they capture from wire- 
less signals. 
Q" What is the need for standards in networking? 
A: Standards provide common methods and criteria for designing, developing, and 
manufacturing the hardware and software used in networks. It allows different 
devices to communicate with one another, regardless of who manufactured them, so 
that networks aren't limited to using proprietary equipment. It also provides best 
practices, recommendations, and information that is necessary to network communi- 
cation (such as protocols that allow devices to transfer data).

The network used in your organization uses the IEEE 802.3 standard. Before 
sending data onto the network, a computer will listen to ensure the network is 
clear so that two computers don't send data onto the cable at the same time. When 
two computers send out data at the same time, which of the following is true? 
..............................................
A. A critical network error will have occurred from a collision, and the network 
will crash. 
B. The computer detecting the collision will send out a signal to all other com- 
puters. Because the collision has been detected, all devices will stop transmit- 
ting data for a random period of time, listen to see if the network is free of 
traffic, and then begin sending data again. 
C. The computer detecting the collision will send out a signal to all the other 
computers. Because it detected the problem, it now has precedence over the 
other computers, and can send its data before any other computer. 
D. None of the above. This cannot happen because the computers listen for net- 
work traffic before sending, which prevents data collisions from ever occurring.

Chapter 2 • Network Media 
Introduction 
In this chapter, we'll take a look at what you will need to know about cable connections 
and termination for the Network+ exam. When working in the field of networking, it's 
nearly impossible to not come across physical cabling. Unless you have wireless media 
(covered in Chapter 4), you will need some form of cabling, and need some form of 
endpoint, or termination, to your transmission media and a way for it to physically con- 
nect to a device. 
This endpoint is called a connector, and it terminates the end of the media, creating a 
way for it to connect to something else such as a patch panel, switch port, or other con- 
nection. This chapter shows you what you need to know about connecting and termi- 
nating the most common forms of cable in use today: copper in the form of twisted-pair 
cable, coaxial cabling, and fiber optics. The understanding of transmission media types, 
connectors, and termination is essential to being a networking professional. In this 
chapter we will learn the fundamentals of cabling, the connectors used with them, and 
the most common tools of the trade. 
Cabling and Connectors Overview' 
The media that carries data makes up the basic infrastructure of a network. If you con- 
sidered data as a vehicle that moves between two points, then cabling and connectors are 
the highways and interchanges that allow data to access and travel across that network. 
Connectors attached to the ends of the cables are plugged into or coupled in some way 
with a network card or other device on your network. In doing so, a physical link is cre- 
ated between this device and others on your network. Just as a car uses an on ramp to 
enter a highway, the connector provides an access point for data to move along the cable 
to its intended destination. 
The purpose of a cable is to carry data across a network. In doing so, a network card 
passes an electronic signal onto a cable. A connector is used to connect the cable to the 
network card or other device to the cable. The data, in the form of an electronic signal, 
is passed through the connector to a wire or fiber in the cable. Just as the wires in your 
house carry electricity to the lights and wall sockets in each room, the cable carries 
these electronic signals to the computers, printers or other network devices meant to 
receive them. 
While local area networks (LANs) of the past often used one type of cabling, many 
LANs today use a combination of different cable types. This is because different cables 
will carry the data at varying speeds and distances. While some cables can carry the data 
for a hundred meters or so, others can span greater distances, connecting widely Spanned 
areas. In the same way, some cables will allow a network to transfer millions of bits data, 
while others can send a thousand times this amount. As we'll see later in this chapter, the 
features of a particular type of cable can vary greatly.

Because different types of cabling are available to use, it follows that there are also 
different types of connectors that may be used. The connectors fit on the ends of the 
cabling, and are designed to hold the wires or fibers within the cabling together, 
allowing them to make a connection when the connector is plugged into or coupled 
with a network device. If you think of a cable used on your telephone, each end of the 
phone cable has a connector that bundles the wires in the cable together in a specific 
way, so they can make a connection when the cable is plugged into the corresponding 
telephone or wall jack. The connectors on a network cable are the same, providing an 
interface for a device to connect to a cable. 
Fundamentals of Cabling 
Cabling is the wire or fiber medium that is used to connect computers and other net- 
work devices of your network together, and used to carry the data that is transmitted 
between them. While we'll discuss each of the types of cabling in greater detail later in 
this chapter, there are three types of physical media that can be used on a network: 
• 
Coaxial cable 
• 
Twisted-pair cable 
• 
Fiber optic cable 
Coaxial cable, also referred to as coax, is the same type of cabling you see in most 
cable television installations today. A single copper wire at the center of the cable core is 
used to carry the signals, and is surrounded by layers of insulation that protect the wire 
and its transmissions. On networks, there are higher grades and different types of coaxial 
that may be used: thin (10Base2) or thick (10Base5) are two examples. 
The thin and thick kinds of coaxial cabling refer to the thickness of the cable. 
10Base2 cabling, also known as Thinner, is 0.25 inches while 10Base5 cabling, also 
known as Thicknet, is 0.5 inches. Because a thicker wire was used in 10Base5, it allows 
data to travel further than its thinner counterpart. This made 10Base5 ideal as a back- 
bone for early networks, although the increased speeds and distances supported by fiber 
optic cabling has become a better solution for modern networks.

Twisted-pair cable is a type of cabling that's used for telephone and network com- 
munications. When we mentioned the cable used to connect your phone to a wall jack, 
we were discussing a type of cable called twisted-pair. As shown in Figure 2.1, twisted-

Chapter 2 • Network Media 
pair cables have one or more pairs of copper wires that are insulated and twisted around 
one another, which prevent the signals on the wires from interfering with one another. 
Common sources of interference are EMI (electromagnetic interference) and RFI (radio 
frequency interference). Problems may occur such as the untwisting of pairs. In this case, 
the twisted pairs may open up of loosen and will be more susceptible to EMI and RFI. 
As we'll see later in this chapter, there are different categories of twisted-pair 
cabling, which are used for different purposes as well as to discuss common issues with 
interference. 
Figure 2.1 Twisted-Pair Wiring 
INSULATION 
COPPER 
WIRE 
Twisted-pair cabling may be shielded or unshielded. The difference between 
unshielded twisted-pair (UTP) and shielded twisted pair (STP) is that STP has an extra 
layer of aluminum/polyester between the wire and the plastic covering. This acts as a 
shield against interference from outside sources that could corrupt data carried on the 
copper wire. 
Fiber optic cabling is different from these other types of cabling, as it doesn't use 
copper wires to transmit data. Fiber optic cables use glass or plastic to transmit light 
pulses across the network. Because information is transmitted at the speed of light, it can 
carry more information faster than other types of cabling. 
Fundamentals of Connectors 
Connectors are used to hold the ends of the wires or fibers in a cable in place, so that it 
can then be plugged into a network card or other equipment on your network. As you 
can see when looking at the cable connectors used for your phone and cable television, 
these connectors may be plastic or metal, and differ greatly in appearance. This makes 
them easy to identify both in the real world and on the Network+ exam. 
There are several different kinds of connectors that may be used with the different 
types of cabling, which we'll explain in detail later in this chapter. They are: 

Network Media • Chapter 2 
71 
• 
BNC (Bayonet-Neill-Concelman) is a type of locking connector used to ter- 
minate coaxial cables. BNC is also referred to by many other names such as 
Bayonet Network Connector, British Naval Connector, or Bayonet Nut 
Connector. 
• 
R.J (registered jack) is used with twisted-pair cables. RJ-11 is used for phone 
cables, while RJ-45 is a twisted-pair cable that is commonly used in networks. 
• 
SC (standard connector) is used with fiber optic cabling. 
• 
ST (straight tip) is used with fiber optic cabling. 
• 
LC (local connector) is used with fiber optic cabling. 
• 
MTR.J (mechanical transfer registered jack) is used with fiber optic cabling. 
These different types of connectors attach a cable to network cards and other 
devices in different ways. Some, like RJ-11, RJ-45, and ST connectors are plugged into 
a port, while others like BNC and ST connectors have threading that is used to screw 
the connector into place. To put this into a perspective of something you're familiar 
with, the ILJ connectors are plugged in just as you would plug your phone cord into the 
telephone. BNC connectors are screwed onto a corresponding port in the same way you 
attach you're the cable used for cable television to the back of your TV. Once the con- 
nector is attached to the network card or another device, it provides a connection 
between the device and the physical media that carries data across your network. 
Media Issues 
As with anything dealing with networks, there are issues that you'll need to consider 
when deciding on what's best for your organization. The different types of physical 
media available each have their own benefits and vulnerabilities that can affect network 
performance and the amount of work required to install, troubleshoot, and repair 
cabling. Some types of cabling can carry more data at faster speeds, and over longer dis- 
tances. Other types are more susceptible to interference that can corrupt data or have 
security issues that make them more vulnerable to attack. By knowing the issues related 
to each media type, you can make a better decision on which cabling will best suit the 
needs of your network. 
Interference 
If you've ever listened to a radio during a storm, you've probably heard the crackles and 
pops of static when lightning interferes with the radio transmission. Just as the electricity 
of lightning can interfere with radio signals, similar interference can effect the transmis- 
sion of data across a network cable. EMI is a low voltage, low current, high frequency 
signal that can interfere with the electronic signals transmitted over cabling. Because the 
EMI signals come from outside sources and interrupt the information sent over cabling, 
it is often referred to as noise. 
r

Chapter 2 • Network Media 
EMI can result from numerous sources. Power lines, transformers, fluorescent lights 
and fixtures, industrial tools, engines, and other machinery and equipment that run on 
electricity can emit electromagnetic waves that affect other devices and data transmitted 
over cabling. The electromagnetic field generated by these devices is a natural byproduct 
of electricity being passed through the wiring, and its effects are not only seen in 
cabling, but also in other computer technology. For example, if you place a lamp or fan 
near your monitor, you may find that the screen flickers because the EMI of the lamp is 
causing interference with the monitor. 
Similar to EMI is RFI, which is caused by electromagnetic radiation in the radio 
frequency range. RFI can be caused by radio and television broadcast towers, microwave 
satellite dishes, appliances, and furnaces. Just as with EMI radiation, RFI can result in 
data being corrupted during transmission. 
The effects of EMI or RFI can be reduced or eliminated by properly grounding 
equipment, not placing cables close to sources of EMI or RFI, and using cables that use 
shielding or are more resistant to EMI/RFI.A shield is material in the cabling that's 
used to absorb EMI/RFI before it reaches the wires that carry data. Unshielded twisted- 
pair is the most vulnerable type of cabling because it doesn't use any shielding to protect 
the wires in the cable. Shielded twisted-pair is more resistant to EMI/RFI because of a 
layer of aluminum/polyester between the wire and the outer plastic covering of the 
cable. A similar shield is found in coaxial cable, which uses a wire mesh or foil shielding 
in the cable. The only cabling that is unaffected by EMI/RFI, however, is fiber optic 
cabling, which doesn't contain any copper wiring and uses plastic or glass that is non- 
conductive. While we'll discuss the internal components of these cables later in this 
chapter, using cables that provide shielding or aren't affected by EMI/RFI will prevent 
data from being corrupted during transmission. 
Another type of interference that can occur in cabling is crosstalk. Crosstalk occurs 
when the electromagnetic field of one wire interferes with the transmission of another. 
That is, the signals from one wire essentially bleed onto another wire.You may have expe- 
rienced this in a telephone system, when you hear someone else's conversation on your 
phone line. In networks, this type of interference can cause a loss or corruption of data. 
Crosstalk can be reduced or eliminated by first ensuring that the twists in the wire 
pairs stay together and intact, by moving the cables further apart from one another or by 
using cables that use shielding. As with EMI/RFI interference, UTP is the most vulner- 
able to crosstalk, while STP and coaxial cable have shielding that protects the wire from 
outside interference. Fiber optic cabling is immune from crosstalk because it uses light 
rather than electronic signals to transmit data. 
~iiii!~i~iiiiiiiiiii)i~ii~ 
ING 
!ii)iiii!  
Don't get crosstalk confused with EMI. Remember that when one cable has its 
data communications bleed onto another cable, it is crosstalk. EMI can come 
from any number of sources, including florescent lights or machinery.

Bandwidth 
Bandwidth is a measurement of the amount of data that can be passed over a cable in a 
given amount of time. If you compare cabling to a highway, and data to vehicles trav- 
eling along the highway, then bandwidth would be the amount of traffic supported. Just 
as too many cars traveling on a highway would cause a traffic jam, there is a limit to the 
amount of data a cable can support before the network becomes bogged down. 
Bandwidth is generally measured in increments of bits and bytes. A bit is short for 
binary digit, and is the smallest unit of data on a computer. When information is pro- 
cessed or sent across a wire or circuit board, it is passed as an electric current. The signal 
is either a high current or low current of electricity, and represented digitally by a 1 or 
0. Each of these ones and zeros is referred to as a bit, and eight bits of data make a byte. 
A word is considered 4 bytes, which is essentially 32 bits.., the same length as an IP 
(Internet Protocol) address, which we will learn about in Chapter 6. 
The bandwidth capacity of a network cable is usually measured in the number of 
bits or bytes that can be transferred in a second. In modem connections, thousands of 
bits may be sent, with each thousand referred to as Kbps (kilobits per second). In net- 
work cabling, considerably more data can be sent more quickly. Bandwidth may be mea- 
sured in megabits per second (Mbps), with each megabit representing a million bits of 
data transmitted each second, or in the gigabits per second (Gbps), meaning that 1000 
million bits of data are transferred for every 1 gigabit supported. Table 2.1 shows the 
bandwidth capacity of different media standards, which we'll discuss in greater detail 
later in this chapter, and how this capacity varies depending on the media being used.

Chapter 2 • Network Media 
...... ~'i'~i!!iiiiiiiiii ii iii iiiii~=~' An easy way of remembering the maximum bandwidth of the various media stan- 
:~i!il i i i~' dards is to look at the number at the front of the standard, which refers to the 
:ii!! 
: 
number of megabits supported. In looking at 10Base5, the 10 symbolizes that the 
.................. maximum transmission speed is 10 Mbps, while the word Base indicates that it is 
using a baseband technology (as opposed to broadband). The final portion of the 
media standard varies in meaning. Originally, the number at the end indicated the 
maximum distance of the cable. For example, the 5 in 10Base5 indicates that it 
has a maximum distance of 500 meters, while the 2 in 10Base2 was a rounded-up 
indication of its 185 meter maximum distance. This changed, however, with 
10BaseT, which signifies that twisted-pair cabling is used. 
If the amount of data exceeds the amount of bandwidth supported, the cabling can 
become a bottleneck because the transmission speed will be affected. Just like an 
example of plumbing with piping and water, as liquid being poured will slow when it 
reaches the narrow end of a tube, data transfers can slow if more data is being sent than 
the cabling can support. It should now make complete sense to you why bandwidth can 
be precious, especially for your wide area network (WAN) connections (discussed in 
more detail in Chapter 7). WAN links are costly and you will likely want to use every 
ounce of bandwidth you can squeeze out of it. 
To follow a real world example, if 10BaseT UTP cable was used to transfer data 
between floors of a building, then upwards of 10 Mbps of data could be sent. If consid- 
erably more than this amount was being sent across the network on a routine basis, then 
cabling that supported a higher bandwidth (such as fiber optic) would be needed. When 
designing a network, it is important to consider the amount of data that will be trans- 
ferred so the proper cabling can be initially installed. As the requirements of the network 
grow, replacing existing cabling with cables that support a higher bandwidth capacity 
may be necessary. 
Length Problems 
The length of cabling is an important consideration when deciding on the cable that 
will be used for a network. As signals travel the length of a cable, they will weaken over 
distance. The signals will eventually degrade until they reach the point where the data is 
lost. When this occurs, it is referred to as attenuation. 
Because attenuation can occur, it is important that you don't exceed the maximum 
distance of a cable. Table 2.2 shows the maximum lengths of various media standards, 
which we'll discuss in greater detail later in this chapter. As you can see, physical media 
can have a maximum distance ranging from hundreds of meters to kilometers in length. 
If a cable has to be run longer than its maximum distance, then the signal will have to 
be regenerated. In the past, a device called a repeater performed this task. As we'll discuss 
www.syngress.com

in the next chapter, repeaters aren't generally found on modern networks, but this same 
functionality is found in other network devices, such as switches, routers and hubs.

Chapter 2 • Network Media 
over distance, fiber optic uses light and/or laser passed over glass or plastic fibers, so it 
doesn't suffer from the same problems. While twisted-pair and coaxial cables can span a 
distance of hundreds of meters, signals will run along fiber optic cable for kilometers 
without any noticeable signal degradation. It's for this reason that fiber optic cabling is 
used for connecting locations of a network that are separated by significant distance. 
Security Issues 
The security of cabling is another important issue that should be considered before 
installing a particular kind of cabling. Different organizations and locations may require 
different types of cabling to meet the security needs outlined in policies or regulations. 
In other situations, such as a small office home office (SOHO), security may be a minor 
issue. Because needs differ, you should try to establish what the security needs are before 
installation begins. In determining the kind of cable you'll install, you will also need to 
be aware of security issues that are inherent to certain types of cabling. 
If you've watched any crime dramas on television, you've probably heard of wiretap- 
ping. Often, this refers to gaining access and listening to someone's telephone line 
without the person knowing about it. However, as we've said, the same or similar 
cabling used for voice communication is also used in networking. Wiretapping is as 
much a security risk for network cabling as it is for a business telephone line. 
Wiretapping involves gaining physical access to a network cable. The cable must be 
cut or pierced so that the wires inside the cable can be accessed and then spliced or 
tapped. Because of the shield in STP cabling, this is more difficult to do than with UTR 
Older networks that use coaxial cabling often recognize the risk of wiretapping because 
tapping is required on 10Base5 (Thicknet) cables to add new workstations. A tool called 
a vampire tap is used to clamp onto the coaxial cable and pierce it.A needle is then 
dropped into the hole in the cable, so that contact is made with the wire inside of the 
cable. This tap provides a connection so that 10Base2 cabling can be used to connect a 
computer to the cable, and access data traveling along the cable. 
Fiber optic cabling is the least susceptible to wiretapping because of the glass or 
plastic fibers used to carry the data. It is difficult to tap into the cable without causing 
damage, although optical vampire taps do exist that allow a tap to be performed by 
clamping onto the cable. Generally though, a tap requires cutting the cable before tap- 
ping it, which may provide an obvious clue that a problem exists. 
Another security issue related to cables is eavesdropping. Eavesdropping is the act of 
listening to data being sent over the wire without actually piercing the cable. As we 
learned earlier when we discussed crosstalk and EMI from other cables, the signals of a 
cable can bleed off and be picked up by other wires in neighboring cables. The same 
factors that make it possible for EMI to cause interference with cabling also make it pos- 
sible for someone to obtain data from the cable without piercing it. To minimize the risk 
of eavesdropping, you should use cabling that is less susceptible to EMI (STP or coaxial) 
or immune to it altogether (fiber optic).

Installation 
The level of difficulty in installing physical media varies depending on the type used and 
where the cabling is being installed. In some situations, such as a home office, it can be 
incredibly simple, but in others, such as running cable down an elevator shaft to connect 
two floors of a building, the installation can be challenging. Depending on the cabling 
and the location, you may be able to easily install the cabling yourself, or may opt to 
outsource to a company that specializes in cable installation. 
Installation of twisted-pair cable is relatively easy. UTP is similar to the cable used 
for phone lines, so it is thinner and more flexible than other types of cabling, making it 
easier to get around corners. STP is more difficult to bend than UTP because of the 
shielding. STP requires an electrical ground with the connectors, which is why it is 
easier to use pre-wired cables that already have the connectors installed. It is never rec- 
ommended that you make cable if you either don't know how, or don't have equipment 
to test the cable that you made. 
STP is thicker than UTP, making it more rigid, which can make it more difficult to 
install around corners. While the shielding providers greater benefits against EMI, the 
installation of the cabling can be more problematic. STP is also more difficult to make 
and more expensive than UTP. 

78 
Chapter 2 • Network Media 
Coaxial cable is also relatively easy to install. If you've ever extended the cable for 
your cable TV, you're probably familiar with some of the ease and difficulty you'll face. 
The connectors for coaxial cable are fairly simple to install, but the cable is relatively 
thick and rigid, and can require some finesse in navigating it around corners. 
Installation of fiber optic cabling can be difficult, which is why many companies 
outsource the job of installing and maintaining it to other firms, such as a local phone 
company. Not only is it somewhat difficult to install, it is also difficult to test. Cable 
testers are your insurance that a line is good, tested ok, and is operational so you do not 
have to come back to fix it or spend more time troubleshooting it. 
Because glass or plastic is used to carry the data, connecting two pieces of cabling 
together can prove difficult, as they must be fused together. Because of the cost of fiber 
optic cables, it generally isn't installed throughout an entire network. Rather, fiber is 
often used as a backbone for networks, connecting different buildings together so that 
data can be transmitted quickly between them. While other types of cabling are used 
within the buildings, a local phone company or another firm that specializes in fiber 
optic installation may be used to install and maintain the fiber optic cabling. 
Troubleshooting 
Experienced network administrators know that cabling is one of the most common 
causes of network failure. For this reason, you should check cabling early in the network 
troubleshooting process. Because you are often responding to a single workstation or 
group of computers that can't communicate within the network, start at that point and 
then work outward. There is no point in checking the backbone of the network if a 
single computer is having a problem. Also, because the workstation is probably using 
twisted-pair or 10Base2 coaxial cable, it is also the easiest to check first. 
Most often, the cable running from the workstation to the wall jack is the one that 
will be the problem. This cable receives the most abuse, and may be damaged. 
Sometimes you may fix the problem by simply plugging the cable back in if it has fallen 
out or has otherwise been unplugged. Because of this, you should perform a visual 
inspection of cabling. Simply reviewing the cables and surrounding area will provide 
clues of possible wiretapping, tampering, electrical work that may have affected the 
cabling, or other things that are out of the ordinary. 
If you believe a bad cable may be the culprit of a network-related problem, the most 
logical step is to test your hypothesis by replacing the cable with a known good cable. 
The results are simple: if you can communicate once again, then the old cable was the 
source of the problem. If you still cannot communicate with the known good cable, you 
need to continue troubleshooting or find another cable to test. 
In troubleshooting cabling, you should also be aware that some apparent cabling 
problems may actually be hardware-related.You should determine whether the network 
interface card (NIC), which we'll discuss in Chapter 3, is faulty and not communicating 
with the network properly. 

Network Media • 
Chapter 2 
79 
As you work outward from the problem, look for possible sources of interference, 
such as florescent lighting, machinery, or cables that are too close to each other. As we 
discussed earlier, interference from such sources can cause corrupt data and disrupt net- 
work communications. 
Because there is a limit to how far cable can run before it suffers attenuation, you 
should also check cable distances. If the maximum distance for cabling has been reached, 
then you may need to install a device that will regenerate the data and pass it along to 
the next segment. We'll discuss such devices in Chapter 3. 
Using tools that are designed for troubleshooting cable problems is another impor- 
tant factor in solving such problems quickly. As we'll see later in this chapter, there are a 
number of tools that can be used to check for breaks. These tools are a necessity to find 
where a problem exists in the cabling, and will save considerable time in solving cabling 
issues. 
Repair 
The ease with which different cabling types can be repaired depends on the cable type 
itself. The repair of copper cable is relatively easy. As we'll see later in this chapter when 
we discuss cabling and cable creation, twisted-pair and coaxial cabling may require 
replacement of a bad section with a new section of cable. Twisted-pair may require 
rewiring the individual wires of a new section to a connector, while coaxial could use 
male and female barrel connectors to attach a new section of cable to an existing one. 
Because copper wire is involved, this makes it a relatively simple procedure. Because of 
how inexpensive coaxial and twisted-pair cables are, it is often easier to simply replace 
the segment of cable with a new one, unless it is a particularly long segment. 
Repair of fiber optic cabling is difficult, and requires professional training. If there is 
a bad section that has to be replaced, connecting a new section would require using 
either electric fusion or a chemical epoxy process to connect the segments together. 
Unless you have the necessary tools and training to perform such repairs, it is generally 
wiser to have a firm that specializes in such repairs do it for you. Repair of fiber optic 
cable is not just difficult; it is also costly. Most times, organizations need only a single 
fiber run, so it is cost-prohibitive to do this work yourself.

Cable Testers and Troubleshooting 
In many troubleshooting sessions, there is a time where a simple isolation of problems is 
just not feasible. In such situations, you will need to rely on electronic tools to deter- 
mine what and where the problem is. Cable testers are tools that can analyze the capa- 
bility of a cable to carry signals, and can find breaks or other problems in the wire. In 
addition to cable testers, there are also other tools that can be used in the trou- 
bleshooting process to identify problems on your network. In the sections that follow, 
we will look at the most common ones. 
Tone Generator (Fox and Hound) 
The tone generator is used to perform tests on phone and network lines by clipping to a 
wire, terminal panel, or standard modular jack, and will aid in the identification of wires 
during the wire tracing process.A tone generator can be connected to a data or voice 
line and it is used to find out where a cable end may be. A test signal is sent across a 
wire pair to transmit a tone (as in dial tone).You can quickly and easily trace pairs and 
locate broken pairs in the cabling, even those buried deep in the walls. 
To use a tone generator, you begin by attaching the fox to the cable, jack, or panel 
that you would like to trace, and you continue with the hound on the other end of the 
cable to find the fox's tone. When you find the tone, you will know that you have cor- 
rectly tracked the cable. This is very helpful in determining which cable in a group of 
many cables, such as a wiring closet, has gone bad and needs to be replaced, or if the 
cable installer did not correctly or properly mark the patch panel. 
Time Domain Reflectometer 
A time domain reflectometer (TDR) also uses signals it sends down the cable to identify 
problems. An electronic pulse travels down the cable until it is reflected back, much like 
how sonar technology works. The TDR then calculates the distance down the cable that 
the signal traveled before being reflected by measuring the amount of time it took for 
the signal to be returned. If this distance is less than your overall cable length, a cable 
problem exists. It will most likely be behind a wall or in a place where it will be very 
difficult to get to. 
Wire Map Tester 
A wire map tester is generally used on networks that use twisted-pair cabling. It will test 
for opens, shorts, and crossed pairs, and will provide information that may indicate 
improper wiring. Because they are a low-cost cable tester, they generally provide fewer 
features than other cable testers, such as TDRs.

Oscilloscope 
An oscilloscope can determine if there are shorts or crimps in the cable.An oscilloscope 
formats its output in a graphical format. Oscilloscopes are commonly used to test cables 
that have been recently run through walls to ensure there are no problems with the 
cable prior to using it. 
Network Monitors and Protocol Analyzers 
Network monitors and protocol analyzers monitor traffic on the network and display 
the packets that have been transmitted across the network. If a particular type of packet 
is not being transmitted across the network, the problem may lie with that particular 
packet type. Since the network monitor enables you to view the contents of all packets 
on the network, in many cases, viewing the contents of these packets is considered 
unethical or even illegal. As such, you should determine the company's policy on using 
these tools before implementing them as part of the troubleshooting process. 
Crossover Cable 
A crossover cable appears to be just another twisted-pair cable, but two wires are crossed, 
which makes the cable unfit for plugging into a computer and a hub for normal use. 
The crossover cable is used to connect two computers to each other directly, without 
the use of a hub. 
A crossover cable is also used to connect hubs in the event you need to cascade 
them. If you were to substitute a crossover cable for a regular twisted-pair cable to con- 
nect two hubs, it would not work correctly. Therefore, it is important that you mark 
your crossover cables or use a different color cable to designate a crossover cable. Many 
companies use yellow or black cables for regular cables and blue for crossover cables.You 
will not need many crossover cables, and you can make them yourself if you have the 
correct pinout. There are a few things to remember about making a crossover cable. 
First, make sure you label it or know how to distinguish it from other cables such as a 
straight through. This is because you may use the wrong type of cable and that may be 
the cause of your issues, when all along it could have been prevented with the proper 
labeling of the cable. Exercise 2.1 shows you how to make a crossover cable from a stan- 
dard straight through cable. 
EXERCISE 2.1 
MAKING A CROSSOVER CABLE 
This exercise will show you how to properly construct a crossover network cable 
from a preexisting straight through cable. In this exercise you will need tools to 
help you cut and create the wire. These tools (which will be discussed 
throughout the text and can be further researched online) are as follows. 
www.syngress.com 

82 
Chapter 2 • Network Media 
You will need a preexisting cable. If you are already familiar with making 
cable, you can use a fresh length from a bulk cable spool if you have one avail- 
able, but if not, then you can use a preexisting cable to perform this task. You 
will definitely want it to be Category 5 or above. You will also need connectors 
(RJ-45 modular plugs).You will also need a cutter to cut the wire. A cutter can 
be a standard pair of scissors or a high-end cutting tool made specifically for 
the job of cutting cable. Since cutting cable has to be exact, neat, and (most 
importantly) the 8 wires have to be cut evenly to fit in the RJ-45 connector, it's 
important to consider using the right tool for the job. A crimper is also needed 
to squeeze the RJ-45 connector onto the cable making it a permanent fit. This 
cannot be undone, nor do you want to. Mistakes here should be met with a 
new cut of the end of the Category 5 cable and a new end created. You will 
also need a stripper to pull the cable jacketing off the wire to expose it. Make 
sure that you do not damage any of the wires. Although making cable can be 
easy, a lot of care needs to go into its creation in order for it to work properly. 
Now that you have your tools ready and the cable you want to turn into a 
crossover cable, let's look at the actual steps involved in making the cuts and 
creating the cable. 
, 
, 
Take a new (or tested) Category 5 UTP cable and ensure it is rated prop- 
erly (check the outer jacket to ensure that this cable is Category 5 UTP). 
Now that that has been determined, take your cutter and snip off one 
of the ends of the cable you are about to make into a crossover cable. 
Once you have made the cut, ensure that the cut is clean, meaning that 
there are eight wires cut evenly across with a hint of copper showing at 
the tip of each exposed wire. The copper ends will touch the contacts 
located within the RJ-45 connector. This is essentially why the cut has to 
be clean; it has to fit neatly into the connector and make connection 
with the contacts. 
, 
Now, strip off some of the excess jacket (about 1-3 inches) and reveal 
the inside wires so that you can work with them. You will have to 
untwist the pairs a bit to get them into the RJ-45 connector, but be 
careful not to untwist them too much, as the twists are what keep the 
phenomenon of crosstalk down. An example of exposed and twisted 
wire can be seen in Figure 2.2. 

Network Media • Chapter 2 
83 
Figure 2.2 Viewing Exposed Cable 
° 
° 
, 
Once you have stripped off the jacket to expose the wires, you will need 
to spread the wires apart (carefully) in a fan so that you can clearly see 
the colors on each of the individual wires; 4 pairs of 2 wires each, each 
following a tip/ring combination of specific color codes. 
Make absolutely sure that you hold on to the base of the jacket so that 
you can keep the twists tight at the base where you cut the wire's 
jacket. You do not want the wires to become untwisted down inside the 
jacket. Once you are ready, you have to re-order the cables so that the 
transmit (TX) and receive (RX) channels are reversednhence the name 
crossover. Later in the chapter we will look at the wiring pairs in detail. 
To make a crossover cable, all you need to do is change one of the cable 
ends to a different standard. 
568A standard end on one side, 568B standard on the other end makes 
a crossover cable. Although cabling standards at this depth are not cov- 
ered in the Network+ exam, it's still very important to know as a net- 
work technician. You will learn about the cabling pinouts later in the 
chapter. 
7. 
Once you insert the cable pairs into the RJ-45 connector, you need to 
make absolutely sure that no cable is exposed outside of the RJ-45 con- 
nector. What this means is that if you cut the cable too long, it will have 
exposed wires, as the jacket is not able to protect them. Make sure that 
you cut the jacket so that the connector covers it so you don't have any 
open leakage for interference or wire pairs that can untwist themselves. 
8. 
Take your crimper and insert the new end of the cable into it with the 
R J-45 connector. Once you are ready, firmly place even pressure on the 
crimper so that the connector is seated and will not open up. Usually, 
once you crimp a connector, it cannot be uncrimped so if you make a 
mistake, you will be cutting the end off and starting again.

, 
Now that you have finished the crimping job, you should have a per- 
fectly good crossover cable that you can use that can be used for any 
connection that requires it. Make sure you test the cable, otherwise, you 
may experience other problems and not know where to look or trou- 
bleshoot.

Hardware Loopback Adapter 
A hardware loopback adapter is a way to test the ports on a system without having to con- 
nect to an external device. For example, you can use a serial loopback adapter to verify 
that a transmitted signal is leaving your serial port and returning through the loopback 
adapter, ensuring that your serial port is working correctly. 
Cable Tester 
Cable testers provide a variety of tests that can be performed on network cabling. The 
features of a handheld cable tester will vary, so you should refer to the documentation 
that comes with the tester to familiarize yourself with what it can do and how the tests 
are performed. Some high-end testers will also combine the features of several testers, 
such as providing the features of a wire map tester and a TDI<. A number of cable testers 
also have an auto-test feature, which provides the ability to automatically perform a 
series of tests on the cable, allowing you to review the results of each individual test. 
In using a cable tester, you would check the segments of cable that are suspected to 
have a problem. For example, if you were performing a test on a network that uses 
10Base2, you might separate the cable at a midway point.You could then check each 
half of the cable to determine which half has the problem. Once this is done, you could 
then perform the same test by checking the cable at the halfway point of that section, 
and repeat this until you have determined which where the defect in the cable was 
located.

Simplex, Half-Duplex, and Full Duplex 
When data travels across the medium, it travels in a certain direction. To describe the 
movement of data across communication channels, certain terms are used, including: 
• 
Simplex, which refers to data moving in a single direction. 
• 
Half-duplex, which means data travels both ways on the medium, but in only 
one direction at a time. 
• 
Full duplex, which means data travels in both directions simultaneously. 
While these terms are often associated with network devices, as we proceed in this 
chapter, we will discuss how certain methods of network communication support sim- 
plex, half-duplex or full duplex. 
Cabling 
Cabling isn't just a term that refers to the cable being used. It is also a term that refers to 
the act of installing the cable and the work performed before installation begins. Because 
coaxial cable and twisted-pair cable are copper cables, and fiber optic cable uses glass or 
plastic fibers, different issues may arise for each type of cable. As we look at these types 
of cabling, we'll see that there are other significant differences in how they are created 
and installed. 
Copper Cabling 
Installation of cable requires a number of different tools. Because the major part of cable 
installation consists of running the cable where you want it and attaching the appro- 
priate connectors at each end, having the right tools is crucial. Some of the tools will be 
common to any installation, such as electric drills to drill holes in walls, while others are 
specific to the cable itself. Tools are used to cut and strip the cable and to attach the 
proper connector to the end of the cable.These include: 
• 
Cable cutter, which is used to cut the cable to the size you need. 
• 
Cable stripper, which is used to strip the cable jacket and expose the copper 
wire inside. 
• 
Crimp tool, which is used to attach the connectors to the cable. 
• 
Connectors that will be attached at the ends of the cable 
During the installation there are several points that need to be considered, including 
the pulling force used on the cable. The pulling force of cabling refers to the amount of 
force or tension that can be placed on the cable without damaging it. In other words, it 
is how hard you can pull on the cable when you're installing or working with it. For 
www.syngress.com 

86 
Chapter 2 • Network Media 
example, with Category 5 UTP cabling, if more than 25 pounds of force is applied to 
the cabling during installation, then it may be damaged and no longer meet the specifi- 
cations associated with it. It is important that you refer to the pull tension specifications 
of the cabling being used before installation begins. 
The minimum bend radius of a cable refers to how far the cable can be bent before 
it is damaged. If a cable is bent too far, the wire or other components in the cable can 
crack or break, or the electrical characteristics of the cable can be otherwise affected. 
Category 5 UTP cables allow a bend radius of 4 times the cable's diameter. For example, 
if the cable is 1/4 inch in diameter, you can bend it 1 inch. While the bend radius of 
cable can vary, depending on the materials making up the cable, it is generally four, six, 
or ten times the diameter of the cable. 
Fiber Cabling 
Fiber cabling also has bend radius and pull force ratings, and these will vary depending 
on the type of fiber cabling used and the number of fibers in the cable. The bend radius 
is usually specified with the cable, but will generally follow the rule of ten times the 
outside diameter of the cable. The pulling force of fiber optic cabling can also vary, with 
specifications ranging from 50 pounds to a few hundred pounds. If a string is used to 
pull the cable through areas during installation, at no time should you attach the pulling 
string to the fiber strands, as this will damage the fibers and make the cable unusable. 
During installation, special tools will be needed to strip the cable so that the appro- 
priate connector can be attached.These include: 
Cable stripper or ring tool, which is used to remove the plastic jacket of the 
cable without damaging the fibers. 
• 
Kevlar shears, which is used to cut the kevlar inside the fiber optic cable. 
• 
Connectors that will be attached at the ends of the cable. 
Preparing Copper Cable 
Preparing cable basically involves measuring out the amount of cable needed, exposing the 
wire inside of the cable, and attaching a connector. While this is obviously a compressed 
description of what has to be done, preparing copper cable is actually relatively easy. 
The first step in preparing a cable is determining how much is needed for a partic- 
ular run. Because you will probably be pulling the cable through false ceilings or areas 
that may be somewhat difficult to measure with a measuring tape, the easiest way of 
determining how much cable is needed is running the cable along the floor. By 
unrolling the cable along walkways where the cable will actually run through walls and 
ceilings, you will get a reasonable measurement of how much cable will go into a seg- 
ment. It is important, however, to account for a little extra slack that may be necessary 
for cornering or to simply make it easier to work with the cable. Once you've deter- 
mined how much cable is needed, use a cable cutter to cut the cable. 

Network Media • 
Chapter 2 
87 
After you've got the proper length of cable, you will then need to strip the cable to 
expose the wires. Using a cable stripper, you remove the outer jacket of the cable. With 
UTR you would remove about 3/4 of an inch from the cable, and then untwist the 
wires within the cable so you can work with them. Because four pairs of wires are used, 
this means that you will be working with eight wires that use a particular color code. 
The color code for UTP wiring is described in the next section. 
Once the wires are untwisted, you trim the leads of all eight wires to a length of 
approximately 1/2 inch. Because the wires are thin, you should be able to cut all of" them 
with a wire cutter simultaneously, ensuring they are all the same length. Having prepared 
the wires in this way, you are now ready to attach the cable to an 1KJ-45 connector. 
UTP contains several sets of wires that are attached to an 1KJ-45 connector in a spe- 
cific way. Once the leads are aligned, you insert them into the connector and push the 
wires forward until the copper wires can be seen through the transparent end of the 
connector. The connector and the cable are then inserted into a crimp tool, and with 
the wires pressed against the end of the connector, you squeeze the crimp tool's handle 
for a few seconds. Once this is done, the connector is now firmly attached to the cable, 
and is ready for installation. 
Twisted-Pair Color Codes 
If you look inside of a twisted-pair cable, you'll notice that the plastic sheaths covering the 
wires are colored differently. Twisted-pair cabling use color codes to specify the purpose of 
each wire and to make them easily identifiable. Because each wire belongs to a pair, the 
colors of each pair are the same, with one solid and the other striped. Table 2.3 shows the 
color scheme that corresponds to the Electronic Industry Association/Telecommunications 
Industry Association's Standard 568B used for a four pair UTP wire.

When connecting twisted-pair wire to an 1KJ-45 connector, the wires will have to 
be aligned so that they match up with the pins of the connector. Table 2.4 shows how 
the various wires of a four pair cable are installed.

Cable Installation 
When installing cable, you first need to choose the location of the hub, switch or router. 
These devices will be where the cable will attach to, and as we'll see in the next chapter, 
are used to move data from one cable to another so it reaches its intended destination. 
In larger organizations a patch panel or cabinet may be used to accommodate numerous 
cables, or a separate hub, switch, or router will be used for each floor of a building. 
Using one of these devices on each floor will save time and require less cable. 
Once the location of network devices has been decided, you should create docu- 
mentation on where the cables will be installed. A map of wiring should include how 
many cables will be installed in ceilings, walls, and other locations. While creating the 
map, you will also be able to review issues that will arise during the actual cabling, such 
as holes that may have to be drilled or vertical runs of cabling down elevator shafts. 
When determining how the cable should run from an outlet to a hub, switch, or router, 
you should remember to keep the cabling at least three feet away from fluorescent lights 
and other sources of EMI. 
Cables should be tested before they're actually installed. Even if new cable is being 
used for the installation, this doesn't guarantee that it isn't damaged in some way. It is 
easier to test the cable before installation than to determine where a section of bad 
cabling resides after installation is complete. 
Once you're ready to actually start running the cabling along the paths you've 
planned out, you should ensure that you actually have more cable than is needed. In 
running 100 feet of cable, you don't want to find there is only 90 feet of cable left in the 
box. Having extra cabling will also ensure that you have enough slack to navigate the 
cable without problems. 
Each end of a cable should be clearly marked, using masking tape or some other 
form of labeling. Because you may be installation several runs of cable at a time, you 
don't want to be confused as to which cable runs to a particular computer or location. 
www.syngress.com 

Network Media • Chapter 2 
89 
By labeling the cables, this confusion is removed, and you'll be able to focus on the 
installation. 
If you need to bundle cable, you should only use cable ties. Cable ties are sturdy 
plastic strips that attach cables together into a ring. When using them however, you 
should allow enough space to fit a finger into the cable tie. Having a cable tie too tight 
can damage the cables and make it more difficult to cut when a cable has to be 
replaced. Using cable ties is the safest method of keeping cables together, as staples or 
other methods can damage cable. 
LAN Technologies and Standards 
In discussing the physical media that may be used on your network, it's important to 
understand the technologies that are used on them. While we'll discuss individual com- 
ponents of the network and technologies related to them throughout this book, we'll 
pause here to look at several technologies related to physical media. As networking tech- 
nologies have developed over the years, it became apparent that standards were necessary 
so components o£ a network could work together effectively, and how data is transferred 
over the network cable. These standards include Ethernet, Fast Ethernet, and Gigabit 
Ethernet. 
Ethernet 
Ethernet is the standard for most of the networks today. As we discussed in the previous 
chapter, Bob Metcal£e originally developed Ethernet as a technology that networked 
together remote computers. Digital, Intel, and Xerox took the original specifications and 
extended it to accommodate speeds of 10 Mbps using coaxial cable or specific cate- 
gories of twisted-pair cabling. In 1990, Ethernet was standardized by the 802.3 com- 
mittee, and specifications under this correspond to 10Base2, 10Base5, and 10BaseT (each 
of which we'll discuss later in this chapter). 
A major component of Ethernet is the use of Carrier Sense Multiple Access with 
Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) for access to the physical medium. CSMA/CD keeps 
devices on the network from interfering with one another when trying to transmit; 
when they do interfere with each other, a collision has occurred. To reduce collisions, 
CSMA/CD devices listen to the network before transmitting. If the network is quiet (no 
other devices are transmitting), the device can send its data. Since two devices can both 
think the network is clear and start transmitting at the same time, resulting in a collision, 
all devices listen as they transmit. If a device detects another device transmitting at the 
same time, both devices stop transmitting and send a signal to alert other nodes to the 
collision. Then all the nodes stop transmitting and wait a random amount of time before 
they begin the process again. 
CSMA/CD doesn't stop collisions from happening, but it helps manage the situations 
when collisions occur. In fact, collisions are a very normal part of Ethernet operation. It's 
only when collisions begin to occur frequently that you need to become concerned.

Chapter 2 • Network Media 
Ethernet has evolved over the years to include a number of popular specifications. 
These specifications are due in part to the media variety they employ, such as coaxial, 
twisted-pair, and fiber-optic cabling. 
Fast Ethernet 
Fast Ethernet is a standard that provides transmission of data at speeds of 100 Mbps. It 
uses full duplex transmission, which enables data to pass in both directions at the same 
time. Because of the speeds available through this standard, Fast Ethernet is generally 
used as a backbone on local area networks to support workstations that have 10BaseT 
network cards. The Fast Ethernet standard corresponds to the 100BaseT specifications, 
which we'H discuss later in this chapter. 
Gigabit Ethernet 
An even faster standard in the evolution of" Ethernet is Gigabit Ethernet, which provides 
speeds of 1 Gbps. To compare this to the 10 Mbps of Ethernet, which provides full 
duplex transmission speeds of" 10 million bits per second, Gigabit Ethernet supports 
speeds of one billion bits per second. Because of the bandwidth available through this 
standard, it is often used as a backbone for many larger networks. 
While Ethernet runs on either coaxial or twisted-pair, and Fast Ethernet runs on 
twisted-pair cable, Gigabit Ethernet uses both copper and fiber optic cabling to transmit data 
(www.pccables.com/02303.htm). The optical fiber in the cable allows data to transmit faster 
and over greater distances, making it useful for connecting different locations at high speeds.

802.3 Media Standards 
As we discussed in the previous chapter, the Institute of Electrical and Electronic 
Engineers (IEEE) is an organization that sets standards on a variety of technologies. 
Various committees are used to develop and promote these standards, including the 802 
committee, which is broken down into smaller sub-committees or working groups that 
focus on specific aspects of networking. One of these sub-committees is the 802.3 
working group, which has set standards for physical media used on networks. 
1 0Base2, 1 0Base5, and Arcnet 
10Base2 (also known as Thinner) is a thin coaxial cable used on Ethernet networks. The 
cable used in 10Base2 is an RG-58 cable that is 6.3 mm or 1/4 inch in diameter, and 
supports transmission speeds of 10 Mbps. Used on bus topologies, the network cards are 
attached to the cable using a BNC T-connector, and the backbone cable is terminated at 
each end using a 50 Ohm terminator. The 10Base2 cable has a maximum length of 185 
meters or 600 feet per segment, and workstations must be spaced a minimum distance of 
1/2 meters from one another. 
10Base5 (Thicknet) is a thicker type of coaxial cable that is 13"mm or 1/2 inch in 
diameter, and supports transmission speeds of 10 Mbps. The cable has a maximum length 
of 500 meters or 1640 feet per segment. Like 10Base2, 10Base5 is used on bus topolo- 
gies, and must be terminated on each end using a 50 Ohm terminator. However, unlike 
10Base2, 10Base5 generally isn't directly connected to workstations on the network. 
Instead, a vampire tap is used to pierce the cable so that a connection can be made to 
the cable. An N connector or a cabling tray and transceiver called a MAU (Media 
Attachment Unit) are connected to the cable.Another cable called an AUI (Attachment 
Unit Interface) that can be up to 50 meters in length is then run to the network card of 
the workstation. Each end of the AUI cable uses a 15 pin D-connector, which is also 
referred to as a DIX (Digital-Intel-Xerox) or DB-15 connector. While we'll discuss 
transceivers and connectors in greater detail later in this chapter, it's important to 
remember that a 10Base5 cable can have no more than 100 taps per cable segment, with 
each tap spaced 2 1/2 meters apart. 
Determining how long a 10Base5 cable could be lengthened using different seg- 
ments can be calculated using the 5-4-3 rule. A 10Base5 cable can have up to five seg- 
www.syngress.com 

92 
Chapter 2 • Network Media 
ments, with four repeaters, with only three of the segments having devices attached to it. 
By using the maximum cable length with repeaters between each of the five segments, 
this would lengthen the cable to a maximum of 2,460 meters. However, because only 
three of the segments can have a maximum of 100 devices attached, this means that even 
by lengthening the cable in this manner you are limited to a maximum of 300 devices 
on the bus topology. 
The problem with 10Base2 and 10Base5's cabling architechure cable is that a single 
fault in the cable can bring the entire network down. As we discussed in the previous 
chapter, each end of the cable must be terminated in a bus topology or the data will 
continue to bounce back and forth along the cable. This prevents any other workstations 
from being able to transmit data onto the network without causing collisions. 
Arcnet is another technology addressed in the 802.3 standards that uses coaxial 
cable. Arcnet is a token bus technology, just as Ethernet, Token Ring, and FDDI are 
technologies used on a network. As with Token Ring, when a workstation on an Arcnet 
network receives a token, it has the opportunity to communicate on the network. If it 
doesn't have any data to send, then the next workstation on the bus then gets the token. 
If it does send data, then the receiving machine resets the token and others can then 
transmit data when they get the token. 
With the various applications of coaxial (10Base2, 10Base5, and Arcnet), there are 
different coaxial cables that may be used. These include: 
• 
RG-58/U, which has a solid copper wire, and is used for 10Base2 networks. 
• 
RG-58 A/U, which has a stranded copper wire, and can also be used for 
10Base2 networks. 
• 
RG-58 C/U, which is a military implementation of lKG-58 A/U. 
• 
RG-59, which is used for broadband transmissions (such as cable television), 
and is used for 10Base5 networks. 
• 
RG-6, which is used for broadband, but supports higher transmission rates 
than RG-59. 
• 
RG-62, which is used for Arcnet. 
• 
RG-8, which is 10Base5 cable.

10BaseT and Beyond 
In addition to the standards that use coaxial cable, there are also those that use twisted- 
pair and fiber optic cabling. These are more commonly used on today's networks, and 
knowledge of them is essential when designing or maintaining a network in the real 
world. The various types of media available are shown in Table 2.5.

For the exam, you will have to memorize the characteristics of the various types

" 
10BASET 
10BaseT is one of the most common media standards found on networks. It is deployed 
on networks that use a star topology, which we discussed in the previous chapter. It uses 
UTP cabling to transmit data at speeds of 10 Mbps across cable segments that are up to 
100 meters in length. Although it will work on Category 3 UTP, a higher grade of cable 
is recommended. 
10BaseFL 
10BaseFL is an older, but widely used fiber optic standard, and is sometimes referred to 
generically as 10BaseE It uses fiber optic cabling to transmit data at speeds of 10 Mbps 
across cable segments that are up to 2 km in length. 
  
lOOBaseTX 
= 
100BaseTX uses UTP cabling to transmit data at speeds of 100 Mbps across cable seg- 
ments that are up to 100 meters in length. The UTP must be Category 5 or higher. 
Another common term that relates to 100BaseT is Fast Ethernet. 100BaseTX cables use 
two sets of two pairs, or 4 wires. 

Network Media • Chapter 2 
95 
100BaseFX 
100BaseFX is another Ethernet standard that uses fiber optic cabling to transmit data at 
speeds of 100 Mbps. The distance that this standard can achieve depends upon whether 
half-duplex is used to achieve collision detection. If communication is half-duplex, it can 
transmit data across cable segments that are up to 400 meters in length. If full duplex is 
used, then it can transmit data up to 2 kilometers. 
1000BaseT 
1000BaseT is a Gigabit Ethernet standard that allows data to be transmitted over 
twisted-pair cabling at 1 Gbps. This means that 1000 megabits or 1 billion bits of data 
can be transmitted each second. 1000BaseT uses UTP cabling to transmit data at these 
speeds across cable segments that are up to 100 meters in length. For this to be used 
however, the UTP must be Category 5 or higher. 
  
1000BaseCX 
1000BaseCX uses fiber optic cabling to transmit data at speeds of 1 Gbps across cable 
segments that are up to 100 meters in length. Because it is an older standard, it isn't 
commonly used on newer networks. 
  
1000BaseSX 
100BaseSX uses multimode fiber optic cabling to transmit data at speeds of 1 Gbps 
across cable segments that are up to 550 meters in length. 
  
1000BaseLX 
1000BaseLX uses fiber optic cabling to transmit data at speeds of 1 Gbps. Using multi- 
mode fiber, data can be sent across cable segments that are up to 550 meters in length, 
while single mode fiber will allow longer distances of up to 10 km. 
Connectors 
While we've discussed a significant number of issues related to the physical media used 
on a network, it's important to remember that a cable is more than the wire or fiber that 
transmits the data. Cables have to be connected to the network interface card or other 
devices on a network. A connector is an interface that provides such a connection 
between a cable and a device. Because the media used on a network can differ, a 
number of different connectors have been developed over the years. 
Twisted-Pair and Coaxial Cable Connectors 
Several types of connectors are available for coaxial cable. Depending on the need, 
connectors that connect to different cable and devices are available for twisted-pair and 
coaxial. These include:

D Connectors 
The D connector gets its name from its shape. As shown in Figure 2.3, with some imag- 
ination, the D connector can be seen as looking like a letter D turned on its side. A 
male connector is one that has pins protruding from it, while a female connector has 
holes into which the pins fit. The number of pins used in a D connector varies, but 
always correspond to the number used in the D connector's name. These include: 
• 
DB9, which has 9 pins. 
• 
DB15, which has 15 pins, and which we'll discuss further in this chapter when 
we examine D IX connectors. 
• 
DB25, which has 25 pins. 
Figure 2.3 DB15 Connector 
RJ Connectors 
RJ connectors are used with twisted-pair cabling, and can be used to provide connec- 
tivity to a cable used by telephone and data devices. Because they are used for different 
purposes, there are several different variations of RJ connectors available. 
RJ-11 
RJ-11 connectors are used on twisted-pair cables that are used by telephones.You can 
easily find an RJ-11 connector in your home by looking at the ends of the cable run- 
ning from your phone into the wall jack. They are also used to plug dial-up modems 
into the phone line so that computers can dial into the Internet or access networks 
remotely using the phone line. They are primarily used in North America, and are not 
widely used in other countries throughout the world.

RJ-11 connectors have four pins to support four of the wires in a twisted-pair cable. 
While the connector can be used with different categories of twisted-pair, only two 
pairs of wires are used, even if the cable contains more than four wires. 
Rj-45 
The RJ-45 connector is used with twisted-pair cables that support data communication. 
As such, they can be used with Categories 3 and higher of UTP or STP cabling. They 
are commonly seen on today's networks, as they are used on both Ethernet and Token 
Ring networks. 
As shown in Figure 2.4, an RJ-45 connector looks like a RJ-11 connector, but 
wider. RJ-45 connectors are similar to the phone connectors except that instead of four 
wires found in the home system, the network RJ-45 contains eight contacts. There are 
eight pins in the connector, hence eight wires in the cable are connected to it. Ethernet 
can use four of the wires or possibly all eight, depending on the media standard being 
used. As we saw earlier in this chapter, a special crimping tool is needed to make contact 
between the pins and the cable inside.

RJ-48 and RJ-25 
In addition to the RJ-11 and RJ-45 connectors that are used for voice and data com- 
munication, there are also a number of other Registered Jack connectors that may be 
found in offices. The different types are used to provide different services, but are all 
used with twisted-pair cabling. 
RJ-48 connectors are essentially the same as the RJ-45 connector, but used with 
STP cable. Like the RJ-45 connector, it uses eight pins to provide contact with the eight 
wires in a twisted-pair cable, although a different pin arrangement is used in connecting 
the wires. 
Another example of a registered jack is the RJ-25 connector. RJ-25 connectors use 
six conductors to allow multiple phone lines to be used. They are often seen when tele- 
phones have three line connections.

Chapter 2 • Network Media 
DIX 
Earlier in this chapter we discussed D connectors and how they consist of pins that are 
inserted into a female connector. One type olD connector is a DIX, which is used with 
an AUI that's used with 10Base5 cable.A DIX connector looks similar to the connector 
used for attaching a joystick to a joystick port. DIX connectors can be found on the 
back of some network cards, and allow the card to be used with different types of 
media. 
BNC 
The meaning of the acronym BNC is something that is a topic of argument. It is com- 
monly referred to as a British Naval Connector, but is also referenced as meaning 
Bayonet Neill Concelman or Bayonet Nut Connector. Regardless of your preference, 
the BNC connector is used with coaxial cable. 
If you've ever looked at the end of the cable used for your cable television, you've 
seen one that looks similar to what's illustrated in Figure 2.5. The copper wire running 
down the center of the cable protrudes from the center of a BNC barrel connector. The 
connector is threaded, allowing it to be screwed onto devices with a corresponding con- 
nector, so that the wire can fit into the female connection. 
Figure 2.5 BNC Barrel Connector 
There are different variations of the BNC connector that can be used on a network. 
BNC connectors are used to connect 10Base2 coaxial cable to a hub, while a T-con- 
nector (shown in Figure 2.6) can connect a workstation's cable segment to the network 
backbone. A special crimping tool is used to put the connector on the end of the wire. 
The actual wire runs down the middle and must make contact with the end of the con- 
nector shown in the middle.

TERMINATING A COAXIAL CABLE 
Now that you have learned about coaxial cable and how identify it, we will 
learn how to terminate a coaxial connector on to a RG type cable. 
1. As with twisted-pair cable termination, you will need to use crimping 
and stripping tools when terminating a coaxial cable, although the pro- 
cess itself is a little different. For one, you will need a stronger cutter 
that is sized properly for the job of cutting think coaxial cable. 
2. To terminate the cable, you will need a ratchet crimper, a pair of coaxial 
cable strippers, the coaxial cable itself, and BNC connectors. 
3. 
Use the cable cutter to cut a length of coaxial cable from a bulk spool if 
you have one available. The cable should be the proper length for the 
job, plus some extra slack for you to make some mistakes when cutting 
your cable. Remember, never cut cable (especially preexisting runs) 
without giving yourself a little extra cable to play with. 
4. 
Next, use the cable stripper to remove the excess jacketing and outside 
coating of the cable. 
5. Apply the RG-type connector on the cable and crimp it down. 
6. 
Do both sides of the cable if not already done. 
7. 
Make sure you test the cable and that it is within specifications.

~ RG and F-Type Connectors 
F-type connectors are used to terminate coaxial cable, and are commonly seen on RG- 
58 (Thinnet) and RG-59 (Thicknet) coaxial.Although it is an older type of connector, 
it is still frequently used. These connectors have the ability to screw onto televisions, 
VCRs, and devices for cable television, and are low in cost. 
Fiber Connectors 
There are a number of different connectors that are used with fiber optic cable.As is the 
case with some of the connectors available for twisted-pair and coaxial cable, some of 
these are used with older technology and are not routinely seen on modern networks. 
They include: 
• 
Straight Tip

Standard Connector

Standard Connectors 
SC stands for standard connector, and is a suitable name, as it's the most common type of 
connector used with fiber optic cable. It is often used with Cisco equipment. As shown 
in Figure 2.7, the SC connector terminates the fiber optic cable by attaching to its end, 
using a locking mechanism that clicks into place.

Straight Tip Connectors 
~ 
Straight tip (ST) connectors are an older version of connector used on fiber optic cable. 
It is often seen on older 10BaseFL networks. The ST connector has a screw-on type of 
locking mechanism that attaches to the tip of a fiber optic cable and terminates it. In 
using this type of connector (shown in Figure 2.8), you will find that it has the look and 
feel of aBNC connector, making it easy to use.

Local Connectors 
The Local connector (LC) is another common connector used on fiber optic networks. 
LC is a high-performance connector that is used on many networks. LC connectors use 
a locking mechanism that's similar to the SC connectors, which click into place. The 
connector is seated into place by pushing it in and snapping it into place.

Mechanical Transfer Registered Jacks 
The mechanical transfer registered jack is similar to the LC connector in that it is a 
duplex connector.As shown in Figure 2.9, it uses a form factor and latch that is similar 
to the p,J-45 connectors discussed earlier in this chapter. It is also easier to terminate 
and install than some of the other types of fiber optic connectors we've discussed, such 
as the ST and SC connectors.

Recognizin Category 3, 5, 5e, and 
6 UTP, STP, gcoaxial cable SME 
Optic Cable MMF, and Optic Cable 
While we've already provided you with a lot of information about cabling and their 
respective issues, it's time to go in depth into the types of cabling you'll find on net- 
works and the Network+ exam. As we've discussed, there are three types of physical 
media that can be used on a network: coaxial cable, twisted-pair cable, and fiber-optic 
cable. These different media types can be further broken down into different categories 
and types of cabling, which are either used for specific purposes or provide greater 
bandwidth. 
Category 3, 5, 5e, and 6 UTP 
UTP cabling is the most common type of physical media on networks today. The typical 
twisted-pair cable for network use contains three or four pairs of wires. As shown in 
Figure 2.10, each pair of wires contained in the cable is twisted around each other, 
which helps shield against crosstalk and other forms of electromagnetic interference. 
Although the twisted wires do provide a certain amount of immunity from the infiltra- 
tion of unwanted interference, this doesn't mean that UTP is the best solution against 
EMI. Twisted-pair cable is susceptible to interference and should not be used in environ- 
ments containing large electrical or electronic devices.

Because UTP is used for everything from telephone cable to high-speed network 
cable, the Electrical Industry Association established different categories of UTE These 
categories are rated by a number of factors, including the electrical characteristics, con- 
ductor size, and twists per foot. Because new categories are also an indication of enhance- 
ments in the wiring, the higher categories are also new evolutions of twisted-pair. The 
various categories, which are simply referred to as CAT, are shown in Table 2.6.

100 Mbps (4 pairs). Typically used for Ethernet networks running at 
10 or 100 Mbps. Used for data and voice transmission; rated at 100

1000 Mbps. Recommended for all new installations, and was 
designed for transmission speeds of up to 1 Gbps (Gigabit 
Ethernet). Similar to Category 5, but manufacturing process is 
refined; higher grade cable than Category 5; rated at 200 MHz; 
suitable for Ethernet, Fast Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet, Token Ring, 
and 155 Mbps ATM. 
Same as CAT5e, but higher standard. Rated at 250 MHz; suitable 
for Ethernet, Fast Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet, Token Ring, and 155 
Mbps ATM. 
Support for 10 Gigabit Ethernet. Similar to Category 6, but is a pro- 
posed international standard to be included in ISO/IEC 11801. 
Not official standard at time of this writing. Still in development. 
Rated at 600 MHz; suitable for Ethernet, Fast Ethernet, Gigabit 
Ethernet, Token Ring, and 155 Mbps ATM. 
Category 3 is the minimum grade of cable that supports networking, but it is not 
the best choice for networks. CAT3 is a voice-grade cable used in phone networks, and 
its only real benefit beyond being able to support data communication is that it already 
exists in most office buildings and homes. Regardless of this, CAT 5 or higher should be 
used in new networks. 
Most of the UTP cable that's found in networks today is Category 5. CAT 5 is a 
multi-pair performance cable with eight wires (four pairs) that supports higher band- 
width, and is typically used for Ethernet networks that run at 10 or 100 Mbps. Until 
recent enhancements were made to UTR this grade of cabling was the standard for new 
network installations. 
Category 5e is essentially the same as CAT 5 cable, but adheres to more stringent 
standards that make it a better candidate for new installations that will use Gigabit 
Ethernet. It is designed for transmission speeds of up to 1 Gbps, and has been made an 
official standard. 
Category 6 is another enhancement to the previous grades, and provides support for 
10 Gigabit Ethernet. It is officially a part of the 568A standard, making it a standard 
grade of cable for UTP installations.

STP 
As its name says, the difference between the unshielded and shielded varieties of twisted- 
pair is the shield. As shown in Figure 2.11, STP has a shield that's usually made of alu- 
minum/polyester that resides between the outer jacket and the wires. The shield is 
designed to keep more interference out, protecting the wires inside from EMI caused 
by outside sources. STP also uses a much higher quality protective jacket for greater 
insulation.

Coaxial cable 
Coaxial (or coax) cable looks like the cable used to bring the cable TV signal to our 
television.As shown in Figure 2.12, one strand (a solid-core wire) runs down the middle 
of the cable. Around that strand is insulation. Covering that insulation is braided wire 
and metal foil, which shields against electromagnetic interference. A final layer of insula- 
tion covers the braided wire. Coaxial cable is resistant to the interference and signal 
weakening that other cabling, such as UTP cable, can experience. In general, coax is 
better than UTP cable at connecting longer distances and for reliably supporting higher 
data rates with less sophisticated equipment.

Just because the TV cable is coax does not mean it will work with computer net- 
works. Network coaxial cable has very specific requirements, such as the gauge, the 
impedance, and the attenuation. 
Thinnet refers to 1KG-58 cabling, which is a flexible coaxial cable about 1/4-inch 
thick. Thinnet is used for short-distance communication and is flexible enough to facili- 
tate running and routing between workstations. Thinnet connects directly to a worksta- 
tion's network adapter card using a BNC T-connector and uses the network adapter 
card's internal transceiver. 10Base2 refers to Ethernet LANs that use Thinnet cabling. 
Thicknet coaxial cable can support data transfer over longer distances better than 
Thinnet can and is usually used as a backbone to connect several smaller Thinnet-based 
networks.The diameter of a Thicknet cable is about 1/2-inch and is harder to work 
with than a Thinnet cable. A transceiver is connected directly to Thicknet cable using a 
connector known as a piercing tap. Connection from the transceiver to the network 
adapter card is made using a drop cable to connect to the adapter unit interface port 
connector. 10Base5 refers to Ethernet LANs that use Thicknet cabling.

Single Mode Fiber Optic Cable 
Optical fibers carry digital data signals in the form of modulated pulses of light. As 
shown in Figure 2.13, an optical fiber consists of an extremely thin cylinder of glass or 
optical fiber, called the core, surrounded by a concentric layer of glass, known as the 
cladding. A cable may contain two fibers per cable~one to transmit and one to receive-- 
or a single fiber. However, often, multiple fibers are bundled into the center of the cable. 

Network Media • Chapter 2 
107 
The fiber and cladding can be surrounded by a liquid gel that reflects signals back into 
the fiber to reduce signal lost, or a plastic spacer surrounded by kevlar fiber. Each of 
these components making up the fiber optic cable are further protected by a plastic cov- 
ering that encases everything within the cable.

KEVLAR FIBER 
There are two different types of fiber optic cabling that may be used to carry data: 
Single Mode Fiber (SMF) and Multimode Fiber (MMF). SMF is optical fiber that's 
designed to transmit a single beam of light from a laser. The beam of modulated light 
provides greater bandwidth and allows cable to be run over longer distances. Because of 
these features, SMF is used for long distance transmissions such as in telephone and cable 
television networks. 
Multimode Fiber Optic Cable 
MMF is used to carry multiple beams of light at the same time, using a light emitting 
diode (LED) as a light source. Each of the beams is at a slightly different reflection angle 
within the core of the fiber. Because the light tends to disperse over distance, MMF is 
used for connecting locations within relatively short distances. 
Other Media 
While the cabling, connectors and other elements of a network we've discussed in this 
chapter are either traditional components of a network, or have grown to become stan- 
dard, there are other technologies that are either new, not readily associated with net- 
working, or often forgotten. Nevertheless, elements such as wireless technologies, FireWire, 
and transceivers are important to networking. Such media is not only covered on the 
Network+ exam, but is important to the design or development of your network.

Chapter 2 • Network Media 
IEEE 1394 (FireWire) 
If you've ever hooked up a digital camera, digital video (DV) camera, or other devices 
that need to transfer large amounts of data to your computer, you may have used 
FireWire. FireWire is a proprietary name for an external bus that supports fast data 
transfer rates. Apple Computers originally developed the technology, but it has since 
been standardized as IEEE1394. Since then, other companies have developed their own 
trademark names, including Sow's iLink. 
Devices that follow IEEE1394 allow data to be transferred at 400Mbps (in 
IEEE1394a) and 800Mbps (in IEEE1394b). In addition to this, it allows a single 1394 
port to have up to 63 external devices connected to it. It is similar to USB in that can 
provide power to a device, and supports both plug and play and hot plugging. 
Wireless Media 
As we discussed briefly in the previous chapter, and will discuss in greater detail in 
Chapter 4, wireless networks require minimal cabling. Data is transmitted over the air 
using wireless adapters and wireless routers, so little to no cabling is required for net- 
work communication. 
Transceivers (Media Converters) 
The term transceiver is short for transmitter-receiver, which also describes its purpose on 
a network. Transceivers are the portion of a network interface that transmits and receives 
electrical signals across the transmission media. They are also the part of the interface 
that actually connects to the media. Transceiver types can be classified as being either 
on-board, which are built onto a network card, or external. 
With an external transceiver, the actual media connection is made external to the 
network interface card using a small device that attaches via an extension cable to the 
network interface card. The types of transceivers and media that can be served by a net- 
work interface card determine the appropriate connector, and, as we saw earlier in this 
chapter, each media type has a typical connector type or connection method. One such 
connector is an AUI connector, which is also called a DIX connector. This type of con- 
nector can be found on the back of many network interface cards. The AUI connector 
enables a network card to be used with multiple types of media. A common implemen- 
tation is to use this configuration for an Ethernet card that can be attached to twisted- 
pair, thickwire or thinwire coax by just changing the external transceiver type. 
On networks that used 10Base2 and 10Base5 media, transceivers are used to connect 
to the cable and communicate with the network. 10Base5 networks use a device called a 
MAU, which taps into the thick cable and allows the workstation to connect to the net- 
work using an AUI cable. When a MAU and AUI cable are used on a 10Base5 network, 
the onboard transceiver of the network card isn't used. Instead, the transceiver in the 
MAU is used, which acquires power through the AUI cable from the network adapter

card on the workstation. On 10Base2 networks, no more than 30 transceivers can be 
connected to any segment, while on 10Base5 networks no more than 100 taps can be 
performed per segment. 
Because the network adapter's transceiver isn't used, the MAU detects collisions by 
sending out a signal called a heartbeat or SQE (Signal Quality Error) test signal. The 
MAU's heartbeat is sent to the workstation when a collision is detected, allowing it to 
deal with the collision accordingly, as we discussed in the previous chapter when dis- 
cussing bus topologies. When a frame of data is successfully transmitted, the MAU will 
also send a heartbeat to determine whether the bus is active. 
An exception to performing this test is when a repeater is used on the network, 
which resends data to other segments of the network. When a repeater receives the 
heartbeat signal, it will identify it as a collision, and send a jam signal. To prevent this, 
and thereby keep the network from becoming bogged down with these signals, the 
MAU's SQE test signal feature should be turned off if a repeater is used.

Summary of Exam Objectives 
Cabling and connectors are essential to any network, providing a medium that allows 
computers to communicate and send data across the network. Cabling can be twisted- 
pair, coaxial, or fiber optic. Coaxial consists of a single copper wire to carry data, 
twisted-pair uses pairs of copper wires twisted together, and fiber optic cabling sends 
data across the network in the form of modulated pulses of light. 
In using the various cables, there are a number of issues that may impact the perfor- 
mance of a network. Electromagnetic interference (EMI) can be caused by florescent 
lighting, machinery or other sources that put out a low voltage, low current, high fre- 
quency signal that can interfere electronic signals transmitted over cabling. Similar to this 
is radio frequency interference (P, FI), which is caused by electromagnetic radiation in 
the radio frequency range. Putting cables too close to one another can cause another 
form of interference called crosstalk, where the electromagnetic field of one wire inter- 
feres with the transmission of another. Finally, data can weaken over distances, causing a 
problem called attenuation. These issues must be dealt with during the installation of 
network cable, or dealt with once cabling has been installed. 
When problems present themselves, electronic devices called cable testers may be 
used to find the cause or location of a problem on the cable. Tools like tone generators, 
time domain reflectometers, wire map testers, and oscilloscopes can all provide informa- 
tion that is useful in fixing a problem. 
We also saw that data can travel along a cable in several ways, using a simplex, half- 
duplex or full duplex data transfer. When simplex is used, data moves in a single direc- 
tion. Half-duplex allows data to move in either direction, but in only one direction at a 
........... 
time. When full duplex is used however, data can move in either direction. 
We discussed that Ethernet is a standard that's used on most networks today. 
......... Ethernet has specifications for 10Base2, 10Base5, and 10BaseT networks, and uses 
Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD), which prevents 
devices from interfering with one another during transmission by detecting collisions of 
data. A newer variation of Ethernet is Fast Ethernet, which supports transfer speeds of 
up to 100 Mbps. 
There is a wide variety of media standards, some of which have been around since 
the early days of networking. 10Base2 and 10Base5 are networks that use coaxial cable 
to transfer data, while 10BaseT, 100BaseTX, and 1000BaseT use UTP cabling. Finally, 
we also discussed various standards used for fiber optic networks, including 10BaseFL, 
100BaseFX, 100BaseSX, 1000BaseLX, and 1000BaseCX. 
Connectors are used to terminate cables and provide a method of connecting the 
............. cable to the device. There are a number of connectors available, including D, RJ, D IX, 
and B NC for coaxial and twisted-pair networks. SC, ST, LC, and MTRJ connectors are 
' ~ ~:~:~:~:~:~:~:~ u s e d for fib e r o p tic cab 1i n g. 
Just as there are various connectors, there are also a variety of media types. Twisted- 
pair cable comes in a variety of grades, ranging from CAT1 to CAT7. UTP Category 3

or higher can be used for data communications, but Category 5 or higher is recom- 
mended. The other form of twisted-pair is STR which has a shield that helps to prevent 
interference. Coaxial cable also comes in more than one form. RG-58 cabling or 
Thinnet is thin coaxial cable (about 1/4 inch thick) used on 10Base2 networks, while 
RG-59 cabling or Thicknet is thick coaxial cable (about 1/2 inch thick) used on 
10Base5 networks. Fiber optic cabling can be Single Mode Fiber (SMF), which is 
designed to transmit a single beam of light from a laser, while Multimode Fiber is used 
to carry multiple beams of light at the same time. Such variations show a wide variety of 
media types to choose from when designing a network.

Media Issues 
[-d Electromagnetic interference (EMI) is a low voltage, low current, high 
frequency signal that can interfere with the electronic signals transmitted over 
cabling. EMI is also referred to as noise, as its signals come from outside 
sources and can corrupt data sent over cabling. 
[-¢1 Radio frequency interference (RFI) is caused by electromagnetic radiation in 
the radio frequency range. 
!"4I Crosstalk occurs when the signal of one wire bleeds onto another wire so that 
the electromagnetic field of one wire interferes with the transmission of 
another.

V------d Attenuation occurs when data transmitted over media weakens over distance. 
Cable Testers and Troubleshooting 
r-4I Tone generators are used to perform tests on phone and network lines by 
clipping to a wire, terminal panel, or standard modular jack and will aid in the 
identification of wires during the wire-tracing process. 
V------d Time Domain 1Zeflectometers (TDRs) use signals that are sent down the cable 
to identify problems. An electronic pulse travels down the cable until it is 
reflected back, much like sonar. 
V','4I Wire map testers are often used on twisted-pair cabled networks to test for 
opens, shorts, or crossed pairs, and will provide information that may indicate 
improper wiring. 
[-4I Oscilloscopes can be used to determine when there are shorts, crimps, or 
attenuation in the cable. 
Simplex, Half-Duplex, Full Duplex 
V,-¢I Simplex refers to data moving in a single direction. 
V¢I Half-duplex refers to data traveling both ways on the medium, but in only one 
direction at a time. 
V4I Full duplex refers to data traveling in both directions simultaneously.

Chapter 3 • Network Devices 
Introduction 
A network is composed of many different devices, some of which perform a single func- 
tion, and some of which perform a variety of functions, from routing data to applying 
security filters. As networking devices become more complex, they also become more 
versatile, in that they may be able to perform multiple roles that previously could only 
be carried out }~y individual devices. Some network devices are complex enough to 
warrant their own operating systems for intensive and detailed configuration. In some 
cases, these operating systems can be switched out, substituted, or used to configure the 
device to perform roles traditionally carried out by other devices. For example, a Layer 3 
switch might be configured to combine both switching and routing functions. This 
coming together of technology within one device is called cont, ergence. 
In this chapter we will briefly discuss convergence, and we will look at the most 
common network devices in use today on small and large networks, including the 
Internet. These devices range from the very simple (such as an active hub, which simply 
repeats and sends out signals to all ports), to the more complex (such as a firewall that is 
responsible for controlling traffic and applying security features).

Network devices are components of a network that are required if the network is to 
grow, function, or provide certain functionality. There are a number of devices that fall 
into this category, including routers, switches, and other devices that we've mentioned 
briefly in previous chapters. These network devices provide functionality such as con- 
nectivity to physical media, security features, and the ability to connect to resources out- 
side of the local area network (LAN). Before we discuss the current state of networking 
and the available devices, let's take a look at where the current devices evolved from. 
Historical Network Devices 
As we saw in Chapter 1, networks have been around for decades, so it follows that some 
devices have been around longer than others. As we'll see in the sections that follow, 
while some devices are as useful today as when they were initially introduced, others 
have become obsolete and are rarely if ever used on today's networks. In discussing these 
devices, we'll tell you about their purpose, features, and functions on a network.

Hubs 
Even though hubs have been around since the early days of networking, they continue 
to be one of the most commonly used connection-based network components. 
Especially now that home networks are growing as more SOHOs (small offices home 
offices) are emerging, hubs are becoming a common household item. Some homes are 
even built today with a plan for a centralized wiring system, Internet access, routers, and 
hubs all included. 
Hubs are predecessors of the switch, which we'll discuss later in this chapter, and are 
central locations for connecting network cabling. Multiple cables connect into the hub, 
providing a method for data to be passed from one cable to another. This is also why 
switches are sometimes referred to as switching hubs, although that terminology is not 
commonly used today. 

126 
Chapter 3 • Network Devices 
As we discussed in Chapter 1, a star topology uses a hub to connect workstations, 
servers, and other devices. As shown in Figure 3.1, you can easily remember the layout 
of a hub if you think of a wheel and picture how the spokes go to the hub of the 
wheel. Each spoke is a connection and the hub of the wheel is the hub of the network 
where all the cables come together. Because all of the connections concentrate in the 
center, another term for a hub is a concentrator. 
Figure 3.1 Hubs are Used in Star Topologies 
Each of the cables that extends to the hub from computers and other network 
devices is plugged into its own port on the hub. The port provides an interface between 
the cable and the hub. For example, because star topologies use unshielded twisted-pair 
(UTP) cable, UTP is a common cable type that is used with hubs. The RJ-45 connector 
(which we discussed in Chapter 2) of the cable plugged into a port on the hub. When 
data is sent from a computer, it is carried along the cable to the port that the RJ-45 
connector is plugged into. The hub then takes this data and passes it to the other ports, 
allowing the data to travel along the other cables to workstations and devices that are 
attached to it. The number of ports on a hub will vary, but generally four or more are 
provided. Many hubs provide 24 or 28 ports, and can be attached together (or more 
commonly referred to as uplinked to each other) to provide connectivity to even more 
computers or network devices. There are rules, of course; when working with hubs you 
should always apply the 5-4-3 rule, which states that you can only connect a total of 5 
segments linked together via 4 hubs and only 3 of those segments can be populated 
with network hosts such as PCs or printers. Breaking rules of this kind could lead to a 
degradation of performance and possible problems.

The two main types of hubs are passive and active. A switching hub is actually a type 
of switch that behaves like a hub. 
?~~ 1'~ ;~M WARNING 
~ Hubs broadcast traffic on 
single port. Because hubs only operate at the 
every 
1 ~ Physical Layer, they are deemed unintelligent. A hub is simple by design; a 
signal comes in from a connected PC and the hub just sends that signal out 
every port that it knows. For example, suppose an 8-port hub has 8 PCs 
attached. If PC 1 sends an e-mail to PC 2, that transmission will go to all 8 PCs. 
The data of course will get to its destination, but all six of the uninvolved PCs 
are interrupted because each has to examine the data to determine if it is the 
recipient. This process takes time, and if you multiply this over the traffic of a 
normal large-scale enterprise network, it's easy to see why hubs are typically 
limited to small networks. 
Passive Hubs 
In discussing hubs to this point, we have essentially been talking about passive hubs. A 
passive hub provides basic features of moving data from one port to another. Its function 
is simply to receive data from one port of the hub and send it out to the other ports. 
For example, an 8-port hub receives data from port 3 and then resends that data to ports 
1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. It is as simple as that. 
A passive hub contains no power source or electrical components. There is no signal 
processing. It simply attaches the ports internally and enables communication to flow 
through the network. 
Active Hubs 
An active hub provides the same functionality that a passive hub does, with an additional 
feature. Active hubs repeat (regenerate) the data while resending it to all of its ports. By 
using active hubs you can increase the length of your network beyond regular cable 
length limits. For example, UTP Category 5 cabling can be run a maximum of 100 
meters. With an active hub, you can run Category 5 UTP 100 meters on each side of 
the hub, so that your cable now runs a length of 200 meters in total. 
An active hub has a power source and built-in repeaters to boost the signal. There 
are extra electronics built into an active hub that allow for signal regeneration, which is 
how the incoming data on one port is repeated to the other ports. Because the signal is 
repeated in this way to the other ports, another term for an active hub is a multiport 
repeater.

Chapter 3 • Network Devices 
DAY TIP 
The Network+ exam includes questions that deal with active hubs. Passive hubs 
aren't covered on the current version of the exam. This information is included 
for completeness. 
Switching Hubs 
While active and passive hubs will pass data to every other port on the hub, a switching 
hub will only send data to its intended port. Switching hubs are also referred to as intelli- 
gent hubs, as they can determine which port will get the data to its proper destination. 
The fact is, however, that even though it is referred to as a switching hub, these are the 
features of another device called a switch (which we'll discuss later in this chapter). 
While this term may be used in the real world to refer to a switch, for the Network+ 
exam it's best to keep the components separate in your mind. A switch is a switch, and a 
hub is a hub. 
i!jl}iii{{i{{i}iilii!iBi{i}~iiii{ii 
:: 
WARNING 
Hubs operate at the Physical Layer of the OSI model (also known as Layer 1). 
Hubs are designed to simply forward data from one port of the hub to another, 
so they don't use upper-layer protocols like IP (Internet Protocol), IPX 
{iii~i!i~ (Internetwork Packet Exchange), or MAC (media access control) addressing to 
ensure data reaches its intended destination. 
Repeaters 
A repeater is a device that is rarely seen on networks today, as its features are typically 
incorporated into other devices, such as active and switching hubs. The repeater will take 
a signal that may be weakening and regenerate it to its original strength. In doing so, it 
actually recreates the signal, making it the same strength that it was when it left the 
sending workstation. 
To help you understand a repeater, imagine that you are with a friend and both of 
you are standing at opposite ends of a street. If you shouted something to your friend, 
the sound would fade over a distance. If someone stood between the two of you, how- 
ever, and repeated your message, then it would be repeated strong and loud, allowing 
your friend to hear it.A repeater works in a similar fashion by repeating the data so it's 
in its original, strong form so the data doesn't corrupt as it weakens over distance.

Historically, repeaters were first created to fix a problem. Cables had length limita- 
tions, which were solved by connecting a repeater to two cable segments to extend the 
range beyond the regular distance limit. Repeaters were commonly used on Ethernet 
networks, such as those using UTP or coaxial cable, and provided networks with the 
ability to extend cable segments. 10BaseT limitations are 100 meters, or approximately 
328 feet. Thickwire (or also known as 10Base5 or Thicknet) can normally transmit a dis- 
tance of 500 meters, while thinwire (also known as 10Base2 or Thinnet) can normally 
transmit a distance of 185 meters. By putting a repeater between these segments, the dis- 
tance that data can travel can be doubled. Remember, when using repeaters, greater 
lengths of cabling were allowed when planning a cabling scheme. 
® 
)TE 
Unlike previous versions of the Network+ exam, repeaters are no longer directly 
tested on the exam. The function of a repeater is to regenerate data so that it 
can be passed further than the maximum distance of a cable segment. The 
ability to regenerate data and perform this function is now found incorporated 
in other network devices, such as hubs and switches. 
Bridges 
A bridge is a network connectivity device that connects two different networks and 
makes them appear to be one network. It can connect two different LANs, or allow a 
larger LAN to be segmented into two smaller halves. The bridge filters local traffic 
between the two networks and copies all other traffic to the other side of the bridge. 
Bridges are intelligent devices, and have the ability to forward packets of data based 
on MAC addresses. A bridge can look at a packet of data and determine the source and 
destination involved in the transfer of packets. It will read the specific physical address of 
a packet on one network segment and then decide to filter out the packet or forward it 
to another segment. 
A bridge is another device that has largely become a thing of the past. Although 
bridges were a common component of older networks, its features are now typically 
incorporated into switches. One benefit of a switch over a bridge is that a bridge typi- 
cally only has two ports, one for each segment that it is connecting. Switches may have 
many ports, and as we've already seen, incorporates features that were previously found 
in other devices, such as hubs.

Network Segmentation 
A bridge is a simple way to accomplish network segmentation. Placing a bridge between 
two different segments of the network decreases the amount of traffic on each of the 
local networks. Although this does accomplish network segmentation, most network 
administrators opt to use touters or switches, which are discussed later in the chapter. 
Bridges segment the network by MAC addresses. When one of the workstations 
connected to one network has to transmit a packet, the packet is copied across the 
bridge as long as the packet's destination is not on its originating network segment.A 
bridge uses a bridging table to calculate which MAC addresses are on which network. 
The MAC address uniquely identifies computers and other devices on a network, just as 
the full address of your house uniquely identifies its location. 
WARNING 
Bridges operate at the Data Link Layer of the OSI model and use physical 
addressing to join several networks into a single network efficiently.

Multistation Access Units 
Multistation access units (also known as MAUs or MSAUs) are used to connect work- 
stations on a Token Ring network. Sometimes a MAU is referred to as a hub on the 
Network+ exam, but it shouldn't be confused with the active and passive hubs we dis- 
cussed earlier, which are used on Ethernet networks. The features of a MAU are dif- 
ferent than those of a standard hub. 
A MAU typically has 8 or more ports that provide connections for workstations and 
other network devices on a Token Ring network. It is also generally non-powered, 
although some have been produced that are powered with lights to indicate connectivity 
and activity. A MAU is not something you will commonly find on newer networks 
simply because newer networks generally are installed as Ethernet, more typically Fast 
Ethernet or Gigabit Ethernet. MALTs are used with Token Ring networks, which are still 
present in today's environments, but are not as prevalent as Ethernet.

Concepts of Convergence 
Over the years, a number of network devices have become obsolete or less necessary to 
a network because other devices have taken on their roles. Vendors will attempt to put 
as many features as possible into a device, and will even include functions that other 
devices provide. As we discussed earlier in this chapter, repeaters are no longer used on 
networks because switches provide the same functionality. The same will apply to other 
devices used on a home or office network. For example, a router used for Internet 
access may include a switch for networking devices together, a firewall, and perhaps even 
a wireless access point (WAP).As time goes on, you can expect to see other devices 
converging together, requiring networks to have fewer components. 
When taking the Network+ exam, it is wise to consider such devices as separate, 
rather than as one device providing all features. For example, even though your router 
for the Internet has a firewall, you should consider a router and a firewall as two separate 
components of a network when taking the exam. 
The Modem and Other Adapters 
Over the past decade, having access to the Internet and remote access to networks has 
become as commonplace a method of communication as using a telephone. People have 
come to expect to be able to get the information they need quickly, and to be able to 
send messages and acquire data using a modem or other adapters. In the sections that 
follow, we'll look at a number of devices used for such access, and discuss related topics 
that may appear on the Network+ exam. 
The modem gets its name from a combination of the terms modulator and demodu- 
lator. In addition to analog modems, which typically provide connection speeds of up to 
56 Kbps, there are other types of modems that provide higher speed connections. These 
include DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) modems, cable modems, and ISDN (Integrated 
Services Digital Network) adapters. In the sections that follow, we'll discuss each of these 
types of modems in greater detail. 
Although there are many different types and makes of modems, they can be catego- 
rized into three areas: single external, single internal, and multi-line rack or shelf-mounted. 
The external modem is commonly used to provide connectivity between com- 
puters, existing as a separate component that is attached to a computer using a cable. 
Many ISPs (Internet Service Providers) use pools of external modems to enable dial-in 
access. They are also common in server hardware, as many IT personnel include modems 
in production systems to allow for a backup communications link or for remote access. 
www.syngress.com 

Network Devices • Chapter 3 
133 
The internal modem performs the same functions as the external modem. The only 
real difference is that it is located inside the computer chassis. While they are common 
in home computers, many companies don't use internal modems because external 
modems are easier to replace and troubleshoot. For example, internal modems do not 
have the LEDs that external modems do. This translates into a headache if you have to 
figure out why the modem won't connect to a remote host via the dial-up connection. 
Some modem manufacturers provide software interfaces; however, these generally are 
not as full-featured as for the external modem. 
While internal modems are often adapter cards that are installed in desktop com- 
puters, another type of internal modem is used in laptop computers. Many laptop ven- 
dors integrate phone jacks into the chassis of the computer, allowing a connection to an 
internal modem inside the laptop. However, PC cards used with laptop computers can 
also be technically classified as an internal modem. The PC card bus, formerly known as 
PCMCIA, is an architecture designed primarily for laptops and other portable com- 
puters. Adapters for this bus are sometimes called credit card adapters after their size and 
shape, which is roughly equal to that of a credit card. Because of their small size, most 
have a receptacle to which an external adapter must be connected for attachment to the 
media. These modems are also sometimes combined with a NIC in a single card called a 
combo card. 
Many vendors also offer a solution that is a single chassis containing a certain 
number of modem cards that can be connected directly to the network. Its modularity 
and its size are much more efficient than trying to maintain a shelf with a stack of 
external modems sitting on it. These have also been included in some new networking 
equipment. Manufacturers place analog modems in their equipment to facilitate redun- 
dancy features such as a backup network link. 
Analog Modems 
An analog modem is a communications device that enables a computer to talk to 
another computer through a standard telephone line. It does this by converting digital 
data from the computer to analog data for transmission over the telephone line and then 
back to digital data for the receiving computer. This is necessary because the Public 
Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) uses analog waves to transmit voice communica- 
tions, while computers use digital data. 
Because standard analog modems use a standard telephone line to acquire connec- 
tivity to the Internet or a remote network, they use the same type of telephone cable 
that's used by telephones. As we saw in the previous chapter, this type of cable uses an 
1KJ-11 connector, allowing the device to dial out using the same system that you use to 
make telephone calls.

Chapter 3 • Network Devices 
DSL and Cable Modems 
While modems that dial up the phone number of an ISP or a computer network have 
been around for many years, new kinds of modems have gained popularity in recent 
years. Cable modems and DSL modems access technology that provides connection 
speeds in the megabit per second (Mbps) range. 
Cable modems are used to access the Internet using the broadband technology of 
cable television lines. The cable modem is similar to an analog modem in that it trans- 
lates data into a form that can be transmitted, and retranslates it into data the computer 
can understand. When data is sent using cable modems, the modem translates it into a 
coaxial-based technology, which is used to split Internet access from television signals. 
Regardless of the medium used however, the basic purpose of the modem remains the 
same~to allow you to access the Internet or remote networks. 
The transmission speeds of a cable modem are typically as high as 1.544 Mbps. 
Although broadband Internet can provide greater speeds, allowing a download path of 
up to 27 Mbps, the cable service provider is generally connected to the Internet using a 
T1 line, which provides speeds of up to 1.544 Mbps. 
Cable modems provide a constant connection to the cable service provider that also 
acts in the role of an ISR The cable modem communicates with a Cable Modem 
Termination System (CMTS) provided by the cable service provider, but doesn't have 
the ability to directly access other cable modems. This is different from dial-up modems, 
which have the ability to dial directly into other computers. 
Another type of modem uses a technology called DSL. With DSL, your local tele- 
phone company plays the role of ISR providing access to the Internet through the 
twisted-pair cabling of your phone line. Unlike a standard modem that dials into an ISP 
over a telephone line, DSL allows simultaneous voice and data communication. In other 
words, you can surf the Web and talk on the phone at the same time. 
While an analog modem converts digital data to an analog wave, DSL transmits and 
receives data digitally across the phone line's twisted-pair cable. Because data isn't con- 
verted, a higher bandwidth is available to transfer data. DSL typically provides transmis- 
sion speeds of 1.544 Mbps, although it can provide data transfer rates of up to 6.1 Mbps. 
The speed of DSL does, however, decrease the further you are from a telephone com- 
pany's offices or a repeater that regenerates the signal, because data rates decrease as they 
travel over cabling. The closer you are to the telephone company's offices, the faster your 
DSL connection will be. 
There are several different variations of DSL available (shown in Table 3.2), which 
offer different data transfer rates and distance limitations.

ISDN Adapters 
ISDN is a system of digital telephone connections that enables data to be transmitted 
simultaneously end to end. This technology has been available for more than a decade, 
and before DSL and cable modems, ISDN was an optimal choice for faster, clearer data 
communication. It came about as the standard telephone system began its migration 
from an analog format to digital. 
History of ISDN 
In the 1950s, the phone companies began looking at ways to improve communications. 
They began by sampling the analog signals that were passed during a phone conversa- 
tion and attempted to convert them to digital signals. From this analog sampling, they 
determined that 64 Kbps would enable a digital signal to properly handle voice commu- 
nications through the telephone network. This became the foundation of ISDN. 

136 
Chapter 3 • Network Devices 
Because a standard did not exist among the different phone companies, the 
Consultative Committee for International Telephony and Telegraph (CCITT) began 
working on the Integrated Digital Network (IDN) in the late 1960s. IDN combined the 
functions of switching and transmission into one piece of hardware that could be set as 
the standard for all telephone companies to use. This initiative not only moved tele- 
phony services toward a standard, but also made the network much more efficient. It 
wasn't perfect, but was a step in the right direction. 
The concept of ISDN was introduced in 1972. The concept was based upon 
moving the analog-to-digital conversion equipment onto the customer's premises to 
enable voice and data services to be sent through a single line. Telephone companies also 
began using a new kind of digital communications link between each central office. A 
T1 link could carry twenty-four of these 64 Kbps voice channels, and it used the same 
amount of copper wire as only two analog voice calls. Throughout the 1970s the tele- 
phone companies continued to upgrade their switching offices. They began rolling out 
T1 links directly to customers to provide high-speed access.The need for an efficient 
solution was greater than ever. 
When ISDN was recognized by the ITU (International Telecommunications Union), 
an initiative was begun to define its standards. The initial recommendations were published 
in CCITT Recommendation 1.120 (1984) and described some initial guidelines for 
implementing ISDN. In the early 1990s, an effort was begun to establish a standard imple- 
mentation for ISDN in the United States.The NI-1 (National ISDN 1) standard was 
defined by the industry so that users would not have to know the type of switch they 
were connected to in order to buy equipment and software compatible with it. 
Because some major office switches were incompatible with this standard, some 
major telephone companies had trouble switching to the NI-1 standard. This caused 
some problems when trying to communicate between these nonstandard systems and 
everyone else. Eventually, all of the systems were brought up to standard. A set of core 
services was defined in all BRIs (Basic Rate Interfaces) of the NI-1 standard. The ser- 
vices include data call services, voice call services, call forwarding, and call waiting. Most 
devices today conform to the NI-1 standard. 
A more comprehensive standardization initiative, NI-2 (National ISDN 2) was 
adopted in recent years. Now, several major manufacturers of networking equipment 
have become involved to help set the standard and make ISDN a more economical 
solution. The NI-2 standard had two goals: standardize the Primary Rate Interface (PRI) 
as NI-1 did for the BRI, and simplify the identification process. Until this point, PRIs 
were mainly vendor-dependent, which made it difficult to interconnect them. Also, a 
standard was created for NI-2 for identifiers. 
ISDN Channels 
An ISDN transmission circuit consists of a logical grouping of data channels. With 
ISDN, voice and data are carried by these channels. Two types of channels are used for a 

Network Devices • Chapter 3 
137 
single ISDN connection, a B channel and a D channel. Each channel has a specific func- 
tion and bandwidth associated with it. The bearer channels (B channels) transfer data, 
and offer a bandwidth of 64 Kbps per each channel. A hardware limitation in some 
switches limits the B channels to 56 Kbps, or 56000 bytes. 
The data channel (D channel) handles signaling at 16 Kbps or 64 Kbps. This 
includes the session setup and teardown using a communications language known as 
DSS1. The purpose of this channel is to enable the B channels to strictly pass data.You 
remove the administrative overhead from them by using the D channel. The bandwidth 
available for the D channel is dependent upon the type of service~BRIs usually require 
16 Kbps and PRIs use 64 Kbps. Typically, ISDN service contains two B channels and a 
single D channel. 
H channels are used to specify a number of B channels. The following list shows the 
implementations: 
• 
H0 384 Kbps (6 B channels) 
• 
H10 
1472 Kbps (23 B channels) 
• 
Hll 
1536 Kbps (24 B channels) 
• 
H12 
1920 Kbps (30 B channels)~Europe 
ISDN Interfaces 
Although B channels and D channels can be combined in any number of ways, the 
phone companies created two standard configurations. There are two basic types of 
ISDN service: Basic Rate Interface and Primary Rate Interface. BIKI consists of two 64 
Kbps B channels and one 16 Kbps D channel for a total of 144 Kbps. Only 128 Kbps is 
used for user data transfers. BRIs were designed to enable customers to use their existing 
wiring. This provided a low-cost solution for customers and is why it is the most basic 
type of service today intended for small business or home use. 
PRI is intended for users with greater bandwidth requirements. It requires T1 car- 
riers to facilitate communications. Normally, the channel structure contains 23 B chan- 
nels plus one 64 Kbps D channel for a total of 1536 Kbps. This standard is used only in 
North America and Japan. European countries support a different kind of ISDN stan- 
dard for PRI. It consists of 30 B channels and one 64 Kbps D channel for a total of 
1984 Kbps. A technology known as Non-Facility Associated Signaling (NFAS) is avail- 
able to enable you to support multiple P1KI lines with one 64 Kbps D channel. 
To use B1KI services, you must subscribe to ISDN services through a local telephone 
company or provider. By default, you must be within 18,000 feet (about 3.4 miles) of the 
telephone company central office for BRI services. Repeater devices are available for 
ISDN service to extend this distance, but these devices can be very expensive. Special 
types of equipment are required to communicate with the ISDN provider switch and with 
other ISDN devices; you must have an ISDN terminal adapter and an ISDN router.

ISDN Devices 
The ISDN standard refers to the devices that are required to connect the end node to the 
network. Although some vendors provide devices that have several functions included, a 
separate device defines each function within the standard. The protocols that each device 
uses are also defined and are associated with a specific letter.Also known as reference points, 
these letters are 1K, S, T, and U. ISDN standards also define the device types. They are NT1, 
NT2, TE 1, TE2, and TA. The architecture for these devices and the reference points, which 
we'll discuss further in the next section, can be seen in Figure 3.3.

Reference points are used to define logical interfaces. They are, in effect, a type of pro- 
tocol used in communications. The following list contains the reference points: 
• 
R Defines reference point between a TE2 device and a TA device. 
• 
S Defines reference point between TEl devices and NT1 or NT2 devices. 
• 
T Defines reference point between NT1 and NT2 devices. 
• 
U Defines reference point between NT1 devices and line termination 
equipment. This is usually the central switch. 
Network Termination 1 (NT1) is the device that communicates directly with the cen- 
tral office (CO) switch. The NT1 receives a U interface connection from the telephone 
company and puts out a T interface connection for the NT2. NT1 handles the physical 
layer portions of the connection, such as physical and electrical termination, line moni- 
toring, and multiplexing. 

Network Devices • Chapter 3 
139 
Network Termination 2 (NT2) is placed between an NT1 device and any adapters or 
terminal equipment. Many devices provide the NT1 and NT2 device in the same phys- 
ical hardware. Larger installations generally separate these devices. An example of an 
NT2 device is a digital PBX or ISDN network router.An NT2 device provides an S 
interface and accepts a T interface from an NT1. NT2 usually handles data link and net- 
work layer functions in network with multiple devices such as contention monitoring 
and routing. 
Terminal Equipment 1 (TEl) is a local device that speaks via an S interface. It can be 
directly connected to the NT1 or NT2 devices. ISDN telephones and ISDN fax 
machines are good examples of TEl devices. 
Terminal Equipment 2 (TE2) devices are common everyday devices that can be used 
for ISDN connectivity.Any telecommunications device that is not in the TEl category 
is classified as a TE2 device. A terminal adapter is used to connect these devices to an 
ISDN network and attaches through an R interface. Examples of TE2 devices include 
standard fax machines, PCs, and regular telephones. 
A terminal adapter (TA) connects TE2 devices to an ISDN network. It connects 
through the R interface to the TE2 device and through the S interface to the ISDN 
network. The peripheral required for personal computers often includes an NT1 device. 
These are better known as ISDN modems. 
Identifiers 
Standard telephone lines use a ten-digit identifier that is permanently assigned. This is 
the telephone number. ISDN uses similar types of identifiers; however, they are not as 
easily used as a telephone number. ISDN uses five separate identifiers when making a 
connection. The provider assigns two of these when the connection is first set up: the 
Service Profile Identifier (SPID) and the directory number (DN).fhese are the most 
common numbers used because the other three are dynamically set up each time a con- 
nection is made. The three dynamic identifiers are TEI (Terminal Endpoint Identifier), 
BC (bearer code), and SAPI (Service Access Point Identifier). 
The SPID is the most important number needed when using ISDN. The provider 
statically assigns this number when the ISDN service is set up. It usually includes the 
directory number plus a few extra digits. The SPID usually contains between 10 and 14 
characters and varies from region to region. SPIDs can be assigned for every ISDN 
device, for the entire line, or for each B channel. 
The SPID is unique throughout the entire switch and must be set up correctly. If it 
is incorrect, it is like dialing, the wrong phone number~you will not be able to contact 
the person you are trying to reach. When an ISDN device is connected to the network, 
it sends the SPID to the switch. If the SPID is correct, the switch uses the stored infor- 
mation about your service profile to set up the data link. The ISDN device will not send 
the SPID again unless the device is disconnected from the network. 

140 
Chapter 3 • Network Devices 
The directory number is the ten-digit phone number the telephone company 
assigns to any analog line. ISDN services enable a greater deal of flexibility in using this 
number than analog services do. Unlike with an analog line where a one-to-one rela- 
tionship exists, the DN is only a logical mapping. A single DN can be used for multiple 
channels or devices.Also, up to eight DNs can be assigned to one device. Because a 
single BRI can have up to eight devices, it can support up to 64 directory numbers. This 
is why offices are able to have multiple phone numbers. Most standard BRI installations 
include only two directory numbers, one for each B channel. 
A Terminal Endpoint Identifier identifies the particular ISDN device to the switch. 
This identifier changes each time a device is connected to the ISDN network. Unlike 
the SPID or directory number, the TEI is dynamically allocated by the central switch. 
The Service Access Point Identifier identifies the particular interface on the switch 
that your devices are connected to. This identifier is used by the switch and is also 
dynamically updated each time a device connects to the network. 
The bearer code is an identifier made up of the combination of TEI and SAPI. It is 
used as the call reference and is dynamic like the two identifiers included within it. The 
BC changes each time a connection is established. 
Advantages of ISDN 
ISDN offers several major advantages over conventional analog methods. First, it has a 
speed advantage over normal dial-up lines. The fastest analog modem connection currently 
available is 56 Kbps. Because this is an analog connection, many modems cannot reach this 
speed because they are limited by the quality of the connection. This accounts for your 
connecting at different speeds each time you dial in to a remote network. Because phone 
lines cannot actually transmit at 56 Kbps, a special kind of compression is used to enable 
these speeds. Two standards currently exist. For Internet Service Providers to appease 
everyone, they must support both standards, which could get expensive quickly. 
ISDN enables you to use multiple digital channels at the same time to pass data 
through regular phone lines. The difference is that the connection being made from 
your computer is completely digital, with no conversion to or from analog.You can also 
use other protocols that enable you to bind channels together to get a higher bandwidth 
rate. In addition, ISDN takes half the time an analog line takes to make a connection. 
In addition to speed, ISDN supports multiple devices set up in one link. In an 
analog system, a single line is required for each device attached. For example, a separate 
phone line is needed for a normal phone, a fax machine, or a computer modem. Since 
ISDN supports multiple devices, you can use each one of these items on a single line. It 
will also be clearer due to the fact that the data is being passed in a digital format. 
Because ISDN uses a separate channel, the D channel for signaling, it removes the 
administrative overhead required. This means that the data is not hindered by the sessions 
setups and the communications required by the devices. The D channel keeps all of this 

Network Devices • Chapter 3 
141 
information off the data streams. Because of the separation, the setup and takedown of 
each session is much faster. In addition, ISDN equipment is able to handle calls more 
intelligently. 
CSU/DSU 
The somewhat lengthy acronym CSU/DSU is short for Channel Service Unit / Data 
Service Unit A CSU/DSU is a device that takes a signal from a digital medium and mul- 
tiplexes it. Although a CSU and a DSU can be separate components, they are generally 
packaged as a single unit. The CSU is used to connect a terminal to a digital line, while 
a DSU performs diagnostic and protective functions. 
A CSU/DSU terminates the end of a leased T-carrier line, which is a high speed 
line that can be used to connect a LAN to a WAN (wide area network). WANs are cov- 
ered in greater depth in Chapter 7. The CSU/DSU is similar to a modem in that it con- 
nects to the media that will carry the data, but since the T-carrier transmits the data 
digitally, there is no need for device to modulate and demodulate between digital and 
analog formats. The CSU/DSU can be a separate component that attaches to a router 
and provides an interface between the router and the line, but many newer routers have 
more modular capabilities that allow you to purchase what are sometimes referred to as 
WAN interface cards, or WICs for short. 
This is a card that incorporates the CSU/DSU into the actual port and cable con- 
nection so you do not have an external CSU; it's built directly into the router itself, 
thereby easing maintenance and management. 
A T-carrier line is a leased telephone line that runs over fiber optic cabling and can 
provide different speeds depending on the level used.A T1 line consists of 24 separate 
channels called DS0s that are 64 Kbps each. In total, this equals 1.544 Mbps for a full T1 
line. Because some companies may not need this amount of bandwidth, it is possible to 
lease only a portion of the channels. For example, if you rented two channels on a T1 
line, you would have a 128 Kbps connection. When only a portion of the T1 line is 
used, it is referred to as fractional T1. If more than 1.544 Mbps of bandwidth were 
needed, a company could also lease another level of a T-carrier line called a T3 line, 
which provides speeds of 44.736 Mbps.

Network Interface Cards 
Network interface cards, also referred to as network adapter cards or simply network 
cards, are the key components that allow computers or other devices to communicate 
with the rest of the network. Installed on workstations, servers, printers, and other net- 
work devices, it provides an interface to the network that allows data to be transmitted 
and received across the network media. 
Simply put, the NIC performs the following functions: 
It translates data from the parallel data bus to a serial bit stream for transmission 
across the network. 
• 
It formats packets of data in accordance with protocol. 
• 
It transmits and receives data based on the hardware address of the card. 
A NIC works as an interface between a computer's expansion bus and the medium 
that's used to transmit and receive data across the network. In many cases, this means that 
it attaches to the cable used on a network, but wireless NICs are also available that allow 
data to be transferred through the air. Although the NIC can be integrated into the 
system board, it is typically an add-on component for a computer, much like a video 
card or sound card is. The NIC is normally installed as an expansion board by plugging 
it into a bus slot, and has a connector that allows the network media to be attached to it. 
www.syngress.com 

Network Devices • Chapter 3 
143 
Installing a NIC 
Installing a NIC is like installing any other interface card in a computer.You have to 
determine the slot it will go in and have the right tools to remove the expansion slot 
cover and to remove and insert screws. Newer computers do not require any tools, not 
even screwdrivers. The ability to work on a computer with your hands free of tools is 
making any technician's job easier. The Network+ exam will challenge you to know 
what to do in certain situations. In this section you will learn several troubleshooting 
techniques and how to recognize the common issues that you will face with network 
interface cards. 
NICs are built for computer bus types such as ISA (Industry Standard Architecture), 
EISA (Extended Industry Standard Architecture), MCA (Micro Channel Architecture), 
and PCI (Peripheral Component Interconnect). Most of the newer NICs support plug 
and play features and can be automatically configured by the operating system when the 
physical installation is done. This feature makes installation of the NIC considerably 
easier than with older cards. 
Before you begin the physical installation of the NIC, or network adapter, be sure to 
address the following issues: 
• 
Ensure that the adapter is compatible with the data bus, the protocol, the 
media, and the network operating system. In the case of Windows network 
operating systems, the hardware compatibility list (HCL) lists adapters that have 
been verified for use with a particular operating system (such as NT, 2000, 
2003, and XP). 
• 
Ensure that there is an open bus slot on the machine in which you want to 
install the adapter. 
• 
Ensure that the adapter includes all items necessary for installation, including 
external transceivers or adapters, a T-connector for a thinwire Ethernet adapter, 
and product documentation. 
• 
Ensure that the software, including the network driver and utilities for testing 
and configuring the adapter, is included. If a software driver is not provided, a 
driver may be included with operating system installation media. If not, drivers 
and driver updates may be available for download from the adapter manufac- 
turer via the Internet or a bulletin board service. 
• 
Remember that the NIC cannot do any useful work until high-level protocols 
and network services have also been installed and configured.

NIC Types and Operation 
While NICs are all designed to allow computers and devices to access a network, not all 
NICs are the same.As we saw in Chapter 2, there are many different types of media and 
connectors that may be used on a network, which is why there are different NlCs. 
Because of this, NICs are often defined by the following criteria: 
• 
The type of Data Link protocol they support, such as an Ethernet or Token 
Ring 
• 
The type of media they connect to 
• 
The data bus for which they were designed 
In using a NIC, the computer must have a software driver installed in order to interact 
with the NIC, just as it must for any other peripheral device. These drivers enable the 
operating system and higher-level protocols to control the functions of the adapter. 
The NlCs that exist in the various workstations on a network communicate with 
each other using their own unique addresses. The MAC address, or hardware address, is a 
12-digit number consisting of digits 0-9 and letters A-E It is basically a hexadecimal 
(basel6) number assigned to the card by the manufacturer. The MAC address consists of 
two pieces: the first signifies which vendor it comes from, the second is the serial 
number unique to that manufacturer. This address must be unique on each network card 
on a network.You may wonder how a manufacturer can ensure uniqueness among all 
the network cards in the world. No doubt there are network cards that have the same 
address, but each manufacturer is assigned a range by the various network standards 
organizations, and they use only that range. Within the range, a manufacturer may have

Chapter 3 • Network Devices 
duplicates, but the duplicates are so spread out over time that it is almost impossible for a 
network, small or large, to have two devices with the same MAC address. 
~ M WARNING 
'~!~' NICs are the most common interface for a computer or device to connect to 
'!~I media on the network. They operate at the Data Link Layer of the OSI model 
Transceivers 
As we discussed in Chapter 2, the term transceiver is short for transmitter-receiver, and it 
is a component of a NIC that transmits and receives electrical signals across the trans- 
mission media. Transceivers are also the part of the interface that actually connects to the 
media. While transceivers can be external to the network card, they are typically built 
onto the NIC.A transceiver that's built onto a card is called an onboard transceiver. 
While NICs are generally designed to connect to a particular type of media, they 
can also connect to multiple media types. A transceiver type setting is required for net- 
work adapters that are capable of attaching to more than one media type. Typical cards 
of this nature include Ethernet cards that have both twisted-pair and coaxial connectors. 
This is one of the more common oversights in configuring a network interface card and 
the card can be rendered nonfunctional if it is configured for the wrong media connec- 
tion. To alleviate this problem, some cards of this type have an auto setting that causes 
the card to search for the transceiver that has media connected to it. 
Modern Network Devices 
While many of the devices we've discussed so far have been used since the early days of 
networking, a number of devices have either taken over the roles of these devices and/or 
are a predominant part of a modern network environment. These devices are crucial to a 
network's ability to handle data and ensure it reaches its intended destination as its being 
transmitted. 
Switches 
Switches provide services that are similar to those provided by Ethernet hubs. A switch 
~ 
takes data from a cable connected to its port, but unlike a hub that forwards the data 
through all of its other ports, a switch will forward the packet through a single port that 
leads to the computer that the data is intended for. The only time a switch will send out 
the data to all of its ports is when a broadcast message is sent. 
Switches offer full duplex dedicated bandwidth to LAN segments or desktops.You 
can think of a switch as an intelligent hub that guarantees a specific amount (10, 100, or 

Network Devices • Chapter 3 
147 
1000 Mbps) of bandwidth to the computer that it is connected to. With a hub, you are 
guaranteed some of the bandwidth all of the time. This means that hubs are not intelli- 
gent enough to account for collisions on the network; you may be connected to a 10 
Mbps port, but you may only be receiving 4 Mbps of throughput because of the amount 
of traffic on the network. With a switch, you are guaranteed the entire limit of your 
bandwidth because the switch is intelligent and can examine packets and send them in 
the right direction. 
Multiport Bridging 
Switches are also sometimes referred to as multiport bridges, as they can perform the same 
functions as a bridge, which we discussed earlier. Unlike a bridge that can connect two 
LANs together or segment a large one into two smaller ones, a switch has multiple ports 
and thereby has the ability to connect more than two different segments of a network. 
In multiport bridging, a switch automatically determines the MAC addresses of the 
devices connected to each port of the switch. The switch examines each packet it 
receives to determine its destination MAC address or IP address (depending on the OSI 
layer it works on, as we'll discuss later in this chapter), and sends it out on the appro- 
priate port. It doesn't matter if" the destination computer is on the same LAN as the 
computer that is sending the data. This allows two different networks to communicate 
with one another, yet still appear as part of the same network. 
Network Pe?formance Improvement witk Switcking 
The primary benefit of implementing switching technology is that it improves network 
performance. It is important to note that if you are not having traffic problems on your 
www.syngress.com 

148 
Chapter 3 • Network Devices 
network, adding a switch will probably not change your network's performance. If your 
network is having traffic problems, switching, when implemented properly, can greatly 
increase your performance. 
Switching is a fairly involved process. For example, Computer A transmits a packet 
to Computer C. The packet enters the switch from Port 1 and then travels a direct route 
to Port 3. From Port 3 the packet is transmitted to Computer C. During this process, 
Computer B is unaware of the traffic between Computer A and C because there is a 
direct path within the switch and no shared bandwidth. 
DAY TIP 
Nliiiii!iiiii ~"~: switches are a to~ic that's tested oo the Net,,vork+ e×am and an important ~art 
~iiiiii iiil '~' o~ net~orkioO. ~t's ~ise to review the io~ormation a~out s~itc~es so that you're 
familiar with what they are and the roles they perform. Remember that it is a 
best practice to use switches whenever possible because of the increase in per- 
formance over a standard hub. When a standard hub is used, the network's 
bandwidth is shared by all users connected to the hub; with a switch, however, 
all users get the full network bandwidth. For example, a 10 Mbps network with 
an 8-port hub and 8 PCs will allow each user to have (10 / 8) Mbps bandwidth, 
but with a switching hub, each user would have a full 10 Mbps bandwidth. 
Layer 2 Switches 
A Layer2 switch is a common type of switch that looks at the MAC address of a packet 
to determine where it is destined. As we discussed earlier in this chapter when we talked 
about NICs, the MAC address is unique to the NIC and makes it identifiable on the 
network. When a packet of data is sent to the switch, it includes the MAC address of the 
destination computer, so the switch can tell which computer the data is meant for. 
Upon viewing this information, the switch can then send it through the appropriate 
port that will take it to this computer. 
The reason this type of switch is called a Layer 2 switch is that it works at the Data 
Link Layer of the OSI model. The Data Link Layer handles many issues for communi- 
cating on a simple network. As we'll see in Chapter 5, where the OSI model is discussed 
in depth, the 802 standard defines the Data Link Layer as having multiple sublayers: 
Logical Link Control (LLC) and Media Access Control (MAC). The LLC sublayer starts, 
maintains, and manages connections between devices, while the MAC sublayer enables 
multiple devices to share the media. The MAC sublayer also maintains physical device 
addresses for communicating with other devices.

Layer 3 Switches 
Layer 3 switches provide more features than Layer 2 switches, as they can handle 
routing. Routing functions at Layer 3 of the OSI model, hence the name. Layer 3 
switches function as both a switch and a router simultaneously. As we'll see later in this 
chapter when we discuss routers, routing allows a device to determine the best way of 
sending the data to a destination computer through the use of internal routing tables. 
Because a Layer 3 switch provides similar features to those of a router, they can use net- 
work or IP addresses to identify the location of a computer on the network. 
A Layer 3 switch works by utilizing switching tables and switching algorithms to 
determine how to send data via MAC addressing from host to host, device to device. 
Since switching is the process of sending data from segment to segment based on the 
MAC address, what happens when data has to be sent to a remote network? The data is 
sent to the default gateway (commonly a router), which sends the data to its destination. 
The time spent sending the data from the switch to the router and then the time spent 
by the router taking the packet off the wire to read it is now eliminated or shortened 
drastically by implementing a Layer 3 switch. This is because a Layer 3 switch is built 
into a Layer 2 switch so data does not have to be sent to a router; that is, the router is 
built into the circuitry of the switch so the data is routed as quickly as the switch can 
send it to itself- much quicker than one device trying to send data to another device. 
Now consider the speed at which a high-speed switch works. Consider the amount of 
packets that could be sent across that cable. Now you can start to see the benefits of a 
Layer 3 switch; having the two devices sandwiched together increases the efficiency of 
the transmission, thus speeding it up drastically as the volume of data increases. 
~{ ~i ~a,~A M WARNING 
i !~ On the Network+ exam you may hear the term brouter. What is a brouter? It's 
~ 
a device that can route specific protocols and bridge others, thus combining the 
capabilities of a bridge and a router. So, simply put, a brouter is a network 
~ 
device that can perform the functions of both a bridge and a router, much like 
a Layer 3 switch can perform the same type of functionality- they are just two 
different devices with different names. A brouter is older terminology and tech- 
nology, whereas a Layer 3 switch is today's terminology and technology. 
Layer 4 and Beyond 
Because of the success of Layer 3 switching and the performance gains it can provide, it 
was no surprise that switching would climb higher along the OSI's layered model. Layer 
4 switches work at the Transport Layer of the OSI model, and have the ability to look at 
information in the packets it receives to not only identify the MAC address and IP 
www.syngress.com 

150 
Chapter 3 • Network Devices 
address of the destination computer, but also the application protocols being used to 
send it. The switch can determine if HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), FTP (File 
Transfer Protocol), or other protocols in the TCP/IP (Transmission Control 
Protocol/Internet Protocol) suite are being used to send the packet, and can also identify 
the application that uses the data. Because the packet contains information about the 
application, priorities can be set on packets, as well as rules about how they are to be 
forwarded. 
Layer 5 switches work at the Session Layer of the OSI model, and use information 
in the packet provided by this layer for routing. The Session Layer provides information 
such as Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) that allow the switch to route the packet 
more effectively to a destination computer. A URL is a method of addressing that is 
commonly used on the Internet.At the time of this writing, Layer 5 is the highest layer 
of the OSI model that switches work with. 
!! iiiiiii iiii 
~ M  
WARNING 
~!~iiiiii 
i~ Switches operate at many layers of the OSI model. They work at the Data Link 
....... iiiY Layer (Layer 2), and sometimes at the Network Layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model. 
Layer 3 switches have an integrated router function that allows them to make 
iiiiiiiiiiiiii~ decisions as to where the data should be sent. 
Routers 
Routers route data packets across a network by opening the packet and making routing 
decisions based on the contents. On a network that uses TCP/IP as its communication 
protocol (which we'll discuss in great detail in Chapter 6), IP addresses are used as a 
method of identifying computers. This identification is used to ensure that data is sent to 
the correct computer on the network. In order for these computers to communicate, 
however, a device is needed to guide the TCP/IP network traffic to its destination. This 
is where routers come in. 
Although we won't delve deeply into the OSI model until Chapter 5, we men- 
tioned the Network Layer earlier in this chapter. The Network Layer, or Layer 3, is 
responsible for addressing messages and translating their logical addresses into an actual 
physical address. It is important to remember that a router is protocol-dependent. That 
means that a TCP/IP router can connect to a TCP/IP network. In other words, this is 
the layer of the OSI model that is responsible for determining where to send the 
TCP/IP packets to their destinations. Routers essentially separate different broadcast 
domains from one another and route traffic based on the destination, or Layer 3, address 
(the Layer 2 address is the MAC address). 

Network Devices • Chapter 3 
151 
When you want to communicate with another computer network, your computer 
essentially looks within the local network first before heading out to search for a remote 
address. For example, when your computer needs to access a file on another computer, 
your computer first checks its ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) cache to see if that 
computer has a recognizable MAC address. If it does not, your computer checks the 
local subnet by either broadcasting or asking a name server for help. 
If the address is not found on the local subnet or network, your computer checks to 
see if you have a default gateway or router to send the information to.Your computer 
sends this information to your router and the router routes the message accordingly. The 
router receives the data with the address information and checks its routing tables to see 
where it should send your data. The type of router sometimes affects how quickly your 
data arrives at its destination. 
Routers are either static or dynamic. In most cases, you'll only have to deal with a 
dynamic router~a router whose routing tables are populated automatically by receiving 
updates from other routers. Static routers have fixed routing tables that have to be 
updated manually. These static touters are at a disadvantage because they cannot commu- 
nicate with any type of router in case a network route changes due to hardware failure 
or change to the network layout. 
The main benefit of a dynamic router is that, depending on which type of routing 
protocol is used, it will attempt to route your network traffic to your destination as 
quickly as possible. For example, if you have a network that is standardized on Cisco 
routers (dynamic) that all communicate with one another using the OSPF (Open 
Shortest Path First) routing protocol (which is also a dynamic routing protocol). All of 
your routers are communicating with one another via broadcasts that they send when- 
ever there is a change in their routing. This comes in very handy and adds a layer of 
redundancy so that if a segment of the network fails, your routers will be able to route 
the network traffic to other paths so that no matter what happens to the network, your 
data will always arrive at its destination. 
If you were using a static router and you had a segment fail on your network, your 
network traffic would cease until the segment was repaired or another static route was 
mapped on the router. This puts static routing at a severe disadvantage in a large, com- 
plex network environment. 
Understanding Static and Dynamic Routing 
When it comes to routing, there is a huge difference between static and dynamic. Early 
routers had to be programmed with exactly which networks they could route between 
which interfaces, especially if there were many network interfaces. This is called static 
routing, and network administrators had to add, maintain, and delete routes of the net- 
work routing devices manually. In a small company this may not be much of a chore, 
but for medium to large networks, this can be nearly impossible. These larger networks 
almost always employ many logical subnets, which requires you to update the route 

152 
Chapter 3 • Network Devices 
tables on each routing device. If these remote subnets are connected by routers with 
static route tables, you have to add the exact static route in order to communicate 
between the two subnets. Table 3.3 shows an example of what is contained in the 
routing table.

In this simplified table you can see how you only specify the router to be used to 
reach the destination, not the actual destination itself. The number of hops determines 
which route is the most efficient. If a route claims it can reach the destination in one 
fewer hop than the next router, then it is sent to that router. If there are two identical 
routes to the same destination, the route with the fewest hops will be used. 
One change to a network address means visiting every routing device that employs 
static routing and updating the entry. What do we do if our network is fairly large 
and complex? We must then use routing devices capable of dynamically updating the 
route tables. 
Dynamic routing does not require the network administrator to edit complex routing 
tables in order to communicate with other networks or segments. These routers communi- 
cate with each other using a powerful routing protocol such as Routing Information 
Protocol (RIP) or Open Shortest Path First (OSPF). They can also query other routers for 
updated route information, which can create more efficient paths for sending packets or 
locate an alternative route if the original route fails. The routers can broadcast the routes 
they have discovered to neighboring routers, and, in turn, accept routes from other neigh- 
boring routers. The Internet is comprised of many dynamic routers, which is an example 
of why dynamic routing is so important. Could you imaging having to update a static 
routing table on thousands of static routers? I don't think so. 
These dynamic routers, however, cannot update the route tables of static routers or 
non-dynamic routers. There are a few situations in which integrating static and dynamic 
routers is acceptable: 
• 
When you have a router at either end of a slow WAN link. This router will 
not increase traffic by broadcasting updated route information to the router on 
the other end of the link. 
• 
When you require a packet to travel the same path each time to a remote 
network. Add the path you would like the packet to take in order to reach the

Network Devices • Chapter 3 
153 
destination network.You cannot enter the entire path over several routers, only 
the path to the first router. 
When you want to configure a static router to point towards a dynamic router 
to take advantage of the dynamic router indirectly. This is the next best thing to 
using a dynamic router.You can hand off the packet to the dynamic router and 
let this router determine the most efficient path to the destination based on 
the paths it has learned from neighboring dynamic routers. 
WARNING 
Routers operate at the Network Layer of the OSI model. The exam will deal with 
questions regarding both routers and the OSI model. 
 iiiiiii!  
Switching Routers 
As we discussed earlier in this chapter, switches have the ability to perform the tasks 
normally associated with other devices. A Layer 3 switch has the ability to open a packet 
and view the IP address and MAC address of the computer the packet is destined for. 
The switch can then review routing tables on the switch to determine the best route to 
send the data. By performing these functions, the switch is able to do the work of a 
router and get the packet to its intended destination by using the best route. 
Security Integration 
As reports of hacking, viruses, worms, and other attacks on networks become common- 
place in the news, the need for security in network devices and networks in general 
continue to grow. Equipment and software can be added to a network, which can work 
with existing devices to protect your LAN and its data. Choosing which security mea- 
sures to implement can be challenging, as there is an increasing number of products 
available. However, the more protected your network, the less chance there will be of it 
being damaged from outside sources. 
Convergence of Security 
Just as devices are including more and more features in them that make other devices 
obsolete or unnecessary to a network, devices are also including more security features 
that historically had to be purchased separately. Routers that are used for DSL or cable 
Internet include features such as a built in firewall with the router. The hardware-based 
firewall provides a barrier to incoming traffic from the WAN, and thereby prevents it 
from reaching your local computer or LAN. The hardware firewall, however, is limited in 
restricting and monitoring the incoming and outgoing traffic, and should be comple- 
mented by a software firewall and antivirus software.

Firewalls 
~ 
Afirewall protects a secure internal network from a public insecure network. Firewalls 
.___""'~, are devices or software that have the ability to control the traffic that's sent from an 
external network, such as the Internet, to an internal network or local computer. As 
we'll see later in this chapter, the features that are provided by a firewall will vary 
depending on the type you choose for your network. 
The most common implementation today is the use of a firewall between an orga- 
nization's internal network and the Internet. Firewalls can be very complex because they 
provide more features that just packet filtering. They can also provide multiple layers of 
protection, including actually scanning the information stored in the packets for mali- 
cious data as they pass through. They use advanced techniques to monitor connections, 
to log potential intrusions, and to act upon these incidents. 
Firewall Arckitecture 
A firewaU is a combination of techniques and technologies used to control the flow of 
data between networks. A firewall enables all traffic to pass through to each network; 
however, it compares the traffic to a set of rules that determine how the traffic will be 
managed. If the traffic matches the rules for acceptable data, the traffic is passed on to 
the network. If the rule specifies that the data be denied, the traffic cannot continue and 
will be bounced back. Although some implementations may do this differently, the same 
basic functionality is used.

Dual-Homed Host Firewalls 
A dual-homedfirewall consists of a single computer with two physical network interfaces. 
This computer acts as a gateway between two networks. The server's routing capability is 
disabled so that the firewall can handle all traffic management. Either an application- 
level proxy or circuit-level firewall is run to provide data transfer capability.You must be 
careful not to enable routing within the network operating system or you will bypass 
your firewall software. Figure 3.6 shows a dual-homed host firewall configuration. 
Figure 3.6 A Dual-Homed Host Firewall 
Firewall 
Screened Host Firewalls 
Screened host firewall configurations are considered by many to be more secure than 
the dual-homed firewall. In this configuration, you place a screening router between the 
gateway host and the public network. This enables you to provide packet filtering before 
the packets reach the host computer. The host computer could then run a proxy to pro- 
vide additional security to this configuration. As packets travel into the internal network, 
they only know of the computer host that exists. Figure 3.7 shows an illustration of a 
screened-host configuration.

Screened Subnet Firewalls 
A screened subnet firewall configuration takes security to the next level by further iso- 
lating the internal network from the public network. An additional screening router is 
placed between the internal network and the firewall proxy server. The internal router 
handles local traffic while the external router handles inbound and outbound traffic to 

156 
Chapter 3 • Network Devices 
the public network. This provides two additional levels of security. First, by adding a link 
internally, you can protect the firewall host from an attack by an internal source. Second, 
it makes an external attack much more difficult because the number of links is 
increased. Figure 3.8 shows the screened subnet firewall configuration.

Screened Host Firewall 
Firewall Types 
There are three basic categories of firewalls: packet level, application level, and circuit 
level. Each uses a different security approach, thus providing different advantages and dis- 
advantages. One additional feature that was discussed earlier is encryption services. Most 
firewalls provide some sort of cryptographic services for data transfers. 
When you have a complete understanding of the features and type of security that is 
needed from a firewall, you can then determine the implementation that bests fits the 
environment. 
Packet Level Firewall 
A packet level firewall is usually a form of screening router that examines packets based 
upon filters that are set up at the Network and Transport Layers.You can block 
incoming or outgoing transfers based on a TCP/IP address or other rules. For example, 
you may choose to not allow any incoming IP connections, but enable all outgoing IP 
connections.You can set up rules that will enable certain types of requests to pass while 
other are denied. Rules can be based on source address, destination address, session pro- 
tocol type, and the source and destination port. Because this works at only three layers, it 
is a very basic form of protection. To properly provide security to the network, all seven 
layers must be protected by a full-featured conventional firewall. 
Application Level Firewall 
The application level firewall understands the data at the application level. Application 
Layer firewalls operate at the application, presentation, and session layers. Data at the 
application level can actually be understood and monitored to verify that no harmful 
information is included. An example of an application level firewall is an Internet proxy 
or mail server. Many uses are available through some form of proxy, however these func- 
tions are usually very intensive to provide security at that level. In addition, often clients 
www.syngress.com 

Network Devices • Chapter 3 
157 
must be configured to pass through the proxy to use it. Proxy servers are also used to 
mask the original origin of a packet. For example, an Internet proxy will pass the 
request on; however, the source listed in the packet is the proxy server address. The 
overall server doesn't just filter the packets, it actually takes in the original and retrans- 
mits a new packet through a different network interface. 
Circuit Level Firewall 
A circuit level firewall is similar to an application proxy except that the security mecha- 
nisms are applied at the time the connection is established. From then on, the packets 
flow between the hosts without any further checking from the firewall. Circuit level 
firewalls operate at the transport layer. 
Firewall Features 
As firewalls have evolved, additional feature sets have grown out of or been added to 
these implementations. They are used to provide faster access and better security mecha- 
nisms. As encryption techniques have improved, they are being incorporated more in to 
firewall implementations. Also, caching is being provided for services such as the World 
Wide Web. This enables pages to be cached for a period of time, which can dramatically 
speed up the user experience. New management techniques and technologies such as 
virtual private networks (VPNs) are now being included as well. 
Content filtering is another major feature of a firewall. Because of the possible 
damage a Java applet, JavaScript, or ActiveX component can do to a network in terms of 
threatening security or attacking machines, many companies filter out applets com- 
pletely. Firewalls can be configured to filter out applets, scripts, and components so that 
they are removed from an HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) document that is 
returned to a computer on the internal network. Preventing such elements from ever 
being displayed will cause the Web page to appear differently from the way its author 
intended, but any content that is passed through the firewall will be more secure. 
DMZ 
DMZ is short for demilitarized zone, and is a military term used to signify a recognized 
safe area between two countries where, by mutual agreement, no troops or war-making 
activities are allowed. There are usually strict rules regarding what is allowed within the 
zone. In computer security, the DMZ is a neutral network segment where systems 
accessible to the public Internet are housed, and which offers some basic levels of pro- 
tection against attacks. 
The creation of these DMZ segments is usually done in one of two ways: 
• 
Layered DMZ implementation 
• 
Multiple interface firewall implementation 
www.syngress.com 

158 
Chapter 3 • Network Devices 
In the first method, the systems are placed between two firewall devices with dif- 
ferent rule sets, which allows systems on the Internet to connect to the offered services 
on the DMZ systems, but prevents them from connecting to the computers on the 
internal segments of the organization's network (often called the protected network). Figure 
3.9 shows a common installation using this layered approach.

As shown in Figure 3.10, the second method is to add a third interface to the fire- 
wall and place the DMZ systems on that network segment. This allows the same firewall 
to manage the traffic between the Internet, the DMZ, and the protected network. Using 
one firewall instead of two lowers the costs of the hardware and centralizes the rule sets 
for the network, making it easier to manage and troubleshoot problems. Currently, this 
multiple interface design is the preferred method for creating a DMZ segment.

internal network 
In either case, the DMZ systems offer some level of protection from the public 
Internet while they remain accessible for the specific services they provide to external 
users. In addition, the internal network is protected by a firewall from both the external 
network and the systems in the DMZ. Because the DMZ systems still offer public 
access, they are more prone to compromise and thus they are not trusted by the systems 
in the protected network. This scenario allows for public services while still maintaining 
a degree of protection against attack. 
The role of the firewall in all of these scenarios is to manage the traffic between the 
network segments. The basic idea is that other systems on the Internet are allowed to 
access only the services of the DMZ systems that have been made public. If an Internet 
system attempts to connect to a service not made public, the firewall drops the traffic 
and logs the information about the attempt (if configured to do so). Systems on a pro- 
tected network are allowed to access the Internet as they require, and they may also 
access the DMZ systems for managing the computers, gathering data, or updating con- 
tent. In this way, systems are exposed only to attacks against the services that they offer 
and not to underlying processes that may be running on them.

Chapter 3 • Network Devices 
ACLs 
ACLs are access control lists, which are used to control access to specific resources on a 
computer. An ACL resides on a computer, and is a table with information on which 
users have specific rights to files and folders on the machine. The operating system uses 
this attribute of the file or folder to determine whether a user is allowed or denied spe- 
cific privileges to the object. By using the ACL you can provide users of the network 
with the rights they need to access these files or folders. However, in doing so, it is 
advisable that you only provide users with the minimum amount of access required by 
users to perform their jobs. 
Proxy Server (Caching Appliances) 
A proxy server is a server that performs a function on behalf of another system. In most 
cases this is a system that is acting as a type of gateway between the Internet and a com- 
pany network. The employees who wish to access the Internet will perform actions as 
they normally would with their browser, but the browser will submit the request to the 
proxy server. The proxy server will then transmit the request on the Internet and receive 
the results. The results will then be sent to the original requester. A nice feature of the 
proxy server is that the Web pages that are not encrypted will be saved in a cache on the 
local hard disk. If another user requests the same page, the proxy server will not request 
the page from the Internet, but retrieve it from the hard disk. This saves quite a bit of 
time by not having to wait on Internet requests, which may be coming from an over- 
burdened Web server. 
The proxy server can cache information going both ways; since it can cache requests 
going out, it can also act as a proxy for Internet users making requests to the company 
Web server. This can help keep traffic minimized on the company network. 
Another feature of the proxy server is that it can act as the physical gateway between 
the Internet and company network by filtering out specific information, especially if you 
use the proxy server to act as a proxy between the Internet and the company Web server. 
Filtering can be configured for allowing or not allowing packets if they meet one or more 
of the following: specific port, direction of transfer, or source or destination of packets. 
Tunnels and Encryption 
Tunneling is used to create a virtual tunnel (a virtual point-to-point link) between you 
and your destination using an untrusted public network as the medium. In most cases, 
this would be the Internet. When establishing a tunnel, commonly called a VPN (which 
we'll discuss in the next section), a safe connection is being created between two points 
that cannot be examined by outsiders. In other Words, all traffic that is traveling through 
this tunnel can be seen, but cannot be understood by those on the outside. All packets 
are encrypted and carry information designed to provide authentication and integrity. 
This ensures that they are tamperproof and thus can withstand common IP attacks, such 
as the man-in-the-middle (MITM) and packet replay. When a VPN is created, traffic is 
private and safe from prying eyes.

VPNs 
A VPN provides users with a secure method of connectivity through a public internet- 
work such as the Internet. Most companies use dedicated connections to connect to 
remote sites, but when users want to send private data over the Internet they should 
provide additional security by encrypting the datausing a VPN. 
When a VPN is implemented properly, it provides improved wide-area security, 
reduces costs associated with traditional WANs, improves productivity, and improves sup- 
port for users who telecommute. Cost savings are twofold. First, companies save money 
by using public networks (such as the Internet) instead of paying for dedicated circuits 
(such as point-to-point T1 circuits) between remote offices. Second, telecommuters do 
not have to pay long-distance fees to connect to ILAS (Remote Access Service) servers. 
They can simply dial into their local ISPs and create a virtual tunnel to the office. A 
tunnel is created by wrapping (or encapsulating) a data packet inside another data packet 
and transmitting it over a public medium. Tunneling requires three different protocols: 
• 
Carrier Protocol The protocol used by the network (IP on the Internet) 
that the information is traveling over. 
• 
Encapsulating Protocol The protocol (PPTP, L2TP, IPSec., Secure Shell 
[SSH]) that is wrapped around the original data. 
• 
Passenger Protocol The original data being carried. 
Essentially, there are two different types o£VPNs: site-to-site and remote access. 
Site-to-Site VPN 
Site-to-site VPNs are normally established between corporate offices that are separated 
by a physical distance extending further than a normal LAN. VPNs are available in soft- 
ware (such as Windows network operating systems) and hardware (firewalls such as 
Nokia/CheckPoint and SonicWALL) implementations. Generally speaking, software 
implementations are easier to maintain. However, hardware implementations are consid- 
ered more secure, since they are not impacted by operating system vulnerabilities. For 
example, suppose Company XYZ has offices in Boston and Phoenix. As shown in 
Figure 3.11,both offices connect to the Internet via a T1 connection. They have imple- 
mented VPN-capable firewalls in both offices, and established an encryption tunnel 
between them.

Firewall with VPN 
The first step in creating a site-to-site VPN is selecting the protocols to be used. 
Common protocols associated with VPN are PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol), 
L2TP (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol), SSH (Secure Shell), and IPSec (IP Security). PPTP 
and L2TP are used to establish a secure tunnel connection between two sites. 
Once a tunnel is established, encryption protocols are used to secure data passing 
through the tunnel. As data is passed from one VPN to another, it is encapsulated at the 
source and unwrapped at the target. The process of establishing the VPN and wrapping 
and unwrapping the data is transparent to the end user. 
Most commercially available firewalls come with a VPN module that can be set up 
to easily communicate with another VPN-capable device. Microsoft has implemented 
site-to-site VPN tools on the Windows 2000 platform using either RRAS or the newest 
rendition of Microsoft's proxy server, Microsoft ISA Server 2000. 
Whichever product or service is chosen, it is important to ensure that each end of 
the VPN is configured with identical protocols and settings. 
Remote Access VPN 
A remote access VPN, known as a private virtual dial-up network (PVDN), differs from 
a site-to-site VPN in that end users are responsible for establishing the VPN tunnel 
between the workstation and their remote office. An alternative to connecting directly 
to the corporate VPN is connecting to an enterprise service provider (ESP) that ulti- 
mately connects to the corporate VPN. 
In either case, users connect to the Internet or an ESP through a point of presence 
(POP) using their particular VPN client software (see Figure 3.12). Once the tunnel is 
set up, users are forced to authenticate with the VPN server, usually by username and 
password.

A remote access VPN is a great solution for a company with several employees 
working in the field. The remote access VPN allows these employees to transmit data to

remote access VPN. 
IDS 
IDS is short for an Intrusion Detection System, and it is designed to inspect and detect 
the kinds of traffic or network behavior patterns that match known attack signatures or 
that suggest potential unrecognized attacks may be incipient or in progress. 
The simplest way to define an IDS is to describe it as a specialized tool that knows 
how to read and interpret the contents of log files from touters, firewalls, servers, and 
other network devices. Furthermore, an IDS often stores a database of known attack sig- 
natures and can compare patterns of activity, traffic, or behavior it sees in the logs it is 
monitoring against those signatures to recognize when a close match between a signa- 
ture and current or recent behavior occurs. At that point, the IDS can issue alarms or 
alerts, take various kinds of automatic action ranging from shutting down Internet links 
or specific servers to launching backtraces, and make other active attempts to identify 
attackers and actively collect evidence of their nefarious activities. 
By analogy, an IDS does for a network what an antivirus software package does for 
files that enter a system; it inspects the contents of network traffic to look for and deflect 
possible attacks. 
www.syngress.com 

164 
Chapter 3 • Network Devices 
To be more specific, intrusion detection means detecting unauthorized use of or 
attacks on a system or network. An IDS is designed and used to detect and then to 
deflect or deter (if possible) such attacks or unauthorized use of systems, networks, and 
related resources. Like firewalls, IDSs may be software-based or may combine hardware 
and software (in the form of preinstalled and preconfigured standalone IDS devices). 
Often, IDS software runs on the same devices or servers where firewalls, proxies, or 
other boundary services operate; an IDS not running on the same device or server 
where the firewall or other services are installed will monitor those devices closely and 
carefully. Although such devices tend to operate at network peripheries, IDS systems can 
detect and deal with insider attacks as well as external attacks. 
Other Devices and Technologies 
In addition to the security devices and other devices required for running a network, 
there are other devices that need to be considered when designing a network. Various 
devices are used to manage a network and provide additional features that make the net- 
work safer and more functional in day-to-day use. 
Gateways 
The term gateway has two meanings. First, a gateway is a bridge between two completely 
different technologies. For example, if you were to use an older IBM mainframe with the 
SNA (System Network Architecture) protocol running on it, and you want Windows 
clients to be able to print to it, you could facilitate the connection through a gateway. 
The term gateway can also refer to the path out of a network. In this case, a gateway 
is a computer on a LAN that provides an entrance or exit into another network. It can 
also be an Ethernet port on a router, where all requests are sent when no other path is 
known. For example, if you have a computer that tries to access an IP address that isn't 
on the LAN, the defaultgateway configured on that machine will be used to forward 
the request to a specific server or router. When the gateway receives this, it will attempt 
to resolve the address by passing the request to another network, such as another server 
or router on the Internet. In this regard, although servers are commonly associated with 
being the gateway for a network, other devices can perform these tasks. 
Gateways are used more and more in networking today because of the Internet.A 
gateway connects dissimilar systems. When UNIX wants to talk to NetWare, there must 
be a gateway for the two to communicate. A gateway is like a translator between two 
systems that are different from each other. The most common example of this is the 
Internet. Everyone who connects to the Internet, whether through a dial-up connection 
or through a LAN, must have a default gateway that his workstation points to. 
Gateways can also be used to link networks that have different protocols, such as 
TCP/IP to IPX/SPX.The gateway can change an entire protocol stack into another or 
provide protocol conversion and routing services between computer networks. Gateways 
examine the entire packet and then translate the incompatible protocols so that each 
www.syngress.com 

Network Devices • Chapter 3 
165 
network can understand the two different protocols. For example, protocol gateways can 
also be used to convert ATM cells to Frame Relay frames and vice versa. 
An example of an application based gateway can be seen with Microsoft's HIS 
(Host Integration Server) product, which used to be called Microsoft SNA Server. 
For more information visit www.microsoft.com/hiserver. 
Default Gateways and Subnetworks 
The default gateway is needed only for systems that are part of the local network. Data 
packets with a destination IP address not on the local subnet, nor elsewhere in the route 
table, are automatically forwarded to the default gateway. The default gateway is normally 
a computer system or router connected to the local subnet and other networks that 
knows the network IDs for other networks in the internetwork (the whole network) 
and the best path to reach them. Because the default gateway knows the network IDs of 
the other networks in the internetwork, it can forward the data packet to other gateways 
until the packet is ultimately delivered to a gateway connected to the intended destina- 
tion. However, if the default gateway becomes unavailable, the system cannot communi- 
cate outside its own subnet, except for with systems that it had established connections 
with prior to the failure. Since the default gateways are routers, they will either have to 
be adjusted manually, or~their routing protocols will learn of the downed segment and 
reconverge the network so that all routes for the downed segment are no longer avail- 
able--dynamically. 
Packets are routed to their destinations through routers and switches, and the 
routing tables used by them can be updated manually or dynamically. What gets the 
whole process rolling when we are routing packets to remote subnetworks, or subnets 
for short, is the use of the default gateway. The default gateway is what initially sends the 
packet on its way to the first router. When the packet reaches this first router, the router 
must determine if the destination computer is on the local network, or send the packet 
to the next router that will get the packet to its destination. 
If the default gateway becomes unavailable, data packets cannot reach their destina- 
tion. Multiple gateways can be used to prevent this from happening. However, if the 
default gateway becomes unavailable, the system cannot communicate outside of its own 
subnet. 
Voice and IP Telephony 
Voice and IP telephony refers to technologies that provide the ability to talk, fax or per- 
form other tasks that are commonly associated with Public Switched Telephone 

166 
Chapter 3 • Network Devices 
Networks. Telephony involves using the Internet Protocol's packet-switched connections 
to transfer voice and data communications. Using this technology, you can make local or 
long distance calls by having them sent as packets across the Internet, thereby avoiding 
the long distance phone charges that may be associated with the communication. 
Wireless 
Wireless networks require minimal cabling, as data is transmitted over the air using wire- 
less adapters and wireless routers. Computers using wireless NICs use a transceiver that 
sends and receives signals over the air to a wireless router or hub. The wireless router is 
an access point, providing a method of communication that the computers with wireless 
NICs can connect to. The router serves in this way as a wireless access point (WAP) that 
can support data transfer rates of up to 11 Mbps and can support up to 32 wireless 
devices. Because the wireless devices use radio frequency (1KF) transceivers, very little 
cabling is necessary on this type of network. 
NAS 
NAS is short for Network Attacked Storage, and is refers to devices that are dedicated to 
providing storage of data on the network. NAS uses hard disks for storage, but instead of 
being installed on a server, the storage device is accessed through its own network 
address. This lowers the amount of overhead required to serve clients who want to access 
data, because memory and resources aren't being used for other purposes. Files are 
accessed by clients because they are mapped to a server by the NAS file server software, 
but programs and files are served faster because they are accessed directly from the 
storage device. 
SANs 
As we discussed in Chapter 1, a SAN is short for Storage Area Network, which is a net- 
work that is dedicated to transmission of data between servers and storage devices. 
Storage devices are networked together on a segment of the network, so that computers 
on a LAN can view and store data on them. Devices that may be used for storage pur- 
poses can include RAID (Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks) arrays and NAS appli- 
ances, which we discussed in the previous section.

Media devices are a necessary part of a network, without which connectivity would be 
impossible. There are many devices that make up a network. Hubs are used to provide 
connectivity by passing from one port in the hub to the others, and thereby enabling data 
to move from one cable to another.An active hub takes this a step further by performing 
~
the role of a repeater, which is an older technology that takes data and regenerates it before 
resending it. In resending the data, the active hub will only send the data to the port that 
connects to the device the data is destined for. Another device called a MAU (Multistation 
Access Unit) is similar to this, in that it provides connectivity to a network, but is used on 
Token Ring networks. Bridges are another type of device that is used to connect two dif- 
ferent LANs, or segment a large LAN into two smaller halves. In discussing these devices, 
we found that some (hubs, repeaters, and bridges) are either obsolete or serve functions 
that can be performed by more modern devices like switches. 
In addition to devices on a LAN, we also discussed technologies that are used to 
connect to the Internet or acquire remote access to other computers. An analog modem 
is a communications device that enables a computer to talk to another computer 
!i!ii
through a standard telephone line. Other types of modems can also be used to connect 
.............
to the Internee, such as cable modems that use broadband technology, or DSL, which 
ilili
provides high-speed connections via the twisted-pair cabling of telephone lines. DSL has 
......... 
gained increasing popularity over the last few years, and has largely grown from another 
:iii~
technology called Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN), which provides 128Kbps 
connections over telephone lines. Faster methods of communication can also be 
i~i 
i!~ 
acquired using devices like CSU/DSU (Channel Service Unit / Data Service Unit), 
~iii i i! ! 
which provides an interface to T-carrier lines. 
Today's local area networks rely on a significant amount of equipment for security 
and connectivity. The primary device used on a network is the network interface card 
(NIC), which is an interface between computers, printers, and other devices and the 
........................
physical media on the network. The NIC transfers data to the cable, and retrieves it from 
................... 
the cable so the computer or other network device can then use it. Data on the network 
i 
may be forwarded to its proper destination using either a switch or a router. A switch 
takes data from a cable connected to its port, but unlike a hub that forwards the data 
through all of its other ports, a switch will forward the packet through a single port that 
leads to the computer that the data is intended for. Switches can also provide the func- 
tions of a router, which is used to route data packets across a network by opening the 
packet and making routing decisions based on the contents. 
Network security can be achieved through a variety of devices and concepts. 
Firewalls are used to secure an internal network from outside influence from a public 
.................... 
insecure network. Firewalls control the traffic that's sent from an external network, such 
i!ii!::!i!::!~.~:=~:::~j 
as the Internet, to an internal network or local computer using rules that are configured

some basic levels of protection against attacks. In addition to this, proxy servers can 
shield the origins of where data was sent from, as they act on behalf of other systems. 
By using these devices, your network is able to transfer data to other computers on the 
LAN and provide safe connectivity to external networks like the Internet. The function- 
ality of many of these devices is a requirement for a functional network, while others are 
enhancements that provide greater levels of security to your network environment.

Chapter 4 • Wireless Technologies 
Introduction to the Wireless Network 
Wireless networking has provided a new era of data connectivity unmatched by cabled 
networks. Increases in the speed of deployment, access to data, and scalability mean that 
the needs of specific user communities can be addressed in ways that were unavailable to 
network architects a few years ago. 
New streams of end user applications and services are being developed to provide 
businesses and consumers with advanced data access and manipulation. The main bene- 
fits of wireless integration will fall primarily into two major categories: 
• 
Convenience 
• 
Productivity 
Convenience 
First and foremost in the minds of IT professionals, business leaders, and end consumers 
when discussing wireless networking is the aspect of convenience. This basic benefit 
more or less outweighs all other benefits combined in terms of user interest in wireless, 
and is predominantly the main reason for their deployments. Convenience can be 
broken down into three areas of interest: 
• 
Flexibility 
• 
Roaming 
• 
Mobility 
Flexibility 
Wireless technologies provide the greatest flexibility of design, integration, and deploy- 
ment of any networking solution available. With only transceivers (wireless network 
adapters) to install in the local station and a wireless hub or access point (AP) to be con- 
figured for local access, it is simple to retrofit wireless networking within existing struc- 
tures, or to create access services where traditional networking infrastructures cannot go. 
With traditional networking infrastructures that mostly rely on copper or fiber optic 
cabling, a physical path is required between the access concentrator (a hub or switch) and 
each of the end users of the network. This means that a cabling run has to be created 
from one end of the network to the other for users to communicate with each other, 
whether they are using workstations or servers. 
Wired access drops are generally static in location in that the access is provided from 
a specified point that cannot easily be moved from one physical location to another. This 
also implies that if an existing access drop is in use, other users must wait their turn to 
gain access to the network if the next closest available drop is not conveniently located. 
The only other way to navigate this issue would be to install yet another concentrator

(hub or switch) so that more users can share that preexisting cable drop. Existing envi- 
ronments may not always be "new installation friendly". Many older buildings, houses, 
and apartments do not provide facilities for installing new cabling. In these environ- 
ments, building contractors and engineers may need to get involved to devise ways of 
running new cabling systems. When existing cable run facilities are available, they do not 
always offer the most optimum path between existing LAN (local area network) 
resources and new users. Security concerns also have to be addressed if a common 
wiring closet or riser is to be shared with other tenants. As such, the cost involved in 
installing new cabling can be prohibitive in terms of time, materials, or installation costs. 
Another factor involved in the installation of new cabling is loss of revenue due to 
the unavailability of facilities during the installation itself. Hotel chains, convention cen- 
ters, and airports stand to lose revenues during a cable installation retrofit project if a 
section of the building has to be closed off to customer access for safety reasons during 
the installation. 
Intangible costs have to be explored as well when investigating the installation of 
new cable runs. These include customer dissatisfaction and loss of customer goodwill 
during and after the retrofit project. 
With wireless networking, all that is required to create a new network is unrestricted 
radio wave access between end nodes and/or between an end node and a wireless AP 
within the vicinity of the end nodes. Radio waves can travel through walls, floors, and 
windows, which gives wireless network designers the flexibility to design wireless net- 
works and install APs where needed. This means that a wireless AP, when properly 
placed, can be used to support multiple user environments at the same time. 
An example of this in a wireless LAN configuration would consist of locating a 
wireless AP on the inside part of an eastern-facing exterior wall on the second floor of 
an office building. This one wireless AP could simultaneously serve the needs of a group 
of users on the eastern corner of the first floor, second floor, and third floor, along with 
those on the terrace located outside the first floor eastern corner. In this configuration, 
access is provided to users located on different floors inside and outside the building 
with a minimal commitment in terms of equipment and resources. 
Another example of a wireless LAN configuration would consist of providing net- 
working access within a large public area such as a library. In this scenario, properly 
placed APs could provide network coverage for the entire floor area without impacting 
the day-to-day use of the facilities. In addition, the APs could be located in an area of 
the library that has restricted access and is physically secure from daily activities. 
Roaming 
A wireless network access zone is an area of wireless network coverage. Compared to 
traditional wire-based networks, .a wireless user is not required to be located at a specific 
spot to gain access to the network, although the user must be in range of the AE A user 
can gain access to the wireless network provided he or she is within the area of wireless

Chapter 4 • Wireless Technologies 
coverage where the radio signal transmissions to and from the AP are of enough strength 
to support communications. For a more flexible and robust solution, you can organize 
multiple APs to overlap coverage in a single area, thus allowing users to roam seamlessly 
between APs without a loss of connection. With the always-on connectivity provided by 
wireless LANs, a roaming user is one that has the ability to: 
• 
Physically roam from one location to another within the wireless access zone. 
• 
Logically roam a session from one wireless AP to another. 
When discussing physical roaming, we would include both the movement of a user 
within a single AP's wireless network access zone or within the combined network 
access zones for all the APs that are part of this network. 
When discussing logical roaming we refer to the transference of a networking ses- 
sion from one wireless AP to another without the need for any user interaction during 
the session reassociation process. When a user moves from one wireless AP's area of cov- 
erage to another AP's area of coverage, the user's transmission signal strength is assessed. 
As the signal reaches a threshold, the user credentials are carried over from the old 
"home base" AP to the new "home base" AP using a session token or other transparent 
authentication scheme. 
This combination of physical and logical roaming allows users to keep data sessions 
active as they move freely around the area of coverage. This is of great benefit to users 
who require maintaining a data session with networked resources as they move about a 
building or facility. 
An example of this would be an internal technical service agent. In their day-to-day 
activities, these agents may be called upon to service end stations where access to tech- 
nical troubleshooting databases, call tickets, and other support resources may be required. 
By having access to these services over the wireless network, the technicians can move 
from one call ticket to another without being forced to reconnect to the wire line net- 
work as they move about. Another benefit to maintaining an always-on session is that 
they could provide live updates to the ticketing databases or order replacement supplies 
at the time of service. 
Next, we take a look at a senior manager who is attending a status meeting in a 
conference room where a limited number of data ports will be available to access e-mail, 
databases, and other information stores. If this manager had access to wireless networking 
capabilities on their laptop, he or she could maintain a connection to the same services 
that are available at the local desktop. Real-time reports with up-to-the-minute metrics 
on business activities and critical information flows could be accessed more efficiently. 
The road to the top might actually be a little simpler. 
As we mentioned earlier, the lack of wire lines provides the network architect with 
the ability to design networking solutions that are available anytime and anywhere 
through always-on connectivity. As noted in the previous examples, any networking 
solution using traditional wire line media would hit a hard limitation when exposed to 

Wireless Technologies • Chapter 4 
183 
the same requirements of access coverage. The costs in cabling materials alone would 
preclude any such contemplation. 
Mobility 
The last concept dealing with convenience is that of mobility. This benefit alone is often 
the biggest factor in an organization's decision to go for a wireless-based networking 
solution. 
In traditional wire-line networking environments, once a cabling infrastructure is set 
in place, rarely does it move with tenants when they leave to a new facility or area of a 
building. Cabling installations are considered part of the cost of the move and are essen- 
tially tossed out. 
With a wireless networking environment, the wireless APs can be unplugged from 
the electrical outlet and re-deployed in the new facility. Very few cables, if any, are left 
behind as a going away present to the building owner. This allows the network architects 
to reuse networking equipment as required to address the networking realities of each 
environment. 
For example, it is possible to move part or all of a network from one functional area 
to another or from one building to another. This facilitates the job of IT managers who 
are constantly faced with network resource rationalizations and optimizations such as the 
decommissioning of access ports, or the moving of equipment and personnel from one 
area to another.

when items such as Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), frequency-hopping spread

ground on wireless technologies. Even though this is not a wireless test, wire- 
less technologies are spreading in use so quickly.., it would be a career-limiting 
move not to understand the fundamentals. 
Productivity 
The net result of the increased level of flexibility, mobility, and convenience provided 
through wireless networking is increased productivity. Networked resources can become 
accessible from any location, thus providing the ability to design and integrate environ- 
ments where users and services can be located where best suited. Wireless networking 
can provide opportunities for higher levels of service and productivity unmatched 
through cabled networking.

Radio Frequency and 
Antenna Behaviors and Characteristics 
Before actually getting into the specifications and standards that define how wireless net- 
works are constructed and operate, one must first have a good understanding of basic 
radio frequency (RF) behaviors and antenna characteristics. In the following sections, we 
will briefly examine these topics. 
Radio Frequency Behaviors 
The following radio frequency behaviors are important in your basic understanding of 
how wireless networks operate and interact with their environments. 
Gain and Loss 
Gain occurs when a signal has its strength increased, such as by passing through an 
amplifier. As you can see in the left-hand side of Figure 4.1, the lower wave represents 
the signal before passing through the amplifier and the higher wave represents the signal 
after passing through the amplifier. The difference in amplitudes between both signal 
strengths is the gain. 
Loss is the exact opposite of gain, and occurs when a signal has its strength decreased, 
either intentionally through the use of a device such as an attenuator, or unintentionally 
such as through resistance losses in a transmission cable. As you can see in the right-hand 
side of Figure 4.1, the higher wave represents the pre-loss signal strength and the lower 
wave represents the wave signal strength after the loss has occurred.

Reflection and Refraction 
Some 1KF behaviors are similar to those of light waves, such as in the case of reflection 
and refraction. As you can see in the left-hand side of Figure 4.2, reflection has occurred 
because our electromagnetic radio frequency wave has impacted upon a surface that has 
a much larger cross-section than that of the wave itself. Many things cause reflection, 
such as doors, walls, floors, ceilings, buildings, and the curvature of the Earth to name a 
few. Assuming that the surface being impacted is relatively fiat and smooth, a large 
majority of the original signal will be reflected off at a different angle than the entry 
signal. Some signal will be lost due to absorption and scattering (discussed later in this 
chapter). Surfaces that are less smooth or fiat will cause a larger percentage of the orig- 
inal wave to be lost. 
The right-hand side of Figure 4.2 depicts the behavior known as refraction.You've 
probably seen refraction for yourself if you've ever looked at a lake or pool of water. 
Refraction is a particular problem for long-range outdoor point-to-point links due to 
changing atmospheric conditions, notably differing air densities due to changes in air 
temperature. When a wave is refracted, it passes through a medium and changes course 
with some of the original wave being reflected away from the original wave's path. The 
longer an outdoor link is, the larger problem refraction could present. 
Figure 4.2 Comparing Reflection and Refraction 
Absorption and Scattering 
As disruptive as reflection and refraction are, absorption and scattering can absolutely 
destroy an electromagnetic signal wave and prevent it from reaching its intended destina- 
tion. At least with reflection and refraction, the signal could still be received by the AP 
by chance. 
As you can see in the left-hand side of Figure 4.3, the IKF signal has been completely 
absorbed because it has impacted an object that does not pass it on through any means 
(reflection or refraction). In this case, no signal is left and the data contained in it is lost. 
The right-hand side of Figure 4.3 depicts the behavior known as scattering. If you've 
ever played billiards, then you are undoubtedly familiar with this behavior. When an 
incoming electromagnetic wave hits a surface that is small compared to its wavelength, 
www.syngress.com 

186 
Chapter 4 • Wireless Technologies 
scattering will occur. This is the exact opposite of the effect of reflection. The resultant 
effect causes many lower magnitude waves to be sent off at various angles relative to the 
path of the original wave. Another practical example of scattering is the effect on satel- 
lite television during a heavy rain or snow storm; the incoming signal is degraded, and 
in some cases, completely destroyed, before arriving at the intended destination. Typical 
sources of scattering include trees, street signs and atmospheric conditions. 
Figure 4.3 Comparing Absorption and Scattering 
fl 
Scattering 
Antenna Characteristics 
Since antennas are a key element of any electromagnetic wave-based system, including 
wireless networks, you should also have a good understanding of some basic antenna 
concepts. We'll examine the concepts of line of sight (LOS) and the Fresnel Zone in the 
next figure. 
An antenna, by its very design, is an amplification device. There need be no specific 
manipulation of the incoming signal to cause amplification to occurmthis is a result of 
the shape of the antenna itself. When 1LF energy is tightly focused into a smaller beam, 
it becomes amplified. Different antenna types cause different shapes of output signals, 
and thus different amounts of amplification. 
Line of Sight and Fresnel Zone 
Figure 4.4 illustrates another similarity that electromagnetic waves share with light waves - 
the visual line of sight. With light waves, if a straight line exists, it's implied that the line of 
sight exists. Once you have LOS, the light waves will be able to travel from point to point. 
The same basic concept holds true with 1LF waves, with one exception; ILF waves are also 
subject to a phenomenon known as the Fresnel Zone (pronounced "frah-nell").

When dealing with optics, visual line of sight is enough to ensure good signal trans- 
mission from point to point. With electromagnetic waves, this is not entirely true. 
Objects that extend into the Fresnel Zone, an elliptical region extending outward from 
the visual LOS, can cause signal loss through the methods we examined previously such 
as reflection, refraction and scattering. 
The actual mathematic processes needed to calculate the width of the Fresnel Zone 
at its widest point is not important to know here. The key thing to take away from this 
discussion is that blockage of 20% or more of the Fresnel Zone can begin to cause RF 
signal loss from source to destination. Many common objects that can be encountered in 
a point-to-point link can cause Fresnel Zone blockage, including buildings and trees. To 
overcome any blockage you must either remove the object causing the blockage or raise 
one or both antennas in the link.

Wireless Network Concepts 
This section covers some of the most popular wireless technologies used today for wire- 
less networking. In the past five years, two wireless network technologies have seen con- 
siderable deployment: Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) networks and Wireless Local 
Area Network (WLAN) networks based on the Institute of Electrical and Electronic 
Engineers (IEEE) 802.11 specification. While these are not the only wireless networking 
technologies available, they are the most popular and must be understood to pass the 
wireless objectives on the Network+ certification exam.

Chapter 4 • Wireless Technologies 
Overview of Wireless 
Communication in a Wireless Network 
Wireless networks, like their wired counterparts, rely on the manipulation of an elec- 
trical charge to enable communication between devices. Changes or oscillations in signal 
strength from zero to some maximum value (amplitude) and the rate of those oscilla- 
tions (frequency) are used singularly or in combination with each other to encode and 
decode information. 
Two devices can communicate with each other when they understand the 
method(s) used to encode and decode information contained in the changes to the elec- 
trical properties of the conununications medium being used. A network adapter can 
decode changes in the electric current it senses on a wire and convert them to mean- 
ingful information (bits) that can subsequently be sent to higher levels for processing. 
Likewise, a network adapter can encode information (bits) by manipulating the proper- 
ties of the electric current for transmission on the communications medium (in the case 
of wired networks, this would be the cable). 
Radio Frequency Communications 
The primary difference between wired and wireless networks is that wireless networks use 
a special type of electric current known as radio frequency, which is created by applying 
alternating current (AC) to an antenna to produce an electromagnetic field (EM). Devices 
for broadcasting and reception use the resulting P,.F field. In the case of wireless networks, 
the medium for communications is the EMfield, the region of space that is influenced by 
electromagnetic radiation. Unlike audio waves, radio waves do not require a medium such 
as air or water to propagate. As with wired networks, amplitude decreases with distance, 
resulting in the degradation of signal strength and the ability to communicate. However, 
the EM field is also dispersed according to the properties of the transmitting antenna, and 
not tightly bound, as is the case with communication over a wire. 
Like the waves created by throwing a rock into a pool of water, radio waves are 
affected by the presence of obstructions and can be reflected, refracted, diffracted, or 
scattered, depending on the properties of the obstruction and its interaction with the 
radio waves. Reflected radio waves can be a source of interference on wireless networks. 
The interference created by bounced radio waves is called multipath inteoCerence. 
When radio waves are reflected, additional wave fronts are created. These different 
wave fronts may arrive at the receiver at different times and be in phase or out of phase 
with the main signal. When the peak of a wave is added to another wave (in phase), the 
wave is amplified. When the peak of a wave meets a trough (out of phase), the wave is 
effectively cancelled. Multipath interference can be the source of hard-to-troubleshoot 
problems. In planning for a wireless network, administrators should consider the pres- 
ence of common sources of multipath interference. These include metal doors, metal 
roofs, water, metal vertical blinds, and any other source that is highly reflective to radio 

Wireless Technologies • Chapter 4 
189 
waves. Antennas may help to compensate for the effects of multipath interference, but 
must be carefully chosen. Many wireless access points have two antennas for precisely 
this purpose. However, a single omnidirectional antenna may be of no use at all for this 
kind of interference. 
Another source of signal loss is the presence of obstacles. While radio waves can 
travel through physical objects, they are degraded according to the properties of the 
object they travel through. For example, a window is fairly transparent to radio waves, 
but may reduce the effective range of a wireless network by between 50 percent and 70 
percent, depending on the presence and nature of the coatings on the glass. A solid core 
wall can reduce the effective range of a wireless network by up to 90 percent or greater. 
EM fields are also prone to interference and signal degradation by the presence of 
other EM fields. In particular, 802.11 wireless networks are prone to interference produced 
by cordless phones, microwave ovens, and a wide range of devices that use the same unli- 
censed Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) or Unlicensed National Information 
Infrastructure (UNII) bands.To mitigate the effects of interference from these devices and 
other sources of electromagnetic interference, RF-based wireless networks employ spread 
spectrum technologies. Spread spectrum provides a way to "share" bandwidth with other 
devices that may be operating in the same frequency range. Rather than operating on a 
single, dedicated frequency such as is the case with radio and television broadcasts, wireless 
networks use a "spectrum" of frequencies for communication. 
Spread Spectrum Technology 
Conceived of by Hedy Lamarr and George Antheil in 1940 as a method of securing 
military communications from jamming and for eavesdropping during WWII, spread 
spectrum defines methods for wireless devices to use to send a number of narrowband 
frequencies over a range of frequencies simultaneously for communication. The narrow- 
band frequencies used between devices change according to a random-appearing, but 
defined pattern, allowing individual frequencies to contain parts of the transmission. 
Someone listening to a transmission using spread spectrum would hear only noise, unless 
his or her own device understood in advance what frequencies were used for the trans- 
mission and could synchronize with them. 
Two methods of synchronizing wireless devices are: 
• 
Frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) 
• 
Direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS)

WARNING 
Make sure that you pay close attention to the next couple of sections in this 
chapter, as they directly relate to the exam. Most of what you learned to this 
point was background information to get you to the point where you can 
understand FHSS and DHSS. Make sure you study the next sections carefully.

Chapter 4 • Wireless Technologies 
Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum 
As the name implies, FHSS works by quickly moving from one frequency to another 
according to a pseudorandom pattern. The frequency range used by the frequency hop is 
relatively large (83.5 MHz), providing excellent protection from interference. The 
amount of time spent on any given frequency is known as dwell time and the amount of 
time it takes to move from one frequency to another is known as hop time. FHSS 
devices begin their transmission on one frequency and move to other frequencies 
according to a pre-defined pseudorandom sequence and then repeat the sequence after 
reaching the final frequency in the pattern. Hop time is usually very short (200 to 300 
ms) and not significant relative to the dwell time (100 to 200 ms). In general, the longer 
the dwell time, the greater the throughput and the more susceptible the transmission is 
to narrowband interference. 
........ ~iiiil 
...... ~iii!iiiiiiiiiii!!! 
 bTE 
One MHz represents one mi,,ion cyc,es per second T,e speed of microproces- 
ii iiiii!iiiiii sors, called the clock speed, is measured in megahertz. For example, a micro- 
iiiiiiiiiiiiiii processor that runs at 200 MHz executes 200 million cycles per second. Each 
...... %iilii computer instruction requires a fixed number of cycles, so the clock speed 
determines how many instructions per second the microprocessor can execute. 
To a large degree, this controls how powerful the microprocessor is. Another 
chief factor in determining a microprocessor's power is its data width (that is, 
how many bits it can manipulate at one time). 
In addition to microprocessors, the speeds of buses and interfaces are also 
measured in MHz. 
The frequency hopping sequence creates a channel, allowing multiple channels to 
coexist in the same frequency range without interfering with each other. As many as 79 
FCC-compliant FHSS devices using the 2.4 GHz ISM band can be co-located together. 
However, the expense of implementing such a large number of systems limits the prac- 
tical number of co-located devices to well below this number. Wireless networks that 
use FHSS include HomeRF and Bluetooth, which both operate in the unlicensed 2.4 
GHz ISM band. FHSS usually operates at lower rates of data transmission (usually 1.6 
Mbps, but as high as 10 Mbps) than networks that use DSSS. 
Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum 
• 
. 
DSSS works somewhat differently than FHSS. With DSSS, the data is divided and simul- 
taneously transmitted on as many frequencies as possible within a particular frequency 
band (the channel). DSSS adds redundant bits of data known as chips to the data to rep- 
resent binary 0s or l s. The ratio of chips-to-data is known as the spreading ratio" the 
higher the ratio, the more immune to interference the signal is, because if part of the 

Wireless Technologies • Chapter 4 
191 
transmission is corrupted, the data can still be recovered from the remaining part of the 
chipping code. This method provides greater rates of transmission than FHSS, which uses 
a limited number of frequencies, but fewer channels in a given frequency range. 
Additionally, DSSS protects against data loss through the redundant, simultaneous trans- 
mission of data. However, because DSSS floods the channel it is using, it is also more 
vulnerable to interference from EM devices operating in the same range. In the 2.4 to 
2.4835 GHz frequency range employed by 802.11b, DSSS transmissions can be broad- 
cast in any one of fourteen 22 MHz-wide channels. The number of center-channel fre- 
quencies used by 802.11 DSSS devices depends on the physical location. For example, 
North America allows eleven channels operating in the 2.4 to 2.4835 GHz range, 
Europe allows thirteen, and Japan allows one. Because each channel is 22 MHz wide, the 
channels may overlap each other. Of the eleven available channels in North America, 
only a maximum of three (1, 6, and 11) may be used concurrently without the use of 
overlapping frequencies. 
i~ OTE 
When comparing FHSS and DSSS technologies, it should be noted that FHSS 
networks are not inherently more secure than DSSS networks, contrary to pop- 
ular belief. Even if the relatively few manufacturers of FHSS devices were not to 
, publish the hopping sequence used by their devices, a sophisticated hacker 
armed with a spectrum analyzer and a computer could easily determine this 
information and eavesdrop on the communications.

Wireless Network Architecture 
The seven-layer open systems interconnect (OSI) networking model defines the frame- 
work for implementing network protocols. The OSI model will be covered in depth in 
chapter 5. Wireless networks operate at the physical and data link layers of the OSI 
model. The physical layer is concerned with the physical connections between devices, 
such as how the medium and low bits (0s and ls) are encoded and decoded. Both FHSS 
and DSSS are implemented at the physical layer. The data link layer is divided into two 
sublayers; the media access control (MAC) and logical link control (LLC) layers. 
The MAC layer is responsible for such things as:

CSMA/CD and CSMA/CA 
In contrast to Ethernet 802.3 networks, wireless networks defined by the 802.11 stan- 
dard do not use CSMA/CD as a method to protect against data loss resulting from colli- 
sions. Instead, 802.11 networks use a method known as Carrier Sense Multiple Access 
with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA). CSMA/CD works by detecting whether a col- 
lision has occurred on the network and then retransmitting the data in the event of such 
an occurrence. However, this method is not practical for wireless networks because it 
relies on the fact that every workstation can hear all the other workstations on a cable 
segment to determine if there is a collision. 
In wireless networks, usually only the AP can hear every workstation that is communi- 
cating with it (for example, workstations A and B may be able to communicate with the 
same AE but may be too far apart from each other to hear their respective transmissions). 
Additionally, wireless networks do not use full-duplex communication, which is another 
way of protecting data against corruption and loss as a result of collisions.

....... ~iii!ii~iii~ confusion with the Wireless Application Protocol (also known as WAP). 
CSMA/CA solves the problem of potential collisions on the wireless network by 
taking a more active approach than CSMA/CD, which kicks in only after a collision has 
been detected. Using CSMA/CA, a wireless workstation first tries to detect if any other 
device is communicating on the network. If it senses it is clear to send, it initiates com- 
munication. The receiving device sends an acknowledgment (ACK) packet to the trans- 
mitting device indicating successful reception. If the transmitting device does not receive 
an ACK, it assumes a collision has occurred and retransmits the data. However, it should 

Wireless Technologies • Chapter 4 
193 
be noted that many collisions can occur and that these collisions can be used to com- 
promise the confidentiality of Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) encrypted data. 
CSMA/CA is only one way in which wireless networks differ from wired networks 
in their implementation at the MAC layer. For example, the IEEE standard for 802.11 at 
the MAC layer defines additional functionality, such as virtual collision detection 
(VCD), roaming, power saving, asynchronous data transfer, and encryption. 
The fact that the WEP protocol is defined at the MAC layer is particularly note- 
worthy and has significant consequences for the security of wireless networks. This 
means that data at the higher levels of the OSI model, particularly Transmission Control 
Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) data, is also encrypted. Because much of the 
TCP/IP communications that occur between hosts contain a large amount of frequently 
repeating and well-known patterns, WEP may be vulnerable to known plaintext attacks, 
although it does include safeguards against this kind of attack.

Wireless Network Protocols and Operation 
Wireless local area networks (WLANs) are covered by the IEEE 802.11 standards. The 
purpose of these standards is to provide a wireless equivalent to IEEE 802.3 Ethernet- 
based networks. The IEEE 802.3 standard defines a method for dealing with collisions 
(CSMA/CD), speeds of operation (10 Mbps, 100 Mbps, and faster), and cabling types 
(Category 5 twisted pair and fiber). The standard ensures the interoperability of various 
devices despite different speeds and cabling types. 
As with the 802.3 standard, the 802.11 standard defines methods for dealing with 
collision and speeds of operation. However, because of the differences in the media (air 
as opposed to wires), the devices being used, the potential mobility of users connected 
to the network, and the possible wireless network topologies, the 802.11 standard differs 
significantly from the 802.3 standard. As mentioned earlier, 802.11 networks use 
CSMA/CA as the method to deal with potential collisions, instead of the CSMA/CD 
used by Ethernet networks, because not all stations on a wireless network can hear colli- 
sions that occur on a network. 
In addition to providing a solution to the problems created by collisions that occur 
on a wireless network, the 802.11 standard must deal with other issues specific to the 
nature of wireless devices and wireless communications in general. For example, wireless 
devices have to be able to locate other wireless devices, such as APs, and communicate 
with them. Wireless users are mobile and therefore should be able to move seamlessly 
www.syngress.corn

Chapter 4 • Wireless Technologies 
from one wireless zone to another. Many wireless-enabled devices such as laptops and 
hand-held computers use battery power and should be able to conserve power when 
not actively communicating with the network. Wireless communication over the air has 
to be secure to mitigate both passive and active attacks. 
WAP 
The WAP is an open specification designed to enable mobile wireless users to easily 
access and interact with information and services. WAP is designed for hand-held digital 
wireless devices such as mobile phones, pagers, two-way radios, smartphones, and other 
communicators. It works over most wireless networks and can be built on many oper- 
ating systems (OSs) including PalmOS, Windows CE, JavaOS, and others. The WAP 
operational model is built on the World Wide Web (WWW) programming model with 
a few enhancements and is shown in Figure 4.5.

WAP browsers in a wireless client are analogous to the standard WWW browsers on

traditional networks and are also used to identify local resources in the WAP-enabled 
client. The WAP specification added two significant enhancements to the above pro- 
gramming model: push and telephony support (Wireless Telephony Application [WTA]). 
WAP also provides for the use of proxy servers, as well as supporting servers that provide 
functions such as PKI support, user profile support, and provisioning support.

WTLS 
Wireless Transport Layer Security (WTLS) is an attempt by the WAP Forum to intro- 
duce a measure of security into WAP. The WTLS protocol is based on the Transport 
Layer Security (TLS) protocol that is itself a derivative of the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 
protocol. However, several changes were made to these protocols to adapt them to work 
within WAP. These changes include: 
• 
Support for both datagram and connection-oriented protocols 
• 
Support for long round-trip times 
• 
Low-bandwidth, limited memory, and processor capabilities 
WTLS is designed to provide privacy as well as reliability for both the client and the 
server over an unsecured network and is specific to applications that utilize WAP. These 
applications tend to be limited by memory, processor capabilities, and low bandwidth 
environments.

IEEE 802.11 
The original IEEE 802.11 standard was developed in 1989 and defines the operation of 
wireless networks operating in the 2.4 GHz range using either DSSS or FHSS at the 
physical layer of the OSI model. This standard also defines the use of infrared for wireless 
communication. The intent of the standard is to provide a wireless equivalent for stan- 
dards, such as 802.3, that are used for wired networks. DSSS devices that follow the 
802.11 standard communicate at speeds of 1 Mbps and 2 Mbps and generally have a 
range of approximately 300 feet. Because of the need for higher rates of data transmis- 
sion and to provide more functionality at the MAC layer, the 802.11 Task Group devel- 
oped other standards (in some cases the 802.11 standards were developed from 
technologies that preceded them). 
The IEEE 802.11 standard provides for all the necessary definitions and constructs 
for wireless networks. Everything from the physical transmission specifications to the 
authentication negotiation is defined by this standard. Wireless traffic, like its wired 
counterpart, consists of frames transmitted from one station to another. The primary fea- 
ture that sets wireless networks apart from wired networks is that at least one end of the 
communication pair is either a wireless client or a wireless AP. 

196 
Chapter 4 • Wireless Technologies 
IEEE 8 02.1 l b 
The most common standard used today for wireless networks, the IEEE 802.1 l b stan- 
dard, defines DSSS networks that use the 2.4 GHz ISM band and communicate at 
speeds of 1, 2, 5.5, and 11 Mbps. The 802.11b standard defines the operation of only 
DSSS devices and is backward compatible with 802.11 DSSS devices. The standard is 
also concerned only with the physical and MAC layers: layer 3 and higher protocols are 
considered payload. There is only one frame type used by 802.1 l b networks, and it is 
significantly different from Ethernet frames. The 802.1 l b frame type has a maximum 
length of 2346 bytes, although it is often fragmented at 1518 bytes as it traverses an AP 
to communicate with Ethernet networks. The frame type provides for three general cat- 
egories of frames: management, control, and data. In general, the frame type provides 
methods for wireless devices to discover, associate (or disassociate), and authenticate with 
one another; to shift data rates as signals become stronger or weaker; to conserve power 
by going into sleep mode; to handle collisions and fragmentation; and to enable encryp- 
tion through WEE Regarding WEP, it should be noted that the standard defines the use 
of only 64-bit (also sometimes referred to as 40-bit to add to the confusion) encryption, 
which may cause issues of interoperability between devices from different vendors that 
use 128-bit or higher encryption. 
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiil 
Remember that IEEE 802.11 b functions up to 11 Mbps in the ISM band. 
IEEE 802.1 l a 
In spite of its nomenclature, IEEE 802.11a is a more recent standard than 802.11b. This 
standard defines wireless networks that use the 5 GHz UNII bands. 802.1 l a supports 
much higher rates of data transmission than 802.11b.These rates are 6, 9, 12, 16, 18, 24, 36, 
48, and 54 Mbps, although higher rates are possible using proprietary technology and a 
technique known as rate doubling. Unlike 802.11b, 802.1 l a does not use spread spectrum 
and Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) as a modulation technique at the physical 
layer. Instead, it uses a modulation technique known as Orthogonal Frequency Division 
Multiplexing (OFDM).To be 802.11a compliant, devices are only required to support data 
rates of 6, 12, and 24 Mbps~the standard does not require the use of other data rates. 
Although identical to 802.1 l b at the MAC layer, 802.11a is not backward compat- 
ible with 802.11b because of the use of a different frequency band and the use of 
OFDM at the physical layer, although some vendors are providing solutions to bridge 
the two standards at the AP. However, both 802.1 l a and 802.1 l b devices can be easily 
co-located because their frequencies will not interfere with each other, providing a tech- 
nically easy, but relatively expensive migration to a pure 802.11a network. At the time of 
www.syngress.com 

Wireless Technologies • Chapter 4 
197 
this writing, 802.1 l a-compliant devices are becoming more common, and the prices for 
them are falling quickly. However, even if the prices for 802.11b and 802.1 l a devices 
were identical, 802.1 l a would require more APs and would therefore be more expensive 
than an 802.11b network to achieve the highest possible rates of data transmission, 
because the higher frequency 5 GHz waves attenuate more quickly over distance. 
M WARNING 
Remember that IEEE 802.1 la functions up to 54 Mbps in the UNII band. 
IEEE 802.1 l g 
To provide both higher data rates (up to 54 Mbps) in the ISM 2.4 GHz bands and back- 
ward compatibility with 802.1 lb, the IEEE 802.11 g Task Group members along with 
wireless vendors introduced the 802.1 l g standard specifications. To achieve the higher 
rates of transmission, 802.11g devices use OFDM in contrast to QPSK, which is used by 
802.1 l b devices as a modulation technique. However, 802.1 l g devices are able to auto- 
matically switch to QPSK to communicate with 802.11b devices. 802.11g has advan- 
tages over 802.11a in terms of providing backward compatibility with 802.11b; however, 
migrating to and co-existence with 802.11b may still prove problematic because of 
crowding in the widely used 2.4 GHz band. 
~M WARNING

Remember that IEEE 802.1 lg functions up to 54 Mbps in the ISM band. 
Ad-Hoc and Infrastructure Network Configuration 
The 802.11 standard provides for two modes for wireless clients to communicate: ad- 
hoc and infrastructure. The ad-hoc mode is geared for a network of stations within 
communication range of each other. Ad-hoc networks are created spontaneously 
between the network participants. In infrastructure mode, APs provide more permanent 
structure for the network. An infrastructure consists of one or more APs as well as a dis- 
tribution system (that is, a wired network) behind the APs that tie the wireless network 
to the wired network. Figures 4.6 and 4.7 show an ad-hoc network and an infrastruc- 
ture network, respectively.

To distinguish different wireless networks from one another, the 802.11 standard 
defines the Service Set Identifier (SSID).The SSID is considered the identity element 
that "glues" various components of a wireless local area network (LAN) together. Traffic 
from wireless clients that use one SSID can be distinguished from other wireless traffic

frames that carry data, which is typically considered network traffic, such as Internet 
Protocol (IP) encapsulated frames.

IEEE 802.15 (Bluetooth) 
Bluetooth uses the same 2.4 GHz frequency that the IEEE 802.11b and 802.11g wire- 
less networks use, but unlike those networks, Bluetooth can select from up to 79 dif- 
ferent frequencies within a radio band. Unlike 802.11 networks where the wireless 
client can only be associated with one network at a time, Bluetooth networks allow 
clients to be connected to seven networks at the same time. Bluetooth devices typically 
have a maximum useable range of about 10 meters (33 feet). 
Bluetooth, by its very design, is not intended for the long ranges or high data 
throughput rates that 802.11 wireless networks have. This is largely due to the fact that 
the hop rate of Bluetooth devices is about 1600 hops per second with an average of a 
625ms dwell time, thus producing exceptionally more management overhead than 
802.11. While this exceptionally high hop rate does tend to make Bluetooth resistant to 
narrow band interference, it has the undesirable side effect of causing disruption of other 
2.4 GHz-based network technologies, such as 802.11b and 802.11g. This high hop rate 
causes all-band interference on these 802.11 networks and can, in some cases, com- 
pletely prevent an 802.11 wireless network from functioning. 
Infrared 
Infrared, unlike 802.11 and 802.15, is not a standard itself, but rather is the focus of the 
~ 
Infrared Data Association (IrDA). The IrDA was founded in 1993 as a member-funded

Chapter 4 • Wireless Technologies 
organization whose primary function is to create and promote a standardized data trans- 
mission mechanism using infrared light. Infrared data transmission has been used for 
many applications in a non-nonstandard manner by Hewlett Packard calculators and 
printers. Now, most PDAs (personal digital assistants) and almost all portable computers 
do or can have infrared capabilities. 
Infrared devices typically can achieve a maximum data throughput of 4 Mbps, but as 
it is a light-based technology, it is susceptible to light-based interference and the typical 
data throughput you can expect is around 100-125 Kbps. Also, since infrared is a light- 
based technology, it does not interfere in any way with 1KF-based wireless technologies. 
By that same token, infrared is a fairly secure technology in that an attacker would have 
to be in the direct path of the transmission, which is typically not very likely given the 
low power and low transmission range of infrared--the best theoretical outdoor distance 
you can get out of infrared is about 3280 feet (1000 meters), and this maximum drops 
off significantly with the presence of any other form of light. 
WEP 
The IEEE 802.11 standard covers the communication between WLAN components. ILF 
poses challenges to privacy in that it travels through and around physical objects. 
Because of the nature of the 802.11 wireless LANs, the IEEE working group imple- 
mented a mechanism to protect the privacy of the individual transmissions, known as 
the WEP protocol. Because WEP utilizes a cryptographic security countermeasure for 
the fulfillment of its stated goal of privacy, it has the added benefit of becoming an 
authentication mechanism. This benefit is realized through a shared-key authentication 
that allows for encryption and decryption of wireless transmissions. Up to four keys can 
be defined on an AP or a client, and they can be rotated to add complexity for a higher 
security standard in the WLAN policy. 
WEP was never intended to be the absolute authority in wireless security. The IEEE 
802.11 standard states that WEP provides for protection from "casual eavesdropping." 
Instead, the driving force behind WEP was privacy. In cases that require high degrees of 
security, other mechanisms should be utilized such as authentication, access control, pass- 
word protection, and virtual private networks (VPNs). 
Despite its flaws, WEP still offers a level of security provided that all its features are 
used properly. This means taking great care in key management, avoiding default options, 
and ensuring adequate encryption is enabled at every opportunity. 
Proposed improvements in the 802.11 standard should overcome many of the limi- 
tations of the original security options, and should make WEP more appealing as a secu- 
rity solution. Additionally, as WLAN technology gains popularity and users clamor for 
functionality, both the standards committees and the hardware vendors will offer 
improvements. It is critically important to keep abreast of vendor-related software fixes 
and changes that improve the overall security posture of a wireless LAN.

.... 
Most APs advertise that they support WEP in 40-bit encryption, but often the 
128-bit option is also supported. For corporate networks, 128-bit 
encryption-capable devices should be considered as a minimum. 
With data security enabled in a closed network, the settings on the client for the 
SSID and the encryption keys must match the AP when attempting to associate with 
the network or it will fail. The next few paragraphs discuss WEP and its relation to the 
functionality of" the 802.11 standard, including a standard definition of WEE the privacy 
created, and the authentication. 
WEP provides security and privacy in transmissions held between the AP and the 
clients. To gain access, an intruder must be more sophisticated and have specific intent to 
gain access. Some of the other benefits of implementing WEP include the following: 
• 
All messages are encrypted using a CRC-32 checksum to provide some degree 
of integrity. 
• 
Privacy~is maintained via the I:LC4 encryption. Without possession of the 
secret key, the message cannot be easily decrypted. 
• 
WEP is extremely easy to implement. All that is required is to set the encryp- 
tion key on the APs and on each client. 
• 
WEP provides a basic level of security for WLAN applications. 
• 
WEP keys are user-definable and unlimited. WEP keys can, and should, be 
changed often. 
WARNING 
Do not confuse WAP and WER While it may seem that WEP is the privacy 
system for WAP, you should remember that WTLS is the privacy mechanism for 
WAP and WEP is the privacy mechanism for 802.11 WLANs. 
Creating Privacy with WEP 
WEP provides for three implementations: no encryption, 40-bit encryption, and 128-bit 
encryption. Clearly, no encryption means no privacy. When WEP is set to no encryption, 
transmissions are sent in the clear and can be viewed by any wireless sniffing application 
that has access to the RF signal propagated in the WLAN, unless some other encryption 
mechanism such as IPsec (IP Security) is being used. In the case of the 40- and 128-bit 
varieties Oust as with password length), the greater the number of characters (bits), the

stronger the encryption. The initial configuration of the AP includes the setup of the 
shared key. This shared key can be in the form of either alphanumeric or hexadecimal 
strings, and must be matched on the client. 
WEP uses the RC4 encryption algorithm, a stream cipher developed by Ron Rivest 
(the "R" in RSA). The process by which WEP encrypts a message is shown in Figure 
4.8. Both the sender and the receiver use the stream cipher to create identical pseudo- 
random strings from a known shared key. This process entails having the sender logically 
XOR (exclusive OR) the plaintext transmission with the stream cipher to produce 
ciphertext. The receiver takes the shared key and identical stream and reverses the pro- 
cess to gain the plaintext transmission. 
The steps in the process are as follows: 
1. 
The plaintext message is run through an integrity check algorithm (the 802.11 
standard specifies the use of CRC-32) to produce an integrity check value 
(ICV). 
2. 
This value is appended to the end of the original plaintext message. 
3. 
A "random" 24-bit initialization vector (IV) is generated and prepended to 
(added to the beginning of) the secret key (which is distributed through an 
out-of-band method)that is then input to the RC4 Key Scheduling 
Algorithm (KSA) to generate a seed value for the WEP pseudorandom 
number generator (PRNG). 
4. 
The WEP PRNG outputs the encrypting cipher-stream. 
5. 
This cipher-stream is then XOR'd with the plaintext/ICV message to produce 
the WEP ciphertext. 
6. 
The ciphertext is then prepended with the IV (in plaintext), encapsulated, and 
transmitted.

A new IV is used for each flame to prevent the reuse of the key from weakening 
the encryption. This means that for each string generated, a different value will be used 
for the 1KC4 key. Although this is a secure policy in itself, its implementation in WEP is 
flawed because of the nature of the 24-bit space. It is so small with respect to the poten- 
tial set of IVs, that in a short period of time all keys are reused. When this happens, two 
different messages are encrypted with the same IV and key and the two messages can be 
XOR'd with each other to cancel out the key stream, allowing an attacker who knows 
the contents of one message to easily figure out the contents of the other. 
Unfortunately, this weakness is the same for both the 40- and 128-bit encryption levels, 
because both use the 24-bit IV. 
To protect against some rudimentary attacks that insert known text into the stream 
to attempt to reveal the key stream, WEP incorporates a checksum into each flame. Any 
flame not found to be valid through the checksum is discarded. 
Authentication 
There are two authentication methods in the 802.11 standard: open and shared-key. 
Open authentication is more precisely described as device-oriented authentication and 
can be considered a null authentication~all requests are granted. Without WEE open 
authentication leaves the WLAN wide open to any client who knows the SSID. With 
WEP enabled, the WEP secret key becomes the indirect authenticator. The open 
authentication exchange, with WEP enabled, is shown in Figure 4.9.

Chapter 4 • Wireless Technologies 
The shared-key authentication process shown in Figure 4.10 is a four-step process 
that begins when the AP receives the validated request for association. After the AP 
receives the request, a series of management frames are transmitted between the stations 
to produce the authentication. This includes the use of the cryptographic mechanisms 
employed by WEP as a validation. The four steps break down in the following manner: 
1. The requestor (the client) sends a request for association. 
2. 
The authenticator (the AP) receives the request, and responds by producing a 
random challenge text and transmitting it back to the requestor. 
3. The requestor receives the transmission, encrypts the challenge with the secret 
key, and transmits the encrypted challenge back to the authenticator. 
4. The authenticator decrypts the challenge text and compares the values against 
the original. If they match, the requestor is authenticated. On the other hand, 
if the requestor does not have the shared key, the cipher stream cannot be 
reproduced, therefore the plaintext cannot be discovered, and theoretically the 
transmission is secured.

One of the greatest weaknesses in shared-key authentication is that it provides an 
attacker with enough information to try and crack the WEP secret key. The challenge, 
which is sent from authenticator to requestor, is sent in the clear. The requesting client 
then transmits the same challenge, encrypted using the WEP secret key, back to the 
authenticator.An attacker who captures both of these packets now has two pieces of a 
three-piece puzzle: the cleartext challenge and the encrypted ciphertext of that challenge. 
The algorithm 1KC4 is also known.All that is missing is the secret key. To determine the 
key, the attacker may simply try a brute force search of the potential key space using a dic- 
tionary attack. At each step, the attacker tries to decrypt the encrypted challenge with a 
dictionary word as the secret key. The result is then compared against the authenticator's 
challenge. If the two match, then the secret key has been determined. In cryptography, this

802. lx Authentication 
The current IEEE 802.11 standard is severely limited because it is available only for the 
current open and shared-key authentication scheme, which is non-extensible. To address 
the weaknesses in the authentication mechanisms discussed above, several vendors 
(including Cisco and Microsoft) adopted the IEEE 802.1x authentication mechanism for 
wireless networks.The IEEE 802.1x standard was created for the purpose of providing a 
security framework for port-based access control that resides in the upper layers of the 
protocol stack. The most common method for port-based access control is to enable 
new authentication and key management methods without changing current network 
devices. The benefits that are the end result of this work include the following: 
1. 
There is a significant decrease in hardware cost and complexity. 
2. 
There are more options, allowing administrators to pick and choose their secu- 
rity solutions. 
3. 
The latest and greatest security technology can be installed and should still 
work with the existing infrastructure. 
4. 
You can respond quickly to security issues as they arise. 
When a client device connects to a port on an 802.1x-capable AP, the AP port 
determines the authenticity of the devices. Before discussing the workings of the 802.1x 
standard, the following terminology must be defined: 
•

Extensible Authentication Protocol Over LAN (EAPoL) 802.1x defines 
a standard for encapsulating EAP messages so that they can be handled directly 
by a LAN MAC service. 802.1x tries to make authentication more encom- 
passing, rather than enforcing specific mechanisms on the devices. Because of 
this, 802.11x uses Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) to receive authen- 
tication information. 
Extensible Authentication Protocol Over Wireless (EAPoW) When 
EAPOL messages are encapsulated over 802.11 wireless frames, they are known 
as EAPoW. 
The 802.1x standard works in a similar fashion for both EAPoL and EAPoW. As 
shown in Figure 4.11, the EAP supplicant (in this case, the wireless client) communicates 
with the AP over an "uncontrolled port."The AP sends an EAP Request/Identity to the 
supplicant and a Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS)-Access- 
Request to the RADIUS access server. The supplicant then responds with an identity 
packet and the RADIUS server sends a challenge based on the identity packets sent 
from the supplicant. The supplicant provides its credentials in the EAP-R.esponse that 
the AP forwards to the RADIUS server. If the response is valid and the credentials vali- 
dated, the RADIUS server sends a RADIUS-Access-Accept to the AR which then 
allows the supplicant to communicate over a "controlled" port. This is communicated by 
the AP to the supplicant in the EAP-Success packet.

User Identification and Strong Authentication 
With the addition of the 802.1x standard, clients are identified by username, not by the 
MAC addresses of the devices. This design not only enhances security, but also stream- 
lines the process of authentication, authorization, and accountability (AAA) for the net- 
work. 802.1x was designed to support extended forms of authentication using password 
methods (such as one-time passwords, or GSS_API mechanisms like Kerberos) and non- 
password methods (such as biometrics, Internet Key Exchange [IKE], and Smart Cards). 
Dynamic Key Derivation 
The IEEE 802.1x standard allows for the creation of per-user session keys. WEP keys do 
not have to be kept at the client device or at the AP when using 802.1x. These WEP 
keys are dynamically created at the client for every session, thus making it more secure. 
The Global key, like a broadcast WEP key, can be encrypted using a Unicast session key, 
and then sent from the AP to the client in a much more secure manner. 
Mutual Authentication 
802.1x and EAP provide for a mutual authentication capability. This makes the clients 
and the authentication servers mutually authenticating end points, and assists in the miti- 
gation of attacks from man-in-the-middle (MITM) types of devices. Any of the fol- 
lowing EAP methods provide for mutual authentication: 
• 
TLS Requires that the server supply a certificate and establish that it has pos- 
session of the private key. 
• 
IKE Requires that the server show possession of a preshared key or private 
key (this can be considered certificate authentication).

Chapter 4 • Wireless Technologies 
GSS API (Kerberos) Requires that the server can demonstrate knowledge 
of the session key. 
Per-Packet Authentication 
EAP can support per-packet authentication and integrity protection, but it is not 
extended to all types of EAP messages. For example, negative acknowledgment (NACK) 
and notification messages cannot use per-packet authentication and integrity. Per-packet 
authentication and integrity protection works for the following (packet is encrypted 
unless otherwise noted):

Common Exploits of Wireless Networks 
In general, attacks on wireless networks fall into four basic categories: passive, active, 
MITM, and jamming.

While it may seem that we are deviating from the topic of networking here, the 
opposite in indeed the case. Security, especially in the case of wireless networking, 
is of paramount importance to you in your duties planning, implementing and 
~ maintaining any network. That said, we are likely diving a bit deeper in this sec- 
tion than you will likely be tested on during your Network+ exam. 
Passive Attacks on Wireless Networks 
A passive attack occurs when someone listens to or eavesdrops on network traffic. 
Armed with a wireless network adaptor that supports promiscuous mode, the eaves- 
dropper can capture network traffic for analysis using readily available tools, such as 
Network Monitor in Microsoft products, or TCPDump in Linux-based products, or 
AirSnort (developed for Linux, but Windows drivers can be written). A passive attack on 
a wireless network may not be malicious in nature. In fact, many in the wardriving com- 
munity claim their wardriving activities are benign or educational in nature. Wireless 
communication takes place on unlicensed public frequencies~anyone can use these fre- 
quencies. This makes protecting a wireless network from passive attacks more difficult. 
Passive attacks are by their very nature difficult to detect. If an administrator is using 
DHCP (Dynamic Host Control Protocol) on the wireless network (this is not recom- 
mended), he or she might notice that an authorized MAC address has acquired an IP 
address in the DHCP server logs. Then again, he or she might not. Perhaps the adminis- 
trator notices a suspicious-looking car sporting an antenna out of one of its windows. If 
the car is parked on private property, the driver could be asked to move or possibly 
charged with trespassing, but the legal response is severely limited. Only if it could be 
determined the wardriver was actively attempting to crack any encryption used on the 
network or otherwise interfering or analyzing wireless traffic with malicious intent 
would he or she be susceptible to being charged with a data-related crime, but this 
would depend on the country or state in which the activity took place. 
Passive attacks on wireless networks are extremely common, almost to the point of 
being ubiquitous. Detecting and reporting on wireless networks has become a popular 
hobby for many wireless wardriving enthusiasts. In fact, this activity is so popular that a 
new term, "war plugging", has emerged to describe the behavior of people who actually 
wish to advertise both the availability of an AP and the services they offer by config- 
uring their SSIDs with text such as "Get_food_here"! 
Detecting Wireless Networks 
Utilizing new tools created for wireless networks and the existing identification and 
attack techniques and utilities originally designed for wired networks, attackers have 
many avenues into a wireless network. The first step in attacking a wireless network 
www.syngress.com 

210 
Chapter 4 • Wireless Technologies 
involves finding a network to attack. The most popular software developed to identify 
wireless networks was NetStumbler (www.netstumbler.com). NetStumbler is a Windows 
application that listens for information, such as the SSID, being broadcast from APs that 
have not disabled the broadcast feature. When it finds a network, it notifies the person 
running the scan and adds it to the list of found networks. 
As people began to drive around their towns and cities looking for wireless net- 
works, NetStumbler added features such as pulling coordinates from Global Positioning 
System (GPS) satellites and plotting the information on mapping software. This method 
of finding networks is reminiscent of the method hackers used to find computers when 
they had only modems to communicate. They ran programs designed to search through 
all possible phone numbers and call each one, looking for a modem to answer. This type 
of scan was typically referred to as war dialing; driving around looking for wireless net- 
works is known as war driving. 
Similar tools are available for Linux and other UNIX-based operating systems. These 
tools contain additional utilities that hackers use to attack hosts and networks once 
access is found. A quick search on www.freshmeat.net or www.packetstormsecurity.com 
for "802.11" reveals several network identification tools, as well as tools used to con- 
figure and monitor wireless network connections. 
Using NetStumbler 
The NetStumbler program works primarily with wireless network adaptors that use the 
Hermes chipset, because of its ability to detect multiple APs that are within range and 
WEE among other features (a list of supported adaptors is available at the NetStumber 
website). The most common card that uses the Hermes chipset for use with 
NetStumbler is the ORINOCO gold card. Another advantage of the ORINOCO card 
is that it supports the addition of an external antenna, which can greatly extend the 
range of a wireless network by many orders of magnitude, depending on the antenna. 
Wardrivers often make their own Yagi-type (tubular or cylindrical) antenna. 
Instructions for doing so are easy to find on the Internet, and effective antennas 
have been made out of such items as Pringles potato chip cans. Another type of 
...... ~"~'~i antenna that can be easily homemade is the dipole, which is basically a piece of 
wire of a length that's a multiple of the wavelength, cut in the center and 
attached to a piece of cable that is connected to the wireless NIC (network 
interface card). 
A disadvantage of the Hermes chipset is that it doesn't support promiscuous mode, 
so it cannot be used to sniff network traffic. For that purpose, you need a wireless net- 
work adaptor that supports the PP,.ISM2 chipset. The majority of wireless network 

Wireless Technologies • Chapter 4 
211 
adaptors targeted for the consumer market use this chipset (for example, the Linksys 
WPC network adaptors). Sophisticated wardrivers will arm themselves with both types 
of cams, one for discovering wireless networks and another for capturing the traffic. 
In spite of the fact that NetStumbler is free, it is a sophisticated and feature-rich 
product that is excellent for performing wireless site surveys, whether for legitimate pur- 
poses or not. Not only can it provide detailed information on the wireless networks it 
detects, it can be used in combination with a GPS to provide exact details on the lati- 
tude and longitude of the detected wireless networks. Figure 4.12 shows the interface of 
a typical NetStumbler session.

As you can see in Figure 4.12, NetStumbler displays information on the Service Set 
Identifier, the channel, and the manufacturer of the wireless AR There are a few things 
that are particularly noteworthy about this session.The first is that a couple of APs are 
still configured with the default SSID supplied by the manufacturer, which should 
always be changed to a non-default value upon setup and configuration. Another is that 
at least one network uses an SSID that may provide a clue about the entity that has 
implemented it; again, this is not a good practice when configuring SSIDs. Finally, we 
can see which of these networks have implemented WEE 
If the network administrator has been kind enough to provide a clue about the 
company in the SSID or is not encrypting traffic with WEE the potential eavesdropper's 
job is made a lot easier. Using a tool such as NetStumbler is only a preliminary step for 
the attacker.After discovering the SSID and other information, the attacker can connect 
to the wireless network to sniff and capture network traffic. This network traffic can 
reveal a lot of information about the network and the company that uses it. For 

212 
Chapter 4 • Wireless Technologies 
example, looking at the network traffic, the attacker can determine which DNS servers 
are being used, the default home pages configured on browsers, network names, logon 
traffic, and so on. The attacker can use this information to determine if the network is of 
sufficient interest to proceed further with other attacks. Furthermore, if the network is 
using WER the attacker can, given enough time, capture a sufficient amount of traffic to 
crack the encryption. 
NetStumbler works on networks that are configured as open systems. This means that 
the wireless network indicates that it exists and will respond with the value of its SSID 
to other wireless devices when they send out a radio beacon with an empty set SSID. 
This does not mean, however, that the wireless network can be easily compromised, zf 
other security measures have been implemented. 
Protecting Against Wireless Network Detection 
To defend against the use of NetStumbler and other programs to detect a wireless net- 
work easily, administrators should configure the wireless network as a closed system. This 
means that the AP will not respond to empty set SSID beacons and will consequently 
be "invisible" to programs such as NetStumbler, which rely on this technique to discover 
wireless networks. However, it is still possible to capture the raw 802.11 frames and 
decode them through the use of programs such as ethereal and Wild Packet's AiroPeek 
to determine this information.As well, RF spectrum analyzers can be used to discover 
the presence of wireless networks. Notwithstanding this weakness of closed systems, you 
should choose wireless APs that support this feature. 
Sniffing 
Originally conceived as a legitimate network and traffic analysis tool, sniffing remains 
one of the most effective techniques in attacking a wireless network, whether it's to 
map the network as part of a target reconnaissance, to grab passwords, or to capture 
unencrypted data. 
Sniffing is the electronic form of eavesdropping on the communications that com- 
puters transmit across networks. In early networks, the equipment that connected 
machines together allowed every machine on the network to see the traffic of all others. 
These devices, repeaters and hubs, were very successful for getting machines connected, 
but allowed an attacker easy access to all traffic on the network because the attacker only 
needed to connect to one point to see the entire network's traffic. 
Wireless networks function very similarly to the original repeaters and hubs. Every 
communication across the wireless network is viewable to anyone who happens to be 
listening to the network. In fact, the person who is listening does not even need to be 
associated with the network in order to sniffl. 
The hacker has many tools available to attack and monitor a wireless network. 
A few of these tools are AiroPeek (www.wildpackets.com/products/airopeek) in 
Windows, Ethereal in Windows, UNIX, or Linux, and TCPDump or ngrep 

Wireless Technologies • Chapter 4 
213 
(http://ngrep.sourceforge.net) in a UNIX or Linux environment.These tools work well 
for sniffing both wired and wireless networks. 
All of these software packages function by putting your network card in what is 
called promiscuous mode. When the NIC is in this mode, every packet that goes past the 
interface is captured and displayed within the application window. If the attacker is able 
to acquire a WEP key, he or she can then utilize features within AiroPeek and Ethereal 
to decrypt either live or post-capture data. 
By running NetStumbler, or other software that can perform the same function, 
hackers are able to find possible targets. Once a hacker has found possible networks to 
attack, one of the first tasks is to identify the target. Many organizations are "nice" 
enough to include their names or addresses in the network name. 
Even if the network administrator has configured his equipment in such a way as to 
hide this information, there are tools available that can determine this information. 
Utilizing any of the aforementioned network sniffing tools, an attacker can easily mon- 
itor the unencrypted network. Figure 4.13 shows a network sniff of the traffic on a 
wireless network. From this session, it is simple to determine the DNS server and the 
default search domain and default Web home page. With this information, an attacker 
can easily identify a target and determine if it is worth attacking.

If the network is encrypted, the hacker will start by determining the physical loca- 
tion of the target. NetStumbler has the ability to display the signal strength of the dis- 
covered networks. Utilizing this information, the attacker only needs to drive around 
and look for a location where the signal strength increases and decreases to determine 
the home of the wireless network.

To enhance their ability to locate the positions of a wireless network, attackers can 
use directional antennas to focus the wireless interface in a specific direction. An excel- 
lent source for wireless information, including information on the design of directional 
antennas, is the Bay Area Wireless Users Group (www.bawug.org).

Protecting Against Sniffing and Eavesdropping 
As networking technology matured, wired networks were able to upgrade from repeaters 
and hubs to a switched environment. These switches would send only the traffic 
intended for a specific host over each individual port, making it difficult (although not 
impossible) to sniff the entire network's traffic. Unfortunately, this is not an option for 
wireless networks due to the nature of wireless communications. 
The only way to protect wireless users from attackers who might be sniffing is to 
utilize encrypted sessions wherever possible: SSL for e-mail connections, SSH instead of 
Telnet, and Secure Copy (SCP) instead of File Transfer Protocol (FTP). 
To protect a network from being discovered with NetStumbler, it is important to 
turn off any network identification broadcasts and, if possible, close down the network 
to any unauthorized users. This prevents tools such as NetStumbler from finding the 
network. However, the knowledgeable attacker will know that just because the network 
is not broadcasting information, that does not mean that the network cannot be found. 
All an attacker needs to do is utilize one of the network sniffers to monitor for net- 
work activity. Although not as efficient as NetStumbler, it is still a functional way to dis- 
cover and monitor networks. Even encrypted networks show traffic to the sniffer. Once 
they have identified traffic, attackers can then utilize the same identification techniques 
to begin an attack on the network. 
Active Attacks on Wireless Networks 
Once an attacker has gained sufficient information from the passive attack, the hacker 
can then launch an active attack against the network. There are a potentially large 
number of active attacks that a hacker can launch against a wireless network. For the 
most part, these attacks are identical to the kinds of active attacks that are encountered 
on wired networks. These include, but are not limited to, unauthorized access, spoofing, 
Denial of Service (DOS) and flooding attacks, as well as the introduction of malware 
(malicious software) and the theft of devices. With the rise in popularity of wireless 

Wireless Technologies • Chapter 4 
215 
networks, new variations of traditional attacks specific to wireless networks have 
emerged along with specific terms to describe them, such as "drive-by spamming" in 
which a spammer sends out tens or hundreds of thousands of spam messages using a 
compromised wireless network. 
Because of the nature of wireless networks and the weaknesses of WER unautho- 
rized access and spoofing are the most common threats to wireless networks. Spoofing 
occurs when an attacker is able to use an unauthorized station to impersonate an autho- 
rized station on a wireless network. A common way to protect a wireless network 
against unauthorized access is to use MAC filtering to allow only clients that possess 
valid MAC addresses access to the wireless network. The list of allowable MAC addresses 
can be configured on the AR or it may be configured on a RADIUS server with which 
theAP communicates. However, regardless of the technique used to implement MAC 
filtering, it is a relatively easy matter to change the MAC address of a wireless device 
through software in order to impersonate a valid station. In Windows, this is accom- 
plished with a simple edit of the registry, and in UNIX through a root shell command. 
MAC addresses are sent in the clear on wireless networks, so it is also a relatively easy 
matter to discover authorized addresses. 
WEP can be implemented to provide more protection against authentication spoofing 
through the use of Shared Key authentication. However, as we discussed earlier, Shared 
Key authentication creates an additional vulnerability. Because Shared Key authentication 
makes visible both a plaintext challenge and the resulting ciphertext version of it, it is pos- 
sible to use this information to spoof authentication to a closed network. 
Once the attacker has authenticated and associated with the wireless network, he or 
she can then run port scans, use special tools to dump user lists and passwords, impersonate 
users, connect to shares, and, in general, create havoc on the network through DoS and 
flooding attacks. These DoS attacks can be traditional in nature, such as a ping flood, SYN, 
fragment, or Distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks, or they can be specific to wireless networks 
through the placement and use of rogue access points to prevent wireless traffic from being 
forwarded properly (similar to the practice of router spoofing on wired networks). 
Spoofing (Interception) and Unauthorized Access 
The combination of weaknesses in WER and the nature of wireless transmission, has 
highlighted the art of spoofing as a real threat to wireless network security. Some well- 
publicized weaknesses in user authentication using WEP have made authentication 
spoofing just one of an equally well-tested number of exploits by attackers. 
One definition of spoofing is the ability of an attacker to trick the network equip- 
ment into thinking that the address from which a connection is coming is one of the 
valid and allowed machines from its network. Attackers can accomplish this in several 
ways, the easiest of which is to simply redefine the MAC address of the attacker's wire- 
less or network card to be a valid MAC address. This can be accomplished in Windows 
through a simple registry edit. Several wireless providers also have an option to define

Chapter 4 • Wireless Technologies 
the MAC address for each wireless connection from within the client manager applica- 
tion that is provided with the interface. 
There are several reasons that an attacker would spoof. If the network allows only 
valid interfaces through MAC or IP address filtering, an attacker would need to deter- 
mine a valid MAC or IP address to be able to communicate on the network. Once that 
is accomplished, the attacker could then reprogram his interface with that information, 
allowing him to connect to the network by impersonating a valid machine. 
IEEE 802.11 networks introduce a new form of spoofing: authentication spoofing. 
As described in their paper "Intercepting Mobile Communications: The Insecurities of 
802.11," Borisov, Goldberg, and Wagner (the authors) identified a way to utilize weak- 
nesses within WEP and the authentication process to spoof authentication into a closed 
network. The process of authentication, as defined by IEEE 802.11, is very simple. In a 
shared-key configuration, the AP sends out a 128-byte random string in a cleartext mes- 
sage to the workstation that is attempting to authenticate. The workstation then encrypts 
the message with the shared key and returns the encrypted message to the AR If the 
message matches what the AP is expecting, the workstation is authenticated onto the 
network and access is allowed. 
As described in the paper, if an attacker has knowledge of both the original plaintext 
and ciphertext messages, it is possible to create a forged encrypted message. By sniffing 
the wireless network, an attacker is able to accumulate many authentication requests, 
each of which includes the original plaintext message and the returned ciphertext- 
encrypted reply. From this, the attacker can easily identify the key stream used to 
encrypt the response message. The attacker could then use it to forge an authentication 
message that the AP will accept as a proper authentication. 
The wireless hacker does not need many complex tools to succeed in spoofing a 
MAC address. In many cases, these changes are either features of the wireless manufac- 
turers or can be easily changed through a Windows Registry modification or through 
Linux system utilities. Once a valid MAC address is identified, the attacker needs only to 
reconfigure his device to trick the AP into thinking he is a valid user. 
The ability to forge authentication onto a wireless network is a complex process. 
There are no known "off the shelf" packages available that will provide these services. 
Attackers will need to either create their own tools or take the time to decrypt the 
secret key by using AirSnort or WEPCrack. 
If the attacker is using Windows 2000 and his network card supports reconfiguring 
the MAC address, there is another way to reconfigure this information. A card sup- 
porting this feature can be changed through the System Control Panel. 
Once the attacker is utilizing a valid MAC address, he is able to access any resource 
available from the wireless network. IfWEP is enabled, the attacker will have to either 
identify the WEP secret key or capture the key through malware or stealing the user's 
notebook.

Protecting Against Spoofing and Unauthorized Attacks 
Protecting against these attacks involves adding several additional components to the 
wireless network. The following are examples of measures that can be taken: 
• 
Using an external authentication source such as RADIUS or SecurlD, will 
prevent an unauthorized user from accessing the wireless network and the 
resources with which it connects. 
• 
Requiring wireless users to use a VPN to access the wired network also pro- 
vides a significant stumbling block to an attacker. 
• 
Another possibility is to allow only SSH access or SSL-encrypted traffic into 
the network. 
• 
Many of WEP's weaknesses can be mitigated by isolating the wireless network 
through a firewall and requiring that wireless clients use a VPN to access the 
wired network. 
Denial of Service and Flooding Attacks 
The nature of wireless transmission, and especially 1:he use of spread spectrum tech- 
nology, makes a wireless network especially vulnerable to denial of service attacks. The 
equipment needed to launch such an attack is freely available and very affordable. In 
fact, many homes and offices contain the equipment that is necessary to deny service to 
their wireless networks. 
A denial of service occurs when an attacker has engaged most of the resources a 
host or network has available, rendering it unavailable to legitimate users. One of the 
original DoS attacks is known as a ping flood. A ping flood utilizes misconfigured equip- 
ment along with bad "features" within TCP/IP to cause a large number of hosts or 
devices to send an ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) echo (ping) to a specified 
target. When the attack occurs, it tends to use a large portion of the resources of both 
the network connection and the host being attacked. This makes it very difficult for 
valid end users to access the host for normal business purposes. 
In a wireless network, several items can cause a similar disruption of service. 
Probably the easiest way to do this is through a conflict within the wireless spectrum, 
caused by different devices attempting to use the same frequency. Many new wireless 
telephones use the same frequency as 802.11 networks. Through either intentional or 
unintentional uses of another device that uses the 2.4GHz frequency, a simple telephone 
call could prevent all wireless users from accessing the network. 
Another possible attack would be through a massive number of invalid (or valid) 
authentication requests. If the AP is tied up with thousands of spoofed authentication 
attempts, authorized users attempting to authenticate themselves will have major diffi- 
culties in acquiring a valid session. 

218 
Chapter 4 • Wireless Technologies 
As demonstrated earlier, the attacker has many tools available to hijack network con- 
nections. If a hacker is able to spoof the machines of a wireless network into thinking 
that the attacker's machine is their default gateway, not only will the attacker be able to 
intercept all traffic destined for the wired network, but he or she would also be able to 
prevent any of the wireless network machines from accessing the wired network. To do 
this, the hacker needs only to spoof the AP and not forward connections on to the end 
destination, thus preventing all wireless users from doing valid wireless activities. 
Not much effort is needed to create a wireless DoS. In fact, many users create these 
situations with the equipment found within their homes or offices. In a small apartment 
building, you could find several APs as well as many wireless telephones, all of which 
transmit on the same frequency. These users could easily inadvertently create DoS attacks 
on their own networks as well as on those of their neighbors. 
A hacker who wants to launch a DoS attack against a network with a flood of 
authentication strings will also need to be a well-skilled programmer. There are not 
many tools available to create this type of attack, but (as we discussed earlier regarding 
the attempts to crack WEP) much of the programming required does not take much 
effort or time. In fact, a skilled hacker should be able to create such a tool within a few 
hours. This simple application, when used with standard wireless equipment, could then 
be used to render a wireless network unusable for the duration of the attack. 
Creating a hijacked AP DoS requires additional tools that can be found on many 
security sites. These tools are not very complex and are available for almost every com- 
puting platform available. 
Many apartments and older office buildings do not come pre-wired for the high- 
tech networks in use today. To add to the problem, if many individuals are setting up 
their own wireless networks without coordinating the installations, many problems can 
occur that will be difficult to detect. 
Only a limited number of frequencies are available to 802.11 networks. In fact, once 
the frequency is chosen, it does not change until manually reconfigured. Considering 
these problems, it is not hard to imagine the following situation occurring: 
A person goes out and purchases a wireless AP and several network cards for his home 
network. When he gets home to his apartment and configures his network, he is 
extremely happy with how well wireless networking actually works. Then, suddenly, none 
of the machines on the wireless network are able to communicate. After waiting on hold 
for 45 minutes to get through to the tech support line of the vendor who made the 
device, he finds that the network has magically started working again, so he hangs up. 
Later that week, the same problem occurs, except that this time he decides to wait 
on hold. While waiting, he goes onto his porch and begins discussing his frustration 
with his neighbor. During the conversation, his neighbor's kids come out and say that 
their wireless network is not working. 
So they begin to do a few tests (while still waiting on hold, of course). First, the 
man's neighbor turns off his AP (which is usually off unless the kids are online, to pro- 
tect their network). When this is done, the original person's wireless network starts 

Wireless Technologies • Chapter 4 
219 
working again. Then they turn on the neighbor's AP again and his network stops 
working again. 
At this point, a tech support rep finally answers and the caller describes what has 
happened. The tech-support representative has seen this situation several times and 
informs the user that he will need to change the frequency used in the device to 
another channel. He explains that the neighbor's network is utilizing the same channel, 
causing the two networks to conflict. Once the caller changes the frequency, everything 
starts working properly. 
Protecting Against DoS and Flooding Attacks 
There is little that can be done to protect against DoS attacks. In a wireless environment, 
an attacker does not have to even be in the same building or neighborhood. With a good 
enough antenna, an attacker is able to send these attacks from a great distance away. 
This is one of those times when it is valid to use NetStumbler in a nonhacking con- 
text. Using NetStumbler, administrators can identify other networks that may be in con- 
flict. However, NetStumbler will not identify other DoS attacks or other non-networking 
equipment that is causing conflicts (such as wireless telephones, wireless security cameras, 
amateur TV (ATV) systems, RF-based remote controls, wireless headsets, microphones and 
audio speakers, and other devices that use the 2.4 GHz frequency). 
Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on Wireless Networks 
Placing a rogue access point within range of wireless stations is a wireless-specific variation 
of a man-in-the-middle attack. If the attacker knows the SSID in use by the network 
(which, as we have seen, is easily discoverable) and the rogue AP has enough strength, 
wireless users will have no way of knowing that they are connecting to an unauthorized 
AE Using a rogue AP, an attacker can gain valuable information about the wireless net- 
work, such as authentication requests, the secret key that is in use, and so on. Often, the 
attacker will set up a laptop with two wireless adaptors, where one card is used by the 
rogue AP and the other is used to forward requests through a wireless bridge to the legiti- 
mate AE With a sufficiently strong antenna, the rogue AP does not have to be located in 
close proximity to the legitimate AP. So, for example, the attacker can run the rogue AP 
from a car or van parked some distance away from the building. However, it is also 
common to set up hidden rogue APs (under desks, in closets, etcetera) close to and within 
the same physical area as the legitimate AE Because of their undetectable nature, the only 
defense against rogue APs is vigilance through frequent site surveys (using tools such as 
NetStumbler and AiroPeek,) and physical security. 
Frequent site surveys also have the advantage of uncovering the unauthorized APs 
that company staff members may have set up in their own work areas, thereby compro- 
mising the entire network and completely undoing the hard work that went into 
securing the network in the first place. This is usually done with no malicious intent, but 
for the convenience of the user, who may want to be able to connect to the network via 
www.syngress.com 

220 
Chapter 4 • Wireless Technologies 
his or her laptop in meeting rooms or break rooms or other areas that don't have wired 
outlets. Even if your company does not use or plan to use a wireless network, you 
should consider doing regular wireless site surveys to see if someone has violated your 
company security policy by placing an unauthorized AP on the network, regardless of 
their intent. 
Network Hijacking and Modification 
Numerous techniques are available for an attacker to hijack a wireless network or session. 
And unlike some attacks, network and security administrators may be unable to tell the 
difference between the hijacker and a legitimate "passenger." 
Many tools are available to the network hijacker. These tools are based upon basic 
implementation issues within almost every network device available today. As TCP/IP 
packets go through switches, routers, and APs, each device looks at the destination IP 
address and compares it with the IP addresses it knows to be local. If the address is not 
in the address table, the device hands the packet off to its default gateway. 
The address table is used to coordinate the IP address with the MAC addresses that are 
known to be local to the device. In many situations, this is a dynamic list that is built up 
from traffic that is passing through the device and through Address Resolution Protocol 
(ARP) notifications from new devices joining the network. There is no authentication or 
verification that the request received by the device is valid. Thus, a malicious user is able to 
send messages to routing devices and APs stating that his MAC address is associated with a 
known IP address. From then on, all traffic that goes through that router destined for the 
hijacked IP address will be handed off to the hacker's machine. 
If the attacker spoofs as the default gateway or a specific host on the network, all 
machines trying to get to the network or the spoofed machine will connect to the 
attacker's machine instead of to the gateway or host to which they intended to connect. 
If the attacker is clever, he will only use this to identify passwords and other necessary 
information and route the rest of the traffic to the intended recipients. If he does this, 
the end users will have no idea that this man-in-the-middle has intercepted their commu- 
nications and compromised their passwords and information. 
Another clever attack can be accomplished through the use of rogue APs. If the 
attacker is able to put together an AP with enough strength, the end users may not be 
able to tell which AP is the authorized one that they should be using. In fact, most will 
not even know that another is available. Using this technique, the attacker is able to 
receive authentication requests and information from the end workstation regarding the 
secret key and where they are attempting to connect. 
These rogue APs can also be used to attempt to break in to more tightly configured 
wireless APs. Utilizing tools such as AirSnort and WEPCrack requires a large amount of 
data to be able to decrypt the secret key. A hacker sitting in a car in front of your house or 
office is noticeable and will generally not have enough time to finish acquiring enough 
information to break the key. However, if the attacker installs a tiny, easily hidden machine 

Wireless Technologies • Chapter 4 
221 
in an inconspicuous location, this machine could sit there long enough to break the key 
and possibly act as an external AP into the wireless network it has hacked. 
Attackers who wish to spoof more than their MAC addresses have several tools 
available. Most of the tools available are for use in a UNIX environment and can be 
found through a simple search for "ARP Spoof" at http://packetstormsecurity.com. 
With these tools, the hacker can easily trick all machines on the wireless network into 
thinking that the hacker's machine is another machine. Through simple sniffing on the 
network, an attacker can determine which machines are in high use by the workstations 
on the network. If the attacker then spoofs the address of one of these machines, the 
attacker might be able to intercept much of the legitimate traffic on the network. 
AirSnort and WEPCrack are freely available. While it would take additional 
resources to build a rogue AR these tools will run from any Linux machine. 
Once an attacker has identified a network for attack and spoofed his MAC address 
to become a valid member of the network, the attacker can gain further information 
that is not available through simple sniffing. If the network being attacked is using SSH 
to access the hosts, just stealing a password might be easier than attempting to break in 
to the host using an available exploit. 
By just ARP spoofing the connection with the AP to be that of the host from 
which the attacker wants to steal the passwords, the attacker can cause all wireless users 
who are attempting to SSH into the host to connect to the rogue machine instead. 
When these users attempt to sign on with their passwords, the attacker is then able to 
first receive their passwords and then pass on the connection to the real end destination. 
If the attacker does not perform the second step, it will increase the likelihood that the 
attack will be noticed because users will begin to complain that they are unable to con- 
nect to the host. 
Protection against Network Ho'acking , and Modification 
There are several different tools that can be used to protect a network from IP spoofing 
with invalid AIKP requests. These tools, such as ArpWatch, notify an administrator when 
A1KP requests are detected, allowing the administrator to take the appropriate action to 
determine whether someone is attempting to hack into the network. 
Another option is to statically define the MAC/IP address definitions.This prevents 
attackers from being able to redefine this information. However, due to the management 
overhead in statically defining all network adapters' MAC addresses on every router and 
AP, this solution is rarely implemented. There is no way to identify or prevent attackers 
from using passive attacks, such as from AirSnort or WEPCrack, to determine the secret 
keys used in an encrypted wireless network. The best protection available is to change 
the secret key on a regular basis and add additional authentication mechanisms such as 
RADIUS or dynamic firewalls to restrict access to the wired network. However, unless 
every wireless workstation is secure, an attacker only needs to go after one of the other 
wireless clients to be able to access the resources available to it.

Chapter 4 • Wireless Technologies 
Jamming Attacks 
The last type of attack is the jamming attack. This is a fairly simple attack to pull off and 
can be done using readily available off-the-shelfRF testing tools (although they were 
not necessarily designed to perform this function). Whereas hackers who want to get 
information from your network would use other passive and active types of attacks to 
accomplish their goals, attackers who just want to disrupt your network communications 
or even shut down a wireless network can jam you without ever being seen. Jamming a 
wireless LAN is similar in many ways to how an attack would target a network with a 
Denial of Service attack~the difference is that in the case of the wireless network, the 
attack can be carried out by one person with an overpowering tkF signal. This attack 
can be carried out by using any number of products, but the easiest is with a high- 
power P,.F signal generator readily available from various vendors. 
This is sometimes the most difficult type of attack to prevent against, as the attacker 
does not need to gain access to your network. The attacker can sit in your parking lot or 
even further away depending on the power output of their jamming device. While you 
may be able to readily determine the fact that you are being jammed, you may find 
yourself hard pressed to solve the problem. Indications of a jamming attack include the 
sudden inability of clients to connect to APs where there was not a problem previously. 
The problem will be evidenced across all or most of your clients (the ones within the 
range of the RF jamming device) even though your APs are operating properly. 
Jamming attacks are sometimes used as the prelude to further attacks. One possible 
example includes jamming the wireless network, thereby forcing clients to lose their 
connections with authorized APs. During this time, rogue APs can be made available 
operating at a higher power than the authorized APs. When the jamming attack is 
stopped, the clients will tend to associate back to the AP that is presenting the strongest 
signal. Now the attacker owns all of the network clients attached to his rogue APs. The 
attack continues from there. 
In some cases, you find that RF jamming is not always intentional and may be the 
result of other, non-hostile, sources such as a nearby communications tower or another 
wireless LAN that is also operating in the same frequency range. Baby monitors, cordless 
telephones, microwave ovens, and many other consumer products may also be sources of 
possible interference. 
You can take some comfort in knowing that although a jamming attack is relatively 
easy and inexpensive to pull off, it is not the preferred means of attack. The only real 
victory with a jamming attack for most hackers is temporarily taking your wireless net- 
work offiine.

Configuring Windows Client 
Computers for Wireless Network Security 
Wireless LAN security is provided through a myriad of solutions. Some of these mecha- 
nisms are internal to Windows itself, while others are third-party solutions or part of the 
IEEE 802.11 standard. In this section, we will be focusing primarily on using WEP and 
802.1x-based security on Windows 2000 Professional and Windows XP Professional 
computers. Whatever security mechanism you should decide to implement, you must 
ensure that you are diligent about getting it done right. There is rarely a second chance 
for security, especially when it comes to securing a wireless LAN. 
Windows XP Professional 
Windows XP has been hailed as the operating system of choice for wireless LAN users. 
Whatever your feelings are about this, it is a fact that Windows XP brings excellent sup- 
port for 802.11 wireless networks and 802.1x security to the mainstream. The only flaw 
in Windows XP's solution is that it can in some cases take the majority of control away 
from a user~sometimes this can be a good thing, though. Configuring WEP and 
802.1x security on a Windows XP Professional computer is outlined in Exercise 4.1.

Site Surveys 
A site survey is part of an audit done on wireless networks. Site surveys allow system and 
network administrators to determine the extent to which their wireless networks extend 
beyond the physical boundaries of their buildings. Typically, a site survey uses the same 
tools an attacker uses, such as a sniffer and a WEP cracking tool (for 802.11 network site 
surveys). The sniffer can be either Windows-based (such as NetStumbler) or 
UNIX/Linux-based (such as Kismet). For WEP cracking, AirSnort is recommended. 
Another tool that can be useful is a directional antenna such as aYagi antenna or a 
parabolic dish antenna. Directional and parabolic dish antennas allow for the reception 
of weak signals from greater distances by providing better amplification and gain on the 
signal. These antennas allow wireless network auditors the ability to determine how far 
an attacker can realistically be from the source of the wireless network transmissions in 
order to receive from and transmit to the network. 

Wireless Technologies • Chapter 4 
229 
Finally, another tool that is useful for site surveys is a GPS locator. This provides for 
the determination of the geographical latitude and longitude of areas where wireless 
signal measurements are taken. Using GPS, auditors can create a physical map of the 
boundaries of the wireless network. 
~J~M WARNING 
r Site surveys are not likely to appear on the Network+ exam. However, you 
should be aware of them for your daily tasks, and the information is presented 
here in the event that you do see a question about some of the tools used to 
conduct these surveys. Remember that the tools used to conduct site surveys 
and audits are essentially the same tools an attacker uses to gain access to a 
wireless network.

works and the measures that can be taken to secure them. 
WLANs are inherently insecure because of their very nature; the fact that they 
radiate radio signals containing network traffic that can be viewed and potentially com- 
promised by anyone within range of the signal. With the proper antennas, the range of 
WLANs is much greater than is commonly assumed. Many administrators wrongly 
believe that their networks are secure because the interference created by walls and other 
physical obstructions combined with the relative low power of wireless devices will con- 
tain the wireless signal sufficiently. Often, this is not the case. 
There are a number of different types of wireless networks that can be potentially 
deployed. These include HomelKE Bluetooth, 802.1 lb, and 802.1 la networks. The most 
common type of WLAN in use today is based on the IEEE 802.11b standard. 
The 802.11b standard defines the operation of WLANs in the 2.4- 2.4835 GHz 
unlicensed Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) band. 802.11b devices use direct 
sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) to achieve transmission rates of up to 11 Mbps. All 
802.11b devices are half-duplex devices, which means that a device cannot send and 
receive at the same time. In this, they are like hubs and therefore require mechanisms for 
contending with collisions when multiple stations are transmitting at the same time. To 
contend with collisions, wireless networks use Carrier Sense Multiple Access with

Another problem with WEP is that it uses a relatively short (24-bit) initialization 
vector (IV) to encrypt the traffic. Because each transmitted frame requires a new IV, it is 
possible to exhaust the entire IV keyspace in a few hours on a busy network, resulting in 
the reuse of IVs. This is known as IV collisions. IV collisions can also be used to crack 
the encryption. Furthermore, IVs are sent in the clear with each frame, introducing 
an o the r vuln e rab ili ty. 
The final stake in the heart of WEP is the fact that it uses 1<C4 as the encryption

algorithm. The RC4 algorithm is well known and recently it was discovered that it uses

a number of weak keys.Airsnort and Wepcrack are two well-known open-source tools

that exploit the weak key vulnerability of WEP.

Although WEP is not secure, it does nonetheless potentially provide a good barrier, 
and its use will slow down determined and knowledgeable attackers. WEP should always 
be implemented. The security of WEP is also dependent on how it is implemented,

Because the IV keyspace can be exhausted in a relatively short amount of time, static 
WEP keys should be changed on a frequent basis.

The best defense for a wireless network involves the use of multiple security mecha-

detect and respond to attacks.This strategy is known as defense-in-depth.

Securing a wireless network should begin with changing the default configurations

of the wireless network devices. These configurations include the default administrative 
password and the default SSID on the access point 
........... 
The Service Set Identifier (SSID) is a kind of network name, analogous to an SNMP

community name or a VLAN ID. In order for the wireless clients to authenticate and asso- ~!

i 
point. It should be changed to a unique value that does not contain any information that 
could potentially be used to identify the company or the kind of traflqc on the network. 
By default, SSIDs are broadcast in response to beacon probes and can be easily dis- 
i 
covered by site survey tools such as NetStumbler and Windows XR It is possible to turn 
off SSID on some access points. Disabling SSID broadcasts creates a closed network. If 
possible, SSID broadcasts should be disabled, although this will interfere with the ability 
i i ~  
/ 
of Windows XP to automatically discover wireless networks and associate with them. 
However, even if SSID broadcasts are turned off, it is still possible to sniff the network 
traffic and see the SSID in the frames. 
Wireless clients can connect to access points using either open system or shared key 
authentication. While shared key authentication provides protection against some denial 
of service (DOS) attacks, it creates a significant vulnerability for the WEP keys in use on 
the network and should not be used. 
MAC filtering is another defensive tactic that can be employed to protect wireless 
networks from unwanted intrusion. Only the wireless station that possess adaptors that 
have valid MAC addresses are allowed to communicate with the access point. However, 
MAC addresses can be easily spoofed and maintaining a list of valid MAC addresses may 
be impractical in a large environment.

A much better way of securing WLANs is to use 802.1x. 802.1x was originally 
developed to provide a method for port-based authentication on wired networks. 
......................... However, it was found to have significant application in wireless networks. With 802.1x 
.... 
authentication, a supplicant (a wireless workstation) has to be authenticated by an 
authenticator (usually a RADIUS server) before access is granted to the network itself. 
The authentication process takes place over a logical uncontrolled port that is used only 
for the authentication process. If the authentication process is successful, access is granted 
to the network on the logical controlled port. 
802.1x relies on Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) to perform the authenti- 
cation. The preferred EAP type for 802.1x is EAP-TLS. EAP-TLS provides the ability to 
use dynamic per user, session-based WEP keys, eliminating some of the more significant 
vulnerabilities associated with WEE However, to use EAP-TLS, you must deploy a 
Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to issue digital X.509 certificates to the wireless clients 
and the RADIUS server. 
Other methods that can be used to secure wireless networks include placing wireless 
access points on their own subnets in wireless DMZs (WDMZ). The WDMZ can be 
protected from the corporate network by a firewall or router. Access to the corporate 
network can be limited to VPN connections that use either PPTP or L2TE 
New security measures continue to be developed for wireless networks. Future secu- 
rity measures include Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) and Message Integrity 
Code (MIC).

Antenna Behaviors and Characteristics 
Gain occurs when a signal has its strength increased, such as by passing it 
through an amplifier. 
Loss is the exact opposite of gain and occurs when a signal has its strength 
decreased, either intentionally through the use of a device such as an attenuator 
or unintentionally such as through resistance losses in a cable. 
Reflection occurs when an electromagnetic radio frequency wave has 
impacted upon a surface that has a much larger cross section than that of the 
wave itself. 
When a wave is refracted, it passes through a medium and changes course with 
some of the original wave being reflected away from the original wave's path.

The Fresnel Zone is an elliptical region extending outward from the visual line

Protocol) and IEEE 802.11 Wireless LAN.

Examining the common threats to both wired and wireless networks provides 
a solid understanding in the basics of security principles and allows the 
network administrator to fully assess the risks associated with using wireless 
and other technologies. 
[-¢I Threats can come from simple design issues, where multiple devices utilize the 
same setup, or intentional denial of service attacks which can result in the 
corruption or loss of data. 
V¢I Malicious users aren't the source of all threats. Problems can also be caused by 
a conflict of similar resources, such as with 802.11b networks and cordless 
telephones. 
V¢I With wireless networks going beyond the border of the office or home, 
chances are greater that users' actions might be monitored by a third party. 
V¢l Electronic eavesdropping, or sniffing, is passive and undetectable to intrusion 
detection devices.

V¢I Tools that can be used to sniff networks are available for Windows (such as 
Ethereal and AiroPeek) and UNIX (such as TCPDump and ngrep). 
V¢l Sniffing traffic allows attackers to identify additional resources that can be 
compromised. 
V¢I Even encrypted networks have been shown to disclose vital information in 
cleartext, such as the network name, that can be received by attackers sniffing 
the WLAN. 
Vii Any authentication information that is broadcast can often be simply replayed 
to services requiring authentication (NT Domain, WEP authentication, and so 
on) to access resources. 
V,-¢I The use of virtual private networks, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), and Secure 
Shell (SSH) helps protect against wireless interception. 
Due to the design of Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol 
(TCP/IP), there is little that you can do to prevent MAC/IP address spoofing. 
Static definition of MAC address tables can prevent this type of attack. 
However, due to significant overhead in management, this is rarely 
implemented. 

Wireless Technologies • Chapter 4

.... 
g------d Wireless network authentication can be easily spoofed by simply replaying 
another node's authentication back to the AP when attempting to connect to 
the network. 
V'd Many wireless equipment providers allow for end users to redefine the MAC 
........................................................................................................ 
address for their cards through the configuration utilities that come with the 
equipment. 
[-----d External two-factor authentication such as Remote Access Dial-In User 
Service (RADIUS) or SecurID should be implemented to additionally restrict 
access requiring strong authentication to access the wireless resources. 
Due to the design of TCP/IR some spoof attacks allow for attackers to hijack 
or take over network connections established for other resources on the 
wireless network. 
~I If an attacker hijacks the AP, all traffic from the wireless network gets routed 
through the attacker, so the attacker can then identify passwords and other 
information that other users are attempting to use on valid network hosts. 
F-4I Many users are susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks, often entering their 
....

authentication information even after receiving many notifications that SSL or 
other keys are not what they should be. 
1-41 Rogue APs can assist the attacker by allowing remote access from wired or 
, 
wireless networks. These attacks are often overlooked as just faults in the user s 
machine, allowing attackers to continue hijacking connections with little fear 
of being noticed. 
[-¢I Many wireless networks that use the same frequency within a small space can 
easily cause network disruptions and even denial of service (DOS) for valid 
network users. 
V--d 
gl 
If an attacker hijacks the AP and does not pass traffic on to the proper 
destination, all users of the network will be unable to use the network. 
Flooding the wireless network with transmissions can prevent other devices 
from utilizing the resources, making the wireless network inaccessible to valid 
network users.

Wireless attackers can utilize strong and directional antennas to attack the 
wireless network from a great distance. 
An attacker who has access to the wired network can flood the wireless AP 
with more traffic than it can handle, preventing wireless users from accessing 
the wired network.

network. 
Computers for Wireless Network Security 
[:'-'4I Windows XP provides support for 802.1x protection on wireless networking 
connections. 
[-4I Windows XP integrated wireless networking into the operating system to a 
high degree. Windows XP takes control of your network connection in most 
cases. 
[-4I Windows 2000 does not offer the high degree of integrated wireless 
networking that Windows XP does. 
IEI Both Windows 2000 and Windows XP can support WEP 64 and WEP 128 as 
well as any third-party solutions on the market. 
Site Surveys 
Tools used in site surveys include wireless sniffers, directional or parabolic dish 
antennas, and GPS receivers. 
1-41 Wireless sniffers that can be used in a site survey include the Windows/based 
NetStumbler and the UNIX/Linux-based Kismet or ethereal. 
Site surveys are used to map out the extent to which wireless networks are 
visible outside the physical boundaries of the buildings in which their 
components are installed.

Q. How can I protect my wireless network from eavesdropl 
by unauthorized indi-

A" Because wireless devices are half-duplex devices, you cannot wholly prevent your 
wireless traffic from being listened to by unauthorized individuals. The only defense 
against eavesdropping is to encrypt layer 2 and higher traffic whenever possible. 
Q" Are wireless networks secure? 
A" By their very nature and by definition, wireless networks are not secure. They can, 
however, be made relatively safe from the point of view of security through adminis- 
trative effort to encrypt traffic, to implement restrictive methods for authenticating 
and associating with wireless networks, and so on.

Q" My access point does not support the disabling of SSID broadcasts. Should I pur- 
chase a new one? 
A" Disabling SSID broadcasts adds only one barrier for the potential hacker. Wireless 
networks can still be made relatively safe even if the AP does respond with its SSID 
to a beacon probe. Disabling SSID broadcasts is a desirable feature. However, before 
you go out and purchase new hardware, check to see if you can update the firmware 
of your AR The AP vendor may have released a more recent firmware version that 
supports the disabling of SSID broadcasts. If your AP doesn't support firmware 
updates, consider replacing it with one that does. 
Q: Why is WEP insecure? 
A: WEP is insecure for a number of reasons. The first is that 24-bit initialization vector 
(IV) is too short. Because a new IV is generated for each frame and not for each ses- 
sion, the entire IV key space can be exhausted on a busy network in a matter of 
hours, resulting in the reuse of IVs. Second, the t<C4 algorithm used by WEP has 
been shown to use a number of weak keys that can be exploited to crack the 
encryption. Third, because WEP is implemented at layer 2, it encrypts TCP/IP 
traffic, which contains a high percentage of well-known and predictable informa- 
tion, making it vulnerable to plaintext attacks.

Q: How can I prevent unauthorized users from authenticating and associating with my 
access point? 
A: There are a number of ways to accomplish this.You can configure your access point 
as a closed system by disabling SSID broadcasts and choosing a hard-to-guess SSID. 
You can configure MAC filtering to allow only those clients that use valid MAC 
addresses access to the AP.You can enable WEP and Shared Key authentication. 
However, all of these methods do not provide acceptable levels of assurance for cor- 
porate networks that have more restrictive security requirements than are usually 
found in SOHO environments. For corporate environments that require a higher 
degree of assurance, you should configure 802.1X authentication.

Chapter 5 • OSI Model 
Introduction 
To prepare for the CompTIA Network+ exam, you should begin by reviewing the 
foundations of networking. Among these, you must understand the logical models on 
which networks are designed and created, the protocols they use to communicate, the 
addressing schemes by which they identify individual devices on the network, and the 
technologies they use to ensure that data reaches its destination. In this chapter, we will 
cover the OSI (Open Systems Interconnect) model in depth and then begin the discus- 
sion on TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol). Both are covered in 
great detail on the exam and need to be completely understood before sitting the exam 
if you want success. 
The vast majority of networks today (including the Internet) use TCP/IP to 
transmit information among computers and networks in a wide area network (WAN). 
Together, TCP and IP are referred to as a protocol stack or as network/transport proto- 
cols because they work together at two different levels (called the Network and 
Transport layers) to enable computers to communicate with each other. This is impor- 
tant because TCP/IR like other protocol suites (groupings) such as IPX/SPX (Internet 
Packet Exchange/Sequenced Packet Exchange), are arranged as suites of protocols that 
provide different functionality. If you want to send an e-mail to someone today, you will 
most likely need IP communications to establish communication and complete the 
transmission of the message. The models and the protocols (as you will see), tie very 
closely together, and that is why it's hard to discuss one without the other. As a matter of 
fact, no matter how long you are in networking you will find the OSI model is refer- 
enced on a daily basis all the way from the beginning student to a networking master. 
In this chapter, we'll look at the networking models that provide guidelines for ven- 
dors of networking products, including the early Department of Defense (DoD) model 
as well as the International Organization of Standardization (ISO) OSI model. 
Next, we'll move into some fundamentals of TCP/IR although in this chapter we 
only start to touch on the protocol suite. The majority of TCP/IP fundamentals will be 
covered in Chapter 6.You'll also learn about the individual components ofTCP/IR a 
suite of protocols that are used throughout the network communication process to 
ensure that data sent from a computer reaches its intended destination. Now, let's start to 
pick apart the networking models and understand why they are so important. 
Understanding the Purpose 
and Function of Networking Models 
This chapter discusses several specific networking models, so it's important to begin our 
discussion with an overview of the purpose and function of networking models. Just 
about everywhere we look in the world today we can see examples of agreed-upon 
rules that help people work together more effectively and efficiently to achieve a specific

aim. This is especially true in the world of technology where standards, specifications, 
and protocols are used to accomplish a particular task. Why is it you can pop a DVD in 
your player and watch it, regardless of who made the DVD, the DVD player, or the tele- 
vision? It's because everyone involved agreed to certain parameters such as the circum- 
ference of the DVD disk, the method of recording and reading the DVD, and the 
interface between the DVD player and the television. 
The same is true in computer technology. A wide variety of methods can be used to 
transmit and receive data across a network. Models are used to broadly define the 
required elements. This helps break down complex tasks into more manageable seg- 
ments. It also provides frameworks from which standards can be developed. Organizing 
networking tasks in this way provides standardization, which is critical for any tech- 
nology to be widely adopted. It also reduces development time and cost because 
common tasks are defined and can be implemented without "reinventing the wheel." An 
excellent example of an organization dedicated to providing solid standards for net- 
working is the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers), which will be 
covered shortly within this chapter. 
The Department of Defense networking model was originally created to solve the 
problem of people needing to share information across large computer systems. That 
model was used as the basis for an expanded model known as the OSI model. In the 
next section of the text we will cover the DoD model. Although the exam primarily 
focuses on the OSI model, you should still be familiar with its existence and how it 
maps to the OSI model. 
Understanding the Department 
of Defense Networking Model 
In the mid-1960s, computer systems were huge mainframes that were all owned and 
maintained by large companies, universities, and governmental agencies. Users, especially 
in the academic, scientific, and governmental arenas, often needed to share data with 
other users. The problem was that mainframe computers all ran different proprietary 
software, and operating systems could not easily communicate with one another. In 
order to share data, programmers had to write code that would allow one mainframe to 
communicate with another specific mainframe. 
This cumbersome one-to-one process was prohibitive, both in terms of the time and 
cost required to develop unique, proprietary solutions, and in terms of the limitations 
those solutions often imposed. After an interface was written, that mainframe still could 
communicate only with its specified counterpart. If either mainframe's operating system 
changed, the interface might be broken and programmers would have to be called back 
in to re-establish the communication system between the two mainframes. 
The U.S. Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) 
tackled this problem with an experiment designed to demonstrate a way to share com- 
puter data across a wide area. This experiment was called A1KPANET (Advanced 

250 
Chapter 5 • OSl Model 
Research Projects Agency Network), and it became the foundation for what we know 
today as the Internet. It also resulted in the development of the TCP/IP protocols the 
late 1960s. TCP/IP is one of the few computer technologies from the 1960s that is still 
in prominent use today~a testament to the superb design of the TCP/IP suite. 
Although it has undergone some modifications over time, TCP/IP is still the protocol 
suite of choice for almost all large networks and for global connectivity to the Internet, 
which relies on TCP/IP. 
The DARPA architecture, known as the DARPA model or the DoD model, defines 
four layers starting at the network cable (or interface) and working its way up. This 
model can be seen in Figure 5.1. 
Figure 5.1 The Department of Defense Networking Model 
Layer 4 
Application 
Layer 3 
Host to Host (or Transport) 
Layer 2 
Internet (Internetworking) 
Layer 1 
Network Interface 
Each layer is designed with a specific function and together they provide the foun- 
dation for internetworking. Different protocols within the TCP/IP suite work at dif- 
ferent layers, as you'll discover when we examine the individual components of the 
TCP/IP suite. 
Layer One" Network Interface 
The Network Inte~ace layer of the DOD model corresponds to the lowest level of the 
TCP/IP protocol architecture and correlates to Layers 1 and 2 in the OSI model.The 
Network Interface layer provides most of the capabilities provided for in the Physical 
and Data Link layers of the OSI model. 
Let's begin with a brief overview of the hardware involved in the network at this 
level. We have the network medium, which is typically coaxial, fiber optic or twisted- 
pair cabling (although wireless networking is increasing in popularitymsee Chapter 4); 
www.syngress.com 

OSl Model • Chapter 5 
251 
and we have the network interface card (NIC) that has both a physical MAC (Media 
Access Control) address and a logical IP address (we'll discuss the MAC and IP addresses 
a bit later). The NIC has logic (a circuit board and chips) built into it that gives it basic 
functionality. It uses a driver, which is a small software program that interfaces between 
the hardware and the operating system, to provide additional functionality. 
The specifications related to how the network technology is implemented are 
defined by IEEE (called the "Eye-triple E" by industry members). The IEEE helps 
define common standards for use in a variety of technical fields, including computing. 
Although its may seem like humorous trivia, it's absolutely true that the standard known 
as the 802 standard, was named so because the initial committee meeting was in 1980, in 
February (the second month). This standard defines specifications for the lower level 
networking technologies; that is, those at the Physical layer (NIC, connectors, and cables) 
and at the Data Link layer (access methods). 
AM WARNING 
~ 
For the Network+ exam, it's imperative that you understand the IEEE 802 
~/ 
model and its specific standards. Although there are many standards commit- 
'N~: tees, you should definitely focus on the newer ones affecting today's gurrent 
technologies (or areas of technology), such as Ethernet, wireless, and security. 
Most significantly, Ethernet is defined in 802.3, loken Ring in 802.5, and wire- 
less networking in 802.11. 
As you'll see, the standards vary, depending on the network technology (Ethernet, 
Token Ring, Asynchronous Transfer Mode [ATM], and Frame Relay). Because TCP/IP 
works independently of network technology, it can be used with each of these types of 
networks, and can be used to send information between two dissimilar networks as well. 
For more information on the IEEE, you can visit the IEEE at www.ieee.org. 
The standards set by the 802 committee pertaining to networking are as follows: 
[] 
802.1 Internetworking standards that deal with the management of local area 
networks (LANs) and metropolitan area networks (MANs), including bridges 
and the spanning tree algorithm used by bridges to prevent looping. 
[] 
802.2 Logical link control (LLC), and the division of OSI Layer 2 into two 
sublayers, LLC and MAC. 
[] 
802.3 CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection), 
the media access control method used on Ethernet networks, and frame for- 
mats for Ethernet. 
[] 
802.4 Token Bus networks that use 75 ohm coax or fiber optic cabling and 
the token passing access method.

Chapter 5 • OSI Model 
• 
802.5 Token Ring, the technology developed by IBM that uses a physical star 
and logical ring topology with twisted-pair cabling (shielded or unshielded) 
and the token passing access method. 
• 
802.6 MANs, networks of a size and scope that falls between that of the LAN 
and the WAN. 
• 
802.7 Broadband transmissions that use Frequency Division Multiplexing 
(FDM), including CATV. 
• 
802.8 Fiber optics networks, including Fiber Distributed Data Interface 
(FDDI) using the token passing access method. 
• 
802.9 Integrated services (voice and data) over ISDN (Integrated Services 
Digital Network).

802.10 Virtual private networking (VPN) to create a secure connection to a 
private network over the public Internet.

802.11 Wireless networking technologies, including the most common 
802.11 b, faster 802.1 la, and newest 802.1 lg wireless communications methods. 
• 
802.12 The 100VG AnyLAN technology developed by Hewlett Packard, 
~vhich uses the demand priority access method. 
Although some of this material may have been covered earlier, knowing it is 
imperative to passing the test, and repetition builds your ability to recall infor- 
mation when needed. The 802 standards need to be committed to memory, as 
you will definitely need to know them come exam time. 
Media Access Control 
Media access control refers to the method used to allocate use of the medium among 
the computers and devices on the network. The media access control method performs a 
function similar to the chairperson of a meeting, whose responsibility it is to recognize 
each speaker in turn and keep everyone from talking at once. 
In networking, access control is important only when many devices share a common 
medium, such as a coaxial cable or twisted-pair cable--and then it is very important. 
Various schemes have been devised to control access to the media by the connected 
devices. If no methods were in place, all devices would send data whenever it suited 
• them. On a small network, this might not be a problem, but if there are more than a few 
devices, it quickly causes congestion, collisions, and errors because everybody's talking at 
once. Therefore, as the size of the typical network grew, it was important to develop 
www.syngress.com 

OSI Model • Chapter 5 
253 
standard methods to control access to the shared media so that communication would 
proceed in an orderly and predictable manner. The access control method lays out rules 
defining how access is allocated, just as Robert's Rules of Order govern how meetings 
proceed (to see Robert's Rules of Order, visit www.constitution.org/rror/rror~ 
00.htm). 
Media Access Control is performed by MAC layer protocols. Although there are 
many different MAC protocols for a wide variety of media used by many different com- 
munications technologies (cellular, cable TV, satellite, etc.), we're going to concentrate on 
those that are most common in computing today. These include: 
• 
CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection) 
• 
CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance) 
• 
Token passing 
These will be discussed in detail later in this chapter. 
Network Inte ace Hardware~Software 
The network interface is established through the NIC. Each type of NIC uses a different 
type of connector to connect to the physical medium. The connector types are delin- 
eated in the IEEE 802 specifications. Each network technology is delineated in its own 
section of the 802 specification, as described previously. Again, most significantly, 
Ethernet is defined in 802.3, Token Ring in 802.5, and wireless networking in 802.11. 
The NIC employs both hardware and software in connecting the device to the net- 
work media. The TCP/IP Network Interface layer defines protocols used by the NIC to 
receive, assemble, address, and transmit. For example, most Ethernet networks in use 
today employ an Ethernet NIC, which, among other things, uses CSMA/CD to control 
media access.The most common type of Ethernet NIC uses a Category 5 or greater 
unshielded twisted pair cable (typically referred to as UTP CAT5, CAT5e, or CAT6) 
with specified pin connections. In some cases (although not very common anymore by 
today's standards), Ethernet is still deployed occasionally over thin (1/4 inch diameter) or 
thick (1/2 inch diameter) coaxial cable. 
Ethernet can also be deployed over fiber optic cable. Regardless of the cable type, 
Ethernet networks use the same contention-based access control method. 
UTP cabling connects to the NIC via an RJ-45 modular plug and jack (similar to a 
large phone jack), and thin coax (thinner) connects via a BNC connector (Bayonet Neill 
Concelman, after its twist-on style and the two men who invented it) shaped like a T. 
Thick coax (thicknet) is connected via a vampire tap (a metal pin that penetrates the 
cable) to an external transceiver, which in turn connects to the NIC. Other types of 
Ethernet NICs have the transceiver built onto the NIC itself. Some NICs (seen in older 
PC deployments), called combo cards, have connectors for more than one type of cable. 
The Ethernet NIC is also responsible for receiving/sending and assembling/disas- 
sembling data to and from the network connection. The Network Interface layer in the

..... ~:iiiiii~:~ ....... 
on the Network+ exam, historical in that it covers technologies that are not com- 
monly installed anymore, but are definitely commonly removed, migrated, 
upgraded, or replaced. Prevalent in older renditions of the exam was the need to 
know about things that were very common to older networking topologies such 
as coaxial cabling, 10Base5, 10Base2 technologies, Bus networking topologies, 
and so on. It still holds true today that you should know about these technologies 
for the exam, so do not overlook studying for them. 
Layer Two" Internet (or Internetworking) 
The next layer in the DARPA model is the Internet layer, which maps to the Network 
layer of the OSI model. The Internet layer, so called because of the addressing scheme 
that makes communications possible across a network of networks, or internetwork, is 
responsible for packaging, addressing, and routing the data. When this layer was origi- 
nally conceived, the Internet as we know it today did not exist. The concept behind this 
layer was to define a framework for two computers to connect to one another to share 
data. This laid the foundation for widespread internetworking, which led to what we 
now know as the Internet. 
Before data can be sent out over the network interface, it must have a standard 
format, size, and addressing scheme. The Network Interface layer is responsible only for 
taking the data it is given and translating it into signals on a physical medium. The 
Internet layer defines packet structure (what each bit of a data segment means), 
addressing, and routing. 
Layer Three" Host-to-Host (or Transport) 
Layer 3 in the DARPA model is the Host-to-Host Transport layer, sometimes called the 
Transport layer since this layer maps to the Transport layer (Layer 4) in the OSI model. As 
the name implies, this layer is responsible for transporting the data. It sets up communi- 
cations between the Application layer and the lower layers. The Internet layer is respon- 
sible for formatting, addressing, and routing the data, and the Host-to-Host Transport 
layer is responsible for setting up the connection between hosts so that formatted data 
can be sent. 

OSl Model • Chapter 5 
255 
Because this layer establishes a connection, it can also take on some of the responsi- 
bilities of the Session layer of the OSI model. In TCP/IE the two core protocols used at 
the Host-to-Host Transport layer are TCP and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). TCP is 
a more complex protocol that provides reliable data transport~the application sending 
the data receives acknowledgement that the data was received. UDP is a much simpler 
protocol that does not provide acknowledgement messages. Although this makes UDP 
data transport less reliable, it is a very useful protocol in certain applications where fast, 
simple communication is required. Both of these protocols are discussed in detail later in 
this chapter. 
Layer Four" Application 
The Application layer of the DARPA model operates at the Session, Presentation, and 
Application layers of the OSI model. One of the main reasons why the DoD model is 
still used when referencing TCP/IP is because the TCP/IP protocol suite's protocols 
(such as FTP, Telnet and so on) do not map perfectly into the OSI model, They have 
overlap, and this is why you will see three OSI model layers under one layer in the DoD 
model. The DoD model's Application layer enables applications to communicate with 
one another and it provides access to the services of the other underlying layers 
(Network Interface [1], Internet [2], and Host-to-Host Transport [3]).There are wide 
varieties of Application layer protocols, and more are continually being developed 
because they can rely on all the services beneath them. If you think of how your com- 
puter's software is configured, you will realize that you use many different applications 
that rely upon the services of the underlying operating system. Each application does 
not have to provide duplicate services, such as a routine for accessing your disk drive. 
That is provided by the operating system and the application utilizes that functionality. 
This is how the Application layer of the networking model works as well. It relies upon 
the underlying services. In this way, developers do not have to write code continually to 
provide the underlying functionality, but can simply access that functionality by adhering 
to agreed-upon standards and specifications. We'll look at a number of Application layer 
protocols when we look at TCP/IP in detail. 
We've discussed the four layers of the DARPA or DoD model of internetworking. 
Throughout this discussion, we've mentioned the OSI model. Now, let's take an in- 
depth look at the OSI model to understand how the OSI model expands upon the 
functionality defined in the DARPA model.

The OSI model was originally developed at Honeywell in the ~d-1970s, and expanded 
upon the DAI:LPA model. In 1977, the International Organization for Standardization 
~ 
recognized the need to develop a co~unication standard for computing. They formed 
a subcommittee called the Open Systems Interconnection co~ttee, and asked for pro- 
posals for a communication standard. HoneyweU's solution, called distributed systems

architecture (DSA), included seven layers for communications. This framework was 
adopted by the OSI, and is still used as the model for distributed communications. The 
OSI model is shown in Figure 5.2.

WARNING 
Knowing the OSI model is imperative. You will need to know which devices and 
protocols function at each layer, so you need to know the layers to start with. 
~,ili ! Continue to draw the model shown in Figure 5.2 so that when you get to the 
i!iiiiiiiiiiiiiii exam, you can write it on scrap paper to help you with the exam. 
We'll explore each of the seven layers of the OSI model in the following subsec- 
tions. The first two layers of the OSI model involve both hardware and software. In the 
five upper layers (Layers 3 through 7), the OSI model typically is implemented via soft- 
ware only.

remember the seven layers of the OSI model is All People Seem To Need Data 
Processing. This equates to Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, 
Network, Data Link, and Physical. By remembering this acronym, you'll easily 
remember the seven layers (in reverse order). Remember that numbering starts 
at the bottom of the model. 
More commonly, the Network+ exam requires you to know and understand 
what happens at each layer, and which protocols operate there (rather than just 
rote memorization of the layers themselves) in order to be able to troubleshoot 
common networking problems. 
The OSI model is represented as a stack because data that is sent across the network 
has to move through each layer at both the sending and receiving ends. The sending 
computer generally initiates the process at the Application layer. The data is then sent 
down the stack to the Physical layer and across the network to the receiving computer. 
On the receiving end, the data is received at the Physical layer and the data packet is 
sent up the stack to the Application layer. A good visualization of this can be seen in 
Figure 5.3, where Computer A wants to browse a website home page of Server B, such 
as www. syngress, com/index.htm.

Chapter 5 • OSI Model 
To view how this works, consider these facts. The home page index.htm is the file 
that is located in a folder (or directory) on the Web server, and this is what computer A 
wants to view. Computer A is connected to an ISP (Internet Service Provider) via a 
home PC, a NIC, a cable modem or whatever the ISP requires for connectivity. 
Computer A opens a Web browser (which is an application), the Web browser (not 
needing to know anything other than to make a request to the Web server), sends the 
request, and underlying protocols process it. The Application layer (not to be associated 
with the application itself), starts the process. Encapsulation (addition of small pieces of 
information relative to the transmission of information) happens at each layer, with each 
layer adding its information to the data to get it to the Web server, and then reversing 
the process to get information back again. As you can see, you only see the request; the 
Web server will answer back with index.htm. The beauty of this depiction is that it is 
very easy to see and clearly understand why you absolutely need to know the OSI 
model and what happens at each layer.

Again, knowing the OSI model information provides a foundation for you to grow 
and build on. Let's now dig into the specifics of each layer starting from the lowest layer, 
the layer that makes use of the physical transmission medium, the Physical Layer. 
Layer 1" Physical 
The first, most basic layer of the OSI model is the Physical layer. This layer specifies the 
electrical and mechanical requirements for transmitting data bits across the transmission 
medium (cable or airwaves). It involves sending and receiving the data stream on the 
carrier~whether that carrier uses electrical (cable), light (fiber optic) or radio, infrared 
or laser (wireless) signals. The Physical layer specifications include: 
• 
Voltage changes 
• 
Timing of voltage changes 
• 
Data rates 
m 
Maximum transmission distances 
• 
Physical connectors to the transmission medium 
• 
Topology or physical layout of the network 
Many complex issues are addressed at the Physical layer, including digital versus 
analog signaling, baseband versus broadband signaling, whether data is transmitted syn- 
chronously or asynchronously, and how signals are divided into channels (multiplexing). 
Devices that operate at the Physical layer deal with signaling, such as the transceivers 
on the NIC, and the basic and simple connectors that join segments of cable. 
Digital Versus Analog Signaling 
These days, in the "digital age", there is hardly a day that goes by without the need sur- 
facing for some form of electricity in your life. So what is this analog signaling and why 
so much concern? Well, because as a Network+ technician, you will need to understand 
how different types of technology work, and the perfect example to drive this home 
would be the modem, a device that a great many people utilize every day to access the 
Internet via their standard preexisting telephone lines. 
A modem is a device that Mo... (Modulates) Dem... (Demodulates) a signal, or in 
easier to understand terms.., the modem translates an analog system signal to a digital 
system signal and back again so that the signal can traverse along the plain old telephone

Chapter 5 • OSI Model 
service (POTS). It should then make sense to the PCs sending and receiving it, as the 
modem does the PC the favor of taking that analog signal and translating it into a digital 
one, which is what your PC natively understands. 
 00i 
~M 
WARNING 
"~T'~{ Modems translate analog to digital signals and back again. PCs are using digital 
~ili~ technology to communicate, but the phone lines are using analog signaling. 
@'i~i~ Therefore, the signal must be changed from one signaling method to the other 
as needed, such as when you want to connect your PC up to your ISP and surf 
the Internet. 
So what is analog? Analog signals are electronic signals that are based on a wave that 
moves up and down continuously (as shown in Figure 5.5). A more technical definition 
of this technology is that analog signals are electronic signals that are transmitted by 
adding a signal of varying frequency or amplitude to a carrier wave of a given frequency 
of alternating electromagnetic current. For the Network+ exam, don't worry too much 
about the technical jargon here.., understanding how this functions will help you to 
understand what the Physical layer of the OSI model is responsible for.., and why.

today in technology utilizes analog anymore: most if not all of it winds up in digital 
format. Digital communications are more compatible with PCs because that's how PCs 
operate, via digital technology. Digital signals are more reliable and easier to transmit. For 
this reason it should be clear as to why digital is so important to understand and learn. 
As shown in Figure 5.6, you should see that since computers operate on ls and 0s, dig- 
ital (either being on or off, like a light switch if you will) fits binary math perfectly. 1 or 
0, on or off. Now that you have seen both signaling methods, let's move on to possible 
issues based on digital technology.

Issues like attenuation (degradation of the signal) can really ruin digital communica- 
tions. For example, if you were installing a PC over 150 meters away from the concen- 
trator it is connected to, (10BaseT technologies have a maximum allowed distance of 
about 100 meters or 328 feet), the signal is likely to degrade (Figure 5.7).

As Figure 5.7 shows, because the signal has degraded, the ones and zeros become 
"unknowns" because they fall short of being either a 1 or 0. This example demonstrates 
how exceeding maximum cable distances will in fact cause you issues later on.

sure you understand the following: 
Baseband is a method of data transmission where all bandwidth on the 
transmission medium is used to transmit a single digital signal. As you saw in 
Figure 5.6, Baseband technology uses digital signaling. 
Broadband is a method of data transmission where the bandwidth on the 
transmission medium is broken into channels that are capable of supporting a 
wide range of frequencies. 
Make sure you are comfortable with the terminology and that you under- 
stand what each is and does. It will be important to understand, as you learn 
about 10BaseT, the Base stands for Baseband. 10BaseT runs at 10 Mbps, it has a 
100 Meter limit on distance. The T is for twisted-pair cabling. 
In sum, when dealing with the Physical layer, the data handled is in bits~literally ls 
and 0s.These ls and 0s are represented by pulses of light or electricity (on generally rep- 
resents a 1 and off generally represents a 0). How these bits are arranged and managed is 
a function of the next layer in the OSI model.

Layer 2" Data Link 
Layer 2 is the Data Link layer. This layer is responsible for maintaining the data link 
- 
between two computers, typically called hosts or nodes. It also defines and manages the 
ordering of bits to and from data segments, called packets. Frames contain data arranged 
in an organized manner, which provides for an orderly and consistent method of 
sending data bits across the medium. Without such control, the data would be sent in 
random sizes or configurations and the data that was sent on one end could not be 
decoded on the other end. The Data Link layer manages the physical addressing and syn- 
chronization of the data packets (as opposed to the logical addressing that is handled at 
the Network layer). The Data Link layer is also responsible for flow control and error 
notification. Flow control is the process of managing the timing of sending and 
receiving data so that it doesn't exceed the capacity (speed, memory, etcetera) of the 
physical connection. Since the Physical layer is responsible only for physically moving 
the data onto and off of the network medium, the Data Link layer also receives and 
manages error messaging related to physical delivery of packets. 
Network devices that operate at this layer include Layer 2 switches (switching hubs) 
and bridges. A Layer 2 switch decreases network congestion by sending data out only on 
the port to which the destination computer is attached, instead of sending it out on all 
ports, as a physical layer hub does. Bridges provide a way to segment a network into two 
parts and filter traffic by building tables that define which computers are located on 
which side of the bridge, based on their MAC addresses. 
The Data Link layer is divided into two sublayers: the Logical Link Control (LLC) 
sublayer and the Media Access Control sublayer. These were originally seen in the OSI 
model diagram in Figure 5.2. 
The LLC Sublayer 
The LLC sublayer provides the logic for the data link, thus it controls the synchroniza- 
tion, flow control, and error checking functions of the Data Link layer. This layer can 
handle connection-oriented transmissions (unlike the MAC sublayer below it), although 
connectionless service can also be provided by this layer. Connectionless operations are 
known as Class I LLC, whereas Class II can handle either connectionless or connection- 
oriented operations. With connection-oriented communication, each LLC frame that is 
sent is acknowledged. The LLC sublayer at the receiving end keeps up with the LLC 
frames it receives (these are also called Protocol Data Units or PDUs), and if it detects 
that a frame has been lost during the transmission, it can send back a request to the 
sending computer to start the transmission over again, beginning with the PDU that 
never arrived. 
The LLC sublayer sits above the MAC sublayer, and acts as a liaison between the 
upper layers and the protocols that operate at the MAC sublayer such as Ethernet, Token 
Ring, and so on (IEEE standards). The LLC sublayer itself is defined by IEEE 802.2. 

264 
Chapter 5 • OSI Model 
Link addressing, sequencing, and definition of Service Access Points (SAPs) also take 
place at this layer. 
Tke MAC Sublayer 
The MAC sublayer provides control for accessing the transmission medium. It is respon- 
sible for moving data packets from one NIC to another, across a shared transmission 
medium such as an Ethernet or fiber optic transmission medium. 
Physical addressing is addressed at the MAC sublayer. Every NIC has a unique MAC 
address, also called the physical address, which identifies that specific NIC on the net- 
work. The MAC address of a NIC is usually burned into a read-only memory (ROM) 
chip on the NIC. Each manufacturer of network cards is provided a unique set of MAC 
addresses so that (theoretically, at least) every NIC that is manufactured has a unique 
MAC address. Obviously, it would be confusing if there were two or more NICs with 
the same MAC address.A packet intended for NIC #35 (a simplification of the MAC 
address) would not know to which NIC #35 it was destined. To avoid this confusion, 
MAC addresses, in most cases, are permanently burned into the NIC's memory. This is 
sometimes referred to as the Burned-In Address or BIA. 
!iiiiili~llii~ ~ 
~M WARNING 
~iili~i~i !' A MAC address consists of six hexadecimal numbers. The highest possible hex- 
~!!ii!iii! !' adecimal number is FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF, which is a broadcast address. The first three 
bytes contain a manufacturer code and the last three bytes contain a unique sta- 
~iiiiiiii~iii!! tion ID. You must understand the functionality of a NIC card and what a MAC 
address is for the Network+ exam. On Ethernet NICs, the physical or MAC address 
(also called the hardware address) is expressed as 12 hexadecimal digits, arranged 
in pairs with colons between each pair, for example, 12:3A:4D:66:3A:1C. In binary 
notation, this translates to a 48-bit (or 6-byte) number, with the initial three bytes 
representing the manufacturer and the last three bits representing a unique net- 
work interface card made by that manufacturer. On Token Ring NICs, the MAC 
address is six bytes long, too, but the bits of each byte are reversed. That is, 
Ethernet transmits in canonical or LSB (least significant bit) mode, with the least 
significant bit first, whereas Token Ring transmits with the most significant bit 
first (MSB or non-canonical mode). Although duplicate MAC addresses are rare, 
they do show up because some manufacturers have started to use their numbers 
over again. This usually is not a problem because the duplicates almost never 
show up on the same network. Some cards allow you to change the MAC address 
by using special software to "flash" the card's chip. You can view the MAC 
address on most systems with the following commands. 
Windows ME, 9x: winipcfg (navigate the GUI to find the MAC address) 
Windows NT, ×P, 2000, 2003: ipconfig/all 
Linux: ifconfig-a 
On Linux, an Ethernet network interface is commonly seen as eth0. Under 
this information you will find the relevant MAC for your system.

OSl Model • Chapter 5 
265 
Another important issue that's handled at the MAC sublayer is media access control. 
This refers to the method used to allocate network access to computers and prevent 
them from transmitting at the same time, causing data collisions. Common media access 
control methods include Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Detection, used by 
Ethernet networks, Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance, used by 
AppleTalk networks, and token passing, used by Token Ring and FDDI networks. In 
Exercise 5.1, we'll go through the steps of identifying a MAC address on a Windows XP 
Professional system.

Layer 3" Network 
As we travel up the OSI model, the next layer we encounter is the Network layer. At the 
Network layer, packets are sequenced and logical addressing is handled. Logical addresses 
are nonpermanent, software-assigned addresses that can be changed by administrators. 
The IP addresses used by the TCP/IP protocols on the Internet and the IPX addresses 
used by the IPX/SPX protocols on NetWare networks are examples of logical addresses. 
These protocol stacks are referred to as routable because they include addressing schemes 
that identify both the network or subnet and the particular client on that network or 
subnet. Other network/transport protocols, such as NetBEUI, do not have a sophisti- 
cated addressing scheme (nor the programming intelligence of high OSI model layers 
such as Network Layer and Transport Layer) thus crippling it and not allowing it to be 
routed across different networks. To make sure you understand what is meant by this, 
view Figure 5.8. Here, you see a network subdivided by different IP subnets (this will be 
covered in greater depth in Chapter 6).

You can see that each LAN is connected to each other to via a WAN, using Frame 
Relay (both of which will be covered in depth in Chapter 7). The most critical fact here 
is that all of this logical addressing and routing are done at the Network layer of the OSI 
model. Each subnet must be unique, and each LAN will need to know how to get to 
the other LANs. That's where the WAN and the routers come in, acting as the default 
gateway for your network. Also, you need to understand that logical addressing (such as 
the 10.1.1.1 255.255.255.0 address being assigned to the router on the LAN as the 
default gateway), is important~it defines how and where the packets are sent, and so 
on. So, now that you have assigned the IP address, how does the MAC address tie in? 
Well, a TCP/IP protocol called ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) will help map an IP 
address to a physical machine address.

OSI Model • Chapter 5 
267 
t.., '~ ~ TE 
To understand the difference between physical and logical addresses, consider 
this analogy: If you buy a house, it has a physical address that identifies exactly 
where it is located on the earth, at a specific latitude and longitude. This never 
changes (unless you have a mobile home that can be moved from one plot of 
land to another). This is like the MAC address on a NIC. Your house also has a 
logical address assigned to it by the post office, consisting of a street number 
and street name. The city can (and occasionally does) change the names of 
streets, or renumber the houses located on them. This is like the IP address 
assigned to a network interface. 
The Network layer is also responsible for creating a virtual circuit (a logical connec- 
tion, not a physical connection) between points or nodes. A node is a device that has a 
MAC address, which typically includes computers, printers, and routers. This layer is also 
responsible for routing, Layer 3 switching (which is nothing more than a Layer 2 switch 
with a Layer 3 router built into it), and the forwarding of packets. 
Routing refers to forwarding packets from one network or subnet to another. 
Without routing, computers can communicate only with other computers that are on 
the same network via A1KP broadcasts. Routing makes it possible for computers to send 
data through many networks to other computers that are on the other side of the world. 
Routing is the key to the global Internet, and is one of the most important duties of the 
Network layer. Easy to remember, routing is simple to understand. If you start with a 
LAN that has the 10.1.1.0 255.255.255.0 network, and you wanted to get to the 
10.1.2.0 255.255.255.0 network (which has a different network number in the third 
octet) you would need a router with a routing table (so it knows where to send the 
packet) to get it there. 
Finally, the Network layer provides additional levels of flow control and error con- 
trol. As mentioned earlier, from this point on, the primary methods of implementing the 
OSI model architecture involve software rather than hardware. 
Devices that operate at this layer include, most prominently, routers and Layer 3 
switches.

268 
Chapter 5 • OSI Model 
Layer 4" Transport 
Layer 4 is the Transport layer. As the name implies, it is responsible for transporting the 
data from one node to another. It provides transparent data transfer between nodes and 
manages the end-to-end flow control, error detection, and error recovery. 
The Transport layer protocols initiate contact between host computers and set up a 
virtual circuit. The transport protocols on each host computer verify that the application 
sending the data is authorized to access the network and that both ends are ready to ini- 
tiate the data transfer. When this synchronization is complete, the data can be sent. As 
the data is being transmitted, the transport protocol on each host monitors the data flow 
and watches for transport errors. If transport errors are detected, the transport protocol 
can provide error recovery. 
The functions performed by the Transport layer are very important to network 
communication. Just as the Data Link layer provides lower level reliability and connec- 
tion-oriented or connectionless communications, the Transport layer does the same 
thing at a higher level. In fact, the two protocols most commonly associated with the 
Transport layer are defined by their connection state: The Transmission Control Protocol 
is connection-oriented, whereas the User Datagram Protocol is connectionless. 
www.syngress.com 

OSI Model • Chapter 5 
269 
What else does the Transport layer do? It handles another aspect of logical 
addressing: ports. If you think of a computer's IP address as analogous to the street 
address of a building, you can think of a port as a suitenumber or apartment number 
within that building. It further defines exactly where the data should go. 
A computer might have several network applications running at the same time: a Web 
browser sending a request to a Web server for a Web page, an e-mail client sending and 
receiving mail, and a file transfer program uploading or downloading information to and 
from an FTP server. There must be some mechanism to determine which incoming data 
packets belong to which application, and that's the function of port numbers. The FTP 
protocol used by that program is assigned a particular port, whereas the Web browser and 
e-mail clients use different protocols (HTTP and POP3 [Post Office Protocol] or IMAP 
[Internet Message Access Protocol]) that have their own assigned ports. Thus the informa- 
tion that is intended for the Web browser doesn't go to the e-mail program by mistake. 
Port numbers are used by the Transport layer protocols (TCP and UDP). 
Finally, the Transport layer deals with name resolution. Because human beings prefer 
to identify computers by names instead of IP addresses (after all, it's easier to remember 
"www.microsoft.com" for Microsoft's Web server than "207.46.249.222", for example), 
but computers know only how to interpret numbers (and binary numbers, at that), there 
must be a way for names to be matched with numerical addresses so that people and 
computers don't drive one another crazy. Name resolution methods such as the Domain 
Name System (DNS) solve this problem, and they generally operate at the upper layers 
of the OSI model.

Layer 
5" Session 
After the Transport layer has established the virtual connection, a communication session 
can be established. A communication session occurs between two processes on two dif- 
ferent computers. The Session layer is responsible for establishing, monitoring, and termi- 
nating sessions, using the virtual circuits established by the Transport layer. 
The Session layer is also responsible for putting header information into data packets 
to indicate where the message begins and ends. Once header information is attached to 
the data packets, the Session layer performs synchronization between the sender's Session 
layer and the receiver's Session layer. The use of acknowledgement messages (ACKs) 
helps coordinate transfer of data at the Session layer. 
A very important function of the Session layer is controlling whether the communica- 
tions within a Session are sent as full duplex or half duplex messages. Half duplex commu- 
nication goes in both directions between the communicating computers, but information 
can travel in only one direction at a time (as with walkie-talkie radio communications, in 
which you have to hold down the microphone button to transmit and cannot hear the 
person on the other end when you do). With full duplex communication, information can 
be sent in both directions at the same time (as in a regular telephone conversation, in 
which both parties can talk and hear one another at the same time). 
Whereas the Transport layer establishes a connection between two machines, the 
Session layer establishes a connection between two processes. A process is a defined task 
related to an application. An application may run many processes simultaneously to 
accomplish the work of the application. These processes are small executable files that 
together do the work required by the application.You can view the processes running 
on your Windows-based computer by pressing CTL+ALT+DEL, selecting Task 
Manager, and then clicking the Processes tab.You'll notice you have far more pro- 
cesses running than applications since each application typically runs more than one 
process at a time. 
The Session layer, then, is responsible for setting up the connection between an 
application process on one computer and an application process on another computer, 
after the Transport layer has established the connection between the two machines.

There are a number of important protocols that operate at the Session layer, 
including Windows Sockets (the Winsock interface) and NetBIOS (the Network Basic 
Input/Output interface). 
Layer 6" Presentation 
Data translation is the primary activity of Layer 6, the Presentation layer. When data is 
sent from sender to receiver, the data is translated at the Presentation layer. The sender's 
application passes data down to the Presentation layer, where it is put into a common 
format. When the data is received on the other end, the Presentation layer changes the 
data from the common format back into a format that is usable by the application. 
Protocol translation, the conversion of data from one protocol to another so that it can 
be exchanged between computers that use different platforms or operating systems, takes 
place here. 
This is the layer at which many gateway services operate. Gateways are connection 
points between networks that use different platforms or applications. Examples include 
e-mail gateways (which allow for communications between two different e-mail pro- 
grams using a common protocol such as SMTP [Simple Mail Transfer Protocol]), 
Systems Network Architecture (SNA) gateways (which allow PCs to communicate with 
mainframe computers), and gateways that cross platforms or file systems (for example, 
allowing Microsoft clients that use the Server Message Block protocol for file sharing to 
access files on NetWare servers that use NetWare Core Protocol). Gateways are usually 
implemented via software, such as the Gateway Services for NetWare (GSNW). Software 
redirectors also operate at this layer. 
This layer is also where data compression can take place, to minimize the actual 
number of bits that must be transmitted on the network media to the receiver. Data 
encryption and decryption take place in the Presentation layer as well. 
Layer 7" Application 
The Application layer is the point at which the user application program interacts with 
the network. This layer of the OSI model should not be confused with the application 
itself. This is very important to understand and remember, as they share the same name. 
Application processes, such as file transfers or e-mail, are initiated within a user applica- 
tion (for example, an e-mail program). Then the data created by that process are handed 
to the Application layer of the networking software. Everything that occurs at this level 
is application-specific. File sharing, remote printer access, network monitoring and man- 
agement, remote procedure calls (1KPCs), and all forms of electronic messaging occur at 
this level. 
Both FTP (a common way of transferring files across a network) and Telnet function 
within the Application layer, as do SMTR POP3, and IMAP4, all of which are used for 
sending or receiving e-mail. There are many other Application layer protocols, including 
HTTP, Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP), and Simple Network Management 
Protocol (SNMP).

272 
Chapter 5 • OSI Model 
Be sure to distinguish between the protocols mentioned and applications that may 
bear the same names. There are many different FTP programs made by different software 
vendors, but all of them use the FTP protocol to transfer files.

exam. It is especially important to remember that, when troubleshooting, you 
should start with Layer 1 (Physical) and work your way up. A common error 
among technicians and network administrators is starting to troubleshoot at 
Layer 7. Greater detail about troubleshooting with the OSI model can be found 
in Chapter 12, "Network Troubleshooting Methodology". 
Encapsulation of Data 
One last item to cover before we move on to new material is that you should make sure 
you understand what encapsulation is and how it works. Notice that each layer in Figure 
5.9 adds a header to the data packet so that by the time it reaches the Physical layer (the 
last one on the bottom), it is much longer than when it started at the Application layer. 
When data are received by the receiving host, the headers are stripped off as the data 
moves back up the stack, one layer at a time, by the layer that corresponds to the one 
that added it. This means that each layer on the sending computer communicates only 
with the layer of the same name on the receiving machine.

Now that the OSI model has been described for you, let's look at how Microsoft 
maps to this model. As you will see, many of the terms you may have heard in your 
training (such as API and NDIS) will be explained in the next few sections.

~..'~'The information that follows is information only, and not directly related to the 
!!' Network+, but reading it will definitely help you understand some key terms 
~ 
that you are definitely going to see on the Network+ exam, as well as in the 
real world of networking. 
The Microsoft Model 
Prior to the release of Windows NT 3.1, users who wanted to connect to a network 
had to obtain the TCP/IP protocol suite from a third party and install it. TCP/IP did 
not come bundled with the software. At times, the TCP/IP software that was purchased 
didn't work well with the operating system (OS) because it handled various tasks of net- 
work communication in a slightly different way than did the operating system. This 

274 
Chapter 5 • OSI Model 
sometimes led to intermittent network problems or time spent troubleshooting TCP/IP 
and operating system interoperability. 
With the release of Windows NT 3.1, TCP/IP was built into the operating system, 
providing a seamless integration of networking functionality in the OS. Since that time, 
it has become standard to provide TCP/IP with the operating system since so many 
computers today connect to a network in one form or another. 
The Micros@ model provides a standard platform for application developers. Its modular 
design enables the developer to rely on the underlying services of the OS through the use 
of standard interfaces. (Sound familiar to the discussion we had earlier on the DoD and 
OSI models?) These interfaces provide specific functionality developers can use as building 
blocks to develop an application. This makes development time shorter and provides 
common interfaces for users, making learning and using new applications easier. 
Though the Microsoft model is used primarily by programmers, it's important to 
understand the framework of how TCP/IP works on a Microsoft Windows-based 
computer. 
Understanding the Function of Boundary Layers 
The Microsoft model describes software and hardware components and the connections 
between them that facilitate computer networking. This modular approach both allows 
and encourages hardware and software vendors to develop products that work together 
through the Microsoft operating system. Boundary layers are interfaces that reside at the 
boundaries of functionality. They interact with the layer below and the layer above, pro- 
viding an interface from one layer to the next. 
Within each layer, various components perform the tasks defined at that layer. A 
variety of components can provide similar functionality at any given layer. This modular 
approach provides flexibility for developers while providing common interfaces that 
reduce development time and cost. A vendor can provide new functionality at any of 
these layers, knowing their products will integrate with the other layers to provide seam- 
less network communications. The interfaces defined by Microsoft are the Network 
Device Inte~ace Specification (NDIS), Transport Driver Inte~ace (TDI), and the Application 
Program Interface (API). Figure 5.10 shows the relationship of these boundary layers to 
both the OSI model and to the Microsoft Architecture. 
The Windows OS is divided into three primary areas: the User, the Executive, and 
the Kernel. The Kernel is the core of the Microsoft operating system architecture and it 
manages the most basic operations including interacting with the hardware abstraction 
layer that interacts with the hardware (CPU, memory, etcetera). The Kernel also syn- 
chronizes activities with the Executive level, which includes the Input/Output (I/O) 
Manager and the Process Manager. The User level interacts with the Executive level; this 
is the level at which most applications and user interfaces reside.

Tke Network Driver Inte~ace Spec~cation Boundary Layer 
The Network Driver Interface Specification works at the bottom of the networking 
architecture and maps to the Data Link layer of the OSI model and the Network 
Interface layer of the DA1KPA model. The NDIS layer is the boundary between the 
physical network (Physical layer of the OSI model) and the higher-level transport proto- 
cols. This layer provides the standardized functions that allow various transport protocols 
to use any network device driver that is compatible with the specifications of this layer, 
providing both flexibility and reliability to developers. The earliest versions of NDIS 
were developed by a Microsoft and 3Corn joint effort. 
The Transport Driver Interface Boundary Layer 
The Transport Driver Interface provides a portal into the transport protocols for kernel 
mode components such as servers and redirectors. In essence, it is the gateway between 
the Transport layer and the Session layer in the OSI model, providing a common inter- 
face that developers can use to access both Transport and Session layer functionality. 
www.syngress.com 

276 
Chapter 5 • OSl Model 
The Application Program InteoCace Boundary Layer 
The Application Program Interface is the interface through which developers can access 
network infrastructure services such as various Application layer protocols. Dynamic 
Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), DNS, and Windows Internet Name Service 
(WINS) all work at this level and connect to the lower layers through APIs. There are 
also Windows Sockets (WinSock), NetBIOS, telephony, and messaging APIs used to 
assist in carrying out lower level network functions. 
Understanding Component Layers 
Within each layer are component layers that provide very specific functionality. 
The NDIS HZrapp er 
The NDIS wrapper is a library of common NDIS functions that can be used both by 
the MAC protocols beneath it and by TCP/IP above it. The NDIS wrapper is imple- 
mented by a file called Ndis.sys, which is software code that surrounds all NDIS device 
drivers. It provides a common interface for device drivers and protocol drivers. The 
NDIS wrapper is used to reduce platform dependencies during development of network 
interface devices. 
Network Transport Protocols 
Network transport protocols allow all applications or clients to send and receive data 
over the network.Although we're discussing TCP/IP specifically in this chapter, other 
network transport protocols include IPX/SPX, ATM, NetBEUI, Infrared Data 
Association (IrDA), AppleTalk, and SNA. These protocols are used on a variety of non- 
Microsoft operating systems including Novell, Apple, and IBM. 
File System Drivers 
The file system drivers are the redirector and the server service. When there is a request to 
open a shared file, the I/O Manager sends a request to the redirector, which selects the 
appropriate Transport layer protocol via the TDI layer. When there is a request to access a 
local file, the server service responds to requests from the remote redirector and provides 
access to the requested file. Named pipes, mailslots, server service, and redirector are file 
system drivers that work at both the Presentation and Session layers of the OSI model. 
Applications and User Mode Services 
Applications must interface with the lower layer protocols and must interact in some 
manner with the user. These services are implemented in a number of ways, but there 
are four commonly used APIs implemented at this point that provide access to lower 
transport protocols. 
www.syngress.com 

OSI Model • 
Chapter 5 
277 
The WinSock API allows Windows-based applications to communicate with the 
lower layers. Winsock is a protocol-independent networking API that provides standard- 
ized access to datagram and session services over TCP/IE IPX/SPX, AppleTalk, and others. 
Telephony integrates computers with telephone technology and utilizes the 
Telephony API (TAPI) to provide a standardized interface to networking protocols for 
various telephony applications.The NetBIOS API has been used for developing 
client/server applications and is supported in Windows 2003 for backward compatibility. 
The Messaging API (MAPI) is an industry standard that assists applications in interfacing 
with messaging services via a single interface. Microsoft Exchange uses MAPI. 
So in sum, although you won't be asked questions on the Network+ exam that 
directly relate to this information about the Microsoft model, not having it at all leaves 
massive gaps in your networking information. Understanding the Microsoft model helps 
to give you key terminology you will see so you understand what it means when you 
see it, to help differentiate wrong answers and so on. Now, let's jump into the OSI 
model again, but with a direct eye on TCP/IP so that we can prepare for Chapter 6. 
Understanding the TCP/IP Protocol Suite 
In the first section of this chapter, we discussed the DoD's DA1KPA model, which has 
four layers: Network Interface, Internet, Transport, and Application. Since TCP/IP is an 
outgrowth of the DoD's DARPA model, the TCP/IP protocol architecture uses those 
same four layers. However, there is a direct correlation between the OSI model's seven 
layers and TCP/IP's four layers, as shown in Figure 5.11.

Physical Layer 
TCP/IP's Network Interface layer translates into Layers 1 and 2 of the OSI model, 
performing the same functions as the latter's Physical and Data Link layers. The TCP/IP 
Internet layer maps to the Network layer in the OSI model. In both models, the 
Transport layer is the next layer up, though in the DoD model, it originally was referred 
to as the Host-to-Host layer. The Application layer in the DoD model maps to the top 
three layers of the OSI model: Session, Presentation, and Application. 
As you can see, the TCP/IP protocol suite, based on the DoD model, provides all 
the functionality delineated by the OSI model, but with a slightly different schema. As 
we discuss the protocols that comprise the TCP/IP suite, we'll continue to correlate the 
TCP/IP schema to the OSI model. 
TCP/IP was designed to work independently of network design or architecture. It is 
independent of the access method, the frame format, and the medium (cable, airwaves, 
etcetera) itself. TCP/IP defines the details of networking activities at Layers 3 and above. 
Thus, it is used in many different types of networks, including Ethernet, Token Ring,

X.25, Frame Relay, and ATM. This independence provides the flexibility needed in 
today's networking environment.

It's common to find questions regarding the layers of the TCP/IP Protocol suite 
mapped to the OSI model, so make sure you pay close attention to this section 
while studying. Typically, on the Network+ exam you'll see questions regarding 
the OSI model and questions related to the various protocols within TCP/IR By 
remembering how the TCP/IP protocols map to the OSI model, you'll be able to 
answer common questions about the individual protocols within TCP/IP and 
where they fall within the OSI model. This will also help you to remember what 
devices function at what layer. 
Think about it, Layer 3... Network Layer, Routers, Routing... IP addressing, 
logical address.., best effort transmission. Relying on upper layer protocols to 
provide more functionality.., you will suddenly start to just memorize where 
everything goes.., and why it's mapped there in the first place. For the exam, if 
you are having a lot of trouble remembering, start to draw the OSI model and 
fill it in once a day for a week until you have it down.., then you can go into 
the test center, jot down your cheat sheet and begin. There is no crime in 
dumping your brains contents on paper- after you have sat down to prepare 
to take the live exam. Jotting down the OSI model and what maps to where 
would be one of the key things you should consider doing. 
Layer 1" Network Interface (DoD)/ 
Layers 1 and 2 Physical and Data Link (OSI) 
The TCP/IP protocol suite provides networking protocols that work at all layers of the 
DoD model.TCP/IP generally follows the DoD model since they were developed at 
roughly the same time. There is not a clean mapping to the OSI model for TCP/IR so we 
will utilize the DoD model, and make reference to what OSI model layers it maps to, 
which you should already know, as all of these layers were discussed earlier in the chapter. 
In this section, we're going to look at the TCP/IP protocols that work at each of the four 
layers defined in the DoD model (DAR.PA).Also known as the Physical and Data Link 
layers in the OSI model, the Network Interface layer combines both under one layer. 
As you recall, the network interface layer maps to the Physical and Data Link layer in 
the OSI model.At the network interface layer, we're working with 0s and ls being trans- 
mitted back and forth across the network medium (in many offices, the medium is 
twisted-pair Category 5 Ethernet cable). The Network Interface layer is responsible for 
controlling the movement of bits across the medium. As such, it must use some organized

method of managing the sending and receiving of data. In Ethernet networks, the most 
common method is Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Detection. However there 
are other, less common methods of managing data on the network, including Carrier 
Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance and Token Passing. Each is discussed in turn 
in the next sections. 
CSMA/CD 
Ethernet, a common network architecture used in PC networking, uses Carrier Sense 
Multiple Access/Collision Detection to manage media access. CSMA/CD is used on 
multiple access networks as defined in the IEEE 802.3 specification. Using this method, 
devices that have data to transmit listen for an opening on the line before transmitting 
(Carrier Sense). That is, they wait for a time when there are no signals traveling on the 
cable. When a device detects an opening, it transmits its data. The problem is that several 
devices may sense simultaneously that the line is clear and they may all transmit at the 
same time. When this happens, the data packets collide and the data is lost (this is called 
a collision), as shown in Figure 5.12. 
Figure 5.12 A Collision on a Simple Network 
TX ("--'- 
> 
TX 
pea 
PC 1 has successfully received (RX) data from the network, but accidentally, PC 2 
and PC 3 have transmitted (TX) at the same time, thus causing a collision on the net- 
work. Using the CSMA/CD protocol, the devices will detect that a collision has 
occurred (collision detection) and each of the devices that transmitted at the same time 
will wait a random amount of time and then retransmit. The likelihood of one or more 
devices randomly selecting the same delay is almost zero, so the retransmission is likely to 
be successful. Higher network traffic, larger numbers of computers on a network seg- 
ment, and longer cables all contribute to an increased number of collisions, which in 
turn lowers the efficiency of the network because even more traffic is generated by 
larger number of retransmissions. A collision domain is a segment of cable on which two 

OSI Model • Chapter 5 
281 
stations can't transmit at the same time without causing a collision. For example, all 
computers attached to the same hub in a star topology network, or all the computers on 
the same bus (linear segment) in a bus topology network, comprise a single collision 
domain. By using a switch, you can create separate collision domains and reduce net- 
work traffic. 
With CSMA/CD, unlike with some access control protocols (such as demand pri- 
ority) all stations or nodes are equal in their ability to send data when there is an 
opening; no station gets higher priority than any other. 
A number of IEEE working groups continue to develop new standards for 
CSMA/CD, such as those pertaining to gigabit Ethernet and Ethernet over fiber 
(100BaseFX). 

282 
Chapter 5 • OSl Model 
CSMA/CA 
A media access protocol that is related to CSMA/CD is Carrier Sense Multiple 
Access/Collision Avoidance, which is also used on multiple access networks such as 
Token passing or Wireless topologies. With CSMA/CA, a device listens for an opportu- 
nity to transmit its data just as devices do on CSMA/CD networks. However, when the 
device senses an opening, it does not immediately transmit the data; instead it transmits a 
signal notifying other devices that it is transmitting (a sort of warning message) before 
actually sending the data. This means data packets will never collide (although warning 
packets may). 
Traditionally, CSMA/CA was most commonly used by AppleTalk networks. 
However, today most Apple computers can use Ethernet hardware, and this access 
method has fallen out of favor because it creates significant overhead~it adds unneces- 
sary traffic to the network, slowing everything down. The preferred method of dealing 
www.syngress.com 

OSl Model • Chapter 5 
283 
with collisions is the collision detection method, which is the method now employed in 
Ethernet networking technologies. 
As we learned in Chapter 4, "Wireless Technologies", in contrast to Ethernet 802.3 
networks, wireless networks defined by the 802.11 standard do not use CSMA/CD as a 
method to protect against data loss resulting from collisions. Instead, 802.11 networks 
use CSMA/CA. CSMA/CD works by detecting whether a collision has occurred on 
the network and then retransmits the data in the event of such an occurrence. However, 
this method is not practical for wireless networks because it relies on the fact that every 
workstation can hear all the other workstations on a cable segment to determine if there 
is a collision. 
In wireless networks (which are, of course, "multiple access"), usually only the AP 
(access point) can hear every workstation that is communicating with it (for example, 
PC A and PC B may be able to communicate with the same AR but may be too far 
apart from each other to hear their respective transmissions). Additionally, wireless net- 
works do not use full-duplex communication, which is another way of protecting data 
against corruption and loss as a result of collisions. 
CSMA/CA solves the problem of potential collisions on the wireless network by 
taking a more active approach than CSMA/CD, which kicks in only after a collision has 
been detected. Using CSMA/CA, a wireless workstation first tries to detect if any other 
device is communicating on the network. If it senses it is clear to send, it initiates com- 
munication. The receiving device sends an acknowledgment (ACK) packet to the trans- 
mitting device indicating successful reception. If the transmitting device does not receive 
an ACK, it assumes a collision has occurred and retransmits the data. However, it should 
be noted that many collisions can occur and that these collisions can be used to com- 
promise the confidentiality of Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) encrypted data. 
CSMA/CA is only one way in which wireless networks differ from wired networks 
in their implementation at the MAC layer. For example, the IEEE standard for 802.11 at 
the MAC layer defines additional functionality, such as virtual collision detection 
(VCD), roaming, power saving, asynchronous data transfer, and encryption. 
The fact that the WEP protocol is defined at the MAC layer is particularly note- 
worthy and has significant consequences for the security of wireless networks. This 
means that data at the higher levels of the OSI model, particularly Transmission Control 
Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) data, is also encrypted. Because much of the 
TCP/IP communications that occur between hosts contain a large amount of frequently 
repeating and well-known patterns, WEP may be vulnerable to known plaintext attacks, 
although it does include safeguards against this kind of attack. Make sure you understand 
the fundamentals of CSMA/CA and Wireless for the Network+ exam.

Chapter 5 • OSI Model 
Token Passing 
In the 1980s and 1990s, IBM's Token Ring was a popular network technology. Its 
method of media access control involved the use of a token, a signal that was passed 
around the network (which was laid out in a logical ring configuration). A device that 
wanted to transmit data had to wait until it received the token. Once it had the token, it 
was free to transmit. This is referred to as a noncontention access method, because the 
devices don't contend or compete for access to the media. This certainly prevents packet 
collisions on the line, but it is also a slower process because of the time it takes for the 
token to pass from device to device. Token ring networks typically operate at 4Mbps or 
16Mbps, so they have generally fallen out of favor as Ethernet has gained speed (going 
from 10Mbps to 100Mbps to 1000Mbps). Vendors such as IBM, Cisco, and 3Corn have 
developed implementations of High Speed Token Ring (HSTR), including 100Mbps 
over copper and gigabit Token Ring over fiber, but high speed Ethernet had a big head 
start, and organizations such as the 10 Gigabit Ethernet Alliance (www.10gea.org) are 
devoted to taking it to even greater speeds. 
However, FDDI networks are in use as high-speed backbones for mission-critical 
traffic. FDDI was designed to transfer data at 100Mbps, comparable to the most 
common implementation of Ethernet. FDDI uses a dual ring topology: traffic flows in 
opposite directions on the two rings. Stations on the network can be attached to both 
rings or to a single ring. Computers connected to both rings are called Class A stations, 
and those attached to only one are called Class B stations. The second ring usually is 
used for failover in case of problems with the primary ring. Unlike a Token Ring net- 
work, a FDDI network can have more than one frame traveling on the ring at the same 
time. Because it is faster than Token Ring, highly reliable, and fault tolerant, FDDI is 
great for networks that need both high bandwidth and high reliability. However, it is also 
relatively expensive. 
Other network architectures have used the token passing method of access control. 
Attached Resource Computer Network (ARCnet), popular in the 1970s, used a special 
type of token passing in which the token moved from computer to computer in order 
of the node address on the NIC, rather than around a ring as with Token Ring and 
FDDI. ARCnet is slow (2.5Mbps in its original configuration, 20Mbps in a later ver- 
sion), so even though it is stable and reliable, it is slowly disappearing from the net- 
working world. 
Other Access Control Methods 
There are other ways that computer networks can control access to the media, but they 
are limited in use. For example, Hewlett Packard designed an architecture it called 
100VG-AnyLAN, based on the demand-priority access control method. These networks 
were designed in a tree configuration, with child hubs cascading off a root hub, and 
computers connected to each child hub. This creates multiple small collision domains, 
preventing problems associated with broadcasts that are sent to the entire network. The

hubs (also called multiport repeaters because they boost the signals they receive before 
sending them back out) monitor the nodes that are attached to them, in a round-robin 
fashion, detecting requests to transmit on the network. An advantage of this access 
method is the fact that you can set priorities according to data type, to ensure that the 
most important data is processed first. The equipment, however, is proprietary, and 
despite its reliability, performance, and security advantages, demand-priority-based net- 
works are not common.

questions regarding how data is managed on the physical medium. Make sure 
you understand what the question is asking. The most frequently asked media 
access questions have to do with CSMA/CD, because it is the most widely used 
in networking today. However, you might find a tricky question that asks you to 
identify CSMA/CA instead. 
Layer 2" Internet (DoD) / Layer 3 Network (OSl) 
The TCP/IP suite has four core protocols that work at the Internet layer, which maps to 
the Network layer of the OSI model. The Internet layer is responsible for packaging, 
addressing, and routing the data. The four core protocols used in the TCP/IP suite are: 
• 
The Internet Protocol 
• 
The Internet Control Message Protocol 
• 
The Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) 
• 
The Address Resolution Protocol 
IPv4 
The Internet Protocol is probably the best known of the TCP/IP protocols. Many 
people, especially those who have even a passing familiarity with computer technology, 
have heard or used the term I? address. Later in this chapter, we'll take an in-depth look 
at how the IP protocol works and you'll learn the intricacies of IP addressing. 
With regard to the TCP/IP architecture, IP is a mutable protocol (meaning it can be 
sent across networks) that handles addressing, routing, and the process of putting data 
into or taking data out of packets. IP is considered to be connectionless because it does not

establish a session with a remote computer before sending data. Data sent via connec- 
tionless methods are called datagrams. An IP packet can be lost, delayed, duplicated, or 
delivered out of sequence and there is no attempt to recover from these errors. 
Recovery is the responsibility of higher layer protocols including Transport layer proto- 
cols such as TCE 
IP packets (shown in Figure 5.14) contain data that include: 
• 
Source IP address The IP address of the source of the datagram. 
m 
Destination IP address The IP address of the destination for the datagram. 
[] 
Identification Identifies a specific IP datagram as well as all fragments of a 
specific IP datagram if the datagram becomes fragmented. 
• 
Protocol Indicates to which protocols the receiving IP should pass the 
packets. 
• 
Checksum A simple method of error control that performs a mathematical 
calculation to verify the integrity of the IP header. 
• 
Time-to-Live (TTL) Designates the number of networks the datagram can 
travel before it is discarded. This prevents datagrams from circling endlessly on 
the network.

ICMP 
The Internet Control Message Protocol is not as well-known as its famous cousin, IP, 
but is used so often that it would seem that you hear about this protocol more than IP. 
Many programs that you use as a network engineer rely on ICMP, such as Ping and 
Traceroute (Tracert). ICMP is responsible for handling errors related to IP packets that 
cannot be delivered. For instance, if a packet cannot be delivered, a message called 
Destination Unreachable is sent back to the sending device so it will know that there was 
an undelivered message. The Destination Unreachable message has several subtypes of 
messages that can be sent back to the host to help pinpoint the problem. For instance, 
Network Unreachable and Port Unreachable are two examples of Destination Unreachable 
messages that may be returned to help the host determine the nature of the problem. 
If you have ever used the Ping utility (discussed at the end of this chapter) and 
received an error, it was ICMP that was responsible for returning the error. In addition 
to announcing errors, ICMP also announces network congestion (source quench messages) 
and timeouts (which occur when the TTL [time to live] field on a packet reaches zero). 
In Exercise 5.2 we will look at using ICMP on your network.

In this example, you can see the milliseconds in time it takes for packets to get from 
source to destination; very helpful when you want to find possible bottlenecks on your 
network. ICMP is responsible for reporting this information to the Traceroute program. 
IGMP 
The Internet Group Management Protocol manages host membership in multicast 
groups. IP multicast groups are groups of devices (typically called hosts) that listen for 
and receive traffic addressed to a specific, shared multicast IP address. Essentially, IP mul- 
ticast traffic is sent to a specific MAC address, but processed by multiple IP hosts. As 
you'll recall from our earlier discussion, each NIC has a unique MAC address, but multi- 
cast MAC addresses use a special 24-bit prefix to identify them as such. IGMP runs on 
the router, which handles the distribution of multicast packets (often, multicast routing is 
not enabled on the router by default and must be configured). 
Multicasting makes it easy for a server to send the same content to multiple com- 
puters simultaneously. IP addresses in a specific range (called Class D addresses) are 
reserved for multicast assignment. The IGMP protocol allows for different types of mes- 
sages, used to join multicast groups and to send multicast messages. 
A unicast message is sent directly to a single host, whereas a multicast is sent to all 
members of a particular group. Both utilize connectionless datagrams and are transported 
via UDP, which we'll discuss in the next section. A multicast is sent to a group of hosts 
known as an IP multicast group or host group. The hosts in this group listen for IP traffic 
sent to a specific IP multicast address. IP multicasts are more efficient than broadcasts 
because the data is received only by computers listening to a specific address. A range of 
IP addresses, known as Class D addresses, is reserved for multicast addresses. Windows 
Server 2003 supports multicast addresses and, by default, is configured to support both 
the sending and receiving of IP multicast traffic.

ARP 
The Address Resolution Protocol is the last of the four core TCP/IP protocols that 
work at the Internet layer.As we've discussed, each NIC has a unique MAC address. 
Each NIC also is assigned an IP address that is unique to the network on which it 
resides. When a packet is sent on a TCP/IP network, the packet headers include a desti- 
nation IP address (along with other information). The IP address must be translated into 
a specific MAC address in order for the data to reach its intended recipient. Without 
ARP, computers must send broadcast messages each time an IP address has to be 
matched to a MAC address. 
ARP is responsible for maintaining the mappings of IP addresses to MAC addresses. 
These mappings are stored in the ARP cache so if the same IP address needs to be 
matched to a MAC address again, the mapping can be found in the cache; it's not neces- 
saw to repeat the discovery process. 
The protocol includes four different types of messages: AKP request, AKP reply, 
RARP request, and RARP reply. RARP refers to Reverse Address Resolution protocol, 
which resolves addresses in the opposite direction (MAC address to IP address). These 
messages are used to discover the MAC addresses that correspond to specific IP addresses 
(and vice versa). When the MAC address is correlated to the specific IP address, the data 
can be sent to the proper host. 
ARP was originally designed for DEC/Intel/Xerox (DIX) 10Mbps Ethernet net- 
works, but is now used with other types of IP-based networks as well. 
These are the four primary protocols involved in TCP/IP at the Internet layer, 
which is responsible for addressing, packaging, and routing packets of data. As we move 
up the protocol stack, we will examine the Transport layer.

Layer 3" Host-to-Host/Layer 4 Transport (OSI) 
Layer 3 in TCP/IP is the Host-to-Host Transport layer, sometimes called the Transport layer. 
It maps to the Transport layer (Layer 4) in the OSI model. As the name implies, this layer 
is responsible for transporting the data. It sets up communications between the 
Application layer and the lower layers. 
Because this layer establishes a connection, it can also take on some of the responsi- 
bilities of the Session layer of the OSI model. In TCP/IR the two core protocols used at 
the Host-to-Host layer are TCP and UDE As we discussed earlier, one of the key distin- 
guishing features of these two protocols is that TCP is considered connection-oriented 
and UDP is connectionless. 
TCP 
The Transmission Control Protocol provides reliable one-to-one communications because 
it establishes a connection with the receiving host prior to transmitting and because it pro- 
vides a number of control features to ensure reliable communications.TCP is connection- 
oriented because it establishes a TCP connection prior to sending data. This is similar to 
the way a modem works when the modem dials another computer and establishes a con- 
nection before data is transmitted. This ensures that someone is on the other end before 
data is sent. TCP sequences the packets, acknowledges sent packets, and helps recover lost 
packets. Data is transmitted in segments and each segment is numbered sequentially. When 
the receiving host receives data, it sends an Acknowledgement message to the sender. If the 
sender does not receive this ACK within a specified amount of time, the data segment is 
re-sent, based on the assumption that the data was not received.

OSI Model • Chapter 5 
291 
Data from the Transport layer's TCP is organized into segments. These are sent down 
through the protocol stack and headers are added. Each network technology (Ethernet, 
Token Ring, etcetera) has a particular way it encapsulates data. This particular encapsula- 
tion is called the frame format. Each technology uses its own flame format. In Ethernet 
technologies, the flame of data is a fixed-length and is generally referred to as a packet. 
The Ethernet IP packet contains a preamble, destination and source address, data, and an 
error-checking sequence, among other things. The flame format describes the required 
data and the order in which is appears inside the data packet, which is the unit of data 
sent across the network medium. 
Each TCP segment has a header that contains, among other things, the following 
important fields: 
• 
TCP port to send the data 
• 
TCP port to receive the data 
• 
Sequence number for the segment 
• 
Acknowledgment number 
• 
Window size (not to be confused with the Microsoft Windows operating 
system), which indicates the current size of the TCP buffer on the sending 
host's end. The TCP buffer is used to hold incoming segments and must have 
room to accept additional segments when received.

Chapter 5 • OSI Model 
In order to establish a connection, TCP uses a three-part handshake, which works as 
follows" 
The client computer sends a SYN (synchronization request) message with a 
sequence number that is generated by the client. 
www.syngress.com 

OSl Model 
• 
Chapter

293 
. 
. 
The server computer responds with an ACK message. This consists of the orig- 
inal sequence number plus 1. The server also sends a SYN number that it gen- 
erates. 
The client adds a 1 to the SYN number that was sent by the server, and 
returns it as an ACK. 
This process, with each computer acknowledging the other, results in the establish- 
ment of a connection. A similar process is used to terminate the connection. TCP estab- 
lishes this one-to-one (host-to-host) connection and also adds header information to 
ensure reliable communications. The downside to this reliability is that it adds both time 
and data in the transmission, which slows down communication somewhat. 
Figure 5.15 shows the process TCP uses to establish a connection.There are three 
distinct steps used to establish a reliable connection. These same steps are used to end a 
connection. This handshake process is what creates a reliable connection because both 
hosts must indicate that they are ready to send/receive and that they are finished 
sending/receiving.As you can see in Figure 5.15, the first step is to establish the connec- 
tion. The sending host (we'll call it Host A for clarity) sends a TCP segment to the 
receiving host (Host B) with an initial Sequence Number for the connection and the 
TCP window size, which indicates the sender's receiving buffer size. The receiving 
computer, Host B, replies with a TCP segment that contains its chosen Sequence 
Number and its initial TCP window size. Host A sends a segment back to Host B 
acknowledging Host B's chosen Sequence Number.

UDP 
In some cases, it's appropriate to send a quick message without needing to sequence the 
data or to get an acknowledgement that it's been received. In these cases, an application 
developer might choose to use the User Datagram Protocol instead of TCP. Remember 
that protocols are agreed-upon rules that developers use to ensure their applications 
work within the TCP/IP framework. UDP is often described as connectionless or "best- 
effort delivery" because it does not establish a connection before sending, it does not 
sequence packets before sending, and it does not provide error control through retrans- 
mission. In short, it's a one-shot deal that is fast, but not always reliable. 
The UDP header contains three important fields: 
• 
The source port 
The destination port 
The UDP checksum 
ii TE 
The UDP checksum is the only error control mechanism within UDR It is used to 
verify the integrity of the UDP header and data. UDP is used, for instance, in 
NetBIOS name service and SNMP because both of these use short data seg- 
ments and do not require ACK messages. 
Both TCP and UDP utilize port numbers, as we discussed previously. Port numbers 
are assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). It is important to 
have a centralized body to assign these numbers so that everyone will use the same ports 
for the same functions. There are many well known TCP and UDP ports, as well as 
many obscure ports. When you secure a network server, it is usually advisable to disable 
all TCP and UDP ports that are not in use so they cannot be used by hackers looking 
for a back door. 
TCP and UDP may use the same port numbers, but they are not the same ports. 
Each uses its own distinct set of ports. TCP port 20 is different from UDP port 20.A 
few of the common TCP and UDP ports are shown in Table 5.1.

used by TCP/IP services (and by hackers) are the same regardless of the operating system. 
,~',~,~#~,~,',~~~T DAY TIP 
:,~::~#E!lili t'~ TCP versus UDP. You are very likely to run into some questions on the exam that 
are related to TCP and UDP. It's critical to understand the difference between 
these two transport protocols. UDP is an unreliable, connectionless, fast trans- 
:i;i'~i'~i!iiiii'i'~Y port protocol used for sending short messages or messages that do not require 
acknowledgement of receipt. An easy way to remember the difference is: TCP is 
Trustworthy; UDP is Unreliable. 
What's important to remember about TCP and UDP is that although one is consid- 
ered reliable and the other unreliable, it does not mean that one is inherently better than 
the other. TCP establishes a connection before information is sent to the receiver; UDP 
does not. Many applications do not require acknowledgement that sent data was 
received because it sends the data in small amounts. In these scenarios, using a connec- 
tionless UDP datagram is far more efficient. Therefore, UDP datagrams are used in a 
variety of applications including NetBIOS name service, NetBIOS datagram service, 
SNME and DNS. 
Layer 4" Application (DoD)/Layers 1, 2, 3 
Session, Presentation and Application (OSI) 
The Application layer protocols of the TCP/IP protocol suite operate at the Session, 
Presentation, and Application layers of the OSI model. In the DoD model, this layer 
enables applications to communicate with one another and it provides access to the ser- 
vices of the other underlying layers (DoD Layers 1 through 3). There is a wide variety of 
Application layer protocols, and more are being developed because they can rely on all 
the TCP/IP services beneath them in the protocol stack.

296 
Chapter 5 • OSI Model 
We briefly mentioned some of the Application layer protocols in our discussion of the 
OSI Application layer. In the following sections, we will describe some of these in more 
detail. We won't cover every single Application layer protocol in use today (we couldn't, 
without turning this book into an encyclopedia set), but we will cover some of the proto- 
cols and services that you're not only likely to work with on the job as a network techni- 
cian, but that you're also likely to encounter on the Network+ certification exam. 
NetBIOS 
over TCP 
NetBIOS over TCP as a naming service has been largely supplanted by the use of DNS. 
However, in organizations running operating systems or applications that cannot use 
DNS for name services, NetBIOS over TCP must still be enabled. 
NetBIOS over TCP (NetBT) is an Application layer set of protocols that provides 
name, session, and datagram services for NetBIOS applications. NetBIOS was originally 
developed for IBM by Systek Corporation to extend the capabilities of the BIOS (Basic 
Input Output System) to include the ability to work across a network. It is a software 
interface and a naming convention, not a protocol (although you will see it referred to 
in some documentation as the NetBIOS protocol). NetBIOS over TCP supplies the pro- 
gramming interface provided for by NetBIOS, along with communication protocols 
provided for by TCP. 
• 
NetBT's name service allows host computers to attain and retain (or defend) a 
NetBIOS name. It also assists other hosts in locating a computer with a spe- 
cific NetBIOS name.Additionally, the name service resolves a specific 
NetBIOS name to an IP address. This process utilizes broadcast messages that are 
sent to all hosts on the network. The name service uses UDP port 137. 
• 
The session service of NetBT provides for the reliable exchange of messages 
between two NetBIOS applications, typically on two different computers.The 
session service uses TCP port 139. 
• 
The datagram service within NetBT provides connectionless, unreliable mes- 
sage delivery between NetBIOS applications via UDP port 138.As mentioned 
earlier, when data length is short or reliability is not critical, the datagram ser- 
vice is a faster method than session-based communication. 
Together, the session and datagram services provide the NetBIOS applications with 
the ability to exchange information with one another. 
!~M WARNING 
=!ii~ !~ Remember the following for the Network+ exam: 
!ii~!i i!~ 
• 
The name service uses UDP Port 137. 
• 
The datagram service uses UDP Port 138. 
• 
The session service uses TCP Port 139.

WINS 
Windows Internet Name Service, or WINS, is a NetBIOS name server that NetBIOS 
clients can use to attain, register, and resolve NetBIOS names. WINS is specific to 
Microsoft networks and is not used (or available for use) on non-Microsoft operating 
system-based computers. Computers running UNIX, Linux, and other non-Microsoft 
operating systems typically use DNS for name resolution, although there are other, non- 
WINS NetBIOS name services available. Generally other operating systems will be con- 
cerned with NetBIOS names only when they're on a network with Microsoft machines; 
for example, when using SAMBA (a Linux-based file and printer sharing application). 
WINS provides NetBIOS functionality, but expands it by replicating this information 
for faster name resolution services across a large network. WINS generates a database that 
contains each NetBIOS name and its associated IP address.A WINS server resolves 
NetBIOS names and provides the associated IP addresses when it receives requests. 
~ M  
_WARNING 
!!I! ii !~ NetBIOS name resolution can be done via a centralized WINS server or via a 
~iiiiiiii! local Imhosts file, both of which will be able to keep traffic down on your net- 
work by mapping NetBIOS names to IP addresses. 
WINS is implemented in two parts: the server service and the client service. The 
server service maintains the database containing both NetBIOS names and associated IP 
addresses. It also replicates the database to other WINS servers for faster name resolution 
across a large network. This reduces network broadcast traffic because names can be 
acquired and defended using direct requests to the WINS server, rather than by using 
network broadcasts. The client service runs on the individual computers and it uses 
WINS to register the computer name, as well as to provide name resolution services to 
the local applications and services. 
For backward compatibility, Windows-based clients and servers also provide support 
for using the lmhosts file. This plain text file is unique to Windows-based computers and 
provides a map of the computer's NetBIOS name with an IP address.This static file was 
used prior to the implementation of dynamic Windows name resolution found in 
WINS. WINS will be covered in greater detail in Chapter 6. 
WARNING 
ii!iI~ 
NetBIOS name resolution uses four different node types to resolve names to IP 
addresses: Broadcast (B-node), Peer-to-Peer (P-node), Mixed (M-node), and 
Hybrid (H-node).

Chapter 5 • OSI Model 
SMB/CIFS 
The Server Message Block (SMB) protocol was originally developed by IBM in the 
1980s and later expanded upon by IBM, Microsoft, Intel, and 3Com. SMB was primarily 
used for file and print sharing, but is also used for sharing serial ports and abstract com- 
munications technologies such as named pipes and mail slots. SMB is also now known as 
Common Internet File System (CIFS); both names are used interchangeably. 
CIFS is a protocol that, like many Application layer protocols, is operating system- 
independent. It evolved from SMB and NetBIOS file and print sharing methods in earlier 
versions of the Windows operating system. It can be used by different platforms and oper- 
ating systems and across different network/transport protocols; it is not TCP/IP-depen- 
dent. The connection from client to server can be made via NetBEUI or IPX/SPX.After 
the network connection from client to server is established, then SMB commands can be 
sent to the server so that the client can open, read and write files, and so on. 
CIFS is being jointly developed by Microsoft and other vendors, but no published 
specification currently exists. UNIX and Linux clients can connect to SMB shares using 
smbclient from SAMBA or smbfs for Linux. Server implementations of SMB for non- 
Microsoft operating systems include SAMBA and LAN Manager for OS/2 and SCO.

IPP 
The Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) is related to SMB and CIFS. It provides the ability 
to perform various printing operations across the network (including an internetwork) 
using HTTP version 1.1.

Windows S o cke ts 
Windows Sockets is a Microsoft Windows API that provides a standard programming 
interface for accessing TCP/IP in Windows. Sockets were originally developed at the 

OSI Model • Chapter 5 
299 
University of California in Berkeley, and Microsoft developed Windows Sockets (also 
referred to as l/Vinsock) to work specifically in the Windows operating system environment. 
Vendors who develop software that runs on Windows can use this API to access 
standard TCP/IP functionality. A number of built-in Windows tools rely on Windows 
Sockets, including Packet InterNet Groper (ping) and Trace Route (tracert). In addition, the 
FTP and DHCP servers and clients use Windows Sockets, as does the Telnet client. 
Telnet 
Telnet is a terminal emulation protocol that allows you to log onto a remote computer. 
The remote computer must be using TCP/IP and have the Telnet server service run- 
ning. To connect to a remote host, you must start the Telnet client and must possess a 
username and password for the remote host computer. In Windows Server 2003, the 
Telnet server service is present, but must be started in order to service Telnet clients. 
If you have never used the command prompt in Windows, here's how: click 
Start I Run and type cmd in the dialog box (in Windows operating systems prior to 
Windows 98, the 16-bit command was command. In Windows 98 and beyond, the 32- 
bit command, cmd, is supported). This will open a command window. Type telnet at 
the prompt. Type help for a list of commands and quit to close Telnet. Use exit to close 
the command prompt window.

capture packets and read the contents such as usernames and passwords. 
DHCP 
The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol is used to automatically (or dynamically) 
assign IP addresses to host computers on a network running TCP/IP. Prior to DHCP, 
network administrators had to assign IP addresses to host computers manually. This was 
not only a time-consuming endeavor, but also made it easy for errors (either in IP 
assignment or in entering in the IP address) to creep in and cause network problems. 
Why is DHCP so important? Because each host must have a unique IP address, and 
a problem occurs when two hosts have the same IP address. DHCP was devised as an 
efficient method to alleviate both the problems caused by errors and the time it took to 
assign and resolve errors. It does this by maintaining a database of the assigned addresses, 
ensuring that there will never be duplicate addresses among the DHCP clients.

Chapter 5 • OSl Model 
DHCP is implemented as both a server service and a client service. The DHCP 
server service is responsible for assigning the IP address to individual hosts and for main- 
taining the database of IP address information, including IP addresses that are assigned, 
IP addresses that are available and other configuration information that can be conveyed 
to the client along with the IP address assignment. The DHCP client service interacts 
with the Server service in requesting an IP address and in configuring other related 
information including the subnet mask and default gateway (both are discussed in detail 
later in this chapter and in the next chapter, "TCP/IP"). 
SMTP 
The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol is a protocol used to transfer e-mail messages and 
attachments. SMTP is used to transmit e-mail between e-mail servers and from e-mail 
clients (such as Microsoft Outlook or Linux's sendmail) to e-mail servers (such as 
Microsoft Exchange). However, most e-mail clients use other protocols, such as POP3 or 
IMAP4, to retrieve e-mail from the server. These two server applications (SMTP and 
POP or IMAP) may exist on the same physical server machine. 
As with the other protocols and services discussed in this section, SMTP operates at 
the Application layer and relies on the services of the underlying layers of the TCP/IP 
suite to provide the actual data transfer services. 
WARNING 
Remember that SMTP uses port 25 for communication. 
POP 
Post Office Protocol is a widely used e-mail application protocol that can be used to 
retrieve e-mail from an e-mail server for the client application, such as Microsoft 
Outlook. The current version of POP is POP3. 
POP servers set up mailboxes (actually directories or folders) for each e-mail 
account name. The server receives the mail for a domain, and sorts it into these indi- 
vidual folders. Then a user uses a POP client program (such as Outlook or Eudora) to 
connect to the POP server and download all the mail in that user's folder to the user's 
computer. Usually, when the mail messages are transferred to the client machine, they 
are deleted from the server. 
www.syngress.com 

OSI Model • Chapter 5 
301 
WARNING 
Remember that POP3 uses port 110 for communication. 
Qi; 
IMAP 
IMAP, like POP, is used to retrieve e-mail from a server, and creates a mailbox for each 
user account. It differs from POP in that the client program can access the mail and 
allow the user to read, reply to, and delete it while it is still on the server. MicrosoFt 
Exchange functions as an IMAP server. This is convenient for users because they never 
have to download the mail to their client computers (saving space on their hard disks), 
but especially because they can connect to the server and have all of their mail available 
to them from any computer, anywhere. When you use POP to retrieve your mail, old 
mail that you've already downloaded is on the computer you were using when you 
retrieved it, so it*you're using a different computer, you won't be able to see it. IMAP is 
preferred for users who use different computers (for example, a home computer, an 
office computer, and a laptop) to access their e-mail at different times. 
'~l~i!igiiigii!~ 
WARNING 
Remember that IMAP4 uses Port 143, (both TCP and UDP) for communication.

HTTP 
Hypertext Transport Protocol is the protocol used to transfer files used on the Internet 
to display Web pages. When you type an Internet address (a URL) into your browser's 
Address field, it uses the HTTP protocol to retrieve and display the files located at that 
address. 
A URL typically contains a server name, a second level domain name, and a top- 
level domain name, with the parts of* the address separated by dots. Individual folder and 
file names may Follow, separated by slashes. For example, www.rsnetworks.net/index.htm 
indicates an HTML document (Web page) on a Web server named www in the rsnet- 
works.net domain. The first part of* the URL may also be entered as an IP address if it is 
known. 
HTTP was defined and used as early as 1990. However, there were no published 
specifications for HTTP in the beginning, and different vendors modified HTTP as they 
saw fit. As the World Wide Web continued to evolve and grow to be the enormous 
resource that it is today, additional functionality was needed in HTTP. The first Formal 
definition was labeled HTTP/1 and it was later replaced by HTTP/1.1.

NNTP 
The Network News Transfer Protocol is similar to SMTP in that it allows servers and 
clients to exchange information. In this case, however, the information is exchanged in 
the form of news articles. This feature originally was implemented in the Internet's pre- 
decessor network, AKPANET. Network bulletins were exchanged using this protocol. 
Today there are thousands of newsgroups devoted to discussion of every topic imagin- 
able. Usenet has grown into a huge network of news servers hosting news groups. 
Newsgroups differ from other forums such as Internet mailing lists (in which all mes- 
sages posted come into your inbox if you're a member) and Web discussion boards 
(which are accessed through the browser). 
NNTP is now implemented as an Application layer client/server protocol. The news 
server (for example, msnews.microsoft.com) manages news articles and news clients. A 
news client is an application that runs on a client computer and is used to both read and 
compose news articles. Outlook Express contains a news reader component. For more 
information about Usenet newsgroups, see the Usenet FAQ and references at 
www.faqs.org/usenet/ 
WARN,NG 
~! Remember that NNTP uses port 119 for communication. 
FTP 
The File Transfer Protocol is used to transfer files from one host to another, regardless of 
the hosts' physical locations. It is one of the oldest Application layer protocols and was 
used on ARPANET to transfer files from one mainframe to another. Still in use today, 
FTP is widely used on the Internet to transfer files. One of the problems with FTP is 
that it transmits users' passwords in clear text, so it is not a secure protocol. 
In contrast to the single connections used by NNTP, HTTP, and SMTP, two sepa- 
rate connections are established for an FTP session. One transmits commands and replies 
and the other transmits the actual data. The command and control information is sent, 
by default, via TCP port 21. The data, by default, is sent via TCP port 20.

DNS 
The Domain Naming System is used to resolve a hostname to an IP address in order to 
facilitate the delivery of network data packets. As mentioned previously, DNS is now the 
primary method used in Microsoft Windows Server 2003 to resolve hostnames to IP 
addresses. DNS is also the protocol used on the Internet to resolve hostnames (such as 
those in URLs) to IP addresses. 
Prior to DNS, hostname-to-IP resolution was accomplished via a text file called 
hosts. In the days of ARPANET, this file was compiled and managed by the Network 
Information Center at the Stanford Research Institute. This plain text file contained the 
name and address of every single computer, but there were only a handful of computers 
on the network at the time. When a new computer was added, or a computer changed 
its IP address, the file had to be edited manually and distributed to all the other com- 
puters. As computers and networks proliferated, another, more automated solution had 
to be devised and the specifications for a distributed naming system, called the Domain 
Naming System, were developed. 
DNS servers on the Internet store copies of the DNS database. Due to the explosive 
growth of the Internet in the past decade, DNS databases are specialized. For instance, a 
set of databases is responsible for top-level domain information only. Examples of top- 
level domains are .com, .gov, .edu, .net, .org, and so on. All requests for an address 
ending with .com will be forwarded to a particular set of DNS servers. These servers 
will query their databases to find the specific .com domain requested (for example, 
microsoft.com). DNS databases are replicated periodically to refresh the data.

RIP 
As the name implies, the Routing Information Protocol (RIP) is used to exchange 
routing information among IP routers. RIP is a basic routing protocol designed for 
small- to medium-sized networks. It does not scale well to large IP-based networks 
(including the Internet). Windows Server 2003 computers can function as routers, and as 
such, they support RIE Routing is covered in more depth in Chapter 6, where WAN 
standards and remote access are covered. 
NTP 
Network Time Protocol (NTP) is a protocol that provides a very reliable way of trans- 
mitting and receiving an accurate time source over TCP/IP-based networks. NTR 
defined in RFC 1305 (www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1305.txt), is useful for synchronizing the 
internal clock of the computers to a common time source. Some systems like Novell 
NetWare's Novell Directory Services (NDS, or now known simply as e-Directory) as 
well as Microsoft Windows Server 2003 and 2000, rely on a time source to keep things 
running right. For system maintenance, troubleshooting of issues, and documentation, it 
is important that all systems be time synchronized. In addition, for prosecution of secu- 
rity breaches or attacks, security logs need to be accurate, and so on. NTR when used 
properly, can have a hierarchical disaster recovery system designed into it, with primary 
sources of time as well as secondaries. Having the correct time on your system(s) is very 
important. Many problems can surface if networked machines are not synchronized. 
~!ii!i!iiiiiiiiiii~iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!i~ 
WARNING 
Remember that NTP uses port 123 for communication. Do not confuse this with 
NNTP, which uses port 119. 
SNMP 
The Simple Network Management Protocol is used for communications between a net- 
work management console and the network's devices, such as bridges, routers, and hubs. 
This protocol facilitates the sharing of network control information with the management 
console. SNMP employs a management system/agent framework to share relevant net- 
www.syngress.com 

OSI Model • Chapter 5 
305 
work management information. This information is stored in a Management Information 
Base (MIB) and contains a set of objects, each of which represents a particular type of net- 
work information such as an event, an error, or an active session. SNMP employs UDP 
datagrams to send messages between the management console and the agents. 
Now that we have covered the OSI model (as well as the DoD model) in depth... 
you should now have a good idea of the importance of it, and why it's so important to 
know for the Network+ exam. This modular approach to network communications 
makes development less time-consuming and more consistent across vendors, networks, 
and systems. As a result, new Application layer protocols are constantly being developed. 
This section is not meant to serve as an exhaustive look at the wide array of application 
protocols available today, but to give you a better idea of the more common protocols 
and services that operate at this layer and provide an understanding of how the layered 
approach works. 
We've reviewed the seven layers of the OSI model (starting from the lowest level, 
Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application) and the 
four layers of the DARPA (TCP/IP) model (Network Interface, Internet, Host-to-Host, 
and Application) and we've learned how these layers map to one another. 
We've also taken a look at the very different Microsoft networking model. We've 
examined many of the common protocols of the TCP/IP protocol suite that work at 
each layer and looked the services and functions that each provides. In the next chapter, 
you'll learn in depth about the IP protocol and how it is used to send data to the cor- 
rect location, no matter where the destination host resides.

Standardization (ISO). The OSI model defined seven layers for standard, reliable network 
"~<~:'~ communications: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and 
Application. The acronym commonly used to remember this is (in reverse order)" All 
People Seem To Need Data Processing. 
If you were to follow each layer and map to it a protocol and a device, then by 
reading this chapter you would remember that the Physical layer is responsible for sig- 
naling, transmission medium, and ones and zeros traversing the wire. As we move up the 
model, things get increasingly more complex. The next layer, the Data Link layer, is 
where your MAC address is located. We discussed the functionality of a NIC card and 
what a MAC address is. On Ethernet NlCs, the physical or MAC address (also called the 
hardware address) is expressed as 12 hexadecimal digits, arranged in pairs with colons 
between each pair, for example, 12:3A:4D:66:3A:lC. In binary notation, this translates to 
a 48-bit (or 6-byte) number, with the initial three bytes representing the manufacturer 
and the last three bits representing a unique network interface card made by that manu- 
facturer. The Data Link layer is subdivided into two sublayers, known as the LLC and 
MAC layer. The LLC or Logical Link Control sublayer is responsible for providing the 
logic for the data link, and thus it controls the synchronization, flow control, and error 
checking functions of the Data Link layer. 
The TCP/IP protocol suite provides the functionality specified in the OSI model 
using the four related layers of the DoD model: Network Interface, Internet, Host-to- 
Host, and Application. The Network Interface maps to the Physical and Data Link layers 
and the Internet layer maps to the OSI Network layer. The Host-to-Host layer maps to 
the Transport layer and DoD's Application layer maps to the Session, Presentation, and 
Application layers of the OSI model. Some of the more commonly known Application 
layer protocols are FTR HTTP, POP3, WINS, DNS, and DHCR Understanding the

answer. Understanding the origins of the Internet can help you answer other ques- 
tions on the exam, sometimes by simply helping you eliminate wrong answers. 
Q: How exactly does the Network Interface layer of the DoD model map to the 
Physical and Data Link layers of the OSI model? 
A: The DoD's Network Interface layer maps directly to the Physical and Data Link 
layers of the OSI model, with one notable exception. There are two parts to the 
Data Link layer~the Logical Link Control and the Media Access Control sublayers. 
TCP/IP does not implement the Logical Link Control element at the Network 
Interface layer. This function is handled further up the protocol stack at the Host-to- 
Host (Transport) layer. 
Q" There are a lot of Application layer protocols in the TCP/IP suite.Am I expected to 
memorize them all? 
A" There is an ever-expanding set of Application layer protocols in use today. It's 
important to get a firm understanding of the most common protocols and to have at 
least a familiarity with the less common protocols. At the very least, you should be

Chapter 6 • Network Protocols 
Introduction 
TCP/IR (short for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is a term we rec- 
ognize easily due to its ever-increasing function in connecting our computers to the 
Internet. TCP/IP is a network protocol used to provide the logical communication 
structure needed to send and receive data on a computer network. This logical commu- 
nication structure is the complicated part, and what we will be primarily learning about 
in this chapter. The Network+ exam calls for an understanding of routable and routing 
protocols in terms of routing, addressing schemes, interoperability, and naming conven- 
tions. This chapter, as well as sections of the next chapter, will cover many aspects of 
TCP/IP, especially those areas made testable by the Network+ posted objectives. 
In this chapter we will also be covering other not-so-well-known network protocols 
still in use in some networks, such as AppleTalk, IPX/SPX (Internetwork Packet 
Exchange/Sequenced Packet Exchange) and the rarely used NetBEUI (NetBIOS 
Enhanced User Interface). However, this chapter's main focus will be on TCP/IR The 
reasoning for this is simple; not only is TCP/IP one of the most thoroughly tested 
knowledge areas on the exam, it is the most widely used and integrated protocol in use 
today around the world. Not knowing TCP/IP can be somewhat career-limiting when 
considering becoming a network engineer. The TCP/IP protocol suite is primarily what 
keeps the Internet running as well as it does.TCP/IP is also used to provide network 
communication in most of the world's companies, universities, and countries. Anywhere 
there is a network connection, it is most likely that TCP/IP is in use. Keep in mind that 
this chapter does in no way explore all there is to know about TCP/IR as that could lit- 
erally take volumes to cover. 
By the end of this chapter you should be comfortable with navigating numbering 
schemes, have a better understanding of the protocol suite, and have the ability to work 
your way through any problem presented to you (on the Network+ exam and in real life). 
TCP/IP has rattled many test takers in the past who have taken exams where 
TCP/IP fundamentals are tested extensively. Since Network+ is somewhat of an entry- 
level exam, you will not have to have TCP/IP addressing and design perfected or mas- 
tered, but you will have to have the fundamentals of it. Learning about network 
protocols is not too tough an issue once you understand the underlying mechanics. The 
intent of this chapter is to ensure that you have the foundation and fundamental knowl- 
edge needed to pass the exam and build the rest of your studies on. Now, let's delve into 
these network protocols and see exactly what we need to know for the Network+ exam 
as well as in your day-to-day activities as a network administrator.

Network Protocols • Chapter 6 
319 
This chapter covers the TCP/IP protocol in depth and also looks briefly at other 
protocol suites such as AppleTalk and IPX/SPX. These protocols will show up on 
the exam, but not as much as TCP/IR Although the information in this chapter is 
, good for test preparation purposes, as a working network engineer, you should 
know more about somewhat obscure and less-commonly used protocols. 
Network Protocols 
Network protocols keep the network communications world running. They provide for 
continuing data exchange, they keep e-mails going back and forth from source to desti- 
nation, and take care of all of the network-based operations that we take for granted Just 
about anything done on a network today is handled by the accurate design and imple- 
mentation of routable network protocols. Commonly seen and used today is TCP/IR 
Since most of this chapter focuses on TCP/IR we will cover it last. Before we do, let's 
look at some other network protocols that you will encounter, not only within your 
travels and working as a network technician, administrator, or engineer, but also on the 
CompTIA Network+ exam. 
Understanding network protocols is not as difficult as most would make it out to 
be. Understanding some basic math, addition and subtraction, and basic multiplication 
skills, are nearly all you need to become a good network engineer working with net- 
work protocols~that, and an understanding of how the protocols work. Armed with 
both, you will be able to work on any network protocols you encounter. 
IPX/SPX 
IPX is a connectionless Layer 3 network protocol. Its counterpart, SPX, operates at 
Layer 4. Although multiple Novell protocols also operate at Layer 4, SPX is the most 
commonly implemented. SPX, a reliable, connection-oriented protocol, was derived 
from the XNS (Xerox Network System) protocols of the 1970s. Network Core 
Protocol (NCP) provides interaction between clients and servers by defining connection 
control and service request/reply. Service Advertisement Protocol (SAP) allows servers 
to advertise their addresses and the services they provide. 
IPX/SPX is an old Novell-based protocol that has been around for many years, and is 
still used in some legacy Novell network environments. Over time it is being gradually 
phased out in favor ofTCP/IP. IPX/SPX will see very few new installs.You will, however, 
undoubtedly come across IPX/SPX currently installed in older networks, and as such, 
knowledge of the IPX/SPX protocol suite is still tested on the Network+ exam. 
At its beginning, Novell adapted IPX from the Xerox Network System Internet 
Datagram Protocol (IDP). IPX is a connectionless datagram protocol. This means that

Chapter 6 • Network Protocols 
when a process running on a particular node uses IPX to communicate with a process 
on another node, no connection between the two nodes is established. IPX packets are 
addressed and sent to their destinations, but there is no guarantee or verification of suc- 
cessful delivery. As a Network Layer protocol, IPX addresses and routes packets from one 
location to another on an IPX network. IPX bases its routing decisions on the address 
fields in its header and on the information it receives from RIP (Routing Information 
Protocol), or NLSP (NetWare Link State Protocol). IPX uses this information to for- 
ward packets to their destination nodes or to the next router providing a path to the 
destination node. RIP and NLSP are routing protocols that make routing decisions 
based on a KIT (Routing Information Table). Figure 6.1 shows how the IPX/SPX pro- 
tocol suite maps to the OSI (Open Systems Interconnect) model.

M WARNING 
Figure 6.1 shows only a handful of protocols available in the IPX/SPX suite. You 
should understand basic placement of the most commonly used IPX/SPX proto- 
cols on the OSI model by layer. For more information on the OSI model, refer- 
ence Chapter 5. 
IPX Addressing 
An IPX address consists of two parts: the network number and the node number. IPX 
addresses are 80 bits long, with 32 bits for the network number and 48 bits for the node 
number. IPX simplifies mapping between Layer 3 and Layer 2 addresses, using the Layer 2 
address as the host portion of the Layer 3 address. This eliminates the need for address res- 
olution, such as that provided by the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) for the IP suite. 
IPX addresses are generally written as hexadecimal digits in the network.node format. 
Unlike IR IPX has no concept of subnetworking. The IPX network number is man- 
ually assigned and must be unique for each network segment. Each node number on a 
given IPX network segment must be unique. 
TE 
IPX supports multiple Ethernet frame types: Ethernet II, IEEE 802.3, IEEE 802.3 
SNAP, and Novell 802.3 RAW. It is possible to use multiple encapsulation types 
on a single network segment as long as a unique network number is assigned 
to each encapsulation type. It is important to note that hosts that use different 
encapsulation types will not be able to directly communicate with each other. 
You won't be tested on this intricate detail of the protocol, but it's important to 
know as a network engineer, as frame types are very important when config- 
uring specific protocols. 
Node numbers do not have to be unique across networks because the network 
number and node number are used together to identify a particular host. 
Internal Network Numbering and Server Addresses 
IPX contains two types of network numbers: internal network numbers and network 
numbers assigned to local area network (LAN) and some wide area network (WAN) 
interfaces (sometimes called external network numbers). The internal network number 
identifies a virtual network segment inside your server. This means that the internal net- 
work is another (virtual) segment on the network. Therefore, if you configure an 
internal network number on a computer running IPX, a router will add an extra hop in 
its route to that computer. 
www.syngress.com 

322 
Chapter 6 • Network Protocols 
The use of an internal network number allows for improved fault tolerance on the 
network. IPX resources are referenced by SAP names that point to an IPX address. 
Using an internal network number as a part of the SAP address means that in the event 
of a failure of a particular network segment, only the IPX route, not the SAP tables, will 
have to be adjusted to an alternate path. 
The internal network number is an eight-digit hexadecimal number between 0xl to 
0xFFFFFFFE and must be unique across the entire IPX network.Although 
0xFFFFFFFE was originally allowed for use as an address, this changed after the intro- 
duction of Network Link Services Protocol. Both NLSP and IPX RIP have been modi- 
fied since then to recognize 0xFFFFFFFE as the default route. When you use the 
internal network number, the host portion of the IPX address is set to 1. 
How to Translate an IPXAddress 
Figure 6.2 shows an IPX address in more detail. The first 32 bits of the address are the 
network number, which is configured by the network administrator. This number must 
be a hexadecimal value between 0x0000000i and 0xFFFFFFFD. In this case, the net- 
work number is configured as the hexadecimal value 0xBEEE The last 48 bits of the 
address are the same as the Media Access Control (MAC) address of the device's NIC 
(network interface card). In this case, the MAC address of the NIC is 00-20-E0-88-80- 
74, which is also used as the IPX node number.

~!i/:~ili"~iiiiiiiiiiii::'ii~% T DAY TIP 
Prepare for your exam with these very important pieces of information. For the 
Network+ exam, please remember that UNIX and Linux do not support IPX/SPX. 
Windows 2000 and 2003 natively support TCP/IP, IPX/SPX, and NetBEUI. Any 
system running a protocol such as IPX/SPX or NetBEUI is most likely doing so for 
backward compatibility with older applications or systems. Do not get confused 
when you are asked, "what is the best protocol to use for this situation" and 
the answer is IPX/SPX... and you think it's incorrect because its being phased 
out. This could lead you into putting incorrect answers down if you read the 
question and answer set too quickly. 
NetBEUI (Network Basic Input / 
Output System Extended User Interface) 
NetBEUI is an enhanced version of the NetBIOS (Network Basic Input Output 
System) protocol used by network operating systems such as LAN Manager, LAN 
Server, Windows for Workgroups, Windows 95, and Windows NT. NetBEUI was origi- 
nally designed by IBM for their LAN Manager server and was later extended by 
Microsoft and Novell. 
NetBEUI is rarely ever used or seen today. NetBEUI was originally designed for 
very small, non-routable networks, and is broadcast-based. NetBIOS is an API (applica- 
tion program interface) that augments the MS-DOS (Microsoft Disk Operating System) 
BIOS by adding special functions for LANs. Almost all Windows-based LANs for PCs 
are based on and use NetBIOS. Some LAN manufacturers have even extended 
NetBIOS, adding additional network capabilities. NetBIOS is still very much in use 
today. NetBIOS will be covered in more detail later in the chapter.

AppleTalk/AppleTalk over IP 
Apple Computer developed AppleTalk as a plug-and-play protocol for use on Macintosh 
computers. AppleTalk was designed to allow sharing of resources such as files and 
printers among multiple users. Any device attached to an AppleTalk network is known 
as a node. Figure 6.3 shows how the AppleTalk protocol stack maps against the OSI ref- 
erence model.

AppleTalk supports four media-access protocols: 
• 
EtherTalk AppleTalk over Ethernet 
• 
LocalTalk AppleTalk over phone wire 
• 
TokenTalk AppleTalk over Token Ring 
• 
FDDITalk AppleTalk over Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) 
At the Data Link Layer, each of these physical media technologies has its own corre- 
sponding Link Access Protocol (LAP): EtherTalk LAP (ELAP), LocalTalk LAP (LLAP), 
TokenTalk LAP (TLAP), and FDDITalk LAP (FLAP). 
At the Network Layer of AppleTalk are two protocols: AppleTalk Address 
Resolution Protocol (AAtkP), and Datagram Delivery Protocol (DDP). AAKP can be 
compared to ARP in TCP/IE and DDP can be compared to IP in TCP/IP. DDP is 
responsible for transmitting and receiving packets and provides socket-to-socket connec- 
tivity between nodes. 
Five key protocols exist at AppleTalk's Transport Layer: 
• 
AppleTalk Echo Protocol (AEP) This protocol is responsible for testing 
the reachability of network nodes. 
• 
AppleTalk Transaction Protocol (ATP) This protocol is responsible for 
ensuring that communications between a source and destination socket occur 
without any loss. 

Network Protocols • Chapter 6 
325 
• 
Name Binding Protocol (NBP) This protocol is responsible for mapping 
user-friendly entity names to numeric network addresses. 
• 
Routing Table Maintenance Protocol (RTMP) This distance-vector 
routing protocol for AppleTalk is based on IP RIE 
• 
AppleTalk Update-Based Routing Protocol (AURP) This protocol is an 
extension to RTMP that allows two noncontiguous AppleTalk networks to 
talk to each other by tunneling their traffic through IP using UDP (User 
Datagram protocol) encapsulation. 
The Session Layer of AppleTalk consists of four protocols: 
• 
AppleTalk Session Protocol (ASP) This protocol is responsible for estab- 
lishing and maintaining logical connections between clients and servers. ASP 
runs on top of ATP. 
• 
AppleTalk Data Stream Protocol (ADSP) This protocol is responsible for 
reliable transmission of data after a session has been established between two 
nodes. ADSP runs directly on top of DDE 
• 
Zone Information Protocol (ZIP) This protocol maintains network-to- 
zone-number mappings. 
• 
Printer Access Protocol (PAP) This protocol is used to establish connec- 
tions between clients and servers (usually print servers). PAP runs on top of 
ATP. 
The most important of the AppleTalk protocols is AFP (AppleTalk Filing Protocol) 
AFP sits at the Presentation and Application Layers and allows files and directories to be 
shared over a network. AFP relies on ASP, ATE and AEE AFP is covered in more detail 
later in the chapter. 
Apple Talk Addressing 
Like TCP/IP and IPX/SPX, AppleTalk uses addresses to identify and locate devices on a 
network.AppleTalk addresses consist of three elements: 
• 
Network number (2 bytes) The network number specifies the value of a 
unique AppleTalk network. Valid network numbers in AppleTalk are 1 through 
65,279. The network number 0 is reserved for the local network. Network 
numbers 65,280 through 65,534 are reserved for the startup process. 
• 
Node number (1 byte) The node number specifies a unique AppleTalk 
node attached to a particular network. Valid node numbers are 1 through 253 
(255 is reserved for broadcasts, and 0 and 254 are not allowed).

Chapter 6 • Network Protocols 
• 
Socket number (1 byte) The socket number specifies a particular socket 
running on a node. Sockets in AppleTalk are similar to ports in TCP/IP; they 
represent a process or a service on a host. Sockets addresses are 8 bits long; 
there can be a maximum of 254 sockets on a node (socket numbers 0 and 255 
are reserved). Sockets 1 through 127 are statically assigned, and sockets 128 
through 254 are available for dynamic assignment. 
AppleTalk addresses are generally written as three decimal values (network number, 
node number, socket number) separated by periods. For example, the address 5.3.20 
means network 5, node 3, and socket 20. 
Addresses are assigned dynamically using AAtLE When an AppleTalk node boots up, 
it selects an arbitrary node number on the network. It then sends an AA1LP request to 
see if any other node on the network is using that address. If no response is received, the 
node keeps the address. If another node is already using the address, this node selects a 
new node number and sends another request to ensure that no other nodes are using 
that node number. The process repeats itself until no AA1KP response is received. An 
AppleTalk device stores the last used network address in NVRAM (non-volatile random 
access memory) and attempts to reuse that network address the next time it boots up. 
AARP is also used for AppleTalk node to Layer 2 address mapping, similar to how AILP 
works in IP. Layer 3 to Layer 2 address mappings are stored on an AppleTalk host in the 
address mapping table (AMT). 
There are two types of AppleTalk networks, Phase 1 and Phase 2. Phase 1 networks 
(also known as non-extended networks) have a limit of 253 nodes on a network. Phase 2 
networks (also known as extended networks) overcome the 253-host limitation by using 
the concept of a cable range. Instead of a single network number, as in Phase 1, a Phase 2 
segment can be assigned a sequential range of network numbers. This range of network 
numbers behaves as a single network and is known as a cable range. Each network 
number in a cable range can have 253 nodes. A cable range is expressed as a pair of 
hyphen-separated network numbers. For example, the cable range 4001-4004 encom- 
passes the network numbers 4001, 4002, 4003, and 4004. Note that a cable range could 
consist of just a single network number. For example, the cable range 4005-4005 consists 
of the single network number 4005. 
Zones andAppleTalk Communication 
A zone in AppleTalk consists of a logical grouping of network devices. The idea behind 
zones is to enable users to locate network services easily. The Chooser program on an 
Apple Macintosh computer identifies all services within a zone and presents them in a 
single list. Zone names are assigned arbitrarily by network administrators and are gener- 
ally based on geographic or organizational boundaries.A host can belong only to one 
zone, and all services published by the host appear within that zone. 
A single zone can span one ore more networks, and multiple zones can exist on a 
single network. The Zone Information Protocol operates at the Session Layer and is

responsible for mapping networks to zone names throughout the network. When a host 
boots up on the network, ZIP provides it a list of zone names. 
TCP/IP 
In the 1970s, IP was developed as part of the Transmission Control Protocol effort to 
provide logically addressed and structured networking. Since then, IP has matured 
greatly and can convey a wide array of information and services. The primary role of IP 
is to provide logical addresses and support the routing of traffic to its destination. Recent 
efforts to expand the capacity of IP addresses (which are nearly exhausted) have resulted 
in the next generation of the protocol, IP version 6 (IPv6). IP supports the ability to 
send to a group via multicasting. These topics are covered in the next sections, starting 
with IP version 4 (IPv4). 
IP provides the Network Layer addressing and functions for the TCP/IP protocol 
stack, as shown in Figure 6.4. The TCP/IP protocol stack does not map neatly to the 
OSI model, as the OSI model was developed after TCP/IP.

most basic and fundamental onesmthe ones more commonly seen on the job 
and in production environments. 
IPv4 
IP is responsible for addressing and delivery by providing a logical address scheme. The 
original version of IP (referred to as IPv4) consists of 32 bits spread over four 8-bit 
octets, expressed in dotted decimal format. For example, a 32-bit address may look like this 
in binary: 
00001010000010110000110000001101 
www.syngress.com 

Network Protocols • Chapter 6 
329 
To improve readability, the 32-bit IP address splits into four blocks of 8 bits like this: 
00001010 
00001011 
00001100 
00001101 
Finally, each 8-bit block is converted to decimal and the decimal values are separated 
with periods or dots. The converted IPv4 address, expressed as a dotted decimal address, is: 
i0.ii.12.13 
It is much easier to remember an IP address of 10.11.12.13 than to remember a 
string of bits such as 00001010000010110000110000001101. IP addresses and their 
values and uses are discussed in detail later in this chapter. 
All information transported over IP is carried in IP packets with the format shown 
in Figure 6.5. The header length can vary somewhat depending on whether the options 
field is present and the number of bits that are used to specify these options. This varia- 
tion in length adds to the processing burden, as predictability and consistency are not 
achieved.

IPv6 
Issues such as address exhaustion that made IPv4 inadequate require robust solutions. 
While 32 bits of address space were originally thought to be more than enough, time 
and growth have proven this to not be the case.Address space depletion will be covered 
later in this chapter. IPv6, if implemented fully in the future, will solve the depletion 
problem, as the newer version of the IP protocol allows for far greater amounts of 
addressing to be deployed than its predecessor, IPv4. Additionally, IPv4 suffers from a 
lack of hierarchical structure; while addresses may be sequentially allocated and summa- 
rized, they are not optimized by routing or allocation. 
Designers of IPv6 worked diligently to ensure that the same issues would not be 
encountered. Members of the Internet community who were responsible for developing 
the protocol carefully scrutinized each new 1KFC (Request for Comment) penned for 
IE This section covers IPv6, which was developed to overcome the exhaustion of IPv4 
addresses, and to improve on it in general. As defined in 1KFC 1884 and later revised in 
1KFC 2373, IPv6 addresses are 128-bit identifiers for interfaces and sets of interfaces, not 
nodes. Three general types of addresses exist within IPv6 (IP version 6); unicast, anycast, 
and multicast. IP addresses are structured as follows: 
• 
Expanded addressing moves us from 32-bit address to a 128-bit addressing 
method. 
• 
Provides newer unicast and broadcasting methods. 
• 
Hexadecimal fused into the IP address format. 
• 
Uses ":" instead of"." as delimiters. 
• 
To write 128-bit addresses so that they aremore readable to human eyes and 
not a complete chore to apply, IPv6 allows for using a hexadecimal format. 
IPv6 is written as 32-hex digits, with colons (:) separating the values of the 
eight 16=bit pieces of the address. 
• 
IPv6 addresses are written in hexadecimal format: 
7060:0000:0000:0000:0006:0600:100D:315B 
• 
Leading 0s in each 16-bit value can be omitted, so this address can be 
expressed as follows: 7060:0:0:0:6:600:100D:315B 
• 
IPv6 addresses may contain consecutive 16-bit values of 0, one such string of 
0s per address can be omitted and replaced by a double colon (::).As a result, 
this address can be shortened even more: 7060::6:600:100D:315B

Benefits of I Pv6 
The following sections look at the two main problems solved by IPv6--address deple- 
tion and routing scalability--in more detail. Some added benefits that IPv6 gives to net- 
work designers and administrators include: 
• 
Increased IP address size 
• 
Increased addressing hierarchy support 
• 
Simplified host addressing (unified addressing: global, site, local) 
• 
Simplified auto-configuration of addresses (easier readdressing, DHCPv6 
(Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 6), and neighbor discovery 
instead of A1KP broadcasts) 
• 
Improved scalability of multicast routing 
• 
The anycast address 
• 
A streamlined header 
Improved security (security extension headers, integrated data integrity) 
Better performance (aggregation, neighbor discovery instead of A1ZP broad- 
casts, no fragmentation, no header checksum, flow, priority, integrated quality 
of service [QoS]) 
I Pv4 versus I Pv6 
How does IPv6 compare with its predecessor, IPv4? IPv6 eases the network adminis- 
trator's burden, in that aggregatable global unicast addresses do not require address transla- 
tion when used to access external networks such as the Internet. In IPv4, private address 
spaces are used when global addresses are unavailable. These private addresses must be 
translated to a limited set of global addresses when accessing external networks. IPv4 
address translation schemes include NAT (network address translation) and PAT (port 
address translation). IPv6 virtually eliminates the need for address translation as a means 
of accessing external networks. 
Table 6.1 illustrates the reduced address administration burden placed upon IPv6 
network administrators.

Understanding IP Addressing 
IPv4 is widely used today as the foundation of network addressing in both private net- 
works and across the Internet. It is widely known simply as TCP/IP. In order to effec- 
tively manage a network in today's complex environment, it's critical to understand IP 
addressing in depth. IP addressing is used to assign a unique logical address to a host for 
identification purposes. Assigning the IP address to a host is a relatively simple process, 
especially if the host uses DHCP to automatically acquire that address. However, most 
networks are divided into more efficient segments called subnets. 
Understanding addressing related to subnets is a bit more complex, so we'll begin by 
exploring some of the mathematics underlying this process. Let's start by dissecting the 
IP address and learning how to manipulate it. 
IP addresses are expressed in four sets of three numbers, such as 136.14.117.5. Each 
of the numbers between the dots is called an octet because, when converted to binary 
notation, it represents eight binary digits (bits). Binary notation is covered in the next 
section. Every IP address has 32 bits and can be notated as wuav.xxx.yyy.zzz or mx.y.z. 
This is called dotted decimal notation. When the value of any one of the octets is less than 
three digits, it is written without leading zeroes. Therefore, you'll see IP addresses with 
one, two, or three digits in each section, such as 254.4.27.112. However, when the value 
of the octet is zero, it is still written as zero because each octet must be represented (for 
example, 129.48.0.95). The notation is often shortened to mx.y.z to represent the four 
www.syngress.com 

336 
Chapter 6 • Network Protocols 
octets. The longer notation, www.xxx.yyy.zzz is used to indicate that each position can 
be a maximum of three digits. In this chapter, we'll use both notations. 
Each IP address contains two elements, the network address space and the host 
address space. Throughout this text, we'll use address and 1D interchangeably, and we may 
also refer to the network ID or the host ID. Understanding how to work with IP 
addressing is a fundamental skill that will be used throughout your career in Information 
Technology and throughout many other certification exams, not just the Network+ 
exam. Take the time to understand this information thoroughly if you want to ensure 
your success on the exam and on the job. 
WARNING 
You must understand the IP address to successfully navigate the Network+ 
exam. Make absolutely certain that you read the following sections until you are 
comfortable with the material within. 
Converting from Decimal to Binary 
In everyday life, we use the decimal numbering system for counting. The decimal system 
relies on the digits 0 through 9. This is the system we use for the standard math that we 
do in our heads. However, this is not the only way to denote numbers. The binary 
system relies on only two digits: 0 and 1. It's the language of the computer because elec- 
trical components are either on or off, and thus electrical signals (or 1KF signals or light 
impulses) can easily represent 0 with an off status and 1 with an on status. Although 
there are some exceptions, for the purpose of this discussion, we will use this conven- 
tion. Each binary digit is called a bit and in IP addressing, eight bits form an octet. An IP 
address has four octets, or a total of 32 bits. 
Any whole number from our decimal system can be represented in binary. Each 
location, or bit position, in a binary number has a certain weight, just as in our com- 
monly used decimal system. For example, we know that in the decimal system, a digit in 
the first position f?om the right represents ones, a digit in the second position represents 
tens, a digit in the third position represents hundreds, and so forth. When we see the 
number 384, we don't even have to stop and think to know that it means 3 hundreds, 8 
tens (eighty) and 4 ones. 
As with decimal, the weighting in a binary number moves from low-order on the 
right to high-order on the left. Although our eyes are accustomed to understanding dec- 
imal numbers when we read them left to right, many people find it easier to work with 
binary numbers from right to left.

~ 
conversion as part of a more complex process, usually in calculating subnet 
masks. It's easy to calculate subnet masks if you understand the basic funda- 
mentals of binary and decimal conversion. 
Binary numbers typically are counted beginning with bit 0, the right-most bit. This 
has a value of 2 °, or 1. Each bit to the left is raised (exponentially) to the next power, 
which effectively doubles the number. Thus, bit 1 is 21 or 2, and so forth, as shown in 
Table 6.4. This formula is typically expressed as 2 n where n is the bit number.

If you're not familiar with binary numbers, you may be wondering why this num- 
bering system is set up this way. If you take the right-most position, the bit 0 position, 
and set it to 0, the number is 0. If you set bit 0 to 1, the number is 1. How do we get to 
2? We set the next bit, bit 1, to 1 and reset bit 0 to 0. This is just like in the decimal 
numbering system in which you count, in the right-most position, from 0 to 9. After 
nine, you move to the next position, set it to 1 and reset the first position to 0, resulting 
in the decimal number 10. Binary works the same way, except that each bit position can 
be only 0 or 1, thus you need more positions in order to represent decimal numbers. 
To create a binary number, we set the desired bit to 1. For instance, to represent the 
number 128, we would set the 8 th position, or bit 7 (remember, we're counting from 0 
to 7, not 1 to 8), to 1. What if we wanted to create the number 132? We'd set bit 7 and 
bit 2 to 1. The rest of the bits would remain 0, as shown in Table 6.5. Any number can 
be expressed this way, limited only by the number of bits in a defined field (in TCP/!E 
we use only eight bits for each number).

To convert a binary number to decimal, add the value of each bit position set to 1. 
Thus, the binary number 10000100 converts to decimal 132. 
To convert a decimal number to a binary number, look at the decimal number and 
find the largest binary bit represented. If we want to convert 184 to binary, we do the 
math shown in Table 6.6. For each number we subtract, we set the corresponding bit to 1.

Using this example, 184 can be notated as 10111000 with the 128, 32, 16, and 8 bits 
set to 1, and the rest set to 0. As you become accustomed to working with both binary 
and decimal conversions, you may not need to do this lengthy math; eventually you 
might simply be able to do this in your head. Let's look at Exercise 6.1, which will help 
you master the concept of converting decimal and binary numbers. 
CONVERTING DECIMAL AND BINARY NUMBERS 
This exercise is designed to reinforce what we've learned about binary and dec- 
imal conversions. Remember, you will not get a question that explicitly asks you 
to do these steps, but you may be required to do them to figure out if a subnet 
mask is incorrectly shown on the exam. Understanding this conversion process 
is the cornerstone of understanding the IP addressing system. 
1. 
Convert the following number to binary: 24. Using the technique 
described in this section, we first write out the bit values of an octet: 
128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1. Next, we look for the highest value that is 
less than the number given. In this case, the highest number is 16. We 
set bit 4, which is equivalent to decimal 16, to 1. Next we subtract 16 
from our number: 24- 16 = 8. We set bit 3, equivalent to decimal 8, to 
1. We subtract 8- 8 = 0 and we have no remainder. Thus, we have the 
16 and 8 bits set to 1, and all other bits are zero: 00011000.

Convert the following number to decimal: 00001011. In this case, we 
have to do just the opposite of what we did in the first conversion. 
Now, we write the bit values of the octet and add up any bit values set 
to 1. The octet numbers are 128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1. The following bits 
are set to 1: 8, 2, 1. We add 8 + 2 + 1 to yield 11, the decimal equiva- 
lent of this binary notation. 
Convert the following number to binary: 255.0.132.2. Let's work on 
each octet, one at a time. Let's begin with the left-most octet, 255. By 
now, you might recognize that the 255 is all ls. If not, this is a handy 
fact to remember. To calculate its value, we begin by subtracting the 
highest bit value less than 255. (The bit value being subtracted is in 
bold to make it easier to read). In this case, that's 128. 255- 128 = 
127. Again, we subtract the largest bit value: 127 - 64 = 63. Repeating 
this process we get: 63-32 = 31.31-16 
= 15. 15-8 = 7.7-4= 
3. 
3 - 2 = 1.1 - 1 = 0. For each bit value we subtract (128, 64, etcetera) 
we set the corresponding bit position to 1. Thus, the binary equivalent 
is 11111111. The next octet (x) is easy; it's all 0s. The octet is written as 
00000000. The third octet (y) is equal to 132. Using our subtraction 
technique, we know that the 128 bit will be set to 1. 132 - 128 = 4. 
Thus, we set the 4 bit to 1, yielding this octet: 10000100. The final 
octet (z) is 2. This is easy to figure outmthe second bit is set to 1, the 
rest of the bits are 0. The octet is 00000010. Putting this all together, 
we have 11111111.00000000.10000100.00000010 
Convert the following number to dotted decimal notation: 
00001000.00001111.001 01101.10101010. In this case, we need to con- 
vert this number to dotted decimal by adding the values of each bit 
position set to 1. Again, we'll start on the left. In the first octet, the 
only position set to 1 is the 8 position. In the second octet, the right- 
most four bits are set to 1. If you're becoming familiar with the dif- 
ferent bit patterns, you'll immediately recognize 15. Otherwise, add the 
bit values of 1, 2, 4, and 8 together to yield 15. The next octet (y) has 
the following bit positions set to 1: 32, 8, 4, 1. If you have difficulty 
with this, write out the bit values 128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1, and then write 
out the octet underneath. You'll see which bit positions are set to 1 and 
you can add those values. In this case, it equals 45. The final octet, z, 
has the following bit positions set to 1: 128, 32, 8, 2. Adding these 
results yields 170. The resulting dotted decimal notation for this is 
8.15.45.170. 
Convert the following number to binary: 112.64.117.3 Again, we'll use 
our subtraction method to find the largest bit value that is lower than 
the number and subtract it from the number. We'll repeat the process 
until the remainder is 0. For each number we subtract (shown in bold), 
we set the corresponding bit to 1. Our answer looks like this:

Fourth octet (z): 3 - 2 = 1. 1 - 1 = 0 = 00000011 
Putting the four octets together yields this dotted decimal notation: 
01110000.01000000.01110101.00000011 
Although the adding and subtracting may seem simplistic, it's important to 
practice this over and over, so you can actually look at an octet and add up the 
values in your head or at least recognize the values and add them with a calcu- 
lator. It's simple math that simply requires close attention to detail. It's easy to 
inadvertently miss a bit position. Writing down the sequence can help you avoid 
these kinds of errors. 
It's a good idea to practice converting binary to decimal, as you'll need to know 
how to do this when working on your network and as well as the Network+ exam. The 
key is to break each octet down individually and check your work by adding up the 
value of the bits you've set. This will help ensure that your math and your logic are both 
correct and will reduce common errors when you set up subnets, subnet masks, and 
other IP addresses. 
{i~i{{i{ ii'::: After you're situated in the exam room at the testing computer, take a minute 
'~iiiiiiiiiii ~:' 
or two before starting the test to write down all your tips and tricks for the 
exam on the blank paper provided (and make sure you do this before you start 
the exam because your allocated time doesn't begin until you actually start). It's 
a good idea to write down 128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1. Then, when you're 
asked a question about binary or decimal conversions, you won't make an error 
simply because you forgot that 32 is in between 16 and 64. If you practice 
these conversions enough, you'll actually begin to recognize patterns immedi- 
atelymyou'll know that 00001111 is 15 and 00001010 is 10, and so on. It's not 
difficult math, but you have to pay very careful attention to the details. One 
missed bit changes everything! 
Network ID and Host ID 
Now that you've learned how to convert binary to decimal and back again, let's look at 
the principals underlying networking with IP addresses. An IP address has two elements, 
the network address and the host address. As we've discussed, the IP address is a unique 
www.syngress.com 

Network Protocols • Chapter 6 
341 
address assigned to a computer or device (printer, router, etcetera) connected to the net- 
work. The network address is a fixed address used to identify a common network. 
Within each IP address is a network address (shared by all computers on that network) 
and a unique host address. When combined, the result is a single unique IP address on 
the network. 
All hosts (also called nodes when talking about connected network devices) on the 
same network segment must have the same network ID. A good analogy is the U.S. zip 
code system. There are many houses on a street, each with a unique street address (host 
ID) but all of them have the same zip code within a certain area (network ID). The 
street address combined with the zip code is a unique combination that identifies a par- 
ticular house or building just as an IP address identifies a particular host. Figure 6.6 illus- 
trates this concept.

Large networks are usually divided by routers. Routers (first covered in Chapter 3, 
"Network Devices") separate one segment from another and only pass along data destined 
for external networks (those on the other side of the router). If the data is intended for a 
host within the segment, the router does not forward it to the external segment(s). This 
reduces network trat~c and increases response times. In order for this to work, however, 
each segment of the network must have a unique identifier, which is the network address 
or network ID. Primary network IDs are managed by the Internet Network Information 
Center (InterNIC), an organization that manages top-level network addresses to prevent 
two organizations from using the same network ID. Two networks connected to the 
Internet cannot use the same network ID (networks that are completely standalone and 
have no connection to the Internet can use any network ID you wish). 

342 
Chapter 6 • Network Protocols 
Originally, network IDs were divided into classes: Class A, B, C, and D. Each class 
had a specific purpose and a defined range of allowable addresses. The goal was to pro- 
vide for three common scenarios in networking: 
• 
Small number of very large networks (large number of nodes per network) 
• 
Moderate number of medium-sized networks 
• 
Large number of very small networks (small number of nodes per network) 
This class-based system worked weR for quite some time. However, in the 1990s, 
when the Internet boom period (the massive growth of the Internet) began, it became 
clear that the addressing scheme would not support the many hundreds of thousands of 
networks that were popping up (and getting connected to the global network) around 
the world. A new classless system was devised. It still uses IP addressing fundamentals, but 
it extends the original concept. The class-based system now often is referred to as classful, 
to differentiate it from the classless addressing system. We'll discuss the classless system 
(also called variable length subnet masking or VLSMfor shorO later in this chapter. For now, 
let's look at the class-based system to understand network addressing fundamentals. 
The 32-bit IP address is subdivided into two portions: the network address space 
and the host address space. The use of 32-bits does not change, but the use of the bits 
within the 32-bit address changes in order to define four classes of addresses. There are 
currently five defined address classes: Class A, B, C, D, and E. Microsoft Windows Server 
2003 supports four address classes: A, B, C, and D. It does not support Class E addresses, 
which are considered experimental at this time. In addition, there are several guidelines 
regarding allowable or legal addresses for network IDs and for host IDs. As we learned 
earlier, the notation used is called dotted decimal and is also represented as w.x.I,.z to 
denote the four octets used. 
WARNING 
The 32-bit IP address is subdivided into two portions: the network address 
space and the host address space. You must know how to identify IP addresses 
correctly on the Network+ exam. You must also know how to identify an IP 
~i~iiliiiii!i address by its class, as well as its default subnet masks. Please pay very close 
attention to these areas as you proceed through the text. A lot of the material 
here is to get you to learn how to do this, not just memorize it for the exam. 
You can't fake the understanding of IP addressing on the exam, and rote mem- 
orization is no cure either. You must be able to clearly identify IP addressing 
issues on the Network+ exam and how to solve them. You will not be asked to 
create an elaborate design for a complex network, but you may see diagrams of 
segments that you need to work with. Understanding IP addressing will help 
you to successfully navigate these questions and pass these section objectives 
on the exam.

Rules for Network IDs 
The following rules apply to creating or using network IDs in a class-based system. 
• 
Network IDs cannot begin with 127 as the first octet, such as 127.14.102.6. 
127.x.y.z is reserved for loopback addresses. A loopback address is used to test 
IP software on the host computer and is not associated with the computer's 
hardware. 
• 
A Network ID cannot have all bits set to 1. This configuration is reserved for 
broadcast addresses. 
• 
A Network ID cannot have all bits set to 0. This configuration is reserved for 
indicating a host on the local network. 
• 
A Network ID must be unique to the IP network. If you have three network 
segments in your corporate network, each segment must have a unique net- 
work ID. 
Rules for Host IDs 
The following rules apply to creating and assigning host IDs. 
• 
A Host ID cannot have all bits set to 1. This configuration is reserved for 
broadcast addresses. 
• 
A Host ID cannot have all bits set to 0. This configuration is reserved for the 
expression of IP network IDs. 
• 
A Host ID must be unique to the network on which it resides. 
Just like modern day humanity, there is obviously a class system with IP addressing 
and this one is needed to keep the IP address space organized and readily available for 
use. In the next section we will cover the IP addressing class system. 
Class A Addresses 
Class A addresses are designed for very large networks with few logical network seg- 
ments and many hosts. Class A addresses always have the high-order bit (or left-most bit) 
set to zero. The first octet (the left-most eight bits) is used to define the network ID. The 
host addresses use the second, third, and fourth octets. This can also be represented as w 
= network ID, x.y.z 
- host ID (using the convention that all IP addresses are composed 
off our octets and represented as w.x.y.z). Let's look at an example: 01110000 00000000 
00001100 00001111 is a Class A address. The network ID (in bold) is 112. The host ID 
is 0.12.15.Thus, this IP address is 112.0.12.15. Other hosts on the same network would 
all have IP addresses that begin with 112. 
www.syngress.com 

344 
Chapter 6 • Network Protocols 
With the high-order bit set to 0, by definition, a Class A address cannot be greater 
than 127 since a value of 128 would require the left-most bit be set to 1. To calculate 
the number of possiblenetworks, use the formula 2^n or 2 n, where n is the number of 
bits in the octet that can be used. In this case, we cannot use the left-most bit, so n in 
this case is 7.2A7 or 27 equals 128. However, we know that we cannot have a network 
set to 127 (loopback) and we cannot have a network of all 0s or all ls. Therefore, we 
have 126 useable network addresses. We can also calculate how many possible host 
addresses we have in a Class A network by using the same formula. In this case, we're 
using three octets for host IDs. Therefore, we have 2 24 or 16,777,216. Again, we cannot 
use addresses of all 0s or all ls, so we have 16,777,214 useable host addresses available. 
Class B 
Class B addresses are used for medium-sized networks that have a moderate number of 
hosts connected to them. Class B addresses always have the first two high-order bits 
(left-most) set to 10. The Class B network ID uses the first two octets for the network 
ID. This allows for more network IDs and fewer hosts than a Class A network. Since it 
uses an additional octet for the network, there is one fewer octet available for host IDs, 
reducing the number of hosts that can be addressed on this network by approximately a 
factor of two. 
Here's a Class B IP address: 10010001 00001100 00001010 00001001.This trans- 
lates into 160.12.10.9.The first two octets (160.12) represent the network ID and the 
last two octets (10.9) represent the host ID portion of this IP address.Thus, the schema 
is w.x = network ID, y.z = host ID. Notice that the two high-order bits are set to 10. 
Class B networks use the first two octets for the network ID. However, we cannot set 
the second bit to 1 (Class B left-most two bits must be 10). Therefore, we can calculate 
that there are a total of 2 TM or 16,384 Class B network addresses (16 bits for network ID, 
but we cannot use the first two bits because they must be set to 10). Since we are 
required to set the first two bits to 10, we will not end up with a network address that is 
all 0s or all ls; therefore we do not need to subtract from our total network IDs to find 
available network IDs. To calculate the number of hosts on a Class B network, we know 
that we use 16 bits (two octets) for the host ID. Thus, we have 65,536 total host IDs and 
we cannot use all 0s or all ls, resulting in 65,534 available host IDs on a Class B network. 
Class C 
Class C addresses are for small networks with few hosts. These addresses have the first 
three high-order bits set to 110. Class C addresses use the first three octets for the net- 
work ID and the last octet for the host ID. Using your understanding of IP addressing at 
this point, how many host addresses will be available in each Class C network? If you 
answered 256 (0 through 255), you'd be close. If you add each bit (128 + 64 + 32 + 16 
+ 8 + 4 + 2 + 1), it totals 256, but remember we cannot use an address of all 0s or all 

Network Protocols • Chapter 6 
345 
ls. We're left with 254 possible addresses. The schema for the Class C IP address is w.x.y 
= network ID, z - host ID. 
Class C networks use the left-most three bits set to 110. To calculate the number of 
networks available, we calculate the total bits available, in this case 24 (three octets) - 3 
(first three bits must be 110) - 21. Using the formula 221 we see that the number of 
Class C networks is 2,097,152. Again, because the left-most three bits must be set to 
110, we do not need to subtract for network IDs of all 0s or all ls. As we saw, the 
number of host IDs is 254 based on 28- 2 - 256- 2 or 254. 
Class D and Class E 
Class D is reserved for IP multicast addresses. The first four high-order bits are set to 
1110. The remaining 28 bits are used for individual IP multicast addresses. Multicast 
Backbone on the Internet (MBONE) is an extension to the Internet that supports IP mul- 
ticasts and uses Class D addresses. MBONE allows a single packet to have multiple desti- 
nations and is most often used in real-time audio and video applications. Multicasting 
will be covered later in this chapter. 
Class E addresses are reserved for future use. This class is considered experimental 
and the addresses are defined as "reserved for future use."The first five high-order bits 
are set to 11110. 
Address Class Summary 
This is by far one of the most important sections for the Network+ exam. IP addresses 
are 32-bit addresses divided into four octets. Each octet has eight bits and a maximum 
value of 255, which is when all eight bits are set to 1. Each address class defines the 
maximum number of networks (or subnets, actually) and hosts. These are summarized in 
Tables 6.7 and 6.8.

Understanding Subnetting 
~ 
A Class A network could theoretically have 16,777,214 hosts. However, in a real world 
application, this would be impractical. Most networks are broken down into smaller seg- 
ments that are easier to manage. It is possible to assign such a network, although it 
would be very fiat, and very large by default. As you recall, there are some instances 
when information is broadcast on a network. Imagine broadcasts to and from 16 million 
hosts. The network would come to a grinding halt from all that traffic. Therefore, 
although a company may have a Class A network ID, it will segment (divide) that net- 
work to avoid having 16 million hosts per network. This process of segmenting is called 
subnetting. Each segment or subnet must have a unique identifier so that traffic can be 
sent to the correct location. Since the network ID is a fixed number assigned by the 
InterNIC, a method was devised to subdivide the assigned network ID by borrowing 
bits from the host address space, not the network address space. An assigned Class A net- 
work assigns the network ID using only the first octet. A subnetted Class A network 
might use bits from the second and third octets to create new subnetworks. 
Although it's theoretically possible to use any host octet bits, in practice they are 
always used starting from the left-most host address space bit moving to the right. In 
other words, we take the high-order host address bits first.Table 6.9 shows the resulting 
number of subnets and number of host bits used when subnetting a Class A network.

The process is identical to extend the number of subnets on a Class A network 
beyond 256 by taking additional host address bits from the next octet (where w.x and y 
are used for network and only z is left for host addresses). This process is similar for Class 
B and Class C networks as well, although the number of subnets and hosts will vary. 
We can identify the number of bits used for the network by notating how many 
total bits (counting left to right) are used in the network address. From there, we can 
calculate how many bits remain for host addresses. A Class A network subdivided to 
allow up to 16 subnets uses 12 bits for the network ID, leaving 20 bits for host addresses. 
This is commonly denoted with a/12 to show that 12 bits are used for the network ID. 
An example of this notation is 66.192.15.4/12.This is sometimes referred to verbally as 
"slash 12". As a reminder, your understanding of subnet masks is important. For the 
exam, you will not need to do very hard calculations, and you will not need to under- 
stand IP addressing at the level explained within this chapter.You will be asked questions 
that are far less complex than those within this chapter's exercises. The point of the 
chapter is to get you so good at IP addressing and give you such a solid explanation of it 
that when you do get IP addressing questions on your Network+ exam, you can annihi- 
late them with ease and waste little time on what will be common knowledge to you 
come test time.

Chapter 6 • Network Protocols 
Understanding Subnet Masking 
Large networks are subdivided to create smaller subnetworks to reduce overall network 
traffic by keeping local traffic on the local subnet and sending all non-local traffic to the 
router. In order to create a subnetwork, we need to have a system for addressing that 
allows us to use the network ID and host ID within the class-based system. This is 
www.syngress.com

accomplished through the use of a subnet mask. In essence, a subnet mask is a 32-bit 
number that is combined with the IP address (network address and host address) to 
shield or mask certain bits, thus creating a new, unique number. 
The 32-bit IP address is composed of the network ID and the host ID. The number 
of host IDs on a network is variable, but the network ID must be the same for all hosts 
on a segment. For example, in a Class C network, you can have from 1 to 254 hosts. 
Suppose you wanted to divide your Class C network into two networks with 100 hosts 
each? You could use your Class C network ID with a subnet mask and virtually divide 
your network into two parts. This is done by borrowing bits from the host ID portion 
of the IP address. When you take bits from the host address space, you reduce the 
number of potential host addresses roughly by a factor of two. If this sounds a bit con- 
fusing, don't worry. We're going to walk through this step-by-step. The underlying con- 
cept of subnets and subnet masking involves a binary process called bitwise ANDing. 
ANDing is actually a fairly simple concept to understand and perform. 
How Bitwise ANDing Works 
The term ANDing comes from a form of mathematics called Boolean algebra. 
Computers use Boolean operators in their circuitry. Integrated circuits contain components 
known as gates and inverters. A gate (or inverter) has one or more inputs. Their output is 
based on the state of those inputs. The state can only be off (0) or on (1). In Boolean 
terms, it can only be true (1) or false (0). AND gates will return (or output) 1 if all 
inputs are 1 and will return 0 if an), input is not 1. An OR. gate will return 1 if an}, 
input is 1 and will return 0 only if no input signals are 1. 
You may be familiar with Boolean operators in using search engines.You can refine 
your search by using Boolean operators, including AND and OR.. There are other, less 
commonly used operators such as NAND (not AND) and XOR (exclusive OR), but 
these are outside the scope of this discussion. 
Bitwise ANDing simply means that we are performing the logical AND function on 
each bit. The simple AND statements can be expressed as shown here. Rather than a 
mathematical plus function, this is a comparison between two (or more) values.

Notice that the logical AND function results in a 1 only when both inputs are 1; 
otherwise, the result is 0. Next, let's take a slightly more complicated example, still using 
bitwise ANDing. Look at Table 6.10 to see the results.

Now let's explore how bitwise ANDing is used in subnetting. 
EXERCISE 6.2 
BITWlSE ANDING 
Exercise 6.2 is designed to give you practice with bitwise ANDing. Each question 
is followed by a step-by-step answer.

and our subnet mask is the underlying network ID, in this case 
146.64.160.0. Once you have delineated your subnet IDs and deter- 
mined your subnet mask, you can check your work by performing the 
ANDing process to verify the result is the underlying subnet network ID.

In this example, the underlying network ID was not readily 
apparent. By using bitwise ANDing, we were able to extract the network 
ID. 
What is the network ID of this IP address: 146.64.187.112/20? As you 
recall, the notation/20 indicates we're using 20 bits from the network 
address space. Thus, we know that our subnet mask must use 1 in the 
left-most 20 locations. Our bitwise ANDing results in a network ID of:

Default Subnet Mask 
A subnet mask is a four-octet number used to identify the network ID portion of a 32- 
bit IP address. A subnet mask is required on all class-based networks, even on networks 
that are not subnetted. A default subnet mask is based on the IP address classes we dis- 
cussed earlier and is used on networks that are not subdivided. If your network is not 
subnetted, you must use the subnet mask associated with your IP address class. The 
default subnet masks are shown in dotted decimal format in Table 6.11.

Chapter 6 • Network Protocols 
We've already discussed the fact that a Class A network uses the first octet as the 
network address.You can see from the default subnet mask shown in the preceding table 
that the first octet is set to all ls (dotted decimal 255). Recall that a network ID cannot 
be set to all l s. Thus, when you use logical ANDing with any Class A network and the 
default subnet mask, it will always yield the Class A network ID. For example, if the 
Class A network ID is 66.x.y.z, it would be represented as 01000010.x.y.z. The default 
subnet mask is represented as 11111111 .x.y.z. The logical AND function, shown in Table 
6.12, yields 01000010.x.y.z.

Custom Subnet Mask 
Most networks are subnetted because the number of hosts allowed in both Class A and 
Class B networks is well beyond what could be used in practical application. Subnetting 
is accomplished by using bits from the host address space for the network address space. 
The custom subnet mask (also called a variable length subnet mask) is used to iden- 
tify the bits used for a network address versus the bits used for a host address. Custom subnet 
masks are used when subnetting or supernetting. As we've discussed, subnetting is the pro- 
cess of dividing one network into many. Supernetting uses a single IP address to repre- 
sent many unique IP addresses. Supernetting is the process of allocating a range or block 
of network IDs (typically Class C) instead of a single Class A or B network ID to pre- 
serve Class A and B networks for uses that require a large number of host addresses. 
To determine the appropriate custom subnet mask (typically referred to simply as 
subnet mask) for a network, you must first: 
1. 
Determine the number of host bits to be used for subnetting. 
2. 
Determine the new subnetted network IDs. 
3. 
Determine the IP addresses for each new subnet. 
4. 
Determine the appropriate subnet mask. 
Determine the Number of Host Bits to Be Used 
We can create a subnet mask by using bits that would normally be used for host 
addresses. The number of required subnets will determine the number of host bits to be used. An 
important element of this process is determining the maximum number of subnets you 
may need in the future, to avoid having to reassign addresses when your network grows. 
Allow for more subnets than you plan to use, within reason. Also keep in mind that the 
www.syngress.com 

Network Protocols • Chapter 6 
353 
more host bits you use for subnets, the fewer host IDs you'll have left for assigning to 
your connected devices. There is a trade-off between allowing for adequate subnet 
growth and retaining adequate host IDs for all connected devices. 
Let's look at an example using a Class B network, which uses the two left-most 
octets for the network ID and the two right-most octets for the host ID. If you had no 
subnets, you would have 65,534 host addresses available to use. Suppose you wanted to 
have two subnets? How would you determine your subnet mask and how many host 
IDs would you have available to you? 
If you take one bit from the host address space, you would be able to create two 
networks, each with 32,768 host addresses. If you take two bits from the host address 
space, you can create three to four subnets of 16,384 host addresses per subnet. 
Remember, we can't use host addresses with all Os or all ls, so the number of available 
host addresses is reduced by two each time. 
i 
The rule that network IDs could not consist of all 0s or all ls came about 
because at one point in time, router software wasn't capable of handling such 
network IDs. The routers being made today are perfectly capable of handling 
network IDs of all 0s or all ls, so this rule--while still imposed by Microsoft on 
their networks--no longer is a technical limitation, but merely one of conven- 
tion. However, although network IDs of all 0s and all ls are permissible now, 
you still cannot use host IDs that consist of all 0s or all ls. 
For this section, we're going to use the following data. We're going to use a Class B 
network with the IP address of 145.64.0.0. We'll assume we need up to eight subnets to 
handle our future expansion. We'll also assume that having up to 8,190 host addresses 
per subnet will be acceptable for our configuration. We've determined our maximum 
number of subnets and the resulting number of host addresses per subnet. 
Now that we've decided we need a maximum of eight subnets, we must next deter- 
mine how many host bits we'll need to use to accomplish this. Thus, we use bits from 
the third octet (y) and determine how many we'll need to create eight (remember, 
counting starts with 0). We can see that we need three bits from the third octet to give 
us up to eight subnets. We know that 00000111 = 7. Since we're including 0, using 
three bits would allow a total of eight subnets. It's important not to get confused 
between bit values and number of bits. At this point, we simply need to figure out how 
many bits are needed, so we start on the right. If we needed 64 networks, we'd need six 
bits (00111111 = 63) and so on.Table 6.13 shows the bit configuration for up to eight 
subnets using our sample network 145.64.0.0.

Notice that we used three bits~the three bits contiguous to our original network 
ID. Essentially these bits extend the network address space by three bits. An important 
thing to remember is that these bits retain their original bit value and that they stay in 
their original octet~we don't move the decimal place. For example, the left-most bit of 
the third octet, while incorporated into the network ID, still retains its value of 128. 
When we add together the values of the four left-most bits from the third octet, it 
results in 224 (128 + 64 + 32), yielding our highest network ID. 
Determine the New Subnetted Network IDs 
Once we've taken the number of host address bits we need to create our requisite 
number of subnets, we must determine the resulting addresses of our new subnets. There 
are two steps in this process. 
1. 
List all the possible binary combinations of the bits taken from the host address 
. 
space. 
Calculate the incremental value to each subnet and add to the network 
address. 
The possible combinations of the four bits taken from the host address space are 
shown in Table 6.14. The number of combinations can be denoted as 2", where n is the 
number of bits. In this case, we could represent all possible combinations as 2 3 or 8.

Next, we need to calculate the incremental values. Again, we begin with the bit that 
is contiguous with the original network ID. Table 6.15 shows the results.

10010001.01000000.11100000.00000000 
Determine the IP Addresses for Each New Subnet 
Earlier we learned that we could denote the number of network ID bits by using the 
convention w.x.y.z/## where ## is the total number of network ID bits. In this case, 
we have a Class B network, so we know we're starting with 16 bits for the network. 
We've taken three bits from the host address space, so our total network bits are now 19. 
Thus, we can denote our new subnetted network in this way: 146.64.0.0/19. Each of 
the subsequent subnet IDs can be denoted in a similar fashion as shown in Table 6.16.

Creating the Subnet Mask 
We've determined our subnets, and now we need to create a subnet mask that will work 
with each subnet ID we created. Recall that we use bitwise ANDing to compare the 
bits of the IP address and the subnet mask. The result of the comparison is the network 
ID. Using Table 6.16, we know that we need to set to 1 any bits used for the network 
ID portion of the IP address. In this case, the subnet mask would be set to: 
11111111.11111111.11100000.00000000 
Notice that we have set the left-most 19 bits to 1. Thus, our subnet masks can be 
written in dotted decimal notation as 255.255.224.0. Let's compare this subnet mask to 
a sample IP address from within our subnetted addresses to see how this works.

DEFINING SUBNET MASKS 
In this exercise, we'll practice defining subnets and subnet masks. Use the fol- 
lowing scenario: Your brand new start-up company has been assigned a Class C 
address. 

Network Protocols • Chapter 6 
357 
You have only six computers, one router, and three printers attached to your 
network. You'd like to subnet your network before your company's planned 
expansion and you'll need a maximum of six to seven networks in the future. 
1. 
How many host address bits will you need to take from the host address 
space to create seven subnets? To solve this problem, we need to think in 
terms of the bit value of the binary bits in an octet. Which bit values, 
when added together, equal 7? The answer is the right-most three bits, or 
00000111. This tells us we need three bits from the host address space to 
add to the network address space. However, it's important to remember 
that we don't use the right-most bits. This may be confusing, but we 
used the bit values simply to determine how many bits we'll need. We 
use the bits closest to the octet used for the network ID. 
2. What is the binary representation of the subnet mask used for this con- 
figuration? Class C uses the w.x.y octets for network ID. Therefore, we 
know that the default subnet mask is 255.255.255.0. We've determined 
that we need to take three bits from the host ID space. We take the 
three left-most bits from the fourth octet so they remain contiguous 
with the network address space. The result is a subnet mask with the ls 
in 27 of the 32 bits, moving left to right, as shown. 
11111111.11111111.11111111.11100000 
3. What is the dotted decimal value of the binary configuration shown in 
Problem 2? 255.255.255.224 
4. What is one way of representing this network configuration, given that 
we are using three bits from the host address space for network IDs? As 
you may recall, a common notation for showing how many bits repre- 
sent the network ID (and therefore the subnet mask) is w.x.y.z/27 
where w.x.y.z are the dotted decimal values of the four octets that com- 
prise an IP address and the/27 denotes the number of bits used for the 
network address. 
5. 
If we use three bits from the host space for network IDs, what is the 
maximum number of hosts we can have per subnet? We know that an 
IP address has 32 bits and that we're using 27 of those bits for network 
addresses. 32 - 27 leaves 5 bits for host addresses. If we use the for- 
mula 2 n, we have 2 s, or 32 addresses. However, this includes an address 
of all 0s and all ls, both of which cannot be used, resulting in 30 pos- 
sible host addresses per subnet. 
This exercise should help you find out if you have any areas of confusion. If 
so, go back and work on the specific area that is giving you trouble. The 
Network+ exam is not likely to have questions that rely upon this knowledge to 
make you figure out a subnet, create one, or otherwise. You need to understand 
the concept behind subnetting, and the subnet mask, and understand the differ- 
ences between the host ID and the network ID as well as their relationship. 
Understanding the process of subnetting can help to drive that home for you.

These subnet mask tables make it easier to determine which subnet mask to use for 
any given situation. As the table shows, the number of subnets increases and the number 
of hosts in each subnet decreases. As the number of subnet bits increases, the number of 
host bits decreases. Since there are a fixed number of bits to work with in each class of 
network address, each bit can be used in only one way as specified by the mask. Each bit 
must be either a subnet bit or a host bit. An increase in the number of subnet bits causes 
a reduction in the number of host bits, and vice versa. 
Use these tables to help you memorize placement. 
Strategies to Conserve Addresses 
Several strategies have been developed and implemented to help the Internet commu- 
nity cope with the exhaustion of IP addresses. These strategies help reduce the load on 
Internet routers and also help administrators use globally unique IP addresses more effi- 
ciently. The following three strategies were mentioned in previous sections, and are dis- 
cussed in more detail in the following paragraphs: 
• 
Classless InterDomain Routing (CIDR) 
• 
Variable-Length Subnet Mask 
• 
Private Addressing 
Classless InterDomain Routing 
CIDR (RFCs 1517, 1518, and 1519) reduces route table sizes as well as IP address waste. 
Instead of full Class A, B, or C addresses, organizations can be allocated subnet blocks. For 
example, if a network needed 3,000 addresses, a single Class C network (256 addresses) 
would be insufficient. However, if a Class B network was assigned (65,536 addresses), 
62,000 addresses would be wasted. With CIDR, a block of 4,096 addresses can be allo- 
cated~the equivalence of 16 Class C networks. This block of addresses covers the imme- 
diate addressing needs, allows room for growth, and uses global addresses efficiently. 

Network Protocols • Chapter 6 
361 
Variable-Length Subnet Masks 
VLSMs conserve IP addresses by tailoring the mask to each subnet. Subnet masks are 
appropriated to meet the amount of addresses required. The idea is to assign just the 
right amount of addresses to each subnet. Many organizations have point-to-point WAN 
links. Normally, these links comprise a subnet with only the 2 addresses required. By 
using a routing protocol that supports VLSM, administrator's can use a block of addresses 
much more efficiently. An example of a VLSM used on a WAN link can be seen in 
Figure 6.7.

WARNING 
!~,~!Ii!' Using VLSMs on WAN links on your network is very common. You don't need to 
know how to do this for the Network+ exam, but you should understand it so 
when you see it in use, you understand that this is a common use of VLSMs. 
%i,~ You will learn more about WAN technologies in the next chapter. 
Private Addresses 
~ 
The most effective strategy for conserving globally unique (public) IP addresses is not 
using any. If an enterprise network is using TCP/IP protocols, but is not communicating 
with hosts in the global Internet, public IP addresses are not needed. If the internetwork 
www.syngress.com 

362 
Chapter 6 • Network Protocols 
is limited to one organization, the IP addresses need only be unique within that organi- 
zation. Only networks that interface with public networks such as the Internet need 
public addresses. Using public addresses on the outside and private addresses for inside 
networks is very effective. Network address translation is used to convert those private 
(inside) addresses to public (outside) addresses. 
Public versus Private Address Spaces 
The IP requires that each interface on a network have a unique address. If the scope of a 
network is global, the addresses must be globally unique. Since global uniqueness must 
be assured, a centralized authority must be responsible for making sure IP address assign- 
ments are made correctly and fairly. 
To meet the demands of a growing Internet community, the Internet Assigned 
Numbers Authority (IANA) was replaced by the Internet Corporation for Assigned 
Names and Numbers (ICANN). If an organization wants to use IP protocols and appli- 
cations in its network, but is not connecting its network to the global Internet, the IP 
addresses it uses do not have to be globally unique. A network of this type is called a pri- 
vate network, and the addresses used are called private addresses. 
RFC 1918 
Private Network Addresses 
~ R F C  
1918 
globally unique IP addresses by providing three blocks of addresses 
conserves 
that are never officially allocated to any organization. These blocks can then be used in 
private networks without fear of duplicating any officially assigned IP addresses in other 
organizations. With the explosive growth of the Internet, the InterNIC realized that 
some devices may never connect directly to the Internet. A good example of this is that 
many computers in a company connect to the Internet via an intermediate device such 
as a firewall, proxy server, or router. Consequently, those devices behind the firewall or 
other intermediate device don't need globally unique IP addresses. Three address blocks 
are defined as private address blocks, for situations in which the host does not connect 
directly to the Internet. 
• 
10.0.0.0/8 
This is a private Class A network address with the host ID range 
of 10.0.0.1 through 10.255.255.254.This private network has 24 bits that can 
be used for any subnetting configuration desired by the company. 
• 
172.16.0.0/12 
This scheme uses Class B addresses and allows for up to 16 
Class B networks, or 20 bits can be used for host IDs. The range of valid 
addresses on this private network is from 172.16.0.1 through 172.31.255.254. 
• 
192.168.0.0/16 
This configuration can provide up to 256 Class C networks, 
or 16 bits can be used for host addresses. The value range of IP addresses in 
this private network is 192.168.0.1 through 192.168.255.254. 

Network Protocols • Chapter 6 
363 
These private addresses are not assigned publicly and therefore will never exist in 
Internet routing tables. This makes these private addresses unreachable via the Internet. If 
a host using a private network IP address requires access to the Internet, it must use the 
services of an Application Layer gateway such as a proxy server, or it must have its 
address translated into a legal, public address. A process called network address translation 
performs this translation before sending data out to the Internet from a private address 
host ID. NAT will be covered in more depth later in this chapter. 
Another use of private addressing is called automatic private IP addressing (APIPA). 
If a computer (Windows 98 or later) is configured to obtain its address automatically 
from a DHCP server and it cannot locate a DHCP server, it will configure itself using 
APIPA. The computer randomly selects an address from the 169.254.0.0/16 address 
range and then checks the network for uniqueness. If the address is unique, it will use 
that address until it can reach a DHCP server. If the address is not unique, it will ran- 
domly select another address from that range.

DAY TIP 
t~: Consider the following type of question on your Network+ exam. You may see 
!~' a situation where you cannot get on the network because every node on the 
'g!i~e~i subnet is in the 10.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.0 range, and one node is having a 
.... ~:::~'~ problem because it has an APIPA address, so it won't be on the same subnet. 
Either that or the DHCP server is down and because of this the nodes on the 
network revert their addressing to the APIPA range. Think about this chapter 
and what you have learned so far and how it all ties together. All nodes on a 
subnet have to be in the same IP address range to communicate. There will be 
problems that arise where APIPA comes into play and you will need to know 
how to handle that situation. Make sure you consider this for the Network+ 
exam. 
Table 6.20 summarizes the private address blocks defined by 1KFC 1918. Notice the 
CID1K shorthand for the mask. As a reminder,/8 would be equal to 255.0.0.0.

Considerations 
The address blocks in Table 6.20 can be used in any network at any time. However, 
devices using these addresses will not be able to communicate with other hosts on the 
Internet without some kind of address translation. Some benefits of using private 
addresses are: 
• 
Number of Addresses There are plenty of addresses for most internal net- 
working needs. 
• 
Security Private addresses are not routable on the Internet. The translation 
from private to public addresses further obscures internal network information. 
• 
Renumbering 
If using NAT, no readdressing of privately addressed networks 
is necessary in order to access public networks. 
• 
Networks Treating private addresses as public addresses when allocating 
ensures that efficiency and design are maximized. 

Network Protocols • Chapter 6 
365 
Static and Dynamic Assignments 
On the Network+ exam, you will be responsible for not only knowing APIPA, but 
knowing the whole concept behind dynamic and static assignments.As mentioned ear- 
lier, DHCP is responsible for handing out a subset of IP addresses that an administrator 
configures into what is called a scope. The scope contains the leaseable address space that 
has been preconfigured. If your network uses TCP/IP as its network protocol, the nodes 
will, of course, need an IP address to communicate once they are up and running on the 
network. To configure each node statically (to go to the node itself, its physical location, 
or connect via remote administration) and configure an actual usable IP address on that 
node can become very unwieldy and it is highly discouraged if your network is large 
enough to warrant the use of DHCP. 
In a more technical definition, DHCP is a communications protocol that allows you 
to manage IP addressing usage centrally and to automate the assignment of logical 
addresses in an organization's network. Remember, each host on the network needs a 
unique IP address to be able to communicate. When an organization sets up its com- 
puter users with a connection to the Internet, an IP address must be assigned to each 
www.syngress.com 

366 
Chapter 6 • Network Protocols 
machine. Without DHCP, the IP address must be entered manually at each computer 
and, if computers move to another location in another part of the network, a new IP 
address must be entered, DHCP lets a network administrator supervise and distribute IP 
addresses from a central point and automatically sends a new IP address when a com- 
puter is plugged into a different place in the network. 
DHCP uses the concept of a lease, or amount of time, that a given IP address will be 
valid for a computer. The lease time can vary depending on how long a user is likely to 
require the Internet connection at a particular location. It's especially useful in education 
and other environments where users change frequently. Using very short leases, DHCP 
can dynamically reconfigure networks in which there are more computers than there are 
available IP addresses. 
DHCP supports static addresses for computers containing Web servers that need a 
permanent IP address; you can make reservations for such addresses. 
DHCP is an extension of an earlier network IP management protocol, Bootstrap 
Protocol (BOOTP). DHCP is a more advanced protocol, but both configuration man- 
agement protocols are commonly used and DHCP can handle BOOTP client requests. 
Some organizations use both protocols, but understanding how and when to use them 
in the same organization is important. Some operating systems, including Windows 
NT/2000, come with DHCP servers. A DHCP or BOOTP client is a program that is 
located in (and perhaps downloaded to) each computer so that it can be configured. 
.... ::~iiiiiiiiiiljiiiiil 
Niiiii DHCP and its operation are thoroughly covered within the DHCP RFC. 
i~iiiii~iiiii www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2131.txt 
DHCP Operations 
DHCP was covered briefly earlier in the chapter. DHCP is responsible for automatic 
and dynamic addressing of your network. It has a lot of complexity to it as well. For 
example, to get DHCP broadcasts to get to remote sites that are connected only by 
routers and T1 links, you would need to configure those routers to pass the DHCP 
broadcast from the client to the server; if the router is not configured to do so, then it 
will not pass. This is a common problem seen on the Network+ exam. Consider the fol- 
lowing:You need to allow your clients to communicate with the DHCP server to get an 
address so they can participate on the network, accessing services and so on.You have 
three clients on one remote subnet that cannot get a valid IP address, but all other 
clients can. This is a common issue. Since all other sites work just fine (eliminating the 
possibility that it could be a server issues affecting all sites) the problem may be that the 
remote site's router is not configured to pass the broadcast from the client to the server, 

Network Protocols • Chapter 6 
367 
which will then give that client a lease on an IP address so it can participate on the net- 
work. In this section we cover the basics of DHCP operations. 
As just mentioned, when a DHCP-based client is booted up, unless already config- 
ured with an IP, the client attempts to communicate with a DHCP server to get its 
TCP/IP configuration information. The following is a list of DHCP message types 
exchanged between client and server.You will not need to memorize these for the 
Network+ exam, although understanding these messages simplifies the understanding of 
DHCP itself and better prepares you for the exam. 
• 
Dhcpdiscover The first time a DHCP client computer attempts to start on 
the network, it requests IP address information from a DHCP server by broad- 
casting a Dhcpdiscover packet. The source IP address in the packet is 0.0.0.0 
because the client does not yet have an IP address. The attempt is sent out 
from the client on the network and as long as the packet can get to the server, 
the request process can be officially completed by the server. 
• 
Dhcpoffer When the DHCP server receives the request, it selects an 
unleased IP address from the range of available IP addresses and offers it to the 
DHCP client. The lease is generally configured as part of a scope, mentioned 
earlier. The lease is good generally for a week by default, although this can be 
changed. In most cases, the DHCP server also returns additional TCP/IP con- 
figuration information, such as the subnet mask and default gateway in a 
Dhcpoffer packet. More than one DHCP server can respond with a Dhcpoffer 
packet, and the client accepts the first Dhcpoffer it receives. 
• 
Dhcprequest When the client receives the Dhcpoffer packet, it responds by 
broadcasting a Dhcprequest packet that contains the offered IP address. 
• 
Dhcpdecline A message from the DHCP client to the server indicating that 
the offered configuration parameters are invalid. 
• 
Dhcpack The DHCP server acknowledges the client's Dhcprequest for the 
IP address by sending a Dhcpack packet. 
• 
Dhcpnack If the IP address cannot be used by the client because it is no 
longer valid or is now used by another computer, the DHCP server will 
respond with a Dhcpnack packet. 
• 
Dhcprelease A message from the DHCP client to the server that releases the 
IP address and cancels any remaining lease. 
DHCP Relay Agents 
When the DHCP server receives the request from the DHCP client computer, it 
dynamically assigns an IP address to the requesting computer from the range of valid IP 
addresses contained within the DHCP scope.The DHCP server allocates the IP address 
www.syngress.com 

368 
Chapter 6 • Network Protocols 
with a lease that defines how long the IP address can be used by the client computer. 
The DHCP server can also establish other configuration parameters, such as subnet mask 
and DNS (Domain Name System) and WINS (Windows Internet Name Service) server 
identification for the client computer. DNS and WINS are both covered within this 
chapter. It's important to remember that when configuring DHCP for clients, it's not 
just an IP address that is delivered to the client, but many other parameters such as DNS 
server address, WINS server address, subnet mask, default gateway and routing metrics, 
all of which are covered within this chapter. 
In order to get this information to the client so that it can be used, the client must 
be able to contact the DHCP server.As mentioned before, if it cannot, then you may 
have a router issue that prevents the broadcast request from getting through. 
Understanding and configuring DHCP relay agents on a router is a very important part 
of DHCP to consider as a network engineer.TCP/IP networks are interconnected by 
routers that connect network segments (subnets) and pass IP packets between the sub- 
nets. Because routers do not pass broadcasts by default, a configuration change must be 
added to the router.As mentioned earlier, one of the major components of the DHCP 
specification is the DHCP protocol for communications between DHCP servers and 
clients. If this communication is disrupted or not allowed, DHCP will not function on 
your network. 
On the Network+ exam, you may come across a question of two that tests your 
knowledge ofRFC 1542 and broadcast-based communications when working with an 
RFC 1542-compliant router.A DHCP server can only provide IP addresses to clients in 
multiple subnets if the router that connects the subnets is an RFC 1542-compliant 
router. The configuration is commonly called an IP helper address in Cisco Systems-based 
routers. If the router cannot function as a relay agent, each subnet that has DHCP clients 
requires a DHCP server. 
A relay agent is a program used to pass specific types of IP packets between subnets. 
A DHCP/BOOTP relay agent is simply a hardware or software program that can pass 
DHCP/BOOTP messages (packets) from one subnet to another subnet according to the 
RFC 1542 specification. 
ii OTE 
BOOTP is described in RFC 951 and RFC 1084, and is used for booting diskless 
nodes. Updated in RFC 1395 and RFC 1497 and superseded by DHCP, BOOTP is 
~i 
still supported for legacy applications on most, if not all DHCP server implemen- 
~ii tations. The way it works is that when the client is ready to boot up on the net- 
work, it sends out a broadcast message requesting information and waits for a 
reply. The client only has to know its own hardware (MAC) address. With this 
information, the BOOTP server will respond with an IP address.

Network Protocols • Chapter 6 
369 
Now that you understand the basics of network protocols such as 
IPX/SPX,AppleTalk, and TCP/IE let's continue learning about the TCP/IP suite's other 
functionalities, services, applications, and protocols. In the next section we will briefly 
cover the use of multicasting and the TCP/IP protocols used to provide it. 
Multicast, Broadcast, and Unicast 
With the continuously expanding use of networks, more and more people are deciding 
that one-to-one networking is not enough anymore. The need to have one-to-many 
networks has become more important. This is true for large corporations who benefit 
from e-mail, file sharing, and mirrored servers in two different cities (or countries). New 
technologies are developed every day. 
Multicasting can reduce travel expenses while maximizing benefits. Imagine the cost 
of sending several employees halfway around the world for a conference that lasts less 
than a day. Not only would you incur the cost of travel, but also the cost of the 
employees' time as they travel. 
A better solution in this case would be to videoconference (which is a very popular 
and always-developing technology), which allows viewing a presentation in one window 
while watching the speaker in another. Questions can be typed while the presentation is 
in progress, and prioritized for answering at the end of the conference. These are just a 
few of the features that can be provided by multicasting. Other benefits can include 
interactive distance learning and corporate announcement transmissions. 
Multicasting benefits are not limited to video/audio needs. Multicast can be used to 
push updates to multiple hosts simultaneously, thus reducing the effort and time involved 
in doing one update at a time. Multicasting can also push computer operating system 
images to their hosts. 
The possibilities seem endless and are rapidly growing. The following sections cover 
the basics of multicasting and how the multicasting addressing scheme is laid out. 
Understanding the Basics of Multicasting 
For the Network+ exam, you will not need to understand the dozens of commands that 
you can program into a router to enable and control multicasting, nor will you need to 
know the exact detailed operation of how multicasting protocols such as IGMP 
(Internet Group Management Protocol) work. However, you do need to know about 
multicasting fundamentals for the exam.You have already learned about Class D 
addressing space, which is where multicasting was originally mentioned. Why is there so 
much concern about it? Well, for one, since the use of it is growing, it must mean that 
the pressure placed on networks today is warranting its use. Bandwidth utilization is the 
first thing most network technicians and administrators think about when discussing 
streaming video and other live information feeds to an individual's PC or across a WAN 
link that may not have the bandwidth to accommodate it. To simply increase your band- 

370 
Chapter 6 • Network Protocols 
width because of a single application's requirements could be expensive when dealing 
with telecommunications providers. 
To understand multicast traffic completely, we have to discuss the other types of 
traffic. It is important to understand the differences between unicast, broadcast, and mul- 
ticast traffic. Multicasting is UDP-based. While UDP is not a great example of reliability, 
it makes more sense for multicasting than TCE For starters, having a multitude of hosts 
acknowledge receipt of a multicast packet stream would be counterproductive. 
Additionally, UDP has lower overhead, which provides the speed necessary to support 
the traffic needs of multicasting. 
Multicast addresses cannot be used as source addresses for any traffic. While multicast 
addresses can be associated with particular interfaces on particular devices (such as 
224.0.0.5 for OSPF [Open Shortest Path First]enabled interfaces on a router), traffic 
cannot be sourced from a multicast address because it does not identify a specific host; 
rather, a multicast address identifies a group of hosts sharing the same address. 
Multicast addresses are not assigned to a device, rather, a device proceeds to listen for 
and receive traffic destined to a multicast group that it has joined by some process. For 
example, routers can join the OSPF multicast group on their network by having OSPF 
configured, and having interfaces configured to participate in OSPF routing. In this case, 
it means that the router will receive traffic destined to multicast IP addresses reserved for 
OSPF routing. Hosts can opt to join a multicast group by having certain applications 
(such as videoconferencing software) installed and configured. 
iiiiii!ii Remember, the Network+ exam does not dig as deeply into these concepts as 
i iiii this chapter does (such as our last discussion on OSPF). You need to remember 
iiiii i }ii 
facts, such as which protocols are used, which IP address class is used, which IP 
........ '~ range is within that class, as well as being able to single out any wrong answers 
that may be placed in the question as a distracter. Knowing this other informa- 
tion is only going to help you understand what you are memorizing. 
Understanding multicasting is very important as a network engineer, espe- 
cially if you are working with videoconferencing or any of the many other appli- 
cations that use multicasting as an underlying technology. 
As mentioned earlier, IGMP allows host computers on the Internet to participate in 
IP multicasting. A multicast address identifies a transmission session instead of a particular 
physical destination. This allows for sending a message to a large number of recipients 
without the necessity for the source computer to know the addresses of all the recipi- 
ents. The network touters translate the multicast address into host addresses. The protocol 
used to facilitate this is IGMP. IGMP was originally defined in RFC 1112. Extensions 
have been developed and are included in IGMP version 2, addressed in RFC 2236. 
www.syngress.com 

Network Protocols • Chapter 6 
371 
A computer uses IGMP to report its multicast group memberships to multicast 
routers. IGMPv2 allows group membership terminations to be reported promptly to the 
routing protocol. I GMP is required to be used in host computers that wish to participate 
in multicasting. IGMPv3 is also available for use. Knowing all the version types is not nec- 
essary for the Network+ exam, but it's important to know if you need to use IGMP, as 
some versions have (obviously) more functionality, enhancements, and security than others. 
Unicast Traffic 
What is most commonly seen (and wanted on your network) is what is called unicast 
traffic. Unicast is the transmission of data from one host to another, one host at a time. 
This is a one-to-one session between one host and another, such as a client and server 
arrangement. Unicast can be used to support multiple sessions (that is, multicasting) by 
establishing multiple one-to-one communications to transport the same data stream to 
multiple hosts. An example of this is shown in Figure 6.8. 
Figure 6.8 Unicast Network Video Feed Example 
m 
_
_
 
If the session is required by multiple hosts, a one-to-one connection is established, 
with the same data transmitted repeatedly to each host. This form of transmission will 
not transmit to every computer on a network; however, multiple requests for the same 
conference or data would cause that data to be pushed across the network media at the 
same time. Thus, as shown in Figure 6.8, a video feed of 1.5 Mbps unicasted to 10 com- 
puters on a network requires 15 Mbps of bandwidth. While this might not seem signifi- 
cant, it can degrade network performance as the feed size and quantity increase. 
www.syngress.com 

372 
Chapter 6 • Network Protocols 
The toll of network usage is realized on the network equipment traversed from 
source to destination for the video feed. All of the routers and switches will have a con- 
siderable amount of data traffic to process. 
Broadcast Traffic 
Broadcast is another option that can be used for transmitting data to a large number of 
host systems simultaneously. Broadcasts can consume a significant amount of bandwidth; 
connections are based on a one-to-all method transmission. This can be seen when using 
the NetBIOS and ARP protocols, as well as many others.Any hosts on a network where 
a broadcast is generated will process that broadcast (at least far enough to know it is not 
intended for that system).An example of a broadcast can be seen in Figure 6.9. 
Figure 6.9 Broadcast Network Video Feed Example 
t ..5 sent: out only onoe .... 
.... 
...~...~.,..., ... 
.-------!,5 
I 
. . 
:t,5 k 
As shown in Figure 6.9, the broadcast traffic is sent to all computer systems that can 
be reached on the network. This process launches the 1.5 Mbps video stream to all the 
interfaces possible, thus not creating the intense bandwidth consumption of a unicast. 
The problem is that each host receiving the broadcast has to process the 1.5 Mbps 
data stream continuously until it is finished. If the receiving host does not want the 
broadcast traffic, valuable resources of the host will still accept the datagram and then 
determine what to do with itmaccept it or reject it. Because this is also a video feed, 
this large piece of data has to be processed, which can take a considerable toll on the 
host system. 
Another disadvantage of using the broadcast transmission for video feeds is the net- 
work architecture. On a small network with no routers, this may be a desirable option. 

Network Protocols • Chapter 6 
373 
On larger networks, or if there are any routers in the path to a host, the default action is 
to filter (block) the broadcast, meaning that broadcasts must be explicitly allowed to tra- 
verse the path to the host. 
Multicast Traffic 
Obviously, neither unicast nor broadcast is optimized to handle traffic destined for mul- 
tiple hosts, especially if those hosts are logically assigned to a specific group. Multicasting 
and the protocols discussed address this need. Multicast traffic establishes a one-to-many 
type of transmission. This allows the data traffic to only be sent to those who specifically 
requested the information, and only sends one stream of traffic to each requesting 
broadcast domain. A multicast example is shown in Figure 6.10.

Multicast (RFC 1112) is a technology used to address multiple hosts as a group. A 
source host multicasts to a group of hosts by sending an IP packet to a special IP address 
associated with that group. The IP address that defines a multicast group is a Class D 
address (224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255), with unique groups allocated their own IP 
address in that range. This allows multiple multicast groups to be defined at the same 
time with different IP addresses. Multicasting sends the data stream only to the group of 
hosts that specifically want it. All other hosts ignore and do not process the multicast 
traffic. 

374 
Chapter 6 • Network Protocols 
Multicasting differs from broadcasting because multicasting sends traffic to a group 
of hosts, not to all hosts on a network. Hosts that are not part of the group will not pro- 
cess the multicast packet because it is not addressed to them. 
As mentioned earlier in the section, a typical multicast application is videoconfer- 
encing. Not all network users want or need to participate in a videoconference; only 
those users that need to will join the multicast group to receive the video feed. 
The advantage of multicasting becomes apparent when you consider that using uni- 
cast addresses would result in an individual video feedback to each receiver. More users 
and demand mean more bandwidth used. By using multicasting, only one channel is 
used, regardless of the number of users: 1,000 users only require one channel. Multicast 
traffic is bi-directional: a host can receive or send multicast packets. 
As mentioned briefly before, it's important to understand the need for the group. If 
only one data stream is being transmitted, how can all of the requesting systems receive 
the data? Multicasting uses IP addresses to establish multicast groups, which host systems 
can join to receive multicast data. The multicast data is sent to the group IP address and 
all listed group members receive the traffic. 
Multicast IP Address Designations 
Class D IP addresses comprise the whole range of multicast addresses, with a range of 
224.0.0.0 through 239.255.255.255. Multicast IP addresses are easily recognized by their 
binary numeration, as their high-end bits are always 1110. For instance 11100000 is 
equal to 224 and 11101111 is equal to 239.These first 4 bits account for a portion of 
the IP address; the remaining 28 bits are used for multicast group identification. Two 
types of multicast IP addresses are used: dynamic and static. 
Transient (dynamic) addresses are used for the duration of the session, and are relin- 
quished when no longer needed. Dynamic multicast IP addressing allows applications to 
acquire an IP address for the length of the multicast transmission. This IP address alloca- 
tion has a certain expiration time and must be considered by the application requesting 
the address in order to retain functionality. For example, a transient address is used to 
multicast a videoconference of an event. After the event is finished, the transient address 
can be reused. Transient addresses must be coordinated to ensure that two people or 
organizations do not use the same transient address for different needs. 
Static multicast IP addresses are a group of IP addresses, ranging from 224.0.0.0 to 
224.255.255.255, that have been specifically assigned by the IANA.The permanent 
addresses are defined in the protocol itself, such as the all-hosts (224.0.0.1), all-touters 
(224.0.0.2), or RIPv2 group (224.0.0.9) addresses. Permanent addresses can also be 
assigned by the IANA for other protocols or uses. These addresses are reserved for par- 
ticular purposes and are referred to as well-known addresses. Table 6.21 shows some of 
these assigned static IP addresses. For a complete listing of statically assigned Class D IP 
address, see www.iana.org/assignments/multicast-addresses.

figuration of some features such as OPSF on a router.

Understanding Basic IP Routing 
In this section, we're going to explore how data is routed on a network using the IP 
protocol. We'll begin by discussing how names and addresses are resolved. Then, we'll 
look at how packets of data are sent from one network to another to understand the 
process of basic IP routing. Understanding how routing works will help you to under-

Chapter 6 • Network Protocols 
stand the concepts behind routing protocols such as those found within the network 
protocol suites we already mentioned in this chapter (TCP/IP, IPX/SPX, and 
AppleTalk). In this section we will thoroughly cover how data is transmitted on a 
TCP/IP network.This knowledge is easily converted to other suites (such as IPX/SPX). 
Less commonly used protocols are not covered as thoroughly on the exam, hence we are 
focused on TCP/IP in this section (and chapter). However, you will need to know how 
to use protocols and services within the other suites to be able to function in a produc- 
tion environment that may not solely rely on TCP/IP for communication. Consider this 
as you wrap up your studies for this exam. Think about moving on to other protocols 
later and dig into them at a much more involved level. 
Name and Address Resolution 
Names are often used for computers and devices because it's much easier for humans to 
remember names than numbers.You're more likely to remember that your computer 
name is XP-1 than to remember that your IP address is 196.55.141.6.There are two 
types of names~NetBIOS names, which are used by NetBIOS applications and host- 
names, used by Windows sockets applications and TCP/IP applications. Since names are 
often used, there must be a method for translating or resolving names~both NetBIOS 
and hostnames~to unique IP addresses. 
Hostname Resolution 
A hostname is a name, or alias, assigned to a device (also called host or node) to identify it 
as a TCP/IP host device. This hostname can be up to 255 characters long, can contain 
both alphabetic and numeric characters, and can contain the hyphen (-) and .dot, or 
period (.) characters. A computer or device can actually have multiple hostnames 
assigned to it. In Windows version 2000 and later, the hostname and computer name do 
not have to be the same. 

Network Protocols • Chapter 6 
377 
Window sockets-based applications can use either the hostname or the IP address. 
Both Internet Explorer and FTP are examples of Windows sockets-based applications 
that use either the hostname or IP address. If a hostname is used for the destination, it 
must be resolved to the IP address associated with the hostname. 
Hostnames take a variety of forms, but the two most common are nicknames 
(aliases) and domain names.A nickname might be "Galileo" or "JohnS". Domain names 
are hostnames that follow the commonly-known Internet naming conventions. 
The InterNIC created a hierarchical namespace called Domain Name System (DNS), 
which allows organizations to create custom names based on an agreed-upon hierarchy. 
This system is similar to a directory structure on a disk drive. A unique name for the 
host within this type of hierarchy is referred to as a fully qualified domain name (FQDN). 
An example of an FQDN is serverOl.example.somecompany.com.The root is indicated with 
a null .... . The top-level domain is corn, familiar to most people in today's environment. 
Somecompany represents the second-level domain, example represents the third-level 
domain, and serverO1 is the host (computer name).The unique hostname is the entire 
string. It is possible, for example, to have a host named server01 on another domain, 
such as example2, in which case the FQDN would be serverOl.example2.somecompany.com. 
Each name is still unique because the entire string serves as the name. Domain names 
are not case-sensitive. FQDNs have to be resolved to IP addresses in order for data to be 
sent and received properly. Hostnames (whether alias or FQDN) can be resolved 
through the use of a static hosts file, through the use of a DNS server for lookup, or 
through a combination of the two.

Hosts File 
UNIX has long used the hosts file to store hostname-to-IP address mappings. This file 
can also be used on Windows-based computers. On UNIX systems, the hosts file typi- 
cally is located in/etc/hosts. On a Windows Server 2003 machine (or Windows 2000), 
it is located in the \%SystemRoot%\system32\drivers\etc directory. The file is a simple 
text file (but saved without the .txt extension) that lists the IP address and the hostname 
of each defined device. The top of the next page illustrates an example of a hosts file.

galileo 
Notice that the IP address is given first, then the hostname. On the last line of this 
sample hosts file, notice that there are two names: server3.example.somecompany.com and 
galileo. In a hosts file, you can map both a FQDN and an alias (nickname) to the same 
associated IP address. Thus, there are three ways someone could reach that device: using 
galileo, server3.example.somecompany.com, or 191.87.221.3. Hosts files in Windows NT, 
2000, and 2003 are not case-sensitive and are named hosts. In other operating systems, 
such as in UNIX, the hosts file is case-sensitive. 
There are two big problems with using a hosts file. First, it is a static file. If any 
names or addresses change, they must be changed manually in the hosts file. If you have 
a hosts file on 1,500 computers that defines the location and name of a router and 
information changes, you may have a big job ahead of you when you need to change 
that hosts file on all 1,500 computers and other devices that use that router. Also, if" the 
number of defined hosts in a hosts file gets long, it can take a long time to parse the file. 
This results is a delay as your computer reads through a long file in an attempt to locate 
a hostname and associated IP address. 
DNS Name Resolution 
An alternative to the hosts file is to use a DNS server. DNS servers store FQDN-to-IP 
address translations. A computer runs the DNS client called the DNS resolver, which is 
configured with the IP address of the DNS server. When an IP address is needed, the 
DNS resolver requests the information from the DNS server by first translating the 
FQDN provided into a DNS name query. When the IP address is returned from the 
DNS server, the DNS resolver provides that information to the requesting application. 
DNS is a distributed system, so not all mappings reside on all DNS servers. Each DNS 
server is responsible for a particular segment of the names and it either returns the 
requested information or forwards it to the appropriate DNS server. We'll learn more 
about DNS later in this book. In the Windows implementation of TCP/IE both a hosts 
file and DNS are used to resolve hostnames. The hosts file is checked first and if the 
desired mapping is not present, DNS will be queried. 

Network Protocols • Chapter 6 
379 
NetBIOS Name Resolution 
NetBIOS, as we learned earlier, stands for Network Basic Input Output System, and is 
an API that augments the DOS BIOS by adding special functions for LANs.Almost all 
Windows-based LANs for PCs are based on the NetBIOS name resolution method. 
Some LAN manufacturers have even extended it, adding additional network capabilities. 
Windows-based computers, although striving to use DNS only, still rely heavily on 
NetBIOS. Much of this reliance on NetBIOS is from all the older implementation of it 
already in existence today. There are essentially four ways a NetBIOS name can be 
resolved: 
m 
The client's NetBIOS name cache is checked to see if the NetBIOS name-to- 
IP address has already been resolved and is sitting in memory. 
• 
A WINS server can be queried to see if the information is in a WINS 
database. 
m 
The client can use a file called lmhosts (which works like the hosts file for 
hostnames). 
m 
The NetBIOS name is converted to a hostname, and hostname resolution 
methods are employed 
The method by which NetBIOS names are resolved depends on the node's configu- 
ration. There are four types of configurations, described in Table 6.22, that are referred to 
as NetBIOS node types. 
Table 6.22 NetBlOS Node Types 
Node Type 
B-node (Broadcast) 
Benefit: Broadcast sends message to 
network for response. 
Potential Problem: Increased 
network traffic. 
P-node (Peer-to-peer) 
Benefit: Message is sent only to 
WINS server, reducing network 
traffic. 
Potential Problem" Names may be 
resolved over WAN, which is both 
slower and less efficient. 
Description of Node 
B-node clients broadcast a message to the 
local network. If the queried name exists on 
the local network, a positive name query 
response is generated, which contains the IP 
address of the associated NetBIOS name. 
Once resolved, this information resides in the 
NetBIOS cache until it times out. 
P-node clients send a unicast (a directed 
message) to the defined WINS server. If the 
WINS server database contains the needed 
information, it responds with a positive name 
query response along with the requested IP 
address. If the WINS server does not respond, 
the client will try additional WINS servers.

Table 6.22 continued 
NetBlOS Node Types 
Node Type 
Description of Node 
M-node (Mixed) 
Benefit: Useful when the client is 
on the other side of a WAN link 
from the desired resource. 
Potential Problem: Broadcasts may 
cause increased traffic on the 
local network. 
H-node (Hybrid) 
Benefit: Works well if names are 
located on a WINS server and are 
resolved via WINS. 
Potential Problem" Can still 
generate excess local network 
traffic through the use of broadcasts. 
M-node clients use B-node to resolve the 
name-to-address first. If this is unsuccessful, 
it will then use P-node for resolution. 
H-node clients use a process just the opposite 
of M-node clients. Resolution is first 
attempted using P-node and if unsuccessful, 
B-node is used. 
You may be thinking that a single broadcast to resolve a name on a network may 
not be significant in increasing network traffic. However, depending on the number of 
hosts on a subnet, the attempts at name resolution could cause substantial network 
traffic. It's also important to remember that these broadcasts use UDP datagrams. If you 
recall our earlier discussions, UDP datagrams are connectionless and are therefore not 
reliable. If a client does not receive a positive response from a name query, the client 
doesn't really know whether the request ever reached its destination. In order to make 
sure the request is received, these UDP datagram broadcasts are sent out three times 
with a 750-millisecond delay in between.Thus, each attempt at name resolution gener- 
ates three packets, not just one. The number of attempts and the delay can be changed in 
the registry, though these default settings are typically adequate. 
In Windows Server 2003 (and going as far back as Windows 98), a client can be 
configured with up to twelve WINS servers, significantly increasing the chances of 
receiving a positive name query response from a configured WINS server. However, if 
the name is still not resolved using these methods, the client will continue to try to 
resolve the name. 
How Packets Travel from Network to Network 
Now that we understand how names are translated into IP addresses, let's look at how a 
data packet from one host travels to another across the span of networks. After a sending 
host receives the needed IP address, the packet is sent from the host through the 
TCP/IP suite to the physical medium for delivery at the target IP address. Routing is the 
process of sending the packet to its destination. A router is a device that forwards packets 
from one network to another and is also referred to as a gateway (the term gateway is 
used in several different contexts; in all cases, a gateway connects one thing with 
another). Gateways are covered in more detail in Chapter 3, "Network Devices". 
www.syngress.com 

Network Protocols • Chapter 6 
381 
When the sending host has a packet ready, it already has determined the destination's 
IP address by using one of the many name-to-IP resolution methods discussed. 
However, it may not know where that IP address is located if it is not located on the 
same subnet as the sending host. 
When TCP/IP on a host is initialized, it automatically creates a routing table, which 
consists of default entries, manual entries, and entries made automatically through com- 
munication with network routers. In order to route the packet properly, the IP layer of a 
host will consult with the routing table that is stored in memory. Depending on whether 
the destination is on the same network or across the network boundaries (which is 
determined by examining the network ID of the destination address), the packet will be 
sent by direct delivery or indirect delivery. 
Direct delivery is when the router is not used to forward the packet because the 
destination is on the same network (subnet or network segment) as the sending host. In 
this case, the packet is sent directly to its destination. When the packet leaves the sending 
host, the data is encapsulated in a frame format for the Network Interface Layer with 
the destination's physical address included (as you'll recall, the physical or MAC address 
that matches the IP address in the destination header is determined by A1KP). 
If the packet is destined for another network, it is sent to an intermediate point for 
forwarding. This is called indirect delivery. The IP data is encapsulated in a frame format 
that is actually addressed to thephysical address of the network interface of the IP router 
that is on the sending computer's subnet. Thus, the packet is sent from the sending host 
directly to the router. The router takes a look at the packet and determines where it 
should be sent in order to reach its final destination. The router passes the packet from 
its internal interface (the one with an address on the same subnet as the sender) to its 
external inte~ace (the interface that's on a different subnet). From there, the packet may 
make its way across many touters before reaching the subnet or network on which the 
destination computer resides. 
IP Routing Tables 
Any IP node that initializes the TCP/IP stack will generate a default routing table based 
on the configuration of that node. For instance, when your network-connected desktop 
boots up and initializes the TCP/IP stack, it will create a default routing table based on 
your computer's unique IP address, which includes the network ID as well as the default 
gateway (default router) and subnet mask. The table also contains the logical or physical 
interface, typically the network interface card, to be used to forward the packet. 
IP Routing Table Entries 
Routing table entries can be default, manual, or dynamic. 
The default values are created when the TCP/IP stack is initialized, as shown 
in Figure 6.11.

Chapter 6 * Network Protocols 
[] 
Manual entries can be placed in the table for specific routes that may be 
desired. Some organizations, for instance, want specific traffic to go through 
specific routers. In that case, those routes can be entered into the routing table 
manually. 
[] 
Routes can be added dynamically if the router supports dynamic routing 
tables.

We'll discuss the differences between manual and dynamic routing in a moment. For 
now, let's look at the specific entries in a routing table. Routing table entries contain a 
number of elements in a specified order. Each of those elements is required and each is 
described briefly here. Figure 6.11 shows a typical routing table. 
• 
Network Destination The network ID can be class-based, subnetted, or 
supernetted. 
• 
Netmask The mask used to match the destination network with the IP 
address in the data. 
• 
Next Hop or Gateway The IP address of the next router (a hop is one seg- 
ment between routers. If a packet has to go through two routers, that would be 
two hops). 
• 
Interface Identifies which network interface is used to forward the packet. 
Remember that every router has at least two interfaces. 

Network Protocols • Chapter 6 
383 
• 
Metric The metric is a number used to help determine the best route for the 
packet. This typically is used to identify the route with the fewest hops. The 
metric is often expressed as the cost of the route. 
Routing tables can also store four specific types of routes: 
• 
Directly Attached Network IDs For packets destined for the local or 
attached network. If the sending and receiving hosts are both on the same 
subnet, for instance, the packet will be sent via this method. 
• 
Remote Network IDs Any packets destined for networks reachable via 
touters will be sent via this routing method. 
• 
Host Routes A host route is a route to a specific IP address.This type of 
route allows a packet to be sent to a specific IP address. The network ID is the 
IP address of the destination host and the network mask is 255.255.255.255. 
• 
Default Route The default route is used when a more specific network ID 
or route cannot be found. When all else fails, the default route is used. This is 
defined as a network ID of 0.0.0.0 and the network mask is 0.0.0.0. 
j~~ TE 
In this section we used a server (multi-homed with two NlCs) as a router. When 
using RRAS (Routing and Remote Access Service), you can use Windows Server 
2003 (or 2000) as a router. Since most people have more access to a copy of 
the server than to a Cisco router, this made the most sense. However, it will be 
most commonly seen on a vendor router such as Cisco or Juniper. For the exam 
you will not be asked to analyze different vendor-based RITs, so this example is 
all that you need in order to learn the concepts about routing to be able to 
pass the exam. Make sure that when you get an opportunity, try to work with 
commonly used equipment whenever possible, especially Cisco's offerings. 
Route Determination Process 
Each IP packet has a destination IP address, which is used to determine how the packet 
will be routed. Using the logical ANDing process, the destination IP address and the 
subnet mask (or netmask) are compared. If they match, the packet stays on the local net- 
work and is sent directly to the destination IP address. 
If the destination IP address and the subnet mask do not match, the entries in the 
routing table are compared to the destination IP address. If a match is found (that is, if 
the destination IP address and the subnet mask AND to a value found in the routing 
table), the packet is sent to the gateway listed in the routing table. If no matching entries 
V-

Chapter 6 • Network Protocols 
can be found, the packet is sent to the defined default gateway. If more than one match 
is found in the routing table entries, the metric is used and the route with the fewest 
hops is typically selected. Table 6.23 on the following page shows a sample routing table 
list. To view the route table on a Windows Server 2003 computer, access the command 
prompt and type route print. 
If there is no matching entry in the routing table, the packet will be sent to the 
default gateway for forwarding. When this process is complete, the resulting IP address 
(either destination IP address or gateway IP address) is then resolved to a physical 
address. This process uses ARE 
Physical Address Resolution (Using ARP) 
ARP resolves IP addresses to physical addresses.ARP is used to resolve the next-hop IP 
address to a physical MAC address. This is done using network broadcasts. The resolved 
MAC address is placed in the header of the packet as the destination MAC address. 
ARP Cache 
Just as a routing table is stored on the local host, so too is a list of the resolved IP-to- 
MAC addresses. This information is held in the ARP cache. Each time a request and res- 
olution occur, both the sender and receiver store the other's IP-to-MAC address 
mapping. When a packet is received, the ARP cache is checked to see if the resolution 
has already been added to the cache. If so, the packet is immediately forwarded to the 
resolved address. If the ARP cache does not contain the listing, a process must be initi- 
ated to resolve the IP address to the MAC address. Resolved entries are stored for a 
specified period of time and then discarded. If the same IP address is used within the 
specified time flame, the MAC address is already known and the packet is simply for- 
warded. If the ARP cache entry has expired, it no longer exists and the discovery process 
must be used, even if the MAC address was previously discovered. 
ARP Process 
There are two steps involved in resolving the IP address to a MAC address: the ARP 
request and ARP reply. The node responsible for forwarding the packet (either the sender 
or a gateway) will use the ARP request message to request the MAC address for the 
next-hop IP address. The format of the ARP request is a MAC-level broadcast that is 
sent to all nodes on the same physical segment as the sender. Whichever node sends the 
ARP request message is called the ARP requester. 
The ARP reply is the return process. The node whose address matches the MAC 
address in the ARP request will respond by sending an ARP reply. This is a unicast 
(directly back to the sender only) MAC flame sent by the node called the ARP 
responder. The ARP responder's unicast message contains both its IP address and its MAC 
address.

Chapter 6 • Network Protocols 
Once this process is complete, both nodes now have new information about an IP 
address and the associated MAC address. This information is stored in the ARP cache for 
a specified amount of time. When it expires, if this address is needed again, the same 
request and reply process is used. 
...... ~i::iiiiOTE 
The process of resolving an address to its physical (MAC) address is a very 
~ 
im porta nt one and is likely to be the su bjectof at least one exa m question. 
Typically, questions have to do with how ARP actually resolves the address. 
Remember that the ARP request is a broadcast datagram and the ARP reply is a 
unicast datagram. Datagrams, unlike other messages, do not require the ACK 
message to acknowledge receipt. The broadcast datagram is sent out to all 
hosts, which process the ARP request. If a host's IP address matches the ARP 
request, it sends an ARP reply. The ARP reply is a unicast because it is sent from 
the matching host directly back to the requesting host. No other hosts receive 
this datagram. If it does not match the request, the ARP request is simply dis- 
carded. 
RARP (which is Reverse ARP), is the complete opposite of ARE Where ARP is 
the process of resolving a known IP address to its MAC address, RARP will resolve an 
IP address to a known MAC. Remember, it's simply the opposite of ARP and very easy 
to remember simply by its name alone. 
Although not necessarily testable on the Network+ exam, there are other forms of 
ARP that you should be aware of as a Network+ technician that you will see in use in 
your day-to-day activities. 
Inverse ARP 
On non-broadcast-based multiple access (NBMA) networks, such as wide area technolo- 
gies including ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode), Frame Relay, and X.25, the net- 
work interface address is not the MAC address. Instead, it is a virtual circuit. In these 
cases, the IP address is mapped to the virtual circuit over which the packet is traveling. 
In resolving addresses in NBMA networks, the virtual circuit identifier is known, but the 
receiving node's IP address is not. Inverse ARP (InARP) is used to resolve the IP address 
on the other end of the virtual circuit. InARP was specifically designed for Frame Relay 
circuits. InARP uses a query on each virtual circuit to determine the IP address of the 
interface on the other end. A table is built using the results of these queries for use in 
resolving addresses in NBMA networks. 

Network Protocols • Chapter 6 
387 
Proxy ARP 
Proxy ARP occurs when one node answers AR.P requests on behalf of another node. 
This is typically the case in subnets where no router is present. An ARP proxy device is 
placed between nodes on the network. This device is aware of all nodes on its physical 
segment and can respond to ARP requests and facilitate the forwarding of packets on 
the network. An AI<P proxy device is often a routing device, but it does not act as an IP 
router. 
Static and Dynamic IP Routers 
Routing tables can be updated manually or dynamically. If the table must be updated 
manually, it is considered to be static. If the table can be updated automatically, it is con- 
sidered to be dynamic. Static routing works well in small environments, but does not scale 
well to larger networks. Another useful application of static routing is in subnets that are 
separated from the rest of the network. Rather than using routing protocols across WAN 
connections, static routes can be entered manually at both the main office and remote 
oItice routers to make each network segment reachable. A third common use of static 
routes is to connect a network to the Internet. A Windows Server 2003 computer can 
be used as a static router when it is configured as a multi-homed computer. This entails 
installing two or more network interface cards, each with a separate IP address and 
subnet mask. Static routes can then be configured for the two (or more) networks 
directly attached to the multi-homed computer. 
Dynamic routing occurs when routing tables are automatically and periodically 
updated. Dynamic routers rely upon routing protocols. The two most commonly used 
IP-based routing protocols, are: 
• 
Routing Information Protocol 
• 
Open Shortest Path First 
The Routing Information Protocol was originally designed for use on classful net- 
works. RIP is a distance vector routing protocol and determines routes based on the 
number of hops (how many routers it must pass through). Any route more than 15 hops 
away is considered unreachable. For this reason, RIP does not scale well to large net- 
works. RIP routing tables are dynamically updated using a route-advertising mechanism. 
In contrast to RIR OSPF is a link state routing protocol. The method of dynamically 
updating routing information is through link state advertisements (LSAs) that have infor- 
mation containing both the connected networks and their costs. The cost of each router 
interface is determined by the administrator in order to use best connections first. The 
combined cost of a connection using this classless routing protocol must be less than 
65,535. 
A Windows Server 2003 computer can be configured as a dynamic router, using 
either of these protocols.As with static configurations, multiple NICs must be installed 
www.syngress.com 

388 
Chapter 6 • Network Protocols 
and 1KRAS must be enabled. In dynamic routing, default routes are seldom used. Thus, it 
is not necessary to configure a default gateway on any NIC. When the Routing and 
Remote Access Service is enabled, static routing is enabled. To enable dynamic routing, 
add the RIP and OSPF protocols and enable them on your NICs by adding your NICs 
to the appropriate routing protocol. RIP is more appropriate for small-to medium-sized 
networks and OSPF is appropriate for large networks. Therefore, you are most likely to 
enable one or the other protocol, depending on your network configuration.

One or more questions about routing protocols may come up oo the e×am.

than 16 hops~you'll immediately know that RIP can't be used in this case. 
Since OSPF was specifically designed for Frame Relay circuits, questions about 
OSPF will likely revolve around Frame Relay as opposed to other NBMA types of 
networks. Also keep in mind that a multi-homed computer must have RRAS 
enabled to function as a router, and that it sets up static routing by default. The 
only way dynamic routing occurs is if you install the RIP or OSPF protocols and 
bind your NIC to them. 
Routing Utilities 
There are four commonly used routing utilities. Each typically is run from the com- 
mand line (Start I Run I cmd). The specific command line options available are dis- 
played when the command is typed in at the prompt. See Figure 6.12 for an example of 
the command line options available for the tracert and ping commands. 
• 
route Used to view and modify the entries in the routing table. 
• 
ping Used to verify reachability of intended destinations using ICMP 
(Internet Control Message Protocol) Echo messages. 
• 
tracert Used to send ICMP Echo messages to discover the path between a 
node and a destination. 
• 
pathping Used to discover the path between a host and destination or to 
identify high-loss links.

A very common use of the ping utility is to check connectivity from one computer 
to another. From your computer, you can run the ping utility from the command 
window.You can ping using an IP address or hostname. If your computer cannot con- 
nect to the network, you can try to ping a known server or another computer (by IP 
address or name) on your network. If that does not work, the next step is to ping the 
local computer, which tests the internal network communication functions of your 
computer (NIC and TCP/IP stack) by using the following command: ping localhost 
or ping 127.0.0.1 (the loopback address). If this fails, the problem is with the configu- 
ration of the TCP/IP stack on your computer. If pinging the loopback address is suc- 
cessful, the problem is probably external to the NIC. 
M WARNING 
Before exam day, try each of these utilities on a networked computer. Once you 
see how the utility works and what the return values are, you'll have a much 
clearer idea of how each is used. Scenarios based on using these utilities may 
trip you up if you're not certain which utility has which function. Memorize the 
functions of these four utilities. You'll probably see one or more of them used in 
a network scenario. You will learn more about these commands and utilities as 
well as troubleshooting in general in Chapters 11 and 12 respectively. 
IP routing involves using both direct and indirect routes to deliver packets to their 
intended destinations. Static and dynamic routing tables are used to determine how to 

390 
Chapter 6 • Network Protocols 
best send the packet. With the use of the IP protocol and other associated protocols 
(Application Layer protocols, UDP datagrams, ICMP messages, or routing protocols), 
messages are reliably and quickly encoded, sent, and decoded. 
Example of a Simple Classful Network 
Class A, B, and C networks are often subnetted to increase efficiency of the network. 
Broadcasts are kept on local subnets, preventing wider distribution of broadcast traffic, 
and IP data that is intended for a host on the local subnet is kept local and not passed 
across a router. Routing tables are used to determine how an IP packet will be sent. If its 
destination IP address matches the local network, the data is sent to the destination host. 
If the address does not match the local network ID, the packet is sent to the router, or 
gateway for forwarding. Figure 6.13 shows two segments of a Class B network and a 
sample routing table for a host on Subnet A.

The routing table contains several entries that should look familiar. The first entry is 
the default route, which is used if no other entries in the routing table match the desti- 
nation IP's network ID. Notice that the gateway is Router 1 and the interface is the IP 
address for the host. The second entry in the routing table is the loopback address, which 
is the same for each host. The third entry is for the directly attached network. The Class 
B network ID is 130.14.0.0 with a subnet mask of 255.255.128.0. Data intended for the 
directly attached network is not forwarded to a router, but is delivered directly to the 
destination IP address from the source address. The gateway and interface IP addresses 
are set to the host IP address to indicate the data originated at the host. The next entry, 
130.14.0.4, is the host address. Data sent from the host to the host is looped back, as 
reflected by the gateway and interface addresses of 127.0.0.1. Finally, a route exists to the 
printer on Subnet B. The destination IP address is on the other subnet and the gateway 
and interface addresses are those belonging to Router 1. As you can see, classful subnet- 
ting and routing is relatively easy to understand conceptually, but can be quite complex 
in its implementation.

section we will look at some of the various protocols and services that operate 
this 
within the TCP/IP protocol suite. We have covered the TCP/IP suite as it stacks up 
against the OSI model and examined not only its operation, but also the other protocols 
and functions that work within it. As we mentioned in an earlier section, there could be 
volumes of books dedicated to this subject, and sometimes to each specific protocol. For 
instance, RIP is a protocol within the TCP/IP protocol suite and there are many books 
dedicated to how to configure it to function on Cisco or 3COM routers. Make sure 
that you do expand your reading on these protocols, as they are very important to know 
as a working network engineer.You will be working with many different products, so 
starting to familiarize yourself with them is essential to your success beyond this exam. 
Using protocols like Telnet, SSH (Secure Shell), and FTP are daily, if not hourly 
occurrences. As a joke, I tallied up how many times I remotely connected to devices in 
one hour of one day at about 10:00 A.M. Within that hour, I remotely connected to 
over 54 devices using a plethora of tools, such as Telnet and SSH for terminal emulation 
to UNIX servers and Cisco routers located at that company. Now that you understand 
how many times you possibly may be using this protocol (or already do), you should 
spend some time digging into the operation of each one so that you understand the 
underlying way the protocols and services work.

392 
Chapter 6 • Network Protocols 
Knowing a little about how each protocol operates as well as some of the distinctive 
nuances (such as knowing the differences between TCP and UDP) that set them apart 
can really give you an edge when it comes to doing your job, administration, trou- 
bleshooting, and so on. Questions like, "what are the benefits of using a UDP port when 
using TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol)?" should be easy enough for you to answer 
silently in your mind. The answer here would be, "because when using TFTR you do 
not need all the overhead of FTP, which makes it quicker and much easier to use."That 
makes sense, but on the other hand, using TFTP is a security risk on tightly controlled 
networks because it doesn't have the overhead that FTP does to allow for a more secure 
login and so on. This may mean you need to steer clear of using it, if not allowed by 
your company's security policy. All of these decisions and suggestions can only be 
decided upon and made if you have knowledge of the technology. In this section we 
will cover the services and applications you need to know for the Network+ exam. Let's 
start to learn more about these protocols and services and see what they offer. 
In this section we will define the purpose, function and use of the following proto- 
cols used in the TCP/IP protocol suite: TCR UDR FTR SFTP (Secure File Transfer 
Protocol), TFTR SMTR HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure), POP3/IMAP4 
(Post Office Protocol version 3/Internet Message Access Protocol version 4), Telnet, 
SSH, ICMR ARR RARR NTP (Network Time Protocol), SCP (Secure Copy Protocol), 
LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol), IGMR LPR (line printer remote).The 
protocol suite is not limited to these protocols; there are obviously many more, as shown 
in Figure 6.14.

The protocols listed and covered here in the text are directly from the Network+ 
testable objectives. Make sure that if you expand your studies of TCP/IP you definitely 
learn about the other protocols and services available, such as BGP (Border Gateway 
Protocol). 
Protocols and Ports 
Before we cover the protocols and services themselves, a discussion on the use of ports is 
essential. Thanks to the multitasking capabilities of most modern operating systems, you 
can use more than one network application simultaneously. For example, you can use 
your Web browser to access your company's homepage at the same time your e-mail 
software is downloading your e-mail. By now, you should know that TCP/IP uses an IP 
address to identify your computer on the network and get the messages to the correct 
system, but how does it separate the response to your browser's request from your 
incoming mail when both arrive at the same IP address? 
That's where ports come in. The two parts of an IP address that represent the net- 
work identification and the host (individual computer) identification are somewhat like 
a street name and an individual street number. In this analogy, the port number would 
identify the specific apartment or suite within the building. 
TCP and UDR the Transport Layer protocols, assign port numbers to each applica- 
tion so the data intended for the Web browser in Apartment A doesn't get sent to the e- 
mail program living in Apartment B. 
Commonly Used Port Numbers 
Although we have covered ports quite a few times throughout the text, this is where it 
should finally sink in and make total sense, because now you know how TCP and UDP 
work and now have a clear definition of ports when used with TCP/IR For the 
Network+ exam, you will be expected to know how TCP and UDP ports function. 
TCP ports, UDP ports, and protocol numbers are important to TCP/IP networking 
and to how networking takes place, especially when it comes to Internet access and fire- 
wall usage. Ports and protocol numbers provide access to host computers. However, they 
also create a security hazard by allowing uninvited access. Therefore, knowing which 
port(s) to allow or disable increases a network's security.You can allow or disallow cer- 
tain traffic to pass a firewall (or ACL~access control list) based on a port number so if 
you didn't want Telnet through a firewall, you can block that port, which would be TCP 
23. If the wrong ports or protocol numbers are disabled on a firewall, router, or proxy 
server as a security measure, essential services might become unavailable.You should also 
understand that port numbers are duplicated from TCP to UDRYou will have TCP and 
UDP ports 23, but because Telnet is a program that requires more overhead than TFTP, 
it will require the usage of TCR so it's TCP 23, whereas, TFTP would be UDP 69.You 
will only need to memorize the port numbers for the exam, not really the concepts 
behind it as just mentioned. In Table 6.24, the ports you need to know for the 
Network+ exam are listed per the objectives.

TCP and UDP 
If you were going to study any two protocols in depth for the Network+ exam, it 
would obviously be TCP and IP. We just spent time covering IP in depth. Now, since 
you understand how IP and ports work, let's delve into TCP and its lesser variant, UDP. 
Two types of connection services are used at the Transport Layer or the OSI model: 
• 
Connection-oriented 
• 
Connectionless 
Which is most appropriate for sending a given message depends on whether relia- 
bility or speed is of highest priority. This is what we need to uncover. In TCP/IP com- 
munications, data is sent over the network as a sequence of datagrams. A datagram is a 
collection of data sent as a single message. Each datagram is sent across the network 
r

Network Protocols • 
Chapter 6 
395 
individually. To recap, 0s and ls are sent across the network medium at Layer 1, the 
Physical Layer. Data Link Layer is responsible for framing and the Network Layer is 
responsible for packets. Datagrams (or segments) are covered at Layer 4, the Transport 
Layer. Now, with TCP (and UDP) at the Transport Layer of the OSI model, we dig 
deeper into their specific operations as data is sent over the network as a sequence of 
datagrams. Let's look at the major differences between connection-oriented versus con- 
nectionless communications. 
TCP and UDP Communications 
A connection-oriented protocol such as TCP offers better error control than UDP, but 
its higher overhead means a loss of performance. A connectionless protocol such as 
UDP, on the other hand, suffers in the reliability department, but, unhampered by error- 
checking duties, is faster. 
As a provider of connection-oriented services, TCP first establishes a virtual connec- 
tion between the sending and receiving computers. This is done through the use of 
acknowledgments and response messages. An acknowledgment message is sometimes 
referred to as an ACK. There are other forms of messages such as SYN and FIN, which 
when sent back and forth from source to destination confirm that information is syn- 
chronized, or finished. There are other tags, but this is enough to give you an idea of 
how TCP provides connection-oriented services. 
The most commonly used analogy for differentiating between connection-oriented 
and connectionless communications compares different services available from the post 
office. If you need to send an important report to the manager of your company's 
branch office in E1 Paso, you could put it in an envelope, affix the required amount of 
postage, and drop it in the corner mailbox. This would be the easiest, quickest way to 
take care of the task, but you would have no idea whether or when the report reached 
its destination. 
On the other hand, you could go to the post office and fill out a card to send the 
report via registered, certified mail, with a return receipt requested. It would cost more 
and it would take more time and effort on your part, but it would be a more reliable 
form of communication.You would get back an acknowledgment when the package 
was delivered, showing that it was indeed received by the person to whom it was 
addressed. 
Connection-oriented services are more like the second example, although they 
actually go one step further: They establish the connection before sending the data. This 
would be as if, before you sent your certified mail, you first got on the telephone with 
the E1 Paso manager and let him know the report was coming so he could be on the 
lookout for its arrival. If you're really detail-minded (or paranoid), you could even ask 
that he call you back when it gets there, and let you know that all the pages are there in 
sequence and it wasn't damaged along the way.You've taken pains to make sure your 

396 
Chapter 6 • Network Protocols 
communication is as reliable as possible, but at a cost in time (and long distance charges) 
to both you and the intended recipient. 
UDP performs the same basic function as TCPmtransport of datagrams~but does 
so in a "bare bones" manner. It does not acknowledge receipt of the messages, nor does 
it sequence the datagrams. UDP should be used when speed is of high priority and 
assured delivery of the messages is less critical. 
A connectionless transport protocol like UDP doesn't provide the same acknowl- 
edgment of receipt process as the connection-oriented TCP does. Since UDP doesn't 
sequence the packets that the data arrives in, an application program that uses UDP has 
to be able to make sure that the entire message has arrived and is in the right order. To 
save processing time, network applications that have very small data units to exchange, 
and thus very little message reassembling to do, may use UDP instead of TCR For 
example, DNS hostname lookup messages that will always fit in a single datagram can 
effectively use UDR For these very short queries, you don't need all the complexity of 
TCP; if you don't receive an answer after a few seconds, you can just ask again. 
Examples of applications that use UDP for communication include TFTP, RIP, 
RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) accounting, and some imple- 
mentations of Kerberos authentication. 
UDP doesn't split data into multiple datagrams, as TCP does. It doesn't keep track of 
what it has sent, data can be resent if needed, and it doesn't guarantee delivery or protect 
against duplication. However, it is not completely irresponsible: it does provide for a 
checksum capability, to ensure that data arrives intact, and it provides port numbers to 
distinguish between the requests sent by different user applications. 
The UDP header is shorter and simpler than the TCP header. It has the source and 
destination port numbers and a checksum, but it doesn't include a sequence number, 
since UDP doesn't do any sequencing. 
In sum, The TCP/IP suite includes two Transport Layer protocols, TCP and UDP. As 
already discussed, TCP is the connection-oriented protocol that should be used when 
error control is of high priority. TCP provides highly reliable, full-duplex transport ser- 
vices, and supports sequence numbering so that large messages can be broken down and 
then reassembled at the receiving end. We learned about full duplex communications in 
Chapter 2, "Network Media", and the same theory applies to TCP. If you want to have 
communications simultaneously in both directions~you are operating in full duplex.

FTP, SFTP, and TFTP 
FTP was covered earlier in the chapter. To recap, the File Transfer Protocol is used for 
copying files from one computer to another and is optimized to do so with some over- 
head added to it to provide such functionality. With commands like get, mget, put, and 
input, as well as options to change files into binary format and others, FTP was born to 
transfer files. 
Do not forget about the other forms of FTP. One such version that is very impor- 
tant to remember for the Network+ exam is SFTP, the security-conscious, encrypted 
form of FTP. FTP is an unsecure protocol because it doesn't contain the overhead to 
protect itself with encryption. If you send your credentials to an FTP server to log in, 
the authentication attempt can be grabbed off the wire with a packet sniffer and used 
against you because the credentials are sent in cleartext and easily read. An inherent 
weakness in the IPv4 version of TCP/IP is that it was not designed with security in 
mind and most of what is sent across the network is sent in cleartext, which means in 
plain view. If the data is intercepted, the data can be read in any standard Sniffer, or 
other capture tool. SFTP protects against data theft, manipulation, or any other attack 
that exploits the inherent weaknesses of FTP. 
~ M WARNING 
~!-- 
FTP has a lot of overhead to transfer files, but what if you wanted a protocol 
'~:~ that quickly transferred files without the need for the overhead? TFTP is one 
~ 
such protocol. As mentioned earlier, TFTP was made to quickly transfer files. It is 
~}~, commonly used with Cisco router hardware and software offerings. 
Exercise 6.4 covers the use of FTP on a Windows XP Professional workstation.You 
should be familiar with basic operations of FTP to pass the Network+ exam. Of course, 
you will be using FTP in your place of work very frequently as a network technician. 
Let's take a look at how to use FTR

, 
After familiarizing yourself with available commands, let's use a few to 
learn how to manipulate the FTP client while working with a server, 
such as an FTP server waiting to supply you with the files you may need. 
To transfer files from the FTP server to a local directory on your worksta- 
tion, you need to be familiar with the put, get, mput, and mget com- 
mands. To get a file from a FTP server, you must first connect and 
authenticate to the FTP server. To do so, you would need to know the IP 
address, or the DNS name of the FTP server to connect to. You can con- 
nect using the following commands. 
C:\>open ftp.novell.com 
ftp> dir 
5. 
Once you can see what is located at the FTP site, you can request files 
and send or receive them based on which commands you select and 
use. For instance, put is used to put files on a server from the client, 
and get is used to get them; obvious and easy. When using input or 
mget, the m stands for multiple and it simply means that you are get- 
ting or putting multiple files on the server at one time, so you don't 
have to specify them separately. 
6. 
Another handy command to learn is how to change data formats. You 
may have data stored on a server in binary format, but need it converted 
to ASCII text. You can do that with the ASCII and binary commands. 

Network Protocols • Chapter 6 
399 
Remember to practice using FTP, as you will be expected to know it not only 
for the Network+ exam, but just about anywhere you work. 
HTTPS 
The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is perhaps the most familiar of the 
Application Layer protocols because it is used on the World Wide Web (WWW). HTTP 
allows computers to exchange files in various formats (text, graphic images, sound, 
video, and other multimedia files) via client software called a Web browser. Web 
browsers such as Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer are only two of many various 
vendor offerings. 
A computer running a Web server program, such as Microsoft's Internet Information 
Server (IIS), stores files in HyperText Markup Language (HTML) format that can be 
accessed by the client browser. These HTML pages often contain hyperlinks for quickly 
and automatically connecting to other files on the Internet, on an intranet, or on the 
local machine. Other types of pages can also be kept on the server and accessed, such as 
XML (eXtensible Markup Language), but HTML is the most common one that you 
will be accessing. 
The current version is HTTP 1.1, which was developed by a committee of the 
IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force). It contains enhancements that allow for faster 
transfer of information. The specifications for HTTP 1.1 are defined in proposed RFC 
2068, which can be accessed on the Web at www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/rfc2068.txt. 
HTTPS is the encrypted version of HTTR Just like FTP and SFTP, HTTPS cures 
some of the inherent weaknesses in HTTP such as clear transmission of data. If you 
caught a Web request from a source address, you could easily see the URL (Uniform 
Resource Locator) used to get that Web page. HTTPS is also known for its use with 
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), used mostly in e-transactions to protect the buyer pur- 
chasing goods online using HTML pages. With HTTPS, the pages and transmissions can 
be secured from prying eyes. 
~ M WARNING 
~ 
HTTPS uses port 443. HTTPS is also known as SSL. S-HTTP is NOT HTTPS; it's a 
~ 
different version of the protocol, not a typo. Whereas SSL is designed to estab- 
'W 
lish a secure connection between two computers, S-HTTP is designed to send 
individual messages securely. You will only need to know HTTPS for the 
Network+ exam.

Chapter 6 • Network Protocols 
SMTP, HTTP, POP3, and IMAP4 
Every time you send and receive e-mail, you are not only using TCP/IE but are also 
using higher-level Application Layer protocols such as SMTP, POP3, and IMAP4. The 
SMTP is used for sending e-mail on the Internet. SMTP is a simple ASCII protocol and 
is non-vendor-specific. Because SMTP has limited capability in queuing messages at the 
receiving end, most e-mail client programs use SMTP for sending e-mail, and either 
POP3 or IMAP4 for receiving the messages that come in and are stored on a server. For 
more information about SMTP, see P,.FC 821 at www.cis.ohio- 
state.edu/htbin/rfc/rfc821.html. SMTP is the lifeblood of e-mail across the world, as it 
ensures that e-mail data is transferred from server to server and from clients to servers. 
POP3 is a scaled-down protocol that allows you to use a thin e-mail client and 
access your e-mail quickly; it has less overhead than SMTP and is commonly used with 
ISP accounts and remote user accounts in production networks. 
IMAP4 is a scaled-up version of POP3 with more functionality than POP3. 
Knowing very explicit differences between IMAP4 and POP3 is not needed for the 
exam, other than knowing that IMAP4 has more overhead and functionality than 
POP3. POP3 and SMTP are still the most widely used e-mail protocols.

Telnet and SSH 
Out-of-band (OOB) management of systems requires to use of a program to facilitate it,. 
t g 
such as terminal emulation. If you are trying to connect to a remote system that is run- 
ning a service or daemon that allows for the use of Telnet to the system, then by simply 
using TCP/IP on your own system (UNIX, Windows, or otherwise), you can use a pro- 
gram like Telnet (with the Telnet protocol) to achieve this functionality. 
Telnet is a TCP/IP-based service that allows users to log on to, run character-mode 
applications, and view files on a remote computer. Windows Server 2000 and 2003) 
include both Telnet server and client software. UNIX has always used Telnet as its ter- 
minal emulation solution. UNIX was the first network operating system (NOS) to work 
with Telnet. Telnet differs from FTP in that you cannot transfer files from one computer 
to another (upload or download) using Telnet. Telnet is often used to access a UNIX 
shell account on an ISP's server and delete e-mail messages directly from the server 

Network Protocols • Chapter 6 
401 
without downloading them to the local machine. The Telnet protocol itself is used to 
establish the initial connection to FTP and SMTP servers from the host's user agent. 
SSH, sometimes known as Secure Socket Shell or simply as Secure Shell, is a protocol 
for securely getting access to a remote computer. It's nothing more than encrypted 
Telnet. It is widely used by network administrators to control Web and other kinds of 
servers remotely. SSH is actually a suite of three utilities: slogin, ssh, and scp, which are 
secure versions of the earlier UNIX utilities, rlogin, rsh, and rcp. SCP will be covered 
later in the chapter. SSH commands are encrypted and secure in several ways. Note that 
UNIX commands must be in lowercase. 
Both ends of the client/server connection are authenticated using a digital certifi- 
cate, and passwords are protected with encryption. SSH uses IKSA public key cryptog- 
raphy for both connection and authentication. Encryption algorithms include Blowfish, 
DES, and IDEA. IDEA is the default. 
M WARNING 
Telnet uses port 21 and SSH uses port 22. This is very easy to remember as they 
are in numerical order. Make sure that you memorize these port assignments 
for the Network+ exam. 
ICMP 
ICMP, which stands for the Internet Control Message Protocol, is known as a mainte- 
nance protocol. It lets two computers on an IP network share IP status and error infor- 
mation. When working on a network, it's important to be able to test the functionality 
of that network. How would you know if data could be transmitted without knowing 
you have a complete path from the source to the destination? That being said, how 
could you test that path? ICMP provides you with two tools that can be used to test a 
path; ping and tracert. ICMP packets will be able to help send information about errors, 
control, and other informational messages. 
WARNING 
@ 
Computers and routers using IP can report errors, and exchange control and 
status information via ICMR Ping and traceroute (tracert) exclusively use the 
ICMP protocol.

Chapter 6 • Network Protocols 
ARP/RARP 
ARP and RARP were covered earlier in this chapter. Remember that ARP works to 
resolve physical addressing to logical addressing, which we know as MAC addresses and 
IP addresses. 
ARP translates the logical IP addresses to physical MAC addresses. ARP discovers 
this information by way of broadcasts, and keeps a table of IP-to-MAC entries. This 
table is referred to as the ARP cache. 
RARP is a similar protocol that does just the opposite: instead of starting with an IP 
address and finding the matching MAC address, it uses the MAC address to find the IP 
address. Exercise 6.5 covers the operation of ARE especially viewing the ARP cache and 
changing it if needed.. 
i 
ADDING AN ARP ENTRY ON A 
WINDOWS XP PROFESSIONAL WORKSTATION 
This exercise is designed to reinforce what we've learned about ARR In this exer- 
cise we will look at the ARP cache utilized on a Windows XP Professional work- 
station. In this exercise we will alter the ARP cache to add a static entry. 
1. To use the ARP program supplied with Windows XP, access the com-

NTP 
For the Network+ exam, you need to be aware of NTR its use and what protocol it uses 
~
t
o
 
communicate with. Network Time Protocol provides a reliable way of transmitting and 
receiving the time over TCP/IP networks. NTR defined in IETF RFC 1305, is useful for 
synchronizing the internal clock of the computers to a common time source. This can be 
very important in directory-based systems such as Novell NetWare's Novell Directory 
Services (also knows as NDS or eDirectory) and Microsoft Windows Active Directory. 
Also, having a reliable time source ensures that your security logs (or logs in general) have 
the correct time stamps on them to help aid in the troubleshooting effort. Nothing works 
better than knowing when something happened. If you don't have accuracy, and happen to 
have the wrong time on a device and then check its logs, it would be impossible to find 
out when something happened that you may want to trace or analyze. 
WARNING 
NTP uses port 123 for communications. 
NNTP 
NNTP is used for managing messages posted to private and public newsgroups. NNTP 
servers provide for storage of newsgroup posts, which can be downloaded by client soft- 
ware called a newsreader. 
Windows 2000 Server and Windows Server 2003 both include an NNTP server 
with IIS. Outlook Express version 5 and later, which is part of the Internet Explorer 
software included with just about any current version of Windows, provides both an e- 
mail client and a newsreader.

~ 
Secure Copy Protocol is used to securely copy files between hosts on a network. It uses 
SSH for authentication and data transfer, thus gaining the features of strong authentica- 
tion and secure encrypted communications. SCP is the main replacement on UNIX sys- 
tems for the ftp and rcp commands.You could say SCP as an encrypted version of rcp. 
LDAP 
LDAP is series of IETF Internet-standard specifications for a lightweight version of the 
X.500 global directory service. DAP, the original form of the protocol, and had too 
much overhead, so LDAP was developed and since then has been used in a great many 
applications, including NDS (eDirectory) and Active Directory, as well as the Netscape 
Directory and many others. A typical LDAP server is a simple network-accessible 
database where an organization stores information about its authorized users and what 
privileges each user has. 
LDAP is a very important protocol to learn about since you will definitely need to use 
it in the future if you are not using it already. The current series of specifications is known 
as LDAP version 2 and is covered in RFC 1777, RFC 1778, and RFC 1779. Both X.500 
and LDAP define the interactions between directory components to provide a global 
directory service. LDAP is used by several PKI (public key infrastructure) implementations, 
often with X.501 directories and X.509 certificates. For the Network+ exam, you need to 
know the fundamentals of LDAP, as well the port it uses (port 389).

IGMP is defined in R.FC 1112 as the standard for IP multicasting. IGMP will establish 
~ h o s t  
memberships in particular multicast groups on a single network. 
IGMP was primarily designed for hosts on multi-access networks to inform locally 
attached routers of their group membership information; groups are created to ease the 
burden of broadcast transmission on a TCP/IP network. Hosts inform routers by multi- 
casting I GMP host membership reports. Once multicast routers receive these reports, 
they can exchange group membership information with other multicast routers. This 
reporting system allows distribution trees to be formed to deliver multicast datagrams. 
IGMP and multicasting were covered in greater detail earlier in the chapter, so if you 
missed the section, you may want to go back and ensure that you read it for the exam.

LPR 
~ 
LP1K was used primarily in UNIX environments and is a printer protocol, but has 
grown in use over the years to multiplatform environments. LPR uses TCP/IP to estab- 
lish a connection between a printer and a workstation requesting its use. 
LPR is nothing more than a UNIX print command. The way the protocol works is 
by copying (or linking) the files you want to print to a separate spool area. From this 
area a daemon copies the spooled file to an assigned printer. 
More Services, Protocols, and Applications 
In this section we will cover more network protocol services, protocols and 
applications that you will need to know for the Network+ exam. 
DNS 
When the Internet was in its infancy, hostnames were resolved to IP addresses via a plain 
text file named hosts.txt. This file was located at the Stanford Research Institute's 
Network Information Center (SRI-NIC). Whenever a machine was added to the net- 
work, or an existing machine's IP address was changed, the hosts.txt file had to be 
edited.This hosts.txt file then had to be downloaded from S1KI-NIC so that all 
machines on the network would have an accurate list of hostnames and IP addresses for 
host name resolution. 
As mentioned earlier in the chapter, an alternative to the hosts file is to use a DNS 
server. DNS servers store FQDN-to-IP address translations. A computer runs the DNS 
client called the DNS resolver, which is configured with the IP address of the DNS 
server. When an IP address is needed, the DNS resolver requests the information from 
the DNS server by first translating the FQDN provided into a DNS name query. When 
the IP address is returned from the DNS server, the DNS resolver provides that infor- 
mation to the requesting application. DNS is a distributed system, so not all mappings 
reside on all DNS servers. Each DNS server is responsible for a particular segment of the 
names and it either returns the requested information or forwards it to the appropriate 
DNS server. We'll learn more about DNS later in this book. In the Windows implemen- 
tation of TCP/IR both a hosts file and DNS are used to resolve hostnames. The hosts file 
is checked first, and if the desired mapping is not present, DNS will be queried.

Microsoft operating systems can still use a hosts file for resolution of FQDNs; 
~ 
however, this hosts file does not use the .txt (or any) extension. A common mis- 
~~take 
in creating a hosts file in Notepad or other text editors is that the applica- 
.I tion saves it with the .txt extension, which means it will not work. Make sure 
that you understand the hosts file.

406 
Chapter 6 • Network Protocols 
A Hierarchical Naming System 
As discussed earlier in the chapter, we could use a hosts file for name resolution, but in 
the past, this has presented several problems. First, the hosts file uses a flat namespace like 
that seen in NetBIOS. The flat namespace requires each computer to have a different 
name. Second, as more and more machines joined the network, traffic at S1KI-NIC 
became a significant bottleneck to network communications. Third, the size of the 
hosts.txt file got increasingly large, which led to long download times, which reduced 
performance for lookups. To solve these problems, Paul Makapetris in 1987 developed 
and proposed the Domain Naming System. DNS was designed to be a hierarchical 
naming system, and responsibility for the DNS database was distributed. In a distributed 
database, hostname lookup times are significantly reduced, and there is fault tolerance for 
the DNS, as no single location is responsible for maintaining the contents or the 
integrity of the DNS database. 
Domain Levels 
At the top of the DNS hierarchy is the root domain. The root domain is sometimes rep- 
resented as a period surrounded by quotation marks ("."), or as a space surrounded by 
quotation marks. If you have read many books on TCP/IE you've probably seen it rep- 
resented both ways. Which one is correct? We will come back to that question when we 
finishing discussing FQDNs. 
Top-Level Domains 
Just underneath the root domain are the top-level domains. The top-level domains con- 
sist of a two- or three-letter designation, such as .corn, .net, .org (called generic 
domains), or .au, .us, .de (country codes). The top-level domains are intended to subdi- 
vide the DNS namespace into logical groups based on the nature of the organization 
participating in a specific top-level domain space hierarchy. For example, organizations 
participating in the .corn hierarchy were originally meant to be commercial, profit- 
making entities. Groups in the .org hierarchy were expected to be nonprofit entities. 
The .net domain was intended for network providers such as ISPs (Internet Service 
Providers). The two-letter designations are country codes, although some countries use a 
two-letter designation to denote the type of organization within a specific country code 
hierarchy; for example, www.bbs.co.uk. 
Second-Level Domains 
The second-level domains lie below the top-level domains. These second-level domains 
typically represent the organizations that own the domain names. A second-level domain 
name can be obtained from a domain registrar, such as Network Solutions, Inc. (NSI). NSI 
was the only registrar for second-level domains in the United States until 1999. There 
are other domain registrars participating in second-level domain registrations now, but 

Network Protocols • Chapter 6 
407 
NSI continues to be the primary purveyor. New domain name registrars are being 
approved on a continuous basis. 
For an up-to-date listing of authorized registrars, see ICANN's website at 
www.icann.org/registrars/accredited-list.html. The second-level domain name 
places your organization in a unique position in the DNS hierarchy. Examples of 
second-level domains are microsoft.com, syngress.com, and rsnetworks.net. 
Subdomains 
The root domain, top-level domains, and second-level domains are the only centralized 
aspects of the Domain Naming System. After you have registered your second-level 
domain name with a domain registrar, you are free to create as many subdomains as you 
like. For example, Microsoft might want to create subdomains for their marketing and 
development divisions, so they could create subdomains named marketing.microsoft.corn 
and dev.microso£t, com. 
The Domain Tree 
Each domain in the DNS hierarchy represents a branch in the "tree." Each branch ter- 
minates with a leaf object (an endpoint object that cannot contain other objects), which 
is a hostname for a machine that belongs to a specific domain. The Microsoft subdomain 
dev.microsoft.com might have machines with the hostnames like www and vbs. Those 
hostnames, then, are leaf objects, or termination points in the DNS tree. 
Each leaf object (or host) can be identified by its location in the tree. Remember 
that only the root, top-level, and second-level domains are centrally managed. It is the 
responsibility of the DNS administrator to maintain the DNS database of hostnames and 
IP addresses for all objects within the subdomain, and any subdomains contained within 
his/her subdomain. In this example, the DNS administrator responsible for the 
dev.microsoft.com subdomain and must manage the resources represented by hosts www 
and vbs, which includes their IP address entries in the DNS database. 
Fully Qualified Domain Names 
In order to identify a host participating in the DNS, you must include more than just 
the hostname. Each computer, or host, belongs to a specific domain, and it is identified 
by its domain membership. The combination of a hostname and its domain name is 
referred to as its fully qualified domain name. All hosts participating in the DNS are 
identifiable via their FQDNs. 
The FQDN is comparable to a full path location for a file on a machine's hard 
drive. For example, if you have a file called cache.dns located in the dns subdirectory, 
which is in the system32 subdirectory, which is in the WINNT subdirectory, which is 
contained on the C: drive, the full path to the cache.dns file would be: 
C:\WINNT\system32\dns\cache.dns 
www.syngress.com 

408 Chapter 6 • Network Protocols 
The location moves from general to specific as you move from left to right in this 
file path example. When specifying an FQDN, however, the path moves from specific to 
general. For example, in the FQDN www.dev.microsoft.com, the leftmost entry (www) 
is the hostname of the machine. The dev domain is a subdomain of the larger Microsoft 
domain, which in turn is a subdomain of the larger corn domain. 
Each level in the FQDN is separated by a dot, or period. The information between 
the dots is referred to as a label, and each individual label can contain up to 63 octets or 
characters.The entire FQDN is limited to 255 octets.You should be aware that although 
labels and FQDNs are allowed a defined number of octets, many applications will not 
accept labels of this length. Domain registrars have traditionally limited domain names to 
22 characters. 
In order to be fully qualified, the name must be terminated with a dot. This is an 
error that many network administrators fail to appreciate when they run into problems. 
This is typically not a problem when users enter FQDNs into a WinSock application 
such as a Web browser or e-mail client, but can be a major issue when using DNS diag- 
nostic tools such as nslookup. Nslookup is a tool that you can use to query a DNS 
server using the Windows command prompt. Chapter 11, "Network Troubleshooting 
Tools," covers the usage of Nslookup. 
'~M 
WARNING 
~!~ DNS uses port 53 to communicate. 
NAT 
NAT is designed for IP address simplification and conservation. NAT is a feature of 
most systems, including Microsoft servers used as routers and configured with RRAS, 
and Cisco devices that use IOS (Internetwork Operating System~the OS that Cisco 
devices use). NAT permits an organization's IP address structure to appear differently to 
outside networks than the actual address space it is using. This allows organizations to 
connect to the Internet without having to use globally unique addressing schemes inter- 
nally. It enables private IP networks that use non-registered RFC1918 IP addresses to 
connect to the Internet. 
Generally, NAT is used when a company's internal addresses are not globally unique 
and thus cannot be routed on the Internet (for instance, using 1LFC 1918 private 
addresses), or because two separate networks that need to communicate are using an 
overlapping IP address space. 
In most cases, NAT allows hosts on a private network (inside network) to transpar- 
ently communicate with destination hosts (outside network) in a global or public network. 
www.syngress.com 

Network Protocols • Chapter 6 
409 
This is achieved by modifying the source address portion of an IP packet as it traverses the 
NAT device. The NAT device tracks each translation (conversation) between the source 
host (inside network) and the destination host (outside network), and vice versa. 
NAT converts IP addresses from the private address space to the public address 
space. When a device performing NAT receives a packet from the internal network, it 
changes the source IP address, recalculates the appropriate checksums, and sends it to the 
Internet. This obscures the true source address. 
NAT is a method by which IP addresses are mapped from one address realm to 
another. This type of translation provides transparent routing from host to host. There are 
many variations of address translation that assist in translating different applications. 
Figure 6.15 shows a common use of NAT in an enterprise environment. In this 
example, someone at home wants to surf rsnetworks.net. When they do, the request goes 
to the server that holds that information by DNS over the Internet. Once the request 
packets are sent to the Web server's network, the router that sits on the perimeter per- 
forms network address translation on the packets. In this example, the packets are sent to 
a server inside the network with an IP address of 192.168.1.10. When the data that was 
requested is sent back, the router maintains the information needed to return the packets 
in its internal tables. Some router vendors call these translation tables. Cisco calls them 
Mate on their PIX firewalls.

Another commonly used technology, although not on the listed objectives, but equally 
important, is PAT. PAT extends the concept of translation one step further by also trans- 
lating transport identifiers like TCP and UDP port numbers and ICMP query identifiers. 
This allows the transport identifiers of a number of private hosts to be multiplexed into 

410 Chapter 6 • Network Protocols 
the transport identifiers of a single global IP address. PAT allows numerous hosts from the 
internal network to share a single external network IP address. The advantage of this type 
of translation is that only one global IP address is needed, whereas with NAT, each internal 
host must translate to a unique external IP address. PAT can be particularly useful for loca- 
tions or users connected via cable modem, Digital Subscriber Line (DSL), or other similar 
arrangement wherein they are provided a single global, public IP address. In such sce- 
narios, all inside addresses are translated to this single address. 
~~M WARNING 
NAT hides the local internal IP addresses from external Internet users, which 
provides a layer of security to your network. 
Internet Connection Sharing 
Much like the example just used with the rsnetworks.net Web server, Internet 
Connection Sharing (ICS) also performs translation from one NIC to another NIC. ICS 
is Microsoft's answer to NAT.Apply the same concepts of NAT to ICS and you are 
already starting to understand what ICS does. When you run a home PC, you can Share 
a small network inside of your home out to the Internet through a computer Currently 
connected to the Internet ifICS is configured correctly. 
With ICS there is a small amount of configuration necessary. In order to permit 
traffic to flow from within your network out to the Internet, you must add the ICS ser- 
vice and its operational settings.You may do so by entering the Services Definition on 
the Services tab of the ICS or Internet Connection Firewall (ICF) host computer. 
The operational settings provide the parameters that are required in order for ICF to 
allow traffic to travel from the Internet to the network and ICS to forward traffic. If all 
is configured correctly, you will be able to access the Internet from within your small 
network. The information needed to add a service definition includes: 
• 
The description of the service 
• 
The name or IP address of the computer hosting the service 
• 
The TCP or UDP port number of the service 
Services like FTP, e-mail, Telnet, and Web Services are examples of built-in services 
that come predefined in ICF and ICS. ICS is intended for use in a network where the 
ICS host computer directs network communication between computers and the 
Internet and vice versa.

WINS 
The Windows 2000 Windows Internet Name Service is a service designed solely to ser- 
vice NetBIOS requests for Windows-based systems. The Windows Server 2003 WINS 
server is fully RFC-compliant and includes many extra features that optimize its use on 
Windows networks. In this section, we'll examine the types of exchanges that take place 
between the WINS client and WINS server. 
When a WINS client starts up, it will register its NetBIOS name with a configured 
WINS server via a NetBIOS name registration request. If the WINS client's name does not 
already exist in the WINS server's database, the WINS server will send a positive 
NetBIOS name registration response to the WINS client. 
If the WINS client's name is already in the WINS database, the WINS server returns 
a WACK (wait for acknowledgement) message to the WINS client. The WINS server 
then issues a challenge (NetBIOS node adapter status message) to the IP address associated 
with that NetBIOS name in its database. If there is no response from the registered 
owner of the NetBIOS name, the WINS server will return a positive NetBIOS name 
registration response to the WINS client, and its name and IP address will be recorded 
in the WINS database. If the owner does respond to the challenge, the WINS client that 
is attempting to register the name will receive a negative NetBIOS name registration 
response and will not be able to initialize its TCP/IP stack. If the computer that is regis- 
tering its name and the IP address is the same as the one in the WINS database, it will 
be treated as a refresh of the WINS database entry, and the renewal date will be updated 
for the entry. 
A WINS database entry must be renewed periodically. The amount of time that can 
pass before the WINS client must renew its name is the renewal Interval, which is config- 
ured at the WINS server. The default for the Windows 2000 WINS server is 6 days, or 
144 hours (this is correct. Six days is 144 hours. If you have read some of the Windows 
NT 4.0 books on the market, you might have noticed that many of them state the 
Windows NT 4.0 WINS server's default renewal interval was "4 days, or 144 hours." 
While you might have figured this was just "WINS new math," it was in fact an error in 
the Windows NT WINS server help file that was then perpetuated by the authors of 
several popular books).

to act as a proxy between internal Web clients and the websites that they surf. 
The proxy server acts as the go-between and protects the internal clients, as 
well as caching the pages for them for quicker access and retrieval. Although 
you may not get a question on a WINS proxy agent, it may be used as a dis- 
tracter, so stay alert when taking the test. 
You do not need to be a master of WINS to pass the Network+ exam, but you do 
need to understand what it is and how to define it as well as understand its basic function-

Linux-and UNiX-based NetBIOS name service) you will need to master this technology.

Network Protocols • Chapter 6

SNMP 
The Simple Network Management Protocol provides a way to gather statistical informa- 
tion.An SNMP management system makes requests of an SNMP agent, and the infor- 
mation is stored in a Management Information Base (MIB). The MIB is a database that 
holds information about a networked computer (for example, how much hard disk space 
is available or a temperature reading from a sensor). SNMP is a very handy management 
protocol. 
SNMP is not a utility in and of itself. Rather, it is a protocol used to communicate 
status messages from devices distributed throughout the network to machines configured 
to receive these status messages. Machines that report their statuses run SNMP agent 
software, and machines that receive the status messages run SNMP management soft- 
ware. One way to remember how this works is to think of the agent software as the 
"secret agent" that gets information about a network device, and then reports the infor- 
mation to his "manager" at headquarters. 
While the name of the protocol itself would lead you to believe that the primary 
function is to allow you to manage objects on the network, management in this context 
is more related to monitoring, rather than actually effecting any changes to the devices 
themselves. Administrators typically think of managing something as taking an active role 
in configuring or changing the behavior of a device, so don't let the name of the pro- 
tocol fool you. 
SNMP allows you to audit the activities of servers, workstations, routers, bridges, 
intelligent hubs, and just about any network-connected device that supports the installa- 
tion of agent software. In order for agent software to collect information regarding a 
particular service, a MIB must be created. The MIB is a database and a collection of 
instructions about how and what information should be gathered from a system. The 
MIBs included with Windows 2000 allow the agent software to communicate a wide 
range of information. 
The agent is responsible for reporting the information gathered by the MIB. 
However, agents rarely volunteer information spontaneously. Rather, the agent must be 
queried by an SNMP management system before it gives up its knowledge. 
There is an exception to this: a trap message. A trap message is sent spontaneously by 
an agent to an SNMP management system. For example, we could set a trap message for 
indicating that the World Wide Web service is hung. We would then configure the agent 
to send a trap message to the IP address of our computer running the SNMP manage- 
ment software so that we can quickly handle this catastrophic event. Remember, in sum, 
SNMP is a set of protocols for managing networks. SNMP works by sending messages, 
called protocol data units (PDUs). SNMP-compliant devices, called agents, store data 
about themselves in MIBs and return this data to the SNMP requesters. Management 
systems can be deployed to help you manage your network or system use SNME

Network File System 
Network File System (NFS) is a distributed file system protocol suite developed and 
licensed by Sun Microsystems that allows different makes of computers running different 
operating systems to share files and disk storage. 
In actuality, NFS is simply one protocol in the suite. NFS protocols include NFS, 
RPC (remote procedure call), XDR, and others. These protocols are part of a larger 
architecture that Sun refers to as ONC (Open Network Computing). The original ver- 
sion ofRPC was defined in I(FC 1050. Version 2 ofRPC is defined in t(FC 1057. The 
ONC RPC version 2 is defined in RFC 1831. 
Server Message Block 
SMB, short for Server Message Block, is a Microsoft-based protocol developed for file 
and print sharing. SMB is a message format used by DOS and Windows to share files, 
directories, and devices. NetBIOS is based on the SMB format, and many network 
products use SMB. These SMB-based networks include LAN Manager, Windows for 
Workgroups, and so on. There are also a number of products that use SMB to enable file 
sharing among different operating system platforms. 
A product called Samba enables UNIX and Windows machines to share directories 
and files. Samba is an open source implementation of the SMB file sharing protocol that 
provides file and print services to SMB/CIFS clients. CIFS stands for the Common 
Internet File System, the advanced version of SMB. 
Samba allows a non-Windows server to communicate with the same networking 
protocol as the Windows products. Samba was originally developed for UNIX, but can 
now run on Linux, FreeBSD, and other UNIX variants. It is freely available under the 
GNU General Public License (GPL).

Zero Configuration 
Zero configuration (Zeroconf) IP networking is a method of networking devices via an 
Ethernet cable without requiring configuration and administration. Zeroconf is able to 
allocate addresses without a DHCP server, translate between domain names and IP 
addresses without a DNS server, and find services, such as a printer, without a directory 
service. This is meant to be used in small networks. 
Zeroconf has one goal in mind, and that is to enable networking in the absence of 
configuration and administration. As crazy as this may sound, Zeroconf is destined to 
make this a reality. 
Zero configuration networking is required for environments where administration is 
impractical or impossible, such as in the home or small office, embedded systems 
plugged together, as in an automobile, or to allow impromptu networks built on-the-fly 
as needed. Because networking can be somewhat complicated, having systems that con- 
figure themselves can seem ideal.

Line Printer Daemon 
The Line Printer Daemon (LPD) is the UNIX standard print service daemon. Used in 
conjunction with LPR, the LPD software typically is stored in the printer or print 
server and the LPR software must be installed in the client device. The LPR client sends 
the print request to the IP address of the LPD printer/server, which in turn queues the 
file and prints it when the printer becomes available. 
LPD listens on TCP port 515. The service will listen for print service requests. Once 
received, the request will be serviced.

S u m m a ry of Exam 0 bj ectives 
Understanding T CP/IP from the ground up is required to effectively manage a network 
whether local (LAN) or wide (WAN). TCP/IP is a suite of protocols originally devel- 
oped by the Department of Defense in a project called the Advanced Research Projects 
Agency (DARPA). The first wide area network implemented using these protocols was 
called the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET). It was during 
this time that TCP/IP was designed and developed as a standardized way for computers 
to communicate across a network. 
From the DARPA experiment came the understanding that networking would 
become increasingly common--and increasingly complex. The OSI model was devel- 
oped, based on the DARPA model, and approved by Open Systems Interconnection 
(OSI) subcommittee of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). The 
OSI model defined seven layers for standard, reliable network communications" Physical, 
Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application. The acronym 
commonly used to remember this is (in reverse order)" All People Seem To Need Data 
Processing. The OSI model was covered in depth in Chapter 5. It will, however, con- 
tinue to be used through the rest of the text. As you can see, the use of it becomes very 
important when discussing network protocols, the heart of this chapter's content. For the 
Network+ exam, make certain that you memorize the OSI model and the placement of 
T CP / IP p rot o c ols within it. 
The TCP/IP protocol suite provides the functionality specified in the OSI model 
i:!iiii 'i~ii~ii~
using the four related layers of the DoD model: Network Interface, Internet, Host-to- 
~ ~{{~ ~'~'~ 
Host, and Application.This is because it's hard to map TCP/IP protocols to the OSI 
model, also discussed in the previous chapter. The Network Interface maps to the 
...................................

{ }7 
Physical and Data Link layers; the Internet Layer maps to the OSI's Network Layer. The 
:}{{{i}::{{{ {{{{{
Host-to-Host Layer maps to the Transport Layer and DoD's Application Layer maps to 
{ { 
the Session, Presentation, and Application Layers of the OSI model. Some of the more 
commonly known Application layer protocols are FTe, HTTP, POP3, WINS, DNS, and 
Fiiiii~iiiii 
iii?i:~i~iiiiiiiii~ 
DHCP. Within these layers are protocols that are covered in this chapter, all of which 
i~!l 
you must remember for the exam. 
At the Internet Layer is the Internet protocol used for addressing data for delivery 
! 
across a network. Understanding IP addressing is a fundamental skill needed both on the 
job and for this exam. IP addresses are 32-bit addresses represented in dotted decimal 
format (w.x.),.z). The 32 bits contain both a network and host ID.To understand IP 
addressing, you must first understand how to convert the dotted decimal numbers into 
binary and back to decimal. In order to send data to the correct location, the IP address 
in the packet is compared, using bitwise ANDing, to the subnet mask. If the result is the 
....... 
local network address, the packet stays on the local network. IfANDing indicates that 
~i 
the network address is external to the local network, the packet is sent to the defined 
default gateway for forwarding.

Chapter 6 • Network Protocols 
Network addresses were originally designed in a class-based system. Class A net- 
works use the first octet (w) and have an address range of 1.x.y.z to 126.x.yz. Class B 
networks use the first two octets for the network ID and have an address range of 
128.0.y.z to 191.255.y.z. Class C networks use the first three octets for the network ID 
and have an address range of 192.0.0.z to 223.255.255.z. Each class of network, when 
undivided, uses a default subnet mask, which identifies which bits of the IP address rep- 
resent the network ID. The default subnet masks are: Class A: 255.0.0.0; Class B: 
255.255.0.0; Class C" 255.255.255.0. 
Classful networks can be subdivided for greater efficiency by reducing the number 
of hosts per segment, thus reducing network traffic. Subnetting requires the subdividing 
of the class-based network IDs using custom subnet masks. These are developed by using 
bits from the host address space. The number of subnets that can be created from the 
network ID depends on the number of bits taken from the host address space. There is 
an inverse relationship between the number of subnets and the number of hosts per 
subnet. Typically, organizations choose to have a maximum of 256 devices per subnet for 
the most efficient use of network bandwidth. 
Packets destined for networks that are not local are forwarded using gateways or 
routers. IP routing involves resolving the hostname or NetBIOS name to an IP address 
and resolving the IP address to a MAC address. NetBIOS name resolution uses four dif- 
ferent node types to resolve names to IP addresses: broadcast (B-node), peer-to-peer (P- 
node), mixed (M-node), and hybrid (H-node). Names can also be resolved by using a 
hosts file or through the Domain Name Service (DNS). Names must be resolved to IP 
addresses. The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is used to resolve the IP address to 
the Media Access Control (MAC) address that is unique to each Network Interface 
........ Card (NIC) manufactured. 
....................................... 
.................... 
Routing on a network can be static or dynamic, depending on whether or not 
dynamic routing protocols are installed. Many computers designed as routers include this 
function, but a Windows Server 2003 computer can be set up as a router by installing 
two NICs, enabling the Routing and Remote Access Service OKRAS) via the registry 
and installing and configuring both the Routing Information Protocol (RIP) and Open 
Shortest Path First (OSPF) dynamic routing protocols. Four commonly used routing 
utilities are route, ping, tracert, and pathping. Each can be run from the command line in 
Windows. Protocols such as APIPA and DHCP help to get systems logically addressed 
dynamically. Protocols such as DNS and WINS help to provide name resolution as well. 
In this chapter we also covered the use of protocol ports and the importance of 
them.You must memorize these port assignments for the Network+ exam.You will def- 
initely not only see them there, but also need to use them daily on the job as a

Identify and Differentiate Between the 
~~ 
IP Addressing Methods" Static, Dynamic, and APIPA 
V----4I Static IP addressing is done manually. It is hard to manage and adjust, as you 
have to visit every system that has an address if you want to change the 
addressing scheme from one range of IP addresses to another, such as from 
192.168.1.0 to 10.1.1.0. 
V--¢I Dynamic IP addressing is done automatically. This can be done with DHCP or 
with APIPA.

V----d Self-assigned (APIPA [Automatic Private Internet Protocol Addressing]) is a 
Microsoft Windows-based service (but available to any OS) that will allow for 
a Windows 98, ME, 2000, 2003, or XP system to assign itself an address from a 
designated private block ranging from 169.254.0.1 to 169.254.255.254, with a 
subnet mask of 255.255.0.0.

V-----d TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), together with Internet Protocol (IP), is 
one of the core protocols underlying the Internet. TCP enables two computers 
to establish a connection and exchange information and is a connection- 
oriented protocol. TCP guarantees delivery of data and also guarantees that 
information packets will be delivered in the same order in which they were sent 
V------d UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a connectionless, unreliable, Transport Layer 
protocol that provides multiplexing and error detection for applications that 
require a low-overhead protocol for one-shot transactions that do not promise 
guaranteed delivery. Protocols such as TFTP rely on UDR 
Vii FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a very common protocol used to move files 
from one location to another. FTP was created to transfer files and is 
optimized to do so.You use FTP by logging in using an account name 
(commonly seen as "anonymous"). 
SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) is very similar to FTP, but performs all 
operations over an encrypted SSH transport, which adds a layer to security to 
the unsecure FTR IPv4-based protocols in the TCP/IP protocol suite in that 
version were commonly unsecure, hence the development of IPv6, which 
clears up many inherent weaknesses in its predecessor. When you use SFTR 
you gain the benefits of public key encryption and compression. 
VII TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) is used to quickly send files across the 
network with fewer security features than FTP. It is meant to be quick and 
easy to use. 
SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is the de facto protocol used to send e- 
mail on the Internet and in many of the world's networks today. 
HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is used to transfer files and other data 
across the Internet. HTTP is the most important protocol used in the World 
Wide Web (WWW) today. It is also very unsecure. 
HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) is a Web protocol developed by 
Netscape that encrypts and decrypts user page requests as well as the pages that 
by the Web server. It runs over SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). 

Network Protocols • Chapter 6 423 
V¢I POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3) is the most common protocol used to 
retrieve e-mail from a mail server. If you have your e-mail on a server, with the 
right credentials you can set up a POP3 client on your local PC and download 
your e-mail for reading. 
V¢l IMAP4 (Internet Message Access Protocol version 4) allows a client to access 
ii 
and manipulate e-marl messages on a server just like POP3, but with several 
i 
enhancements. IMAP includes operations for creating, deleting, and renaming 
mailboxes; checking for new messages; permanently removing e-marl, and so on. 
V¢I Telnet will allow you to open a remote session over TCP/IP networks to a 
remote host. Telnet performs terminal emulation. Commands you enter from 
your own system are executed exactly as if you were sitting in front of a 
remote system. 
V¢l SSH (Secure Shell) is a protocol that allows you to encrypt all data traveling 
from one system to another using different types of encryption algorithms. The 
~ ::~ ~:,:~::~:~,~:.~;~z
server you are connecting to must be running SSH, and you must be running

Chapter 6 • Network Protocols 
r-d I GMP (Internet Group Multicast Protocol) was primarily designed for hosts 
on multi-access networks to inform locally attached routers of their group 
membership information. Multicasting is a message sent to a group, which 
differs from unicast (message to one) or broadcast (message to all). 
[---d LPR (Line Printer Remote) is the UNIX print command. 
Define the Function ofTCP / UDP Ports 
gl When you use more than one service at a time on an IP-based system, you 
need to differentiate between all the different things going on, such as sending 
a file using FTR sending an e-mail using SMTP, and connecting to a router to 
change something using Telnet.You have one NIC, one IP address. How do 
you run all three at once? With ports, because 10.0.0.1:23 and 10.0.0.1:25 are 
unique due to the port difference. Make sure you memorize the most 
common ports for the Network+ exam. 
Identify the Well-known Ports Associated 
with the Commonly Used Services and Protocols 
V------d Port 20 maps to FTP (File Transfer Protocol). 
V4I Port 21 also maps to FTP (File Transfer Protocol). 
V------d Port 22 maps to SSH (Secure Shell).

Network Protocols • Chapter 6 4 2 5  
Identify the Purpose of Network Services and Protocols 
V¢[ DNS (Domain Name System) is used to map names to IP addresses and vice 
versa. Domain Name Servers maintain central lists of domain name to IP 
addresses mappings. 
gl NAT (Network Address Translation) is the translation of an IP address used 
within one network to a different IP address known within another network. 
El ICS (Internet Connection Sharing) is a Microsoft solution that is used to allow 
for more than one computer to share an Internet connection through the 
system configured with more than one NIC, a valid Internet connection, and 
ICS. 
V¢I WINS (Windows Internet Name Service) is the same as the NetBIOS Name 
Service, a term created by Microsoft. Similar to DNS (which maps hosl:names 
to IP addresses), WINS is used for the mapping of NetBIOS names to IP 
addresses. WINS servers cut down on the amount of broadcast traffic on your 
network. 
I-4I SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) is used for gathering 
statistical data about just about anything from network traffic all the way to 
reading the temperature on a firewall's chassis. SNMP uses MIBs, which define 
what information is available from any manageable network device. 
V¢I NFS (Network File System) is a protocol suite developed and licensed by Sun 
Microsystems. NFS will allow for data sharing between different vendors 
versions of computers as well as running different operating systems. 
V'¢l Zeroconf (Zero configuration) is a service developed to ease the network 
configuration of devices by setting up the most commonly setup things (such 
as IP address, gateway address, etcetera) for you. 
I-'41 SMB (Server Message Block) is Microsoft's file and print sharing protocol. 
[-4I AFP (AppleTalk File Protocol) allows access to Apple shared servers from 
dissimilar systems such as Windows. 
[El LPD (Line Printer Daemon) is the standard print service daemon and is the 
standard when it comes to printing on UNIX systems.

A: There is an ever-expanding set of Application Layer protocols in use today. It's 
important to get a firm understanding of the most common protocols and to have at 
least a familiarity with the less common protocols. At the very least, you should be 
very familiar with NetBIOS over TCR Windows Sockets, DNS, DHCR WINS, 
Telnet, SMTP, HTTR FTR RIR and SNMR For the Network+ exam, make sure 
you review the testable objectives and absolutely know the protocols and services as

A" No, you do not. For the exam you need to remember the following protocol ports: 
Port 20 maps to FTP (File Transfer Protocol), Port 21 also maps to FTP (File 
Transfer Protocol), Port 22 maps to SSH (Secure Shell), Port 23 maps to Telnet, Port 
25 maps to SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), Port 53 maps to DNS (Domain 
Name System), Port 69 maps to TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol), Port 80 maps 
to HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol), Port 110 maps to POP3 (Post Office 
Protocol version 3), Port 119 maps to NNTP (Network News Transport Protocol), 
Port 123 maps to NTP (Network Time Protocol), Port 143 maps to IMAP4 
(Internet Message Access Protocol version 4) and Port 443 maps to HTTPS 
(HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure). Knowing the rest is important on the job, but 
not for the Network+ exam. As for memorizing all of them, you should only be 
concerned about the ones listed here.You can always visit the IANA website to look 
up a forgotten port number within seconds if you have an Internet connection. 
Q: Will I be expected to know about private addressing for the Network+ exam? 
A: Yes, you will.You need to master the ranges listed. They are: 
....................................................ilia{
10.0.0.0-10.255.255.255, 172.16.0.0-172.31.255.255 and 
192.168.0.0-192.168.255.255.You will be expected to know these, not only for the

Introduction 
In this chapter we will cover WAN (wide area network) standards and security ~rotocols 
that you will see not only on the CompTIA Network+ exam, but also in a large pro- 
duction environment. Most of these protocols and standards are used often and you will 
need to know about them for the Network+ exam. For the Network+ exam, be 
familiar with the speeds, capacities, and the types of media used for each WAN tech- 
nology covered. 
By the end of this chapter, you will know the specifics of the following WAN pro- 
tocols: ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network),T1, El, and X.25.You will also 
understand the basic characteristics of specific WAN technologies, such as how packet 
switching and circuit switching differ. 
  
What is a WAN? 
A wide area network is a computer network covering a wide geographical area, 
including more than one remote location and typically a core network where all 
resources are kept.A WAN is common to any company doing business with remote sites 
that are connected via a network topology. The remote sites build on the core site and a 
WAN is born. Chapter 1 discussed the basics of WANs, and in this chapter, we'll dig in 
a little deeper into how WANs operate and which types are the most commonly used. 
WANs may be created in different configurations, with the most common being 
some combination of public networks and private networks. When working within the

437 
realm of a public network, you are working with networks that are publicly accessed and 
most likely connected to the Internet. IPSec (Internet Protocol Security) and VPN (vir- 
tual Private Network) technologies allow you to build a WAN over the Internet. When 
working in the realm of private networks, you are working with networks that are 
accessed only by designated individuals. This means that you are most likely running a 
private access network using Frame Relay or MPLS (Multi-Protocol Label Switching), 
or a similar technology, and not allowing access to anybody except the company paying 
for it. This means that the network users aren't at the mercy of the public Internet 
where you do not get a guarantee of delivery. 
'~!i~. 
DAY TiP 
A WAN is a data communications network that covers a relatively broad geo- 
graphic area and that often uses transmission facilities provided by common 
...... carriers, such as telephone companies. WAN technologies generally function at 
'%'=~'~: the lower three layers of the OSl (Open Systems Interconnect) reference model" 
the Physical Layer, the Data Link Layer, and the Network Layer. X.25 is a good 
example of a WAN technology that operates at all 3 layers, whereas Frame Relay 
only operates up to Layer 2. 
Switching Methods 
When working with WANs, the operations you do are transparent to you, so you may 
be unaware of the underlying technology that gets data from one location to another. 
There are a number of methods by which data is processed through the network to get 
from point A to point B. WANs operate within two types of switching methods: circuit 
switching and packet switching. 
Although almost all WAN protocols in use today are packet switched, there are still 
some old networks out there using circuit-switching technologies. Technologies such as 
X.25 and Frame Relay are always availablentheir connections are constant, so they do 
not have to be set up every time they are used. Packet switching technologies are always 
available, but circuit switching is not. Circuit switching requires a separate setup for each 
connection session. That is the biggest difference between these two types of switching 
methods. 
Circu it Switching 
Circuit switched networks are not always available, as connections have to be imtiated 
before transmission can take place. This means that when you use technologies such as 
ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network), you will find that the call must first be initi- 
ated (to set up the circuit) and then data can traverse it. Once competed, the circuit can be

438 
Chapter 7 • WAN and Security Standards and Services 
taken down. If a router at a site has to send data to another router at a remote site, the cir- 
cuit is initiated (brought up and online for use). The switched circuit is initiated with the 
circuit number of the remote network. In the case of ISDN, the setup will use a SPID 
(service provider ID) number, which is essentially a phone number that the router dials to 
initiate the circuit with the WAN switch.An example of a sample carrier network is 
shown in Figure 7.1. The cloud represents the carrier's telecommunications network.

Router 
Packet Switching 
Packet switching is the method of sending data from location to location on a WAN 
that is always available. There is no need to initiate a call to a WAN switch, as the con- 
nection is already up and running from the start. When you set the carrier's link up (let's 
use Frame Relay for this example), it stays up. The only time this link should drop is 
during scheduled outages, problems, and emergencies. Other than that, consider packet- 
switched networks to always be available. Some examples of packet-switching networks 
include Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), Switched Multi-megabit Data Services 
(SMDS), and X.25, to name a few. 
Packet-switched networks will also divide the transmitting data into packets, and each 
packet is sent individually from the source to the destination.All packets are given sequence 
numbers so that they can all be put back together again in the right order at the destina- 
tion. The benefit of this is that each packet can take a different route to get to its destina- 
tion. Once there, the message will be recompiled and take its original form. Packet switched 
networks are often shared.This doesn't open you up to security issues, but it does open you 
up to bandwidth challenges.Just be aware that packet-switched networks are not the same 
as point-to-point private lines that provide dedicated bandwidth to the purchaser.

WARNING

The telephone service provided by your carrier is most likely based on a circuit

switching technology. Circuit switching is ideal when data must be transmitted 
N 
quickly and must arrive in the same order in which it's sent. Packet switching is 
.,,: 
@ the opposite of circuit switching. Packet switching is more efficient and robust, 
and it is commonly used for data that can withstand some delays in transmission. 
WAN Standards and Protocols 
Now that you have reviewed the underlying concepts of the WAN and covered some of 
_~~ 
the methods in which they transmit data, let's take a good look at some of the technolo- 
gies that make up the WAN. In this section we will discuss the Network+ objectives 
based on WAN protocols and standards such as T carriers, ISDN, and FDDI (Fiber 
Distributed Data Interface is discussed in Chapter 1).You must be able to understand 
and respond to questions about the speeds, capacity, and media for the Network+ exam. 
T/E Carrier 
T1 lines have been around for a long time and are still very much in use as of today. The 
name T (Terrestrial) and the number following it denotes the type of line. If it is a T1, 
then it is a dedicated media connection supporting data rates of 1.544Mbps. This speed 
is derived from 24 individual channels of 64Kbps (only 23 are available for data transfer 
and network use). If it is a T3, the line can support data rates of about 43 Mbps, which 
is created with 672 channels of 64Kbps. E1 and E3 lines are similar, but they are 
European-based, and J lines are used within Japanese carrier systems. 
For any Network+ technician in the field, it's common to work with T1 and E1 
lines very often. Users can also access just a fraction of the whole bandwidth, which 
would mean that you have leased lines with specific data rates.A T1 line, with its 24 
individual channels, can be configured to carry voice or data traffic. Most telephone 
companies allow you to buy ,just some of these individual channels, known as fractional 
T1 access. T3 lines are used mainly by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) connecting to 
the Internet backbone, although many private companies have implemented T3 lines in 
some of their core networks and data centers. 
As stated earlier, an E1 line is similar to the North American T1 line. E1 is the 
European format for digital transmission, and is similar to a T1 line, but has higher data 
transmission rates. E1 carries signals at 2 Mbps (32 channels at 64Kbps, with 2 channels 
reserved for signaling and controlling). An E3 is the European equivalent to the T3, but 
the T3 has a higher data rate (E3 lines carry data at a rate of about 34.368 Mbps, usually 
rounded up to 35 Mbps). 
T1 channels are sometimes known as DS0s (digital signal Zero). In T-carrier systems, 
DS0 is a basic digital signaling rate of 64 Kbps, corresponding to the capacity of one 
www.syngress.com 

440 
Chapter 7 • WAN and Security Standards and Services 
voice or data channel.Twenty-four DS0s (24 x 64 Kbps) equal one DS1.A full T1 is 
equal to a DS1;a full T3 is equal to a DS3. 
11°  
i ~ :'i 
M WARNING 
~I~~, Make sure _vou are familiar with the speeds of the T- and E-carrier links, as well 
!~ as the number of channels that make up a T1. T3 lines are faster than T1 lines 
~i#i! 
because they have more bandwidth. Use common sense on the exam when 
determining which has a higher capacity. A T3 has a higher capacity than an E3 
and a T3 has a higher capacity than an El, and so on. You may be asked to 
determine which line would you recommend based on the needs of the client, 
so be able to respond by knowing which technologies offer which benefits. 
  
ISDN 
ISDN is a WAN protocol based on an international communications standard for 
sending voice, video, and data over digital telephone lines or normal telephone wires. 
ISDN is commonly seen in the corporate offices of companies worldwide. Mostly used 
for WAN links from one company to another, ISDN is unique, in that it is call initiated 
and call terminated, so you only pay for what you use. ISDN, which uses telephone 
number-like entities called SPIDS to dial from peer to peer to bring up the line when 
traffic has to be sent across it. Once the call is deemed over due to inactivity, the call is 
ended and so is the billing for that usage. ISDN supports data transfer rates of 64 Kbps 
(64,000 bits per second) per channel, and most ISDN circuits used today are configured 
as two channels to provide 128Kbps of throughput. 
There are two types of ISDN: basic rate interface (BRI) and primary rate interface 
(P1KI). B1KI consists of two 64-Kbps B channels and one D-channel for transmitting 
control information. B1KI ISDN has a maximum speed of 128Kbps. PIKI consists of 23 
B-channels and one D-channel (in North America) or 30 B-channels and one D- 
channel (in Europe). The B channel is used for control. 
Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) 
Mthough considered more of a LAN technology, and debated to be a LAN technology, 
FDDI (whether based on the LAN or WAN), is a technology that is used to provide 
very high speed, redundant backbone service to your network. Listed in the Network+ 
objectives, it's imperative that you understand the underlying technology used with 
FDDI. FDDI, which is based onfiber, is the standard for a 100 Mbps dual ring token 
passing technology. Mso based on copper cable, Copper Distributed Data Interface 
(CDDI) provides high speed, redundant transmission of data. The Fiber Distributed Data 
Interface (FDDI) is generally used as a backbone technology due to its redundant 
design, and high speed. Figure 7.2 shows FDDI's overall design.

Basic Rate Interface 
The BRI ISDN service uses two B channels and one D channel (2B+D). Now that you 
understand what a T1 is, it should be pretty simple to understand that a channel repre- 
sents a DS0.You would use two channels at 64 Kbps to total 128 Kbps, which is the rate 
of an BRI ISDN service. If you want to get more then that basic rate, you can move to 
a PRI. 
The B channels are used to send and received data; the D channel is used for sig- 
naling. BRI B-channel service operates at 64 kbps and is meant to carry user data; BRI 
D-channel service operates at 16 kbps and is meant to carry control and signaling infor- 
mation, although it can support user data transmissions under certain circumstances. The 
D channel signaling protocol comprises Layers 1 through 3 of the OSI reference model. 

442 
Chapter 7 • WAN and Security Standards and Services 
B1KI also provides for framing control and other overhead, bringing its total bit rate to 
192 kbps. 
 iiiiiiiiiii ii   _ 
.... ~i"iii~iiii i }V Remember the following" the ISDN basic rate interface service offers two B 
i {i{iii{ !i 
channels and one D channel (2B+D). BRI B-channel service operates at 64 kbps 
and is meant to carry user data; BRI D-channel service operates at 16 kbps and 
can also carry user data but is normally used for management purposes such as 
signaling. 
Primary Rate Interface 
PILl offers 23 B channels and 1 D channel in North America and Japan, yielding a total 
bit rate of 1.544 Mbps (the PRI D channel runs at 64 kbps). In Europe, Australia, and 
other parts of the world, PRI provides 30 B channels plus one 64-kbps D channel and a 
total interface rate of 2.048 Mbps.The PRI Physical Layer specification is ITU-T 1.431. 
This is essentially the same as getting a full T1, except you are getting the ISDN service 
benefits. 
DAY TIP 
............... 
Remember that PRI service offers 23 B channels and 1 D channel in North 
America and Japan, yielding a total bit rate of 1.544 Mbps (the PRI D channel 
runs at 64 kbps). 
In Europe (and other parts of the world), PRI provides 30 B channels plus 
one 64-kbps D channel and a total interface rate of 2.048 Mbps. 
It is important to remember that ISDN is comprised of digital telephony and data- 
transport services offered by regional telephone carriers using preexisting telephone 
wiring. ISDN is also used very often as backup links since they are circuit switched. They 
can be brought up when needed, as in the case of an emergency where the main link to a 
site is down. In these cases, ISDN can be used to fix the problem. Figure 7.3 shows an 
example of both circuit-switched and packet-switched networks in use simultaneously.

You can save money using a hybrid network as well. Since you pay for Frame Relay 
service to be up at all times, it becomes your primary network, and is where your data 
mainly travels. At the same time, each router is conveniently configured with another 
technology (in this example, ISDN), which provides a failsafe or backup network in case 
of failure of the frame circuit, providing high availability to the network users.

Frame Relay 
Frame Relay is a packet-switching protocol for connecting devices on a WAN. Frame 
Relay networks in the United States support data transfer rates at T1 (1.544 Mbps) and 
T3 (45 Mbps) speeds and can be purchased as DS0s. This allows you flexibility, so you 
could have a Frame Relay link from one site to another and need 128 Kbps of available 
circuit bandwidth.You could then purchase 2 channels at 64 Kbps each and that would 
be your circuit speed for your Frame Kelay link. 
Frame Relay, when used in the WAN, is often used between a company's core and 
remote sites and sized very perfectly to whatever bandwidth is needed between the sites. 

444 
Chapter 7 • WAN and Security Standards and Services 
The sizing is done so that the you can take advantage of bursting which is when the car- 
rier allows you to use some of the space on the rest of the whole line (up to 1.544Mbps 
on a T1, for example) if available. 
Frame Relay has a high transmission speed, very low network delay if configured 
properly and sized correctly, and 'is fairly reliable. Because of how the system is main- 
tained in the carrier's internal network, it's easy to make mistakes, as there is a lot to 
configure when you use Frame Relay. This is especially true if you are an engineer 
working on routers or WAN switches inside a carrier's network. Since the service is not 
highly reliable at all times, it's common to back up a Frame Relay network with another 
network such as ISDN. 
Frame Relay is based on the older X.25 packet-switching technology, which was 
designed for transmitting analog data such as voice conversations, and is the skeleton for 
the MPLS solutions now being used in most enterprises today. See the following 
"Notes from the Underground" section for more information on MPLS. 
Although it is losing ground to other technologies that operate using purely Layer 3 
communications (Frame Relay primarily operates at Layer 2 of the OSI model), Frame 
Relay is one of the most prevalent technologies used in wide area networking today. 
Because carriers quickly move to update (and upgrade) their infrastructures to stay com- 
petitive, Frame Relay and ATM technologies are quickly losing ground in favor of pure 
IP-based Layer 3 WAN infrastructure, as this is more compatible with today's voice and 
video applications. Frame Relay networks are still used in many enterprises today and 
must still be supported. Many companies and other institutions using Frame Relay have 
no need at this time to upgrade their networks and will continue to use Frame Relay 
until they do need to migrate to another technology. In any case, much like X.25, Frame 
Relay is a becoming a less frequently used technology. Frame relay is no longer covered 
directly as an objective in the Network+ exam, but the concepts involved in the tech- 
nology related to packet switching are still covered on the exam.

25 
At one time, X.25 was a popular standard for packet-switching networks, but new instal- 
lations are few and far between these days. Heavily used at one time, it is now slowly 
fading away. X.25 is a WAN protocol that operates at Layers 1, 2, and 3 of the OSI 
model. X.25 is very versatile, designed to operate in almost any environment. It was not 
as fast as other technologies, but added a very robust error-checking mechanism that 
virtually guaranteed error-free delivery of data. When network communications were 
carried on much poorer network media than we enjoy today, this was a very important 
protocol for WAN transmission.You can see an example of an X.25 WAN in Figure 7.4.

Although X.25 is a fading technology and not used too often anymore, the termi- 
nology that stems from it is, in fact, still widely in use. For instance, when viewing 
Figure 7.3, you will see terminology in use such as PSE (packet switching exchange), 
CPE, and DCE (data circuit-terminating equipment). 
When looking at an X.25 network, you will see that it is primarily made up of 
these three groupings: data terminal equipment (DTE), DCEs, and PSEs. The PSE is no 
different than the networks we talked about earlier--X.25 is a packet-switched type of 
network. The X.25 WAN switches facilitate the transfer within the carrier's network; 
this is essentially the PSE. 
Data terminal equipment devices are systems on your network that are not related 
to the WAN; DTEs are usually PCs, terminals, or other hosts found on your local net- 
work. DTE is not the responsibility of the carrier, however; DCEs usually are. 
DCE devices are communications devices, such as modems and Channel Service 
Unit/Data Service Unit's (CSUs/DSU), that provide the interface between DTE devices

and a PSE, and are normally located within the carriers' network, or can be onsite at the 
customer's premises, although the carrier still maintains responsibility for the device. 
As you can see, the terminology used for X.25 is used interchangeably with other 
network technologies. CSUs/DSUs, modems, PCs, terminals, and WAN-based packet 
switches are all common devices found when describing most WAN technologies found 
in use today. 
SONET 
Short for Synchronous Optical Network, SONET is an older, extremely high-speed 
network that provides a standard interface for communication carriers to connect net- 
works based on fiber optic cable. The SONET system uses fiber in dual counter-rotating 
rings. SONET is designed to handle multiple data types such as voice and video. The 
SONET standard defines a hierarchy of interface rates that allow data streams at different 
rates to be multiplexed (as shown in Table 7.1). SONET establishes OCx levels from 
51.8 Mbps to 40 Gbps. OCx is short for Optical Carrier <number>. The number 
denotes the level of speed that comes with that level of Optical Carrier. The base rate of 
OC-1 is 51.84 Mbps.

Internet Access Methods 
In this section we will look at Internet access technologies such as Digital Subscriber 
Line (DSL), cable, POTS (plain old telephone service)/PSTN (public switched tele- 
phone network), satellites, and wireless. 
DSL 
~ 
DSL is commonly seen as xDSL, where the x specifies what type of DSL is in use. DSL 
is commonly used to access the Internet from both residential and business locations to 
provide high-speed access to the Internet. DSL became very popular as dial-up tech-

nologies become increasingly unable to meet the demand for fast access to the Internet. 
Downloading MP3s, video files, and pictures has pretty much stretched the limitations 
(and life span) of dial-up to its very limits. DSL (and other high speed technologies) are 
slowly displacing dial-up service to the Internet. DSL is one of the most highly used 
because it can use preexisting phone lines in your home, so installation is a bit cheaper 
and less intrusive. 
One benefit of DSL is that it is not a shared medium, unlike cable networks, which 
use shared access. Shared access means that when there is heavy usage of the system, less 
bandwidth is available to individual users. DSL is dedicated bandwidth so the only one 
using that bandwidth is you. 
One drawback of DSL, however, is that the quality of service is dependent on the 
user's distance from the central office (CO). The CO is where the network endpoint is 
located, and is generally run by your ISE The farther you are from the CO, the worse 
(slower) the service is. 
There are many forms of DSL, although only a couple are commonly used.The most 
common forms of DSL are ADSL (Asymmetric DSL) and SDSL (Symmetric DSL) 
ADSL 
ADSL is the most widely deployed form of DSL technology. Most homes and small 
businesses currently using DSL technology use ADSL. ADSL is used to transmit digital 
information on preexisting phone lines. Although using the phone lines, it is still much 
quicker than dial-up, so don't be fooled. Also, unlike dial-up, ADSL provides an always on 
connection to the Internet. ADSL is also able to place voice and data information on the 
same line. 
The main design feature of ADSL is that is it asymmetric. This means that ADSL is 
designed to provide more bandwidth in one direction than in the other. The reason for 
this is quite practical; think of how much data you download from the Internet (every 
time you access a Web page, you are downloading). For most users, the amount of infor- 
mation that is uploaded is minimal, so in ADSL, bandwidth is allocated where it's 
needed (on the downstream channel). ADSL generates downstream speeds of about 8 
Mbps and upstream speeds of up to 640 Kbps. 
SDSL 
SDSL is typically used in larger companies, and the upstream and downstream channels 
are the same size; that is, the download speed and upload speed are equal. SDSL operates 
at about 2-2.5 Mbps. 

448 
Chapter 7 • WAN and Security Standards and Services 
'i ~ Other forms of DSL not covered by the exam, but worth researching are Very 
y High Speed Digital Subscriber Line (VDSL), High speed Digital Subscriber Line 
(HDSL), Symmetrical High Speed Digital Line Subscriber (SHDSL), ISDN Digital 
~iiiiii!~,~ Subscriber Line (IDSL) and HDSL-2 (HDSL 2 nd Generation). You will have to be 
~"~i~'®~' familiar with ADSL and SDSL not only for the exam, but also for your own use if 
you plan on working on DSL. These are the most commonly used types and will 
surely be something you will want to know about in more depth if the situation 
arises where you may be working with this technology. For the exam, you will 
need to know how to troubleshoot problems with DSL, although DSL itself may 
not be the problem. Look for misleading types of questions that ask you about 
DSL technology, although the questions are not essentially focused on that par- 
ticular technology. The Network+ exam is notorious for these types of scenario 
questions. Be able to isolate what the cause of a problem may be, whether it be 
an ISDN, DSL, or WISP (Wireless ISP) connection based on the technology and 
the underlying network~as well as problems may also be occurring there that 
are misleading you into the wrong answer. Finally, make sure that you 
remember that DSL and ISDN are both digital technologies, not analog. 
Broadband Cable 
Broadband cable access requires the use of a modem designed to operate over cable TV 
lines. Because the coaxial cable used by cable TV provides much greater bandwidth than 
telephone lines, a cable modem can be used to achieve extremely fast access to the 
World Wide Web (WWW). Cable modems are commonly used in small and home 
offices. Figure 7.5 shows a typical cable network setup.

Many cable providers are working diligently to provide the best access at the lowest 
cost, and to be less intrusive into your home or office. Cable networks provide a shared 
access to the users on the network, so heavy usage can slow it down, unlike DSL, which 
has dedicated user access. However, DSL has generally slower upload speeds than down- 
load speeds, unlike cable networks. Since cable networks do not use preexisting phone 
lines in the home, cable companies will have to install a line into your home (at an addi- 
tional cost) if one doesn't already exist. 
Cable networks provide speeds up to about 10 Mbps, which is much faster than 
ADSL, which usually ranges from 64 to 256 Kbps. Even with shared access, cable is 
often faster at most times. As the ISP's networks get cluttered, normally scheduled 
upgrades to the network will usually be conducted to solve those issues as they occur, or 
most times, proactively before they occur. 
Unfortunately, cable networks are not available everywhere yet. DSL has more avail- 
ability at this time than cable networks. 
~M 
WARNING 
I Some of the most common questions that you are likely to have to solve will be 
in the form of how to troubleshoot network devices or which one is better and 
faster than the other. Which one should you use and for what reasons? Refer to 
Chapters 11 and 12, which discuss how to troubleshoot networking devices. 
POTS / PSTN 
The term Public Switched Telephone Network refers to the international telephone 
system based on copper wires carrying analog voice data. Telephone service carried by 
the PSTN is often called plain old telephone service (POTS) which refers to the stan- 
dard telephone service that most homes use. When referring to either, we are generally 
referring to dial-up technologies where you would use a dial-up modem to connect to 
your ISP to get to the Internet. In Figure 7.6, you can see a standard dial-up session 
taking place so that a user can access the Internet through the telephone carrier's net- 
work from within his home. Refer to Table 7.2 for typical dial-modem speeds.

iiiiiiiiiiii! A few notes about Table 7.2: First, bis means second edition. Also, theoretically, 
!iiiiiiiiiiii an analog telephone line has a maximum speed of about 35 Kbps, so you can 
iiiiiiiiiii consider the V.90 modem to be the fastest, and since it can only receive, it's a 
..... '~iiiiiiii pretty good assumption that dial-up Internet access is going to be slow (in the 
Kbps range) and any faster speeds can only be reached by using other methods 
of Internet access such as DSL or cable. 
As mentioned before, the speeds for dial-up are not very fast (dialup does not pro- 
vide speeds above 56 Kbps). Try not to get confused between ISDN and dial-up. Both 
use dialing, but dial-up is based on the telephone system and use analog lines, whereas 
ISDN (and DSL) are both digital. For the Network+ exam, you will need to have a 
clear picture of each technology and its basics, and you must be able to differentiate 
between them.

Wireless 
Wireless ISPs ('WISPs) provide Internet access anywhere that it has coverage. Many loca- 
~------~ tions that have very little access to a good last mile source utilize this technology to 
connect to the Internet. Homes also use this very often to get Internet access.You can 
access the Internet from an antenna in your local PC, no matter where you are, as long 
as you can access an antenna and have a clear shot to the antenna you want to connect 
with. We will look at the most commonly used ways to access the Internet with a wire- 
less connection later in the chapter. Wireless is also covered extensively in Chapter 4, 
"Wireless Technologies." 
Satellite 
Satellite dishes are starting to gain popularity as a way to access the Internet. Many times 
(as is the case with cable), your carrier or ISP will provide you with television service, or 
some other form of service, so you can use the satellite dish for multiple purposes. Also, 
the dish is less intrusive into your home because it's mounted with very little need for 
wires or a run to a CO. Satellite is becoming a very convenient way to connect to the 
Internet without having any wires run into your home. 
Mobile and remote users (users who travel often and usually use a laptop) are 
starting to use satellite to access the Internet more frequently. These mobile users want 
to link their laptops to the Internet no matter where they are located. If you sign up 
with an ISP that uses satellite to provide Internet access, then you will be able to work 
through them to get the coverage plan you need. 
A typical satellite-based network is shown in Figure 7.7.A satellite is used to allow a 
user with a laptop, PDA (personal digital assistant), or PC with wireless satellite capabili- 
ties to connect to the Internet from anywhere within the coverage area. Figure 7.7 
shows the use of LEOs (low Earth orbit satellites) and MEOs (medium Earth orbit satel- 
lites). LEOs are primarily used with Internet-based satellite communications and are 
typically located about 1800 to 2000 miles above Earth. MEOs orbit at about 9,000 to 
10,000 miles above Earth. There are also GEOs (geosynchronous Earth orbits), which 
are typically used for the carrier's or ISP's trunk lines. GEOs orbit at about 22,000 to 
23,000 miles above Earth.All play an essential role in allowing you to access the Internet 
from lust about anywhere in the world. 
While satellite communications are often costly and slow, the ease of use and flexi- 
bility of wireless communications are always the same~slower, more costly, but flexible 
in use. Wireless systems and satellites are commonly used in geographical areas that are 
far from a CO or when extreme flexibility is needed.

Remote Access Protocols and Services 
In this section, we will discuss remote access protocols. Remote access protocols are used 
to help make connections from clients to servers when you want to work remotely and 
securely from your office.You can create a dial-in connection or connect directly over 
the Internet to your corporate office, authenticate to a server, and use your company's 
internal resources within minutes, all from the comfort of your home. For the 
Network+ exam you will need to know about the Remote Access Service (R_AS), pro- 
tocols such as PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol), SLIP (Serial Line Internet Protocol) and 
PPPoE (Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet), and what a VPN is as well as the 
Remote Desktop Protocol. 
RAS 
i 
Remote Access Service is a common method of allowing users of a corporate network 
to access network resources either from home or on the road. R_AS servers typically 
have an array of modems and dial-in lines available for users to connect through to the 
corporate network. They provide some form of authentication and then connect the 
user to the corporate network as if his or her system was physically located on the local 
area network (LAN). The authentication for RAS servers is typically done with 
Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP), Microsoft Challenge 
Handshake Authentication Protocol (MS-CHAP), Password Authentication Protocol 
(PAP), or Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP). CHAP and MS-CHAP are more 
secure than PAR as they do not send an actual password to the RAS server. EAP offers 

WAN and Security Standards and Services • Chapter 7 
453 
additional features in that it can be configured to accept a plethora of third-party 
authentication methods. This could include smart cards, Kerberos, or biometric authenti- 
cation. Most RAS servers also offer additional security features such as mandatory callback. 
This feature requires users to connect from a number the administrator has entered into 
the system. After initial connection and authentication, the server disconnects and dials 
the user's callback number. The user's system is then required to answer this call to com- 
plete the connection process. Some RAS servers use caller ID to identify the number 
the user is connecting from and then to either authorize the connection based on the 
number or log it. 
( 
TE 
RAS sometimes stands for Remote Access Server as well as Remote Access 
~Service. Also, Microsoft has implemented a new Management Console (begin- 
~~ ning with Windows 2000) called RRAS, which stands for Routing and Remote 
............... ~ Access Server. The console has a lot of routing and remote access management 
tools used for both technologies. 
R_AS is a feature built into Windows (and other operating systems) that enables users 
to log into a LAN using a modem or WAN link. R.AS works with several major net- 
work protocols, including TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol). 
  
SLIP 
Serial Line Internet Protocol is used to encapsulate data for transmission. Developed 
long ago and primarily used on UNIX systems, SLIP is rarely used now (PPP is typi- 
cally used instead). SLIP only works with IP, whereas PPP can use other protocols 
within its own suite to handle IPX/SPX (Internetwork Packet Exchange/Sequenced 
Packet Exchange), for example. PPP also works in Layer 3 of the OSI model. SLIP also 
requires static IP addressing, which makes it extremely cumbersome for wide use. 
  
PPP 
Point-to-Point Protocol is used to encapsulate data for transmission. PPP is more stable 
than the older SLIP protocol and provides error-checking features. Working in the Data 
Link Layer of the OSI model, PPP sends the computer's TCP/IP packets to a server that 
in turn sends the packets to the Internet. Additionally, PPP allows ISPs to use DHCP 
(Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) to assign addresses to clients accessing their 
networks, greatly expanding the ability of ISPs to provide service to more users.

454 
Chapter 7 • WAN and Security Standards and Services 
PPPoE 
Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet relies on two widely accepted standards" PPP and 
Ethernet. PPPoE is a specification for connecting the users on an Ethernet to the 
Internet through a common broadband medium, such as DSL or cable modem. 
What is a VPN? 
A VPN provides users with a secure method of connectivity through a public internet- 
~---~---~- work such as the Internet. Most companies use dedicated connections to connect to 
remote sites, but when users want to send private data over the Internet they should 
provide additional security by encrypting the data using a VPN. 
When a VPN is implemented properly, it provides improved wide area security, 
reduces costs associated with traditional WANs, improves productivity, and improves sup- 
port for users who telecommute. Cost savings are twofold. First, companies save money 
by using public networks (such as the Internet) instead of paying for dedicated circuits 
(such as point-to-point T1 circuits) between remote offices. Second, telecommuters do 
not have to pay long-distance fees to connect to RAS servers. They can simply dial into 
their local ISPs and create a virtual tunnel to the office. A tunnel is created by wrapping 
(or encapsulating) a data packet inside another data packet and transmitting it over a 
public medium. Tunneling requires three different protocols: 
• 
Carrier Protocol The protocol used by the network (IP on the Internet) 
that the information is traveling over. 
• 
Encapsulating Protocol The protocol, such as PPTP (Point-to-Point 
Tunneling Protocol), L2TP (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol), IPSec, or Secure 
Shell (SSH) that is wrapped around the original data. 
• 
Passenger Protocol The original data being carried. 
Essentially, there are two different types of VPNs: site-to-site and remote access. 
Site-to-Site VPN 
Site-to-site VPNs are normally established between corporate offices that are separated 
by a physical distance extending further than normal LAN media covers. VPNs are avail- 
able as software (such as Windows VPN, available on Windows NT and Windows 2000) 
and hardware (firewalls such as Nokia/Check Point and SonicWALL) implementations. 
Generally speaking, software implementations are easier to maintain. However, hardware 
implementations are considered more secure, since they are not impacted by operating 
system vulnerabilities. For example, suppose that Company XYZ has offices in Boston 
and Phoenix. As shown in Figure 7.8, both offices connect to the Internet via a T1 con- 
nection. They have implemented VPN-capable firewalls in both offices, and established 
an encryption tunnel between them.

The first step in creating a site-to-site VPN is selecting the security protocols to be 
used. Common protocols associated with VPN transmission security are PPTP, L2TP, 
SSH, and IPSec. 
PPTP and L2TP are used to establish a secure tunnel connection between two 
sites. Once a tunnel is established, encryption protocols are used to secure data passing 
through the tunnel. As data is passed from one VPN to another, it is encapsulated at the 
source and unwrapped at the destination. The process of establishing the VPN and wrap- 
ping and unwrapping the data is transparent to the end user. 
Most commercially available firewalls come with a VPN module that can be set up 
to easily communicate with another VPN-capable device. Microsoft has implemented 
site-to-site VPN tools on the Windows 2000 platform using either tLRAS or the newest 
rendition of Microsoft's Proxy server, Microsoft ISA Server 2004. Whichever product or 
service is used, it is important to ensure that each end of the VPN is configured with 
identical protocols and settings. 
.... ,~,~ 
i" '~ TE 
~)A 
common mistake that network security professionals make is setting up a 
site-to-site VPN, then disregarding other types of security. Access control (such 
as Windows NTFS permissions) should also be implemented so that users on 
0~ remote networks cannot access the local network freely.

Chapter 7 • WAN and Security Standards and Services 
Remote Access VPN 
A remote access VPN, known as a private virtual dial-up network (PVDN), differs from 
a site-to-site VPN in that end users are responsible for establishing the VPN tunnel 
between their workstation and their remote office.An alternative to connecting directly 
to the corporate VPN is connecting to an enterprise service provider (ESP) that ulti- 
mately connects users to the corporate VPN. 
In either case, users connect to the Internet or an ESP through a point of presence 
(POP) using their particular VPN client software (see Figure 7.9). Once the tunnel is 
set up, users are forced to authenticate with the VPN server, usually by username and 
password.

A remote access VPN is a great solution for a company with several employees 
working in the field. The remote access VPN allows these employees to transmit data to 
their home offices from any location. RRAS offers an easy solution for creating a 
remote access VPN. 
I!] ~L{~iivlE] The Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a Presentation Layer protocol that allows a 
Windows-based system to communicate with another Windows-based system remotely. 
RDP allows you to connect to a client computer and display and input data to that 
device. The technology is often used in Microsoft-based networks to remotely connect 
clients to terminal servers, and as an administrative tool to manage Windows servers.

2003. It was also added to Windows XP to provide the ability to remotely assist users 
having problems with their systems, as the protocol allows interactive desktop connec- 
tions to be established and may be used by technicians to remotely assist end users who 
are having difficulty with their machines. In the following exercise, you can set up an

Security Protocols 
For the Network+ exam, you will need to define, describe and identify how the fol- 
lowing security protocols function. In this section we will cover the most common of 
tunneling protocols: IPSec, and ISAKMR We will also cover other tunneling protocols 
such as PPTP and L2TR We will also look at SSH, an encrypted alternative to Telnet for 
remote access to hosts. Other security protocols covered are SSL for Web transactions, as 
well as initiatives to keep Wireless networking secure, such as WPA, WEP and 802.1x. 
IPSec 
The IPSec protocol, as defined by the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force), is "a 
framework of open standards for ensuring private, secure communications over Internet 
Protocol networks, through the use of cryptographic security services." This means that 
IPSec is a set of standards used for encrypting data so that it can pass securely through a 
public medium, such as the Internet. Unlike other methods of secure communications, 
IPSec is not bound to any particular authentication method or algorithm, which is why 

WAN and Security Standards and Services • 
Chapter 7 
459 
it is considered an open standard. Also, unlike older security standards that were imple- 
mented at the Application Layer of the OSI model, IPSec is implemented at the 
Network Layer. 
~ M WARNING 
i : Remember that IPSec is implemented at the Network Layer, not the 
I Application Layer. 
@ 
The advantage of IPSec being implemented at the Network Layer (versus the 
Application Layer) is that it is not application-dependent, meaning users do not have to 
configure each application to IPSec standards. IPSec can also be implemented in two 
different modes of operation: 
• 
Transport Mode IPSec implemented in transport mode (Figure 7.12) speci- 
fies that only the data (or payload) is encrypted during transfer. The advantage 
of this is speed~since the IP headers are not encrypted, the packets are 
smaller. The downside to transport mode is that a hacker can sniff the network 
and gather information about end parties. Transport mode is used in host-to- 
host VPNs (this provides connection and protection from end to end). 
• 
Tunnel Mode Unlike transport mode where only the data is encrypted, in 
tunnel mode (Figure 7.13) both the data and the IP headers are encrypted. 
The advantage is that neither the payload nor any information about end par- 
ties can be sniffed. The disadvantage is speed, since the size of the encrypted 
packet is larger. Tunnel mode is used in host-to-gateway or gateway-to-gateway 
VPNs (this protects the session, for example, between two ISPs or two touters, 
but does not provide protection from those points to the hosts involved in the 
network communication).

IPSec is made up of two separate security protocols. Authentication header (AH) 
protocol is responsible for maintaining the authenticity and integrity of the payload. AH 
authenticates packets by signing them, which ensures the integrity of the data. Since the 
signature is specific to the packet being transmitted, the receiver is assured of the data 
source. Signing packets also provides integrity, since the unique signature prevents the 
data from being modified. Encapsulating security payload (ESP) protocol also handles 
the authenticity and integrity of payloads, but also adds the advantage of data confiden- 
tiality through encryption. AH and ESP can be used together or separately. If used 
together, the entire packet is authenticated. It is also important to note that since AH 
signs the packet with its original IP address, most implementations of Network Address 
Translation (NAT) will change the packer's address and cause failure of the AH authenti- 
cation mechanism. ESP encrypts the entire packet and adds a new IP header, which is 
not subject to the same rejection due to change in a NAT process. 
~''~N :°' " 
DAY TIP 
An easy way to remember the difference between AH and ESP is to use the E in 
ESP to remember encryption. 
IPSec Authentication 
To ensure the integrity of data being transmitted using IPSec, there has to be a mecha- 
nism in place to authenticate end users and manage secret keys. This mechanism is called 
Internet Key Exchange (IKE). IKE is used to authenticate the two ends of a secure 
tunnel by providing a secure exchange of a shared key before IPSec transmissions begin. 
For IKE to work, both parties must use a password known as a pre-shared key. 
During IKE negotiations, both parties swap a hashed version of a pre-shared key. When 
www.syngress.com 

WAN and Security Standards and Services • Chapter 7 
461 
they receive the hashed data, they attempt to recreate it. If they successfully recreate the 
hash, both parties can begin secure communications. 
IPSec also has the ability to use digital signatures. A digital signature is a certificate 
signed by a trusted third party called a certificate authority (CA) that offers authentica- 
tion and non-repudiation, meaning the sender cannot deny that the message came from 
him or her. Without a digital signature, one party can easily deny he or she was respon- 
sible for messages sent. 
Although public key cryptology (user A generates a random number and encrypts it 
with user B's public key, and user B decrypts it with his private key [described in Chapter 
10]) can be used in IPSec, it does not offer non-repudiation. The most important factor 
to consider when choosing an authentication method is that both parties must agree on the 
method chosen. IPSec uses an SA (security association) to describe how parties will use 
AH and encapsulating security payload to commlanicate. The security association can be 
established through manual intervention or by using the Internet Security Association 
and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP). The Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol, 
described in detail in Chapter 9, is used for secure exchange of pre-shared keys. 
ISAKMP 
The advantage of using IKE over the manual method is that the SA can be established 
when needed, and can be set to expire after a certain amount of time. RFC 2408 
describes ISAKMP as a framework for establishing, negotiating, modifying, and deleting 
security associations between two parties. By centralizing the management of security 
associations, ISAKMP reduces the amount of duplicated functionality within each secu- 
rity protocol. ISAKMP also reduces the amount of time required for communications 
setup, by negotiating all of the services at once. 
PPTP/L2TP 
As mentioned earlier, there are several standard tunneling protocol technologies in use 
today. Two of the most popular are PPTP and L2TP, which are Layer 2 (Data Link 
Layer) encapsulation (tunneling) protocols using ports 1723 and 1701, respectively. 
However, PPTP and L2TP do use different transport protocols: PPTP uses TCP and 
L2TP uses UDP (User Datagram Protocol).

PPTP 
PPTP's popularity is mainly due to the fact that it was the first encapsulation protocol 
on the market, designed by engineers at Microsoft. Thus it is supported in all Windows 
operating systems (L2TP is not supported in Windows 9x/ME or NT 4.0, although 
these OSs (except Windows 95) can create L2TP connections using the Microsoft 
L2TP/IPSec VPN client add-on. PPTP establishes point-to-point connections between 
two computers by encapsulating the PPP packets being sent. Although PPTP has helped 
improve communications security, there are several issues with it. 
• 
PPTP encrypts the data being transmitted, but does not encrypt the informa- 
tion being exchanged during negotiation. In Microsoft implementations, 
Microsoft Point-to-Point Encryption (MPPE) protocol is used to encrypt the 
data. 
• 
PPTP is protocol-restrictive, meaning it will only work over IP networks. 
• 
PPTP cannot use the added benefit of IPSec.

L2TP 
As with TACACS+ (Terminal Access Controller Access Control System +), Cisco 
believed they could design a better tunneling protocol, which was the creation of the 
Layer 2 Forwarding (L2F) protocol. Unfortunately, L2F was not much better than PPTP. 
Specifically, L2F provided encapsulation (tunneling), but it did not encrypt the data 
being encapsulated. 
To use the features of both PPTP and L2E L2TP was developed through a joint 
venture between Microsoft and Cisco. L2TP was a major improvement, but still did not 
offer encryption. To remedy this, L2TP was designed to use IPSec for encryption pur- 
poses. The differences between PPTP and L2TP that you need to know for the 
Network+ exam are: 
• 
L2TP requires IPSec in order to offer encryption. 
• 
L2TP offers RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) and 
TACACS+, where PPTP does not. 
• 
L2TP is often implemented as a hardware solution, while PPTP is not. 
• 
L2TP can run on top of protocols such as IP, IPX, and SNA (Systems 
Network Architecture), while PPTP can work only on IP networks. 
• 
Using L2TP with IPSec provides per-packet data origin authentication (proof 
that the data was sent by an authorized user), data integrity (proof that the data 
was not modified in transit), replay protection (prevention from resending a 
stream of captured packets), and data confidentiality (prevention from inter- 
preting captured packets without an encryption key). 
• 
L2TP/IPSec connections require two levels of authentication: computer-level 
authentication using certificates or pre-shared keys for IPSec sessions, and user- 
level authentication using PPP authentication protocol for the L2TP tunnel. 
Some advantages of the L2TP/IPSec combination over PPTP are: 
www.syngress.com 

WAN and Security Standards and Services • Chapter 7

• 
IPSec provides per-packet data origin, data integrity, replay protection, and data 
confidentiality. In contrast, PPTP only provides per-packet data confidentiality. 
• 
L2TP/IPSec connections require two levels of authentication: computer-level 
authentication and user-level authentication. 
PPP flames exchanged during user-level authentication are never sent unen- 
crypted because the PPP connection process for L2TP/IPSec occurs after the 
IPSec security association is established. 
SSH 
Developed by SSH Communications Security Ltd., secure shell is a program used to log 
into another computer over a network, to execute commands in a remote machine, and to 
move files from one machine to another. It provides strong authentication and secure 
communications over insecure channels. It is a replacement for rlogin, rsh, rcp, and rdist, 
which are all UNIX-based protocols used for remote management of the system. SSH 
protects a network from attacks such as IP spoofing, IP source routing, and DNS spoofing. 
An attacker who has managed to take over a network can only force SSH to disconnect. 
SSH is a cryptographically secure replacement for standard Telnet, rlogin, rsh, and rcp 
commands. SSH consists of both a client and a server that use public key cryptography to 
provide session encryption. It also provides the ability to forward arbitrary ports over an 
encrypted connection. 
SSH has received wide acceptance as the secure mechanism for access to remote sys- 
tems interactively. SSH was conceived and developed by Finnish developer, TatuYlonen. 
When the original version of SSH became a commercial venture, the license became 
more restrictive. A public specification was created, resulting in development of a 
number of versions of SSH-compliant client and server software that do not contain the 
restrictions (most significantly, those that restrict commercial use). 
SSH deals with the confidentiality and integrity of information being passed between 
a client and host. Since programs such as Telnet and rlogin transmit usernames and pass- 
words in cleartext, sniffing a network is easy, and it's incredibly important that such data is 
encrypted. By beginning an encrypted session before the username and password are trans- 
mitted, confidentiality is guaranteed. SSH protects the integrity of the data being trans- 
mitted by the use of session keys. The client keeps a list of user keys for servers with which 
it previously established secure sessions. If the key matches, the secure session is established 
and the integrity of the data being transmitted is confirmed. Using SSH helps protect 
against different types of attacks including packet sniffing, IP spoofing, and manipulation of 
data by unauthorized users. 
How SSH Works 
When a client wants to establish a secure session with a host, the client initiates commu- 
nication by requesting an SSH session. Once the server receives the request from the

client, the two perform a handshake, which includes the verification of the protocol ver- 
sion. Next, session keys are exchanged between the client and server. Once session keys 
have been exchanged and verified against a cache of host keys, the client can begin the 
secure session. Figure 7.17 depicts the SSH authentication process.

SSL and HTTPS 
SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is a public key-based protocol that was developed by 
Netscape and is supported by all popular Web browsers. It is widely used on the Internet 
for Web transactions such as sending credit card data. It can be utilized for other proto- 
cols as well, such as Telnet, FTP (File Transfer Protocol), LDAP (Lightweight Directory 
Access Protocol), Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP), and Simple Mail Transfer 
Protocol (SMTP), but these are not commonly used. Transport Layer Security (TLS), on 
the other hand, is an open IETF-proposed standard based on SSL 3.0. RFCs (Requests 
for Comments) 2246, 2712, 2817, and 2818 define TLS.The name is misleading, since 
TLS happens well above the Transport Layer. The two protocols are not interoperable, 
but TLS has the capability to drop down into SSL 3.0 mode for backward compatibility, 
and both can provide security for a single TCP session. 
SSL and TLS provide a connection between a client and a server, over which any 
amount of data can be sent securely. Both the server and browser generally must be SSL- 
or TLS-enabled to facilitate secure Web connections, while applications generally must 
be SSL- or TLS-enabled to allow their use of the secure connection. However, a recent 
trend is to use dedicated SSL accelerators as VPN terminators, passing the content on to 
an end server. The Cisco CSS Secure Content Accelerator 1100 is an example of this 
technique. 
For the browser and server to communicate securely, each must have the shared ses- 
sion key. SSL and TLS use public key encryption to exchange session keys during com- 
munication initialization. When a browser is installed on a workstation, it generates a 
unique private/public key pair. 
HTTPS is simply HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) over SSL. HTTPS is the 
protocol responsible for encryption of traffic from a client browser to a Web server. 
HTTPS uses port 443 instead of HTTP port 80. 
When a U1KL begins with "https://," you know you are using HTTPS. Both 
HTTPS and SSL use a X.509 digital certificate for authentication purposes from the 
client to the server. For highly detailed information about SSL and HTTPS, visit 
Netscape's website at http://wp.netscape.com/eng/ssl3/ssl-toc.html. 
..] ~ M WARNING 
~ SSL must be understood for the Network+ exam. Remember key items like the 
I port it uses (443) and its basic functionality. 
O 
SSL suffers from security vulnerabilities caused by small key sizes, expired certifi- 
cates, and other weaknesses that can plague any public key implementation. Many 
servers running SSL on the Internet are still using an older, flawed version (SSLv2), or 
they use 40-bit encryption, or their certificates are expired or self-signed. 

468 
Chapter 7 • WAN and Security Standards and Services 
S-HTTP 
It is important not to confuse HTTPS with Secure HTTP (S-HTTP).Although they 
sound alike, they are two separate protocols, used for different purposes. S-HTTP is not 
widely used, but it was developed by Enterprise Integration Technologies (EIT) to pro- 
vide security for Web-based applications. Secure HTTP is an extension to the HTTP 
protocol. It is a secure message-oriented communications protocol that can transmit 
individual messages securely (whereas SSL establishes a secure connection over which 
any amount of data can be sent). S-HTTP provides transaction confidentiality, authenti- 
cation, and message integrity, and extends HTTP to include tags for encrypted and 
secure transactions. S-HTTP is implemented in some commercial Web servers and most 
browsers. An S-HTTP server negotiates with the client for the type of encryption that 
will be used, several types of which exist. 
Unlike SSL, S-HTTP does not require clients to have public key certificates because 
it can use symmetric keys to provide private transactions. The symmetric keys are pro- 
vided in advance using out-of-band communication. 
  
WEP 
-
-
 
The IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers) 802.• 1 standard covers the 
communication between WLAN (wireless local area network) components. P,.F poses 
challenges to privacy in that it travels through and around physical objects. Because of 
the nature of the 802.11 wireless LANs, the IEEE working group implemented a mech- 
anism to protect the privacy of the individual transmissions, known as the WEP (Wired 
Equivalent Privacy) protocol. Because WEP utilizes a cryptographic security counter- 
measure for the fulfillment of its stated goal of privacy, it has the added benefit of 
becoming an authentication mechanism. This benefit is realized through a shared-key 
authentication that allows for encryption and decryption of wireless transmissions. Up to 
four keys can be defined on an access point (AP) or a client, and they can be rotated to 
add complexity for a higher security standard in the WLAN policy. 
WEP was never intended to be the absolute authority in wireless security. The IEEE 
802.11 standard states that WEP provides for protection from casual eavesdropping. 
Instead, the driving force behind WEP was privacy. In cases that require high degrees of 
security, other mechanisms should be utilized such as authentication, access control, pass- 
word protection, and VPNs. 
Despite its flaws, WEP still offers a level of security provided that all of its features 
are used properly. This means taking great care in key management, avoiding default 
options, and ensuring adequate encryption is enabled at every opportunity. 
Proposed improvements in the 802.11 standard should overcome many of the limi- 
tations of the original security options, and should make WEP more appealing as a secu- 
rity solution.Additionally, as WLAN technology gains popularity and users clamor for 
functionality, both the standards committees and the hardware vendors will offer 
improvements. It is critically important to keep abreast of vendor-related software fixes 
and changes that improve the overall security posture of a wireless LAN.

:i! ~ ~i ......... ~~ 
i 
AM WARNING 
~~ Most APs advertise that they support WEP in 40-bit encryption, but often the 
~ 
128-bit option is also supported. For corporate networks, 128-bit encryption- 
capable devices should be considered as a minimum. 
@ 
With data security enabled in a closed network, the settings on the client for the 
service set identifier (SSID) and the encryption keys must match the AP when 
attempting to associate with the network or it will fail. 
WEP provides security and privacy in transmissions held between the AP and the 
clients. To gain access, an intruder must be more sophisticated and have specific intent to 
gain access. Some of the other benefits of implementing WEP include the following: 
• 
All messages are encrypted using a CRC-32 (cyclic redundancy check-32) 
checksum to provide some degree of integrity. 
• 
Privacy is maintained via 1LC4 encryption. Without possession of the secret 
key, the message cannot be easily decrypted. 
• 
WEP is extremely easy to implement. All that is required is to set the encryp- 
tion key on the APs and on each client. 
• 
WEP provides a basic level of security for WLAN applications. 
• 
WEP keys are user-definable and unlimited. WEP keys can, and should, be 
changed often. 
Chapter 4 covers Wireless technologies and WEP in depth. 
WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) 
For the Network+ exam you will need to know about another form of wireless security 
- 
---1 called WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access), created by the Wi-Fi Alliance. WPA is a tech- 
nology that was created to help overcome the limitations of WEP. The way it does this is 
by using a technology called Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP). TKIP is a pro- 
tocol used to add more encryption benefits to wireless transmissions to include a mes- 
sage integrity check. Since using TKIP eliminates all known vulnerabilities to WEP, 
there really should be no reason to even use WEP at this point if you can use WPA. 
www.syngress.com 

470 
Chapter 7 • WAN and Security Standards and Services 
Another great benefit of WPA is that it uses authentication protocols such as EAP 
and 802.1x (both explained shortly) to allow for a central authentication method based 
on a RADIUS server as an example. 
802.1x 
In Chapter 4, users will become familiar with wireless local area networks and the IEEE 
802.11 standard for wireless networking. It is so simple to implement wireless net- 
working technology that most novice users can install it themselves. What most users do 
not realize is that as soon as they transmit their first piece of data across the new net- 
work they have opened up a can of worms! 
This is where the 802.1x standard enters. 802.1x is a WEP protocol designed to 
enhance the level of security offered on a WLAN. 
%~!~iiiii~ii iii~ ..... The argument can be made that wireless technologies are part of a LAN, not a 
~iiiiiiiiiii!ii~"= remote access technology. For the Network+ exam, think of wireless as being a

III~'~,', 
l a pto p o r P DA. 
When a wireless user (or supplicant) wants to access a wireless network, 802.1x forces 
him or her to authenticate to a centralized authority called an authenticator. 802.1x uses 
the Extensible Authentication Protocol for passing messages between the supplicant and 
the authenticator. When communication begins, the authenticator places the user into 
an unauthorized state. While in this unauthorized state, the only messages that can be 
transmitted are EAP start messages. At this point, the authenticator sends a request to the 

WAN and Security Standards and Services • Chapter 7 
471 
user asking for his or her identity. The client then returns his or her identity to the 
authenticator, which in turn forwards it to the authentication server, which is running an 
authentication service such as RADIUS. 
The authentication server authenticates the user and either accepts or rejects the 
user based on the credentials provided. If the user provides the correct credentials, the 
authenticator changes the user's state to authorized, thus allowing the user to move freely 
within the WLAN. Figure 7.19 depicts how the authentication process works.

Identifying Authentication Protocols 
Applying authentication protocols such as CHAP, Kerberos, RADIUS and/or EAP are 
common in today's network environment. For the Network+ exam, you will be 
expected to be able to identify different authentication protocols. The process of authen- 
tication is a security measure used to verify the identity of a person, process, or host 
trying to access a system. For example; authentication protocols handle the identification 
process. 
CHAP 
One of the methods that can be used protect information when using remote access to 
a resource is the Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol. CHAP is a remote 
access authentication protocol used in conjunction with PPP to provide security and 
authentication to users of remote resources.You will recall that PPP replaced the older 
Serial Line Internet Protocol. PPP not only allows for more security than SLIP, but also 
does not require static addressing to be defined for communication. PPP allows users to 
use dynamic addressing and multiple protocols during communication with a remote 
host. CHAP is described in 1KFC 1994, available at www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1994.html. The 
IKFC describes a process of authentication that works in the following manner" 
r 
www.syngress.com 
b,= 
~1 

472 
Chapter 7 • WAN and Security Standards and Services 
CHAP is used to periodically verify the identity of the peer using a three-way 
handshake. This is done upon initial link establishment, and may be repeated anytime 
after the link has been established. 
1. 
After the link establishment phase is complete, the authenticator sends a chal- 
lenge message to the peer. 
2. 
The peer responds with a value calculated using a one-way hash function. 
3. 
The authenticator checks the response against its own calculation of the 
expected hash value. If the values match, the authentication is acknowledged; 
otherwise the connection should be terminated. 
4. 
At random intervals, the authenticator sends a new challenge to the peer, and 
repeats steps 1 to 3. 
CHAP operates in conjunction with PPP to provide protection of the credentials 
presented for authentication and to verify connection to a valid resource. It does not 
operate with encrypted password databases, and therefore is not as strong a protection as 
other levels of authentication. The shared secrets may be stored on both ends as a clear- 
text item, making the secret vulnerable to compromise or detection. CHAP may also be 
configured to store a password using one-way reversible encryption, which uses the one- 
way hash noted earlier. This provides protection to the password, because the hash must 
match the client wishing to authenticate with the server that has stored the password 
with the hash value. CHAP is better than Password Authentication Protocol, however, 
since PAP sends passwords across the network in cleartext. 
MS-CHAP 
Microsoft created its own extensions for CHAP and called it MS-CHAP. This protocol 
is not standardized, but is widely used in Microsoft Windows deployments. Its current 
version, (MS-CHAPv2) is an enhancement that allows a client to change his or her 
account password if it has expired on the RADIUS server. MS-CHAP is only as secure 
as the passwords that users choose, and this is basically why it's still not entirely a secure 
protocol to use in the enterprise. 
  
PAP 
PAP is the simplest form of authentication you can use. PAP is the weakest when it

_
_
_
_

_ 
comes to security, but the simplest in terms of use and overhead. A PAP authentication 
message will contain user credentials (such as your password). Since PAP is very weak 
when it comes to security, the password is sent in cleartext and is vulnerable to any 
packet sniffer attempting to intercept it. 
Because of its inherent weaknesses, PAP should never be used.

473 
Kerberos 
Kerberos (currently Kerberos v5) is used as the preferred network authentication pro- 
tocol in many medium and large environments to authenticate users and services 
requesting access to resources. Kerberos is a network protocol designed to centralize the 
authentication information for the user or service requesting the resource. This allows 
authentication of the entity requesting access (user, machine, service, or process) by the 
host of the resource being accessed through the use of secure and encrypted keys and 
tickets (authentication tokens) from the authenticating Key Distribution Center (KDC). It 
allows for cross-platform authentication, and will be available in upcoming implementa- 
tions of various network operating systems. Kerberos is very useful in the distributed 
computing environments currently used because it centralizes the processing of creden- 
tials for authentication. Kerberos utilizes time stamping of its tickets to help ensure they 
are not compromised by other entities, and uses an overall structure of control that is 
called a realm. Some platforms use the defined terminology, while others such as 
Windows 2000 use their domain structure to implement the Kerberos concepts. 
Kerberos is described in RFC 1510, available on the Web at 
www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1510.txt. Developed and owned by the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology (MIT), information about the most current and previous releases of 
Kerberos is available on the Web at http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/www/ 
Let's look at how the Kerberos process works and how it helps secure authentication 
activities in a network. First, let's look at Figure 7.20, which shows the default compo- 
nents of a Kerberos v5 realm:

There is an authentication server requirement (the KDC). In a Kerberos realm, 
whether in a UNIX-based or Windows-based OS, the authentication process is the 
same. For this purpose, imagine that a client needs to access a resource on the resource 
server. Look at Figure 7.21 as we proceed to follow the path for the authentication, first 
for logon, then at Figure 7.22 for the resource access path.

As shown in Figure 7.21, two events are occurring as credentials are presented (pass- 
word, Smart Card, biometrics) to the KDC for authentication. First, the authentication 
credential is presented to the KDC. Second, the KDC issues a ticket granting ticket 
(TGT) that is associated with the access token while you are actively logged in and 
authenticated. This TGT expires when you (or the service) disconnect or log off the 
network. This TGT is cached locally for use during the active session. 
Figure 7.22 shows the process for resource access in a Kerberos realm. It starts by 
presenting the previously granted TGT to the authenticating KDC. The authenticating 
KDC returns a session ticket to the entity wishing access to the resource. This session 
ticket is then presented to the remote resource server. The remote resource server, after 
accepting the session ticket, allows the session to be established to the resource.

Resource Server or Storage 
Kerberos uses a time stamp and we need to understand where and when the time 
stamp is used. Previously mentioned was the concept of non-repudiation, which is one 
reason for the use of the time stamps. In the case of Kerberos, the time stamp is also used 
to limit the possibility of replay or spoofing of credentials. Replay is the capture of informa- 
tion, modification of the captured information, and retransmission of the modified infor- 
mation to the entity waiting to receive the communication. If unchecked, this allows for 
impersonation of credentials when seeking access. Spoofing is the substitution of 
addressing or authentication information to try to attain access to a resource based on 
information acceptable to the receiving host, but not truly owned by the sender. The ini- 
tial time stamp refers to any communication between the entity requesting authentication 
and the KDC. Normally, this initial time period will not be allowed to exceed five min- 
utes. If clocks are not synchronized between the systems, the credentials (tickets) will not 
be granted if the time differential exceeds the established limits. Session tickets from the 
KDC to a resource must be presented within this time period or they will be discarded. 
The session established between the resource server and the requesting entity is also time- 
stamped, but generally lasts as long as the entities' logon credentials are valid. This can be 
affected by system policies like logon hour restrictions, which are defined in the original 
access token. TGT tickets are not part of the default five-minute period. Rather, they are 
cached locally on the machine and are valid for the duration of the session.

Chapter 7 • WAN and Security Standards and Services 
RADIUS 
Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service was originally designed as a way to 
authenticate external users who were dialing in to a company (hence the name). Over 
the years enhancements have been made to include different types of authentication 
inside the LAN (firewalls, VPNs, authentication, etc.) RADIUS is designed to carry 
authentication, authorization, and configuration information between a network device 
that requires authentication and an authentication server. 
As noted in the discussion about 802.1x, users need a centralized entity to handle 
authentication. Initially, RADIUS was created by Livingston Enterprises to handle dial- 
in authentication. Then its usage broadened into wireless authentication and VPN 
authentication. RADIUS is the most popular of all the authentication, authorization, and 
accounting (AAA) servers, including TACACS, TACACS +, and DIAMETE1K. An R_AS 
must be able to authenticate a user, authorize the authenticated user to perform speci- 
fied functions, and log (that is, account for) the actions of users for the duration of the 
connection. 
When users dial into a network, RADIUS is used to authenticate usernames and 
passwords. A RADIUS server can either work alone or in a distributed environment 
(known as distributed RADIUS) where RADIUS servers are configured in a tiered (hier- 
archical) structure. 
In a distributed RADIUS environment, a RADIUS server forwards the authentica- 
tion request to an enterprise RADIUS server using a protocol called proxy RADIUS. 
The enterprise RADIUS server handles verification of user credentials and responds 
back to the service provider's RADIUS server. 
One of the reasons that RADIUS is so popular is that it supports a number of pro- 
tocols including: 
• 
Point-to-Point Protocol 
• 
Password Authentication Protocol 
• 
Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol 
Authentication Process 
RADIUS authentication consists of five steps: 
1. 
Users initiate a connection with an ISP R_AS or corporate R_AS. Once a con- 
nection is established, users are prompted for a username and password. 
2. 
The RAS encrypts the username and password using a shared secret, and passes 
the encrypted packet to the RADIUS server. 
3. 
The RADIUS server attempts to verify the user's credentials against a central- 
ized database. 

WAN and Security Standards and Services • 
Chapter 7 
477 
4. 
If the credentials match those found in the database, the server responds with 
an access-accept message. If the username does not exist or the password is incor- 
rect, the server responds with an access-reject message. 
5. 
The R_AS then accepts or rejects the message and grants the appropriate rights. 
Vulnerabilities 
Certain flavors of RADIUS servers and Web servers can be compromised by buffer-over- 
flow attacks. A buffer-overflow attack occurs when a buffer is flooded with more infor- 
mation than it can hold. The extra data overflows into other buffers, which may be 
accessible to hackers. 
TACACS/+ 
RADIUS is not the only centralized RAS.TACACS is also used in authenticating 
remote users. TACACS has gone through three major generations: TACACS, XTA- 
CACS, and TACACS+. For the Network+ exam, you need to know about TACACS 
and TACACS+; however, for continuity purposes, XTACACS will also be discussed. 
www.syngress.com 

478 
Chapter 7 • WAN and Security Standards and Services 
TACACS 
TACACS is the "old man" of centralized remote access authentication. TACACS was 
first developed during the days of (ARPANET), which was the basis for the Internet. 
TACACS is detailed in RFC 1492, which can be found at www.cis.ohio-state.edu/cgi- 
bin/rfc/rfc 1492.html. Although TACACS offers authentication and authorization, it does 
not offer any accounting tools. As mentioned earlier, a good RAS must fit all the criteria 
of the AAA model. Similar to RADIUS, a dial-up user connects to a RAS that prompts 
the user for their credentials. The credentials are then passed to the TACACS server, 
which either permits or denies access to the network. 
TACACS + 
Cisco decided to develop a proprietary version of TACACS known as TACACS+.The 
driving factor behind TACACS+ was to offer networking professionals the ability to 
manage all remote access components from a centralized location. TACACS+ is also 
credited with separating the AAA functions. TACACS+ is considered proprietary 
because its packet formats are completely different from those in TACACS or XTA- 
CACS, making TACACS+ incompatible with previous versions. Unlike previous ver- 
sions of TACACS that used one database for all AAA functions, TACACS+ uses 
individual databases for each. TACACS+ was the first revision to offer secure communi- 
cations between the TACACS+ client and the TACACS+ server. Like XTACACS, 
TACACS+ uses TCP as its transport.TACACS+ continues to gain popularity because it 
is easy to implement and reasonably priced. 
XTACACS 
Initially, TACACS utilized the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) to handle communica- 
tions. The problem with UDP is that it does not provide packet sequencing. Therefore, 
services such as TACACS must make sure that the entire message has arrived and is 
intact. To overcome this shortcoming, Cisco Systems developed Extended TACACS (or 
XTACACS). In XTACACS, the transport protocol was changed from UDP to 
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), ensuring that messages would be divided into 
packets and reassembled when received at the intended destination. XTACACS was a 
step in the right direction, but it did not provide all of the functionality needed for a 
centralized remote access authentication solution. 
i!ii!i~ XTACACS is rarely deployed in modern installations, and is not a topic of the 
ii~ii}!iilii!ili Network+ exam.

EAP 
EAP was originally defined under 1KFC 2284 and then redefined under the IETF 
Internet draft dated September 13, 2002. EAP is an authentication protocol designed to 
support several different authentication mechanisms. It runs directly over the Data Link 
Layer and does not require the use of IP. 
EAP comes in several different forms" 
• 
EAP over IP (EAPolP) 
• 
Message Digest Algorithm/Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol 
(EAP-MD5-CHAP) 
• 
Transport Layer Security (EAP-TLS) 
• 
Tunneled Transport Layer Security (EAP-TTLS) 
• 
RADIUS 
• 
Light Extensible Authentication Protocol (LEAP) Cisco 
Each form of EAP has its own characteristics, but for the purpose of the Network+ 
exam you will only need to know what it is and its different formats.

Summary of Exam Objectives 
In this chapter we covered the Network+ exam objectives based around Wide Area 
Networking technologies such as packet switching, which is the always on type of net- 
work, and circuit switching, which is a type of network that has to be created each time 
it is used (such as ISDN). We also covered the fundamentals of ISDN, which is a digital 
method of transmitting data across copper telephone lines, using service provider ID 
numbers (also called SPIDS) to connect the network (circuit switched) for the sending 
and receiving of data. We ~overed the fundamentals of Frame Relay, MPLS, X.25 and 
SONET as well as T- and E-level carrier lines. 
We discussed the primary ways to get Internet access, such as with DSL. DSL is a 
digital method of transmitting data over preexisting copper telephone lines. ADSL is a 
technology that allows for faster download speeds. DSL speeds also vary depending on 
how far from the central office you are. Cable-based ISPs were also covered, which is 
generally faster than DSL, but can also become congested if too many subscribers use' 
the shared media all at once. Both are far better when it comes to speed and use than 
POTS or PSTN. The dial-up method of access using a standard modem is the slowest 
method of access. Satellite and wireless technologies were also discussed; they afford you 
the flexibility of use over speed and security. 
We also defined the function and use of remote access protocols and services such as 
VPNs. A VPN is a secure connection created over an insecure network such as the 
Internet. Protocols used to encapsulate and sometimes secure transmissions include PPR 
SLIR PPPoE, PPTP, and R.DR Other security protocols covered were L2TP (a more 
secure version of PPTP), SSL, which helps to secure HTTR as well as wireless security 
technologies such as WEP and WPA.

V¢l Normal telephone service is based on circuit-switching technology, in which a 
dedicated line is allocated for transmission between two parties and the circuit 
is brought up when needed. Circuit switching is ideal when data must be 
transmitted quickly and must arrive in the same order in which it's sent. Packet 
switching is more efficient and robust for data that can withstand some delays 
in transmission.

6. As a network manager for your company's high-speed network, you are looking to 
implement a new line from a remote site (Chicago) to the company's core hub 
(New York) where the mainframe is located. The mainframe is where all the com- 
paw's sales orders are placed daily. The hub site is where all sites get their Internet 
access from, and where they upload and download files to and from. Connection to 
this mainframe 24 hours a day is essential to meeting the business plan.You have just 
heard from your systems engineer that users are no longer able to access the main- 
flame from the remote sites; the users at the core site are still able to access the main- 
flame. Within minutes the connection is restored and all users are able to access the 
mainframe once more. From careful analysis you uncover that during the time that 
the remote users were not able to access the mainframe, one user had been down-

Chapter 8 • Network Operating Systems 
Introduction 
In this chapter, we will examine the underlying concepts of a network operating system 
(NOS). Network operating systems have existed in one form or another for several 
decades. An NOS is designed to provide centralized resource sharing that can be 
installed on a high-powered server, so that these resources can be accessed by multiple 
clients over a network connection. This provides a cost savings for organizations that 
deploy an NOS, because they can purchase high-powered equipment for only a few 
central servers running an NOS, and use lower-powered desktop hardware for client 
computers. Using an NOS also increases productivity for an organization by storing 
important data and resources centrally, rather than forcing users to keep multiple copies 
of documents on their local hard drives or to manually transmit files from one person to 
another using floppy disks. The first network operating system was the UNIX operating 
system used by many universities and research organizations. This was followed by 
Novell NetWare in the mid-1980's as one of the first NOSs that gained popularity for 
commercial use. Microsoft came onto the NOS scene much later, first with Windows 
for Workgroups and later with Windows NT, and then Windows 2000 and Windows 
Server 2003. 
We will then look at what is required for a client computer to be able to connect to 
a network server to access shared resources, both for local area network (LAN) connec- 
tions as well as remote access connections. In addition, we will examine several hardware 
tools that are available to assist you in installing and troubleshooting network cabling. 
Lt=  Identifying the Basic Capabilities 
of Network Operating Systems 
The primary function of a network operating system is to provide file and print sharing 
and a centralized user database. In addition, most NOSs provide support for applications 
like e-mail and Web services. A modern NOS will also be heavily concerned with secu- 
rity, ensuring that only authorized users and groups can gain access to the resources 
stored on the server that's running the network operating system. In the following sec- 
tions, we'll examine four of the more popular network operating systems on the market 
today: Microsoft Windows, Novell NetWare, Linux, and Mac OS X Server. 
Microsoft Windows 
U 
Windows NT 4.0, the first true network operating system offered by Microsoft, found 
its beginnings in the early 1990's. Windows NT supported both peer-to-peer and 
domain-based networks, and comes in two distinct versions: 
A workstation version designed to be used primarily as a client operating 
system. 
www.syngress.com 

Network Operating Systems • Chapter 8 
495 
• 
A server version that can operate as a standalone file/print server or as a cen- 
tralized authentication server (called a domain controller in Microsoft networking 
terminology). 
Unlike earlier versions of Windows like Windows 3.1 and Windows 95, Windows 
NT is multithreaded and can support symmetric multiprocessing (SMP), which allows 
you to increase the performance of an application by adding more processors (if the 
application was written to support multiple processors). Windows NT was built with 
stability and security in mind. 32-bit applications run in their own separate memory 
spaces, and older Windows 3.x and DOS applications run in virtual machines. Thus, the 
failure of an application cannot bring down the entire OS~the reason why 9x 
machines crash more frequently and have to be rebooted more often than NT machines 
do. One of the means by which NT remains more stable is by restricting applications 
from directly accessing the hardware. Applications must interact with the hardware 
through the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) of the OS. As usual, there is a catch; this 
extra stability sacrifices compatibility. NT does not work with as many applications and 
drivers as 9x does. 
Windows NT was focused on business users, and was built new from the ground up 
to provide the stability, reliability, and security features needed in the business environ- 
ment. Until Microsoft comes up with a completely new kernel, all future versions of 
Windows will be descendants of the NT family line. Just as with the MS-DOS family 
line, Microsoft started off naming Windows NT with version numbers. Starting with 
Windows 2000, Windows was named after the year it was released, and the letters NT 
were removed from the name (although the tag line "built on NT technology" remained 
on the splash screen). Figure 8.1 shows the structure of the NT family line.

The latest incarnation of Microsoft's server product, Windows Server 2003, offers 
many new features and improvements that make the network administrator's job easier. 
This chapter will briefly summarize what's new in 2003 and introduce you to the four 
members of the Windows Server 2003 family: the Web Edition, the Standard Edition, 
the Enterprise Edition, and the Datacenter Edition. We'll also discuss how licensing 
works with Windows Server 2003, and provide a heads up on some of the issues you 
might encounter when installing the new OS or upgrading from Windows 2000. We'll 
look at the tools and documentation that come with Windows Server 2003 to famil- 
iarize you with new features in this version of the Microsoft operation system. 
Windows Server 2003 improves upon previous versions of Windows in the areas of 
availability, reliability, security, and scalability. Microsoft has enhanced most of the features 
carried over from Windows 2000 Server and has added some new features for Windows 
Server 2003. 
Installation and Requirements 
Unless your company is buying its first Windows server, you are going to have to decide 
between upgrading and performing a clean install. Each method has advantages and dis- 
advantages: 
www.syngress.com 

Network Operating Systems • Chapter 8 
497 
Upgrading preserves many of your existing settings, such as users and groups, 
permissions and rights, and applications. 
Performing a clean installation can improve the performance of your hard 
drive, as it will be reformatted during installation. This also gives you a chance 
to change the partition and volume sizes used on your drives. Clean installs 
ensure that you don't carry over any existing problems that you might have 
with your current OS. Some administrators (the authors of this book included) 
prefer clean installs because they have seen many problems related to OS 
upgrades in the past. There is something comforting about starting from 
scratch. Microsoft recommends that you perform an upgrade if you will be 
using existing hardware, and to perform a clean install if you will be pur- 
chasing new hardware. 
Common Installation Issues 
The biggest problems with installing a new operating system are hardware and software 
incompatibilities. It is important to adhere to the recommended hardware specifications for 
Windows Server 2003. At a minimum, you need the following hardware configuration: 
• 
133 MHz processor 
• 
128MB of R_AM (random access memory) 
• 
1.5GB hard drive 
Remember that these are the bare minimums on which Windows Server 2003 will 
run. Obviously, on such old hardware, performance will suffer. Microsoft recommends at 
least a 550 MHz processor and 256MB of RAM. The more RAM the better the 
performance. 
You should always verify hardware compatibility before you start your installation. 
There is a system compatibility check you can run from the Windows Server 2003 CD 
that will check out your hardware for you automatically via the System Compatibility 
wizard. Even if all of* your hardware is supported, you should always update your 
machine's BIOS (basic input/output system) to the most recent version, to ensure that 
your hardware is as up-to-date as possible. 
Common Upgrade Issues 
Whether you're doing a clean install or an upgrade, you should always verify hardware 
compatibility and BIOS versions to make sure that they will play well with your new 
NOS.You should always back up your existing system before you start your upgrade. If" 
you have applications on your server, you should read the release notes on application 
compatibility. 

498 
Chapter 8 • Network Operating Systems 
When upgrading servers from NT 4.0 to Windows Server 2003, you must have 
Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 5 or higher installed.You can perform upgrades from all 
server versions of NT 4.0 (Server, Enterprise Edition, and Terminal Server Edition). 
Upgrading Windows 2000 machines to Windows Server 2003 doesn't require any ser- 
vice packs to be installed first. Windows 2000 Server can be upgraded to Windows 
Server 2003 Standard Edition or Enterprise Edition. However, Windows 2000 Advanced 
Server can only be upgraded to Windows Server 2003 Enterprise Edition, and Windows 
2000 Datacenter Server can only be upgraded to Windows Server 2003 Datacenter 
Edition.You must have at least 2GB of free hard drive space for all upgrades. 
Design and Planning 
Planning is the first step in building a reliable, secure, high-performance, and highly 
available Windows Server 2003-based network. In this section, we'll begin with an 
overview of network infrastructure planning, introducing you to planning strategies and 
how to use planning tools. We'll also discuss how to develop a test network environment 
and how to document the planning and network design process. 
Proper planning of a network infrastructure is essential to ensuring high perfor- 
mance, availability, and overall satisfaction with your network operations. In order to 
create a viable network design, you'll need an understanding of both the business 
requirements of your organization and current and emerging networking technologies. 
Accurate network planning will allow your organization to maximize the efficiency of 
its computer operations, lower costs, and enhance your overall business processes. When 
planning for a new infrastructure or upgrading an existing network, you should take 
some or all of the following steps: 
• 
Document the business requirements of your client or organization. 
• 
Create a baseline of the performance of any existing hardware and network 
utilization. 
• 
Determine the necessary capacity for the physical network installation, 
including client and server hardware, as well as allocating network and Internet 
bandwidth for network services and applications. 
• 
Select an appropriate network protocol and create an addressing scheme that 
will provide for the existing size of the network and will allocate room for any 
foreseeable expansions, mergers, or acquisitions. 
• 
Specify and implement the technologies that will meet the existing needs of 
your network while allowing room for future growth. 
• 
Plan to upgrade and/or migrate any existing technologies, including server 
operating systems and routing protocols.

Planning Strategies 
When designing a new network or significantly upgrading an existing one, you should 
first use the business requirements of your organization as the primary source of~lan- 
ning information.You'll need to create a network infrastructure that addresses the needs 
of your management structure, such as fault tolerance, security, scalability, performance, 
and cost.You'll need to balance these requirements with the types of services that your 
users and clients will expect from a modern network, including e-mail, calendaring, pro- 
ject collaboration, Internet access, and file, print, and application services. 
After you've determined the business requirements of your network, you should then 
analyze the technical requirements of your organization. These requirements may apply to 
any applications that are already in use or that you plan to implement, as well as to the 
associated hardware and operating system.You should carefully note all of these require- 
ments so that you won't create any di~culties later on during the implementation process. 
Be sure to analyze and document the existing network, including any hardware, software, 
and network services that are already in place. This will make it easier to take the existing 
configuration into account when planning the new or upgraded network. 
Finally, any well-formed network plan should make allowances for future changes to 
the organization, including support for new technologies and operating systems, as well 
as additional hardware and users.Your organization's business requirements can change-- 
through a merger, an acquisition, or simple growth and expansion. Although it is impos- 
sible to foresee all possible changes of this nature, a good network design will be flexible 
enough to accommodate as many adjustments as possible. 
Using Planning Tools 
There are a number of tools available to assist you in developing a plan for your network 
infrastructure. The first and best of these, however, might be the simplest: pencil and 
paper. As we discussed in the previous section, you should begin your planning by deter- 
mining the requirements of the business that will be using the network. 
After you have a high-level understanding of your company's organizational struc- 
ture and computing needs, you should inventory the hardware and software that is 
already in place. This is especially important to ensure existing hardware and software is 
supported in Windows Server 2003. In a small office environment, you can accomplish 
this by simply taking a walk to determine the physical layout of network cables, routers, 
and the like. In a medium- to large-sized enterprise network, you will probably want to 
rely on automated inventory tools such as Microsoft's Systems Management Server 
(SMS) or a third-party equivalent. Take as detailed of an inventory as possible, including 
the hardware configuration of server and workstation machines, as well as vendor names 
and the version numbers of the operating system and business applications the systems 
are running. 
You can use a network analyzer, such as the Network Monitor utility built into the 
Windows Server 2003 operating system or the more full-featured version of Network 
www.syngress.com 

500 
Chapter 8 • Network Operating Systems 
Monitor included in SMS, to create a baseline of the current utilization of your network 
bandwidth. If this utilization is already near capacity, you can use this baseline to justify 
and plan upgrades to your network infrastructure (moving from 10 Mbps Ethernet to 
100 Mbps Ethernet, for example). When implementing a new network or computer 
solution, you should perform a thorough battery of testing before deploying it into pro- 
duction. Although not specific to Windows Server 2003, you should follow a systematic 
approach to designing a new or upgraded network. This typically includes developing a 
test environment in which you can test compatibility, usability, connectivity, security set- 
tings, and more. 
You'll begin the test process in an isolated lab where new technologies will have no 
chance of adversely affecting the existing computing environment. After you are satisfied 
with the new technology's performance in the test lab, you can expand testing into a pilot 
deployment involving a few actual users, analyzing their input and reactions to make any 
necessary adjustments to your design. Only after you are satisfied with the pilot deploy- 
ment should you perform a full-scale deployment in your production environment. 
Depending on the total number of users you have, you might want to split your 
full-scale deployment schedule into stages. After each stage, you can verify that your 
system is accommodating the increased processing load from the additional users as 
expected, before you begin deploying the next group of users. 
The success of any network deployment depends heavily on your ability to develop 
an effective test environment. This test lab can consist of a single lab or several labs, each 
of which can test various pieces of the overall design without risking the integrity of 
your production environment. Working in the test lab will allow you to verify the effec- 
tiveness of your design, discover any potential deployment problems, and increase your 
staff's familiarity with the new technology before it goes live. In short, a well-developed 
test environment will reduce the risk of errors during the deployment of a new tech- 
nology, thus minimizing any potential downtime for your clients and users. 
Planning the Test Network 
Before you begin testing your network design, you need to plan the test network itself. 
The first step is to determine the hardware resources required to set up the lab. This 
involves identifying the standard configurations of your existing or new client com- 
puters. If you support diverse workstations, do your best to include a representative 
workstation from each supported configuration. Be sure to include all components and 
peripherals, including the following: 
• 
BIOS versions 
• 
USB (universal serial bus) adapters 
• 
CD-ROM and DVD-ROM drives 
• 
Sound cards

• 
Video cams 
• 
Network adapters 
• 
Smart card readers 
• 
Removable storage devices, such as Zip drives or external hard drives 
• 
Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) adapters 
• 
Removable storage devices 
• 
Mouse or trackball devices 
• 
Keyboards 
Mthough using separate hardware devices for your test lab is the ideal, many small- 
and medium-sized businesses simply cannot afford to buy dozens of computers for the 
test lab. Using a third-party product such as VMware (www.vmware.com) will allow you 
to simulate a multiple server/domain environment, as well as multiple desktop opera- 
tions systems fairly closely without the expense of multiple individual machines. 
VMware can run multiple operating systems~such as Microsoft Windows, Linux, and 
Novell NetWare--simultaneously on a single PC, including all networking and connec- 
tivity that you would need to perform your testing. 
In addition to purchasing hardware or virtual PC environments for the test lab, you 
need to secure appropriate licensing for all necessary software, including operating sys- 
tems, service packs, management utilities, and business applications. Make sure that you 
can obtain or duplicate the following configuration and information when creating a 
test lab for Windows Server 2003: 
• 
Network services Install the same services on a test server that will be used 
in the actual deployment. This can include Domain Name System (DNS), 
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), Windows Internet Name 
Service (WINS), or any other Windows service. 
• 
User accounts Create a domain controller in your test environment to 
effectively simulate any upgrade procedures. 
• 
Domain structure Simulate the domain hierarchy of your proposed envi- 
ronment, including forests, trees, parent and child domains, and all necessary 
trust relationships. Configure sites as necessary to simulate any WAN (wide 
area network) testing considerations. 
• 
Network protocols and topology Re-create the network technologies that 
will be used in your production environment as completely as possible. For 
example, if your production environment will be using 100 Mbps cabling, 
using Gigabit Ethernet will provide erroneous results when doing performance 
testing.You should also include routers to test for performance latency as well 
as replication across WAN links.

Chapter 8 • Network Operating Systems 
Domain authentication Use the appropriate authentication to mimic the 
desired production environment, such as using NTLM versus Kerberos client 
authentication. NTLM stands for New Technology LAN Manager, and is a 
Microsoft protocol used for authentication purposes. Selecting the appropriate 
authentication model will allow you to compare apples to apples during testing 
and avoid any unexpected behavior later. Kerberos is covered in detail in 
Chapter 7. 
One important (but often overlooked) step in the planning process is that of care- 
fully selecting a location for your test lab. Too often, the test lab is relegated to a corner 
of a server room or whatever room is available in a file or storage area. However, if you 
will be performing tests for an extended period of time, you should consider allocating a 
permanent or semi-permanent location for the lab. Be sure to locate the test lab in an 
area with enough space for all necessary equipment and personnel. If you will be testing 
network equipment that will be deployed to multiple locations, you should consider 
deploying a test lab at each site to test WAN links, replication, and site configurations. 
Also, identify the personnel you'll need to perform testing, as well as whatever training 
they will need. 
Finally, be sure to provide both physical and logical security measures for the equip- 
ment and resources of the test lab. This includes isolating the test lab topology from your 
corporate network using routers, switches, or firewalls, as appropriate. If you need to 
provide a connection from the test lab to the corporate network, decide in advance how 
you will control, secure, and monitor that connection, and be sure to devise a way to 
quickly terminate the connection if something unexpected or adverse occurs. 
Documenting the Planning and Network Design Process 
The importance of documenting your computing environment after you have deployed 
a new network design cannot be overemphasized. As you move through the network 
design and testing processes, you should also keep detailed documentation of each 
design, product, or vendor decision that you make, including your reasons for choosing 
one alternative over another. Personnel changes can occur without warning, and a well- 
maintained design document will quickly answer the question of"Why did we choose 
Vendor X over Vendor Y?" when it is posed by the new Vice President of IT, who just 
started last week. Knowing that Vendor Y's product proved incompatible after several 
hours of troubleshooting will save you from wasting time by repeating portions of the 
design process. 
Because of the effects that ongoing changes can have in a production environment, 
many organizations use test equipment to test every patch and service pack that is 
released by their product vendors, so that any potential problems or bugs can be inter- 
cepted before the patch is applied globally. Whatever method you use to roll out 
ongoing updates and changes, you should include detailed documentation, not only of 
what update was rolled out on a given date, but also of how the change was applied to 
client machines or other devices on your network. 

Network Operating Systems • Chapter 8 
503 
When documenting both your test lab and your overall network design, there are a 
number of items that need to be discussed. Although maintaining network documenta- 
tion is often relegated to a backseat behind the numerous fires that we must put out on 
a daily basis as network administrators, comprehensive records in this area will actually 
help you in whatever troubleshooting issues come up after the new network is placed 
into production. Include configuration information about the following components of 
your final network design (although a complete list is limited only by the amount of 
time you have in the day!): 
• 
Windows Server 2003 domain structure information, including DNS hierarchy 
and replication information, and AD (Active Directory) structural information. 
• 
Trust relationships, both transitive and explicitly defined. 
• 
Network connectivity hardware (switches, routers, firewalls, and other LAN 
and WAN connectivity devices). 
• 
Client computer configuration, both hardware and software. • 
• 
Line-of-business application inventory and configuration. 
• 
Backup, restore, and disaster recovery procedures. 
.... ~ T DAY TiP 
~ Disaster recovery is sometimes referred to simply as DR. 
Users and Groups 
An important part of the network administrator's job involves management of the net- 
work's users and computers. Windows Server 2003 assigns accounts to both users and 
computers for security and management purposes. User accounts can be further man- 
aged by placing them in groups so that tasks~such as assigning permissions~can be 
applied to an entire group of users simultaneously rather than having to do so for each 
individual user account. In this section we'll show you how to work with Active 
Directory user accounts, including the built-in accounts and those you create.You'll also 
learn to work with group accounts and you'll learn about group types and scopes.You'll 
learn to use the built in tools~both graphical and command line--to perform the 
common administrative tasks associated with the users, groups, and computers including 
creating and managing all three types of accounts. 
Security principals get their name because they are Active Directory objects that are 
assigned security identifiers (SIDs) when they are created.The SID is used to control access 
to resources and by internal processes to identify security principals. Because each SID is 

504 
Chapter 8 • Network 
Operating 
Systems 
unique, unless security is breached, there is no way for accounts to mistakenly gain access 
to restricted resources when the system is properly configured by an administrator. 
SIDs are used because unlike the names associated with objects, SIDs don't change. 
When the object is created, a unique alphanumeric value is associated with it, and this 
stays with the object until it is deleted. Such things as changing the object's name or 
other attributes don't affect the SID. Because the SID is used to determine access, the 
user's identity remains constant, and any access the user has will be unaffected. 
As shown in Figure 8.2, the SID is used as part of the authentication process. When 
a user logs on to a domain, the Local Security Authority (LSA) is used to authenticate to 
Active Directory, and create an access token. The access token is used for controlling a 
user's access to resources, and contains the user's logon name and SID, the names and 
SIDs for any groups the user is a member of, and privileges assigned to the user. The 
token is created each time the user logs on, and holds all of the information needed for 
access control.

Control 
Resource 
List 
When a user attempts to access a resource, Windows Server 2003 compares the SID 
with the resource's security descriptor.An access control list (ACL) contains two com- 
ponents, the discretionary access control list (DACL) and the system access control list 
(SACL). The SACL is used for auditing access to a resource. An entry in an SACL con- 
tains information on whether logging should be generated on attempts to access a 
resource. This logging can be generated when a specified user or group attempts to 
access a resource and is successful, fails, or both. The DACL is used for a different put- 
www.syngress.com 

Network Operating Systems • Chapter 8 
505 
pose. DACLs determine whether a security principal is granted or denied access to a 
resource. The DACL catalogs who has access to the resource and what level of access he 
or she has. When a user tries to access an object, the user's SID is compared to entries in 
the DACL. If the user's SID or the SID of a group he or she belongs to matches an 
entry in the DACL, that user can be either explicitly permitted or denied access to use 
the resource. 
When a security principal attempts to access a resource that is protected by a 
DACL, each entry in the DACL is analyzed in sequence to determine if access should be 
allowed or denied. As shown in Figure 8.3, the SID of the user and any groups he or she 
belongs to is compared to the access control entries (ACEs) in the DACL. Windows 
Server 2003 will look at each ACE until one of the following occurs: 
• 
An entry is found that explicitly denies access to the resource. 
• 
One or more entries are found that explicitly grants access to the resource. 
• 
The entire DACL is searched, but no ACE is found that explicitly grants or 
denies access. Since no entry is found, the security principal is implicitly 
denied access. 
In Figure 8.3, one user is granted access while the other is denied access. When the 
SIDs associated with the access token of the JaneS user is compared with the entries in 
the DACL, the system will find that she is a member of GroupA (which has read and 
write access) and GroupB (which has execute access). Because of her membership in 
these groups, she will be granted read, write, and execute permissions for the resource. 
When the SIDs associated with the access token of the JohnD user is compared with the 
DACL, the system will find that he is a member of GroupB, which has execute permis- 
sion for the resource. However, there is also an ACE that explicitly denies JohnD read, 
write, and execute access. When the user's SID is compared with this entry, he will be 
denied access. In general, the most permissive combination of permissions will be 
allowed when a user accesses a resource, unless an explicit deny is assigned.

In addition to containing the user's SID and the SIDs of any groups the user is a 
member of, the access token might also contain additional SIDs that result from group 
membership the operating system assigns dynamically or other special logon scenarios. 
Creating User Accounts 
In Windows Server 2003, two different types of user accounts can be created: local and 
domain-based user accounts. Local user accounts are used to control access to the com- 
puter on which you are working. They are created on Windows Server 2003 by using 
the Local Users and Groups snap-in, or the Users node under the Local Users and 
Groups node in the Computer Management utility. Once created, the account informa- 
tion is stored in a local database called the Security Accounts Manager (SAM). The account 
information only applies to the local computer, and isn't replicated to other machines 
within the domain. When a user logs on to the computer, Windows Server 2003 
authenticates the user with this information, and either permits or denies access to the 
machine. 
Domain accounts are created in Active Directory and are considerably different from 
local user accounts. Rather than storing information on the local machine, account 
information is stored in the directory and replicated to other Active Directory domain 
controllers or DCs. Domain controllers are computers that are running the Windows 
NOS that provides for centralized authentication using domain accounts. 
As we discussed earlier, when the user logs on to a DC, the account information is 
used to build an access token. This access token is used for the duration of time that the 
www.syngress.com 

Network Operating Systems • Chapter 8 
507 
user is logged on to the network, and determines what the user is allowed to access on 
the network, and actions he or she can perform. 
Active Directory user accounts are created and managed using the Active Directory 
Users and Computers snap-in.As shown in the Figure 8.4, this snap-in provides a 
graphical user interface (GUI) that allows you to point-and-click through the various 
tasks related to administering user objects. The left pane of this tool is the console tree, 
which contains nodes representing your domain and the container objects within your 
domain such as OUs (organizational units). Expanding the node of a domain displays 
the containers, which can be selected to view objects stored within them. These objects 
within the container are displayed in the right pane of the console.

You can manually create user objects for accounts used by users and services within 
your organization, in addition to those automatically created when Active Directory is 
first installed. The two most common built-in accounts are stored in the Users container 
of Active Directory Users and Computers, and are: 
• 
Administrator This is the first account that's created when Active Directory 
is installed, and has the highest level of access of any default account created in 
Active Directory. It is a member of the Administrators, Domain Admins, 
Domain Users, Enterprise Admins, Group Policy Creator Owners, and Schema 
Admins groups. Due to the importance of the Administrator account, it cannot 
be deleted from Active Directory or removed from the Administrators group. It 
can, however, depending on which version of Windows you use, be disabled or 
renamed to make it more difficult for unauthorized or malicious users to use 
this account by guessing its password. 

508 
Chapter 8 • Network Operating Systems 
Guest The Guest account is another built-in account, but provides the lowest 
level of access. It is designed to be used by occasional users who need minimal 
access and don't want to log on with their own account, or users who don't 
have an account of their own in the domain. 
Windows Server 2003 allows you to create users at the command line, as well as 
using the Active Directory Users and Computers GUI. Active Directory Users and 
Computers is a tool that is installed on domain controllers and is used by those with the 
appropriate access to create domain accounts. Only members of the following Windows 
security groups can create new user accounts by default: 
• 
Administrators 
• 
Account Operators 
• 
Domain Admins

Managing User Accounts 
Managing user accounts is done through the properties of the object, which are acces- 
sible by using Active Directory Users and Computers.You can access the properties of a 
user object by selecting the object, and then clicking on Action [ Properties.You can 
also right-click on the object and select Properties 
from the context menu. 
Upon opening the properties of the user, you will see a number of tabs that allow you 
to set various options and provide information dealing with the account including general 
information, settings for Terminal Services, certificate information, and group membership, 
among others. Individually, each of the tabs allows you to manage different settings related 
to the user account. However, a number of these tabs are related, in that they deal with 
particular aspects of user account management. As we'll see in the sections that follow, by 
using them together, you can configure how the account can be used. 
In looking at which properties can be set with these tabs, you will see that there are 
four tabs that contain personal information about the user: General, Address, Telephones, 
www.syngress.com 

512 
Chapter 8 • Network Operating Systems: 
and Organization.As shown in Figure 8.6, the General tab contains a number of fields 
that contain information provided when the account was initially created. 
In looking at this tab, notice that Telephone and Web page fields have a button 
beside them named Other. When this button is clicked, a dialog box will open that 
allows you to enter additional entries. As you might guess, this is because many users 
might have more than one Web page or telephone number associated with them. If 
additional entries exist, you can also click the Other button to view these entries in the 
dialog box that appears.

The Address tab is used to store contact information dealing with a user's physical or 
mailing address, as shown in Figure 8.7.

The Telephones tab is another tab that contains personal properties related to the 
user. As shown in Figure 8.8, this tab provides contact information relating to various 
methods of verbal or digital communication. Because users might have multiple tele- 
phone numbers, pagers, and other methods of communication, each of these fields 
(except for Notes) also includes an Other button.

System Management 
In addition to the Active Directory Users & Computers tool that you've already seen, 
the majority of Windows management takes place in the Computer Management utility 
shown in Figure 8.10. This utility provides a one-stop shop to perform any number of 
Windows management tasks, including: 
• 
Starting and stopping services. 
• 
Managing disk space, including creating and deleting partitions and assigning 
drive letters. 
• 
Managing user connections to a server. 
• 
Creating shared folders for remote user access. 
• 
Managing specific services such as the Internet Information Service (IIS) Web 
service, the Microsoft Indexing Service to index files on the server hard drive, 
etcetera. 
• 
Accessing removable storage such as backup tapes and USB devices. 
• 
Managing and installing hardware devices through the Windows Device 
Manager. This includes installing new devices and updating device drivers for 
existing devices.

Client Support 
...... 
The Windows Server family supports a wide variety of both Microsoft and non- 
~ 
Microsoft clients.You can connect to an Active Directory domain controller using a 
client computer that is running any of the following operating systems: 
• 
MS DOS 
• 
Windows 3.x 
• 
Windows 9x/ME 
• 
Windows NT 4.0 
• 
Windows 2000 
• 
Windows XP 
• 
Macintosh 
• 
UNIX/Linux 
In the case of Windows clients, most will be able to connect to an Active Directory 
server without any special software requirements. Macintosh and UNIX/Linux clients 
require a special service to be running on the Windows Server, either Client Services for 
Macintosh or Client Services for UNIX. Clients will also need to be running a protocol 
that is supported by the Windows server. In Windows NT 4.0 and earlier, the default 
Windows protocol was NetBEU1. In Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003 as well 
as Windows XR the default network protocol is TCP/IP (Transmission Control 
Protocol/Internet Protocol). 
Interoperability 
As you saw in the previous section, Microsoft Windows allows many different client 
_ 
operating systems to connect to a Windows server. Windows NT 4.0 and Active 
Directory provide similar interoperability for other network operating systems as well.

For example, you can use Client Services for UNIX to allow Windows clients to con- 
nect to a UNIX server, UNIX clients to access resources on a Windows server, and you 
can even create a trust relationship between a Windows and a UNIX server so that clients 
can access resources on either one using a single username and password. 
You can also install the Gateway Services for Net Ware (GSNW) on a Windows server 
to allow Microsoft clients to access files that reside on a NetWare server without having 
to install NetWare-specific client software. This service is installed on a Windows server 
and acts as a go-between whenever a client requests a resource that's located on a 
NetWare server. 
Authentication 
As you saw earlier, Windows NT 4.0 and earlier versions of Windows use LAN 
~'~ 
Manager (LM) or NT LAN Manager authentication to allow clients to access resources 
on the Windows server. 
Client computers running Windows 3.11, Windows 95/98 or Windows NT 4.0 will 
always use LM or NTLM to access resources on a Microsoft NOS. NTLM provides the 
ability to verify the identity of a user who is attempting to log onto a Microsoft server. 
With Active Directory, Microsoft introduces a new way of authenticating users 
through the Kerberos authentication method. Kerberos is more flexible than NTLM, as 
well as being much more secure. Clients running Windows 2000, Windows XP or 
Windows Server 2003 will use Kerberos to connect to a Windows server whenever pos- 
sible; however, all Active Directory servers will still support NTLM authentication for 
backwards compatibility with older clients who do not support Kerberos authentication. 
File and Print Services 
Practically every organization uses file and print services, as sharing files and printers was 
~ t h e  
original reason for networking computers together. Microsoft has improved the tools 
used to manage your file system by making the tools run faster than before; this allows 
users to get their jobs done in less time and requires less downtime from your servers. 
The Distributed File System (DFS) and the File Replication Service (F1KS) have also 
been enhanced for Windows Server 2003, and Microsoft has made printing faster and 
easier to manage. 
Enhanced File System Features 
Windows Server 2003 supports WebDAV, which was first introduced in Exchange 2000. 
It allows remote document sharing. Through standard file system calls, clients can access 
files stored on Web repositories. In other words, clients think they are making requests 
to their local file systems, but the requests are actually being fulfilled via Web resources. 
Microsoft made it easier to manage disks in Windows Server 2003 by including a 
command-line interface. From the command line, you can do tasks that were only sup- 
ported from the GUI in Windows 2000, such as managing partitions and volumes, con-

Chapter 8 • Network Operating Systems 
figuring RAID (redundant array of independent disks), and defragmenting your disks. 
There are also command-line tools for extending basic disk, file system tuning, and 
shadow copy management. 
Disk fragmentation is a problem that commonly plagues file servers. This occurs 
when data is constantly written to and removed from a drive and moved around the 
disk. Data is no longer in contiguous blocks, therefore it will take longer to find and 
reassemble the data for use. Fragmented drives do not perform as well as deffagmented 
drives. Although Windows 2000 (unlike NT) included a disk deffagmentation tool, it 
was notoriously slow. To address this, Microsoft enhanced the deffagmenter tool in 
Windows Server 2003 so that it is much faster than before. In addition, the new tool is 
not limited to only specific cluster sizes that it can deffag, and it can perform an online 
deffagmentation of the Master file allocation table (FAT). 
One of the best file system improvements in Windows Server 2003 is shadow copies. 
After you enable shadow copies on the server and install the shadow copy client software 
on the desktop computer, end users can right-click on a file and view previous versions 
that were backed up via shadow copies.They can then keep the current version of the fde 
or roll back to an earlier version. This will remove the burden (to some extent) of simple 
file restores from your IT staff and allow the users to handle it themselves. 
Improved Printing Features 
Even though we rely more on electronic communications than ever before, printing is still 
an important requirement for most companies. One of the more common reasons for 
small companies to put in a network is for the purpose of sharing printers (a shared 
Internet connection and e-mail are two other reasons). Microsoft has taken many steps to 
improve the printing experience in Windows Server 2003. Users who print long docu- 
ments should notice a performance boost over Windows 2000, because Windows Server 
2003 does a better job of file spoofing, so print jobs should get to the printer faster. 
Microsoft has also made printing easier to manage. Windows Server 2003 has com- 
mand-fine utilities for managing printer configuration, including print queues, print jobs, 
and driver management. System Monitor has counters for managing print performance. 
Installing printers is easy with Windows 2003 because of plug-and-play (PnP) 
functionality. This allows you to physically connect the printer to the machine and have 
Windows set it up for you automatically (as long as the printer itself supports PnP). 
Windows Server 2003 supports over 3800 new print drivers. 
Granting Access to Shares Resources 
Windows NT, 2000, and 2003 provide clients with the ability to access files and printers 
that are housed on a remote server just as easily as if the resources were located on the 
client's local hard drive. To enable access to shared resources, a Windows administrator 
needs to assign permissions to a Windows user or group account. In most cases, you'll 
assign permissions to groups of users rather than one user at a time, in order to make the 
www.syngress.com 

Network Operating Systems • Chapter 8 
519 
administrative process more efficient. Using groups, you can perform a variety of tasks 
that will affect the accounts and groups that are members. These include: 
• 
Assigning rights to a group account to authorize group members to perform a 
certain task. 
• 
Assigning permissions on shared resources to a group, so that all members can 
access the resource in the same manner. 
• 
Distributing bulk e-mail to all members of the group. 
The first step in working with group accounts is deciding on the type of group you 
want to create and work with. In Active Directory, there are two different types, each of 
which is used for a different purpose: 
• 
Security groups 
• 
Distribution groups 
The difference between these groups resides in how they are used. Security groups 
are designed to be used for security purposes, while distribution groups are designed to 
be used for sending bulk e-mail to collections of users. 
Security Groups 
A security group is a collection of users who have specific rights and permissions to 
resources. Although both can be applied to a group account, rights and permissions are 
different from one another. Rights are assigned to users and groups, and control the 
actions a user or member of a group can take. In Windows Server 2003, rights are also 
sometimes called privileges. Permissions are used to control access to resources. When per- 
missions are assigned to a group, they determine what the members of the group can do 
with a particular resource. 
Security groups are able to obtain such access because they are given a security identi- 
fier when the group account is first created. Because it has a SID, it can be part of a discre- 
tionary access control list, which lists the permissions users and groups have to a resource. 
When the user logs on, an access token is created that includes the user's SID and those of 
any groups to which the user belongs. When the user tries to access a resource, this access 
token is compared to the DACL to see which permissions should be given to the user. It is 
through this process and the use of groups that the user obtains more (and in some cases, 
less) access than has been explicitly given to his or her account. 
Another benefit of a security group is that you can send e-mail to it. When e-mail 
is sent to a group, every member of the group receives the e-mail. This saves having to 
send an e-mail message to each individual user. 
www.syngress.com 

520 
Chapter 8 • Network Operating Systems 
Distribution Groups 
While security groups are used for access control, distribution groups are used for 
sharing information. This type of group has nothing to do with security. It is used for 
distributing e-mail messages to groups of users. Rather than sending the same message 
to one user after another, distribution groups allow applications such as Microsoft 
Exchange to send e-mails to collections of users. 
The reason why distribution groups can't be used for security purposes is because 
they can't be listed in DACLs. When a new distribution group is created, it isn't given a 
SID, preventing it from being listed in the DACL. Although users who are members of 
different security groups can be added to a distribution group, it has no effect on the 
permissions and rights associated with their accounts. 
Application Support 
Perhaps the greatest strength of the Microsoft NOS is the fact that it supports an incred- 
ibly large number of applications. There are literally thousands of applications that are 
supported by Windows NT 4.0 and newer Microsoft NOSs, including productivity 
applications like Microsoft Office, e-mail, and database servers like Microsoft Exchange 
and Microsoft SQL server, and even complex Enterprise Resource Planning (E1KP) and 
financial management software packages. The Windows NOS versions also support 
Internet technologies using Microsoft Internet Explorer, as well as numerous third-party 
browsers. 
Security 
You might have noticed that Microsoft is paying more attention to security concerns in 
recent releases of the Windows operating system such as Windows Server 2003.You can 
now control which software can run on a machine via software restriction policies. 
These policies can be applied at the domain, site, OU, or locally.You define a default 
security level that either allows or disallows software to run via the Group Policy Object 
Editor snap-in. Among other things, software restriction policies can be used to prevent 
viruses and other harmful programs from running on your PC, and can also be used to 
limit end users to only running the programs needed for their jobs.You can also use 
Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to create a consistent desktop setting for your users, 
which will also increase the overall security of your network.

Windows Server 2003 in particular adds a number of new networking technologies 
that increase the security of your network. For example: 
• 
It supports IPv6, which was created to overcome the limited number of 
addresses in IPv4 (previous versions of NT use IPv4). Windows Server 2003 
supports IPv4/IPv6 coexistence through technologies such as Intra-Site 
Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP) and 6to4. Internet and 
remote access functionality has been enhanced in Windows Server 2003. 
• 
Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet (PPPoE) allows making broadband con- 
nections to an Internet Service Provider (ISP) without having to load any 
additional software. 
www.syngress.com 

522 
Chapter 8 • Network Operating Systems 
Windows can now use IP Security (IPSec) over a connection that's using 
Network Address Translation (NAT). 
In Windows 2000, IPSec was not supported through a NAT server. This was a 
serious drawback for some companies, as it meant they could not use a virtual private 
network (VPN) connection through a NAT device using IPSec or the Layer Two 
Tunneling Protocol (L2TP). This restriction has been removed in Windows Server 2003. 
Both IPSec connections and L2TP connections using IPSec are supported over NAT 
when you have a Server 2003 VPN server. This is done using a technology called NAT 
traversal, or NAT-T. On the client end, the Microsoft L2TP/IPSec VPN client supports 
NAT-T. It can be downloaded at www.microsoft.com/windows2000/server/evalua- 
tion/news/bulletins/12tpclient.asp and can be installed on Windows 98, ME, and NT 
4.0 Workstation. The Windows 2000 and Windows XP update can be found at 
http: / / support.microsoft, com/default, aspx? s cid = kb%3B en-us%3B 818043. 
Finally, the Internet Connection Firewall (ICF) functions as a personal software-based 
firewall and provides protection for computers connected to the Internet or unsecured 
networks. ICF protects LAN, VPN, dial-up, and PPPoE connections by making it easier to 
secure your server against attacks. With ICE only the services that you need to offer are 
exposed. For example, you can use ICF to filter the network connection of your DNS 
server so that only DNS requests are passed through. ICF is included with the 32-bit ver- 
sions of the Standard and Enterprise Editions of Windows Server 2003. It is not included 
with the Web and Datacenter Editions, or with any of the 64-bit versions. 
N etWa re 
Novell NetWare was one of the first network operating systems to really gain a foothold 
in corporate networks, and had a near-monopoly on the NOS market before Microsoft 
released its own NOS. While they have lost a certain amount of their market share to 
the Microsoft NOSs, Novell NetWare is still a thriving concern in many small and large 
businesses today. As a part of their plan to continue to compete in the NOS market, 
Novell has begun offering open source Linux-based solutions for companies who are 
looking for an alternative to Microsoft Windows products and Active Directory. 
Installation and Requirements 
To install the most recent release of NetWare, version 6.5, you'll need a computer that 
meets the following installation requirements: 
• 
A Pentium II processor, though the recommendation is a Pentium III, Pentium 
4 or Xeon operating at 700 MB or better. 
• 
512 MB of RAM, 1GB recommended 
• 
An SVGA display adapter 
• 
A DOS partition with at least 200 MB of available space, 1GB recommended 

Network Operating Systems • Chapter 8 
523 
• 
2 GB of flee space on another disk partition, 4 GB recommended 
If you are installing additional applications on the NetWare server such as 
ZenWorks, GroupWise, or Border Manager, you should increase the hardware specifica- 
tions of your server accordingly. 
Users and Groups 
Novell created Novell Directory Services (NDS) in the early to mid-1990's.This was a 
hierarchical user database similar to what Microsoft would offer in Active Directory a 
few years later. As NDS evolved, so did the name. The current NetWare solution for user 
and group management is eDirectory, which is an open framework that allows NetWare 
users to access many different applications using a single user object. The NetWare 
eDirectory can contain two types of objects: 
• 
Leaf objects These are objects that do not contain any other types of objects. 
A printer, a user object, and a group object are all considered leaf objects. 
• 
Container objects 
These are used to group the eDirectory into logical par- 
titions, similar to domains and organizational units in Microsoft Active 
Directory. 
~ M WARNING 
~! Don't be thrown off-guard: a group object is considered a leaf object in Novell 
~ 
NetWare. 
@ 
System Management 
NetWare includes a number of utilities that will allow you to manage all facets of the 
NetWare environment, from creating and managing users in eDirectory to managing 
network services such as the Apache Web server. Many, though not all, NetWare utilities 
run within a Web browser to provide the flexibility of being able to administer a 
NetWare server from many different platforms and from a remote location. 
The most common tools that you'll use to manage a NetWare server are as follows: 
• 
iManager A Web-based utility used to manage your NetWare server environ- 
ment, set up and configure eDirectory and create eDirectory objects, and to 
configure network services. 
• 
ConsoneOne A Java-based tool that allows you to manage the eDirectory 
and NetWare server resources (though iManager is the preferred tool for per- 
forming these tasks). 
www.syngress.com 

524 
Chapter 8 • Network Operating Systems 
• 
NetWare Remote Manager A browser-based tool that you can use to 
manage your NetWare server from a remote location, including monitoring 
your server's health or performing diagnostics or troubleshooting. 
• 
Remote Server Management A Java-based tool that allows for remote 
management from a remote workstation. 
• 
OpenSSH 
Provides a Secure Shell (SSH) connection to a NetWare server to 
perform monitoring, maintenance, and troubleshooting. It uses the Novell 
International Cryptographic Infrastructure (NICI) to encrypt OpenSSH con- 
nections. 
• 
Apache Manager A Web-based utility to manage the Apache Web server 
that is bundled with Novell NetWare. 
.......... ~iiiiiiiiiiiiiii!iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii%i~ 
.... 
i~ ...... Because Novell and Linux have entered into a partnership, you'll see some tech- 
................. 
nologies that overlap between them, such as the Apache Web server that is 
available on both NetWare and Linux servers. 
Client Support 
Unlike Microsoft, Novell does not offer a client operating system; there is no such thing 
as "NetWare 6.5 Professional" or the like. Most NetWare clients are Windows or Linux 
computers that are running NetWare client software to provide connectivity to NetWare 
resources. This client software allows users to take advantage of all NetWare services 
including eDirectory and file and print services. The current release of the NetWare 
client software is available in two versions: one for Windows 95 and 98, and one for 
Windows XP and 2000. NetWare clients must be running a network protocol that is 
supported by the NetWare server. In NetWare version 4 and earlier, the default protocol 
was IPX/SPX. In version 5 and later, the default NetWare protocol is TCP/IP. 
Authentication 
Novell NetWare uses the Novell Modular Authentication Service (NMAS) to provide 
authentication to the NetWare eDirectory and to Novell NDS. NMAS is bundled with 
NetWare version 6.5 or later, and can be purchased separately for earlier versions of the 
NOS. NMAS provides users with the ability to use a single username and password to 
connect to all available NetWare resources, rather than needing to remember multiple 
logins for different services. The NMAS server allows administrators to choose from 
three types of logins: 

Network Operating Systems • Chapter 8 
525 
• 
A username and password 
• 
A biometric device like a fingerprint or retina scanner 
• 
A smart card or other token like a digital certificate. 
File and Print Services 
Novell uses the Novell Storage Services (NSS) file system, which allows for access con- 
trol based on user ID, user and directory quotas, and file attributes that allow the admin- 
istrator to provide extensive file and print services to users and groups. Novell NetWare 
was one of the first companies to provide file and print services through its NOS, so the 
technology is well developed and stable. NSS can allow you to manage shared file 
storage for even a large organization with hundreds of thousands of employees. 
Application Support 
While NetWare doesn't have quite the level of application support as its Microsoft 
counterpart, there are still a number of useful applications that provide services to a 
NetWare network, including the following: 
• 
Novell GroupWise 6.5 is a collaboration service that provides e-mail and other 
information sharing capabilities. GroupWise can run on NetWare, Linux and 
Windows servers, and supports client software for Windows, Linux, Macintosh, 
as well as a Web-based client. 
• 
Novell ZENworks provides administrators with the ability to roll out software 
and manage settings for desktops, laptops, servers and handheld devices. 
• 
BorderManager provides firewall and VPN technologies for Novell NetWare 
networks. 
Interoperability 
Rather than just providing a way to create and manage user and group objects for 
NetWare networks, NetWare 6.5 allows you to synchronize information between 
eDirectory and NT domains, Active Directory, and third-party solutions like PeopleSoft 
and Lotus Notes. NetWare uses a service called DirXML to synchronize information 
between these different directory services, and you can customize how DirXML will 
react to new or changed information based on whatever rules you define. These rules 
can be business rules, or technical constraints based on time of day or available band- 
width. NetWare also offers PasswordSync, which allows your users to use a single pass- 
word to access these different directories: when a password is changed in one location, 
PasswordSync will automatically change the password in other locations to match.

Chapter 8 • Network Operating Systems 
Security 
Novell provides its own certificate server that allows you to deploy public key cryptog- 
raphy services that are directly integrated into eDirectory. This allows you to create, 
manage, and revoke digital certificates for both users and servers that will protect data as 
it's transmitted over public networks like the Internet. The Novell Certificate Server 
integrates with many e-mail clients including GroupWise and Microsoft Outlook. 
  
Linux/Unix 
In direct contrast with Microsoft, the Linux Network Operating System is distributed as 
open source software, which means that any developer is free to make changes to the 
source code of the NOS to meet their needs. Linux is not free in the sense that it will 
cost you absolutely nothing to deploy it~you will still need to invest time and money 
in having the necessary hardware, software and administrative expertise to administer a 
Linux network effectively. 
Installation and Requirements 
In order to install Linux, you'll need to acquire a distribution of the Linux software. 
Because Linux is open source software, there are many distributions, including GenToo, 
Red Hat, and Novell SUSE out on the market today.You can purchase a copy of Linux 
just as you would a copy of Windows, or you can download a distribution from the 
Internet and burn it to a writeable CD. Most Linux distributions contain the basic 
Linux kernel, as well as a number of add-on utilities and services that add to the 
usability and security of the operating system. 
The hardware requirements for Linux vary depending on which distribution you're 
using, but most Linux distributions will support being installed on PC hardware. As an 
example, SUSE Linux recommends the following minimum hardware requirements: 
• 
A Pentium; AMD: Duron, or AMD: Athlon processor 
• 
A minimum of 128 MB of RAM; with 256 MB recommended 
• 
At least 500 MB of disk space to install minimum services, 2.5 GB recom- 
mended for a standard installation 
Users and Groups 
You can create users in Linux from the command line, or by using a GUI utility such as 
Webmin. Just like with Windows and NetWare, you can organize users into groups to 
simplify administration. In Linux, the most powerful administrative account is called root. 
This root user can access and control every aspect of the operating system, and perform 
any function at any time. On university Linux systems in the early '90s, the root user was 
often named "God", with good reason. Therefore, it is essential that you protect the root

account with a strong password, and not use the root account for day-to-day tasks such 
as checking e-mail or surfing the Web.

You'll create new users from the Linux command line by using the useradd 
command. 
..... ~, .... 
All users that have been created on a Linux server reside in a file called/etc/passwd. 
You can view the file one page at a time using the more command, like this: 
more /etc/passwd 
Each line of the etc/password file contains a new user along with parameters such as 
their home directory and their numerical user ID. 
Groups in Linux are organized in much the same way as in Windows or NetWare.You 
create a group and then add user objects as members of the group.You can then assign 
rights and permissions to the group instead of to each individual user object.You'll create a 
new group at the command line with the groupadd command, or by using a GUI inter- 
face. Groups are stored in a file called/etc/group. To add a user to a group, use the 
gpasswd -a username 
command, specifying the user that you want to add to the group. 
You can delete a user from a group by using the gpasswd -d username command.You 
can also make changes to groups by editing the/etc/group file directly. 
System Management 
Much of Linux administration happens at the command line, though there are a number 
of GUI tools that you can also use to perform common administrative tasks.You can run 
different consoles simultaneously on a Linux system, and each console can be run in the 
security context of a different user. This means that you can be doing day-to-day tasks 
using an everyday user account, and open up a separate console to perform administra- 
tive tasks using the root password. Many of the commands that you can use on a Linux 
server are similar to DOS commands, but there are some differences. Some of the com- 
mands that you'll use on an everyday basis include the following: 
• 
cd to change to a different directory in the file system 
• 
Is to list the files and folders in a directory 
• 
cp to copy a file 
• 
mv to move a file 
• 
cat to view the contents of a text file

Client Support 
Client access to Linux servers is done using standard protocols and applications such as 
the following: 
telnet will allow you to open a text-based console window on a remote 
server. 
• 
ssh is similar to telnet, but provides a secure connection. 
• 
ftp allows you to upload and download files to and from a remote server.

would not be able to use SSH to access resources on that server. 
Authentication 
Historically, forms of UNIX authentication have existed for over forty years. From the 
venerable/etc/passwd to the more modern and secure Password Access Manager 
(PAM), various methods of authentication have been utilized for Linux workstation 
logon. This section will examine authentication methodologies that function across the 
many flavors of Linux. In many cases, this information is also applicable to Solaris, BSD, 
MacOS, and HP-UX flavors of UNIX. 
Understanding LDAP Authentication 
Lightweight Directory Application Protocol (LDAP)-based authentication is one of the 
most widely used cross-platform enterprise authentication technologies. It is versatile, well 
supported, and features strong encryption.As mentioned above, authentication services fre- 
quently integrate with directory services. In the case of LDAP authentication, the authen- 
tication service is the directory service. In small companies with simple authentication 
needs, OpenLDAP is often used as the authentication server for * nix systems. 
www.syngress.com 

Network Operating Systems • Chapter 8 
529 
The security of LDAP authentication can be increased substantially through the use 
of SASL (Simple Authentication and Security Layer) and TLS/SSL (Transport Layer 
Security / Secure Sockets Layer). SASL provides a rich set of authentication technolo- 
gies, and TLS/SSL enables encryption to ensure data and password (hash) privacy.

WARNING 
LDAP operates on TCP port 389. Secure LDAP (LDAPS) operates on TCP port 636. 
@ 
Understanding/etc/passwd/shadow Authentication 
One of the simplest ways of managing authentication is to use a local file containing 
usernames and passwords. A more secure way of managing local authentication is 
encrypting the passwords and storing them in a separate file. 
In the case of a modern standalone Linux workstation, user information is stored in 
/etc/passwd, and password information is stored in/etc/shadow.Access control permis- 
sions allow anyone to read/etc/passwd, but only allow root to read the password hashes 
in/etc/shadow. Here you can see the contents of a sample/etc/passwd. 
root :x: 0 : 0 : root :/root :/bin/bash 
daemon :x : 1 : 1 : daemon :/usr/sbin :/bin/sh 
bin:x: 2:2 :bin:/bin:/bin/sh 
Ip:x: 7 : 7 : ip:/var/spool/ipd:/bin/sh 
dallen:x:1000:1000:David 
Allen,,, :/home/dallen:/bin/bash 
nobody:x: 65534 : 65534 :nobody:/nonexistent:/bin/sh 
The following is a sample of/etc/shadow: 
root:$156wDYOdeM$tePiVcO3v9sCG5W4TRbLO.:12655:0:99999:7::: 
daemon:*:12590:0:99999:7:::

nobody:*:12590:0:99999:7::: 
As you can see, the system-level accounts (such as daemon, bin, and lp) do not have a 
password. The password entries for root and dallen are hashes of the word "secret".

PAM is a flexible abstraction mechanism for user authentication that allows the authen- 
tication configuration for each application to be stored in a configuration file. This has 
the effect of separating the privilege-granting portions of an application into a system 
that can be dynamically reconfigured to support nearly any type of authentication 
scheme, without recompilation or reconfiguration of the application itself. 
Invented by Sun Microsystems, PAM is used in the current version of Solaris. The 
Solaris PAM implementation differs slightly from the Linux PAM implementation in file 
location, error codes, and configuration methodology. In this book, when we refer to 
PAM, we are referring to Linux PAM. All modern Linux distributions, including Red 
Hat, Debian, Suse, Mandrake, and others, provide PAM support. 
The PAlM framework provides a library of functions for user authentication requests. 
When an application needs to authenticate a user, it calls the appropriate function, and the 
PAlM subsystem handles the request. PAM will attempt to read the PAM configuration fde 
for the application, which is usually stored as/etc/pam.d/applicationname. In some cases the 
configuration may be stored in a single fde (/etc/pam.conf). If the/etc/pam.d/directory 
exists, most PAM implementations will ignore settings in/etc/pam.conf. 
A PAM configuration file is composed of multiple lines listing PAlM tokens for- 
matted in this way: 
service-name 
module-type 
control -flag 
module-path 
[ args ] 
PAM configuration files separate the authentication functions into four types: user 
authentication (auth), account restriction enforcement (account), session startup/teardown 
(session), and password (or authentication token) updating (password) functions. 
File and Print Services 
In the simple form (and in historical UNIX), file-based access control is called the work- 
gwups system and consists of only one level and three types of ownership per file or 
directory (one user, one group, and world) and three types of access control (read, write, 
and/or execute). User and group identity is traditionally set in/etc/passwd and 
/etc/group, although user ID (UID) and group ID (GID) can be attained from other 
areas such as NIS or OpenLDAR Ownership changes are performed with the commands 
ehown and ehgrp and are controlled with permission bits: nine file-mode bits (read, 
write, execute) and three special bits (setuid, setgid, and sticky). The command chmod can 
be used to set the permission and special bits, but some commands specifically set the 
three special bits (setuid, getuid, setreuid, seteuid, and setfsuid). On a directory, read allows 
you to list the contents, write allows you can create files within, and execute allows you to 
search a directory. 
ACL attributes are inherited from the parent directory at the time of creation. An 
ACL entry is composed of a type (user, group, mask, or other), a user~group or blank, and 
permissions. When no user is specified for a given type, permissions apply to the user or

group that owns the file or directory. Permissions resolution is determined in the fol- 
lowing non-cumulative order: owner, named user, owning group, named group, other. 
Table 8.1 shows the terms given to the following types of ACL entries.

Security 
When securing a Linux server, providing for physical security should be one of your top 
priorities. Servers should be housed in locked rooms that can only be accessed by autho- 
rized personnel.You should also perform regular backups to protect your critical data. In 
addition, you can use the built-in Linux firewall called iptables to control who is able to 
access your Linux servers and how. 
I"o 
or"÷l Mac OS X 
The latest version of the Macintosh server operating system, Mac OS X, is similar in 
operation and management to the Linux and UNIX network operating systems. Mac 
OS X uses open industry standards from the open-source BSD community, and provides 
true 64-bit computing support. The current release of OS X is version 10.4, codenamed 
"Tiger". Tiger integrates numerous open-source applications to provide database, e-mail 
and spam-filtering technologies.

Chapter 8 • Network Operating Systems 
Users and Groups 
The primary tool that you'll use to create and manage user and group objects in OS X 
is called Workgroup Manager.You can run Workgroup Manager from the server console, 
or you can install it on a client workstation to manage users remotely.You can also 
create ACLs that will permit or deny access to files and other resources to individual 
users and groups. 
System Management 
In addition to Workgroup Manager, Mac OS X also comes with the Server Admin tool. 
This graphical utility allows you to create, manage and monitor network services from 
any network-connected client. If you prefer to work from the command line, you can 
also use ssh to connect to and administer a Mac OS X server. 
Interoperability and Authentication 
Because OS X is built on open standards, the Macintosh NOS is compatible with most 
existing network and computing infrastructures for directory services and file and 
printer sharing. The Mac OS X NOS relies on Open Directory to provide a user 
database, and uses Kerberos for secure authentication to server resources. Just like with 
Active Directory and Linux implementations, Kerberos allows for strong authentication 
and single sign-on access to Mac resources. Open Directory is an LDAP implementation 
that can interoperate with UNIX and Linux implementations, and even Active 
Directory. 
File and Print Services 
Because OS X relies on industry standard protocols, clients can access Mac server 
resources without installing any special client software. OS X uses the Linux file permis- 
sions that we discussed in the previous section, as well as the access control lists used for 
Windows resources. OS X Server provides file sharing for all major client operating sys- 
tems using the following protocols: 
• 
AFP for Macintosh clients 
• 
SMB/CIFS for Windows computers 
• 
NFS for UNIX and Linux clients 
• 
FTP and WebDAV for clients connecting via a Web browser 
OS X server also uses the Common UNIX Printing Service (CUPS) to deploy 
print sharing on Macintosh servers.

Application Support 
The Macintosh Server NOS offers the following applications to clients accessing 
the server: 
• 
Software Update Server controls how your Macintosh clients will receive 
software updates from www.apple.com. This gives the administrator control 
over when and how updates are deployed across a network. 
• 
iChat Server is a secure instant messaging platform, which operates with the 
iChat Macintosh client in addition to several open-source clients available for 
other operating systems. 
• 
Weblog Server creates a system to manage blog, ging within an organization to 
allow for collaboration and information sharing. 
SpamAssassin provides filtering for unsolicited emails sent to the OS X mail 
server. 
ClamAV offers open-source anti-virus detection and quarantine for OS X 
servers and clients. 
Security 
Mac OS X uses industry standards to provide network security, including IPSec and 
802.1X network authentication. On higher-end server hardware, you can also deploy 
Virtual LANs (VLANs) to segregate network traffic and prevent sensitive information 
from traversing a public network such as the Internet. OS X also comes with a built-in 
firewall and support for access control lists to secure server resources. 
Appleshare IP 
As you've learned, Mac OS X Server is built around Linux-based open source standards. 
~ 
Prior to OS X, the server NOS that was available from Apple was called AppleShare IP. 
The AppleShare IP NOS offered a number of standard services for both Macintosh and 
Windows clients: web services, SMTR POP3, IMAR Finger, the NotifyMail email 
package, AppleShare for network services (which could use either the proprietary 
AppleTalk protocol or TCP/IP).AppleShare IP also offered FTP services, a built-in 
Print Server (again using TCP/IP or AppleTalk), a DNS server service, and File Sharing 
geared specifically for Windows clients. Each of these applications came with its own 
proprietary management console to administer the service or application.

Chapter 8 • Network Operating Systems 
[Netw°rk+l Identifying the Basic Capabilities 
Needed for Client Workstations to 
Connect to and Use Network Resources 
Regardless of the operating system that's running on the server that a client is connecting 
to, there are certain components that are necessary to create a network connection. In this 
section, we'll discuss the hardware and software that's necessary to allow a client worksta- 
tion to access network resources. When you are troubleshooting a network connectivity 
scenario, be sure that all of these elements are present and configured correctly. 
Networking Hardware 
The first element that is required for a network connection is having the appropriate 
hardware installed and configured. For a client workstation to access network resources, 
the following hardware must be in place: 
• 
Network interface card (NlC) This is the peripheral card that's installed in 
a computer, which allows you to connect a client to a wired or wireless net- 
work. When connecting a client to a network, be sure that the NIC you 
choose is of a brand and model that is appropriate for the client hardware. For 
example, in the case of a Windows computer, you can check the Windows 
Catalog to see if your NIC card is listed there. The Windows Catalog is a listing 
of all hardware that has been certified to operate with the Microsoft Windows 
operating systems. If you are working with a Linux distribution, there will 
likely be a readme.txt file or some other type of documentation that comes 
with the installation files that will list the supported NICs that you can install 
in your Linux computer. 
• 
Network media In the case of a wired network, this is the physical cabling 
that's used to connect the computer's NIC to a piece of networking hardware. 
There are many different specifications for network cabling, each with its own 
restrictions on length and transmission rate. For wireless networks, there is no 
physical cabling and the wireless NIC communicates with the wireless access 
point (WAP) using radio frequency (1KF) transmissions. 
• 
Networking hardware This is the hardware that's used to connect multiple 
computers to one another. Some of the possibilities for networking hardware are 
a hub, a switch or a router for a wired network, or a WAP for a wireless network. 
Networking Software 
Once the appropriate networking hardware is in place, a computer needs to have the 
necessary software components installed to enable network communications. The two 
software pieces that are necessary to create a network connection are as follows: 

Network Operating Systems • Chapter 8 
535 
The network client is a software piece that allows a client computer to interact 
with a server NOS. This client software can be built right into the client's 
operating system, or it can be an add-on that's installed manually by an admin- 
istrator. Windows computers come pre-configured with the Microsoft Client 
for Microsoft Networks, while Novell NetWare requires a separate client that 
can be installed from the NetWare server installation CD. 
The network protocol is the "language" or set of rules two computers use to 
communicate with one another.You can think of a network protocol as a 
spoken language: if one person speaks only English and another person speaks 
only German, then they will not be able to communicate. Likewise, if one 
computer has only the TCP/IP protocol installed, and another computer has 
only the IPX/SPX protocol installed, then those two computers will not be 
able to communicate either. Two computers will need to have at least one pro- 
tocol in common in order to be able to communicate with each other. Linux, 
Mac OS X, and Microsoft client operating systems running Windows 2000 or 
later will have TCP/IP enabled by default. Other protocols will need to be 
installed from the installation media. 
When configuring a workstation to access network resources, there are two different 
types of networks that you will encounter: 
• 
Computers that communicate in a peer-to-peer network do not use a dedicated 
server to host resources. As the name implies, each computer on the network is 
a peer or an equal; each individual computer can host resources that other 
computers in the peer-to-peer network can access. A peer-to-peer network 
also has no centralized authentication database in place, which means that users 
must authenticate to each individual computer to access resources on each 
one. Peer-to-peer networks are most commonly used for small office networks 
that cannot afford to invest in a centralized server. 
• 
Computers in a client-server network rely on one or more centralized servers to 
host resources. Client-server networks rely on a centralized authentication database 
so that users only need to remember one username and password to access 
network resources on the server computers. Because of this centralized authen- 
tication database, client-server networks are more efficient for larger networks. 
One potential disadvantage of a client-server network is that it requires addi- 
tional hardware for the server computers, as well as requiring additional tech- 
nical expertise to manage the server hardware and operating system.

Identifyi ag t the 
Appropr 
e Tool for a Wiring Task 
In many cases as a network administrator, the network hardware you'll be configuring 
will be limited to the running a short patch cable from a PC to a wall jack that's already 
been installed by a contractor. However, you may find yourself needing to install your 
own cabling and even network jacks themselves. In this section, we'll introduce some of 
the tools that you might encounter when working with network wiring. 
Wi re Cri m per 
Network cables consist of one or more wires that are shielded by an outer shell made 
from plastic or PVC coating.You've also learned that cables terminate at some type of 
connector at the end of the cable, usually an ILJ-11 connector (for CAT-3 or telephone 
wire), or an ILJ-45 connector for CAT-5, CAT-6 Ethernet cable. In order for network 
communications to take place, the wires inside of network cabling have to be configured 
inside of this connector in a particular order. In most cases, you'll purchase network 
cables with the ends pre-connected. But if you're running a large amount of cable, it 
might be more economical to cut lengths of cable and add the connectors yourself. To 
do this, you'll need to have a wire crimper to create a firm connection between the cable 
and the connector. Most wire crimpers also include a wire stripper that will remove the 
outer plastic/PVC coating from the network cable without damaging the wires inside. 
Wire crimpers can be purchased from most hardware, electronics or home improvement 
stores; you can see an example of one in Figure 8.12. 
Figure 8.12 A Typical Wire Crimper

537 
Media Tester/Certifier 
You can use a media tester to test for any faults or breaks in a network cable. These testers 
are designed to allow you to plug both ends of a cable into the tester, or one end of the 
tester can be plugged into a wall jack to confirm that a wall jack is functioning properly. 
If the cable is in good condition, Light Emitting Diode (LED) lights on the tester will 
light up. If there is a break in the cable (or if the wires are in the wrong order) the LED 
lights on the tester will not light. In some more advanced (and expensive) models, the 
tester will even give you a diagnostic of what is wrong with the cable, displaying some- 
thing like "Fault at 75 feet". If the cable passes the tester's diagnostics, this will also cer- 
ti@ that the cable is functioning properly. 
Punch Down (Impact)Tool 
You'll use an impact tool (commonly called a punch down tool) to connect Ethernet 
cabling to a wall jack using a series of metal pegs and wires. Punch down tools are pri- 
marily used for telephone cables and Token Ring connectors, since they cannot support 
CAT-5 Ethernet cables. For modern Ethernet cables, the punch down tool has been 
replaced by the patch panels that are installed in network wiring closets.You can see an 
example of a punch down tool in Figure 8.13. 
Figure 8.13 A Typical Punch Down Tool 
Tone Generator 
If you need to troubleshoot telephone connections when dealing with dial-up modems 
for a remote access connection, you may find yourself in need of a tone generator. This is 
either a piece of software or a hardware device that generates the tones that are used in a 
telephone system, including a dial tone, busy signal, and ring tone.You can plug a tone 
generator into a telephone jack to determine if the jack is functioning and able to make 
and receive calls.You can see a software-based tone generator in Figure 8.14.

Remote Connectivity Scenario 
In today's business world, users need access to their company network not only when 
they're on company premises, but also from home and when they're on the road. An 
important part of a network administrator's job is to design and implement a strategy for 
allowing authorized users to connect to network resources without compromising secu- 
rity. All of the server NOSs we've discussed in this chapter include technologies and fea- 
tures that make this easier. 
Even if your network is small, chances are you have a need for remote access, 
whether for traveling employees, telecommuters, or remote branches.You can choose 
from several methods of remote access, including dial-in access and VPN access through 
the Internet. Which methods you support and how you configure them will depend on 
the needs of your organization and its individual users. 
When you plan which types of remote access to allow, you should consider how 
they meet your organization's needs and the needs of the users, the expense and admin- 
istrative effort involved in implementing each one, and their relative levels of security. In 
this section we'll look in more detail at each one.

539 
Planning for Dial-In Access 
The traditional method of remote access uses a pool of modems and a server running a 
remote access service such as the Microsoft Routing and Remote Access (RRAS) service. 
Although there are alternatives, such as VPN access, modems still have some advantages: 
• 
Dedicated modem lines don't require encryption and communications are 
more difficult to intercept. This is because the connection is direct and does 
not go over a public data network. In addition, you can use security features 
available only in phone systems, such as caller ID verification and callback 
security. 
• 
Although modem access is slow, its speed is consistent and unaffected by 
Internet usage and other issues. Thus, it might be more reliable when high 
bandwidth is not needed. In some NOSs, you can also use a multilink feature 
to combine multiple modem links into a single faster connection.You can also 
use ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) modems for faster dial-in 
connections. ISDN lines are highly reliable and provide speeds of up to 
128Kbps, almost three times faster than typical analog modem connections. 
'i!~ '~ ~i 
T_ DAY TIP_. 
~i i iiiii i;!~ ...... You can use the Bandwidth Allocation Protocol (BAP)in conjunction with multi- 
~iiiiii~ 
link. BAP is used to manage multilink so that multiple connections 
are not 
wasted unnecessarily. Using BAP, a connection can automatically add and 
remove multilink connections as needed. 
• 
You might be able to use existing phone lines and modems rather than pur- 
chasing or configuring new equipment for VPN access. 
• 
Adding phone lines for clients is an expense, but additional clients do not 
increase the bandwidth load in an Internet connection. 
Dial-in access typically uses the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) for communication. 
This is an Internet-standard protocol for dial-in connections. PPP assigns an IP address, 
DNS server addresses, and other critical configuration elements to a remote access 
client.

-- 
i i)il Before PPP was developed, dial-up clients relied on the Serial Line Internet 
!iii i Protocol, or SLIR SLIPwas a much weaker protocol than PPP that transmitted 
the username and password in cleartext, rather than using any type of encryp- 
tion. While SLIP has largely been replaced by the more reliable and secure PPP, it 
is still used with some older equipment. Most remote access servers will support 
SLIP for backward compatibility, but you should not enable it for remote access 
connectivity unless absolutely necessary. 
Planning for VPN Access 
A VPN uses encryption to create a virtual connection, or tunnel, between a remote node 
and your network, using a public network such as the Internet.You can see an example 
of this in Figure 8.15. 
Figure 8.15 Tunneling Encrypted Traffic Over the Internet 
VPN Clien! 
VPN access has a number of advantages over dial-in remote access: 
• 
More bandwidth is available, assuming the client can obtain a broadband 
Internet connection or has a high-speed dedicated leased line. 
• 
The network can accept unlimited connections from clients through a single 
Internet connection, without the need to add equipment for additional clients. 

Network Operating Systems • Chapter 8 
541 
Clients and corporate networks often have existing Internet connections that 
can be adapted for VPN use with a minimum of effort and expense. 
A VPN connection is created through the use of a tunneling protocol, sometimes 
called a VPN protocol, supported by both the client and the server. Two of the more 
common VPN protocols are the Point to Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) and IPSec 
combined with L2TE (You'll often see this written as L2TP/IPSec.) L2TP/IPSec provides 
better security and performance than PPTP, and should be enabled wherever possible. 
~. 
,M WARNING 
Windows NT 4.0 remote access only supports PPTR L2TP/IPSec is supported by 
Windows 2000 Server and later. 
In a VPN, you can also control the ]eve] of encwption that is allowed for access. By 
disallowing unencwpted connections or those that use less secure enc~fpfion, you can 
decrease the risk of network snooping.You should mandate the strongest level of enc~p- 
tion that your clients will support, such as the 128-bit encryption offered by Triple DES 
(3DES). DES (Data Encryption Standard) encryption uses much weaker 56-bit encryption 
and should not be used unless absolutely necessary. While VPN access has more security 
risks associated with it because data is transmitted over a public network, most NOSs allow 
you to mandate encryption for VPN connections so that clients that do not support a 
minimum level of encryption will not be able to connect to your network. 
Choosing Remote Access Authentication Methods 
When a user attempts to connect to a remote access server, one or more protocols are 
used for authentication to verify the user's identity. After the user is authenticated, the 
remote access service can determine what resources the user is authorized to access. 
When you configure a remote access server, you can select which authentication 
methods will be allowed.You should choose authentication methods based on their rela- 
tive levels of security. Additionally, the methods you choose will depend on the client 
operating system and the authentication methods they support. Just like LAN clients 
need to have a protocol like TCP/IP in common with a server it is attempting to con- 
nect to, a remote access client must use an authentication protocol that is supported by the 
remote access server. 
A number of the available authentication methods use simple usernames and pass- 
words for authentication. The simplest of these is the Password Authentication Protocol 
(PAP). In PAP, the client transmits the user's password as unencrypted text. To ensure a 
secure network, you should disable PAP as well as the Shiva Password Encrypted 
Protocol (SPAP), another authentication protocol that transmits password information in 

542 
Chapter 8 * Network Operating Systems 
cleartext. Only the very oldest operating systems still require the use of PAP or SPAP; 
even clients as old as Windows 95 and 98 can support the stronger authentication mech- 
anisms described next. 
The Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) improves security by 
creating an encrypted challenge and enabling the client to create a response using the 
password. This avoids sending the password over the network. However, CHAP stores 
passwords using reversible encryption, and is therefore also considered insecure. MS- 
CHAP vl, Microsoft's adaptation of CHAR improves security but is superseded by the 
more secure MS-CHAP version 2. In addition to MS-CHAR you can also enable the 
Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) to allow authentication using a variety of dif- 
ferent methods. 
To ensure secure remote access, you should disable less-secure authentication 
methods. In Exercise 8.2, you can see how to disable these insecure authentication 
methods in Windows Server 2003.

Providing Remote Access for Microsoft Windows 
Microsoft Windows (NT 4.0, Windows 2000, and Windows Server 2003) provides a 
network infrastructure for interconnecting local and remote systems through RRAS. 
The Windows Server 2003 RRAS service provides interconnectivity for remote users 
and remote offices using dial-up or VPN access. Windows clients can use a traditional 
username and password to access an RRAS server, or you can configure additional secu- 
rity by using smart cards or biometric devices such as retina or fingerprint scanners.

IKemote Access in Novell NetWare 
Novell NetWare provides remote access using the Border Manager add-on; this func- 
tionality isn't built into the server NOS by default. Novell's VPN implementation inte- 
grates with the Novell eDirectory that we discussed in a previous section, in order to 
give remote and mobile employees secure access to network resources. Border Manager 
uses the built-in Novell Modular Authentication Services authentication mechanism, and 
allows remote users to authenticate using a username and password, smart cards, or dig- 
ital certificates.

Providing Remote Access for Linux Servers 
Linux servers can allow VPN access using both PPTP and L2TP/IPSec using a number 
of open-source firewall implementations. One of the most popular implantations is the 
FreeS/Wan IPSec distribution, available from http://www.freeswan.org.

1Remote Access in Mac OS X Server 
The Macintosh server NOS offers several options for remote access. OS X uses SSH 
connections for remote server administration and SSL for encrypted web access. In addi- 
tion, OS X provides support for L2TP encryption to create Virtual Private Network 
(VPN) connections for secure remote access to Macintosh networks. 
~ AppleShare IP 
AppleShare IP provides remote access to Macintosh clients using Apple Remote Access 
(ARA). ARA client software allows a Macintosh computer to connect to any AppleShare 
IP server that's running the AppleShare Remote Access service.ARA is backwards 
compatible to many older Macintosh operating systems, and can communicate using 
either TCP/IP or the proprietary AppleTalk protocol, and can communicate over an 
existing Internet connection or using a direct-dial modem installed in the AppleShare IP 
server itself.

Summary of Exam Objectives 
In Chapter 8, we looked at several popular breeds of the network operating system. The 
purpose of a NOS is to share files, printers and applications that can be accessed by mul- 
tiple clients over a local area network or remote access connection. The first NOS was 
the UNIX operating system used by many universities and research organizations, which 
has given rise to the open-source Linux operating system. UNIX and Linux are still in 
use today, and provide standards-based access to network services. After UNIX gained 
popularity in educational and research environments, Novell NetWare gained popularity 
for commercial use. The current version of NetWare uses TCP/IP as its default protocol, 
and offers Web-based administration utilities to create and manage network services, 
users and groups. Microsoft Windows offers its own NOS in Windows NT 4.0 and 
Active Directory, which use NTLM and Kerberos to authenticate LAN clients. The 
Windows NOS supports a wide array of business productivity, email, database and 
Enterprise 1Keso urc e Planning applications. 
We then discussed the requirements for a client computer to be able to connect to a 
:'~i'i !~,iiiiiiii!iii!iiii
network server to access shared resources, both for LAN connections as well as remote 
access connections. In order to communicate with a network server, a client must have a 
network interface card and any necessary cabling installed, or a wireless access point in 
the case of a wireless client.The client will also need to have the appropriate network

client software installed, and a configured network protocol that matches a protocol 
installed on the server. 
VPNs have become a major part of the information technology landscape.As net-

cation infrastructure, the need to connect remote users and offices has become 
increasingly more important. VPNs evolved as an extension of traditional dial-up net- 
working, and the VPN technologies used today evolved from the dial-up networking 
protocol PPR 
VPN authentication is built upon PPP. The various authentication protocols in use

vary in strength and features from PAP authentication with no encryption of passwords or 
usernames, to the Microsoft Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol version 2 (MS-

Q" You mention different levels of encryption. What difference does it make if you use 
stronger encryption? 
~" The strength of an encryption protocol is indicated by its bit number- 40-bit, 56-bit, 
128-bit. The bit number refers to the length of the encryption key. The more digits 
there are in a key, the longer it will take to guess the key by randomly trying dif- 
ferent combinations. Stronger encryption techniques make it more difficult to 
extract the clear-text password through brute-force attacks. In other words, the 
stronger the encryption, the longer it should take for an attacker to compromise the 
encrypted password if every possible combination of passwords is to be tried in a 
given scenario.

Q" Are PPTP and IPSec proprietary protocols? Do we need to use technologies sup- 
plied by only one company if we put PPTP or IPSec in place on our network? 
A" PPTP and IPSec are Internet standard protocols; however, Microsoft Routing and 
Remote Access (RRAS) has implemented its own version of PPTR It is recom- 
mended that you use L2TP/IPSec for VPN encryption if interoperability with non- 
Microsoft products is a concern. 
Q" What type of software do I need to connect my server to a broadband Internet con- 
nection like DSL or a cable modem? 
A: As long as your server NOS supports PPP-over-Ethernet (PPPoE), you should not 
need to install any additional software and your NOS should allow a direct connec- 
tion to your broadband modem. (Windows Server 2003, for example, supports PPoE 
natively.) If your NOS does not support PPoE, you will need to install proprietary 
software from your Internet Service Provider. 
Q: What is the difference between joining my PC to an Active Directory domain and 
putting it into a workgroup? 
A: If you do not join your PC to an Active Directory domain, you will not have a 
machine account in Active Directory.You will not be able to manage your PC from 
the domain. For example, Group Policy settings will not apply to your machine. In 
addition, you will not be able to log onto your PC with a domain user account. 
Domain user accounts can only log onto machines that are joined to an Active 
Directory domain.

Chapter 9 • Network Infrastructure and Security 
Introduction to Network Infrastructure 
In this chapter, we look at what a Network+ technician needs to know about network 
infrastructure. In Chapter 3, we discussed network devices such as routers, switches, 
hubs, and bridges. Here we'll expand on the technologies that we covered in Chapter 3 
and take a look at some more advanced network components, including firewalls, proxy 
servers, and demilitarized zones (DMZs). 
Figure 9.1 presents an illustration of the various network infrastructure concepts that 
you'll learn about in preparation for the Network+ exam.Afirewall sits at the edge of 
your corporate network, making decisions about what kinds of traffic should (and 
should not) be allowed to reach your internal hosts. A proxy seruer acts as a go-between 
to retrieve Web pages and other Internet resources for your internal clients as well as to 
cache Web content locally so that your clients can access it faster. Within the internal 
network, you can control network traffic through the use of virtual LANs (VLANs), 
which are implemented using network switches.Your internal users can access company 
information and share resources using an intranet, which is typically hosted on a Web 
server located in your company's internal network. To provide access to internal 
resources for external users such as vendors, business partners, and customers, you can 
deploy an extranet using Web browsers on the client end and secure tunnels such as vir- 
tual private networks (VPNs) or Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to protect your 
information as it travels over the Internet.

Understanding Firewalls 
Although you usually hear the word firewall in connection with computer networks, it 
actually started as a term used by architects and car manufacturers. In buildings or cars, a 
firewall is an actual physical wall, built from concrete or some other fire-resistant mate- 
rial, that's designed to slow the spread of a fire. In a car, the firewall is placed between 
the car's engine and the passenger seats so that the people inside the car will be pro- 
tected if the car's engine catches on fire.Just as physical firewalls are designed to stop the 
spread of fire, network firewalls are used to prevent unauthorized traffic from reaching 
inside a private network. 
It used to be fairly common for companies with Internet-connected computers to 
have no firewalls at all and merely rely on the security of the individual computers to 
protect their data. But as networks get larger and more complex, it becomes more diffi- 
cult to secure each individual host this way, so many companies today rely on a firewall 
as a sort of"border guard" protecting the perimeter of their networks from unautho- 
rized traffic.Your network perimeter (or edge) is the point on your network where you 
physically connect to a public network such as the Internet, much the way your front 
door serves as the entry to your house. Figure 9.2 illustrates the concept of deploying a 
firewall at the edge of your corporate network.

designed to provide several key services. The most essential functions of a firewall are: 
• 
IP address conservation 
As we discussed in Chapter 6,TCP/IP networks 
can use either public or private IP addressing schemes. Because public IP 
addresses are so scarce, many companies are given only a handful of them to 
use for their Internet-connected machines such as mail and Web servers. So as 
not to waste public IP addresses, these companies will then use private IP 
addresses for their internal networks and workstations. Using a firewall allows 
you to make this distinction so that machines on your network that are behind 
the firewall can use private IP addresses. (Remember that this includes 
addresses such as the 192.168.x.x and l O.x.x.x address spaces.)You can then 
assign a public IP address to any computer that you want to be accessible from 
the Internet, such as a Web server that needs to be accessed by customers or 
vendors outside your internal network. This way, you can create a local area 
network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN) that has full access to the 
Internet, even if you only have one public IP address.You'll do this by config- 
uring the computers that are behind your firewall to use private, nonroutable 
IP addresses. The firewall itself, along with any publicly accessible computers, 
can be configured with public, routable IP addresses. This process is also 
referred to as Network Address Translation (NAT). You should understand, how- 
ever, that a firewall does not necessarily need to provide NAT services to be 
considered a firewall. Still, many firewalls allow you to choose this feature.You 
can see an illustration of NAT in Figure 9.3.

~ Remember that the Internet is nothing more than many different computers 
i attached to a single global network. You can create a WAN connection between 
two groups of computers using the Internet or using a private connection, as 
you learned in Chapter 7, "WAN Standards and Remote Access Services." 
Traffic forwarding Many firewalls also act as touters so that one network 
(say, a private 10.100.100.0/24 network) can communicate with another net- 
work, such as the Internet.You can also use this feature to help control traffic 
between subnets on your internal network. 
Network differentiation Using a firewall is the best way to create a 
boundary between your internal network and any other network like the 
Internet. Because the firewall creates a clear distinction (or differentiation) 
between networks, it helps you managetraffic by making it easy to designate a 
particular host as internal or external.You can then create rules that govern how 
network traffic should be handled between internal machines as well as 
between internal and external machines. Figure 9.4 provides an example of 
how network differentiation works.

~!i0~iiM WARNING 
Remember that a firewall doesn't necessarily need to be deployed only between 
a private network and the Internet. In many cases, a company will deploy a fire- 
wall inside its network to further protect a sensitive area of the company, such 
~l~i~ as the research and development or payroll departments, from the rest of the 
~' 
internal network. Firewalls can even be run on other hosts, such as your wire- 
less systems, a home PC, or a corporate server. Routers today are even sold with 
a "firewall feature set" that allows you to turn on advanced filtering for poten- 
tial attacks. 
• 
Protection against denial of service (DOS), scanning, and sniffing 
attacks A firewall acts as a single point of entry to your network. Having a 
single point of entry creates the ability to monitor incoming and outgoing 
tra~c on your network and allows you to check that traffic for viruses as well 
as hackers' attempts to infiltrate your network.You can then configure your 
firewall to restrict or block any type of traffic that you choose. The drawback 
to this single point of entry is that it can create a "choke point" at the 
perimeter of your network that can slow performance and throughput. 
• 
IP and port filtering This is where we really begin to see the power of a 
firewall to restrict traffic on your network. A firewall can filter, or restrict, 
TCP/IP traffic based on the IP address of the machine that's sending the traffic 
as well as the TCP or UDP port that's being used to send information. This fil- 
tering function gives a firewall the ability to allow or reject a connection based 
on IP address and port; this is what most people in IT commonly think of 
when they hear the wordfirewall.This filtering process is done using packetfil- 
ters, which we talk about later in the chapter. For example, a very basic packet 
filter can block traffic to your network if it originates from a particular 
external IP address and port. Packet filtering can become a complex process 
because a firewall can filter traffic based on its source and its destination. 
• 
Authentication and encryption A firewall also has the ability to authenti- 
cate users as well as encrypt transmissions between your private network and 
another network that's connected to the Internet. 
• 
Traffic logging One of the most important~though commonly ignored-- 
benefits of a firewaH is that it allows you to examine aH details about network 
packets that pass through it. By paying attention to your log files, you can be 
alerted to hackers attempting to scan or gain access to your network, as well as 
monitoring access to your network by legitimate users. 
An important thing to keep in mind about firewalls is that they aren't meant to pro- 
vide every single security function that's needed on your network.You can and should 

Network Infrastructure and Security • Chapter 9 
563 
install other systems that handle user authentication, intrusion detection, and remote 
access services such as VPN. At the end of the day, the firewall serves an important but 
very specific role on your network: to monitor incoming traffic and decide who should 
be let in and who should be kept out. Other functions such as remote access and intru- 
sion detection, although crucial to the overall security of your network, should be kept 
separate from the firewall so that it can be dedicated to acting as your network's "gate- 
keeper." By combining these various devices to create several layers of protection for 
your network, you can create defense in depth, which is a critical concept when it comes 
to network security. 
Introducing Firewall Concepts 
When discussing the security that's provided by network firewalls, it's important to keep in 
mind some of the fundamentals of the network. We use the confidentiality, integrity, and avail- 
ability (CIA) triad model as a starting point in talking about network security. This CIA 
triad provides you with a model to evaluate your network's security. For instance, the first 
leg of the CIA triad calls for confidentiality. One of the methods you can use to provide 
confidentiality for your network resources is to use a proxy server or a firewall as well as 
Network Address Translation (NAT) between an outside (untrusted) network and your 
internal (trusted) network. In this scenario, a firewall protects the confidentiality of your 
resources by separating the two types of network from each other and limiting users from 
the untrusted network in their attempts to view your internal networks.

from different network segments. 
Identifying Risks to Network Transmissions 
When deploying a firewall, you need to be aware of the kinds of threats for which your 
network is at risk. A firewall can help you maintain the security of the network services 
that you provide to your users and business. With the growth of the Internet as a means 
for business communication, it's become normal for a company to provide e-mail, Web, 
secure online purchasing, and other services directly to individuals and companies, both 
inside and outside the LAN. Some of the risks to your network services that a firewall 
can protect you from include: 
• 
DoS attacks 
• 
Unauthorized use of services 
[] 
E-mail relaying ("spam")

Firewall Definitions and History 
As we continue our introduction to the fundamentals of network firewalls, let's discuss 
some of the terminology and definitions that are related to our work with firewalls and 
their components. Before we proceed to a more in-depth discussion of the firewall, we 
need to go over definitions of some terminology as well as a brief history of firewalls. 
Let's start out with some common terms that we'll use throughout this section. Table 9.1 
details and defines some of the important terms that relate to firewalls. 
Table 9.1 DMZ Definitions

Definition or Description

(untrusted host) 
Firewall 
In computer networks, a demilitarized zone, or DMZ, is a 
computer host or small network inserted as a "neutral 
zone" between a company's private network and the out- 
side public network. The DMZ prevents outside users from 
getting direct access to a server that has company data. 
(The term comes from the geographic buffer zone that was 
set up between North Korea and South Korea following the 
United Nations "police action" in the early 1950s.) A DMZ 
is an optional and more secure approach to a firewall and 
effectively acts as a proxy server. 
A machine (usually a server) located in the DMZ with strong 
host-level protection and minimal services. It is used as a 
gateway between the inside and the outside of networks. 
The bastion host is normally not the firewall, but a separate 
machine that is often used as a distraction to lure hackers 
away from more critical network resources. The notation 
"untrusted host" may be used because the bastion host is 
always considered to be potentially compromised and 
therefore should not be fully trusted by internal network 
clients. 
A hardware device or software package that provides fil- 
tering and/or rules to allow or deny specific types of net- 
work traffic to flow between internal and external 
networks.

Definition or Description 
An application-based translation of network access 
requests. Provision for local user authentication for access 
to untrusted network. Logging and control of port/protocol 
access may be possible. Normally used to connect two net- 
works. 
A network service that translates private IP addresses (like 
those on the 10.0.01x network) to a public IP address. This 
service is used to share a small number of public IP 
addresses with a large number of internal clients. 
A technology that u.ses a set of rules that will open or close 
ports to specific protocols (such as allowing Transmission 
Control Protocol [TCP] or User Datagram Protocol [UDP] 
packets) or protocol ID(s), such as allowing or blocking 
Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP). 
The use of a process to inspect packets as they reach the 
firewall and maintain the state of the connection by 
allowing or disallowing packets to pass based on the access 
policy. 
This is an isolated network containing hosts that need to 
be accessible from both the untrusted external network 
and the internal network. An example is placing a bastion 
host in a dual-firewall network, with the bastion host in the 
network between the firewalls. A screened subnet is often 
a part of a DMZ implementation. 
The use of a firewall and its overall design and implementation can be relatively 
simple or extremely complex, depending on the needs of the particular business or net- 
work system. Network firewalls are used as a way to separate private and public net- 
works; the need for this separation became more acute when we began to provide more 
access to network services for individuals outside the traditional LAN. 
When you're working with a firewall, there are a number of ways that you can con- 
figure traffic to flow between the internal network and the external network. In addi- 
tion to the basic configuration you've already seen, you can add network hosts, such as a 
bastion host, to increase your network's security, as shown in Figure 9.5.

Figure 9.6 shows a network configuration that consists of two firewalls. In this 
arrangement, network hosts located on the screened subnet can be protected from outside 
threats while allowing connections to or from the internal network. This configuration is 
common in larger network implementations, where you need to host more than one 
computer on the screened subnet.

Packet Filters 
In its most basic form, a packet Jilter makes decisions about whether to forward a TCP/IP 
packet based on the the IP, TCP, or UDP information it finds contained within the 
www.syngress.com 

Network Infrastructure and Security • Chapter 9 
567 
packet. In this way, packet filtering (and firewalls in general) make routing decisions 
based on the contents of the packets that are received. However, a packet filter only han- 
dles individual packets; it doesn't keep track of any ongoing TCP sessions, such as a ses- 
sion between a client workstation and a Web application. For this reason, a basic packet 
filter is poorly equipped to handle some types of network attacks. For instance, packet 
filters have difficulty dealing with spoofed packets, which are network packets that come 
in through an outside interface pretending to be part of the internal network.You can 
configure packet filters to allow or block traffic according to source and destination IP 
addresses, source and destination ports, and the type of protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP, and 
SO on). 
So what is the advantage of a packet filter if it does not protect your network 
against spoofing attacks? The primary benefit of a packet filter is speed. Since it does not 
have to do any inspection of application data, a packet filter can operate nearly as fast as 
a router. However, the packet filter concept has been improved to include the ability to 
monitor the state of an application, as we'll see in the next section. 
Stateful Inspection Packet Filters 
The concept of stateful inspection came about in an effort to improve on the capabilities 
and security of regular packet filters, without impacting on their ability to process 
packets quickly. A packet filter with stateful inspection is able to keep track of network 
sessions through the use of a connection table. Every time an internal client makes a 
request to an outside address, the IP of the internal machine is placed in this connection 
table. When the stateful packet filter receives a TCP packet from the outside, it can look 
at the destination of this external packet and try to match it up against the entries in the 
connection table. If it finds a match, the stateful packet filter will allow the packet 
through. Otherwise, the packet gets dropped. Entries in the connection table are auto- 
matically timed out after a certain period of time. In the case of an FTP connection, for 
example, the server that the user connects to on port 21 will initiate a data connection 
back on port 20 when a file download is requested. If the firewall hasn't kept track of 
the FTP control connection that was initially established, it won't allow the connection 
back in on port 20. This concept also applies to many of the newer multimedia proto- 
cols such as 1KealAudio and NetMeeting. 
As you'll recall from Chapter 6, TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, whereas 
UDP is connectionless. So it would seem impossible for a stateful packet filter to be able 
to process UDP packets, since they do not maintain state from one packet to the next. 
But statefulness can also be applied to UDP communication, after a fashion. In the case 
of UDP, the firewall creates an entry in the connection table when the first UDP packet 
is transmitted. A UDP packet from a less secure network (a response) will be accepted 
only if there's a corresponding entry in the connection table.

Chapter 9 • Network Infrastructure and Security 
Application Layer Filtering 
Stateful inspection packet filters remain the speed kings of firewalls and are the most 
flexible where new protocols are concerned, but they are sometimes less secure than 
application proxies. As the name implies, an application proxy firewall acts as a "go- 
between" for user network sessions. User-initiated connections actually terminate at the 
proxy, and the proxy initiates a separate connection to the destination host. In an appli- 
cation proxy, connections are analyzed all the way up to the application layer to deter- 
mine if they are allowed. It is this characteristic that gives proxies a higher level of 
security than packet filters, stateful or otherwise. 
Figure 9.7 shows how packet processing is handled at the application layer before it 
is passed on or blocked. However, this additional processing means that application 
proxies don't have quite the same speed as packet filters, since packet filters only need to 
examine network traffic as far as the transport layer.

One potentially significant limitation of application proxies is that, as new applica- 
tion protocols are implemented, corresponding proxies need to be developed to handle 
them. This means that you could be at the mercy of your vendor if a hot new video 
multicasting technology is introduced, for example, but there is no proxy for it.

Examples of proxy-based firewalls include Gauntlet from Secure Computing 
(acquired from Network Associates) and Symantec 1Kaptor (also known as Enterprise 
Firewall). 
Firewall Interfaces" Inside, Outside, and DMZ 
In its most basic form, a firewall has just two network interfaces: inside and outside. 
These labels refer to the level of trust you have in the network that's attached to the par- 
ticular interface. In almost all cases, the outside interface is connected to an untrusted 
network (often the Internet), and the inside interface is connected to the trusted net- 
work. For a firewall deployed within an internal network, the interface referred to as 
"outside" can be connected to the company's Internet backbone.Although this connec- 
tion is probably not as untrusted as the Internet, it's still more vulnerable and therefore 
less trustworthy than a more controlled subnet. For example, you can deploy a firewall 
within your company's internal network to separate your payroll department from the 
rest of the network. In this case, the Payroll subnet would be considered the inside net- 
work, and the connection to the rest of the network would be the outside network. 
As your company's need for Internet-based resources becomes more complex, you 
could find some limitations in having only two interfaces for your network. For 
example, where would you put a Web server for your customers? If you place it outside 
the firewall, the Web server will be fully exposed to attacks on the outside network. In 
this case, you're forced to rely on the security of the Web server itself. Another possi- 
bility with a two-interface firewall is to place the Web server on the internal network, 
on the same side of the firewall as your internal network clients. The firewall would be 
configured to allow Web traffic on port 80 and port 443 for SSL to pass through the 
firewall to the IP address of the Web server. This configuration will prevent an outsider 
from directly accessing your Web server. But what happens if the outsider is able to 
compromise your Web server through port 80 and gain administrative access to the 
server? At this point, you have a compromised machine residing on your internal net- 
work, and the hacker will be free to launch attacks from your Web server on any other 
host in your internal network, with no restrictions. 
The solution is to create a network design that supports multiple interfaces on your 
firewall, as most commercial systems now do. This solution allows you to create an inter- 
mediate zone that's neither inside nor outside your network. These intermediary zones 
are referred to as demilitarized zones, or DMZs. Machines that reside on a DMZ network 
will be protected from outside users by one firewall while still separated from the 
internal network, so access to your internal clients will be protected as well. Figure 9.8 
illustrates a typical DMZ layout.

Some companies even implement multiple DMZs, each with a different business 
purpose and corresponding level of trust. For example, one DMZ segment could con- 
tain only servers for public access, whereas another could host servers just for business 
partners or customers. This approach allows you to create a granular level of control as 
well as simplifying administration of your network. 
Using Network Address Translation 
tkFC 1918,"Address Allocation for Private Internets," specifies certain IP address ranges 
that can only be used on private networks and are not routed across the Internet. These 
reserved ranges are: 
10.0.0.0-10.255.255.255 
(10/8 prefix) 
172.16.0.0-172.31.255.255 
(172.16/12 prefix) 
192.168.0.0-192.168.255.255 (192.168/16 prefix) 
Because these addresses are private, they do not need to be unique.Your company 
can use the 10.0.0.0/8 network for its internal computers, and another company across 
town can use the same private IP address range without causing any conflicts. The pri- 
mary reason for setting aside these private address ranges was a fear that we were run- 
ning out of IP addresses. By using these address ranges for private networks, we are able 
to conserve public IP addresses for situations where they are really needed. 
But if these addresses are not routable over the Internet, how do you access the Web 
from a private network? The source IP of such a connection would be a private address, 

Network Infrastructure and Security • 
Chapter 9 
571 
and the user's connection attempt would just be dropped before it got very far. This is 
where NAT comes into play. Most organizations connected to the Internet use NAT to 
hide their internal addresses from the global Internet. This serves as a basic security mea- 
sure that can make it a bit more difficult for an external attacker to map out the internal 
network. NAT is typically performed on the Internet firewall and takes two forms, static 
or dynamic. When NAT is performed, the firewall rewrites the source and/or the desti- 
nation addresses in the IP header, replacing them with translated addresses. This process 
is configurable. 
In the context of address translation, inside refers to the internal, private network. 
Outside is the greater network to which the private network connects (typically the 
Internet). Within the inside address space, addresses are referred to as local addresses that 
get translated to global addresses. These inside global addresses are visible from the 
Internet and can be routed accordingly. When a client on an internal network needs to 
access a resource on the Internet, NAT will translate one of these local addresses to a 
global address. NAT will use either static or dynamic address translation to translate 
between these local and global addresses. 
Static Address Translation 
In static NAT, a permanent one-to-one mapping gets established between a local and a 
global address. This method is useful when you have a small number of inside hosts that 
require access to the Internet and have enough global addresses so that each internal 
client can have their own corresponding global address. When a NAT router or firewall 
receives a packet from an inside host, it looks to see if there is a matching source address 
entry in its static NAT table. If there is, it replaces the local source address with the 
global source address and then forwards the packet. Replies from the outside destination 
host are simply translated in reverse and routed onto the inside network. 
Static translation is also useful to translate outside communications that get initiated 
to an inside host~if you have a Web server located on your internal network, for 
example. In this situation, an outside machine sends a packet with a global destination 
address, which the NAT router translates into the appropriate local address.You can see 
an example of static NAT in Figure 9.9, where each local inside address (192.168.0.10, 
192.168.0.11, and 192.168.0.12) has a matching global inside address (10.0.1.10, 
10.0.1.11, and 10.0.1.12, respectively).

Dynamic Address Translation 
The disadvantage of static NAT is that it uses up quite a few public IP addresses, and it's 
not effective if you have dozens or hundreds of internal clients, with only one or two 
public IP addresses. In this case, it's much more effective to use dynamic NAT transla- 
tion. When dynamic NAT is set up, you define a pool of inside addresses to be used for 
outbound translation. When the NAT router or firewall receives a packet from an inside 
host and dynamic NAT is configured, it selects the next available address from this 
address pool and maps the address to one of the available public IPs. Dynamic NAT dif- 
fers from static NAT because these address mappings can change for each new network 
connection that's requested.Also, only those internal machines that request external 
resources will be placed into the translation table. 
Recognizing Popular Firewalls 
There are many players in the firewall market, and naming and describing them all could 
easily turn into a chapter in itself. Although you won't be expected to be able to con- 
figure individual firewalls for the Network+ exam, it's helpful to recognize the more 
common models in case they come up as an example. Firewalls for a corporate network 
are usually hardware devices that run a dedicated operating system, but you can install 
software-based firewalls as well. Table 9.2 introduces some of the major vendors of fire- 
walls and whether they are hardware or software based.

As you can see, the Microsoft, Novell, and Symantec firewall products fall into the 
software category, whereas the other vendors in the table produce hardware-based fire- 
walls.The Check Point firewall falls into both categories:You can install a software-based 
Check Point firewall onto a Windows or UNIX machine, or you can purchase a dedi- 
cated hardware device that runs the Check Point firewall. 
Hardware-Based Firewalls 
A typical hardware-based firewall uses packet filtering or stateful packet filtering to make 
decisions about what types of traffic to allow or block. Hardware solutions are available 
for networks of all sizes. For example, some 3Com products focus on small business and 
home office users, whereas the Cisco PIX comes in configurations that support up to 
250,000 connections. 
Hardware-based firewalls are often referred to as firewall appliances. A disadvantage of 
hardware-based firewalls is the proprietary nature of the software they run. Another dis- 
advantage of many of these products, such as Cisco's highly respected PIX, is the high 
cost. The advantage of hardware-based firewalls is that they tend to be faster and more 
secure than software-based firewalls, since the hardware appliance is dedicated to run- 
ning only the firewall software and nothing else. In this section, we'll look at some of 
the common hardware-based firewalls available today.

is to harden (or secure) the operating system that the firewall is installed on. 
This will prevent malicious attackers from bypassing the firewall by exploiting a 
software vulnerability of the underlying OS.

The Cisco PIX Firewall 
The Cisco PIX firewall is designed to meet the needs of small or home networks to 
enterprise-sized networks. The PIX provides various types of users with the same secu- 
rity level and features, but performance is increased with the larger PIX appliance. The 
PIX can support many users, and most PIX models have VPN support. Depending on 
the model, the PIX might have a fixed chassis that cannot be upgraded to support addi- 
tional interfaces, whereas other PIX models may support many network interfaces. 
Some key features of the PIX firewall include the following: 
• 
A user license supports a limited amount of internal IP addresses to access the 
Internet simultaneously, and the DHCP server feature supports a fixed number 
of DHCP address assignments. Depending on the model, this may be unlim- 
ited. 
• 
Various levels of clear-text throughput, from 10Mbps to 1Gbps. 
• 
Various types of hardware, including rack-mountable, also have many different 
types of network card support fixed for a small office. 
• 
Optional encryption licenses, which are required if 168-bit 3DES or 56-bit 
DES VPN tunnels are used. 
• 
An unlimited number of VPN users. 
• 
URL filtering, which can limit the URLs that can be accessed by particular 
users based on a policy defined by the network administrator or a security 
policy. 
• 
Content filtering, which can block ActiveX or Java applets, regardless of the 
source or destination address. 
Cisco PIX firewalls run a proprietary operating system similar to the one used by 
Cisco routers and switches. Because the PIX OS is designed solely for the purpose of 
operating a firewall, it doesn't share the same vulnerabilities as a software-based firewall 
running on Windows or UNIX. 
Nokia Firewall 
The Nokia hardware platform comes with a hardened FreeBSD operating system out of 
the box. Nokia firewalls are rack-mountable and are easily maintained by using the same 
firewall software as the Check Point family of firewalls. 
Check Point FW- 1 
Check Point firewalls have a large and powerful feature set that have made them quite 
popular with larger enterprise networks. The firewalls include most of the features that 
you would expect from a standard firewall package, including stateful packet filtering, 
NAT capabilities, and the ability to protect multiple network segments. More powerful 

Network Infrastructure and Security • Chapter 9 
575 
Check Point firewalls can even be configured to provide failover services in the event of 
loss of one firewall. 
Software-Based Firewalls 
In addition to firewall appliances, there are various firewall software applications you can 
install on a regular computer running a standard operating system such as Sun Solaris, 
Windows, or Linux. Most of these software-based packages use either stateful packet 
inspection or application layer filtering to make filtering decisions. Some of these soft- 
ware pieces also function as other applications as well; Microsoft ISA server, for example, 
can serve as both a firewall and a proxy server. (We talk more about proxy servers in 
another section.) 
Microsoft ISA Server 
MicrosoR~ Internet Security and Acceleration (ISA) Server is a pretty comprehensive 
product, used for firewaHing, content filtering, NAT (covered in the previous section), 
and more. It~ meant to be used as an all-in-one security package, offering an application 
layer firewaH, VPN server, and Web caching to improve client Web browsing perfor- 
mance. Because ISA Server is an application layer firewaH, it performs a much fuller 
inspection of network traffic than a simple packet layer firewaH and so can detect threats 
that packet-filtering software might miss. The following code shows the kind of detailed 
information that ISA Server examines before making a decision to allow or r~ect a par- 
ticular network packet rather than simply looking at the TCP or UDP port being used:

IP Chains and IP Tables 
The Linux operating system uses IP Chains and IP Tables to create rules controlling net- 
work access to and from a particular machine or network. Like other components of the 
Linux operating system, IP Chains is freely available software that you can install on an 
existing Linux machine. Installing and configuring IP Chains or IP Tables requires some 
previous knowledge of the Linux operating system as well as an understanding of how 
to write UNIX shell scripts.You won't be expected to know the ins and outs of actually 
configuring IP Chains, but you should recognize the name and know that it's used as a 
software-based firewall for Linux and UNIX systems. The following code listing will 
give you an idea of what a sample IP Tables configuration script might look like. The 
lines that start with a pound sign (#) are comments. 
# Disable response to ping. 
~bin~echo "i" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/icmp_echo_ignore_all 
# Disable response to broadcasts.

# Don't accept source routed packets. Attackers can use source routing to 
generate 
# traffic pretending to be from inside your network, but which is routed back

# network. Source routing is rarely used for legitimate purposes.

IP Security Protocol 
The IP Security (IPSec) protocol is an extension of TCP/IP (covered in Chapter 7) that 
allows you to build some security features directly into TCP/IP network packets. IPSec 
allows you to perform many typical firewall features such as packet filtering on IP traffic 
that's being routed to a particular machine, as well as more advanced security features 
such as enabling digital signatures for TCP/IP traffic. Using digital signatures, you can 
mandate that any TCP/IP traffic on an IPSec network must be encrypted before it's 
transmitted. This provides a way to encapsulate TCP/IP data to keep it safe while it's 
being transmitted. Although the primary purpose of IPSec is to provide these digital sig- 
natures for network traffic, it can also be used to create a simple firewall on Windows 
2000 and Windows Server 2003. 
Creating an IPSec Ruleset 
You won't be expected to configure individual firewalls for the Network+ exam, but it's 
helpful to see one in action to get a good sense of what's going on. In Exercise 9.1, we 
walk through the steps of configuring a firewall in Windows 2000 using IPSec. Even if 
this doesn't all make sense because you haven't worked with Windows 2000 before, try 
to follow along to see how IPSec is being used as a software-level firewall in this case.

CONFIGURING A WINDOWS FIREWALL USING I PSEc 
1. Click Start I Administrative Tools I Active Directory Users & 
Computers. 
2. Right-click your domain and select Properties. 
3. Go to the Group Policy tab and select the default Domain Policy. 
Select Edit. 
4. Navigate to Computer Configuration I Windows Settings I 
Security Settings I IP Security Policies.

Chapter 9 • Network Infrastructure and Security 
5. Right-click IP Security Policies and select Create IP Security Policy. 
Click Next to bypass the initial Welcome screen. 
6. Give your IP Security policy a name and a description, and then click 
Next. 
7. The next screen gives you the option to enable the Default Response 
Rule. In Windows 2000, the Default Response Rule attempts to 
enable secure communications with any machine that requests a 
connection. It's usually a good idea to leave this enabled in most 
settings. Click Next to continue. 
8. The next screen asks you to specify the authentication method that 
the Default Response Rule should use. Click Next to accept the 
default authentication method, which is Kerberos. 
, 
10. 
Click Next again to begin creating a new firewall rule. 
To create a new rule, click Add, and then click Next to bypass the 
initial Welcome screen. 
11. Your first question involves IP tunneling. You can configure IPSec in 
tunneling mode for a VPN or transport mode for all other communi- 
cation types. Leave it at transport mode and click Next to continue. 
12. Next you'll configure whether you want the IPSec encryption to 
apply to all network interfaces, the LAN interface only, or to remote 
access connections. In most cases, you'll want to apply your IPSec 
policy to all network connections. Select All network interfaces and 
click Next to continue. 
13. 
14. 
Next you'll select the IP filter list that this policy should apply to. The 
default filter lists are "All ICMP Traffic" and "All IP Traffic." Let's create 
a new filter list to look for traffic on port 6667, since that's the 
default port for the Internet Relay Chat (IRC) protocol and a well- 
known transport mechanism for worms and other malicious code. 
Click Add to create a new IP filter list. Give it a name and a descrip- 
tion, then get rid of the check mark next to Use Add Wizard to con- 
figure a new filter without the wizard. Click Add again to configure 
a specific IP filter. You'll see the screen shown in Figure 9.10. 

Network Infrastructure and Security • Chapter 9 
579 
Figure 9.10 IP Filter Properties 
15. When you're configuring an IP filter, you have three tabs: Addresses, 
Protocol, and Description. As you can see in Figure 9.10, you have a 
number of options for configuring the Source and Destination IP 
addresses. The Protocol tab will then let you choose the specific 
TCP/IP protocol that this filter should apply to. Configure a filter with 
the following properties: 
Source IP Address: Any 
Destination IP Address: My IP address 
Protocol: TCP, Destination Port 6667 
16. Once you've finished configuring the IP filter, click OK until you're 
back at the screen shown in Step 3. 
17. Your next step will be to configure a filter action~what the firewall 
will actually do when it encounters traffic on TCP port 6667. Select 
the IP Filter List you just created, and click Next. 
18. Click Add to configure a filter action. Select the option to Block 
traffic that meets the parameters of this IP Filter, and select OK. 
You've now configured an IPSec policy that you can use as a software- 
based firewall on any Windows 2000 or 2003 machine.

Personal Firewall Software 
One type of firewall software model that is increasing in popularity is the personal fire- 
wall. In this case, you'll have firewall software loaded on each individual workstation 
instead of having one big firewall at the perimeter of your network. This is a popular 
choice for home-based PCs, especially with the increased popularity of DSL and other 
"always on" home Internet connections. In Exercise 9.2, we'll enable the personal fire- 
wall in Windows XP Professional.

work card installed. To enable the Windows firewall for both of 
these connections, you would need to follow these instructions 
twice--once for each connection listed in the Network Connections 
applet. 
3. Click the Advanced tab, and place a check mark next to Protect my 
computer and network by limiting or preventing access to this 
computer from the Internet. 
4. Click Settings to customize the behavior of the Windows firewall. 
On the Exceptions tab (shown in Figure 9.12) you can see the appli- 
cations that the Windows firewall has been configured to allow. You 
have the option to add a new program to the list of "allowed" 
applications, to add a new TCP or UDP port, or to edit or delete an 
existing entry in the "allowed" list.

5. Click OK when you've finished configuring the Windows firewall. 
Until now, personal firewalls were a bit rarer in corporate settings because each indi- 
vidual workstation would need to have the firewall configured individually. In an 
attempt to make this technology more appealing to a corporate network, Microsoft has 
included a personal firewall in Windows XP Service Pack 2 that can be centrally config- 
ured by a network administrator. This gives you the additional security of a firewall sit- 
ting on each individual workstation while allowing you to manage and configure the 
firewall settings of each workstation from a single administrative workstation. 
Configuring and Implementing Firewalls 
Implementing firewalls on any network is always a work in progress.You always need to 
stay flexible and on your toes to keep your network protection levels up to date and 
effective. This requires a certain amount of ongoing effort so that your system's security 
is always as high as you can make it while still allowing users and clients to access the 
necessary resources on your network. In deploying a firewall, you shouldn't be intimi- 
dated by the apparent complexity of it: All it really boils down to is determining what 
types of traffic should and should not be permitted to enter your internal network. In 
this section, we'll look at implementing firewalls for a corporate network, paying partic- 
ular attention to the design process. Once you've determined the overall design of your 
firewall implementation, you can then turn your attention to deploying specific firewall 
hardware and software.

Why the Design Process Is So Important 
Designing your firewall implementation is critical to the overall protection of your 
internal network.Your firewall design can incorporate VPN traffic, Web traffic, extranet 
and employee connections, and public access to information provided by your organiza- 
tion. It's important to realize that you can't really design a firewall without a clear vision 
of what you're trying to protect. Will your firewall be protecting a handful of servers 
that provide basic services to your network? Will it be protecting the entirety of your 
internal network and its resources? Or somewhere in the middle? To determine this, you 
must understand the needs of your company, the role that the firewall will play in your 
overall network infrastructure, the type of traffic it will support, and any plans your 
company has for future growth. 
For example, let's say that, as the network architect for a small company, you are 
given the task of creating a security solution to protect your infrastructure, your data, 
and your internal clients while providing external access to a company Web site. The 
company already has Internet connectivity via a dial-up connection, and now you need 
to create an Internet presence for your Web server while protecting your internal net- 
work resources.You need to begin gathering information, starting with the current envi- 
ronment and the requirements for the upgrade.You can see an illustration of this layout 
in Figure 9.13.

Chapter 9 • Network Infrastructure and Security 
The site will be a scalable server environment with a single Web/application 
server and a database server. 
The infrastructure currently in place is not capable of supporting the new Web 
site. 
The site is estimated to reach 10,000 hits and 1000 transactions a day at first 
and then grow steadily. 
With this information ready, you now need to ask some more questions so that you 
can move on to designing a solution: 
• 
How much Internet bandwidth is required to support the site? 
• 
What kind of security is needed? Will there be a need for both Web traffic and 
SSL traffic? 
®t~i .... ~:~::~'":i!~ 
~':: 
~iii'~*iii;~lii~~M DAY TIP 
~iN~l~i~,: Remember that the SSk protocol is used to secure Web traffic and operates on 
~N~i~ TC P port 443. 
• 
Does the site require high availability? (We'll be talking more about high avail- 
ability and disaster recovery concepts in Chapter 10.) 
• 
What are the connectivity requirements among the internal network, the 
Web/application server, and the database server? 
• 
What is the budget for the firewall? 
These are not the only questions that you should ask when designing a firewall, of 
course, but this list should give you a good starting point to help you gather enough 
information to create a firewall design to protect your internal network and resources. 
Your web developers and business managers come back to you with the answers to 
these questions. Since the site will only receive 10,000 hits and 1000 transactions a day, 
you will initially acquire a single T1 line; as the site grows, you'll add more bandwidth. 
Since the site will be processing credit card transactions, both HTTP (TCP port 80) and 
SSL (TCP port 443) need to be allowed to access the Web/application server from the 
Internet.Your product database should only be accessed by the internal LAN and should 
respond to Web/application server requests for information. Finally, all Web servers and 
switches are 100Mbps full-duplex-capable devices. 
From this information, you can now start to plan, install, and document your firewall 
solution. Analyzing the requirements, you decide that you will create a DMZ with a 
firewall on each side that will offer you the most secure and scalable solution. This DMZ 
allows you to separate the Web server into a firewalled network segment to allow for 
www.syngress.com 

Network Infrastructure and Security • Chapter 9 
585 
greater security. The DMZ will contain the Web server, and your internal network will 
contain the database servers. Because users will only access the Web server, you'll con- 
figure firewall rules so that the DMZ is only accessible from the outside network via 
TCP port 80 (HTTP) and the SSL port, TCP port 443.Your internal network will not 
allow unsolicited connectivity from the Internet; it will use stateful packet filtering to 
respond only to requests made for data by the Web server or originating from the 
internal LAN. Separating the Web server from your internal network allows for greater 
security in the event the Web/application server is compromised by an intruder, while 
the second firewall will still protect the Web server from external threats. Figure 9.14 
shows the final result of your firewall planning.

Designing Your Firewall to Protect Your TCP/IP Clients 
The current implementation of the TCP/IP protocol suite, IP version 4 (or IP v4, for 
short) contains a number of well-documented flaws that affect the design of both your 
security plan and your firewall implementation. Some of these problems have been cor- 
rected in IP version 6, but since implementation of this technology still isn't widespread, 

586 
Chapter 9 • Network Infrastructure and Security 
you need to protect your network against the weaknesses of the existing protocols when 
you implement your firewall design. 
.... ~iiiliiiiiiiiiii! 
The newest version of the IP protocol, commonly called IPv6, makes several 
improvements over the existing implementation, IPv4. The most noticeable 
improvement is the number of IP addresses that are available in version 6. In 
......... ~ the new version of IP, we move from a 32-bit addressing scheme in IPv4 to a 
128-bit address space in IPv6. In moving to a 128-bit address space, we've gone 
from having 4 billion IP addresses available to around 1033 possible 
addresses--an improvement of several orders of magnitude. IPv6 also includes 
many built-in security measures that make it more inherently secure than the 
current implementation of TCP/IR 
You can read more about IPv6 in RFC 2460, available at 
www. ietf. o rg/rfc/rfc 2460. txt. 
Therefore, you need to plan against certain known weaknesses in IP v4: 
• 
Data that is sent in clear-text packets, especially passwords and other sensitive 
information that can be easily "sniffed" or captured on your network and 
exploited 
• 
Vulnerabilities to DoS from SYN attacks 
• 
IP spoofing 
• 
Forged packets created by sequence guessing; refer back to Chapter 6 for more 
information on TCP/IP sequence numbering and windowing 
• 
Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks 
• 
Lack of authentication 
The design that you create for your firewall needs to accommodate the weaknesses 
of the IP protocol and to provide the necessary protection to prevent these types of 
attacks. To accomplish this, you need to implement protection against these attacks using 
IPSec and other types of safeguards.

Network Infrastructure and Security • 
Chapter 9 
587 
Understanding TCP/IP Vulnerabilities 
To protect your network from intruders, you should have an understanding of the types 
of attack that TCP/IP is vulnerable to. In this section, we discuss some of the more 
common types of hack attacks: 
• 
DoS attacks 
• 
Scanning and spoofing 
• 
Source routing and other protocol exploits 
• 
Software and system exploits 
When you have a basic understanding of how these types of attack work, you will 
be better prepared to guard against them. 
In this section, we use the words attacker, intruder, or hacker to refer to a 
person who compromises the security of a network by gaining unauthorized 
access or who compromises the accessibility of a network by preventing autho- 
r,,, rized access. 
Denial-of-Service (DOS) Attacks 
In February 2000, massive DoS attacks brought down several of the biggest Web sites, 
includingYahoo.com and Buy.com. DoS attacks are one of the most popular choices for 
Internet hackers who want to disrupt a network's operations. Although they do not 
destroy or steal data as some other types of attack do, the objective of DoS attackers is to 
bring down a network, denying service to its legitimate users. DoS attacks are easy to 
initiate; software that will allow anyone to launch a DoS attack with little or no tech- 
nical expertise is readily available from hacker Web sites. 
The purpose of a DoS attack is to render a network inaccessible by generating a 
type or amount of network traffic that will crash the servers, overwhelm the routers, or 
otherwise prevent the network's devices from functioning properly. DoS can be accom- 
plished by tying up the server's resources~£or example, by overwhelming the CPU and 
memory resources. In other cases, a particular user or machine can be the target of DoS 
attacks that hang up the client machine and require it to be rebooted. 
Distributed Denial-o -Service Attack 
Distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks use intermediary computers, called agents, on which pro- 
grams called zombies have previously been surreptitiously installed. The hacker activates 
these zombie programs remotely, causing the intermediary computers (which can 

588 
Chapter 9 • Network Infrastructure and Security 
number in the hundreds or even thousands) to simultaneously launch the actual attack. 
Because the attack comes from the computers running the zombie programs, which 
could be on networks anywhere in the world, the hacker is able to conceal the true 
origin of the attack. 
It is important to note that DDoS attacks pose a two-layer threat. Not only could 
your network be the target of a DoS attack that crashes your servers and prevents 
incoming and outgoing traffic, but your computers could be used as the "innocent mid- 
dlemen" to launch a DoS attack against another network or site. 
Ping of Death 
Another type of DoS attack is the ping of death (also known as the large packet ping). The 
ping-of-death attack is launched by creating an IP packet (sometimes referred to as a 
killer packet) larger than 65,536 bytes, which is the maximum allowed by the IP specifi- 
cation. This can cause the target system to crash, hang, or reboot. 
Teardrop 
The teardrop attack works a little differently from the ping of death but with similar 
results. The teardrop program creates IP fragments, which are pieces of an IP packet into 
which an original packet can be divided as it travels through the Internet. The problem 
is that the offset fields on these fragments, which are supposed to indicate the portion 
(in bytes) of the original packet that is contained in the fragment, overlap. 
For example, normally two fragments' offset fields might appear as shown here: 
Fragment 1: (offset) 100-300 
Fragment 2: (offset) 301-600 
This indicates that the first fragment contains bytes 100 through 300 of the original 
packet, and the second fragment contains bytes 301 through 600. 
Overlapping offset fields would appear something like this: 
Fragment I: (offset) 100-300 
Fragment 2: (offset) 200-400 
When the destination computer tries to reassemble these packets, it is unable to do 
so and could crash, hang, or reboot. 
Ping or ICMP Flood 
The ping flood or ICMPflood is a means of tying up a specific client machine. It is caused 
by an attacker sending a large number of ping packets (ICMP echo request packets) to 
the Winsock or dialer software. This action prevents the software from responding to 
server ping activity requests, which causes the server to eventually time out the connec- 
tion. A symptom of a ping flood is a huge amount of modem activity, as indicated by 
flashing modem lights. This attack is also referred to as a ping storm. 

Network Infrastructure and Security • Chapter 9 
589 
Mail Bomb Attack 
A mail bomb is a means of overwhelming a mail server, causing it to stop functioning and 
thus denying service to users. This is a relatively simple form of attack, accomplished by 
sending a massive quantity of e-mail to a specific user or system. Programs available on 
hacking sites on the Internet allow a user to easily launch a mail bomb attack, automati- 
cally sending floods of e-mail to a specified address while protecting the attacker's identity. 
A variation on the mail bomb program automatically subscribes a targeted user to 
hundreds or thousands of high-volume Internet mailing lists, subsequently filling the 
user's mailbox and/or the mail server. Bombers call this attack list linking. Examples of 
these mail bomb programs include Unabomber, Extreme Mail, Avalanche, and Kaboom. 
The solution to repeated mail bomb attacks is to block traffic from the originating 
network using packet filters. Unfortunately, this solution does not work with list linking, 
because the originator's address is obscured; the deluge of traffic comes from the mailing 
lists to which the victim has been subscribed. 
Scanning and Spoofing 
The term scanner, in the context of network security, refers to a software program that 
hackers use to remotely determine the TCP/UDP ports that are open on a given system 
and thus vulnerable to attack. Scanners are also used by administrators to detect vulnera- 
bilities in their own systems so that they can correct the vulnerabilities before an 
intruder finds them. Network diagnostic tools include sophisticated port-scanning capa- 
bilities. A good scanning program can locate a target computer on the Internet (one that 
is vulnerable to attack), determine the TCP/IP services running on the machine, and 
probe those services for security weaknesses. 
Port Scanning 
Port scanning refers to a means of locating "listening" TCP or UDP ports on a computer 
or router and obtaining as much information as possible about the device from the lis- 
tening ports. TCP and UDP services and applications use a number of well-known ports, 
which are widely published. The hacker uses his knowledge of these commonly used 
ports to extrapolate information. 
For example, Telnet normally uses port 23. If a hacker finds that port open and lis- 
tening, she knows that Telnet is probably enabled on the machine. She can then try to 
infiltrate the system by, for example, guessing the appropriate password in a brute-force 
attack.

Using Firewalls to Protect Network Resources 
Firewalls are not the only part of the network security design, but they do play a major 
role in allowing you to control traffic more completely, thus providing a higher level of 
protection for your internal resources. Deploying a firewalls is a major part of providing 
defense in depth for your network. Part of the design process includes evaluating the 
requirements and performance of different hardware- and software-based firewall prod- 
ucts. We've already discussed some of the most-used technologies, such as Check Point 
NG, Cisco PIX, Nokia, and Microsoft's ISA Server. As you begin to deploy your fire- 
wall, you must first be clear about what the firewall is intended to protect. 
A design that is only intended to superficially limit internal users' access to the 
Internet, for example, requires much less planning and design work than a system pro- 
tecting resources from multiple access points or providing multiple services to the public 
network or users from remote locations. An appropriate path to follow for your design 
path might look like this: 
• 
Perform baseline security analysis of existing infrastructure, including OS and 
application analysis 
• 
Perform baseline network mapping and performance monitoring 
• 
Identify risk to resources and appropriate mitigation processes 
• 
Identify potential security threats, both external and internal 
• 
Identify needed access points from external sources: 
• 
Public networks 
• 
VPN access 
• 
Extranets 
• 
Remote access services 
• 
Identify critical services 
A firewall would not serve any purpose if it blocked all traffic. To properly protect a 
network environment, network traffic must be filtered both outbound and inbound. The 
key to configuring a firewall is to ensure that it only allows the traffic you want to allow 
and only blocks the traffic you want blocked. In some cases, this is not an easy task. 
Securing inbound traffic means ensuring that only trusted hosts on an external network 
(such as the Internet) are allowed to make connections to machines residing inside the 
firewall. This can include roaming users connecting to internal resources or external 
clients attaching to a Web server that's hosted behind a firewall. Securing outbound 
traffic requires you to determine how your internal clients are permitted to connect to 
the resources on the Internet or on another untrusted network.

Understanding the TCP and UDP ports that are used in network communication 
becomes an extremely important part of your ability to filter network access and protect 
assets using a firewall.You'll recall that ports 0 through 1023 are reserved for specific uses 
but that some network applications can use other ports from 1024 through 49151. Ports 
between 49152 and 65535 are unregistered ports, used for private applications, client-side 
processes, or other processes that dynamically allocate port numbers. 
~M DAY TIP 
~" The entire list of common TCP and UDP ports can be found at 
F www.iana.org/port-numbers. Some of the more common ones that you should 
"%~.....~,- 
be aware of are: 
• 
ftp on port 21 
• 
telnet on port 23 
• 
smtp on port 25

tftp on port 69 
• 
http on port 80 
• 
kerberos on port 88 
• 
pop3 on port 110 
• 
nntp on port 119 
Once you understand which ports should be allowed and disallowed on your net- 
work, you can incorporate rules that block aH unnecessary or unauthorized traffic. 
Generany, this involves creating a rule set or an access contwl list (ACL) that restricts or 
blocks all unused ports. The following code demonstrates how you can block TCP port 
445 on a Cisco router. Port 445 is a common attack point for viruses and malware.

You'll typically begin the design process from one of two "all or nothing" configu- 
rations: Either you'll configure all ports to be open and close them only as problems 
occur, or you'll configure all ports to be closed by default, opening required ports only 
as necessary.You can use either approach, but the latter is heavily recommended since it 
provides a much higher level of default security for your network. 
There are a number of common ports that most security authorities recommend be 
blocked in a secure firewall configuration. These ports are all commonly known points 
of entry for a Windows or UNIX system, and they often have known vulnerabilities 
associated with them that make them easy prey for a hacker who's looking for an 
unpatched machine. Table 9.3 lists some of the most common ports that should be 
blocked in a firewall configuration.

Configuring Your Firewall to Filter Network Packets 
Creating packet-filtering rules can become somewhat involved, mainly because you have 
to spend a great deal of time determining the source and destination IP addresses and 
ports.You also need to be familiar with how connections are made, managed, and ended. 
www.syngress.com 

594 
Chapter 9 • Network Infrastructure and Security 
However, some simple rules can help you create a packet filter as soon as possible. As far 
as outgoing traffic is concerned, you should take the following steps: 
1. 
Configure your firewall to deny all outgoing traffic unless explicitly allowed. 
This means that your firewall will deny all services to your end users, unless 
you allow it by creating a rule allowing a specific traffic type. 
2. 
Configure your firewall to allow your internal network to use ports that are 
higher than 1023. Most network clients use these ports to establish connec- 
tions to network services. 
3. 
Identify the ports that are used by any services that you want to allow access 
to. If, for example, you want to allow end users to access the Web, you must 
create a rule allowing all local network hosts to access all remote systems at 
ports 80 and 443. Likewise, if you want your local clients to use remote POP3 
servers, you will have to allow local hosts to access remote systems at port 110. 
As far as incoming traffic is concerned, you have a number of options. Many systems 
administrators want to create a firewall that forbids all incoming traffic except for the 
TCP and UDP packets used by remote clients to connect to the firewall. For example, if 
you want to allow internal clients to access the Web, you need to allow remote hosts 
(Web servers) to make connections to your firewall. This involves allowing remote hosts 
to open their local ports above 1023 to access your systems at ports above 1023. 
Therefore, you should take the following steps: 
1. 
Configure your firewall to prohibit all incoming traffic from accessing any ser- 
vices below port 1023. The most secure firewall will not allow any connections 
to these ports. 
2. 
Forbid all incoming traffic unless it is part of an already established session by 
using stateful packet filtering. This will instruct your firewall to match any 
incoming packet with the client that requested it and allow the traffic to pass. 
Any unsolicited packets sent directly to an internal host and not to the firewall 
itself will be dropped. 
3. 
Disable all incoming I CMP traffic to protect yourself against DoS attacks. This 
step is optional, of course, because disabling this feature makes network trou- 
bleshooting more difficult, since tools like ping and tracert rely on ICMP to 
function. 
4. 
Enable logging to troubleshoot your firewall operations as well as to determine 
if you are in the midst of an intrusion attempt.

Using a Proxy Server 
When you're the network administrator for a company that makes heavy use of the 
Internet, you might need to implement a proxy server to optimize and secure Internet 
access for your internal users. Similar to a firewall, a proxy server helps separate your 
internal network from the outside world. But unlike a firewall, which only filters traffic, 
a proxy server actually acts as a "go-between" for your internal users. This means that the 
proxy server will receive a request for Internet access from an internal user and then for- 
ward the request to the Internet.You can see an example of this process in Figure 9.15. 
Figure 9.15 Proxy Servers Send Web Requests on Behalf of Internal Clients

To the Proxy Server 
A proxy server will hide the computers on your LAN from the outside network so 
that only the IP address of the proxy server will be visible on the Internet; your internal 
computers will use private IP addresses that can't be reached from the other side of the 
proxy. 
Before it forwards the request out to the Internet, the proxy server will check its 
local cache to see if it already has a local copy of the page being requested. If the page 
isn't in the proxy server's cache, the proxy server will make the request on behalf of the 
client and then return the requested page to the user. From an end user's perspective, the 
proxy server is basically transparent. Any Internet requests get returned to the client as 
though they were being returned directly. Proxy servers increase the efficiency of an 
enterprise network by caching frequently requested pages so that users can retrieve them 
more quickly. Although the functionality of a proxy server can be bundled with a fire- 
wall, proxy servers have several functions that are specific to them: 

596 
Chapter 9 • Network Infrastructure and Security 
Content filtering Proxy servers are generally the only types of firewall that 
manage and control traffic by inspecting URL and page content. If configured 
properly, a proxy server or a proxy firewall can identify and block content that 
you consider objectionable. 
Packet redirection Sometimes it is necessary for a firewall to send traffic to 
another port or another host altogether. For example, suppose that you have 
installed a proxy server on a host, separate from your firewall. It is likely that 
you will want to have your firewall automatically forward all traffic sent to 
ports 80 and 443 (the standard HTTP and HTTPS ports) to your proxy server 
for additional processing. 
Content caching In many cases, users visit the same Web sites on a regular 
basis, or multiple users within the organization visit the same sites and view 
the same pages. Web caching provides a way to reduce network traffic for both 
outbound Web requests from your internal users to Web servers on the 
Internet and for inbound Web requests from external users to the Web servers 
you host on your internal network. 
Implementing Network Filtering 
You could find yourself administering a corporate network where all your users reside 
-
-
 
in fixed locations and everyone exists in close proximity to the resources that they're 
trying to access, but this is becoming more an exception than the rule. To avoid overbur-

597 
dening your company's network bandwidth, as well as to increase security, you'll prob- 
ably need to implement some type of network-filtering solution to control how external 
users can access your internal resources. In a larger network, you might even need to 
fine-tune how internal traffic gets transmitted so that users can access their files and 
resources in an efficient manner. Some of the ways you can do this include virtual LANs 
(VLANs), extranets, and intranets. 
Using a Virtual LAN 
If you're administering a network where all your users are grouped together so that you 
can place the resources they need in close physical proximity to them, you can usually rely 
on network switches to segment your network, since switches are more than sufficient to 
isolate and optimize network traffic for this type of departmental or workgroup environ- 
ment. But how about a situation where your users are spread further apart than that? 
Maybe you have a group of users who need to collaborate closely and share the same 
resources, but they're physically scattered across different floors of a single building or even 
different buildings within an office complex? As your users become further and further 
distant from one another, using only network switching becomes less effective in seg- 
menting your network traffic. This is because switches are useful only in controlling unicast 
traflqc~traflqc that's sent directly from one computer to another. Switches are incapable of 
controlling broadcast or multicast traffic, and on a large network this can create bandwidth 
problems by causing "broadcast storms."You can use routers to control broadcast traflqc, but 
they are much slower than switches and can create traffic bottlenecks. 
~ M WARNING 
Remember that switches operate at the data link layer of the OSI model, 
~ 
whereas routers operate at the network layer. Layer 3 switches (switches that 
~' 
have a router module installed in them) combine the features of both a switch 
and a router, and the benefits are huge since you don't need to traverse the 
network for a routing decision. If a particular switch can't find a host, it can 
look in the routing information table (RIT) and then forward the packet from 
inside the switch. 
One possible alternative to this problem is to configure your switches to use virtual 
LANs (VLANs). A VLAN allows a group of machines to communicate as though they 
were connected to a single LAN segment, even if in reality they're spread out across 
multiple network segments or locations. VLANs also operate at the data link layer and so 
can transmit traffic faster than using routers that rely on complex routing tables.You can 
see the difference between a standard switched network and one that uses VLANs in 
Figures 9.16 and 9.17. In Figure 9.16, you can see that all the workstations on the seg- 
ment will receive broadcast and multicast traffic from any other machine. In Figure 9.17, 

598 
Chapter 9 • Network Infrastructure and Security 
we've split the segment into three separate VLANs. Now users in the same VLAN will 
receive only traffic that's destined for that VLAN, which cuts down on bandwidth uti- 
lization for your network.

So how does a particular VLAN know which machines belong to it? You'll control 
how traffic is routed across VLANs based on VLAN memberships in one or more 
VLANs.You'll configure VLAN membership based on a few possible criteria: 
Port number You can specify VLAN membership based on the number 
assigned to the physical port that a particular computer is plugged into. This 
membership assignment is typically controlled by management software that's 
loaded on the switch. For example, you can specify that ports 1 and 2 corre- 
spond to the Human Resources VLAN; 3, 4, 9 and 10 belong to the IT 
VLAN; and all remaining ports belong to the Accounting VLAN, as you can 
see in Figure 9.17. If you need to move a particular port from one VLAN to 
another, you can just make the change from the management software.

MAC address You can assign a specific MAC address to belong to a partic-

ship even if it moves from one location to another. This is particularly useful in 
the case of roaming users who need to plug into your network from multiple 
locations.

This is a protocol VLANs use that embeds VLAN membership infor- 
mation directly into a network packet so that the switch will make routing 
decisions based on the content of the packet that's being sent. 
• 
Inter-Switch Link (ISL) 
This is a proprietary protocol used on Cisco 
switches that support VLAN technology. 
Segmenting your user population using VLANs offers you two major advantages 
over using network switches without the use of VLANs. The first is improved perfor- 
mance, since you can use VLANs to control not only unicast but also multicast and 
broadcast traffic. In this way, broadcast traffic that needs to be seen by only a few 
machines can be confined to those machines, rather than taking up bandwidth for your 
entire network by broadcasting traffic to everyone on the network segment. The second 
advantage of a VLAN is that it simplifies how you administer your network, since you 
can configure and reconfigure VLANs using software installed on the VLAN-capable 
switch rather than needing to physically move network cables from one switch to

Chapter 9 • Network Infrastructure and Security 
another. This also makes VLAN creation extremely flexible, since you can reconfigure 
VLAN membership on the fly, usually with a few clicks of your mouse. VLANs are also 
extensible, since a single VLAN can span multiple switches to encompass computers 
across a wide geographical area. The most common way to configure this is through the 
VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP), which allows you to disseminate configuration infor- 
mation between multiple switches.

In preparing for the Network+ exam, be sure that you have an understanding of 
what a VLAN is and how it operates within a network. Be aware of the ways that 
VLAN memberships can be assigned as well as the benefits of configuring a VLAN on 
your network. 
Deploying an Extranet 
In our increasingly Internet-connected business world, you could find yourself in a situa- 
tion where you need to provide access to internal network resources over an unsecured 
connection. This is often the case in situations where you enter into a business partnership 
or a research project with another company. One of the challenges that this presents is the 
question of how to appropriately allow connectivity between organizations while still 
maintaining proper authentication and security for all involved parties. Many of the basic 
firewall designs we've discussed can provide partial solutions to these issues, but you might 
also need to look at alternative solutions to provide remote access for users from other 
companies while still adhering to your own company's security requirements. Figure 9.18 
shows a typical extranet configuration between two separate companies.

Of all the ways to provide connectivity for external business partners, extranets often 
provide the greatest flexibility for use in an enterprise network. An extranet is a portion of 
your internal network that you make available over the Internet so that you can share your 
business information with suppliers, vendors, customers, or other business partners.You can 
use an extranet to exchange data with a business partner, share product information with 
vendors or wholesalers, and collaborate with other companies on joint business or research 
ventures. Extranets can be Web browser-based information stores that allow customers to 
look up product information in an online catalog and can allow real-time (or nearly so) 
tracking of shipments as well as inventory management. Additionally, you can configure an 
extranet for collaborative efforts between business partners to allow these partnerships to 
share information while working on joint projects. 
One of the most critical facets of deploying an extranet is that of security. On the 
client side, extranet applications most commonly take the form of Web browser-based 
applications, which can be protected using SSL encryption for the transmission of sensi- 
tive data.You can also consider deploying a VPN, using IPSec or another type of 
encryption, to create a secure tunnel over the Internet.You'll typically place extranet 
servers on isolated network segments to isolate them from your internal network. These 
isolated segments host machines that allow these external users to access information 
without actually providing them with access to your internal network. 
Using an Intranet 
Though it sounds like they should be opposites, intranets and extranets are actually 
pretty similar concepts. The main purpose of an intranet is to share company informa- 
tion, typically through a Web site hosted on your company's internal Web server.You 
can also use an intranet for more advanced features such as document collaboration and 
shared calendaring, which can help your company facilitate online project teams and 
teleconferences.You can use an intranet to provide your employees with access to com- 
pany documents, software, and calendars as well as access to companywide information 
such as human resources information and health insurance forms. Much as with an 
extranet, you can use security mechanisms like SSL encryption and VPNs to secure this 
information for internal employees who need to access the intranet remotely or to con- 
nect one portion of your company's network with another.

Protecting Your Network From Viruses

viruses will often follow them in through the door. Viruses are nothing more than small 
programs designed to disrupt and alter the functionality of a computer. In earlier days, 
the most common way for a virus to spread between computers was through floppy 
disks. Today, it's much more common for computer viruses to spread through corporate 
and personal e-mail systems and through online file-sharing services such as Kazaa. 
Regardless of how the virus is transmitted, all viruses have one thing in common: They 
will copy themselves from one machine to another to spread the virus infection, much 
like a virus in the medical world. 
You'll often hear viruses referred to as malicious software, or malware for short. 
Thousands of viruses are floating around the networks of the world, and most of them 
carry some type of destructive or disruptive capabilities. A destructive virus is one that 
actually damages or deletes data on your hard drive, attempting to delete your documents 
or operating system files.A disruptive virus is one that doesn't delete any data but attempts 
to clog up a network by creating a DoS attack. DoS attacks are attempts to overwhelm a 
server or a router by sending thousands of bogus requests to it. If the server has no way of 
knowing that a request is bogus, it will try to service all these malicious requests to the 
point that legitimate users will not be able to access the server or service. 
We'll start this section with a look at different types of malicious software that can 
threaten your network and then move on to ways to protect yourself from them. 
Understanding Malware 
Malware comes from the phrase "malicious software." This is sort of a blanket term that 
covers an entire scope of aggressive software such as Trojan horses and worms. Though 
malware's definition varies, the term basically describes any software or code that is specifi- 
cally designed to damage and/or disrupt a system. People create malware for any number 
of reasons: as a prank, to gain notoriety and publicity, or simply to wreak havoc on other 
people's computers. Because the motivations of malware writers are so varied, the effects of 
malware range from somewhat annoying to downright devastating. Some viruses simply 
clog up your e-mail inbox; others actually try to destroy or alter information on your 
computer. But no matter how you perceive the damage caused by malware, it is fair to say 
that most viruses~worms, Trojan horses, and macro viruses alike-meet the definition of 
malware. Let's look at a few of the more common types of malware. 
Viruses 
The largest distinguishing characteristic of a virus is that, to be able to perform the mali- 
cious tasks that its creators intended, it somehow needs to be executed or run on the 
target machine. Once the virus has been executed, it attempts to replicate itself 
throughout the computer and ultimately onto other network-connected computers.

Network Infrastructure and Security • Chapter 9 
603 
Viruses are activated when an infected program is loaded into memory and executed 
either by its own code or by the actions of the user. 
Whether a computer virus is disruptive or destructive, all viruses have a similar 
reason for being, and that is to disrupt the normal flow of data processing for a personal 
computer or for an entire network. For this reason alone, you should take every step 
possible to eradicate these threats and prevent them from attacking your systems. Most 
viruses attach themselves to other programs that are routinely executed, especially exe- 
cutable files such as EXE, VBS, and DLL. These files can enter your systems via users 
downloading infected files from a Web site or bulletin board or inserting infected disks 
into a diskette drive. 
"~!~ DAY TIP 
~ 
The malicious code released by a virus is referred to as the virus payload. 
Worms 
A worm is a program of which the primary function is to replicate its code. The main 
difference between a virus and a worm is that a worm can replicate itself without user 
intervention. A virus depends on a user opening an e-mail attachment or running an 
infected executable to be able to spread, but a worm can run under its own power and 
actively seek out other network-attached machines to infect. Worms will often spread as 
a result of flaws in a computer operating system, like the Code Red and Nimda worms 
that spread because of a flaw in the Microsoft Web server software. Worms are designed 
to replicate themselves throughout a system's disks and memory, attempting to use up all 
the infected machine's resources and, if successful, eventually crash the system. 
Logic Bombs 
When discussing worms, you also need to talk about logic bombs. These are program rou- 
tines that destroy data whenever certain conditions are met. For example, a logic bomb 
may reformat your hard disk or insert random code into £des on a predetermined date. 
The most infamous example of a logic bomb was the Michelangelo virus, which was pro- 
grammed to execute a destructive payload on the Renaissance artist's birthday every year. 
Macro Viruses 
Another type of computer virus is the macro virus. Macro viruses are very simple pro- 
grams that are usually written in VBScript or another easy-to-learn scripting language. 
Macro viruses became quite prevalent after Microsoft introduced Visual Basic into its 
release of Office 97, because even low-level hackers were provided with a tool that 
allowed for the creation of malicious code that was simple to write and easy to deploy. 
www.syngress.com 

604 
Chapter 9 • Network Infrastructure and Security 
Macro viruses are Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) script files that provide easy access 
into a computer. Although macro viruses were originally designed to infect Microsoft 
applications such as Word, Excel, and Access, newer macro viruses have been written to 
infect other programs as well. The two most well-known macro viruses from recent 
years have been the Melissa (W97M.melissa) and ILOVEYOU (VBS.LoveLetter) viruses, 
which brought Internet traffic to a near halt when they first began circulating. 
Trojan Horses 
Trojan horses are best described by the age-old analogy of"a wolf in sheep's clothing."A 
Trojan horse masquerades as a file that contains useful content, perhaps a system utility 
or a game. But once a user opens the file and the Trojan horse is unleashed, it releases its 
destructive payload. Trojan horses exhibit behaviors similar to other viruses, deleting, 
altering, or destroying your data. Perhaps the most dangerous aspect of the Trojan horse 
is that it can even allow a malicious user to take control of your computer, accessing and 
even stealing your sensitive data and information. The largest difference between Trojan 
horses and their virus and worm counterparts is that Trojan horses do not replicate 
themselves. Rather, these programs remain in memory on a particular computer until 
they're eradicated. (And the eradication process often requires reformatting and rein- 
stalling the operating system of the computer that's been compromised.) 
Probably the most notable example of a Trojan is the program Back Orifice, which 
was released by a hacker organization as a way to take control of remote machines using 
nothing but an Internet connection. This Trojan breaks down into two functional parts: a 
small and virtually invisible "server" piece that runs on the recipient's system and a 
client-end piece that runs on the hacker's computer. The server software is a small pro- 
gram that secretly installs itself on a recipient's system and runs even after a system 
reboot. It can attach itself to any Windows executable, which will run normally after its 
installation. This means the server-side piece can creep in just like any virus, completely 
undetected. Back Orifice will run over any User Datagram Protocol (UDP) port but 
will default to port 31337. 
Once this Trojan is installed, hackers can initiate numerous commands, such as get- 
ting a list of the files stored on the remote machine's hard drive, terminating processes 
that are running, or logging the keystrokes that a user on the remote machine types at 
the keyboard. So if you have a traveling user at your company who has access to a great 
deal of sensitive documentation and financial records on your network, and if this user's 
laptop becomes infected with this Trojan horse, a hacker would be able to record every- 
thing that this remote user typed into his or her keyboard. For a user with access to sen- 
sitive information, this can provide a hacker with data such as bank account numbers 
and balances as well as administrative passwords to critical network systems. 
Backdoor.SubSeven is another Trojan horse that is quite similar to Back Orifice. It 
grants a hacker (or any unauthorized individual) access to a computer over the Internet. 
When the server portion of the program is properly installed and running on acom- 
www.syngress.com 

Network Infrastructure and Security • Chapter 9 
605 
puter, it is possible for the hacker to accomplish tasks such as editing the Registry, set- 
ting up the computer as an FTP server, browsing its file system, taking screen shots, 
opening and closing programs, editing a currently running program's information, and 
even restarting the system. 
Other Types of Malicious Programs 
Though they're becoming less common, you should also be aware of boot sector and 
master boot record viruses when you're protecting your network against malicious software. 
Both of these boot viruses are memory-resident viruses that were primarily written for 
DOS. However, no matter what operating system is in use, all computers are potential 
targets for these types of viruses. A boot sector virus functions by taking over the system 
area of a diskette or a hard drive by attaching itself to a small program within the boot 
record that is run each time you start the computer from the disk. Once the virus has 
planted itself into the boot record, it can cause damage to other disks on your system. 
After that, whenever you put a diskette that isn't write-protected into your computer, 
that diskette will receive a copy of the boot virus so that it can spread the virus to other 
computers.

Deploying Antivirus Software 
To help protect yourself against these types of malicious software, you should install an 
antivirus program to guard the computers on your network from viruses, worms, and 
Trojan horses.Antivirus programs are designed to recognize potential viruses as they 
attempt to enter your computer systems. Antivirus software uses two methods to protect 
your computer: 
• 
Virus signatures Each virus that is catalogued by an antivirus software man- 
ufacturer has a unique digital signature that allows antivirus software to recog- 
nize it. As new computer viruses are created, new signatures need to be 
installed to help your antivirus software recognize these new threats. So in 
addition to installing antivirus software, you also need to keep it up to date by 
downloading new antivirus signatures on a regular basis.

update the antivirus definitions for your network on a regular basis. New viruses

are discovered every week, and your antivirus software needs constant updating 
......... :~:i'~i"~ .......... to be able to protect your network against the newest viruses. 

Network Infrastructure and Security • Chapter 9 
607 
Heuristics This is a way for antivirus software to recognize a very new virus 
threat even before a signature has been developed for it. Heuristics work by 
looking for "virus-like" behavior on the part of anything that's executing on 
your computer. For example, heuristics would probably look at a VBScript file 
that was trying to send 10,000 e-mails from your computer or that was trying to 
delete the entire contents of your C:\ drive and would flag this file as containing 
a potential virus. Heuristics provide something of a fail-safe mechanism to help 
you deal with the newest viruses until your antivirus software can be updated. 
just as with firewalls, there are any number of commercially available antivirus pro- 
grams that you can use to secure your network.You won't need to recognize specific 
antivirus applications for the Network+ exam, but it's helpful to be aware of your avail- 
able options to protect a corporate network. Programs such as Norton AntiVirus 2005, 
which is intended for the home Internet user, retails for around $50.You can also pur- 
chase a corporate solution such as Symantec Antivirus Corporate Edition (SAVCE) or a 
number of other similar products to protect an entire network. 
Computer Associates Software 
Computer Associates (CA) offers a variety of antivirus solutions. InoculatelT Advanced 
Edition and eTrust InoculatelT are the current antivirus contenders CA offers.Advanced 
Edition is designed for midsize to large organizations that have multiple servers and work- 
stations. It provides centralized management functionality designed to ease the protection 
of large networks against virus attacks. With Advanced Edition, large-scale deployment is 
simplified through the single-point remote installation of all servers, clients, and antivirus 
agents. 
eTrust InoculatelT is CA's award-winning antivirus solution, eTrust InoculatelT has 
been designed to reduce virus infections and simplify and automate updating virus sig- 
natures. Extensive features include multiple scanning engine support, real-time detection 
with system cure, and centralized event logging and alerting, eTrust InoculatelT addresses 
all the potential points of entry for virus attacks, from desktops to servers. 
Network Associates Software 
Network Associates is better known to the computer purchasing public for its wildly 
popular McAfee line of products. Current programs offered by Network Associates are 
VirusScan Professional and the Total Virus Defense (TVD) Suite. VirusScan Professional 
was created for small businesses and home networks that have multiple computers. It 
allows users to protect their computers and safeguard their business and personal data. It 
is a more "network-oriented" version of the popular McAfee VirusScan and protects up 
to five PCs. The TVD Suite is a more enterprise-oriented product that allows you to 
protect numerous networked PCs from a single administrative point.

Chapter 9 • Network Infrastructure and Security 
Deploying Antivirus for an Enterprise Network 
Making a standalone personal computer with Internet connections impervious to 
viruses is a simple enough task. All you really need in most cases is a CD-ROM drive, 
the software, and about five minutes to click "Next" a few times. However, securing an 
enterprise network consisting of numerous servers and hundreds if not thousands of 
clients can be a daunting task. Enterprise antivirus solutions such as SAVCE are designed 
to ease the deployment of such a scenario. These powerful enterprise solutions not only 
facilitate the deployment of the product to your servers and clients without having to 
physically visit each individual computer, they provide numerous features for hassle-free 
management and up-to-date virus protection throughout your network. 
Regardless of which product you use to manage antivirus protection for your net- 
work, your enterprise solution should create a manageable collection of servers and 
workstations that you can configure easily and efficiently. There should be some central- 
ized mechanism that will allow you to propagate changes to your antivirus configuration 
to all members of your network with no additional effort.You also need to be able to 
perform antivirus-related tasks, such as scheduling regular hard disk scans and per- 
forming ad hoc virus sweeps of an entire network. 
Depending on your clients' physical location and networkconnectivity, you can 
manage antivirus software for them in a number of different ways. Client machines that 
are connected to the same LAN as your antivirus server can be managed through a cen- 
tralized administrative console since they can communicate quite frequently with the 
antivirus servers to receive updates and send alerts regarding virus infections.You can 
manage clients that are not well connected to the same network using configuration 
files that are stored on the local workstation or by delegating the responsibility of 
updating virus definitions to the computer users themselves.

In this chapter, we looked at several different technologies that you can use to protect 
and enhance the security of your network. First we examined firewalls, which you can 
use to filter the types of traffic that are allowed to reach your internal users. A packet-ill- 
tering firewall can filter traffic based on the source or destination IP address of a partic- 
ular network packet as well as the TCP or UDP port number that it's transmitting on. 
Packet-filtering firewalls make filtering decisions based on the information they find at 
the network layer and transport layer, but they won't examine network packets any fur- 
ther than that. 
There are also application-level (or circuit-level) firewalls that more fully examine 
incoming traffic to ensure that it is not malicious or harmful in any way. This process 
involves examining a network packet's contents to determine if they are malicious or 
not, rather than just making decisions based on the IP address or port that the traffic is 
destined for. 
Firewalls can also function as Network Address Translation (NAT) devices, which 
allow you to use private IP addresses for your internal clients while still enabling access 
to a public network such as the Internet. Static NAT filtering creates a one-to-one map- 
ping between private and public IP addresses and is useful ford network with only a few ........................ 
internal hosts. For a network that has many internal hosts and only a few public IP 
addresses to go around, you can enable dynamic NAT translation, where private-to- 
public IP address mappings take place on the fly. 
Another option for protecting your network is a proxy server, which acts as a go- 
i~ 
between for your internal clients whenever they need to request a resource from the 
Internet or another untrusted network. Proxy servers can also make filtering decisions 
similar to firewalls, allowing or disallowing a particular user's request based on the con- 
tent of that request, time of day, or security groups that the user belongs to. Proxy 
servers can also cache repeated requests for the same Web resources so that users can 
access them more quickly over the local network, 
ii 
If your company has an active Internet presence, you might also need to use an 
i 
extranet to provide secure access to your internal resources for external business part- 
~ 
ners, vendors, or customers. This involves creating a secure connection to your internal 
!~" 
resources, usually by using a virtual private network or an SSL-encrypted Web connec- 
tion. External users will access your extranet using Web browsers or a VPN client. 
You can also configure an intranet to provide easier access to your internal resources 
for your employees, especially ones that travel or telecommute. An intranet is typically an 
internal Web server that provides a single place to access resources from the various 
departments or divisions in your company, protected by SSL encryption to provide 
.............. 
secure access for traveling or telecommuting users. 
~J~,~,~, 
Finally, we talked about computer viruses and how to protect your.company's net- 
~'~i 
work from them. Viruses, worms, and Trojan horses are all malicious computer programs 
® 
that attempt to either damage the data or disrupt the operations of a single computer or

ware and keeping your definition files up to date. Antivirus software uses signature files 
to recognize known viruses and uses heuristics to respond to malicious behavior from a 
.......................................................... new virus that might be included in the most recent definitions.

Chapter 10 • Fault Management and Disaster Recovery 
Introduction 
In today's high-speed networks, data is retied upon for just about everything. If you want 
to send an e-mail, you need to have an e-mail server that is available to process the 
incoming and outgoing messages, if you want to access a file, the file server must be avail- 
able and functioning as it should. Although this is common sense, it is only really realized 
when a disaster occurs. It is common sense that the systems that provide you with the ser- 
vice you need should be set up to avert catastrophe, and even more so, to survive it.You 
may not know it, but most computer parts are made with the possibility that they will fail. 
Look at hard disks for example; most, if not all of them, come with a mean time between 
failure (MTBF) value associated with them so that you can prepare for the unlikely event 
that they will cease to function properly. This is where a redundant array of independent 
disks (RAID), or perhaps the use of a cluster, comes in to save the day. 
All of this and more will be covered in this chapter, as the Network+ exam requires 
that you know how to deal with disasters or prepare for them and avoid them completely. 
In this chapter we will talk about the fundamentals of fault tolerance and disaster recovery. 
We will cover the basics of how to plan for and apply disaster recovery and fault tolerance 
in your network. Well-thought-out plans and documents provide information that is used 
to create a successful redundant solution. Without them, organizations would find it diN- 
cult to deal with incidents or to avoid problems that can adversely affect a company. As a 
Network+ technician, you will be expected to understand the fundamental concepts of 
disaster recovery planning and fault tolerance implementation. 
This chapter examines the concepts storage systems, sites that can be used if your 
primary site is destroyed or rendered useless, as well as how to implement layers of pro- 
tection to help you keep your systems up to achieve whatever your desired uptime is. 
We will also briefly cover DRPs. A disaster recovery plan is a set of documents used 
to identify potential threats and outline the procedures necessary to deal with different 
types of threats, disasters, and anything else not of the norm and clearly defined with 
action in the plan. When creating a disaster recovery plan, administrators should try to 
identify all the different types of threats that may affect the company. For example, a 
company in California would not need to worry about blizzards, but would need to be 
concerned about earthquakes, fire, flooding, power failures, and other kinds of disasters. 
Once the administrator has determined what disasters their company could face, they 
can then create procedures to minimize the risk of such disasters. The end of this 
chapter will cover the importance of documenting your network. In an emergency, 
having an up-to-date and accurate set of documentation is very important. Let us now 
take a serious look into applying fault tolerance and disaster recovery into your network 
and prepare for the Network+ exam.

Fault Tolerance 
I~-t~ 
A single point of failure can be the Achilles heel that brings down a system. Imagine a 
~
~
 
single road with a bridge that provides the only way to enter or exit a town. If the bridge 
fell down, no one would be able to come into or leave the town. Just as the bridge pro- 
vides a single point of failure that can cut off people from the outside world, a single point 
of failure in a system can sever a company's ability to perform normal business functions. 
Because there are so many components making up a network, something failing to 
function properly is inevitable. Hard drives can crash, power can go out, network con- 
nections can go down, and any number of other events can take down individual com- 
puters or the network as a whole. Until the problem is fixed, employees may be unable 
to do their jobs, and the company loses money. To minimize the impact, networks must 
be fault tolerant. 
Fault tolerance is the ability of a system, device or network to continue functioning 
despite a malfunction or an event that causes failure. When a component fails, another 
component will automatically take over, or procedures can be followed to have another 
system take its place. In other words, every important system has a backup system. 
Redundant systems and fault tolerance allow systems and services to be available in the 
event of a failure, so that there is little or no loss of service. 
There are many ways to protect a business and its systems, but the first step in plan- 
ning for a possible problem is determining what's important in your network. It might 
be nice to have everything duplicated on a network so that if any component fails 
there's another one to take its place, but the cost of actually doing this would be astro- 
nomical in most situations. Besides, not everything is that important. While one com- 
pany's employees may use online programs to do their jobs, another company may only 
use their intranet's Web server to post a corporate newsletter and some reference mate- 
rial. In this case, the first company could benefit by having a second Web server that 
they could switch to in the event of a failure, where the second company might not 
even notice their Web server was gone. What's important varies from company to com- 
pany.You will need to determine what's important to your network, and what always 
needs to be available and protected. 
Since networks can be unique, having different devices and services, the task of 
identifying what needs to be fault tolerant can seem overwhelming. However, there are 
several areas of a network that should be evaluated in terms of fault tolerance: 
• 
Power 
• 
Link Redundancy 
• 
Storage 
• 
Services 
As we'll see in the sections that follow, once you've identified the systems in these 
categories that need to be fault tolerant, you can then implement measures to keep them 
available if a failure occurs.

Chapter 10 • Fault Management and Disaster Recovery 
Fault Tolerant Power 
On August 14, 2003, the largest blackout in North American history shut down cities 
across the northeastern United States and in Ontario, Canada. In the day or more that 
followed without power, people found themselves without light, air conditioning, or 
other systems that relied on electricity. People were trapped in elevators and subway 
trains, while food spoiled in refrigerators and grocery stores. It was a sobering reminder 
of how dependent our society is on electrical energy and how easy it is to fail us, 
leaving us somewhat stranded and in disbelief that this could happen in the first place. 
Where were the backup systems? As with most issues of this size and complexity, that 
remained to be seen at the time. 
For those in computer-related professions, this event also served as a wake-up call 
and stressed the importance of fault tolerance, as well as disaster recovery. When utility 
companies are unable to provide electricity consistently, measures must be in place to 
provide power to essential computers and devices if problems occur. Included are servers 
that provide key services and data storage, workstations that will be used during the 
power outage, and equipment needed to network them together. The methods you 
choose to power these components will depend on how long they'll need an alternate 
source of power. 
An uninterruptible power supply (UPS) is used to provide regulated battery power 
to devices when normal sources of electricity become unavailable. When normal power 
is available, it will charge the UPS's battery. The UPS will generally provide such func- 
tions as surge protection and noise filtering for the devices plugged into it. When power 
to the UPS fails, it will revert to battery power, and continue supplying electricity for a 
limited amount of time, usually enough time for you (or the UPS itself if configured 
properly) to power the equipment down safely. 
Sudden power losses not only prevent people from using computers and other 
equipment, but can also corrupt data and damage hardware. By having computers, 
printers, and other devices plugged into the UPS, you are given a window of opportu- 
nity to shut them down properly, and avoid any damage. The components plugged into 
the UPS during a power outage continue receiving power from the UPS's battery for a 
limited amount of time (often ranging from 10 to 45 minutes) until normal power is 
restored. While this isn't a solution for continuing business during long blackouts, it does 
provide enough time to properly shut down systems plugged into the UPS, or for con- 
tinuing work during temporary losses of power. 
UPSs were traditionally expensive enough that network administrators limited their 
use. In recent years, the cost of these devices have dropped to the point that many 
people use them for home computer systems, and companies are implementing them to 
provide emergency power to a wider range of equipment. 
When power is out for lengthy periods of time, additional measures may be necessary 
to supply electricity to equipment. Power generators can run on gasoline, kerosene, or 
other fuels for a specific period of time, extended by the refueling of the generator. The 

Fault Management and Disaster Recovery • Chapter 10 
625 
capacity of these generators varies, with some being able to provide power to a small office 
or home, while others can provide energy to an entire building. With larger generators, 
power outlets within the building may be connected to the generator so that any systems 
plugged into these special outlets will receive power when normal power is lost.

Ensure that the Enable all notifications option is enabled. This will 
activate the computer's ability to accept notifications of a power failure 
from the UPS. 
Use the Seconds between power failure and first notification drop- 
down list to set the number of seconds that will elapse between when 
the UPS loses power and when you are notified. 
Use the Seconds between subsequent power failure notifications 
drop-down list to specify how long (in seconds) the UPS will wait before 
sending additional notifications of the power failure. 
In the Critical alarm section, enable the Minutes on battery before 
critical alarm option, then set the number of minutes your UPS can 
provide power. This will allow the computer to run on the battery 
power without doing any additional actions, such as running a specific 
program. If this time limit is met, a critical alarm occurs. 
Use the Next, instruct the computer to drop-down list to select the 
action that you want the computer to take when a critical alarm occurs. 
Your options are for the computer to Shutdown, or to Hibernate. 
Ensure that the Finally, turn off the UPS option is enabled. The com- 
puter will signal the UPS to shut down when the computer either hiber- 
nates or shuts down.

Fau It Tolerant Link Red u ndancy 
Fault tolerance can also be found in the network connections between different sites, such 
as when multiple sites are connected together on a wide area network (WAN). In organi- 
zations with branch offices, pools of buildings, or various divisions spread over a geo- 
graphic area, the network is often interconnected between locations. These smaller local 
area networks (LANs) might share data or other resources, or may require access to specific 
servers in other locations. For example, sales offices might need to enter orders and 
invoices into a database on a server at the main office. If the network connection between 
these locations went down, orders for products couldn't be processed. Losing the link 
between two locations on a network can result in different possible outcomes: the business 
could suffer losses or a redundant link could be used to resume connectivity. 
Link redundancy simply means that when one method of communication between 
sites fails, another can be used to maintain a link. Network lines may be used to connect 
two sites, with a separate network line set up in case the first goes down. If this first link 
fails, the network can still use the second link. 

Fault Management and Disaster Recovery • Chapter 10 
629 
The way the network determines which link to use is based on a priority system 
that you configure; a link with high priority is used before a low priority link. For 
example, let's say you had a T1 line and an ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) 
line connecting two sites together (similar to Figure 10.4). Network traffic between the 
two sites goes over the T1 line, but if it fails, then a backup line (here we are using an 
ISDN line) is used. This means the T1 line is configured as high priority and the ISDN 
link is configured as low priority. The ISDN line is redundant and only used if the T1 
line fails, thereby allowing network traffic to continue between these sites while a 
problem exists, and then when the problem is solved, the traffic resumes its normal path 
through the network.

Site B 
Another way of providing redundancy is to ensure that there is more than one route 
that can be used to send data over the network. Additional lines between sites provide 
redundant paths for network traffic to travel. For example, suppose that site A is con- 
nected to site B, which is connected to site C. These two links connect the three sites 
together, but if either of the links fails, then one of the sites will be unable to communi- 
cate with the others, and vice versa. To provide high availability, a third link can be set 
up between site A and C. As shown in Figure 10.5, the additional link allows the three 
sites to communicate with one another if any one link fails.

Such redundancy not only applies to a corporate network, but can also extend to 
the Internet. Many companies depend on Internet connectivity almost as much as net- 
work connectivity. In some cases, such as e-commerce business, they depend on it even 
more. A redundant ISP can be used to provide connectivity when the organization's pri- 
mary ISP's service becomes unavailable. The link to the secondary ISP can be configured 
as a low priority route, while your primary ISP is advertised as high priority. Such a 
configuration will have users using the primary ISP for normal usage, but automatically 
switching over to the low priority connection when the first one fails. If a secondary 
ISP isn't desired, then you should ensure that the ISP uses two different points of presence. 
A point of presence is an access point to the Internet, and multiple ones will allow 
access to the Internet if one goes down.

Fault 
Tolerant 
Storage 
One of the most precious commodities of any business using computers is its data. 
Much of the work performed in offices today is stored as individual files (such as docu- 
ments or spreadsheets) or in databases. Because of its importance, the areas in which the 
data is stored also need to be fault tolerant. 
A way that data can be recovered after a catastrophic problem is by restoring data 
from backups. Backups are a source of fault tolerance; you have multiple copies of the 
same data, therefore if data is accidentally erased, it can be retrieved from a copy. 
Backups allow a single file or an entire hard disk to be restored if the one currently 
being used is damaged or destroyed.

Fault Management and Disaster Recovery • Chapter 10 
631 
Another way you can recover from a serious problem would be to have fault tol- 
erant hard disks in your server. Fault tolerant disks allow a computer to recover from a 
disaster so that data isn't lost or corrupted. As we'll see later in this chapter, there are sev- 
eral ways in which hard disks can be made fault tolerant by using multiple disks. Data 
can be written to multiple disks at once or across several disks, so that if one fails, the 
data can still be recovered. These methods are referred to as different levels of RAID. 
Although adding a level of redundancy will provide you with some fault tolerance, 
you may also experience a small amount of latency due to the added systems and/or 
hardware. As well, with RAID and backups, there is also a delay during which 
employees must wait until network administrators can fix the problem when one occurs 
and recover from the fault as well as to check and restore the data if need be. The wait 
time to restore data is a minor consequence however, when you consider that data 
stored on the disks isn't lost due to a hard drive crash or other problems. 
Fault Tolerant Services 
Users of networks rely on specific services to perform their jobs. E-mail, databases, web- 
sites available over the Internet or local intranet, and other services are vital to many 
organizations. If certain services aren't available, the company's employees are limited in 
the work they can complete and may be unable to perform specific tasks. Because of the 
consequences of failure of these services, it's important to identify which services are 
mission critical to the business so that measures can be taken to make them available in 
the event of a failure. 
A method of making services fault tolerant involves duplicating services on multiple 
computers. This group of machines is called a cluster, and has the benefit of sharing the 
load of work that would otherwise be performed by a single server. Each server in the 
cluster is called a node, and together they act and appear as a single machine on the net- 
work. If one computer fails, users of the network can continue using the services avail- 
able through the cluster because the other nodes are still running. Clustering is discussed 
in more detail later in this chapter. 
Computer systems may also make use of failsafe computers, which are two computers 
that are essentially identical to one another, and provide the same services. While the pri- 
mary computer runs normally, it provides services to users of the network. A secondary 
computer called a failsafe, monitors the primary computer, and routinely checks to see if 
it's operational. If the primary computer fails, the failsafe computer will take over. For users 
of the network, there is a short absence of services during the time that the failsafe com- 
puter detects that the primary computer is unavailable and takes over its role. 
RAID 
RAID was developed to prevent the loss of data and/or improve performance by 
writing data across a set of hard disks, or writing a duplicate of data from one hard disk 
to another. The methods used by RAID that provide fault tolerance allow data to be 

632 
Chapter 10 • Fault Management and Disaster Recovery 
restored if a single disk fails. If more than one disk fails however, the data cannot be 
restored, and you'll have to resort to recovering data from a backup. 
Each method of storing data is referred to as a level of RAID. The levels of RAID 
are used for different purposes, with each one offering different mixes of performance, 
reliability, and cost. Because not every level of RAID offers improved performance or 
fault tolerance, it is important to choose the level of RAID that suits your needs. 
As shown in Table 10.1, there are a number of similarities and differences among the 
different levels of RAID. RAID 0 offers no fault tolerance, but offers improved perfor- 
mance over using a single hard disk, because it writes data across a set of hard disks. This 
method is called striping, which we'll discuss later in more detail. Because data is read or 
written across several disks in the striped set, it is able to read and write the data faster. 
RAID 1 (which we'll also discuss in greater detail later in this chapter) uses two disks. 
When data is written to one disk it is also written to the other disk in the set, so that 
each disk is a duplicate of the other. If one of the disks fails, the data still resides on the 
other disk. Other levels of RAID (2, 3, 4, 5, 10, and 53) use striping, but also provide 
fault tolerance. In some of these levels, redundant information is written to one of the 
disks in the set, while others write redundant information to each disk in the set. If one 
of the disks fails, the redundant information enables regeneration of the data that was on 
the failed disk.

Description 
RAID 0 
RAID 0 + 1

RAID 2 
Disk striping. Data is written (striped) across two or more disks, but 
no copies of the data are made. This improves performance 
because data is read from multiple disks, but there is no fault toler- 
ance if a disk fails. 
Disk striping with mirroring. This level combines features of RAID 0 
and RAID 1. It allows four or more disks to be used as a set, but 
provides full redundancy and the same fault tolerance as RAID 5. 
Disk mirroring or duplexing. Data that's written to one disk is also 
written to another, so that each drive has an exact copy of the 
data. In other words, one disk's data is a mirror image of the 
other's. Additional fault tolerance is achieved by using separate disk 
controllers for each disk, which is called duplexing. If one of the 
disks fails, or (in the case of duplexing) if a controller fails, the data 
is still available through the other disk in the pair. Because data 
from one disk is mirrored to another, a minimum of two disks must 
be used to implement RAID 1. 
Disk striping across disks. Also maintains error correction codes 
across the disks. This level is similar to RAID 0, except that error cor- 
rection codes are used for drives that don't have built-in error 
detection.

Same as level 2, except the error correction information is stored as 
parity information on one disk. Data is striped across three or more 
drives, but one drive is used to store the parity bits for each byte 
that's written to the other disks. When a disk fails, it can be 
replaced and data can be restored to it from the parity information. 
If two or more disks in the set fail, then data cannot be recovered. 
Employs striping data in much larger blocks than in levels 2 and 3. 
Parity information is kept on a single disk. This level is similar to 
RAID 3, but stripes data in larger blocks. As with RAID 3, if one disk 
fails, data can be recovered. However, if more than one disk fails, 
data cannot be recovered. Three or more hard disks are required to 
implement RAID 4. 
Disk striping with parity across multiple drives. Data is striped 
across three or more disks, but parity information is stored across 
multiple drives. 
Allows four or more drives to be used in an array, and has data 
striped across them with the same fault tolerance as RAID 1. 
Allows a minimum of five disks to be used in an array, but provides 
the same fault tolerance as RAID 3. 
RAID is available through hardware or software. Hardware RAID will generally 
support more levels of RAID, and will provide higher performance. This type of RAID 
can also support hot swapping, in which a disk can be removed from the server without 
having to take the server down. Software RAID is provided through operating systems, 
such as Windows 2000 and 2003 Server. When RAID is provided through the software, 
the levels of RAID supported may be limited and will also take a higher toll on the 
system, as RAID functions must run through the operating system running on the 
machine. Because of this, hot swapping is often unsupported, so you'll need to take 
down the system to replace a disk.

M WARNING 
@ 
Don't expect to see many questions dealing with RAID 0+ 1, 10, or 53 on the 
exam. You will probably see questions dealing with levels 0 and 1 through 5 of 
RAID. Of the various levels, pay particular attention to disk striping (RAID 0), 
disk mirroring (RAID 1), and disk striping with parity (RAID5). These are levels of 
RAID that aren't only supported by hardware, but also by most software.

Chapter 10 • Fault Management and Disaster Recovery 
Mirroring and Duplexing 
One of the more common ways to provide fault tolerance in hard disks is to create a 
mirrored copy of the data on another disk. Data that's written to one disk is also written 
to another, so that each drive has an exact copy of the data. In other words, one disk's 
data is a mirror image of the other's. If one of the physical disks fails, the server can con- 
tinue operating by using the other disk. 
Because data from one hard disk is mirrored to another, a minimum of two disks 
must be used. The second disk (which is the mirrored disk) must be at least the same 
size as the first drive, because information from the first drive has to be written to it. If 
the second disk was smaller than the first, then there is the potential that all of the data 
on the first drive couldn't be copied to the second. 
As shown in Figure 10.6, when mirrored volumes are created, the disk controller 
writes the same data simultaneously to separate disks. If one of these disks fails, the mir- 
rored volume must be bwken, meaning that each disk in the mirrored set is now consid- 
ered to be a single entity. For example, on Windows servers, the Disk Management tool 
would be used to break the mirror so that each disk is now considered a separate 
volume. Each disk would then have its own drive letter, so data could be read from and 
written to them individually. 
Figure 10.6 Mirroring 
HaM Disk 
Had Disk :i 
Hard Di~ 2 
Mirroring disks not only provides fault tolerance, but can also impact performance. 
Multiple reads and writes to the disks are performed each time new data is accessed or 
saved. Because data is read from both mirrored volumes, this can increase performance 
because two different disks are reading the data at the same time. However, when data is 
written to the mirrored disks, there is a decrease in performance, because both disks 
must have the same data written to them.

Fault Management and Disaster Recovery • Chapter 10 
635 
Another drawback to disk mirroring is cost. For every hard disk the company wants 
mirrored, a second hard disk must be purchased. Since this means that the cost of pur- 
chasing hard disks doubles, you should determine which computers are necessary to 
numerous users, or are mission critical to business functions. While many servers in an 
organization might benefit from being mirrored, mirroring every computer on the net- 
work would be expensive and generally unnecessary. 
A variation of mirroring that provides greater fault tolerance is duplexing. 
Duplexing ensures fault tolerance not just with your data, but also with your disk con- 
troller. With traditional mirroring there is one disk controller. If the controller fails, both 
disks become unavailable until that component is replaced. As shown in Figure 10.7, 
duplexing has each disk installed on a different controller. If one of the disks fails or a 
controller fails, the data is still available through the other disk in the pair. 
Figure 10.7 Duplexing 
Ha~': Disk Contr~lier 2 
Hard Disk i 
Hard Di~ 2 
Duplexing also provides an added benefit over mirroring in terms of performance. 
Because each hard disk uses its own controller, this can speed up response time when 
writing to disk. With mirroring, added performance is only seen when data is being read 
from both disks. With duplexing, there is added performance in both reading from and 
writing to the disk. 
:.. 
M WARNING 
The difference between disk mirroring and duplexing is in the disk controllers. 
With disk mirroring, one controller is used for the disks in the mirrored set. 
With disk duplexing, there is one controller for each disk. Duplexing provides 
~ 
added fault tolerance, because if one of the controllers fails, the other controller 
will still be able to access data on one of the disks in the mirrored set.

Chapter 10 • Fault Management and Disaster Recovery 
Striping With and Without Parity 
Disk striping is used to write data across a set of disks. In disk striping, data is written in 
stripes across a volume that has been created from areas of free space. These areas are all 
the same size and spread over an array of up to 32 disks. Data is spread out across the 
disks, thereby improving performance because data is read from and written to multiple 
disks. Rather than data being stored on one drive, striping has multiple drives all acting 
to get a piece of data. 
When data is written across multiple hard disks using disk striping, data is divided 
into blocks that are spread equally over all disks. Each stripe is the size of the smallest 
partition on the set of disks, so if you have three hard disks of different sizes, the stripe 
will be the size of the smallest partition. For example, if you had a 1 GB hard disk, a 200 
MB hard disk, and a 100 MB hard disk, then the largest amount of data on each disk in 
the stripe set would be 100 MB. For this reason, it's important to use hard disks that are 
all the same size (so that space on the hard disks won't be wasted). 
In disk striping with parity, data is written across three or more disks, parity infor- 
mation is kept on the drives. Parity is a calculated value that's used to restore data from 
the other drives if one of the drives in the set fails. It determines the number of odd and 
even bits in a number, and can use this to reconstruct data if a sequence of numbers is 
lost, which is the case if one of the disks fails. Fault tolerance is achieved through the 
parity information stored on the stripe set of hard disks. 
When deciding between striping with or without parity, you are essentially 
weighing performance against fault tolerance. Since parity information has to be calcu- 
lated, the performance of a server can decrease when data is written. However, because 
data is still read from multiple disks at once, performance during reads is the same for 
both types of striping. The major deciding factor comes when considering what will 
happen if a problem occurs with one of the disks. If striping without parity is used, the 
data is unrecoverable from all disks in the stripe set. If striping with parity is used, when 
a disk fails, the performance decreases because the server must reconstruct the data from 
parity information on the other disks. However, the data can be recovered.

DAY TIP 
~~~You~'~ need to remember the fault tolerance Network+ objectives: Power is made 
~ 
fault tolerant with a UPS. Links are made redundant with other links to avoid an 
~ 
issue if a line drops and no communication can take place. Another link us used 
~ 
to keep that from happening, if one link goes down, the other one takes over in 
its place. Also, setting up a hot site, which we will be covering later in the 
chapter, is part of disaster recovery planning. Ensure that you know the differ- 
ences between fault tolerance and disaster recovery; you should know what 
fault tolerance is comprised of, as well as what you can do to provide disaster 
recovery. 
Clustering and Load Balanckng 
While it's important to provide fault tolerance for data, power and other elements of 
your network, the servers that are critical to an organization shouldn't be overlooked in 
your fault tolerance plans. A common method of making servers fault tolerant and 
improving their performance is clustering. 
Server clustering is a method of grouping individual computers together. Each of 
these computers works together as a unit, and appears to the network as a single system. 
By being clustered, the servers are able to handle a shared workload and gain fault 
tolerance. 
Each computer that is part of a cluster is called a node. These nodes communicate 
with one another by sending out messages called heartbeats. If the other computers in a 
cluster fail to detect the heartbeat of one of the other computers, it considers this com- 
puter to be unavailable. At this point, a failover occurs, whereby the resources of the 
failed computer are taken off:line and another computer begins providing those services. 
Because the cluster appears as a single system on the network, users of the network 
don't notice such failures. The cluster simply appears to users as a server that's highly 
available. If a service is requested from one server that normally provides the service, and 
that server isn't available, the service is transparently provided by one of the other servers 
in the network. This makes it appear to users of the network as if nothing was wrong 
with the server, and that everything is functioning normally.

Chapter 10 • Fault Management and Disaster Recovery 
Servers can be configured as part of a cluster through software packages, or possibly 
through a service provided with the network operating system (NOS). While clustering 
isn't available in every operating system, some do provide cluster services. For example, 
Windows 2003 Server Enterprise and Datacenter editions allow up to eight computers 
to be part of a cluster. Depending on the NOS on your servers, the ability to create a 
cluster may already exist in your network. 
In addition to making resources in the cluster highly available, a server cluster can 
also be used for load balancing. Load balancing allows the normal workload of a server to 
be divided among multiple computers. This improves performance because more than 
one computer is processing requests and providing services. 
The load balancing features of a cluster are particularly important when large num- 
bers of network users access the same services or resources, or where the number of 
users is difficult to predict. For example, a Web server may host a website that gets a sig- 
nificant number of hits. Because of the number of people visiting this site, too many hits 
could overwhelm the server's ability to serve requests and could potentially cause the 
server to crash. By having the Web server as part of a cluster, requests are distributed 
among multiple servers in the cluster, improving performance and increasing the ability 
to service requests. 
Disaster Recovery Plan 
~
I
n
 
the last few 
there have been a number of disasters or potential threats that busi- 
years, 
nesses have faced. The Y2K bug caused programmers and other computer personnel to 
rewrite code and upgrade equipment, and brought the need for disaster recovery and 
business continuity to the forefront. The need for such planning gained emphasis when 
massive power failures, terrorism, tsunamis, earthquakes, and numerous other events 
bankrupted businesses and cost billions of dollars in damage. With some of these events, 
equipment, data, and personnel were destroyed, and the economic ripples were felt 
internationally. While some companies experienced varying levels of downtime, some 
never recovered. Many of these events were extreme circumstances that were difficult or 
impossible to predict, and numerous companies relied on disaster recovery plans for 
guidance on how to deal with the incidents as they occurred. 
Many thoughts about disasters are associated with catastrophic events in nature. 
Disaster recovery plans actually deal with a multitude of incidents that could negatively 
impact on the company's ability to function. As we discussed previously, disasters can 
stem from human, environmental, internal, external, intentional, or accidental causes. 
Because of the variety of sources that can cause a disaster, it is important that as many 
potential causes as possible are addressed in the documentation. 
In the same way, it is also vital that the disaster recovery plan recognizes the ele- 
ments that are needed to restore the business and may be affected by a disaster. Elements 
that must be considered are:

Equipment, which includes any devices necessary to the organization, 
including servers, workstations, or other hardware technology (such as x-ray 
machines in hospitals or a transmission tower used to dispatch ambulances). 
n 
Software, which includes operating systems, applications, and other programs 
that are required for normal practices. 
• 
Personnel, which are the people employed and involved with the company. 
Since certain members of the organization (or those under contract to perform 
specific services) may have distinct skills, it would be a major loss if they 
became unavailable. 
• 
Facilities, which consists of offices or other locations. Facilities are necessary to 
house the previous elements we've discussed. 
In looking at these elements of the business, it is easy to see that omitting any of these 
issues could prove detrimental to restoring the business, and must be addressed before any 
of these areas of the business are lost. Preparation for disaster recovery begins long before a 
disaster actually occurs, and will reference a number of other policies, procedures, and doc- 
uments. As we discussed earlier, notification documentation is required to outline who is 
to be called to deal with certain incidents, while other procedures provide information on 
how to restore specific business functions. This includes procedures on backing up and 
restoring data, alternate sites and equipment, and other activities we'll discuss later in this 
chapter. While it is hoped that such preparation is never needed, it is vital that these strate- 
gies are already in place to deal with incidents if they occur.

Backup and Restore 
Backing up data is a fundamental part of any disaster recovery plan. When data is backed 
up, it is copied to a type of media that can be stored in a separate location. The type of 
media will vary depending on the amount of data being copied, but can include digital 
audio tape (DAT), digital linear tape (DLT), compact disks (CDR/CD-R.W), or even 
floppy disks. If on-site data is destroyed, it can then be restored as if nothing had happened. 
When making backups, you need to decide which data will be copied to alternative 
media. Critical data, such as trade secrets that the business relies on to function, and 
other important data crucial to the business needs must be backed up. Other data, such 
as temporary files, applications, and other data may not be backed up, as they can easily 
be reinstalled or missed in a backup. Such decisions, however, will vary from company to 
company. 
Once you've decided on which information has to be backed up, you can then 
determine the type of backup that will be performed. Depending on the type of backup 
selected in the software you're using, the archive bit on files may be read and modified. 
The archive bit is an attribute of the file, and is used by the backup software to deter- 
mine whether a file has changed since a previous backup. When a file is opened and 
used, the bit is turned on to indicate that it has to be included in the next backup. 
When the file is backed up, the archive bit is turned off to indicate the file has been 
backed up. Depending on the type of backup performed, the backup utility may look at 
the archive bit to back up only files that have been modified since the last backup. 
Common backup types include: 
• 
Full backup, which backs up all data in a single backup job. Generally, this will 
include all data, system files, and software on a system. When each file is 
backed up, the archive bit is changed to indicate that the file was backed up. 
• 
Incremental backup, which backs up all data that was changed since the last 
full, incremental or differential backup. Because only files that have changed are 
backed up, this type of backup takes the least amount of time to perform. 
When each file is backed up, the archive bit is changed. 

Fault Management and Disaster Recovery • Chapter 10 
641 
• 
Differential backup, which backs up all data that has changed since the last full 
backup. When this type of backup is performed, the archive bit isn't changed, 
so data on one differential backup will contain the same information as the 
previous differential backup plus any additional files that have changed. 
• 
Copy backup, which makes a full backup but doesn't change the archive bit. 
Because the archive bit isn't marked, it will not affect any incremental or dif- 
ferential backups that are performed. 
Because different types of backups will copy different types of data, the methods 
used to back up data will vary between businesses. One company may make daily full 
backups, while another may use a combination of full and incremental backups (or full 
and differential backups). As we'll see in later sections, this will affect how data is recov- 
ered. Regardless of the type used, however, it is important that data is backed up on a 
daily basis, so large amounts of data won't be lost in the event of a disaster. 
'~T DAY TIP 
~ The archive bit is the key to understanding the various types of backups that 
F may be performed. Remember that the archive bit is an attribute of the file (just 
:

.:a~;'a:., 
as read-only or hidden are file attributes). 
Full backups and copy backups will both back up everything, but a copy 
backup won't change the archive bit on each file. Incremental backups back up 
everything that has changed, and will change the archive bit on each file it 
backs up. Differential backups back up everything since the last full backup, but 
won't change the archive bit. 
Rotation Schemes 
As we'll see in the next section, it is important to keep at least one set of backup tapes 
offsite so that all of the tapes aren't kept in a single physical location. If backup tapes 
were kept in the same location as the servers that were backed up, all of the data (on the 
server and the backup tapes) could be destroyed in a disaster (such as a fire or flood). By 
rotating sets of backups, data isn't always being backed up to the same tapes, and a pre- 
vious set is always available in another location. 
A popular rotation scheme is the Grandfather-Father-Son (GFS) rotation, which 
organizes rotation into a daffy, weekly, and monthly set of tapes. With a GFS backup 
schedule, at least one full backup is performed per week, with differential or incremental 
backups performed on other days of the week. At the end of the week, the daily and 
weekly backups are stored offsite, and another set is used through the next week. To 
understand this better, let's assume a company is open from Monday to Friday. As shown 
www.syngress.com 

642 
Chapter 10 • Fault Management and Disaster Recovery 
in Table 10.2, a full backup of the server's volumes is performed every Monday, with dif- 
ferential backups performed Tuesday through Friday. On Friday, the tapes are then 
moved to another location, and another set of tapes is used for the following week.

tapes moved offsite 
Because it would be too expensive to continually be using new tapes, old tapes are 
reused for backups. A tape set for each week in the month would be rotated back into 
service and reused. For example, at the beginning of each month, the tape set for the 
first week of the previous month would be rotated back into service, and used for that 
week's backup jobs. Because one set of tapes are used for each week of the month, this 
means that you have most sets of tapes kept offsite. Even if one set was corrupted, the set 
of tapes for the week previous to this could still be used to restore data. 
In the Grandfather-Father-Son rotation scheme, the full backup is considered the 
Father, and the daily backup is considered the Son. The Grandfather segment of the GFS 
rotation is an additional full backup that's performed monthly, and stored offsite. The 
Grandfather tape isn't reused, but is permanently stored offsite. Each of the Grandfather 
tapes can be kept for a specific amount of time (such as a year), so that data can be 
restored from previous backups, even after the Father and Son tapes have been rotated 
back into service. If someone needed data restored from several months ago, the 
Grandfather tape enables a network administrator to retrieve the required files. 
While it is important to be diligent in backing up data, it is important to realize that 
a backup is only as good as its ability to be restored. Too often, backup jobs are routinely 
performed, but the network administrator never knows whether the backup was per- 
formed properly until the data has to be restored. To ensure that data is being backed up 
properly, and can be restored correctly, you should perform test restores of data to the 
server. This can be as simple as attempting to restore a directory or small group of files 
from the backup tape to another location on the server.

Restoring Backups 
Because the entire point of backing up data is so that you can restore it at some later 
point, it is important to learn how to properly restore the data. Data from a backup may 
be restored to the same or a different computer. When it is restored, the type of backup 
that was used will affect how it is restored, and will determine the time it will take to 
perform this task. 
Full and copy backups take longer to perform, but are the fastest to restore. When 
only full or copy backups are performed, all of the files are backed up, regardless of 
whether they've changed since the last full backup. As these types of backup jobs can fit 
on a single tape (or set of tapes), you only need to restore the last backup tape or set that 
was used. 
www.syngress.com 

644 
Chapter 10 • Fault Management and Disaster Recovery 
Incremental backups take the longest amount of time to restore, but they're the 
fastest method of backing up the data. Incremental backups contain all data that has 
changed since the last full or incremental backup. Because of this, if it has been a while 
since the last full backup was created, many tapes may be used to store a large number of 
different incremental backup jobs. When this type of backup is used, you need to restore 
the last full backup and each incremental backup that was made since. Therefore, if a full 
backup was created every week and incremental backups were created every night after, 
you would have to restore the tape with the full backup, and then restore the six incre- 
mental backup jobs that took place afterward. 
Differential backups take less time and fewer tapes to restore than incremental 
backups. Because differential backups will back up all data that was changed since the 
last full backup, only two tapes are needed to restore a system.You need to restore the 
tape containing the last full backup and the tape containing a last differential backup job. 
Since different types of backups have their own advantages and disadvantages, you 
will need to consider which type of backup will be suitable for your needs. Some types 
take longer than others to back up or restore, so you will need to decide whether you 
want data backed up quickly or restored quickly when needed. To aid you in your deci- 
sion, Table 10.3 provides information on different aspects of backup types.

that data contained in 
the last differential 
backup is also backed 
up in the next differen- 
tial backup. 
Offsite Storage 
Once backups have been performed, you shouldn't keep all the backup tapes in the 
same location as the machines you've backed up. After all, a major reason you're per- 
forming backups is to have the backed up data available in case of a disaster. If a fire or 
flood occurred and destroyed the server room, any backup tapes in that room could also 
be destroyed. This would make it pointless to have gone through the work of backing up 
data. To protect your data, you should store the backups in a different location so that 
they'll be safe until they're needed. 
Offsite storage can be achieved in a number of ways. If your company has multiple 
buildings, such as in different cities, the backups from other sites can be stored in one of 
those buildings and the backups for servers in that building can be stored in another 
building. If this isn't possible, you can consider using a firm that provides offsite storage 
facilities. The key is to keep the backups away from the physical location of the 
original data. 
When deciding on an offsite storage facility, you should ensure that it is secure and 
has the environmental conditions necessary to keep the backups safe.You should also 
ensure that the site has air conditioning and heating, as temperature changes may affect 
the integrity of data. It should also be protected from moisture and flooding, and have 
fire protection in case a disaster befalls the storage facility. The backups have to be 
locked up and there should be strict policies on who can pick up the data when 
needed.You don't want someone posing as a member of your organization and taking 
off with your data. Conversely, you want the data to be accessible when needed so that 
you can acquire the data from the facility right away without having to wait until the 
next time the building is open for business.

Hot and Cold Spares 
While its important to have data available to be restored through backups, you will also 
want backup equipment available. Spare equipment allows you to replace existing equip- 
ment if a problem occurs. If a system fails or if the equipment is damaged or destroyed, 
the replacement can be switched in automatically, booted up manually, or set up from 
scratch. There are two different types of spares that can be used in these situations: 
• 
Hot Spares 
• 
Cold Spares 
Hot spares are replacement devices that are already running and can be used as soon 
as a problem occurs. If the current system fails, the hot spare can be used with little to 
no work on the part of the network administrator. In some cases, a computer providing 
an essential service to a network may have a failover computer running in parallel. The 
failover computer routinely checks the first machine to see that it's running. If the 
failover machine doesn't receive a response to its checks, it automatically takes over the 
role of the first machine. In other cases, a hot spare may be an identically configured 
server or other device that is offline that can simply be powered up to replace the orig- 
inal computer or device. Regardless of how the hot spare is implemented, it is always 
ready to be used immediately. 
Cold spares are more commonly used in computer environments because there is 
less management and lower costs. Rather than running or storing a redundant machine 
that must be updated with identical hardware, software, and configuration settings, a cold 
spare is simply a computer or device that can be set up to replace an existing machine 
or component. When a problem occurs, the cold spare is installed and configured to 
replace the failed device. For example, if a server fails, another computer can be set up 
and configured, then loaded with data from a recent backup of the failed server. 
Needless to say, the drawback to using a cold spare is that it takes longer to implement 
in a disaster. 
I"e 
°rk+ I Hot, Warm, and Cold Sites 
~ 
Just as replacement equipment may be necessary in a disaster, facilities may also be dam- 
------- aged or destroyed so that a substitute site is needed. Alternate sites are important to cer- 
tain companies so they experience minimal downtime or almost no downtime at all. 
When a disaster occurs, the company will require a temporary facility in which data can 
be restored to servers, and business functions can resume. Without such a facility, the 
company would need to scout for a new business location, purchase new equipment, set 
it up, and then go live. When the company is not prepared, such activities could take so 
long that the disaster could put them out of business. 

Fault Management and Disaster Recovery • Chapter 10 
647 
As is the case with spare equipment, there are different flavors of sites that may be 
used in a disaster. They are: 
• 
Hot sites, which are set up with everything necessary to resume normal busi- 
ness functions immediately, or almost immediately. 
• 
Warm sites, which are partially set up to resume normal operations, but require 
additional work to make everything operational. 
• 
Cold sites, in which very little has been set up, and significant work is required 
to resume normal functions. 
A hot site is a facility that has the necessary hardware, software, phone lines, and net- 
work connectivity to allow a business to resume normal functions almost immediately. 
This can be a branch office or data centre, but must be online and connected to the 
production network. A copy of data is held on a server at that location so little or no 
data is lost. The site may also have servers configured to have replication of data from 
production servers occurring in real time so that an exact duplicate of the system is 
ready when needed. In other instances, the bulk of data is stored on servers and only a 
minimal amount of data has to be restored. This allows business functions to resume very 
quickly, with almost zero downtime. 
A warm site is not as equipped as a hot site, but has part of the necessary hardware, 
software, and other office needs to restore normal business functions. Such a site may 
have most of the equipment necessary, but will still need work to bring it online so that 
it can support the needs of the business. With such a site, the bulk of data will have to 
be restored to servers and additional work (such as activating phone lines or other ser- 
vices) will have to be done. With this type of site, no data is replicated to the server, so 
backup tapes must be restored so that data on the servers is recent. 
A cold site requires the most work to set up, as it is neither online nor part of the 
production network. It may have all or part of the necessary equipment and resources 
needed to resume business activities, but installation is required and data has to be 
restored to servers. Additional work (such as activating phone lines and other services) 
will also have to be done. The major difference between a cold site and hot site is that a 
hot site can be used immediately when a disaster occurs, while a cold site must be built 
from scratch. 
When deciding on appropriate locations for such sites, it is important that they be 
in different geographical locations. If the alternate site is not a significant distance from 
the primary site, it can fall victim to the same disaster. Imagine having a cold site across 
the road from a company when an earthquake happens. Both sites would experience the 
same disaster, so now there would be no alternate site available to resume business. On 
the other hand, you don't want the alternate site so far away that it will significantly add 
to downtime. If the IT staff needs to get on a plane and fly overseas to another office, 
this can increase the downtime and result in additional losses. Designate a site that's close

enough to work from (such as 100 miles away), but not so far that its distance will 
become a major issue when a disaster occurs.

how you gauge the level of work needed to use spare equipment or an alter-

Business Continuity Plan 
A business continuity plan (BCP) is used to ensure that a business can continue to func- 
tion despite any disasters or other threats. The business continuity plan identifies the key 
functions of a business and the risks that are most likely to endanger it. Once these threats 
are identified, a series of procedures are created to ensure that the normal functions of the 
business won't be interrupted, or at least won't be interrupted for very long. In doing so, 
the organization gains the ability to operate under almost any circumstances. 
Business continuity planning involves creating a collection of plans that address dif- 
ferent areas of the business, and focus on restoring the business as a whole. If a threat 
becomes an actual problem, the procedures provide instructions on how to recover so 
the organization can continue providing services or selling its product to the public. By 
taking a proactive approach to various threats, the company is better able to recover 
from disasters when they occur. Some of the plans that may be incorporated into a busi- 
ness continuity plan include: 
• 
A disaster recovery plan, which provides procedures for recovering from a dis- 
aster after it occurs. 
• 
A business recovery plan, which addresses how the functions of the business 
will resume after a disaster, such as using an alternate facility to conduct busi- 
ness. 
• 
A business resumption plan, which addresses how critical systems and key 
functions will be maintained during a crisis. 
• 
A contingency plan, which addresses the actions that can be taken to restore 
normal business activities after a disaster or accidents or additional problems 
occur during this process. If problems occur while implementing the other 
plans, a contingency plan can be used to continue the process of restoring the 
business. 

Fault Management and Disaster Recovery • Chapter 10 
649 
Before these plans can be created, you first need to understand what is important to 
the business. Business continuity plans begin by identifying the key functions of depart- 
ments within the company and the components that must exist for people to do their 
jobs. Each department in the company should identify the requirements that are critical 
for them to continue functioning and determine which functions they perform that are 
critical to the company as a whole. If a disaster occurs, the business continuity plan can 
then be used to restore those functions. 
Identifying these functions and necessities of different departments can be a long 
and ongoing process. Meetings must be held with managers and key personnel from 
every department within the company, and they must state what functions they perform 
in the organization and what items are necessary to perform their jobs. For example, a 
call center would provide the function of phone soliciting. At a bare minimum, they 
would need phones, lists of phone numbers for potential clients or customers, and scripts 
that the sales people would refer to when making calls. While they may use computers, 
automated calling systems, and other tools, you are seeking the bare elements needed to 
perform their jobs. 
It is crucial that you filter the requirements and functions of each department down 
to what is critical to the company's ability to operate. This is difficult because everyone 
considers himself or herself necessary to a business, even if he or she are not. For 
example, the maintenance staff may see themselves as a vital part of the company, but 
people can clean and empty their own trashcans during a crisis. This would not be the 
case in a cleaning company however, where the cleaners would be essential. From this, 
you can see that the key functions and fundamental personnel vary from one company 
to another. 
While many issues will vary during this analysis from company to company, there are 
some elements that will remain consistent. Personnel will need facilities to perform their 
duties, methods of communication with the outside world (such as cell phones, land fines, 
and e-marl), items to document information (such as office supplies like pens and paper, or 
computer systems), and other components that the business absolutely requires to function. 
By looking at what is needed to conduct business, contingency plans can then be set in 
place to allow those functions to resume in the face of catastrophe. 
Once key functions of the organization have been identified, it is important that 
budgets be created to establish how much money will be assigned to individual compo- 
nents. To put it simply, this involves putting money away for a rainy day. The budgets 
provide a method for the company to continue functioning in a limited capacity, while 
rebuilding or restructuring the business to its previous state. When a system is being 
recovered to a previous state, it doesn't mean that things will be exactly the same as they 
were before. It will take time and money to bring the business back to normal.

~i environments. Fault tolerance and disaster recovery, however, are two topics 
you must know intimately for the Network+ exam. 
Configuration Management 
Unless you're dealing with a small network of only a few computers, once a computer 
or other piece of equipment has been configured, management of the device is neces- 
sary. Configuration management is a practice that involves documentation of a device's 
configuration, as well as keeping that documentation up to date so that any future 
changes can be controlled and tracked. While this seems at face value like a straightfor- 
ward, easy to follow practice, it is one that often falls by the wayside. 
Configuration management is useful for a number of reasons. The documentation 
created on the network can be quickly referenced, allowing you to identify how a 
device was configured, its location on the network, and other detailed information about 
the device. By having this information, you can replace devices and make changes to the 
network quickly. 
By compiling information on the components of your network, you create an 
inventory, which can be used to track items that need to be replaced or upgraded. Most 
organizations have a life cycle for computer equipment, and replace older machines 
every three or four years. Network devices like routers and switches may last longer, but 
they will eventually need to be replaced with newer and faster equipment. Keeping a 
database allows you to schedule upgrades and replacements more easily, because you can 
monitor when the item was installed on the network and whether it is approaching the 
end of its life cycle. 
Managing software and hardware in this fashion also provides a record of computer 
assets that are owned by the company. This information can be useful in budgeting 
replacements and determining insurance needs. If a disaster occurs, the documented 
information can also be used for insurance purposes, allowing you to identify what was 
destroyed or damaged. 
As we'll see late in this chapter, disasters are an important issue in network adminis- 
tration, and to businesses as a whole. If a disaster occurs, the configuration information 
can be used to replace damaged devices, so that they are configured the same as their 
predecessors. For example, if a server was destroyed, you could replace that server with 
another, give it the same name and IP (Internet Protocol) address, and have it provide 
the same services. Except for the time taken to replace the server, users of the network 
might be unaware that a problem even existed. 

Fault Management and Disaster Recovery • Chapter 10 
651 
Documenting Configurations 
Configuration management starts by performing an inventory of network components 
and documenting information about each device. How much data you compile is sub- 
jective, but you should include as many specifics as possible about the machine. 
Information included in a database or series of documents might include: 
• 
The date that the document was last modified, so you can determine whether 
you're looking at the most recent information. 
• 
The asset number, which is a unique number that your organization may 
assign to an asset so that it can be identified within the company. A sticker may 
be used to affix to an item so it can easily be matched to information within a 
database. 
• 
The name of the device, which is the name that a computer, printer, or other 
device is given so that it can be identified on a network. 
• 
The IP address, which is a unique network number that identifies a computer 
or device on a TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) 
network. 
• 
The MAC (Media Access Control) address, which is a unique hardware 
number that identifies the computer on a network. 
• 
The make and model, which identifies who made the device, as well as its 
model number. 
• 
The serial number and product ID, which are numbers or alphanumeric com- 
binations that appear on devices. They can be used to identify a particular 
device when several are in one location, and may be required when calling 
manufacturers, help desks, or service representatives when a problem arises. 
• 
The location, so you can determine the building, floor, and room in which a 
device is located. 
• 
The person who has been issued the device. This is useful when computers, 
PDAs (personal digital assistants) or other devices are issued to a specific 
person. This provides a contact person, and can make it easier to locate the 
device. 
• 
The purchase date, which indicates when the company bought the device. 
• 
The warranty information, including how long the device is under warranty, 
and whether it includes parts and labor, onsite service, etcetera. 
• 
The operating system, which should include the manufacturer, name, and ver- 
sion information (for example, Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional 5.0.2195 
www.syngress.com 

652 
Chapter 10 • Fault Management and Disaster Recovery 
Service Pack 4 Build 2195). This will not only indicate the operating system 
installed, but also whether the latest service packs have been applied. 
• 
Memory, which refers to the amount of physical memory installed on a com- 
puter. This will allow you to determine whether software or upgrades to a 
newer operating system can be installed on a particular machine. 
• 
The processor type, which will often determine whether the computer needs 
to be upgraded, and also whether upgrades of software are possible. 
• 
Hard disk information, including the sizes and number of hard disks, which is 
useful when replacing a RAID array. 
• 
Common and special software. This includes the names and versions of major 
software packages that are used throughout your organization (such as 
Microsoft Office or Internet Explorer), as well as applications that are only 
used on that computer or certain machines in your company. 
• 
Components installed or associated with the device, such as modems, PCI 
(Peripheral Component Interconnect) cards issued with a laptop, or other 
components that were added after the initial purchase of the machine. 
There are a number of methods and tools available to help you acquire most of the 
information to be included in your hardware database. Obviously, the location of the 
device and to whom it was issued are things that a program can't tell you, but other 
information can be acquired using configuration utilities that come with the device or 
those offered by a computer's operating system. Some of these tools are discussed in 
greater detail in Chapter 11, and not only serve as troubleshooting tools, but can be used 
to acquire data about the computer being used and various devices on your network. 
These tools include: 
• 
ipconfig 
• 
ifconfig 
• 
winipcfg 
• 
ping 
• 
System Information 
ipconfig, is a command line tool that allows you to view information about a 
Microsoft Windows NT, 2000, 2003, or XP computer's TCP/IP configuration. On 
UNIX and Linux machines, a similar tool called ifconjig is used to display this informa- 
tion. By typing ipeonfig at the command line (or ifeonfig on UNIX/Linux com- 
puters), you can see how each network card or modem on a computer is configured, 
including the IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway, as well as other important 
information about the network adapter. As shown in Figure 10.8, to view additional 

Fault Management and Disaster Recovery • Chapter 10 
653 
information, including the physical address (MAC address), DHCP (Dynamic Host 
Configuration Protocol) and DNS (Domain Name System) information, you would 
type ipconfig/ALL. 
Figure 10.8 Using ipconfig/ALL on a Windows System 
On most UNIX and Linux distributions, you can use the ifconfig command to 
report the status of the network adapters currently installed on the system.You can also 
use the ifconfig command with the-a argument. As shown in Figure 10.9, you can see 
both versions of the command in use, one reporting interfaces that are up and in use, 
and the other (ifconfig-a), showing all the adapters currently installed, whether they are 
up and in use or down and not in use.

winip~fg is a tool that provides similar information about computers running 
Windows 9x and Windows ME. Like ipconfig, it provides information about the 
TCP/IP configuration of a machine, but does so through a GUI interface. While this 
tool is only available in a limited number of operating systems, it is still another source 
for creating your database of configuration information. 
ping is a tool that's used to test the connectivity of a device that's on a TCP/IP net- 
work, but can also be used to acquire information about a device on a network using 
DNS. Because DNS resolves names to IP addresses, ping can be used to display the IP 
address of a device. For example, if you know the name of a server, network printer, or 
other component of your network, you can type ping followed by the name of that 
device. If the device is found, its IP address will be displayed along with information that 
will help you determine if it is connected to the network.

through the System Information tool. As shown in Figure 10.10, this tool provides infor- 
mation about the make and model of the computer, as well as its name, operating 
system, memory, hard disks, and other installed devices and software. By using this tool, 
the bulk of information needed for your hardware database can be acquired.

Change Control Documentation 
One of the benefits of compiling information about devices on your network is that it 
can allow you to see which devices will be affected by a network change. For example, 
let's say you were planning on changing the IP address of a router, which serves as the 
default gateway for workstations. Since these computers use the router to connect to 
other portions of a network, when this change is made, the default gateway setting of 
these workstations would no longer be valid. By searching your hardware database, you 
can determine which computers use the router as a default gateway and will therefore 
be affected by the change. This allows you to see which computers will have to have 
configuration settings changed so that their settings match the router's new IP address. 
As you can see, one change can cause numerous other changes across the network. 
Because change is inevitable and possibly far-reaching, it's important to maintain 
information about changes. Configuration information stored in a hardware database has 
to be kept up to date. In addition to this, you should also maintain documentation on 
changes that have been made. 
r 
www.syngress.com 

658 
Chapter 10 • Fault Management and Disaster Recovery 
Change control documentation provides a record of changes that have been made to 
a system, which can be used in troubleshooting problems and upgrading systems. When 
creating a change control document, you should begin by describing the change that 
was made and explaining why this change occurred. Changes should not appear to be 
for the sake of change, but have good reasons, such as fixing security vulnerabilities, 
hardware no longer being supported by vendors, new functionality, or any number of 
other reasons. The documentation should then outline how these changes were made, 
detailing the steps you performed. 
By providing details in this manner, you also create a document that gives you back- 
out steps on how to restore a system to its previous state. At times, you will need to 
undo the changes and restore the system to a previous state because of issues resulting 
from a change. In such cases, the change documentation can be used as a reference for 
backtracking the steps taken. 
The procedures you document are a valuable resource when you are recovering 
from a disaster and/or need to install another device or software in the same way. Rather 
than leaving someone to guess at how something should be installed, your documenta- 
tion on the steps you performed can be used to duplicate the installation. Because the 
same steps can be followed, a computer or other device can be set up and configured 
identically to the one it's replacing. 
Logs 
Just as documentation on configurations and changes can be helpful in solving problems 
with your network, so can the logs generated by the software running on these 
machines. Logs are records of events that have occurred and actions that were taken. 
Many systems will provide logs that will give automated information on events that have 
occurred, including accounts that were used to log on, activities performed by users and 
by the system, and problems that transpired. These details make logs a valuable tool 
when troubleshooting problems and identifying adverse incidents (such as intrusions to 
the system). 
On many systems, the logs may be simple text files that are saved to a location on 
the local hard drive or a network server. In other cases, the system will provide a specific 
tool for viewing the information. For example, in Windows NT, 2000, 2003, and XR a 
tool called Event Viewer is used to view a series of logs generated by the operating 
system.As shown in Figure 10.12, Event Viewer allows you to view data stored in the 
following: 
• 
Application log, which contains events that are logged by individual programs 
or applications installed on the operating system. 
• 
Security log, which displays possible security issues that the operating system 
monitors. This includes valid and invalid logon attempts, the use of a specific 
resource by an audited user, and other actions related to security. 

Fault Management and Disaster Recovery • Chapter 10 
659 
System log, which displays events logged by the system components of the 
operating system. Information stored in this log includes facts about drivers 
that failed to load properly, warnings on low disk space and memory, remote 
access attempts and other information on the system itself.

Each of the logs in Event Viewer can be accessed by clicking on the corresponding 
node in the left pane of the application. When a log is selected, the individual events 
recorded in the log are displayed in the right pane of the application. To view specific 
information about an event, you simply double-click its entry in the right pane. 
Logs are also created by other software and devices installed on a computer, or gen- 
erated by devices that have been configured to write information to a file stored on a 
particular computer. For example, firewall software installed on a server would maintain 
its own records of users accessing specific websites, downloaded fries, attempts to access 
restricted resources, and other information. In the same way, a door lock system may 
require a PIN number, biometrics, or a card key before access is granted to the building. 
Such systems commonly record authorized and denied entry attempts to a file or series 
of files on a specific computer. In each of these cases, the logs provide a record that can 
be reviewed in the event of a security breach or other problems. 
Password Lists 
Passwords are access codes that use alphanumeric and special characters that allow you to 
log onto operating systems, software, or specific files. Over the years, you've probably 
heard that passwords shouldn't be written down, and should only be remembered. This is 
www.syngress.com 

660 
Chapter 10 • Fault Management and Disaster Recovery 
generally true in most cases, as it would be unwise to have passwords written on little 
pieces of paper and carried in wallets, left on desks, or stuck to the monitors of com- 
puters. However, there may be times when you're unavailable and other members of the 
IT staff need a particular password to fix a problem. Because of this, passwords should 
also be documented so others can use them. 
Password lists should contain all of the passwords used to perform administrative or 
maintenance tasks on the network. This includes passwords for: 
• 
The Administrator account on servers and workstations 
• 
Accounts that have access to modify other accounts, in case management of 
network accounts are needed 
• 
Setup and configuration utilities on computers and other devices 
• 
Administrative features in software 
• 
Files, such as those containing other passwords or documentation containing 
procedures 
Once this list is prepared, it should be stored in a secure location that is known to 
key personnel and that can be accessed only by them. This might be a safe, locked cab- 
inet in a branch office where tape backups are stored, or a safe deposit box at a bank. In 
an emergency, this list can then be used to perform tasks that are necessary while you're 
unavailable, or that you can't perform because of unforeseen circumstances in a disaster 
situation. 
Notification Documentation 
If security is compromised or another major problem occurs, it's important that the right 
people are notified as soon as possible. Notification is vital to dealing with a crisis swiftly 
so that problems aren't left unresolved for an extended period of time, allowing them to 
increase in severity. When critical incidents, such as system failures or intrusions occur, it 
is important that the appropriate person(s) to deal with the situation be called in. 
Notification documentation includes contact information for specific people in an 
organization, their roles, and when they should be called. Having this documentation 
helps to ensure that the appropriate person is called at the appropriate times to deal with 
issues. For example, during regular business hours, the network administrator might be 
called to deal with any issues dealing with the network. After work and on weekends 
however, the members of the IT department may rotate the duty of being on-call, so 
that a different member of the staff is responsible for fixing problems during off-hours. If 
the organization calls the on-call person, and he or she is unable to fix the problem, it is 
at that point that the on-call person would contact the network administrator. In doing 
so, the right person for the right job is called in the right order. 
Having a call order or chain of command is important to notification procedures. 
After all, while the bosses of a company may claim they want to be notified of problems, 

Fault Management and Disaster Recovery • Chapter 10 
661 
chances are they won't appreciate being called in the middle of the night because 
someone forgot a password. At the same time, you don't want everyone in the organiza- 
tion being able to contact you directly, or you might get dozens of phone calls at home 
about the same problem. Even worse, you may get calls about inane problems that don't 
warrant your being called at home (such as someone needing their maiden name 
changed to their married name on a system, or someone being unable to find a partic- 
ular Web page on the corporate intranet). 
During off-hours, people need to know that problems are to go through a particular 
person or group of people who have a list of people to notify. This might be a help 
desk, receptionists, dispatchers, or others who have a twenty-four hour shift rotation (or 
are at least there when you're not). The person or department who has the notification 
list acts as a filter for problems, and has the responsibility of determining who to call, or 
if it's necessary to call someone in after normal business hours are over. 
Those responsible for notifying people need to have up-to-date information on how 
to contact members of the IT staff and certain other employees within the organization. 
If the problem is catastrophic, such as a fire at a particular office building, then manage- 
ment and various IT staff members may need to be called in. Those who are called in to 
solve a problem can then determine if additional persons need to be contacted. 
The contact information included in notification documentation should provide 
several methods of contacting the appropriate person. The list of people to contact 
might include each person's name, role in the organization, and pager number. Extensive 
information might include phone extension within the company, home phone number, 
cell phone number, address, and other information that will ensure the person can be 
contacted. If such extensive information isn't included with the notification documenta- 
tion, then it should reference where additional contact information should also be avail- 
able, such as an employee database. 
Notification procedures should also include contact information for certain outside 
parties who are contracted to support specific systems. For example, if there is a problem 
with the air conditioner in a server room, then a heating/cooling company that's under 
contract might be called in to fix the system. However, when outside parties are called 
in on an emergency basis, it's important to remember that other procedures and prac- 
tices are still followed (such as signing them in and out of secure areas). Except in 
extreme circumstances, the policies of a company shouldn't be ignored in a crisis. 
Although notification procedures may be a starting point in a disaster, other plans, poli- 
cies and procedures also come into play.

Business continuity plans must be created before a disaster occurs. A business conti-

nuity plan identifies key functions of an organization and the threats that most likely 
endanger them, and creates processes and procedures that ensure these functions won't 
be interrupted in the face of an incident. A business continuity plan consists of a disaster 
recovery plan, a business recovery plan that addresses how business functions will resume 
at an alternate site, and a business resumption plan that addresses how critical systems 
and key functions of the business will be maintained. Contingency plans may also be 
created to outline the actions that can be performed to restore normal business activities 
after a disaster and actions that can be taken if an initial plan fails. 
Disaster recovery plans provide procedures for restoring technologies and other 
functions necessary to the business after a disaster occurs. They also provide insight into

methods for preparing for the recovery should the need arise. Because preparation for 
disaster recovery begins long before a disaster actually occurs, the plan will address such 
issues as proper methods for backing up data, offsite storage, alternate sites, and replace-

documents and methods provide a proactive approach to dealing with incidents before

Fault Tolerance 
[-----d Fault tolerance is the ability of a system, device, or network to continue 
functioning despite a malfunction or an event that causes failure. 
Uninterruptible power supplies (UPSs) are used to provide battery power to 
devices when normal sources of electricity become unavailable. 
V------d Link redundancy is used to provide redundant paths of communication 
between sites so that if one network connection between sites fails, another 
can be used to maintain a link.

V,-4I RAID is a technology that was developed to prevent the loss of data and/or 
improve performance by writing data across a set of hard disks, or writing a 
duplicate of data from one hard disk to another. 
I-4I Disk mirroring ensures that data written to one hard disk is also written to 
i
another, so that each drive has an exact copy of the data. Disk duplexing also 
does this, but each disk drive has its own controller. 
V,-4I Disk striping is used to write data across a set of disks. When the data is 
written across multiple hard disks, it is divided into blocks, which are spread 
........ 
equally over all disks.

facilities are unavailable or uninhabitable. Hot sites have everything necessary 
to resume normal business functions immediately, or almost immediately, while 
warm sites require some additional work. Cold sites have very little pre- 
existing setup, and require significant work to be functional.

Q" I've implemented RAID for fault tolerance my server's operating system, but still 
have to shut down the system to remove and replace a failed hard disk. Is there any 
way to implement RAID without having to shut down the server when a disk 
needs replacing? 
A" RAID can be implemented through hardware, which can support hot swapping, in 
which a disk can be removed from the server without having to shut the server 
down. Software RAID takes a higher toll on the system, as RAID functions must 
run through the operating system running on the machine. Because of this, hot 
swapping is often unsupported through the operating system, which is why you 
must take down the system to replace a disk. 
Q" I work for a small company that only has one facility, so storing backup tapes at 
another site isn't an option. What can I do to keep the backup tapes safe in case of a 
disaster? 
A" There are many options for storing backup tapes o~ite. A safety deposit box could be 
rented at a bank to store the backup tapes, or a firm that provides storage facilities for 
.........................
backups could be hired. When deciding on a storage facility, ensure that it's secure and 
has protection against fires and other disasters.You don't want to store your backups in 
a location that has a higher likelihood of risk than your own facilities. 
Q: The company I work for can't afford to have an alternate site with additional com- 
puters and other equipment installed, which may never be used. What can I do to 
provide a disaster recovery plan that provides an alternate site? 
A" Large companies are the only ones who can generally afford hot sites. Small- to 
medium-sized companies may opt for warm or cold sites, where more work is 
required to set up equipment and other necessities of the business in a disaster. If 
even this is out of reach for the company, then try to implement as many other 
items in a disaster recovery plan as you can, and create an emergency budget that 
will allow you to rent facilities and purchase equipment if a disaster occurs. Even if 
you can't do everything, some preparation is better than none.

plans and procedures will be effective during a disaster. How can I be sure? 
A" Perform dry runs of the disaster recovery plan to ensure that developed strategies 
work as expected, and revise any steps that are ineffective.

1. As shown in the following illustration, a company has its main office in Manhattan 
and branch offices in Brooklyn and Queens. A T1 line connects Brooklyn to 
Manhattan, while another T1 line connects Manhattan to Queens. Because 
Brooklyn and Queens are both connected to Manhattan, this enables them to 
exchange data with one another.You have concerns that if either of the T1 lines go 
down, the business will be unable to function normally. Because of the importance 
of each of these sites communicating with one another, fault tolerance for the links 
between them is necessary but cost is a concern. Which of the following will you 
do to implement fault tolerance?

7. An intruder has gained access to your website through a service on the server, and 
damaged a number of files needed by the company. The service isn't necessary to 
the Web server's functionality, and as near as you can tell isn't used by any software 
or users of the company. This Web server is used to provide a presence for the 
company on the Internet, and is used for public relations as well as to provide 
information on the company's products. During the intrusion, you were working 
on upgrading a router in another part of the building, which is why you didn't 
notice audit notifications sent to your e-mail address. These audit notifications 
could have tipped you off about suspicious activity on the server, but now that 
you're aware of the problem, you're concerned that a repeat attack may occur 
while you're fixing the problem. Which of the following actions will you immedi- 
ately take in resolving this situation? 
A. Recover data files that were damaged in the attack.

Continue upgrading the router so that you can focus on audit notifications 
that may occur. 
C. Remove the unneeded services running on the server. 
D. Remove the Web server from the Internet until there is no further risk of 
being hacked.

Chapter 11 
• Network Troubleshooting Tools 
Introduction 
Throughout this exam guide, we've talked about the fundamentals of network protocols 
and network operating systems. In this chapter, we'll bring together that knowledge to 
help you in troubleshooting any errors or problems that occur on your network. We'll 
begin by talking about the overall methodology that you'll use to troubleshoot a net- 
work. This begins with gathering information about a problem to try to determine its 
cause.You'll then use your understanding of networking concepts, as well as your 
knowledge of how your particular network is configured, to isolate the point where the 
problem is occurring. By eliminating points of failure in a systematic fashion, you can 
eliminate trouble spots, one by one, until you've located the cause of the problem. 
Maintaining accurate documentation of the physical layout of your network is essential 
for this process, as is having a firm grasp of the layers of the OSI (Open Systems 
Interconnect) model and the devices that operate at the various layers. 
To help you in troubleshooting your network, there are many software utilities for 
both the Windows and Linux operating systems that will help you pinpoint the exact 
nature of a failure.You'll start with tools that will test basic network connectivity to 
determine if two computers can communicate with each other in any way.You can then 
move onto more detailed tools that will show you every detail about the path that a 
network packet takes to travel from one computer to another, or to gather detailed 
information about name resolution issues.You also have access to a wide range of testers 
for physical network components like network cables and wall jacks. By combining a 
broad understanding of networking concepts with specific knowledge of the different 
troubleshooting tools available to you, you will be able to effectively troubleshoot any 
issues you might face when administering a network. 
Methodology 
Before we talk about specific tools and utilities that you can use to troubleshoot your 
network, it's important that you have an overall structure in place that will help you per- 
form that troubleshooting. Unfortunately, networking technologies haven't advanced to 
the point that a router will flash up an error message like, "My default gateway is mis- 
configured, please correct this." Instead, it is up to you to determine what a problem is 
before you'll be able to go about fixing it. When you're troubleshooting a problem 
relating to network connectivity, you need to have an understanding of your network as 
a whole so that you can determine where the trouble is occurring. One of the key fac- 
tors in network troubleshooting is isolating the issue to figure out whether it's being 
caused by a single workstation or cable, or if it's a larger issue affecting numerous users 
on your network. 

Network Troubleshooting Tools • Chapter 11 
677 
You can break down the troubleshooting process into two major steps: 
• 
Gathering information 
• 
Analyzing the information you've gathered 
Gathering Information About a Problem 
In order to troubleshoot a problem, you first need to identify the problem. This can be a 
challenge when you're trying to gather information from different users on your net- 
work, especially if you're dealing with a situation where you're receiving reports of mul- 
tiple problems at the same time.You need to determine which component of your 
network is causing the issue; this can be a physical component like a network cable, or a 
logical component like the IP (Internet Protocol) configuration for a particular NIC 
(network interface card).You'll use the information you gather to determine which 
component of your network has failed or is misconfigured. 
Your first step should be to gather information from your users about the nature of 
the problem. Some questions you'll probably want to ask include the following: 
1. What is the exact nature of the problem? Try to be as specific as possible 
when making this determination. For example, you may get a report that your 
users are unable to browse external hosts on the Internet. To get a better 
understanding of the problem, you need to determine if they have lost all 
physical connectivity to the outside world, or if it's only a specific application 
that isn't functioning.Your troubleshooting steps will be different if a user can 
ping outside hosts, but not connect to a specific Web server, versus not being 
able to connect to the outside world in any way. 
How many computers are affected by this problem? If the issue is isolated 
to a single computer, it is likely that the cause of the problem will be related to 
the computer itself. If it is affecting all computers on a particular subnet or 
those connected to a particular hub or switch, you can use this information to 
help you in the troubleshooting process.You can probably tell from this that 
your troubleshooting will be far more successful if you have detailed informa- 
tion about your network's physical network topology. Because of this, one of 
the most critical documents you can have on hand when troubleshooting is a 
network diagram detailing the physical layout of your network.You should also 
maintain some type of database containing the IP address configuration of 
your routers, switches, servers, and workstations. 
2. 
When did the problem begin to occur? More specifically, you should find 
out what changed on the network when the issues first began. If your users 
began to experience connectivity issues after you installed a new router, your 
first step will be to check the configuration of the router. Sometimes this can 
take a certain amount of investigation, since you may not be aware of every- 
www.syngress.com 

678 
Chapter 11 • Network Troubleshooting Tools 
thing that's being administered or modified on a large network.Your Internet 
Service Provider (ISP) might have made some changes that you're not aware 
of, which might be causing the connectivity failures. 
Analyzing and Responding to a Problem 
Now that you've collected information about the problem, you need to analyze all of it 
to determine the cause of the problem.You should examine every layer in the OSI 
model, starting at Layer 1. Check your Physical Layer connectivity, like cables, patch 
panels, wall jacks, and hubs. Then work your way up to Layer 2, verifying that any 
switches or switch ports are configured properly. At Layer 3 you'll verify that your 
routers are configured and functioning properly, and then move onto troubleshooting 
the actual application itself at the Transport Layer and beyond. In almost all cases, it's best 
to start at the Physical Layer and work your way up so that you're eliminating the lowest 
common denominator as a potential issue before moving onto more complex trou- 
bleshooting problems. If two computers aren't communicating simply because a cable is 
unplugged, you can save yourself quite a bit of time by starting with the Physical Layer 
and working up from there. 
You'll then want to determine the proper troubleshooting tool to use. We'll spend 
the majority of this chapter talking about the different tools available for your use, but as 
a rule you should start with basic connectivity tools like ping, moving on to other tools 
once you've determined that basic connectivity is in place. The reason we start with 
ping is because it is simple to use and lets you determine at a glance if two nodes on 
your network are able to communicate with each other at the most basic level. It also 
very effectively slices the OSI model in half for you in terms of troubleshooting, since 
ping operates at the Network Layer. For example, if you are able to ping a remote host 
but you cannot FTP (File Transfer Protocol) to it, then you know that the issue lies 
somewhere above the Network Layer, because otherwise ping would not be successful. 
If the ping is unsuccessful, then you know that the issue lies in the Network, Data Link, 
or Physical Layers. 
In Exercise 11.1, we'll look at a common situation where you might use ping to 
investigate a connectivity problem between two computers. Let's say that you're 
troubleshooting a connectivity problem between Computer A, with an IP address of 
192.168.1.1 and subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, and Computer B with an IP address of 
192.168.2.5 and a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0- this is illustrated in Figure 11.1. 
These two computers were able to communicate with each other yesterday, but the two 
computers haven't been able to connect since some changes were made on the network 
yesterday.

TROUBLESHOOTING A CONNECTIVITY ISSUE 
, 
The first thing you should do is go to Computer A and check things out 
for yourself. Use Computer A to ping 192.168.2.5, the IP address of 
Computer B, to confirm that the two computers are unable to commu- 
nicate. 
2. 
If you don't receive a response from Computer B, you need to isolate 
where the failure is taking place. So your next step is to ping the loop- 
back address, 127.0.0.1. You should remember that the Ioopback 
address is a virtual IP address that's used for troubleshooting the TCP/IP 
(Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)installation on a local 
PC. If you are unable to ping the Ioopback address, then TCP/IP is either 
not installed or has become corrupted on the local computer. If this 
ping is successful, the problem does not lie in the TCP/IP stack of 
Computer A. 
3. 
Next, try pinging another machine on the same network segment as 
Computer A, such as 192.168.1.2. If you get a response from another 
machine on the same segment, you know that your local machine's 
TCP/IP stack is functioning properly, and that Computer A is able to con- 
nect to other computers on the same subnetmthis rules out a malfunc- 
tioning NIC or network cable at the Physical Layer. Next, ping the 
default gateway for Computer A to determine if the default gateway is 
functioning. 

680 
Chapter 11 • Network Troubleshooting Tools 
4. 
If your default gateway responds, try pinging another host on the same 
network segment as Computer B, the computer that's failing to 
respond. If you get a response from another computer on Computer B's 
network segment, you know that there are no problems related to 
Computer B's network segment itself. 
5. 
If all of your tests thus far have been successful, but you are still unable 
to contact Computer B, then you have isolated the problem to 
Computer B itself. Perhaps the network cable connecting Computer B to 
the network has gone bad, its network card has failed or needs a new 
driver installed, or its IP configuration is incorrect. 
By approaching the problem systematically, you were able to trace the net- 
work connectivity from one end of the path (Computer A) to the other 
(Computer B). Testing at each step of the journey allowed you to isolate exactly 
where the problem was occurring. 
Network Discovery 
Now, in a perfect world you'll be administering a network that someone has already cre- 
ated detailed configuration diagrams for, so that you'll know exactly what you're working 
with when you need to troubleshoot a problem. In reality, though, we're usually not that 
lucky, and network administrators often find themselves taking over networks that have 
i 

Network Troubleshooting Tools • Chapter 11

litde or no documentation in place, or documentation that hasn't been kept up to date. 
Luckily, there are a number of tools that you can use to perform network discovery, which 
will help you to automatically generate documentation about the devices on your network 
and how they are configured. These network discovery tools will examine a single IP 
address or an entire subnet and gather as much information about the devices on that 
subnet as possible, including their IP addresses, MAC (media access control) addresses, what 
type of operating system the device is running, and even what types of applications are 
installed on the device if it is a server or a workstation computer. 
There are a number of products available that will perform network discovery for 
you, though the majority of them are paid commercial software and are not available as 
free downloads. One such product is a suite of tools from SolarWinds that includes an 
IP Network Browser to perform automatic network discovery, in Figure 11.2. If you are 
taking over a network that has poor or nonexistent network documentation in place, it's 
strongly advisable to invest in one of these network discovery tools; the amount of time 
it will save you in troubleshooting network connectivity issues will more than pay for 
the cost of the tool.

Chapter 11 • Network Troubleshooting Tools 
OSI Model 
As you learned in Chapter 5, the OSI model creates a framework that defines how net- 
working protocols like TCP/IP communicate. Network packets are passed from the 
Physical Layer up to the Application Layer, with each layer adding its own header to the 
packet. When a network packet is passed from one host to another, the receiving host 
will read or analyze the packet one layer at a time, with the Application Layer reading 
the Application Layer header, the Presentation Layer reading the header from the 
Presentation Layer, and so forth. 
You can use your understanding of the OSI model to improve your troubleshooting 
techniques. It's important to understand what takes place at each layer of the OSI 
model, and which devices operate at these layers. When it comes to network trou- 
bleshooting, the most important layers of the model are the Physical, Data Link, 
Network, and Transport Layers. Let's take a look at each of these layers in turn. 
~ 
We are only going to touch on the function of each layer here-refer back to 
Chapter 5 for an in-depth look at the layers of the 051 model. 
The Physical Layer 
The Physical Layer is the lowest layer of the OSI model, and involves the actual elec- 
trical signals that are going from the network cables into the NIC of a computer, switch, 
router, or hub. A failure at the hardware level will usually involve the physical compo- 
nents of a computer or device, such as the cable that connects the computer to the net- 
work or the network card itself. Network hubs also operate at the Physical Layer, so a 
failure in a network hub could also lead to connectivity issues that occur at the Physical 
Layer. The Physical Layer is responsible for a number of different functions, including: 
• 
The type of signal transmission used 
• 
The cable type 
• 
The actual layout or path of the network wiring 
• 
The voltage and electrical signals being used by the network cabling. 
When using the OSI model for troubleshooting, you should know which devices 
operate at which layer. The following physical devices function at the Physical Layer of 
the OSI model: 

Network Troubleshooting Tools • Chapter 11 
683 
• 
Network cabling 
m 
Network interface cards 
[] 
Active and passive hubs 
m 
Repeaters 
When troubleshooting at the Physical Layer, be on the lookout for issues with NIC 
drivers, as well as physical failures of a NIC, hub, or length of cabling. 
LT DAY TIP 
An active hub will boost the signal that's being sent before transmitting it to 
the nodes attached to the hub. A passive hub will simply transmit the informa- 
~ 
tion without any sort of boost. 
The Data Link Layer 
The Data Link Layer is responsible for taking the information from the Physical Layer 
and organizing it into flames. The Data Link Layer takes the information that it receives 
from higher up in the OSI model and passes it down to the Physical Layer to be trans- 
mitted across the wire. The functions of the Data Link Layer include error checking, 
where the Data Link Layer will add error-checking information onto each frame of data 
that it transmits. The Data Link Layer is also responsible for error-free delivery of these 
data frames, as well as maintaining the reliability of the communications between two 
computers. 
The two types of devices that operate at the Data Link Layer of the OSI model are 
switches and bridges. Bridges are able to divide a network into multiple segments, but they 
aren't able to actually subnet a network the way that a router does. So if you use a bridge 
to physically separate two areas of the network, it will still appear to be one big network to 
higher-level protocols in the Network Layer, Transport Layer, and above. Bridges and 
switches are useful for cutting down on network congestion because they can do some 
basic filtering of data traffic based on the MAC address of the destination computer. When 
a transmission reaches the bridge, the bridge will not pass it across to the other side of the 
network if the MAC address of the destination computer is known to be on the same side 
of the network as the sending computer.As a part of this process, the bridge or switch will 
build tables (similar to a routing table) indicating which addresses are on which side, and 
uses them to determine whether to let the transmission across.

Chapter 11 • Network Troubleshooting Tools 
At the Data Link Layer, frames are addressed from one computer to another by 
way of the physical MAC address that's burned into every NIC card. 
The Network Layer 
The Network Layer is where the majority of troubleshooting issues will occur. The 
Network Layer takes the frames it receives from the Data Link Layer and organizes them 
into packets. The Network Layer is also the layer where physical MAC addresses are 
translated into IP addresses. Unlike MAC addresses, which are physically assigned to each 
NIC and can never be changed, IP addresses are logical addresses that can be added, 
modified, and removed as often as you want. This allows a single computer to be moved 
and reconfigured to belong to many different IP subnets throughout the course of its 
life. This flexibility comes at a price, though, since these IP addresses are assigned by 
human administrators and are therefore somewhat prone to misconfiguration and error. 
If you misconfigure a network card's IP address or subnet mask by even a single digit, 
that computer will experience connectivity issues in connecting with local and remote 
computers. The most important physical device at the Network Layer is the router. This is 
the device that uses the logical IP addresses of the Network Layer to transmit network 
packets from one subnet to another. 
Depending on where the problem occurs, failures at the Network Layer can create 
connectivity issues for a single client or an entire subnet. When this happens, the devices 
in question will not be able to communicate with another portion of a network, either 
because of a physical device failure or because a router has been configured with an 
incorrect route, subnet mask, or some other key piece of information. Because Network 
Layer issues can render a computer entirely unable to communicate on a routed net- 
work, they tend to be the most visible troubleshooting issues, so you should have a firm 
grasp of the functions of the Network Layer and the tools you can use to troubleshoot 
here. The best tools to check connectivity at the Network Layer are ping, tracert, 
traceroute, and pathping, which we'll discuss in a later section. 
The Transport Layer 
One a packet has left the Network Layer, the Transport Layer takes over. This is where 
network packets are even further differentiated by the port number that they are using to 
communicate--these port numbers can be for either connection-oriented TCP commu- 
nications or low-overhead connectionless UDP (User Datagram Protocol) applications. 
Any application that has to communicate between two networked computers will have 
to use a particular port number, and the most common services all have well-known 
port numbers that have been assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, or 

Network Troubleshooting Tools • Chapter 11 
685 
IANA. Firewalls and proxy servers will often work at the Transport Layer to filter traffic 
based on the TCP or UDP port that it's using. If you're having issues at the Transport 
Layer, you'll probably find individual network applications that aren't functioning prop- 
erly~like a user who can Telnet to a particular host, but is unable to connect to the 
Web server running on the same computer. 
The Transport Layer is responsible for making sure that data sent by one computer 
arrives at its intended destination in good condition. Sending and receiving computers 
also need a way to differentiate between different communications that may be 
addressed to different applications on the same computer, which is where TCP and 
UPD port numbers become useful. Troubleshooting the Transport Layer is quite similar 
to working at the Application Layer, since the TCP and UDP protocols form the basis of 
the ports that are used by all network applications. So you can use telnet to see if a par- 
ticular port is listening on the destination machine, and you can use the netstat utility 
(which we'll discuss in the next section) to see a list of all ports that are listening on a 
particular machine. 
Windows Tools 
Because TCP/IP has become the default network protocol for Windows operating sys- 
tems, it's important to have a good understanding of TCP/IP troubleshooting when 
working with any of the Microsoft operating systems. Windows computers have a 
number of built-in utilities that will assist you in troubleshooting TCP/IP problems 
relating to basic connectivity and name resolution. The most common tools that you 
should be aware of include the following: 
• 
ping 
• 
nslookup 
• 
tracert 
• 
arp 
• 
ipconfig 
• 
nbtstat 
• 
netstat 
• 
pathping (new to Windows 2000 and Windows XP) 
In this section, we'll take a detailed look at each of these tools, including what the 
tool is used for and what type of output it produces. We'll also look at some examples of 
how to apply these tools (and other more advanced tools that won't necessarily appear 
on the Network+ exam) to troubleshoot a particular problem.

ing 
The ping command, which stands for Packet INternet Groper and uses ICMP (Internet 
Control Message Protocol) echo messages to communicate with other computers.You'll usu- 
ally use the ping command to test basic TCP/IP connectivity between two computers. 
You can ping a computer using either its IP address or its hostname. The ping command 
has the following switches: 
ping -t will ping a specified host continuously until you stop it by typing Ctrl 
+ C. Typing Ctrl + Break will show you statistics on the ping results and 
then continue. 
-a resolves IP addresses to hostnames. For example, if you ping a computer 
with the IP address 192.168.1.101 and you need to find out its DNS (Domain 
Name System) name, you can ping using the -a switch to produce the fol- 
lowing output:

• 
-n will let you specify the number of ping packets to send. For example, the 
command ping -n 10 192.168.1.101 will send 10 ping packets to the speci- 
fied host. 
• 
-w specifies how long each packet should wait before it times out and returns 
a "Request timed out" error. The default value is 1000 milliseconds. 
• 
-i will change the default Time To Live (TTL) for the ICMP echo messages 
used by the ping command. By default, the TTL is 252, which means that a 
ping command can pass through 252 router hops before the packet is dropped. 
You can alter this value by using the -i switch.

tracert 
The tracert utility allows you to trace the path that a network packet will take from one 
host to another. A network packet will often have to pass through several routers or hops 
to reach its destination, and you can use tracert to determine whether one of these 
routers, or a link between two routers, is overloaded or has failed. The tracert utility 
works by sending a series of ICMP echo requests, much like the ping utility. For 
example, when you type tracert www.digitalthink.com at the command prompt, 
you'll see output that resembles the following: 
C:\>tracert www.digitalthink.com

Each line in the tracert output indicates one hop on the path between your local 
computer and the destination. The three numbers at the beginning of each line indicate 
the round-trip response time for a single ping to get to that router and back. As you can 
see in the example above, this ping is sent three times to each router. There are also 
some command line switches that you can use to customize the tracert output: 
• 
tracert -d will instruct tracert not to resolve IP addresses to hostnames (this 
will increase the speed of the tracert). 
• 
tracert -h maximum_hops will indicate the maximum number of hops that 
tracert will use to search for a target. If tracert reaches this maximum number 
and hasn't reached the target yet, it will quit. The default value is 30 hops. 
• 
tracert -w timeout indicates the amount of time each ping will wait for each 
reply, in milliseconds. The default value is 1000 milliseconds.

request messages to each router along the path to the destination host, and will calculate 
how long it takes each router to reply. The pathping tool combines the capabilities of 
both tracert and ping, and gives you additional information that you can't get easily 
from using either tool individually, pathping will calculate the following information 
each time it runs: 
• 
The amount of time it takes the ping packet to get to the destination host and 
back, called the round-trip. 
• 
The amount of time it takes to ping each individual router. 
• 
The percent of ping requests that are lost at each router. 
• 
The percent of ping requests lost between the touters. 
pathping provides some interesting statistics for network troubleshooting because it 
gives you information regarding where packet loss is taking place, which can indicate that 
a particular router may be overloaded or malfunctioning. For example, when you enter 
the command pathping 192.168.1.101, you'll see the following output:

You should notice that pathping first runs a tracert to the remote host and identifies 
all of the routers along the path to the destination, and shows you a list of those routers 
in the first section of the output. Then, pathping provides statistics about each router and 
each link between the routers. From this information, you can assess whether an indi- 
vidual router is being overworked, or whether there is congestion on a link between 
routers. You can see an illustration of this in Figure 11.3.

The last two columns of the pathping output provide the most useful information 
when you're troubleshooting routers and the links between them. Notice in the last 
column you can see the name of the router, the IP address, and a percentage listed to 
the left of the router. If this percentage is a high number, it means that a large number of 
ping packets are being lost when they're sent to that router. This is an indication that the 
router itself may be overloaded. 
In between the names of the routers in a tracert output, you see a "1" (pipe) char- 
acter like this one:

This represents the link between the router and the next-hop router. When there is 
a large percentage of lost pings for the link, it indicates congestion on the network 
between hops. In this case, you would want to investigate problems with network con- 
gestion, rather than with the router itself. 
arp 
The arp utility allows you to view and manipulate entries in the TCP/IP arp cache.The 
arp cache is a list of MAC addresses for computers that have been recently contacted, so 
that their IP-to-MAC address mapping has been stored by the local computer so it can 
be located again quickly. The arp utility is helpful when troubleshooting problems that 
are related to duplicate IP addresses or duplicate MAC addresses on a particular network 
segment. 
For example, suppose that Computer A and Computer B have inadvertently been 
given the same IP address: 192.168.1.10. Computer A is supposed to be 192.168.1.10, 
and Computer B is supposed to be 192.168.1.11. When machines on the same segment 
as these two computers try to contact 192.168.1.10, they'll send an arp broadcast to 
resolve the IP address to a MAC address. Depending on which computer responds first, 
that will be the computer that they connect to. However, because there are two 
machines with the same IP address, you might connect to different machines at different 
times.You can see the contents of the arp cache by typing arp -a at the command 
prompt.You'll see output similar to the following: 
Interface: 
192.168.1.3 on Interface 0x1000003

The arp utility also allows you to add and delete entries in the arp cache. When you 
add an entry into the arp cache, you create a static entry. A static entry will be listed with 
"static" in the type field when you view the arp cache.You might want to create static 
arp entries for frequently accessed servers on the segment, or perhaps for the default 
gateway. When you create static entries, the source machine won't need to issue arp 
broadcasts to resolve IP addresses to MAC addresses. 
n etstat

The netstat utility will give you a great deal of useful information about the active con- 
nections on a particular computer. It provides you detailed information about each pro- 
tocol and port on a computer that is listening or that has established a connection with 
another computer.You should remember from Chapters 5 and 6 that TCP/IP-based 
applications like FTP and Telnet will communicate using a particular TCP or UDP port. 
When one of these programs or services is running on a computer, it means that port is 
listening for new connection attempts from other computers. A connection listed in 
netstat can be in one of four states: 
Listening means that a particular port is open and waiting for connections, 
but no active connections have been made to it. 
Established means that a particular connection is active~an FTP client has 
connected to an FTP server, a client's Web browser has connected to a World 
Wide Web (WWW) service, and the like.

• 
TimeWait 
means that a connection has been made, but it hasn't received any 
data for some time and is in the process of timing out. 
• 
Close_Wait means that an active connection is being closed. 
The netstat command has a number of command-line switches that will produce 
different types of troubleshooting output. The full syntax of netstat is as follows: 
~ ~  
NETSTAT [-a] [-b] [-e] [-n] [-o] [-p proto] [-r] [-s] [-v] [interval] 
• 
netstat -a displays aH TCP/IP connections and listening ports on the local 
computer, and produces output similar to the following:

the netstat command: 
TCP 192.168.1.3:42 192.168.1.185:3919 ESTABLISHED 
This means that the computer has ESTABLISHED or created a connection 
that's using the TCP protocol. The connection has been made between 
192.168.1.3:42 and 168.1.185:3919, which means that the computer at IP

I"o o,",1 nbtstat 
nbtstat is quite similar to netstat, except that it displays information specifically relating to 
NetBIOS over TCP (NetBT). nbtstat will show you NetBT protocol statistics and 
NetBIOS name tables for local and remote computers, nbtstat will also allow you to dis- 
play and refresh the NetBIOS cache, nbtstat uses the following command-line switches" 
nbtstat -a Computername will display the NetBIOS name cache for a remote 
computer, specified by the computer's NetBIOS hostname. The command 
nbtstat -a DC1 will display the following information:

nbtstat -A IP Address will display the same information as nbtstat -a, but will 
allow you to specify the target machine by IP address instead of NetBIOS 
name. 
• 
nbtstat -c will display the NetBIOS name cache of NetBIOS names that have 
already been resolved on the local computer. This command will show you a 
table of NetBIOS names and their associated IP addresses, as follows:

nbtstat -r will display NetBIOS statistics for the local computer. This will dis- 
play the number of NetBIOS names that have been registered using broadcast 
and a WINS (Windows Internet Name Service) server, and the number of 
NetBIOS names that have been resolved using both of these methods. The -r 
switch displays information in the following format: 
NetBIOS Names Resolution and Registration Statistics

• 
nbtstat -R will purge the current contents of the NetBIOS cache on the local 
machine. In addition to removing any entries in the local cache, nbtstat -P,. 
will also re-load any entries in the local LMHOSTS file that have the "#PR_E" 
tag. Remember that "#PRE" is used in the LMHOSTS file to pre-load a 
NetBIOS name mapping into a machine's NetBIOS cache when it first starts 
up. 
• 
nbtstat -RR will release and refresh any NetBIOS names that are registered 
on the local computer.

ipconfig 
The ~config utility works at the command line to provide you with IP configuration 
data for all NICs installed on your local computer.You can simply type ipconfig by 
itself to see basic information about the NICs in your computer, or you can use a 
number of switches to retrieve more detailed information. At its most basic, the output 
for the ipconfig command will resemble the following:

As you can see, the basic ipconfig command pro;tides you the IP address, subnet 
mask, and default gateway for the NICs installed on a particular machine. This informa- 
tion can be handy as a quick reference when trying to figure out what IP address and 
subnet mask has been assigned to a particular computer, particularly if it receives its IP 
configuration from DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol).You can get more 
detailed information by using the ipeonfig/all command, as you can see here:

By using the ipconfig/all command, you get information about the DNS and WINS 
servers that your computer has been configured with, as well as the MAC address of each 
installed NIC. If you're troubleshooting DNS-related problems, for example, this is a quick 
way to determine the hostname and primary DNS sufftx that your machine is using.

se ipconfig/release and ipconfig/renew to force a DHCP client

'~!~' 
to request a new IP address lease from a DHCP server. 
.~..,.~,,~. 
You can use the ipconfig/flushdns command to clear the DNS cache on the local 
computer. This will force the computer to contact a DNS server for any hostnames that it 
tries to connect to. This is particularly useful if you've recently made changes to your DNS 
records so that your clients can access the most up-to-date DNS information, ipconfig 
/displaydns will show you the contents of the local DNS cache.After typing ipconfig 
/displaydns at the command prompt, you'll see output similar to the following:

ipconfig/registernds will refresh DHCP leases for all NICs on the machine, and 
will re-register the machine's hostname and IP address with the DNS server. The is a 
helpful switch to use when you've made changes to the local machine's IP address con- 
figuration and need to quickly re-register the new information with the DNS server. 
I winipcfg 
~ 
winipq'g (shown in Figure 11.4) is the graphical equivalent of the ipconfig command 
that s available in earlier versions of Windows. This will display the same information 
shown by ipconfig, and provides you a one-click shortcut to release and renew DHCP 
information.

nslookup 
The nslookup utility allows you to test and query the records stored in your DNS server. 
You can use nslookup in command mode to perform a single query, or in interactive mode 
to perform multiple queries. For example, if you enter the command nslookup 
defiant.taeteam.net, you'll see the following output (you can use another hostname in 
place of the one listed in this example to see nslookup in action): 
Server : constellation, tacteam.net 
Address: 
192.168.1.185 
Name : defiant, tacteam.net 
Address: 
192.168.1.2 
C:\> 
As you can see, you get returned to the command prompt once you receive the 
information- this is typical of using nslookup in command mode. To enter interactive 
mode, just type nslookup at the command prompt, and your output will look like this" 
C : \>nslookup 
Default Server: constellation.tacteam.net 
Address: 
192.168.1.185 
> 
Notice that you're not returned to the command prompt, but to the nslookup com- 
mand's interactive prompt. Once you enter interactive mode, you can use the set com- 
mands to control the information that's returned by your queries.The set commands 
available in nslookup are as follows" 
• 
set all Prints options, current server, and host. 
• 
set [no]debug Prints debugging information, set debug turns debugging 
on, set no debug turns debugging off. 
• 
set [no]d2 Prints the most exhaustive debugging information possible. 
• 
set domain=NAME 
Sets the default domain name for any queries. 
• 
set root=NAME Sets the root server being used. 
www.syngress.com 

Network Troubleshooting Tools • Chapter 11 
707 
• 
set srchlist=Nl[/N2/.../N6] 
Sets the DNS domains used to search for a 
particular host. 
• 
set retry=X 
Sets the number of retries. 
• 
set timeout=X 
Sets the initial timeout interval for DNS queries. 
• 
set [no]defname Appends the default domain name to each query. 
• 
set [no]recurse Performs a recursive query or a non-recursive (iterative) 
query. 
• 
set [no]search Uses the domain search list configured on the client. 
• 
set querytype=X 
Restricts the query type so that it only returns a particular 
type of records.You can restrict nslookup queries to look for CNAME 
records, MX records, NS and SIW records, and more. 
When you're ready to leave the interactive mode and return to the command 
prompt, just type exit. 
~ T DAY TIP 
p Be sure that you're familiar with the different query types that you can use with 
nslookup. In particular, be aware of how to search for mail server records using 
the MX option, and DNS servers using the NS option. 
route 
You can use the route command to manipulate and display the routing table for the local 
computer. The route print command produces the same results as the netstat-r com- 
mand- it produces a copy of the local computer's routing table, like the one shown 
here:

You can also use the route command to add, change, or delete routes that are 
defined on the local computer. To specify the route to a remote host using the route 
command, you need to configure the following information: 
1. 
Destination The destination that this route statement is designed to reach. 
This can be a single host, a network address, or the default route for this com- 
puter, indicated by the syntax 0.0.0.0. The default route dictates where net- 
work packets will be sent if the routing table doesn't have a more specific 
entry for them. 
2. 
Mask This indicates the subnet mask for the route's destination. If the destina- 
tion is a single IP address, the mask will be 255.255.255.255. For a network 
address, this will be the subnet mask of the destination network. The mask for 
the default route is 0.0.0.0. 
3. 
Gateway The IP address that packets will be forwarded to for this route.This 
has to be an IP address that's on the same subnet as the local computer. 
4. 
Metric This specifies the metric or cost of a particular route, from 1 to 9999. 
The higher the metric, the less likely the computer is to use a particular route. 
This is particularly useful if you're creating multiple routes to the same net- 
work as a fault tolerance measure; configure one route with a metric of 1 and 
another with a metric of 50. The local computer will use the first route unless 
it's not available, at which point it will revert to the second route. 
5. 
Interface This indicates the IP address of the NIC that should be used to 
reach the destination specified in this route. If you have two NICs installed 
that are attached to two different networks, you'll need to specify which NIC 
the route command should use to reach its destination.

Network Troubleshooting Tools • Chapter 11 
709 
~ M WARNING 
~ 
In most cases, you'll only add routes in this fashion on a server that's attached 
~ 
to multiple networks. Workstations will simply rely on their default gateway to 
d 
route network traffic. 
O 
To add a route to a remote network, issue the following command at the command 
line" 
route add 172.16.1.0 255.255.0.0 192.168.1.i01 1 
To change the metric of the route you just created, use the route change command: 
route change 172.16.1.0 255.255.0.0 192.168.1.i01 i0 
To delete a route that you've created, use route delete: 
route 
delete 
172.16.1.0 
255.255.0.0 
192.168.K.101 
10 
The route command has two additional switches that you should be aware of as 
you're preparing for the Network+ exam: 
• 
route -f will clear any routes to destination networks that are currently in the 
routing table. If you use the -f switch while creating or changing a route, the 
route command will clear the routing table and then add the new route you 
specify. 
• 
route -p will make the entry you're adding to the routing table persistent. By 
default, any routes that you add manually will only stay in the routing table 
until the computer reboots. Using the -p switch ensures that the route will 
remain in memory until you manually delete it. 
SNMP 
The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a protocol used to communi- 
cate status messages from computers and devices on your network. These messages are 
sent to machines configured to receive these status messages. Machines that send these 
messages run SNMP agent software, and the machines that receive the status messages run 
SNMP management software. One way to remember how this works is to think of the 
agent software as a "secret agent" that gets information about a network device, and then 
reports the information to his "manager" at headquarters. 
While the name of the SNMP protocol would lead you to believe that its primary 
function is to allow you to manage objects on your network, the management that's 
happening here has more to do with monitoring your network, rather than actually 
making any changes to the devices themselves. SNMP allows you to audit the activities

Chapter 11 • Network Troubleshooting Tools 
of servers, workstations, routers, bridges, intelligent hubs, and just about any network- 
connected device that supports SNMP agent software. For example, the agent software 
available with Windows 2000 implementation allows to you monitor the Windows 2000 
Server and Professional operating system, as well as Windows services like DHCR 
WINS, Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS), and others. All of these Windows 
2000 services can be monitored remotely by SNMP management software. 
In order for the SNMP agent software to collect information regarding a particular 
service, a Management Information Base (MIB) must be created. The MIB is a database 
that describes which kinds of information should be gathered from a particular device. 
The MIBs included with Windows 2000 allow the agent software to communicate a 
wide range of information. The agent software is responsible for reporting the informa- 
tion gathered by the MIB. However, agents rarely volunteer information spontaneously. 
Rather, the SNMP agent must be queried by an SNMP management system. There is, 
however, an exception to this: a trap message. A trap message is sent spontaneously by an 
SNMP agent to the SNMP management system when an important event occurs. For 
example, you could configure a trap message to indicate that the World Wide Web ser- 
vice has become unresponsive on a particular machine. We would then configure the 
agent to send a trap message to the IP address of a computer running the SNMP man- 
agement software so that an administrator can quickly respond to this event. SNMP trap 
messages are sent to UDP port 162. 
There are two other types of messages associated with SNMR A GET message is a 
request that is sent from an SNMP management system that requests information from 
an agent. A SET message will allow the SNMP management system to write changes to 
an MIB, and therefore extend its information-gathering abilities. SNMP GET and SET 
messages communicate on UDP port 161. 
SNMP is a fairly open protocol that doesn't have many security features. To control 
which machines receive SNMP trap messages, you will configure an SNMP community 
name. In addition, you'll configure a trap destination, which is the hostname or IP address 
of the computer running the SNMP management software. In order for a system to 
report to an SNMP management system, you first need to install the agent software on 
the target computer. In Exercise 11.2, we'll install and configure the SNMP agent soft- 
ware on a Windows XP machine.

Linux Tools 
While you may be spending a great deal of your "real world" troubleshooting time 
working on Windows computers, you should also be aware of the troubleshooting tools 
that are available for Linux- and UNIX-based computers. This is especially important 
since large organizations often employ these open-source operating systems as Web 
servers, firewalls, and other components of the network infrastructure. Many of the trou- 
bleshooting tools available for Linux and UNIX are similar or even identical to tools 
we've already covered for Windows: you can use the ping command from both a 
Windows and a UNIX computer, for example. In this section, we'll look at some tools 
that are specific to Linux- and UNIX-based operating systems. 
ifconfig 
You'll use the ifconfig command to configure the NICs installed in a Linux computer, as 
well as to view information about any configured interfaces. Like most Linux tools, 
you'll work with ifconfig from the command line. The most basic syntax and output for 
ifconfig is to simply type ipeonfig, which will produce the following output: 
eth0 
Link encap:gthernet 
HWaddr 00:80:C8:FS:4A:51

(28.8 Kb) 
Even if you haven't worked with Linux before, you should be able to recognize the 
two adapters that ifconfig is displaying information for: an Ethernet adapter called 
"ethO", and the Loopback Adapter.You can see the following information listed for the 
ethO interface: 
• 
HWaddr 00:80:C8:F8:4A:50 is the MAC address of the Ethernet adapter. 
• 
addr:192.168.99.35 
Bcast:192.168.99.255 
Mask:255.255.255.0indicates 
the IP address, broadcast address, and subnet mask. 
• 
Interrupt:9 Base address:0x5000 give you information about the hardware 
resources being used by the Ethernet adapter. 
• 
RX packets indicate the number of packets received by this adapter. TX 
packets show the number of packets transmitted. 
You can quickly disable the Ethernet NIC on this Linux computer by typing 
ifconfig eth0 down. If you re-issue the ifconfig command after you've brought the 
Ethernet adapter down, you'll only see configuration information for the loopback 
adapter: 
ifconfig 
io 
Link encap: Local Loopback 
inet addr:127.0.0.1

collisions:0 txqueuelen:0 
RX bytes:29504 
(28.8 Kb) 
TX bytes:29504 
(28.8 Kb) 
Bringing an adapter back online is slightly more complicated, since you need to 
have the IP address and subnet mask ready to configure the adapter with. To configure 
the Ethernet adapter with the same IP address it had before, you'll issue the following 
command (notice the up at the end of the statement, which brings the NIC online after 
assigning it an IP address): 
ifconfig eth0 192.168.99.35 netmask 255.255.255.0 up 
If you enter the ifconfig command again after configuring the Ethernet adapter, 
you'll once again see configuration information for eth0 in the output, as follows:

dig 
The dig, command is the Linux equivalent to nslookup in Windows - it's used to send 
name resolution queries to DNS servers to troubleshoot name resolution on a Linux- 
based client computer. The syntax of the dig command is as follows: 
dig [@server] 
[-b address] 
[-c class] [-f filename] [-k filename] [ -n ] [-p 
port#] 
[-t type] [-x addr] [-y name:key] 
[name] [type] [class] [queryopt...] 
dig [-h] 
dig [global-queryopt...] 
[query...] 
Unlike nslookup, there is no interactive mode for nslookup; you'll specify all of the 
necessary command line switches each time you issue the command. Each of these 
switches specifies certain behavior for the dig command, as follows: 

Network Troubleshooting Tools • Chapter 11 
715 
• 
@server This is the name of the computer you're querying for. Unlike 
nslookup, dig requires you to use the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) 
of the host you're looking for. Therefore, dig serverl.mycompany.com is 
correctly formatted, while dig server1 would return an error. 
• 
-b address If you have multiple NICs installed on your computer, this switch 
will specify the IP address that you want the query to be sent from. This is 
useful if you have NICs attached to different networks and you are trying to 
isolate which network is experiencing the name resolution failure. 
• 
-t type This specifies the type of record you're looking for, like an MX or 
S1KV record. 
• 
-f filemane This will allow dig to operate in batch mode, where it will per- 
form multiple queries that it reads in from a text file. 
• 
-p port This will issue a DNS query on a non-standard port. 
~ M WARNING 
~ 
Remember that the default DNS port is 53. DNS queries use UDP port 53, and 
'W ~ DNS zone transfers use TCP port 53. 
@ 
• 
+ [no] tcp Specifies whether to use TCP or UDP when performing a DNS 
query, dig www.mycompany.com +tcp will perform the query using 
TCP. dig www.mycompny.com +no tcp will issue the query using UDP. 
• 
+domain=domainname 
Searches for a host using only the domain name that 
you specify, rather than using the search list that the Linux computer is config- 
ured with. 
• 
+ [no] recursive Specifies whether to use an iterative or a recursive query. 
Dig queries are recursive by default, so issuing the dig 
www.mycompany.com +no recursive would instruct dig to use an itera- 
tive query. 
• 
+time=Time 
Specifies the time (in seconds) that dig should wait before 
deciding that a query has timed out. The default value is 5 seconds. 
traceroute 
As you can probably guess, traceroute is the Linux and UNIX equivalent to tracert on a 
Windows computer. By typing traceroute www.mycompany.com from the com- 
mand prompt of a Linux computer, you'll see output similar to the following:

NetWa re Tools 
When troubleshooting client connectivity to NetWare servers, especially Microsoft 
Windows clients using the NWLink protocol, the most common culprit tends to be the 
Ethernet flame type that's in use. When you install NWLink on a Windows PC, NWLink 
will be configured to use an Auto Detect feature to determine the correct flame type. In 
most cases, Auto Detect detects the correct flame type and network number. However, 
you can run into connectivity issues if your network is using multiple flame types or if a 
particular machine has the incorrect flame type set. By default, NWLink will set the 
Ethernet flame type to 802.2.You can verify that the flame type is set correctly as follows: 
1. 
Access the Local Area Connection dialog box on the Windows PC. Right- 
click the desired LAN connection and select Properties. 
2. 
Double-click NWR.ink IPX/SPX/NetBIOS 
Compatible Transport 
Protocol. 
. 
On the General tab, you can either verify that Auto Detect has been selected 
in the Frame type field, or else manually specify the flame type that should 
be used.

Other Network Troubleshooting Tools 
All of the troubleshooting tools we've discussed so far have been concerned with the 
networking software installed on a computer, especially the TCP/IP stack. However, there 
are a number of tools that you can use to test the physical connectivity on your net- 
work. Some of these are tools that you can build yourself, like an Ethernet crossover 
cable, and some are more sophisticated, like high-powered hardware testers such as an 
oscilloscope or a tone generator. In this section, we'll look at the different types of hard- 
ware testers that you should be familiar with. 
Crossover Cables 
A standard Ethernet cable will connect the NIC installed in a server or workstation to a 
wall jack or directly into a hub, switch, or router. For troubleshooting situations, though, 
you may need to connect two computers directly together In this case, you'll need to 
create a crossover cable, also called a null modem cable.You can also use crossover cables to 
identify which wall plate corresponds to a particular port on a switch or a hubmthis is 
useful if you've taken over administration of a network that doesn't have a good diagram 
of the physical network layout. The easiest way to create a crossover cable is to cut one 
end off of a standard Ethernet cable, and then re-arrange the wires on one end of the 
cable so that they are in the following order (starting at pin 1): 
1. 
White/green

Oscilloscope 
For in-depth troubleshooting of your network cabling, you can use an oscilloscope to 
monitor the electrical signal levels as they pass through the Ethernet cable. An oscillo- 
scope displays a small graph that shows how electrical signals change over time. This 
helps you determine the voltage and frequency of an electrical signal, and if any mal- 
functioning hardware components are distorting the signal.You can see an illustration of 
an oscilloscope in Figure 11.7.

Tone Generator 
If you need to troubleshoot telephone connections, especially when dealing with 
modem connections, you may find yourself in need of a tone generator. This is either a 
piece of software or a hardware device that generates the tones that are used in a tele- 
phone system, including a dial tone, busy signal, and ring tone.You can plug a tone gen- 
erator into a telephone jack to determine if the jack is functioning and able to make and 
receive calls.You can see a software-based tone generator in Figure 11.8.

You can use a cable tester to test for any faults or breaks in an Ethernet cable. Cable 
testers are designed to allow you to plug both ends of a cable into the tester. If the cable 
is in good condition, Light Emitting Diode (LED) lights on the tester will light up. If 
there is a break in the cable (or if the wires are in the wrong order) the LED lights on 
the tester will not light.You can see an illustration of a Fluke cable tester in Figure 11.9.

DAY TIP 
NICs, hubs, routers, and switches have their own LED lights that you can use for 
troubleshooting. A steady green light indicates a solid network connection. A 
blinking green light means that traffic is being passed over a particular connec- 
tion. An amber (orange-brown) light means that the device (NIC, router port, 
hub port, etcetera) is damaged, malfunctioning, or has encountered an error. 
Figure 1 1.9 The Fluke MicroScanner Pro 
Importance of Network Documentation 
After you've done all of the necessary troubleshooting to solve a problem, documenting 
your troubleshooting activities is vitally important. Putting down on paper the steps you 
go through, as you perform them, serves several purposes. 
First, it helps you to stay organized and perform those steps methodically. If you're 
writing it down, you're less likely to skip steps, because it's all there in front of you, in 
visual form.You don't have to wonder, "Did I test that cable segment?" or "Did I check 
the default gateway setting?" Documenting your actions also provides a valuable record 
if you end up having to call in an outside consultant or otherwise request someone else's 
assistance with the problem.You'll save time and money with an outside consultant if 
you can provide detailed information about what you tried, how you proceeded, and 
what the results were. 
Many network administrators lull themselves into a state of complacency about not 
documenting their behavior because they see the documentation process as too time- 
www.syngress.com 

Network Troubleshooting Tools • Chapter 11 
721 
consuming. However, if a mistake occurs because of a failure to document what you've 
done, or what you were planning to do, the amount of time lost far exceeds the time you 
would have spent actually writing things down in the first place. 
Finally, you should document the troubleshooting and problem resolution process 
for a very practical reason: History tends to repeat itself, and human memory is imper- 
fect. As you wipe the perspiration off your brow and breathe a silent sigh of relief at 
having finally tracked down and solved your connectivity problem, you may think that 
there is no way you will ever, ever forget what you did to fix it~not after going 
through all of that agony. But a year later, when the same thing occurs again, it's likely 
that you'll remember only, "This happened before and I fixed it ... somehow." The 
details tend to get lost unless you write them down. 
One last caveat on documentation: It's great to have a nice, neatly typed (and maybe 
even illustrated) troubleshooting log, but if you do your record-keeping on the com- 
puter instead of on paper, it's a good idea not only to back it up to tape, floppy, writable 
CD, or other media, but also to print out a hard copy. It should be a given, but some- 
times folks forget that when the computers go down, computerized documents may be 
inaccessible as well.

i 
ii { {i{ii need to determine what the problem actually is.To do this, you need to gather as much 
information as possible from your users, as well as gathering information from system 
{{i 
{iil{14N logs of any devices that are having trouble.You need, to figure out what the problem 
i!~i 
iiill actually is - users can't access the Internet, they can t communicate with another subnet, 
or maybe they're only having trouble with a particular application.You also need to 
determine how widespread the failure is--if a problem is only affecting a single com- 
puter, the cause will probably be quite different than if it is affecting an entire subnet or 
your whole network. 
To help you further isolate the cause of a problem that you're troubleshooting, you 
have a number of utilities available in the Windows and Linux operating systems. To test 
basic TCP/IP connectivity between two hosts, you can use the ping command - this is 
the equivalent of sending a message saying "Hey, can you hear me?" If you're unable to 
ping the destination host, you can ping any number of devices along the way to deter- 
mine where TCP/IP connectivity is falling--start by pinging a computer on the same 
subnet as the source host, then pinging the default gateway of the source host, and then 
pinging another host on the same segment as the destination host.You can also use the 
tracert command on a Windows computer or traceroute on Linux to view the actual 
path that network traffic takes between two hosts, tracert will ping each router that a 
network packet travels over to reach its destination to see how well it is responding.You 
................................... can see the IP address of each router that's between you and your destination, and 
whether any of these hops is unavailable or slow to respond. On Windows 2000 and XP,

F-¢I A solid understanding of the OSI model will help you troubleshoot 
connectivity issues that occur at all layers of the model, especially the Physical, 
Data Link, Network, and Transport Layers. 
V¢l Physical Layer difficulties are often associated with bad network cables, 
network interface cards, or hubs. 
V¢l The Network Layer usually creates the largest number of troubleshooting 
issues, since IP address configuration is assigned by an administrator and can 
change over time, unlike the MAC addresses of the Data Link Layer that

Frequently Asked Questions 
The following Frequently Asked Questions, answered by the authors of this book, 
are designed to both measure your understanding of the Exam Objectives 
presented in this chapter, and to assist you with real-life implementation of these 
concepts. You will also gain access to thousands of other FAQs at ITFAQnet.com. 
Q" I'm working on a Linux computer and have forgotten the syntax of the ifconfig 
command. Is there any way to quickly look it up without an Internet connection? 
A" Use the command man ifeonfig, man is short for manual page, and will produce a 
help file for many Linux and UNiX-based commands. Use man ifeonfig I more 
to force the man output to pause after every full screen. 
Q" What is the difference between a recursive DNS query and an iterative query? 
A" Iterative queries are ~ ..... i~~NS 
servers to look up records on behalf of clients.An 
iterative query is basic

~i~!iii{ii~!i!i{ill ! { 
Visio. Where is this option in Visio 2003? 

Network Troubleshooting Tools • Chapter 11 
725 
A: Unfortunately, Microsoft removed the automatic network discovery feature from 
Visio 2003.You'll need to purchase a third-party tool like Solar Winds or LAN 
MapShot. If you are still running Visio 2000 or 2003, you have access to a basic net- 
. . . . . .  
work discovery tool that win map out the IP addresses and hostnames of computers 
within a Win d ows do main.

Q: I'm having a hard time remembering the different switches that are available for all 
of these troubleshooting utilities. Is there an easy way to look these up when I need 
to use them? 
A: Yes.Almost all Windows and Linux command-line utilities have a Help switch, 
which you can access by using the -? or/? switch after typing in the name of the 
command.

Introduction 
Congratulations!You've made it almost all the way through the Network+ exam prepa- 
ration guide.You've learned all about the physical and logical components that make up 
a network, and how to install and configure the TCP/IP (Transmission Control 
Protocol/Internet Protocol) protocol suite.You've also learned about the different proto- 
cols that make up the TCP/IP suite as well as how they map to the OSI (Open Systems 
Interconnect) model. This includes the Internet Protocol, which is the workhorse of the 
TCP/IP suite that handles the "heavy lifting" of routing TCP/IP traffic from one host 
to another.You've also learned about TCP/IP's two session layer protocols: TCR and the 
User Datagram Protocol (UDP). TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that's used 
when each Session Layer packet has to be acknowledged by the computer it's being sent 
to. UDP is connectionless, which is useful for low-overhead connections where speed is 
at a premium. Both are Transparent Layer Protocol.You've also seen the Internet Control 
Message Protocol (ICMP), which is used for TCP/IP troubleshooting. In our last 
chapter, we talked extensively about the various utilities that are available to troubleshoot 
connectivity problems on a network. In our final chapter, we'll take the information 
from Chapter 11 and learn how to use it in a real-world situation to troubleshoot net- 
work connectivity issues. We'll revisit the OSI model and the TCP/IP-based DoD 
(Department of Defense) model. We'll also review the components of the suite of proto- 
cols that make up the TCP/IP stack and how common connectivity devices, such as 
repeaters, bridges, routers, and switches are used to expand or segment TCP/IP net- 
works. All of this is critical information to have at your fingertips when you're trou- 
bleshooting because, just as a physician is better able to treat a sick patient if he knows 
the person's background, characteristics, and how the patient normally behaves when he 
is not ill, you will be at a big advantage when you're confronted with "sick" or badly 
functioning networks if you understand your network's "anatomy" and components 
well.And the TCP/IP suite of protocols that most networks depend on to communicate 
is one of the most important "body parts." 
The objective of this chapter is to give you a detailed review of TCP/IP that will 
allow you to recognize symptoms of network troubles and to diagnose and correct any 
errors or misconfigurations that you find. We all know that a healthy network makes for 
a happy network administrator, and the information you find in this chapter will help 

Network Troubleshooting Methodology • Chapter 12 
735 
you in preparing both for the Network+ exam and for your journey into the real world 
of network administration and troubleshooting. To help you with this, we'll go through 
each layer of the OSI model and talk about the different troubleshooting steps you can 
take at each one. For example, the Physical Layer is concerned with physical connec- 
tivity between two computers, so here you'll look for broken cables or a malfunctioning 
NIC (network interface card) or hub. The Data Link layer is where switches, bridges, 
and Ethernet frame types operate, so you'll troubleshoot this layer by examining all of 
these entities. We'll start at the Physical Layer, which is the lowest layer of the OSI 
model, and work all the way up to the Application Layer. This chapter will help you put 
together all of the concepts you've learned throughout this study guide, to help you use 
them in troubleshooting real-world issues that you might encounter on a network. 
iM WARNING 
Be sure that you really understand what is really happening at each layer of the 
OSI model. It's important for the Network+ exam that you're able to recognize 
the different network protocols and devices that operate at each level, rather 
than just memorizing the "Please Do Not Throw Sausage Pizza Away" or "All 
People Seem To Need Data Processing" mnemonics 
How to Use the 
OSI Model in Troubleshooting 
As a network administrator, you should be familiar with the common networking 
models. In Chapter 5 we initially covered the OSI and DoD models. In this chapter we 
will learn how to map those layers to troubleshooting that may be performed at each 
level. For example, if you had a problem with a wireless access point (WAP), which layer 
would you start with? Why would you select that layer and what could be the issue? 
What if you had misconfigured your encryption settings for WEP (Wireless Encryption 
Protocol), and cannot connect to the wireless network? We'll look at examples like these 
to see how each layer of the OSI model fits into an overall troubleshooting strategy as 
you prepare for the Network+ exam. 
The Purpose of Networking Models 
In Chapter 5 we covered network models in depth. We also covered why they are 
important. One of the main reasons why using network models is so important is to 
give you the ability to isolate issues to specific layers of a protocol stack to help you 
troubleshoot a problem on a network.You'll often hear the OSI model referenced when 
you're troubleshooting a problem, such as, "We have a Layer 3 switch problem." Because

Chapter 12 • Network Troubleshooting Methodology 
understanding the OSI model is so critical to the network troubleshooting process, it's 
imperative that you master the OSI model's layering. 
A network protocol is a set of rules used by computers to communicate. Protocols 
had to be developed so that two computers attempting to transfer data back and forth 
would be able to understand one another. Some people will describe protocols as "lan- 
guages," but this isn't entirely accurate and can cause confusion, since computer lan- 
guages are an entirely different concept. A protocol is more like the syntax of the 
language, which refers to the order in which the words are put together, rather than the 
language itself. 
The first networking protocols were proprietary; that is, each networking vendor 
developed its own set of rules. Computers using an individual vendor's protocol would 
be able to communicate with each other, but not with computers that were using the 
networking product of a different vendor. This had the effect of locking a business into a 
particular product; the business would always have to use the same vendor's products in 
order to maintain compatibility. 
The solution to this problem was the development of protocols based on open stan- 
dards. Organizations such as the ISO (International Organization for Standardization) 
were charged with overseeing the definition and control of these standards and pub- 
lishing them so they would be available to any vendor that wanted to create products 
that adhered to them. The advantage to the consumer is that no longer is he forced to 
patronize a single vendor. The advantage to the vendor is that its products are more 
widely compatible, and therefore can be used in networks that started out using a dif- 
ferent vendor's products. 
A model provides an easy-to-understand description of the networking architecture 
and serves as the framework for the standards. The OSI model has become a common 
reference point for discussion of network protocols and connection devices. 
As we look at the OSI and DoD models, you'll see that they both use layers to rep- 
resent areas of functionality. In OSI terms, each of the layered specifications uses the ser- 
vices of the layer below it to build an enriched service. The layered approach provides a 
logical division of responsibility, where each layer handles only the functions that are 
specific to that layer.You can think of this like the teamwork exhibited by a good 
assembly-line crew that's building an automobile. One worker may be responsible for 
fitting a wheel onto the axis, another for inserting and tightening the screws, and so 
forth. There are several advantages to this type of working model: 
• 
Each worker only has to be concerned with his or her own area of responsi- 
bility. 
• 
Each worker becomes extremely proficient at his or her particular job through 
constant repetition. 

Network Troubleshooting Methodology • Chapter 12 
737 
• 
Working together in sequence, the team of workers is able to produce the final 
product much more quickly and efficiently than one person or than a group of 
people with no assigned responsibilities could. 
• 
If something goes wrong (for instance, if a particular part was put on incor- 
rectly), the supervisor knows who to blame for the problem. 
Likewise, when the networking protocols are divided into layers, communication 
generally flows more smoothly, and when it doesn't, troubleshooting is easier because 
you are better able to narrow down the source of the problem to a specific layer. We'll 
be using the ISO's OSI model to help us in troubleshooting network connectivity issues. 
Reviewing the OSI Model 
You should remember that the OSI model consists of seven layers. When one computer 
communicates with another one, data at the sending computer is passed from one layer 
to the next until the Physical Layer finally puts it out onto the network cable. At the 
receiving end, it travels back up in reverse order. Although the data travels down the 
layers on one side and up the layers on the other, the logical communication link is 
between each layer and its matching counterpart, as shown in Figure 12.1.

Chapter 
12 • Network Troubleshooting Methodology 
Here's how it works: as the data goes down through the layers, it is encapsulated or 
enclosed within a larger unit as each layer adds its own header information. When it 
reaches the receiving computer, the process occurs in reverse; the information is passed 
upward through each layer, and as it does so, the encapsulation information is evaluated 
and then stripped off one layer at a time. The information added by the Network Layer, 
for example, will be read and processed by the Network Layer on the receiving side. 
After processing, each layer removes the header information that was added by its corre- 
sponding layer on the sending side. It is finally presented to the Application Layer, and 
then to the user's application at the receiving computer. At this point, the data is in the 
form it was in when sent by the user application at the source machine. Figure 12.2 
illustrates how the header information is added to the data as it progresses down through 
the layers.

Establishing a Troubleshooting Strategy 
This chapter will provide a number of examples of how to troubleshoot network issues. 
The most important thing that you can do when troubleshooting is to be organized and 
methodical in your approach to solving problems. If you work in a rushed fashion, 
you're likely to miss a crucial troubleshooting step or forget what you did to solve the 
problem the next time it occurs. 
In general, you can break down the steps necessary to troubleshoot a network issue 
into the following seven steps: 
0 
Identify the symptoms and potential causes The first step is deter- 
mining exactly what's wrong, and if there's actually a problem at all. For 

Network Troubleshooting Methodology • Chapter 12 
739 
example, if you upgrade the speed of your company's Internet connection so 
that a file transfer that used to take 30 seconds now takes no time at all, a user 
might think that the file transfer didn't work. In this case there really wasn't an 
error, but the user thought that there was a problem because something she was 
used to had suddenly changed. So your first step should be in determining the 
exact symptoms of the problem. Is a user unable to access the Internet entirely, 
or is it only that she is unable to receive her e-mail while Web browsing is 
working fine? Having this information at hand will help you determine the 
potential causes of an issue. 
2. 
Identify the affected area Is only one user having trouble accessing the 
Internet, or is there an issue that's affecting an entire subnet or your entire net- 
work? If all users on a particular subnet are experiencing connectivity troubles, 
you might suspect the default gateway or the network connection between 
that subnet and the rest of your network. If the issue is restricted to a single 
user, you'll be more likely to examine the specific user's workstation to check 
for hardware failures or software misconfigurations. 
3. Establish what has changed Once you've determined what the problem is, 
you should try to find out if anything has changed on the local computer, or 
on the router or switch if the problem is affecting multiple computers. I can't 
tell you the number of times I've scratched my head thing to solve a connec- 
tivity problem only to find out that my router administrators were "messing 
with the routers this morning" and changed a critical setting that created the 
outage that I was experiencing. Knowing what has changed on a network will 
usually give you a good starting point from which you can begin the trou- 
bleshooting process. 
4. 
Select the most probable cause Based on the information you gathered in 
the first three steps, and using the troubleshooting tools we covered in Chapter 
11, try to determine the most likely reason why you are experiencing a con- 
nectivity failure. Keep in mind that your first guess might be incorrect and that 
there may be more than one cause at work, so don't get discouraged if you 
need to eliminate your first, second, and even third guesses. 
5. Implement an action plan and solution, including potential effects 
The first part of this seems straightforward enough- "Fix the problem!" But 
many administrators will overlook the second half of the statement, which is 
just as important: you don't want to do something to fix one problem that will 
only end up causing another (potentially worse) problem. So think carefully 
about the potential effects of any troubleshooting steps that you are going to 
take, especially if it involves steps that you're taking on a server, router, or other 
device that many users rely on. For example, you may decide that you need to 
stop and restart the WWW publishing service on your Microsoft Web server 

740 
Chapter 12 • Network Troubleshooting Methodology 
to solve an issue being experienced by one particular user, but you need to 
plan this carefully since it will affect every user that's connected to the Web 
server.You should be even more careful in changing any configuration items 
on a server or router so that the change you're making doesn't create more 
issues than it corrects. 
6. 
Test the result In addition to determining if your solution actually fixed the 
problem you were experiencing, you should also look at the overall connec- 
tivity on your network to make sure that you didn't inadvertently create 
another issue by implementing the fix you chose in Step 5. 
7. 
Identify the results and document the solution and process Even 
though you probably think that you'll never forget how to fix this problem, 
especially if it's one that you had to work at solving for hours and hours, the 
simple fact of the matter is that if you don't write down your solution, odds 
are quite good that you won't remember if the issue recurs many months 
down the line or won't be able to reproduce it precisely.You should document 
the information that you gathered in each of these steps: how the problem 
manifested itself, the systems that were affected, the solution and how you 
implemented it, and any side effects that came about as a result of imple- 
menting the fix. Taking a few minutes to do this now can save you hours 
down the line when you find that you need to retrace your steps. 
Troubleshooting the Physical Layer 
In many ways, the Physical Layer is the easiest to troubleshoot because it deals with 
devices and concepts that are concrete and tangible--you can actually see the network 
cabling and NICs that exist at the Physical Layer, whereas nobody has ever been able to 
tell me what an IP address looks like. The Physical Layer deals with such things as the 
type of signal transmission used, the cable type, and the actual layout or path of the net- 
work wiring. These are things we can see, touch, or at least easily represent with a 
drawing or diagram. Because of this, the functions of the Physical Layer devices (NICs, 
cables, connectors, hubs, and repeaters) are also relatively easy to understand. 
Physical Layer devices are mostly items that you'll find in any networking equip- 
ment catalog. The basics are deceptively simple: you insert a network card into an 
expansion slot on each computer, plug a piece of cable into each network card, and plug 
the other end of each cable into a hub. But leafing through any type of an equipment 
catalog will reveal that Physical Layer issues are a little more complex. Some cable man- 
ufacturers offer literally thousands of different cables, and the variety of available net- 
work cards and connectivity devices is just as overwhelming. Getting a network up and 
running at the Physical Layer requires a good bit of knowledge about what works with 
what and which hardware type is best for your particular situation. 

Network Troubleshooting Methodology • Chapter 12 
741 
The NIC is the hardware device most essential to establishing communication 
between computers.Although there are ways to connect computers without a NIC 
(using a modem over the phone lines or via a serial null modem cable, for instance), in 
most cases where there is a network, there is a NIC (or more accurately, at least one 
NIC for each participating computer). The bottom line when selecting a NIC for any 
device is this: the NIC must match the bus type for which you have an open slot in the 
computer, it must be of the correct media access type, it must have the correct con- 
nector for the cable your network uses, and it must be rated to transfer data at the 
proper speed. Ethernet normally transmits at 10, 100, or 1000 Mbps, and Token Ring 
runs at 4 or 16 Mbps. 
The network media is the cable or wireless technology on which the signal is sent. 
Cable types include thin and thick coaxial cable (similar to cable TV cable), twisted-pair 
(such as used for modern telephone lines, available in both shielded and unshielded 
types), or fiber optic (which sends pulses of light through thin strands of 
glass or plastic for fast, reliable communication, but is expensive and difficult to work 
with). Wireless media include radio waves, laser, infrared, and microwave. 
Hubs and repeaters are devices that operate at the Physical Layer. Repeaters connect 
two network segments (usually thin or thick coax) and boost the signal so the distance 
of the cabling can be extended past the 
normal limits at which attenuation, or weakening, interferes with the reliable transmis- 
sion of the data. Hubs are generally used with Ethernet twisted-pair cable, and most 
modern hubs are repeaters with multiple ports. Hubs also strengthen the signal before 
passing it back out to the computers attached to it. Hubs can be categorized as follows: 
• 
Active hubs are the ones just described. They serve as both a connection point 
and a signal booster. Data that comes in is passed back out on all ports. 
• 
Passive hubs serve as connection points only; they do not boost the signal 
before passing it on. Passive hubs do not require electricity and thus won't have 
a power cord as active hubs do. 
• 
Intelligent or "smart" hubs include a microprocessor chip with diagnostic capa- 
bilities, so you can monitor the transmission on individual ports. 
The NIC is another device that functions at the Physical Layer, and is responsible 
for preparing the data to be sent out over the network media. Exactly how that prepara- 
tion is done depends on which media is being used; a Token King NIC is different from 
an Ethernet NIC, for example. It logically would have to be, since they use different 
access methods. And even though 10Base2, 10Base5, and 10BaseT Ethernet networks all 
use CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Detection) as their access 
method, they use different cable and connector types; however, it is possible to get a 
"combo" card that has connectors for all three. 
Another consideration at the Physical Layer is whether the signaling method will 
use the entire bandwidth of the cable to transmit the data, or only use one frequency. 

742 
Chapter 12 • Network Troubleshooting Methodology 
When all frequencies are used, the transmission method is called baseband. If only part of 
the bandwidth is used (thus allowing other signals to share the bandwidth), it is referred 
to as broadband. Traditionally, baseband transmission has been associated with digital 
signaling and broadband with analog, but this does not always hold true. For instance, 
Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) is a high-speed technology offered by many telephone 
companies for Internet connectivity. DSL is a 
broadband technology because it uses only a part of the wire to transmit data. Voice 
communication can take place simultaneously on the same cable, using a different fre- 
quency than is being used by the data communications. Cable television is another 
example of broadband transmission, bringing dozens of different channels into your 
home on just one coaxial cable. 
Another important Physical Layer issue is the layout, or topology, of the network. 
This refers to whether the cables are arranged in a line going directly from computer to 
computer (bus), in a circle going from computer 
to computer with the last connecting back to the first (ring), or in a spoke-like fashion 
with each connecting directly to a central hub (star). A fourth topology, the mesh, is 
used when every computer is connected to 
every other computer, creating redundant data pathways and high fault tolerance, at the 
cost of increasing complexity as the network grows. Wireless communications can use 
the cellular topology that is widely 
used for wireless telephone networks. In this case, an area is divided into slightly overlap- 
ping cells, representing connection points. 
The physical layout of the network will influence other factors, such as which media 
access method (and thus which cable type) is used. All of the Physical Layer factors 
(cable type, access method, topology, etcetera), when considered together, define the 
architecture of the network. Popular network architectures include Ethernet, ARCnet, 
Token Ring, and AppleTalk. 
Layer 1 Troubleshooting 
When troubleshooting the Physical Layer, you'll be most concerned with NICs, network 
cables, and hubs. We'll start by looking at potential issues with NICs, and ways to trou- 
bleshoot and correct them. Configuring the NIC at the Physical Layer is the first step in 
creating a TCP/IP connection.Although an improperly configured card is not a pro- 
tocol-specific issue, it may be mistaken for one, and you can lose a great deal of time 
trying to troubleshoot TCP/IP when the problem actually lies with the NIC itself. Thus, 
it's important for you to know how to determine when a TCP/IP connection is failing 
due to a lower-level problem such as one with the NIC or with physical cabling. 
One easy way to determine that the problem lies at the Physical Layer, and not with 
a specific protocol, is to attempt to establish a connection using a different protocol. If 
your computer is unable to communicate with others on the network using TCP/IE but 
can make the connection when NetBEUI or NWLink is installed on the machines, you 
www.syngress.com 

Network Troubleshooting Methodology • Chapter 12 
can surmise that the problem lies in the way that TCP/IP is configured, and you can 
start troubleshooting the protocol configuration accordingly. If you still have no luck in 
making a connection with other network transport protocols, it is likely that you have a 
problem with the hardware or the hardware drivers. This simple test can save you much 
time and effort when you begin the troubleshooting process. 
In addition, when you are troubleshooting physical devices like cables or NICs, it's 
also helpful to have spare equipment to swap out so that you can quickly determine the 
cause of the problem. If you suspect that the network cable is at fault, switch it with one 
that you know works; if connectivity is restored, then you know that the cable was the 
culprit. If switching the cable doesn't help, try using a different wall jack or another port 
on the switch or hub. If switching to a different port solves the problem, then you have 
isolated the point of failure. 
The Role of the NIC 
The NIC (also sometimes called the network adapter, or just the network card) plays an 
essential role in TCP/IP and other network communications. The NIC is the device 
that physically joins the computer and the cable or other network media, but its func- 
tion is more complex than that. Network cards also have memory chips, called buffers, in 
which information is stored so that if the data comes in or goes out too quickly, it can 
"rest" there while the bottleneck clears until there is room for it to pass onto the cable 
or up into the computer's components. 
It is essential that you ensure that the NIC installed in the computer is the proper 
type for both the media and architecture used by your network. For instance, Ethernet 
and Token Ring require different types of NICs. This is because of the different ways in 
which the media access methods function. And, of course, the card must have the proper 
connector for the cable type being used. These are basic, relatively straightforward issues, 
but don't overlook them when troubleshooting connectivity problems. 
If you are installing a NIC on a Windows-based computer, be sure to check the 
Windows Hardware Compatibility List (HCL) or Windows Catalog to ensure that your 
card is supported. The list can be accessed from the Microsoft website at 
www.microsoft.com/hcl. Although devices not listed may still work with Windows, if 
your card is on the list you can be confident that it has been tested and is compatible 
with the operating system. 
Driver Issues 
Like other hardware devices, the NIC requires a software driver to provide the interface 
between the operating system and the card. Be sure the driver that is designated for your 
specific model of NIC is installed and that it is the most recent version. In many cases, 
simply installing an updated NIC driver can solve countless connection problems. 
Recent Windows operating systems like 2000, XP, and 2003, support a large number 
of common brands and models of" NICs, and the drivers are included on the Windows 
743 

744

installation CDs. However, these may not be the latest versions. Always check the manu- 
facturer's website for a download area where you can obtain the latest drivers. Since 
Windows 2000, XP, and 2003, unlike NT 4.0, are plug-and-play operating systems, sup- 
ported cards are more likely to be automatically detected and the drivers installed from 
the Windows installation files (or you will be prompted to supply the disk or network 
location). Be cautioned again, however, that the drivers installed by the operating system 
may be outdated. In Exercise 12.1, we'll walk through the steps of updating a driver for 
a NIC installed on a Windows 2000 PC.

Problems with Cables and Other Network Media 
Another type of problem that can mimic TCP/IP protocol configuration problems is 
damaged, defective, or improperly installed cables or other network media. Broken or 
shorted cables can be detected with a cable tester. Some of the more sophisticated (and 
more expensive) LAN (local area network) testers will even pinpoint the exact location 
of the break. 
As a network administrator, you may have other personnel who handle hardware 
and cabling. It is important, however, that you are able to recognize the symptoms of 
Physical Layer problems so that you will know when to call in the technicians, rather 
than spend your time attempting to "fix what isn't broken." Damage to the media is not 
the only factor when considering Physical Layer problems. All network architectures, for 
example, Ethernet, Token Ring, and AppleTalk, include specifications that must be met 
concerning networking equipment and media. If those rules are ignored, connectivity 
may be lost completely or you may experience intermittent problems. 
Some instances in which ignoring these specifications can result in difficulties in 
establishing or maintaining a connection include cable type and grade, and the limita- 
www.syngress.com 

746 
Chapter 12 • Network Troubleshooting Methodology 
tions on the allowable segment length for various network/cable types. Be sure that the 
cabling for your network meets specifications for the particular architecture. For 
instance, a 10Base2 network requires not just thin coaxial cable, but a particular type of 
thin coax: 1KG-58 A/U (the cable grade is usually indicated on the side of the cable 
itself). Don't try to substitute something else that is close or looks similar; you will be 
setting yourself up for connectivity problems if you do. 
You may even run into a situation where a cable technician (or perhaps an adminis- 
trator with little hardware experience)attempts to replace a broken or bad length of thin 
coax cable with 1KG-58 U or even 1KG-59 (the cable used for cable TV). Therefore, in 
checking the Physical Layer for the source of a connectivity problem, be certain not 
only that the cable is connected and appears to be undamaged, but that the cable type 
meets the necessary specifications.Another example of improper cable type would be 
substituting Category 3 twisted-pair for Cat 5 on a 100 Mbps (100BaseT) or Gigabit 
Ethernet network. Cable type is generally indicated on the cable itself. 
Cable Length Issues 
You are aware that because of the susceptibility of copper cabling to attenuation, or signal 
loss over distance, network specifications place limits on the acceptable length of a seg- 
ment of cable, depending on the architecture and cable type. Violating the length speci- 
fications may be tempting, especially if you only need to go "a tiny bit further" in order 
to get the cable to a specific office or other location.You might get away with itmthe 
cable does not just automatically stop working when you exceed the specified distance. 
But going beyond these limitations can cause you to have connectivity problems that 
you might easily mistake for software- or protocol-related problems when the real 
trouble is at the Physical Layer. 
Troubleshooting Physical Layer Devices 
Usually the type of device we associate with an internetwork is the router, which works 
at the Network Layer in the OSI model. But we also should remember that there are 
other, lower-level devices that can be used for such purposes as: 
• 
Extending the distance limitations of network cable. 
• 
Connecting network segments that use different media types, for instance, thin 
coax and UTP (unshielded twisted-pair). 
• 
Segmenting the network to reduce traffic without dividing the network into 
separate IP subnets. 
Because repeaters and hubs operate at the Physical Layer, problems affecting these 
devices will be physical problems, or hardware problems. This layer is not concerned 
with high-level protocols like TCP and IP, and problems with these devices will interfere 
with communications regardless of the network transport protocols being used.

747 
However, Physical Layer device problems can mimic TCP/IP protocol configuration 
problems. Because of this, you should always consider the Physical Layer when trou- 
bleshooting connectivity problems. If the hardware itself doesn't work, all the software 
reconfiguration in the world won't solve the problem.

~ ~  
If you are unable to establish a connection between computers, you need to first verify 
that TCP/IP is properly installed (by pinging the loopback address as discussed in 
Chapter 11), check the configuration and operability of the NIC as we discussed earlier 
in this section, and confirm that there are no shorts, breaks, or other problems with the 
cable. If you still are unable to connect, look at your connectivity devices such as 
repeaters and hubs: 
• 
Ensure that the device has power. 
• 
Ensure that the computers' NICs are communicating with the device (by 
checking status lights). 
• 
Ensure that devices are installed in accordance with the IEEE (Institute of 
Electrical and Electronic Engineers) specifications for the particular network 
architecture. 
• 
Ensure that all ports on the device are functional by checking for a green LED 
(light emitting diode) lights when you attach a computer to the port via a net- 
work cable. 
The last includes compliance with any distance limitations for the media being used 
and, for coax networks, the restrictions imposed by the 5-4-3 rule. This rule states that on 
a 10Base2 or 10Base5 network (using coax cable and a bus configuration), you should 
have no more than five segments, connected by no more than four repeaters, and that 
only three of those segments should be populated. A populated node is one that has 
nodes (computers or other network devices) attached to it. In this context, a network 
segment is the length of the cable between repeaters. 
Troubleshooting the hubs that connect a 10BaseT network will depend in part on 
the type of hub being used. Passive hubs are simply connection points and give you few 
clues as to whether they are operating correctly. Fortunately, because it is a simple, non- 
powered device, not much can go wrong with a passive hub. The pins and wiring inside 
the hub or a damaged female RJ-45 jack could create connection problems. This can be 
prevented by ensuring that the hubs are handled properly, since most such damage is 
caused by human mistreatment. An active hub (sometimes called a multiport repeater) 
does give you a few clues to help you in troubleshooting connectivity problems. The 
pretty flashing lights that indicate network communication (or collisions) on each port 
are a starting point. By observing the status lights, you can ascertain if one port is "dead" 

748 
Chapter 12 • Network Troubleshooting Methodology 
or unlit, indicating either a problem with the jack or cable at that port or a problem 
originating with the computer attached to it. 
The intelligent or smart hub (also called a managed hub) is a bit more helpful. This 
type of hub runs software with which you can communicate with the hub from a ter- 
minal or across the network. In this case, the software program will provide information 
about port status, and in some cases will run diagnostic applications to assist you in trou- 
bleshooting connectivity problems.

Troubleshooting the Data Link Layer 
The Data Link Layer takes the datagram passed down to it from the Network Layer and 
repackages it into a unit called a flame. This frame includes error checking information, 
which is processed by the Data Link Layer on the receiving computer when the frame 
reaches its destination. The Data Link Layer is responsible for error-free delivery of the 
data frames. It's also responsible for maintaining the reliability of the physical link 
between two computers, which is handled by the Physical Layer just below it. The Data 
Link Layer is the only layer of the OSI model that is divided into sub-layers: the Logical 
Link Control (LLC) and the Media Access Control (MAC) sublayers. We will look at 
each of these individually. 
The LLC sublayer is charged with ensuring the reliability of the link or the connec- 
tion. IEEE 802.2 is an LLC standard that operates using both CSMA/CD and Token 
Ring media access standards. Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) also operates at the LLC 
level. The MAC sublayer deals with the logical topology of the network, which may or 
may not be the same as the physical topology or layout. For instance, IBM Token Ring 
networks use a physical star topology where all computers connect to a central hub 
(called an MSAU, or Multistation Access Unit). However, the logical topology is a ring, 
because inside the MSAU, the wiring is set up such that the data travels in a circle. A 
10BaseT network connecting to an Ethernet hub, on the other hand, uses a physical star 
configuration, but is logically a bus (which is why it is sometimes called a star bus). 
The IEEE has developed a number of standards to govern the transmissions that take 
place at the Data Link and Physical Layers. When preparing for the Network+ exam, 
you should be aware of the following standards:

• 
802.2 establishes standards for the implementation of the LLC sublayer of the 
Data Link Layer. 
• 
802.3 sets specifications for an Ethernet network using CSMA/CD, a linear or 
star bus topology, and baseband transmission. 
• 
802.5 sets standards for a token passing network using a physical star/logical 
ring topology such as Token Ring. 
• 
802.7 establishes criteria for networks using broadband transmission. 
• 
802.8 sets specifications for using fiber optic as a network medium. 
• 
802.11 establishes standards for wireless networking. 
Understanding Data 
Link Access Control Methods 
MAC-level protocols govern the access control method, or how the data accesses the 
transmission media. The popular methods are grouped in three categories: 
• 
Contention methods 
• 
Token passing 
• 
Polling methods 
Contention methods include CSMA/CD, used in Ethernet networks, and Carrier 
Sense Multiple Access Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA), used in AppleTalk networks 
(used in wireless networks). In both cases, computers that want to transmit data on the 
network must compete for the use of the wire or other media. A collision occurs if two 
stations attempt to send at the same time. CSMA/CD and CSMA/CA differ how they 
address this collision problem. With CSMA/CD, data collisions are detected and the data 
is sent again after a random amount of time. With CSMA/CA, an "intent to transmit" 
message is put out as a "feeler" before the computer transmits the actual data. 
~~T_ DAY TIP 
~ 
I learned to remember the difference between Collision Detection and Collision 
, 
Avoidance in this way: with CSMA/CD, you want to cross a busy street. So you 
"~ 
start to walk across the street, and if you get hit by a car you wait for a little 
while and then try again. With CSMA/CA, you want to cross that same busy 
street, so you send a remote controlled car across the street before you start 
walking. If the little toy car makes it across safely, you decide that it's safe to 
cross yourself. If the toy car gets hit, you wait a little while and then try to send 
the toy across again. 

750 
Chapter 12 • Network Troubleshooting Methodology 
Token passing methods eliminate the possibility of collision by using a circulating 
signal called a token to determine which computer is allowed to transmit information 
across the wire, where only one computer (the computer that has the token) is allowed 
to transmit at any given time. So a computer on a token passing network is more polite 
than one on a network using contention methods. Rather than blurting out its transmis- 
sion whenever it has something to say, it waits patiently for its turn (when the token gets 
around to it) and sends data only when it "has the floor." 
Polling methods are similar in some ways to token passing, except that instead of the 
group of computers policing themselves by passing around a token, there is a central 
unit that acts as a "chairperson." This "presiding" unit asks members of the "committee" 
in turn whether they have something to say. Since all computers follow these "rules of 
parliamentary procedure" data transmission proceeds in an orderly fashion. 
Understanding MAC Addressing 
Although the permanent address burned into the NIC is sometimes called the physical 
address, its proper name is the Media Access Control address. The MAC sublayer of the 
Data Link Layer also handles MAC addressing functions. MAC addresses on Ethernet 
cards are expressed as 12-digit hexadecimal numbers, which represent 4-bit (6-byte) 
binary numbers. The first three bytes contain a manufacturer code, which is assigned by the 
IEEE. The last three bytes are assigned by the manufacturer and represent that particular 
card. Each computer must have a MAC address that is unique on the network. 
Higher-level protocols will translate IP addresses (also called logical addresses) into 
MAC addresses, which represent the physical network location of a particular device. 
These lower-level protocols cannot recognize or use IP addresses. Think of it this way: a 
city or county may assign a street name and house number to a structure, but this is 
really only a "logical" address. Logical addresses can be more easily changed. A neighbor- 
hood group will petition to have a street renamed, or the city council will change the 
numbering scheme to facilitate emergency response or to accommodate new construc- 
tion. The location where the building stands also has a "physical" address: its geographic 
coordinates. When the land is surveyed, it will be identified by degrees of longitude and 
latitude, and these will remain constant regardless of changes to the street name and 
number. That physical address is like the NIC's MAC address; it will (almost always) 
remain the same.

Recognizing Data Link Layer Devices 
The two types of devices that operate at the Data Link Layer of the OSI model are switches 
and bridges. Bridges can separate a network into segments, but they don't subnet the net- 
work as routers do. In other words, if you use a bridge to physically separate two areas of 
the network, it will still appear to be all one network to higher-level protocols. Bridges can 
cut down on network congestion because they can do some basic filtering of data tratiqc 
based on the MAC address of the destination computer. When a transmission reaches the 
bridge, the bridge will not pass it across to the other side of the network if the MAC 
address of the destination computer is known to be on the same side of the network as the 
sending computer. The bridge builds tables indicating which addresses are on which side, 
and uses them to determine whether to let the transmission across. 
Sometimes even experienced network administrators become confused about net- 
work bridges. This confusion comes in because there are different types of bridges. 
Although all of them operate at the Data Link Layer, some operate at the lower MAC 
sublayer and others at the higher LLC sublayer. There are some important differences. 
One practical question is whether you can use a bridge to connect network segments 
that use different media access methods (for instance, an Ethernet segment and a Token 
Ring segment). The answer is, unfortunately, "It depends." Specifically, this depends on 
which type of bridge you're referring to. A bridge that operates at the Logical Link 
Control sublayer, sometimes called a translation bridge, can connect segments using 
www.syngress.com 

752 
Chapter 12 • Network Troubleshooting Methodology 
different access methods. However, a lower-level bridge (one that operates at the MAC 
sublayer) cannot perform this type of translation. But both types of bridges can connect 
segments that use different physical media, like a segment cabled with thin coax and a 
segment running on unshielded twisted-pair. 
Another device that operates at the Data Link Layer is the switch, or switching hub, 
which has become very popular on Ethernet networks. Like the hubs that operate at the 
Physical Layer, these switches are multi-port devices that you can plug numerous devices 
into. Like bridges, a switch will maintain a table of MAC addresses, showing which 
computer is connected to which port. When data comes into the switch, instead of just 
sending it back out to all the computers as a hub does, the switch examines the destina- 
tion address in the header, consults the table, and sends it only out the port to which the 
corresponding computer is attached. This cuts down overall network traffic considerably, 
and helps to prevent collisions. Some types of switches are even more sophisticated than 
this and can perform basic routing functions like dividing networks into virtual LANs 
(VLANs), in addition to the type of switching described here. 
As you saw in the previous section, this is also the layer where wireless access points 
reside, and so it is the layer at which you'll start troubleshooting wireless connectivity 
issues. This includes verifying the Service Set Identifier (SSID), which is the network 
name for a given wireless access point, and ensuring that your wireless hardware all sup- 
ports the same 802.11 specification: 802.11a, 802.11b and/or 802.11g. 
Layer 2 Troubleshooting 
Bridges and switches are useful devices for segmenting a network and controlling the 
amount of traffic. However, they introduce an extra layer of complexity and thus the 
potential for several different types of problems. The primary reason for using a bridge 
or a switch to divide your network is to increase network performance. However, it is 
possible that bridging or switching itself can have the opposite effect if it is not imple- 
mented correctly.You will find that bridging or switching a network, while cutting 
down on overall traffic, will also slightly increase latency for those communications that 
must cross the bridge or switch. This term refers to delays in transmission of the data in 
route to the destination computer. 
The reason for this is the way in which the bridge or switch decides whether to 
forward traffic across the network; it must first analyze the header information in the 
data frame to find out the destination computer's MAC address, and then it must look 
up that address in its routing table. This takes some time, although in most cases the per- 
formance hit will not be significant and will be offset by the overall reduction in net- 
work traffic. By following a few simple guidelines, you can prevent any noticeable 
performance degradation from being created. 
One popular networking guideline pertaining to the use of bridges and switches is 
the 80/20 rule. This states that 80 percent of network traffic should be local (occurring 
on the same side of the bridge or switch), and no more than 20 percent should cross the 

Network Troubleshooting Methodology • Chapter 12 
753 
bridge or switch. For best performance, ensure that those computers that communicate 
with one another most often are on the same side of the bridge or switch. Frequently 
accessed file or print servers should be placed on the same side of the bridge or switch 
as those clients that use them most often. Before implementing a bridging or switching 
solution, you should carefully analyze the normal flow of network traffic and try to 
group nodes so that most communication, and especially transfer of large amounts of 
data, takes place without the need to cross the bridge. 
Identifying the Cause 
of an Infrastructure Problem 
Another issue that sometimes occurs with bridges and switches is looping. This can occur 
when there is more than one active bridge or switch on a network. In a loop, when the 
bridges and switches don't know the location of a destination computer, they send the data 
frame across the bridge or switch. This results in multiple copies of the same data frame on 
the network, causing unnecessary congestion~but it gets even worse than that. 
As each device detects the frame sent by the other bridge or switch, it passes the 
frame back across to the other side. The frames coming from the other bridge cause each 
bridge or switch to make incorrect entries in its switching table for the destination com- 
puter, and this in turn intermittently prevents the destination computer from receiving 
data. (A switch maintains a switching table in much the same way that a router maintains a 
routing table.) The problem is intermittent because the bridges keep resetting the entries 
in the switching table, based on where the data frames are coming from. This can go on 
forever in an endless loop, hence the term looping. See Figure 12.5 for an example of 
how this can happen.

Chapter 12 • Network Troubleshooting Methodology 
In the scenario shown in Figure 12.5, if Computer B sends a message to Computer 
A, both bridges would detect the data frame. Neither bridge knows where Computer A 
is located, so both bridges would transmit the flame to the other segment. They would 
put an entry in the switching tables identifying Computer B as being off the left-side 
port. Two copies of the data frame have now been transmitted onto the right-side bridge 
port. Now each bridge will also detect the copy of the data frame sent by the other 
bridge on the right-side port. They see the source address and think this is Computer B 
sending Computer A another frame. They will now pass the frame back to the left-side 
port. Assuming Computer B is now on the right-side port, they change the table to 
reflect that status. This can go on forever, with both bridges detecting each other's trans- 
mitted frames and passing them across, then changing Computer B's status in the table 
from the right- to the left-side port over and over again. 
When the switching table is incorrectly set, Computer B will not be able to receive 
any data. When the table changes again and Computer B is identified as being on the 
correct bridge port, it will be able to receive data, but only until the tables are changed 
once more. The problem here is that a bridge looks at the source and destination 
addresses, but cannot identify duplicate frames. 
This does not mean that you can't have two bridges on a network. In fact, redun- 
dancy is a good idea, in case one bridge "dies." So how do you prevent the looping 
behavior? By using the Spanning Tree Protocol. If your bridge supports and is configured 
to use this protocol, it will be able to communicate with other bridges on the network. 
The two bridges will then work cooperatively, with one functioning in active mode and 
the other on standby unless or until it detects a failure of the first bridge. At that point, 
the second bridge will take over passing data frames. With only a single pathway avail- 
able at any given time, there is no possibility of a loop. 
Troubleshooting the Network Layer 
Both TCP and UDR which operating at the Transport Layer, rely on the Internet Protocol 
to actually move data from the sending to the receiving computer.As you've worked 
through this guide, you've learned that routing takes place at the Network Layer, and 
routing is all about recognizing network and host addresses and mapping out the most 
efficient way to get from one address to another.You would be performing a function sim- 
ilar to that of the Network Layer if you took on the job of navigator on a cross-country 
automobile trip. Just as TCP and IR working together, have different responsibilities, you 
and the driver could divide the duties so that the journey goes more smoothly. It's the 
driver's job to get the car to the destination safely and all in one piece (somewhat like the 
Transport Layer protocols). It's the job of the navigator to consult a map, determine exactly 
which highways will take you there, where to turn off one road and onto another, and to 
consider such factors as the size of each thoroughfare, known areas of congestion, and any- 
thing else that might make one route more desirable than another. This is similar to the 
job of the Network Layer; it is responsible for finding a path through a network to the 

Network Troubleshooting Methodology • Chapter 12 
755 
destination computer. It is also responsible for translating logical addresses (the IP addresses 
assigned by an administrator or a DHCP [Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol] server) 
into physical addresses. The physical, or MAC, address is burned into a chip on the network 
interface card by its manufacturer. 
IP routes messages based on the network number of the destination address. Every 
computer has a table of network numbers, known as a routing table. If there is an entry in 
the routing table for the destination network ID, the computer sends it to a gateway 
address, which represents the first router in the path to the destination. A default gateway 
address is included in the routing table to send packets to when a specific route to the 
destination network ID isn't found in the routing table. The default gateway must be on 
the same network as the source computer. Each gateway or router that the message must 
go through on the way to its destination is called a hop.Youmight say that a journey of 
a thousand hops begins with a single step: the gateway address listed in the routing table 
for a particular network number. 
The Network Layer can use either static or dynamic routing to find a path from a 
source to a destination computer. It's easy to map out a static route to a friend's house 
that is four blocks away~the path that you take will likely never change, and it's a 
simple one to remember. However, if" you're trying to get to the home of a relative who 
lives in the backwoods in another state, you may need more than a good map.You may 
need to call ahead and get directions from someone who has traveled there recently. As 
networks become larger and more complex, it becomes more difficult to manually 
maintain routing tables. When this happens, you will want to use a dynamic routing pro- 
tocol. Dynamic routing protocols automatically update routes on all routers on the net- 
work. The most common dynamic routing protocols available are the Routing 
Information Protocol (RIP) and the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol.

V 
routing software running on a Windows server, all operate at the Network 
Layer.

The TCP/IP protocol suite includes several protocols that operate at the Network 
Layer of the OSI model, including one of the two major components of the suite: the 
Internet Protocol. IP handles addressing and routing at the Network Level, relying on 
logical (IP) addresses. It can use packet switching methods to route different packets, 
which are all part of the same message, via different pathways. It can use dynamic 
routing protocols to determine the most efficient routes on a per-packet basis. IP is a 
connectionless protocol; it depends on TCP at the Transport Layer above it to provide a

756 
Chapter 12 • Network Troubleshooting Methodology 
connection, if necessary. However, it is able to use number sequencing to break down 
and reassemble messages, and uses a checksum to perform error checking on the IP 
header. 
Two additional TCP/IP protocols that operate at the Network Layer are the Address 
Resolution Protocol (AKP) and the Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP). 
ARP's job is to translate logical IP addresses to physical MAC addresses.AKP discovers 
this information by way of broadcasts, and keeps a table of IP-to-MAC entries. This table 
is referred to as the ARP cache. RARP is a similar protocol that does the opposite of 
ARP; instead of starting with an IP address and finding the matching MAC address, it

Chapter 12 
757 
uses the MAC address to find the IP address. This is somewhat like a reverse-lookup 
telephone directory. 
The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is known as a maintenance pro- 
tocol and is invaluable in TCP/IP troubleshooting. It allows two computers on an IP 
network to share IP status and error information. ICMP is used by the ping and tracert 
utilities that we discussed in Chapter 11, as well as the traceroute utility for UNIX and 
Linux computers. Computers and routers using IP can report errors and exchange con- 
trol and status information via ICMP. And finally, the Internet Group Management 
Protocol (IGMP) allows computers on a network such as the Internet to participate in 
IP multicasting. A multicast address allows an application to send a message to a large 
number of recipients without requiring the source computer to know the addresses of 
all the recipients. Network routers use IGMP to translate the multicast address into host 
addresses. This works because each computer involved in a multicast group will use 
IGMP to report its multicast group memberships to the necessary routers in order to receive 
the appropriate multicast messages. For example, if you sign up for a real-time webcast 
from your laptop computer, your laptop will use IGMP to register with the multicast 
router that will be transmitting the webcast. When the webcast starts, the webcast appli- 
cation will send its information to the multicast router, which will use IGMP to send 
the webcast to any computers who signed up for it (including yours).

Layer 3 Troubleshooting 
You'll spend quite a bit of time troubleshooting at the Network Layer, since this is the 
layer that really governs whether two computers can communicate with one another. A 
failure at the Network Layer can create connectivity issues where a single client or an 
entire subnet cannot communicate with another portion of a network, either because of 
a physical device failure or because of some type of misconfiguration. 
Especially when you're troubleshooting IP connectivity issues on a large network, 
it's helpful to have documentation of the physical and logical network design available so 
that you can understand how traffic should be flowing on your network, and potentially 
compare that to the path that it is actually taking.You'll recall that network routes are 
measured in hops, where each hop represents a single router between the source and 
destination computer. Because of this, you have the potential for failure at every hop 
along the way, and so you may need to test connectivity at every single hop. 
When troubleshooting Network Layer issues, there are a few common situations 
that tend to be the source of most connectivity issues. If a source computer is trying to 
send information to a destination computer, and the source computer's default gateway 
does not have a route to the destination, the packet will never reach the destination com- 
puter because the gateway doesn't know where to send it. This can happen, not only at 
the default gateway, but at every router along the path. There might also be a physical 
connectivity issue between the source and destination computers, where either a router 
or a network link that's required to transmit the information has failed or gone ofltine. 
The best tools to check connectivity at the Network Layer are ping, tracert, and path- 
ping for Windows systems, and ping and traceroute for UNIX/Linux systems. 
Troubleshooting tools are covered in Chapter 11. 
You should also check for configuration issues on each router along the path to 
ensure that nothing has changed or been configured incorrectly. A common misconfigu- 
ration, especially when new routers or network links are added to a network, is a routing 
loop, which occurs in this fashion: 
A source computer on Network A is trying to reach a destination computer 
on Network C. The source computer sends the packet to its default gateway, 
let's call it Router A. 
. 
Router A checks its routing table to figure out how to reach Network C. 
Router A sees that the next hop to Network C is Router B. So Router A 
sends the packet to Router B. 

Network Troubleshooting Methodology • Chapter 12 
759 
3. 
Router B receives the packet that's intended for Network C. Router B checks 
its routing table, and sees that the next hop to Network C...is Router A. So it 
sends the packet back to Router A. 
4. 
I bet you can guess what happens next: Router A receives the packet that's 
intended for Network C. It checks its routing table, and sends the packet to 
Router B, which then proceeds to send it back to Router A, and the process 
repeats itself until the Time-to-Live (TTL) of the packet has been exceeded 
and the packet is dropped. 
The good news is that a routing loop is easy to detect by using the tracert or tracer- 
oute command, since you'll see the path that the packet is taking bounce back and forth 
between the same two routers over and over again as follows:

If the connectivity failure is limited to a single workstation, use the ipconfig com-

Troubleshooting the Transport Layer 
The Transport Layer's main purpose in life is ensuring reliability. The Transport Layer 
must verify that any data sent by one computer arrives at its intended destination in 
good condition. It also needs a way to differentiate between different communications 

760 
Chapter 12 • Network Troubleshooting Methodology 
that may be addressed to different applications that are being served up by the same IP 
address. This is accomplished through the use of port numbers. Thanks to the multitasking 
capabilities of Windows 2000 and other modern operating systems, you can use more 
than one network application simultaneously. For example, you can use your Web 
browser to access your company's homepage at the same time your e-mail software is 
downloading your e-mail.You already know that TCP/IP uses an IP address to identify 
your computer on the network, and get the messages to the correct system, but how 
does it separate the response to your browser's request from your incoming mail when 
both messages arrive at the same IP address? 
This is where ports come in. The two parts of an IP address that represent the network 
address and the host address are somewhat like a street name and an individual street 
number. In this analogy, the port number would identify the specific apartment or suite 
within the building. 
TCP and UDP, the Transport Layer protocols, assign port numbers to each applica- 
tion so the data intended for the Web browser in Apartment A doesn't get sent to the e- 
mail program living in Apartment B. The Transport Layer uses two types of connection 
services: connection-oriented and connectionless. Which type of connection is most 
appropriate for sending a particular message depends on whether you are more con- 
cerned with reliability or speed. In TCP/IP communications, data is sent over the net- 
work as a sequence of datagrams. A datagram is a collection of data sent as a single 
message. Each datagram is sent across the network individually. 
A connection-oriented protocol such as TCP offers better error control, but can't send 
information as quickly because it needs to confirm that each datagram has reached its 
destination successfully. A connectionless protocol such as UDP, on the other hand, suf- 
fers in the reliability department but has better speed since it doesn't need to confirm 
the delivery of any datagrams that it sends. 
The easiest way to differentiate between connection-oriented and connectionless 
communications is by looking at the different ways you can send a letter from your local 
post office. If you need to send an important report to the manager of your company's 
branch office in E1 Paso, you could put it in an envelope, affix the required amount of 
postage, and drop it in the corner mailbox. This would be the easiest, quickest way to 
take care of the task, but you would have no idea whether or when the report reached 
its destination. On the other hand, you could go to the post office and fill out a card to 
send the report via registered, certified mail, with a return receipt requested. This would 
cost more and it would take more time and effort on your part, but it would be a more 
reliable form of communication.You would get back an acknowledgment when the 
package was delivered, showing that it was indeed received by the person to whom it 
was addressed. 
Connection-oriented services are more like the second example, although they actually 
go one step further: They establish the connection before sending the data. This would 
be as if, before you sent your certified mail, you first got on the telephone with the E1 
Paso manager and let him know the report was coming so he could be on the lookout

for its arrival. If you're really detail-minded (or paranoid), you could even ask that he call 
you back when it gets there, and let you know that all the pages are there in sequence 
and it wasn't damaged along the way.You've taken pains to make sure your communica- 
tion is as rehable as possible, but at a cost in terms of time (and long distance charges) to 
both you and the intended recipient.

Understanding TCP 
TCP works on the Transport Layer of the TCP/IP model, providing connection-based 
communication with other IP hosts. When an application passes data to the Transport 
Layer, it is often too much data to transmit in one packet, so TCP segments the data on 
the sending side and reassembles it at the receiving end according to sequence informa- 
tion that is packaged with the packet. TCP sends acknowledgments to confirm suc- 
cessful delivery and analyzes each packet according to checksum information to ensure 
data integrity. 
TCP uses a system of ports to manage communication. Applications bind to a spe- 
cific TCP port, and any inbound traffic delivered to that port will be picked up by the 
application. This enables multiple applications on one host to use TCP at the same time, 
and also standardizes the way a client can connect to a given service on a server. For 
instance, Telnet's standard TCP port is 23, so Telnet clients try to establish connections 
on port 23 by default. Port assignments are flexible; that is, you can change the port a 
client or server uses for a specific application if needed. Although Web servers typically 
use port 80 for HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) communication, the Web server 
application can be bound to a different port.You should be aware of the default TCP 
ports that are used by major applications when you're troubleshooting network issues at 
the Transport Layer. Table 12.1 illustrates some of the more common TCP applications 
and the ports they use:

Understanding UDP 
A connectionless transport protocol like UDP doesn't provide the same acknowledgment of 
receipt process as the connection-oriented TCP does. Since UDP doesn't sequence the 
packets that the data arrives in, an application program that uses UDP has to be able to 
make sure that the entire message has arrived and is in the right order. To save processing 
time, network applications that have very small data units to exchange, and thus very little 
message reassembling to do, may use UDP instead of TCE For example, DNS (Domain 
Name System) hostname lookup messages that will always fit in a single datagram can 
effectively use UDE For these very short queries, you don't need all the complexity of 
TCP; if you don't receive an answer after a few seconds, you can just ask again. 
UDP doesn't split data into multiple datagrams, as TCP does. It also doesn't keep 
track of what it has sent. Data can be resent if needed, and UDP doesn't guarantee 
delivery or protect against duplication. However, it is not completely irresponsible: it 
does provide for a checksum capability to ensure that data arrives intact, and it provides 
port numbers to distinguish between the requests sent by different user applications. 
Examples of applications that use UDP for communication include Trivial File Transfer 
Protocol (TFTP), RIP, RADIUS accounting, and some implementations of Kerberos

Layer 4 Trou bleshooti ng 
Troubleshooting the Transport Layer is quite similar to working at the Application Layer, 
since the TCP and UDP protocols form the basis of the ports that are used by all net- 
work applications. So you can use the telnet command to see if a particular port is lis- 
tening on the destination machine, and you can use the netstat utility to see a list of all 
ports that are listening on a particular machine.You should remember from Chapter 11 
that you can use netstat -a to do this, with results similar to the following:

If you run the netstat -a command on a server that's functioning as a Web server, 
you should see at least one entry in the netstat output to indicate that it's listening on 
port 80; if it's not, the WWW service might be stopped or disabled.

Troubleshooting the Session Layer 
The Session Layer handles the task of establishing a one-to-one session between the 
sending and the receiving computers. The Session Layer sets up and tears down applica- 
tion-to-application dialogs, and synchronizes the data flow for the applications. The 
Session Layer also controls whether a transmission is established as half-duplex or full- 
duplex. Full-duplex is bi-directional communication in which both sides can send and 
receive simultaneously. Half-duplex is also bi-directional communication, but the signals 
can flow in only one direction at a time. To illustrate the difference, think of how a tele- 
phone conversation works. Both parties can talk at the same time, and you can still hear 
the other person's voice while you're talking. That's full-duplex. But with most two-way 
radios like walkie-talkies, when you key the microphone to speak, you can't hear any- 
thing the other person might be saying while you're speaking. This means that only one 
of you can broadcast over the channel at a time. That's half-duplex. 

766 
Chapter 12 • Network Troubleshooting Methodology 
Another important responsibility of the Session Layer is to define the rules for data 
exchange between the applications. In this respect, you might think of the Session Layer 
as a referee or mediator who makes sure both parties (the sending and receiving com- 
puters) are aware of and agree to follow the "rules of the game" for that particular ses- 
sion. When two family members are at odds and seek counseling to help them 
communicate with one another, a good counselor or mediator will start the visit by get- 
ting both people to agree to certain rules. These might include who gets to talk first, 
and for how long, as well as the "format" of the communication (for example, no 
yelling, screaming, or name-calling). Although computers aren't known for getting emo- 
tional, before they can communicate effectively they also need to negotiate communica- 
tions guidelines. Otherwise, they may bombard each other with too much data to be 
processed, or both try to "talk" at the same time. The Session Layer controls this flow of 
conversation so that the message will get through clearly. In this way, the Session Layer 
provides for flow control. 
The most common protocols that exist at the Session Layer are usually Application 
Program Interfaces, or APIs, that control how an application will set up, manage, and tear 
down sessions between two computers. The most common APIs you'll encounter are 
NetBIOS, TCP/IP Sockets, and Remote Procedure Calls.These three APIs make it 
easier for software developers to create applications that can function over a network 
connection by standardizing how such an application should behave.You've already heard 
of TCP/IP sockets as the combination of an IP address and port number that's used by 
one computer to communicate with another: this is the Session Layer at work. 
Layer 5 Troubleshooting 
Just as the functions of the Presentation Layer are often swallowed up by Application 
Layer protocols, the functions of TCP/IP protocols from the Session Layer up to the 
Application layer will often span aH three layers~the difference between them can 
sometimes get a bit fuzzy. Because of this, it's not particularly common to perform trou- 
bleshooting that's geared only toward the Session Layer of the OSI model. 
The most common issues you'll see at the Session Layer involve slow network trans- 
missions between two computers, which is caused by one computer in a connection 
using a half-duplex connection instead of a full-duplex connection. This is especially 
troublesome on Windows PCs since they will default to usingauto-detect, where the 
network interface card will attempt to automatically detect the duplex type that it 
should be using. In Exercise 12.2, we'll configure a NIC on a Windows XP workstation 
to use a full-duplex connection.

Troubleshooting the Presentation Layer 
No, the Presentation Layer doesn't turn your data into PowerPoint slides! However, as 
the name suggests, it is responsible for the way in which data is presented, or formatted. 
The Presentation Layer handles such things as encryption (presenting the data in such a 
way as to keep it from being readable by unauthorized persons) and compression 
www.syngress.com 

768 
Chapter 12 • Network Troubleshooting Methodology 
(packaging the data in such a way as to get more of it through at a time). On the 
receiving side, the Presentation Layer is responsible for translating data into a format 
understandable by the application, and then presenting it to the Application Layer. 
Identifying the Cause of Client 
and Various Server Environment Problems" 
Since the Presentation Layer handles the very important task of protocol translation, this 
layer is where many gateways operate. One of the purposes of a network protocol is to 
provide a single "language" that different computers can use in order to talk to each 
other. In this case, a gateway acts as a translator between two separate protocols, so that com- 
puters that are running different protocols can communicate with each other. Gateways 
allow this process to take place transparently, so that Computer A doesn't realize that it needs 
a translator to communicate with Computer B; from the end user's perspective it just works 
automatically. Examples of gateways include: 
• 
E-mail gateway 
This software translates the messages from diverse, non- 
compatible e-mail systems into a common Internet format such as the Simple 
Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). Thus, Cousin Mary is able to read your letter 
even though you were using Microsoft Outlook with an Exchange server and 
she is on a NetWare network using GroupWise e-mail. 
• 
SNA gateway Systems Network Architecture (SNA) is a proprietary IBM 
architecture used in mainframe computer systems such as the AS/400.An SNA 
gateway allows personal computers on a local area network to access fries and 
applications on the mainframe computer. 
• 
Gateway Services for NetWare (GSNW) 
This software is included with 
the Windows 2000 and Windows NT Server operating systems to allow the 
Windows server's clients to access fries on a Novell NetWare server. It translates 
between the SMB (Server Message Block) file sharing protocol used on 
Microsoft networks and NCP (NetWare Core Protocol), the file sharing pro- 
tocol used by the NetWare networks. 
There are almost as many gateway products available as there are different protocol 
combinations, and more are being developed all the time as interoperability becomes 
increasingly important to connect the diverse systems that are available. For example, 
there are services that you can install on a Windows server or client to allow access to 
the AppleTalk protocol for Macintosh and OS X resources, UNIX and Linux servers 
and clients, as well as the Gateway Services for NetWare. 
Another common function of the Presentation Layer is translating text and graphics 
from one format to another. So the Presentation Layer might translate text from a com- 
puter using EBCDIC (Extended Binary-Coded Decimal Interchange Code) encoding 
so that it can be understood by a computer using ASCII (American Standard Code for

default frame type. NetWare 4.0 and later use 802.2 as the default. 
Layer 6 Troubleshooting 
You won't run into a great many problems with troubleshooting at the Presentation 
Layer, since most of the duties handled by this layer are stable technologies that have 
been around for decades. Additionally, the functions of the Presentation Layer will often 
actually be performed by a protocol that you would normally think of as functioning at 
the Application Layer, so that troubleshooting will all take place using the steps we'll 
describe in the next section.

Some examples of problems you may find at the Presentation Layer include:

one person to another.

E-mail messages between two different server types (Exchange and 
GroupWise, for example) become scrambled or unreadable. 

770 
Chapter 12 • Network Troubleshooting Methodology 
You are unable to copy or move files between two different network types, 
usually Microsoft and Novell, or you are unable to open a file once it's been 
copied. 
In most cases, you can resolve these issues by restarting or re-installing the gateway 
service that's creating these errors: restarting the Gateway Services for NetWare on your 
Windows 2000 server, for example. 
Troubleshooting the Application Layer 
Especially where the application is concerned, be sure to keep in mind that the OSI 
model describes only the logical networking components, not any specific programs that 
you'll use like Internet Explorer or Microsoft Outlook. By remembering this, you won't 
make the common mistake of thinking the Application Layer actually represents user 
application software. 
What the Application Layer really does to is define how a user's application will 
interact with a network protocol. In other words, Application Layer protocols accept 
user data to be transmitted on the network, that is, the data that's created by the user 
application that's operating above the networking layers. For example, if you want to 
send an e-mail message, your user application might be Microsoft Outlook. A user 
sending e-mail will see only the application interface, not any underlying protocols. 
They can type their letters to Cousin Mary, perhaps attach graphics files containing 
photos of the grizzly bear who almost ate Uncle Joe from their last family outing to 
Yellowstone National Park, and then click Send. Assuming that they typed the correct 
e-mail address in the "to" field, they've configured their e-mail software properly, their 
hardware is working, their phone lines aren't down, and their ISP is on the ball (quite a 
lot of assumptions, to be sure), the message goes through and lands in Mary's e-mail 
Inbox. Neither the user sending the message nor Cousin Mary needs to know anything 
about what the networking components of their respective operating systems are doing 
in order to communicate via e-mail. That's because the application itself (Outlook) sends 
the data (the message they typed) to the Application Layer, and the Application Layer 
takes it from there. The Application Layer adds header information, which will be used 
by the Application Layer on the receiving end, and then passes the information down to 
the Presentation Layer. The Application Layer is the top level of the OSI model, and is 
the layer that resides closest to the user. The Application Layer is different from the lower 
layers of the model because it doesn't provide services to any other OSI layer. Instead, it 
provides network services to user applications such as spreadsheet programs, word pro- 
cessing, and e-mail programs.

771 
Application Layer Protocols 
TCP/IP provides several protocols that operate at the Application Layer to provide ser- 
vices such as news, mail and fde transfer, and monitoring/diagnostics capability. The 
most common protocols that operate at the Application layer are as follows: 
• 
FTP 
The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is used for copying files from one 
computer to another. Windows 2000, XP, and Windows Server 2003 include 
both a command-line FTP client program, and the FTP server service that is 
installed as part of the Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS). If you 
haven't installed the FTP server service on a Windows computer, you will only 
have access to the FTP client, which is available from the Windows command 
line when TCP/IP is installed. 
• 
SNMP 
The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) provides a way 
to gather statistical and troubleshooting information about devices such as PCs, 
routers, switches, and hubs. An SNMP management system sends requests to an 
SNMP agent, and the information is stored in a Management Information 
Base (MIB). The MIB is a database that holds information about a networked 
computer (for example, how much hard disk space is available). In order to 
install the SNMP service on a Windows computer, you need to be logged on 
as a member of the Administrators group. The SNMP agent software is 
installed as a Windows Component and runs as a service. 
~J~M WARNING 
r SNMP management software is not currently included with the Windows oper- 
r ating system and has to be purchased and installed separately. 
O 
Telnet Telnet is a TCP/IP-based service that allows users to log onto a com- 
puter from a remote location, run character-mode or command-line utilities 
on the remote computer or device, and view files on a remote device. 
Windows 2000 and 2003 Server computers include both Telnet server and 
Telnet client software, while Windows client operating systems such as 
Windows 2000 and XP Professional only include the Telnet client. Telnet dif- 
fers from FTP in that you cannot transfer files from one computer to another 
(upload or download). Telnet is often used to access a UNIX shell account on 
an ISP's server and delete e-mail messages directly from the server without 
downloading them to the local machine. The Telnet server service uses TCP 
port 25 to listen for Telnet requests.

• 
SMTP The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol is used for sending e-mail messages, 
typically across the Internet. SMTP is a simple ASCII protocol and is not 
vendor-specific. Because SMTP has limited capability in queuing messages at the 
receiving end, most e-marl client programs use SMTP for sending e-marl only, 
and either POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3) or IMAP (Internet Message 
Access Protocol) for storing any messages that are received by an e-marl server. 
The SMTP service uses TCP port 25 to send messages using SMTP. 
• 
HTTP 
The HyperText Transfer Protocol is perhaps the most familiar of the 
Application Layer protocols because it is used on the World Wide Web, the 
most popular Internet service. HTTP allows computers to exchange files in 
various formats (text, graphic images, sound, video, and other multimedia files) 
via client software called a Web browser. A computer running a Web server pro- 
gram, such as Microsoft's Internet Information Server, stores files in HyperText 
Markup Language (HTML) format that can be accessed by the client browser. 
These HTML pages often contain hyperlinks for quickly and automatically 
connecting to other files on the Internet, on an intranet, or on the local 
machine. The HTTP protocol uses TCP port 80 to send and receive informa- 
tion to Web servers and clients. 
• 
NNTP 
Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) is used for managing mes- 
sages posted to private and public newsgroups. NNTP servers provide for 
storage of newsgroup posts, which can be downloaded by client software called 
a newsreader. Windows 2000 and 2003 Server include an NNTP server as a part 
of IIS. Outlook Express, which is part of the Internet Explorer software 
included with Windows 2000, XP, and 2003, provides both an e-mail client 
and a newsreader. The NNTP service defaults to using TCP oort 119. 
• 
DNS The Domain Name System is used by most of the other applications in 
the TCP/IP protocol suite to resolve hostnames to IP addresses. A Web 
browser, for example, cannot establish a connection to a Web server unless it 
knows the IP address of the server. DNS is used to resolve hostnames, such as 
www.microsoft.com, to IP addresses. DNS is a distributed database that is 
essential for TCP/IP to be used on a massive Internet-sized scale. It provides a 

Network Troubleshooting Methodology • Chapter 12 
773 
function that hides the complexity of IP addresses from users, and makes things 
such as e-mail and the World Wide Web much easier to use. 
DHCP 
The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol is used to dynamic assign 
TCP/IP addresses and configuration information to clients and servers. IP 
addressing information is leased by a DHCP server for a specific period of 
time, usually three days, before the lease must be renewed by the client.You 
can also use a DHCP server to centrally configure TCP/IP client options such 
as the default gateway, subnet mask, and DNS servers for your DHCP clients. 
This is particularly convenient because if you need to change one Of these 
options you can change it once on the DHCP server rather than needing to 
make a change on every single client in your environment. Windows NT, 
2000, 2003, and UNIX/Linux servers can act as a DHCP server; all Windows 
and UNIX/Linux can act as clients.You can use the ipconfig/release and 
ipconfig/renew commands to refresh the DHCP configuration on a partic- 
ular workstation. 
' 
M WARNING 
Windows DHCP clients are able to use Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA) if 
they are unable to contact a DHCP server. This allows for limited connectivity 
using the 169.254.0.0 Class B address that does not include DNS name resolu- 
tion or a default gateway. 
Determining Impact of Modifying, 
Adding or Removing Networi¢ Services 
for Network Resources and Users 
Because the Application Layer is the layer at which name resolution services like DNS 
and WINS (Windows Internet Naming Service) function, this is the layer you'll be 
working at if you run into a troubleshooting scenario involving clients that cannot 
access resources using their Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs) or NetBIOS 
names. This builds from the troubleshooting that you performed at all of the layers 
below: at the Physical Layer, you looked for broken cables or malfunctioning NICs to 
isolate physical connectivity problems. At the Network Layer, you used ping and tracert 
(or traceroute for a UNIX/Linux computer) to determine if network packets were 
being properly routed from one host to another. Troubleshooting the Application Layer 
means that all of the underlying layers are functioning properly, but your clients are still 
running into problems. If you can ping a remote host using its IP address, but pinging its 
wwwsyngress.com 

774 
Chapter 12 • Network Troubleshooting Methodology 
FQDN returns a "Request Timed Out" error, then you have an issue with DNS name 
resolution.You can use nslookup or dig to troubleshoot an existing DNS server, as we dis- 
cussed in the previous chapter. If, on the other hand, you are working on an internal 
network that doesn't have a DNS server in place, you should consider implementing one 
so that your clients can access remote resources by using easy-to-remember hostnames 
rather than IP addresses. 
Likewise, if your clients are unable to access remote hosts using their NetBIOS 
names, but they are able to access computers using their associated IP addresses, then 
you need to put a mechanism in place to allow your clients to perform NetBIOS name 
resolution. This is especially necessary to allow access to file and print services on a 
Windows network, since these services rely heavily on NetBIOS name resolution. On a 
small network with only two or three hosts, you can do this by placing an lmhosts file 
on each computer. An lmhosts file is a plain text file that includes the IP address of the 
host in question, followed by its NetBIOS name, as you can see here: 
10.0.0.8 
SERVER1 
i0.0.0.i 
SERVER2 
i0.0.0.i05 
SERVER3 
Once you go beyond a small number of clients and hosts, though, lmhosts fries 
become difficult to manage. For larger networks, you should install a WINS server to pro- 
vide NetBIOS name resolution on a larger scale, and configure your network clients to 
use this WINS server to register their NetBIOS names so that other clients can locate the 
resources that they need.You can think of a WINS server as performing the same function 
for NetBIOS name resolution that DNS does for Internet-based name resolution. 
.... ~!iii!iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!iiiiiiiii!iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!iiii!iiiiiii~ .... 
::'~iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii}iii!iiiiiiiiiiii!ii!iiiiiii!iiii~"' For a small number of clients, you can use a hosts file for basic DNS resolution 
~iiiiiii~i~i~i~il;ii~i'~i'~;i~i~,i'~i~:~:i':~::~:~:ii! 
~' as well. A hosts file will take the same format as an Imhosts file, except that it

Layer 7 Trou bleshooting 
You'll probably spend quite a bit of time troubleshooting Application Layer issues, since 
these are the most visible to an end user. This can be something as simple as "My Internet 
Explorer won't work" to troubleshooting mail routing issues for an e-mail server that's 
running SMTR One of the most useful utilities for troubleshooting Application Layer pro- 
tocols is Telnet, since you can use this tool to connect to many different application layer 
services by specifying the port that's used by the service. So you can Telnet to a Web server, 

Network Troubleshooting Methodology • Chapter 12 
775 
specifying port 80, to see if the Web server is listening on that port. If the Web server 
doesn't respond, then you know that something is wrong with the Web service on that 
particular server. On the other hand, if you can successfully Telnet to port 80, then you 
know that the problem lies elsewhere and you can concentrate your troubleshooting 
efforts on problems with client configuration or name resolution.

To troubleshoot name resolution problems, you can use the nslookup utility that

we discussed at length in Chapter 11.

Identifying a, Client's Remote Network Access Problem 
In Exercise 12.3, we 11 go through the steps of troubleshooting the SMTP service on an 
~~____ e-mail server by using Telnet. 
EXERCISE 1 2.3 
i 
USING TELNET TO TROUBLESHOOT FTP 
1. Click Start I Programs I Accessories I Command Prompt to access 
the Windows command prompt. 
2. Type telnet servername 25. 5ervername indicates the IP address or DNS 
name of the e-mail server that you are troubleshooting. 25 specifies 
that you are Telnetting to port 25 of that server. So to connect to the 
mail.example.com server, you would type telnet mail.example.corn 25 
at the command prompt. If this is successful, you'll see something like 
this: 
220 mail.example.com Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail Connector 
, 
From here, you can try to send a test e-mail message directly from the 
Telnet window. Begin by typing the following (substitute the domain of 
a valid email address for example.corn)" 
HELO example.com 
4. 
If this command works, you'll see the following: 
250 OK 
. 
Next, specify the e-mail address that the test message is from by 
entering the following, using a valid e-mail address" 

776 
Chapter 12 • Network Troubleshooting Methodology 
MAIL FROM:user@example.com 
6. 
If this was successful, you'll see the following: 
250 OK - MAIL FROM user@example.com 
. 
Next, specify the e-mail address to send the test message to. Type the 
following, using a valid recipient address that's located on the server 
you're testing (so if you're troubleshooting the example.com email 
server, try sending a test message to jenny@example.com rather than 
joe@mycompany.com). Use the following syntax to specify the recip- 
ient's e-mail address: 
RCPT TO: jenny@example.com 
8. 
If this was successful, you'll see the following: 
250 OK- 
Recipient jenny@example.com 
, 
10. 
Type DATA to begin entering the text of your message. Then type the 
text of the test message that you want to send. 
To let the SMTP server know that you're finished, type a period (.) on a 
blank line and then press Enter. If the message was created successfully, 
you'll see the following: 
250 OK 
11. 
Type QUIT to exit the Telnet session. Verify that the recipient received 
the test message. If it did not, you can check the error logs generated 
by the e-mail server, as well as the configuration of the recipient's e- 
mail client.

There is a great deal of troubleshooting information for WCe/Ze and other network 
issues. Be sure to take advantage of the following: 
• 
Microsoft documentation, including Help files, the Resource Kits, white 
papers, TechNet, official newsgroups, and the Microsoft website. 
::ii2)
• 
Third-party documentation, including Internet mailing lists, Usenet public 
iilN!ii!!!i!~; 
newsgroups, Web resources, local user groups, and books and magazines. 
Following an organized set of troubleshooting steps allows you to organize the trou- 
bleshooting process and makes it less likely that you will overlook something important 
i~
along the way. The problem-solving models used by other professions can be applied to 
network troubleshooting as well. Gathering information is always one of the first steps in 
i
problem solving. In network troubleshooting, as in most areas, this involves asking ques- 
tions. Which questions to ask (and of whom) vary according to the situation, but the 
~° 
following can serve as a guideline to get you started: 
• 
Exactly what task were you trying to perform when the problem occurred? 
• 
Were you doing anything else in addition to this primary task at the time? 
• 
What error message(s), if any, were displayed? 
• 
Is anyone else on the network experiencing the same problem? 
• 
Have you ever been able to perform this task on this computer? 
• 
When was the last time you were able to do so? 
• 
What changes have occurred since the last time you were able to do so?

.... 
In order to make a diagnosis or analysis of the information, you must organize it in 
a logical manner. This means learning to sift through and discard irrelevant information, 
and looking for patterns in the data. This also means setting priorities according to such 
factors as who is affected by the problem, how many are affected by the problem, what 
production activities are affected by the problem, and how often the problem occurs. 
Solutions, once formulated, should also be prioritized according to cost, time involved, 
longevity, and long-term effect on performance.

Application Layer Troubleshooting 
V-'-'-'d The Application Layer is the top layer of the OSI model, and provides services 
to actual end user applications on the desktop or server. 
V¢I Be sure you understand the difference between the Application Layer protocol, 
like HTTP, and the actual application that it supports, like Internet Explorer. 
V4I You can use Telnet to connect to specific ports on a server to see if the HTTP, 
SMTP, and FTP protocols are functioning. 
Presentation Layer Troubleshooting 
I4I The Presentation Layer handles the way that data is formatted between 
different systems, such as translating text from a system that uses EBCDIC 
encoding and one that uses ASCII. 
I-4I In many cases, the function of the Presentation Layer is handled by the 
Application Layer service like HTTP, so isolating Presentation Layer problems 
can be difficult. 
I-¢I Certain types of gateways also function at the Presentation Layer, such as 
Gateway Service for NetWare in Windows 2000 Server. 
Session Layer Troubleshooting 
The Session Layer controls how two computers will create, maintain and tear 
down a conversation (also called a session) between them. 
. . . .  
Layer also controls whether a connection is full-duplex (able to 
~oth directions simultaneously), or half-duplex (only able to 
)ne direction at a time). 

Network Troubleshooting Methodology • Chapter 12 
779 
V¢I A mismatch in full-versus half-duplex can create significant performance 
degradation between two computers that are attempting to communicate. 
Transport Layer Troubleshooting 
V¢I The Transport Connection Protocol (TCP) and the User Datagram Protocol 
(UDP) both exist at the Transport Layer, which controls whether 
communications between computers are connection-oriented and 
acknowledged, or connectionless with low overhead. 
V¢I Use netstat -a to see a list of which TCP and UDP ports are currently 
listening on a particular server. 
You can use Telnet to test connectivity at the Transport Layer in addition to 
testing the Application Layer.

computers. 
V4I The most important device that operates at the Network Layer is the router, 
: 
and router troubleshooting will include troubleshooting the physical device as 
} 
i 
well as how it is configured. 
ICMP operates at the Network Layer, and is used to provide troubleshooting 
information for TCP/IP troubleshooting utilities such as ping, tracert, and 
traceroute. 
Data Link Layer 
V¢I The Data Link layer is responsible for taking the information it gets from the 
Physical layer and organizing it into flames. 
The devices that operate at the Data Link Layer are switches and bridges. 
Troubleshooting these devices includes verifying that the correct frame type is 
being used and that any virtual LANs (VLANs) are configured correctly. 
V¢I The Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) can be used to prevent the possibility of 
loops on a switched or bridged network.

Physical Layer 
The Physical Layer is the lowest layer of the OSI model, and is concerned with 
the physical cabling and network devices that connect you to the network. 
Troubleshooting often begins at the Physical Layer, where you need to 
determine if your network cards, hubs, and cabling are functioning and 
connected correctly. 
F-el Be sure that you are using the correct type of NIC for your network type and 
the correct cabling to allow for network connectivity.

Q. is it possible for me to disable NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NetBT)? 
,/~: Microsoft states that you can remove NetBT once you have a pure Windows 2000 
environment. Since WINS relies on NetBT, you cannot disable NetBT until you are 
no longer relying on WINS for name resolution.Additionally, legacy applications 
and logon scripts oft~~tBIOS

Q. What is a gateway, and why would I need one? 
~~ 
A. The word gateway has many different meanings in the IT world. A protocol-translating 
,,,to,,,,,,, ~,-~,~l~to~ between different protocols. Think of it as the United Nations inter- 
orking world. If the President of the United States needs to exchange 
:he Chancellor of Germany, but neither speaks the other's language, 

Network Troubleshooting Methodology ° Chapter 12 781 
they can call in someone who is fluent in both to help them get their messages across. 
Similarly, if a mainframe system and a Windows 2000 computer need to communicate 
with one another~perhaps the mainframe has important files that need to be accessed 
by the PC~but they don't know how to "talk" to each other, you can install a gateway 
to clear up the confusion. The gateway is even more skilled than the interpreter is; it 
actually fools the mainframe into believing it's communicating with another mainframe, 
and makes the PC think it is having a "conversation" with a fellow PC. Gateway is also 
the term used to refer to the address of a router that connects your network to another, 
acting as the gateway to the "outside world." 
Q. What is the difference between TCP and UDP if they both operate at the Transport 
n aye r ? 
,~,, ,~ ~:~:~:~:~:~:~
A" Although both TCP and UDP are Transport Layer protocols and provide the same 
~: 
.... 
basic function, TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, which means a session is 
{!~{}i ~
established before data is transmitted, and acknowledgments are sent back to the 
sending computer to verify that the data did arrive and was accurate and complete. 
UDP is connectionless; no session or one-to-one connection is established prior to 
data transmission.This makes UDP the faster of the two, while TCP is the more 
reliable,

workstations configured in a peer-to-peer workgroup. This office does not have a 
server computer at this time. One of the workstations, \\OFFICE1, has an IP 
address of 192.168.1.100 and hosts a file share that the other three workstations are 
able to access using the following syntax: \\OFFICEl\share.Your client has called 
you in to troubleshoot a new workstation that they have recently installed that is 
unable to access this share. When you arrive on site, you find that the workstation 
is able to ping OFFICE1 by its IP address, but not by its NetBIOS name. What is 
the best way for you to allow the new workstation to access the file share located

A. The default gateway is unavailable. 
B. 
The workstation could not contact a DHCP server. 
C. The workstation is configured with the incorrect default gateway. 
D. The workstation's DHCP lease has expired. 
5. You are the network administrator for a sales office. Until now, this has been a 
small peer-to-peer network consisting of five Windows 2000 professional worksta- 
tions using lmhosts files on each workstation to perform DNS name resolution. 
The sales force has recently expanded significantly, requiring you to purchase a 
Windows Server 2003 server and fifteen additional workstations.You have encoun- 
tered numerous troubleshooting situations where a workstation's lmhosts file was 
missing or out of date, preventing name resolution from taking place. How can you 
improve the name resolution process for your network? 
A. Install the DNS service on the Windows 2000 server. 
B. 
Install the WINS service on the Windows 2000 server. 
C. Install the DHCP service on the Windows 2000 server. 
D. Install the DNS service on each Windows XP workstation. 
6. You are the network administrator for a large pharmaceutical company that has 
over 1,000 workstations. To simplify TCP/IP configuration for these numerous 
clients, you installed a DHCP server over a year ago to automatically configure 
your clients with an IP address, as well as the following common configuration 
information: 
Subnet Mask: 
255.255.0.0 
Default Gateway: 172.16.0.1 
DNS Servers:

As part of a recent network redesign, you had to change the default gateway 
used by your clients to a different IP address: 172.16.1.1.You made the necessary 
change on the DHCP server, and most of your clients were updated automatically. 
After you make this change, you receive a call from one user who no longer able 
to browse the Internet.You examine the TCP/IP configuration of her LAN con- 
nection and see the following:

Chapter 1 Network Fundamentals 
1. 
You are creating a network for a small business with only four employees. Because 
employees often leave the office to visit clients, a minimum of one person is in the 
office and using a computer at any given time. Currently there are two computers 
in the office, but the company is willing to purchase more if needed. Based on this 
information, what is the minimum number of computers that you'll need to create a 
network?

A. 
One 
B. 
Two 
C. Three 
D. Four 
B. Two. A network can exist when two or more computers are connected 
together to form a network. While additional computers can be used to create 
the network, a minimum of" two is needed so the computers can communicate 
and exchange data. 
A, C, D. Answer A is incorrect because at least two computers are necessary 
to create a network. It" there is only one computer, it would be a standalone, 
and not connected to a network of" other computers. Answers C and D are 
incorrect because the question asks for the minimum number of computers 
needed to create a network. 
The LAN used by your organization is on a single floor of a building. The network 
has servers and other resources that are kept in a secure server room.You are the only 
network administrator in the organization, and have sole responsibility for managing 
these resources and administration of network security for all of the users who are dis- 
tributed throughout the network. What type of network model is being used? 
A. Centralized 
B. 
Decentralized 
C. Distributed 
D. Peer-to-peer 
V~ A. Centralized. Centralized network models have resources that are centrally 
located and administered. In this situation, there is one network administrator 
that is responsible for managing servers and other resources that are centrally 
located. 

° 
o 
Self Test Appendix 
!~ii!'iiiill ii!i ~I~ !iii !iiiiii~i !i !ii/ 
B, C, D. Answers B and C are incorrect because decentralized and distributed 
networks have resources and administration that spans the entire network. They 
.... 
are not centrally located, but various system administrators or designated users 
provide management of resources in various areas of the network. Answer D is 
incorrect because servers are used, making this a client/server model. 
Your company's network is on several floors of a building. Due to the amount of 
data being stored, there are three file servers, a Web server for the intranet, an e-mail 
server for internal e-mail, and a SQL server that is used for several databases that 
have been developed in house. Due to security reasons, floppy disks and other 
devices to transfer or transmit data to and from the computer have been removed 
and aren't permitted. What type of network model is being used? 
A. Client/server 
B. Peer-to-peer 
C. 
M A N  
~!i:~!ii~i~i~i!i~i%i!i~!~!~i!i~ii!~i!i~i~
D. PAN 
..............................................
A. Client/server. Computers on this network act as clients by requesting data 
and other services from dedicated servers. The Client/Server model involves 
.........................
...... 
dedicated servers that provide services and data to clients, without making sim- 
ilar requests of them. It consists of high-end computers serving clients on a 
............. 
network, by providing them with specific services upon request. 
~ 
iii ii~ 
lk-1 B, C, D. Answer B is incorrect because servers are being used, so this isn't a 
peer-to-peer network. On a peer-to-peer network, computers on the network 
are equals and aren't in the role of dedicated servers.Answers C and D are 
i
incorrect because these aren't network models, they are types of networks. 
Because the network doesn't extend across a metropolitan area, it isn't a MAN 
and because personal devices aren't being used to network with computers or 
other network devices, it isn't a PAN. 
A company has hired you to create a network for their small business. Security isn't 
an issue, and there isn't enough money to hire or train a permanent network admin- 
istrator. Users of the network routinely work on similar projects, and need to access 
one another's data on a regular basis. What type of network model will you use?

B Peer-to-Peer. On a peer-to-peer network, computers on the network are 
equals and have the ability to access data and services they've been permitted 
to use on other machines, as well as to provide services and data to others. 
A, C, D. Answer A is incorrect because the requirements specified in the 
question define a peer-to-peer network model. A client/server model provides 
increased security, which isn't needed for this network, and also generally 
requires someone to be hired or trained as a network administrator. Answers C 
and D are incorrect because these aren't network models, but are roles on a 
client/server network. A client requests data and resources, while a server pro- 
vides them.

A company has multiple offices that are internetworked. Office A has a single com- 
puter that has the ability to dial into the Internet, but isn't connected to the other 
offices. Office B is in another part of the country from the other offices, but doesn't 
have its network interconnected to the other offices. Offices C and D are in separate 
states, but have a dedicated connection between them. Office C has twenty com- 
puters that access each other's machines, and provide services and data to one 
another. Office D has fifty computers that log onto the network using a single 
server. Based on this information, which of the offices are part of both a LAN and a 
WAN? 
A. Offices A and B 
B. Offices B and C 
C. Offices C and D 
D. The entire network (Offices A, B, C, and D) 
C. Offices C and D. Both of these offices have LANs. Office C has a peer-to- 
peer network, while Office D has a client/server network. They are intercon- 
nected to one another, and thereby part of a WAN. 
N1 A, B, D. Answer A is incorrect because Office A doesn't have a network, but 
only an Internet connection, and because Office B isn't part of a WAN. 
Answer B is incorrect because although Office B has a LAN, it isn't connected 
to the other networks and therefore isn't part of the WAN. Answer D is incor- 
rect because not every office has a LAN, and the others connected together 
form a WAN.

An organization has offices in two countries. Office A is a small field office with 
two networked computers and is internetworked with Office B, which is across the 
road and has ten networked computers. Because they are a subsidiary of the main 
company, and perform different services from the rest of the organization, neither of 
these offices has been internetworked with the other offices, and is awaiting Internet

single computer, isn't networked with other offices, and only has an Internet con- 
nection. Office D is the headquarters of the company, has one hundred network 
............

users who are awaiting Internet connectivity to be added to the network, and has a 
.... 
network connection to Office E in London, which is their European office. Based 
i 
on this information, which of the offices is connected to the largest WAN? 
A. Office A 
B. Office B 
C. Office C 
D. Office D 
C. Office C. Office C is connected to the Internet, which is the largest WAN. 
~! A, B, D. Answers A and B are incorrect because Office A and Office B are 
networked together, but are across the road from one another, and have the 
smallest number of network users (except for Office C, which has no users 
who are part of this network). Answer D is incorrect because although they 
! 
have a WAN connecting the LANs in each country, Office D doesn't have a 
connection to the Internet (which is the largest WAN). 
, 
wiU you choose in connecting these networks? 
A. Dial-up modem 
B. ISDN 
C. T1 
D. T3 
V-'-Z C. T1. Office C is connected to the Internet, which is the largest Wide Area 
Network. The company needs to send a maximum of 1Mbps, which is below 
the T1 speed of 1.544Mbps. While slower than T3 (which is more expensive), 
it meets the needs of the company. 
A company wants to create a WAN between two networks in different cities.To 
connect them, you want to have the fastest possible connection to meet their needs.

~1 A, B, D. Answer A is incorrect because a dial-up modem has a maximum 
speed of 56Kbps, which is well below what they need. Answer B is incorrect 
because it, too, has a lower bandwidth than they need. ISDN has a maximum 
speed of 128Kbps. Answer D is incorrect because a T3 connection provides 
speeds ranging from 3Mbps to 44.736Mbps, which makes it faster than 
required for their needs. It is also the most expensive, meaning that a T3 would 
be a waste of money.

A company has several offices that are networked together across the city. Each of 
the sales representatives uses PDAs to keep track of appointments with clients. The 
company has just implemented a new system where the appointments taken by 
receptionists are automatically uploaded to the PDAs whenever the sales staff enters 
the main reception area. What types of networks are being used in this environ- 
ment? Choose all that apply. 
A. MAN 
B. SAN 
C. CAN 
D. PAN 
A and D. MAN and PAN. A MAN is a metropolitan area network and con- 
sists of a group of LANs that are internetworked within a local geographical 
area, such as a city. A PAN is a personal area network, which allows wireless 
transmission of information between computers and devices like PDAs. 
C, D. Answer C is incorrect because a SAN is a storage area network, in 
which storage devices are networked together on a segment of the network so 
that computers on a LAN can view and store data on them. Answer D is 
incorrect because the network is more dispersed than a CAN. A CAN is a 
campus area network, which internetworks buildings that are closely situated

10. Your network uses cells to send and receive data to and from computers. This 
I 
allows computers in different buildings to be networked together so they can 
access data from servers in either building. A topology map has been created, using 
circles to identify the areas that computers can be placed to access the network. 
Based on this information, which of the following topologies is being used? 
A. Star 
B. Mesh 
C. Wireless 
D. Ring 
g¢l C. Wireless. A wireless topology uses transmitters called cells, which broadcast 
the packets using radio frequencies. The cells extend a radio sphere around the 
transmitter in the shape of a bubble that can extend to m 
possibly different floors in a building.

l~l A, B, D. Answer A is incorrect because a star network doesn't use cells to send 
and receive data to and from computers. It cables computers to a centralized 
hub. Answer B is incorrect because a mesh topology also doesn't use cells, but 
uses a greater amount of cable than any other topology due to multiple con- 
nections between a computer and other computers on the network. Answer D 
is incorrect because a ring topology also doesn't use cells, but has computers 
connected to a looped cable. 
11. You are training a new member of the IT staff, and decide to explain the 
topology of the existing network, shown below. What topology is currently 
being used? 
A. Bus 
B. Star 
C. Mesh 
D. Ring 
V--el C. Mesh. A mesh topology has every component of the network connected 
directly to every other component. This creates an extremely fault tolerant net- 
work, but is expensive and difficult to maintain. 
A, B, D. Answer A is incorrect because in a bus topology, all of the computers 
are connected using a single cable, which is called a trunk, backbone, or seg- 
ment. Answer B is incorrect because a star topology has computers connected 
to a central hub or switch. Answer D is incorrect because a ring topology has 
computers connected to each other in a physical ring arrangement. 
12. You are reviewing different topologies that will be used for a small network within 
your company.You want to ensure that all computers on the network have equal 
access.You also want to use a topology that is relatively easy to troubleshoot if a 
cable fails or breaks. Based on these criteria, which of the following topologies 
would you choose? 
A. Bus 
B. Mesh 
C. Wireless 
D. Ring 
D. Ring. In a ring topology, every computer has equal access to communicate 
on the network. An electronic signal called a token is passed around the net- 
work. When computer has the token, it has the option of communicating over 
the network, and will then pass it to the next computer in the loop.

Answer B is also incorrect for this reason, because a mesh topology uses the most 
amount of cabling, as every network component is cabled to every other network 
component. Answer C is incorrect because clients access a wireless network using 
wireless technology, so all computers wouldn't be cabled to the network. 
13. The IEEE 802 standards split a lower layer of the OSI model into two sublayers. 
One of these sublayers is used to establish connections between computers, and 
used by other protocols defined by the 802 committee. Which sublayer performs 
these actions, and which OSI layer is it part of?. 
A. Media Access Control, which is part of the Data Link Layer 
B. Logical Link Control, which is part of the Data Link Layer 
C. Physical Layer, which is part of the Data Link Layer 
D. Data Link Layer, which is part of the Logical Link Control Layer 
B. Logical Link Control, which is part of the Data Link Layer. The LLC is 
covered by the 802.2 standard, and is one of two sublayers that correspond to 
the Data Link Layer of the OSI model.The Logical Link Control is used to 
establish connections between computers, and is used by other protocols 
defined by the 802 committee. 
A, C, D. Answer A is incorrect because the Media Access Control is not used

media. Answer D is incorrect because the Logical Link Control is a sublayer of 
the Data Link Layer, not the other way around. 
14. The network used in your organization uses the IEEE 802.3 standard. Before 
sending data onto the network, a computer will listen to ensure the network is 
clear so that two computers don't send data onto the cable at the same time. When 
two computers send out data at the same time, which of the following is true? 
A. A critical network error will have occurred from a collision, and the network 
will crash. 
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii~ii~"~'%!
B. The computer detecting the collision will send out a signal to all other com- 
puters. Because the collision has been detected, all devices will stop transmit- 
ting data for a random period of time, listen to see if the network is free of 
traffic, and then begin sending data again.

C. The computer detecting the collision will send out a signal to all the other 
computers. Because it detected the problem, it now has precedence over the 
other computers, and can send its data before any other computer. 
D. None of the above. This cannot happen because the computers listen for net- 
work traffic before sending, which prevents data collisions from ever occurring. 
B. A network using Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection or 
Ethernet is being discussed in this situation. If two devices transmit at the same 
time, a collision occurs. Each device stops transmitting and sends a signal to 
alert other nodes about the collision. Then, all the nodes stop transmitting and 
wait a random amount of time before listening to see if the network is clear so 
they can send data again. 
A, C, D. Answer A is incorrect because the network will not crash in the 
event of a collision. Collisions are normal in Ethernet. It is when collisions are 
excessive and the network is unable to function properly that it becomes a 
problem. Answer C is incorrect because sending data on an Ethernet network 
isn't a lottery of who can detect a collision so they can now send data. 
Precedence isn't given to computers who detect a collision. Answer D is incor- 
rect because although computers do listen to see if the cable is clear of traffic, 
collisions can still occur. CSMA/CD minimizes collisions, but it doesn't pre- 
vent them completely.

15. Your network uses a ring topology in which computers are connected to a closed 
loop of cabling. A secondary ring of cabling is also used. If the primary ring of 
cabling has a break, what will happen? 
A. The network will fail. 
B. The secondary ring will be used, but the primary ring won't be used. 
C. The primary ring will be used, but the secondary ring won't be used. 
D. Both rings will be used. 
V'¢I D. Both rings will be used. The primary ring in a FDDI ring topology always 
uses the primary ring. If a break occurs in the ring, then the secondary ring is 
used. The data is passed off the primary ring to the secondary ring, so that it 
continues to loop around the ring topology. 
A, B, C. Answer A is incorrect because the network will not fail. Answers B 
and C are incorrect because the data will be passed off the primary ring to the 
secondary ring, so that a continuous loop still exists.

V¢I D. 190 connections would be needed. The scenario describes a mesh network, 
in which every component of the network is connected to every other com- 
ponent. To determine the number of connections required, the formula 
Ln-n(n-1)/2 would be used, where n is the number of computers.This would 
mean that for a network of twenty computers, the formula would be 20(20- 
1)/2, which equals 190.

1. You are the network administrator of a 10BaseT network. On the weekend, when 
few people are working, you run 110 meters of cable to a new server that is being 
used as a file server. The cable is installed in a new section of the building, where 
no cabling currently exists. When you attempt to access files on the server, they are

experiencing errors and corrupt data. Which of the following is most likely the 
cause of this problem? 
~i~i~i~i~ 
~i~,~
A. Bandwidth 
B. Attenuation

over distance. The scenario states that the cable length is 110 meters, which is 
10 meters longer than the maximum distance for 10BaseT. 
• 1 A, C, D. Answer A is incorrect because bandwidth is a measurement of the 
amount of data that can be passed over a cable in a given amount of time.

building where no other cabling currently exists. Crosstalk occurs when the 
electromagnetic field of one wire interferes with the transmission of another. 
Answer D is incorrect because Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision 
Detection (CSMA/CD) prevents devices from interfering with one another 
during transmission by detecting collisions of data. It is not a cause for data to 
weaken or be corrupt. 
Your company uses UTP cable for all of its network connections including work- 
stations and servers. The users have reported problems connecting to one of the 
most important servers on the network and you have been called in to look at it, 
due to a possible physical security breach by a former employee. While examining 
the server, you find that a small battery-powered motor has been placed and is 
running next to the server's network connection. What is causing the network 
problem? 
A. Electromagnetic interference 
B. Static electricity 
C. Transceivers 
D. Unknown, but the motor is probably unrelated 
!-4I A. Electromagnetic interference (EMI) is a low voltage, low current, high fre- 
quency signal that can interfere with the electronic signals transmitted over 
cabling. The motor is powered by electromagnets whose presence can interfere 
with the flow of electrons along the UTP cable. 
B, C, D. Answer B is incorrect because static electricity may cause damage to 
network cards and other electronics, but will not interfere with network traffic 
on a UTP cable. Answer C is incorrect because transceivers are the portion of 
a network interface that transmits and receives electrical signals across the 
transmission media. It is unlikely that this is a cause of the problem. Answer D 
is incorrect because the small motor is most likely to be the source of this 
interference. Anytime a UTP cable is near electromagnetic interference there 
will be communications problems.

V4I B. Thicknet. Thicknet is a term for cabling used in 10Base5 networks. Thicknet 
coaxial cable can transfer data over longer distances than the 10Base2 Thinnet 
cable, and requires vampire taps to connect to the network interface card with 
the AUI (Adapter Unit Interface) connector. Thicknet is not a common

tions, but only in one direction at a given time. Which of the following transmission 
methods is used? 
A. Simplex 
B. FireWire 
C. Half-Duplex 
D. Full Duplex 
F-----d C. Half-Duplex. 100BaseFX is an Ethernet standard that uses fiber optic 
cabling. It can transmit data at speeds of 100 Mbps, but if communication is 
half-duplex, it can transmit data across cable segments that are up to 400 
meters in length. If full duplex is used, then it can transmit data up to 2 kilo- 
meters. Because data travels both ways on the medium but in only one direc- 
tion at a time, half-duplex is being described. 
A, B, D. Answer A is incorrect because simplex refers to data moving in a 
single direction. Answer B is incorrect because FireWire is a proprietary name 
for IEEE1394, which is an external bus that supports fast data transfer rates of 
400Mbps and 800Mbps. Answer D is incorrect because full duplex refers to 
data traveling in both directions simultaneously.

V¢l A. RJ-45. The illustration shows an RJ-45 connector. This type of connector is 
used in UTP (Unshielded Twisted-Pair) cabling, and commonly used for net- 
......... 
works that use a star topology. An R,J-45 cable has 8 pins and is rectangular is

shape with a plastic lock on one side. 
B, C, D. Answer B is incorrect, because a BNC Barrel connector is round or 
barrel shaped, while a BNC T connector is circular and T-shaped. Neither of 
these types of connectors is used on with UTP. Answer C and D are incorrect, 
because both ST and SC connectors are used with fiber optic cabling.

Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) access 
method. 
A, C, D: FDDI is a technology used to create high-speed backbone connec- 
~ 
tions and uses token passing. It is not an access method. CSMA/CA is pri-

12. You are the network engineer assigned to implement a new 100 Mbps network 
connection.You need to select the correct cabling, as wen as the correct standard. 
From the selections below; choose which 100 Mbps networking standard makes 
use of only two pairs of a Category 5 UTP cable. 
A. lOBaseT 
B. 
100BaseFL 
C. 100BaseTX 
D. 100BroadT4 
V¢I C. 100BaseTX uses two UTP pairs (four wires) in a Category 5 UTP cable. 
A, B, D. Answer A is incorrect because 10BaseT requires Category 3 UTP 
and only operates at 10 Mbps.Answer B is incorrect because 100BaseFL 
doesn't exist, it's really 10BaseFL, and it requires 10 Mbps fiber optic cable. 
Answer D is incorrect because 100BoardT4 is not a legitimate networkin~ 
standard.

Network Devices 
1. Cables from workstations are connected to a central network connectivity device 
that takes data from one port and resends it to all of the other ports. In doing so, 
the data is regenerated so it is as strong as when it was originally sent. Which of 
the following devices is being used? 
A. Active hub 
B. 
Passive hub 
C. Switching hub 
D. 
Switch 
V¢I A. Active hub. An active hub will take data sent to it and resend it to all ports 
on the hub. An active hub also works as a repeater for all data received on its 
ports, as the signal is regenerated before it is transmitted on all ports of the 
hub. 
B, C, D. Answer B is incorrect because the function of a passive hub is simply 
to receive data from one port of the hub and send it out to the other ports. It 
does not regenerate the data. Answers C and D are incorrect because a switch 
or switching hub will take the data sent to it on one port and then send it to a 
specific port that will send the data only to the destination computer or 
device. 
2. Your network consists of a single large LAN that is in a star topology configura- 
tion.You have found that there are a significant number of collisions occurring on 
the network, and want to segment it into two smaller LANs. Which of the fol- 
lowing devices will you use to segment this network, allowing each LAN to com- 
municate with the other? 
A. NIC 
B. 
MAU 
C. Bridge 
D. Repeater 
V¢l C. Bridge.A bridge is a network connectivity device that connects two dif- 
ferent networks and makes them appear to be one network, and allows a larger 
LAN to be segmented into two smaller halves. The bridge filters local traffic 
between the two networks and copies all other traffic to the other side of the 
bridge. 
NI A, B, D.Answer A is incorrect because a NIC is simply a network interface 
card, which is installed on a PC or other network device, to allow it to corn- 

Self Test Appendix 811 
municate on the network. Answer B is incorrect because a MAU is a device 
. . . . . . .  
that multiple workstations are connected to in order to communicate on a 
Token Ring network. Answer D is incorrect because a repeater is used to con- 
nect segments of cable and repeat the data it receives so that it won't weaken 
along the cable.

3. You want to get Internet access for a computer that is used by the IT staff to 
download drivers and updated software from the Internet. Because of the amount 
of data that is going to be downloaded, you want to use the fastest possible method 
of downloading data. Which of the following will you use? 
A. Analog modem with dial-up access to an ISP 
B. ISDN Digital Subscriber Line 
C. Consumer Digital Subscriber Line 
D. Very High Digital Subscriber Line 
[-¢I D. Very High Digital Subscriber Line. A Very High Digital Subscriber Line has 
a downstream speed of 12.9 to 52.8 Mbps, and an upstream speed of 1.5 to 2.3 
!i iii!!il
Mbps. Of the choices offered, this is the fastest choice for accessing the 
Internet. 
.... 
N1 A, B, C. Answer A is incorrect because an analog modem with dial-up access 
is limited to a maximum speed of 56 Kbps. Answer B is incorrect because an 
~li!i iiiii!i ii! !i~ 
ISDN Digital Subscriber Line has a maximum speed of 128 Kbps. Answer D is 
incorrect because a Consumer Digital Subscriber Line has a maximum speed 
of 1 Mbps. 
4. You are looking into purchasing a new switch for your network.You want the 
switch to be able to route packets of data based on the uniform resource locator 
included with the packet. Which switch type should you buy? 
A. Layer 2 Switch 
B. Layer 3 Switch 
C. Layer 4 Switch 
D. Layer 5 Switch 
D. Layer 5 Switch. Layer 5 switches use information from the Session Layer, 
allowing it to route packets using uniform resource locators (URLs). 
N! A, B, C. Answer A is incorrect because Layer 2 Switches work at the Data 
Link Layer, and look at the MAC address of the packet to determine where it 
is to be sent. Answer B is incorrect because Layer 3 switches work at the 
Network Layer of the OSI model, and have an integrated router function that 
allows it to make decisions as to where the data should be sent. Answer D is

5. You have installed new cabling to accommodate a new section of the building that 
is being networked. Once computers are installed, you find that they are unable to 
connect to the network.You believe the problem is that the length of the cabling 
has exceeded the maximum distance allowed.You want to fix the problem with the 
least amount of cost and work. Which of the following will you do? 
A. Remove the cabling and install cable that supports a longer distance. 
B. Install a passive hub to increase the distance that data can travel along the 
cable. 
....... :iiiiiiiii 
~ ............. 
C. Install a NIC to increase the distance that data can travel along the cable. 
D. Install a switch to increase the distance that data can travel along the cable. 
[-4I D. Install a switch to increase the distance that data can travel along the cable. 
Switches can perform the same functions that repeaters used to, by regener- 
ating the data so that it is sent out from the switch at its original strength. 
A, B, C. Answer A is incorrect because removing the cabling and replacing it 
with another kind is not only costly, but a considerable amount of work. 
Answer B is incorrect because a passive hub won't regenerate the data when it 
is sent out from its ports.Answer C is incorrect because a NIC is used as an 
interface to communicate on the network. It isn't used as a means of regener- 
ating data so that the network can be extended. 
6. What will happen if the default gateway is not specified on your computer and 
you are trying to reach another network? 
A. The packet will ask every router if they know the path to reach the destina- 
tion. 
B. The packet will broadcast for the IP address of the nearest router. 
C. The packet will be forwarded to the DNS server. 
D. The packet will not be sent. 
[-4I D. The packet will not be sent. Without that default gateway, you are stuck on 
the local network. The subnet mask, which you will learn about in the next 
chapter, is also very important. Without a properly configured subnet mask to 
a ..... ;-~-" which subnet your computer is on, your computer will be unable 
Lcate outside of the local network.

7. You need to connect two networks that work on two different network protocols. 
Which of the following should be used? 
A. DMZ 
B. Firewall 
C. Gateway 
D. NAS 
V¢I C. Gateway. If two networks work on different communication systems, they 
will not be able to talk to each other. A gateway functions as a translator 
between two dissimilar networks so that both are able to communicate. For 
example, ifyour Ethernet network is to be connected to a Token Ring net- 
iii! 
work, you will need to have a gateway so that hosts in the two networks are 
able to communicate. 
A, B, D. Answer A is incorrect because a DMZ is a neutral network segment 
.............................. , 
where systems accessible to the public Internet are housed, which offers some 
~iii 
basic levels of protection against attacks. Answer B is incorrect because a fire-

IEI A. Replace all 10 Mbps network adapters to 10/100 Mbps in the remaining 
workstations. Since the switch ports are configured to automatically sense the 
network speed, the workstations with 100 Mbps network adapters will com- 
municate with the switch at 100 Mbps and others at 10 Mbps. This will affect 
the overall network speed. In order to have a complete 100 Mbps network, 
you should replace the 10 Mbps adapters with 10/100 Mbps network adapters 
in the remaining workstations. 
B, C, D. Answer B is incorrect because even if the switch ports are configured 
to operate at 100 Mbps, the communication with workstations with 10 Mbps 
adapters will be at 10 Mbps. Answer C is incorrect because 10 Mbps adapters 
cannot be configured to operate at 100 Mbps. Answer D is incorrect because 
answer A is a legitimate solution.

9. You are implementing a firewall for a small company that wishes to establish an 
Internet presence. The company wants to use its dedicated Internet connection to 
allow employees to access the Internet as well as host a Web server. What is the 
best type of firewall to use in this situation? 
A. A packet filtering firewall 
B. A stateful inspection firewall 
C. An application layer gateway 
D. No firewall is necessary 
Answer A is the correct. A packet-filtering firewall will fill the needs of the 
company, cost the least, and perform the fastest without adding unnecessary 
processing overhead that would slow down traffic. 
A stateful inspection firewall (B) would serve the company's needs, but because 
it is a small company and does not plan on allowing incoming connections 
other than to its Web server, the cost is not worth the benefits. An application 
layer gateway (C) would cost more and provide much more functionality than 
the company needs. Both stateful inspection firewalls and application layer 
gateways would slow down the company's Internet connection slightly. Answer 
D is incorrect because any time you have a constant-on Internet connection, 
you need to protect the system that is using that connection. 
10. What is the area of the network that typically contains public DNS servers and 
Web servers? 
A. Firewall 
B. DMZ 
C. VLAN 
D. VPN 
~vw.syngress.con 

Self Test Appendix 815 
V¢I Answer B is correct. The DMZ is typically where publicly accessible DNS 
servers, Web servers, and e-mail servers are found.These servers are protected 
against a large number of attacks by being placed in the DMZ, but can still 
perform their functions. A second firewall is located on the internal side of the 
D MZ to further restrict connection attempts to the intranet. 
~1 Answer A is incorrect, because a firewall device can be used to create a DMZ, 
but is not a network area by itself. Answer C is incorrect, because a VLAN may 
contain publicly accessible servers, but not in most cases.Answer D is incur- 
~iiiiiiiiil 
rect, because a VPN is a secure tunnel created over an insecure medium, such 
~iiill il~ 
as the Internet, that can be used to pass traffic with security and authenticity.

12. To allow its employees remote access to the corporate network, a company has 
implemented a hardware VPN solution. Why is this considered a secure remote 
access solution? 
A. Because only the company's employees will know the address to connect to in 
order to use the VPN. 
B. Because VPNs use the Internet to transfer data. 
C. Because a VPN uses compression to make its data secure. 
D. Because a VPN uses encryption to make its data secure. 
Answer D is the correct answer. A VPN uses encryption to secure the data it is 
tunneling over the Internet. By implementing secure encryption technology, 
VPNs make it very difficult to read what data is being sent between the client 
and the host.

Self Test Appendix 
Restricting the knowledge of which address to access in order to use the VPN 
(A) is not why VPNs are considered secure. This uses the concept of"security 
through obscurity," which rarely works. Using the Internet to transfer data (B) 
is not secure. Many VPNs use compression (C) to make data transfer faster, but 
this does not make it secure.

C. Terminate the connection after a predefined amount of time. 
D. 
Shut down a server or servers. 
V~ Answers B, C, and D are correct. An Active IDS will not only collect data 
about the attack, but it will also seek to prevent damage to the network it is 
protecting. Thus, you might expect an active IDS to disable services, disconnect 
a session, or even shut down servers if required to protect the network from 
compromise. 
Answer A is incorrect, because informing the user that their actions may be 
monitored is not part of the IDSs job. 
14. You have an IDS system running only on one computer in your network. What 
type of IDS system is this? 
A. Active 
B. 
Host 
C. Network 
D. Anomaly 
!---4I Answer B is correct. This is a host-based IDS system, as it is running on only 
one computer. 
Answer A is incorrect, because an Active IDS is one that responds actively to 
attacks against the network or system, which is not part of this question. 
Answer C is incorrect, because a network-based IDS is run from a central 
location and monitors the entire network. Answer D is incorrect, because 
anomalies are used for detecting attacks, not to classify where an IDS is run.

4. What design feature causes an antenna to become an amplification device? 
A. It focuses the RF energy into a smaller beam. 
B. It focuses the P,.F energy into a broad beam. 
C. It is made of a ferrous metal. 
D. It is cylindrical in shape. 
El 
A. Amplification occurs in an antenna due to the fact that an antenna focuses 
the ILF energy into a smaller beam, thus Answer A is correct. Different 
antenna types result in different shapes of the ILF signal output, and thus 
varying amounts of amplification. 
B, C, D. A broader beam would result in a lowering of signal strength, thus 
Answer B is incorrect. While the physical construction of the antenna itself 
may at times play a role in how the output signal will relate to the input signal, 
neither the metal used nor the shape of the antenna are the overriding factors 
that cause antennas to be passive amplification devices, thus Answers C and D 
are incorrect. 
5. In long outdoor links, refraction of lLF signals becomes a problem. Which of the

8. Your supervisor has charged you with determining which 802.11 authentication 
method to use when deploying the new wireless network. Given your knowledge 
of the 802.11 specification, which of the following is the most secure 802.11 
authentication method? 
A. Shared-Key Authentication 
B. EAP-TLS 
C. EAP-MD5 
D. Open Authentication 
~I D. Open authentication is actually more secure than shared key authentication 
because it is not susceptible to a known plaintext attack, to which the shared- 
key authentication method is susceptible. 
lk-1 A, B, C. Shared-key authentication is susceptible to a known plaintext attack if 
the attacker can capture the random challenge sent by the AP to the client, as 
well as the encrypted response from the client. The attacker can then use try to 
brute force the WEP key by trying to decrypt the encrypted response and 
comparing it to the random challenge sent by the AP, thus Answer A is incor- 
rect. EAP-TLS and EAP-MD5 are authentication methods specified in the 
802.1x standard, not the 802.11 standard, thus Answers C and D are incorrect.

9. What are the two WEP key sizes available in 802.11 networks? 
A. 64-bit and 104-bit keys 
B. 24-bit and 64-bit keys 
C. 64-bit and 128-bit keys 
D. 24-bit and 104-bit keys 
C. The 802.11 specification calls for 64-bit keys for use in WEP. Later the 
specification was amended to allow for 128-bit keys as well. 
A, B, D. The actual key size of the secret key is 40-bits and 104-bits. When 
added to the 24-bit initialization vector, you wind up with WEP key sizes of 
64-bits and 128-bits, thus Answers A, B and D are incorrect.

10. Which of the following is a weakness in WEP related to the initialization vector 
(IV)? (Choose all that apply) 
The IV is a static value, which makes it relatively easy for an attacker to brute 
A. 
ili !iil i 
fo rc e the WE P key fro m cap ture d traffic. 
B. 
The IV is transmitted in plaintext and can be easily seen in captured traffic. 
C. The IV is only 24-bits in size which makes it possible that two or more data 
frames will be transmitted with the same IV, thereby resulting in an IV colli- 
sion that an attacker can use to determine information about the network. 
D. There is no weakness in WEP related to the IV. 
Vii B, C. The IV is transmitted in plaintext because the AP or the other adhoc 
participants in the network must know its value in order to be able to recreate 
the WEP key to decrypt traffic. Because of the small size of the IV space 
allows for the potential of IV collisions that an attack can use to XOl< out the 
keystream used to encrypt the traffic and thereby possibly recover information 
such as IP address information from packets. 
..........................................................!ii!i

A, D. The IV is not a static value, it is randomly determined, thus Answer A is 
incorrect. There are weaknesses associated with WEP that are directly

attributable to the short length of the IV as mentioned previously, thus Answer 
D is incorrect.

11. Bill, the network administrator, wishes to deploy a wireless network and use open 
authentication. His problem is that he also wants to make sure that the network is 
........ 
not accessible by anyone. How can he authenticate users without a shared-key 
authentication mechanism (choose the best answer)? 
A. Use MAC address filters to restrict which wireless network cards can associate 
to the network. 
B. Deploy a RADIUS server and require the use of EAP. 
C. Set a WEP key on the access points and use it as the indirect authenticator for 
users. 
D. Use IP filters to restrict access to the wireless network. 
C. Use the WEP key as an indirect authenticator for open networks. Unlike 
shared-key authentication, open authentication does not provide for a chal- 
lenge/response exchange and therefore does not expose the WEP key to a 
known-plaintext cryptographic attack. 
A, B, D. MAC filtering does not absolutely authenticate a user as MAC 
addresses are easily spoofed. Additionally, MAC filtering is an administrative 
burden, thus Answer A is incorrect. Deploying RADIUS server or IP filters are 
both beyond the scope of the question being asked, thus Answers B and D are 
incorrect.

assigned, they are not burned into the card. It should be noted that MAC 
addresses can in fact be changed, although it is highly uncommon to do it, and 
is usually only done with very old cards that may have survived all this time. In 
this case, the old cards may have duplicate numbers, and you may have to 
update the BIA on the card to use it. 
2. Which of the following is a valid MAC address? 
A. 00:05:J6:0D'91:K1 
B. 
10.0.0.1 - 255.255.255.0 
C. 00:05:J6:0D:91:B1 
D. 00:D0:A0:5C:CI:B5 
D. A MAC address consists of six hexadecimal numbers. The highest possible 
hexadecimal number is FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF, which denotes a broadcast. The 
first three bytes contain a manufacturer code and the last three bytes contain a 
unique station ID. Therefore, Answer D is correct.You have to understand hex- 
adecimal in order to be able to solve this, as decimal is basel0, binary is a base2 
system, and hex is basel6. The numbers are counted from 0 to 9, then lettered 
A to F before adding another digit. The letters A through F represent decimal 
numbers 10 through 15, respectively. Since F is the highest, then obviously an 
answer like C is easy to eliminate, as a quick scan of the hex shows a letter 'J' 
used, which is not in the basel6 numbering system.You will learn more about 
the numbering systems in Chapter 6. 
I!t Answer A is incorrect because there is a K, which does not convert to basel6 
math.Answer B is incorrect because 255.255.255.0 is an IP address/subnet 
mask, not a MAC address. Answer C is incorrect because there is a J, which 
does not convert to basel6 math. Remember, it's 0-9, A-F, which, when added 
up, equal 16, hence basel6. A letter G would equal 17, which is not acceptable; 
therefore anything above an F cannot be used.

V------d A. The Data Link layer contains two sublayers, the MAC and LLC sublayers. The 
LLC or Logical Link Control sublayer is responsible for providing the logic for 
the data link, thus it controls the synchronization, flow control, and error 
checking functions of the Data Link layer. The MAC sublayer is responsible for 
providing control for accessing the transmission medium. It is responsible for

17I D. It is very easy to confuse this with other system commands, as they are very 
similar. Windows systems such as NT, 2000, XP and 2003 all use ipconfig to 
get basic IP addressing information. The/all switch adds more information to 
the output seen, such as the physical hardware address, or MAC address; there- 
fore, Answer D is correct. Do not forget that Linux is ifconfig; Windows is 
either winipcfg or ipconfig. 
• 1 Answer A is incorrect because ipconfig/a is not a valid command.Answer B 
is incorrect because ifconfig is not used on Windows systems; it's used on 
Linux systems. The command should also be ifconfig-a, if it was to be used on 
a Linux system to retrieve the MAC address. Answer C is incorrect because 
winipcfg/all is not a command; winipcfg is a GUI interface and does not 
launch with the/a switch. Winipcfg is used on Windows ME and Windows

ii!iii{i!ililji®~::~ii:iiiiiii!iii!i
passing as its method of communicating on the network, therefore, Answer B is ~! 
N 
Answer A is incorrect because direct sequence is not an access method at all. 
Answer C is incorrect because CSMA/CD is used on multiple access networks 
~ 
as defined in the IEEE 802.3 specification. Using this method, devices that 
~~ 
have data to transmit listen for an opening on the line before transmitting 
(Carrier Sense). That is, they wait for a time when there are no signals traveling 
on the cable. When a device detects an opening, it transmits its data. Answer D 
is incorrect because CSMA/CA is a media access protocol that is used on mul- 
tiple access networks such as token passing or wireless topologies. With 
CSMA/CA, a device listens for an opportunity to transmit its data just as 
devices do on CSMA/CD networks. However, when the device senses an 
..... i 
.... i 
opening, it does not immediately transmit the data; instead it transmits a signal 
' 
notifying other devices that it is transmitting (a sort of warning message) 
before actually sending the data. This means data packets will never collide 
(although warning packets may). 
8. Which of the following provides NetBIOS name to IP address resolution? 
A. hosts 
B. lmhosts 
C. services 
D. protocols 
B.The lmhosts file contains NetBIOS name-to-IP address mappings. It is 
stored on local Windows workstations and acts much like a hosts file, but 
instead of working within DNS, the lmhosts fde works with NetBIOS name 
to IP address name resolution. Therefore, Answer B is correct. 
• ! Answer A is incorrect because a host's file contains hostname-to-IP address 
mappings which is not what the question is asking for, it's looking for 
NetBIOS names-to-IP address mappings, therefore A is incorrect, hosts files 
work with DNS. Answer C is incorrect because services has nothing to do 
with name resolution, whether it be DNS or NetBIOS-based. Answer D is

9. Which OSI model layer is responsible for flame sequencing? 
A. The Physical Layer 
B. The Transport Layer 
C. The Data Link Layer 
D. The Application Layer 
C. The Data Link layer combines bits into bytes and bytes into flames, provides 
access to media using MAC addresses, and error detection. Furthermore, it 
provides sequencing of flames. Therefore, Answer C is correct. 
Answer A is incorrect because the physical layer is responsible to move bits 
between devices and specifies voltage, wire speed and pin-out cables. Answer B 
is incorrect because the transport layer provides for both reliable and unreliable 
delivery and error correction at the layer 4 of the OSI. Answer D is incorrect 
because the Application layer is where the user/applications access the net-

C is correct. 
[k-1 Answer A is incorrect because any Web browser (Internet Explorer, etc.) by 
default is not made to be a terminal emulation client like Telnet is. In fact, don't 
get messed up on the Network+ exam, as Netscape cannot be used as terminal 
emulator, but could be with additional software. As an example, Netscape 7.x 
includes cutting-edge add-on applications that help you get more from the 
Internet including Java for running Web applets and many other services and 
features. Don't get hung up on reading into the question - make sure you 
know that terminal emulation is Telnet, no matter what could be added on, or 
taken away as an extra component. Answer B is incorrect because although 
also commonly seen as a command line tool, FTP is a file transfer program, 
made to send and receive files, whereas Telnet was created to perform terminal 
emulation. Answer D is incorrect because NNTP is used for news, not ter-

how the protocol operates so that you can distinguish it from other network 
protocols you may encounter. 
~1 Answer A is incorrect because although you would most likely want to install a 
new network with TCP/IP (which could also lead you into reading the question 
too quickly and providing an incorrect answer), this question asks you to pick 
the best protocol to suit the job, and IPX/SPX does that.Answer G is incorrect 
because AppleTalk does not identify nodes through the use of the MAC address; 
AppleTalk uses a 2 byte network number, a 1 byte node number and a 1 byte 
socket number. Answer D is incorrect, because NetBEUI was originally designed 
for very small, non-routable networks, is broadcast based, is not routable and has 
such low overhead, the addressing is covered by NetBIOS names broadcast to all 
nodes on the network. Remember for the Network+ exam, you will be 
expected to know the differences between the network protocols.

[k-1 Answer A is incorrect because TCP/IP is routable by design, statically as well 
as dynamically. Answer B is incorrect because just like TCP/IE IPX/SPX is 
also routable by design. Answer C is incorrect because AppleTalk is also 
routable. Make sure you review this fact before taking the Network+ exam.

next step you would have to take to connect your network to the Internet? 
A. Purchase, configure, and install a server to act as a firewall for Internet connec- 
tivity.

IEI B.The 192.168.0.0/16 address range is a private Class C network configura- 
tion, therefore Answer B is correct. This can provide up to 256 Class C net- 
works or the 16 bits can be used for host address spaces. In either case, this 
address range is reserved for private use and cannot connect to the Internet, 
nor can it be reached via the Internet.You would need to contact the 
InterNIC for a unique public address assignment. 
Answer A is incorrect because when you have a public network address, you 
should certainly install and configure a firewall to prevent unauthorized net- 
work access via the Internet. However, that is not the first step involved.

Mike's NIC card has no IP address. 
Mike's Ethernet cable is loose. 
D. Although there could be a number of reasons that Mike's computer is 
having trouble connecting to the network, Answer D is the best answer. The 
success of the localhost ping indicates the computer's TCP/IP stack and NIC 
are functioning properly. 
Answer A is incorrect because Mike would not be able to connect to the net- 
work with an invalid IP address. However, since the network is set to use 
DHCP, the IP address automatically assigned to Mike's computer is most likely 
correct and unique, unless Mike changed his computer's settings. Answer B is 
incorrect because unless there was a manufacturer's error or the NIC was pur- 
chased on the black market, each NIC has a unique MAC address and cannot 
be duplicated. This is not the likely cause of the problem. Answer C is incor- 
rect, because the network employs DHCP to dynamically assign IP addresses,

so Mike's computer probably has an IP address. If Mike inadvertently deleted 
the IP address, he may not have an IP address but he'd probably either tell you 
this or he'd reboot before calling you. 1Kebooting would cause his computer to 
request an IP address using the DHCP process. Therefore, this is not the most 
likely cause of the problem.

C. 24 
D.

I-4I B. There are a number of ways to calculate this answer. One way is to start 
with your knowledge that bit 8 (left-most) of the first octet is equal to 128. As 
we move to the left, each bit is twice the value of the one to its right. Thus, 
the string becomes (bit 9 =256), (bit 10 = 512)... (bit 16 = 16,384), (bit 17 = 
32,768). Therefore, we need no fewer than 16 bits for our host address space to 
allow for up to 16,382 addresses per subnet. 
[k-! Answer A is incorrect because eight bits would give us only 254 address spaces 
(128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 256- 2- 254).Answer C is incor- 
rect because 24 bits would allow us far too many host address spaces (224 = 
16,277,214 useable addresses). Answer D is incorrect because 17 bits would 
give us just about double the number we need, 32,766; It's one more bit than

we need. It's more common to take one more network bit than you think you 
need versus taking one more host bit, as it's typically better to have fewer hosts 
on more subnets for faster, more efficient networks. 
8. The company for which you work has three locations in three different states. The 
WAN links are dedicated T1 lines, which are heavily utilized.Your current network 
ID is 166.12.0.0.The subnet mask is 255.255.192.0. Each location has grown sig- 
nificantly over the past three years and the network at each site is slow. Given this 
information, what is the most effective change you could make that would increase 
network speed for all users? 
A. Replace static routers with dynamic routers. 
B. Subdivide each of the three sites into smaller subnets. 
C. Add additional bandwidth between the sites. 
D. Reduce the number of hosts on each subnet. 
B. Subnets can be subnetted again, therefore Answer B is correct. If the 
number of hosts per current subnet is straining the segment's capacity, it should 
be subnetted. Although this can be a cumbersome process (changing IP 
addresses and subnet masks for hosts), it will allow for future expansion. 
[k-! Answer A is incorrect because dynamic routers may make routing more effi- 
cient, but alone will not likely reduce network traffic. Adding routers may help 
alleviate some of the traffic problems, but adding routers typically means 
you've subnetted your network and those subnets require routers in order to 
keep local traffic local. Answer C is incorrect because additional bandwidth 
between the sites might help the speed of WAN communications, but will not 
reduce local network traffic. Answer D is incorrect because reducing the 
number of hosts per subnet is certainly the answer to reducing local traffic, but 
short of removing computers from your network, the only way to reduce the 
number of hosts on the network is to create smaller subnets. Thus, Answer B is 
still the better answer because it effectively reduces the number of hosts on the 
network by creating smaller networks (subnets).

Please work up the network address ranges as soon as possible. I'll get to work on a

1-41 C. 132.12.0.0 is a Class B network ID because it uses the first two octets for 
the network address space and is in the Class B network range of 128.0.y.z to 
191.255.y.z, therefore Answer C is correct.You know you're using the first two

Therefore, your highest network address would b e 132.12.248.0. 
Answer A is incorrect because 132.12.0.0 is your original network ID and 
would be the first network address, not the last. Answer B is incorrect because

~,:.~..:, .........
this network address is within your new range, but is not the highest network 
ID. This network ID has the following configuration in the third octet: 
11100000, putting it near the middle of your address ranges. Answer D is 
incorrect because this network address is not the last. It uses only the four 
high-order bits, so the third octet would be 11110000. This is the second-to- 
last network address. 
10. The company for which you work has three locations in three different states.You

1-4I B. The subnet mask identified how many bits are used for the network address

the following combinations: 00, 01, 10, 11.Therefore, up to four networks 
could be created using this subnet mask, so Answer B is correct.

C. 192.168.1.1 
D. 172.17.1.1 
V¢l A. 11.1.1.1, therefore Answer A is correct. 11.1.1.1 is an IP address that falls in 
the public range of IP addresses. The other answers all fall in the private block 
of IP addresses that are reserved for use within networks and not used at all on 
the public Internet. It's very important to not only remember the difference 
between public and private addresses on the Network+ exam, but to also 
know which IP ranges fall within which class as well as what the default 
subnet mask is for each. Make sure you review this information before exam 
day. 
Answer B is incorrect because 10.0.1.1 falls in the Class A range of private 
addresses: 10.0.0.0- 10.255.255.255.Answer C is incorrect because 
192.168.1.1 falls in the Class C range of private addresses: 
192.168.0.0-192.168.255.255.Answer D is incorrect because 172.17.1.1 falls

12. You are the technician assigned to deploy a Windows Server 2003 server and 20 
Windows XP Professional clients all with default installations.Your DHCP server is 
currently down and all your XP clients are complaining that they cannot surf the 
Internet, whereas 60 minutes ago they could.You see that all your clients currently 
have addresses in the 169.254.xx.xx range. What is most likely the problem? 
A. There is a duplicate DHCP server on the network with a scope in the 
169.254.xx.xx range. 
B. The DHCP server is currently not available so APIPA is used. 
C. You suspect that static addressing was configured without your knowledge. 
D. The 169.254.xx.xx range is automatically configured by a service called 
Zeroconf. 
[-¢I B.APIPA is used, therefore Answer B is correct. The workstation is using an IP 
address in the 169.254.xx.xx range. This is via Microsoft's APIPA, which stands 
for Automatic Private IP Addressing. When the DHCP server is down, APIPA 
• 
olution used. 1Kemember, APIPA must be disabled if you do not 
it, otherwise it's automatically used if a DHCP server is not avail- 
ce requests. 

Self Test Appendix 
845 
Answer A is incorrect because although a common problem on some net- 
works, the 169.254.xx.xx range does specifically point to APIPA in use, there- 
fore this is not likely the problem, and the 169.254.xx.xx range is a privately 
used range and should never be used in a DHCP server scope and leased out. 
Answer C is incorrect because it is not likely that anyone came in and changed 
a dynamic environment into a static one, especially using the APIPA range as 
its static range. Answer D is incorrect because although Zeroconf can help 
with the configuration of systems automatically, it should not be confused with 
i!iii! ...................................................... 
APIPA, which is based on a similar concept, but very specific to the scenario 
we just looked at. If a DHCP server is not available, by default, your 2003

create the subnetted addresses but this is not the number of subnets that result 
from the use of those two bits. 
11. From the list of IP addresses shown, which IP address is a public IP address? 
A. 11.1.1.1 
B. 
10.0.1.1 
C. 192.168.1.1 
D. 172.17.1.1 
V¢l A. 11.1.1.1, therefore Answer A is correct. 11.1.1.1 is an IP address that falls in 
the public range of IP addresses. The other answers all fall in the private block 
of IP addresses that are reserved for use within networks and not used at all on 
the public Internet. It's very important to not only remember the difference 
between public and private addresses on the Network+ exam, but to also 
know which IP ranges fall within which class as well as what the default 
subnet mask is for each. Make sure you review this information before exam 
day. 
Answer B is incorrect because 10.0.1.1 falls in the Class A range of private 
addresses: 10.0.0.0- 10.255.255.255.Answer C is incorrect because 
192.168.1.1 falls in the Class C range of private addresses: 
192.168.0.0-192.168.255.255.Answer D is incorrect because 172.17.1.1 falls 
in the Class B range of private addresses: 172.16.0.0-172.31.255.255. 
12. You are the technician assigned to deploy a Windows Server 2003 server and 20 
Windows XP Professional clients all with default installations.Your DHCP server is 
currently down and all your XP clients are complaining that they cannot surf the 
Internet, whereas 60 minutes ago they could.You see that all your clients currently 
have addresses in the 169.254.xx.xx range. What is most likely the problem? 
A. There is a duplicate DHCP server on the network with a scope in the 
169.254.xx.xx range. 
B. The DHCP server is currently not available so APIPA is used. 
C. You suspect that static addressing was configured without your knowledge. 
D. The 169.254.xx.xx range is automatically configured by a service called 
Zeroconf. 
[-¢I B.APIPA is used, therefore Answer B is correct. The workstation is using an IP 
address in the 169.254.xx.xx range. This is via Microsoft's APIPA, which stands 
for Automatic Private IP Addressing. When the DHCP server is down, APIPA 
• 
olution used. 1Kemember, APIPA must be disabled if you do not 
it, otherwise it's automatically used if a DHCP server is not avail- 
ce requests.

16. You work as a network administrator at your company. The company's local net- 
work includes multiple services and has a permanent connection to the Internet. 
You are concerned about hackers gaining access to the local network from the 
Internet.You decide to implement a firewall and configure it to filter ports 100 
............................................................. 
................................................ 
through 150. Which service might be affected by the firewall? 
................................................. 
A. FTP 
B. NTP 
 
iiiiHiJiiii
D. SMTP 
F{{~igi!i 
B. NTP might be affected, therefore Answer B is correct. NTP operates via 
~ 
lie
UDP port 123. Since you have blocked ports 100 through 150, port 123 will 
~ °  
also be blocked. 
Answer A is incorrect because FTP uses port 21, which is not in the filtered 
range. Answer C is incorrect because HTTP uses port 80, which is not in the 
filtered range.Answer D is incorrect because SMTP uses port 25, which is not 
::::i:i
in the filtered range.You must know all the common ports for the Network+

V4I B. POP3 uses port 110 for communication, therefore Answer B is correct. 
! 
POP3 uses TCP port 110 to receive e-mail from a server to a POP3 client as 
an example. Some questions on the Network+ exam are scenario-based and 
somewhat long, or fairly short and to the point, looking to see if you under- 
stand the concept. 
Answer A is incorrect because port 80 is associated with HTTR Answer C is 
incorrect because port 25 is associated with SMTR Answer D is incorrect 
because port 21 is associated with FTR 
18. Telnet is identified by which TCP/IP port number?

9. You've just upgraded from Windows 2000 Server to Windows Server 2003 
Enterprise Edition.Your client computers are configured to use WINS for 
resolving NetBIOS names on the network. However, users are complaining that 
they can't reach certain resources on the network now. What is the most likely 
cause of the problem? 
A. The Enterprise Edition of Windows Server 2003 no longer supports WINS. 
B. The WINS service is not enabled. 
C. The WINS service can be enabled only on the client side to allow for 
NetBIOS name resolution. 
D. The WINS client must be enabled on client computers first. 
B. By default, the WINS service is not enabled upon installation of Windows 
Server 2003 (or on any edition), therefore Answer B is correct. WINS must be 
enabled before it will work. By default, DNS is used to resolve names in 
Windows Server 2003, but WINS is provided for backward compatibility. 
Answer A is incorrect because the Enterprise Edition of Windows Server 2003 
............ 
...... 
still supports WINS, but does not enable the service by default. Answer C is 
incorrect because the WINS service runs on a computer that will act as a 
name resolver (server). The WINS server function is not enabled on client 
ii ii 
computers.Answer D is incorrect because the WINS client function is auto- 
ii~iiii 
matically installed on the client and does not need to be enabled manually for

D. Have each workstation at both locations use a modem to connect to opposite 
o fl~ c e s. 
C. ISDN provides better speed, connection time, and reliability compared than 
a modem. ISDN can be connected to systems in many ways because of the 
different adapters that can be used with it. ISDN circuits will be terminated on 
a device or within a location, not on a modem, or on individual workstations 
using modems. 
I~1 A, B, D.Answer A is incorrect because ISDN circuits will be terminated on a 
device or within a location, not on a modem, or on individual workstations 
using modems. Answer B is incorrect because ISDN circuits do not terminate 
on workstations.Answer D is incorrect because ISDN circuits will be termi- 
nated on a device or within a location, not on a modem, or on individual

device would you need to implement to use this analog dial-up solution? 
A. CSU/DSU 
B. ISDN adapter 
C. Modem 
D. NIC 
C. A modem is used to connect to the Internet using the local telephone corn- 
paw's telephone lines. 
A, B, D. Answer A is incorrect because a CSU/DSU is a multiplexer gener- 
ally used with T1 access. Answer B is incorrect because an ISDN adapter is 
used for digital service, not analog.Answer D is incorrect because a NIC is 
used for connecting a system to a local area network. 
5. As the Network Manager for rsnetworks.net, you need to implement a solution 
that will allow for sporadic connection to the Internet.Your only requirement is 
that you find a solution that will provide a connection of up to 128 Kbps to the 
Internet, only when needed. Which solution should you implement? 
A. T1

(New York) where the mainframe is located. The mainframe is where all the com- 
pany's sales orders are placed daffy. The hub site is where all sites get their Internet 
access from, and where they upload and download fries to and from. Connection to 
~,,~:,~:::~,~,~:,~,~,:~::~ 
this mainframe 24 hours a day is essential to meeting the business plan.You have just 
heard from your systems engineer that users are no longer able to access the main- 
~{~i~iii~i~ii~i~}~,~,~,~:~{~i~
flame from the remote sites; the users at the core site are still able to access the main-

flame. Within minutes the connection is restored and all users are able to access the 
:~' i::' { iii 
i~ii i: ~i :!iiiiii~iiiiii{i~
mainframe once more. From careful analysis you uncover that during the time that 
,¢~.~,:, ~ •
the remote users were not able to access the mainframe, one user had been down- 
loading a very large file from the Internee to the remote site user's PC.You find that 
............................ !!{!![,:,[,~:,:,:,!

afford this type of network slowdown each day so you decide to allow for the 
upgrading of the fine. It's currently at 128 Kbps using ISDN B1kI.You have found 
that after careful analysis of the remote sites' usage patterns and looking over the doc- 
f 
umentation of the current network an upgrade of about 1.5 Mbps is needed across 
all finks. Which technology would you implement? (Choose one)

A, 13, C. Answer A is incorrect because ADSL is not good for uploading, just 
for downloading, and it is not fast enough to meet the required needs. Answer 
13 is incorrect because an E1 doesn't even apply; this technology is European- 
based and the company is located in the United States. Answer C is incorrect 
because a LAN adapter, which can deliver amazing speeds, is a LAN-based 
technology, not a WAN-based technology, which is what is used to connect 
the remote sites to the core.

8. You are a network administrator at your company.Your company has a number of 
sales and marketing users who work remotely and telecommute from home or 
from sales meetings. These users dial into a R_AS server to access the corporate 
headquarters. One day, one of the sales users dials up the RAS server to connect to 
the corporate headquarters network to access a few files. The sales user dials up the 
R_AS server and cannot connect. The sales user when asked reports that there is no 
dial tone. What is the cause of the problem? (Choose one) 
A. Telephone company problem 
B. The modem does not support the PC 
C. The modem settings are set incorrectly. 
D. There are no settings configured within Windows 
A. If there is no dial tone on the line, you will not be able to dial out to the 
RAS server to connect to your corporate network. For the network+ exam 
you will be expected to troubleshoot many scenarios so make sure you read 
them very carefully.. 
B, C, D. Answer B is incorrect because neither the modem nor the PC is the 
problem; the problem is with the carrier. There is no dial tone, therefore you 
will not be able to dial out. Answer C is incorrect because the modem settings 
are not the root cause of the problem. Answer D is incorrect because the 
Windows Operating system is installed on a PC, which has nothing to do with 
the absence of dial tone. 
9. You are the network technician at your company.You are configuring a Windows 
NT 4.0 laptop for dial-up networking. The laptop will be used by a telecommuter. 
The telecommuter will use the laptop to dial into a Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 
Remote Access Service (R.AS) server. Once connected, the telecommuter will 
need access to a UNIX machine. 

What should you install on the laptop? (Choose two.) 
A. TCP/IP Protocol 
B. 
RDP 
Self Test Appendix ~853 
C. VPN 
D. Dial-Up Networking 
V¢I A and D.You will need to have dial-up networking and the TCP/IP protocol 
installed on your Windows system to dial into a Windows NY 4.0 R_AS server. 
~'i B and C. Answer B is incorrect because RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) it 
not needed for connectivity to a RAS server. RDP is used to make connec- 
tions to remote hosts. Answer C is incorrect because a VPN is a secure net- 
work created over an insecure one (namely the Internet). 
10. You are a consultant looking over network documentation for a small company 
with one core site and two remote sites. Router A shows the location of the cor- 
porate headquarters where there is also a link out for Internet access and another

14. You are configuring your home PC to connect to your company's Windows 
Server 2003 1KRAS server.Your home PC has two modems installed in it, and you 
would like to be able to use both of these modems to increase the performance of 
your remote access connection. What feature must your IKRAS server support in 
order for this to happen? 
A. Callback 
B. 
Caller ID 
C. Multi-link 
D. Virtual private networking 
V'------d C. Multi-link is a feature in remote access servers that will allow a client to use 
more than one modem to increase the bandwidth of their connection. 
Therefore, Answer C is correct. 
A, B, D. The callback feature will cause a remote access server to automatically 
disconnect when a client dials in, and then call that client back at a specified 
number. This feature will not allow you to use more than one modem to 
create a connection. Therefore, Answer A is incorrect. Caller ID is used by 
remote access servers to only allow connections from a specific list of 
incoming phone numbers. Therefore, Answer B is incorrect. Virtual private 
networking creates a secure tunnel over an existing public connection such as 
the Internet. Therefore, Answer D is incorrect.

1. You are the network administrator for a financial services company.Your company 
has a single Web server that contains an intranet that is accessed by internal 
employees while also providing information to the general public.You would like 
to secure access to this Web server without preventing the necessary users from 
accessing it. What is the best way to do this? 
A. Install a single firewall. Place the Web server on your company's internal net- 
work. 
B. Install a single firewall. Place the Web server outside the firewall with a direct

V----d D. The most appropriate firewall configuration for this Web server would be a 
DMZ. In a DMZ, the Web server is located between two firewallsman 
external firewall to protect the Web server against malicious outsiders and a 
firewall between the Web server and the internal network to protect internal 
network resources. Therefore, Answer D is correct. 
} 
~-1 A, B, D. Although installing a single firewall and placing the Web server on 
your company's internal network will protect the Web server to an extent, it 
does not provide the best level of protection, since you need to allow outside 
users access to your internal network through the firewall. Therefore, Answer A 
is incorrect. Placing the Web server outside a single firewall will protect your 
internal network from malicious outsiders, but it does nothing to protect the 
Web server itself from attack. Therefore, Answer B is incorrect. Using only a 
proxy server would not be appropriate in this scenario, since a proxy server by 
itself would not provide the protection against network attacks that a firewall 
would. Therefore, Answer C is incorrect.

A, B, D. IP version 4 allows for three private IP address ranges. These private 
addresses are not routable and can be used without registering them with an 
Internet registrar. The Class C private address range is 192.168.1.0/24. 
Therefore, Answer A is correct.The Class A private address range is 10.0.0.0/8. 
Therefore, Answer B is correct. The Class B private address range is 
172.16.0.0/16. Therefore, Answer D is correct. 
C, E.The range 66.195.34.0 is a public IP address range that must be regis- 
tered with an Internet registrar and is probably already owned by another cor- 
poration, so your company cannot use it. Therefore, Answer C is incorrect. The 
range 127.0.0.0/8 is the loopback range that is reserved for TCP/IP trou- 
bleshooting, diagnostics, and testing. Therefore, Answer E is incorrect.

C. Create a firewall rule that allows only TCP port 53 to reach the DNS server. 
D. Create a firewall rule that allows only TCP port 443 to reach the DNS server. 
A, C. HTTP traffic uses TCP port 80, and SSL traffic uses TCP port 443. 
These two ports should be enabled to allow outside users to reach both secure 
and nonsecure Web pages on your company's Web server. Therefore, Answer A 
is correct. DNS uses TCP port 53. This port should be enabled to allow out- 
side users to perform DNS queries against your company's DNS server. 
Therefore, Answer C is correct. 
B, D. HTTP traffic uses TCP port 80, but TCP port 110 is used by the POP3 
protocol. With this configuration, users would not be able to access SSL- 
encrypted resources on your Web server. Therefore, Answer B is incorrect. 
DNS uses TCP port 53, not 443. In this configuration, users would not be able 
to perform DNS queries against your company's DNS server. Therefore, 
Answer D is incorrect. 
4. 
Different firewall implementations operate at different layers of the OSI model. 
Match the firewall implementation with the layer of the OSI model at which 
it operates. (Choose two.) 
A. Circuit-level firewall: Application layer 
B. Stateful inspection packet filter: Transport layer 
C. Circuit-level firewall: Transport layer 
D. Stateful inspection packet filter: Network layer 
A, B. Circuit-level firewalls perform an in-depth scan of incoming network 
packets at the application layer to look for harmful or malicious content. 
Therefore, Answer A is correct. Packet-filtering firewalls, both stateful and oth- 
erwise, base their decisions on the TCP or UDP port being used, which oper- 
~o~ ~ ~ho -:ansport layer. Therefore, Answer B is correct.

page being requested. Therefore, Answer A is incorrect. Packet redirection is 
used to direct external user requests to a Web server or other computer located 
i 
inside a proxy server-protected network. This feature does not filter content 
requested by internal users. Therefore, Answer B is incorrect. Content caching

users. Therefore, Answer B is correct. 
A, C, D. Packet filtering is a function of a firewall device, not a proxy server. 
Therefore, Answer A is incorrect. Installing a local copy of the inventory 
database at each site would be inefficient and would lead to inconsistent data. 
Therefore, Answer C is incorrect. Disabling antivirus software on the proxy 
server would leave the server vulnerable to virus infections and would not 
improve the speed with which the server could retrieve Web pages over a slow

network. What methods are available for you to assign VLAN membership to the 
computers on your network? (Select all that apply.) 
A. Port number 
B. MAC address 
C. IP address 
D. 802.1q 
I-¢I 
A, B, D.You can assign VLAN membership based on the switch port that a 
particular client is plugged into. Therefore, Answer A is correct.You can assign 
VLAN membership based on the MAC address assigned to the NIC installed 
in a particular computer. Therefore, Answer B is correct. The 802.1q method 
inserts a "tag" in the TCP/IP frame at the data link layer, indicating which 
VLAN the packet should be sent to. Therefore, Answer D is correct. 
C. VLANs are functions of switches, which operate at Layer 2 of the OSI 
model. IP addresses are a function of the network layer, which is Layer 3. 
Therefore, you cannot assign VLAN membership based on IP addresses, so 
Answer C is incorrect. 
11. You are the network administrator for a large financial services company.Your 
accounting department relies on a mission-critical financial application that uses 
TCP/IP broadcast packets to send notifications to users of the application when 
they receive information that they should be aware of. This wasn't a problem when 
the company was small and contained only a few dozen workstations, but with 
hundreds of machines on the same network, you have begun to receive complaints 
that network performance is unacceptably slow. How can you improve perfor- 
mance for the users on your network while allowing members of the accounting 
department to continue to use their mission-critical application? (Each choice rep- 
resents a complete solution. Choose two.) 
A. Decrease the available bandwidth on your LAN. 
B. Configure a VLAN for the computers in the accounting department. 
C. Place the computers in the accounting department on a separate subnet. 
D. Install an intranet to allow the accounting department to use the application.

B, C. Configuring a separate VLAN for the accounting department will 
restrict the broadcast traffic from the accounting application to only the com- 
puters in that department. Therefore, Answer B is correct.You can also reduce 
the impact of broadcast traffic by separating your network into different sub- 
roadcast traffic does not pass beyond a router. Therefore, Answer C

A, C, D. Granting a logon to each government researcher would be tedious 
and would grant the researchers more access to your internal network 
resources than is necessary for this situation. Therefore, Answer A is incorrect. 
An intranet is used to create a centralized display of information for your 
internal employees, including human resources information and interdepart- 
mental data. It is not used to grant access to external users such as customers 
or business partners. Therefore, Answer C is incorrect. Creating a VPN would 
grant more access to the government once than is required in this situation, 
since the researchers only need access to data pertaining to specific projects. 
Therefore, Answer D is incorrect.

A. Use IPSec to protect Web connections to the extranet server. 
B. Use SSL to protect Web connections to the extranet server. 
C. Use a firewall to protect Web connections to the extranet server. 
D. Use a proxy server to protect Web connections to the extranet server. 
I-4I B. To encrypt Web traffic, you should use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) tech- 
nology, which uses TCP port 443. Therefore, Answer B is correct. 
A, C, 13. IPSec is used to create VPNs, not to protect Web browser data. 
Therefore, Answer A is incorrect. Although a firewall can make packet-filtering 
decisions as to which traffic should and should not reach your extranet server, 
it cannot encrypt data that's being sent to your customers' Web browsers. 
Therefore, Answer C is incorrect. A proxy server is used to make requests for 
Web pages on behalf of internal network clients, but it does not encrypt any 
traffic being sent from an extranet Web server. Therefore, Answer D is incor- 
rect. 
15. You are the network administrator for a small law firm that is in the process of 
being acquired by a larger firm in the same city. During the acquisition process, all 
your network data needs to be accessible by the larger firm so that both firms can 
begin the process of transitioning information to the larger firm's servers. Both 
firms are connected to the Internet via high-speed T1 links. Each firm's data needs 

Self Test Appendix 
873 
to remain secure while being accessed by the other firm's users. What is the best 
way to provide this type of access between the two company networks? 
A. Create a filtering rule on each firewall that allows each firm's public IP address 
.........

to go through the firewall. 
B. 
Create an extranet that will allow each firm to view the other firm's data using

allow the two offices to securely access each other's data. Therefore, Answer D 
is correct. 
A, B, C. "Poking a hole" in the firewan win reduce the security of each indi- 
vidual network and will not secure any data that is transmitted between the 
i
two.Therefore, Answer A is incorrect.An extranet would not be applicable for 
ili
this situation, since the two firms need to directly access each other's servers 
and data processes to prepare for the acquisition process. Therefore, Answer B is 
incorrect. Placing the firms' servers into a demilitarized zone would leave them 
open to attack by malicious outsiders, since they would be accessible via a 
public IP address on the Internet. Therefore, Answer C is incorrect. 
16. You are a consultant who has been contracted by a small company to set up its 
network. The owner of the company has purchased a copy of a popular antivirus 
program for each workstation on the network. After you have installed the 
..... 
antivirus software on each computer, what is the most important thing to con- 
figure ? 
{

A. Configure the software to e-mail an administrator whenever it encounters a 
virus. 
B.

regular basis. 
C. Configure the software to scan a file only when a user double-clicks on it. 
D. Configure the software to immediately delete any virus-infected files that it 
finds. 
V------d B. Antivirus software needs to be regularly updated with the most recent 
antivirus definition files so that it can recognize new viruses that have been 
created.Therefore, Answer B is correct,

antivirus definition updates to ensure that antivirus software is as effective as 
possible. Therefore, Answer A is incorrect. Antivirus software should use real- 
time protection to scan all files on a user's hard drive, regardless of whether the 
user is actively using the file or not. Therefore, Answer C is incorrect. When 
antivirus software encounters a virus-infected file, it should first attempt to 
repair the file and remove the virus to try to prevent data loss for the user. 
Deleting the file immediately does not meet this aim. Therefore, Answer D is 
incorrect. 
17. You are working on the network help desk for a financial services company.You 
receive a phone call from a user who complains that her computer is acting 
strangely, rebooting at random intervals and crashing with the Blue Screen of 
Death. As you attempt to figure out how this occurred, she tells you that she 
recently received an e-mail from a friend that contained an attachment that ran a 
cute Snowman Bowling game. What do you suspect is the most likely cause of her 
problem? 
A. The driver for her network card has become corrupted. 
B. Her computer has been infected with a Trojan horse. 
C. She has disabled her personal firewall software. 
D. Her computer is configured with an incorrect IP address. 
B. A Trojan horse is a type of virus that piggy-backs on top of a legitimate- 
looking program to infect a target machine. This user's computer was likely 
infected with a Trojan horse when she opened the Snowman Bowling attach- 
ment. Therefore, Answer B is correct. 
A, C, D.Although a corrupted NIC driver can sometimes cause operating 
system instability, it is far more likely that this user's computer has been 
infected with a virus due to downloading an infected e-mail attachment. 
Therefore, Answer A is incorrect. Disabling personal firewall software will not 
in and of itself cause a computer to experience system failures. Therefore, 
Answer C is incorrect. Configuring a computer with an incorrect IP address 
will cause connectivity issues in reaching network resources, not system insta- 
bility and crashes. Therefore, Answer D is incorrect. 
18. You are the junior network administrator for a small publishing company. The 
senior network administrator is on vacation, and you receive a support call from 
the CEO of the company. The CEO has received an e-mail from a trusted friend 
that is advising him to delete certain system files on his computer that indicate a 
virus infection and to forward the e-mail to everyone in his address book so that 
they can be protected as well.Your network uses an enterprise antivirus solution 
ww.syngress.con 

Self Test Appendix

that automatically pushes out new antivirus updates to all network computers 
every day. What advice would you give the CEO in this situation? 
A. The e-mail is legitimate and his PC is infected. He should delete the files men- 
..... 
ti•ned in the e-mail right away. 
B. The e-mail is legitimate and his PC might be infected. He should copy the files 
..................................................
mentioned in the e-mail to a network share so that you can scan them for 
viruses. 
C. The e-mail is a virus "hoax" that is trying to "con" the CEO into deleting

i i ~ 
V-'-'-'d C. This is a common example of a virus hoax that is sent by (usually well- 
meaning) people through e-mail. The malicious purpose of a virus hoax is to 
convince an unknowing computer user to delete important system files from 
his or her PC. Therefore, Answer C is correct. 
A, B, D. This type of e-mail is indicative of a virus hoax; the CEO's PC is not 
virus-infected, and he should not delete the files referenced in the e-mail. 
Therefore, Answer A is incorrect. If the CEO's PC is virus-infected, you should 
run a virus scan on his local computer, not copy potentially infected files to a 
shared location where they might be able to infect other computers on your 
network.Therefore, Answer B is incorrect. Virus hoaxes don't usually contain 
iiilii i:iii 
i!i!!
viruses themselves; rather, they are designed to frighten unknowing computer 
users into deleting important files from their hard drives. Therefore, Answer D 
is incorrect.

A. Install an ISDN line between Manhattan and Brooklyn, which can be used if 
the T1 line goes down. 
B. Install an ISDN line between Manhattan and Queens, which can be used if the 
T1 line goes down. 
C. Install an ISDN line between Brooklyn and Queens. 
D. Install a T1 connection between Brooklyn and Queens. 
[-----d C. Install an ISDN line between Brooklyn and Queens. Under the current 
configuration, Brooklyn can communicate with Queens (and vice versa) using 
their mutual connections with Manhattan. By installing an ISDN line between 
Brooklyn and Queens, the three can continue to communicate with one 
another if either of the T1 lines goes down. 
A, B, D. Answer A is incorrect because if the T1 line goes down between 
Manhattan and Queens, then Queens will be separated from the network. 
Implementing the ISDN line between Manhattan and Brooklyn will only pro- 
vide fault tolerance between these two sites. Answer B is incorrect for similar 
reasons. If the T1 line goes down between Manhattan and Brooklyn, then 
Brooklyn will be separated from the network. Implementing the ISDN line 
between Manhattan and Queens will only provide fault tolerance between 
these two sites. Answer D is incorrect because the scenario states that cost is a 
concern. Installing an ISDN line between Queens and Brooklyn is cheaper

2. You currently use RAID for fault tolerance on a server, so that data from one disk 
~
is copied to another. When data is written to one disk, it is duplicated on another 
disk in the set.You are concerned that if the disk controller fails, then neither of 
i 
the disks will be able to be accessed. Which of the following will you do to

A, B, D. Answer A is incorrect because implementing RAID 0 (disk striping) 
would actually remove fault tolerance from the current system. Answer B is 
incorrect because the question indicates that mirroring is already being used. 
Answer D is incorrect because disk striping with parity is RAID 5. 
3. You have decided to implement a RAID for fault tolerance, and want data to be 
!!}!!~
striped across multiple disks with parity information stored on multiple drives. 
....... 
..... 
Which of the following levels of RAID will you use? 
A. RAID 0 
B. RAID 1 
.............. 
C. RAID 3 
D. RAID 5 
D. RAID 5. RAID 5 is disk striping with parity. Data is striped across multiple 
disks, but parity information is stored across multiple drives. It provides fault 
tolerance because a single disk that fails in the set can be restored from the 
parity information on the other disks. 
A, B, C. Answer A is incorrect because RAID 0 provides no fault tolerance. 
Data is written (striped) across multiple disks, but no copies of the data are 
made. This improves performance because data is read from multiple disks, but 
the data on the entire set will be lost if one disk fails. Answer B is incorrect 
because RAID 1 is disk mirroring or duplexing. Data that's written to one disk 
is also written to another, so that one disk's data is a mirror image of the 
other's. Parity information is not stored on multiple drives with this method.

Answer C is incorrect because RAID 3 has data striped across several drives, 
but one drive is used to store the parity bits for each byte that's written to the 
other disks. When a disk fails, it can be replaced and data can be restored to it 
from the parity information.

[k-1 A, C, D. Answer A is incorrect because ipconfig isn't used on Linux com- 
puters; ifconfig is. ipconfig is a more commonly used version of the ifconfig 
utility that runs on Windows operating systems. Answer C is incorrect because 
System Information is a utility that is available on Windows-based computers. 
Answer D is incorrect because although winipcfg provides this information, it 
isn't available on Linux. It is used on computers running Windows 95, 
Windows 98 or Windows ME operating systems. 
5. You believe that someone has been attempting to hack into a Windows 2000 
Server on your network by guessing the Administrator password.You set up 
auditing of this account, and then check Event Viewer each morning to view logs 
on this server. Which log would you use to view information about valid and 
invalid logon attempts using this account? 
A. Application Log 
B. 
Security Log 
C. System Log 
D. None. Event Viewer isn't used to view logs. 
17I B. Security Log. The Security log displays possible security issues that the 
operating system monitors. This includes valid and invalid logon attempts, and 
other actions related to security. 

Self Test Appendix 
879 
A, C, D. Answer A is incorrect because the application log contains events 
that are logged by individual programs or applications installed on the oper- 
ating system.Answer C is incorrect because the system log displays events 
logged by the system components of the operating system. Answer D is incor- 
rect because Event Viewer is a tool that is used to view logs. 
6. You are concerned about the impact of various risks to your company.You have 
................................................................................................. 
learned from your insurance company that businesses that can be infected with a 
~{iii!!iiiii i ii

~$1~i~ii~i~i~i
that an average of two viruses a year may infect a system with security comparable 
~li!iiii!i'~ii~'i"iii
~®~
to yours. If you consider that an hour of downtime costs your company $1000, 
~i! 
what would the Annual Loss Expectancy of this risk be to your company? 
..........................................................................
A. $1000 
B. $2000 
~'~i~:~!~,iii'i'~ii!'~i!ii
C. $3000 
D. $4000 
i
V¢I B. $2000. Calculating the Annual Loss Expectency (ALE) uses the formula 
i 
ALE=AgO x SLE. In this case we know that a single incident would cost the 
company $1000 for 1 hour of downtime. This gives us the Single Loss 
Expectancy (SLE). The Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO) for this inci- 
dent is 2 incidents per year.Therefore by multiplying the SLE (1 x $1000) by 
i® 
the ARO (2), we get $2000. 
~iii:iii"i~i:~i~ii~',iii~ili~'ii~i:i:i~iii:!i~i

..... 
A, C, D.Answer A is incorrect, because $1000 is the Single Loss Expectancy 
of the risk.Answer C and D are incorrect, because the correct answer of using 
the formula ALE -ARO (2) x SLE ($1000) is $2000.

7. An intruder has gained access to your website through a service on the server, and 
damaged a number of fries needed by the company. The service isn't necessary to 
the Web server's functionality, and as near as you can tell isn't used by any software 
or users of the company. This Web server is used to provide a presence for the 
company on the Internet, and is used for public relations as well as to provide 
information on the company's products. During the intrusion, you were working 
on upgrading a router in another part of the building, which is why you didn't 
notice audit notifications sent to your e-mail address. These audit notifications 
could have tipped you off about suspicious activity on the server, but now that 
you're aware of the problem, you're concerned that a repeat attack may occur 
while you're fixing the problem. Which of the following actions will you immedi- 
ately take in resolving this situation?

A. Recover data files that were damaged in the attack. 
B. Continue upgrading the router so that you can focus on audit notifications 
that may occur. 
C. Remove the unneeded services running on the server. 
D. Remove the Web server from the Internet until there is no further risk of 
being hacked. 
V4I C. Remove the unneeded services running on the server. The service is a vul- 
nerability to the Web server. Since the attack was made possible through this 
service, removing it eliminates the method of entry into the system. Once 
you've identified vulnerabilities, you should remove or deal with these weak- 
nesses as soon as possible. Failing to do so could leave your system open to 
repeat attacks, or make damage caused by disasters more significant. 
A, B, D. Answer A is incorrect because recovering the data files that were 
damaged won't prevent a repeat attack. Any files that were damaged can be 
restored from backups after you've secured the server. Answer B is incorrect 
because the router upgrade is unimportant to the situation of securing the 
Web server. Answer D is incorrect because the risk of being hacked will always 
exist, unless you permanently take down your website. Since you know the 
vulnerability, removing the service from the server will prevent future attacks 
in the same manner. 
8. During a disaster, you don't want to spend a significant amount of time restoring a 
series of tapes from previous backups of production servers. At the same time, you 
don't want backups to take a significantly long period of time to perform each 
night. Currently, you back up all data on the servers once a week, and then each 
night you perform a backup of data that has changed during the day. To make it 
faster to restore data in a disaster, you're willing to change the current backup plan. 
Based on these factors, which of the following backup plans would you use? 
A. Perform a full backup each night of the servers. This will mean that only one 
tape will be needed per server to restore all the current data. 
B. Perform full backups weekly and incremental backups each night afterwards of 
the servers. 
C. Perform copy backups nightly. This will mean that only one tape will be 
needed per server to restore all the current data. 
D. Perform a full backup weekly and differential backups each night afterward. 
V------d D. Perform a full backup weekly and differential backups each night afterward. 
kup will back up everything on the server, and change the archive 
file to show it was backed up. The differential backup will back up 

Self Test Appendix

all data that has changed since the last full backup, but won't change the 
archive bit. Therefore, when you restore the backups, only the tape with the 
full backup and the tape with the last differential backup are needed to restore 
all the data. 
.............. 
A, B C. Answer A is incorrect because the scenario states that you don't want 
nightly backups to take significantly longer to perform. Full and copy backups 
take the longest to perform because they back up everything. Answer B is 
incorrect because this describes the current backup plan. Answer C is incorrect 
for the same reason that A is incorrect. Copy backups take longer to perform 
,iiiiiiu,iiiiii,,,ii!iiEi®yiii~!~i~i~i~,~

because all data on the server is backed up, just like a full backup. The differ-

9. You are the administrator of a network that is spread between a main building and 
a remote site several miles away.You make regular backups of the data on servers, 
which are centrally located in the main building. Where should you store the 
backup tapes so they are available when needed in the case of a disaster? Choose all 
that apply. 
A. Keep the backup tapes in the server room within the main building so they are 
readily at hand. If a disaster occurs, you will be able to obtain these tapes 
quickly, and restore the data to servers,

B. Keep the backup tapes in another section of the main building, so they are 
....... ...... 
readily at hand. 
C. Keep the backup tapes in the remote site. 
D. Keep the backup tapes with a firm that provides offsite storage facilities. 
V4I C and D. Keep the backup tapes in the remote site, or with a firm that pro- 
vides offsite storage facilities. Since the company has a remote location that is 
miles from the main building, the tapes can be kept there for safekeeping. A 
firm can also be hired to keep the tapes in a storage facility. When a disaster 
occurs, you can then retrieve these tapes and restore the data. 
I~1 A and B. Answer A and B are incorrect, because a disaster that effects the 
server room or main building could also destroy the backup tapes if they were 
stored in these locations.

A. Cold site 
B. Warm site 
C. Hot site 
D. Hot spare 
IEI C. Hot site. A hot site takes the least amount of work to set up, as it is online 
and part of the production network. A copy of the data may be stored on a 
server at that location so that minimal setup is required to resume operations. 
A, B, D. Answer A is incorrect because a cold site is neither online nor part of 
the production network. It may have all or part of the necessary equipment 
and resources needed to resume business activities, but installation is required 
and data has to be restored to servers. Answer B is incorrect because a warm 
site only has part of the necessary equipment, software, and other requirements 
to resume normal business operations. Answer D is incorrect because a hot 
spare is equipment and not a facility.

11. You are setting up a series of servers that can be used in case one of the produc- 
tion servers fails. Each of the servers is identical to its counterparts on the produc- 
tion network. If one of the servers fails at this site, a replacement server can simply 
be powered up and run on the network. What type of equipment is this? 
A. Cold spare 
B. 
Hot spare 
C. Cold site 
D. Hot site 
[-¢I B. Hot spare. Hot spares are replacement devices that are running and can be 
used as soon as a problem occurs. If the current system fails, the hot spare can 
be used with little to no work on the part of the network administrator. 
A, C, D. Answer A is incorrect because cold spares are not fully configured 
and require setup and possibly installation of software before they can be used 
on a production network. Answers C and D are incorrect because neither hot 
sites nor cold sites are redundant or replacement equipment. They are facilities 
that can be used in a disaster.

A and D. Answer A is incorrect because while disk striping may provide 
!~,:~
improvements in the performance of reading and writing to a hard disk, it does 
not improve performance or provide fault tolerance to services running on a 
network's servers.Answer D is incorrect because hot spares are used to replace

equipment when it fails. They do not improve performance. 
13. You have four nodes that are part of a cluster. The nodes listening for heartbeats 
fail to detect this signal from one of the other nodes. Which of the following will 
happen? 
A. The node that isn't sending the heartbeat will be considered available. 
B. The other nodes in the cluster will begin providing services that were offered 
iiiii
by the node that is no longer sending the heartbeat. 
C. The cluster will fail and notification will be sent to other computers on the 
n e two rk. 
D. The cluster will appear as a single server on the network, so users don't recog- 
nize that a failure has occurred. 
....................................... 
B. The other nodes in the cluster will begin providing services that were 
offered by the computer that is no longer sending the heartbeat. The nodes 
(computers) in a cluster communicate with one another by sending out mes- 
sages called heartbeats. If the computers in a cluster fail to detect the heartbeat 
of one of the other computers, they consider that computer to be unavailable. 
At this point, a failover occurs, where the resources of the failed computer are 
taken offline and another computer begins providing its services. 
A, C, D. Answer A is incorrect because when a computer no longer sends out 
a heartbeat signal to other computers in the cluster, that computer is consid- 
ered unavailable. Answer C is incorrect because a cluster provides fault toler- 
ance, so services won't become unavailable if one of the ~ 
cluster fails. Answer D is incorrect because a cluster of cc 
appear as a single server on the network.

C. On a Windows 95 or Windows 98 PC, winipcfg will show you a graphical 
interface that gives you at-a-glance access to the IP address, subnet mask, and 
default gateway of the Windows client. Therefore, Answer C is correct. 
lk-1 A, B, D. route print will show the contents of the routing table for a 
Windows-based PC; it does not provide an easy way to see the IP address, 
subnet mask and default gateway that are assigned to it. Therefore, Answer A is 
incorrect, tracert is used to test the route between a source and a destination 
PC, to determine if any hops along the way are overloaded or failing. 
Therefore, Answer B is incorrect, netstat shows the active Ethernet connections 
on a particular PC, but not the IP configuration of that PC. Therefore, Answer 
D is incorrect. 
2. You are the network administrator for your company.Your predecessor configured 
a Netware 4.1 server to provide file and print services for your Windows 2000 and 
XP clients.You need to determine the frame type that the Netware server uses to 
communicate over IPX/SPX so that you can configure a new client to connect to 
the server. How can you determine what frame type is in use on your network? 
A. Type ipxroute config from a client that can successfully connect to the 
Netware server. 
B. Type netstat from a client that can successfully connect to the Netware server. 
C. Type route print from a client that can successfully connect to the Netware 
server. 
D. Ping the IP address of the Netware server from a client that can successfully 
connect to the Netware server.

puter, including refreshing the entries from the LMHOSTS file. If you need to 
quickly update a computer's NetBIOS information, this is the utility to use. 
Therefore, Answer B is correct. 
A, C, D. Rebooting the workstation would refresh the entries in the 
............................................................................................... 
LMHOSTS file, but would unnecessarily disrupt the user's work. Therefore, 
Answer A is incorrect. Logging the user out of their workstation would not 
refresh the entries in the LMHOSTS file, as well as unnecessarily disrupting 
the user's work. Therefore, Answer C is incorrect. Using ipconfig by itself will 
not update any information, it will only display the current IP configuration of 
the computer. Therefore, Answer D is incorrect.

A, B, D.You'll use a standard Ethernet cable to connect a computer to a hub, 
switch, or a router, not directly to another PC.Therefore, Answer A is incor- 
rect.You'll use a cable tester to determine if a length of Ethernet cable is func- 
tioning properly or if it has experienced any type of short or break. Therefore,

A. The operating system has crashed and the server should be rebooted. 
B. The network cable connecting the server to its hub is damaged and should be 
replaced. 
C. The NIC installed in the server is damaged and should be repaired or replaced. 
D. The NIC installed in the server should be configured for full duplex opera- 
tions. 
[-¢I C.An amber LED light indicates that a device (in this case a NIC) has begun 
to malfunction, and should be repaired or replaced. Therefore, Answer C is cor- 
rect. 
A, B, D. If the operating system had crashed, you would have seen an error on 
the server desktop like the "Blue Screen of Death". Since the server desktop is 
responsive, this is not the cause of the problem. Therefore, Answer B is incor- 
rect.An amber LED light on the NIC means that the NIC is physically mal- 
functioning, so changing the duplex mode of the card will not correct this 
issue. Therefore, Answer D is incorrect.

10. You are the new network administrator for a Windows network. As part of your 
administrative duties, you are responsible for maintaining your company's telephone 
and PBX systems.Your company has recently purchased the office building adja- 
cent to the current facility to allow for expansion. There are a number of tele- 
phone jacks in the new facility that are not listed on any network diagrams, and 
you need to determine if they are functional. Which tool should you use to deter- 
mine this? 
A. Null model cable 
B. Tone generator 
C. Oscilloscope 
D. Crossover cable 
B. A tone generator is a device that can perform diagnostics on telephone 
equipment, including determining if a telephone jack is receiving any signal. 
Therefore, Answer B is correct. 
I~ A, C, D. A null model cable is used to connect a computer's serial cable to a 
device such as a router in order to configure or troubleshoot the device 
without using a network connection. Therefore, Answer A is incorrect. An 
oscilloscope is used to measure electrical current, not to troubleshoot tele- 
phone equipment. Therefore, Answer C is incorrect. A crossover cable is used 
to connect two computers or other devices directly to one another without a 
hub or a switch between them. Therefore, Answer D is incorrect.

V¢I A. Most network devices have two LED fights: one to indicate whether there 
i! iiiii i 
is an active network connection and one to indicate whether traffic is being 
passed by the device. The solid green LED light indicates a good network con- 
nection, and the flickering green LED indicates that traffic is being passed. 
Therefore, Answer A is correct. 
B, C, D. If one LED light was solid green and the other was not lit at all, this 
would indicate an established network connection that was not passing any 
traffic. Therefore, Answer B is incorrect. If neither LED light was lit, this would 
i iiiiiii
indicate that there was not an established network connection, either because 
~iiii~i, iiii .............. !i!!!!! !!!!
of a faulty cable or some other reason. Therefore, Answer C is incorrect. If the

would be lit with a solid amber or orange color. Therefore, Answer D is incor- 
rect. 
12. You are the network administrator for a small health services company.Your com-

workstations, using an address range from 192.168.99.1 through 192.168.99.254, 
with a Class C subnet mask and a default gateway of 192.168.99.1.You have 
recently configured a Linux server to operate as the web server for your company's 
Internet presence, and you need this server to have a statically assigned IP address. 
Once you configure the IP address for this server, you attempt to access your com- 
pany's Web page and are unable to do so.You use the ifconfig command to verify 
the IP configuration of the Linux server. Based on the output below, which con-

should be on the 192.168.99.0 network, ifconfig indicates that you made a 
typo and configured it for the 192.168.98.0 network. This will render the 
server unable to communicate on this network; therefore, Answer B is correct. 
N 
A, C, D. The HWaddr setting is the MAC address of the NIC card, which 
does not have to be changed in this situation. Therefore, Answer A is incorrect. 
The BCast setting indicates the local broadcast address for this computer, 
which is correct for this configuration. Therefore, Answer C is incorrect. This 
network uses the default Class C subnet mask, so the mask setting of 
255.255.255.0 is correct for this scenario.Therefore, Answer D is incorrect.

Troubleshooting Methodology 
1. You are a network consultant specializing in supporting Small Office Home Office 
.

(SOHO) networks. One of your clients maintains an office consisting of three 
workstations configured in a peer-to-peer workgroup. This office does not have a 
i 
server computer at this time. One of the workstations, \\OFFICE1, has an IP 
iiii~<~'~i~ii~!~iii~ii~iiiii~!ii!~!!i!{ 
able to access using the following syntax: \\OFFICEl\share.Your client has

of 192.168.1.100 and hosts a file share that the other three workstations are 
you in to troubleshoot a new workstation that they have recently installed that is 
unable to access this share. When you arrive on site, you find that the workstation 
is able to ping OFFICE1 by its IP address, but not by its NetBIOS name. What is 
the best way for you to allow the new workstation to access the file share located 
on OFFICEI? 
A. Upgrade OFFICE1 to Windows 2000 server and configure the WINS Server 
service. 
B. Add an entry to the lmhosts file on the new workstation. 
C. Add an entry to the hosts file on the new workstation. 
D. Upgrade OFFICE1 to Windows 2000 server and configure the DNS service. 
V¢I B. For a SOHO environment such as this one, you can use lmhosts files to 
provide IP address-to-NetBIOS name mappings for a small number of work- 
stations. The new workstation probably does not have the correct lmhosts file 
in place, which is why it is unable to browse network resources. Therefore, 
Answer B is correct. 
A, C, D. While installing a WINS server will provide NetBIOS name resolu- 
tion, it is overkill in this scenario because this is only a small office - creating a 
server environment just to provide name resolution is not necessary. Therefore, 
Answer A is incorrect. The hosts file is used to provide DNS name resolution, 
not NetBIOS. lmhosts is used to provide NetBIOS name resolution.Therefore, 
Answer C is incorrect. Installing a DNS server will not provide name resolu- 
tion, and would be overkill for this scenario anyway. Therefore, Answer D is 
incorrect.

Based on this output, why is this workstation unable to browse any network resources? 
A. The default gateway is unavailable. 
B. The workstation could not contact a DHCP server. 
C. The workstation is configured with the incorrect default gateway. 
D. The workstation's DHCP lease has expired. 
B. This workstation is configured using Automatic Private IP Addressing 
(APIPA), which is used by Windows workstations when they are unable to 
contact a DHCP server.APIPA provides limited IP connectivity with no 
default gateway or DNS name resolution. Therefore, Answer B is correct.

A, C, D.A workstation configured with APIPA does not have a default 
gateway. If other workstations on the same subnet are able to communicate, 
this indicates that the problem does not lie with the default gateway. Therefore, 
Answer A is incorrect. A workstation configured with APIPA is configured 
with the default Class B subnet mask.This workstation's inability to communi- 
cate stems from its inability to contact a DHCP server and is not related to its 
subnet mask. Therefore, Answer C is incorrect. This workstation's inability to

5. You are the network administrator for a sales office. Until now, this has been a 
small peer-to,peer network consisting of five Windows 2000 professional worksta- 
tions using lmhosts files on each workstation to perform DNS name resolution. 
The sales force has recently expanded significantly, requiring you to purchase a 
Windows Server 2003 server and fifteen additional workstations.You have encoun- 
tered numerous troubleshooting situations where a workstation's lmhosts file was 
missing or out of date, preventing name resolution from taking place. How can you 
improve the name resolution process for your network? 
A. Install the DNS service on the Windows 2000 server. 
B. 
Install the WINS service on the Windows 2000 server. 
C. Install the DHCP service on the Windows 2000 server. 
D. Install the DNS service on each Windows XP workstation. 
gl B. The Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS) will provide centralized 
NetBIOS name-to-IP address mapping and name resolution for a client-server 
environment. Therefore, Answer B is correct. 
IN A, C, D. The WINS service provides for centralized Internet hostname resolu- 
tion; it is not a replacement for lmhosts files. Therefore, Answer A is incorrect. 
The DHCP service provides automatic IP address configuration for client 
computers; it does not provide name resolution. Therefore, Answer C is incor- 
rect. The DNS service runs on Windows server computers; it is not available 
on Windows XP Professional workstations. Therefore, Answer D is incorrect. 
6. You are the network administrator for a large pharmaceutical company that has 
over 1,000 workstations. To simplify TCP/IP configuration for these numerous 
clients, you installed a DHCP server over a year ago to automatically configure 
your clients with an IP address, as well as the following common configuration 
information: 
Subnet Mask: 255.255.0.0 
Default Gateway: 172.16.0.1 
DNS Servers: 
172.16.0.100 
172.16.0.101 
,nt network redesign, you had to change the default gateway used 
o a different IP address: 172.16.1.1.You made the necessary change 
erver, and most of your clients were updated automatically. After 

Self Test Appendix 
899 
you make this change, you receive a call from one user who no longer able to 
browse the Internet.You examine the TCP/IP configuration of her LAN connec- 
tion and see the following: 
Figure 12.9 Internal Protocol Properties 
How can you configure this workstation with the correct default gateway 
information? (Each choice represents a complete solution. Choose two.) 
A. Delete the manually configured information and select Obtain an IP 
address automatically. 
B. Run ipconfig/renew from the command prompt. 
C. Manually update the IP address of the default gateway. 
D. Run ipconfig/release from the command prompt. 
El A, C. A computer that has its TCP/IP configuration manually configured will 
not be updated when you make changes to the configuration being handed 
out by a DHCP server. To allow this client to receive these updates automati- 
cally, you must remove the manually configured information and configure the 
workstation to obtain an IP address automatically. Therefore, Answer A is cor- 
rect. If a computer's TCP/IP configuration is manually configured, it will not 
be updated when you make changes to the configuration being handed out by 
a DHCP server.You must manually update the default gateway that this com- 
puter is configured with in order to restore connectivity. Therefore, Answer C 
is correct.

gl A. 192.168.3.155 would be a valid IP address for the 192.168.3.0 Class C net- 
work since it is an unused address in the range of 192.168.3.1-192.168.3.254. 
Therefore, Answer A is correct. 
[k-1 B, C, D. 192.168.3.1 is in the correct address range for Subnet C, but it is 
already in use as the default gateway for Subnet C. Assigning a duplicate IP 
address in this manner would cause connectivity issues for the entire subnet. 
Therefore, Answer B is incorrect. 192.168.3.0 is the network address for the 
192.168.3.0 Class C network, and cannot be assigned to an individual host. 
Therefore, Answer C is incorrect. 192.168.3.255 is the broadcast address for the 
192.168.3.0 Class C network, and should not be assigned to an individual 
computer. Therefore, Answer D is incorrect. 
You are the administrator for the network shown in the following figure.You

[k-1 C, D. If Router A was experiencing a hardware failure, Computer7 would be 
experiencing connectivity issues along with Computer8. Since the connec- 
tivity failure seems to be limited to Computer8, this does not appear to be the 
case. Therefore, Answer C is incorrect. In the scenario described in this ques- 
tion, Computer7 is not experiencing any network connectivity issues, so the 
TCP/IP configuration of Computer7 does not require troubleshooting. 
Therefore, Answer D is incorrect.

C. Configure a firewall rule allowing all TCP traffic to this employee's worksta- 
tion. 
D. Configure a firewall rule allowing traffic to TCP ports 80 and 443. 
[-¢I A. FTP uses TCP ports 20 and 21 to transmit and receive information. When 
the firewall was installed, the consultant apparently did not permit any FTP 
traffic to pass between your internal network and the Internet. Creating a fire- 
wall rule to allow these two ports will restore the employee's access to FTP. 
Therefore, Answer A is correct. 
N! B, C, D. TCP port 25 is used for the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), 
o,~a TO.P ,,,~rt 110 is used for the Post Office Protocol (POP3). These two pro- 
ed to send and receive e-mail, not to allow FTP file transfers. 
.nswer B is incorrect. While allowing all TCP traffic to pass 
his employee's workstation will restore his access to the ftp.air- 

Self Test Appendix 
905 
planes.com FTP server, it will also unnecessarily expose his computer and the 
rest of your network to security threats and is therefore not the best choice in 
this scenario. Therefore, Answer C is incorrect. TCP port 80 is used for HTTP 
....... 
traffic and TCP port 443 is used for SSL encrypted traffic, not for sending and 
receiving FTP file transfers. Therefore, Answer D is incorrect.

B. Computer5 and Computer6 are connected to the 192.168.1.1 interface of 
Router A, so a failure of this interface would create an outage for both PCs. 
Therefore, Answer B is correct. 
[k-1 A, C, D. A failed network cable on Computer5 would not create a connec- 
tivity issue for both Computer5 and Computer6. Therefore, Answer A is incor- 
rect. The 192.168.4.1 interface of Router B is attached to Subnet D, and does 
not connect Computer5 and Computer6 to the Internet. Based on this dia- 
gram, an outage on Subnet D would not affect Internet connectivity for 
herefore, Answer C is incorrect. The 192.168.5.1 interface connects 
, Router B. If this network segment was down, both Subnet A and

V4I D. If two subnets are attached by a single router with no hops in between, and 
these two subnets cannot communicate with each other, it is likely that the 
router does not have a route configured between the two subnets. Therefore, 
Answer D is correct. 
A, B, C. If the router interface attached to Subnet D was malfunctioning, 
Computer3 would not be able to access resources outside of Subnet D. Since 
this is not the case, Answer A is incorrect. If the router interface attached to 
Subnet C was malfunctioning, Computer1 would not be able to access 
resources outside of Subnet C. Since this is not the case, Answer B is incorrect. 
If Router B did not have a route from Subnet C to the Internet, Computer1 
would not be able to access the Internet. Since this is not the case, Answer C is 
incorrect.
