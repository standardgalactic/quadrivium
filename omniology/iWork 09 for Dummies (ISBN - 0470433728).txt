About the Author
Jesse Feiler has been a user of Macs and Mac software since the beginning 
in 1984. Through his consulting company, North Country Consulting (www.

Author’s Acknowledgments
Many people have helped bring this book together. First of all, my agent, 
Carole McClendon, at Waterside Productions, provided her usual valuable 
insight and suggestions. Colleagues and clients at North Country Consulting 
put in their comments and suggestions about the book and the features they 
use most in the iWork applications.
Susan Pink, copy editor and project editor, has been an enormous help as 
we’ve struggled through the complexities of capitalization of technical terms 
(a constantly moving target). Dennis Cohen has provided invaluable techni-
cal assistance. Thanks also to Laura L. Bowman, the proofreader.
In addition to the names of those listed on the Publisher’s Acknowledgments 
page, my thanks to the Apple technical documentation staff, who have main-
tained their usual high standard of documentation for developers, making it 
easy to see how the software is put together.

Introduction
i
Work ’09 For Dummies addresses the basics of all three iWork 
applications — Pages, Keynote, and Presentations — and then delves 
into the specifics of each. Tools such as page layouts, charts and tables, and 
slide presentations can show up in any iWork application. This reflects the 
way people work, although it doesn’t often reflect the way in which other 
office products have been built. If you’re used to another office suite, some of 
this may be disorienting. Everyone knows that tables and charts are part of 
spreadsheets, page layout tools are part of word processing, and slideshows 
are for presentations.
As is often the case with things that “everyone knows,” this approach is often 
wrong. You can easily find an office suite in which a word processor can be 
used to build charts and tables while spreadsheets can also be used to build 
charts and tables. The commands and the results can be quite different.
In iWork, the basic commands for page layout, charts and tables, and graphic 
objects are the same for all iWork applications. Some expanded options and 
features are added for specific applications. For example, you use the same 
basic tools to create and edit charts and tables in all three applications, but 
Numbers, which is the spreadsheet application, has added features for charts 
and tables beyond those available in Pages and Keynote.
How This Book Is Organized
iWork ’09 For Dummies has five parts and two appendixes. In Part I, I provide 
an overview of iWork as well as the commands and techniques you can use 
for any of the iWork applications. Here’s where you find how to create charts 
and tables and how to use the menus, toolbar, and inspectors that are available 
in each iWork application. Finally, you see how to format text, shapes, and 
images.
If you come away from this part of the book thinking that there’s really only 
one iWork application with a variety of options, you won’t be far wrong. A 
major feature of iWork and its applications is that there’s only one program 
to understand.

iWork ’09 For Dummies 
In Part II you find out about Pages, the word processing component of 
iWork. Pages is actually two applications in one: a standard word processing 
application (much like Microsoft Word) and a page layout application (think 
Quark XPress or InDesign).
Part III describes Numbers, the spreadsheet application, and the newest 
component of iWork. For a long time, spreadsheets were the domain of 
people who worked only with numbers, but studies showed that many users 
didn’t use all (or even many) of the features built into their spreadsheets. 
The folks at Apple have thought long and hard about spreadsheets, charts, 
and tables, and Numbers is the result.
In Part IV, I describe Keynote, the tool for presentations. As Apple has 
focused more and more on media (everything from iTunes and iPods to 
iMovie and iPhoto), the components of successful presentations have been 
available to all users on all Macs. Keynote has been a matter of pulling all 
those tools and features together into a simple-to-use presentation tool. 
In so doing, Keynote has redefined people’s expectations for presentation 
software. In Part IV, you see how to create slides, work with transitions, and 
integrate your own media with your presentations. The tools that let you see 
the next slide and your notes on one display while a large projection screen 
displays your slides for your audience are among the most powerful available 
on any platform.
Part V is an overview of tips and techniques that apply to all three iWork 
applications.
The two appendices can help you explore iWork further. Appendix A introduces 
iWork.com, a beta product that comes with iWork ’09 that lets you share 
iWork documents over the Web. You and people you choose can annotate 
the documents. In addition, anyone to whom you give permission can 
download the documents in various formats.
The process of adding an image to a shape is the same whether you do it in a 
word processing document, a spreadsheet, or a presentation. In Appendix B, 
you find a list of all the techniques in the book along with the specific chapter 
where the technique is described.

 Introduction
Icons Used in This Book
 
This icon identifies things to remember. If you want to highlight the text with a 
colored marker, feel free to do so.
 
This is not a developer book, but sometimes if you know how parts of the 
applications have evolved, it can help you understand how to use those appli-
cations better. This information is separated from the main text so you can 
decide for yourself whether or not to use it.
 
This icon provides shortcuts and hints for improving your iWork documents 
and streamlining your work process.
 
It’s really hard to make a major mistake on the Mac: Almost every command is 
undoable, and Mac developers use the built-in undo mechanism to encourage 
people to experiment with new commands and features. Still, this icon warns 
you of the few times when you have to be careful.
Where to Download the Example Files
I use two lengthy documents as examples (one is a Pages document and the 
other is a Numbers document). If you want to download them and experi-
ment for yourself, go to my Web site at www.northcountryconsulting.

iWork ’09 For Dummies 

Part I
Introducing 
iWork ’09

In this part . . .
i
Work’s three applications — Pages for word processing 
and page layout, Numbers for spreadsheets, and 
Keynote for presentations — let you create very different 
kinds of documents. But the iWork infrastructure means 
that each one of those documents can use common fea-
tures. You add shapes, tables, or charts to Pages in basi-
cally the same way you add them to Keynote. iWork has 
broken down artificial barriers so that you do the same 
things in the same way in all iWork applications.
This part provides an introduction to iWork and to these 
common interface element and to working in iWork  — 
manipulating fonts, colors, and shapes; using the toolbar 
at the top of every iWork window; and taking advantage of 
the powerful inspectors.

Chapter 1
Starting Out with iWork ’09
In This Chapter
▶ Leaving the past behind
▶ The iWork timesavers: Do it once, do it right, and reuse it
W
ord processing and spreadsheet applications are among the most 
widely used software products on personal computers; presentation 
software is a close runner-up. Having started from scratch on the hardware 
side and then the operating system side, people at Apple started dreaming 
about what they could do if they were to start from scratch to write modern 
versions of word processing, spreadsheet, and presentation programs. They 
knew they’d have to follow their recent advertising campaign theme: Think 
Different.
Freed from supporting older operating systems or from foregoing features 
that couldn’t be implemented on Windows, they began to dream about how 
good those programs could be if they could start over.
So they did.
Welcome to iWork.
 
I assume you already have a Mac with iWork ’09 installed. If you need more 
assistance with installations, go to www.apple.com/support/software.
Living the Suite Life
A suite of applications provides a collection of applications that can work 
together. For example:
 
✓ Adobe Creative Suite combines graphics-oriented applications.
 
✓ Apple iLife combines iPhoto, iTunes, iMovie, iWeb, iDVD, and 
GarageBand.

8
Part I: Introducing iWork ’09 
 
✓ Microsoft Office is a suite of applications that comes in a variety of 
flavors: on Mac OS X, it normally includes Microsoft Office, Microsoft 
Excel, and Microsoft PowerPoint. On Windows, there are further variations, 
some of which include Microsoft Access (a database).
Here’s how iWork fits into the picture.
Official business
iWork is an office suite, like Microsoft Office. Office suites provide applications 
that are, well, office oriented. An office suite usually includes at least
 
✓ A word processing application such as Microsoft Word or iWork’s Pages
 
✓ A spreadsheet application such as Microsoft Excel or iWork’s Numbers
 
✓ A presentation application such as Microsoft PowerPoint or iWork’s 
Keynote
 
One of the coolest advantages of iWork is that major features, not just small 
operations such as changing a font or selecting a color, are available in the 
same way in all its applications. You really have only one program to learn 
when you’re using iWork.
One piece at a time
A lot of technical trickery is in the background, but you use iWork through 
three applications that are similar to Microsoft Office applications (but way 
cooler, I think).
Pages
For many people, word processing is the core of an office suite. In fact, many 
people don’t get beyond it. You can create two types of word processing 
documents with iWork:
 
✓ Standard word processing documents, in which the text flows from 
page to page as needed (for example, add a paragraph on page three, 
and the bottom of page three flows onto the top of page four automati-
cally). In general, the automatic flowing of word processing documents 
is used for documents that will be read in the way in which letters and 
memos are read.

9
 Chapter 1: Starting Out with iWork ’09
 
✓ Page layout documents, which have the type of structure you see in 
newspapers and magazines — articles don’t just flow one after the 
other. Instead, an article on page one may be continued on page four 
while another article on page one may be continued on page eight. Also, 
objects such as photos are often placed in a specific position on a page, 
and they don’t move as text is added or deleted.
iWork provides you with a variety of sophisticated tools to create your Pages 
documents. These include advanced font handling, color, tables, and charts, 
as well as the ability to place QuickTime movies and hypertext links in your 
Pages documents. Of course, printed versions of those documents won’t 
support QuickTime movies or hypertext links, but they will be active when 
you look at the document on a computer screen. Or on your iPhone.
Apple starts you off with a variety of templates for various documents. 
Figure 1-1 shows you the templates available for newsletters in the Page 
Layout set of templates.
 
Figure 1-1: 
Choose 
a Pages 
template as 
a starting 
point.
 

10
Part I: Introducing iWork ’09 
If you choose one of the templates, it opens in Pages. You see in later chapters 
how to explore that document, but here’s a sneak preview. A Pages pop-up 
menu in the interface shows you the template’s pages, as shown in Figure 1-2.
 
Figure 1-2: 
Explore 
the pages 
within the 
template.
 
 
You can customize the templates and the pages as you see fit. But before 
you do so, take the time to look at what you have in front of you. It isn’t just 
a matter of nicely formatted pages. In addition, the specific pages in each 
template (they’re different in each template) should give you ideas not just 
for laying out and constructing your document but also for the types of 
information you should consider for different types of documents.
For example, the Program template from the Brochures set of templates 
has a page laid out already for mailing information. Had you thought of 
putting mailing information on your brochure? Maybe you did and maybe 
you didn’t — but Pages did.
Numbers
Spreadsheet programs let you enter data in rows and columns. One of their 
main features is that you can also enter formulas. That way, if you have 
a column listing your grocery expenditures for a week, for example, the 
addition of another bill will cause the column’s total to be recalculated. 
Spreadsheets are about data (usually numbers) and fast calculation updates.
You probably think you know what a spreadsheet looks like, but take a look 
at the Numbers document in Figure 1-3. This is a Numbers document based 
on the Numbers Home Improvement template. A single document can have 
a number of sheets (like sheets in a Microsoft Excel workbook). But there the 
similarity ends. A Numbers sheet can contain a variety of objects: zero or 

11
 Chapter 1: Starting Out with iWork ’09
more tables (traditional spreadsheets), zero or more charts, as well as other 
iWork objects, such as graphics, text boxes, movies, and audio. In Figure 1-3, 
the sheet is shown with a table, a chart, and a picture.
 
Figure 1-3: 
Numbers is 
more than a 
spreadsheet 
application.
 
 
A comment is attached to the table. All iWork applications support comments, 
although each has its own method of displaying them. Sometimes they look 
like those colored notes you stick on memos and refrigerator doors.
Keynote
It’s only been a few thousand years since people starting giving presenta-
tions. Call them lectures, classes, sermons, or sales pitches, they’re all pretty 
much the same: Someone stands in front of a large or small group of people 
and explains, teaches, or informs them. Sometimes, the presentation has mul-
timedia elements: slides in an architecture class, music in a history lecture 
about a composer, and movies in a talk about “My Summer Vacation.”
The Keynote authoring and presentation tools are unsurpassed, but it 
doesn’t stop there. Take a look at Figure 1-4 to see the variety of export for-
mats available in Keynote. When you’re preparing a Keynote presentation, 
you’re simultaneously authoring a QuickTime movie, a Flash animation, 
HTML, or even a DVD. All you have to do is click one extra button to start the 
export process.

sentations 
in a variety 
of formats.
 
 
Keynote was the original iWork application. Built by Apple engineers for 
MacWorld keynote speeches delivered by Steve Jobs, Keynote has been 
refined over the years to the powerful tool it is today.
The Big Difference
You can do similar things with various office suites, but the big difference 
with iWork comes from two aspects of iWork that are hallmarks of Apple’s 
approach to software development:
 
✓ It’s all about communication: From the beginning of the Mac, the people 
at Apple have focused not merely on raw computing power but also on 
how that power and technology can be used to help people communicate.
 
✓ Do it once, do it right, and reuse it: Apple’s pioneering use of scripting 
languages (AppleScript primarily) helped people turn the Macs into 
devices that could learn, as in “watch what I do and then do it 
automatically.”
Perhaps the clearest indication of where Apple’s values lie came in its recent 
corporate name change: It’s now Apple, not Apple Computer. Computers are 
a means to an end.

13
 Chapter 1: Starting Out with iWork ’09
It’s all about communication
For decades, people have been hailing the advent of the paperless office, but 
the flood of paper has only increased. When you think about what people are 
trying to do with all that paper, you realize that it’s not about automating the 
production of documents — it’s about communicating. That’s what iWork 
is about — helping you communicate as effectively and easily as possible. 
Apple has provided elegant interfaces and sophisticated designs for your 
communications, but this isn’t done for decoration. The focus is communication.
If you don’t think it’s all about communication, take a look back at Figure 1-3, 
which shows Numbers in action. In the upper left you can see a recognizable 
table (or part of a spreadsheet). There’s a pie chart and an image showing 
how the items in the spreadsheet could look if used together. If you think 
spreadsheets aren’t about communication, think about how many spread-
sheets you’ve seen that look like this. (If the number is zero, don’t be 
alarmed: Not everyone in the world uses iWork . . . yet.)
As you explore iWork, don’t be dazzled by the wide variety of communication 
tools. The most effective communication is the clearest. If you want someone 
to understand how to change the toner cartridge in a photocopy machine, a 
movie might be the best tool. If you want to explain the structure of an 
organization, a static diagram might be the clearest representation. And 
remember the many documents that have changed the world through their 
words alone.
 
Look at the iWork communication tools not as a challenge in which you 
must use them all; instead, look at them as a wonderful array of tools from 
which you can select the most appropriate ones for any task. Too much of 
anything — graphics, movies, or even words — is counterproductive.
 
For every iWork document, ask yourself these questions:
 
✓ What am I trying to say?
 
✓ Who am I trying to say it to?
After you can answer those two questions, you’re ready to go.
Do it once, do it right, and reuse it
iWork has a variety of tools that save you time by letting you easily reuse 
work you’ve done already. Not only can you reuse your own work, but you 
can also reuse the work of other people.

14
Part I: Introducing iWork ’09 
Customizing with themes and templates
The iWork applications have a variety of tools for reuse; the chief ones are 
themes and templates:
 
 
✓ Themes (Keynote): A theme allows only certain types of modifications. 
The limits on what you can change means that an application that sup-
ports themes knows the basics about what to expect. You can switch 
from one theme to another without compromising your data. This hap-
pens with Keynote and with other applications, such as Bento.
 
 
✓ Templates (Pages and Numbers): A template is a document that’s ready 
for you to modify with your own data and formatting. It has formatting 
set for you that you can then customize. It may have placeholders for 
text and images that you later insert; it may have text and images that 
will be used without change in your documents. After you change a 
margin in a template, for example, your new margin is used in docu-
ments you create from that modified template.
All iWork applications support themes or templates and allow you to save 
a document as a theme or a template. If you choose to modify a theme or a 
template, you can then resave it as a theme or a template of your own. 
Figure 1-5 shows how easy it is to create your own theme in Keynote with 
a simple command. Design the presentation you want to reuse, and then 
choose Save Theme. When you want to reuse it, use the Choose Theme 
command.
 
Figure 1-5: 
Create your 
own theme 
in Keynote.
 
 
The iWork applications ship with themes and templates ready for you to use 
(see Figure 1-6). These are worth exploring even if you plan to start from 
scratch because you can find ideas in all the themes and templates that you 
can use in your own ways. Apple has built on the real-life experiences of iWork 
users. The themes and templates may remind you of features or issues that 
you haven’t thought of.

15
 Chapter 1: Starting Out with iWork ’09
 
Figure 1-6:

iWork 
themes and 
templates.
 
Reusing parts of documents
All iWork applications let you create parts of your documents that you can 
reuse. These reusable parts can be
 
✓ Sections in Pages word processing documents
 
✓ Pages in Pages page layout documents
 
✓ Master slides in Keynote
 
✓ Sheets or tables in Numbers
 
To break down a project to a manageable size, look for the intermediate size 
parts that you can work on. For example, if you’re part of a committee of ten 
people working on a 200-page planning document for a company, a commu-
nity, or an event, where do you begin? If you just start writing, you’re likely to 
be at the task a long time. Very long. Try to break down the task. What are the 
logical components? These will probably become chapters.
If you’re working on a budget for your school, you may soon be looking at 
hundreds of rows and hundreds of columns. Use Numbers tables to divide 
and conquer. Instead of budgeting expenses for the Language Arts department 
in five columns; make Language Arts into its own small table. Numbers makes 
it easy to integrate many small tables into a large whole.

16
Part I: Introducing iWork ’09 
 
Whether a Pages document, a Numbers project, or a Keynote presentation, if 
you make the components about one page in length, you almost always have 
an easier-to-understand document.
Sharing styles
A style is a collection of attributes, such as fonts, typefaces, colors, and 
number formatting. You set up a style and give it a name, and then you can 
reuse it throughout your document. Common styles have names, such as 
Header, Subheader, Address, or Footnote. Using styles means you can set 
one attribute — the style — rather than individually setting the various parts 
of the style.
 
If you use styles, you can change an attribute of the style so that it’s changed 
in every occurrence of the style.
iWork supports styles in all its applications.
Letting your Mac do the work
Mac OS X and iWork support scripting of applications. The two primary tools 
for scripting are AppleScript and Automator. With a script, your work is 
automated. You start the script, and it runs. You can either write scripts or 
use the Record feature in ScriptEditor so that your actions are captured auto-
matically into a script.
 
Scripts are particularly useful for the following:
 
✓ Repeated tasks: If you have a task that needs to be carried out sev-
eral times with only slight variations, AppleScript is your savior. For 
example, you can write a script that retrieves text and images from a 
FileMaker database and places them in a Pages document to automati-
cally produce a catalog.
 
✓ Complex tasks: One of the challenges of complex tasks is remembering all 
the steps and sequences. AppleScript can remember them for you. You 
may not save time, but a script does the task the same way every time.
 
✓ Integration tasks: AppleScript excels at integrating applications and 
their data. For example, a FileMaker/Pages script would communicate 
with FileMaker to retrieve some data, switch to Pages to place it, switch 
back to FileMaker to get some more data, and so forth.

Chapter 2
Working Effectively
In This Chapter
▶ Using the menu system
▶ Exploring shortcut menus and commands
▶ Getting to know the common interface elements
T
he iWork applications share much of the basic interface. This means that 
once you know how to do something in Pages, you generally know how 
to do the same thing in Numbers. This chapter helps you use the common 
tools that apply across all iWork applications.
These tools fall into two broad categories: user interface tools, such as but-
tons, and traditional menu commands. In many cases, you can do the same 
thing using either buttons or menu commands. In other cases (font and text 
management, for example), you can do the basics with menu commands 
and much more extensive customization with buttons. In all cases, you can 
switch back and forth between buttons and menu commands depending on 
your needs and your mood.
 
Common commands such as Quit work the same way in all Mac OS X 
applications, including iWork applications. Sometimes there are slight 
variations from program to program, even within the iWork suite. In general, I 
mention those variations in the specific chapters for each iWork application.
The Menu System
The menu system for iWork provides a great deal of standardization so that 
each iWork app functions in very much the same way. This section provides 
an introduction to the menus, highlighting some of the features you’ll find in 
each one.

18
Part I: Introducing iWork ’09 
The Application menu in Pages, 
Numbers, and Keynote
Common Mac OS X menu commands, such as Save, Quit, Cut/Copy/Paste, 
and Undo/Redo aren’t covered in this chapter.
The Application menu is where you set preferences (which can be different 
for each application). This menu is also where you find the About command, 
shown in Figure 2-1, which shows the version information and your license key.
 
Figure 2-1: 
Set prefer-
ences in the 
Application 
menu.
 
 
Take a moment now to write down the license key for your iWork applications. 
Keep it on a piece of paper or in your Bento database in case you need to 
reinstall the software. There is only one license key for all three applications.
You can show or hide all application windows (this applies to all Mac 
applications, including iWork). You can also show all application windows.
The Application menu is also where you can register your software or try it 
out before you buy it. And, at the end of the menu, you find the Quit command.
The File menu
The File menu, shown in Figure 2-2, has the basic commands to create and 
open documents (including reopening recent documents) as well as print 
them. All of these are standard commands for most File menus. In iWork, 
two sets of special menu commands relate to themes and templates. You can 
use built-in templates for Numbers and Pages documents; when you create a 
new document from one of these, formatting, colors, and fonts are predeter-
mined to give your document the best appearance. When it comes to colors 
in charts or tables, iWork coordinates those with the palette of colors in the 
template you have chosen.

19
 Chapter 2: Working Effectively
 
Figure 2-2: 
The File 
menu.
 
Towards the bottom of the File menu for Numbers and Pages is a command 
to save the current document as a template. All the settings are saved in this 
template so that you can easily create a document based on it.
A template is a collection of settings that can be applied to a new iWork 
document when you create it. You can modify those settings as you see fit, 
and you can save the modified template.
In the case of Keynote, instead of templates, you have themes. The difference 
between themes and templates is that a theme can be reapplied to a document 
as you are editing it. This is possible with a highly structured document such 
as a Keynote presentation (it’s also possible with a Bento library). Because 
the document’s structure is strict, Keynote knows where all the elements 
are, and it can always reformat slides and bullet items when you apply a new 
theme.
The Edit menu
Like all Edit menus in Mac OS X, the iWork Edit menu combines the standard 
Undo and Redo commands as well as commands for Select, Copy, and Paste, 
as shown in Figure 2-3. Writing tools such as Find and Spelling are available 
to enhance your text; there’s more on the Find and Spelling tools in Chapter 23.
One of the important commands in the Edit menu is the Paste and Match 
Style command. This command pastes selected text in the document, but it 
picks up the current style of the location where the text is pasted. As a result, 
the pasted text fits right in.

20
Part I: Introducing iWork ’09 
 
Figure 2-3: 
The Edit 
menu lets 
you use the 
standard 
cut-and-
paste 
commands.
 
The Insert menu
The Insert menu lets you insert files and objects into your iWork document. 
The following types of objects can be inserted into any iWork document:
 
✓ Comments
 
✓ Text boxes
 
✓ Shapes
 
✓ Charts
 
✓ Tables
 
✓ Functions (such as sums)
The fact that these items are all available in menu commands and on the 
toolbar is a great feature of iWork. I discuss them in Chapter 3.
You use the Insert➪Choose command to open a standard Open File dialog so 
you can select a document to insert into your iWork document at the current 
insertion point or inside a selected object. The types of files that are available 
depend on the iWork application and the selected object. In general, when 
you want to insert a file into an iWork document, the Choose command is the 
command you want.
 
You can insert a file into an iWork document also by dragging it from a Finder 
window to the appropriate location in the document. Each iWork application 
has additional objects to insert.

21
 Chapter 2: Working Effectively
The Slide menu (Keynote)
The Slide menu lets you manage slides in a presentation. You often do this 
by using the buttons in the Keynote window and dragging slides in the Slides 
pane, as shown in Figure 2-4.
 
Figure 2-4: 
Rearrange 
Keynote 
slides.
 
You can reorder slides and move them into a hierarchical structure. You can 
also use commands in the Slide menu to manage them.
The Table menu (Numbers)
You use the Table menu to manage Numbers tables. As you can see from 
Figure 2-5, there are many commands you can use to add or change rows and 
columns.

22
Part I: Introducing iWork ’09 
 
Figure 2-5: 
Use the 
Table menu 
to modify a 
table.
 
You can also use triangles in the frame of rows and columns to invoke rel-
evant row and column commands, as shown in Figure 2-6. Whether you use 
the Table menu or the commands in the table frame, the basic procedure is 
the same: Select a row or column, and then use the appropriate command to 
modify it.
The Format menu
The Format menu gives you commands for working with fonts and text. In 
fact, you find a variety of ways to accomplish the same goal in the Format 
menu.
Formatting fonts with menu commands
The Format➪Font submenu and its submenus give you a lot of control, 
but not as much as the Fonts window. Figure 2-7 shows the Format➪Font 
submenu structure and its Kerning submenu.

Figure 2-7:

You can switch back and forth between the menu commands and the Fonts 
window.

24
Part I: Introducing iWork ’09 
The first part of the Font menu covers the basics, such as italics (and covers 
them with less precision than the Fonts window). But then you start to see 
the differences:
 
✓ Instead of setting a font size, you can select some text and make it bigger 
or smaller until it looks right to you (use the keyboard shortcuts to do 
this quickly).
 
✓ Kerning (the horizontal spacing between characters) can be tightened 
or loosened; you don’t have to set specific values.
Formatting text with menu commands
You can use the Format➪Font submenu to set alignment or justification. 
Alignment refers to the way the text in a paragraph is set: It can be aligned 
left (with a flush left margin, like in this book), aligned right (with a flush right 
margin), or centered. Fully justified text is aligned flush at both margins.
The Arrange menu
All the iWork apps allow you to place objects on a page (or sheet, in the case 
of Numbers). You can organize and arrange these so that they make sense 
and look good. One of the keys to this is the Arrange menu, which is shown in 
Figure 2-8.
 
Figure 2-8: 
Use the 
Arrange 
menu.
 
You can create long sections of text and large tables of numbers, but most 
of the time you’re better off focusing on smaller units: a paragraph or two, a 
table of a few rows and columns, or a short sequence of slides that presents 
a concept.

25
 Chapter 2: Working Effectively
You may find that the simplest way to start to arrange a page (or sheet or 
slide) is to place the components you want to use on the page. Figure 2-9 
shows a page where I’ve started an arrangement.
 
Figure 2-9: 
Begin to 
arrange 
your 
content.
 
You can arrange content in many ways. Most of the time, it’s a matter of trial 
and error as you experiment to see what works best. Here’s a sequence of 
steps you can try:
 
1. Resize the objects.
 
 If you are using images and objects from various sources, they’re likely 
to be different sizes. Resize them so that they’re basically the same size, 
with the more important ones (the title, for example) a bit larger.
 
2. Bring objects forward or backward.
 
 The Ferris wheel photo in Figure 2-9 has plenty of sky. It covers up 
part of the book cart. If you select the book cart image, you can choose 
Arrange➪Bring Forward to place the book cart in front of the sky so that 
the details of the cart are more visible, as shown in Figure 2-10.

26
Part I: Introducing iWork ’09 
 
Figure 2-10: 
Move the 
book cart 
forward.
 
 
3. Create a title.
 
 Figure 2-9 also contains a text box (“Rhododendron Festival”) and 
a colored shape designed as its background. Together, they’ll make 
a good title. (This combination of shape and text box is a common 
iWork technique.) Select the text box and the shape, and then choose 
Arrange➪Align Objects➪Middle. The result is shown in Figure 2-11. 
(Note that at this point, all you see of the title is the plus icon at the 
bottom of the text. You’ll fix that shortly.)
 
 Aligning two objects in the middle aligns them in the vertical middle. To 
totally align two objects, follow up the middle alignment with center 
alignment, which aligns them horizontally. You usually need both com-
mands (middle and center) to properly align objects on top of one 
another.
 
4. Create a text box.
 
 Another text box is shown in Figure 2-11. Unlike the Rhododendron 
Festival text box that will become a title with a colored background, 
this second text box will stand on its own without a special background. 
You can see the beginning of this second text box with the text, “The 
Rhododendron Festival in Florence Oregon is a special event in May.”

27
 Chapter 2: Working Effectively
 
Figure 2-11: 
Start to cre-
ate a title.
 
 
5. Move the shape backward.
 
 As you can see in Figure 2-11, the Rhododendron Festival text box is vis-
ible only with its handles. That’s because it’s behind the colored shape. 
Select the shape and choose Arrange➪Send to Back. The shape moves 
back and the text is now visible, as shown in Figure 2-12.
 
6. Correct the alignment.
 
 Something is a bit wrong with the spacing in Figure 2-12. This is common 
as you move objects around and resize them. Sometimes the correction 
is a matter of trial and error; other times you can see what the problem 
is immediately.
 
 A simple way of correcting alignment issues like this is to click in the 
text and display the format bar. Figure 2-13 shows the problem: The title 
text is aligned left; it will look better if it’s aligned in the center. This is a 
common (and easily solved) issue: Just click the Align Center button, 
which is immediately to the right of the Align Left button.
These are the little tweaks that make the difference between an elegant docu-
ment and one that doesn’t quite cut the mustard.

The View menu
The View menu lets you show or hide parts of the iWork window. The View 
pop-up menu on the toolbar provides the same functionality. Each app has 
its own features; they’re described in the relevant chapters.
The Play menu (Keynote)
You use the Play menu, shown in Figure 2-14, to control how a Keynote 
slideshow is played. There’s more information on this in Chapter 19. 
 
Figure 2-14:

The Windows menu
The Windows menu is a standard part of Mac OS X. You use it to minimize 
the current window (which you can also do with the yellow minimize button 
in the upper-left corner of the window). You can also maximize the window, 
just as you do with the green button at the upper left of the window.
The Windows menu lists all of the application’s windows. You can choose 
Windows➪Bring All to Front to bring all of an application’s windows forward. 
You can also choose Pages/Keynote/Numbers➪Hide Others so that no other 
windows are visible on the screen.
The Share menu
Finally, the Share menu lets you share documents on the Web and with users 
in other formats. There’s more on the Share menu in Chapter 21.

Part I: Introducing iWork ’09 
Shortcuts
The iWork menus group commands by their basic functions, such as editing, 
inserting, and formatting. The menu commands are generally static. Some are 
disabled if they don’t make sense for the selected objects, but generally their 
names and their order remain static. (The exceptions are toggle commands 
such as Show Inspector/Hide Inspector; depending on whether an inspector 
is shown, one command or the other is shown in the menu.)
Sometimes you aren’t certain exactly what you want to do, but you know 
what you want to do it to. Shortcut menus come to the rescue.
Select one or more objects in an iWork window, and then hold down the 
Control key while you press the mouse button. A shortcut menu (sometimes 
called a contextual menu) pops up next to the object. This shortcut menu 
assembles all menu commands from the various iWork menus that are rel-
evant to the object. Most of the disabled commands in the menu bar are 
excluded from the shortcut menu, so you wind up with just the commands 
you can actually use on the selected object. Occasionally, some of the com-
mands in the shortcut menu are disabled, but they’re the exception rather 
than the rule.
Figure 2-15 shows a shortcut menu in Numbers when a spreadsheet cell is 
selected. Commands relevant to the cell and to its column or row, as well as 
the standard editing commands, are all in one place.

 Chapter 2: Working Effectively
Standard Elements
A brief tour of the common interface elements will not only get you ready to 
use all of the iWork applications but will also show you the richness of fea-
tures available for you to use.
 
Many of the commands in the command interface let you manipulate objects: 
text, graphics, shapes, table cells, and the like. The way that you manipulate 
similar objects is the same across the iWork applications. What is different is 
often how you create the objects. There is a great deal of similarity in creating 
a text box in Pages, Numbers, and Keynote, but there is almost total similarity 
in manipulating the text box once it has been created. If you’re primarily inter-
ested in creating objects, you might want to explore the later chapters of this 
book first. However, if you’re interested in manipulating them, this chapter is 
your key. Depending on your specific needs, you may want to switch back and 
forth between chapters.
 
The format bar, located just below the toolbar, is a common interface element. 
However, its components are sufficiently different for each of the iWork appli-
cations that it is described in the context of each specific application  rather 
than in this chapter.
The iWork window
Figure 2-16 shows you the bare bones of an iWork window, with a Business 
Card template in Pages. What stays the same for all iWork applications is the 
outer frame: the title bar at the top with the close, minimize, and zoom but-
tons at the upper left; the bottom frame with (from left) a pop-up menu to 
set the zoom factor for the window, the page information, and up- and down-
arrows to move to the next or previous page (if there is no next or previous 
page, the appropriate arrow appears dimmed). At the right, the scrolling 
tools common to many Mac windows are provided. Finally, in the lower right 
the resize corner lets you resize (and reshape) the window.
The iWork Toolbar
But what is that oblong button at the right of the title bar? Click it and you’ll 
find out, as shown in Figure 2-17. The oblong button is the toolbar button: It 
shows and hides the toolbar. Each iWork application has its own toolbar, but 
some basics apply to all of them. (Chapter 3 goes into toolbars in depth.)

 Chapter 2: Working Effectively
 
The gray background of the toolbar behaves just like the background of the 
window’s title bar. You can drag the window by clicking anywhere in that gray 
background.
If the window isn’t wide enough to show the toolbar, the icons at the right are 
shown (text only) just beyond the right side of the toolbar when you click the 
double arrow shown at the right in Figure 2-18.
 
Figure 2-18:

Some toolbar icons have small downward-pointing arrows that bring up a 
menu of choices. Usually, the choices are visual, as shown in Figure 2-19, but 
sometimes the choice is a traditional menu with text commands.
Some toolbar icons have a plus symbol at the upper left, as shown in Figure 
2-20. These icons add something to the document: another page, another 
table, or whatever the icon indicates. In the case of Pages, these icons can 
represent a specific type of page to add based on the chosen template. As 
you see in Figure 2-20, you can choose to add a blank page or a page with 
eight or ten new labels.

Colors window
Color has become an essential part of today’s documents both on paper and 
on the screen. The days of black-and-white printing for most documents is 
long gone. You can use color to create the most garish and distracting 
documents that confuse and annoy people, but you can use color also to 

35
 Chapter 2: Working Effectively
enhance your communication and make your work more attractive. One of 
the Mac’s most useful features is a consistent and integrated approach to 
color management. While not all applications on the Mac use the common 
interface, all iWork applications use it. So do many applications from Apple 
and third parties. You will find yourself wanting to set colors for text, graphics, 
and graphics in iWork. You set color in one place: the Colors window. This 
section provides you with a fast way to set a color. Then, you find out how to 
use the advanced features of the Colors window.
The Colors window is a floating window that appears only when the 
application is active. That means if you switch to another application by 
clicking one of its windows (or by launching it), the Pages window will remain 
visible behind the other application’s windows, but the Colors window and 
any other floating windows will disappear. When Pages once again becomes 
active (most commonly when you click one of its windows in the background 
of another application), its floating windows come forward and become 
active. In addition, the Colors window reappears, in its last location. Other 
floating windows discussed in this chapter, such as the Fonts panel and the 
Inspector window, have the same behavior.
 
The Colors window is part of Mac OS X; it is used in many applications, not 
just iWork.
The process for applying a color depends on how you’re using the color. 
You can
 
✓ Color a selected object.
 
✓ Color a nonselected object.
 
✓ Add a color to your palette in the Colors window.
 
✓ Copy a color from an object in the window.
Coloring a selected object using the Colors window
To color a selected object, such as text or a graphic element, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Select the object you want to color.
 
2. Click the Colors button on the toolbar or choose View➪Show Colors to 
open the Colors window, which is shown in Figure 2-21.
 
 If the color wheel isn’t shown as you see it in Figure 2-21, click the color 
wheel button at the top left of the Colors window. If you don’t see the 
set of five buttons across the top of the Colors window, click the oblong 
button at the top right of the window and then click the color wheel 
button at the left.

36
Part I: Introducing iWork ’09 
 
Figure 2-21:

 To brighten or darken the colors in the color wheel, use the slider at the

3. Click a color from the color wheel.
 
 The center of the wheel is white. It shades into other colors:
 
• Yellows in the upper right
 
• Reds in the lower right
 
• Blues in the lower left
 
• Greens in the upper left
 
 The selected color is applied to the selected object automatically.
Coloring a nonselected object using the Colors window
Follow this process if you want to select a color and then apply it to one or 
more elements that aren’t selected:
 
1. Click the Colors button on the toolbar or choose View➪Show Colors to 
open the Colors window, which is shown in Figure 2-21.
 
 If the color wheel isn’t shown as you see it in Figure 2-21, click the color 
wheel button at the top left of the Colors window.
 
 If you don’t see the set of five buttons across the top of the Colors 
window, click the oblong button at the top right of the window and then 
click the color wheel button at the left.
 
2. Use the slider at the right to brighten or darken the colors in the color 
wheel.

37
 Chapter 2: Working Effectively
 
3. Click a color from the color wheel.
 
 The center of the wheel is white; it shades into specific colors: yellows 
in the upper right, reds in the lower right, blues in the lower left, and 
greens in the upper left.
 
 The color appears in the rectangular box at the top of the Colors 
window. This box is called the color well.
 
4. Drag the color from the color well to the object you want to color.
 
5. Repeat with any other object you want to color with the same color.
Saving a color in your color palette
The Colors window lets you save swatches of color in a palette at the bottom 
of the window. This palette shows up in all Colors windows. It consists of ten 
rows of swatches; its width is determined by the width of the Colors window. 
Figure 2-22 shows the palette with all ten rows shown in a widened window.
 
Figure 2-22: 
Use the 
Colors 
window 
palette.
 
Using the preceding steps, select the color you want. But instead of dragging 
the color to the object to color (in Step 4), drag it to a swatch in the color 
palette.

38
Part I: Introducing iWork ’09 
 
Organize the colors in your palette so that you know what they will be used 
for. You can leave spaces, as shown in Figure 2-22, so that colors for your Web 
site are separated from colors for your brochures, for example. If you put the 
green for your Web site next to the green for your Keynote presentation 
backgrounds, you may have trouble telling them apart. Millions of colors are 
available on modern computers such as the Mac; using a selected subset 
makes your work elegant and consistent. It also makes it much easier to set 
colors in your iWork documents, as you will see in the next step.
Coloring a selected object using the palette
Once you have set up colors in the palette, the process of coloring a selected 
object is much simpler.
 
1. Select the object.
 
2. Open the Colors window as described in the preceding steps.
 
3. Double-click the color from the palette.
Coloring a nonselected object using the palette
Likewise, the process for coloring nonselected objects is simpler with the 
palette:
 
1. Open the Colors window as described in the preceding steps.
 
2. Single-click the color you want.
 
 The color appears in the color well.
 
3. Drag the color from the color well to any object you want to color.
Copying a color from the screen
Any color you see on the screen can be copied to the color well. This can 
be a color from a Web site, from a photo, or from an interface element of 
an application. (Colors themselves aren’t copyrighted, but combinations 
of them may be copyrighted logos and images.) To copy a color from the 
screen:
 
1. Open the Colors window.
 
2. Click the magnifying glass to the left of the color well.
 
3. Move it over the color on the screen you want to copy.
 
 The pixels under the magnifying glass are enlarged, and you can posi-
tion the center of the magnifying glass directly over the color you want.

39
 Chapter 2: Working Effectively
 
4. Click and the color is placed in the color well. From there, you can 
apply the color to objects in your document or place it in your palette.
 
Graphics often have a row of pixels along their edges to make them appear 
better on the screen. You may think that you have a red circle on a back-
ground of a blue square, but when you look at the individual pixels, you may 
find one or two rows of pixels in intermediate colors that make the image 
more attractive and remove fuzziness. For that reason, make certain that you 
center the magnifying glass on the color you want and not on the special 
pixels at its edge.
Setting opacity
Opacity refers to the degree of transparency of the color — the extent to 
which objects behind it can be seen. Now that you’ve selected a color, you 
may want to set its opacity with the slider at the bottom of the window. 
Lower numbers (dragging the slider to the left) make the color more trans-
parent so that objects behind it are visible.
Advanced color management
The Colors window gives you as much control as you want over color. If you 
want red, you can just click a red crayon. If you want exactly the shade of red 
that you remember from your first grown-up prom gown, you can have that. 
But before you go too far, you should know that color is one of the most sub-
jective perceptions we have. Artists and philosophers as diverse as Wolfgang 
Goethe in the eighteenth century and Josef Albers in the twentieth century 
wrote and thought perceptively about color (and they didn’t agree).
Colors look different in different lighting conditions; even more important, 
reflected color (that is, color that is reflected from a wall, painting, or physi-
cal object) looks different from color that is transmitted (such as on a com-
puter screen or a projection screen). You can use whatever color model you 
want. If you’re trying to match colors on other documents, they may be spec-
ified in one of the slider models and values, so it is easiest to use them. You 
can use different color models for different objects in the same document. 
The only way to accurately match colors is to use the actual method that will 
be used to display them. Don’t even try to match a color in a newspaper with 
a color on a flat-panel TV screen.
The Colors window (shown in Figure 2-23) gives you as much or as little 
complexity as you want. At the top of the Colors window, five buttons let 
you choose between five color pickers — ways of comparing and identifying 
colors:

40
Part I: Introducing iWork ’09 
 
Figure 2-23: 
Use RGB 
sliders to 
set a color.
 
 
✓ Color wheel: Maybe you learned about the color wheel in school. The 
center point of the color wheel is always white. Individual colors move 
out from there, with greens in the upper left, blues in the lower left, reds 
in the lower right, and yellows in the upper right. The colors merge into 
one another. When you click a color in the color wheel, it fills the box 
just above the color wheel. Set the brightness for the entire color wheel 
with the slider at the right.
 
✓ Color sliders: The second button lets you select from among color slid-
ers, which allow you to specify a color using numbers. These may seem 
to have more precision than the color wheel, but they actually have 
less because the numbers are integers: one value for gray scale, three 
for RGB and HSB, and four for CMYK. If you want a color that is just 
between grayscale 65 and 66, for example, you can’t compromise on 
65.6. In the color wheel, are least theoretically, every gradation is pos-
sible (the hardware limits the actual gradations). Four separate models 
are supported for sliders:
 
• Gray scale slider: This slider shows shades of gray. You can move 
it until the color in the box at the top of the Colors window is the 
shade of gray you want. You also can type a percent from 0 per-
cent (black) to 100 percent (white).
 
• RGB sliders: This color model uses three numbers to define the 
colors red, green, and blue (hence RGB). Each can have a value 
from 0 to 255 as shown in Figure 2-23. As you move the slider or 
type a number, the color at the top changes. If you want a basic 
red, set red to 255 and set the blue and green values to 0. RGB 
colors are often used to set colors for the Web and other screen-
display devices.

41
 Chapter 2: Working Effectively
 
• CMYK sliders: These behave just like RGB sliders, but they use 
a different model based on four values: cyan (C), magenta (M), 
yellow (Y), and black (K). CMYK is often used to specify colors that 
will be used in printing.
 
• HSB sliders: This is yet another color model based on three 
values: hue, saturation, and brightness. This model is often used in 
television.
 
✓ Palettes: Here you will find palettes of color. You can also create your 
own. Perhaps the most commonly used palette is Web Safe colors, as 
shown in Figure 2-24. These are the colors that are safe to use on the 
Web for all displays on all operating systems and all browsers. If you’re 
designing documents to be published on the Web, you should use these 
colors. To select a color, use the Palette pop-up menu at the top of the 
Palettes tab of the Colors window to select Web Safe and then click 
whatever color you want. The color will appear in the color well at the 
top of the Colors window.
 
 Create and name a palette if it will be used for a specific project. The 
palette at the bottom of the Colors window applies to all of your iWork 
projects and documents.
 
✓ Spectrum: The fourth button from the left is another attempt to represent 
all colors, but in a different layout from the color wheel. Give it a try and 
click the color you want to use.
 
✓ Crayons: If you don’t have to precisely match colors, maybe you’re 
longing for a simple box of crayons. That’s exactly what the last icon 
provides, as shown in Figure 2-25.

The Fonts window
All iWork applications use the Fonts window to provide the greatest amount 
of control over text fonts. The menus have font commands, as you will see 
later in this chapter, but for the greatest control, the Fonts window is what 
you’ll want to use.
 
Your basic font settings can be overridden for individual paragraphs, 
sentences, or even individual characters. Use the Fonts window to set the font 
for the whole document, and then modify sections as needed by selecting 
them and returning to the Fonts window.
The Fonts window is part of Mac OS X; it is used in many applications, not 
just iWork.
Selecting fonts
Setting a font and its size is the most basic thing you do with fonts:
 
1. Select the text you want to change.
 
 If you want to set fonts for text before you type, click the insertion point 
where you want to begin typing. If this is a new document, the pointer is 
automatically positioned at the beginning of the document.
 
 If you have selected text in your iWork document, you will see it change 
as you work in the Fonts window.
 
2. Open the Fonts window by clicking the Font button on the toolbar (at 
the right in Figure 2-17) or by choosing Format➪Font➪Show Fonts.
 
 The Fonts window is shown in Figure 2-26.

43
 Chapter 2: Working Effectively
 
Figure 2-26: 
Set fonts 
with the 
Fonts 
window.
 
 
3. Select the font you want to use from the second column, Family.
 
 The first column, Collections, lets you group font families. Mac OS X 
has already built several collections into the Fonts window. You see 
how to add new collections and how to add font families to collections 
later in this section. Font families can be in more than one collection. 
Collections are just an organizing mechanism for font families.
 
4. Select the typeface from the Typeface column.
 
 Typefaces are somewhat intuitive. Font families are developed by dif-
ferent vendors, and they may use different naming conventions. For 
example, one vendor’s italic might look like another vendor’s oblique in 
different font families.
 
 Figure 2-26 illustrates an issue with font families that you should be 
aware of. Not only do vendors use different typeface names (such as 
oblique versus italic), but one vendor’s typeface variation is another 
vendor’s font family. Notice that the Gill Sans font family in Figure 2-26 
has a Bold typeface. Just below it is another font family called Gill Sans 
Ultra Bold, which is exactly what its name suggests. But it isn’t another 
typeface for Gill Sans; it is its own font family.
 
5. Select the size you want to use.
 
 You can type a font size in the size box at the upper right of the Fonts 
window, you can click to select a font from the scrolling list of font sizes, 
or you can use the slider at the far right of the Fonts window to quickly 
move to the size you want.

44
Part I: Introducing iWork ’09 
You can close the Fonts window, if you want, by clicking its close button. If 
you do more formatting, however, just click in your iWork document window 
and keep working; the Fonts window remains open behind the document 
window
Previewing fonts
If you select text in your document (rather than using the insertion point to 
set the font for new text that hasn’t been typed), you can see the selected 
text change as you work with the Fonts window. But what do you do if you 
want to experiment directly in the Fonts window?
Use the small dot in the top center of the Fonts window, shown in Figure 2-26, 
to pull down an area that provides a live preview of your selection, as shown 
in Figure 2-27.
 
Figure 2-27: 
See your 
font choices 
in action.
 
Setting basic effects
At the top of the Fonts window is a set of controls for font effects. You can 
show or hide this area using the Fonts panel actions, which you display using 
the gear icon in the lower left of the Fonts window.
 
If you’re using the preview feature of the Fonts window, be aware that it 
reflects the choices for font family, typeface, and font size. The settings for 
font effects, such as underlining and color, are shown just below the preview 
pane in the Effects pane, but they aren’t shown in the preview pane.

45
 Chapter 2: Working Effectively
 
Actions are menus that pop up from a window. They’re always shown with the 
gear icon. Figure 2-28 shows the Fonts window actions.
 
Figure 2-28: 
Fonts 
window 
actions.
 
The first four buttons for font effects provide common controls:
 
✓ Underlining: The icon with an underlined T sets underlining. Use the 
pop-up menu to choose from None, Single, Double, and Color. The Color 
option is a single underline with the color you choose. You already 
know how to choose the color. Select this choice and the Colors window 
opens.
 
✓ Strikethrough: The icon with a T and a strikethrough bar sets the 
options for strikethrough settings. They’re the same as for underlining.
 
✓ Text color: The third icon opens the Colors window to let you set the 
text color.
 
✓ Paragraph color: The fourth icon opens the Colors window to let you 
set the paragraph’s background color.
Applying text shadows
The five controls at the right of the Effects pane all control text shadows.
 
Shadowed text isn’t as easy to read as unshadowed text. Use it for headlines 
and labels — short sections of big letters.
Here is how to set up text shadows:
 
1. Select the text you want to shadow.
 
2. Open the Fonts window by clicking the Font button on the toolbar or 
by choosing Format➪Font➪Show Fonts.

46
Part I: Introducing iWork ’09 
 
3. Click the text shadow button (fifth from the left in the Fonts window).
 
 This toggles text shadowing on and off. The text shadow button should 
be highlighted. If it isn’t, click it again.
 
4. The slider to the right of the text shadow button changes the opacity 
of the shadow.
 
 Move the slider to the right to make the shadow more opaque. You may 
want to experiment with the sliders in their most extreme positions to 
see their effects. Keep watching the selected text in the iWork document 
window to see what happens.
 
 Click elsewhere in the document to deselect the text: It’s hard to distin-
guish between the highlighting of the selection and the text shadowing.
 
5. The next slider blurs the far edge of the shadow more (to the right) or 
less (to the left).
 
6. The final slider moves the shadow farther away from the text it shad-
ows. (This is called the offset.)
 
 If you’re experimenting, try moving this slider all the way to the right. 
That lets you see the shadow clearly. If you’re having trouble, choose 
View➪Zoom➪Zoom In to zoom the window. You can also use the zoom 
control at the left of the bottom window frame of your iWork document.
 
7. Drag the wheel to set the angle for the shadow.
 
 A setting such as 320 degrees usually looks good. On a computer screen, 
most people are used to an assumed light source at the upper left of the 
screen, so shadows normally are drawn below and to the right of the 
object they shadow.
Customizing typography
You can gain even more control over your fonts by using typography options 
that are supported for some fonts. Here is how to gain access to the typogra-
phy options:
 
1. In your iWork document, select the text to which you want to apply 
the typography options.
 
2. In the Fonts window, select the font.
 
3. Choose Typography from the Fonts window actions (the gear icon at 
the bottom of the window).
 
 The Typography dialog shown in Figure 2-29 opens.
 
 The typography options vary for each font. Some fonts support none of 
them; others such as Helvetica Neue and Hoefler Text support many of 
them.

47
 Chapter 2: Working Effectively
 
Figure 2-29:

Managing collections
Collections are sets of fonts that you want to be able to find quickly. You can 
add any fonts to your collections. By default, the following collections are 
provided for you: All Fonts, English, Favorites, and Recently Used.
If you want to add a new collection, click the add button (the + symbol) 
below the Collections column in the Fonts window. You can name your col-
lection; it will be alphabetized automatically.
To remove a collection (but not the fonts within it), select it and then click 
the delete (– symbol) button below the Collections column.
To add a font family to a collection, just drag it in. To remove it, drag it out. 
This affects only the collection: Nothing happens to the font itself.
 
The Fonts window Actions menu lets you add a selected font family to the 
Favorites collection.

Tooling around the Toolbar
In This Chapter
▶ Customizing the toolbar
▶ Drawing and modifying shapes
▶ Working with tables and charts
T
oolbars are an integral part of the Mac OS X user interface. Although 
each application’s toolbar is different (and not all applications have tool-
bars), the basics of the toolbar are managed by Mac OS X.
This chapter introduces you to the iWork toolbar. Each application has its 
own toolbar, but many of the commands on the toolbar are similar (often the 
same) for all iWork applications.
Looking at the Toolbar
Figure 3-1 shows an iWork toolbar for Keynote. Every toolbar button causes 
an immediate action that is visible in the document. The buttons on the tool-
bar perform commands; sometimes these commands are also available on 
the menu.
In the default view, the buttons have both text and an icon. When you cus-
tomize the toolbar, you can change the default view so that only the text or 
only the icon is shown. For example, Figure 3-2 shows a Pages toolbar with 
only text on the toolbar buttons.
Many toolbar buttons add an object to the document. In Figure 3-1, the 
New button adds a slide (because this is the Keynote toolbar), and the 
Text Box, Table, and Comment buttons add a text box, table, and comment, 
respectively.

The icons for toolbar buttons often have small variants in their images. Most 
common is the downward-pointing arrow, which brings up a pop-up menu 
for that toolbar. In Figure 3-1, menus are available for View, Themes, Masters, 
Shapes, Charts, and Smart Builds.

51
 Chapter 3: Tooling around the Toolbar
Often the menu for a toolbar button lets you add a particular type of object 
to the document (a specific type of shape, for example). Other times, the 
menu lets you choose various options. Figure 3-3 is the menu for the View 
button in Keynote; you can use the menu to choose which parts of the 
window to show or hide. The View button contains the same commands as 
the View menu.
 
Figure 3-3:

window to

You can customize the toolbar, but the default toolbar has a consistency 
across the iWork applications.
The toolbar buttons on the left side
For example, the left side of each app’s toolbar provides application-specific 
toolbar buttons:
 
✓ Numbers: The first toolbar buttons at the left display the Numbers View 
menu and add a sheet to your Numbers document.
 
✓ Keynote: The first toolbar buttons in Keynote create a new slide and 
play your presentation. Next, pop-up toolbar buttons let you choose 
views, themes, and slide masters.
 
✓ Pages: The first toolbar buttons in Pages are the View menu and the 
Sections menu, which lets you insert a new section in your Pages word 
processing document. For page layout documents, the Pages View menu 
is accompanied by a Pages menu that lets you add page layout pages.

52
Part I: Introducing iWork ’09 
The toolbar buttons in the center
All buttons in the center of the toolbar add objects to the current document. 
For Pages and Keynote, these toolbar buttons let you add text boxes, shapes, 
tables, charts, and comments; you can also turn track changes on and off. In 
Numbers, you can add tables, insert functions, and reorganize (sort) your data.
The toolbar buttons on the right side
The buttons to the right of the toolbar open other windows or dialogs. 
In Figure 3-1, they open the Inspector window, Colors window, and Fonts 
window. This chapter focuses on the default set of toolbar buttons. Because 
you can customize the toolbar, you may have other buttons in your toolbar.
Using the Toolbar View Button 
to Customize the Window
Towards the left of each iWork toolbar is a View button that displays a 
pop-up menu. (The Keynote View pop-up menu was shown in Figure 3-3.) 
You can use the menu to show or hide parts of your iWork window, such as 
rulers, the format bar, or comments. Each window can have its own settings, 
which are preserved with the document.
Three areas of the window can be shown or hidden for any iWork app:
 
✓ Rulers: Rulers appear around the main part of the window to help you 
position objects precisely. You can adjust the settings for rulers in each 
application’s Preferences window.
 
✓ Format bar: Located just below the toolbar, the format bar lets you 
format text and other objects.
 
✓ Left pane: Located on the side of an iWork window, the left pane con-
tains program-specific information. You can click any image in the left 
pane to select it or to navigate to it in the main part of the window. In 
Keynote, the pane can contain images of master slides as well as slides. 
In Pages, the pane can contain page thumbnails or a search box. In 
Numbers, the pane can contain sheets and tables. The View menu identi-
fies the individual items in the left pane (such as master slides); the left 
pane itself is not shown in the View menu.
 
✓ Main window: Other options in the View menu control what is shown in 
the main part of the window, such as presenter notes (Keynote), invis-
ible characters (Pages), and a formula list (Numbers).

53
 Chapter 3: Tooling around the Toolbar
 
If you aren’t certain what a certain interface element is called, experiment with 
showing and hiding the various items in the View menu. As soon as you find 
the command that hides or shows the element you’re interested in, you will 
find its name.
Creating Shapes
You can create shapes in any iWork application. Shapes can have colors, bor-
ders, and other attributes that you set with inspectors. You also can click in a 
shape and type text within it. All shapes except lines can contain text.
Shapes work the same way in all iWork applications. Usually, the toolbar is 
the easiest way to create shapes. iWork has two kinds of shapes:
 
✓ Predrawn shapes: iWork can create predrawn shapes such as circles 
and arrows. You can modify predrawn shapes.
 
✓ Custom shapes: Draw any shape that you want. You can constrain the 
shape to horizontal or vertical as well as to a regular shape (that is, a 
circle instead of an oval, or a square instead of a rectangle).
 
Inspectors are the interface elements that let you change settings such as 
colors, line widths, arrowheads, and the distance created around a shape as 
you move it through other objects. You can also use an inspector to place an 
image in an object. This chapter shows you how to use inspectors.
Inserting a predrawn shape 
from the toolbar
Follow these steps to insert a predrawn shape from the toolbar in any iWork 
document:
 
1. Click Shapes on the toolbar.
 
 Hold down the mouse button to bring up the menu of shapes shown in 
Figure 3-4.
 
 The bottom shape is the custom shape. You use custom shape later in 
the chapter.
 
2. Select the shape you want.
 
 The shape is inserted in the center of the document. Later, you find out 
how to move it, resize it, and modify it.

54
Part I: Introducing iWork ’09 
 
Figure 3-4: 
Select a 
shape to 
insert.
 
Inserting a predrawn shape 
with the mouse
You can use the mouse to add a predrawn shape in the size and location that 
you want. Here’s how:
 
1. Create or open your iWork document.
 
2. Hold down the Option key while you click the Shape button on the 
toolbar.
 
3. Using the mouse, draw the shape.
 
 As you move the mouse, the size of the shape grows or shrinks. Also, 
instead of automatically being placed in the center of the document as is 
the case when you use the Insert command in the menu bar, the shape 
is placed where you started drawing it.
Inserting a shape from the menu bar
Finally, you can use the Insert menu command to insert a shape rather than 
using the toolbar:

55
 Chapter 3: Tooling around the Toolbar
 
1. Open or create your iWork document.
 
2. Choose Insert➪Shape➪<the kind of shape you want>.
 
 The shape is created. If you want to edit it, continue with the next 
section.
Editing a shape
Once you’ve created a shape in any of the ways I just described, you can 
change it. Click the shape to select it, and you see a bounding box and eight 
handles, small boxes along the bounding box, as shown in Figure 3-5.
 
Figure 3-5: 
Select a 
shape to 
show its 
handles.
 
Four handles are in the corners of the shape; the other four are located at the 
midpoints of the bounding box. The bounding box is the smallest rectangle 
that can contain the shape. Even if the shape is not rectangular, it will fit 
inside a rectangle. Shapes such as triangles have a different number of sides, 
but the functionality is the same.
Here are the types of edits you can perform on a shape:
 
✓ Resize the shape: Drag one of the four corner handles to enlarge or 
reduce a shape’s size.
 
✓ Reshape the shape: Drag one of the four midpoint handles to change 
the shape’s proportions. The midpoint handle in the top line moves the 
top line up and down; the midpoint handle in the bottom line moves that 
line up and down. Similarly, the midpoint handles on the left and right 
lines move them in and out.

56
Part I: Introducing iWork ’09 
 
✓ Move the shape: Drag inside the bounding box to move the entire shape. 
Don’t use one of the handles because that will resize or reshape the 
shape.
 
✓ Change special sizes: Some shapes have additional handles:
 
• Arrow depth: A small handle lets you vary the length of the arrow 
shaft.
 
• Double-arrow width: The double-headed arrow has a tiny handle 
in the center of the shape that you can drag back and forth to 
change the distance between the two arrowheads.
 
• Star and polygon points: When you select a star or polygon, a 
slider below the shape lets you change the number of points, as 
shown in Figure 3-6. Note the small round handle between two of 
the points. Drag it in or out to make the valley deeper or shallower.
 
Figure 3-6: 
Change the 
number of 
points.
 
Editing a shape’s geometry
The changes to a shape described in the preceding section don’t change the 
basic geometry of a shape. The formula that describes a circle, a rectangle, 
or another shape is the same regardless of its values. For example, a circle 
is always round; a rectangle is always rectangular, with four sides. A special 
case of a rectangle is a square with four sides of identical length.
There are many reasons for changing a shape’s geometry. Perhaps the most 
common is after you’ve created a shape and carefully set its size and color 
only to realize that it would look better as another shape. Editing the shape 
will preserve is color and other attributes. This section describes how you 
can change a shape’s geometry:

57
 Chapter 3: Tooling around the Toolbar
 
1. Select the shape you want to edit.
 
2. Choose Format➪Shape➪Make Editable.
 
 In addition to the handles, red circular controls appear in the middle of 
each arc of the shape, as shown in Figure 3-7.
 
Figure 3-7: 
Make a 
shape 
editable.
 
 
3. If you want to change an arc, drag the circular control to the new posi-
tion, as shown in Figure 3-8.

shape.

4. The clicked control has a control handle. Pull either end of the handle 
to change the arc.
 
 Compare Figure 3-8 with Figure 3-9 to see how these control handles 
modify the shape.
 
Figure 3-9: 
Change 
an arc.
 
Creating Tables and Charts
Charts and tables present data in a highly structured way, which can help 
to make your documents clearer. Numbers has its own very sophisticated 
tables, but Keynote and Pages also provide powerful tables.
Creating a table
In any iWork app, click Table on the toolbar to create a table, as you can see 
in Figure 3-10. Just as with shapes, if you hold down the Option key while you 
click Table, you can then draw the table where you want it.
As you can see, tables, like shapes, have handles in their corners and the 
midpoints of each side. You can drag the handles and resize just as you drag 
and resize shapes. The default table for Pages documents has three columns, 
a header, and three rows beneath the header. In Keynote, the default table 
is a simple three by three table. (In Numbers, much more specific tables are 
provided; they are described in Chapter 12.)

59
 Chapter 3: Tooling around the Toolbar
 
Figure 3-10: 
Create 
tables in 
Keynote 
and Pages 
documents.
 
When you create a table, Table inspector opens immediately so that you can 
further customize the table. The next chapter shows you how to use Table 
inspector.)
Creating charts
Pages charts are among the most sophisticated and simple features of the 
Pages program. Click Charts on the toolbar to open the chart menu shown in 
Figure 3-11.
Two-dimensional charts are shown in the first column; three-dimensional 
charts are shown in the second. To create a chart type, simply click it, just 
like you click a shape or a table. If you hold down the Option key while you 
click a chart type, you can draw the chart in the location and size you want.
If you choose to create a two-dimensional chart such as the combined bar/
line chart, the chart itself behaves just like a shape or a table, with eight han-
dles, as you can see in Figure 3-12. A legend is also created (in Figure 3-12 it is 
above the chart) and is in its own draggable and resizable shape.
But there’s more. A floating window containing data for the chart is also 
opened. (The window is below the chart in Figure 3-12.) And still more! 
Chart inspector also opens. You’ll see how to use Chart inspector in the 
next chapter.

Figure 3-12:

61
 Chapter 3: Tooling around the Toolbar
You can edit the chart data in Chart Data Editor. You add rows or columns 
and switch how the chart is drawn. Pages takes care of everything for you. 
For example, suppose you want to change the value in Region 1 for 2007 from 
17 (the default value created by Pages) to 170. You type the new value in the 
Region 1/2007 field, and leave the field by clicking out of it or by pressing 
the tab key. (Until you leave the field to finish editing the data, Pages will not 
redraw the chart.)
As shown in Figure 3-13, Pages not only moves the point but also rescales 
the chart so that the value of 170, which is significantly larger than any value 
in Figure 3-12, is shown properly. There’s more on Chart Data Editor 
in Chapter 15.
 
Figure 3-13: 
Edit the 
chart data.
 
If you’ve chosen a three-dimensional chart, you get one more item: a con-
troller for the chart’s position in three-dimensional space. The controller is 
shown in the upper left of Figure 3-14. As you drag the arrows up and down 
or right and left, the chart rotates (but the controller stays still). Notice that 
as you move the chart in space, its shadow adjusts appropriately.

Including Comments
You can add comments to your iWork documents by clicking the Comment 
button on the toolbar or by choosing Insert➪Comment. You can then show 
or hide those comments using the View button on the toolbar or the View 
menu.
Customizing the Toolbar
The last point to notice about toolbars is that you can customize them, as 
shown in Figure 3-15. You open this dialog by choosing View➪Customize 
Toolbar or by Ctrl-clicking (or right-clicking) anywhere on the toolbar to 
bring up the contextual menu for the toolbar, from which you can choose the 
Customize Toolbar command.

63
 Chapter 3: Tooling around the Toolbar
 
Figure 3-15: 
Customize 
your toolbar.
 
Drag icons into or out of the toolbar. The existing icons will move aside (or 
move together) as necessary. Notice that you have some special icons, such 
as the spaces at the bottom of the set of icons. You can use those or separa-
tors (vertical lines) to organize your toolbar. In the lower left, you can choose 
icons and text, text only, or icons only as well as the size of the icons. It’s 
your toolbar, so make it comfortable to use.
You can also command-click the toolbar button to cycle through two sizes of 
text only and two sizes of icons only as well as the combination of text and 
icons.
All toolbars on Mac OS X have one additional feature: You can always move 
the default icons as a single group by dragging them from the bottom of the 
customization dialog.

Inspecting the Inspectors
In This Chapter
▶ Formatting text
▶ Filling objects with color
▶ Adding images to your docs
▶ Cropping and adjusting images
▶ Adjusting tables and charts
I
nspectors let you inspect and adjust settings for whatever you’ve selected 
in the current document: a paragraph, an image, or the entire document. 
They compress a large amount of information and functionality into a small 
and well-organized tool.
Using Inspectors
One icon that is always present on the toolbar is the Inspector icon, towards 
the right. Click it to open an Inspector window. You can also choose View➪
Show Inspector. Figure 4-1 shows a typical inspector used with a Business 
Card template in Pages.
The Business Card template has a number of identical parts so that you can 
print multiple business cards on a perforated sheet that you buy in an office 
supply store. Because this is a page layout document, you can move the indi-
vidual card images around so that they align properly with the perforated 
sheet. You select a part by clicking it.

66

Use inspec-
tors to view

An inspector is always up-to-date, showing information about the current 
selection in the active window of the application. If you switch from one doc-
ument to another or select another item, the inspector’s data is updated, as 
you can see in Figure 4-2. In Figure 4-1, the document as a whole is selected; 
in Figure 4-2, a single part of the document (a single business card) has been 
selected, and you can see its location in the X and Y coordinates. (Details of 
this inspector are described later in the chapter in the section, “Check and 
set positions with Metrics Inspector.”) If you’ve selected multiple items in a 
document, inspector displays composite information about all of them.
 
Figure 4-2:

matically 
updated.
 

67
 Chapter 4: Inspecting the Inspectors
An Inspector window is an efficient way of presenting information about 
a selected object in an iWork document. Across the top of the Inspector 
window, buttons let you select specific inspectors that the Inspector can 
show. For example, clicking the T button causes the Inspector to display Text 
inspector. If you hover the pointer over any button or other control in the 
Inspector window, you’ll see a description of what it does.
 
Inspectors present a remarkable amount of information in a small space. The 
information varies depending on which application you’re using and what is 
selected. The inspector for page layout documents has about 125 separate 
settings in its ten inspectors, which you access with the ten buttons at the top 
of the Inspector window. Many of the settings are described in this section 
and in later chapters for each of the applications. As you use the Inspector 
window, feel free to explore any of the settings that interest you. Inspectors 
for Numbers and Keynote documents have their own inspectors with their 
own settings.
In Figure 4-2, the inspector is shown for a Pages page layout document. 
Most of the buttons across the top are used in the other iWork applications, 
although they are sometimes in a different order, and some applications have 
additional buttons. From left to right, these are the buttons in Figure 4-2 and 
the inspectors that they display in the Inspector window:
 
✓ Document inspector: This is the leftmost inspector in all cases; it con-
tains information about the document. For Pages and Numbers docu-
ments, it lets you set margins. For all documents in all applications, it 
lets you set a password for the document.
 
✓ Layout inspector: Only for Pages documents, this inspector lets you set 
columns and page numbering.
 
✓ Wrap inspector: This inspector lets you control how text wraps around 
the selected object in the document.
 
✓ Text inspector: The Text inspector is where you can control spacing 
in paragraphs, alignment, tabs, and other text settings. It controls just 
about everything involving text except the selection of fonts and styles 
such as bold or italics. (Those are set with the Fonts window.)
 
✓ Graphic inspector: Set graphic borders, fills, shadow, and opacity with 
Graphic inspector.
 
✓ Metric inspector: Use Metric inspector to set size, rotation, and absolute 
position.
 
✓ Table inspector: Table inspector lets you format tables, add or delete 
rows, and sort data.
 
✓ Chart inspector: Use Chart inspector to set everything from the light 
source to the color of the chart. Also use it to edit the chart’s data.

68
Part I: Introducing iWork ’09 
 
✓ Link inspector: Use Link inspector to establish hyperlinks in your docu-
ments. (In Pages, it also controls merge fields.)
 
✓ QuickTime inspector: QuickTime inspector controls embedded 
QuickTime movies.
In some cases, you want to see information about several aspects of the 
selected object. You can do that by opening multiple Inspector windows. 
Simply hold down the Option key while clicking the Inspector button on the 
toolbar or choose View➪New Inspector. You can have as many inspectors 
open as you want.
 
All inspectors always display information about the current selection in the 
active window. The selection can be an object such as a picture or a paragraph, 
a word, or even a single character that you have selected with the mouse.
Formatting Text with Text Inspector
Before you can format text, you first open Text inspector. Here’s how to 
do that:
 
1. Select the text you want to format.
 
2. Open an inspector if necessary.
 
 If no inspector is open, open one by choosing View➪Show Inspector or 
by clicking Inspector on the toolbar.
 
3. Click the T button in the top row to open Text inspector.
 
4. Click the Text tab, as shown in Figure 4-3.
 
Figure 4-3: 
The Text 
tab in Text 
inspector is 
the same 
for all appli-
cations.
 

69
 Chapter 4: Inspecting the Inspectors
Text inspector settings control text in the environment of a document (or 
part of a document). Any fonts and font settings you’ve already set in the 
Fonts window or may set in the future aren’t involved in these settings. The 
sole exception is text color, which can be set in both the Fonts window and 
Text inspector.
Colors & Alignment settings
The first section of the Text pane in Text inspector controls the colors 
and alignment of the selected text. The first button opens the same Colors 
window you saw in Chapter 3.
Next, a set of five buttons lets you handle the horizontal alignment (called the 
justification) for the selected text. From the left, the buttons set the alignment to:
 
✓ Left
 
✓ Centered
 
✓ Right
 
✓ Fully justified: Adds small spaces between characters so that the left 
and right margins are the same for all lines
 
✓ Text/Number alignment: If available, aligns text in a table cell to the left 
(normal position) and aligns numbers in a table cell to the right (normal 
position)
The final set of alignment buttons aligns text vertically within a container 
such as a shape or a text box. (It doesn’t apply to Pages word processing 
documents themselves because the document itself isn’t within a container.) 
The choices are top, center, and bottom.
Spacing settings
You can adjust spacing between characters horizontally, between lines of 
text vertically, before or after paragraphs, and between the text itself and 
the boundaries of its container (if any — Pages word processing documents 
don’t have containers).
All of these settings use variations on the same interface shown previously in 
Figure 4-3. The value for each setting is a number: a percentage in the case of 
character spacing, a number of lines in the case of line spacing, and points in 
the case of the other three values. You can set these numbers in three ways:

70
Part I: Introducing iWork ’09 
 
✓ Use the horizontal slider to increase or decrease the value.
 
✓ Use the stepper (the arrows) to increase or decrease the value by 1.
 
✓ Type the value you want to use into the box.
The defaults for each type of spacing and the reasons for changing them are 
listed here:
 
✓ Character spacing: This is expressed as a percentage. Its default value 
is 0, which makes the font look as it was intended to look in most cases. 
Character spacing is also known as tracking. In some large font sizes, the 
spaces between the characters look too big; often, tracking is reduced 
for such cases.
 
 Other times you may be tempted to change character spacing because 
it looks peculiar. Before you change the tracking, check out other tech-
niques for solving the issue. For example, in some fonts you can use 
ligatures — special spacing for pairs of specific adjacent letters such 
as fi. In the case of fonts with a typographic option, turn on ligatures 
in the Fonts window if certain pairs of characters appear too far apart. 
Conversely, if a pair of characters appears too close, consider turning 
ligatures off. If a particular pair of characters (such as fi) always looks 
wrong, it’s probably a ligature issue.
 
 Another situation to consider is fully justified text when the lines of text 
are short. In the case of a typical line of text in a book, full justification 
works well because there are several inches of text to work with. Narrow 
columns (such as a newspaper column), however, may not have enough 
text to work with. This effect is exacerbated if the line of text contains 
several long words. You can solve this by adjusting tracking, by turning 
off full justification, or by rewording.
 
✓ Line spacing: In the old days of typewriters, line spacing choices were 
single, double, or occasionally triple spacing. Because the typeface was 
fixed, the height of the line needed to display the tallest character was 
known. These choices are still available, as shown in the pop-up menu 
in Figure 4-4. But today you can change fonts, typefaces, and font sizes 
within a line, so the height of a line of text is no longer so easy to cal-
culate. In the menu in Figure 4-4, Single and Double basically have their 
classic meanings; Multiple simply means that the line space isn’t an inte-
ger, for example, 1.5 line space.
 
Figure 4-4: 
Enhance 
other line 
spacing 
options.
 

71
 Chapter 4: Inspecting the Inspectors
 
 The system calculates the height of the line from the top of characters 
to the bottom of descenders. (Descenders are those parts of characters 
such as g and y that extend below the baseline, which is the bottom of 
characters such as e and x.)
 
 The three other settings for line spacing follow:
 
• At Least: iWork uses your line spacing setting unless a large char-
acter in a line of text would overlap the preceding line, in which 
case additional space is used. Less space than specified will never 
be used.
 
• Exactly: No exceptions are made to the settings you have selected 
no matter what the result looks like.
 
• Between: The line spacing you indicate provides a blank space 
between lines. For example, triple spacing will produce a line 
height three times the normal line height. If you choose the 
Between option, the line height will be standard but a space the 
size of two standard-size blank lines will lie empty above that 
single line’s height.
 
✓ Before/After Paragraph: These settings specify the size (in points) 
of the space before or after a paragraph. These numbers aren’t addi-
tive. If you specify a space of 72 points after a paragraph (72 points = 1 
inch) and a space of 144 points before the next paragraph (144 points 
= 2 inches), the space between those paragraphs will be 2 inches: the 
higher, not the sum, of the two values. The space before the first para-
graph is always 0; the space after the last paragraph is also 0.
 
✓ Inset Margin: For a paragraph that you place within an object such as 
a text box, this is the inset from each side. You cannot specify separate 
values for each side.
Formatting Graphics with 
Graphic Inspector
As you can see in Figure 4-5, Graphic inspector has five main sections. Not 
all of them are available for selected graphic objects. For example, a graphic 
object that doesn’t contain an image cannot be shown with an apparent 
mirror reflection of the image. The five sections of Graphic inspector let you 
adjust the following attributes of objects:
 
✓ Fill: You can fill selected objects with solid colors, images, gradients, or 
combinations of images and colors.
 
✓ Stroke: You can set the attributes for a line object or the line that bor-
ders an object. The attributes you can set are color, the line width, its 
endpoints (arrows), and its appearance (solid, dashed, and so forth).

72
Part I: Introducing iWork ’09 
 
Figure 4-5: 
Use Graphic 
inspector.
 
 
✓ Shadow: Set a shadow for the selected object. The settings are the same 
as for text shadowing, described in Chapter 3, except instead of using 
the outline of text characters for the shadow, you select a color from the 
Colors window to shadow the exact shape of the selected object.
 
✓ Reflection: If an object contains an image, this setting automatically pro-
duces a reflection of the image outside the object with greater or lesser 
opacity. It is generally best to use either a shadow or a reflection; using 
both produces peculiar results.
 
✓ Opacity: This setting lets you choose whether the object hides any-
thing behind it (100%), is totally transparent (0%), or is somewhere in 
between. Note that the setting is for the entire graphic object; you can 
separately set opacity for its border (using Stroke settings) or its center 
(using Fill).
Beyond the general settings described here, you can do some simple tasks 
with Graphic inspector, such as
 
✓ Fill an object with color
 
✓ Create a gradient fill
 
✓ Place an image inside a graphic
 
✓ Use a tinted image fill

 Chapter 4: Inspecting the Inspectors
Filling an object with color
The settings for shadows, opacity, and reflection are similar to settings you 
have already seen for text in Chapter 3. Here’s how to fill an object with a 
color:
 
1. Select the object you want to fill with a color.
 
2. Display an inspector.
 
3. Click the Graphic button to display Graphic inspector.
 
4. Select Color Fill from the Fill pop-up menu.
 
 A color well appears.
 
5. Use the color well to select the color you want.
 
6. If you want to adjust the opacity, use the Opacity setting.
Creating a gradient fill
In iWork a gradient is a pattern that changes from one color at one side to 
another color at the opposite side. Gradients can provide elegant effects in 
your documents, but they also can lead you astray. If your document will be 
printed, test the gradient effect on a printer as early in the process as you 
can. Different types of printers handle colors in different ways. What appears 
as a smooth gradient transition on your screen may have ugly bars and be 
not at all smooth or elegant on some printers — particularly those designed 
for black-and-white printing.
To create a gradient fill, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the object you want to fill with a gradient.
 
2. Open or create an Inspector window.
 
 Choose View➪Show Inspector, View➪New Inspector, or click Inspector 
on the toolbar.
 
3. Click the Graphic button to display Graphic inspector.
 
4. Select Gradient Fill from the Fill pop-up menu at the top of Graphic 
inspector, as shown in Figure 4-6.
 
5. Use the color wells to select the colors to start and end the gradient. 
(The top color well is the starting color.)
 
 If you select a color with an opacity of less than 100 percent, it appears 
with a diagonal bar through it in Graphic inspector. On the screen or 
when printed, the opacity effect is generated and the bar is not shown.

Figure 4-6:

object with 
a gradient 
fill.
 
 
6. In the Fill area, select the angle of the gradient.
 
 You have three ways to select the angle. The right-pointing arrow auto-
matically selects 0 degrees; the downward-pointing arrow selects 270 
degrees. Use the wheel to select any other angle, or use the text box to 
enter the angle.
Placing an image inside a graphic
One of the most common tasks is to fill a graphic object with an image. There 
are many reasons for placing an image inside an object rather than just 
inserting the image (or pasting it) into the document itself. First, inside an 
object, the image can be framed or highlighted by the object itself. Second, 
if your images are of different sizes, you can place them inside objects of the 
same size, shape, and orientation to make your document look cleaner.
Here’s how to place an image inside a graphic:
 
1. Select the object you want to fill with an image.
 
2. Display an inspector.
 
3. Click the Graphic button to display Graphic inspector.
 
4. Select Image Fill from the Fill pop-up menu, as shown in Figure 4-7.

75
 Chapter 4: Inspecting the Inspectors
 
Figure 4-7: 
Use Image 
Fill.
 
 
5. Click the Choose button and select an image file to insert into the 
graphic object.
 
 A small version of the graphic appears in the Inspector window.
 
 You’ve seen a color well; the similar looking object in Figure 4-7 that 
contains the image is called an image well. Once Graphic inspector is 
open, you can drag a file from Finder into the image well rather than 
clicking the Choose button.
 
6. Scale the image.
 
 A small pop-up menu (set to Tile in Figure 4-7) is now available. These 
are the possible settings, as shown in Figure 4-8.
 
Figure 4-8: 
Scale the 
image.
 
 
• Scale to Fit: If the image and the object have the same dimensions, 
the image simply is placed in the object. If the dimensions are dif-
ferent, the image is resized as best as possible. In some cases, part 
of the object may not be shown. Scale to Fit is a quick way to scale 
an image in which the center is the most important part and it 
doesn’t matter if you can’t see some of the edges.

76
Part I: Introducing iWork ’09 
 
• Scale to Fill: In this case, the image is kept as large as possible, but 
all of it is shown. In some cases, this may leave fairly large sections 
at the top or sides. This is a good choice if you want to make cer-
tain that the entire image is shown.
 
• Stretch: The image fills the object. If they’re different shapes, 
the image is distorted as necessary. This sometimes works well 
with images when you don’t care a great deal about the detail. If 
you stretch an image of a pine forest, the pine trees may turn out 
taller or wider than they are in the original image, but as long as 
the image and object are roughly the same shape, the trees in the 
image will still be recognizable as pine trees.
 
• Original Size: The image isn’t resized. It may not all be visible in 
the object.
 
• Tile: This is like the Original Size setting, but if the image is smaller 
than the object, the image is repeated (at its original size) as many 
times as necessary to fill the object.
Using a tinted image fill
The last choice for filling an object is Tinted Image Fill, which combines an 
image and a color. Here’s how to do that:
 
1. Select the object you want to fill with an image.
 
2. Display an inspector.
 
3. Click the Graphic button to display Graphic inspector.
 
4. Select Tinted Image Fill from the Fill pop-up menu, as shown in 
Figure 4-9.
 
5. Click the Choose button and select an image file to insert into the 
graphic object.
 
 A small version of the graphic appears in the image well, below the Fill 
menu.
 
6. Scale the image.
 
 For details, see Step 6 in the preceding section.
 
7. Use the image well to select the color to use.
 
 The Choose button selects an image file for the image well; clicking the 
image well brings up the Colors window so you can choose a color. The 
diagonal line in the image well indicates that the color isn’t opaque. (If 
the color is opaque, you will not see the image and the entire process is 
pointless: Just use the Color Fill option.)

77
 Chapter 4: Inspecting the Inspectors
 
Figure 4-9: 
Use Tinted 
Image Fill.
 
The settings for shadows, opacity, and reflection are similar to settings you 
have already seen for text in Chapter 3.
Choosing stroke settings
The only other item in the Graphic inspector to examine is the Stroke settings. 
When you select a graphic object, you can set the stroke of its border — the 
color, width, and type of line (solid, dotted, or dashed). In addition, certain 
types of graphic objects are basically lines with a beginning and an end. For 
those, you can set the type of endpoint as shown in Figure 4-10 if you have 
chosen Line from the pop-up menu in the Stroke area.
Adding Images to Your Documents
You can add images to any iWork document. Use Insert➪Choose to select the 
file you want to insert. Once the file is inserted in your iWork document, you 
can move and adjust it. You make some of these adjustments with Metrics 
inspector or Graphic inspector; others you do by directly manipulating the 
images.

78
Part I: Introducing iWork ’09 
 
Figure 4-10: 
Set stroke 
options.
 
Masking images with shapes
When you have a graphic in an iWork document, you can mask it with shapes 
so that only part of the image is shown. This replaces the cropping you may 
have performed in other applications. What appears is the part of the image 
that shows through the shape.
Follow these steps to mask an image:
 
1. Select an image in an iWork document.
 
2. Choose Format➪Mask to place a mask on top of the image.
 
 You can also choose Format➪Mask with Shape to use a predrawn shape 
such as a triangle or circle.
 
3. Drag the handles at the corners of the mask until it is the size and 
shape you want.
 
4. Drag the image until the part you want to show is over the mask.
 
5. Use the Edit Mask slider below the mask to enlarge or shrink the 
image itself.
 
 Figure 4-11 shows the process in action.

79
 Chapter 4: Inspecting the Inspectors
 
Figure 4-11: 
Experiment 
with the 
mask and 
the image.
 
 
6. Repeat Steps 3–5 until you’re satisfied. Then click out of the image.
 
 What is shown is only the part within the mask, as shown in Figure 4-12.
 
Figure 4-12: 
The image is 
masked.
 
Checking and setting positions 
with Metrics inspector
Metrics inspector, shown in Figure 4-13, lets you control the size and location 
of objects. For many people, the easiest way to arrange objects (including 
inserted graphic files) is by moving them around to the approximate position 
you want and then using the mouse to resize or reshape them. For finer con-
trol, however, you can specify exact coordinates for each object. iWork uses 
X/Y coordinates for the units you’ve chosen in Preferences. The origin (0,0) 
is the upper-left corner of the document.

80
Part I: Introducing iWork ’09 
 
Figure 4-13: 
Use Metrics 
inspector 
to position 
objects.
 
 
You can flip objects. You can also constrain an object’s proportions so that as 
you’re resizing it with the mouse, you don’t distort the image that it contains.
Adjusting images
Images can be used throughout iWork. You can use images as title graphics 
identifying chapters or other sections of a document, but they frequently are 
used as the content of a document itself. Nothing prevents you from creating 
a spreadsheet in Numbers that contains columns of information about items: 
prices, names, and images.
For example, a chapter about the history of Quebec City might have an 
image of the 400-year-old city walls next to the chapter and the title. Within 
a chapter on sixteenth-century architecture, an image of Quebec City might 
be placed beside an image or another walled city so that the reader can com-
pare two or more styles of city wall construction.
Whether an image is used on its own or inserted into a graphic object, you 
can adjust the image inside iWork. The adjustments that you make apply only 
to the inserted image: The original image isn’t changed.
The adjustments that you can make are common to image manipulation; you 
can make the same adjustments in iPhoto, Aperture, and Photoshop.
Follow these steps to adjust an image in iWork:
 
1. Select the image in the iWork document.
 
2. Choose View➪Show Adjust Image to open the Adjust Image window, 
shown in Figure 4-14.

81
 Chapter 4: Inspecting the Inspectors

Using Media Browser
The basic media manipulation programs (iPhoto, iTunes, and iMovie) let you 
assemble images, audio, and movies into groups and categories. iWork Media 
Browser lets you browse these files in the categories you’ve created in the 
iLife applications. From Media Browser, you can drag media files into your 
iWork documents without worrying about where they’re stored on disk.
To display Media Browser, choose View➪Show Media Browser. The window 
shown in Figure 4-15 appears.
Once you’ve placed media files in your iWork documents, you can use 
QuickTime and other inspectors to adjust the appearance and behavior of 
the media files. In the case of images, you can place them inside objects as 
described previously in this chapter.
Adjusting Table Settings
When you create a table, Table inspector (see Figure 4-16) opens automati-
cally. If you’ll have to do something with an inspector to finish your current 
task, iWork opens it automatically, as is the case when you create a table. At 
any time, you can go back, open an inspector, and modify your settings.

 Chapter 4: Inspecting the Inspectors
Note the two tabs at the top of the window. You use the Table tab to control 
the general formatting of the table and the Format tab to control specific set-
tings for each cell.
Setting cell and table properties
Table inspector handles general table formatting. Seven sets of settings are 
available:
 
✓ Body Rows and Body Columns: Use the steppers (arrows) or type num-
bers to set the number of rows and columns in the table.
 
✓ Headers & Footer: Three buttons let you set left, top, and bottom head-
ers and footers. Each is a pop-up menu; you can select 0 to 5 rows or 
columns for each type of header and footer. The default value is 0.
 
✓ Edit Rows & Columns: To edit a row or column, first select a cell in 
the relevant row or column. Then click the action menu and make your 
choice (see Figure 4-17). To merge cells, you need to first select the cells 
to merge.
 
Figure 4-17: 
Edit rows 
and col-
umns with 
the action 
menu.
 
 
✓ Column Width and Row Height: Here’s where you adjust the settings 
for the column and row specified by the currently selected cell. If you 
select the entire table with a single click anywhere in the table, these 
settings apply to all rows and columns. You can click column or row bor-
ders as shown in Figure 4-18 to select them so that you can change their 
settings (such as color or line width in Table inspector) or to drag them 
to resize the columns or rows. (Note the double lines and the double-
headed arrows when the cursor is over a row or column.)
 
 In addition to setting column width and row heights, you can use the 
Automatically Resize to Fit Content check box in Table inspector for any 

84
Part I: Introducing iWork ’09 
selected cell, row, or column. iWork will adjust the table appropriately. 
This can leave you with different-sized cells, rows, or columns, but each 
one will be the right size for its data.
 
Figure 4-18: 
Drag row 
or column 
borders to 
select them.
 
 
✓ Cell Borders: Select a cell or group of cells and adjust their borders 
here. You can also select a row or column border as shown in Figure 
4-18 to format it using these controls. You can control the position of 
the borders (left, right, top, bottom, and so forth), the shape of the line 
(solid, dotted, or whatever), and its color by using the color well at the 
right of the Cell Borders section.
 
✓ Cell Background: The background for a cell can be set with the same 
options available for fills in Graphic inspector discussed previously in 
this chapter: none (the default), color fill, gradient fill, image fill, and 
tinted image fill.
 
✓ Table Options: You can let the Return key move to the next cell. If this 
option is turned off, the Return key functions simply to insert a Return 
within the cell so that you can create multiple lines or paragraphs within 
the cell.
Setting formats and formulas for cells
You use the Format tab in Table inspector to format selected cells. Basic 
cell formats for numbers, currency, date and time, and others are provided. 
When you choose a format, Table inspector changes to show the specific set-
tings for it. Figure 4-19 shows the Currency settings.

85

Setting a conditional format
In addition to setting a format for a cell, you can provide a conditional format 
that varies based on a condition you specify. Figure 4-20 shows an example of 
conditional formatting that you can construct for yourself to test. Conditional 
formatting has been applied to each cell in the Last Order column. The condi-
tion is simple: If sales have increased (that is, the last order is greater than 
the first order), make the Last Order cell background gray and display the 
text in bold and italic.
 
Figure 4-20: 
Conditional 
formatting 
changes a 
cell’s format

on data 
conditions.
 
Here’s how to construct conditional formatting:
 
1. Select a field in the Last Order column.
 
2. In the Format tab of Table inspector, click Show Rules.

86
Part I: Introducing iWork ’09 
 
 This opens the Conditional Format dialog shown in Figure 4-21.
 
Figure 4-21: 
The con-
ditional 
formatting 
rules dialog.
 
 
3. From the pop-up menu, choose Greater Than, as shown in Figure 4-22.
 
Figure 4-22: 
Select a cell 
to use in the 
comparison.
 
 
4. Select the cell or value to be used in the comparison.
 
 If this cell or value is greater than the value in the Last Order field, the con-
ditional formatting is applied. To use a specific value, type it in the value 
field to the right of the pop-up menu. To use the value in a cell for the com-
parison, click the blue oval to the right of the value field to open the cell 
reference field. Click the cell that contains the value you want to use.
 
5. Click the Edit button to specify how the cell should be formatted if the 
condition is true.
 
 As shown in Figure 4-23, you can set the text color; bold, italic, underline, 
or strikethrough formatting; and the fill color for the cell background.
 
Figure 4-23: 
Specify the 
formatting 
to use if 
the condi-
tion is true.
 

87
 Chapter 4: Inspecting the Inspectors
 
The comparison value or cell is part of the rule. If you copy and paste 
cells, that comparison value will not be adjusted automatically.
Setting a formula
Although tables are not full-fledged spreadsheets, they have many spread-
sheet features. For example, you can add a third column to the table shown 
in Figure 4-20 to display the order goal. A formula computes a 50 percent 
increase by multiplying the value in the Initial Order cell by 1.5. Here’s how 
to do it:
 
1. Create a new column.
 
 You can click a cell in the Last Order column and choose Add Column 
After from the action menu in the Edit Rows & Columns section of the 
Table tab.
 
2. Type Goal in the header of the new column.
 
3. Click in the first data cell of the Goal column.
 
4. From the Format pane of Table inspector, use the pop-up menu in the 
Function section at the bottom (see Figure 4-24) and choose Formula 
Editor.
 
 If you want, you can choose any of the other formulas that are built into 
iWork.
 
Figure 4-24: 
Select a 
formula or 
use Formula 
Editor.
 
 
5. In the formula reference field that opens above the selected cell, type 
your formula.
 
 You can use a combination of text and mouse clicks in the fields you 
want to use. In this case, click in the Initial Order field and type * 1.5 as 
shown in Figure 4-25.

88
Part I: Introducing iWork ’09 
 
Figure 4-25: 
Create the 
formula.
 
 
6. If the formula is correct, click the green check mark at the right to 
accept it.
 
 If you want to close the formula reference field without accepting the 
format, click the red X at the right.
 
7. Choose Format➪Table➪Fill➪Fill Down to fill the formula down the 
other cells in the column.
Adjusting Chart Settings
When you create a chart, Chart inspector opens automatically; you can also 
open it by clicking the inspector’s Chart button, as shown in Figure 4-26. 
Chart inspector provides you with detailed settings for your chart.
 
Figure 4-26: 
Use Chart 
inspector.
 

89
 Chapter 4: Inspecting the Inspectors
You’ll probably use the following settings most often:
 
✓ Edit Data: Click this button to open Chart Data Editor, which is shown in 
Figure 4-27.
 
✓ Show Title: This is the name of the chart.
 
✓ Show Legend: This lets you identify which chart elements refer to which 
data sets.
There’s more information on this topic in Chapter 15.
 
Figure 4-27: 
Use Chart 
Data Editor 
to edit the 
chart’s data.
 
Managing Links
Link inspector always has a Hyperlink tab, as shown in Figure 4-28.
Select the object you want to serve as a hyperlink, select the Enable as a 
hyperlink check box, and then specify the type of link from the pop-up menu 
shown in Figure 4-29.

links 
with Link 
inspector.
 
 
Figure 4-29:

type of link.
 
Perhaps the most important setting in Link inspector is the check box that 
allows you to make all hyperlinks inactive. You must do this to edit the links; 
otherwise, every time you click a link and try to edit it, it will be active and 
will take you to the link itself.
Setting QuickTime Options
The last inspector button lets you open the QuickTime inspector for a 
selected QuickTime object. You can set where the movie starts and stops, 
what the key frame is, how the movie repeats, and the movie’s volume.

Part II
Turning the Page 
with Pages

In this part . . .
P
ages is two applications in one: It lets you create 
word processing documents in much the way that 
you do with Microsoft Word, but you can also use it to 
create page layout documents much as you would do in 
Adobe InDesign or Quark Xpress.
Pages provides you with advanced tools such as auto-
matic creation of tables of contents as well as controls 
over page numbers in various sections of your docu-
ments. As with all the iWork applications, you can add 
graphics, QuickTime movies, charts and tables, and 
hyperlinks to your documents.
You see how in this part.

▶ Saving and printing documents
▶ Creating your own templates
F
or each of the three iWork applications, you’ll find that the basic tools 
described in Part I come into play. For example, although tables and 
charts in Numbers spreadsheets can be more complex than tables and charts 
in Pages and Keynote, the basics are the same.
Pages is the word processing application (and, in fact, it’s two word process-
ing applications).This chapter and the others in Part II provide an introduc-
tion to the features, tools, and technologies you find in Pages.
 
The basics of Mac OS X as well as of iWork apply to each iWork application, 
including Pages. For example, there’s nothing special about printing with 
Pages: It’s the way you print in any Mac OS X application. But before you relax 
completely, keep an eye out for printing in Numbers (see Chapter 16). Some 
Numbers-specific features reflect the fact that Numbers deals with spread-
sheets that can be much, much larger than individual pages.
Two Faces of Pages Documents
Pages lets you work with two different types of documents: word processing 
documents and page layout documents.
Word processing documents
A word processing document in Pages (as in any word processing program) 
lets you type what you want without worrying about page breaks and line 

94
Part II: Turning the Page with Pages 
breaks. If you type a sentence that is longer than the page is wide, Pages auto-
matically breaks the sentence where necessary and continues on the next line 
as you type. This is known as wrapping the line. Likewise, when you come to 
the bottom of the page, Pages creates a new page and continues your text on 
that page. This process continues for all your text as well as for any tables, 
pictures, or graphics that you add to it. Everything flows along from line to line 
and from page to page and even from column to column within multicolumn 
documents. Figure 5-1 shows a word processing document in Pages.
 
Figure 5-1: 
A Pages 
word pro-
cessing 
document.
 
You can manually control how Pages wraps text. You can use the Return or 
Enter key to start a new line. Likewise, you can insert a page break wherever 
you want to force Pages to begin a new page.
 
Other formatting techniques you can use for word processing documents are 
discussed in Chapters 6 and 7.
Page layout documents
A page layout document lets you design a page using objects that don’t move. 
The objects can be the same tables, pictures, and graphics that you can add 

95
 Chapter 5: Getting to Know Pages
to a word processing document, but they don’t flow. They stay where you 
place them. Figure 5-2 shows a page layout document.
 
Figure 5-2: 
A Pages 
page layout 
document.
 
As you can see in Figures 5-1 and 5-2, graphics can appear in both types 
of documents. In fact, you can’t tell by looking at a document which type 
of document it is. But when you open the document in Pages, you can tell 
immediately which type it is. If you were to type a new paragraph at the top 
of Figure 5-1, the graphics in the middle of the page would move down as that 
paragraph was inserted. If you were to type more text into the page layout 
document in Figure 5-2, the graphics wouldn’t move.
Text boxes
Everything on the page in a page layout document (such as the page shown 
in Figure 5-2) is a self-contained object that contains text or graphics and 
remains where you put it. A special kind of object is a text box. You can type 
text in a text box, and the text will flow and wrap just as it does in a word pro-
cessing document. Although it flows and wraps, it never extends beyond the 
text box, so the text box itself stays where you place it.

96
Part II: Turning the Page with Pages 
You can link text boxes so that text will flow automatically from one to the 
other. They’re particularly useful in newsletters and brochures where you 
might want to have several text boxes on the first page, each of which is 
linked to other text boxes later in the document that provide the continua-
tion of the text.
 
You can use text boxes in both word processing and page layout documents. 
If you place a text box within the flow of text in a word processing document, 
the text box provides a second set of flowed text within the main text flow. 
As you will see in Chapter 7, you can set options so that the text box itself 
stays put or flows as a single entity with the text in which it is embedded. 
Furthermore, you can place objects inside text boxes, so the text box can con-
tain flowing and wrapped text and graphics that will never extend beyond the 
boundaries of the text box. And if you want, you can place a text box inside a 
text box, but that is likely to produce a very strange looking document.
Document types
Choosing the right document type isn’t difficult. Each document type can 
contain the same objects (text, tables, shapes, and images); the main differ-
ence is whether the objects move as you type.
If you’re creating a letter, report, or novel, you probably want a word pro-
cessing document. You don’t want to worry about page breaks except when 
you manually insert them at the end of a chapter or section. If you add graph-
ics, you probably want them to flow with the text.
On the other hand, if you’re creating a flyer or brochure, you generally want 
things to stay where you place them. A one-page flyer must stay on one page. 
You can achieve this effect with a word processing document by watching 
how much text and other information you add to the document, but it is gen-
erally easier to use a page layout document.
In the cases of brochures and newsletters, you may want a distinct difference 
in the layout of the first and second pages. By using linked text boxes, you 
can type the text on the first page and let it flow automatically to a text box 
with a different format on a later page. Once you have set up the text boxes, 
Pages will take care of everything as you add or delete text: You don’t have to 
worry about the format.
 
You won’t find a Pages Police to tell you what type of document to use. Apple 
has given you the tools to achieve your goals in many ways. If you’re more 
comfortable working in word processing documents, you can make them 
look like page layout documents, although it will probably entail more work. 
If you’re more comfortable working in page layout documents and graphics 

97
 Chapter 5: Getting to Know Pages
programs, you can make them look like word processing documents. (You 
can even use Numbers to type letters and memos if you’re happier working in 
spreadsheets.)
Choosing Basic Templates
Throughout iWork, Apple provides you with templates for documents, 
spreadsheets, and presentations. These provide starting points for your own 
work. You can always start with a blank page and do everything yourself, but 
many people like to use a template either as-is or customize it. This section 
provides an introduction to the Pages templates.
Word processing templates
As you can see in Figure 5-3, Pages provides templates for a variety of types 
of word processing documents. The list of template types gives you an indi-
cation of the kind of documents that are usually created as word processing 
documents rather than page layout documents. The first category consists of 
blank documents that you can work with as you see fit. One is vertically ori-
ented (portrait) and the other is horizontally oriented (landscape).

When you select a category, Pages shows you the first page of the various 
templates available so that you can get an idea of the design. When you 
move the pointer over the first page, you see an interior page. If you want 
to explore a template in more depth, simply select it and click the Choose 
button, or double-click it. Either way, Pages will create a document based on 
the template.
Page layout templates
The page layout templates, shown in Figure 5-4, also begin with blank docu-
ments. Then you can see the types of documents that lend themselves to 
page layouts. As with word processing templates, you can get a preview of 
the documents and their design.

Creating a Document
As you can see, the multitude of templates in Pages lets you quickly get 
started creating effective and attractive documents. Now it’s time to begin 
creating your documents.

 Chapter 5: Getting to Know Pages
From a template
Creating a document from a template takes four simple steps:
 
1. Choose File➪New Document from Template Chooser or use the key-
board equivalent, ↑-Ô-N.
 
 This opens the Template Chooser dialog (refer to Figures 5-3 and 5-4).
 
2. Select the template category you want to use for either a word pro-
cessing or page layout document.
 
 For example, in Figure 5-4, the Newsletters template category is selected.
 
3. Select the specific template you want within the category.
 
4. Click the Choose button in the lower-right corner.
 
 The Template Chooser closes and your document is created.
From a default template
By default, the New command in the File menu functions exactly like 
File➪New Document from Template Chooser. However, you can set a prefer-
ence to bypass Template Chooser and automatically create a new document 
based on the same document template each time you choose File➪New. You 
do this with the Preferences window, which is shown in Figure 5-5.
Pages, like all iWork applications, lets you set preferences. These preferences 
apply to all documents you create and edit with the application. Here’s how 
to set preferences for Pages:
 
1. Open the Preferences window by choosing Pages➪Preferences or 
pressing Ô-, (comma).
 
2. Click the General button at the top of the window to show the General 
settings.
 
3. Click the Use Template radio button.
 
 This opens Template Chooser.
 
4. Select the default template you want to use for the New command.
 
 From now on, the New command will use that template. To change the 
default template, simply repeat these steps.

ences for 
the behavior 
of all Pages 
documents.
 
From scratch
To create a document from scratch, use Template Chooser to create a blank 
word processing or page layout document as described in the “From a tem-
plate” section. Alternatively, set the default template to a blank word pro-
cessing document or a blank page layout document and choose File➪New, 
as described in the “From a default template” section.
Setting Pages Preferences 
for All Documents
As you can see in Figure 5-5, you can set a number of other preferences that 
apply to all documents you open with Pages. If you change preferences and 
then open a document that you worked on previously with other settings, the 
new settings will apply. In general, preferences are for the application, and set-
tings are for individual documents.

101
 Chapter 5: Getting to Know Pages
 
If you share your computer with other people, you don’t have to worry about 
interfering with their preferences. Pages (like all applications on Mac OS X) 
stores preferences separately for each account on the computer.
When you open Preferences by choosing Pages➪Preferences or pressing Ô-, 
(comma), you can select any of the three sets of preferences by clicking the 
appropriate button at the top. The default is General preferences. If you’ve 
opened and then closed Preferences while Pages is open, it reopens to the 
preference you last viewed during that session.
General preferences
The General Preferences pane has six sets of preferences:
 
✓ For New Documents: The first preference lets you choose the behavior 
of the File➪New command, as described in the preceding section.
 
✓ Editing: These preferences help you as you’re editing the document. 
They are particularly useful in making Pages behave like other word 
processing applications you may be accustomed to (or making Pages 
not behave like other word processing applications whose features you 
detest).
 
• You can control whether the size and position of movable objects 
are shown as you move them.
 
• You can display an auto-completion list in table columns for par-
tially typed words.
 
• You can choose whether to have the document’s word count 
shown at the window bottom.
 
✓ Saving: These preferences control options when you save a document.
 
• You can automatically back up the previous version of a document 
as it was at the last save command; the file has BACKUP added to 
the name. Note that only one backup copy is saved. You can drag 
those old copies to a new location on your hard disk so that you 
can keep several older backups if you want.
 
• You can automatically add a preview of the document to the file 
so that the preview is visible in Finder windows. You can override 
this preference with an option in the Save dialog for an individual 
file, as shown in Figure 5-6.
 
• You can save new documents as a Mac OS X package that includes 
supporting files. (This is an advanced feature; you probably don’t 
want to use it, but it can’t do any harm unless you need to share 
your documents with someone else.)

102
Part II: Turning the Page with Pages 
 
Figure 5-6: 
Choose 
whether to 
save a pre-
view image 
with the 
Pages 
document.
 
 
✓ Font Preview: The format bar can list font names in a standard font or 
using the particular font for each font name. This gives you an idea of 
what the font will look like.
 
✓ Invisibles: Invisible characters such as tabs and returns normally aren’t 
displayed in a document, but their effects are visible. You can use the 
View➪Show Invisibles command in any Pages document to display those 
characters. View➪Show Invisibles is a per-document setting, not a global 
preference for all documents. However, the color you use to display 
invisibles is a global setting, and you set it in General Preferences. Click 
the color well to open the Colors window, as described in Chapter 3.
 
✓ Change Tracking: The last settings control how change tracking is stored 
and displayed. This is the feature that keeps track of every change to the 
document with before-and-after versions, dates, times, and who made the 
changes. You can enter the name to be associated with the changes and 
control how deleted and inserted text is formatted.
Rulers preferences
The second set of preferences control the rulers you can display around your 
document. Click the Rulers button to display the following settings, as shown 
in Figure 5-7:

103
 Chapter 5: Getting to Know Pages
 
Figure 5-7: 
You can 
set several 
preferences 
for the ruler.
 
 
✓ Default Zoom: You can always adjust the window’s zoom factor using 
the pop-up menu in the lower left of the window. By default, the window 
zooms to 125 percent. This reflects the fact that when a document is 
printed, smaller font sizes are generally used than when the document is 
displayed on a monitor.
 
✓ Ruler Units: You can choose inches, centimeters, points, or picas. You 
can also set the origin of the rulers. The origin is the 0,0 point — that 
is, the point that is 0 on both the horizontal and vertical rulers. You 
can place it at the upper left of the document, with numbers increasing 
to the right on the horizontal access and down on the vertical access. 
Or you can place it in the center of the document with larger numbers 
going to the right and smaller (even negative) numbers going down to 
the left margin. Instead of units, you can display a percentage. Finally, 
you can choose whether a vertical ruler is shown in word processing 
documents. (It appears in page layout documents at all times when 
rulers are shown.)
 
✓ Alignment Guides: The alignment guides help you position objects 
accurately. You choose the color of the guides from the color well. You 
can also choose whether to display them at the edges or centers of 
objects (or both).
Auto-Correction preferences
The Auto-Correction preferences let you configure Pages so that certain key-
strokes are automatically transformed into specific characters and symbols. 
As with the General preferences, these apply to all documents — unless you 
change them. If you change them, the changes take effect from then on; noth-
ing is changed in documents you have opened previously.

104
Part II: Turning the Page with Pages 
 
1. Open the Preferences window by choosing Pages➪Preferences or 
pressing Ô-, (comma).
 
2. Click the Auto-Correction button at the top of the Preferences window 
to show the Auto-Correction Preferences pane, as shown in Figure 5-8.
 
Figure 5-8: 
Set prefer-
ences for 
abbre-
viations, 
shortcuts, 
and 
corrections.
 
Basic Auto-Correction preferences
There are two sets of Auto-Correction preferences. The first six are check 
box choices that are common to many word processing applications:
 
✓ Smart Quotes: Smart quotes are sometimes called curly quotes. They 
look like “ and ” or, in the case of single quotes, ‘ and ’. Your keyboard 
has straight quotes, “ and ” and ‘ and ’. When smart quotes is turned 
on, Pages automatically converts straight quotes that you type to the 
appropriate smart quotes.
 
 To know whether to use opening or closing quotes (“ or ”), Pages relies 
on spaces. If you type a space and then “Hello, how are you” and then 
another space, Pages recognizes the space before the first quote and 
turns it into an opening quote. Then it recognizes the space after the 
closing quote and turns it into a closing quote symbol. If you’re using 
quotes in phrases where the spaces aren’t in the standard positions, 
check that the substitution is what you want.

105
 Chapter 5: Getting to Know Pages
 
✓ Fix capitalization: This preference helps correct capitalization mistakes 
that occur if you’re typing quickly and accidentally capitalize the first 
two letters of a word, such as THis. With this preference set, as soon as 
you finish typing the word and press the space key, Pages automatically 
corrects the word to This. This preference doesn’t correct any other 
capitalization errors, and it doesn’t refer to a dictionary or other source 
to determine whether a word should be capitalized. If you really meant 
to capitalize the first two letters, just retype the second letter as a capi-
tal and Pages will defer to your typing.
 
✓ Superscript Numerical Suffixes: This preference converts plain text to a 
superscript numerical suffix. If you type 1st when this preference is set, 
Pages will convert it to 1st.
 
✓ Automatically Detect Email and Web Addresses: Just as its name says, 
this preference converts text that appears to be an email address or a 
Web address to a hyperlink. You can then click the link and open your 
email program to begin typing a message or go to the Web address. See 
the next section for how to turn off this preference on a case-by-case 
basis.
 
✓  Automatically Detect Lists: The final basic preference comes into play 
when Pages thinks you’re typing a list. If this preference is set, Pages 
begins to format the list according to the styles you’ve set. You can 
change the list settings (and turn the list back into plain text).
 
✓ Automatically Use Spell Checker Suggestions: Instead of just flagging a 
potential spelling error, Pages can make suggestions for a correction. In 
many cases, you can just click a suggestion and go on with your work.
Modifying auto-detected email and Web addresses
It’s great to have hyperlinks in your Pages documents. You and the people 
with whom you share your documents can just click the link to go to a Web 
address or to open and address a new mail message. Having the ability to 
auto-detect email and Web addressees makes it even easier to add them to 
your Pages documents as hyperlinks.
There’s only one problem: How do you edit the link and its text? If you click 
it, you’re off to your browser or email program. Here’s how to modify an 
email or Web address that’s active in a Pages document:
 
1. Scroll the page so that the link is in view, but don’t click it yet.
 
2. If the inspector isn’t shown, choose View➪Show Inspector or click the 
Inspector button at the right of the toolbar.
 
 Inspectors were discussed in Chapter 4.
 
3. Click the Hyperlink tab, as shown in Figure 5-9.

106
Part II: Turning the Page with Pages 
 
Figure 5-9:

Hyperlink 
tab of the 
inspector.
 
 
4. At the bottom of the pane, select the Make All Hyperlinks Inactive 
check box.
 
 Now you can edit any link in the document by clicking it.
 
5. When you’re finished, select the Make All Hyperlinks Active check 
box to clear the check mark.
Setting symbol and text substitution
The second group of auto-correction settings controls symbol and text 
substitution. The bottom part of the Auto-Correction Preferences window 
consists of a table of substitution rules. A number of rules are installed auto-
matically in Pages, and you can add your own. In addition, a check box at the 
left of each substitution rule determines whether that rule is turned on.
The default rules in Figure 5-8 handle different types of substitutions:
 
✓  You can create special characters such as 1/2 by simply typing 1/2, with-
out using modifier keys such as opt or Ô.
 
✓  Common typos such as teh for the can be corrected automatically.
You can add your own rules easily:
 
1. With the Auto-Correction Preferences window visible, click the + 
button, which is in the lower left, as shown in Figure 5-10.
 
 A new line is added to the bottom of the scrolling list. The check box in 
the On column is set automatically, and the pointer is positioned in the 
next column (Replace).
 
2. In the Replace column, type the text that you want to replace.
 
3. Using the mouse or the tab key, move to the next column (With) and 
enter the new text.

107
 Chapter 5: Getting to Know Pages
 
Figure 5-10: 
Add a 
new auto-
correction 
rule.
 
You can use a similar process to remove a substitution rule. Scroll to the 
rule you want to remove, select it by clicking in the row, and then click the – 
button to remove it.
 
Rather than removing a rule, consider just turning it off. That way, if you 
change your mind, the rule is still there.
Saving Your Work
As with any Mac OS X application, you save your work using File➪Save to 
save the file with the last name you used or File➪Save As to rename the file. 
The basic Save As dialog is shown in Figure 5-11.
 
Figure 5-11: 
Save your 
work.
 

108
Part II: Turning the Page with Pages 
You can expand the Save As dialog by clicking the downward-pointing arrow 
next to the file name, as shown in Figure 5-12.
 
Figure 5-12: 
You can 
specify 
additional 
options for 
the Save 
command.
 
The Pages-specific options in this dialog give you greater control over what is 
saved. Note, however, that each of these options can increase the size of the 
file:
 
✓ Include Preview in Document: This is a preview of the document’s con-
tents for display in Finder.
 
✓ Save Copy As: Pages formats have changed with new releases. You 
have an option to save a copy in the prior format. This is useful if you’re 
exchanging documents with someone who doesn’t have the latest ver-
sion of Pages. If you’re sharing files with people who are using Microsoft 
Word, you can also choose to save a copy in Word format.
 
✓ Copy Audio and Movies into Document: These files can be very large. If 
you’re saving the document to send to someone who will print it, there’s 
no reason to include these files.

109
 Chapter 5: Getting to Know Pages
 
✓ Copy Template Images into Document: The Pages document that you 
see on the screen can include images from its template as well as images 
you’ve inserted in the document. In some cases, the template images 
should be saved in the document so that it’s complete. In other cases, 
the template images are just placeholders, so there’s no reason to save 
them with the document.
Creating a Template from a Document
To create a template from a document, you use the same dialog and the same 
options as the Save dialog discussed in the preceding session. When you’re 
ready to save your document as a template, choose File➪Save As Template.
The only difference between the Save dialog and the Save As Template dialog 
is that by default the template is saved to a folder called My Templates inside 
your home directory. The path is <home>/Library/Application Support/iWork/
Pages/Templates/My Templates. The newly created template will now show 
up in Template Chooser.
To remove a template, remove it from the folder in your home directory.

Chapter 6
Editing Word Processing 
Documents
In This Chapter
▶ Managing paragraphs
▶ Using headers and footers
▶ Using the Sections menu to add and reuse sections
▶ Navigating through a word processing document
I
n Chapter 5, you saw how to create Pages documents — both word pro-
cessing and page layout types of documents. When you find yourself 
looking at a blank word processing document or a document based on a tem-
plate, this chapter tells you what to do next.
This chapter deals with the major entities in your word processing docu-
ment, such as paragraphs, headers, and footers. Later, in Chapter 9, you 
see how to fine-tune both page layout and word processing documents. The 
format bar, which is discussed in Chapter 9, can be used for fine-tuning or for 
quick shortcuts.
One of the nice things about a word processing document is that you can just 
start typing. The text flows as you type; new pages are created as needed, 
and formatting is basically taken care of for you.
If your document is lengthy, however, page after page of type can become dif-
ficult to read. You can communicate your message more effectively if you use 
some of the tools described in this chapter. Even a short document can often 
benefit from organization.

112
Part II: Turning the Page with Pages 
Managing Paragraphs
Your word processing document consists of paragraphs. (Technically, it 
could have no paragraphs but be made up of tables, images, and media files, 
but normally at least one paragraph exists.) In a word processing document, 
paragraphs flow one after the other by default. Pages inserts page breaks as 
needed. You can modify this default behavior in a variety of ways, such as 
by manually inserting page breaks (even within a paragraph) or by forcing 
Pages to handle pagination in special ways for given paragraphs. This section 
shows you the principal paragraph management settings.
Paragraph settings apply to the entire paragraph, for example, you might 
make a paragraph single-spaced or double-spaced. You can select the para-
graph you want to apply settings to in two ways:
Is iWork WYSIWYG?
WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) isn’t 
really the case on the computer screen. Myriad 
settings influence what you see. The display 
resolution changes the size of everything on the 
display, and system-wide settings such as Font 
Smoothing in System Preferences modify text on 
the screen in subtle ways. Inside applications, 
you can zoom in or out of a document. Look in 
the lower left of a Pages document and you will 
see that the default zoom factor is 125 percent: 
Text is larger on the screen (all other settings 
and options being equal) than it is on a printed 
page (although you can change the zoom factor 
for a printed page, too). You can change the 
default zoom by choosing Pages➪Preferences 
and clicking the General tab.
The default zoom is 125 percent for a good 
reason. As a general rule, font sizes that are 
comfortable to read on a printed page are hard 
to read on a screen. You may have noticed this 
when you created text documents and then 
printed them. Depending on the font, a font 
size of 10 or 12 is comfortable for reading on 
the screen but looks right for a headline when 
printed. Pages has built-in styles that look good 
for printed documents. To make these styles 
more legible on the screen, the zoom factor is 
set to 125 percent rather than 100 percent.
Whenever you’re creating an iWork document 
that will be presented on some device other 
than the computer you’re working on, proofread 
the document on the device that will be used. 
That means doing the final proofreading of a 
document that will be printed by printing it and 
looking at the printed copy. If it will be printed 
on a specific printer, have a test run with the 
actual printer and paper that will be used. If 
you’re preparing Pages documents or Keynote 
slides for a presentation, proofread the slides 
on the screen you will be using if possible. If 
the image is to be projected, check to see that 
it is sized properly and that the potted palm at 
the side of the platform doesn’t obscure critical 
parts of your slides.

113
 Chapter 6: Editing Word Processing Documents
 
✓ Position the pointer in the paragraph and triple-click.
 
✓ Click anywhere in the paragraph. It doesn’t matter where in the para-
graph you click because the paragraph settings are the same for every 
location in the paragraph.
Setting vertical spacing
Three vertical spacing settings for paragraphs are available: the space 
between lines, the space before the paragraph, and the space after the para-
graph. (The before and after spaces aren’t additive — they’re used to com-
pute the actual space between any two paragraphs.)
Here’s how to set vertical spacing for a paragraph:
 
1. Click in the paragraph for which you want to adjust vertical spacing.
 
2. Open an inspector.
 
3. Click the T button at the top to display the Text settings.
 
4. Click the Text tab.
 
 The inspector looks like Figure 6-1.
 
Figure 6-1: 
Set vertical 
spacing in a 
paragraph.
 
 
5. Set the line spacing using the slider, the stepper arrows, or the box.
 
 You can also use the small pop-up menu below the text box. The default 
line spacing is one line. The height of the line is determined by the tall-
est font in the line; as a result it can appear that there are several differ-
ent line spacing values for a single paragraph, but only font variations 
actually cause them.

114
Part II: Turning the Page with Pages 
 
6. Set the space before and after the paragraph with the sliders, step-
pers, or text box.
 
 Pages automatically handles potential conflicts between interparagraph 
spacing settings as follows:
 
• First paragraph: There is no space before a first paragraph regard-
less of the setting.
 
• Last paragraph: Likewise, there is no space after a final paragraph.
 
• Conflicting settings: If the space after a paragraph and before the 
next paragraph is the same, that’s the space that’s used. If they 
differ, the larger space is used.
Setting indents with an inspector
The preceding section showed you how to set vertical spacing. This section 
and the one that follows deal with horizontal settings:
 
1. Click in the paragraph for which you want to adjust horizontal 
spacing.
 
2. Open an inspector.
 
3. Click the T button at the top to display the Text settings.
 
4. Click the Tabs tab.
 
 The window appears as shown in Figure 6-2.
 
5. Click the stepper arrows or type in the boxes to set the first line 
indent, left indent, and right indents.
 
Figure 6-2: 
Set para-
graph 
indents.
 

115
 Chapter 6: Editing Word Processing Documents
Indenting the first line of a paragraph is a common style. Other times, the 
first line of the first paragraph of a section is indented.
Make sure that your paragraph boundaries are visible. If the space between para-
graphs is the same as the space between lines in a paragraph, and the paragraph 
has no first line indent, the break between paragraphs is difficult to see.
If you need to group several paragraphs, use headings or subheadings, as I 
do in this book.
Setting indents with the ruler
You don’t have to use Text inspector to set the indents for a paragraph. You 
can use the ruler instead:
 
1. If the ruler isn’t visible, choose View➪Show Rulers or click the View 
button on the toolbar.
 
 The ruler is shown in Figure 6-3.
 
Figure 6-3: 
Set para-
graph 
indents from 
the ruler.
 
 
2. Drag the downward-pointing triangle on the left to set the left margin.
 
 The first line indent marker is the rectangle right above the triangle. By 
default, the first line indent moves with the left margin. To adjust the 
first line indent, drag it separately, as shown in Figure 6-4.
 
3. Drag the downward-pointing triangle on the right to set the right 
margin.
The ruler and Text inspector work together. If both are visible, changes made 
in one are automatically reflected in the other.

116
Part II: Turning the Page with Pages 
 
Figure 6-4: 
Set the first 
line indent

ruler.
 
Setting tabs
You can set tabs for a paragraph using Text inspector.
 
1. Select the paragraph.
 
2. Open Text inspector and click the Tabs tab (refer to Figure 6-2).
 
 If you need a new Inspector, choose View➪New Inspector or View➪
Show Inspector; you can also click Inspector on the toolbar if no inspec-
tor is visible.
 
3. Click the + button beneath the list of tab stops in the lower left.
 
 This creates a new tab. It will be located to the right of the previous tab 
at a distance set in the Default Tabs box.
 
4. If you want to change the new tab, double-click the new value in the 
Tab Stops list and then change it.
 
 For example, in Figure 6-2, the Default Tabs value is set at .5 inch, so all 
new tabs are in increments of .5 inch. I started with tabs at 0.5, 1, and 
1.5. In the figure, the 1.5 tab is being edited to move it to 1.75.
Using decorative caps
In addition to indents for the first line of a para-
graph or the first line of the first paragraph in a 
section, you can use a decorative cap for the 
first character of a paragraph. Typically this 
technique is used at the beginning of a chapter 
or section. The first character uses a distinc-
tive font and a much larger size than the text of 
the rest of the paragraph. This is a good place 
to use very elaborate letters. Explore the Fonts 
window to see what you can work with.

117
 Chapter 6: Editing Word Processing Documents
 
5. Select the type of tab from the Alignment list, at the right.
 
 The most common tab is a left-aligned tab. This will produce a column 
with an aligned left side. Right- and center-alignment function similarly. 
Decimal tabs align the column based on a character that you set in the 
Decimal Tab Character box. Most often, the Decimal option is used to 
align numbers on their decimal point.
 
6. If you want, choose a tab leader.
 
 Tab leaders can improve readability when there is a fairly long distance 
between the text and the next tab. For example, in this book’s table of 
contents, dots are used as leaders between the chapter titles and the 
page numbers.
Setting pagination
Finally, you can set options for the interaction of pagination and paragraphs. 
These settings are available in Text inspector in the More tab, as shown in 
Figure 6-5.
 
Figure 6-5: 
Set 
pagination 
preferences.
 

118
Part II: Turning the Page with Pages 
The pagination settings are in the Pagination & Break section of the inspec-
tor. Turn any setting on or off to get the effect that you want.
In the case of a preference such as Keep Lines Together, Pages will do its 
best, but if the paragraph has five pages of text in it, there is no way Pages 
will be able to fit it onto a single page.
The only setting that is guaranteed to take effect is Paragraph Starts On a 
New Page. Pages can easily do that.
The last setting, Prevent Widow & Orphan Lines, generally is turned on 
because it makes the document look better. Widow and orphan lines are 
single lines at the top or bottom of a page, respectively. If the line is short 
(perhaps a single word), a widow or orphan can look peculiar. Forcing the 
previous line down so you have at least two lines at the top or bottom of the 
page generally looks better.
Using Headers and Footers
You can improve the appearance of your documents by using headers and 
footers, which are special sections of text at a page’s top and bottom, respec-
tively, for information such as page numbers, dates, titles, and author names. 
When Pages inserts a page break, it places the appropriate footer at the 
bottom of the page and places the appropriate header at the top of the next 
page.
Headers and footers can contain constant text such as the document name or 
certain variable information such as a date. Most documents that are more 
than one page long benefit from headers and footers.
Constructing a header
Most of the Pages templates have headers and footers, but many of them 
aren’t filled in. Choose View➪Show Layout to show all the layout elements on 
a page. Figure 6-6 is the Modern Report template with the layout shown. The 
page header is at the top.
Even without displaying the layout, you can click where you know the header 
is to activate it.
 
To construct a header, type it as you would normally type any paragraph, but 
keep your text to a single line (two or three lines at the most). The longer the 
header and footer, the less room on the page for your text.

processors and headers and footers allowed innovative students to fulfill 
the page count with a remarkably small amount of text and a remarkably 
large amount of header and footer information. Today, most teachers assign 
reports by word count, not page count, so the header/footer trick no longer 
works.
You can also insert special markers that will be used during pagination. 
These are all in the Insert menu:
 
✓ Date & Time
 
✓ Page Number
 
✓ Page Count
Figure 6-7 shows a typical footer that combines text with some special sym-
bols. At the left, the actual footer is
Page <page number> of <page count>
By default, footers and headers contain a right-aligned tab, so if you press 
the Tab key after inserting something at the left, whatever you type will be 
placed at the right. You can set additional tabs if needed.

Moving headers and footers
You can turn headers on and off and move them, as follows:
. 
1. Click in the section of the document you want to modify.
 
2. Open an inspector and click the Document button at the left.
 
3. Click the Document tab, as shown in Figure 6-8.

 Chapter 6: Editing Word Processing Documents
 
4. Use the check boxes in the Document Margins section to turn the 
headers and footers on or off.
 
 If you turn a header or footer off, its content is removed. If you subse-
quently restore it with the check box, it will be blank.
 
5. To place the header or footer below the document’s top margin or 
above its bottom margin, use the stepper arrows or text box.
 
 This moves the header or footer down or up, leaving more blank space 
at the top or bottom of the page.
Using section headers and footers
Pages word processing documents are composed of sections. You can set 
separate header and footer options for any section:
 
1. Click in the section you want to modify.
 
2. Open an inspector and click the Layout button at the top (it’s the 
second from the left).
 
3. Click the Section tab, as shown in Figure 6-9.
 
Figure 6-9: 
Specify a 
special first 
page.
 
 
4. Select the First Page Is Different check box.
 
 The header and footer on the first page are removed. You can create 
new ones there. If you already created a header or footer, it continues to 
appear on pages after the first page.

122
Part II: Turning the Page with Pages 
Using the Sections Menu to 
Add and Reuse Sections
A document section is one or more pages that are treated as a unit. You can 
adjust headers and footers for each section; you can also control whether 
page numbers restart at the beginning of a section (refer to Figure 6-9).
For now, it’s important to know just these basics and that most of the Pages 
word processing templates come with several sections defined for the docu-
ment even if they aren’t shown. You find out more about sections and how to 
create them in Chapter 11.
To select a section to insert into a document, click the Sections button on 
the toolbar or choose Insert➪Sections. Figure 6-10 shows the sections for the 
White Paper template. The sections are well named and include a variety of 
pages. Experiment by adding various sections to your document to see what 
they look like. One of the advantages of using sections is that you can create 
a common look for different types of pages in your document.

Navigating through a Document
When you have a document with many pages, a fast way to navigate through 
the document is to use thumbnails of the pages. To do that, follow these 
steps:

123
 Chapter 6: Editing Word Processing Documents
 
1. Show page thumbnails by clicking the View button on the toolbar or 
by choosing View➪Show Page Thumbnails.
 
 A page thumbnail for each page in the document appears in the Pages 
pane on the left of the screen, as shown in Figure 6-11.
 
Figure 6-11: 
Show the 
thumbnails.
 
 
2. To rearrange the sequence of pages, drag the thumbnails up or down.
 
3. To delete a page, select it its thumbnail and press the Delete key.

Editing Page Layout Documents
In This Chapter
▶ Creating a one-page flyer
▶ Setting a big title
▶ Adding an image
▶ Creating tear-off tabs
W
ord processing documents tend to be fairly simple: They consist of 
words that are built into sentences and paragraphs. You can add 
graphics and other elements, but most of the time you’re typing one word 
after another.
Page layout documents generally have a range of objects, such as text boxes, 
graphics, and even movies and hyperlinks. You need to identify the compo-
nents, know how to create and edit them, and put them all together.
As always with iWork, the easiest and fastest way to get started is to begin 
with one of the built-in templates. In this chapter, you create a document 
from a template. Then you explore what you’ve created, seeing how each 
component is created and how it can be customized. You can apply these 
steps to any page layout document, whether you construct it from a template 
or a blank document.
Analyzing the Templates
The Page Layout templates are divided into nine categories:
 
✓ Blank 
 
✓ Newsletters
 
✓ Brochures
 
✓ Flyers
 
✓ Posters

126
Part II: Turning the Page with Pages 
 
✓ Cards & Invitations
 
✓ Business Cards
 
✓ Certificates
 
✓ Miscellaneous
Each template comes with built-in styles, and many of them have placeholder 
text and pictures, which you replace with your own text and pictures. As 
with word processing documents, as well as Numbers and Keynote docu-
ments, the templates not only provide a jumping-off point but also can give 
you ideas for the documents you want to create. These ideas can be specific, 
such as the types of information you should consider putting into a bro-
chure, or general. 
Open Template Chooser by choosing File➪New From Template Chooser. As 
you click the various categories in Template Chooser and look at the thumb-
nails of the various templates, you get an excellent basic lesson in graphic 
design (something the people at Apple know from top to bottom). Figure 7-1 
shows some newsletter templates.
 
Figure 7-1: 
iWork has

newsletter 
templates.
 

127
 Chapter 7: Editing Page Layout Documents
 
To see a particular template full-sized, simply create a document from the 
template. When you’ve finished viewing the template, close it without saving it.
It’s easy to spot the title in each template, even when the templates are 
thumbnail-sized. If you want to become an iWork pro, start training yourself 
to analyze what you’re seeing. What makes the titles stand out from the rest 
of the elements on the template? Here are some of the ways in which the 
designers at Apple have done this:
 
✓ Titles are large. Here’s where you can go to town with a distinctive font 
and a large font size.
 
✓ Titles are brief. If a designer has to work with a long title, such as Sailing 
Newsletter, one solution is to make Sailing much larger than Newsletter.
 
✓ Backgrounds can help a title stand out.
 
• Large type for the title with plenty of white space around it can 
help the title stand out.
 
• A color or an image behind the title can also help it stand out. If 
you use this technique, the color or the main color in the back-
ground image should not be used extensively elsewhere on the 
page.
Starting with a Simple Template
The built-in flyer templates are some of the simplest page layout documents. 
Generally, they are a single page, although a few of them have alternate 
page layouts (such as one version with tear-off slips for phone numbers and 
another one with no such tear-off slips). Because the flyer templates are usu-
ally a single page, they’re a good place for us to start exploring exactly what 
goes into a page layout.
To create a template-based document, in this case a flyer, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪New Document from Template to open Template 
Chooser.
 
 You can also use Ú-N if you’ve set General Preferences to open 
Template Chooser.
 
2. In the Page Layout group at the left of the window, click the Flyers 
category to show the templates for flyers.
 
 Figure 7-2 shows you the range of choices for flyers in iWork. 

128
Part II: Turning the Page with Pages 
 
Figure 7-2: 
Select a 
template for 
your 
document.
 
 
3. Double-click the For Sale template (the one with a large photo of a 
bike) to create a document based on it.
 
 You can also select it with a single click and then click the Choose 
button in the lower right. Your new document opens in its own window, 
as shown in Figure 7-3.
The first step in exploring a document is to know what you have in the docu-
ment. Everything on a page in a page layout document is some kind of object, 
such as an image, a text box, a shape, a table, or a chart. Information (includ-
ing colors and images) is always located within an object. Objects sometimes 
are grouped either with the Pages Arrange➪Group command or conceptually 
in your mind and the minds of your users.
Here’s what you should be able to identify in your new document:
 
✓ Title: The title is For Sale on a solid red background.
 
✓ Image: The image in this case is the bike. This is a placeholder image 
that you replace with whatever you are selling.

129
 Chapter 7: Editing Page Layout Documents
 
✓ Description: The description of what’s for sale includes the name of 
what’s for sale and its price in large text. It is followed by placeholder 
text. If you look closely, you may see your own phone number at the end 
of the text! You’ll see later in this chapter how Pages can pick up infor-
mation on request from your Address Book and your Me card.
 
✓ Tear-off tabs: Ten identical tear-off tabs at the bottom have the name of 
the item for sale and the phone number for people to call.
 
Figure 7-3: 
View your 
new 
document.
 
Modifying the Title
Depending on what you’re going to use the flyer for, you may or may not 
have to modify the title. Perhaps it will read Free or Best Offer rather than For 
Sale. Even if you’re going to leave the text unchanged, you may want to alter 
other aspects of the title such as its font or size. In this section I show you 
how the title is constructed in the template and how you can modify it. (You 
can also use this information to create your own title on a blank document or 
another template.)

130
Part II: Turning the Page with Pages 
The title consists of bold text on a red background. Here’s an important 
iWork design note: The text on the red background is icreated with two 
objects. See Figure 7-4, in which both objects are selected. Look for the two 
outlines: one around the red box, and the other around the text box within 
the red box.
 
Figure 7-4: 
The title 
consists of 
two objects.
 
Here’s how to make changes to the title:
 
✓ Change the text: Double-click the text to select it all. You can then type 
replacement text. Alternatively, you can click where you want to make a 
change; then type the new text or delete the text you don’t want.
 
✓ Change the text formatting: Double-click the text to select it all. Then 
do one of the following:
 
• Use Text Inspector to change the font, color, and other attributes 
(for more information on these tasks, see Chapter 3).
 
• Use the Fonts window to change the font, color, and other 
attributes (for more on the Fonts window, see Chapter 2).
 
✓ Change the background shape or color: Click to select the background 
shape, and then drag the handles of the background shape to change 
its size and shape. Change its color using the Fill section in Graphic 
inspector (see Chapter 3) or the Colors window (Chapter 2).
Changing the Image
You’ll want to use your own image unless you happen to be selling a gray-
and-yellow bike. In this section we look at how the image has been placed on 
the flyer. Then you can simply replace it with your own image or change the 
settings for the image such as its angle on the page. If you just replace the 
image, your own image will appear tilted slightly to the right just as the place-
holder image is.

131
 Chapter 7: Editing Page Layout Documents
 
Here’s another design tip incorporated into this template. The photo of the 
bike is tilted a bit, just enough to draw your attention. Note too the light gray 
shadow behind the image. It’s subtle, but it helps to draw your attention to the 
image. Both techniques are used extensively throughout the iWork templates 
and in other examples of good design.
You can change the formatting of any image. If you insert a new image in a 
document, it will be inserted in its original orientation, but you can change it. 
If you’re working from an image that has already been inserted and manipu-
lated (such as this one), you can make further adjustments to it. Here’s how 
to make the adjustments to an image such as the one in the For Sale flyer:
 
1. Click the image to select it. 
 
 You can zoom in or out using the Edit Mask slider that appears below 
the image, as shown in Figure 7-5.
 
Figure 7-5: 
Use the Edit 
Mask slider 
below the 
image to 
change the 
zoom factor.
 
 
2. If an inspector is not visible, click the Inspector icon on the toolbar to 
show the inspector. 
 
 You can also choose View➪Show Inspector.
 
3. Click the Graphic button at the top of the inspector.
 
 Graphic inspector appears, as shown in Figure 7-6.
 
4. Adjust the Stroke settings to change the border around the image.
 
 You can change the width of the border, its shape, or its color. The 
template has the Stroke settings set to an unbroken, white, 10-point line. 
Figure 7-7 shows the image if you change the Line setting to None (no 
border).

5. Adjust the Shadow settings.
 
 You can turn the shadow on or off with the check box. The Shadow set-
tings are increased in Figure 7-8 to make the shadow bigger and more 
prominent. Compare this image to Figure 7-5, which shows the results 
of the default settings (shown in Figure 7-6). For Figure 7-8, they were 
changed to Offset (24), Blur (30), and Opacity (100). Experiment to see 
what looks best to you, but remember not to go to extremes.
 
 A subtle shadow with a suggested light source at the upper left is 
usually best, providing a slight 3-D effect and drawing attention to the 
image. 
 
Figure 7-8: 
You can 
change the 
shadow.
 
Setting the Main Text
You adjust the text and its characteristics just as you adjust text in a word 
processing document. Because this is placeholder text, you can’t edit it. If 
you begin to type, you will simply replace it. That doesn’t matter because the 
placeholder text is meaningless and you must replace it. To edit the text, just 
click in the text box, as shown in Figure 7-9, and type away.

Automatically Inserting Your 
Phone Number in the Flyer
iWork provides the ability to merge data from Address Book with your docu-
ments. Several templates use the feature to automatically insert your phone 
number. For this to work properly, you must have your own card in Address 
Book. Then you insert a Sender field in your document. Although the Flyers 
template has already completed the second step, this section walks you 
through both.
Creating a Me card in Address Book
Here’s how you create a Me card:
 
1. Launch Address Book.
 
2. Choose Card➪Go To My Card to go to your card. 
 
 Congratulations! You have a Me card and you don’t have to create a new 
one unless the Me card is not yours. This can happen if you’re using 
someone else’s computer. Get their permission before proceeding with 
the next step.
 
3. Type your name in the search field at the upper right of the window.
 
 You don’t have to click a button: Address Book finds any cards with the 
name you type.
 
4. If there’s no card with your name, create one by choosing File➪New 
Card and filling in your data.
 
5. With your card visible, as shown in Figure 7-10, choose Card➪Make 
This My Card.
 
 A small me appears in the lower left of your card image.

135
 Chapter 7: Editing Page Layout Documents
 
Figure 7-10: 
Make 
certain your 
Me card is 
visible.
 
Using the Merge or Sender field 
Two types of fields that interact with your Address Book data can be added: 
Merge and Sender fields. You can see them both at work in templates for let-
ters. The Merge fields in a letter contain information about the person you’re 
writing to; the Sender fields in a letter contain your information. 
These fields are already placed in many of the templates. The Sender fields 
pick up data from your Me card. The Merge fields pick up data from the 
appropriate Address Book record. Simply drag an address card from Address 
Book into your document, and the data for that person automatically appears 
in the Merge fields.
The Flyers template has a Merge field that picks up data from a selected 
Address Book card. This section shows you how to delete it and create a new 
Sender field that picks up your own work phone number from your Me card:
 
1. Delete the existing Merge field by selecting it and pressing Delete.
 
 In the For Sale flyer, the Merge field is the phone number at the end of 
the placeholder description text. Leave the placeholder text.
 
2. Place the cursor at least one space after the placeholder text.
 
3. Choose Insert➪Sender Field➪Phone➪Work Phone, as shown in 
Figure 7-11. 

136
Part II: Turning the Page with Pages 
 
Figure 7-11: 
Insert a 
Sender field.
 
 
 In the document, the Sender field you’ve inserted appears as shown in 
Figure 7-12 with the data from your Me card. If it doesn’t appear, check 
the following:
 
• Do you have a Me card?
 
• Do you have a work phone on the Me card?
 
• Have you finished editing the Me card? If you’ve just created it or 
just typed your work phone, try going to another card so that your 
update is captured.
 
Figure 7-12: 
The Sender 
field is 
inserted.
 
 
The Me card is used by default for a Sender field, but sometimes you don’t 
want that. Perhaps you’re preparing this flyer for a friend and you want to use 
her card instead of your Me card. Simply drag her Me card from the Address 
Book to the Sender field, and the Sender field automatically picks up the infor-
mation from that card and retains it until you change it again.

137
 Chapter 7: Editing Page Layout Documents
Changing the Info on the Tear-Off Tabs
At the bottom of the Flyers template are tear-off tabs that people can take 
with them to contact you. Each one is its own text box, which you can see 
if you click one. As always happens when you click a text box that has been 
rotated, it immediately returns to a horizontal state, as shown in Figure 7-13.
 
Figure 7-13: 
Each 
tear-off tab 
is its own 
text box.
 
As you hover your cursor over the text box, you can see that the phone 
number is a Sender field. If you have changed the Sender field in the main 
text to your work number, you should change it here as well.

Using Text Boxes
In This Chapter
▶ Placing text boxes relative to a page
▶ Placing text boxes relative to text
▶ Flowing text between text boxes
▶ Adding objects to text boxes
W
ord processing documents let text flow from page to page, with 
new pages added automatically as they are needed. In page layout 
documents, the only items that appear on pages are objects. The objects can 
contain text, but the size and shape of the object limits the amount of text 
that can be shown. 
Text boxes are objects that you place on a page and that can contain text. 
They can appear in both page layout and word processing documents. A text 
box can be used to highlight a small section of text; it can be used also to 
display part of a lengthy run of text that may continue in another text box 
on the same or another page. Although the main purpose of text boxes is to 
contain text and allow it to flow from one text box to another, they can also 
contain objects such as graphics, shapes, and charts. Their handling of text 
flow distinguishes them from other objects in iWork.
Think of a newspaper’s front page, which typically displays a number of 
articles. Most of the articles are incomplete, and they end with a note such 
as “Continued on Page A14.” That’s an example of text boxes in action: The 
first text box is on the front page, and the second is on page A14. When the 
newspaper is laid out, the text boxes are linked. If an editor adds or deletes 
a paragraph in the text box on the front page, the text reflows between that 
text box and the text box on page A14. Once the text boxes and the link are 
set up, you can edit the flowing text just as you would in a word processing 
document.
This chapter shows you the various permutations and uses of text boxes.

140
Part II: Turning the Page with Pages 
Creating a Simple Text Box
The easiest way to start learning about text boxes is to create one and work 
with it. Experiment with a document that has a good deal of text in it to see 
the results of inserting a text box and adjusting its settings.
 
The text box created in this section is actually a floating text box. By default, all 
text boxes you create are floating text boxes; also, they are the only kind of 
text box you can create in a page layout document. The other kind of text box, 
an inline text box, is described in the following section. It can be placed only in 
a word processing document.
Creating the text box
You can create a simple text box by clicking the Text Box icon on the toolbar. 
In both word processing and page layout documents, a simple text box is cre-
ated, as shown in Figure 8-1.
You can resize or reshape the text box with any of the eight handles. You 
can also drag it around by clicking and dragging the interior of the box. If you 
double-click in the text box, you can type text or paste it in.
Position the text box where you want it on the page. The text that’s already 
on the page will flow around the box if needed.
About the text in this chapter
Demonstrating how Pages handles text some-
times requires a lot of text. Formatting the text 
at the top of a For Sale flyer requires a mere 
seven letters and one space. In some ways, 
that’s trivial. Many of the tools and techniques 
you use to format For Sale are the same that you 
use to format a hundred pages or more of text, 
but when you deal with a large text document, 
some special problems (and solutions) arise.
To demonstrate some of the issues involved 
in large documents, this chapter sometimes 
uses text from The Pickwick Papers by Charles 
Dickens. With about 300,000 words, the novel is 
just under 800 pages long in a standard paper-
back edition or when displayed in Courier 12. 
That’s enough text to demonstrate text-handling 
capabilities in Pages. And it’s one of the great-
est and funniest novels ever written.
You can download the Pages word processing 
text from the author’s Web site as described in 
the Introduction.

Figure 8-1:

The text box contains text, but the box itself behaves like a shape. This means 
you can customize your text box using two sets of tools. Figure 8-2 shows a text 
box with text that is centered horizontally and vertically. The text box itself 
has a line border and a background gradient as well as a shadow.

Part II: Turning the Page with Pages 
Modifying the text box
You can modify text in a text box with the following two inspectors:
 
✓ Text inspector: Select some or all of the text in the text box and style it 
with Text inspector. The Text inspector settings are shown in Figure 8-3.
 
✓ Graphic inspector: You can set the fill, stroke, and opacity for the 
text box using Graphic inspector. Use the Stroke setting to show the 
border of the box, and select the Shadow check box if you want to add a 
shadow. The Graphic inspector settings are shown in Figure 8-4.
 
Figure 8-3: 
Change the 
text settings 
with Text 
inspector.
 
Customizing the text box
Figure 8-5 shows how the text box appears if you create it in The Pickwick 
Papers word processing document.
As you can see in Figure 8-5, just putting a text box into a default position in a 
document can make the existing text look peculiar. You can make things look 
better in three basic ways. You will probably use a little bit of each of them, 
as you experiment with the best size, shape, and position for the text box:
 
✓ Resize the text box. Click the text box to show its eight handles. Resize 
it as you want. (A single click selects the text box; a double click lets you 
edit the text.)
 
✓ Move the text box. Notice that as you move the box the text will wrap 
around it. Often this is what you want.

143
 Chapter 8: Using Text Boxes
 
✓ Use Wrap inspector to change how text wraps around the text box. 
Wrap inspector is shown in Figure 8-6 and is described in the follow-
ing section. Note that you can turn off text wrapping by deselecting the 
check box shown in Figure 8-6.

Figure 8-6:

inspector 
to integrate 
the text box 
with the text 
around it.
 
Wrapping around the text box
As shown in Figure 8-6, Wrap inspector has three sections. The Object 
Placement section of Wrap inspector is disabled for floating text boxes, 
which is the type of text box you create in this section.
 
The principles of wrapping text around a text box are the same as wrapping 
text around any shape.
The issue of wrapping text around something in a word processing document 
or a page layout document is tricky in any program. Usually when you set 
options and settings for text, a shape, or anything else, those options and 
settings govern the object’s appearance and performance. In the case of 
wrapping, the options govern the appearance and performance of objects 
next to the text box.
What’s the best way to wrap text?
There is no single answer to the question of 
the best way to wrap text. However, you can 
consider some general issues that apply to text 
boxes and any other objects around which text 
is wrapped. 
You may choose to have embedded objects 
placed at the left of your document (using wrap 
right or wrap larger). This provides a consistent 
look and can make the text easier to read.
Another choice applies particularly to docu-
ments that will be bound like a book. On pages 
that will appear on the left side of the book 
(generally even-numbered pages), place the 
embedded objects at the left. For pages on the 
right side of the book (generally odd-numbered 
pages), place the embedded objects at the 
right. When the book or booklet is bound, it will 
be easier to see the embedded objects or text 
boxes if they are closer to the edge of the page 
than if they are closer to the binding, where you 
might have to stretch the book flat to see them.

145
 Chapter 8: Using Text Boxes
Pages implements wrapping in a simple yet powerful way. Refer to Figure 8-5 
to see what happens when you insert a text box into a section of text. The 
existing text moves to accommodate the text box. Wrap inspector lets you 
specify how and if that existing text will move and wrap. The settings are 
for the text box (or for any object inserted into the existing text), but those 
settings affect the existing text, not the text box. (There is actually a bit of 
interplay because the inserted text box and the existing text interact, but 
basically the existing text adjusts itself based on the text box’s settings.)
Setting how the text box causes wrapping
Use the Object Causes Wrap check box to turn wrapping on and off. When 
the option is turned on, you then click whichever of the five wrapping tech-
niques you want to use. From left to right, they are as follows:
 
✓ Wrap left: Text flows to the left of the object; there is no text to the right 
of the object. Usually if you use wrap left, you place the text box at the 
right side of the document. Figure 8-7 shows how you can do this with 
the document shown previously in Figure 8-5.
 
✓ Wrap both sides: This is the default setting; you can see the result in 
Figure 8-5. Text flows on both sides and the text box is centered. This 
option works well if the text box is relatively narrow and the page is 
relatively wide, but most of the time this is the worst choice because 
you wind up with very short sections of text on the two sides.
 
Figure 8-7: 
If you wrap 
text to the 
left, place 
the text box 
to the right.
 

146
Part II: Turning the Page with Pages 
 
✓ Wrap right: This is the reverse of wrap left. If you do this, generally 
place the object at the left.
 
✓ Wrap larger: This option wraps text on one side or the other depending 
on which side is wider.
 
 Use wrap larger instead of wrap right and wrap left. Move the text box to 
the right or left and the text will automatically flow to the other side. 
The result is the same as carefully setting wrap right and wrap left. As an 
added benefit, if you edit the document, perhaps adding other text 
boxes, you just need to reposition the text boxes to one side or the 
other and the document’s text will flow the way you want it to: to the 
side opposite the text box.
 
✓ No wrap: Text doesn’t wrap around either side of the text box but 
continues below the text box.
Setting how the text box causes text fitting
The last set of options on Wrap inspector handle text around irregularly 
shaped objects. You can also specify the distance between the text box and 
the text that is being wrapped around it.
With all of these settings, experiment with the results in your document.
Creating an Inline Text Box for 
a Word Processing Document
A floating text box is fixed to a place on the page. It floats in the sense that 
because it is fixed to a place on the page, the text that is next to it floats as 
you add or remove text in the document. When you do everything properly, 
the reader doesn’t notice the difference between a floating text box and an 
inline text box. But a mistake is easy to spot. In this section I show an example 
of how you can get into trouble and how to prevent it.
In Figure 8-8, a floating text box has been placed in a word processing document. 
The text in the document references the text box as being to the right of the 
paragraph.
In Figure 8-9, some text has been added at the beginning of the document. 
The text reflows to incorporate the added text, but the floating text box stays 
where it is on the page. The reference to the text box being at the right of the 
paragraph no longer makes sense because that sentence has flowed down 
the page and is now below the text box. (That’s the floating part — the text 
has floated past the text box.)

147
 Chapter 8: Using Text Boxes
 
Figure 8-8: 
A floating 
text box 
doesn’t 
move on the 
page.
 
 
Figure 8-9: 
References 
to the text 
box or other 
embedded 
shapes

Something worse can occur. Instead of text referring to a text box at the right 
of a paragraph, there might be no reference to the text box. That can puzzle 
the reader who now has to try to figure out why that text box is next to that 
paragraph.

148
Part II: Turning the Page with Pages 
Word processing documents allow you to change floating text boxes to inline 
text boxes. Inline text boxes are tied to a specific place in text rather than to 
a specific place on the page. You can create inline text boxes in two ways:
 
✓ Use Wrap inspector to change the Object Placement setting to Inline 
rather than the default Floating. 
 
✓ Place the cursor where you want the text box to appear and choose 
Insert➪Text Box.
Figure 8-10 shows an inline text box next to the paragraph that refers to it. 
When the text box is selected, an insertion point appears in the text. As you 
move the text box, the insertion point moves. The text box will stay at that 
point in the text, although its specific positioning is set by the Object Causes 
Wrap settings in Wrap inspector.
 
Figure 8-10: 
An inline 
text box is 
fixed to text.
 
If text is added at the beginning of the document, as shown in Figure 8-11, the 
text reflows and the inline text box moves with its accompanying text.

You can

or delete

text box’s

Flowing Text between Text Boxes
Sometimes you want to put more text in a text box than will fit in it. If you are 
working with a floating text box in either a word processing or page layout 
document, you can flow text between several text boxes. You do this for 
several reasons:
 
✓ To flow text in a page layout document: Although word processing 
documents automatically flow text from page to page as you add it, in a 
page layout document the only way to flow text is from one text box to 
another (and, perhaps, another and another . . .).
 
✓ To handle page jumps: When a story begins on the front page of a 
newspaper and is continued inside the paper, the inside continuation 
is referred to as the jump. (On Web sites, articles sometimes have a few 
lines of text followed by a link that says Click Here to Read More. That, 
too, is called a jump.)

150
Part II: Turning the Page with Pages 
Creating a text flow link
Here’s how you flow text between text boxes:
 
1. Create a text box.
 
 If you are in a word processing document, it must be a floating text box; 
in a page layout document it will automatically be a floating text box.
 
2. Type or paste the text into the box.
 
 In Figure 8-12, the entire text of The Pickwick Papers has been pasted 
into the text box. (Yes, all 300,000 words. Pages and your Mac are very 
powerful!) The clipping indicator in the center of the bottom of the text 
box indicates that there is more text than is shown — it’s the square 
with the plus sign in it. The triangle indicators at the near top-left and 
near bottom-right let you specify the flow of the text, as explained in the 
next steps. If there’s no more text, there’s no clipping indicator.
 
Figure 8-12: 
Text in a 
floating text 
box that 
overflows 
shows a 
clipping 
indicator. 
 
 
3. Click the right arrow box at the lower right of the text box to begin 
the link.
 
 You can link to a text box on any page of your document:

151
 Chapter 8: Using Text Boxes
 
• To link to an existing text box, click the existing text box.
 
• To link to a text box that will be automatically created, click in 
the document at the approximate location for the new text box. 
Figure 8-13 shows the link to a text box on the next page of the 
document. Note that there is still more text to be flowed because 
the clipping indicator in the center of the new text box still 
contains a + symbol.
 
 When the link is created, the right arrow box becomes a solid blue box.
 
Figure 8-13: 
You can link 
text boxes.
 
You can link any number of text boxes, and you can resize each one as you 
want. To remove a link, drag the solid blue box for the link you want to break 
off the text box. The link will disappear and the blue box will revert to being 
an arrow, as shown previously in Figure 8-12.
Joining two text boxes
You can use the procedure in the preceding section to join two text boxes, 
each of which has its own text. Link them, and the text becomes a single flow. 
As you resize the text boxes, you will see that the text flows from one to the 
other.

152
Part II: Turning the Page with Pages 
Adding Objects to Text Boxes
You can insert objects into text boxes, as shown in Figure 8-14. They behave 
as inline text boxes do: You position them relative to the text in the text box, 
and they stay in that relative place. 
 
Figure 8-14: 
You can 
add other 
objects to 
text boxes.
 
Here’s how to add a graphic to a text box. The same technique works for 
other objects, such as tables and charts:
 
1. Select the text box.
 
2. Click to set the insertion point approximately where you want the 
graphic to be.
 
3. Insert the object using the Insert menu.
 
• For a graphics file, choose Insert➪Choose.
 
• For a table, choose Insert➪Table.
 
• For a chart, choose Insert➪Chart.
 
• For a shape, choose Insert➪Shape.
 
 You can’t insert a text box into a text box.

T
his chapter explores some of the Pages tools that improve your productivity 
and make your documents look better. You might think of some of these 
tools as advanced features in the sense that you can manage to produce fine 
Pages documents without using them. But if you think advanced means 
complicated, you’re wrong. They can save you time — sometimes a lot of it — 
and make your documents easier to read and much, much easier to reuse.
Using the Format Bar
One of the features of iWork that makes it so easy to use is that there are 
usually many ways to accomplish something. If you want to change a font, 
for example, you can use the Fonts window, a style (discussed later in this 
chapter), the format bar, or Text inspector. The format bar brings together 
formatting controls from many places in iWork; it resembles toolbars in other 
programs such as Microsoft Word. 
You decide whether or not you want to display the format bar. When shown, 
it appears across the top of the window below the toolbar. Figure 9-1 shows 
the format bar with the toolbar hidden (so that you can concentrate on the 
format bar). As you can see, the format bar is only one row of controls, buttons, 
and icons. That is part of a compromise: Tools such as inspectors and the 
Fonts window have more space to allow you more control over formatting 
features, but the format bar brings many formatting features together in one 
place.

154
Part II: Turning the Page with Pages 
 
Figure 9-1: 
The format 
bar is at the 
top of the 
Pages 
window.
 
The format bar has the following six sections (from left to right):
 
✓ Styles: The first section lets you manage styles for paragraphs and 
characters. For more control over styles, use the Styles drawer 
(described later in this chapter).
 
• The round ¶ icon shows and hides the Styles drawer.
 
• The ¶ pop-up menu lets you select a paragraph style for the 
current paragraph.
 
• The a pop-up menu lets you select a character style for the 
currently selected text. If no text is selected, the character style 
will be applied to the next characters you type.
 
✓ Font formatting: The next five controls manage basic font formatting 
for the current selection. For more control, use the Fonts window 
(described in Chapter 2).
 
• Use the first pop-up menu to choose a font family.
 
• Click the next menu to choose the typeface (such as regular, bold, 
or italic).
 
• The third pop-up menu lets you choose the font size.
 
• Click the color well to choose a color for the font.
 
• Click the color well containing the letter a to choose the 
background color for the selected text.
 
✓ Character styles: Use the next three buttons — which represent bold, 
italics, and underline — to turn styling on or off for selected text. For 
more control, use Text inspector (described in Chapter 3).
 
✓ Paragraph alignment: The next four buttons let you choose the 
paragraph alignment as follows: flush left, centered, flush right, and 
justified. For more control, use Text inspector (described in Chapter 3).

155
 Chapter 9: Fine-Tuning Your Pages Documents
 
✓ Line spacing and columns: The next two pop-up menus let you adjust 
vertical line spacing and columns. For more control, use Layout inspector 
(columns) and Text inspector (vertical line spacing).
 
✓ Styles: The last pop-up menu lets you choose a list style for a selected 
list (or to convert text into a list). For more control, see the List pane of 
Text inspector.
Formatting Text with Styles
Word processing applications let you format text with underlining, italics, 
boldface, and many more features. With Pages, all you have to do is select 
the text in question and open the Fonts window (Format➪Font➪Show Fonts) 
or use Text inspector. You’re finished.
It’s easy to get carried away with text formatting. When used properly, it 
increases the readability of a sentence. When used in the wrong way, it really 
not only doesn’t help but can ACTUALLY make a sentence much harder to 
read.
Styles let you set one or more formatting instructions and give them a name 
of your own choosing. You might do this for two reasons:
 
✓ Consistency: Particularly when it comes to formatting such as underlin-
ing and italics, a style can help you be consistent. For example, you can 
construct several styles that serve specific purposes in your document. 
You could create a style called Emphasis that you use for anything that 
you want to emphasize. If you set the style to boldface and the font 
color to red, all emphasized words would be shown that way. Also, you 
wouldn’t have to go back to figure out what you decided you would use 
for emphasis: Just select the text and use the Emphasis style. If you were 
to print the document on a printer that doesn’t support color, you could 
change the style to use, say, italics instead of boldface and red; the one 
change would affect all the uses of the style.
 
✓ Simplicity: Styles can be complex. It is typical for a style for a paragraph 
to include its margins, the spacing between lines, and sometimes even 
a border. You can construct a style and give it a name so that you can 
then apply all those settings at once to any given paragraph.
Styles can be copied and pasted. You can modify a style either for all its 
occurrences or on a case-by-case basis when you want to vary a single section 
of text or a paragraph. Creating a style in Pages is simple: You style some text 
or a paragraph, and then you create that as a style that you name.

156
Part II: Turning the Page with Pages 
Styles can be created for characters, paragraphs, and lists. They’re easy to 
create, but the Apple developers of iWork are several steps ahead of you: 
Styles come with every iWork Pages template. You can modify them, delete 
them, or add more, but you always start with some styles. 
Showing the Styles drawer
The Styles drawer helps you create, manage, and use styles. Even the simplest 
templates (the blank documents for both word processing and page layout) 
come with styles. To see your document’s styles, you display the Styles 
drawer using one of the following methods:
 
✓ Choose View➪Show Styles Drawer.
 
✓ Click the View icon on the toolbar, and choose Show Styles Drawer, as 
shown in Figure 9-2.
 
✓ In the format bar, click the ¶ icon all the way at the left, as shown in 
Figure 9-3.

drawer from

157
 Chapter 9: Fine-Tuning Your Pages Documents
Figure 9-4 shows the styles that come with the blank templates. 
 
Figure 9-4: 
All 
templates 
come with 
styles. 
 
 
iWork has no such thing as a totally blank document. The closest you can 
come to a blank document is a document based on one of the blank templates.
Templates have styles that help implement their look and feel. For example, 
the For Sale flyer template is shown in Figure 9-5 with its styles. Notice how 
the styles are displayed using some of their characteristics. For example, 
look at the Heading style and match it to the text Mountain Bike $500 in the 
flyer. The styles shown at the right of Figure 9-5 are displayed in a drawer.
Drawers are a feature of Mac OS X. They slide out from the main window. As 
you resize the window vertically, the drawers automatically resize. You can 
drag the edge of the drawer to pull it farther in or out. Give it a bit of a shove 
with the mouse, and it will slide back into the window. (You can also use the 
Hide Styles Drawer command on the toolbar and in the menu bar; it replaces 
the Show Styles Drawer command when the drawer is open.)

158
Part II: Turning the Page with Pages 
 
Figure 9-5: 
The For Sale 
flyer has its 
own styles.
 
Using the Styles drawer controls
The Styles drawer has a lot of power. The Styles drawer has three sections: 
paragraph styles, character styles, and list styles. These sections can be 
manipulated as follows:
 
✓ Resize sections: You can resize the three sections by dragging the 
double-bar to the right of the heading for character and list styles. If you 
drag the double-bar to the right of the character styles up, for example, 
you enlarge the character styles section at the expense of the paragraph 
styles section.
 
✓ Show and hide sections: You can show or hide the character and list 
styles sections using the buttons in the lower right of the Styles drawer. 
The button with the letter a on it controls the character styles section; 
the one with the bulleted list on it controls the list section. The paragraph 
styles section is always shown.

159
 Chapter 9: Fine-Tuning Your Pages Documents
To use an existing style, select the text you want to style. Then do the following:
 
✓ Paragraph styles: Click anywhere in the paragraph you want to style 
and click the style to use in the Styles drawer.
 
✓ Character styles: Select the character or characters to style and then 
click the style to use in the Styles drawer. If no characters are selected, 
the style will be applied to all the characters that you type starting with 
the next character. 
 
 One of the most common problems using styles in any application is not 
selecting characters to style. The new style will affect the next characters 
you type, but nothing changes on the screen until you type a new 
character. If you have accidentally not selected any characters, but are 
expecting a word to be changed to another color or font size, this can be 
frustrating.
 
✓ List styles: Select the entire list and then select a list style. Note that list 
styles are associated with paragraph styles, so selecting a list style will 
modify the associated paragraph style on a one-time basis.
Handling style changes
At the right of each style name is a downward-pointing triangle (a disclosure 
triangle) that you click to open a menu. This menu (see Figure 9-6) is where 
you control individual styles.
 
Figure 9-6: 
Use the 
contextual 
menu in 
the Styles 
drawer 
to control 
styles.
 
The downward-pointing triangle has another important function. It normally 
is gray, but if you override any of the styles’ settings, it turns red.

160
Part II: Turning the Page with Pages 
Changing style on a one-time basis
As you are editing your document, you can change font sizes and colors, 
margins, and all the other attributes of text. You always have some basic 
paragraph style even if it’s the catchall Free Form style. As you make your 
formatting changes, the currently selected style will show a red triangle next 
to its name instead of the standard gray one. The first three items in the 
menu shown in Figure 9-6 let you decide what to do with the changed style:
 
✓ Create a new style: If you have deliberately made a change to the style, 
you can save it as a new style. For example, maybe you’ve decided that 
you would sometimes like the Heading style to be underlined. You can 
select a paragraph that uses the Heading style and underline it. The red 
triangle will appear, and you can choose to create a new style named, 
for example, Underlined Heading. The style will now appear in the Styles 
drawer. 
 
• You’re asked to provide a name for the new style, as shown in 
Figure 9-7. By default the style has the name of the existing style 
with a number after it. It’s a good idea to give it a more meaning-
ful name right away. You also can choose whether to apply the 
style on creation. That means that as soon as it is created it will be 
applied to the current selection. If you deselect this box, the style 
will be created and added to the list, but it won’t be applied until 
you select some text and choose the style.
 
• If you’re creating a character style, you can use the disclosure 
triangle to see which character attributes have been set, as shown 
in Figure 9-8. You can turn any of them on or off. If a character 
attribute isn’t set in the character style, basic formatting (usually 
specified in the paragraph style) is used. The Select Overrides 
button in the lower right displays only the character style changes 
you’ve specified.
 
Figure 9-7: 
Create a 
new style 
and name it.

 Chapter 9: Fine-Tuning Your Pages Documents
 
Figure 9-8:

attributes

style.
 
 
✓ Redefine the style: If you decide that the Heading style would look 
better underlined, for example, select a paragraph that uses it and 
underline the paragraph. Then, in the contextual menu, choose Redefine 
Style from Selection. This changes the style. Now you have only one 
style, but it is the redefined one. All Heading paragraphs are now 
changed.
 
✓ Revert to the defined style: If you make a mistake or change your mind 
about the underlining or other formatting, choose Revert to Defined 
Style and your change is ignored. You are back to the original style with-
out your modification.
 
✓ Do nothing: You don’t have to do anything about that red triangle. If you 
made a formatting change and you meant to do it, so be it. Just move on. 
(There’s no menu choice for doing nothing.)
Managing styles
Whenever you select a paragraph, a list, or some characters, the style name 
is highlighted. The name is also highlighted as you move the mouse over the 
style names in the styles list. You can use the downward-pointing triangle to 
open the menu shown previously in Figure 9-5 whether you’ve changed the 
style or not. Menu commands let you rename or delete the style. You can 
also associate a function key from F1 to F8 (at the top of the keyboard) with 
that style. That way, you can just select a paragraph, a list, or text and press 
the function key to apply the style.

162
Part II: Turning the Page with Pages 
Searching for Text
iWork has a powerful search feature. You display the search tool shown in 
Figure 9-9 by choosing View➪Search or by clicking the View icon at the left of 
the toolbar (refer to Figure 9-2).
 
Figure 9-9: 
Use search 
to quickly 
find text.
 
Type some text into the search box and Pages will quickly find every occurrence 
in your document. In the search area, you see page numbers as well as the 
search string in context. Click an item in the list and you immediately go to 
that occurrence in the document.
iWork indexes the text very quickly. And it indexes all the text. It will find 
your search string in a word processing document, in a text box, and even 
inside an object if you’ve typed text there. 
The search list is updated as you modify the document. 

163
 Chapter 9: Fine-Tuning Your Pages Documents
Navigating with Thumbnails
iWork can provide thumbnails of your pages in sequence. Even though the 
thumbnails are small, you can often get a sense of what page you’re looking 
at, particularly in a page layout document. You display thumbnails by 
choosing View➪Page Thumbnails. Just click a thumbnail to go to that page, 
as shown in Figure 9-10.

Chapter 10
Improving Your Documents
In This Chapter
▶ Adding comments
▶ Tracking changes
T
he tools described in this chapter help you improve your documents by 
using features of iWork as well as comments and suggestions from other 
people. iWork has a variety of tools that make it easy for people to work 
together on documents.
These tools are available in Numbers and Keynote as well as in Pages. They 
have the same overall functionality in all the applications, but they have 
slightly different interfaces.
iWork.com implements the commenting and track changes functionalities 
through the Web so that multiple people can work on the same documents at 
the same time. See Appendix A for details.
Using Comments
Whether you’re working by yourself or with others, you frequently need to 
make comments on your work. Sometimes comments are reminders; some-
times they’re questions. For example, Figure 10-1 shows a typical comment 
questioning whether the date 1600 is the specific year or an approximation. 
You might leave this comment for yourself or add it to someone else’s 
document. Either way, the comments need to be dealt with.
If you’re reviewing a document (perhaps you’re a teacher), comments may 
not require action — you might write “Good!” or “You really understand why 
black ice is so dangerous.”
Either way, the point is that you want to be able to comment on a document 
without your comment appearing in the document. If you insert a comment 
into the document itself, not only can it appear when you print the docu-
ment, but its presence can change the flow of the document, perhaps adding 
several pages to the uncommented document.

166
Part II: Turning the Page with Pages 
 
Figure 10-1: 
The 
Comments 
pane 
displays 
comments 
and links 
them to 
highlighted 
text.
 
Showing and hiding the Comments pane
Comments are shown in the Comments pane, which appears at the left of a 
Pages document (refer to Figure 10-1). 
To show or hide the Comments pane:
 
✓ Choose View➪Show Comments or View➪Hide Comments on the toolbar.
 
✓ Click the pop-up View menu on the toolbar and make your selection.
There’s another special way to display the Comments pane: Simply create a 
comment, and the Comments pane appears automatically.
Creating a comment
To create a comment, first select what it applies to. That can be a word, a 
paragraph, or even a page; it can be an object, a text box, or an image. If you 
can select it, you can comment on it. 
 
Highlighting one or two characters is possible, but it can make the comment 
hard to find. If you have a question or comment about one or two charac-
ters in a word, highlight the entire word and make it clear that the comment 
applies only to those characters.

167
 Chapter 10: Improving Your Documents
When you’ve highlighted the subject of the comment, the next step is to 
create the comment. You have two choices:
 
✓ Choose Insert➪Comment.
 
✓ Click the Comment icon on the toolbar.
If necessary, the Comments pane is shown. If appropriate (such as words 
within a stream of text), the subject of the comment is highlighted. In all 
cases, a line is drawn from the comment subject to the Comments pane, 
where a comment bubble appears. The comment bubble is placed at the end 
of that line with the current date and time. Click in the bubble to type your 
comment. If your comment is emphatic, feel free to italicize it. Use bold text 
if you want to drive your point home. Your Pages text-editing tools work in 
comments as well as in the body of your documents.
Your comment is now linked to the document. The comment moves around 
the document as you move objects in the document. You can always hide 
the Comments pane if you don’t want to see the comments. If you want to 
remove a comment, click the X in the upper-right of the bubble and it will be 
removed. Note that I said removed, not hidden.
Printing a comment
You can print comments along with your document. This is particularly useful 
if you’re sharing a document with several people who may have to review it 
and act on the comments. Pages makes it simple to print comments. If the 
Comments pane is displayed, comments are printed, as shown in Figure 10-2.
 
Figure 10-2: 
Comments 
can be 
printed.
 
If the Comments pane is not displayed, comments are not printed, as shown 
in Figure 10-3. If you compare Figures 10-2 and 10-3, you see that the entire 
page image is made a bit smaller to allow for comments. This means that 
if you have a multipage document with comments only on some pages, all 
pages will be printed in the reduced size.

Tracking Changes
One of the best features of Microsoft Word is its ability to track changes. 
When Track Changes is turned on, Word keeps track of every change to the 
document whether it’s adding or deleting text, changing the format, or insert-
ing page breaks. It has several ways of displaying the changes, each of which 
is identified with its date and time as well as who has made the change. If 
several people are working on a document, you can see all their changes 
together.
Pages has implemented Track Changes functionality. It does almost every-
thing that Microsoft Word does — and it handles Microsoft Word track 
changes documents. Figure 10-4 shows a Pages document with Track 
Changes turned on. In fact, the document was created in Microsoft Word. It 
started with one sentence: This is a document without track changes turned 
on. Track changes was then turned on, and I changed without to with. That 
counts as two changes: the deletion of without and the addition of with. The 
document was saved in Microsoft Word, and it was opened in Pages. When 
Track Changes is on, the tracking bar appears below the format bar, and the 
changes are shown at the left in change bubbles.

Pages tracks changes to text and formatting, but it also tracks changes to 
objects in both word processing and page layout documents, as shown in 
Figure 10-5.
 
Figure 10-5: 
Changes in 
page layout 
documents 
are tracked.
 
Setting up Track Changes preferences
Preferences for Track Changes are set in General Preferences. Just choose 
Pages➪Preferences, and click the General tab, as shown in Figure 10-6.
At the bottom of the window is the Change Tracking section. The first item 
is the name that will be used for your changes. The name, like all the prefer-
ences here, applies to all your documents. Below your name, you can set 
preferences for how deleted and added text is displayed. This, too, applies to 
all your documents.
Inside your Pages documents, the changes are stored with all their details, 
including whether text has been added or deleted. Your preference deter-
mines how additions and deletions are shown on Pages documents on your 
computer. If you choose Strikethrough for deleted text, for example, that’s 
how it will appear. If you give that document to someone else who has 
chosen Underline as the indicator for deleted text, that’s how it will appear 
for them. Track Changes stores the action; your preferences (and your 
friends’ preferences) determine how the changes are displayed.

Starting and stopping Track Changes
The tracking bar appears when Track Changes is turned on for a document. 
You turn on Track Changes (and show the tracking bar) by clicking Track 
Changes on the toolbar. The Track Changes icon immediately changes to a 
Stop Tracking icon.
After you have turned on Track Changes, changes from that point on are 
tracked as you make them — unless you pause tracking as described later 
in this section. Each change is identified with your user name and the date 
and time of the change. In addition, as shown in Figures 10-4 and 10-5, each 
change has a check mark and an X in the upper right of its bubble. The check 
mark lets you accept a change, and the X lets you reject it.
When you accept a change, the change bubble disappears and the change 
is permanent (unless you change it again). When you reject a change, the 
change bubble disappears and the change is undone.
Track Changes stores its changes with the document each time you save it. 
If you have changes that have not been accepted or rejected, you can’t turn 
Track Changes off. If you try to stop tracking with unresolved changes, you 
see the dialog shown in Figure 10-7.

Viewing (and not viewing) changes
Although you can’t turn off Track Changes with unresolved changes, you 
don’t have to see them. You can accomplish this in several ways:
 
✓ Show or hide the Comments and Changes pane by choosing 
View➪Show/Hide Comments and Changes Pane or by clicking the View 
menu on the toolbar. You can also click the double-arrow at the far left 
of the tracking bar. Changes will still be tracked, but you won’t see them.
 
✓ Use the Tracking Bubbles menu at the left of the tracking bar to show or 
hide bubbles, as Figure 10-8 demonstrates. The bubbles disappear, but 
the Comments and Changes Pane is still visible.
 
✓ If Page Thumbnails are shown, the changes are highlighted on the 
thumbnails. This lets you quickly see which pages contain changes. You 
can click the thumbnail to go to that page immediately and deal with the 
change.
 
✓ Finally, if you hover your mouse over something that has been changed, 
you see a summary of the change, as shown in Figure 10-9. This can 
occur even if the change bubbles are not visible. This is particularly 
useful with text. Deleted and added text is highlighted in the document 
as it is changed, but the summary of the change adds the information of 
who did it and when.

Pausing Track Changes
Although you can’t turn Track Changes off with unresolved changes, you 
can use the tracking slider next to the Tracking Bubbles pop-up menu in the 
tracking bar to pause Track Changes and to turn it back on. This keeps Track 
Changes active (and keeps the tracking bar visible), but you can work for a 
while without your changes being tracked.
One reason for pausing Track Changes is if you are about to do a series of 
changes that will generate a number of change messages, each of which 
needs a response. Rearranging paragraphs in a lengthy document is an exam-
ple of this: Each paragraph is marked as changed when it is deleted and then 
marked as changed when it is inserted in its new location.
Accepting and rejecting changes
You can accept and reject changes in several ways:
 
✓ For a given change, click the check mark (accept) or X (reject) button 
in the upper right of the change bubble. The change is accepted or 
rejected and the bubble disappears.

173
 Chapter 10: Improving Your Documents
 
✓ Highlight a particular change bubble and click Accept or Reject at the 
center of the tracking bar.
 
✓ Use the up and down arrows in the center of the tracking bar to move to 
the previous or next change, respectively. The arrows are deliberately 
placed next to the Accept and Reject buttons so that you can quickly 
navigate through the changes and deal with them.
 
✓ Accept or reject all changes with a single command from the Action 
menu at the far right of the tracking bar, as shown in Figure 10-10.
 
Figure 10-10: 
Use the 
Action menu 
for more 
tracking 
commands.
 
Printing a clean copy without changes
The Action menu contains another useful command: Save a Copy as Final. 
This command saves a copy of the document with all changes accepted. Your 
original document still has the changes for you to accept or reject, but you 
have a copy that you can print or send to someone.

Advanced Word Processing 
Techniques
In This Chapter
▶ Formatting columns
▶ Paginating your document
▶ Creating a table of contents
Y
our word processing documents are already set up by Pages with a 
number of optional features: headers and footers, automatic page 
numbers, various margin controls, and the ability to create footnotes and to 
automatically update tables of contents (yes tables — you can have several in 
one document). These tools are valuable for all your documents, but they are 
particularly important for large documents.
Large documents — large Numbers spreadsheets and large Keynote 
presentations as well as large Pages documents — require special handling 
so that your readers don’t get lost (and so that you don’t get lost as you’re 
writing the document!). The challenges of a large spreadsheet are different 
from those of a large presentation or a large word processing document.
Working with Sections for Improved 
Formatting of Long Documents
Word processing documents consist of words, paragraphs, and pages. They 
also contain sections. Just as you can format words, paragraphs, and pages, 
you can also format sections. A section can be as small as part of a page or 
many pages long. In the case of a book, a section is usually a chapter.
Each section can contain its own formatting. Sections also may contain 
text that is either placeholder text you can replace or text that remains 
unchanged.

176
Part II: Turning the Page with Pages 
When you create a document from a template, all of the template’s sections 
are available, but not all of them are inserted into the initial version of the 
document. For example, the Project Proposal template, which is in the 
Reports section of templates, has the sections shown in Figure 11-1 built into 
the template. In a document created with the Project Proposal template, only 
the Cover and Executive Summary are used; you need to add any other 
sections that you want.
 
Figure 11-1: 
Templates 
come with 
at least one 
section 
already 
defined.
 
Adding a section to a document
Here’s how to add a section to a document:
 
1. Position the cursor where you want to insert the section.
 
 Most sections in the templates automatically begin on a new page. You 
can change this setting for individual sections after you’ve inserted 
them.
 
2. Insert the section:
 
• Choose Insert➪Section to display a submenu of the document’s 
sections (refer to Figure 11-1). Choose the one you want to insert.
 
• Display the same menu by clicking the Sections icon on the toolbar.

177
 Chapter 11: Advanced Word Processing Techniques
Rearranging sections
If you have page thumbnails displayed, you can use sections to improve your 
navigation. Figure 11-2 shows page thumbnails in a document that has two 
sections. The first section contains one page, and the second section has two 
pages. The second section is selected, as you can tell by the yellow border 
around its pages.
 
Figure 11-2: 
Pages can 
be grouped 
into 
sections.
 
You can move a section by dragging it in the page thumbnails. As soon as you 
start to drag a page that is inside a section, the section collapses into a single 
page image with a number in the lower right showing you how many pages 
are in the section. Figure 11-3 shows what happens as you drag the two-page 
section in Figure 11-2.

178

Formatting Your Document and Sections
Sections exist in every document. A page layout document in Pages has one 
section for each page. By default, a blank word processing document has 
a single section. As you add pages, they are added to this section. You are 
never without a section in a Pages document, whether you know it or not.
The fact that you always have a section in a Pages document matters because 
many of the format settings you use actually apply to sections. In the basic 
case of a word processing document with all the pages in one section, there 
is no practical difference between settings for the document and the section. 
But as soon as you have two or more sections in the document, those section 
settings become important.
When you’re formatting text, you select whatever you want to format and use 
commands or the inspector to format the selected text. When you’re format-
ting sections, you click anywhere in the section to format it using the inspec-
tor. If you’re formatting a document, you do not need to click anywhere; as 
long as the document is open in your window, your inspector settings will 
apply to it. The only time you really have to worry about carefully selecting 

179
 Chapter 11: Advanced Word Processing Techniques
text to format is when you’re working with part of a section. Otherwise, a click 
anywhere in the section will let you format the entire section, and a click any-
where in the document will let you format the entire document.
If the inspector is not visible, open it using one of these techniques:
 
✓ Choose View➪Show Inspector to open the inspector.
 
✓ Click the Inspector icon, at the right of the toolbar.
If you already have an inspector open, you can choose View➪New Inspector 
to open another inspector. If more than one inspector is open, clicking the 
Inspector icon on the toolbar closes all of them. You can also use the close 
box in individual inspectors to close them.
Most of the settings described here use Document inspector (the leftmost 
icon in the Inspector window) and Layout inspector (the next icon in the 
Inspector window).
Setting document information
Document inspector, shown in Figure 11-4, has three tabs:
 
✓ Document: This controls document settings such as margins.
 
✓ TOC: This controls the table of contents.
 
✓ Info: This displays the statistics for the document (the number of 
words, for example) and lets you enter a title and an author. This infor-
mation is available as part of the file; it is not automatically displayed in 
the document itself.
Setting the document information is a good idea so that you can discover a 
year from now why you created the document. If you’re working with a spe-
cific document length in mind (perhaps for a school assignment), Document 
inspector is where you check how close you are to your goal.
Setting document margins
Use the Document tab of Document inspector (see Figure 11-5) to set the 
document’s basic margins.
If you’re using a standard paper size, you can usually use the default settings. 
If you need to change the paper size, click the Page Setup button at the top of 
the inspector to open the standard Mac OS X Page Setup dialog.

181
 Chapter 11: Advanced Word Processing Techniques
The Facing Pages check box lets you create margins for a document that will 
be printed on both sides of the paper and prepared like a book. The left and 
right margins are changed to Inside and Outside, respectively. Visualize a 
book open to two facing pages. On the left page, the inside margin is the right 
margin (nearest the binding) and the outside margin is the left margin. On 
the right page, the opposite is true: The inside margin is the left margin and 
the outside margin is the right margin. Pages keeps track of which margin is 
which on different pages. That is, neither page is inside or outside. Each page 
has both an inside margin and an outside margin.
 
If you’re planning to use facing pages, you have to help Pages by inserting 
blank pages where necessary. For facing pages to work, each part of the 
document must have an even number of pages. Fortunately, if you’re working 
with sections, these blank pages are inserted for you automatically.
Setting multiple columns
One of the reasons for using sections is so that you can apply formatting 
to an entire section. In the cases of margins and columns, you may want to 
apply formatting to only part of a section; to do so, you create layouts. This 
section shows you how to set multiple columns for a layout.
Sometimes an entire section or even an entire document is presented in col-
umns. Other times you have columns in only part of a document — perhaps 
only on part of a page.
You always have at least one layout in your document. If you want another 
layout, position the cursor where you want the new layout to begin and 
choose Insert➪Layout Break. Now you’ll be able to change the formatting 
of either layout independently. If you want a section with columns such as 
the one at the front of this book, you would have your initial layout for the 
one-column text, then you’d insert a layout break to be able to format a two-
column layout, and after that you’d insert a layout break to be able to format 
the remaining text as one column.
The most basic layout has a single column. You need to add new layouts only 
if you want to change to multiple columns (or back to one) or to change the 
margins just for that layout.
Use Layout Inspector, shown in Figure 11-6, to set the column settings for 
each layout. Note that you can force a layout to begin on a new page; this 
command is available for every layout except the first one, which already 
starts on a new page.

182
Part II: Turning the Page with Pages 
 
Figure 11-6: 
Use Layout 
inspector to 
set columns.
 
Paginating your document
Use the Section tab of Layout inspector to control pagination of your docu-
ment. You can number each section separately or number all the pages of the 
document together, as shown in Figure 11-7.
 
Figure 11-7: 
Control 
pagination 
from Layout 
inspector.
 
Here’s a practical example of how you can use sections and automatic Pages 
tools to format a lengthy document such as The Pickwick Papers docu-
ment, which you can download from the author’s site as described in the 
Introduction.
With the document still in one section, the section settings are shown in 
Figure 11-7. Insert a page number in the footer by choosing Insert➪Automatic 
Page Numbers, which opens the dialog shown in Figure 11-8. Note that Pages 
provides you with the option to align numbers at the left, right, or center as 
well as at the inside and outside margins.

183
 Chapter 11: Advanced Word Processing Techniques
 
Figure 11-8: 
Insert 
automatic 
page 
numbers.
 
Now, break the document into chapter sections. You do this by positioning 
the cursor just before the start of each chapter (before the C in Chapter), 
and choosing Insert➪Section Break. It’s important to do this after you have 
formatted the unbroken section containing all the pages, because when you 
insert the breaks for each chapter, the settings from the previous section 
are carried forward. You can change each section, but in this case, you want 
each section to have the same type of formatting.
Sometimes making the first page different lets you add special formatting to 
it; other times, you want to add special formatting to the other pages. In our 
example, the first page is marked as being different, as shown in Figure 11-7. 
Type the name of the chapter into the header on the second page, and the 
chapter name will appear in the header of every page except the first one 
(which already contains the chapter title). Because the first page is marked 
as being different, if you type a header for this page, the header text will 
appear only on the first page.
If you indicate that each section should begin on a right-hand page, Pages will 
insert blank pages if necessary to force the first page of each section to be a 
right-hand page.
Creating and Updating 
Tables of Contents
Particularly when it comes to long documents, a table of contents is a great 
tool for your readers. Pages can automatically create a table of contents for 
you. It does this by relying on the styles you use in the document. You don’t 
mark items to appear in the table of contents; instead you use a specific style 
for the table of contents items (there can be more than one), and that style is 
automatically picked up by Pages.

184
Part II: Turning the Page with Pages 
You don’t have to use the styles that Pages provides: Any styles that you use 
in your document can be in a table of contents. However, you must use the 
styles consistently. For example, if you want each chapter title to be placed 
in the table of contents, the chapter title should always use a unique style. If 
you want headings placed in the table of contents, those, too, should use a 
unique style.
Here’s how to create a table of contents:
 
1. Create a table of contents page or section in your document.
 
• If you’re using a Pages template, look for a section called Table of 
Contents. Position the cursor where you want to insert the table 
of contents, and then either choose Insert➪Sections➪Table of 
Contents or click the Sections menu on the toolbar. This is the 
easiest method.
 
• Position the cursor where you want the table of contents and 
choose Insert➪Table of Contents. This inserts the table of contents 
code into your document as part of an existing section rather than 
as a separate section.
 
2. Specify the table of contents.
 
 Open Document inspector to the TOC tab, as shown in Figure 11-9, to set 
up your table of contents. All of the styles you’ve used in the document 
are shown. Select the check box to the left of each style that you want to 
appear in the table of contents.
 
 You can use the check box on the right to make the page numbers for 
entries into links that take you from the table of contents to the page 
in question. (Obviously, this works only with the online version of 
documents.)
 
3. Create the table of contents by clicking the Update Now button.
 
 The table of contents will be automatically updated in the future when-
ever you save the document, but you can always regenerate it using the 
Update Now button.
 
 If the Update Now button is dimmed, chances are you forgot Step 1, cre-
ating the table of contents section in your document. Pages will have 
nowhere to place the table of contents so it can’t generate it.
 
4. Format your table of contents.
 
 Go to the newly generated table of contents and open the Styles drawer, 
(Choose View➪Show Styles Drawer or use the View menu on the tool-
bar) as shown in Figure 11-10. The styles in the table of contents are 
named after the styles used for table of contents entries, but the style 
names are preceded by TOC.

Create a 
table of 
contents.
 
 
Figure 11-10: 
Format your 
table of 
contents.
 

186
Part II: Turning the Page with Pages 
 
5. Select the table of contents and click the Tabs pane of Text inspector, 
shown in Figure 11-11.
 
 One of the most common formatting changes for a table of contents is 
to add dots or dashes, called leaders, between the entry and the page 
number. As you see in Figure 11-11, a single tab stop is defined for each 
TOC style. Select that tab stop and choose the type of leader you want. 
The entry you selected changes immediately. If you don’t like the look, 
try another leader character.
 
 You can change other formatting as well. For example, you may want 
to indent subheadings in the table of contents beneath chapter or sec-
tion titles. If you do so, you may want the subheading page numbers 
indented from the right.
 
Figure 11-11: 
Reformat a 
table of 
contents 
entry.
 
 
6. Update the style.
 
 Click the downward-pointing arrow next to the style name in the Styles 
drawer, and choose Redefine Style from Selection, as shown in Figure 11-12. 
The formatting is applied to every entry that uses this style.

187
 Chapter 11: Advanced Word Processing Techniques
 
Figure 11-12:

style.
 
Your table of contents takes shape before your eyes. And Pages remembers 
your style changes, so the TOC styles appear the same whenever you update 
your table of contents.

Counting on 
Numbers

In this part . . .
N
umbers is the most recent addition to the iWork 
suite of applications. To call it a spreadsheet 
doesn’t do it justice; it’s like no other spreadsheet you’ve 
probably ever seen. Sure, you can create enormous sheets 
of rows and columns, but Numbers makes it easy to cre-
ate useful and understandable spreadsheets. If you want 
to mystify people with your ability to throw hundreds (or 
thousands) of numbers on a page, you may want to look 
for another spreadsheet application. But if you want to 
use the iWork features to clarify your data and demystify 
all those numbers, Numbers is for you.

Chapter 12
Getting to Know Numbers
In This Chapter
▶ Finding out why tables matter
▶ Exploring the Numbers window
▶ Using the Numbers toolbar
Y
ou’ve never seen a spreadsheet like a Numbers spreadsheet. Something 
about spreadsheets turns even the most imaginative and creative 
person into a zombie wandering through a maze with an infinite number of 
rows and columns. Well, in most cases it’s not infinite — in Microsoft Excel, 
somewhere around 1 million rows and 16,000 columns give you 17 billion 
cells you can use in your spreadsheet.
Numbers can be described in many ways, but one of the most direct is this: 
Numbers gives you every tool and technique the people of Apple could think 
of to help you manage your data without getting lost in 17 billion cells on 
a single spreadsheet. This chapter gives you an introduction to Numbers, 
starting with the basic design that tames spreadsheets and continuing with a 
guide to the features and functions in the Numbers window.
Taming the Spreadsheet 
Jungle with Tables
In 1979, at the dawn of the personal computer era, the VisiCalc spreadsheet 
program, written for the Apple II, was one of the most popular programs. It 
was a fair representation of large accounting sheets with rows and columns 
that could accept any kind of data you entered. One spreadsheet was one file.
People quickly started bumping up against that limitation, and two changes 
came about over time:

192
Part III: Counting on Numbers 
 
✓ Tables within spreadsheets: Even though early spreadsheets were 
smaller than today’s models, they still had almost unlimited rows and 
columns. People quickly learned that they could use a few rows and col-
umns for a specific purpose, creating subspreadsheets or tables on that 
vast grid of cells. This made sense because within a single spreadsheet, 
it is possible to easily connect one set of cells to another. This means 
that these subspreadsheets and tables could automatically be updated if 
only one number was changed.
 
✓ Linked spreadsheets: There were issues with dumping multiple tables 
into a single spreadsheet. People clamored for the ability to have one 
spreadsheet automatically update and respond to updates in other 
spreadsheets in other files. Microsoft addressed this by creating docu-
ments called workbooks; each workbook can have a number of spread-
sheets, all of which can communicate with one another. Today, when 
you create a Microsoft Excel document, you get a workbook with three 
sheets to start with.
The people at Apple took this decades-long history and designed Numbers in 
a radical, new way: It’s designed not the way software designers think people 
should use a spreadsheet, but the way people have been using spreadsheets 
for three decades.
Adding tables to spreadsheets
When you create a Numbers document, you have three things to work with:
 
✓ A Numbers document: This is the container for everything. It’s similar 
to a Microsoft Excel workbook.
 
✓ One of more sheets: You have one or more spreadsheets (sheets in the 
Numbers world of simplicity).
 
✓ Zero or more tables: The subspreadsheets or tables that people 
have been creating in Microsoft Excel and other spreadsheets exist in 
Numbers as formal structured tables. Numbers gives them a specific 
name: tables. (And, yes, you can have a Numbers document with no 
tables, you have to have at least one sheet.)
The simple idea of making tables into an actual part of the Numbers applica-
tion rather than letting people create them any which way leads to a major 
change in the way you can use Numbers when compared to an old-fashioned 
spreadsheet.

193
 Chapter 12: Getting to Know Numbers
Working with tables
Now that tables are part of the software, Numbers can provide tools for man-
aging them in ways that were not possible before (because tables as such 
never existed before for most people). You can see this in documents created 
from the Numbers templates such as the Travel Planner, which is used in this 
section.
Selecting tables
Because a table is a Numbers object, you can select it. This is not the same 
as selecting the cells in a subspreadsheet table. You don’t have to worry 
about accidentally including or excluding cells that you don’t want in the sub-
spreadsheet table. A Numbers table has defined boundaries.
To select a table, move the pointer over the border of the table until it 
changes to a black cross, as shown in Figure 12-1. You can also click the table 
in the Sheets pane to the left of the window. (You find out more about the 
Sheets pane later in this chapter.)
 
Figure 12-1: 
You can 
select 
tables.
 

194
Part III: Counting on Numbers 
Moving and resizing tables
The sheet in Figure 12-1 has three tables. You can select a table and move it. 
As you drag it, you can see its current location (this is a preference you turn 
on and off).
Also, when a table is selected, the same eight handles you see on any 
selected shape in any iWork application are available so that you can resize 
the table.
Selecting table cells
You can select a cell in a table by clicking the cell. When you do, reference 
tabs appear at the top and sides of the table, as shown in Figure 12-2. The ref-
erence tabs have row numbers and column letters — just like old-fashioned 
spreadsheets.
Numbers tables or iWork tables?
If tables are so important, and if Pages and 
Keynote both support them, why not just live 
your life with tables in Pages and Keynote? Until 
iWork ’08 and the debut of Numbers, that’s just 
what many people did. But many others found 
that although the tables in Keynote and Pages 
were powerful, they did not have all the fea-
tures needed for spreadsheet development. 
Adding all that functionality to the basic iWork 
table structure would have added complexity to 
all iWork applications.
We now have the best of both worlds. If you 
want high-end spreadsheet tools, you can use 
Numbers, which has basic iWork shapes, text 
boxes, and media content features just like the 
other iWork applications. And if you want basic 
table functionality, you can use Keynote or 
Pages with the standard iWork tables. Just as 
the distinction between page layout and word 
processing documents depends in many cases 
on an individual’s preferences, the choice of 
tables in Pages or Keynote or tables in Numbers 
often is a matter of personal preference.
If you are accustomed to using spreadsheet 
applications, Numbers is probably a good 
choice for you. Although it goes dramatically 
beyond applications such as Microsoft Excel, it 
still has a more “spreadsheety” feel. If spread-
sheets give you a headache, try Numbers 
anyway, because it may cure that headache 
forever. If it doesn’t, rest assured that you can 
do sophisticated table management in Keynote 
and Pages.

Creating a Numbers Document
The best way to get an overview of Numbers is to create a document and 
explore it. This section provides a high-level view. Later in this chapter and in 
the other chapters in Part III, you explore Numbers documents in more detail.

Creating the document
As with all iWork applications, we begin by creating a document from a tem-
plate, as shown in Figure 12-4. Choose File➪New Document from Template in 
Numbers to open this window.
 
Figure 12-4: 
Create a 
document 
from a 
Numbers 
template.
 
As you browse through the templates, remember that moving the pointer 
over a template’s thumbnail image lets you see additional pages in the tem-
plate. Explore the templates to get an idea of what you can do with Numbers. 
For most of this chapter, the Travel Planner template is used.
Create a document based on the Travel Planner template by double-clicking 
the Travel Planner template or by selecting it and clicking the Choose button 
in the lower right of the window. Your screen will look like Figure 12-5.
Exploring the Travel Planner document
The window shown in Figure 12-5 has six sections. The template has other 
sections, but this is the initial display. I go over each section in turn.

Sheet
The main part of the window displays a sheet from the document. The sheet 
can contain tables as well as other iWork objects such as shapes, text boxes, 
and media. You insert them from the toolbar or the Insert menu, as in any 
iWork application. This is a major difference between Numbers and other 
spreadsheet applications.
Choose Edit➪Select All to select all the objects in the document. Figure 12-6 
shows that the sheet has one table plus a text box for the title, a background 
shape for the title’s background, a colored background for the center part of 
the sheet, five photos, a shape that is the map, and round shapes along with 
text boxes for the place names on the map. These objects are placed on the 
sheet, not inside a table or table cells.
Toolbar
At the top of Figure 12-6, you see the Numbers toolbar. It contains buttons 
that are specific to Numbers as well as many that are common to other iWork 
applications, such as View, Charts, Text Box, Shapes, Inspector, Media, 
Colors, and Fonts. These buttons function as they do in the other applica-
tions. (The Inspector window has customized Numbers panes, as you will 
see.) Tables, Functions, and Reorganize are unique to Numbers.

198

Figure 12-6: 
Select all 
the objects 
in the sheet.
 
Format bar
The format bar is shown just below the toolbar. Like the toolbar, it can be 
shown or hidden. It has Numbers-specific features.
Sheets pane
At the left, you see the Sheets pane. It looks somewhat like the Page 
Thumbnails pane in Pages and the Slides pane in Keynote. Unlike those, how-
ever, the Sheets pane cannot be hidden, but you can resize it by dragging the 
divider between it and the sheet canvas to the left or right.
The Sheets pane shows the structure of the document. As you can see in 
Figure 12-6, there are three sheets — Activity List, Reservations, and Packing 
List — each of which contains tables (such as Activities, Travel Party, and 
Gadgets).
When you select a sheet or any table within a sheet, the sheet and all of its 
tables are highlighted. You can use the triangle to the left of a sheet name to 
collapse it, as shown in Figure 12-7.
 
Sheets can contain not only tables but also charts. Tables include data shown 
in rows and columns; charts are graphs based on the tabular data.
At the bottom of the Sheets pane are the Styles pane and the instant calculations.

199

sheets.
 
Styles pane
Each table can have its own table style. Templates come with styles designed 
specifically for that template; you can add your own styles and modify the 
styles in your document. When you select a cell in a table, the Styles pane 
reflects the style for that table, as shown in Figure 12-8.
 
Figure 12-8:

in a table to 
highlight 
the table’s

Styles pane.
 
If you want to change the table’s style, just click another style in the Styles 
pane, as shown in Figure 12-9.
Much as in the Pages Styles drawer, a triangle appears next to the selected 
style. You can click it to open the menu shown in Figure 12-10.

table styles.
 
If you’ve modified a table’s style, the Styles menu is where you can decide 
whether to change the style in every table that uses it or to create a new style.
Instant calculation results
One of the most useful Numbers features is the set of instant calculation 
results at the bottom of the Styles pane. In Figure 12-11, a column of numbers 
has been selected in the second table. (To make the numbers easier to read, 
they’ve been enlarged and are shown in bold.)
The instant calculation section automatically displays the results of a calcula-
tion using any selected cells. The selected cells can be a row, a column, or 
part of a row or column as well as noncontiguous cells selected by Ô-clicking 
cells within a single table. The calculation results are sum, average, minimum 
value, maximum value, and count (the number of nonblank entries). You 
don’t have to do anything for instant calculations to appear. They appear 
whenever your selection permits it.

Creating and Editing Numbers 
Documents
In This Chapter
▶ Creating and formatting tables
▶ Using and formatting headers
▶ Taking advantage of cell formatting
S
ometimes you can use an iWork template without any changes: Just type 
your text into a newsletter layout in Pages, use Keynote slides with no 
changes except for your text, or use a Numbers template just by typing your 
data. Other times, you want to customize the template in various ways, such 
as providing custom formatting for cells and creating your own headers for 
rows and columns. This chapter gets into the structure of Numbers documents, 
focusing on sheets and tables as well as basic formulas and common procedures 
such as sorting and filtering data.
Creating Sheets and Tables
Unless you’re using a template without structural changes, such as adding 
new sheets, charts, or tables, you’ll find yourself creating these objects. 
Chapter 15 is your resource for charts; this section shows you how to create 
new sheets and tables.
Creating sheets
You use sheets to organize your tables, charts, and other iWork elements 
such as shapes, text boxes, and media. Sheets are often designed to be 
printed, so iWork provides a print view so you can see what the sheet will 
look like when printed.

204
Part III: Counting on Numbers 
You can put all your charts and tables into a single sheet, or you can put one 
chart or table into each sheet. Most of the time, you decide which tables go 
into which sheets by taking into account what is most logical and how you 
need to print your data (if you need to print it at all). Most people make a 
case-by-case decision based on their way of working and the complexity of 
the data.
Here’s how to create a sheet:
 
1. Click Sheets on the toolbar to add a sheet or choose Insert➪Sheet.
 
 The sheet is named with a default name such as Sheet 1, Sheet 2, and so 
forth.
 
2. Double-click the name of the sheet in the Sheets pane and type a 
descriptive name.
 
 Alternatively, display Sheet inspector by opening an inspector and 
clicking the Sheet button (the second from the left in Figure 13-1). 
Figure 13-1 shows both methods of changing a sheet’s name: changing 
the name in the Sheets pane and changing the name in Sheet inspector.
 
Figure 13-1: 
Provide a 
meaningful 
name for 
sheets as 
soon as you 
create them.
 
Creating tables
When you create a sheet, you automatically create a table within it. You can 
add charts or more tables to the sheet along with shapes, text boxes, and 
media. You can delete any of these objects to create an empty sheet, but by 
default, each new sheet contains a table.

205
 Chapter 13: Creating and Editing Numbers Documents
You can create six types of tables:
 
✓ Headers: Creates a table with headers for the rows and columns.
 
✓ Basic: Has headers only for the columns.
 
✓ Sums: A basic table that also has a row at the bottom with summary 
functions that add the numbers in each column. You can always delete 
sums for any column you don’t want summed. Numbers handles nonnu-
meric values appropriately so that text is not added in some mysterious 
manner to a numeric summary if you happen to type text such as N/A 
for a cell’s value.
 
✓ Plain: The most basic table; it has no headers and no sums.
 
✓ Checklist: Has a header for columns and a column of check boxes at the 
left of the table.
 
✓ Sums Checklist: This combines a checklist and sums, with a header for 
each column, a check box at the left of each row, and a sum calculation 
at the bottom of each column.
If you want to create a new table, here’s what you do:
 
1. Select the sheet that the table will be placed in.
 
 Select the sheet in the Sheets pane either by clicking the sheet name to 
select the sheet and all its contents or by clicking a chart or table within 
the sheet. The Sheet and all its contents are selected.
 
2. Click the Tables menu on the toolbar and select the type of table you 
want to create, as shown in Figure 13-2.
 
 You can access this menu also by choosing Insert➪Table.
 
Figure 13-2: 
Choose a 
table.
 
 
3. Double-click the name of the table in the Sheets pane or in Table 
inspector, as shown in Figure 13-3, and type a meaningful name.
 
 The check box to the left of the table name in Table inspector controls 
whether or not the table name is shown above the table on your sheet.

206
Part III: Counting on Numbers 
 
Figure 13-3: 
Name the 
table as 
soon as you 
create it.
 
Working with Headers
After you’ve created a table, you can change its headers and other settings, 
although you can’t change one type of table (such as Sums) into another type 
(such as Checklist). One way around this limitation, however, is to change 
the separate settings for check boxes, sums, and headers.
Spreadsheets label columns with letters (A, B, C, and so on) and rows with 
numbers (1, 2, 3, and so on). Each cell within a table is uniquely identified 
with a letter and number: The cell in the upper left of a spreadsheet is A1. 
The Financials template (part of the Business category of Numbers tem-
plates) provides an example of how headers can work.
Figure 13-4 is the Income table in the Income Statement sheet for the 
Financials template.
The cell containing the word EXAMPLE is in column C and row 7; its identifier is 
C7. However, because the first row of the table is a header row and because 
the first column of the table is a header column, the text in those headers 
can also identify the cell: 2007 Depreciation and Amortization. In Numbers, 
you do not name cells. Instead, you name their column and row headers, and 
Numbers uses those to name each cell.
If Numbers can’t find a header for a cell’s row or column, it reverts to the 
old letter-and-number naming, such as C7. It also reverts to the old letter-
and-number naming if you have duplicate header names. If, for example, you 

207
 Chapter 13: Creating and Editing Numbers Documents
change the column for 2006 and type 2007 in its header, you’ll have two 2007 
header columns. In the case of such duplication, Numbers provides you with 
a reliable (but less user-friendly) letter-and-number name.
 
Figure 13-4: 
Understand 
how 
Numbers 
uses 
headers.
 
 
Because Numbers is going to be using your header names to label cells, those 
names should be unique and descriptive. You only have to type them once. 
Numbers can handle duplicate names, but why complicate your life?
Numbers will revert to letter-and-number naming also if you don’t have head-
ers or don’t have both row and column headers. Whenever possible, use 
both row and column headers, either by creating a table with both of them 
(the headers table) or by adding headers to your table.
Adjusting the number of header 
rows and columns in a table
Follow these steps to adjust the number of header rows and columns:
 
1. Select the table.
 
2. Open Table inspector.
 
 If you don’t have an Inspector window open, open one by clicking 
Inspector on the toolbar. Then click the Table button (it’s the third 
button from the left).

208
Part III: Counting on Numbers 
 
3. In the Headers & Footer section, choose the number of rows or 
columns for each type of header and footer.
 
 The three icons shown in Figure 13-5 let you set the number of header 
rows or columns for columns, headers, and footers (reading from left to 
right).
 
Figure 13-5: 
Adjust 
headers in a 
table.
 
 
You can freeze header rows or columns (but not a footer row) using Table 
inspector. Freezing header rows or columns means that as you scroll through 
the table, the header rows or columns are always visible. If they’re not frozen, 
you can scroll them out of sight.
Formatting headers and 
creating a new style
Because headers are so important, you may want to emphasize them in your 
tables. Some of the templates have styles that clearly show headers in con-
trasting colors; others are more subtle. You may want a dramatic formatting 
for headers while you are entering data and a more standard formatting when 
you’re finished.

209
 Chapter 13: Creating and Editing Numbers Documents
Here’s how to change heading formatting and how to save it as a new style so 
that you can switch back and forth between the old and new styles of head-
ing formatting:
 
1. Select the header row (or rows) you want to format by clicking in 
the numbered label for the row at the left of the table, as shown in 
Figure 13-6.
 
 The small triangle brings up a contextual menu that lets you add or 
delete header rows or columns. You don’t need to worry about using it 
at this point.
 
Figure 13-6: 
Select a 
header row.
 
 
2. In Table inspector, make a selection in the Cell Background menu, as 
shown in Figure 13-7, and then select the color or image you want to use.
 
 Your choices are Color Fill, Gradient Fill, Image Fill, and Tinted Image Fill.
 
3. If you want a header column to be formatted, repeat Steps 1 and 2 
with the header column.
 
4. In the Styles pane, click the arrow next to the name of the current 
style and choose Create New Style, as shown in Figure 13-8.
 
5. Name the new style.
 
 The new style appears in the Styles pane and you can use it for any table 
in the document.

Use Table 
inspector to 
select a cell 
background 
for the 
selected 
row.
 
 
Figure 13-8:

 You can switch back and forth between styles at any time. Select the 
object to which you want to apply a style and then click the style name 
from the list in the Styles pane. The style will be changed immediately 
for the selected object.

211
 Chapter 13: Creating and Editing Numbers Documents
 
Just as using styles can improve Pages documents, styles can improve 
Numbers documents and save time. Instead of adjusting various table settings 
each time you want a new look, combine the settings into a new style that you 
can select with one click. Having many styles in the document is not a prob-
lem as long as you give them descriptive names so you can remember what 
they represent.
Formatting Cells
Each cell in a table can have its own formatting. You use the format bar to set 
basic formatting such as fonts and alignment. Cells inspector lets you set the 
way data in the cell (or range of selected cells) is displayed with decimals, 
currency symbols, and so forth.
Using basic formats for cells
Figure 13-9 shows the Cells inspector window. The Cell Format pop-up menu 
(which is set to Number in Figure 13-9) determines the format. As you change 
its value, the middle of the Cells inspector window changes to provide addi-
tional settings for that format.
 
Figure 13-9: 
Format cells 
with Cells 
inspector.
 
If one cell is selected, the formatting affects only that cell. If you select a 
number of cells, the formatting you set affects all those cells. If you select 
a number of cells that have different formatting, the Cells inspector pop-up 
menu is blank (it cannot display more than a single value). When you choose 
a new format from the pop-up menu, it is applied to all of the selected cells.
Figure 13-10 shows the various formats built into Numbers.

212
Part III: Counting on Numbers 
 
Figure 13-10: 
Numbers 
comes 
with many 
built-in cell 
formats.
 
Many of the settings for cell formats appear in more than one cell format. 
Here are some of the settings that are available and the formats for which 
they can be set:
 
✓ Thousands separator: Most numeric formats let you choose whether 
or not to use a thousands separator. (You set this in Ô➪System 
Preferences using International and its Formats tab. For the United 
States, the thousands separator is a comma.) Available for Number, 
Currency, and Percentage.
 
✓ Negative number formats: Your choices are parentheses, the color red, 
or a minus sign. Sometimes a check box called Accounting Style is used 
for the option. Available for Number, Currency, and Percentage.
 
✓ Decimals: The number of decimal places to be used. Available for 
Number, Currency, Percentage, and Scientific.
 
✓ Currency symbol: With Cell inspector, you can change the currency 
symbol for specific cells in a spreadsheet. Available for Currency.
 
✓ Fractions: You can specify the amount of precision; examples are 
given such as 7/8 (one digit), 23/24 (two digits), halves, and quarters. 
Available for Fractions.
Using special formats for cells
Numbers has special formats that can make your tables much easier to use. 
These are standard Mac OS X controls that appear in a variety of applications 
such as iPhoto, Finder, and Bento:
 
✓ Check box: A check box is either checked or not. The first column of cells 
in the built-in checklist table consists of check boxes. Figure 13-11 shows 
a check box cell and the Cells inspector settings for it. The underlying 

213
 Chapter 13: Creating and Editing Numbers Documents
value of the cell is either TRUE or FALSE depending on whether or not it 
is checked. You can prove this for yourself by formatting a cell as a check 
box and then using Cells inspector to change it to text or automatic 
formatting. The value of the cell is maintained when its formatting is 
changed (this applies to all types of cells, not just check boxes).
 
✓ Stepper: This is another quick form of data entry. As you can see in 
Figure 13-12, you can use Cells inspector to specify the range of values 
that the stepper supports. Steppers are useful for limiting input to cer-
tain values. The stepper itself is shown only when the cell is selected. 
When it is not selected, the value of the cell is displayed.

boxes

off or true/

settings

Figure 13-12: 
Steppers let 
you move

values.
 

214
Part III: Counting on Numbers 
 
✓ Slider: A stepper lets you increase or decrease a value by a certain 
amount. A slider lets you move quickly across a range of values. As 
shown in Figure 13-13, you can also specify the range and the intervals 
that a slider represents. Like a stepper, the slider is displayed only when 
a cell is selected. At other times, the value is shown in the cell.
 
✓ Pop-up Menu: Pop-up menus work best for nonnumeric data, as shown 
in Figure 13-14. You start with three values. Double-click each row to 
type a new value. You can add or delete rows by using the + and - 
buttons at the lower left of the list of values.

Using Formulas and Functions
In This Chapter
▶ Creating formulas
▶ Using summary formulas
▶ Working with functions
▶ Using a lookup function
O
ne of the most important features of any spreadsheet is the ability to 
place formulas into cells. Other spreadsheets, such as Microsoft Excel, 
offer functions and formulas — often the same ones you find in Numbers. 
Spreadsheet users expect to find a SUM function along with a TODAY function 
and all the other functions that they’re accustomed to, particularly if they 
switch back and forth between spreadsheet applications or if they’re sharing 
their documents. What sets Numbers apart is the ease with which you can 
create and manage formulas along with the large number of templates that 
implement sophisticated uses of formulas and functions.
Starting to Use Formulas
Formulas can contain specific values (called constants and sometimes literals); 
they also can contain references to cells in the spreadsheet. If a formula 
contains a reference to a cell, every time that cell’s value is updated, the 
formula is reevaluated. A formula can contain a reference to a cell that itself 
contains a formula. There is no limit to the number of formulas in the chain 
of formulas for a given cell. Whenever the first value in the chain is changed, 
every formula is reevaluated. The only limitation to this chain of formulas 
is that it has to be a single path. You can’t create what is called a circular 
reference, a formula that relies on evaluating a previous cell that contains a 
formula that includes the current cell. This would require that each cell be 
evaluated before the other one is evaluated — something that is logically 
impossible. One of them has to be first and one has to be second.

216
Part III: Counting on Numbers 
In addition to cell references and constants, formulas can contain functions, 
such as a function that sums a set of numbers. Formulas also can provide 
information that doesn’t rely on values in the spreadsheet. For example, the 
TODAY function in most spreadsheets returns today’s date. If you’re working 
late and the clock strikes midnight, the TODAY function will return the date 
for the new day.
Using a formula to summarize data
Perhaps the most common formula is a summary at the bottom of a column, 
which is where most people place a summary when they work with paper 
and pencil. Summaries can also appear at the top of a column on the right or 
left of a row. Spreadsheets also make it easy to place a row or column summary 
in another location on the spreadsheet (perhaps a section of summary data 
in which all sums are shown for all relevant columns or rows). The built-in 
tables have built-in summary formats; the Sums and Sums Checklist tables 
have built-in summaries at the bottom of each column.
The example in this section uses the Financials template in the Business 
section of Numbers templates, as shown in Figure 14-1. Some test data has 
been entered for the figures in this section.
 
Figure 14-1: 
Summarize 
data in 
columns 
and 
sections of 
columns.
 

217
 Chapter 14: Using Formulas and Functions
If you experiment with the template, you’ll see that the summary at the 
bottom of the table is not the sum of all the numbers in a column. Rather, the 
column has several sections, each of which is summed:
 
✓ Total Current Assets ($850): This is the sum of rows 3 through 9. It has 
distinct formatting to separate it from the detail lines above it.
 
✓ Total Net Fixed Assets ($7,000): This is the sum of rows 13 through 18.
 
✓ Total Assets ($7,850): This is the sum of Total Current Assets and Total 
Net Fixed Assets. If you added all the numbers in the column, you would 
get a column total that is exactly twice what it should be because it 
would include both the detail rows (3 through 9 and 13 through 18) and 
their subtotals.
 
Summarizing data that already includes subsummaries is one of the most 
frequent spreadsheet errors. Always do a reality check on your formulas. The 
arithmetic total of all numbers in the Q1 column in Figure 14-1 is 23,550. The 
total of all the detail lines is $7,850, which is the real total not including sub-
summaries.
In the Financials template, the correct summarization has all been done for 
you. If you had to work from scratch, here’s how to do subsummaries such 
as Total Current Assets and Total Net Fixed Assets as well as the grand sum-
mary, Total Assets:
 
1. Remove the formulas from the Financials template.
 
 This lets you practice implementing the formulas for yourself. Select the 
cells that summarize data (B10 through E10 for Total Current Assets, 
B19 through E19 for Total Net Fixed Assets, and B21 through E21 for 
Total Assets). Then choose Edit➪Delete. This deletes data values and 
formulas but leaves the formatting intact.
 
2. Check that all formulas have been removed.
 
 After you delete the formulas, the summary cells will be blank. If any 
cell displays $0, it means that a subsummary cell (such as Total Current 
Assets) has been cleared but the grand total (Total Assets) retains its 
formula. Except for the cells in which data is typed, you should not have 
any numbers in the main part of the table.
Creating formulas using the SUM 
function and a range of cells
The first summary to create is the Q1 summary of Total Current Assets. Then 
you can copy it to Q2, Q3, and Q4. Follow these steps:

218
Part III: Counting on Numbers 
 
1. Begin to build the formula.
 
 In cell B10 (Q1 Total Current Assets), type =. Typing = at the beginning 
of a cell starts to build a formula. Formula Editor opens, as shown in 
Figure 14-2.
 
Figure 14-2: 
Open 
Formula 
Editor by 
typing = in 
the cell.
 
 
2.  Select the cells you want to summarize.
 
 In this case, select cells B3 through B9 (Cash, Accounts Receivable, 
–Doubtful Accounts, Inventory, Temporary Investments, Prepaid 
Expenses, and Other Current Assets). Formula Editor displays the cells 
you’re summarizing, as shown in Figure 14-3. By default, it uses the SUM 
function.
 
3. Click the check mark to accept the formula and close Formula Editor.
 
 The calculation is performed, as shown in Figure 14-4.
 
 Verify that the formula is working correctly by changing various 
numbers in the cells that are part of the formula; the result will change.
 
4. Copy the formula from Q1 to the Q2, Q3, and Q4 cells.
 
 The simplest way is to select the Q1 cell, where you’ve created the 
formula, and drag to add Q2, Q3, and Q4 to the selection. Choose 
Insert➪Fill➪Fill Right to fill the formula into the other selected cells.
 
 Note that you can fill right or down. The first cell in the selection must 
contain the formula you want to fill to the adjoining cells. If a formula 
uses other cells in its calculation, the filled formula cells will use the 
appropriate numbers. In other words, the Total Current Assets formula 
that is filled into Q2 will use the Q2 data values, not the Q1 data values.

data.
 
 
Figure 14-4:

Create the subsummary formulas for Total Net Fixed Assets in the same way. 
SUM is the default function, but there are 250 built-in functions. The most 
commonly used functions are available from the Function menu on the tool-
bar. Select the cells you want to use in the function, then click Function on 
the toolbar and choose the function, as shown in Figure 14-5.

220
Part III: Counting on Numbers 
 
Figure 14-5: 
Use other 
functions.
 
Creating formulas by selecting 
individual cells
Sometimes you don’t want to use a range of cells in a formula. That’s the 
case for the Total Assets formulas for the bottom row in the sample table. It 
should summarize just two cells: the value for Total Current Assets and Total 
Net Fixed Assets.
Here’s how to add the subtotals for Total Assets:
 
1. Open Formula Editor by typing = in the Q1 Total Assets cell.
 
2. Click in the cells you want to include in the formula.
 
 Click Q1 Total Current Assets and Q1 Total Net Fixed Assets. The cells 
are added to the formula, separated by + signs, as shown in Figure 14-6.
 
 If you’ve specified headers, Numbers attempts to use the cell names it 
generates from the headers. If it can’t use them, it uses the cell letter 
and cell number names.
Editing formulas
When you select a cell that contains a formula, the formula bar appears. It’s 
just below the toolbar in Figure 14-6. If you’ve chosen to show the format bar, 
it appears between the toolbar and the formula bar.

221
 Chapter 14: Using Formulas and Functions
 
Figure 14-6: 
Build a 
formula by 
clicking the 
cells to use.
 
As you build a formula, it appears in both the formula bar and Formula 
Editor. You can click in the formula in either place and type additional text. If 
you select a cell or a range of cells, the cell or cells are added to the formula. 
You can also type the name of a cell by using the letter-and-number notation. 
By default, the + sign separates items in the formula.
You can use parentheses in complex formulas to indicate the order in which 
calculations should be carried out. Parentheses have the same meaning that 
they do in programming languages or algebra: Items within parentheses are eval-
uated first. Then the result of that evaluation is used to continue the formula.
Refining cell references
When you add a cell to a formula, either by typing its letter and number or 
by clicking it, that cell is referenced relative to the cell of the formula that is 
being built. For example, in building the subsummary for Q1 Total Current 
Assets, the range of cells above the Q1 Total Current Assets cell is selected. 
When you fill that formula to the right, the formulas in the cells for Q2, Q3, 
and Q4 Total Current Assets use the corresponding cells above them. This is 
also true if you copy and paste a formula. For example, if you copy and paste 
the formula from Q1 Total Current Assets anywhere else, it summarize the 
seven cells above it — whatever the values of those cells may be — just as it 
does in the original Q1 Total Current Assets formula.
Sometimes you don’t want this behavior. When you want to refine a cell refer-
ence in a formula, using the formula bar or Formula Editor, place the mouse 
over the formula. When the small arrow in a circle appears, click to open the 
contextual menu shown in Figure 14-7.

222
Part III: Counting on Numbers 
 
Figure 14-7: 
Refine cell 
references.
 
For each of the cell references in a formula, you can choose one of four 
options:
 
✓ Relative: This is the default setting. The cell reference is relative to the 
cell in which the formula is located. This is how the formula for cell Q1 
Total Current Assets can be pasted or filled into Q2 Total Current Assets 
and still work.
 
✓ Absolute: By preceding the row and column indicators with a dollar 
sign, the reference is to that cell at all times. If you copy the formula to 
another cell, the reference to cell B10 or Q1 Total Current Assets always 
references that cell. The format you can choose is $B$10 or $Q1 $Total 
Current Assets.
 
✓ Absolute row: The reference for the cell is always in the chosen row, but 
the column reference varies depending on the formula cell.
 
✓ Absolute column: The reference for the cell is always in the chosen 
column, but the row reference varies depending on the formula cell.
 
If you’re creating a what-if formula in which each row (or column) of data 
represents a different assumption, you might want to use absolute references 
for the items that don’t change. You can also use unchanging values with 
absolute references for sales tax rates and the like.

223
 Chapter 14: Using Formulas and Functions
Creating a multisheet and 
multitable summary
As is the case with all financial statements that follow Generally Accepted 
Accounting Principles (GAAP), the financial statement has three distinct 
sections:
 
✓ Balance Sheet: This summarizes assets and liabilities. A Balance Sheet 
contains separate tables for assets and liabilities.
 
✓ Income Statement: This statement combines income and expenses.
 
✓ Cash Flow: This shows the amount of money coming in and going out.
Each of these statements provides a different view on the operation of a 
business and each has its own summaries. It can be convenient to have a 
single overall summary of the summaries such as the one shown in Figure 14-8.
In this case, the summary simply brings together information from several 
sheets and tables; that information has itself been summarized, so we need to 
collect only the sums. Here’s how to do it:
 
1. Begin by creating a new sheet and table for the summary.
 
 Click the Tables button on the toolbar and select the Headers built-in 
table. Name both the sheet and the table Summary.
 
2. Set the header columns to the years you want to track.
 
 Copy and paste (or type) the names of the rows you want to collect, 
such as Total Assets.
 
Figure 14-8:

3. Start to create a formula by typing = in a cell.
 
 Format Editor opens, as shown in Figure 14-9.
 
Figure 14-9: 
Begin the 
formula.
 
 
4. Navigate to the cell you want to reference (in this case Q1 Total Assets 
in the Assets table).
 
 As you move to other sheets and tables using the Sheets pane, notice 
that Formula Editor stays in place. The sheets and tables appear to 
move beneath it. You can drag Formula Editor to a new location if you 
want to.
 
 Also at this time, the cursor changes to a function cursor, as shown in 
Figure 14-10.
 
5. Click the cell you want.
 
6. Click the check mark to accept the summary.
 
 Formula Editor closes and you return to the table where you started 
entering the formula. Repeat with any other cells you want to place on 
your one-page summary.

Using the format bar with formulas
If you show the format bar, you can use it as you’re building a formula. When 
you start to edit a formula, the format bar changes, as shown in Figure 14-11. 
You have Cancel and Accept buttons, you can change the font size, and the 
buttons on the right insert a line break or a tab in the formula. At the left, you 
can click to open Function Browser.

Part III: Counting on Numbers 
Using Formula List
You can show Formula List by clicking the View menu on the toolbar or by 
choosing View➪Show/Hide Formula List. When Formula List is displayed, it 
appears at the bottom of each sheet, as shown in Figure 14-12.
 
Figure 14-12: 
Formula 
List lets you 
manage 
your 
formulas.
 
Formula List shows your sheets and tables; each sheet and table can be col-
lapsed or expanded with the disclosure triangle next to its name. If you click 
a formula, you immediately go to the cell in which it is defined.
The Find & Replace button opens a dialog that lets you search for parts of 
formulas, such as a cell reference name, an operator, or a function. You 
can replace them if you want (for example, replace all references to 2010 
with 2011). If you rename a header row or column, you don’t have to worry: 
Numbers propagates the change appropriately. But if you want a wholesale 
replacement in various formulas, Find & Replace will do the trick.
Working with Functions
Numbers has 250 built-in functions, and you can even create your own func-
tions. Click Function on the toolbar to open a menu from which you can 
select the most common functions — SUM, AVERAGE, MAXIMUM, MINIMUM, 
COUNT, and PRODUCT (the multiplied results of the items in the formula). 
You use the same menu to open Formula Editor in the selected cell and to 
open Function Browser.

227
 Chapter 14: Using Formulas and Functions
Function Browser has the full list of Numbers functions. (The Function menu 
on the toolbar contains only the most common functions, but it also lets you 
open Function Browser.)
The vast majority of Numbers functions are common to most spreadsheets 
and, in fact, to many other applications. Most of these functions were around 
long before we even had computers. You’ll probably use a small set of these 
functions, and that set will depend on the kind of work that you do.
The functions are divided into categories. You can open Function Browser, 
shown in Figure 14-13, in any of these ways:
 
✓ Choose View➪Show Function Browser.
 
✓ Click Function on the toolbar, and choose Show Function Browser.
 
✓ If you’re editing a formula and the format bar is displayed, during the 
edit the format bar will change, as shown in Figure 14-11. Click the fx 
button at the left to show or hide Function Browser.
At the left are the categories of functions. Selecting a category shows the 
functions within it at the right. At the top of the left pane you can choose to 
see all functions or just the ones you’ve used recently. Functions in the right 
pane are always displayed alphabetically.

of each

The format for these descriptions is always the same:
 
✓ Function name.
 
✓ Brief description.
 
✓ Syntax: This shows you how the function should be used. The name of 
the function is shown in dark gray. It is followed with parentheses that 
contain the parameters, or arguments, of the function. All functions have 
parentheses following the function name. The arguments must be in 
the same order in which they are shown in Function Browser. Some 
functions — such as TODAY() — do not have arguments.
 
 Each argument is described. If an argument is optional, it is identified as 
such in its description and appears at the end of the list of arguments.
 
 Arguments can be cell references or constants. Sometimes constants 
are numeric or text values with their own values (such as the number of 
months in a loan). Other times, the constants are specific instructions 
to the function about how it should operate. These arguments typically 
have values such as TRUE, FALSE, 1 (true), or 0 (false).

229
 Chapter 14: Using Formulas and Functions
 
✓ Usage Notes: Sometimes there will be usage notes with suggestions and 
comments about how to use the function.
 
✓ Example: Finally, you see an annotated example of the use of the function.
You can use the Insert Function button at the lower right of Function Browser 
to insert the function in the current formula. The function is inserted with 
the placeholder arguments shown in the syntax section. If you don’t replace 
them or if you make another mistake in the function, you see a red triangle 
and an error message, as shown in Figure 14-15. A yellow triangle is displayed 
for a warning. In either case, the formula containing the function is invalid, 
but in both cases, you can still save the Numbers document so that you can 
come back later and correct the problem.
Function Browser uses styled text with colors, italics, and various font sizes. 
None of this matters in the use of the function in your formula. Function 
names are often shown in CAPITAL LETTERS as they are in this book.

Using Lookup Functions
Formulas and functions are not just about numbers. Some of the most 
impressive uses of formulas and functions have nothing at all to do with num-
bers. In this section we look at an example of the VLOOKUP function that is 
taken from the Grade Book template in the Education section.

230
Part III: Counting on Numbers 
 
Although this is an example from a Grade Book, the basic principle here — 
looking up data from another table based on a value the user has typed in — 
applies to many applications.
As shown in Figure 14-16, the first sheet is Student Data. It contains raw grade 
scores as well as grades that are scaled using a curve. Everything in this 
sheet is data.
 
Figure 14-16: 
Student 
Data 
contains the 
data.
 
A separate sheet, shown in Figure 14-17, contains reports. This division 
between data in one sheet and reports in another means you can change the 
reports and the way in which data is displayed without any fear of corrupting 
the data.
As the comment in Figure 14-17 suggests, you can type a student’s name into 
cell A3 and Numbers will retrieve that student’s data. Try it with the Grade 
Book example and you’ll see how it works. What happens here is created 
with the VLOOKUP function.
When you type a student’s name in cell A3, data from Student Grades is 
shown in cells B3 through H3 of the Student Lookup table in the Reports 
sheet. The chart, Student Grades, is created from the data in Student Lookup. 
That means if the data in Student Lookup changes — for example, if you type 
another student’s name, that student’s data is placed in Student Lookup — 
the chart is automatically redrawn with the new student’s data.

231
 Chapter 14: Using Formulas and Functions
 
Figure 14-17: 
Reports are 
separated 
from the 
sheet that 
contains the 
raw data.
 
This mechanism works as long as cells B3 through H3 in Student Lookup 
are picked up from Student Grades. So, all you need is a formula to take the 
student name typed into cell A3 and retrieve the corresponding data from 
Student Grades.
The VLOOKUP function is the answer. It searches a range of cells for a match-
ing value and then retrieves specific data in the row or column of that match-
ing data. Here is the function as described in Function Browser:
VLOOKUP͒(search-for, columns-range,
          return-column, close-match)
The formula for cell B3, which contains the Assignment 1 grade, is
=VLOOKUP($A3,Student Grades :: $A$1:$H$20,COLUMN(),FALSE)
This function uses four arguments:
 
✓ search-for: This is what should be searched for. In this case, it’s the 
value the user types into cell A3.
 
✓ columns-range: This is where VLOOKUP will look for the search-for 
value. In this case, it’s the Student Grades table and the range of col-
umns from A1 to H20. Refer to Figure 14-16, and you’ll see that the range 
A1 through H20 is the entire Student Grades table.

232
Part III: Counting on Numbers 
 
✓ return-column: This argument tells Numbers which column from the 
selected row will be returned. In the example, the return-column argu-
ment itself is a function call: COLUMN(). COLUMN() returns the column 
number of the current column, that is, the column in Student Lookup. 
Because the columns in Student Lookup and Student Grades are identi-
cal, the formula in column 2 of Student Lookup will return the value of 
column 2 of Student Grades that matches the value of column 1 — the 
student name that has been typed into Student Lookup. For a mecha-
nism like this to work, the columns must match.
 
✓ close-match: This argument takes a constant value that controls 
whether close matches are acceptable. If the value of close-match is 
TRUE (1) or if it is omitted, Numbers finds the row with the largest value 
that is less than search-for. For exact matches, you use FALSE (0) for 
this argument.
If you explore the cells in Student Lookup, you see that each cell from B3 to 
H3 has the same formula. Each includes the COLUMN() function, and each 
formula picks up the right data. Because you want each formula to search 
the entire Student Grades table, the rows and columns in Student Grades 
($A$1:$H$20) are given absolute addresses. In that way, the entire table is 
always searched.
Because the entire table is always searched for a value that matches A3, you 
can type Class Average for the student name and retrieve the class average. 
If you do so, you’ll have Class Average with identical data in the two rows of 
Student Lookup.
Now it’s time to explain why the address for the first argument to VLOOKUP 
is column-absolute. It is always column A. If you add another row to the 
bottom of Student Lookup, you can copy the data from row 3 to row 4 and 
everything will work perfectly. The formula will still search the entire Student 
Grades table, and it will still use COLUMN() to select the column value based 
on the column in Student Lookup. And if you do copy row 3 to row 4, you’ll 
see that the first argument to VLOOKP in row 4 is now $A4. That’s because 
the column is absolute, and when you copied and pasted row 3’s data into 
row 4, A stayed the same, but the row number changed.
 
The chart will still display data only from the first two rows.

In This Chapter

▶ Using Chart inspector
▶ Choosing chart types
S
ome people have no problem looking at a table of numbers that fills an 
entire page and seeing the patterns right away. For other people, a chart 
can clarify your data, making it much easier to understand. If you are prepar-
ing information for several people to understand, you probably need to pres-
ent both the raw data and a visual representation in a chart.
The same rules that apply to numeric data apply to visual data: Be clear and 
don’t mislead.
For many people, using charts is a matter of trial and error. You usually start 
with the data, and then you prepare the chart and try it out on a test subject 
(yourself, to begin with). Does it clarify things? Does it help you understand? 
Numbers is a great tool to use for this experimentation because it makes it 
easy to both create charts and change their attributes.
 
You can create charts in Keynote and Pages. Those charts are almost as pow-
erful as Numbers charts and they look very much the same. Numbers charts 
can be pasted into Keynote and Pages documents, and they retain their rela-
tionship to your Numbers document where possible, unless you choose to 
unlink them. You see how to do this later in this chapter.
Creating a Chart
You create a chart in Numbers in two basic ways:

234
Part III: Counting on Numbers 
 
✓ Start from the chart: Create a chart. Numbers automatically creates an 
associated table with sample data in it. You can then modify, paste, or 
retype that data so that it flows into the chart.
 
✓ Start from the data table: Create a table that contains the data for your 
chart. Select the table or specific cells from that table, and then create a 
chart.
Every chart must have a table associated with it, whether it is a Numbers 
placeholder table or one that you have created.
Describing a chart
All spreadsheet tables serve as the basis for charts. Figure 15-1 shows a basic 
table. This table has row and column headers. The column headers are 2007, 
2008, 2009, and 2010. The row headers are Region 1 and Region 2.
 
Figure 15-1: 
Use a table 
as the basis 
for a chart.
 
Each type of chart has its own way of representing data, but the basic parts 
of a chart remain the same regardless of the chart type. Each value on a chart 
has three components:
 
✓ Value: This is the numeric value, such as a number of people, a tempera-
ture, or miles per gallon. Numeric values are usually plotted against the 
y-axis of a chart (the vertical line at the left). By convention, numeric 
values increase as you go up the y-axis. The selected cell in Figure 15-1 
has a value of 43.

235
 Chapter 15: Working with Charts
 
✓ Category: Each value is associated with a category. A category can be a 
date, a location, or any other attribute that applies to all values. Charts 
let you easily compare values for one category against another — for exam-
ple, the temperature at one location with the temperature at another 
location. Categories can be text (such as place names) or numeric (such 
as dates, times, or altitudes). Categories are usually placed along the 
x-axis of a chart (the horizontal bottom line of the chart). If they are 
numeric (including dates and times), they are usually plotted so that 
they increase as you go to the right along the x-axis. The selected cell in 
Figure 15-1 is in category 2008.
 
✓ Data series: Each value is also associated with a data series. Like a cat-
egory, a data series can be a piece of data, a region, or any other attri-
bute that applies to all its values. You can compare values for one data 
series against another — for example, the temperature on one day with 
the temperature on another day. The selected cell in Figure 15-1 is part 
of data series Region 2.
 
Numbers makes it easy for you to switch a chart’s orientation. In the scenario 
described here, the categories are years and the data series are temperatures. 
As you will see in the following section, you can click a button to change the 
categories to temperatures and the data series to years. Depending on your 
purpose and the data you’re dealing with, one format rather than another will 
often make more sense.
Creating a chart from scratch
Follow these steps when you want to create a chart starting from a Numbers 
document:
 
1. Create the Numbers document for the chart and its data.
 
 Alternatively, open an existing Numbers document and select the sheet 
you want to use for the chart.
 
2. Delete the table from Sheet 1.
 
 A new Numbers document has a single sheet and a single table. Most 
of the time, you work inside a Numbers document that may have other 
tables or sheets in it, but by deleting any existing table, you can isolate 
the charting process to make it easier to see.
 
3. Click Charts on the toolbar, and select a chart to create.
 
 In this example, I chose a line chart. Numbers automatically creates the 
chart and an associated table, as shown in Figure 15-2. You can modify 
the table as you would any other table. Experiment with changing values 
and watch the chart change.

236
Part III: Counting on Numbers 
 
Figure 15-2: 
Choose a 
chart type to 
create the 
chart and its 
table.
 
 
4. Change the chart’s series orientation.
 
 Select the chart by clicking it. The table now has a dark frame, as shown 
in Figure 15-3. At the upper left, you can click the icon to change the 
chart’s data series; in other words, the chart uses the table’s rows 
instead of the table’s columns as categories.
 
 When you change a chart’s series orientation, you switch the categories 
with the data series. The values, which are plotted against the y-axis 
(the vertical axis at the left), are the same, but their representation (the 
color of their line, their dots, or their bars) changes.
Creating a chart from a table
Many times you create a chart from an existing table. It can be an entire table 
or part of a table. Figure 15-4 shows a table that lists reservations for a the-
ater. Each cell in the table contains the number of reservations for a specific 
performance on a specific day. Many of the cells are empty: Not every type of 
performance is presented on every day.

Figure 15-4:

238
Part III: Counting on Numbers 
Here’s how to turn the table shown in Figure 15-4 into a chart:
 
1. Select the table, as shown in Figure 15-4.
 
 Make certain that you select the table and not an individual cell. If you 
select a single cell by just clicking in the table, you’ll chart that cell: a 
single value.
 
2. Click Charts on the toolbar, and then choose a chart to create.
 
 In this example, I chose a stacked horizontal bar chart. Numbers auto-
matically creates the chart, as shown in Figure 15-5.
 
Figure 15-5: 
Numbers 
creates the 
chart from 
the table.
 
 
3. Change the chart’s series orientation.
 
 Just as when you create a chart first and let Numbers create the associ-
ated table, you can change the chart’s series orientation. Just click the 
Data Series button, and you get the result shown in Figure 15-6.

239
 Chapter 15: Working with Charts
Creating a chart from part of a table
Both Figures 15-5 and 15-6 have space for the many empty table cells. You 
can remove these cells and clean up the chart in several ways. The simplest 
method in this case is to create a new chart based on part of the table — the 
cells that have data values in them.
 
Figure 15-6: 
Change 
the chart’s 
series 
orientation.
 
Begin by selecting the chart and deleting it. Now, select the cells from 
Wednesday to Saturday for matinees and evening performances. There are 
still some blank cells (there are matinees only on Wednesday and Saturday), 
but far fewer. With those cells selected, create a new chart by clicking Charts 
on the toolbar and choosing the same stacked horizontal bar chart. You will 
create the chart shown in Figure 15-7.
When you click in the chart, you’ll see the dark frame around only the 
selected cells in the table. You’ll also see that the data series button selects 
the rows as data series by default.
You can use the data series button to switch so that the rows (types of per-
formances) are the data series, as shown in Figure 15-8.

241
 Chapter 15: Working with Charts
Modifying a chart’s data
The chart looks much the same as the one created when the entire table was 
selected (refer to Figure 15-6), but there is a subtle difference. The legend 
at the bottom that matches the categories (Student Matinee, Matinee, and 
Evening) to specific colors has colors and blank names for the blank catego-
ries in the seven empty rows in the table. Unless you’re planning to add more 
data in those categories, there’s no reason to have the blank categories for 
the empty rows in the chart.
To change the data in the table that is included in the chart, first select the 
chart. This highlights the table with the dark frame around the selected cells. 
As shown in Figure 15-9, drag the corner of the frame (in this case the lower 
right) up or down or to the left or right until the correct cells are shown. In 
this case, as you drag the bottom up you remove the blank category rows. 
You’ll see the chart legend change as the unneeded category boxes are 
removed.
You can also add or delete individual cells from the selected cells by 
Ô-clicking cells to add or remove them. Use Shift-click to add or remove cells 
that are immediately adjacent to the selected cells.
 
Figure 15-9: 
Change 
the data 
included in 
the chart.
 

242
Part III: Counting on Numbers 
Moving charts and tables
Whether you start from a chart or start from a table, you’ll wind up with the 
chart and table next to one another on a single sheet. Once both are created 
and Numbers has created the link between them, you can move either one 
or both to other sheets — the connections remain. Just copy and paste the 
tables or charts to the sheets where you want them to be.
Evaluating your charts
You’ll probably go through a process like the steps in this section as you 
develop your charts. Sometimes you know exactly what the data series orien-
tation should be, but other times you’ll experiment with the orientation and 
different types of charts. For example, compare the charts in Figures 15-7 and 
15-8. What do they tell you?
In Figure 15-7, it’s clear that each bar shows the total attendance for each 
day. That’s a simple idea, and it’s probably what you want to see. The 
stacked bars show how that attendance is divided between types of perfor-
mances. In Figure 15-8, you can clearly see the total attendance by perfor-
mance type; different colors distinguish between the days of the week. Both 
charts show the same data, but if you’re a theater manager, you probably 
want the chart in Figure 15-7.
The fact that Numbers makes it easy to experiment helps to make your chart-
making work faster and more productive.
Using Chart Inspector
You can change the chart type and many other attributes of a chart using 
Chart inspector in the Inspector window. Select Chart inspector by clicking 
the Chart button at the top of an Inspector window. Click to select the chart 
to inspect and adjust.
 
You can customize a chart just as you want with the Chart inspector, but for 
many people and many charts, you don’t need to ever use Chart inspector. 
The default settings are often just fine. (Numbers even matches the colors to 
your template’s colors.) You may find that just experimenting with switching 
the data series orientation is sufficient customization.

243
 Chapter 15: Working with Charts
Changing chart types
To change a chart’s type, you can always delete the chart and create a new 
one. But it’s much easier to use Chart inspector. Select the chart you want to 
change and use the menu at the upper left of Chart inspector to open the same 
menu of chart types you see in Charts on the toolbar or choose Insert➪Charts. 
Figure 15-10 shows Chart inspector with the chart types menu.
 
Figure 15-10: 
Change the 
chart type.
 
Together with changing the data series orientation, changing the chart type 
gives you the widest range of major changes. As you change the chart type, 
notice that the size and shape of the chart can change so you may have to 
rearrange on your sheet objects such as graphics, titles, tables, and even 
other charts.
Changing chart colors
The Chart Colors button at the top of Chart inspector opens the window 
shown in Figure 15-11.

Change 
chart colors.
 
Select the set of colors you want to use for your chart. Drag each color to 
the color on the chart you’re replacing. You see a small color swatch and a 
plus sign on the pointer as you move the new color into place. That color will 
replace the previous color everywhere it’s used on the chart.
Formatting chart titles, legends, 
and bar formats
The Chart tab in Chart inspector lets you show or hide legends, titles, and 
hidden data. The legend, which identifies categories by name and color, is 
shown at the bottom of the chart.
The chart title, if it is shown, appears above the chart. To change it, simply 
double-click and type a new name.

245
 Chapter 15: Working with Charts
If your table has hidden data, you can control whether or not it is shown 
in the chart. You probably will choose not to show it; if it’s hidden in the 
table, it usually should be hidden in the chart. Be careful about hiding data. 
If you’re hiding it for reasons of confidentiality, it may make sense to hide 
identifiable data in the table and chart. If you’re hiding data because it’s dis-
tracting and the chart is clearer without it, make certain that you’re not mis-
leading the viewer.
Finally, in bar charts you can adjust the width of individual bars as well as 
the space between sets of bars, as shown in Figure 15-12. A stacked bar chart 
stacks all the bars for a given category on top of one another, with no space 
between sets of bars.

and bars.
 
The category legend names and color codes are in their own section. You can 
move it and adjust its width (and therefore its height) as shown in Figure 15-13.

Setting axes, labels, ticks, and grids
You use the Axis tab in Chart inspector to control axes, labels, ticks, and 
grids. There are separate settings for the x- and y-axes, and they can depend 
on the chart type.
In Figure 15-14, you can see the settings for the y-axis. These are the default 
settings for a stacked bar chart. Notice that the axis pop-up menu is where 
you set ticks and grids — the marks on the axes that provide a scaled refer-
ence for numbers and categories of an axis.
You can choose the maximum and minimum values for the y-axis, as shown 
in Figure 15-15. If you don’t choose your own values, Numbers will choose 
appropriate settings.

248
Part III: Counting on Numbers 
 
If you’re preparing charts that will be compared to one another, you usually 
want to set the same minimum and maximum values for the y-axis for like 
data. In other words, if you have several charts that are plotting grades, they 
might all be scaled from 0 to 100. A separate set of charts plotting audience 
attendance in the 400-seat theater might all be scaled 0 to 410 (to allow for 
standing room). If you present like information with different scales, the result 
is misleading. This is a common mistake in preparing charts. Unfortunately, it 
is also a deliberate step that some unscrupulous chart designers take.
At the bottom of the Axis tab of Chart inspector, you can set the intervals 
between category names. In Figure 15-14, labels are shown for every cat-
egory. In Figure 15-15, labels are shown for every third category, and the 
bottom of the chart is much cleaner. This works very well when the cat-
egories have some obvious sequence. Most people can guess that the two 
categories between Tuesday and Friday are Wednesday and Thursday. On 
the other hand, if your categories are Plumbing, Haberdashery, Gifts, and 
Accounting, showing the labels for only Plumbing and Accounting won’t give 
people a clue as to what those other two categories are.
Adjusting series in Chart inspector
The Series tab in Chart inspector lets you adjust and inspect the data series 
in your chart. Select a series in the chart (not the chart itself). You do that 
by clicking any of the bars or data points in the series. In Figure 15-16, you 
can see that the Matinee series is selected: Round dots appear at the top and 
bottom of each bar that applies to that series. In addition, the corresponding 
row in the table is highlighted.
You can also see that a data series is a formula. You can edit it just as you 
would any other formula. In addition to the data series data, the labels are 
also taken from a range in the table; you can change this range as well so that 
the labels will change.
Perhaps most important, you can change the order of each data series. You 
don’t have to rearrange the data in your tables to put one series on top of 
another in your stacked bar chart. Just as with the minimum and maximum 
values on the y-axis, keeping your data series in the same order across sev-
eral charts can make it easier for people to compare one chart with another.
You can turn value labels on and off as well as change their location and for-
matting, as shown in Figure 15-17.
The chart in Figure 15-17 is a stacked bar chart, so the final label position 
option (placing it above the bar) is not available. If you choose to place the 
value labels in a specific position, remember that the chart will usually look 
best if you use the same position for all data series.

Formatting and Printing 
Numbers Documents
In This Chapter
▶ Displaying charts and tables effectively on paper
▶ Reorganizing, sorting, and categorizing data
▶ Searching for data values
E
ach iWork app has its own settings for its documents and their major 
subdivisions (sections for Pages documents, slides for Keynote docu-
ments, and sheets for Numbers documents). For Keynote presentations and 
Pages documents, the size of the canvas you’re working with is set for the 
document. In the case of Numbers documents, each sheet can have a differ-
ent size; it’s only when it comes time to print a sheet that you need to worry 
about its actual size. That’s one of the reasons why the procedures for for-
matting and printing Numbers documents are somewhat different from the 
procedures for formatting and printing other iWork documents.
Formatting Multiple Charts 
on a Single Sheet
Creating multiple tables and charts on multiple sheets in Nunbers so that you 
can track data is simple. Figure 16-1 shows a multiple-sheet solution (it’s one 
used previously in Chapter 15).
Keeping each sheet focused on one set of data (a single week in this case), 
makes it easy to manage just the information you care about.
But you can also create a new sheet to provide a summary so that you can 
see all the data together. This section shows you how to combine the tables 
and charts and how to reorganize and reformat them so that they look their 
best.

252
Part III: Counting on Numbers 
 
Figure 16-1: 
Create 
multi ple 
sheets, 
each with 
its own 
tables and 
charts.
 
 
The sequence of steps depends on your charts and tables as well as your pref-
erences. As you are rearranging and reformatting your own tables and charts, 
you may notice something that appears wrong to you. Feel free to jump ahead 
(or back) in this chapter to fix that issue.
Formatting charts on a single sheet
Here’s how you make charts placed together on a single sheet look as good 
as possible:
 
1. Create a new sheet and name it Summary.
 
 Click Sheet on the toolbar and double-click to rename it in the Sheets 
pane.
 
2. Copy and paste each chart from its own sheet into the Summary sheet.
 
 Don’t worry what the sheet looks like as you proceed — you’ll clean it 
up in this section.
 
 Be careful that you copy only the charts (not the accompanying tables). 
Do this by clicking once in the center of each chart so that the chart’s 
eight handles are visible. Then copy and paste each chart to the 
Summary sheet. In this way, the chart on the Summary page and the 
chart on the original sheet page will both reference the same table.

253
 Chapter 16: Formatting and Printing Numbers Documents
 
3. Rearrange the charts so that they look the way you want them to look.
 
 As you move the charts, guide lines appear, as shown in Figure 16-2. In 
this case, the charts are aligned on their horizontal centers. Experiment 
with different types of alignment; this will help you uncover errors. 
For example, if you place the charts next to one another, you’ll see a 
mistake.
 
Figure 16-2: 
Create a 
single sum-
mary sheet 
with all the 
charts.
 
 
4. Check the axes to make certain they are consistent.
 
 In Figure 16-2, the y-axis goes from 0 to 700 in the Week 1 chart; in the 
Week 2 chart it goes from 0 to 800. Two charts displaying the same type 
of data that are placed next to one another should have the same values 
on their axes. If you take out a ruler and measure the height of bars with 
similar values, you’ll see that they are different heights. This becomes 
increasingly apparent if you place them next to one another.
 
5. Change the axis minimum or maximum value to make them consistent.
 
 Usually, you want the values from the larger range of values. Use Chart 
inspector to change the values of the y-axis, as shown in Figure 16-3.

254
Part III: Counting on Numbers 
 
Figure 16-3: 
Adjust the 
axes scales.
 
Print charts on a single sheet
Now that you have your charts looking good on the screen, it’s time to make 
them look good when they’re printed. Here’s how:
 
1. Switch to Print view to see how your sheet will look when it’s printed.
 
 Use any of these commands:
 
• Choose View➪Show Print View.
 
• Click View on the toolbar and choose Show Print View.
 
• At the bottom of the window, choose Show Print View (see 
Figure 16-4).
 
 When Print view is displayed, the Sheets pane shows the number of 
pages it will take to print that sheet, as shown in Figure 16-4.
 
2. Scroll to make certain that the page breaks are appropriate.
 
 In this case, a page break toward the right side of the Week 2 chart looks 
terrible.

255
 Chapter 16: Formatting and Printing Numbers Documents
 
Figure 16-4: 
Show Print 
view.
 
 
3. If necessary, fix the page breaks.
 
 Here’s where judgment comes in. You have a variety of options:
 
• Rearrange the sheet so that one table or chart appears on each 
page. This approach, however, is usually overkill.
 
• Use the Content Scale slider in the center of the bottom of the 
window to change the size of the sheet’s content. If almost every-
thing fits on a single page, this may work for you. If you reduce the 
content size, though, print it to check it for readability before dis-
tributing the chart.
 
• Use the controls in the bottom of the window to switch between 
portrait (vertical) and landscape (horizontal) orientations.
 
• Manually adjust the content. Instead of scaling all the content, 
make informed judgments about specific rescaling choices. For 
instance, in this case, you might want to reduce the size of the 
charts while leaving the legends the same size.
Sorting and Reorganizing Data
Like other spreadsheets, Numbers can sort and reorganize data quickly. As 
you think about how to print data, you may want to consider not just the 

256
Part III: Counting on Numbers 
layout but also the way in which the data is organized and selected. This sec-
tion provides an example of how to do that. Both sorting and reorganizing 
data help people focus on the points you’re trying to make.
Many of the examples in this book and the Numbers documentation focus on 
small problems because it is usually easier to see the basic principles. But 
the example in this section is chosen to show you the power of Numbers. The 
data used here is from the United Status 2000 census. The complete data file 
is a quarter of a million records; several thousand are enough to demonstrate 
Numbers in action. You’ll see how to display the data, format it, and create 
subtotals by category.
Sorting data with the Reorganize dialog
First I describe how to sort data using iWork’s Reorganize dialog:
 
1. Download the censususa data file as described in the Introduction.
 
 Open the file in Numbers.
 
2. Use Table inspector to set headers for each column.
 
 Type names for each header (Age, Count, Sex, and State). The spread-
sheet should appear as shown in Figure 16-5.
 
Figure 16-5: 
Open the 
census file 
in Numbers 
and set 
headers 
for the 
columns.
 

257
 Chapter 16: Formatting and Printing Numbers Documents
 
3. Select the entire table and click Reorganize on the toolbar to open the 
Reorganize dialog, as shown in Figure 16-6.
 
 Sort the table based on ascending age as shown in Figure 16-6. Note 
how quickly the sort is performed: Numbers is fast. Also note that by 
supplying header values for the columns, you’ve made it easier to use 
the Reorganize dialog. There’s no question that you’re sorting by age 
because that’s the name of that column.
 
Figure 16-6: 
Sort the 
table 
by age.
 
Using data categories
Numbers makes it easy to categorize data. Just follow these steps to catego-
rize the census data by state and age:
 
1. Download the censususa data file as described in the Introduction.
 
2. Use Table inspector to set headers for each column.
 
 You also may want to use Cell inspector to format the data values as 
numbers with thousands delimiters.

258
Part III: Counting on Numbers 
 
3. Select the entire table and click Reorganize on the toolbar to open the 
Reorganize dialog. Select the State category, as shown in Figure 16-7.
 
 (Use the Insert Categories From the Following check box to turn catego-
ries on and off.) You can collapse or expand any category by using its 
disclosure triangle.
 
Figure 16-7: 
Use 
categories.
 
 
4. Use the plus sign at the right to add a category to the Reorganize 
dialog.
 
 Add the Age category below the State category. The display changes as 
shown in Figure 16-8.
 
5. Clean up the display.
 
 You can hide the columns for State and Age — they are shown as cat-
egories. The table that results is shown in Figure 16-9.
 
6. Add a summary function for the categories.
 
 Click any summary cell (such as a state) and use the disclosure tri-
angle that appears at the right to open the menu shown in Figure 16-10. 
Choose a summary function for that category and the column you’ve 
clicked in. For example, if you click in the Age column and the State cat-
egory, you can create subtotals for all ages and all states as shown in 
Figure 16-11. There’s nothing more to click: Numbers just goes to work.

Subtotals in large tables can take a while to calculate. Some people are 
tempted to go wild with summaries. Consider what it is you’re trying to com-
municate. It may be that separate smaller tables with fewer summary fields (or 
a chart!) can make your point more simply.
Finding data
When you have a small table, you can look at it and understand the data at a 
glance (particularly if you’ve used charts). But when you have a large table 
with hundreds or thousands of cells, you need help to find the data you’re 
looking for.
Here’s how to search a table for data:
 
1. Select the table or part of a table you want to search.
 
2. Select the column you want to search, as shown in Figure 16-12.
 
Figure 16-12: 
Select the 
column to 
search.
 
 
3. Provide the condition you are looking for, as shown in Figure 16-13.
 
 These are the values in the pop-up menu shown in the center of 
Figure 16-12.
 
Figure 16-13: 
Select the 
operator for 
the search.
 

262
Part III: Counting on Numbers 
 
4. Enter the value to search for.
 
 You can click the + sign to add another condition to the search, as 
shown in Figure 16-14.
 
5. Show the data.
 
 When you select the Show Rows That Match the Following check box, 
Numbers performs the search. The search is very fast because Numbers 
has been working on it while you’ve been specifying the search terms.

Part IV
Presenting 
Keynote

In this part . . .
K
eynote started as a project for Steve Jobs, for his 
presentations at MacWorld and Apple’s World Wide 
Developer Conference. Well-known for his attention to 
detail, he didn’t like the existing presentation software. 
When you’re the head of a company like Apple, you can 
address the issue by having software written to your 
specifications.
Over time, Keynote was refined and became the first com-
ponent of iWork. It’s possible to create ugly and boring 
presentations with Keynote, but it’s a lot harder to do so 
than with some other software.
Although Keynote has great graphics and terrific transi-
tions, its strength is that its features are all focused on the 
main purpose of the presentation: presenting and clarify-
ing information rather than drawing attention to gee-whiz 
effects.

Chapter 17

▶ Creating handouts, notes, and outlines
K
eynote was the first component of iWork. It was originally written 
for Steve Jobs to use when he gave presentations at conferences and 
trade shows, including Apple’s World Wide Developers Conference and 
the Macworld conferences. After these “trials by fire,” Keynote and Pages 
became the first two components of iWork.
Word processing programs and page layout programs such as Microsoft 
Word and Pages focus on preparing paper-based documents. They often are 
viewed on a computer display, but generally they are tied to paper. When it 
comes to spreadsheets such as Microsoft Excel and Numbers, there’s a dif-
ferent pattern. Spreadsheets are sometimes printed; other times they are 
designed for interactivity and what-if analyses in which a person uses the 
spreadsheet’s ability to rapidly calculate and recalculate data.
Presentation software is a different type of product. It’s really not paper-
based like word processing or page layout software, and it’s not designed for 
the kind of interactivity provided by a spreadsheet. Presentation software 
uses the capabilities of a graphics-based personal computer to let people 
create effective presentations.
This chapter gets you started with Keynote and its reinvention of presen-
tations for the Mac. It’s a reinvention that takes advantage of the built-in 
features of Mac OS X as well as what people have learned over more than 20 
years of using less powerful tools.

266
Part IV: Presenting Keynote 
Creating Effective Presentations
A lot of confusion and misinformation about presentations exists, creating 
a bad reputation for presentations and presentation software. By looking at 
these issues, however, you can find out how to avoid problems and how to 
make your own Keynote presentations more effective and productive.
Making your presentations effective
Presentations differ from other types of documents in that they are not 
designed for a person to use on their own. A presenter (usually you) controls 
the pace of the presentation. And, what’s more, because presentations are 
usually given in a darkened room, you can’t always tell if you’re losing your 
audience. Here are some tips for avoiding problems in this area:
 
✓ Avoid the dark: Use the least amount of room-darkening you can for 
your presentation. Make certain you can see your audience.
 
✓ Use Q&A sections: Use more (and shorter) Q&A sections in your presen-
tations to involve your audience as much as possible.
 
✓ Use a roadmap: Let people know where you’re going in your presenta-
tion and where they are at any moment. When you’re reading a book, 
the heft of the unread pages gives you an idea of how far you’ve come. 
With a presentation, one slide after another can come out of the dark 
without any clue as to how it fits into the presentation.
 
✓ Time and rehearse your presentation: Fortunately, Keynote has excel-
lent presentation tools so that you can make your presentation as 
efficient as possible. Depending on your topic, your experience with pre-
sentations, and who you are, you may find it more important to work on 
timing or to rehearse your presentation. Some presenters need no more 
than a few minutes’ rehearsal, but many others need hours to come up 
with a 15-minute presentation.
Using documents that move
What you use for a presentation is a sequence of slides displayed on a large 
projection screen or sometimes directly on a computer display if the audi-
ence is small. You have options for movement that you don’t have with a 
printed document. You can add effects to the transition from one slide to 
another along with moving elements including QuickTime movies.

267
 Chapter 17: Getting to Know Keynote
These tools, however, are among the most misused of presentation features. 
In fact, some time ago, one presentation application (not Keynote) even had 
a feature that allowed you to select a different random animated transition 
from one slide to the next. The audience had no idea why one transition was 
used rather than another.
Experiment with the Keynote transitions and use them to help people under-
stand where in the presentation you are. For example, you can use a certain 
type of transition to go from one slide to another slide that provides details 
on the first slide. Yet another transition can be used to introduce a new topic.
Your audience is sitting there in the dark trying to figure out what all this 
means: Give them a helping hand.
Working on a small scale
The last point to remember when working on a presentation is that you’re 
using a very small canvas. Although your slides may be blown up to large 
sizes on a screen, that’s so a roomful of people can see them. Each slide has 
much less space for information than a piece of paper (or a spreadsheet 
page).
Given the relatively small size of your slides, you may decide to break up text 
into multiple slides, such as Strategies (1), Strategies (2), and Strategies (3). 
This is a time-tested way to antagonize your audience. You’re asking them to 
remember too much. For each slide, make its title clear and its subject under-
standable. Instead of Strategies (1), try New Customer Strategies. Instead of 
Strategies (2), try Returning Customer Strategies.
You may think that you have to do more organization for a large document 
than for a 20-slide presentation, but the opposite may be true. In part, that’s 
because with a large printed document, your readers can always flip a few 
pages back or forward if they lose the sequence of what you’ve been writing 
about. With a slide presentation, they have to remember where they are in 
the presentation.
Think about these issues as you explore Keynote. Fortunately, with the built-
in themes, you’ll find plenty of tools. The folks at Apple have used presenta-
tions for years, and they’re very good at them. Keynote isn’t just presentation 
software; like Pages and Numbers, it’s a hands-on training seminar in the nuts 
and bolts of communicating.
Come back to these issues as you work with Keynote. For now, it’s time to 
explore what you have in that little iWork box.

268
Part IV: Presenting Keynote 
Introducing the Keynote Themes
When you launch Keynote or create a new document, you are prompted to 
choose a theme, as shown in Figure 17-1.
 
Figure 17-1: 
Choose a 
theme.
 
Theme Chooser, shown in Figure 17-1, looks very much like Template 
Chooser you’ve used with Pages and Numbers. One immediate difference is 
the pop-up menu in the lower right: You can select the size of your presenta-
tion slides when you select a theme.
Another difference between Theme Chooser and Template Choosers you’ve 
used before is that the themes are not divided into categories such as 
Education or Business.

269
 Chapter 17: Getting to Know Keynote
But the biggest difference between themes and templates is that themes are 
interchangeable. With a template, you normally create a document from the 
template and go on to customize it. You can modify colors and patterns in 
the template, but your document has its own logic and structure. If you want 
to switch to a new template, you can do so by starting a new document, or 
you can modify the existing document.
With a theme (rather than a template), you can switch back and forth from 
one theme to another. You can do this because the structure of the under-
lying document is independent of the theme, so the theme can always be 
replaced.
Just as a Numbers document can contain a number of sheets, each with its 
own tables and charts, and a Pages document can contain a number of pages 
or sections, each with its own formatted elements, a Keynote document con-
sists of a number of slides, each of which has its own formatted elements. 
Unlike Pages and Numbers, the structure of those slides is specific, and you’ll 
see that the slide structures — called slide masters — allow you to switch 
from one theme to another. In addition, these structures help you implement 
the type of roadmaps and structures cited previously as ways to improve 
your presentations.
Slide Masters Provide Consistency 
and Save Time
Each theme has its own slide masters. Having chosen a theme, you can build 
a presentation by adding slide masters in whatever sequence you want. 
Because the slide masters are structured and replaceable, you can always 
switch themes as you go along.
Not every theme supports every slide master structure, but by and large 
you’ll find that most slide master structures are available. For example, 
Figure 17-2 shows the slide masters in the Industrial theme.

270
Part IV: Presenting Keynote 
 
Figure 17-2: 
Slide 
masters 
for the 
Industrial 
theme.
 
Figure 17-3 shows the slide masters for the Typeset theme.
If you enter text or photos on slide masters, you can change the theme of 
your presentation. Do not do so without checking: Sometimes there are slight 
differences in fonts and spacing, so you’ll need to make manual adjustments 
to text on the slide master. In general, if you’ve left a little bit of space around 
a slide master’s text or title, you’ll be safer than if you’ve used every pixel.
The standard suite of slide masters provides the basics for an excellent pre-
sentation. You can create your own slides from blank slide masters, but if 
you use the built-in slide masters, you’ll give your presentation not only a 
consistent look but also a logical structure.

271
 Chapter 17: Getting to Know Keynote
 
Figure 17-3: 
Slide 
masters for 
the Typeset 
theme.
 
This section provides a preview of the slide masters and how you can use 
them most effectively. The slide masters in this section are drawn primarily 
from the Sedona theme, which has several alternate versions of slide masters, 
providing you with extra choices within the basic presentation structure.
As you start to lay out your presentation, there are several logical parts to 
consider: the headline and overview, the section headlines and overviews, 
and the content slides.
Creating your presentation title
Your first slide is usually the Title & Subtitle slide master. For the Sedona 
theme, that slide master is shown in Figure 17-4.

272
Part IV: Presenting Keynote 
 
Figure 17-4: 
Create your 
title slide.
 
As you can see in Figure 17-4, you are prompted to enter the title. Some 
themes use all caps for the title, so if you type lowercase letters, they are 
converted to uppercase automatically. The best idea is to type uppercase 
and lowercase letters as appropriate whether or not they appear that way on 
the slide, because if you change themes later, the capitalization may matter. 
Figure 17-5 shows the completed title slide. For the subtitle, you can use a 
true subtitle or the presenter’s name. You might want to use a course or con-
ference description as well.
Figure 17-6 shows what can happen when you switch themes.
Here are two common complications:
 
✓ Capitalization can matter. Although capitalization didn’t matter in the 
slide shown in Figure 17-4, it does now that the theme is changed to 
Imagine.
 
✓ Spacing can change. Also, the spacing of the title changes with the new 
theme. As shown in Figure 17-6, you can double-click and automatically 
resize the title text to the space available. Figure 17-7 shows the modi-
fied title slide.

When you change themes, you’ll probably have the types of issues described 
here and will need to check spacing for titles and slide text. You’ll quickly 
learn that you can minimize these changes by leaving a bit of extra space.
Structuring your presentation
Providing a roadmap to your presentation is critical. Without it, your audi-
ence won’t know where you are and where you’re going; a lack of a roadmap 
is what gives rise to the common impression of many presentations as just a 
speaker droning on and on. Set up your roadmap and point out its signposts 
as you go along. You don’t have to be fussy about this; just let people know 
what’s coming next.
Keynote sets this structure up for you. Look at the slide masters shown in 
Figures 17-2 and 17-3. Almost every slide master on every theme has space 
for a title. Even a slide that features a photo has space for a title. Your titles 
are the signposts to your roadmap.

275
 Chapter 17: Getting to Know Keynote
A presentation is not a vacation slideshow. That’s a misunderstanding that 
ruins many a presentation. When you’re showing your vacation slides, it’s 
fine to show a photo and say, “Here we are on the Matterhorn.” You can 
even vary your slideshow with questions, “Can you tell where we are in this 
photo?” Most of the time, that doesn’t work for a presentation for work or a 
similar environment. There’s no question that you can create presentations 
of vacation images, but Keynote and its tools aren’t the best choice for that. 
Rather, use iPhoto or iMovie to construct a photo album, a slideshow, or a 
movie. A Keynote presentation with its speaker’s notes, the ability to print 
handouts, and other such features provides much more power and sophisti-
cation than iPhoto or iMovie when it comes to presentations.
Providing bulleted content
Most of your slides will consist of some variation on a title and bullets, per-
haps with an image as shown in Figure 17-8.
 
Figure 17-8: 
Use a title 
and bullets 
with an

276
Part IV: Presenting Keynote 
This is the Title Bullets & Photo slide master from the Sedona theme. Most 
themes have a similar slide master. Bullets are an effective way of structuring 
your presentation. You can create a hierarchical bullet structure that provides 
a sturdy roadmap to your presentation. On the initial bullet list, provide an 
outline of your presentation. Each bullet on that slide then becomes the title 
for a new slide with its own bullets.
If you use this strategy, repeat the overview slide so that you can provide a 
summary of what you’ve talked about. When you use a Keynote bullet slide 
master, look carefully at what Keynote has given you. As shown in Figure 17-8, 
a half dozen bullets fill a slide when there’s an image next to them. If you 
don’t have an image, you’re still usually limited to a half dozen bullets; each 
one can be longer, but using the extra space for more bullets is an invitation 
to clutter and confusion.
Using a Q&A slide
All themes have a blank slide master. You can put anything on these slides. 
A great use of them is to create a discussion or Q&A slide. You can use a bul-
leted slide to launch a discussion, with the bullets as discussion topics. But 
for many purposes, nothing beats a blank side with a simple headline such as 
Q&A or Feedback. Turning the presentation over to your audience involves 
them and gets things moving.
In general, anything you can do to break the formal pattern of a presentation 
will involve your audience more and make the presentation go better.
Creating Handouts, Outlines, and Notes
Take a few moments to explore the Keynote Print dialog. Choose Keynote 
from the pop-up menu in the center of the dialog, and you’ll find a wide range 
of options. You can prepare handouts with up to six slides per page. You can 
add presenter notes to the handouts if you want. You can also print an out-
line that Keynote constructs automatically from slide titles and bullets.
Many people prepare two sets of handouts: one set to be distributed and a 
second set for the speaker (and possibly as a leave-behind for a teacher or 
administrator).

▶ Using the Keynote window
▶ Creating a simple Keynote presentation
L
ike all iWork apps, Keynote has its own window features. The basics of 
the window are the same as for the other apps: a toolbar, a format bar, 
and an Inspector window. But, as in the other apps, each of those compo-
nents has customized features for Keynote.
When you compare Keynote to the other apps, you may be able to see that 
it is the original iWork app: Its interface is the most complex. Partly this 
is because it has evolved over the longest time, but it’s also because pre-
sentations can be much more complex than Pages documents or Numbers 
spreadsheets. When you prepare a presentation well, you bring together the 
information to be presented along with visuals and slides of text. The pre-
sentation can involve notes for yourself as well as a structured sequence of 
slides. By organizing the presentation in this way, you provide the most inter-
esting and useful presentation.
Perhaps you’ve had the experience of sitting through a presentation in which 
the speaker reads every word on every slide: It quickly becomes tedious. 
Organizing your presentation into separate components of visuals, speaker’s 
notes, planned discussion topics, and time for questions can provide a useful 
and interesting presentation for your audience — and for yourself.
This chapter is the overview of the basic Keynote tools that help you create 
and present your Keynote presentations.
Exploring the Keynote Window
Everyone prepares a Keynote presentation differently. There is no one right 
way — not for a specific topic, not for a specific audience, and not for a spe-
cific speaker. The Keynote window is flexible enough to let you work in the 
way that’s easiest for you.

278
Part IV: Presenting Keynote 
The Keynote window has six major areas that you can show or hide. If you 
hide an area, however, the information in that area remains in the presen-
tation. If you hide the presenter notes, for example, that’s all you’ve done: 
hidden them. Want to see them again (perhaps during your presentation)? 
Just display them. You don’t lose anything.
The Keynote window lets you work on a presentation. When it comes time to 
present the presentation, you can use the techniques in Chapter 19.
As with other iWork apps, an area to the left of the window provides quick 
access to the structure of your document. This area, called the Navigator, is 
shown in Figure 18-1.
 
Figure 18-1: 
Use the 
Keynote 
window.
 
The Navigator
The Navigator has two components: master slides and slides. Slides are 
always displayed, but the display of master slides is optional.

279
 Chapter 18: Creating a Keynote Presentation
You create the slides for your presentation using the New button on the tool-
bar or by choosing Slide➪New Slide. As you add information to the slides, 
you can rearrange them by dragging them up or down in the Navigator.
Remember that the structure of a slide is part of Keynote; this means you can 
select a slide and switch its slide master to another format. You may have to 
do some reformatting, but you won’t lose any data.
You can show slide masters using the View menu on the toolbar (or the View 
menu in the menu bar). If you’ve shown them, the appropriate slide master 
appears with a check mark next to it when you select a slide that uses that 
slide master.
Slide outlines
If you choose to show slide outlines, the Keynote view changes as shown in 
Figure 18-2. You can show slides and slide masters together, but neither of 
them can be shown with slide outlines. Compare the slide in the main section 
of the window in Figure 18-2 with the outline shown at the left. The outline is 
generated automatically from the slide’s total text, including bullets.
 
Figure 18-2: 
View slide 
outlines.
 

280
Part IV: Presenting Keynote 
This automatic synchronization between slides and outlines works in both 
directions. For example, in Figure 18-3 a new inner bullet is being typed 
(Basic Sli is all that has been typed so far). As you type in the slide outline 
area, the appropriate text and bullet appear in the main slide.
Bullets in Keynote presentations, like outlines and bullets in Pages docu-
ments, rely on the tab key. To indent some text for an outline or bullet, just 
tab to the indented position. To outdent (that is, move a bullet up), use 
Shift-tab. With bulleted or outlined text selected, use the Bullets tab of Text 
inspector to choose the image for the bullet and to verify the indent level.
 
Figure 18-3: 
Type the 
slide outline 
and auto-
matically 
update the 
slide.
 
When you’re creating slides, sometimes it makes sense to bounce between 
typing in a slide and typing in a slide outline. The outline helps to show you 
the structure of the slide, and that outline sometimes makes gaps and omis-
sions easier to see and quickly repair.
Master slides
Each Keynote theme has its own master slides, and many themes have varia-
tions on some of the master slides (usually marked with Alt for alternate). To 

281
 Chapter 18: Creating a Keynote Presentation
make your Keynote presentation consistent, display the slide masters, and 
then scroll through them, deleting the ones you won’t be using. That way 
you’ll limit your slide masters to a smaller and consistent set.
The light table
If you’re used to arranging slides, you may have used a light table — either an 
actual light table lit from below or one generated by software. In Keynote, you 
can move slides around as shown in Figure 18-4. This is also another way of 
doing a consistency check. As you organize your slides into a logical sequence, 
you’ll quickly be able to see if something about the sequence is distracting 
(perhaps a repeated graphic or too many bulleted slides in a row).
 
Figure 18-4: 
Use a light 
table to 
organize 
your slides.
 
Presenter notes
One of the techniques that skilled presenters use is presenter notes, as 
shown in Figure 18-5. Presenter notes can provide you with reminders of 
questions to ask as well as issues to raise. Don’t bother providing a preview 
of the next slide. In most cases, you can use Keynote’s presenter’s display 
(discussed in the next chapter) so that you can see where you’re going next.

282
Part IV: Presenting Keynote 
 
Figure 18-5: 
Use 
presenter 
notes.
 
If you have good speaker’s notes, your presentation is a combination of the 
slides and your talk. If you rely on your memory, you may find that you’re 
putting everything onto a slide so you don’t forget it; that means you will 
have little to add and will soon bore your audience.
Your speaker’s notes shouldn’t be too long; otherwise you’ll spend too much 
time reading them and not talking to your audience. You can enlarge the 
speaker’s notes pane at the bottom of the window so that there’s more room. 
This is useful as you’re preparing your presentation. When you’re actually 
presenting it, if you use the speaker’s display as described in the next chap-
ter, there’s plenty of room for speaker’s notes alongside the full image of 
each slide.
Comments
Each iWork application allows you to add comments; those for Keynote 
appear much like sticky notes, as shown in Figure 18-6.
Comments are free-format; you can place them anywhere on a slide. The best 
use for them in a Keynote presentation is as a reminder of something still 
to be done to prepare the presentation. Don’t use comments for speaker’s 
notes; they won’t show up with other speaker’s notes on the speaker’s dis-
play and can easily be overlooked.

Creating Your Own Keynote Presentation
You can create a Keynote presentation in many ways, depending on the con-
tent, the audience, and yourself. I give various presentations on a number of 
topics; here’s one technique that I use:
 
1. Identify your subject and audience, and determine the length of your 
presentation.
 
 This last point is critical whether you’re creating a presentation or a 
document. Most projects have a given length: a 50-page document, for 
example, or a 30-minute presentation. This is a presentation for public 
library trustees that I’ve given as a volunteer on a number of occasions 
for the Clinton-Essex-Franklin Library System in upstate New York 
(CEFLS).
 
2. Choose File➪New from Theme Chooser to display Theme Chooser, as 
shown in Figure 18-7.

284

3. Choose a Keynote theme.
 
 You don’t have to worry much about the theme you choose; unlike tem-
plates for Numbers or Pages, you can always switch to another theme as 
you work.
 
4. Use the View menu on the toolbar to show outlines at the left of the 
window, as shown in Figure 18-8.
 
Figure 18-8: 
Show 
outlines.
 

285
 Chapter 18: Creating a Keynote Presentation
 
5. Start to type the outline, as shown in Figure 18-9.
 
 At this point, you may just want to type your main points. You can rear-
range and reword them as you proceed.
 
Figure 18-9: 
Begin the 
outline.
 
 
6. Review each slide by selecting it. Change the slide master if desired.
 
 To change the slide master, select a slide and use the Masters menu on 
the toolbar. Figure 18-10 shows the third slide; it has been properly for-
matted with bullets from the outline, so you don’t need to do anything 
else.
 
7. Check for and correct overflowing text.
 
 The second slide has more content than fits on the slide (see the + box 
in the center of the bottom in Figure 18-11).
 
8. Check the revised slide.
 
 As shown in Figure 18-13, the two-column layout works well to solve the 
spacing issue. In addition, by sheer luck, the two columns have a logic 
to them (libraries on the left, the system on the right). You may have to 
perform manual adjustments with return characters to provide a logical 
two-column structure.

286
Part IV: Presenting Keynote 
 
Figure 18-10: 
Review 
slides.
 
 
Figure 18-11: 
Watch for 
overflowing 
text.
 
 
 You can fix the overflow text by splitting the slide into two. 
Alternatively, choose a new slide master, as shown in Figure 18-12.

287
 Chapter 18: Creating a Keynote Presentation
 
Figure 18-12: 
Choose a 
slide mas-
ter with 
multiple 
columns.
 
Don’t think that this is a text-first process. It starts with the outline but then 
bounces back to the layout of slides. As you check the formatting, you’ll need 
to reformat some slides and split some into two (or more). Remember that 
you’re dealing with a limited amount of space. A book’s section can vary from 
a few pages to 20 or more, but a slide is a slide is a slide.
Many things follow from the standard size of slides. Not the least is the fact 
that you can keep track of your presentation’s length. For a given speaker 
and a given presentation, you can probably use a standard amount of time 
for each slide. Too much time and people get antsy; too little time means 
those slides come quickly one after the other. Everyone uses their own 
techniques. (I plan on five minutes per slide.)

Like any presentation software, Keynote allows you to specify transitions for 
slides. The basic process outlined here uses default transitions. It’s one of 
the fastest ways to get your presentation on its feet so you can try it out for a 
test audience.
In the next chapter you see how to present your work. Then, in Chapter 20, 
you find out about some advanced techniques for slide transitions.

Chapter 19
Presenting a Keynote Presentation
In This Chapter
▶ Using the Presenter Display
▶ Controlling your presentation with your iPhone
U
nlike Numbers spreadsheets and Pages documents, Keynote presenta-
tions aren’t designed to be given to someone to read or study: You’re a 
key component of your Keynote presentation. Sometimes you prepare a pre-
sentation for someone else to use or vice versa. But most of the time, you run 
the show, stage center. Fortunately, Keynote has a host of tools that make 
it easy for you to fulfill the dual roles of presentation author and presenter. 
This chapter gives you an overview of those tools.
Choosing Your Presentation Options
The earliest presentation software tools used the computer monitor to dis-
play slides. Often, a second monitor, frequently a projection TV, was con-
nected. Keynote lets you select your primary display (usually the projection 
TV) and configure the other one with timers and presenter’s notes.
With the advent of iWork ’09, you have another way of working with Keynote — 
at least if you have an iPhone. You can download Keynote Remote, an app for 
iPhone and iPod Touch. It’s available from the App Store in iTunes and currently 
costs $0.99. You can use the iPhone or iPod Touch, both of which communicate 
wirelessly with the computer running Keynote, to control the slides. Another 
wrinkle in this scenario is that speaker’s notes can be visible along with the slide 
on your iPhone or iPod Touch. This means you have two displays for presenter’s 
notes and other non-slide information: the presenter’s display on a computer as 
well as your iPhone or iPod Touch. You see how to use all these features.

290
Part IV: Presenting Keynote 
Setting Presentation Preferences
You can set preferences for how Keynote handles multiple displays, for how 
the slideshow will be managed, for the presenter’s display (if you have mul-
tiple displays), and for using a remote (if you have one). In most cases, the 
default preferences for iWork apps are fine. However, when it comes to cus-
tomizing your environment — particularly if you’re using multiple displays — 
you need to pay attention to these settings.
Setting preferences for two displays
Laptops and iMacs have built-in displays; desktop Macs do not. All Macs have 
a plug for another display in addition to the built-in display or the main display 
for a desktop Mac. You use System Preferences➪Displays to manage the dis-
plays on your computer. Three basic display configurations are available:
 
✓ Single display: You have a single display, built-in or not. All windows 
you open with any program on your Mac are shown on this display. You 
can move them around, but you can’t totally move a window off a single 
display. (You can minimize it in the dock, but it remains part of the main 
window.)
 
✓ Mirrored display: This configuration allows you to have two dis-
plays connected to your computer. In the Displays section of System 
Preferences, use the Mirror Displays check box to ensure that the same 
image appears on both displays. When it comes to presentations, many 
times the second display for a computer is a projection TV. By mirroring 
the displays, you can work with the computer’s display as you normally 
would, and the mirrored display (the projection TV) displays that image 
in an enlarged version.
 
✓ Separate displays: The Displays section of System Preferences shows all 
screens attached to your computer (some people have more than two!). 
Only one of them shows a menu bar at the top of the screen. Drag that 
iPhone/iPod Touch
Most apps that run on iPhone also run on iPod 
Touch provided they don’t use the telephony 
features of iPhone. Rather than using the 
phrase “iPhone or iPod Touch,” from this point 
on, I simply refer to iPhone. A great deal of 
complicated forestry analysis has determined 
that this shortening of the phrase will save 
43.25 trees. Again, unless used in the context 
of telephony, iPhone includes iPod Touch.

291
 Chapter 19: Presenting a Keynote Presentation
menu bar to the primary screen. Often the primary screen will be your 
desktop or laptop screen; the secondary screen (without the menu bar) 
can be used for other windows that you can use for your work.
 
If you’re going to be giving a Keynote presentation that uses two screens, try 
to use Displays in System Preferences before you’re ready to begin. If you can 
get to the presentation area ten minutes before the audience arrives, you can 
arrange screens so that they see what’s important. If you can’t do this, tempo-
rarily create a new user account on your computer, and copy your presenta-
tion and any other needed files to that user’s Public folder. Do this without 
connecting to any publicly visible screen. Then, log on as the new user. The 
desktop will be empty and the only visible files will be your presentation. If 
you need to move files around and adjust the screen layout, you can do this 
without everyone looking at the files you have on your computer. Still, the 
better choice is to use your actual account and set things up before the audi-
ence arrives.
Regardless of how you arrange the screens, use Energy Saver to prevent the 
screen from dimming. If you’re using a laptop, plug it in. You’ll use a bit more 
power, but you won’t have to jiggle the mouse button to prevent the com-
puter from going to sleep.
Like all iWork applications, you can set preferences for Keynote. Begin by 
choosing Keynote➪Preferences to open the Preferences window shown in 
Figure 19-1.
 
Figure 19-1: 
Set Keynote 
prefer-
ences.
 
The General, Rulers, and Auto-Correction preferences are standard for all 
iWork apps. The ones that matter for your presentations are Slideshow, 
Presenter Display, and Remote. I go over each in this section.

292
Part IV: Presenting Keynote 
Slideshow preferences
The Slideshow preferences are shown in Figure 19-1. Here are the choices for 
you to consider about those preferences:
 
✓ Scale slides up: This option scales (that is, enlarges) the slides to fill the 
display. Particularly on a projection TV, you have plenty of space to play 
with, so you might as well use it. However, if your presentation will be 
made at different times on different size displays, you may want to reset 
this preference for the display just before you give your presentation.
 
✓ Exit presentation after last slide: Consider what will happen at the 
end of your presentation. If you exit the presentation, there you’ll be 
(along with your audience), looking at your desktop and the files on it. 
Consider placing a special slide at the end of the presentation. It can 
be a simple “The End” slide, but you can also make it more useful. “For 
more info, contact XXX” provides a neutral final slide that can remain 
visible until the last person has left the room.
 
✓ Minimize distractions from transitions and other applications: That’s 
the idea behind reducing Cube transitions, reducing Flip transitions, 
and not allowing Exposé, Dashboard, and other apps to intrude on your 
Keynote presentation.
 
✓ Set pointer preferences: You have three pointer preferences. If you’re 
used to pointing with the pointer, use the option to show the pointer 
when the mouse moves. (The alternative is to have a separate pointer 
for your presentation, which seems like overkill.)
 
✓ Choose the display for slides: If you have more than one display, 
choose the one for slides to appear on. If you have a single display or a 
mirrored display, you don’t have a choice. Otherwise, choose the dis-
play that is connected to a projection TV. It doesn’t matter if it’s a pri-
mary or secondary display: Keynote will do the right thing.
Also consider a special introductory slide that can play as a movie before 
your presentation begins. Create a movie or an iPhoto slideshow from rel-
evant photos and images. You can add music. If you watch various presenta-
tions, you’ll see that such introductory movies or slideshows can consist of 
excerpts from previous presentations, promotional materials, or even adver-
tisements. Your goal is to provide a lead-in to your presentation.
Presenter Display preferences
Figure 19-2 shows the Presenter Display preferences. The Presenter Display 
is available only if you have two displays connected to your computer or if 
you’re using Keynote Remote on an iPhone, but the Presenter Display prefer-
ences are available even if you only have one display at the time you’re 

293
 Chapter 19: Presenting a Keynote Presentation
setting the preferences. This means you can configure your Presenter Display 
preferences before you get to the auditorium with the big projection display.
 
Figure 19-2: 
Set 
Presenter 
Display 
prefer-
ences.
 
In addition to customizing the Presenter Display preferences, you can format 
the presenter’s display by using the Customize Presenter Display button at 
the bottom of the Presenter Display Preferences screen. Click that button to 
open the window shown in Figure 19-3; drag items to rearrange them on the 
presenter’s display.
If you’re accustomed to giving presentations, two features are absolute gifts. 
The first is the time. Elapsed time for a slide is useful, but if your presenta-
tion is scheduled from, say, 2:00 to 2:45, knowing the exact time can help you 
speed up as needed or stop for a Q&A period if you see that there’s time to 
spare. Of course, you don’t need Keynote to do this: You can step up to the 
podium and take your watch off so you can keep track of time. There is a 
technical word for this frequently repeated gesture: tacky. It’s almost as bad 
as a speaker rifling through the remaining pages of a speech to see how much 
material is left. Keynote hides what should be hidden and shows it to you if 
and when you need it.
Equally valuable is the ability to see the next slide. Transitions from one slide 
to another are often left to the speaker, as in “But how does that work in 
practice?” or “What’s a good example of this?” If you see the next slide cued 
up, you can make the appropriate transition.
Another feature of the Presenter Display is shown in Figure 19-4: You can add 
presenter’s notes to the display. By being able to see the current slide and 
the next slide along with notes you have prepared, everything you need for 
your presentation is in front of you without distracting the audience.

 Chapter 19: Presenting a Keynote Presentation
 
You enter presenter’s notes for a slide by choosing View➪Show Presenter 
Notes or clicking View on the toolbar. This preference controls where and if 
the presenter’s notes you’ve entered for slides are shown on the presenter’s 
display.
Remote preferences
As mentioned, with iWork ’09 you can control presentations and view pre-
senter’s notes by downloading the Keynote Remote application from iTunes 
and installing it on your iPhone or iPod Touch.
Launch a Keynote presentation on your computer, and then launch Keynote 
Remote on your iPhone. You’ll be asked to make a connection to your 
computer. The iPhone will locate a nearby computer running Keynote, and 
Keynote will ask you to confirm the connection, as shown in Figure 19-5. If 
you want to connect to that iPhone, click the Link button at the right.
 
Figure 19-5: 
Accept (or 
decline) the 
invitation 
to link to an 
iPhone.
 
When you click Link, a code is displayed on Keynote Remote on your iPhone. 
Type that code as shown in Figure 19-6.
The connection between iPhone and Keynote is now complete. You’ll see the 
first slide of the current presentation on your iPhone. Buttons on the screen 
let you skip to the beginning or end of the presentation. For standard move-
ment, just use your finger to drag the current slide aside on your iPhone. You 
don’t need to touch your computer.

296
Part IV: Presenting Keynote 
 
Figure 19-6: 
Accept the 
pairing.
 
An option on Keynote Remote shows presenter notes below the slides on 
your iPhone. This means you now have two places for presenter’s notes: on 
the computer or on an iPhone.
Using your iPhone means that you can wander around more: The computer 
with its projection TV output doesn’t need hands-on attention from you 
because you’re driving the slides from your iPhone. However, now that 
you’re untethered from the computer, you can no longer use the mouse to 
point to parts of a slide. (You could use a laser pointer or a wooden pointer.) 
Another mixed blessing is the absence of a presenter’s display. You can have 
speaker’s notes on Keynote Remote, but if you like being able to see the next 
slide, that feature is available only from an alternate display on your com-
puter. The feature that shows you the current time is available on Keynote 
Remote, in the top center of the iPhone screen as always.

W
hen it comes to Numbers and Pages, you have a variety of choices for 
sharing your documents. But those choices are insignificant next to 
the choices for sharing and automating Keynote presentations. This chapter 
shows you some of the features you can add to your presentations. Because 
presentations involve text, images, and a variety of media components, you 
can export them to any of the movie and DVD formats available on your Mac. 
You can also share them through the Web — using the various iLife apps as 
well as Web-sharing sites such as YouTube.
In general, the features you can add using Keynote transfer without effort to 
these other formats and platforms. The first part of this chapter shows you 
how to add Keynote features for motion, sound, and automation to your 
presentation.
Creating Different Types of Presentations
The Keynote themes are interchangeable, and each has certain basic slides 
that suggest the types of presentations you can create. It’s easy to fall into a 
trap of thinking that these are the only types of presentations you can create 
with Keynote. This section will give you some additional ideas.

298
Part IV: Presenting Keynote 
Reviewing the slide masters
First of all, Figure 20-1 shows the basic slide masters available in Keynote, 
although remember that some themes have alternate versions.
 
Figure 20-1: 
Explore 
Keynote’s

masters.
 
You don’t have to use all the slide masters in a given theme. Here are some of 
the types of presentations you can create with the various themes and slide 
masters:
 
✓ Basic structured presentations: These are presentations that emphasize 
content and organization. They typically use bulleted lists of informa-
tion. Keynote’s organizing tools help people follow your presentation 
without getting lost.

299
 Chapter 20: Improving Your Keynote Presentation
 
✓ Catalogs, albums, and event presentations: These tend to use slide 
masters with space for photos. Whereas basic structured presentations 
tend to use bulleted lists to create a hierarchical structure, these pre-
sentations have a less hierarchical structure. Their organizing structure 
can be chronological (a wedding day, for example) or informational (a 
product catalog is a good example).
 
✓ Creative presentations: Keynote is part of iWork, but that doesn’t mean 
you can’t use it to explore your creative side. You can merge the struc-
ture of bulleted slides with images for an art appreciation presentation. 
You can also use a Keynote presentation to tell a story or create a scrap-
book. Depending on your resources and your audience, it may be easier 
to construct your story as a Keynote presentation than as an iPhoto 
slideshow. One deciding factor may be whether you have photos and 
video that you can use in telling your story. If you don’t, Keynote, with 
its excellent handling of text, can be more effective than iPhoto.
Planning your presentation
Different types of presentations lend themselves to different types of inter-
actions with their audiences. Keynote lets you package and automate your 
presentation. Most people find that self-running presentations work well for 
catalogs and albums; they can stand on their own, like advertisements or 
magazine articles.
Complex structured presentations such as those used at trade shows or 
in classrooms often don’t work well as self-running presentations. Instead, 
having someone (probably you) control the presentation and stop for ques-
tions and discussions can help get the message across.
The choices are built into Keynote, mostly through its themes, so it’s just a 
matter of experimenting with your options to find the most effective method 
for your own presentation.
 
One way to improve your Keynote presentations is to watch other presenta-
tions. What interests you? What do you like? If there’s a live audience, watch 
them and see what they like. There are no hard-and-fast rules. A presentation 
designed for a college class is different from one designed for a Bridal Faire 
(and not just in spelling of the title). Some presentations benefit from a serious 
approach, while others work well with humor and added features.

Part IV: Presenting Keynote 
Adding Motion to Your Presentation
Your Keynote slideshows can use motion in three ways. This can make the 
slideshow more interesting and keep people’s attention. (Or it can be dis-
tracting: Use your judgment.)
Here are the three basic ways to add motion to your Keynote presentation:
 
✓ Insert a QuickTime movie onto a slide.
 
✓ Add transitions between slides.
 
✓ Add builds within slides.
Adding a movie to a slide
The most basic way of adding movement to your presentation is to add a 
QuickTime movie to a slide. Here’s how you do it:
 
1. Click Media on the toolbar to open Media Browser, from which you 
can choose movies, photos, and audio, as shown in Figure 20-2.
 
Figure 20-2: 
Add a movie 
to your pre-
sentation.
 

301
 Chapter 20: Improving Your Keynote Presentation
 
2. Drag the movie into the slide where you want it.
 
 Remember that in Media Browser, the movie is shown as a single-frame 
thumbnail image. When you drag it into a slide, it appears either as 
a shape with the typical eight handles or as the movie itself (not the 
thumbnail). That’s why you see the FlorenceMovie.mov thumbnail in 
Figure 20-2, and part of the movie itself in Figure 20-3.
 
Figure 20-3: 
Position the 
movie on 
the slide.
 
 
3. Select the QuickTime movie on the slide and use QuickTime inspec-
tor, as shown in Figure 20-4, to set up the movie.
 
 Depending on the movie, you may want to vary the settings shown in 
Figure 20-4. If the movie is to start with a click, most likely you’ll want 
to set a poster frame so that a still image is visible on your slide before 
the movie starts playing. If you’re using the movie for an introductory 
or final slide, you may want to set the Repeat options so that the movie 
loops over and over or loops back and forth. If you’re using the movie as 
part of your presentation (that is, as a movie to be played from start to 
finish with the click of a mouse), you probably don’t want any looping.

302
Part IV: Presenting Keynote 
 
Figure 20-4: 
Use 
QuickTime 
inspector to

movie.
 
Adding a transition between slides
Another way to add motion to your presentation is to use one of the transi-
tion effects between two adjacent slides. Here’s how to do that:
 
1. Select the slide for the transition.
 
 The transition will come into play when you move from this slide to the 
next one.
 
2. Click the Slide button in Slide inspector and then click the Transition 
tab, as shown in Figure 20-5.
 
Figure 20-5: 
Use Slide 
inspector 
and the 
Transition 
tab to set up 
a transition.
 

303
 Chapter 20: Improving Your Keynote Presentation
 
3. Select the transition you want from the list of effects shown in 
Figure 20-6.
 
 Not all effects are available on all computers (some require advanced 
video cards). Try to avoid turning your presentation into a presentation 
about transitions. If you limit your transitions to a few, and if you choose 
consistent directions, you’ll find that your transitions serve your presen-
tation rather than the other way around.
 
Figure 20-6: 
Select the 
transition 
and its 
direction.
 
 
One technique many presenters use is to home in on two or three transitions, 
each of which plays a distinct role. For example, if your presentation is highly 
structured, you might want to use a dramatic transition such as a 3-D effect 
to introduce each major section of the presentation. Then, within each major 
section, use simpler 2-D effects for minor transitions. If you’re consistent with 
the use of transitions, they add to your presentation.
 
As you can see from Figure 20-6, transitions are available that use text and 
graphics so that you can move from one slide to another without causing 
distraction. One interesting transition is Magic Move, which you use when 
you have the same object, such as a text box, on both slides that are part of 
the transition. If the same object appears on both slides in different locations, 

304
Part IV: Presenting Keynote 
Keynote performs a transition that appears to move the object from its loca-
tion on the first slide to its location on the second slide. This transition is 
powerful when you’re discussing the object and its text or graphics.
Adding builds within slides
Builds work within a single slide; they let you bring slide items such as bul-
lets onto the slide with animation effects.
Builds have three aspects: Build In (for items appearing on the slide), Build 
Out (for items disappearing from the slide), and Action.
You set the builds as follows:
 
1. Begin with the complete slide.
 
 Make certain that all bullets, titles, and graphics are visible.
 
2. Open Build inspector, as shown in Figure 20-7.
 
Figure 20-7: 
Build 
inspector.
 

305
 Chapter 20: Improving Your Keynote Presentation
 
3. On the slide itself, select the first item to build (it doesn’t matter if it’s 
built in or out).
 
 With the item (such as a bullet) selected, choose Build In or Build Out, 
and then choose an effect, a direction, an order, and a color. The order 
determines the sequence in which builds are performed.
 
 The Delivery option lets you set items within a group: all at once, by 
bullet, by bullet group (such as a subgroup), and by highlighted bullet. 
Watch out, because this is an area where you can obscure the content of 
your presentation with too many and too varied builds.
 
4. Using the same process, select all the build ins and build outs you 
want.
 
 You don’t need to have both build ins and build outs. In many cases, a 
single style of build is more than enough.
 
5. Use effects for movement that may be less structured than the sliding 
in and out of a build.
 
 Figure 20-8 shows the available effects. Letters and images will appear 
from all directions in many of these effects.
 
Figure 20-8: 
Select an 
effect.

Part IV: Presenting Keynote 
Adding Sound to Your Presentation
You can add sound to your presentation in three ways:
 
✓ QuickTime movies: If you’re adding a movie to your presentation, that 
movie can have a soundtrack and you can play it with the movie.
 
✓ Voice-over slideshow recording: You can prerecord your narration of 
a presentation. This prerecording adds a soundtrack; it also automati-
cally saves the timing of slides so that they are synchronized with your 
soundtrack. By adding a soundtrack like this, your presentation is play-
able automatically.
 
✓ iTunes music for a soundtrack: You can add iTunes music to your 
presentation.
Recording a slideshow
To add a voice-over soundtrack, begin with the Audio tab of Document 
inspector, as shown in Figure 20-9.
 
Figure 20-9: 
Use 
Keynote’s 
Document 
inspector.
 
Click the Record button in the Slideshow Recording section at the bottom of 
the window. You walk through the presentation; in the upper left, a sound 
level appears as you speak, as shown in Figure 20-10. Keynote keeps track of 
when you have advanced to the next slide so that the presentation and the 
soundtrack are both recorded.

307
 Chapter 20: Improving Your Keynote Presentation
 
Figure 20-10:

presentation 
and 
narration.
 
Using the recorded slideshow
Figure 20-11 shows how you can use Document inspector with a recorded 
presentation. The Presentation pop-up menu includes a Recorded option and 
a Self-Playing option after you have recorded the presentation. Together with 
the option to automatically play when the Keynote document is opened, you 
have a powerful self-running presentation.
 
Figure 20-11:

tage of your

308
Part IV: Presenting Keynote 
Adding an iTunes song
You can add an iTunes track to your presentation (refer to Figure 20-9). You 
can use the looping feature to repeat it behind all the slides. Note that adding 
an iTunes song is in addition to the ability to use Media Browser’s Audio tab 
(click Media on the toolbar and then click the Audio tab) to add an iTunes 
track to an individual slide.

Part V
The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
T
he chapters in this part are top ten lists. They provide 
you with ways to share content (a much-enhanced 
feature of iWork ’09) and ways to let iWork do the work 
for you with Automator and AppleScript.
The features described in this part of the book apply to all 
iWork applications. It makes for a full circle with Part I, 
which also applies to all iWork applications.
If you come away with the impression that iWork has a 
powerful set of commands and features available in any of 
its applications, that’s good. The differences between 
Numbers, Pages, and Keynote reflect their specific objec-
tives, but what you have in iWork is perhaps the most 
robust and full-featured user interface for productivity 
tools that has yet been created.

Chapter 21
Ten Ways to Share Content
In This Chapter
▶ Sharing content with yourself and other users
▶ Sharing content with other people on your network
▶ Sharing content on the Web
▶ Sharing content by using Send To
▶ Using photos from iPhoto
▶ Using music from iTunes
▶ Using movies from iMovie
▶ Using PDF files as images
▶ Adding hyperlinks to iWork documents
▶ Moving data from other applications into iWork
You don’t have to start from scratch every time you create an iWork doc-
ument. You can build on other documents you’ve created, and you can 
build on the templates that are part of iWork. You can also include content 
that has been created with other applications. iWork and Mac OS X make it 
easy to reuse your work. This chapter provides you with ten ways to accom-
plish that goal.
There are two basic ways to share content:
 
✓ Copying content: You can copy content to a flash drive or other place 
from which you and others can retrieve it.
 
✓ Accessing content: You can provide a mechanism that lets people 
access the data. You don’t copy the data: There is one file, and everyone 
accesses it. This eliminates problems with data synchronization because 
there are no copies.

312
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Sharing Content with MobileMe
MobileMe is Apple’s subscription-based service that provides email 
addresses (yourname@me.com) along with disk storage on Apple’s servers. 
MobileMe is integrated with many features of Mac OS X. For example, your 
calendars and Address Book entries can be automatically synchronized 
between your Mac and your iPhone. Your iDisk, which is part of MobileMe, 
appears as just another folder in your Finder window. With the sophisticated 
synchronization features of the second version of the iPhone, more and more 
iPhone users are using MobileMe.
MobileMe lets you use a Web browser to access your calendars, Address 
Book, and me.com email. You also can access disk storage that comes with 
MobileMe. You can use this disk storage for backups; you can also use it to 
share files with other people.
If you have a MobileMe account, your Web storage (called iDisk) can be 
accessed in a browser window (see in Figure 21-1).
 
Figure 21-1: 
Use a 
browser to 
access your 
iDisk.
 

313
 Chapter 21: Ten Ways to Share Content
You can also access your iDisk using the Finder on a Mac, as shown in 
Figure 21-2.
 
Figure 21-2: 
Use a Finder 
window 
to access 
iDisk.
 
If you don’t see your iDisk in the Finder window, choose Finder➪Preferences 
to open the dialog shown in Figure 21-3. Make certain that iDisk is checked.
 
Figure 21-3: 
Use Finder 
Preferences 
to show 
iDisk in the

windows.
 

314
Part V: The Part of Tens 
You can drag files or folders to your Public folder on your iDisk so that other 
people can share them. In the MobileMe section of System Preferences, 
shown in Figure 21-4, you can determine how people can access your Public 
folder on your iDisk (read only or read and write, as well as whether or not 
they need a password to log on).
 
Figure 21-4: 
People 
can log 
on to your 
MobileMe 
Public 
folder.
 
People can access your Public folder on your iDisk by choosing Go➪iDisk➪
Other User’s Public Folder. If necessary, they will be prompted for the Public 
folder password you set. They can also choose Go➪iDisk➪Other User’s iDisk, 
which does use this special Public folder password. Instead, they need your 
full iDisk account name password, which you should always be hesitant to 
give out.
Sharing Content with People 
on Your Network
If you are working on a local network, letting people access your Public folder 
is handled differently than when you’re using MobileMe on the Web.
If you want to allow other people on your network to access your Public 
folder, choose System Preferences➪Sharing to open the pane shown in 
Figure 21-5.

315
 Chapter 21: Ten Ways to Share Content
 
Figure 21-5: 
Set sharing 
privileges 
for public 
folders 
on your 
computer.
 
The settings in Figure 21-5 determine what other people can see when they 
navigate to your public folder. Figure 21-6 shows the view of your home 
directory that you can see yourself.
 
Figure 21-6: 
Set privi-
leges for 
folders.
 
With the default settings for your folders in place, other users would see the 
folders but not be able to see inside them. The Public folder’s sharing pref-
erences are set as shown in Figure 21-5. The result is shown in Figure 21-7. 
Users can see only a drop box folder inside the Public folder. A special icon 
next to Jesse Feiler’s Public Folder indicates that it’s a drop box. Anyone can 
drop files and folders into the drop box, but they cannot see the contents — 
even if the contents consist of files and folders that they have dropped into 
the drop box. For a drop box, no users (except the owner) can see inside the 

316
Part V: The Part of Tens 
folder. That includes all information, including the modification date, which 
is not shown in Figure 21-7.

Sometimes you need to log on to another user’s folder on your network with 
a different user ID than the one you are currently logged in with. (This could 
happen if you have saved settings in KeyChain and now want to log on with a 
different ID.) Here’s how you do it:
 
1. Log out from the remote server.
 
 In the Finder, drag the remote server to the trash. Or select it, Ô-click to 
open the contextual menu, and choose Eject. A third method is to click 
the eject button next to the remote server’s name in the Finder sidebar.
 
2. Log on again with the new ID you want to use.
 
 Click the Network icon, as shown in Figure 21-8.
 
Figure 21-8:

again.
 

317

3. Make certain you log on as a registered user, as shown in Figure 21-9.
 
Figure 21-9: 
Log on with 
the correct 
password 
and user ID.
 
Sharing Content on iWeb
If you have a MobileMe account, you can share content through iWeb. You 
can post files automatically to your iWeb blogs from any of the iWork apps, 
as shown in Figure 21-10. Choose Share➪Send to iWeb to begin the process. 
The process continues by letting you select the file type for the file you will 
be sending to iWeb. After you’ve uploaded the files, people can download 
them.
 
Figure 21-10: 
Post files on 
your iWeb 
blogs.
 
You can always save an iWork document as a PDF file or its own file type 
(Numbers, Keynote, or Pages). In addition, Keynote documents can be saved 
as podcasts.
Sharing Content Using Send To
Share➪Send via Mail lets you send documents via email. The Send To com-
mand lets you send a PDF file or a native iWork file; in addition, you can send 
the corresponding Microsoft Office file type (Word, Excel, or PowerPoint).

318
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Using Media from iPhoto, 
iTunes, and iMovie
All of the iWork applications let you insert media from iPhoto, iTunes, or 
iMovie. Begin by clicking Media on the toolbar to open Media Browser, 
shown in Figure 21-11.
 
Figure 21-11: 
Use Media 
Browser 
to insert 
media.
 
The iWork apps have tools to adjust inserted media. These adjustments don’t 
affect the basic media file itself, so you don’t have to worry about acciden-
tally making changes to your valued photos, music, and movies.
Using PDF Files as Images
PDF files can serve as images for your iWork documents. Remember that you 
can save almost any type of document as a PDF file. After the document has 
been saved as a PDF file, you can insert it in an iWork app. This is a backup 
strategy for sharing files; iWork apps can open many types of files directly. 

319
 Chapter 21: Ten Ways to Share Content
For example, the standard File➪Open command in Pages lets you open a 
Microsoft Word document; Pages takes care of the conversion for you. The 
PDF strategy works well for any type of document that you can print as a PDF 
file and that you are not able to open directly in an iWork app.
Adding Hyperlinks to iWork Documents
You can add hyperlinks to iWork documents so that you can click the hyper-
link and see the hyperlink’s data on the screen. Here’s how to add a hyperlink 
to an iWork document:
 
1. In an iWork document, select the text that will become the hyperlink.
 
2. Open Link inspector, as shown in Figure 21-12.
 
3. Select the type of link and then type the link’s URL in the inspector.
 
Figure 21-12: 
Use Link 
inspector 
to create a 
hyperlink 
in an iWork 
document.
 
Moving Data from Other 
Applications into iWork
The all-purpose method for moving data from other applications into iWork 
is Insert➪Choose. This opens the standard file dialog shown in Figure 21-13. 
Among the types of files you can open are standard GIF and JPEG files, 
Photoshop files (.psd), HTML files, and PDF files.

A
re you pointing and clicking your way through the tasks at hand? With 
the Mac OS X automation tools, you can specify what you want to do 
and then have Mac OS X and apps such as the iWork apps carry out your 
wishes.
A wide variety of automation tools are available. Some construct scripts 
using scripting languages found not only in Mac OS X but also in other 
operating systems. Two of the most important Mac OS X–only tools are 
AppleScript and Automator. They’re the jumping-off point for this chapter. 
After you see the basics of AppleScript and Automator, you find specific ways 
to use them to automate your iWork projects.
AppleScript’s syntax is built into Mac OS X and many applications, including 
the iWork applications. There are two major components to AppleScript:

322
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
✓ Script Editor: This is the primary application that you use to create 
scripts for AppleScript. It is within the AppleScript folder, which is inside 
the Applications folder on your hard disk. You don’t have to do anything 
to turn on Script Editor; it’s part of the normal Mac OS X installation.
 
✓ AppleScript dictionaries: Every AppleScript-aware application has its 
own AppleScript dictionary. The AppleScript dictionary for an applica-
tion is built automatically from the AppleScript commands that the 
developer supports in the application; no external documentation is 
required. If AppleScript is supported by the app, the AppleScript diction-
ary is visible.
Finding and Browsing the Pages 
AppleScript Dictionary
The first step in using AppleScript is to browse the dictionary for the appro-
priate application. Here’s how to browse the Pages dictionary. As you’ll see, 
it’s the first step to scripting the creation of a Pages document.
 
1. Launch Script Editor.
 
 Choose Applications➪AppleScript➪Script Editor. By default, you see the 
basic window shown in Figure 22-1.
 
2. Open the script dictionary by choosing File➪Open Dictionary.
Letting iWork do your work
A host of timesaving features are built into the 
iWork apps. The most obvious are the built-in 
themes and templates. Instead of starting from 
a blank document, you can start from a docu-
ment with built-in pages, sheets, and sections. 
You don’t have to worry about laying out your 
documents. You can perform the much simpler 
task of modifying existing documents.
There’s a second way to save time with the 
iWork apps. Rather than retype content, you 
can copy and paste it from other documents 
(not just from iWork documents) or drag it over 
to your new document. This reuse of material 
helps you get the most out of your previous 
analysis and keystrokes (not to mention movies 
and graphics you’ve already stored in your 
media libraries on Mac OS X).
With AppleScript, you have yet another way 
of saving time. You can construct scripts that 
create and format sections of iWork applica-
tions. These can work together with the built-in 
themes and templates. To get the most out of 
iWork (and the most out of your time!), you’ll 
probably want to explore all these ways of 
working. Use whatever feels most convenient 
at any given time.

323
 Chapter 22: Ten Ways to Let iWork Do the Work for You
 
Figure 22-1: 
Open Script 
Editor.
 
 
 Locate the application you’re looking for, as shown in Figure 22-2. Note 
that each application has its own version number. In the case of iWork 
’09 Pages, it’s version 4.0. You’ll probably find a number of previous ver-
sions of your various software products.
 
Figure 22-2: 
Open the 
appropriate 
dictionary.
 

324
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
3. View the suites.
 
 AppleScript dictionaries are divided into suites, as shown in Figure 22-3. 
Each suite can have commands (a C in a circle) as well as components 
(a C in a square). Each has a syntax description.
 
Figure 22-3: 
Look at the 
suites.
 
Now that you’ve briefly looked at the dictionary, you can begin to explore 
commands to automate your work.
Creating a Script
If you’ve used any programming languages, you’ll find using the syntax for a 
script even simpler because Script Editor has the full syntax and examples in 
its Help menu.
Scripts are usually addressed to specific AppleScript objects: These can be 
applications or objects within applications. (The dictionary tells you what 
objects are addressable.) Figure 22-4 provides a basic script for use with Pages.
Counting tables on a Pages page
Commands are addressed to scriptable items. Spacing is generated auto-
matically in Script Editor when you click either Run or Compile. If there are 

325
 Chapter 22: Ten Ways to Let iWork Do the Work for You
syntax errors, the text coloring or spacing (or both) clearly indicates that 
there’s a problem.
 
Figure 22-4: 
Create a 
script for 
Pages.
 
The script shown in Figure 22-4 is simple. Here’s what’s happening:
 
✓ tell application “Pages”: All commands within this section 
(called a tell block), are sent to Pages.
 
✓ tell document 1: Within Pages, each opened document is given a 
number automatically when it is opened. 1 is the frontmost document, 
and Pages makes certain that it receives the next line of code.
 
✓ count tables: Document 1 is asked to count the number of tables it has.
The dictionary for Pages includes the count command in the Standard Suite, 
as shown in Figure 22-5. As soon as you’ve spent some time with AppleScript, 
you’ll become familiar with the basic suites such as the Standard Suite. 
Developers are encouraged to implement the basic parts of AppleScript in 
the same way for each application. This is made easier because the Mac OS 
X development framework (Cocoa) handles a lot of this implementation so 
neither user nor developer needs to worry much about the implementation 
of the count command.
Adding a table to a Pages document
The script shown in Figure 22-6 is a variation on the previous script. It tells 
the current page to add a table and then to count the resulting number of 
tables. The code to add the table was shown in Figure 22-3. It’s part of the 
Pages application suite.

326
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
Figure 22-5: 
The count 
command is 
described 
in the 
dictionary.
 
This is a fairly typical structure of suites for an AppleScript-enabled appli-
cation. Suites such as the Standard Suite are implemented by almost all 
AppleScript-enabled applications. Then a specific application such as Pages 
is likely to have its own application suite that can act on objects within 
the application, such as Pages. Further focused suites such as the Pages 
Graphics Suite and Pages Text Suite handle specific types of operations.
Figure 22-6 shows the script that adds the table.
 
Figure 22-6: 
Tell a docu-
ment to add 
a table and 
count its 
tables.
 

327
 Chapter 22: Ten Ways to Let iWork Do the Work for You
Retrieving properties about 
a table in Pages
You can always get properties for objects that are addressable in 
AppleScript. Figure 22-7 shows you how you can get the properties for the 
table you just created.
 
Figure 22-7: 
Tell a docu-
ment to get 
the proper-
ties for a 
table.
 
Compare the properties of a table as retrieved through AppleScript with the 
properties for the same table as shown in Table inspector in Pages. If you really 
want to get into the nuts-and-bolts of an application like Pages (or any other 
iWork app), you can get used to this cross-referencing of settings. Often a slightly 
different terminology is used for an Inspector window than for AppleScript prop-
erties. Sometimes the difference in terminology reflects different audiences for 
interactive users of the software and people who are writing scripts.
Setting properties for a table 
in Pages (version 1)
As you saw in Figure 22-7, you can get the properties for a table (or any other 
Pages object). You can set those properties interactively using the Inspector 
window or using Apple Script. This section shows you one way of setting 
preferences (you’ll find another method in the next section).

328
Part V: The Part of Tens 
In previous scripts, you’ve seen how you can get or set information through 
AppleScript. In general, you create a tell block to send information to Pages 
(or whatever app you’re dealing with). Within that tell block, you send 
one or more commands to a specific document, and that document is then 
charged with referencing the table or other object you need to handle. In the 
previous examples, you’ve been asking Document 1 to get information about 
Table 1.
To set properties, you can use the structure shown in Figure 22-8. Here, the 
same tell block sends commands to Pages; within that tell block, mes-
sages are sent not to Document 1 but instead to Table 1 of Document 1.
 
Figure 22-8: 
Set pref-
erences 
(version 1).
 
A final tell block is addressed to Document 1, not to Table 1 of Document 1, 
because the document needs to retrieve the properties for the table it 
contains.
The section that sets properties is based on the output shown previously in 
Figure 22-7. Although you can look up properties in the AppleScript diction-
ary, the fastest way to find the correct names and spelling of properties is to 
get the properties for a similar object (such as a table), and use the names 
and spellings such as those shown in Figure 22-7 as the basis for setting prop-
erties as shown in Figure 22-8.

329
 Chapter 22: Ten Ways to Let iWork Do the Work for You
Setting properties for a table 
in Pages (version 2)
This version of setting properties uses a tell block that goes directly to 
the appropriate document. Instead of dispatching commands to Table 1 of 
Document 1, the commands are dispatched to Document 1, and those com-
mands reference Table 1, as shown in Figure 22-9.
Neither of these two versions is better than the other; you can use whichever 
one seems easiest to you at the time.

erences

Using Automator with Keynote
One of the other major components of Mac OS X automation is Automator. 
Like AppleScript, it’s installed automatically as part of your operating system. 
You can find Automator in your Applications folder.
Figure 22-10 shows you the basics of Automator. With Script Editor, you can 
create scripted code for operations you want to perform. With Automator, 
you’re developing a workflow that brings together sequences of events.

330
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
Figure 22-10: 
Use 
Automator 
to import 
images to 
Keynote 
slides.
 
At the left side of the Automator window are various actions that you can use to 
build a workflow at the right. When you select an action at the left, its descrip-
tion is shown at the bottom of the window. As you drag it into the workflow area, 
the actions are added, one to the other. The arrows between the actions indicate 
that output from one action can flow into the next action as input.
The sample Automator workflow shown in Figure 22-10 lets you select Finder 
items. It then automatically creates new Keynote slides from each image 
you’ve selected. 
Using Automator with Images
Automator comes with a number of actions that you can assemble into work-
flows to handle images. Figure 22-11 shows how you can use three actions in 
a workflow to prepare images for use in any application (including the iWork 
applications).
Simply drag these three actions into the workflow. As you drag the scaling 
and rotating actions, you’ll be warned that these actions will permanently 
affect the files you’ve selected. Automator not only warns you but also offers 
to add actions to the workflow to copy the files before they’re adjusted. 
Those steps have been omitted from Figure 22-11 for simplicity.

331
 Chapter 22: Ten Ways to Let iWork Do the Work for You
 
Figure 22-11: 
Rotate 
and scale 
images with 
Automator.
 
This type of workflow can make your use of images more consistent so that 
they are scaled appropriately.
Using Automator with Multiple Files
Many of your Automator workflows start with the Ask for Finder Items 
action. You set up the workflow you want to perform, and everything is auto-
matic once you start it running and select the files.
Instead of selecting an individual file, create a folder into which you put a 
number of files that you want to process. You can put those files into the 
folder whenever you feel like it — possibly over a period of days. Then, when 
it comes time to carry out the workflow, start with the Ask for Finder 
Items action as usual to select the folder, but then insert one of the two 
actions that can automatically select the individual files: 
 
✓ Get Folder Contents. This action starts from the folder you select in 
Ask for Finder Items, and then takes each file within it and sends 
the whole set of files into the next action. An option lets you repeat this 
for subfolders (recursively, as programmers would say).
 
✓ Filter Finder Items. Selects all the files within a folder based on 
criteria you specify, such as the file name (or part of a name) or the type 
of file.

332
Part V: The Part of Tens 
You can combine both actions so that you get the contents of a folder (and 
possibly its subfolders), then filter only the JPEG files, and pass them on to 
image manipulation or to another action, such as Create Image Slide.
Remember that the Finder handles alias files just as it does actual files. 
This means you can create a folder into which you place aliases of files you 
want to process in Automator. (To create an alias, select the file and choose 
File➪Make Alias or Ô-L.) You can keep the actual files wherever you would 
normally store them on your computer. When you’ve finished with the 
Automator action, you can trash the folder with the aliases.
Looping Around Automator
Automator excels at combining actions and sending the output from one 
action into the next one as input. It easily picks up all the items in a folder, 
possibly filtering them. “All” is an important part of Automator. It means you 
don’t have to write code that is repeated for each folder or other object.
But sometimes that’s important. A recent addition to Automator is the Loop 
action. Along with the Run Workflow action, you can create powerful work-
flows that can help you with iWork and other applications. 
The Loop action lets you run the following action a certain number of 
times. You can take any action you have already created and run it with Run 
Workflow. This means that you could modify the workflows suggested previ-
ously so that you can make slides from the first 10 JPEG images in a folder. 
That’s a handy workflow to use to test if your slide layout is going to work 
with those images. When you’re satisfied, take out the loop and let the work-
flow run overnight with 3,000 images.
You can use Loop and Run Workflow to create handouts for a meeting. 
Create a workflow that prints several documents. You can use Ask for 
Finder Items, but you have to interact with it (so it can’t run unattended). 
Use Get Specified Finder Items so that you can specify the items you 
want in advance and the workflow can then run unattended.
For each document that you want to print for the handout, use Get 
Specified Finder Items to select that one document. In the workflow, 
place Print Finder Items below it so that document will be printed. 
Then repeat the process with each document you want for the handout. The 
workflow will then print them in the order you have specified. Add the Loop 
action to run that workflow, and you’ll have an automated way to print and 
collate 100 copies of your handouts (provided you don’t run out of paper).

i
Work ’09 comes with a new feature: a public beta version of iWork.com. 
This is a new way of sharing your iWork documents as you work on them.
Want to work with two colleagues on a presentation? No big deal: Start by 
uploading your Keynote document. Then a friend can download it and make 
changes in the document as a Microsoft PowerPoint document. Back it goes 
to the Internet, and someone else can download it in yet another format. This 
is an example of a new trend called cloud computing. It’s also an example of 
people being able to work together on their own terms. You don’t have to get 
together and decide which presentation (or spreadsheet or word processing) 
application you’ll all use.
The Share menu (new in iWork ’09) lets you send documents from Keynote, 
Numbers, and Pages via email; it also lets you send an iWork document to 
GarageBand, iDVD, iTunes, iPhoto, iWeb, and YouTube.
iWork.com adds another way of collaborating on a document. You can post 
an iWork document to your iWork.com area, where it is visible to you and to 
people you invite to view it. Those people can then add notes and comments 
to the documents on the Web.
You can download documents from iWork.com in a variety of formats. This 
makes two types of interactions possible:
 
✓ Comments and notes on iWork documents: You can add comments to 
specific parts of iWork documents (a section of text, for example); you can 
also add notes to the document as a whole (rather than to a specific part 
of it). As a result, a number of people can work together on a document.

334
iWork ’09 For Dummies 
 
✓ Multiple revisions to iWork documents: You can download the docu-
ments to your own computer in a variety of formats. Many of these 
formats include the comments that you and others have added. Once a 
document is downloaded, it can be modified and more comments can be 
added describing the modifications.
As the iWork.com public beta proceeds, the software will change. There are 
indications that Apple may charge for the use of the service at some point, 
but no formal announcement has been made.
Logging On to iWork.com
When you are using an iWork app, the Share menu allows you to log on to 
iWork.com as shown in Figure A-1. You need an Apple Account to log on to 
iWork. If you have a MobileMe subscription account with an email address, 
your AppleID is your email address, for example, jfeiler@me.com. If you’ve 
used the Apple Store or iTunes, you most likely have an Apple account; it 
may be the same format as a me.com email address, but it could be some-
thing different (such as an old-style mac.com email address).
 
Figure A-1: 
Sign in to 
iWork.com.
 
As you can see in Figure A-1, you can create a new Apple account if you need 
to. Before you go through that process, check to see whether you have an 
existing account by logging on to iTunes or the Apple Store. If you don’t have 
an existing account, go ahead and create a new one.

335
 Appendix A: Using iWork.com
Depending on whether or not you already have an AppleID, the Share menu 
can take various formats. For example, the Sign In command allows you to log 
on as shown in Figure A-2.
 
Figure A-2: 
Sign in 
with your 
AppleID.
 
If you’re already signed in, you can sign out from the Share menu as shown in 
Figure A-3.
 
Figure A-3: 
Sign out 
from the 
Share menu.
 
If you’re using a computer in a public area (such as a public library), it makes 
sense to log out from any private areas that you’re using so that the next 
person using the computer doesn’t have access to your data.
Sharing Documents with iWork.com
Choose Share➪Share via iWork.com to share an open iWork document. 
You’re prompted to specify the ways in which the document can be down-
loaded, and you’re also prompted to supply an email address for your col-
league (see Figure A-4).

com.
 
Viewing Your Shared Documents
After you’ve logged on, you can choose Share➪Show Shared Documents 
to open the browser window shown in Figure A-5. (iWork uses the default 
browser for your computer, and you must have an Internet connection to 
view your shared documents.)
 
Figure A-5: 
View shared 
docu-
ments in a 
browser.
 
In constructing the Share menu, the iWork application you’re using will take 
note of whether or not you’re logged on. In addition, it may post information 
about notes or changes that have been made, as shown in Figure A-6.

You can download your shared iWork documents from iWork.com. Use 
the Download menu at the right to choose a download format as shown in 
Figure A-7. You’ll find the appropriate iWork format, but you usually also find 
cross-platform formats such as PDF as well as Microsoft Office formats such 
as PowerPoint, Excel, and Word.

338
iWork ’09 For Dummies 
In general, changes and comments appear in all formats; document notes on 
the iWork document itself generally appear only if you download the docu-
ment as an iWork document.
In the case of complex documents, you may want to save copies of the down-
loaded files before you make changes to them.
Inviting People to View 
Shared Documents
You can add individuals to the list of people who can share a document. Click 
Add at the right of the window shown in Figure A-8. Enter the name and email 
address for the new person.
 
Figure A-8: 
Invite new 
people to 
share your 
documents.
 
As you can see in Figure A-9, you are given a link that you can send to that 
person; the link lets the person view the document.

If you ever want to see the link again, select the triangle next to the person’s 
name and email address, as shown in Figure A-10. You can then send it to a 
colleague who has lost his or her link.
 
Figure A-10:

Adding Document Notes
Someone who is invited to view your document and make changes can add 
document notes to it. When logged on to iWork.com, he or she simply needs 
to click Add at the right of the window to add a document note. It will be 
appropriately identified and time-stamped, as shown in Figure A-11.

340
iWork ’09 For Dummies 
 
Figure A-11: 
Add docu-
ment notes.
 
Document notes are downloaded when you download a document as an 
iWork document, but they are not always downloaded when you download 
the document in another format. You don’t have to worry about document 
notes being visible on iWork.com; as you can see in Figure A-12, they are 
added to a chronological list.
Adding comments to document objects
You can select an element of an iWork document and add a comment to it. 
Follow these simple steps:
 
1. Select the object to annotate.
 
 You can select text, a text box, or anything else that’s selectable in your 
iWork document. Figure A-13 shows part of the For Sale banner selected 
for annotation.
 
2. Click Add Comment at the top of the window, as shown in Figure A-14.

3. Type the comment.
 
 The comment is identified with your name and time-stamped automati-

one else and they can reply to a comment from you (it’s called working 
together).

Appendix B
Chapter Guide to iWork 
Techniques
H
ere’s a big non-surprise: Similar tasks are done the same way in most 
iWork applications. In some cases, though, the techniques are located 
in a chapter designed for one of the applications because that helps the flow 
of the narrative. For example, despite the fact that a chart or a table can be 
equally at home in a spreadsheet, a word processing document, or a presen-
tation, most people will look up charts and tables in a spreadsheet chapter, 
so that’s where you’ll find details of charting (Chapter 15).
Table B-1 shows a variety of tasks you can do with the iWork applications 
and the chapter in which that task is discussed. (If you see n/a, the task is 
not available for that particular app. For example, you can add a slide transi-
tion only to a Keynote presentation document.)
