Learning to draw - lesson notes for teachers
LESSON NOTES FOR TEACHERS 
LEARN HOW TO DRAWEssential and elementary lessons on learning how to draw for 9-14year 
olds who have interests in becoming; 
Artists, 
Architects, 
Video game designers,
Cartoon artists,
Special effects artists,
Interior Designers, 
Draughtsmen, 
Fashion Designers, 
Surveyors, Engineers, Builders, 
Illustrators, 
Graphic designers, 
Computer designers,
Set designers for film, opera, ballet, stage etc.
Time- Lessons are separated into approx. 40 min segments. 
Homestudy - 10 to 20 minutes per lesson - set work proposals suggested at end of each lesson. 
Materials: 
30x45cms or 12"x18" standard cartridge paper (thick, white, plain) sketchpad. 
2H, HB and 4B pencils 
Ruler and eraser
General lesson structure: 
5-10 min. revision and homework assessment. 
5 min. new page, draw margin and add title (bottom rh corner). 
20 min. demo and child practical drawing. 
5min. summary and suggested homework. 
NOTES
*These lessons are designed using basic skills already learned by students; to measure and to draw 
straight lines using a ruler. Elements of self-expression are based on familiarity and habit and will 
come gradually - particularly when the student grows comfortable with the lesson structure. Such 
self-expression is first emphasised in the homestudy area.
*The second part of the lessons will deal with the freehand elements of drawing but it has been my 
experience that these freehand lessons come easier with confidence, enthusiasm, discipline and a 
general understanding of the principles of perspective and the drawing of regular solids. For those 
who think good drawing has nothing to do with the understanding of basic structure need not read 
much further. Be warned that it is my way to teach that basic structure first.
*If the lessons are conducted as I have designed them the teacher will find most children will tend 
to neglect more formal homework and concentrate on expressing themselves by completing their 
drawings in their own time. I have taught these lessons to all ages including disturbed children, 
intelligent young adults, three different cultures, and to individuals completely disinterested in 
education generally. The end results were universal, the students became more perceptive and 
desired a career change. Be prepared to be besieged by parents at parent teacher nights.
The Classroom teacher needs a good clean chalkboard, white chalk and a long straight edge 
(a board tee square for the less adept). The home educator needs the same equipment as the 
student.

preamble
   ALL LESSONS - THE PREAMBLE
Lesson preamble - Pencil control for the start of all lessons 
Aim: To teach the importance of eye to hand coordination, pencil control. 
Materials: 
the sketch pad, 
the HB pencil, 
ruler. 
PENCIL CONTROL 
A) The pupil will be asked to rule a light horizontal line 1cm or 1/2 inch from the top of the page. 
The word lightly must be stressed and the student's task will be to draw the line so it is visible at 
half a meter but invisible at a meter. 
B) Have the student hold these up and the teacher will discover that only one or two students will 
be able to achieve this result. Praise those two and demonstrate to the whole class the correct 
method of holding a pencil for a long light line is to drag the pencil across the page lightly holding it 
between thumb and index finger. The trick is to move your ARM and shoulder and not your fingers!
C) Have the class draw a light line across the bottom of the page using this technique and get their 
next-door neighbour to check it for visibility at a yard. 
D) If this proves satisfactory have the student complete the verticals two verticles in the same 
manner. 
E) Hold these up for inspection and then ask the students to firm in the margin with their pencil 
leaving the corners so they can discern the difference between their light and heavy lines. 
F) Lightly construct a little box 2cmx6cm (1" x2") in the bottom right hand corner for a title, then 
firm it in as shown below.

preamble
This exercise is to be done at the beginning of every drawing class for every page as it 
slots the students mind into line control (allow 5 min. maximum).

Lesson one
  
LESSON ONE - ELEMENTARY PERSPECTIVE 
TIME: Allow one hour for this initial lesson - if combined with previous lesson 80min. It is strongly 
suggested the teacher prepares by completing the lesson sometime before attempting to teach. 
Particular measurements can then be given to those who need them.
Aim: To introduce the student to the notion of creating a three dimensional vista on a two 
dimensional plane. This lesson is particularly important as its intent is have the student create a 
picture of great depth by merely copying the lines the teacher makes on the chalkboard. The aim is 
to generally promote confidence in the student.
Materials; The sketch pad, 
HB pencil, ruler. 
We will carry on from the page prepared in the preamble lesson using the 
ruler and HB pencil ... 
a) Quarter the page as shown with light lines. Teacher should do this on the chalkboard, then wait 
for the students to catch up. 
b) Where the middle line touches the border mark two points - these are called .... RVP and LVP 
(Right and Left Vanishing Points).
http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/K9-14/draw_one.htm (1 von 8) [08.12.2002 12:37:23]

Lesson one
c) Approximate the next four light lines as shown - if the students are unsure then give absolute 
measurements 50mm (2") down - 75mm(3") up from the center.
d) Add the verticals as light construction lines. Note to the students that only three types of lines to 
be made, vertical lines or lines to the right VP or let VP ... there are none other. Again, give 
measurements if considered necessary. 35mm (1-1/2") right 50mm (2") left of center.
http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/K9-14/draw_one.htm (2 von 8) [08.12.2002 12:37:23]

Lesson one
e) Construct the next set of verticals to approximate (below) then join the tops to RVP and LVP. 
f) Firm in the lines shown.

m) Add some light lines as shown to suggest road and pavement - then firm in when satisfied. 
Demonstrate how to add some suggestions of windows and signs. Have the children hold up their 
pads at the completion of a particular time. Those who have never drawn in three dimensions will 
be encouraged and quite keen to continue. 
Home work; 
Complete the drawing adding more windows, pedestrians, cars, background or more buildings... 
encourage innovation.

LESSON - PERSPECTIVE TWO - CITY STREET (UP) 
TIME: 
Allow 40min - teacher prepartation: prepare sketch beforehand with measurements.
Aim: 
To introduce the student to the notion of creating a three dimensional vista on a two dimensional 
plane. This lesson follows on and develops the theme of the previous lesson.
Materials: 
The sketch pad, 
HB pencil, ruler, eraser
Prepare a new page with the margin as in the previous lesson using the ruler 
and HB pencil ... 
a) Quarter the page as shown with light lines. Teacher should do this on the chalkboard then wait 
for the students to catch up. 
b) In this lesson we are going to use only one vanishing point (CVP) and it is in the certer of the

perspective three - city street down
  
LESSON - PERSPECTIVE THREE - CITY STREET (DOWN) 
TIME: Allow 40min - teacher preparation minimal.
Aim: This lesson follows on and develops the theme of the previous lesson and intends to 
introduce the notion that views may differ but structural elements of perspective (and drawing) 
remain very similar.
Materials: The sketch pad, 
HB pencil, ruler. 
Prepare as in the previous lesson using the ruler and HB pencil
a) Quarter the page as shown with diagonal light lines. Teacher should do this on the chalkboard, 
then wait for the students to catch up. Add the extra light lines. In this lesson we are again going to 
use only one vanishing point (CVP) and it is in the certer of the page. Place in the lines 
approximately as shown.
http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/K9-14/draw_three.htm (1 von 6) [08.12.2002 12:38:01]

perspective three - city street down
d) Add the next series of horizontal light lines and the two extra radiating lines. Give measurements 
of students are unsure about the position of the horizontal lines as some students become nervous 
about mistakes - again note to the student that all lines in this drawing are either horizontal, 
vertical or radiate out from the center.
e) Firm in as shown.

LESSON - PERSPECTIVE FOUR - CORNER OF ROOM 
TIME: 
Allow 40min
Aim: 
To create a perspective grid using a single measurement and three vanishing points. This lesson is 
to introduce the notion of perspective 'scale'. That is, as things of equal size recede they appear 
smaller. Perspective is a method of logically determining just how much smaller.
Materials: 
The sketch pad, 
HB pencil, ruler.
Construct margin and title box then:
a) Quarter the page as shown with light lines then add the two additional lines as shown.
http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/K9-14/draw_four.htm (1 von 7) [08.12.2002 12:38:18]

perspective two - city street up
b) Measure a set distance up as shown 30mm (1,1/4") and join to RVP as indicated.
c) Where that line intersects the vertical line down from CVP construct light line from LVP as in the 
drawing.
http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/K9-14/draw_four.htm (2 von 7) [08.12.2002 12:38:18]

perspective two - city street up
d) Join the two lines to the CVP as shown.
e) Add the two extra light lines from LVP and RVP. We have now drawn four squares on the ground. 
We can now add many more going backwards using the same method of construction.
http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/K9-14/draw_four.htm (3 von 7) [08.12.2002 12:38:18]

perspective two - city street up
f) We now have 36 squares.
g) Shade the alternate squares as shown. Now we have made a floor. At this stage the student 
needs to be asked:
- Are the squares of 'equal' size?
- Why are the ones at the back smaller then the ones at the front?
- What happens to parallel lines when we draw them in 'perspective'?
- Is this what the eye or the camera sees?

perspective two - city street up
Next we shall suggest some walls.
h) Add the two extra light lines 40mm (1,1/2") up from dead center
i) Firm in the walls. 
http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/K9-14/draw_four.htm (5 von 7) [08.12.2002 12:38:18]

perspective two - city street up
j) Using only vertical lines and lines going to RVP or LVP lightly construct some windows and a door. 
Ask: 
- how could the room be made larger? (answer - lowering the ceiling).
k) Firm them in and add a door knob and a little shading on the ceiling. Ask:
- How do we know how high to make the door? (stress the importance of observation and look 
around the classroom for clues).
Is the door handle on the right or left side of the door?
http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/K9-14/draw_four.htm (6 von 7) [08.12.2002 12:38:18]

perspective two - city street up
l) I have added some more tiles (see if the student can do this by 'judgement') - an extra row on 
the right and one on the left - and shaded the door.
Clean up and print in the title as shown.
You will find some students will grasp the ideas and concepts faster than others. Instead of having 
them idle, and waiting, they can be encouraged to add extra detail of their own choosing. That is 
the beauty of this type of lesson; it is open ended. Encourage the more advanced student to add 
the more complicated items.
Home work: 
Complete the drawing adding a painting on the wall, curtains, light on the ceiling, a chair or table ... 
etc.

perspective five -railway line
  
LESSON - PERSPECTIVE FIVE - WESTERN RAILWAY 
TIME: 
Allow 40min
Aim: 
To create a perspective grid using a single measurement and three vanishing points. This lesson is 
to consolidate and further the notion of perspective 'scale'. That is, as things of equal size recede 
they appear smaller. This time we will use the CVP and a familiar and logical structure, a railway 
line.
Materials: 
The sketch pad, 
HB pencil, ruler.
Construct margin and title box then:
a) Construct the same light lines as in stage a, b, c, d, of the previous lesson until we get the lines 
shown above.

b) This time we firm in the 'diagonals' which become railway line 'sleepers'. Notice here we use a 
more simplified method of construction.
c) Keep adding sleepers.

perspective five -railway line
d) After the student has completed the drawing to the stage above ask:
What shall we call the line that joins LVP, RVP and CVP? (answer 'horizon line').
How wide are railway tracks? (remember the old movies of people tied to railway lines? - answer 
about 5feet).
If the distance between the sleepers is 5 feet what is the distance between the second add fourth 
sleepers?
e) Add the extra light lines on the ground (two horizontal and three to the CVP). We are going to 
build a station about 30mm (1,1/4") from track 60mm wide.

perspective five -railway line
f) Add the vertical lines 50mm (2") high and join to CVP
g) Firm in the lines as shown and ask:
How high is the building? The student should measure the width of the tracks on the line directly 
opposite the front edge of the station and apply that 'scale' to the building's height. Objects an 
equal distance away from the 'observer' are subject to the same measurements of 'scale ' 
at that distance. In this drawing the scale is discovered by knowing the width of the track at that

h) Add the telegraph lines and poles and have the student determine their height and distance 
apart.
Clean up and print in the title as shown.
Encourage the advanced students to add three 12 foot cacti at various locations in the landscape.

LESSON - PERSPECTIVE SIX- ROOM INTERIOR (CVP) 
TIME: 
Allow 60-80min - this is a double lesson
Aim: 
To create a perspective grid using a single measurement and three vanishing points but vanishing 
toward the CVP. We will also introduce the freehand method of constructing curves.
Materials: 
The sketch pad, 
HB pencil, ruler.
Construct margin and title box then:
a) Measure intervals of 24mm (1") along the base margin as shown and join to RVP.

EXPLAIN :
The 'flat' surface is like a window or a sheet of glass. It is called a 'picture plane' (PP). The 
'observer', the person looking is standing a distance behind the PP and the floor is a particular 
distance in front of the PP.
At this point we need to interrupt our drawing to learn to draw circles. Since we have no 
tools to trace or guide us we will need to learn to draw these - freehand. We need to 
know this to complete our current project. So start a new sheet and ...

LESSON - PERSPECTIVE SIX- ROOM INTERIOR (CVP) 
TIME: 
Allow 60-80min - this is the second part of the double lesson
Aim: 
To introduce the freehand method and techinque for the construction of curves and use this to 
complete our room interior.
Materials: 
The sketch pad, 
HB pencil, ruler.
Construct margin and title box on a new page then:
a) Construct a 75mm (3") square as shown
http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/K9-14/draw_sixb.htm (1 von 7) [08.12.2002 12:39:13]

perspective six
b) Draw the diagonal a-b and without measurement divide into four equal parts. 
c) Draw a 45 degree tangent through the 3/4 division as shown and lightly sketch the freehand 
curve. The curve actually cuts the diagonal just below the three quarter mark and above the two 
thirds point. The students should be encouraged to draw the curve so it 'looks right.'

i) Draw a light rectangle around the portals to make a wall and firm in. Using light lines from the 
CVP draw the ceiling
Revise ask: What does PP stand for?
Home study : Find a picture or photograph form a magazine or elsewhere (it can be a seascape, 
landscape or whatever) where the horizin can placed in its right position on the CVP. Cut out and 
paste on the drawing as shown below. If the student so desires they can draw in a little scene 
themsleves.
I have used part of a 'masterpiece' by a well known, if slightly erratic and unreliable, individual.

Finally the students can shade the walls, add a painting or two, a side door, etc. The teacher will 
find it is useful to balance the dicipline of the method with the freedom to work within. Press here to

LESSON - PERSPECTIVE SEVEN - LETTERS 
TIME: Allow 40 min
Aim: To introduce the freehand method and techinque for the construction of curves and use this 
to complete a drawing. To introduce the notion that drawing and estimating proportion require 
judgements that need to be recoqnized, trusted and developed.
Materials: The sketch pad, HB pencil, ruler.
To Begin: (allow 10 min) (Preparation - download the first diagram below, print and make a 
copy for all students) Hand them out and ask:
a) Which is the longest edge in Fig 1 and why? (AD because it is closest - CA and AB recede)
b) What are the circumstances that would make CA=CB? (if the block was centerally positioned 
between the LVP and RVP)
c) Why is CA bigger than AB in Fig 2?
d) Measure all lines in Fig 2. Are any two the some size? (Discuss what we mean by real size or 
apparent size?)
e) Fig 3 does not look quite as 'square' as it should, why is that? (AB and CA are slightly to long 
making the block appear squatter than the others) 
We must learn to use our eyes and judge distances and proportions. We must keep 
drawing them until they look right. It is the same if drawing a face or a box for aways we 
must judge one thing in relation to all the others in the same space. The simplest object to 
practice and draw is the cube and we can use the cube to make many other shapes. If the cube is 
nearer the RVP AC will always be larger than AB while the reverse applies for the LVP.

Home study :
Shade the drawing and add another letter. There are thousands of variations of this drawing. The 
student could perhaps try and draw their own initials in the other direction, or using just the CVP on 
the ground. The more confident can try and draw a large 'S' for instance as homework or a specal 
project.

LESSON - PERSPECTIVE TEN - ARCHWAY 
TIME: 
Allow 80 min - best broken into two sessions with set homework in between.
Aim: 
To draw a Roman style triumphal arch utilising a freehand approach to drawing lines. This lessons 
eventual success will depend on the student eventually NOT drawing a straight line ... and thereby 
mot being terrified of making a mistake.
Materials: 
The sketch pad, 
HB pencil, ruler.
Construct margin and title box on a new page then:
b) Construct the rectangle and place a CVP in the approximate positions shown above.

c) Lightly draw the arch with the proportions to approximate those above.
d) Note the method used to position the back (inside curve) of the arch. The intersection point with 
the fornt curve is critical.

f) There are two walls indicated and lightly sketched in as above. You will see their complete form in 
the drawing shown next.

perspective ten
g) The student must now discard the ruler. All the firm lines must be done 'freehand'. Any ruled lines 
will look inconsistent and out of place. Use short firm strokes rather than trying to be too ambitious. 
This arch is supposed to be old and decaying therefore irregular lines are what is required. Now the 
arch and its surrounds should begin to take form.
h) Clean it up and add some shading.
http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/K9-14/draw_ten.htm (4 von 6) [08.12.2002 12:40:13]

i) The light source is to be from 'top right' so shade the raised frontal areas on the arch as shown ... 
shading to the right and below.
j) Add some 'Roman' letters (the detail is where observation and creativity interact) and shade some 
areas...
http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/K9-14/draw_ten.htm (5 von 6) [08.12.2002 12:40:13]

perspective ten
Note the shadows. At this juncture the shadows are merely 'parallel'. Since the drawing is not 
complicated regarding 'shadows' and the sun is very high and distant we can assume an almost 
parallel set of light 'rays'.
Homework: This particular arch is a minor detail in a painting by a well known artist who was 
born in Venice on October 18th. 1697. It appears in at least two of his paintings. The student to gain 
extra marks for naming the artist and even more for naming one of the paintings that contain the 
arch. Additional marks could be awarded if the student were to name the origin of the arch.

LESSON - TEN ... CONTINUED 
Aim: To reinforce the notion of 'logical size'. The size of objects being determined by introducing a 
familiar object at the same 'level' (a similar distance from the viewer). Then to complete the 
drawing started in the previous lesson.
The teacher should print off the following three drawings and hand them out as reference drawings. 
a) Here I have introduced 'the admiral' and put him in the arch. Suddenly the arch has a particular 
and definite size. Ask the students, why is that? 
From the moment a baby opens its eyes it begins keying-in shapes, with one of the first being the 
human face and body. Then it learns to recognise various other shapes in order of their importance. 
The child also learns to judge how far or how close is a particular object. Ask the class how this is 
done? 
You could mention that these common perceptions are what bind people together. There are, of 
course philosophical implications here concernig the commonality of experience ... but that is what 
drawing is all about!
Anyway, in the order of things human the body is a far more dominant form than any old archway.
This body of our 'Admiral Cowdisley Shovel' determines the size of the arch (how high is it here?) as 
we all know the avereage height of the human body, but, what if we shrink the poor old sailor?

b) Suddenly the arch has grown. How tall is it now?
c) OK so now I have multiplied the figures and drawn them forward. If we roughly draw lines 
through the Admiral's head and feet where would they meet?
It the person viewing this scene shorter ot taller than the 'Admiral'?
Let's go back to our unfinished drawing.

d) Note the detail lines suggesting the blockwork on the arch radiate out from the curve of the arc 
and then square. This is a tiny detail but one born of awareness. Ask the pupil about laying bricks 
that will form an arch, or the color of their front gate, or the size of a normal teacup. Test their 
awareness to common things and ask them to test you.
e) Using method in previous construct perspective 'grid' on the ground. Remember the firm lines 
are to be done freehand.

f) The pupil should be encouraged to decide on the design of the forecourt and individualise it as 
much as possible. Add some trees behind the wall to soften the starkness.

TIME: 
Allow 40 min (TEN MIN INTRODUCTION)
Aim: 
To understand the principle of multiple vanishing points and how they work in nature.
Materials: The sketch pad, HB pencil, ruler.
In this, the first part of this lesson the teacher will need to demonstrate the 
following on the chalkboard or pad ...
Alternatively, if the teacher deems necessary, these first six explanatory diagrams can be printed 
and handed out. However a quick demonstration on a chalkboard will give everyone confidence. 
The teacher could do this with just ten minutes of preparation ... OK, I know your time is valuable, 
and I must admit, I never prepared a lesson in my life. I just did it by sensing the needs of the 
student and seeing where that might lead ...
... in a classroom of thirty odd students that is called living on the edge. But then again I am easily 
bored; anyway, remember our railway line in a previous lesson?

Move the vanishing point along the horizon line to the right as above. Just use common judgement 
to place the sleepers ... as you might do in any grammar class.
Of course, as the line bends, it does with a 'curve'. Draw in the freehand curve as shown.

Next, we find a vanishing point 'above' the horizon! This will have the effect of making the line 
appear to rise up. See above.

d) Change direction and do the same thing again. Your own 'judgement' should be used to 
determine the 'new' width of the road. Logically it must be smaller than its width as it disappears 
over the first hill. Point out that this width will determine just how far the first hill is from the 
second.

Part Two - introduction
LESSON NOTES FOR TEACHERS - PART 2
LEARN HOW TO DRAW 
I sometimes refer to an individual as being visually 'literate'. We know 
the meaning of 'literate' and 'illiterate' regarding reading, 
comprehension and writing ... which I will refer to as the 'passive' 
(reading) and 'active' (writing) elements of being literate.
The ability to 'read' or understand a drawing is the passive part of 
visual literacy whereas the ability to actually 'draw' is the active 
element. 
   
Being 'visually' literate is no less important than being literate in the reading and writing sense. In 
fact, some may ever agree that 'drawing' should be studied alongside reading and writing. Why? 
Because before you can write you must learn to draw circles and squares, at least; otherwise how 
will we make a '3' or '7' ... and 'S' or an 'Z'?
So how does someone become visually literate? 
1. Passive By learning to recognize things in three dimensions, also learning to read maps and 
plans etc. in two dimeisions. Learning about line, texture, shape and pattern.
2. Active By learning to draw just as a writer would learn to compose sentences.
Drawing literacy can best be understood in the absence of language... and its effect can be quite 
potent. A test might be... 'Using the quickest, simplest drawing and the minimum number of lines 
you can imagine, draw as economically as you can any of the things on the following list: 
A house, caravan, dartboard, pineapple, road, a railway line, a fish a snake, an apple and 
a pear, a ship, boat, submarine, shark, martini, basketball, helmet, a pair of scissors, 
sword, spear, banana, cucumber, church, fruit tree, bunch of grapes, traffic lights, ladder, 
television antenna, lightbulb, scooter, mammoth, the road from your house to the nearest 
store, comb, fork, paperclip, saucepan, leaf, an anchor, shoe, yoyo, and a button etc.
   
NO AGE LIMITS: These tests could be given to children as young as five and adults as old as eighty 
and the results may well determine their 'active visual literacy'. There may somtimes also be little 
difference in the results. I would test for speed and inventiveness just as a you might judge some 
prose thus. Bear in mind the teacher need not be Leonardo or Rubens to satisfactorily judge the 
results!
Let's take this active and passive division little further. In what is 'art' today we have the visually 
semi-literate - in the 'active' sense; they may however, be quite visually literate in the passive 
sense. Should they be called 'artists' - and would we be as ready to embrace people who called 
themselves writers if they attempted to write of their experiences neglecting any structure? I don't 
think so; and some of my own writing proves just that! 
Is any of this important to the human species? The children I tested seemed to think so.... maybe 
http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/K9-14/part_two_intro.htm (1 von 2) [08.12.2002 12:41:30]

Part Two - introduction
such tests need to be given to some of our national art critics... I made a comment once ... when we 
talk of educating our children in 'the basics' we should mean the basics of reading, drawing, writing 
... and perhaps maths; but then I may be a little biased. 
Imagine beginning every art class with 'OK children, open your sketch pads and do two quick 
sketches; a coconut and a saw. You have three minutes..... then we will be finishing off the drawing 
we started last week.
Well this is exactly what we shall now be doing wilth our drawing course.

    PART 2: LESSON 1 - SETTING UP 
TIME: 
Allow 40min 
Aim: 
To establish a new format for freehand lessons and to introduce the 'quick sketch test' to enforce 
observation and awareness of common day things.
Materials: 
The sketch pad, HB and 4B pencil, eraser
Without using the ruler (or any other straight edge) prepare the page with 
margin and add the freehand boxes as shown. 
a) The student should draw the margin lightly (HB pencil), using short lines and when satisfied, firm 
it in. Allow a good ten minutes for this as some students will be concerned to produce lines of great 
excellence. This will not be possible at this stage and they could be told to expect as much. The 
student should be encouraged to keep turning the sketch pad to suit their hand movement, and to 
use the page edges as guides. 
b) When the student is satisfied with the light lines they can be 'firmed in' thus (again using short,

In the first two little spaces along the top the student is asked to draw their simplest representation 
of any two commonday objects of choice. They may make them up or use any of the examples listed 
http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/K9-14/part_two_setup.htm (3 von 5) [08.12.2002 12:41:42]

part two - freehand setup
on the previous page. It is recommended that the research (practice) for these be set as homework. 
Then the student will be forewarned and prepared - although any lack of preparation can lead to 
interesting times ...
At the completion of the time allowed for this task (can be shortened for future lessons) the student 
will ask his or her neighbour to guess and write down the names of the articles or objects. It they 
match the drawings they should remain unidentified (no need for any notation). If not recognized 
the student should identify them as shown below. The Teacher will be the final arbiter. Be kind!
This whole exercise should be treated as fun as the teacher will find the students serious enough and 
naturally competitive. Do not ridicule any effort yet be constructive where necessary. Praise the 
good and display the brilliant for the rest of the class to see. Simplicity and effectiveness are the 
keys. In the example above try and guess what the two unnamed objects are? You will see they are 
drawn with the maximum economy of line. That what we want from the student.

part two - freehand setup
The possibilities for set homework are manifold in these new set of lessons. Page preparation, 
common object research, completing drawings begun in class etc. Judge the pace according to 
student level and class preformance. 
If time remains in the 40min period the student could begin preparing future pages (light lines) with 
title boxes and freehand borders.

part two - shading
    PART 2: LESSON 2 - SHADING 
TIME: Allow 40min 
Aim: To begin the lesson on shading. This will encompas cross-hatching and other useful methods 
as well as noting the theory of shading generally.
Materials: The sketch pad, HB and 4B pencil, eraser
Allow five minutes to for the quick sketch 
test. Two minutes to do and three to mark. 
Swap, display and title if necessary.
CUPS a) Without using the ruler (or any other straight edge) prepare the page with margin and title 
boxes then: Make a light freehand sketch of a cup as shown below, then repeat this until four 
similar cups are made
http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/K9-14/part_two_shading.htm (1 von 5) [08.12.2002 12:41:59]

part two - shading
b) Using short strokes firm in cups.
c) Use the 4B pencil and medium pressure 'hatch' a series of parallel sloping lines as shown.
http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/K9-14/part_two_shading.htm (2 von 5) [08.12.2002 12:41:59]

part two - shading
d) Do the same, though with shorter lines, in the other direction. Next use some vertical lines and 
lastly some horizontal. This method of shading is called cross-hatching and is useful for quick 
renditions.
e) Make another row of four cups. 
http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/K9-14/part_two_shading.htm (3 von 5) [08.12.2002 12:41:59]

part two - shading
f) This time we will use a 'figure 8' as our shading method. You could use an 'O' or an 'S'. Use your 
4B pencil with a 'light weight' or light pressure and draw a series of '8's' as shown. As you near the 
darker edge of the cup the 8s can 'overlap' and get a little darker. Don't forget the top left 'mouth' 
of the cup as it too will need to be shaded.
g) Make another row of four cups. Again using your 4B pencil and 'light pressure' make a series of 
lines using cross hatch or '8's. With the end of your finger rub the pencil lines until they merge 
together and form a flat even 'smudge'. Try and stay within the edges of the cup. Repeat this and 
darken as you near the right hand edge of the cup. Again, do not neglect the top lip.

part two - shadows
    PART 2: LESSON 2 - SHADING 
TIME: Allow 40min 
Aim: To introduce reflected light and its effect on shadows and shading. To develop the use of 
shading for a textural effect. 
Materials: The sketch pad, HB and 4B pencil, eraser
Allow five minutes to for the quick sketch 
test. Two minutes to do and three to mark. 
Swap, display and title if necessary.
a) Without using the ruler (or any other straight edge) prepare the page with margin and add the 
freehand boxes as shown previously. 
While the students are thus occupied hand out these prepared theory sheets.
--------------------------------------------------------- 
Sitting in the garden I asked a person if the shadow cast by a tree would be lighter on a sunny day, 
than it would, at a similar time, on a cloudy day.
'Does it really matter?' he shrugged, as he poured himself another glass of my most expensive 
imported red.
'That depends.' I replied, 'one day you might want to paint a shadow.'
'The grisaille legacy' .......
'I met a man of black and white who had sadly lost his way. 
Wringing his hands, he said to me, "but all I see is grey".' 
http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/K9-14/part_two2_shadows.htm (1 von 5) [08.12.2002 12:42:13]

part two - shadows
If a cup was placed in a spotlight the shadow it cast would be as black as the surrounding darkenss 
while the shading on the cup should move from a grey at the 'turning point' to a similar blackness. 
However, if there was some other light in the room the 'black' shadow would look out of place - as 
shown above. The reason for this is that in our normal life we mostly don't live under spotlights. 
Usually, there are many sources of 'reflected' light around us. In a room or outside our shadows are 
rarely completely black as they are modified by the 'general lightness' of the day - or the room. 
Therefore a more 'realistic' rendition of shading and shadow would be as shown above. This can be

better understood by referring to my general lesson on side light and turning points in the 'painting' 
section.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
b) Lets now go back to our prepared sheet and our lesson for making a quick drawing of a tennis 
ball. 
Using the method we learnt in part 1 for making a freehand drawing of a large circle - draw one of 
the approximate size and position shown.
http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/K9-14/part_two2_shadows.htm (3 von 5) [08.12.2002 12:42:13]

part two - shadows
Employ the figure 8 and smudging method to shade the ball ( medium to light weight pressure) ... 
but leave the two 'S' shaped 'tracks' as shown. 
Increasing the pressure with your 4B pencil show some of the 'fluffy' hair at the turning point and at 
the edges. 
HOMEWORK
Find a golf ball, baseball, basket ball or one other and draw it along side the tennis ball. It is

part two - texture
    PART 2: REFERENCE SHEET ON TEXTURE 
TIME: reference sheet 
Aim: At this stage I thought it might be valuable to show how we can combine shading and texture 
in the one drawing. Later we shall be doing more work on this but for now it is sufficient to show the 
student what they will be able to do if they apply themselves to the lessons so far. All the 
techniques are already described. 
Scraperboard is a board made of a backing, a layer of compressed whiting/adhesive mix (approx 
1mm thick) then covered with a film of black indian ink. An incredibly fine white line is etched with a 
stylus as it is dragged across the surface. The flat edges of the stylus are sharpened and used to 
scrape larger areas clean of the ink. The boards can be bought already made as can the stylus and 
other tools for the scraping process.
In earlier days, when I was possessed by a steady hand and keen eyesight, I produced an exhibition 
of 28 scraperboard drawings of which the drawing below is but one example I have scanned from an 
old exhibition invitation cover.
Alas, none remain in my possession and I needed to search my records for the one shown to scan it 
and show it to you as an example of 'drawing with texture'.
http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/K9-14/part_two2_texture.htm (1 von 3) [08.12.2002 12:42:28]

part two - texture
I used little 'cyphers' or curves(below)for the wollen texture of the pullover(very similar to the furry 
tennis ball in the previous lesson) and straight lines (single hatching) for the skin texture. There 
was little opportunity for 'cross hatching in this drawing apart from the hair when a confused tangle 
is required.
http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/K9-14/part_two2_texture.htm (2 von 3) [08.12.2002 12:42:28]

part two - texture
You will note how the skin can be textured either along the folds, as in the forehead, or across the 
folds as in the nose and cheeks. This produces a 'dynamic tension' that can be used to emphasise 
roundness or flatness. For those students who decide to advance into painting it is useful to realize 
this same 'directional line' is the direction the painter would employ with the brush to give the 
human body appropiate 'dynamic tension'.
Full size approx 10" by 12" in private ownership(heaven knows where it is now for, at the time, it 
was purchased by a restaurant owner for $300 and free meals whenever I was desperately hungry, 
which was quite often in those days!)

PART 2: LESSON - 3D DRAWING 
TIME: Allow 40min 
Aim:To introduce a the basis of three dimensional drawing and 
apply to drawing. 
Materials; The sketch pad, HB and 4B pencil, eraser, a ruler if 
need be. 
Allow five minutes to for the quick sketch test. Two minutes to do and three 
to mark. Swap, display and title if necessary. 
Draw a little butterfly on your page in approximately the same position as mine. 
But where exactly is the butterfly? How far from us, how high above the ground? We have no idea 
until we 'place' our butterfly. To do that we shall put her in a (reference) box or cage. See below ... 
http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/K9-14/part_two_space.htm (1 von 3) [08.12.2002 12:42:34]

part two - space
Now we have our reference and we can relate the position of the butterfly to something tangible, 
specific. Furthermore if we draw a line 'forward' from our butterfly we can decide where we want our 
butterfly in relation to the front of our box (point 'a')
In a similar fashion if we project a vertical line up from our butterfly we can relate the butterfly to 
the top of our box (point 'b'). But how far up? Since the butterfly is in a set place then point 'b' can 
be joined by the vertical projection and by the projected line to the left vanishing point. It is as if we 
sliced through our box and the 'plane' of that slice suddenly cut through the middle of our butterfly. 
http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/K9-14/part_two_space.htm (2 von 3) [08.12.2002 12:42:34]

part two - space
Do this again and locate the butterfly on point 'c' the left hand front surface. Such is the method we 
can obtain the 'three dimensions' that locate our butterfly in space. Of course we needed to 
'reference' the butterfly within a box. Now we have our 'three dimensions'. The bigger butterfly I 
have introduced is much closer and can be related to the first in a similar manner.

Allow five minutes to for the quick sketch test. Two minutes to do and three 
to mark. Swap, display and title if necessary. 
Mostly everything we draw is based on regular solids such as cubes, spheres, cylinders and 
pryramids ... or a combination of them all. In this lesson we shall be using a sphere, a half-pyramid 
and a cylinder.

PART 2: LESSON - PORTRAITURE 2 
TIME: Allow 40min 
Aim:To study draw a portratit using the 'inside-out' method. 
Materials: The sketch pad, HB and 4B pencil, eraser, a ruler if 
need be. 
Allow five minutes to for the quick sketch test. Two minutes to do and three 
to mark. Swap, display and title if necessary. 
Using your eraser make the small highlights in the eyes that give them their sparkle. The amount of 
'sparkle' should differ from one eye to the other. Sometimes you would 'sparkle' one eye only as the 
other might be in shade. Careful observation is the key. 
You can suggest some eyelashes at this stage. Next we will construct the pyramid that will give us 
our 'design' for our nose. All you will need to do in the future is to remember these basic structures 
when doing your portraits.

http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/K9-14/part_two_portrait2.htm
The 'length' of the nose will obviously differ between individuals ... but not too much. The distance 
between the eyes will often vary slightly as well but once you know the approximate distances as I 
have given you you can make the minor adjustments yourself.
With a little shading and careful edges on the base of the nose you will be able to suggest the shape. 
Try not to include too many details at this stage. Next we will look at the lips ...

Lips are best visualized as part of a cylinder as they 'wrap around' the face. Here I have dawn the 
'classic' shape with mouth closed. Using similar proportions construct your own as shown below.
Now add a little bit of shading and complete your drawing as shown.

part two - roses
    PART 2: LESSON - DRAWING A ROSE 
TIME: 
Allow 40min 
Aim: 
This is a project that has two parts. Part one, in this section, is learning to draw a rose and part two 
is in the general lesson section on making the drawing into a painting.
Materials; 
The sketch pad, HB and 4B pencil, eraser.
In addition each student will need a single rose ... either have the student obtain one in preparation 
or the teacher might decide to provide them in which case one per every two students will be 
sufficient. 
Allow five minutes to for the quick sketch test. Two minutes to do and three 
to mark. Swap, display and title if necessary. 
You will need five sheets for this lesson but have the student prepare them as they need them. 
Next have all the students examine the petals on their rose. They should take particular interest in 
the outside drooping petals where they will observe the following shapes. These they will draw as I 
have demonstrated below but with their own variations.
http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/K9-14/part_two_roses.htm (1 von 4) [08.12.2002 12:43:25]

part two - roses
You will note that roses generally have five petals ... inside five petals - inside five petals etc. The 
petals are offset so that the outside petals don't line up with the adjacent row inside and so on and 
so forth. Therefore on the next sheet lightly draw a pentagon (five sided figure) as shown in Fig.1. 
You may use a circle if you like to be more accurate.
Nick the corners as I have shown in Fig.2
Put a vee in the flat sides of the pentagon as this will define the extent of the petals. Fig.3.
Firm in the outline as in Fig.4. as well as defining the petals and the center of the rose. You should 
now begin to understand the basic structure of the rose as seen from in front.
Complete and label the sheet. 
On a new sheet draw the rose as I have done taking particular care to vary the edges of the petals 
as you discovered in your drawing sheet No.1. Though the structure (pentagon)remains the same 
the outline gets varied as the petals fold over on themselves hence we get the irregular outline as in 
Fig.5.
In Fig.6 we will draw the classic 'bell shape' of the internal section of the rose as viewed from side 
on.
Fig.7 shows the 'bell shape' inserted into the outside petals.
Fig. 8 will be your sketch of the 'rosebud.' Label all these drawings and title the sheet.
http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/K9-14/part_two_roses.htm (2 von 4) [08.12.2002 12:43:25]

part two - roses
On the next sheet (below) we will draw the front view of the rose from the 'inside' out. 
Begin with the center as I have in Fig 1 and carefully construct your petals around it getting bigger 
as they spread out. Shade the deep parts of the petals as I have done until you have the complete 
'reference sheet' similar to mine.
For our final reference sheet we will be drawing the petal again and forming it into side on views of 
the rose in semi and full bloom. Note the classic 'bell' shape and just concentrate on assemblying all 
the petals. You will note you will only just see the tips of the inside petals though they will mostly 
appear flat on top as they curl over. They get smaller and stick up more as they get toward the

part two - roses
center of the rose.
Please note the other 'parts' of the rose and add them as I have. Complete as shown above ... and 
add the title. 
HOMEWORK
Observe and practice until you are comfortable drawing the rose from any angle. Try drawing it 
from the back!
For those students wishing to see how such a drawing can be converted into an oil painting 
depicting a vase of roses go to painting roses in the advanced lesson section.

PAINTING RED ROSES
This lesson is a continuation of the drawing lesson on roses that you should view before 
attempting your own painting.
I have done the painting in four stages and will attempt describe each stage as they are shown 
below. The student should try and complete this painting in one session as it is essentially a 
'wet in wet' project that relies on the fluidity of the paint.
First of all I covered a primed canvas (16" x 13") in a 'thin' mix of raw umber. Technically this is 
usually referred to as a 'imprimatura'. When I say 'thin' I mean a mix diluted with turps that 
spreads like watercolor and dries very quickly. When almost dry I use chalk to draw in the 
design. For this classic or formal design I place my imaginary 'horizon' about one third up from 
the bottom and then center the vase. If you prefer you could use charcoal for the drawing. 
 
With the drawing complete I begin painting the centers and shadows in the roses. For this I use 
'cadmium red deep' with perhaps a toutch of the umber or burnt umber in the very centers. 
Next you should really load up a half to three quarter inch flat bristle brush with 'cadmium red' 
and begin to paint between the cadmium red deep with broad singular strokes that will 
represent the foremost of the petals (see below). Note that your brushstrokes should become a 
little thinner ... use the edge of your bristle brush for this ... as the petals near the center of the 
flower. 
http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/advanced/roses3.htm (1 of 4)1/13/2004 3:32:35 AM

roses3
For the leaves I use a mix of ultramarine blue and yellow ochre. Liven this up with some strokes 
of deep red. Shadows should never be bland. Where the light strikes some of the leaves you 
might want to bring them up with a little cadmium yellow and a blue/white mix (see the green 
highlights above). 
Next I would like you to consider the 'negative' space. That is what I call most of the area 
around the roses, in this case the background, the foreground and the cast shadow. Here you 
http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/advanced/roses3.htm (2 of 4)1/13/2004 3:32:35 AM

roses3
might mix up a mauve with your cadmium red and ultramarine blue lightened with white and 
again load up your brush and begin 'cutting in' the outline of the particular blooms that interact 
with the background.Use a medium if your paint is too dry. It should be creamy and fluid so you 
will need to recharge your brush after every three or four strokes. You can do a similar thing 
with the foreground with a mix of raw sienna and white. Spend some time and thought doing 
this 'cutting in' and if a shape does not appeal rub it off with a rag and try again. Try an achieve 
a balance between shapes using more one stroke 'concave' shapes for the rose blooms in 
outline.
DANGER ... do not overwork the brush strokes otherwise the painting will lose its freedom and 
immediacy. If the hues begin to look too garish you can always tone them down by adding a 
little raw umber. 
Finally you will be left with the water filled glass bowl. This is nothing but a mirror for what 
surrounds it. Basically you should 'smear the bowl' with all the adjacent colors as I have done 
and when this looks satisfactory use the chisel-edge of a bristle brush to show some of the rose 
stems as they are seen through the glass. Add a little 'white' highlight to the glass. Such 
highlights are best with titanium white/naples yellow mix which gives a better 'glow' than just 
pure white.

Illlusion and photo-realism
3-1 CLASSIC ILLUSION AND PHOTO-REALISM
 
Here we will examine the notion that good paintings can be 
made by simply copying photographs. To do this we shall 
return to the latter half of the last century when 
photography was all the rage and the great debate of the 
time was whether photography should confine itself to 
science or also develop as an art form. The perceived 
danger to painter's incomes was what spawned the 
impressionsists who believed representational art was 
doomed. Meanwhile it gave the academy painters something 
to think about - rather like the late 1980's when the 
champions of computer technology predicted the demise of 
newspapers and books. It seems they too were a little 
premature as trees seem in more danger now than then. 
There is little doubt that Monet,Van Gough, Renoir, Cezanne 
and others were artists of innovation and that the 'academy' 
painters such as Bouguereau and Gerome, after Ingre 
departed this mortal coil, were the next masters of the 
classic western art technique. I call such painters as 
Bouguereau and Waterhouse the painter's painters as they 
combine advanced technique with subtelty to the extent you 
almost forget the painting is merely a two dimensional 
illusion. In the fervent battle to maintain a presence against 
photography it was unfortunate the impressionists were 
pitted against the academy artists for a shrinking art 
market. While the impressionists mostly turned to landscape 
the academy artists concentrated even more on developing 
a more subtle techniques for figurative and portrait painting.

Illlusion and photo-realism
Iian Neil writes:
'Certainly Bouguereau does have a certain Romantic flavour to his works, but by and large he 
did not work in the style of Delacroix, David-Freidrich, or Gericault, to name a few exponents of 
that style. When I look at Bouguereau's work, the overwhelming impression I receive is of 
Classical polish and perfection, its potential severity softened with aspects of Romanticism. 
One must understand that by describing Bouguereau's work as Photo-Idealism one risks 
classing him amongst those who merely copied photgraphs. Most critics probably do not realize 
that Bouguereau, like many of the great "academic" painters, did not rely very heavily on 
photographs at all -- Bouguereau, like Pietro Annigoni half a century later, preferred to work 
from life. The fact that his paintings are so extraordinarily verisimilutudinous is due to his 
enormous technical ability, and not to a slavish attitude towards representing reality 
"photgraphically". 
    Iian's drawing 
After all, why should we declare Bouguereau to be "photographic"? Is it true that the only 
*real* reality is to be found in photographs? - that is obviously utter nonsense! The only reality 
to be found is in reality itself. Bouguereau did not set out to imitate photos, although it is 
possible he may have spurred himself ever onwards out of the sheer delight of pushing his skills 
to the limit; nevertheless, he wasn't a parasite or a mediocrity -- he painted from REALITY and 
not from a faded recreation of reality. After all ... can not the eye capture more of the world's 
beauty than the photo? Can we not perceive the beauty of movement, the subtleties of colour, 
and so forth, whereas our cameras struggle to be able to even take adequate photos in poorly 
lit conditions? We humans don't need to spend hours in the developing room just to see what is 
out there -- Bouguereau did not need to seek the Truth through photos -- the Truth was already 
out there.

Illlusion and photo-realism
Now, returning to my initial classification of Bouguereau as a "Clasical-Illusionist". It is not my 
intention to suggest at all that he was an imitator of (or slave to) the camera; I have merely 
latched on here to the term most familiar to us to describe a representation of reality which is 
extraordinarily life-like. Bewarned, though - never mistake Bouguereau's supreme illusionistic 
skill for a barrenness of invention or a servitude to the minutae (which implies the 
*irrelevancies*) of reality. Bouguereau stands prominently in the long line of Illustionists who 
made magic out of the mundane, who distilled the Beauty out of Truth, and who feeds our eyes 
and our souls on a feast of life-affirming verdor. 
Emphasizing the "academism" of the non-Impressionist painters is to do them a disservice. 
These people didn't just execute works for the state, the Second Empire or whatever. To 
declare that their 'style' marks them as oppressors of the Impressionists or enemies of "true 
art" is to make a grave error in judging their importance in art history. 
Therefore, I object to them being described as "Pompiers" -- I understand that the terms 
"baroque" and "rococo" also previously had a negative connotation, but if we are try and 
ressurect the reputations of men like Gerome, Bouguereau and Meissonier, why should we 
make our task thrice as difficult by referring to them in what we have all acknowledged is a 
derogatory term? It may be that in the future the term "Pompier art" can be applied with 
equanimity and fairness by some generation of art historians -- but at the present we would be 
playing right into their hands by asserting (quite falsely) that Bouguereau and Gerome were 
merely academics or pedagogues'. 
STUDENT ACTIVITY:Use the library or the internet to make a list of 8 impressionist artists of 
1890 and a list of 15 academy artists of the same period. Include any Orientalists and the Pre-

1-1 THE MAGIC OF PAINTING - INTRODUCTION 
'Give me some paint, brushes and canvas and I will give you gold, silver, ruby and pearl. I will 
give you the greatest treasures you have ever seen. I will show you magic. Artists are the 
greatest alchemists, the best magicians of all. They can make gold from base metals, they can 
make you laugh and cry and touch your very soul, and they do that every day - and more ... JH 
from the 'Modern Illusionists'. 
The Magician - A following story will explain how these disciplines can interact and why the 
word illusionist applies to the master painter as well as the best magicians. Early this century a 
magician was sent to North Africa to quell a rebellion. He came on stage with a large wooden 
chest which he placed in the center and asked for the strongest man in the audience to step up. 
After some coaxing a warrior champion, a lumbering ox of a man was propelled up on stage. 
The magician told him not to fear but to lift up the simple wooden chest. This the man did this 
with consummate ease. 
Next the magician told the audience he would steal the giant’s strength and render him as weak 
as a kitten. He clicked his fingers and asked the man again to try and lift the chest. Now the 
strongman strained and pulled but could not move the wooden chest, even an inch, and finally 
gave up. To prove he had taken away the man’s power the magician asked his assistant, a 
slightly formed young boy, to prove he could lift the chest - which he did.
There was much consternation which the magician stilled by suddenly announcing he could 
restore the former strongman's strength. Then after asking the audience if that was what they 
wanted, and with another click of the fingers, he did. Finally, upon ordering the strongman to 
lift the chest for a third time the man raised it with his former ease. 
The chiefs gasped and the rebellion was quelled for who could oppose such power? 
Of course a steel plate in the bottom of the chest and an early electro-magnet under the stage 
was the simple cause of the phenomenon. But what is important is the story. It was the 
magician's manipulation of the minds of the audience that was the real magic. That is the art of 
the illusionist. Not the trick. It is the same with a painting or a play. A good painting will make 
you believe what you are seeing has a reality in time and space even though you know it is an 
illusion, merely a picture on a wall. 
The Application - The techniques of painting silk and satin, gold and silver or diamonds and 
rubies or anything else for that matter requires the artist to embrace the same three disciplines 
the magician uses in my story. 
1. The artist must understand the nature of the objects or things he or she desires to paint. Just 
as the magician needed to understand certain principles of electro-magnetism the artist also 
must be a scientist. To create the illusion of gold or chrome the artist must know something of 
its molecular or crystalline structure, something of light and refraction. In other words some 
elementary physics and chemistry. 
2. The artist must be philosopher enough to ask and answer questions regarding the nature of 
things in their ideal from - a conceptual analysis if you like. The artist must understand how 
people feel about the things he or she desires to paint. For the magician in my story it was his 
understanding of people’s feelings and their views and prejudices regarding a man’s physical 
http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/advanced/intro.htm (1 of 3)1/13/2004 3:33:29 AM

Advanced lessons - introduction
strength that was the key. The concept and knowledge of how people feel about something was 
- and is - essential for illusion to succeed. 
3. Whereas the magician needs the skill and discipline of the actor, performer so the artists 
must similarly have the ability to control the painting in the totality of its parts. The artist needs 
to be creative and know how best to construct and present his two dimensional painting as a 
three dimensional illusion. The artist will need to know and apply the techniques that painters 
use create form and depth (chiaroscuro and perspective). 
To summarise then: we have the technical analysis, the conceptual analysis and the 
presentation technique. When we understand these things about an object or subject we can 
then paint it. 
Many will recall the pearl necklace I made from 
scratch in a previous lesson - so now let us use 
that to demonstrate the study necessary to 
preform the task. Please understand that in this 
exercise painting without form and depth will 
produce merely a pale imitation, a sad flat thing 
that takes us back to kindergarten. 
Technical analysis - the physical nature of a pearl.
The pearl's technical characteristics fall under four main headings;
a) Shape - various spherical - round, oval, tetrahedron with no sharp 
edges.
b) Texture - hard-edge satin, non-oxidising
c) Color - the whole visible spectrum with an underlying milky yellow-
orange to blue-grey. Pacific island pearls are yellow orange while 
artificial Japanese blue -grey.
d) Reflective ability - partially diffuses the light rays with its semi-
opaque non -crystalline surface.
Conceptual analysis - The pearl as it exists in the mind of most is 
usually round, glowing diffused and organic. It's most esteemed color is 
underlying gold. The pearl is natural and feels benevolent against the 
skin.
Presentation technique - To take advantage of the pearl's reflective 
nature I decided to place it in a situation where there was something to 
reflect. In this case in front of a window on a red table in a brown room 
with a blue ceiling and an observer between the window and the pearl.
A string of pearls is more believable than a single. Use a rich, soft 
background (prussian blue) that exaggerates the pale, glowing diffused 
nature of the pearl. That satisfies the form and the depth (perspective) 
is internal in the reflection. 
STUDENT ACTIVITY: Painting the pearls:
1) Paint miniature scene as above in a wet medium and allow paint to diffuse.
2) Glaze in a semi-transparent mix of white, with a little red and yellow.
3) While still wet introduce the faintest touches of as many colors of the spectrum you like.

4) Sharpen the outside edges. Allow 40min. 
The greatest illusion of all could be the illusion you never notice. The greatest magic 
could well be the magic you are never know. A retired spy once said to me ... 'You 
know, not all magicians wear capes and wave sparkling wands.'

PRINCIPLES OF VISUAL REALITY
       The greatest art is that which moves the viewer in a positive way, which touches perhaps dormant 
sensibilities inherent in human nature, and awakens and/or fortifies man's better qualities in so doing. 
Great performances in all the arts accomplish this same goal. A well-written operatic aria, for example, 
sung brilliantly and with feeling by a virtuoso soprano, can move an audience profoundly, raising the hair 
on the neck and bringing tears to the eyes, leaving at least some of them gasping and choking back sobs of 
deeply felt emotion as they try to maintain their composure . Experiencing such profound appreciation for 
a masterly performance leaves one forever changed for the better. It cannot do otherwise. Great Literature 
provides many comparable experiences. In painting, it is possible to achieve the same thing. 
Great Literature provides many 
comparable experiences. In 
painting, it is possible to 
achieve the same thing. The 
reader is referred to 
Rembrandt's "Judas Returning 
the Thirty Pieces of Silver" for 
an excellent example. The 
depth of Judas' remorseful 
anguish is compellingly 
conveyed by his body language 
as well as his facial expression, 
and the viewer cannot help but 
be deeply moved upon viewing 
it.
      Compassion and sympathy are called forth as the audience feels the anguish of the subject, so 
eloquently is it expressed in the painting. Compassion , empathy, sympathy; these are all aspects of man's 
better nature. To change people for the better—what more noble purpose could an artist be called upon to 
fulfill? To what higher calling could we aspire?
       In each of the examples presented above, the means by which the experience is made possible is

virtuoso performance in an artistic endeavor by a Master of the discipline employed. Whereas the focus of 
the performance itself is to make the audience feel whatever the artist wants it to feel, it must be stressed 
that the objective can only be successfully attained through a thorough understanding of every aspect of 
the art form involved, including the psychological effects produced by each possibility. There is a 
language to be learned, and mastered, before any great performance is remotely possible. In literature, the 
language is verbal; in music, it is music theory. In visual art, it is a thorough understanding of the 
Principles of Visual Reality, coupled with heightened aesthetic sensibility and mastery of drawing and 
painting techniques. Why the Principles of Visual Reality? Because we live in a world of realistic images. 
We relate to realistic imagery. We even dream in realistic imagery. Of all the visual possibilities available 
to a painter, the only way to move our viewers to the utmost is to employ realistic imagery in our work. 
We may depict things which are not real, but if we render them in accordance with the Principles of 
Visual Reality, they will read as if they were real, and thus will be able to exert maximum impact on the 
viewer. It is the language by which we express whatever it is we wish to express, and which our viewers 
will be able to read and comprehend on the receiving end. Our messages cannot communicate if we speak 
in a language comprehensible only to ourselves. Thus we must use a language common to everyone who 
can see. Realistic imagery is that language.
       The Principles of Visual Reality are established by the way our vision works. The further one 
deviates from these principles, the less the work in question will resemble visual reality. In creating the 
illusion of reality, the artist depends heavily on the indication of the third dimension, which is depth, or 
spatial recession. Spatial recession is indicated by observing the principles of Geometric Perspective, 
Atmospheric Perspective and Selective Focus. 
GEOMETRIC PERSPECTIVE
      Geometric perspective, often referred to as simply perspective, may be defined as the natural law 
which says the further something is from our eyes, the smaller its image will be. Since there are two types 
of perspective, the other being atmospheric perspective, it is necessary to distinguish between them by 
referring to what is normally called perspective as geometric perspective, in reference to the fact that it is 
a geometric breakdown of a natural optical phenomenon. It is sometimes referred to as linear perspective, 
as it involves the use of lines in its construction. As simple as it sounds, the problem of how to 
convincingly render this visual phenomenon had baffled painters for centuries, until a mathematical 
approach was discovered in the early Renaissance. The painters Masaccio and Uccello, as well as the 
architect Bruneleschi have each been credited with its discovery. The Roman architect Vitruvius may 
actually have preceded all of the others named, and may in turn have been influenced in it by someone 
still earlier, but the discovery does not seem to have reached painters until the early Renaissance. 
Whichever of these attributions is correct is less important than the fact that the discovery was made, and 
that it constituted a major breakthrough in illusionistic painting. Once artists learned the system, they 
could indicate spatial recession more realistically than had previously been possible. The system involves 
the use of vanishing points; points at which lines intended to depict parallel lines converge. These 
vanishing points are on the horizon if the lines are level. It is important to note that the horizon is always 
at the viewer's eye level. When two or more vanishing points are necessary, as in all but the simplest 
perspective problems, their placement may be worked out following the mathematical system, or, if we 
are working from life, by simply copying the angles we see and extending them to the horizon. The points 
at which the extended lines cross the horizon are the Vanishing Points. All lines parallel to the one used to 
establish the Vanishing Point will converge at that Vanishing Point. If there is any question as to their 
accuracy, the mathematical system may then be employed to double-check. The mathematical approach 
must be learned first, and practiced until a point is reached whereby the artist is able to visualize the scene 
in correct perspective automatically, without the need of actually drawing in the vanishing points and 
guide lines. The subject is taught to students of architecture, but is not part of the curriculum of fine arts 
programs in most universities at the time of this writing. It may be that a Fine Arts major could take it as 
an elective. There are several books on the subject, the best of which are listed in the bibliography. 
However one chooses to study, whether alone, in an institution, or with a private instructor, the 
http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/advanced/chapter5.htm (2 of 8)1/13/2004 3:33:53 AM

The Oil Painter's Bible - chapter 5 
importance of mastering geometric perspective cannot be stressed too highly. It is imperative that any 
serious aspiring artist absorb this fundamental principle completely, if he or she is to ever create 
genuinely Great Art. It must become second nature, so thoroughly assimilated that virtually no effort is 
required to visualize it correctly. As the subject is so completely covered in Rex Vicat Cole's book, 
Perspective for Artists, there is little point in addressing it in full detail in this book. 
       Errors in perspective are far too common in modern times. Such an error immediately destroys the 
illusion of spatial recession, and prevents the viewer from receiving the artist's message. 
In the simplest exercises in perspective, one 
Vanishing Point only is used, and may be 
placed arbitrarily, on the Horizon. A straight 
road on absolutely level ground may be 
indicated by drawing lines from points on 
each side of the road to the Vanishing Point 
on the horizon, where they converge. Suppose 
we want to add a line of telephone poles, or 
fence posts, running parallel to the road and 
placed at regular intervals. The spaces 
between them must diminish as greater 
distance from the viewer's eye is indicated. 
The interval between the nearest pole and the 
second pole is established arbitrarily by the 
artist. The placement of the base of the third 
pole may be determined by drawing a 
guideline from the top of the first pole 
through the center of the second pole, and 
extending it until it intersects the line running 
from the base of the first pole to the 
Vanishing Point.
      A vertical line drawn from the point thus established becomes the third pole. Its height is found by 
drawing a line from the top of the first pole to the Vanishing Point. The fourth pole is located by drawing 
a line from the top of the second pole through the center of the third pole and extending it to the line 
connecting the base of the first pole with the Vanishing Point, and so on. This example is quite simple, 
and should serve only as an introduction to the geometrical system of indicating three-dimensional depth 
on a two-dimensional surface. Refer to the insets and accompanying illustrations for solutions to some of 
the more complex perspective problems.
      The system is not quite perfect, as it fails to take into account the curvature of the Earth. It works well 
because the Earth is so large that in most cases the curvature is not apparent. Its limitations are that it can 
become quite complicated, and artists are generally not mathematicians, nor are they likely to be 
interested in approaching the scene from such an analytical, as opposed to intuitive, standpoint. For this 
reason, many artists, or would-be artists, are weak in their understanding of this fundamental principle. It 
is imperative that the student, the aspiring artist, apply the discipline necessary to learn the mathematics of 
the system so well that all awkwardness with its application disappears and ceases to interfere with the 
creative, intuitive processes so essential to art. Once it is committed to second nature, it becomes a help 
rather than a hindrance. The artist should then be able to "eyeball" the scene accurately, without having to 
actually draw the vanishing points and guide lines. Its parallel in music would be the learning of music 
theory; perhaps no fun at first, but Great Music cannot be created without it. 
ATMOSPHERIC PERSPECTIVE
http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/advanced/chapter5.htm (3 of 8)1/13/2004 3:33:53 AM

The Oil Painter's Bible - chapter 5 
 
      As objects recede in space they not only appear to shrink in size, but tend to lose detail, contrast of 
values, intensity of color, and their edges appear less distinct the greater the distance from the viewer's 
eyes. This is the principle of Atmospheric Perspective. Some writers call it "aerial perspective," but this is 
misleading, as the term, "aerial" usually pertains to flying. 
The visual alteration of images over 
distance is the direct result of "X" 
amount of atmosphere between the 
eye and the object or plane in view. 
The atmosphere contains water vapor 
and its own density, which renders it 
somewhat less than totally 
transparent, adding a certain degree 
of whiteness to the air. Light renders 
the atmosphere white. The more air 
we must look through to view 
something, the more atmosphere we 
see between it and our eyes, and the 
more the image is altered by it.
An optical illusion is created by the 
presence of a semitransparent white 
between the eye and any color darker 
than white, which alters the color in 
question in the direction of blue, as 
well as lightening the value. This is 
precisely why the sky appears to be 
blue. The sky's blue is created by the 
blackness of space being viewed 
through a layer of semitransparent 
white atmosphere. The white is the 
atmosphere illuminated by the sun. 
At night, without the sun's light, the atmosphere is no longer white, and the blackness of space becomes 
visible. Note that the sky is always lightest just above the horizon. This is the greatest distance we can see 
at ground level, which is where the atmosphere contains the most (white) water vapor and the greatest 
density. At the horizon, the density of the atmosphere renders it more opaque, and thus, whiter. As we 
look up, we look through thinner air, which is less opaque, and the sky is bluer and darker. This is why 
distant objects and planes appear lighter, bluer, and less distinct. The same phenomenon can be produced 
with paint. The process is called scumbling and is accomplished by applying a thin veil of white paint 
semitransparently over a layer of (dry) darker paint. The optical result in paint is the same as in the air. 
Translucent white over black reads bluish, just as light grey smoke against dark trees reads blue. Note that 
the same smoke may appear to be brown when a white cloud is behind it, a reverse of the scumble 
phenomenon. Dark over light increases apparent warmth. This is the principle at work in glazing, that is, 
the application of darker transparent paint over a lighter passage. Glazing and scumbling are discussed at 
length in Chapter Six and Chapter Ten.
       In painting, atmospheric perspective can be rendered directly, in one step, using opaque paint 
http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/advanced/chapter5.htm (4 of 8)1/13/2004 3:33:53 AM

The Oil Painter's Bible - chapter 5 
exclusively, at least in the distance and middle ground, following the principle, by adding white, and 
sometimes blue, increasing the white (and blue) to indicate greater distance, softening edges by working 
wet paint into wet paint, suppressing detail and diminishing contrast between light and shadow to indicate 
greater distance. The effect can also be gotten, perhaps slightly more convincingly, in a two-stage process 
whereby the same procedure is used as in the one-step method except that the area of greatest distance is 
rendered very slightly darker than the desired final effect. The illusion is completed in the second step by 
scumbling a thin film of white or light grey over the dried paint of the first step in the areas of the greatest 
distance. The illusion of depth can be further enhanced by painting the deepest foreground shadows, and 
only these foreground shadows, in transparent glazes over a relatively lighter underpainting or primer. 
This creates the highest degree of clarity, as would be the case when the least amount of atmosphere is 
present between the shadow and the viewer's eye, appropriate for the immediate foreground only. The 
combined, systematic use of glazing, scumbling, and opaque painting allows the painter to create the 
illusion of depth to the highest degree possible. However, the successful rendering of spatial recession 
depends even more heavily on observance of the principles of geometric and atmospheric perspective than 
it does on expert paint handling. 
SELECTIVE FOCUS
      There is a third principle to be observed when creating the illusion of reality, which is closely aligned 
with atmospheric perspective. This is the Principle of Selective Focus. It is the phenomenon whereby our 
eyes, directed by the brain, register the highest attention to detail on whatever we consider most important 
within our cone of vision. Please note that this process is unique to the natural viewing apparatus. A 
camera does not operate in the same way. The specific differences will be discussed at length in the 
chapter on photography. In designing our painting, we must simplify the shapes of lesser importance and 
render them in softer focus than the areas of primary importance. Hard edges should be used sparingly, 
and for specific reasons. The use of too many sharp edges destroys the illusion of reality, as it does not 
correspond to visual experience. Our eyes cannot focus on more than one small area at a time. Everything 
else appears duller and less distinct. By following this principle, the artist can assign greater importance to 
key elements in the picture by rendering them in sharper focus and adding more detail, and can arrange 
things in such a way as to lead the eye from point to point, including areas of secondary and tertiary 
interest, if desired, to hold the viewer's attention for as long as possible. Areas of secondary and tertiary 
importance may also be rendered in sharp focus, but must be made less noticeable than the primary 
subject by their positioning on the picture plane and by arranging things in such a way as to have less 
contrast of values, lower chroma colors, or whatever other means will render them less noticeable at a 
distance. Orchestrated in this way, they do not compete with the area of primary importance for the 
viewer's attention. The main focal point is emphasized not only by sharper focus, but by greater contrast 
of light and dark, by higher chroma color, perhaps by its juxtaposition with contrasting hue accents, and 
especially by its strategic placement on the canvas. Other elements in the picture may also point toward it. 
Thus are the elements of secondary and tertiary interest rendered subordinate, even though they may be 
rendered in sharp focus in certain instances. Their effectiveness, however, depends on softer focus being 
used over most of the picture. If one had to choose between painting everything sharp, or everything soft, 
the soft option would allow for a more convincing illusion of reality. We all, at times, see everything in 
soft focus, as it takes a certain amount of effort and direction from the brain to focus the eyes on anything. 
It is not possible, however, to see everything in sharp focus at once; thus, a view painted in such a way 
clashes with our experiences in viewing the real world. It is easy to fall into the trap of painting this way, 
for as we move our focus from what we have just painted to what we will paint next, each element 
appears to us in sharp focus. The temptation to paint it as sharply as we see it when focusing on it is very 
strong, but must be resisted, or we violate the Principle of Selective Focus, and the illusion of reality of 
the overall scene will be compromised for the sake of superfluous detail. It is helpful to squint when 
observing these elements, thereby throwing the eye somewhat out of focus, and then paint them as they 
appear when squinting. If the painting requires a sharper focus on certain parts of the scene, it is still 
advisable to begin by squinting, in order to read the larger, more general shapes, and then add whatever

detail is desired after we are certain that the big shapes are correct. 
We must not lose sight of 
how our picture will appear 
to its viewers at first glance. 
It must register upon their 
sense of sight just as the 
scene itself would, or they 
will not be drawn in to look 
at it more closely, and will 
never see to appreciate the 
fine work we may have put 
into the details. A picture 
must be designed to work as 
a visual whole. It must be 
more than a collection of 
details assembled at random. 
Elements of lesser 
importance should be 
simplified, lest they confuse 
the viewer as to what the 
subject, or focal point, of the 
picture is. If the focal point is 
rendered in sharper focus, 
and subordinate areas in 
softer focus and simplified, 
confusion is avoided. 
This follows precisely the manner in which we view a scene with our own eyes. To see something in 
sharp focus, the brain must direct the muscles within both eyes to simultaneously adjust their respective 
lenses to focus on that object, and the muscles guiding the position of each eye to allow them to converge 
on that same object or surface. This involves a certain degree of effort, thus this action is only triggered 
by the brain when it deems something of sufficient importance to warrant it. Therefore, by rendering a 
given object or surface in our painting more sharply, we are indicating to the viewer that this particular 
thing is important. Thus the term, "Selective Focus."
       As artists, we should not just paint what we see, we should paint what we want to show to our 
audience, selecting only that which is worthy of such special attention, and then presenting it as it appears 
at its most appealing, or making it more so if it will make a better picture. The viewer's attention is 
directed where we want it by the use of selective focus. If the visions we paint exist only in our 
imaginations, so much the better.
By understanding the Principles of Visual Reality, one can render imaginary scenes convincingly real, and 
perhaps transcend even the limitations of working from life. This is the mark of a Master. This level of 
ability can only be attained by working from life until the Principles of Visual Reality are thoroughly 
absorbed. There is no short cut.
THE NATURE OF LIGHT
http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/advanced/chapter5.htm (6 of 8)1/13/2004 3:33:53 AM

The Oil Painter's Bible - chapter 5 
       Of equal importance to the principles governing spatial recession is an understanding of the nature of 
light and shadow. Three-dimensional form is indicated by the distribution of light. Shadow is, in theory, 
the absence of light, but in reality there is light in shadow as well. Areas of light are generally illuminated 
by light rays which have traveled in a straight line from the strongest source, whereas shadows receive 
their light indirectly, as the rays ricochet off nearby surfaces and bounce in behind objects that block the 
direct rays, or from secondary light sources weaker and/or farther away than the primary light source. 
Without secondary light, shadows would read as black. The dark side of the moon is an example. 
Secondary light is what enables us to perceive form within the shadows. 
       The shadow is darkest at the just beyond the planes illuminated by the primary (strongest) light 
source. This area is called the shadow accent (sometimes referred to as the core shadow) of the body 
shadow. The phenomenon of the shadow accent is best understood in scientific terms. Whenever enough 
light is present to allow us to see at all, there are light rays coming from many directions, of varying 
strengths, both reflected and direct, often from more than one source. The strongest light creates what we 
consider light and middletone areas, whereas the weaker are only visible in shadow. Whatever is blocking 
the strongest light also blocks a certain amount of secondary light, and the closer the shadow is to the 
blocking obstacle, the more of the secondary light rays are blocked. 
A good analogy is to suppose we are standing under an awning or umbrella in the rain. Our head stays 
dry, being closer to the awning, umbrella or whatever is blocking the rain. Further down, some rain may 
reach us, where there is greater distance between a given surface and the awning. If we substitute light 
rays for rain, it becomes apparent why the shadow accent is darker than the rest of the shadow. Less light 
means more dark. Beyond the shadow accent, more reflected or secondary light is allowed to enter the 
shadow area, reflecting off nearby objects or planes, or from secondary (weaker) sources, as the distance 
from the light-blocking obstacle increases. This light is commonly called reflected light in shadow, 
although it often includes direct light from weaker or more distant sources as well. Perhaps a more 
technically correct term would be secondary light. So the shadow accent, also known as the core shadow, 
is most simply described as the zone of shadow between the primary light and the secondary light.
       The shadow accent is a most useful device for describing interior planes, that is, planes within the 
edges of the object being depicted, by its shape and by how sharply it makes the transition from 
middletone to shadow. A sharp change in angle will have a sharp transition; a more rounded form would 
have a softer transition from middletone to shadow. Once the artist understands this principle, he or she 
will look for the shadow accent, and will use it to good advantage.
       The cast shadow follows the same principle as the body shadow (the shadow on the unlit side of the 
object in question), in that it is darkest at the edge nearest whatever is blocking the light. Its edge is also 
sharpest at that point, and softens as it recedes from there, due to reflected light from surrounding planes 
or from secondary sources. The middletone is the area on the lighted side which is far enough from the 
angle of incidence of the light rays to our eyes that the body color of the object is least altered by the light. 
Thus the color of a given surface is seen at its highest chroma, or intensity, somewhere in the middletone. 
This is explained in greater detail in the chapter on color.
       The highlight is the point at which the light from the primary light source bounces off the object and 
to our eyes the most directly. It will contain more of the color of the light source than any other area in the 
light. The highlight will describe the surface texture of the object being viewed, by the degree of 
sharpness at its edge, and by the contrast between its value and the value of the middletone. There will be 
a transition zone between highlight and middletone. The extent of this transition zone, again, depends on 
the texture and shape of the surface, and on the intensity of the light from the source, striking at the 
highlight. It is necessary at this point to address the way in which color is affected in the shadow areas. 
Shadows are areas where the direct light rays from the strongest source cannot reach. If there were but 
one source of light, and no surfaces nearby to reflect light back into those areas, the shadows would be 
totally dark, and we could not read shapes within them. However, situations such as that are rare, except 
in outer space. In reality, there is usually more than one light source, and/or nearby surfaces which reflect 
http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/advanced/chapter5.htm (7 of 8)1/13/2004 3:33:53 AM

The Oil Painter's Bible - chapter 5 
light into shadow areas. The color of the secondary light source affects the color of the shadows. The 
color of nearby surfaces, which reflect light into shadows, is also cast into the shadows as an inseparable 
component of the reflected light. The body color of the shadowed surface is also an influence; however, 
its chroma will be lower (duller) than in the middletone for the same reason that its value is lower 
(darker). The reason is that there is not enough light in the shadow to reveal the body color at its full 
intensity.
       The strongest influence on the color in shadow is usually the color of a secondary light source. The 
best example is an outdoor scene on a sunny day. The main light source is direct sun, which is slightly 
yellowish. The secondary light source is the sky, which is blue. The color of the sky will be the strongest 
color influence, other than the body color of each surface, in all areas facing it not lit by direct sunlight. 
The sun's rays, striking directly, are so much stronger than the light of the secondary source (the sky) as to 
effectively overcome the color influence of the sky in those areas, replacing it in the highlights with its 
own color plus white. In other words, direct sunlight "eats" the blue. When a cloud obscures the sun, the 
sky becomes the primary light source, and its color, blue, becomes an influence in the lighted areas, until 
the cloud moves away and allows the direct rays of the sun to again eat the blue. All areas then in shadow 
retain the blue influence of the sky, except where the light from the sky cannot reach. In those areas, 
reflected color will have a stronger influence. For example, the underside of an object surrounded by a 
green lawn will register a certain amount of green in the shadow areas, whereas the upward-facing areas 
in shadow will register the blue of the sky. The green is carried with the light from the sun as it bounces 
off the lawn, reflecting into nearby surfaces. If the object has no color of its own, such as a white or grey 
statue, this will be more apparent. If the object has its own body color, it will be influenced by the color of 
the secondary light, but not replaced by it.
       After the student has been exposed to these principles, they will become more obvious, as he or she 
will be on the lookout for them. This is an important step toward becoming an artist. Once the Principles 
of Visual Reality are completely understood, the artist is freed from dependence on external sources. 
Nothing the imagination can conjure up will be beyond the artist's ability to depict on canvas. This in 
itself is still no guarantee, however, that an artist so equipped will be a Master, as he or she must also have 
something of interest to say. Inspiration is an individual thing that cannot be taught. One finds inspiration 
on one's own. However, all the inspiration in the world will not help, if the inspired person lacks the 
vocabulary to express it. An understanding of the Principles of Visual Reality is an extremely important 
part of that vocabulary.

KISSING PRACTICE - A DEMONSTRATION PAINTING
'REALISM DEFINED'
One of the most difficult painting tasks it that of actually painting realistic flesh. Nowhere was this 
excelled but by the French Academy painters of the late nineteenth century or their counterparts 
across the channel such as Leighton, Waterhouse and Alma-Tadema. Perhaps the most sublime of 
all these was William Bouguereau whose paintings of people were so convincing it becomes most 
difficult to distinguish them as mere images. More than anyone Bouguereau made angels as real as 
the peasant girls he painted as pot-boilers for the more fashionable commercial market. 
Bouguereau is the professional painter's benchmark for technical perfection in the rendering of 
flesh.
So how did he do it?
In this lesson I shall demonstrate a technique and provide a brief explanation of how he achieved 
such results.

picture. To further amplify the drama I shall eventually create within this background the 
three definite distances, far, middle-ground and fore-ground. One of the secrets of creating 
a super-realism is to allow the eye to be able to comprehend all distances at once. Of course 
this cannot be accomplished by a camera or by the eye without refocusing.

The Oil Painter's Bible - chapter 6
 
THE OIL PAINTER'S BIBLE - CHAPTER 6
Master Class - advanced oil painting principles and techniques 
from the Renaissance to the present
by Virgil Elliott, APSC, ASPA 
TECHNIQUES OF PAINTING IN OILS
From the earliest days of oil painting to the time of this writing (late Twentieth Century, into the early 
Twenty-first), a number of oil painting techniques have evolved. 
A great deal has been learned through 
the processes of trial and error and from 
the experiments of various artists 
through the centuries. From Jan and 
Hubert Van Eyck, possibly the first 
innovators to paint pictures in oils, in 
the late Fourteenth and early Fifteenth 
Century, to William Bouguereau, Jean 
Léon Gérôme, Alexandre Cabanel, 
Jehan-Georges Vibert and the other 
French Academic painters in the late 
Nineteenth Century, technical 
knowledge developed more or less 
continuously, as artists of each 
generation added their discoveries to 
what their predecessors had learned. 
The continuity was interrupted around the end of the Nineteenth Century as a result of the popularity of 
the Impressionists, who were viewed as a rebellion against the academic style of painting. The emotional 
reaction to the Impressionists' emergence resulted in a total rejection of the Academy and all it stood for, 
to the detriment of art instruction throughout the Twentieth Century. The techniques taught at the 
Academy and the ateliers of the Academics represented the culmination of at least five hundred years of 
more or less continuous development in representational drawing and painting, dating back to the early 
Renaissance. This wealth of knowledge included many of the discoveries of the Old Masters, yet it was 
http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/advanced/chapter6.htm (1 of 11)1/13/2004 3:34:38 AM

The Oil Painter's Bible - chapter 6
suddenly regarded as "old fashioned," “passé,” etc., and therefore of no further interest. Technical 
development essentially ceased at that point. Fortunately, a few of the dedicated students of the 
Academics carried on in obscurity, and passed what they had been taught on to their students.
      There was also enough written documentation of the older techniques to enable this author, and a few 
other similarly obsessed individuals, to gain some understanding of what was involved, undaunted by the 
best efforts of several universities' art departments to discourage the pursuit of this knowledge. These 
written clues made possible a more thorough reading of the paintings themselves, sought out in museums 
across Europe and the United States over many years. Conservation scientists have also been able to 
provide a considerable amount of extremely valuable information previously only guessed at, which has 
helped to unravel the mysteries of the past, as technological advances and ongoing scientific inquiry 
continue to provide an ever-sounder base of knowledge from which to operate. Only after considerable 
practice in painting (below) can one fully understand what is there to be read in the paintings of the Great 
Masters and in the books which attempt to explain the techniques (including this one).
The hope is that this book will prove a little less cryptic (and more accurate) than the old manuscripts 
which the author was compelled to seek out and decipher in his own quest for knowledge. It is further 
hoped that it will find its way into the hands of others sharing the same obsession, and help to reestablish 
a link with the Great Art of earlier times. 
THE FLEMISH TECHNIQUE
      The earliest oil painting method evolved from the earlier discipline of egg tempera painting, as an 
attempt to overcome the difficulties and limitations inherent in that medium. As this took place initially in 
Flanders, the method is referred to as the Flemish Technique. Essential to this method of painting are a 
rigid surface primed pure white, and a very precise line drawing. The Flemish painted on wood panels 
primed with a glue chalk ground, which caused the transparent passages to glow with warmth from 
beneath the surface of the paint. As this method did not easily accommodate corrections once the painting

The Oil Painter's Bible - chapter 6
was under way, it was necessary to work out the idea for the picture with studies done on separate 
surfaces.
       The completed drawing was then transferred to the white panel by perforating the "cartoon", or a 
tracing of it, along its lines, then positioning it over the panel and slapping it with a pounce bag, or sock 
filled with charcoal dust. The stencil was then removed, and the drawing finished freehand. Another 
method for the transfer was to cover one side of a piece of tracing paper with charcoal, or with a thin layer 
of pigment and varnish or oil, which was then allowed to become tacky, and use it as one might use 
carbon paper. Once the drawing was transferred to the primed panel and completed, its lines were gone 
over with ink or very thin paint, either egg tempera, distemper (glue tempera), watercolor or oil, applied 
with a pen or small, pointed, sable brush, and allowed to dry. The drawing was then isolated, and the 
absorbency of the gesso sealed, by a layer of varnish. Sometimes a transparent toner was added to this 
layer of varnish, which was then called an imprimatura. The tone of the imprimatura set the key for the 
painting, making the harmonization of the colors easier, and allowing for more accurate judgment of 
values. A field of white primer tends to make everything applied to it appear darker than it is, until the 
white is completely covered, at which time the darks are sometimes seen to be too light. And when the 
darks are too light, generally the rest of the tones are too light as well. By toning the isolating varnish (a 
warm tone was most commonly used), to a tone somewhat darker than white, this problem could be 
avoided or minimized.
       Once the isolating varnish or imprimatura was dry, painting commenced with the application of 
transparent glazes for the shadows. The paints used by the early Flemish practitioners were powdered 
pigments ground in walnut or linseed oil. There is widespread speculation regarding whether other 
ingredients, such as resins, balsams, and/or various polymerized oils were added, and the issue is not yet 
resolved as of this writing. All opinions on this subject must be understood to be guesswork until 
scientific analyses have been completed on enough paintings from this era to settle the issue. It is likely, 
though not definitely established, that the brushing characteristics of the paints might have been altered to 
a long molecular configuration by the addition of boiled or sun-thickened oils, and possibly balsams such 
as Strasbourg Turpentine or Venice Turpentine, and/or resins. Strasbourg Turpentine, sap from the firs 
growing in and around what is today Alsace Lorraine and elsewhere in Europe, is similar to Venice 
Turpentine but clearer and faster drying. Balsams and polymerized oils add an enamel like consistency to 
oil paint, changing its structure to a long molecular configuration. Long paint is easier to control than 
short paint, especially with soft hair brushes on a smooth painting surface, as in the Flemish Technique. 
Brushes used by the early Flemish oil painters were primarily soft hair rounds. Some were pointed at the 
tip; some were rounded, and some flat. Hog-bristle brushes were also used for certain purposes, such as 
scrubbing the paint on in thin layers for glazing and other effects. Painting commenced with the laying in 
of shadows and other dark shapes with transparent paint. In this method, the painting is carried as far 
along as possible while the paint is wet, but is usually not finished in one sitting. Large areas of color are 
applied after the shadows are laid in, and worked together at the edges. These middletone colors may be 
either transparent, opaque, or somewhere in between, depending on the artist's preference. The highlights 
are added last, and are always opaque. Several subsequent overpaintings may be applied after the initial 
coat is dry, if desired. Some Flemish artists also employed an underpainting of egg tempera, or egg oil 
emulsion paint, to help establish the forms before painting over them in oils. 
       The Flemish method, in summary, consists of transparent shadows and opaque highlights, over a 
precise line drawing, on wood panels primed pure white. The painting medium may possibly contain a 
resin and/or balsam, which increases clarity and gloss, or a combination of a polymerized oil with a raw 
oil, which takes on the most desirable characteristics of a resin when used together (i.e., sun-thickened 
linseed or walnut oil, plus raw linseed or walnut oil, mixed together), without the defects of natural resins. 
The innovations are the use of oil paint and the technique of glazing with transparent color. A glossy 
varnish is applied at least six months after completion. Paintings are generally limited to smaller sizes, 
due to the difficulties involved in constructing, priming, and transporting wooden panels of greater 
dimensions. It had its limitations, but was a vast improvement over egg tempera, both in ease of execution 
and in the beauty of the final result. 
       Although it originated in Flanders, word quickly spread of the marvels of oil painting, and it was 
soon adopted by the German artist Albrecht Dürer, who is known to have traveled to Flanders and to Italy, 
http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/advanced/chapter6.htm (3 of 11)1/13/2004 3:34:38 AM

The Oil Painter's Bible - chapter 6
and by Antonello da Messina, who studied in Flanders, according to Vasari. Giovanni Bellini then learned 
it from Antonello, and taught it to Giorgione and Titian. The Flemish painter Rogier van der Weyden, 
who was adept at painting in oils, came to Italy around 1449 and influenced a number of Italian artists, 
including Piero della Francesca. The use of oil as a painting medium was adopted cautiously by some, and 
derided by others, as anything new always seems to create controversy. Michelangelo refused to paint in 
oils, and reportedly ridiculed Leonardo for adopting it. Titian (Tiziano Vecellio) recognized its merits, 
and soon added several innovations of his own. 
THE VENETIAN TECHNIQUE
       Titian and Giorgione are generally credited with originating what became known as the Venetian 
Method of oil painting. The Venetian Method, or Venetian Technique, shares with the Flemish Method 
the use of transparent glazes for the shadows, darker darks and for certain special effects, and opaque 
highlights, but differs from the Flemish method in several important ways.
       The method evolved out of necessity, as the church desired large paintings of religious scenes for 
cathedrals, and wealthy dukes wished to adorn their palaces with large paintings of mythological themes 
and other subjects. The difficulties of constructing and transporting huge wooden panels influenced artists 
to seek an alternative. Canvas was soon adopted as the most convenient support for large paintings, as it 
could be rolled up and delivered, then reattached to the stretcher frame, or another of the same 
dimensions, at the painting’s destination and hung. However, the rough texture of the cloth created a need 
for certain adjustments in technique and perhaps in the chemistry of the paints. A new primer was also 
needed, as gesso (gypsum bound with animal glue) and glue/chalk grounds are brittle, and thus unsuitable 
for use on a flexible support. After years of experimentation, involving the addition of oil or honey to 
gesso to render it more flexible, white lead ground in linseed oil became the accepted primer for canvas. 
The canvas was first given an application of weak glue sizing to render it nonabsorbent, as the linseed oil 
would have otherwise caused the canvas to rot. The glue sealed the absorbency of the canvas and 
excluded the oil from the linen or hemp fibers. 
The gloss inherent in paints formulated for the Flemish Method was found to be objectionable for large 
paintings, and Titian seems to have made adjustments to produce a less reflective surface. It is likely he 
eschewed the use of polymerized oils, balsams and resins, all of which increase gloss, and opted instead 
for simpler paints ground in raw oil only. Thus the paint would have been of a short molecular 
configuration, rather than the (presumably) long paints of the Flemish. It was found that stiff, hog bristle 
brushes worked better with the short paint and rough textured canvas.
       The combination of large, stiff brushes, short paint, and the tooth of the canvas made the painting of 
hard edges more difficult. Sharp edges occur quite naturally in the Flemish Technique, with its smooth 
surface, long paint and soft hair brushes, whereas the stiff brushes and short paint produced soft edges as a 
normal result on a coarse textured canvas. Titian (or perhaps Giorgione, who died young), however, 
apparently found the softer edges more to his liking, and used them extensively, as they gave the effect of 
being slightly out of focus. The edges could be sharpened selectively, where desired, to call the viewer's 
attention to an area of greater importance, or to describe an object whose edges were actually sharp, such 
as a starched collar, sword, or piece of paper or parchment, or they could be left soft in the interest of 
Selective Focus.
       The systematic use of soft and hard edges together gave the paintings a more lifelike appearance, and 
more closely approximated the visual experience than did the overall use of hard edges, as had been the 
previous practice. Titian was perhaps not quite as accomplished a draftsman as Michelangelo, who is said 
to have criticized him for it, so he devised a technique which allowed him greater latitude for corrections. 
This technique involved the use of an opaque underpainting, with the edges left soft and nebulous to allow 
for later adjustments where necessary. Once the forms were established to the artist's satisfaction, he 
would allow the underpainting to dry, while he worked on other paintings. When dry, the underpainting 
could then be painted over in color, beginning with the transparent glazes for the shadow areas, as in the 
Flemish Technique, and developed further with opaque passages representing the areas of light.
       In the Venetian Technique, color is often applied over the underpainting initially as transparent 
http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/advanced/chapter6.htm (4 of 11)1/13/2004 3:34:38 AM

The Oil Painter's Bible - chapter 6
glazes, which are then worked into, while wet, with opaque pigments. The paint is worked together wet 
into wet until the desired effect is achieved, or until the paint becomes slightly tacky, at which time it is 
allowed to dry thoroughly. This process may be repeated as many times as necessary.
       At some point, someone, perhaps Titian, discovered that a light, opaque tone, rendered 
semitransparent by the addition of a bit more oil and/or simply by scrubbing it on thinly with a stiff brush, 
applied over a darker area produced an effect that could be put to good use. This is what we now call a 
scumble. It was found that a scumble over a flesh tone would produce the same effect as powder on a 
woman's face; that is, it made its texture appear softer. This is a useful device when painting women and 
young people of both sexes. It is also useful for indicating atmospheric density over distance, or 
atmospheric perspective. See Chapter Five, Principles of Visual Reality. Both glazing and scumbling 
create optical illusions. As such they effectively expand the capabilities of the limited palette of the early 
painters in oil. It was imperative that they get the most out of the materials they had.
       Glazing is the application of a darker transparent paint over a lighter area. The optical illusion created 
by the light rays’ having passed through a transparent darker layer, bouncing off the lighter surface 
underneath, then traveling back through the transparent layer to the viewer’s eyes, is unique to glazing, 
and cannot be obtained in any other manner. A warm glow is created, and the color thus produced appears 
warmer and more saturated (higher in chroma) than the same pigment applied more thickly and opaquely. 
The effect, in the darker passages, is that of a shadow seen up close, with no atmosphere between the 
viewer’s eyes and itself. The rich, golden glow in Rembrandt's dark browns is produced in this way. 
Rembrandt was influenced by Titian, and is reported to have at one time owned at least one of his 
paintings. Glazed darks appear darker than opaque darks, because the light rays are allowed to penetrate 
more deeply into the paint layer, and are thus subjected to a great deal of filtration before reflecting back 
out to the viewer’s eyes. This effectively expands the value range possible with paints, which are 
handicapped on the light end of the spectrum by the fact that white paint is not as light as light in Nature. 
The Old Masters compensated by carrying their darks as far as they could, to create as wide a range of 
values as possible. This can only be accommodated through the use of transparent paints on the dark 
extreme. Furthermore, as light contains color, the artist must make the highlights darker than white in 
order to include color in them. This further limits the value range, and makes necessary the darkening of 
all tones by a corresponding amount in order to maintain the proper contrast and relationships between 
each category of light or shadow. Transparent darks allow the expansion of the dark end of the range.
       Scumbling is the opposite of glazing. A scumble uses a lighter opaque paint, spread thinly enough so 
as to become translucent, over a darker passage. The optical effect thus produced is bluer than the paint 
applied, as the underlying layer is not completely obscured, and exerts its influence on the overall 
sensation, as has been previously described. It is very effective in softening surface textures, as soft cloth, 
such as velvet or cotton, or youthful complexions, the surface of a peach, etc., and, as mentioned, for 
indicating atmospheric haze over distant land planes and in the sky near the horizon. Overcast skies may 
be scumbled all over, as in Bouguereau’s “The Broken Pitcher.”
       There are still more advanced and sophisticated developments of the Venetian Technique. The 
"semiglaze", which can be either transparent or semiopaque, or anywhere in between, is a very thin 
application of color to an area of the same value as the paint being applied. Its purpose is to modify the 
color of a given area after that area is dry, as in the addition of a tiny bit of vermilion to a cheek or nose, 
and/or to allow subsequent wet into wet painting over an area in which the paint has dried. It tends to 
soften unintended too-harsh transitions of tone from the previous sitting, if used properly, and thereby 
adds a higher degree of refinement to the image. It is applied thinly, by scrubbing it on with a stiff brush, 
after the addition of a small amount of oil or a painting medium to lubricate the dry surface of the area to 
be repainted. Titian is reported to have sometimes applied glazes and semiglazes with his fingers, or 
perhaps he was wiping the excess away after having put too much on with a brush. Stippling with a flat 
tipped brush is a good technique for applying glazes, scumbles, and semiglazes, though other means work 
very well in skilled hands. As a further development of the Venetian Technique, the underpainting, or 
certain parts of it, may be executed in opaque color, rather than totally in neutral greys. One popular 
variation was Venetian Red and Flake White. The underpainting palette should be limited to lean paints 
(paints with low oil absorption) which are opaque and/or very high in tinting strength. High tinting 
strength fat paints (paints with high oil absorption) may be used if mixed in very small quantities with

very lean paints like Flake White. The objective is to keep the underpainting leaner than the layers applied 
over it. When dry, the color may then be subsequently modified with glazes, scumbles, and semiglazes, or 
painted over with opaque color. These steps may be repeated as many times as necessary. The highlights 
are placed last, applied wet into wet with a fully loaded brush. Impasto is often employed in the 
highlights, to produce the most opaque passages possible, and to ensure that they remain opaque. Oil 
paints become more transparent with age. Therefore, in order for the highlights to retain their opacity over 
the centuries, they must be applied heavily. The illusion thus created is that of direct light falling on a 
solid surface, ricocheting from that surface to our eyes. It is not actually an illusion, as that is exactly what 
is happening. Juxtaposed with the transparent shadows, the illusion of depth is thus enhanced.
       The underpainting, sometimes referred to as a grisaille if done in greys, should have its darkest 
passages painted somewhat lighter than the desired final effect, or the superimposed colors will lose much 
of their brightness and depth . Except for certain special effects, as in the technique of Rembrandt, the 
texture of the underpainting should be as smooth as possible. Any brushstrokes not smoothed out before 
the underpainting is dry, or scraped down before painting over, will produce a problem area in the next 
stage. Artists who prefer visible brushstrokes should decide where to place them in the final stages of the 
painting, as accents.
       The Venetian Technique allows the widest range of possibilities of any oil painting method yet 
developed. Its systematic use of opaque passages, glazes, scumbles and semiglazes stretches the 
capabilities of oil paint to the absolute limits, and allows the artist the greatest latitude for adjusting the 
picture at any stage. The employment of the optical illusions created by glazing and scumbling, combined 
with the control of edges (selective focus), enables the oil painter who has mastered it to indicate three 
dimensional reality more convincingly than is possible with any other technique.
       Among the Old Masters who used the Venetian Technique in one variant or another were Rembrandt, 
Franz Hals, Nicholas Poussin, Jacques Louis David, Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, Jean Léon Gérôme, 
and many other great Masters whose names are not well known today.
       It should be stressed that the wonderful results achieved by the Old Masters and other great painters 
were attributable, in great measure, to the preparations undertaken prior to their beginning work on the 
final canvas or panel. The concept for the painting had first to be worked out in smaller drawings, 
sketches and studies done on separate surfaces, to solve all the problems to the artist's satisfaction 
beforehand. This accounts for the impression most often conveyed by their paintings, of having been 
executed without the necessity of corrections. In truth, there were many corrections, but the major ones, at 
least, were most often solved in the study stage before the painting itself was touched. For very large 
paintings, the usual practice was for the Master to paint the painting first on a smaller scale to work out its 
composition, and then turn it over to his apprentices to be transferred to the large canvas by means of a 
grid. Refer to the sidebar for a more detailed description of the grid method of enlarging a design. In some 
cases, the smaller painting was done without color, to be used by the apprentices as a guide in applying 
the underpainting to the large canvas, which process the Master would oversee, and usually correct and 
complete after the students and/or apprentices had done most of the work. Often many supplemental 
studies were drawn and painted by the Master, either to aid the assistants in painting the large picture, or 
to solve some of the problems for himself, in the development of the concept for the painting. This 
practice is as much a factor in the excellent quality of the works these great painters produced as were the 
actual painting techniques they used so well. 
DIRECT PAINTING
      The Direct Painting Method differs from the Venetian Technique and the Flemish Technique in that 
the artist paints in full color from the very beginning, without requiring an elaborate under drawing or 
underpainting, and without resorting to the use of glazes or scumbles. All paints except the deepest darks 
are used as if they were opaque, and are usually applied heavily enough as to appear so. The object, 
ideally, is to paint the entire picture wet into wet, from start to finish. Terms such as Alla Prima (Italian) 
or Premier Coup (French) are sometimes used for this technique, indicating that the picture is to consist of 
one layer of paint, applied all at once, in one sitting. In practice, this is not always possible, and great

The Oil Painter's Bible - chapter 6
pains must then be taken to nonetheless make it appear as if it were done alla prima.
       The Old Masters employed this technique for sketches only, to be used as visual aids in the creation 
of larger works executed following the Venetian method or a variant. Franz Hals was the first painter to 
use direct painting for other than sketches, although the works for which he is famous today may still 
arguably be called sketches. Hals was proficient in the Venetian Technique as well, and used it for his 
commissioned portraits. The Direct Painting technique was elevated to legitimacy in the Nineteenth 
Century by Carolus Duran, the teacher of John Singer Sargent, and then by Sargent himself, among 
others, most notably Anders Zorn, Cecelia Beaux, and Joachin Sorolla y Bastida.
       The range of effects possible with Direct Painting was once much narrower than with the Venetian 
Technique, but today's wider selection of pigments has expanded its possibilities considerably over what 
was available in earlier times. The invention of the cadmium pigments and synthetic ultramarine in the 
Nineteenth Century made Direct Painting a more viable alternative to the Venetian Technique.
       Individual approaches vary greatly. Some prefer to begin in charcoal, with a few quick guidelines 
sketched freehand on the canvas before beginning to paint, while others choose to begin immediately with 
the brush, and sketch in the shapes initially with thin paint indicating the shadow masses. Some painters 
tone the canvas beforehand with a very thin transparent imprimatura, to "kill the white", which might 
otherwise influence them to paint their darks too light a value, and some prefer to paint directly on the 
white canvas. Others tint the primer to a value darker than white by adding paint or pigment to the final 
coat of primer to make an opaque tone somewhat darker than white.
       A toned ground or imprimatura makes judgment of values a bit easier. Painting on an opaque primer 
darker than a value seven on the Munsell scale will make the superimposed colors duller, however, and 
will cause the painting to darken in time. It is better to use a white primer, and add a transparent tone over 
it to lower the value initially, or add a light opaque tone over the white primer. A transparent toner can be 
painted into immediately, or allowed to dry before commencing. With the latter practice, care must be 
taken to avoid violating the "fat over lean" rule.
       As with the Flemish and Venetian methods, darks should be applied first, and thinly. The reason for 
this is that the shapes are indicated reasonably well with just the dark shapes and shadows, and corrections 
may be made without excessive paint buildup by simply wiping out mistakes with a rag. The early stages 
are most likely to require correction of shapes, so it is prudent to begin thinly. This also allows a certain 
degree of transparence in the shadows, which is desirable. Oil paint is most easily controlled by painting 
wet into wet, from dark to light, systematically. As the reader has surely discovered at one time or 
another, to attempt to indicate a shape haphazardly, beginning with a middletone or light color soon 
results in a sea of wet paint into which everything disappears as soon as it is applied. This is called mud. 
The mud experience has discouraged many would be oil painters over the years. It is simple enough to 
avoid, if one proceeds methodically, following a logical progression. It is advisable to begin with a very 
large brush, and block in the large general shadow and other dark shapes first, correcting any mistakes by 
wiping with cheesecloth, used as an eraser, before adding a second color. The large color shapes in the 
middletones and lighter shadows should then be blocked in, using another large brush. One may then 
work back into the shadows and add secondary light, reflected color, and shadow accents, then return to 
the middletones and add refinements there, saving the lighter areas and finer details for last.
The lights should be painted more thickly than the darks. Large brushes cover more canvas in a given 
time, hold more paint, and allow the artist to paint much faster. The use of small brushes and the addition 
of detail should be forestalled as long as possible. Many agreeable effects can be created through expert 
use of a large brush, especially in areas in which one might be tempted to switch to a smaller one. Facility 
in this style of painting is developed by the execution of studies painted from life. As they are only 
studies, there is no pressure to create a masterpiece, and the student is free to experiment. After a bit of 
practice, the studies become more and more accurate, as the student's ability to perceive value and color is 
developed to a higher degree, and the initial awkwardness with the brushes and paints is overcome. It is 
helpful to isolate value in one's first attempts in oils, by working only with white and greys made with 
Ivory Black and white. Once the student is past the struggling with the paint stage and has learned to 
understand values, color may be introduced a little at a time, at first adding only Yellow Ochre (or Raw 
Sienna) and Red Ochre , for use in color sketches of the human head from life. With this palette it is 
possible to mix what appears to be a full range of colors. It is only effective in paintings with an overall 
http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/advanced/chapter6.htm (7 of 11)1/13/2004 3:34:38 AM

The Oil Painter's Bible - chapter 6
warm tonality, in which context greys made with Ivory Black and white appear to be blue. Greens are 
made from yellow and black, or yellow, black, and white, and violets are mixed from black and red, or 
black, red, and white. An automatic unity is thus achieved, as the cool colors produced in these mixtures 
are low in chroma, and cannot disrupt the harmony of the warm dominance. The palette is then expanded 
gradually, as the student becomes familiar with the limited palette, by the addition of Burnt Sienna, Raw 
Umber, and Cadmium Red, Light. At the appropriate point, Ultramarine Blue is added, and so on, so that 
no lesson overwhelms the student with too much to learn at once.
       It must be stressed repeatedly during the early sketch sessions in oils that only the big shapes should 
be painted, and large brushes used exclusively. No detail should be attempted until the student is able to 
judge the correct value, color, shape, and relative proportions of the large shapes of shadow and light 
accurately. By then, the powers of observation will have been developed highly enough that the rendering 
of detail will be easier, and, hopefully, bad habits will have been unlearned. By this method of learning, 
one gains the necessary skills for painting well in oils, in any technique.
       The Direct Painting Technique is the one most widely used in modern times. The vast range of 
pigments available today has, in great measure, narrowed the gap between what is possible with it and 
with the Venetian Technique. It is also possible to modify the Direct Painting Technique by finishing off 
with glazes and/or scumbles after the painting is dry, but it then ceases to be direct painting. Some styles 
of Direct Painting owe their appeal to the painterly looseness obtained when painting very quickly with 
large brushes. For this type of painting, superimposition of glazes and scumbles would in most cases be 
inappropriate. In practice, the boundaries between techniques become blurred as artists combine elements 
of more than one method in pursuit of the desired effect. This is how new techniques are born. 
INNOVATIONS OF REMBRANDT
      Rembrandt Harmenszoon Van Rijn, whom many consider the greatest artist of all time, learned all 
that was then known about oil painting while still a very young man, surpassing his teachers very early in 
his career, and then proceeded to add his own discoveries to the technical knowledge of his time. To this 
day his best works remain unsurpassed, and serve as inspiration to the rest of us who paint. This being the 
case, any book on advanced techniques must address Rembrandt separately and at such length as the 
author's knowledge allows.
What technical information Rembrandt 
was taught may be discerned by studying 
the works of his instructors, Jacob 
Isaacxszoon Van Swanenburch and Pieter 
Lastmann. Such study also immediately 
shows the genius of Rembrandt by the 
extent to which he so obviously surpassed 
them both, and in how early in his career 
he did so. Nonetheless, his training under 
them was an important factor in his 
artistic development, and should not be 
minimized. Both teachers seem to have 
possessed a working knowledge of the 
painting methods in use at that time, 
which Rembrandt learned from them. 
This would include the Flemish 
Technique, the Venetian Technique, and 
the Direct Painting Technique. Various

The Oil Painter's Bible - chapter 6
examples of his work show that he was 
not limited to any one of them, but 
employed them all, the choice depending 
on which approach best suited the subject 
in question, and for what purpose the 
painting was intended. His facility with 
all three soon led him to combine aspects 
of one with another, and to add 
innovations of his own.
Some of his paintings are on wood, 
executed in what appears to be essentially 
the Flemish Technique; some small 
studies on wood panels were done in a 
variation of the Direct Painting 
Technique, and some on canvas in both 
the Venetian and Direct techniques. The 
primer for the panels is white, the first 
coat consisting of glue chalk gesso, which 
was sanded to smooth out the 
irregularities of the panel’s surface, then a 
layer of white lead in linseed oil, 
sometimes tinted with black, Raw Umber, 
and sometimes an earth red, covered with 
a transparent brown imprimatura, which 
creates the golden glow characteristic of 
his work. His canvases are primed with an 
underlayer of a red earth, perhaps to fill 
the texture of the canvas, then overlaid 
with a light, warm grey made from 
lootwit (lead white with chalk, ground in 
linseed oil) and Raw Umber, sometimes 
with a little black and/or earth red, or 
sometimes with white lead alone.
       Rembrandt was an extremely versatile artist, and did not likely follow an unthinking repetition of the 
same procedure every time. Undoubtedly he thought his way through each painting, from the genesis of 
the idea to the last brushstroke, never lapsing into a routine approach. From unfinished pictures we know 
that, at least sometimes, he began in transparent browns, working in monochrome to establish the design 
of the picture, attending to the masses of dark and light, often using opaque white for the strongest lights 
in this stage, sometimes referred to as the imprimatura, or later, by the French academic painters, as a 
frottée, though the term, “frottée” generally referred to a thin brown scrub-in without white, the lights 
instead being simply indicated by leaving the light ground more or less exposed. This stage was 
apparently allowed to dry before proceeding further, though there may well have been exceptions. Over 
the dried brown underpainting color was begun, with Rembrandt working from back to front rather than 
working over the whole picture at once. He exploited to the fullest the qualities of transparence and 
opacity, relying on the underglow of light coming through transparent color for many special effects, with 
opaque lights built up more heavily for the brightly lit areas, their colors sometimes modified by subtle 
glazes, semiglazes or scumbles, and the arrangement of transparent darks and opaque lights to play

The Oil Painter's Bible - chapter 6
against one another for maximum visual impact and depth. Clues as to his choice of primer may be seen 
in areas where he has used a sharpened brush handle to scratch through wet paint in order to indicate bits 
of hair. This is evident in a very early self portrait, now in The Hague, and in many other portraits. The 
primers and/or imprimaturas thus revealed show that he followed no one single procedure, but varied the 
choices, based on the effect he was after. The scratching with a sharpened brush handle into wet paint was 
one of his earlier innovations.
       Not long afterward, he began building up the opaque passages in his lights more heavily, and 
texturing them to take on the physical convolutions of the lighted surfaces of his subjects, most notably 
the skin textures of male subjects, including himself. The texture was created, or at any rate, can be 
duplicated, by applying the paint somewhat heavily with large brushes, then gently passing a large, dry, 
soft hair brush over the surface of the wet paint, back and forth, until the desired texture is attained. 
Rembrandt began to superimpose glazes of red over these textured passages when dry, then wipe them off 
with a rag, leaving traces remaining in the low spots to create an even more convincing texture of rough 
flesh. Someone, at some point, said you could pick up a Rembrandt portrait by the nose.
       As he began to expand the effect of glazing over dried impasto to other textures as well, he devised a 
method employing two whites; one for impasto and one for smoother passages. The impasto white was 
faster drying, probably made so by the addition of egg (traces of protein, presumed to be from egg, have 
been found in samples analyzed by conservation scientists), and ground glass, into the formulation. It was 
very lean, and consisted mostly of white lead with a minimum of binder. He began applying it more and 
more heavily as the first stage of a two (or more) stage operation which was finished with transparent 
glazes and wiping, to create fantastic special effects, the most extreme example of which is the man's 
glowing, golden sleeve in the painting referred to as "The Jewish Bride," in the Rijksmuseum in 
Amsterdam. The brilliance of this effect cannot be gotten in any other way. He has used the same 
technique on the bride's costume in the same painting, but here the underpainting is red, which is 
deepened with a glaze of red lake, probably Carmine (Cochineal). The red carpet on the table in "The 
Syndics of the Drapers' Guild" (sometimes called "The Dutch Masters"), also in the Rijksmuseum, is done 
in much the same way. The underpaint appears to have been trowelled on with a knife or some sort of flat 
stick, then sculpted before it dried.
       In Lieutenant Ruytenburch’s uniform in "The Night Watch," Rembrandt used this method, but with 
less heavy impasto, for the ornate brocade work. The wet underlayer was worked with sharpened brush 
handles and other tools while soft, then allowed to dry before applying the darker glazes. By wiping the 
glazes off as soon as they were applied, Rembrandt was able to create a bas relief effect of remarkable 
three dimensionality as the glaze remained in the nooks and crannies. By glazing again, this time with 
transparent yellows and/or browns, instead of Ivory Black, he gave the textures a rich, golden glow.
       Scientific analyses carried out by the National Gallery, London, show that Rembrandt added body to 
his glaze-like passages by mixing in a bit of chalk, which functions as an inert pigment essentially 
transparent when mixed with oil, and ground glass, which was probably used primarily to accelerate 
drying. The glass most likely would have contained lead and/or cobalt, both drying agents.
       There has been a great deal of speculation as to what medium or media Rembrandt used, with most of 
the theories stating that one resin or another had to have been a major component. It now appears that 
these hypotheses may be in error. Recent studies of paint samples taken from a number of Rembrandt’s 
paintings show no detectable resins. In most of the samples tested, only linseed oil was found, and walnut 
oil in some of the whites and blues. In some cases some of the oil was “heat-bodied,” as in perhaps boiled 
or sun-thickened linseed oil. It is probable that these were added to the paints in which he wanted a long 
brushing quality, and in at least some of his glazes. The combination of polymerized oil and raw oil 
produces a resin-like substance without the undesirable properties of resins. Reinforced with chalk for 
body, and ground glass for faster drying and perhaps transparency, these appear to comprise Rembrandt’s 
glazing media, as nearly as is discernible by the present level of scientific knowledge, which, it must be 
noted, is subject to change at any time, as new discoveries are made. For paints intended to be blended 
smoothly and opaquely, it is most likely that no medium was added, beyond the linseed or walnut oil in 
which the pigments were ground.
       Rembrandt had at least one life size jointed mannequin, on which he would pose the clothes of his 
sitters. The mannequin, unlike a living person, would remain motionless for as long as Rembrandt needed 
http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/advanced/chapter6.htm (10 of 11)1/13/2004 3:34:38 AM

The Oil Painter's Bible - chapter 6
to paint the clothing, the folds remaining undisturbed for days, or weeks, if necessary. A live sitter would 
have to visit the bathroom, eat, sleep, move around, etc., and the folds of the cloth would never be likely 
to resume their previous shape after any of these activities. The use of the mannequin may or may not 
have been Rembrandt's innovation, but it was, and is, a good idea regardless.
       We cannot expect to be able to rival the great genius of Rembrandt merely by following some of his 
procedures and using the same tools and materials he used. These are only a small part of his brilliance as 
an artist. At the core was his intelligence and artistic sense, his ability to constantly strive to improve upon 
what he had already done without losing sight of the original concept for the painting, to devise 
techniques, on the spot, which would create the effect he was after. We might hope to achieve the best 
results by adopting this same attitude towards our own work, rather than by attempting to reduce the 
methods of a great genius whose works we admire to a simple formula and then following it, unthinking. 
This is not meant to disparage technique, but to show it in its proper context. The more we know of 
technique, the more effects we have at our disposal, to serve our creativity and inspiration in the execution 
of our finest conceptions. If there is anything remotely approaching a formula for creating Great Art, it 
might be stated as the combination of knowledge and intuition in a single endeavor, plus a lot of work.

'Realism'
In Fig.5 I have brought some of the highlights forward by use of a higher value blue-gray and 
added some wings. This stage you could call 'molding' the forms or to use its proper terminology 
you could call it the application of chiaroscuro. This was the method made famous by the 
Renaissance painter Carravaggio and copied in the north by painters such as Rembrandt, Rubens 
and Vermeer.

Detail of lower torsos. 
Fig. 8 
Thumbnail of full composition.
Now we get to the technical reason that made Bouguereau paintings so realistic. More than 
any other painter Bouguereau showed veins and arteries, which we know by our study of 
anatomy, lie just below the skin and show behind the knee, in the neck, inside the elbow, in 
the lower abdomen and between the thigh and the torso. There was no need to show them 
all, yet just sufficient to give the model a defined 'humanity'.
This is a large step away from the 'ideal' toward the 'real' and needs to be handled with the 
same care a jazz musician might use a discord to amplify a harmony. Not too much that 
might make it look like a blue road map.
No doubt the display of veins and arteries is not one that would normally attract the viewer 
BUT in this case it has another purpose. It throws into the mix of the ideal figures and 
perfect forms something that might otherwise be thought ugly. In Fig.7 you can see where I 
have shown the veins that occur between the thigh and torso of the female, and the thigh of 
the male.
Also note in Fig.8 and elsewhere I have reddened hands, feet, knees, elbows and faces as 
the blood is closer to the surface in these more sensitive areas.

'A certain realism'
Now for some technical information regarding technique. I used none other than bristle brushes for 
this painting to this stage.
OK ... we started with a value 4-5 burnt umber with a blue-gray interior for the figures. The blue 
gray was molded in the chiaroscuro manner and allowed to settle and dry. A higher value mix of 
light red/burnt umber and flake white was used to bring the flesh up to a warmth in the secondary 
areas (or turning point areas)that pointed upwards. The turning point areas that pointed down 
were left blue-gray(as seen in the background). In certain other areas close to the ground, and 
reflecting down, a little yellow was added. This took care of most secondary areas.
Working back from the highlights with a flake white, sometimes with a little red added and 
sometimes with a touch of ultramarine, and using a small bristle (1/4"), cut and blend the 
highlights into the secondary values. If desired at this stage you can add veins and other secondary 
areas as well painting wet-in-wet as time permits and adjusting as you wish.

Wall presence - brush strokes lesson by William Whitaker
4-2 PAINTERLY 2
William Whitaker writes: 'Like everybody else whose worked at painting a long time, I've tried 
everything. I've learned that Art Leads, I just go along. I didn't consciously set out to be a 
certain kind of painter, it just evolved. I don't believe there is any one true way, but I'll tell you 
what I like best. I start loose and juicy. I rarely paint alla prima anymore and I try to smooth 
out the paint at the end of a session. I dislike the effect when I paint over a textured layer 
whose texture is in the wrong places. I have a very old, sharp palette knife (sharpened from 
years of scraping.) I'll carefully scrape texture off a dried surface with it. If I'm working on a 
panel, I'll often sand the fuzz, texture and grit off the dried paint surface with wet or dry fine 
sand paper, sanding wet, before painting the next coat - a technique I picked up from house 
painters. 
 
I'm very aware of what I call "wall presence" or the lack of it. A lot of my best buddies were 
successful illustrators before they became even more successful gallery painters. They all were 
smart enough to know and understand that the single most valuable characteristic in a painting 
on display is the spiritual wall presence. It is easier to achieve this quality with oil paint than 
with other mediums. This is due to inherent pigment strength and natural body. 
It is very hard NOT to have texture even when 
you try. I believe it's best not to worry one way 
or another. I think it's a kiss of death to be 
thinking consciously about technique in the 
middle of the painting process. One must really 
love to paint, to be driven as it were, to put in 
the time necessary to really get proficient. 
Many people would like to paint, but not enough 
to paint those endless failures necessary to get 
to the good work. If it were otherwise, we'd be 
overrun with painters. 
If there is to be texture in my painting, I want it 
to be in the last layer. I'm aware of the vast 
range and intrinsic beauty in oil paint. Using thin 
paint and thick paint, glazes and opaques, one 
can create a feast for the eye.

There seem to be a great many folks who are doing high finish (they call it realistic) work out 
there today. Most of these people paint from the outside in - paint the hair on the dog before 
painting the dog. Most of the time they are pretty easy to spot. I tell the viewer to check out 
the following: Do they paint Orange People? Thanks to film, TV and Print, most folks think 
orange people are realistic! Does everything look like plastic? Enough said about that! What do 
the broad, quiet passages look like. A poor artist doesn't know how to handle his brush. It 
shows in the backgrounds.

The painterly effect a lesson by Virgil Elliott
4-1 THE PAINTERLY EFFECT
 
In these lessons I do not hesitate to assert 
that art is about illusion and great art is the 
total presentation of the greatest illusion. 
This brings me to the ‘painterly effect’ or 
the process of having your brush strokes or 
knife effects appear on the canvas as you 
see opposite in the detail from a pink rose I 
painted 'wet-in-wet' before the blooms 
could wilt. The full painting is shown 
below ... JH 
 
Virgil writes:
The "painterly" approach was originally an incidental effect most common in sketches and 
studies, the sole purpose of which was to help the artist solve some of the problems in the 
execution of a more refined painting. Titian and Rembrandt became more "painterly" in their 
later years, when deteriorating eyesight may have hidden the irregularities from them (one 
hypothesis). Franz Hals painted a number of paintings in the sketch style, probably for his own 
amusement and/or to cover his bar tab or whatever. He was capable of more refined painting, 
as is evident in most of his more important commissioned portraits, but employed the faster 
"alla prima" approach for painting more light-hearted subjects; probably his friends or 
interesting subjects encountered at the tavern, where no one was likely to pose for very long. 
Bouguereau has been falsely characterized as disguising his brushstrokes, but his brushwork is 
actually visible from up close. In reproductions the strokes do not show, because the paintings 
are generally large, with the main figures life-size, and the brushstrokes are small. He also used 
palette knife very expertly for certain effects, especially in the vegetation and other parts of the 
background, but generally did not employ impasto.

The painterly effect a lesson by Virgil Elliott
 
The 'painterly' style became more popular with John Singer 
Sargent, Anders Zorn, and Joachin Sorolla. Sargent actually 
worked very hard to achieve the effect that he had dashed 
the picture off effortlessly and accurately all at once. Many 
passages were scraped out and repainted over and over 
again until the desired appearance was accomplished. There 
is a certain charm in this type of painting (see opposite), but 
its effectiveness depends on the values and colors being 
registered extremely accurately, or the result just looks 
sloppy. Sargent's eye was precise enough to make it work. 
Ironically, he expressed regret, late in life, that he had not 
carried his paintings to a higher degree of finish. The main 
trick to painting in this manner is to work fast, with large 
hog- bristle brushes and large amounts of paint available on 
the palette. palette knife can also be used for certain effects. 
A somewhat rougher texture canvas works best for this 
technique, in my experience. Some subjects are more suited 
for this approach than others. It is well for artists to be able 
to paint in more than one manner, and to choose whichever 
technique best suits the subject at hand. 
Regarding impasto highlights, the reason for this is to ensure 
that they remain opaque far into the future. Oil paint 
becomes more transparent as it ages, and the thinner the 
paint, the more transparent it will become. Highlights must 
be opaque in order to reflect the light which strikes them in 
the same way as it would reflect from the surface depicted.' 
Refined Painting - 'The most advanced concepts go beyond words' ... VE 
 
Rembrandt developed the technique 
of glazing over dried impasto for a 
bas- relief effect, wiping the wet 
glaze off the high spots and allowing 
it to remain in the nooks and 
crannies for a heightened three-
dimensional effect. Used in this 
manner, impasto can actually 
enhance the illusion of the third 
dimension.

The painterly effect a lesson by Virgil Elliott
Gerome (below) insisted on a perfectly smooth surface to the painting, and forbade his students 
to use impasto anywhere. 
 
 
My first instructor, who happened to be my mother, 
told me it makes a painting more interesting to the 
viewer when he or she can detect some of the 
artist's brushwork from up close. I still adhere to 
that, to a greater or lesser degree depending on 
what I feel is most appropriate for the picture in 
question, but I prefer to only leave a few, in 
strategic places, rather than leave them everywhere 
indiscriminately. My usual practice is to have them 
undetectable from normal viewing distance, and 
only become barely visible from a few inches away. 
In my alla prima style, which I seldom employ these 
days, I may let them show a bit more noticably in 
areas where they serve a purpose, as accents. This 
was generally the practice of most of the Old 
Masters. 
I believe it is best for painters to have command of 
all possible visual effects, as this opens up the 
widest range of possibilities, and best facilitates the 
creation of whatever illusion is desired.' ... Virgil

Grapes, cherrys and the eyeball
3-2 THE GRAPE, THE CHERRY AND THE EYE
A friend once wrote ... 'There is such evident sparkle in the eyes of intelligent people which if 
often missing in others, but always present to some degree. One of the things that led me to 
believe this is possible, was when I had the unfortunate experience of having to put one of my 
cats that had a fatal disease, to sleep. I can't tell you what a horrible experience this was as I 
loved this animal deeply. As the fatal injection was given, I actually watched the eyes go from 
sparkling to a dead grey. I have never gotten that image out of my mind.'
In this lesson we are going to examine how to do the reverse ... to put a sparkle back 
into the eye.
To do this we must look at a white grape and a red cherry and see what makes them appear 
real. First the grape:
Many artists love putting white grapes in their still life paintings because they have a wonderful 
transparency which shows up particularly well against a bunch of dark grapes and other items.
Fig 1
Fig 2
Fig 3
Many fruits have a light grey covering on their skin I call 'frosting'. This occurrs on the skin of 
most fresh stone fruit but is particularly noticeable on peaches, plums and grapes. I have added 
this frosting to Fig 2 above.
In Fig 3 I have added a top 'highlight' and a secondary highlight (180 degrees apart) where the 
ray of light 'emerges' from the grape. This occurrs because the grape is semi-transparent 
allowing some light rays to 'penetrate' the liquid in the grape itself. 
In the examples of the three grapes shown above I have altered their hue slightly to allow for 
various stages of ripeness. Also, since the 'frosting' is sometimes removed as the grapes are 
handled or moved about I have cleared certain areas allowing the smooth skin to show through. 
This has the effect of emphasising the frosted areas even more.
Now all we need do is assemble our bunch in as a convincing manner as possible (see below). 
This should not be difficult for those partial to eating grapes. 
http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/advanced/grape.htm (1 of 3)1/13/2004 3:37:25 AM

Grapes, cherrys and the eyeball
The cherry also has similar qualities to the grape though without the transparency. 
Fig 1
Fig 2
Fig 3
Fig 4
See above .... the dark (Fig 1), the frosting (Fig 2), the red (Fig 3) and the highlight (Fig 4).
Then ... below they are assembled with a few 'realistic' toutches. Most of the frosting is 
removed and the exposed shiny bright red skin makes the 'highlight' sharper. There is no 
'transparency' in the cherry. You will no doubt remember the lesson on the 'pearl' which was an 
object with similar non-transparency.
With the grape and the pearl (or cherry) we have created the two spheres that 
together will allow us to understand, paint and add the sparkle we want to the the 
human eye. 
To see how this is achieved you must go to the next page.

4-3 WHAT MAKES A MASTERPIECE?
A painting masterpiece is ’a portal or magic window that will draw the imagination.’ 
How is this done and why are we humans drawn to certain paintings like Icarus was to the sun, or 
flies to fly paper? 
Why, because the painter desires the viewer to enter into the painting, and once there, to make 
them want to dwell awhile. And how do they do this? By imagination and the use of all the means, 
tricks, skill, subterfuge, and techniques at their disposal.
The techniques include texture, design, color, chiaroscuro, aerial perspective, drawing perspective, 
form and shape. These skills have been honed over thousands of years and are a proven method to 
attract the curious and entice even the dullest imagination. They are the basic tools of the painter. 
During the previous two centuries a few extra skills have been added to the painters arsenal. 
1. Depth of field. 
2. Impressionistic use of color 
3. Brushstrokes and the viscous use of modern paints. 
These also are legitimate tools painters can employ to entice the viewers into their world.

http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/advanced/what_makes_a_masterpiece.htm
Now that is out of the way we can ask; how do we classify works as masterpieces? Answer; by 
finding their similarities and judging whether their differences are relevant differences. For this 
purpose I list below ten pre -1900 paintings I class as masterpieces. This is not to say there aren't 
others ... 
Giorgione - The Tempest 
Vermeer - Girl with pearl earing 
Leonardo - The Mona Lisa 
Rembrant - The night watch 
Caravaggio - Calling St.Mathew 
Velazquez - Las Meninas 
Titian - the assumption 
Watteau - The clown -Pierot
Turner - The fighting Temairaire 
Gerome - Police Versa
THEY ARE ALL SHOWN ON THIS PAGE 
It is assumed that what binds these paintings together is more relevant than their differences. So 
what binds them? Here we must almost become Toaist in our answer. The artists all ‘walked on rice-
paper but left no footprints’(ie, more becomes less).
In all these works there is mystery, subtlety and a magnetic attraction. The technique is so skilful, 
so masterful, so seamless, it is unnoticeable. Like the great actor who makes the audience forget

he or she is acting; so does the great painter do likewise for the imagination. That is what requires 
all the skill and technique. 
This is not something dependent on the degree of reality of the scene or the portrait, nor is it 
dependent on the degree of unreality of the same. It is something else. 
So, I will list what binds these paintings; 
1. They all have an element of mystery 
2. They all have a technical mastery that is sufficiently high to make it instantly secondary, un-
noticeable. 
3. They all visit a moment in time and space that fires the interest and imagination of the viewer. 
4. They all pre-suppose the viewer can share a human understanding and common experience with 
the painter.

http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/advanced/what_makes_a_masterpiece.htm
So, what does all this prove? 
Not much, but I still like to call the process ‘the magic of painting', and coming across a 
masterpiece can take your breath away. It is worth the effort.

of them. Allow 40min.

Grapes, cherrys and the eyeball
3-3 THE GRAPE, THE CHERRY AND THE EYE
The eye is a ball with the iris (dark part) forming a slight projection like a boss. The pupil is not 
a color but a dark shadow, a hole that allows light into the eye.
An attribute of the eye is the that it is translucent. This can lead to the following paradox: 
when the light strikes the iris at an angle the highlight appears to be surrounded by dark even 
though being round, that side is facing the light. 
There are two layers to the outer eye. There is the cornea, and the lens. Light might very 
easily pass through the cornea, and reflect off the lens causing a hightlight at odd locations on 
the cornea. Both these stuctures bend light to some extent; the lens obviously bending light 
more than the cornea. A hightlight on the cornea should show up on the opposite side of the 
cornea as a reflected hightlight just as it does in glass.
The light that is seen in the iris of the eye opposite the highlight is transmitted light, which is 
seen also in a glass or bottle of wine, or any container of transparent liquid. It works the same 
with a grape. The iris of an eye is likewise a container of transparent liquid. Light passes 
through it and reflects off the inside of the back of it, 180 degrees opposite the entry point. 
The highlight itself is the reflection of the light source from the moist outer surface of the eye. 
Of course this only occurs when the eye is in the light. 
So the side opposite to the highlight often seems lit up, although it is in shadow. 
The proper rendering of this effect gives the eye an aqueous and luminous quality, which is not 
http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/advanced/the_eye.htm (1 of 3)1/13/2004 3:38:02 AM

Grapes, cherrys and the eyeball
available in any other way. Indeed it is possible to introduce this effect deliberately by 
changing the position of the highlight and thus transforming a dull eye into a live one. Often I 
introduce highlights into the eyes even when it is optically impossible, or when the light source 
was not even reaching the eye. I consider the employment of such a device to be a legitimate 
conceit and a method sometimes necessary in portraiture. The fact that, scientifically, the 
angle is 180 degrees is dependent on the eye being spherical. Unfortunately there are two 
spheres that contain the surface of the eye which complicates the angle of reflection even 
more. 
You'd turn a cherry into a grape by adding the transmitted light to the side opposite the light's 
entry point. A grape is translucent; a cherry is not. Light travels through a grape. 
You'd also diffuse the highlight a bit more to indicate a less glossy surface. The highlight is the 
reflection of the light source on the surface, and the degree to which it is diffused indicates the 
texture of the surface. You might contrast edgy polished metal one the one extreme with soft 
velvet on the other, for example.

Advanced painting techniques and computers - Lesson 1
COMBINING OIL PAINTING AND TECHNOLOGY
Lesson 1
In this section I shall deal with the future of painting and how it might be affected by technology, computers, advanced 
printers and scanners.
In this regard I must say, without apology, that in my atelier, as well as all the usual painting equipment, I have a 
scanner, computer and large format epson 7600 printer that is capable of printing 75year lightfast pigments on canvas.
The scanner is a common Cannon LCD (diode) scanner that I cut apart with a hacksaw and re-assembled to allow me to 
scan paintings of any size and to reassemble them in 'photoshop' without any discernable joining. The scanner is set up 
on a large grid table, face down has been used to scan 50"x80" paintings with sizes of over 500mg bytes.
Now the good part - should I wish I can print an exact copy of my original then, using my oil paints, treat the canvas 
inkjet print as a primatura, and begin to paint over it. The final result can be varnished and protected as you would any 
other oil painting. This again can be scanned... 
Of course this allows me to create an endless stream of variations on any of my originals and hence poses the question: 
What exactly is an 'original'?
I shall leave this for others to decide but let me only say that to this point I am perfectly happy with the integrity of all 
the processes upon which the final work is constructed. 
Now I shall demonstrate some of the processes with my 'Bounty' painting 'Portsmouth 1792', above. The image above is 
a JPG compressed image made for the purposes of this lesson. The original oil painting was scanned at 360 dots per inch 
(DPI) in 15 parts. This was joined and color corrected and flattened in Photoshop giving me a 250+ megabyte psd 
(photoshop) file. The JPEG above was saved from this while the PSD file is the one I manipulated.

Advanced painting techniques and computers - Lesson 1
Within photoshop I selected a portion of the original and copied and pasted it on to my work area. 
Next I 'flipped' it over for the reverse and joined it as close as possible - lining up the particular features that were 
important for the landscape generally.

Advanced painting techniques and computers - Lesson 1
Some further adjustments were needed and some of the details obviously need to be isolated and reformed. 
Here I have removed the ship No 1 which will become the major and closest ship. It also need to be tilted a little so the 
masts line up properly. This is done separately and then the ship replaced into the painting- see below. 
http://www.wortorganic.com/computer/ (3 of 4)1/13/2004 3:38:35 AM

Advanced painting techniques and computers - Lesson 1
The final stage take more time as many areas are removed, replaced, hidden, healed and joined. The final scan was then 
printed on canvas 24"x48" allowed to dry. Color correction were made to the print using transparent oils (indian yellow, 
permanent crimson, phalo blue)in various mixes. More adjustments and details were added using opaque pigments from 
my standard palette. 
This is the final result which I have again scanned into a file and added to my collection. Should any improvments occur I 
can easily reprint from this larger file. Should I need to use any of the various elements in this painting (the sky for 
instance), I can easily isolate it and use it as a background for another painting.

Silver and copper
2-2 SILVER AND COPPER
 
SILVER Technical: Second to gold as most 
malleable. Oxides are black forming silver 
sulphide (try egg yolks) - see dark cracks in 
example. Spitting silver, when silver cools it 
expels oxygen and spits. Used as an alloy, 
in photography and for coins. Absorbs most 
hues equally but seems to reflect minor 
amounts of most.
Conceptionally : Precious metal with dull 
lustre. Jewellery, tableware. Combines well 
with gold and glass and useful for subtle 
neutral highlights.
Presentation: Always try and understate - 
against a dark background if possible. As 
with the pearl, silver can be painted over 
with a milky rainbow-hued semi-
transparent film. Adaptable for use beside 
objects with strong hues as it will give nice 
secondary glows. Make colors as subtle as 
possible. 
Painting: First paint in grey as slick and smooth as possible making sure to roughly place the 
highlights. Allow to dry then glaze with thin quick drying medium. When dry scrumble on red 
blue and yellows in minute milky amounts. When dry glaze again ( or else you can apply the 
colors thinly within a medium). Scrumble on colors reflected from nearby objects etc. Place 
some opaque highlights and merge with surrounding areas until a dull glow is achieved. 
 
COPPER Technical: Found in pure state and 
can be beaten into shape when cold. 
Alloyed with tin gives bronze. Used as 
plates for engraving and etching. Oxidises a 
green-blue. Often mined with sulphur which 
is burnt off in smelting. Great conductor - 
wide use as cooking utensils. Copper is 
usually fashioned using a 'ball-pane' 
hammer which has a rounded face. This 
gives it that distinctive ripple effect.
Conceptional: Coins, warm brown colors 
with irregular highlights. Goes in and out of 
fashion with house utensils etc. Age-old 
metal easily beaten into relief panels which 
some years ago were made into stand-
alone decorations.
Presentation: Best given the beaten effect 
- see below. Hints of green in the shadows 
with subdued red-yellow hues in middle 
tones. 
http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/advanced/silvercopper.htm (1 of 2)1/13/2004 3:38:57 AM

Silver and copper
 
Painting: First use a semi-neutral background color such 
as raw umber to create forms and shading. Add a little 
cobalt blue to deepen the forms if necessary. Glaze. Apply 
mid-tones (I used a thin burnt sienna) feather the edges for 
a ripple effect but do not blend as with silver. Paint 
highlights wet in wet keeping edges round but sharp. Glaze 
when dry. 
STUDENT ACTIVITY:For this page and the previous - find 
your own cylindrical object (cup) and paint it as chrome, 
gold, silver and copper. Allow 80min.

roses
BIRTHDAY ROSES
To me a rose, is a rose, is a rose .... I have never ever painted a vase of flowers let alone roses. 
But now I was cornered.
Many years ago I promised a lady I would paint her roses for a particular birthday and promptly 
forgot about it. Recently I got a call to remind me the birthday was imment ... 
There was no way out. I drove off to the flower shop, sorry 'florist', and bought some bunches 
of roses then searched the house for anything that might be useful as a vase. (All paintings are 
roughly 24" x 20") 
 
I promised red roses so I decided to warm up with some pink (above). The pink also seemed to 
be the first to begin to droop, later I was to discover it was necessary to keep them in the 
refrigerator to prolong their life. The shell was to fill a compositional space as well as reflecting 
the same hues. It was also a reminder I might be at the beach instead of painting roses.

blooms are suitable for bedrooms, red for a more formal setting such as a dining room and 
white and gold anywhere else. 
I also discover Cleopatra was said to have filled her rooms with rose petals to welcome Mark 
Anthony and that the early Christians banned the rose from churches and churchyards because 
of its connection with pagan rites. This is getting interesting ...

5-3 IMPROVE YOUR OLD PHOTOGRAPHS
Combining computer technology and principles of painting.
Between painting and writing I sometimes get asked to do little jobs. When I begin I am always 
somewhat reluctant as the the jobs never seem to rise to my exhalted level of 'high art' and I 
usually moan and complain. This is a good time to take a step or two back and view yourself as 
the arrogant 'pain in the butt' you are slipping toward. Probably because there is no woman 
around to bring you back down to earth (not that they ever did) ... anyway, I digress, the job is 
to fix an old photograph. 
The photograph had been torn into four 
pieces then lovingly stuck back 
together ... sounds like the normal 
commerce between loved ones or family 
members ... then a marker pen was 
used to repair the rips. I was 
immediately struck by the blandness of 
the whole thing, but stick with me here 
for even the delicious local mud crabs I 
can sometimes afford are trapped in foul 
swamps. 
For a little more detail ... notice how the marker pen was used on the lips shirt and uniform.

Applying painting theory to computer graphics
Well I fixed all that using what is called a 
smudge brush.This allows you to drag 
surrounding areas over the cracks in whatever 
'opacity' you like. 
At this point I was feeling rather pleased with 
myself - job quickly done - another mundane 
task bites the dust. But I started to think 
(always a dangerous sign), I asked myself, 'I 
wonder what sort of life this man had? Which 
war was he fighting and how do his comrades 
remember him? Maybe he was a hero? Maybe 
he was a heor who fought in the trenches and 
saved the day, or at carried a wounded 
comrade to safety through a hail of bullets?' 
So even if he can't pay me perhaps he 
deserves a little more of my time. 
Let's see if I can't make him come alive a little.

Painting tecnique and computer graphics -2
IMPROVE YOUR OLD PHOTOGRAPHS No.2
Combining computer technology and principles of painting.
I quickly separated the major elements of the picture knowing I could always use the smudge 
tool to put them back together. 
Using some color controls (in a graphics programe), I removed color from the grey. This has the 
effect of giving the picture tints of the opposite (complimentary) hues without affecting the 
contrasts (values). In this operation I applied color theory regarding complements - while 
keeping the values bright. The reason for this is important. In previous lessons I have talked 
about the theory of 'subtractive' color and how we use it in painting. The theory I use here is 
called 'addative color theory' and is commonly used in photography, film and computer imaging. 
Simply put the spectrum hues combine to produce white light, and the removal of one leaves a 
predominance of the rest. In other words if we had a red, blue and yellow spotlights and shone 
them all on a blank screen they would produce white. White then is the sum (addative) of all 
the colors. If we subtract red then the white spot will turn green, subtract blue and orange will 
appear etc. 
To produce the hues above I started with ovals of white. In the first I subtracted red, the 
second green and the third blue. This is how what they call 'additive' color, works! 
In this manner I applied hue (color) to the hat and uniform, the face and the shirt. 
Next I put them roughly back together. 
I gave the cheeks and the bottom lip a 
little extra blush with a computer 
paintbrush. 
This meant I still had a raw figure with no 
background ...

color. In other words convert it to a 
'greyscale' format. 
So I searched for a background that 
might describe the nature of the war

found what I wanted but it was tiny. 
This was not necessarily a

Next I applied contrast 
and then converted it 
back to 'RGB' or a 'color' 
file since I nedded to add 
color. I added color using 
'color adjust' and 
'variations'.

Next I used masks and more color controls to vary certain elements.
Then I removed the background and applied a diagonal brown/gold color gradient from 
the top left to the bottom right.
I needed to touch up the result by adding a little rouge to the cheeks, sparkle to the eyes, 
depth to some of the shadows and generally to work the portrait up just as if I were doing 
a conventional portrait in paint.

6-1 PAINTING CLOTHING
The painting of fur, linen, cotton, velvet, silk, satin, gauzes and other diaphanous 
materials 
Drawing the edges and the folds ... the thickness and pliability (softness) of the cloth 
determines the size and shape of the folds. 
 
Fur and thick wool that is soft yet pliant 
requires little drawing as it is mainly 
composed of large gentle contours. It usually 
dominates the form it conceals. 
Thick heavy linen or damask 
that resists folding will show 
straight edges and will stress at 
the folds with double or even 
triple indents (see in the acute 
angles left). It also will override 
the shape it conceals. Note the 
straight lines on the outside of 
the folds and the triple creases 
in the folds. Durer, who makes 
this type of rendition so stylistic 
it almost becomes his drawing 
signature, suggests deeper 
creases within the shadows to

suggest body forms. Note 
particularly the thigh and leg of 
Mary. 
 
Light linen or cotton will behave in a similar 
fashion only the folds and bends will be 
thinner and closer together. Note the size of 
the folds and the squareness of the outline. 
Velvet (the cape) is heavy, yet quite pliable 
and will show a slight curve and usually turn in 
single folds. This more flowing style is typical 
of Bottichelli. 
Silk and satin are thin and fold easily with narrow and sometimes a chaos of activity where 
directions alter. They cling to the shape they cover and faithfully follow the contours - be they 
straight or curved. Here I have simplified a part of a Virgil Elliott painting to show the underlying

structure of the folds. 
 
Gauzes are either thin linen or diaphanous silk in pliability and should be lightly drawn 
accordingly. A soft shawl will follow a contour while a starched gauze will resist. Below is a 
starched gauze over a linen dress. 
 
Before you begin drawing a garment observe the broadest and narrowest folds. The complicated 
folds should be simplified at the drawing stage.

Virgil Elliott is a master painter of silks, satins, and 
diaphanous gauzes (as well as many other things). He offers 
the following advice: 'The first thing I do is to arrange the cloth 
in a way that suits my sense of aesthetics, so that its form 
indicates what is beneath it, and at the same time adds another 
element of eye-pleasing shapes to the composition which 
comprise areas of secondary interest and lead the viewer's eye 
from the main focal point, around the picture in a graceful 
pattern (ideally), which ends up back at the main focal point 
and starts the process again. It should reveal key forms in 
some places, only suggest them in others, and conceal points of 
interest in other places (mystery increases interest), while at 
the same time incorporating its own interesting and/or pretty 
shapes into the overall. In other words, I usually design the 
shapes to begin with, before I start to draw or paint, unless by 
happy accident they have already assumed a pleasing 
configuration. Often I use a mannequin for this, as models tend 
to object to having the cloth attached here and there with 
straight pins, and won't hold still long enough. When I use a 
live model for the cloth, I draw very quickly to get the shapes 
noted before she or he has to move for whatever reason, then I 
follow the drawing, which is generally just a guide sketch at this 
point, when the model is back from the bathroom or whatever, 
to rearrange the cloth back the way it was. I then follow the 
sketch in designing the actual painting, but often deviate from 
it wherever I see a way to improve the shapes further.' 
Does your drawing suggest the pliability of the material? If it 
does then you need no enhancement in the drawing stage.

Textises and cloth No2
6-2 FABRIC TEXTURE
2. Texture this is the roughness or smoothness of the material and us usually apparent in two 
places, the boundaries or edges of the garment or at its general mass where light values change 
(turning points -basic lesson on texture).
a) Edge : silk obviously can combine the highest degree of smoothness with thinness of material 
so its edge treatment is the sharpest. Next would be linen or cotton gauze where the edge would 
appear a thin line. Note - light will often reflect from a cut or bare edge. Fur is the other extreme.
b) Turning points: here texture can be shown as individual weaves, hair, cotton or thread 
stand proud of the material and cast their own minute shadow. The length of the shadow being 
determined by the sharpness of the fold (see below). This is where the professional artist makes 
judicious use of the many brushes at his disposal as well as carefully adjusting the paint to the 
viscosity necessary for the appropriate effect. Some will paint wet into wet and others paint over 
dry surfaces. Still others prefer to use glazes, palette knives or a multitude of instruments. 
 
Can you decide from the above examples which is silk, cotton, linen and velvet? 
3. Value differences: Tonal - this is the value difference on the grey scale between the 
highlights and the shadows of the material being painted.
This factor should be approached completely independently of any color considerations and for 
practical purposes we shall assume one light source and one direction (not backlighting). The 
artist will usually limit these tonal divisions to a minimum of two and a maximun of four with the 
following approximations; 
Fur and wool - two - with little value difference between highlight and shadow 
Flax-linen and heavy cotton - three - values between highlights and middletones closest Satin 
- three - values evenly spread (note that highly reflective materials like silk or satin are very 
prone to secondary surface reflections.) 
Silk, taffeta and satin- four - values closer at the highlight end. See blue taffeta dress below. 
http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/advanced/cloth2.htm (1 of 3)1/13/2004 3:40:45 AM

Textises and cloth No2
 
Gauze and diaphanous silks - two (the third one here is transparency or the form beneath) 
values between highlights and middletones close. 
Virgil Elliott writes: 'The key is to understand that light on diaphanous cloth renders it more 
opaque, and thereby obscures more of what is underneath, while in shadows it is more 
transparent, allowing more of what is under it or behind it to show through. Also the opacity/
transparency is affected by the angle of the cloth relative to our line of sight. Parallel to the line 
of sight it is more opaque, and perpendicular to it it is more transparent, with varying degrees in 
between those extremes.' 
Velvet - two + - folds work light a bit differently than other fabrics. 
Secondary light - This is the ability of a surface to absorb light rays reflected from another 
nearby surface(such as the yellow chair below). The artist can then insert complements in the 
shadows or between the tonal divisions. 
 
Here in this detail from a Goya painting there are secondary and tertiary reflected colors which 
http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/advanced/cloth2.htm (2 of 3)1/13/2004 3:40:45 AM

Textises and cloth No2
provides a richness almost beyond the imagination. Even more so because the initial color of the 
dress is so bland with only two basic value changes. There are those who will undoubtedly claim 
they see more.
Virgil Elliott notes ' Whereas it is a popular practice to place complements in shadows, it is not 
the way light works in reality. The main influence on the color of shadows is the color of the 
secondary light, which could be any color. Only in highly reflective surfaces like satin or polished 
metal or glass will reflected color register noticeably in the middletones.'

Lesson in color
7-1 DECIDING ON COLOR 
The basic palette I used for this painting was very simple light red, raw umber and yellow 
ochre, cobalt blue and prussian blue - one red two yellows and two blues. The overall cast of 
this painting is blue green. My concern to this stage (above) was to keep everything subdued 
and to make sure the lights and darks (values) looked correct. I knew I would be adding 
touches of highly saturated red and yellow hues at a later stage. How did I know this? I 
remembered a painting by Rembrant that had a similar color scheme, all I needed were roughly 
the same percentage of hues - although the values I wanted would be slightly higher. Why did I 
use this scheme? The narrative involving an ageing Thor demanded clouds and sunset. Since I 
also knew I would be showing areas of suntanned flesh I therefore resisted using red in the sky 
and distant landscape. I wanted instead the blue grey of the storm. 
 
When the painting was almost finished I added my toutches of cadmium red and cadmium 
yellow for the highlights, specifically the handle of the hammer and the apprentice's toga. These 
highly saturated colors have the effect of echoing and unifying all the other reds and yellows. 
Drawing a parallel to music I could say they act like a pure single high major note, played an 
octave its harmonic chord. Suddenly you then see all the reds and yellows unified and 
reverberating about the canvas.

MORE ON ROSES
Later I will show you how to paint a roses but for now it is important to understand exactly how 
roses are constructed. It seems they have thorns on the stems, five leaves on the shoots and 
things called sepals and corollas. This sort of information was not graspingly important to me 
during my younger years when getting a football over a line or a girl into a backseat were more 
pressing and roses were stolen from a neighbourhood garden to celebrate grandma's infrequent 
visits. That's when I first discovered the thorns.
 
Next I found there are two types of roses; the simple and the complicated. Apparently the 
simple are the early primitive variety with five petals while the complicated are also known as 
hybrids, which it seems have more colors and mutations than the livestock around Chernoble.

roses2
They can also climb, form a bush and grow from a stick in the ground. They are also named 
after folk I have never heard of. 
There are some positives however and the fact that without roses the English language would 
be devoid of the excitingly beautiful word 'floribunda' ... and 'tea' would be reduced to a mere 
beverage. In addition it seems some hardy souls have devoted their lives to grafting miles upon 
miles of thorny stems together as pleasure, rather than the torture it would seem to normal 
people. 
I must say that since I have had bunches of the things in the studio (for painting purposes only) 
the general aroma of gum spirit and sweat has lessened. For that alone many are greatfull.

Value and hue -Lessons in color 
7-2 COLOR POSSIBILITIES
All the values, hues and saturations are taken directly from the painting. This will have the effect of 
unifying the whole package. The gold on the frame already echoes the yellow of the painting. What 
color will you ultimately choose? What will be its value, hue and saturation? Try and think of these 
as a combined choice (ie medium value, green hue, highly satureated) 
1.VALUE
Light is absorbed at the back of the eye by cells (cones) sensitive to red, blue and green 
wavelenghts and seem to be responsible for color vision in daylight. In dim light the 'rods' take over, 
which are more sensitive to blue-green light, and distinguish clearly between values of light and 
shade. This is why squinting helps you determine the value of a color. 
First: what value (how light or dark )do you prefer? 
Medium values - from breastplate 
  Low and high value - from rocks and sky 
2. HUE 
Second: what hue (color) do you like?

Saturation - lesson in color
But if this were to be hung on a blue or green wall my choice would alter considerably. Now you 
should understand color is about value, hue and saturation ... and how they should be considered 
separate elements when describing and choosing 'color'. Theoretically this should all be obvious but 
whenever I am teaching apprentice painters most of their difficulties arise when they grasp a brush. 
Then they tend to forget completely about color theory and worry about everything else. If this 
happens the student should be made to work out a separate color design before the painting is 
begun.

The psychology of color
7-4 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF COLOR
Psychology is the study of human behaviour ... 
What has this to do with color? We must first decide whether there is a genetic or instinctive 
behavioural element in hue recognition. Then we might ask if there are any environmental 
aspects that have a universal effect on the human species. 
1. Genetic - I have seen no evidence of the first. We are not like bees or birds where the 
recognition of the hues of flowering plants are somehow passed on from one generation to the 
next.
2. Environmental - I have seen green associated with health - and with rotting meat, red with 
luck and danger, blue with pain and tranquillity, yellow with disease or elsewhere intellect. 
Summing up I know of no universal acceptance of a particular hue or color that has a universal 
significance across all societies. Movment has more significance for survival purpose for the eye 
discerns movement before anything else. The eye discerns movement at a span of 180 degrees 
where hue, depending on its saturation, can be seen only to 140 degrees. 
When awareness of red is combined with a sense of heat then we might say the combination is 
universally one of fire. This and many other instances of combined sensory experiences are 
manifold but those instancing color alone escape me. I must conclude that singularly hue has 
no universal behavioural consequences and therefore no psychological implications - unless 
combined with other senses or hues. Remember there is no universal hue indicating the 
ripeness of an apple. 
This thesis runs a parallel to music where no universal psychological analysis can be made of 
single notes but when combined with others we can have harmony or disharmony and moods 
created with various combinations. To take this analogy further it might be argued sensitivity to 
color is rather like sensitivity to musical notes where some individuals can tune instruments 
easier than others, some folk dream in color and some remember color easily while others 
desire to train their color discernment to high levels of sensitivity. Sensitivity to all elements of 
life is the key that opens the door to happy appreciation. The alternative is to dark to consider. 
Fig.1
The adjacent effect .... color residuals of the eye. With musical melodies we have ‘progression’. 
I mean by this intervals of time between notes that allow the brain time to understand the tune. 
If all the notes were played simultaneously any melody would be incomprehensible. But in 
painting all colors are played both individually and together, depending on the position of the 
viewer, and they must work on both levels. As the eye physically moves between adjacent 
hues, a negative residual interferes with the ‘melodic’ appreciation. Note the rather sickly Fig.1 
combination above. This can be overcome with a transitional or neutral hue as shown below. 
  or  
As a practical example ...

The psychology of color
This painting I did for the 'Bounty' series is a 
composition in blue and orange. Blue will 
naturally fight the orange if adjacent so here I 
separated them as much as possible. Even 
though the sea line appears blue meeting gold 
it is a neutral grey-black instead. The hat and 
coat are separated from the orange clouds by 
a neutral white. The notion blue always 
receeds is disproved here. 
Like a play in a theatre or an opera a painting is the creation of an illusion - of a painter's 
particular reality. The dominant hue in the painting below (blue-white) suggests a mid-morning 
scene. 
Here again, in this 
demonstration 
piece, it may appear 
blue is against the 
yellow - orange of 
the boat. But where 
they are strongest 
they are also 
furthest apart. This 
makes the painting 
easy on the eye and 
more 'melodic'. 
Stained glass windows, the paintings of Mondrian and Roualt are modern examples of strong 
colors being separated by (black) neutrals. If you feel strongly that poetry should not be 
element in the style of painting you want to attempt then you can use this information to 
introduce jarring and suddenly surprising passages to your paintings. I call this the 'Hawaiian 
shirt effect'. To understand the mechanics of color means that whatever effect you desire can

7-5 COLOR HARMONIES AND PSYCHOLOGY
Using colors and developing a color scheme for your painting is a lot easier than you think. 
Many more color combinations work than don't work. Let us think more on the music analogy 
where each note has pitch, force and length - just as in painting each color has hue, value and 
saturation.
A chord in music is a collection of notes that harmonise. Similar to music I like to think 
paintings can be composed of color chords. A painting 'chord' could then be thought of as a 
collection of colors that harmonise. But what causes colors to harmonise? 
Below: Colors of similar hue, value and saturation will harmonise just as will musical notes one 
octave apart. The colors must for they are the equivalent! 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Below: Colors of similar value and hue (but different saturation) will harmonise. Any of these 
'harmonies' can be utilised in a painting as either major or minor accents (chords). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Below: Colors of similar value (but different hue and saturation) will harmonise. This would 
describe a painting of colors with no value difference. No forms would be discernible just hues. 
We define a high key painting as one with the 'majority' of the painting surface painted with 
high value colors. Some years ago a particular paint manufacturer produced (modular) colors 
labled with their value so artists could more easily harmonise their color schemes! 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Below: Colors of similar hue (but different value and saturation) will harmonise. This would be 
equivalent to a painting done in sepia tones. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In this painting (left) red is the dominant hue. The 
Dominant hue is the 'base' color that can be slightly 
vaied by adding a little of any of the other colors red, 
blue, or yellow to slighly modify. Having this 'base' 
color in all the mixes will unify the painting and can 
be done at any stage. The deep thinkers usually do 
this progressively but others (me included) 
sometimes use a unifying glaze to rescue their 
problem painting. To be safe a lot of painters add a 
little of the one hue to every color they use even the 
highlights! Here (left) light red is the dominant hue. I 
used light red to unify all the elements even though 
some of the greys almost appear blue. This painting 
is simple in that it has just one major scheme(chord) 
- colors of similar hue. Here the light source is red-
yellow therefore the shadows appear of the opposite 
(complimentry) hue. There is an old adage in 
http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/advanced/color_psychology2.htm (1 of 4)1/13/2004 3:43:18 AM

The psychology of color No2
painting which is well worth remembering 'warm 
light, cool shadows - cool light warm shadows.' 
When considering this scheme also remember the unifying effect of the discordant note. 
Painters use this is when applying ‘spot’ compliments (opposites to the unifying hue) which, as 
in jazz music, has the effect of underlining or exaggerating the unity of the rest. In the painting 
above I could have done this by making the bird's wings greener (removing all the red from 
that hue). There is nothing psychological in this, it merely is a practical tool for the painter to 
employ if the painting seems to lack some vibrancy. Turner was the master of this effect. He 
would create a huge canvas of reds, oranges and golds then place in a strategic spot of blue - 
or vice versa. The result can have viewers circling and muttering words like genius, awe-
inspiring and unforgettable! From a painter's point of view all it requires is great control and 
restraint - holding back until that last, final, daub of pure paint. That is the real secret to 
painting with color - the understated build up, the flat featureless, bland thing that has taken 
six terrible controlled months to produce then becomes a vibrant masterpiece in the last five 
minutes. 
This brings me back to saturation. This is not, as most painters would have you believe, a post 
exhibition, or after dark activity. Saturation, sometimes called chroma, is the redness of the red 
or the difference between a pale blue and a deep prussian blue.

The psychology of color No2
My action painting of cricketers in the West Indies has highly saturated hues (calypso colors) 
but note how all their values are similar. The red is separated from the dominant green and the 
white uniforms provide the unifying force. You can get away with a lot if you utilise high 
contrast neutrals! The major chord (the green, red, blue and yellow hues of similar value) is 
played again in the white of the uniforms where it is repeated in a 'higher key'. 
When color becomes highly saturated (as in the yellow toga above) it begins to elicit more 
attention. In this painting 'Thor' I have used colors of similar hues but differing values and 
saturations. Similar blues appear in the sky breastplate and hammer, yellows in sky water and 
toga, reds in the flesh and twice in the hammer. These are all minor chords. The major chord is 
http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/advanced/color_psychology2.htm (3 of 4)1/13/2004 3:43:18 AM

The psychology of color No2
the green - red combination of similar values. 
We cannot talk about saturation without discussing value. Value is what we do when we make 
drawings and shade them. It is the method we use to define form. If drawing is ‘line’ then as 
soon as we shade that line we create value differences, and a third dimension. So the third 
element, when describing most colors, is value. Value, as stated previously, is the blackness or 
whiteness of a color (scaled 1-10). Most hues tend to darken with increased saturation. 
If you desire to make pleasing two dimensional color compositions you can do so with chords of 
equal value or similar hues. This is useful and great fun but to make a painting with 'depth' we 
will also need to match color 'values' therefore we must consider how best to 'mix' the values 
we want. Would you expect a value five red mixed in equal amounts with a value five yellow to 
produce a value five orange or a value five red mixed with a value five blue will produce a value 
five purple? 
STUDENT ACTIVITY:I asked: 'Would you expect a value five red mixed in equal amounts with 
a value five yellow to produce a value five orange or a value five red mixed with a value five 
blue will produce a value five purple?' Do this on your palette and determine the result. Also do 
the same with paints of differing values to see whether they 'average' their values. Write up 
your results. Allow 40min.

Advanced perspective distortions
5-1 ADVANCED PERSPECTIVE No.1
Roll-over perspective 
Here is a painting that utilizes a 
single vanishing point without 
unduly discomforting the eye. I 
call this roll-over perspective. 
My aim in this painting was to 
paint the total extent of the 
landscape beyond what the 
camera or the eye would see, 
and without moving the eye's 
cone of vision. 
As the landscape is essentially 
flat the illusion needed is one 
that combines (in the 
perspective mode) a plan view 
with an elevation. Also to make 
the transition as seamless as 
possible! Secondly the 
perspective scale must be such 
that the distance from tee to 
green should still appear at 
least 400 yds. 
Two essentials must be realised 
to understand how the illusion 
is completed.
First: the eye has a natural cone of vision wherein it 
can focus. This is usually about 30 degrees. Beyond this 
cone focus is lost - even though movement is 
discernable up to 160 degrees(wiggle your thumbs and 
see when they disappear). To look at my painting you 
will note I trick or force the eye to alter its cone of 
vision, when it really, is not necessary. It does not have 
to refocus to see the entire painting, but I make it 
believe it does. We are forced to look 'down' at the tee 
and 'up' at the green.The eye will refuse to do 
otherwise. 
Second: the perspective scale is distorted in that I 
http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/advanced/persp.htm (1 of 2)1/13/2004 3:43:43 AM

Advanced perspective distortions
create the impression that the observer's distance from 
the tee is defined on one scale and that the distance to 
the green is on another scale. I do this by placing 
'known' objects at strategic points. The tee, the bunker, 
the trees, the green and the flag are all known objects 
and placed such as to make the ground appear almost 
flat. For those students who have already studied my 
perspective lessons they will know the principle - as 
congurent objects receed they will be reduced on a 
proportional scale. They will realise it is this scale I 
have purposely distorted. 
My oil painting shown left is a more familiar 
example as it is arguably the most famous hole 
in golf. The tee is on a hill above the green and 
the length of hole is 155yds. It is a par 3. 
Again, under normal circumstances, it is 
impossible for the human eye to focus on both 
the green and the tee as it is for a camera to 
satisfactorily render such images. 
This is still a most beutiful landscape ... even if 
it is a golf hole and mown grass is merely an 
earthbound oilslick. If you summise I refuse to 
mow the lawn and still play a little bad golf you 
might well be on the right track!

Robin wrote: 
'I've been studying other works and trying to achieve something in the way of great depth to 
water scenes via mulitple layers of thin paint ... mostly transparent due to being so severely 
diluted with Linseed Oil. It's not quite there, so I'm now thinking of using Marine Varnish, but if 
that doesn't work, I'll have to trash the whole thing.!)'
Don't despair for this is not necessarily a matter of glazes, although they may help in certain 
instances. If you want to paint something behind something else, you might consider painting 
exactly that. Depth is achieved in the logical mind of the observer, assisted by the artist 
providing all the necessary information (clues). This is also demonstrated in my lesson on 
waves. 
Clear water has no color so it cannot be painted. All that can 
be painted is what is under it, over it,standing in it, or what 
is reflected upon its surface. After all those things are 
painted then the water will magically appear. 
Some reflections will prevent the transparency ....
Some will assist .... 
Some will describe the nature of the surface... 
To achieve great depth in water scenes you will need to paint in a 
number of layers simeltaneously. 
1. The bottom of the lake or water 
2. The reflected sky overhead. A little darker than it is. 
3. Reflected vegetation from around the shore 
4. Perhaps some lilly pads or something else on the surface. Leave a 
part where the viewer can see to the bottom. 
This 'demonstration painting' provides the simplest of examples. Construct it yourself as it will 
only take moments.

Black white and blue will make a subdued 
background. The reflection is a value darker than the 
sky. 
Wipe away the center portion and introduce a green 
bank.
The area where the bank is reflected, will be the area 
that receals the bottom of the pond. Why? The angle 
of the main light source, and the shadows of the 
overhanging bank, prevent the sky reflections.
This is where I introduce some color and blend with 
foreground.
You can also paint in some submerged sticks to detail 
the bottom, as well as some drooping reeds. Don't 
overdo it! The pond bottom can be any color that 
suits your purpose - as could the sky. I have used 
separated opposites.(see lessons on color) 
Next, paint in a figure or something else that will enable you to add aditional reflections and 
depth. As I had already used red, yellow, green and blue I used white for the shirt. You can 
paint thousands of variations on this theme. No glazes are necessary, and the basic theory is 
presented in an earlier lesson on 'sunrise and sunset'.

Painting Percy the Pelican
PAINTING PERCY THE PELICAN
Percy the Pelican was the family pet and I was asked to paint him. I said I normally don't do 
pelicans but then remembered I had a successful painting of a small wave and thought it might 
be possible to combine the two! (See 'how to paint waves', in a previous section) 
I also was reminded just how much pelicans look like old fashioned sailing ships, and I had 
painted plenty of those. 
It did occur to me however, that some of these pelicans can be quite large and intimidating so 
maybe having them sailing away from the viewer might be the thing to do. It should be a cinch 
then ... 
And so it turned out with the first painting, a great success to all the local pelican lovers. I 
http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/advanced/pelicans.htm (1 of 4)1/13/2004 3:44:57 AM

Painting Percy the Pelican
called it 'Percy and Pricilla paddle off to find a pilchard' 
Flushed with this initial success I decided to do a larger and deeper view - deeper water that is 
- so I repaired down to the river and observed the ripples and sand. I was also concerned not to 
let any background material interfere with all the information in the foreground. 
This is a larger painting with some improvements on the first with changes made to Pricilla. I 
called this 'Percy and Pricilla picnic in the pilchard grounds'.
Technically the primatura was a raw umber with a little light red and raw sienna, wiped over 
with a rag for eveness and quick drying. Next the sand was laid down with much the same mix 
only with variations and secondary sand ripples. The sky was laid down with the compliment of 
the sand with the two merging two thirds of the way up the canvas. These constituted the darks 
of the sky and sand. The next layer was lighter and wet-in-wet, as was all the painting from 
here on, with the mix getting oilier as we work forward. Some of the lighter ripples are added to 
the sand and while a lighter gray is added to the sky and worked downwards in 'figure eight

strokes' for the wave forms. This contrasts with the more vertical strokes of the sand 
reflections. Lastly the figures are painted in with a three quarter inch flat bristle brush.
Subject wise I was now on a roll and decided to add the daughter of the family where Percy was 
considered the family's pet pelican. They often fed him a ... you guessed it, a herring or a piece 
of squid. Of course the girl's name was Peggy. The painting was to be rather in the fashion of 
an intimate portrait, only on water. 
I was now becoming more and more convinced that these large birds resembled ships, more 
particularly man-o-wars, with their gunports positioned along the side looking like black 
feathers. All they needed was cannon run out ... and smoke and a few feathers ... 
http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/advanced/pelicans.htm (3 of 4)1/13/2004 3:44:57 AM

Painting Percy the Pelican
So as a final 'Percy the pelican' painting I painted the 'Pelican promontary Wars', a bloody battle 
between the red beaks and yellow beaks that all started over the fishing rights to the pilchard 
grounds. You might observe the feathers in the water and one of the redbeaks lost to the deep 
with only feet showing. That courageous bird Percy was in the van, and was one of the first to 
break the battle line of the opposition. Though wounded he quiclky recovered and spent many 
an hour on the local shore scratching lines in the sand pointing out to all his mates how exactly 
the battle progressed, and how the great victory for the yellow beaks was won. 
All but the last of the series are being made into prints. The last was done mostly for the benefit 
of the Cowdisley readers.

Painting small waves
 
PAINTING LITTLE WAVES
Remember the first lesson on the 
importance of really looking at 
things and studying them? Well 
this lesson is a reminder of that 
and will also give you an 
understanding of how a painter 
must analyze the smallest things 
so as to best understand how to 
paint them in the biggest way. 
Nothing is more important than 
understanding this. You might 
think the figures I put into the 
following painting are the key. Not 
so, it is the study of the wave that 
makes this painting unique.
 
Have you ever wondered how those bright lines on the shallow end of a swimming pool come 
into being - or when you wade in shallow waters, on a sunny day, how the patterns rippling 
across the sand are made? Well so did I. So I took myself to the seaside on a sunny day and 
looked and looked (all in the nature of an artist's everyday grind).
Right is a photograph I took so you will can see what I mean. Below is another with an 
analysis of the reflected light that operates on the surface as the eye is raised.
http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/lessons/waves.htm (1 of 3)1/13/2004 3:45:05 AM

Painting small waves
 
Note the yellow line that shows how the little blue wave top is parallel to the pattern in the 
sand. 
So, how do these bright lines form 
on the sand? Well they form 
because the top of the wave is not 
sharp, but curved like a lens and 
like a lens, it focuses the light like a 
lens(see diagram opposite).
Were the wave 'peaked' the 
difference might occur as shown in 
the second diagram. 
OK, so now we know that small waves 
are usually rounded. The more 
scientifically minded might say the were 
flattened by gravity or that water finds its 
own level.
Whatever the case I want you to consider 
the information in the photograph below 
and understand how the total structure of 
sand, wave, light and reflected light 
works and how we might transpose that 
to any painting we might do of a wave.

Painting small waves No. 2
 
PAINTING LITTLE WAVES No.2
In the detail of the wave shown opposite you may 
be convinced you are looking through the wave ... 
but this is mere illusion. My steps in painting were 
as follows:
1) Paint the whole canvas a thinned mix of dirty 
sand colored raw sienna mixed with a little raw 
umber and white. Adjust for a approx value 5 or 6. 
Let dry to the toutch.
2) With a nice runny flake or lead white with a little 
ultramarine and cobalt blue and using flowing figure 
eight horizontal hand movements create the wave 
tops.
3) Add some white to the raw sienna/umber mix and 
paint the pattern into the verticle wave surface 
making sure thet the lighter more intense pattern is 
in the shallower wave's forward edge as I have 
shown.
NOTE: Don't begin the painting until you see the 
finished article and understand all the steps ... 
particularly that to make something look as if it were 
behind someting else does not necessarily mean 
painting it that way - as in the sand 'beneath' the 
wave.

Painting small waves No. 2
 
You should now understand the absolute simplicity of the whole scene; though there are a few 
points to be noted from looking at the painting above.
1) The reflected light on the top of the waves gets lighter as it goes back (the angle of incidence 
with the horizon decreases. In other words the tops of the closer waves are slightly darker in 
value as they reflect a higher part of the sky.
2) The waves get smaller as they receed.
3) The almost vertical fronts of the little waves get darker and bluer as the water deepens. In 
other words the sand color disappears.
Every problem can be solved by a careful study of the photographs shown on the previous page 
or by another visit to the beach ... which is never a bad idea anyway!

Art lessons - learn about shadows and transparency in painting
 
3-3 SHADOW AND TRANSPARENCY
Let us recall our lesson on sunset and sunrise and remember the effect of atmosphere on light rays. Remember 
how the motes in the sky or mist intercepted the long blue rays and let the red through? 
Now we will treat that 'mist' as a piece of glass or plastic; a solid yet semi -transparent medium. 
In the first example below the reddish pigment particles suspended in the glass are sparsely arranged. As with 
the earth's atmosphere at sunset the pigment particles in the glass absorb the blue-green light rays ... and this has 
a dual effect. (Fig 1.) 
1. It reflects the red light rays back to the observer making the glass appear red. 
2. It allows some of the red rays through to strike the surface behind. Here, that surface (green), absorbs some of 
the red rays. This tends to slightly neutralize the color. If the green was stronger the shadow would become 
grey. 
 
The solid object in Fig.2 blocks out all 
the light rays and casts a theoretical 
neutral shadow. Most painters find it 
useful to paint a warm shadow if the 
light source is cold and a bluish shadow 
of the source is warm. In this example 
the greenish background and reflected 
side light prevent an altogether neutral 
effect. 
In the third example thicker glass is 
added to the center. This has the effect 
of both blocking the light and un-
saturating the red. (see previous lesson 
on saturated color) 
The principle regarding transparency is useful when painting with semi-transparent dark paint as the value and 
depth of the darks can be increased. As opposed to opaque darks, transparent dark allows light to penetrate the 
surface before reflecting back off what is underneath. This has the effect of filtering out light rays on the way in 
as well as on the way out thus allowing less of the light rays to escape and for our eyes to read richer, more 
ineresting darks.

Art lessons - learn about shadows and transparency in painting
 
 
1. Create an oval and smear with shades of red allowing a transparency around the edges. You could do this 
with a semi-transparent crimson red like alizarin. 
The rest is pure fiction and applied logic ... 
a) Light source (top left) determines the position of the shadow as well as the position of the reflected light on 
the stone. 
 
b) The highlight on the stone tell us the much. 
As it is sharply focused we know the stone is 
smooth and shiny (very reflective). Here it is a 
window - reflected twice (the second time gives 
the stone greater transparency). By its position 
we also know the window is the main light 
source for the object and a line drawn from the 
observer to the highlight would reflect at an 
angle and pass out the window. This tells us 
that the object's surface is at an angle (round) 
and that the window is high left. This 
information should tally with the position of the 
shadow. 
c) The horizontal bands on the ring band define its texture and roundness. The elliptical shadow reinforces this 
assumption. 
Here again this object is not drawn from anything real. It is a pure construction using logic and remembered 
observation. 
STUDENT ACTIVITY: Find examples of gold, silver, chrome and copper and describe them in terms of 
reflectiveness, edge and color (light hue and dark hue).

frame. How should it be done?

Art Lessons - learn design and 'instinctive' proportion
 
 
You probably have quite definite ideas about your preferred option ... and if I said I preferred No.2 you may 
decide I should seek serious counselling or some other form of professional help. 
But most paintings do have accents or points of natural interest. Sometimes these are the areas of maximum 
contrast (lightest against darkest), other times it is a color accent (hue), or in a narrative painting, it could be an 
area of high dramatic intent - or it may even be a combination of all three. There can, of course, be dominant, 
secondary and many other minor accents. The question is: where to place them within a defned space so they 
look right?
Without explaining the complexities of physics, calcalus or harmonic proportion (all of which I forgot as soon as 
I gave up my promising career as a rocket scientist - I ran out of chalk). Still, I have found the following method 
a helpful starting point for the humble painter.
1. For primary accents - corners of the center rectangle. 
 
Try and counterpoint a dominant accent with a two secondary or some minor accents (mostly outside the 
rectangle). 
Remember, everything is a balance with the relationship of all the parts to each other as they are to be 
sympathetic to the whole. Extra accents could lie on the corners of the second rectangle as shown below. 
 
Remember the diagonals are powerful lines in any composition (below).

Art Lessons - learn design and 'instinctive' proportion
 
Later you will see where spirals and curves can also assist in forming the basis of compositions. 
An example- one of my most difficult design tasks was to construct a painting to form the frontpiece of my 
tryptic (a three paneled paining). I was faced with a square to be split down the middle - upon which I wanted to 
place a single portrait. The problem was I did not want the figure to look as if it were cut in two by and axe. 
 
1.The diagonal forms the main element of the composition. 
2.The triangle forces a relief to the diagonal and is the principal construct of the figure.
3. The green and red circles are counterpoint highlights equidistant about the split just like you would balance 
weights on a seesaw (fulcrum).

How to frame your painting
 
7-5 FRAMES AND OTHER DECORATIONS
Historical developments 
It is useful to understand the evolution of the picture frame. Frames evolved from painted decorations of 
architraves and cornices that surrounded frescoes on walls and ceilings (as in the Sistine Chapel below), to 
actual plaster and timber mouldings used when oil paintings became transportable. Today frames have become 
‘stand alone’ items of mass production. 
 
From the early renaissance architectural fashion has often determined the design of frames. Popular architrave, 
cornice and skirting designs, often in miniature, formed the frame. If you desired to frame a Watteau painting, if 
you are lucky enough to possess one or one you painted yourself in the Rococco style, then you should check 
out the famous houses of the period noting all their architraves and cornices. The great decorators and designers 
of past eras were usually universally consistent in their style. This approach can be just as valid today so look to 
architraves and cornice when deciding what frame to use (see below). 
http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/lessons/frames.htm (1 of 4)1/13/2004 3:46:18 AM

How to frame your painting
 
 
I have sometimes taken to painting decorations or frames on the canvas to achieve a historical effect as in the 
following example below. 
 
From an artists point of view this allows you to paint a frame before the framer gets his hands on it. Other artists 
throughout the centuries such as Rubens, Tieopolo and Raphael have done the same often using fruit, leaves 
vines etc. as decoration. Some might argue it is a tradition worth keeping if only to keep the apprentices active. 
With the development of oil painting as a medium and canvas as its ground it became important to protect these 
new 'mobile' or moveable works of art. Obviously someone had the bright idea to make the frame perform all 
functions, protection, decoration and finally as part of some intended environment (room). All this has led to 
much confusion with a minefield of styles, frame mouldings and architecure to negotiate. 
http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/lessons/frames.htm (2 of 4)1/13/2004 3:46:18 AM

How to frame your painting
 
  
So a picture frame can have certain characteristics and many functions;
1. Protect the painting
2.Unify the painting with the architectural style of the room as in repetition of color style or other design 
elements.
3. Separate the painting from the wall.
4. Tunnel the attention to the painting so it will become the focal point of a room.- or do the reverse.
An artist may require the frame can echo all the qualities of the painting. Accents of similar texture, color, line 
or shape.
Echoes between painting and frame: 
Just as parts of a painting can relate to each other in echoes of texture, color and form so can the relationship 
between the frame and the painting. This is a relationship the renaissance artists knew well. Some of these 
relationships I demonstrate in the following example. More can be observed on the following page. 
 
This traditional example (above) only works in isolation and miniature as most eliments are fierce. However, 
texture of frame and breastplate, color values of frame, sky, armour and directional form match. The frame 
struggles to confine the painting and will only succeed if surrounded by a bland background. The frame is a 
color compliment of the painting while the gold still echoes the strong yellows.
We are now going to simplify things and examine three elements. The painting, the frame and the background.

PICTURE FRAMES 
The classic tradition of museum display is that of the Uffizi - deep gold frames on a salmon red background wall. 
This is a formula often repeated for many renaissance paintings. It is also one I sometimes use in internet gallerys - 
but mostly without the frames. For landscape paintings of high contrast and dark greens the salmon red works well 
particularly if separated by a neutral (off-white, black) or transit (gold) color.
This is a handy hint for painting as well as framing. When dealing with complementary or opposite colors red-
green or blue-orange try and separate them with a transit or neutral color. Even modern minimalist paintings of 
clashing compliments are often framed to separate them from a colorful wall. Fierce agressive paintings and color 
schemes are often impressive and eye catching - but difficult to live with. As with most art the understated is 
usually more powerful in the long run (less is more - again!) Below we examine three overall elements and their 
relationships - the wall, the frame and the painting.
Example 1. Complementary red wall green painting. Frame echoes the painting in color(darks and green-gold) and 
swirling shapes.

Example 2. Complementary colors of wall and painting with transition light gold between. 1800's style rococo style 
frame matches swirling wave. The important feature here is the 'value' differences between the frame and the wall 
and the frame and the painting.
Example 3. Complementary again. Here the frame and the picture provide a unified package where the rust color of 
the painting is made even more dominant with the matched frame. This allows the wall green to work.

Example 4. Wall and painting colors are the same and the light gold frame is the complement. Echoes of light and 
dark from painting to frame.
Example 5. Wall frame and painting colors are the same which allows the small blue and yellow accents. This 
arrangement gives the painting great depth.

MODERN FRAMES - ACCENTS AND ECHOES
When the print or painting itself is intended as a decorative item - fashion often dictates the frame. It is perilous 
in this instance to buy a finished item without checking its intended placement. All sorts of factors such as 
lighting, wall color, furniture etc. can have their unforseen effects. In this section I shall concentrate on those 
principles of framing that confine themselves to the picture and the frame. The principles of modern framing are 
the same as principles of the past but often with more of a bold fashion statement. 
Floating a painting: This is the relatively modern approach of physically separating the painting or print from 
the frame and/or the wall by the use of neutral or semi-neutral barriers such as mounts, slips or other such 
devices. The general rule here is to continually vary the widths of the divices and the distances between them.
Texture echos: ( also above)This is the repetition of a texture from painting to mount or frame.

Hue echo or tonal framing: (above) This is the name I give the practice of balancing hue values between 
painting, mounts, slips and frame.
Borders, lines and bevels: a strong border or dark line is not always mecessary as the example below 
demonstrates.
Size of frame & minimalisim: sometimes the simplest is the most effective. Here the print as well as the frame 
combine to give a three dimensional feel.

Art lessons - learn how to paint pictorial and ambiguous light
 
 
4-3 HOW LIGHT WORKS ITS MAGIC
3. FRONT, PICTORIAL AND AMBIGUOUS LIGHT 
1. Front Light - the favorite of photographers, two dimensional artists, children and colorists where 
emphasis is on color and texture over form and value. Front light can eliminate the need for shading and 
shadows (which is a pity for they are a great joy and keep many artists from wandering aimlessly about the 
streets in the dead of night). Front light is also excellent for use in portraits of unremarkable people. 
Holbein's front light portrait of a Dutch princess eventually caused the schism that resulted in the formation 
of the Church of England. Like good putty front light can cover-up many faults.
USING THE JMW TURNER FRONTLIGHT PAINTING TECHNIQUE: (From my 'Arrive 
Timor' (60" by 36") painting from the Bounty series)
1. On a prepared canvas begin with a thin glaze (stand oil/spirit medium) of yellow with touches of red and 
blue. (blue suggesting the distance, yellow the middle ground and red the foreground). These thin 'washes' 
serve as a beginning - the overal plan for solving the problems the subject presents. 
2. After drying make light compositional drawing with chalk. 
3. Lay in the large masses boldly with impasto white/color mixtures and allow to dry. 
4. Draw/paint in the forms in greater detail with a light brown (burnt sienna). 
5. Begin to add colour using glazes and scumbles. Do not fear adding white to the glazes as this can create a 
broken light effect. Build thin layers of colour on top of each other maintaining a luminous transparency to 
the canvas and the textured white below. (note - can be wiped) 
6. Apply accents and details including dark local colours as well as impasto white highlights strategically 
placed to give the effect of glimmering light. 
7. Finish the painting in the frame touching up with fresh varnish and using thin brushes to drive paint into

Art lessons - learn how to paint pictorial and ambiguous light
the cracks etc and other areas. 
THEORY : In fact this method of painting I used copys Turner but most likely had its beginnings with 
Rembrant. It gains its effect by glazing over dried impasto to other textures. Rembrant devised a method 
employing two whites; one for impasto and one for smoother passages. The impasto white was faster drying, 
probably made so by the addition of egg and ground glass, into the formulation. It was very lean, and 
consisted mostly of white lead with a minimum of binder ( a variation on Step 1 above). He began applying 
it more and more heavily (Step 3 above) as the first stage of a two (or more) stage operation which was 
finished with transparent glazes and wiping, to create fantastic special effects, the most extreme example of 
which is the man's glowing, golden sleeve in the painting referred to as "The Jewish Bride," in the 
Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. The brilliance of this effect cannot be gotten in any other way. 
By wiping the glazes off as soon as they were applied, Rembrandt and later JMW Turner were able to create 
a bas relief effect of remarkable three dimensionality as the glaze remained in the nooks and crannies (Step 
5-6 above). By glazing again, this time with transparent yellows and/or browns, instead of Ivory Black gave 
the textures a rich, golden glow (Step 7 above). 
STUDENT ACTIVITY: Look up some paint manufacturers or go to your art supplier and find answers to 
these questions. Name three oils that can be used in oil paint manufacture. What is stand oil? How is sun-
dried oil made? Name a non-drying oil. What is a varnish? What is a resin? What is a medium? Which is the 
most transparent white of those commercially available today? What medium is used for acrylic paints? 
APPLIED PICTORIAL AND AMBIGUOUS LIGHT
In the painting above 'Allegory for a time capsule - (detail)' I constructed a sky spanning morning, noon and 
night. The possibilities of broken light on the ground are immense, but still, within in their particular areas, the 
scenes must be light consistent. The transition areas, as always, pose the greatest difficulty. Here I used the 
frame divisions to create artificial boundaries but the changes of pallet (colors) and angled light made the true 
difference. Note the pyramids are lit from the right, the Venetian castle from above and the skyscrapers from the 
left.

How to make money out of painting history
  
OK, now you have learnt your craft and you want to paint paintings that you can sell either the original, 
or the copyright. This may help you buy your round of drinks at the local tavern and perhaps, at last, put 
a roof over the heads of your nearest and dearest. You might even have dreams of becoming a responsible 
member of the community, regain the respect of those outlaws and in-laws who have long since given up 
on you. How do you do this? Below are some of the methods I have employed that won't leave you feeling 
like an absolute 'quack'. 
G     FILLING THE GAPS OF HISTORY 
G     MAKING ORDINARY THINGS EXTRAORDINARY 
G     ILLUSTRATING FABLES AND LEGENDS 
G     RECONSTRUCTING LANDSCAPES OF TIMES PAST 
G     PAINTING PORTRAITS AND COMMISSIONS 
G     PAINTING FOR DECORATION
1. Filling the gaps of history 
Don't let anyone tell you this is not a legitimate endeavor for a painter. Someone once spoke thus to 
me...  
'How could you paint Shakespeare or Fletcher Christian,' they scoffed indignantly, 'did you ever meet 
them or see them? You can't just go around doing that! Anyway, they died hundreds of years ago.' 
I replied, 'I don't expect Leonardo met the Virgin Mary, nor to my knowledge did Carraviggo meet John 
the Baptist, or was Michaelangelo ushered into the presence of God for painting purposes...! I also 
expect neither Rembrant nor Rubens was present when Jesus was lowered from the cross'. And all 
these things happened over one thousand four hundred years before they were painted.' 
In fact it is the artists duty and obligation to do exactly these type of paintings and make them 
believable. Thus will we enrich history for those coming after us. 
  
First of all let's look at portraits of those folks who were not captured by photography or painters of their time. 
Perhaps most became notorious well after the event. Anyway here are two examples that have been used on 
book covers, magazines and in television documentaries from which I gained financially by my agent selling a 
limited copyright. The originals, of course, I usually retain and will will to my children.

These paintings have been copyrighted and used more than once in publications and documentaries and book 
covers. It shows that any artist still has great scope should he or she wish to properly research and produce a 
painting that is definitive in its portrayal of some event of person who presently lacks any adequate 
representation. What other 'gaps' might the 'journeyman' painter tackle? Here is a list off the top of my head: 
Milton of paradise lost fame 
The philosopher 'Gothe" 
Chaucer 
A real flesh portrait of Julius Caesar 
Sir Francis Drake 
John Paul Jones 
Christopher Columbus 
Sir Francis Drake 
Stanley meeting Livingstone 
Plato 
OK, so you can now see the possibilities should you want to research the subject matter, and have the technical 
skills to produce a painting that has both feeling, drama and definition. In my atelier my primary duty is usually 
to give students the skill so they can paint whatever style or method that might suit the period - or otherwise, 
should they determine something else is required. That is up to them and their reasoning. In this sort of work it is 
important for future copyright use that the artist refrain too much from 'stamping their personal style' on the 
work; instead making the painting identify with the time and place or the person and particular event. This 
sometimes needs much research - but the rewards are great should your portrait or work become the definitive 
one, as did my Fletcher Christian. You see it was well researched had the benefit of not looking like Mel Gibson, 
Marlon Brando or Erol Flynn! 
Beware that, like the novelist or actor, you might become so attached to some period or person it could almost 
become obsessional - as I nearly did with my late 18 century era of sail and romanticism. 
Finally you need to put these images where folk who need them can see them and this means originally on the 
web, and perhaps giving them away free (within defined parameters) to educational and other non-profit 
organizations that require them from time to time.

6. Painting Decorative paintings 
When everything else fails... So how do you do formula paintings, and what are the formulas that always sell? 
In the business we call these 'potboilers' and the problem is not in painting them it is disguising them 
sufficiently so they seem fresh and new, one off originals instead of formula paintings. 
 There are of course certain things that have universal appeal and I will show you two variations of them in this 
lesson. Understand however, this universality needs to be tweaked and adapted depending on the country or 
other demographics, like your target audience. It is a fact, for instance, that folk in the US and Europe will 
appreciate more colorful paintings than those living in South Africa or Australia who, no doubt due to an 
abundance of color and light and the absence of winter grays, appreciate that which they don't get to see a lot ... 
the more subdued hues.  
Here is our first example ... a girl frolicking in a surf on a hot summers day and pelican investigates. A universal 
desire.

How to make money out of painting deocrative pictures
The secret of selling this type of painting is to make it decorative. In other words a fashion item as well as the 
remembrance of some pleasing experience. To do this I have deliberately made it a 'high key' painting. In other 
words it has mostly light airy colors - though I do make sure the areas of contrast are there and catch the eye. 
So the secret here is mostly presentation. A decent frame matched to the painting in a decorative and 
unassuming manner (that way it will fit most homes). The painting is not designed to stop people in their tracks, 
but to create an atmosphere wherein folk are comfortable and relaxed.  
http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/lessons/formuladecorate.htm (2 of 4)1/13/2004 3:49:08 AM

How to make money out of painting deocrative pictures
To produce this type of painting (above) you will need a basic understanding of the elements of waves and 
reflections and atmosphere, but it is fairly rudimentary and is well addressed in the lessons so far. Then you will 
need a camera or sketch pad and a few summer days to sit around the beach ... of course that's the tough part!  
Another formula that seems to have a universal appeal is the one with wrought iron fences, balustrades etc. 
and flowers. In my variation it is best if the wrought iron is painted white and the flowers are climbing roses or 
suchlike. An abundance of vegetation is also helpful. Again summer and high tones are well placed but make 
sure there are areas of deep contrast that draw the eye. If you add small children and romantic remembrances of 
childhood then extra appeal can be added and the clientele and focus groups will not doubt appreciate the effort. 
 And so in this scenario I have utilized in my 'beauty and the beast' work that you see below. I deliberately 
evoked the summer Mediterranean feel so as to counterpoint the horrible 'beast'. This of course would prevent 
otherwise good sales, but then again - is fame and fortune worth all that? In the marketplace this is a dollar each 
way painting. There could be someone our there who might like both elements.  
Well, these paintings are but two variations on good and tested formulas that may make you a fortune if you 
need one. I have maybe ten other tried and successful 'themes'.

How to make money out of painting deocrative pictures
Seriously though folks, if you want to paint for fame and fortune, forget it. I have no personal fortune but I am 
usually welcomed wherever I go and I get countless invitations to address folk, talk and demonstrate my wares. 
I can never retire, my financial stability relies not on what I saved but what I may be capable of doing 
tomorrow. Otherwise I am quite happy with the paintings above. I am not raising the bar so you might be 
dissuaded from even trying some painting formula, rather you MUST do it to learn the basics. I am only 
warning you against complacency, repetition and false success. 
So I no longer paint for the lowest common denominator, though when I was stuck in Brussels, with no 
money ...

5. Commissions 
Due to 50 years of the press showing works of 'art' being made by elephants with brushes held in their trunks, 
monkeys, guys riding over canvas with bikes, kindergarten children and anyone else with no talent and no training; 
it is increasingly difficult for any member of the public to believe a professional painter should receive a per hour 
renumeration that might be similar to what a plumber or an electician might recieve should they spend an 
equivalent time at a contracted task or job.
This has become the sad lot of painters so the point must be made forcefully and prima facie before any work is 
undertaken that you expect to be paid on a scale commensurate to your study, skill and experience; at least at a 
tradesman's hourly rates. 
Here I will discuss just a few basic rules for graduated painters who intend to make a career out of commissions. 
G     Be professional. Make the client aware that your hourly rate should be adequate. 
G     Define the work: Make sure the size of the canvas, paint, the mounting and frame are all costed and defined. 
In a lot of instances it is appropriate for the client to agree to pay separately for the frame. This does not 
preclude a caveat by the artist on the type of frame to be used. I find it useful to make this provision at this 
stage. 
G     Take a deposit - at least 10%. More if you are including the frame and mention the cost of artist quality 
paints, particularly if you intend using any seriously expensive colors such a cobalt blue etc. 
G     Settle on a completion date with + or - variations for unforeseen circumstance. It it is a portrait this time 
should run concurrently with the sitting times and the sitters availability. 
G     Agree on the scene/portrait - general colors and style and if a portrait the mood and props. Don't rush this as 
it is most important. You should value a happy customer for it is from them you will get a plethora of new 
clients. 
G     Be careful the client understands that you will exercise your skills to the fullest but not all paintings turn out 
to the clients perfect satisfaction. In fact the client should be made aware there are certain risks involved that 
are separate to actual performance. 
G     If possible get your signature and your clients on a piece of paper! 
G     And never, ever, take on more commissions than you can handle. Portraits particularly, can become very 
demanding whereas commissioned landscapes are usually a joy - particularly in summer. 
G     Be professional.

4. Reconstructing Historical Landscapes 
There is a growing opportunity for painters to make a living by painting historical landscapes using old postcards 
or photographs as reference material. 
I recently experimented with this by taking three old faded, black and white postcards and reconstructing the 
landscape. They were subsequently scanned and printed and sold in the area they were painted. This could be 
done in any location should you possess the skill of an adequate landscape painter and a modicum of flair for 
color and drama.

This depicts a dry dock in the same town 1895. I applied a Turneresque look to the scene.
These paintings were also made into postcards and small prints for which I receive a small income. 
Again, the painter should not be so elitist as to spurn such work. Society has, and always will, treasure such 
efforts should they be atmospheric and definitive. With the right training a painter could always make a good 
living traveling up and down the coast, or around the country just producing such pieces of work. You might find 
the local Historical Societies are also interested in commissioning such work - they surely have a wealth of

2. Making ordinary things extraordinary 
The idea here is to take something entirely common and paint it in such a way that viewers are forced to look or 
'see' the thing in some other way. Just this morning I purchased a packet of beautiful chopsticks. My aim it to one 
day paint them in in conjunction with a fork or other eating implements. This might just question the process of 
getting food from dish to mouth. 
Anyway painting simple things is also a major obligation of any artist for it promotes lateral thinking and 
wonder. 
Such things might include: 
G     A footprint in the sand. 
G     A small wave on the beach with a shell. 
G     Cooked pasta. 
G     A map of the world. 
G     A mailbox. 
G     Beans and toast.
Look around, walk in the park, go to the seaside, there are thousands of suitable items. Below are a few examples 
of mine I have found that made successful and saleable paintings.

3. Illustrating Fables and Legends 
Painters have been doing this for ever - from cave painters to artists at the end of the 20th Century. Sadly there is 
little of it today but... this gives the versatile and patient painter an excellent chance to fill the gap! 
To understand the importance of such paintings as Gerome's 'Police Verso', shown above, one only needs to 
understand that the whole visual feel and detail of the very successful 'Gladiators' movie was, according to the 
director Ridley Scott, based entirely around such 1890's work. It is a shame Gerome is not around to claim his 
legacy. Someone who was however is H R Giger whose paintings and drawings were the inspiration for Scott's 
'Alien' movies. These works in turn related back to Goya and Blake's 19th century gothic works.  
Others might include: 
G     Any Shakespearean theme 
G     St. George and the Dragon 
G     The Pied Piper 
G     The Homeric Epics 
G     The Old Man and the Sea.

G     Any of the Myths of the Gods.
You should look toward your imagination and try and paint such paintings or perhaps marrying such legends (St.
George) to modern events as allegories as I have done with 'Perils of a Chemical Life' below. It is good practice 
to be working on one or two of such paintings in the background to your usual commissioned or current work. 
 
Beauty and the Beast (48"x48")
 
Thor God of Thunder (48"x48")
 
'Perils of a Chemical Life'(48"x48") - This is a modern day allegory based on the St.George theme where the 
knight attempts to rescue the heroin stricken maiden who appears as both the serpent and the girl.

How to make money out of painting legends
Even though this type of painting appears, a first glance, attractive to only a small market the painter should 
always remember the first rule of selling a painting: that is to produce a painting for the one person who cannot 
live without and not to paint for that 99 out of 100 people who will think it is OK. This happens regularly as 
galleries are often seduced to hang bland, mediocre works always attractive for the widest possible range of 
people. Serious collectors however always favor the definitive, unique work that has obvious craft and value. 
Should you need to appeal to wider audience this should be done with smaller works with affordable prices 
rather than quicker large paintings. Remember your small purchaser today will become your collector of 
tomorrow, so always have some smaller works priced accordingly at any showing.

Art appreciation and some definitions of 'fine art'
 
6-1 DEFINITIONS
Before you start painting you must decide on your object in learning to paint.  There are many styles and 
methods of applying paint to a surface but there are three main reasons for doing so. After you have looked at 
these reasons and the examples I have provided you should be able to follow your purpose and utilize the tools of 
drawing, color, texture and design to your best advantage. The categories are not definitive as many paintings 
encompass more than a single element - nor is any objective better or worse than any other. 
None should ever gain from a painting any dividend in excess of what the artist invests - and if he or she does it 
is a fool's profit. Sadly so many twentieth century artists hold their public in the same regard a con man would a 
victim. Even Picasso and Dali made some unfortunate comments in this regard. If we train our senses sufficiently 
they can evolve to the extent they are able to discern great subtlety. Just as a wine taster or gourmet train theirs so 
can a visual artist and it is truly a joy.' ... 
The categories are: 
 
 
Fig 3 
 
Fig 2 
1. Decoration - I want to paint because I love to decorate. 
Fig 1.(above) Here color and  proportion are made pleasing to the senses. 
Fig 2 Impressionist decoration. 
Fig 3 The use of an accent (bright red in a sea of grey) for an eye catching wall decoration 
I would have you paint decoration for the appreciation of decoration, paint subtlety for the appreciation of 
subtlety and paint messages for those looking to pictures for meaning. Why deny people their decoration, why 
deny the high church their subtlety, why deny the communicators their messages? There is no good reason—still, 
I would have the artist be all, at the same time. But if you find you cannot, just rejoice in the diversity and do not 
judge one better than the other.

2. Fine Art - I want to paint to understand and enjoy visual ideas. 
Here I will quote a respected food and wine judge, 'In summary less is more. The flavours and fragrances we 
most enjoy are the ones we only just perceive. More than that, they make us sick. Rose scent is a good example.' 
Fig 4 One of the greatest paintings of all time - sublimely subtle. The viewer knows exactly how the artist felt 
towards the subject. (note the lips slightly apart - a rarity in northern renaissance portraiture) 
Fig 5 The mystery, subtlety and the innovation in this painting makes your hair stand on end. 
Fig 6 The use of light and landscape in an allegory about painting.

  3. Message - I want to paint because I have a message to communicate. 
Fig 7. (above) Never has design, contrast and color been so forcefully used in the cause of humanity. A rare feat: 
no action photograph could ever compete. 
Fig 8 There is little decoration or subtlety in this painting titled "Executions at Portsmouth'. 
The examples are selected to best illustrate their category by single-mindedly ignoring the other two(ie. in the 
decorative category the artist has made no attempt at description nor is there any message to be had. In the 
second category decoration and message are absent whereas the message in the third category swamps 
everything else.) 
To show I am unbiased the last example in each category is one of my own paintings.
STUDENT ACTIVITY: Make you own list of five paintings nominating their categories. Note - some might 
have more than one category and if so you must name them.

6-2 ANALYSIS OF 'GIRL WITH A PEARL EARING'
What is realism? 
The real world, you say? Now that is novel. Perhaps unique. Why would an artist be interested in reality? Of 
what use is that to the galleries and museums? People don't want an exhibition of the truth. They don't want to 
see the intestines of a cow nailed to a wall. They never do, and they never did. They want magic and illusion. 
Magic to make them wonder, and illusion to transport them elsewhere. They want to see pictures that make 
them laugh and cry they want to see good and evil narratives of honour, and of misfortune, cunning, grand 
landscapes of history or intimate portraits of seamstresses and blacksmiths. They want the artist to use all the 
skill, all the tricks, the smoke the mirrors, all the alchemy and all the the magic of painting to make them 
believe.  
They would sweep realism from the wall and stamp it beneath their feet like a cockroach. Realism has an ugly 
face, you see. No you don’t want realism and neither do they. Realism is a poisoned dagger in a dead hand, it is 
the stuff of body fluids and blackened lungs. No folk want beauty, they want the spectral magic of an angels 
wings - or to see the dragon twist at the end of St George's lance - and they want to believe!  
However the painter's job is not easy. It has a long and ancient apprenticeship and it requires courage and skill. 
It is to provide the stuff of illusion, the ideals realized. Payment is usually small in coin but large substance 
when we see the wonder on the face of the child ... or some adult who makes mentions of the image made that 
dwells in that special place in the mind where people live.

Some of the most effective designs are the simplest. The head is centrally positioned. 
The horizontal line of the eyes is 'golden' approx 3:5 up the canvas. 
The two vertical straight lines provide the 'discord' to the circular patterns.  
TEXTURE 
The hard edges of the pearl (which I think is really a silver ball) eyes, and face make them all equally smooth 
and spherical. Here again we encounter repetition. The eyes and the pearl, because they are more reflective, 
have sharper and more defined highlights. The 'pearl' also shows an extra luminosity by its secondary reflection 
of the white of girls collar (Fig 3)
  
TURNING POINT (Fig 1 and Fig 2)  
The transition area from light to shadow is the key to this picture. The transition color between the flesh tones is 
the background color (Fig 1). The transition values from left to right in Fig 2 are 8-6-4-2-4. The background 
value ranges between 1-2  
EXAGGERATIONS  
The reflection of the collar on the girl's jaw shows the artist's skill but does it really exist to the extent shown 
here? What is the color inside the girl's mouth? Here it is highlighted for effect. These elements show the artist's 
deliberate and personal touch.

A study of the effects of depth of field
 
6-3 DEPTH OF FIELD
The human eye, like the camera, has a limited depth of field. In other words we focus on one level and the 
objects in front or behind are often blurred. When Deigo Velazquez painted Las Meninas he, along with many 
artists (pre-photography), painted everything in focus. This was part of the magic of painting as the viewers 
perception was thereby expanded - rather like a hologram. Today wide angle lens may produce something 
similar but unless you intend to spend hours in a darkroom it is an all or nothing solution. 
There are good lessons to be learned here and this painting by Deigo Velazquez will serve us well as it has a 
defined foreground, middle ground and background. Let's experiment then ... 
 
First I will separate the fore, middle and back grounds then utilise three focal depths and observe the results.
The essential question I ask is one of choice - what do you like most?

Ahh... you say - and why not! But don't you find the blurring unsettling? The artist would have. 
This particular painting is huge and designed as a feast or as a complete visual experience. I am merely toying 
with the work and I hereby apologise to the master for doing so. Today we may find no magic in multi-focused 
paintings but the lessons in design and emphasis are worth considering. The example in the abstract lesson is 
essentially a similar manipulation. Note: the artist painted so well that the dwarfed figure in the foreground has 
recently been diagnosed as a victim of congenital syphilis. 
STUDENT ACTIVITY: There is a painting to be made by focusing on the girl directly behind the dog as her 
head and body in this composition is located on a diagonal and in a premier design position. Find a copy of this 
painting and try it (see lesson on design and proportion for hints).

Art lesson - abstract and texture painting
 
6-4 ABSTRACT AND TEXTURE PAINTING
Many confuse abstract painting with modern painting or modern 'art'and wars and battles rage in the 'art' world 
over definitions of what is 'art'.
We are concerned here only with painting. 
 
In truth, an abstract design is one that has no pattern and an abstract painting is one that has no form. 
The painting above is not a photograph but its realism is undeniable. It has form but no pattern (repitition). 
In a previous lesson I stated 'the human mind does not 
like to be overloaded with detail, particularly in a 
painting. It revels in its ability to complete the picture 
itself. And it must be allowed the latitude (hazy bits) to 
do this. The degree you allow this will say something 
about your estimation of your proposed audience. My 
rule is to always assume they are smarter than you, in 
other words leave plenty of for the imagination.' 
This idea of involving the imagination was the genesis 
of most post 1850 art movements and 
experimentations. In the more extreme any cognisant 
feature became a disadvantage.

Art lesson - abstract and texture painting
 
When contemplating painting an abstract picture or one with symbolic meaning try and recall no one will gain a 
dividend from the finished work in excess of your input. So no cheap shots for, to rob your audience is to rob 
yourself. 
Sharpness and smudge the layered effect. 
 
Here I have taken a section from an action painting and 
blurred it before overlaying it with thin, sharp-edged black 
and white lines and shapes. This 'depth of field' 
photographic effect is relatively modern as (excepting 
Vermeer and a few others) the artists of the past insisted on 
bringing everything into focus. It must be said their clients 
often demanded this. 
TEXTURE PAINTING 
The worth of an artist was once determined by his or her ability to disguise brushstrokes and produce 'magic' 
surfaces and textures. A few - Rembrant and Titian in their later years - decided paint had a tactile quality itself 
and sometimes layered the paint to produce a separate effect. Rather like Rodin often left parts of his marble 
sculptures 'in the rough' to emphasise their other qualities. Mostly they used white as that pigment was the 
cheapest .It was also the slowest to dry and could be safely applied over the successive layers of dry thin darks. 
http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/lessons/abstract.htm (2 of 4)1/13/2004 3:51:44 AM

Art lesson - abstract and texture painting
 
This use of excessive body in paint took off with the development of cheap mass produced paint in the early and 
mid-eighteen hundreds. One of the first exponents of this 'impasto' method was Turner and his use of white. 
Turner would often sculpt some landscape element in heavy impasto, wait for it to dry then coat and wipe with 
successive transparent galzes. The depressions and cracks would fill and the highlights would realise their 
sculptured effect. Also the galze over the white would make it glow - even more so if even more galze and 
white was later applied. 
STUDENT ACTIVITY: The ultimate weapon in this texture effect is the pallet knife. If you would like to 
experiment with this you will get remarkable effects by treating your canvas like a mud heap and shovelling 
paint around with the knife. Create loose forms if you like. Stop just before the colors completely disappear into 
a mass of grey mud. Now take some pure color and with the knife gently fold it into the mixture - blending in 
some areas and in others leaving a few of the edges sharp. Be liberal with your paint but just use a small 
surface ... Allow 40min. 
Then there is the dragged dry brush or scumble effect, mainly in the distant sky (dry the oil out of the paint on 
blotting paper if you need to). 
 
Or the slick oily in the bottom half of my rose painting (adding more oil or medium to your paint).

6-5 RELATIONSHIPS, CHAOS AND DISORDER
Relationships 
We don't just paint 'things' we construct visusl relationships. Now approach a topic of which, in art 
(relationships) I have some knowledge. Obviously in life it is otherwise - single and thrice divorced. 
Back to safer ground and painting; every element in a painting can only be considered in its relationship with 
the other parts. Below in my portrait of Fletcher Christian the parts that draw the eye are usually the areas of 
maximum contrast. 
 
This portrait has three competing areas of contrast, the forehead the background and the hands. They create a 
triangle and their relationship is crucial. I am still unsure as to whether the distant light is too bright in 
relation to the other highlights. Should I dim it and draw the eye more to Christian's face? These are 
judgements of relationships. Above I have used three computer devices to analyse the design. 
. .. AND USING CHAOS 
http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/lessons/chaos.htm (1 of 3)1/13/2004 3:51:56 AM

Art lessons - learn about relationships chaos and disorder in oil painting
 
I view it like this:
Let us imagine our life as a room and the room has a partition. On one side of the partition is a continually 
moving, changing world of disorder and chaos. It is populated by all the creatures of the imagination - and 
more than a few not invited. It is a world of the surreal, of dreams and nightmares, of anti-logic and 
senselessness. On the other side of our partition we have order, logic and regular forms. The world of the 
pyramids, spheres and cubes - the world of habit, pattern and order. 
Some people are not comfortable until the partition is forced almost completely to one end of the room (90% 
order 10% chaos) while others can live in a 50/50 situation. Some will rejoice in the high chaos while others 
believe it is a factor of age, gender, right and left brain, or potty-training. Some even go so far as to refer to it 
as the Jeckle and Hyde, Don Quixote or madness syndrome. 
I believe we must live with both sides of our existence and recognize the importance of each. We need chaos 
to think laterally, to be inventive, to associate disparate ideas and concepts. That is the life blood of the 
creative idea. This is not to underestimate the value of pattern, order and habit. They are the very tools that 
allow meaning to be drawn from disorder - the foundation blocks of moral and civilized thought and the 
flame that draws the fluttering moth. 
 
You will note how, up till now, my lessons have dwelt in the rules and order side of the room in an attempt 
to understand the chaos all about us. For some this may have moved the partition a little to the side of order. 
Never mind! Just think of what you have learnt so far as your small toolbox with which you can use to 
disassemble, reassemble and to analyse whatever your imagination demands. And remember, chaos need not 
be feared, used properly it can be used to pick the problem lock. 
Experiments in color, design, form and texture are the basis of most of the art movements in the last 150 
years. Whether they were abstract expressionism, impressionism, surrealism or post-modernism they are all 
attempts at dissembling and re-assembling, of moving into chaos to hopefully discover some new meaning. 
We should all similarly experiment especially when we find order stifling creativity ... or the present art 
administration becoming institutionalized and self-absorbed. 
A study of fractals is useful when allowing the mind passage between order and chaos.

Basic oil paints - why oil?
 
6-6 BASIC OIL PAINTING
Painting in oils - what you need to know about the paint. 
You can liken making paintings with oil paints as making mud pies with 
different color mud or plaster 
Why? 
Oil paint usually has ‘thickness’ so it can be shovelled, spread, pushed, 
trowelled, brushed and scraped - just like plaster or mud. It can be flattened or 
piled up ... and much more. 
It has all these qualities if mixed correctly. Furthermore it can be made to be spread as thin as gossamer or as 
thick as clay. 
All this depends on just two things: 
a) The thinness or thickness of the paint, called its viscosity 
b) The implement you decide to use to push it around - knife, brush, stick, trowel. 
So what sort of mud or paint will we make, how dry or how runny? 
Oil paint is made up of three main elements. 
1. Pigment a powder made from ground rock or earth or root anything dry that is intense in color. 
2. Oil (medium)
3. A drier of some sort as oil sometimes takes too long (a thinner) 
You can try this: 
Go to the kitchen and get a little powdered saffron, powdered red food or 
cocoa and add a little oil (sunflower, poppy, walnut, safflower, it dosen't 
really matter which) and mix it up with a knife or spoon. You have now 
produced a genuine oil paint ( and unlike many others, one you could eat 
it without harm). Find some zinc cream (used as a sunscreen) in the 
bathroom cabinet and now you have a white oil paint - now some black 
boot polish and you have a decent black oil paint. 
If it is a little thick or hard to mix you may add a little turpentine, 
thinners or petrol which will obviously cause it to mix easier and dry 
faster. 
Note: it is usually the chemical pigment or the thinners that causes the extremely poisonous nature of most 
commercial oil paints (lead, cadmium and arsenic are old culprits). If the powder you use is unusually strong 
you might be tempted to add a filler to bolster up the mixture. This could be chalk or ground marble or some 
other neutral powder. Student oil paints usually have more filler than Artists' brands. Filler is cheaper than 
pigment so you get what you pay for!
http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/lessons/how_to_paint_in_oils.htm (1 of 3)1/13/2004 3:52:17 AM

Basic oil paints - why oil?
 
OK, so now what do we do with our mixture? If we 
had two lumps of ‘mixture’ (paint) say a red and a 
yellow and made them very oily and put them side by 
side on a flat surface they would gradually spread out 
and merge and take ages to get dry. 
So more oil will help paint to blend and merge as oil 
is also the lubricant for the pigment and helps it 
slide around on the canvas. 
How can we reverse this and stiffen up the paint? 
We could add more pigment or filler, or we could get rid of some of that excess oil. 
How do we remove the oil? By putting the mixture on blotting or absorbent paper and waiting. The paper will 
absorb the oil and a little of the pigment. Obviously to make it more runny we could add more oil and to dry 
faster and spread thinner we could add turpentine, thinners or petrol. 
Get the general idea! 
One more thing - we can also add other things that are 
mixable with oil like certain resins and varnishes 
which will make the mixture sticky and shine and 
maybe dry in a layer like a clear plastic sheet. This 
might allow what is underneath to shine through. And 
when we add a little strong pigment to this sheet we can 
maybe make what is called a ‘glaze’. Then again we 
could add some egg yolk for a 'matt' type finish.
What now?
Like a potter you have now made you clay, only in your case it is called paint. Instead of water you have added 
oil and some pigment and, instead of a wheel, you will be putting your mixture on a flat vertical surface, 
although you will mix it on a bench or pallet. There is no rush with your paint though - it is oil based and will 
mostly take a long time to dry and this you know you can control adding oil or white spirits. 
One main point before you apply your paint; if you first apply a thick layer of paint to your canvas it will take 
ages to dry because the oil will have to dry out. If you have ever watched oil dry out you could probably also 
hear you own hair growing. When thick paint dries it shrinks and sometimes cracks. So if your first layer of 
paint is very thick and you add a thin layers on top of it before it is totally dry it will crack all the layers applied 
thereafter - and as it continues to dry the cracks will get bigger - especially if the color on top is darker.
Painters prevent this by painting the thick slow drying layers last and usually begin with thin fast drying paint - 
as their background. 
'Thick over thin and light over dark' is an old painters saying.
If we don’t want to wait we can paint what is called 'wet in wet'. That means putting wet layers of paint on 
other wet layers all in the one session (or over the total time it takes the paint to dry). There can still be hours - 
or days until a ‘skin’ forms. 
This is an important point as many painters would like to finish their painting quickly and are thereby forced to 
paint 'wet in wet'. 
STUDENT ACTIVITY: See next lesson. Using someof the pigments, and oils I have mentioned make up a 
pallet of colors and paint a small picture. Allow 40min.

Basic oil paints - demonstraition
 
6-6 BASIC OIL PAINTING CONT.
This lesson is a summation of the practical demonstration I 
sometimes give to further explain some of the points made in 
the previous lesson. My purpose is to use common 
household materials to make an oil painting while my 
method of teaching this is similar to those cooking shows 
you see on TV. My desire is to familiarize the students with 
what 'might' have happened during the 'invention' of oil 
painting back in the sixteenth century and thus remove some 
of the hesitation from trying the method themselves.
The first thing I do is to search the kitchen and laundry for 
the materials I need. It is best if this is done without alerting 
other members of the household as they often don't 
appreciate your dedication to such an elevated cause.
I describe this lesson as the ultimate alchemy since we are literally going to turn base materials into gold. 
Of course the 'gold' we paint is sometimes even more valuable than the gold in the ring on you finger 
which you would discover if you tried to purchase Rembrant's 'Man with the Golden Helmet'. It would 
certainly cost more today than the helmet itself.
The main ingredients I will use for this recipe are a linen table napkin, artificial saffron, white zinc cream 
(prevents sunburn), white shoe polish, black shoe polish, a stick of blue chalk, some sunflower cooking or 
salad oil, a pack of drinking cocoa and an egg yolk. I will also use the mortar and pestle from the kitchen 
though a glass bottle would do just as well. 
http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/lessons/how_to_paint_in_oils2.htm (1 of 4)1/13/2004 3:52:33 AM

Basic oil paints - demonstraition
 
First I find an old frame and stretch the table napkin across the back and staple it in place. Remember to 
stretch from the center outwards and not from the corners in.
Next I separate the egg keeping the yolk and mix that with some of the saffron. I paint this mixture on to 
the stretched napkin. This seals the surface and gives a nice quick drying yellow surface. Those who have 
made mayonnaise will also realize that egg yolk will mix with oil if carefully added and it was most likely 
this transition that originally led to the development of oil painting anyway.
Next we can grind the colors with our pestle and mortar and mix the powder with the cooking oil making a 
thick paste. You might like to experiment here with your shoe polish and zinc cream to get variations of 
the colors you need. You will find that mixing the saffron with the white will quickly give you a rather 
powerful yellow. 
Next I selected a small silver bowl from the china cabinet (as my household is bereft to anything gold) and 
placed it where I might paint it ... in the meanwhile changing the silver to gold. Below you will observe my 
efforts. This whole demonstration should only take you an hour at most from making your paints to the 
finished article while the student can take as long as they like.

Basic oil paints - demonstraition
You will find the brush a little more difficult to handle as the pigments are much coarser than the 
commercial alternative. Still persevere and you might manage to amaze your friends if not your own 
household. After the painting dries you might find it becoming a little dull and lifeless. This is easily fixed 
with the application of some ordinary furniture polish or wax ... as has been done with oil paintings for 
centuries!
The palette 
When I started painting my palette was - red (light red), yellow (yellow ochre), blue (cobalt) and white. 
Next I needed some bulk earth colors and purchased burnt and raw sienna and similar umbers. Later I 
added some cadmium reds and yellows, a crimson, cerulean and ultramarine blue. Finally I purchased 
some transparent colors like alizarin, Italian pink and thalo blue. I stupidly have many colors I never use. 
Surface preparation 
I will usually paint on anything that will hold paint but it must be dry, flat, rigid and have a little tooth 
(roughness). Canvas will also do but it must be laid flat or glued on a board later, otherwise cracking will 
occur. I like to underpaint the surface with a couple of coats of gesso. I usually use a flat, thick, water 
based white paint with whiting or some other compatable filler to add body. If it is too thin I will 
sometimes add PVA glue to bind. If I intend to paint with glazes in the smooth finish traditional manner I 
will lightly sandpaper the surface. Make sure the surface is completely dry before using oil paints (two or 
three days).
Underpainting 
Called the 'imprimatura' or base coat. Use the cheaper opaque ground colors, umbers ochres and siennas 
are ideal, and apply thinly with turpentine.
Glazing 
Glazes allow light to penetrate the layers and enhance color. They also permit the artist to construct the 
painting in stages. I use a glaze 'medium' (the liquid to add to the paint) of oil (stand/linseed or the like) 
varnish (resin/alkyd) and sometimes a little white spirit (turpentine). Modern alkyd lacquers dry rather 
quickly and may be retarded with more oil or speeded up with the white spirit. 
Student Activity: Make a list of other common products you think might be oil based and therefore 
compatible with oil. Also nominate those common oil based products that are slow drying and those that 
dry quickly. The student should also place some small pools of various oily substances on a sheet of glass

Wet-in-wet: painting terminology
 
6-7 BRUSHES AND KNIVES AND WET IN WET 
Here is a simple little (12"x 14") painting that anyone can do if they have a favourite figure they can plonk on a 
beach somewhere. I will show you how it is done then you will be able to see what happens when you paint 
thin over thick. 
1. You will note a pinkish underpainting peeking through the waves. This is because I pre-painted the canvas 
with a mixture of light red and alizarin red with a little white to lift it up. At the time I painted this it was my 
usual background for seaside studies and I would prepare many such backgrounds all at once. When it was dry 
I went to step 2.
 
2. I squeezed out some Cobalt blue/flake white on the top half of the canvas and some yellow ochre on the 
bottom and using the flat of the pallet knife I sawed the paint back and forward across the canvas. Here and 
there I added more dollops of white to lighten them but just kept sawing back and forth with the knife. The 
secret is to blend, blend and when you think you have blended enough ... blend some more.

Obviously in some places where I mixed them a lot I made the green you can see, in other places the yellow 
dominated. I did this fairly haphazardly only lightening the effect towards the center of the painting. Where it 
gets thin the background comes through and gives us a beautiful mauve tint.
3. At this stage everything was fairly bland but I could begin to see shallow water and deeper water, sandbanks 
and dry sand,.and a shore line. I just needed to define them. Up till now the paint was fairly thick in places an 
the only painting implement I had used was a knife. Next I loaded up the edge of the knife with white/tint of 
yellow ochre and dragged it across the canvas tilting it slightly and letting the white be dragged off to form the 
waves. (See below)
Note: I placed the waves just above the sandbanks and shallow water. Why? Because waves are formed as deep 
water meets shallow water. Where the sand meets the water it gets a little darker. Observing things like that is 
what painting is all about. I have probably spent a little too much time observing little things like that instead

3. For some strange reason I sustained an interruption at this stage of this painting and it was a few days before 
I returned to it and plonked in the little girl and the seagulls. For this I used a brush and the darker colors you 
see. So what happened when the paint began to dry? (Below) Well the thin brushed on darks of the girl dried 
faster than the thicker lights of the background paint. The cracks thus formed allowed the whiter underpainting 
of the background to show through.
A few artistic points: Note how I painted a cool shadow but warmed up its center to give it a little vibrancy. 
You can do this with larger shadows. Also the costume colors and stripes I added purely for effect. The 
cadmium red needed to offset the greens in the water and the cool and warm whites for sparkle.
I have kept this picture to remind me of my stupidity in ignoring a basic principle. It also reminds me of the 
days I painted many similar paintings using this particular technique. Strangely enough they were quite popular 
in the colder climes. 
STUDENT ACTIVITY: Copy the painting above replacing the figure with one of your choice if you like.

Likely to Scumble
 
6-8 LIKELY TO SCUMBLE
As the judge remarked about my life. ‘Its like paint ... parts are opaque, parts transparent, and parts 
somewhere in between, according to how much light is able to pass through the tiny particles of your 
credibility.’ 
But he was right about the paint. It can be opaque, transparent, and somewhere in between, according to how 
much light is able to pass throught the tiny particles of pigment. Transparent pigments are like tiny colored 
crystals, whereas opaque pigments are like little colored (or white) rocks through which light does not pass. 
Example... Broken china or coal.(opaque) rubies, crushed colored glass.(transparent) Opaque paint reflects 
light directly from the surface; transparent paint allows light to penetrate beneath the surface,
Opaque paints (siennas, umbers, whites, ochres, and most earth colors generally) give a more convincing 
illusion of distance, especially when juxtaposed with a foreground which includes transparent passages for 
the darker darks. 
The student might think that in this painting (ABOVE) I used transparent paint for the sky and opaque paint 
for the foreground... the sea. The reverse is the case. I built up many passages of transparent glazes to create 
the depth of the foreground waves. The sky is done in s few earth color scumbles (great word - sounds like 
something left after a very high tide or an epithet used to describe the neighbour’s chidren) anyway the 
'scumbles' created the milky distance look I desired in the sky. With this understanding, it becomes apparent 
that transparent paint allows for the deepest darks, because the light does not bounce off the surface, but 
penetrates deeper before being reflected out to our eyes.
A scumble is a thin application of a paint whose basic nature is to be opaque but which is rendered 
http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/lessons/scumble.htm (1 of 5)1/13/2004 3:53:00 AM

Likely to Scumble
 
semiopaque by the physical thinness of the application (scumble) or by the addition of a transparent 
medium. Its thinness allows the background paint to contribute to the painting. The optical effect of 
transparent paints or glazes is to retain clarity. The optical effect of opaque paints or glazes is to lose clarity. 
Scumbling is the method of applying thin layers of opaque paint.
How is it done? In 
the example right I 
had all but finished 
the painting but I 
wanted to put in 
some beams of 
sunlight. I used a dry 
bristle brush with 
very little paint and 
dragged it across a 
surface that was 
itself dry. The idea is 
not to mix (wet in 
wet) with the 
underlying paint but 
to separate the 
particles of pigment 
as if they were 
floating in the sky. 
This is scumbling.
White, thinned with a little medium is painted over a grey of mid-value to create the pallid blue unhealthy 
look I wanted in the woman's body here (see below).

So the uses of scumbling are: To indicate atmospheric haze.
To give an illusion of greater textural softness in fabric.
To create the soft complexions of young women or children in portraiture.
For the the gauze cuffs and

shirtfront in this portrait I 
used extra thin glazes of 
opaque white over darker 
passages underneath - until 
I got the value I wanted. I 
used a bristle brush as I 
wanted a cotton gauze; if I 
desired a silk then I would 
have most likely finished 
with a sable. 
The effect on the illusion of atmospheric perspective (below). Transparent passages exhibit greater clarity, 
an optical sensation peculiar to nearby planes where the least amount of atmosphere is present between our 
eyes and the plane in question. More distant planes are viewed through more atmosphere, the density of 
which alters the colors and values to a greater extent the greater the distance involved, reducing clarity.

Example .... the boat we used in our lesson on aerial perspective.
Here we could use either of three methods to apply the opaque over-paint. We could charge up a large brush 
and work from the horizon outwards, the mixture thinning as we neared the top or bottom. Alternatively we 
could just apply it in thin controlled layers waiting for the underneath one to completely dry, trap it with a 
glaze and then apply the next scumble etc. The third method involves mixing the paint with a fast drying 
medium that would thin out the pigment particles and apply successive coats.

6-9 INSPIRATION OR HOW TO GET STARTED
Are you in and artistic Slump? 
There are two problems here depending on whether you earn you living as an artist or you do it for 
enjoyment or other purposes. In the first instance hunger and finding shelter are great motivational tools. In 
the second you need to be obsessional, like knowing you hid a bottle of Jack Daniels around the house but 
can't remember exactly where ... and it's 3am ... if only you knew where to start to look? 
I suffer both so I find I must plan ahead; 
1. Always carry a pair of scissors and be prepared to mutilate any newspaper, magazine or publication that 
comes within cutting range, and if none do, you must actively give yourself time to seek them out (10 min 
per day minimum). Be a serial cutter and cut out anything that startles, frightens, causes you to pause, gives 
you a tightness in the loins or a warm wet feeling, sinks or raises your spirits or any other strong response. 
It could well be a line or a drawing a pattern or merely a color scheme. Caution ... don't be selective in what 
you look at- and try not to be distracted by reading any of the articles. Many excellent artists have some 
difficulty with reading anyway so that is rarely a big professional problem. 
2. Put all these cut-outs in a folder. 
3. When the folder holds 20 or 30 start a new one. Don't be distracted by trying to catalogue anything ... if 
you do, then you are probably a better accountant than an artist. 
4. Try and forget about the pictures you have kept - but every now and then, as you relax at the bar, open a 
folder and look again. Not only will this make you incredibly popular it will enhance you artistic reputation. 
http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/lessons/inspiration.htm (1 of 4)1/13/2004 3:53:20 AM

Inspiration
 
Gradually certain pictures will begin to echo in your mind. They will haunt your existence like bad 
colesterol counts and you will know you must do something about them. 
Then, your artistic slump will vanish, just in time for your real torment to begin. 
Now it becomes what, how, which combination, what is the essence of the feeling and how do I paint 
(describe) it, how do I start? I had a folder here with great color schemes somewhere ... now which one was 
that....? How can I encapsulate the feeling, yet be subtle and convincing? What forms/ lines/textures/
patterns/color/ can I apply? 
But, just think; when it is all over - and if it all works out brilliantly, you can wildly celebrate, wake up 
hungover and start all over again. 
Now where did I put that red folder with the picture of Englishman on safari in the pith helmet, the Las 
Vegas showgirl and that picture of the Florida swamp ... and the tree monkey ... actually this is the picture I 
am painting at the moment. 
I reversed the explorer ...
My show girl needed a new face another 
headress and longer legs

paintings was Giorgione's 'The Tempest' - he died and neglected to name it, and for 400 years art historians

Painting glow and light
 
 
6-10 PAINTING GLOW AND LIGHT
Glow is essentially a factor of value rather than color. How is this achieved? Paint a black canvas and let it dry. 
On your finger place a little white and with small circular smudging motion apply it somewhere to the canvas. It 
should now look like a milky smudge. Next take a pinpoint of paint on the end of your finger and touch it once 
in the middle of the smudge. The result is the essence of glow, total value differential as well as the milky area 
being a transmission area that will discomfort the eye sufficiently to avoid looking to the point of the light. That 
is the why we don't want to look directly at the sun. It is discomforting. For great glow or luminosity you must 
set out to discomfort the eye, that is the secret. To do that the transition (the halo) is the key. 
Fig 1.Here are a series of milky smudges 
Fig 2. When we combine them we create our glow. Note how 
I have deliberately offset to white center in an effort to further 
disturb the eye.
Fig 3. Now I add a little color (any will do) some dark shapes 
between the spectator and the light and a halo. The halo and 
spike here are artificial - like the ones made by a camera lens 
reflection - it is not the same type of halo in the example 
below.

Painting glow and light
What discomforts the eye in painting is similar to what discomforts the ear in music. Music is a 'transition' 
experience in which time is a fixed element (beat). But the eye roves the painted surface in a manner hopefully 
controlled by the painter. The painter may cleverly force a discomfort in much the same manner a jazz musician 
will use a discordant note to lay emphasis on a beautiful (intoxicating) chord. What discomforts the eye can be 
many things, adjacent compliments, illogical form, concave mirrors or, what I mentioned above, unfocused 
edges. (Rothko used fuzzy rectangles to try and induce a extra translucent brilliance to his plain color areas - it 
is an old formula). 
Why a discomfort? Because the eye naturally avoids looking at bright objects so to paint one the discomfort 
must be artificially induced. Painting suns and moons was usually referred to as a 'brave exercise' and avoided 
by all but the most accomplished landscape artists (Turner was accomplished while VanGough experimented). 
We can never paint surfaces as light as natural light so we must use device and illusion to convince the eye what 
it is seeing is a light as it should be... that is the fun of illusion!
Painting glow without showing the light source.
Here the principles are the same with the darks superimposed over the lights.

Painting a pearly luminosity
 
6-11 PEARLY LUMINOSITY
There are two factors to consider here if your aim is to achieve that luminous pearly look that dominate certain 
landscapes and seascapes. First we must create the 'pearly' look then give it presence and dominance within a 
framework (painting). It is the nature of that presence that will make it look luminous.
So what makes a mother of pearl shell look pearly? If you look closely it is merely a high value grey-white 
infused with red, blue and yellow or 'rainbow hues' of equal and similar values (above).
To apply this to a painting as I have done below to a sky by Gerome you will see what I mean by a pearly sky. 
Obviously its use here is unsatisfactory but the principle was one destined to be developed further by the 
impressionists.
The impressionists did this exercise using short brushstrokes laden with impasto paint which produced a 
shimmering effect from a distance. You will often notice when people view many impressionistic works in 
galleries their main concern is their viewing distance - they will usually move back and forth until comfortable. 
I find it good policy to wear stout shoes when visiting such galleries.

Painting a pearly luminosity
 
  
This painting by Monet is an excellent example of an artist employing equivalent value hues, dramatic 
contrasts, and uncomfortable undefined edges to achiever that shimmering light the impressionists so loved. It is 
important to differentiate the values in the foreground from the background. While the figure of the woman may 
seem to almost merge into the sky in fact she is considerably darker. Squint your eyes to better understand the 
contrast.
Luminosity is achieved by merely pushing the contrasts until the light dominates everything (below). Many 
artists spend their life trying to make their paintings glow ... mine probably glow most when I throw them on the 
fire...
... but I never quite give up! Anyway glow isn't everything.
STUDENT ACTIVITY: Collect at least 5 examples of pictures you consider to have 'that glowing quality' and 
add them to your folder you created in the lesson titled 'Inspiration'. Allow 40min.

How to paint portraits - some practical advice.
 
6-12 PRACTICAL PORTRAITURE
A PAGE OF THEORY BEFORE THE PRACTICE 
Painting a portrait is quite a personal thing. It 
demands that the artist make some sort of 
estimation or judgement. The painting opposite a 
'detail' from my portrait of John Morgan. 
After deciding on the client (if not the sitter), why 
the work is commissioned and what scope is the 
artist allowed - you then ask yourself:
1. What is the essential character of the sitter?
2. How does the sitter view his or her own 
presence in the world?
3. Is there a pose that seems natural and 
expressive of the sitter's personality.
4. Are there clothes, uniform, jewellery, favourite 
pet, room or setting that may contribute?
5. If asked to draw a caricature of the subject 
what features would best define the sitter? 
6. Does the client have any favourite photographs 
of the sitter (this can be an excellent clue as to 
expectations - and also to eliminate the 
unwanted!)?
7. Next you must discuss size. Life size? Head 
and shoulders with or without hands? Three-
quarter or full length? Vertical, semi-reclining or 
reclining? 
After answering all these questions and getting some clear idea into your mind I usually ask if there us any role 
the sitter might like to play? What historic figure does he or she admire the most? The prospect of painting a man 
in a plain suit and tie or a woman in a business suit apalls me. Where is the joy in that? Portraiture can have 
elements of narrative, tools of trade, costume etc. Anything is possible. Painting a portrait of a carpenter
(workshop, tools, apron), airline pilot(plane, sky, uniform) or architect(building, drawing board, blueprints) is 
obvious, but think of the possibilities for an insurance salesman, banker, used car dealer or school teacher. There 
lies the greater challenge - and the greater rewards. This is where portraiture can, and should, and does transcend 
photography. The sitter must also be encouraged to imagine ... and believe. 
History teaches us a masterpiece makes the sitter famous. We refer to the Mona Lisa, Mrs Siddons or the bust of 
Madame Houdon often before we nominate the artist. Who were these people? Who was the Mona Lisa and what 
was her life? Make this point to your sitter or client as it is to future generations that the work will be presented, 
and it is to them the spirit and life and history of the sitter must be addressed. 
Practical considerations: 
http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/lessons/portraiture.htm (1 of 4)1/13/2004 3:54:00 AM

How to paint portraits - some practical advice.
 
 
Physical likeness - for me this is probably the most enjoyable - if you follow some simple rules and ask yourself 
and others the questions the cartoonist asks himself every day. Silently ask yourself (in the presence of the sitter) 
what are the most distinguishing characteristics. Then ask yourself the same question later in with the sitter 
absent. Try and remember some aspect of the person like thick eyebrows, wavy hair, big ears etc.. Also try and 
remember a mannerism like, a pose, smile or use of hands; finally return to the sitter and experiment with some 
sketches. If nothing happens don't despair just keep trying and make some more simple sketches to help you. If all 
this doesn't work start your painting regardless! 
The eyes - I make it a point of detailing the eyes (above in the portrait of Fletcher Christian as a young man). The 
eyes are the gateway to the visual world both for the viewer and the sitter. They must be as fine and detailed as 
you can achieve (unless the sitter is shy and for some reason seems to avoid looking directly).
A few hints: widen the iris to give a more open and generous face. Add some flesh color to the whites and paint 
them as if they were pearls. They must appear round. Be subtle with the highlights. One eye is not the exact 
replica of the other. Make them a little different. 
The hair - the hair usually separates the head from the background and should not be overworked. Only some 
small area showing some individual hair will suffice for an overal hairy effect. 
The mouth - if the eyes are the visual gateway, the mouth could be said to be the emotional one - the enigmatic 
smile for instance. If the mouth does not obviously describe the sitters emotional disposition then the viewer is 
forced to look to the eyes. It is the trick of the Mona Lisa. Leonardo will not allow the viewers eye to settle. He 
keeps asking the question. Be careful with the little angles at the corners of the mouth - 45 degrees is the default. 
 
The hands - adding the third element to the 'non-description' of the Mona Lisa are the hands - also in repose. No 
clue there either.

How to paint portraits - some practical advice.
 
Note how, in creating substance, Leonardo does not define many edges - neither on the hands or the face. 
The costume - sometimes I paint the costume before the hands, face and anything else. Then I save up my joy for 
later when detailing the folds, jewellery adornments etc. That part is relaxing and doesn't require the absolute 
concentration needed for flesh. 
The background - here you can tell your story or make your narrative. For best practical results try and echo all 
the colors you have used for the flesh tones and costume in the background - just echoes in hue not value. Use 
value to make the narrative. See lesson on turning points. 
A cautionary tale for the discerning student about two Dutch artists and what was fashion! 
 
Two brilliant dutch artists born 300 years apart - one whose work was appreciated and the other shunned, one 
who lived in luxury and the courts of kings while the other lived in poverty, one whose art provided happiness

and security while the others' sent him mad. Who would say one was a better artist? Here I have combined two 
famous portraits to make the one. I wonder, had they changed places, how then would they have painted?
          
 
DRAWING WITH PAINT AND THE INSIDE OUT AND OUTSIDE IN TECHNIQUES 
Inside out:
When painting a head and shoulders portrait I usually establish the rough proportions of the sitter by way 
of freehand line. I plan the future positions of the areas of maximum contrast and interest. Next I paint the 
eyes mouth and nose. In other words I work from inside the overal shapes. As I reach the boundaries I 
find they often suggest themselves. Some I might like to edge or define while others I let fade away. In 
general it is appropiate to paint inside out if the figure inhabits more than 50% of the canvas and outside 
in if it is less. 
Outside in - in painting a 'genre' picture or mural (small figures in a large painting) I carefully draw the 
shapes and figures and fill them in rather like (cartooning) painting an ancient fresco. My drawing in such 
circumstances must establish a rhythm and place (reality). 
STUDENT ACTIVITY: As I used the Mona Lisa to discuss the relationship between hands, mouth and eyes the 
student should find another example and do the same. Also find the derivation of the word 'cartoon'. Allow 40min.

7-1 PRACTICAL APPLICATION - PAINTING HAIR 
Subject: Driving me hairy 
John, 
Was writing the other day about women's hair. This one (attached) is giving me problems trying to make 
realistic ... thanks.
My reply; You are not having trouble with hair, you are just overdoing its rendering. In a painting hair is not 
drawn, it is colored! First decide the general color (try and add a repeat of some deep facial coloring) then block 
it in as if it were just another part of the face. Add a few individual hairs (not too many) as they fall across the 
forehead, or as the light highlights them. Let the rest suggest themselves. The mind of a sentient needs only the 
minimum of clues as too many becomes boring. Any study of Rembrant (in particular his self-portrait 1629) 
will sufficiently demonstrate the proper balance. 
The facial moulding in the picture you sent me is excellent! 
Block in the hair as if it were part of the face - not hair! In general try and create a dark side and a light side of 
the face with a definite turning point (see lesson on analysis - Vemeer), and don't be afraid to alter things to 
create a feeling in the finished product.

Painting hair.
 
This problem goes to the heart of painting and is better discussed with reference to the lesson called 'The Pearl'. 
We all know what hair feels like, its texture, its color, its breaking strain, and its usefulness in keeping the sun off 
our head. We can love it or hate it. We spit it out with disgust when it invades our mouth and admire it lustre and 
beauty when it cascades the bare shoulders of a beautiful woman. All this has everything, and nothing, to do with 
painting hair. As I keep pointing out the concept of something must be married with its scientific reality before 
you can truly paint it. 
Before we open our tool box of painting techniques and deal with the problem of the hair let us recall the pearl as 
it provides us with an example that explains the rules a painter uses to render convincing existence.
Are the pearls real?
Things only exist as they relate to other things. Without light (place the pearl in a dark room) the pearls will 
cease to exist. The question is - without light does everything cease to exist? Does an ant need to be a 
mathematician to know it walks on six legs? If it can only count to five does it mean it must walk with a limp?
For the painter the answer is yes. Like Einstein's famous equation light is everything to the artist, the great 
unifying constant.
In the lesson on the pearl, by beginning with the room, the window, the table, and the observer I first created an 
environment (for variation I selected objects with both curves and straight lines). It is always useful to create the 
environment first. - either in the imagination or by physical positioning. Since it is semi-reflective the manner the 
pearl interacts with this environment becomes the 'reality' of the pearl. The painter lives his or her life by 
investigating relationships between objects under the influence of light. The painter's job is the discovery of the 
general rules and their employment in creating an imagined reality - that is the joy for the boundries are endless. 
But the mortal truth you ask? Who wants the truth? Let us sweep that off the table and crush it like a bug! 
Dangerous stuff eh? No wonder artists sometimes lose their grip in reality!
Mmm ... so to paint the hair we must create its environment?
There are really only four elements in this picture. The face, hair, background and the light. Unfortunately the 
face is front lit which restricts any opportunity for secondary light effects or a nicely modulated turning point. 
First I will slightly smooth the facial contours as they will otherwise compete to much with the hair and 
background.
http://www.geocities.com/~jlhagan/lessons/practicalapplication3.htm (2 of 4)1/13/2004 3:54:17 AM

Painting hair.
Next I create a background echoing all the colors in the face and the darks in the hair. Now you can see the 
problem. As soon as the background was applied (Fig 4) the hair, although nicely rendered, becomes a foreign 
object ... and excessively light.
It is not major problem however. 
Let us separate the hair and apply a screen tint of a warm dark. Say value 2 at 50% for the more mechanically 
minded. With paint I would simply use a alizarin - raw umber glaze. Note how the texture is not lost. Saves 
work later. Next is the favourite part - soften the edges and lose some of the texture.

Painting hair.
Explanation: the human mind does not like to be overloaded with too much detail, particularly in painting. It 
revels in its ability to complete the picture without help, and it must be allowed the (hazy bits) to do this. The 
degree you allow this says something about your estimation of your proposed audience. 
My rule is to always assume they are smarter than you, in other words leave plenty of for the imagination.
Fade in fade out...
STUDENT ACTIVITY: Find two examples of paintings where detail is overdone and two more where it is 
insufficient - in your opinion! Allow 40min.

Art lessons - learn about skin-coloring in portrait painting
 
7-2 SKIN COLORS OR FLESH TONES
I wrote this lesson in response to a number of letters - to quote but one;
'Some people have difficulty mixing what are called "skin colours." I have seen portraits where no flesh tones 
were used at all (somewhat like the dutch painter example in your lesson). How do you actually decide what 
values and hues you will use for a certain person's skin tones? Do you think "cool" and "warm" colours? Do you 
decide the hue based on the shadowed colours or the colours in the light, or perhaps you use some other 
method?' 
My Reply; The meat of a cooked crab is a delicacy but the environment of the crab itself, and its food, are quite 
too revolting to contemplate ... which brings me to the skin color or flesh tones of the pale-skinned European 
and the pallet most suitable for their rendition.
My guide is this: 'find the nearest color matches to the bodily fluids, add the hues of arterial and congealed 
blood, and the blue of a good deep bruise, line them up carefully and you will have a pallet suitable for the 
finest of skins'.
Without being too specific yellow ochre, raw and burnt umber, light red, rose madder, cobalt blue and white 
seem to work well enough. Sometimes a transparent yellow and naples yellow can also be useful. Strangely, this 
pallet also seems sufficient for African and Asian skin colors. 
Painting skin color, throughout history, has been more an exercise in fashion rather than anything else. Today 
the brown suntanned flesh is attractive to the northern races while the pallid sun-shy color seems desirable 
among darker skinned people. This may derive as much from envy or our fashion industry as from anything 
else. For sexual allure the rounded shapes that denote health and vitality are probably far more powerful than 
the hue - and if they come in pairs even more so. 
 
I learned a lot by trying to paint people of various races, and by discerning the similarities as well as the 
differences. The first thing I learned was that there is no such thing as a formula for skin color. Skin has texture 
and this can alter if it is wet or dry, male or female, old or young. Skin, glistening under an oily sweat - as say 
with a 'black' body-builder - could create a totally different look than the skin of a 'white' Scottish damsel 
reclining under an umbrella in a summer country garden. How do we discriminate? Texture is a product of edge 
definition and sharpness of the reflected light (see lesson on texture). 
Whereas the body-builder may create forms like polished ebony the skin on the damsel may well be bone

colored - but we know they both have the same flesh; the same muscle and tissue structure underneath! 
We often use warm and cool tones when painting flesh. The artist's general rule is warm light - cool shadows 
and cool light - warm shadows. This is an artificial rule often used by professionals to give vibrancy to a 
painting. Note the cool bluish greys in the facial shadows below. 
 
Goya
OK, let's get specific for the anglo-saxon or white european. Forgetting the light source rose madder was the 
color the masters used for the cheeks of their feminine subjects. Yellow ochre, the siennas and the umbers were 
the base and ultramarine was usually the blue. The rest is just modulated tone. These were all mostly all 
inexpensive pigments. Today rose madder is often repalced by a colorfast alternative. This same formula can be 
applied to the darker skinned - but with the absence of most of the red hues - a little blue added to the highlights 
will also assist. 
Blood is red. Hold your hand before a powerful light and what do you see? You see a deep glowing cadmium 
red. A bruise is blue. It is the rupture of blood vessels that turn the captured un-oxygenated blood blue. Both 
effects are beneath the epidermis which in pale skin is more transparent in the European than in the African. 
Technically the red 'blush' of the cheeks or elsewhere is the red of oxygenated blood under a semi-transparent 
layer of skin (epidermis). Very rarely does the artist have an opportunity to use this effect. I did once. I painted 
a picture where the hand of the subject was directly in the way of the sun. I made the outline white, the 
secondary outline a bright red and quietly darkened the center (much like a sunset). It created a powerful effect 
and became the focal point of the painting. So much so I was enticed to forget about everything else. Dear oh 
dear! One for me and not the client. I must admit the client liked it also and kept it - and I agreed! Professional 
stupidity in many ways but at the time I needed the money.

The blue of the bruise should not be so powerful as to denote the bruise but rather the shadow shadow of flesh. 
The same blue you might use for the jaw of a close-shaved jaw. This is the warm and cold. With an alabaster 
skin tone the hint of the grey-blue is sufficient to make the shadow. See Boucher and other French artists of the 
1700's.

Above is an example of my deliberate abandonment of any warm flesh tints. The addicted girl is raised from the 
mire .... As a student I was once given white, payne's grey, raw umber and burnt sienna and told to paint a cup 
and saucer on a white table cloth. Since then flesh colors became less of a problem. Anyone familiar with make-
up (scumbling for artists) should have no problems. 
STUDENT ACTIVITY: Television has come to make most people believe flesh color is more red/orange that 
it really is. Why is that? Explain in 200 words.

6-12 PRACTICAL PORTRAITURE 4
THE PORTRAIT OF JOHN MORGAN AND GRANDSON 
John Morgan and his wife Robyn own and operate a large earthmoving and road-making company. John has 
always been a 'hands on' manager and is often happiest working alongside his men and is attired accordingly. 
His grandson Sam takes after his Grandfather, whom he follows around whenever he can. He tries to do all 
those things his grandfather does and is a born mimic in this regard. So much so John bought Sam a battery and 
gear operated little four-wheeled vehicle of his own. The three-year-old Sam is remarkable in his ability to 
maneuver his little vehicle 'just like his grandfather'. Needless to say a firm bond exists between the two.
After assembling all my sketches, color notes and photographs of the subjects I set about thinking of how 
exactly I was going to fit both into the one painting. I finally decided on an arrangement that would combine 
them by their similar facial expressions that leave no doubt as to their closeness. They are posed to look out of 
the picture as if challenging the world to view them in their space as they would view the world.

You will note the huge difference in skin-tone between the weather-beaten and tanned John, and the milky 
fairness of Sam. His skin is very pale, his eyes blue and hair fair. Nevertheless I used the same palette for both.
I began the painting with an imprimatura of raw umber which I allowed to dry. I then drew in my figures using 
charcoal. Next I worked the deepest shadows with a thin mix of raw umber and cobalt blue with a little light red 
where I wanted a little temperature variation.
Working up with a slightly thicker mixture I started blocking-in the semi-tones. This is the stage that should 
take the longest and the painter taking great care to get all the values correct. Keep working them towards the 
light by adding a higher value color as well as introducing as many interesting tonal variations you can.
Now I can work and blend my shadow planes with a thicker mix of light red, naples yellow and raw sienna 
being careful not to bring the highlights up too soon. As I am doing all this I will usually wipe excess paint from 
my brush on the canvas around the figures.
When I am satisfied with my shapes and planes I will begin to detail some of the features, mouth, eyes, nose 
and hair with a small brush and a 'long' easy flowing mixture of paint.
Now I will add the highlights to the face glasses and hair. John lost an eye in his 20's therefore the slight 
difference in the eyes.

Finally I add the simplest of all backgrounds, an atmospheric mix of light and darks composed entirely of all the 
colors I have already used. This also generally cleans up my palette nicely. 
STUDENT ACTIVITY: Print out a copy of the painting and nominate all the shifts in value by placing a 
number from 1 to 10 on the specific areas. Refer back to the lesson on colors if you are in doubt as to what is 
meant by color 'values'.

Learn to paint pearls - a basic lesson in looking
 
FIRST THE PEARL - A LESSON IN HOW TO LOOK AT THINGS
An apprentice painter might learn how to hold a brush, mix colors or how to use a palette knife, but it 
matters nothing if the same person does not learn how to 'look' at things, and to look with the eye of 
someone who wants to explain the world in terms of paint. After many years of learning to 'look' we come to 
understand the nature of things and how they relate to each other. 
This first lesson is an entertaining introduction to give you some idea of what I mean by 'looking'. Don't be 
too worried if the world I now introduce seems alien at first, because as you progress with the lessons, you 
will begin to understand that the real joy of painting is not so much occupying your hands, as truly 
understanding the laws, the lights and shades, and the memories of all the things around you. 
OK, I think I remember what a pearl looks like. Ah, its been so long between pearls. I will try to construct 
one from memory, first principles and logic. 
To begin, let us imagine the largest pearl in the world sits on a red table in a room with a blue ceiling. I am 
the viewer and I view the perl from the front while behind me is a window. Outside it is a fine bright sunny 
day. 
Now if the pearl was someone elses 'eye' we must imagine what it would see!!. 
 
It would see me, basic and a little crude - but that dosen't matter at this stage? 
 
The window in the same condition.

Together ... 
 
Add a blue ceiling, some walls and a red table (this is roughly what the pearl would see if it could see). Next 
we squeeze it into a round shape (with a computer this is easy, in a painting you would work backward.) I 
am a little disappointed at this stage as it looks rather raw and nothing like a pearl. But, staring failure in the 
eye, we must proceed (forever faithful to our logic). 
 
So lets us rid ourselves of the black edges. Then, since a pearl is not a perfect mirror, I will blur 
everything ...

Now we can and add a little milky screen (I somehow remember pearls are a little milky, aren't they?) 
 
Still too much saturated color and dark values - so maybe another yellowish screen (glaze) ... 
 
OK ; Now let's cut it out and give it a hard edge ... as it is not made of fur! (later we will look at a lesson on 
how edge effects texture) ...

Why, I'm virtually rich! So why can't a pauper have a millionaire's imagination? I expect any artist can 
always be rich beyond the dreams of mere mortals, the difficulty becomes one of keeping reality in plain 
view. 
PS. I am concerned you may think I am confusing computer graphics with oil painting. I am not as this is a 
lesson about 'looking'. In either case we must still learn the essence or nature of things before we can make 
them - using paint or computers. With our 'pearls,' as with the world, that is the starting point, and 
remember, everything exists in relationship to light and other things nearby. The rest is simple logic - either 
with a brush or computer. OK, lets look some more into the world of the painter. 
STUDENT ACTIVITY: Draw and color your own string of pearls using oil pastels or crayons. Hint ... use 
a toned paper for background. Allow 40min.
