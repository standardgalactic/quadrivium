painting and drawing software library.
Since Deluxe Paint I I  has been
bought by over 50% of Amiga owners,
we shall begin our investigation with
this professional paint program.
Deluxe Paint II
The three essentials for a painter are a
surface, a  brush and some paint.
Limited only by the memory you have
in your Amiga. you may have a page
•
•

from 320 pixels wide by 200 high to
1008 pixels x 1008 pixels. The program
normally supplies three page sizes as
your surface. The ﬁrst one is the
normal Amiga display size t h e
second, a full print page which will
print out at 8 1/12" by I I
a TV full screen size which displays to
the edge of the screen.
The normal standard of 320x200 is
easier to use since it is not necessary for
scrolling back and forth or up and
down with the cursor arrows as you
work. However, if you are working for
a print-out, choose the 320x340: if for
TV display (or for photographs of the
screen) use the 352x226 since every
little bit helps towards a good display
of your picture.
One of the miracles of the program
is that i t will display, for scrolling,
page sizes up to 1008x1008. If you have
512K, load a two colour hi-res into
low-res and work o n  i t  a t  that
magniﬁcation, using the arrow keys to
scroll, then reload into hi-res with the
format requester.
Brush
The element called brush is a major
focus of DPaint (I will now refer to it
by this name). In its simplest and most
used form it is a one pixel point used in
the freehand drawing mode, There are
tools, however which change its size.
shape and colour. A dotted line which
spreads its dots with the speed o f
mouse movement is especially useful
when combined with the GRID mode.
Out of the freehand mode you may
select a wide range of shape makers.
i.e. rectangle, circle, o va l  a n d
polygons, both single lined and ﬁlled.
A line per se may be placed under
control a s  straight, curved, a n d
disciplined. The latter word is my way
of identifying a mode that turns your
freeform drawing line into a  rigid
horizontal or vertical one when you
hold down the SHIFT key as you
draw.
Known as custom brush, the image
copying mode "corrals" a n  area
selected as a rectangle or as a freeform
shape. It may then be lifted from its
place and moved around the screen as
you may choose. This is a power/al
tool, albeit a complex one to learn and
use. Since it has the same status as a
picture, it too has its own pull-down
menu with all the functions of SAVE,
LOAD, etc, that PICTURE has. It is
the star of the PERSPECTIVE tool
which you will ﬁnd in the EFFECTS
menu.
Paint
A R T P A C K A G E S
The artist also requires paint which is
supplied under th e  aptly named
element o f  PALETTE. Yo u  have
already been introduced t o  th e
rudiments o f colour changes in the
Preferences drawer i n  Workbench.
Here you will meet the old friends that
slid from side to side and changed the
hues (that is the actual colour like red.
yellow and blue in the colour box you
had as a child) of the screen and the
characters of Workbench.
However, i n  Palette they slide
vertically and change hue, value and
saturation (or chroma), if you wish to
call saturation that). They also do this
in a funny way for an artist familiar
with paint on a palette and mixing
subtractive colours!
Additive colour mixing is the name
of this new game you must learn. Any
theatrical stage lighting person can tell
you all about it. The footlights have
traditionally consisted of a long row of
lights which alternated between red,
green and blue. Each group of these
hues was separately controlled by a
sliding dimmer. Dim down the blue
footlights and the stage became more
Yellow. I f  you dimmed the green,
magenta (or baboon ass pink) ﬂooded
the actors. D i m red and a  weird
turquoise blue (called cyan colour)
cast its pallow. When you subtract one
of the essential colours of the 11.0.B.
palette, you are left with a colour
which is a member of the subtractive
artist's paint palette o f  yellow,
magenta and cyan!
Now, let's run this ﬁlm of the stage
lights backwards t o  see how a n
additive colour mixing palette works.
Start with a blacked out stage. Bring
the red dimmer all the way up. You get
red light on the stage. Bring the green
dimmer all the way up to join the
red y o u  get yellow light on the
stage. Now, add to the red and green
light the full wattage of the blue -
voila! White light. Now that's additive
colour.

More than you bargained for?
With the colour palette requester you
not only get a wonderful red-green-
blue slide controlled mixing panel
which displays any changes on a grid
of all the colours you have in this
particular palette, but you also get a
second set o f controls which do the
same thing but in traditional colour
theory of hue, saturation and value.
The addition of controls which let
you copy one colour to another place
on the palette grid, exchange colours
on the grid or spread an array of values
and/or hues between two different
colours placed apart o n  the grid
should have been enough. The range
control is pretty handy because i t
determines what colours and values go
into your gradient ﬁlls (a favourite
tool that I use constantly). Range is
also used in the colour cycling, and 1
guess that is why it is here. However,
sinceI  have a prejudice against all the
beer signs of fake animation water falls
and forest ﬁres achieved by cycling
lights which are hung over back bars in
the USofA, I resent the inclusion of
these features in the Color Palette
Requester. I even resent its inclusion in
the DPaint program. What a m I
saying? Some day I'll see a use made of
it that will force me to eat every word
have written against cycling.
More on the screen
It is easy to think of the screen as a
blank piece of paper, but is is far more.
It may be a piece o f paper of any
colour you wish. By clicking with the
right button on the colour you wish in
the palette grid at the right bottom
corner of the screen, you set the colour
indicator box's current background
colour. Click the CLR icon just above
this and your screen is changed.
It can also be a rigid grid which
forces every alignment to agree with a
pre-set horizontal and vertical pattern
of squares or rectangles. Click the grid
icon with the right button to bring up
the gridding adjuster.
You may go further still down this
pre-set path of patterning the paper by
bringing up the symmetry requester
with a  right button click o n  the
symmetry icon. Textile designers
heaven is here.
How about another piece of paper
behind the one you are working on?
When you opened the ﬁrst page ﬁle
or loaded i n  an old picture, you
opened a second page anyway. You

have to hit key "j " to res cal it. You
ma > swap back and Forth between
these two pages by using the key •'j'
command.
One more trick in this page arsenal.
Pull down ﬁx background from the
effects menu. I t  protects you b y
forming an invisible shield over your
screen. You can mess it up by ﬁddling
to your hearts content, and then erase
all your botching with a click of the left
button on CLR icon. You may erase
only the had additions since "ﬁxing"
the background b y  scrubbing the
mouse with the right button pressed.
A word on memory
II'you are serious about graphics on
the Amiga y ou will need a minimum of
512K. The DPaint manual admits that
a megaby te is the absolute illaXiML1111
that can be used bs the program. Only
a pinched ﬁnancial situation should
deter you from that megabyte.
The nitty gritty of Key
Commands
DPaint may be approached via icons
or keys. Even when loaded by CL
with a simple call for DP,AINT. the
screen presents yo u  w i th  mouse
activated icons requesting that you
choose a screen format. Later I shall
discuss advantages o f  the different
modes o f  resolution b u t fo r now
simply OK the lo-res 320x200 with its
32 colours.
You will be instantly transferred to
the action screen which displays a
panel on the right of tool icons. You
access them with clicks of both left and
right buttons of the mouse. The menu
bar at the top of the screen is accessed
with the mouse's right button in the
usual pull down manner. The key 19
toggles o ff/o n  th e  display ed to p
menu a n d  gives you that little extra
space to draw in. The key ﬂt) toggles
off/on both the menu and the larger
space on the right used bs the tool
icons so that VOLI may draw in that
bigger space!
Now. let's get started. drawing in
all this expanded screen that you have
added by toggling ﬂO.Key"D" will
give y ou standard freehand drawing
with a built-in I pixel brush. Want a
larger brush? Key "=" increases Si7C(=
is also the + key ). Key "- " reduces the
site at any time. You may increase and
decrease the size of a brush 001 while
moving it. Change the brush's colour?
Range through the present palette
A R T P A C K A G E S
without having to move your brush.
Key "[" and key "I" to move back and
forward. Observe the brush's change
of colour.
Custom Brushes
All of the above key instructions work
with the following custom brushes.
Just as y ou chose t he single pixel brush
with a "D". you may choose to make a
rectangle brush o f any part of your
present screen image. You "cut" a
brush by key " b "  which presents a
large cross hair. Using the left mouse
button, enclose the area you wish to
make a brush of: release the button
and draw! Try the left and right
button.
Here are more changes you can
make with your custom brushes. Key
"h" and you will halve the size of the
custom brush. Ft it "h'• again and again
it halves. KeY "H " and you double the
site of the brush. Key "x" will ﬂip the
brush horizontally Ke y "y " ﬂips it
vertically and key "7 " rotates it 90
degrees.
If you change out of this custom
brush (let's say to  one of the ready
made brushes at the top of the tool box
which out select from the icons). you
can return to the last custom brush you
made by hitting key "13".
Tools for the brush
Draw a straight line with key
Hold down left button and drag to
length and position of the end of the
line.
Draw a curved line svith key "q".
Click and hold left button of mouse to
set ﬁrst end point. Move to second end
point and release. Now, move mouse
away from points to create the curve.
Press left button to draw curve, The
French artist Delacroix developed a
system of drawing with rounds. You
too can draw like Delacroix with this
curs e feature and the two tools which
will now be described.
Make a circle in line of brush with
key "c ". Set centre point with left
button, then pull out to the size you
want. Key "C " is a ﬁlled circle.
Make an oval in line with key "e"
as above. Key " E "  makes it a ﬁlled
oval.
Make a rectangle with key "r". A
ﬁlled rectangle is made with the capital
"R" key

You must return to the icon panel to
select the polygon tool. Select the ﬁlled

You must place the cursor at the
starting comer and click, then move to
the next point a n d  click again.
Continue as you outline the complex
shape and come back to the starting
place to complete the polygon, You
may stop at any point and hit the
space-bar to let the prgrain connect
that stopping point to the beginning
point.
Fill
The ﬁll tool may be accessed from the
key "1". It will ﬁll (with the colour you
have selected) any area which i s
completely enck)sed. I f  there is as
much as a missing pixel, the hill will
spill o u t  into all the surrounding
areas. What do you do then? When it

press key "Li" for undo. If you haven't
been involved i n  to o  complex an
operation a t  th e  time when this
happens. the spill will be quickly
mopped up, and you can look for the
break in the dam. It always happens to

Graphics
T
use the Amiga to produce graphics on screen and on the
printer. I started with Deluxe Paint, a copy of which you'll
have probably received with your Amiga 500. I t  is a
remarkable program but now, even more remarkable, is
Deluxe Paint 2. Can Dpaint 2 be £69.95 better than the
original? Well it depends on your requirements. If you use
Dpaint for producing two dimensional newsheets, cards or
posters then stick with it. If you are a real computer artist
then Dpaint 2 has a lot to offer you.
Deluxe paint 2
The ﬁrst difference you notice is a screen format menu which
greets you before entering the drawing screen. This menu is,
also accessible from the project menu. -and deﬁnes your
screen resolution and the number of colours available. If
you are using a 5 I 2K machine then the high resolution
screen is available but with a maximum of eight colours.
Even so. some features need to be overlayed from disk.
What is immediately obvious is the increased number of
menu options. The drawing toolbox however remains the
same. The options menu branches into a page size menu
where you can set standard (screen size), full (printer A4)
and video (whole screen without the borders). The 'print

option has been improved greatly with direct access to
settings such as black and white, grey share or colour,
portrait or landscape, full control over the aspect ratio of the
dump and the number of copies. Thankfully you can also
now terminate the dump at any stage.
From the many new drawing features I must pick out
gradient ﬁll -  an aera ﬁll with a predeﬁned gradient of
colour, top to bottom or vice versa; pattern ﬁll - where a
brush pattern takes the place of a solid colour; blend, smear
and smooth options for brush drawing; shear and bend on
brushes; perspective drawing - you can set the perspective
centre and, using the keypad, rotate around any of the three
axes and ﬁx or free an axis. The mouse moves and sizes the
brush before drawing. An anti-alias feature smooths the
jagged edges that can occur with perspective drawing. This is
the slowest of Dpaint's drawing functions but the results are
worth the wait.
Two other major new features are stencils and ﬁxed
backgrounds. When you get to a certain stage in a drawing
you can ﬁx the background. Any experiments can then be
wiped to the old picture instantly with the CLR icon.
Stencils mask certain colours on the screen so that your
airbrush tool will not effect them. This makes precise
shading and ﬁlling trivial, as oppose to the time where you
might have had to use the zoom feature to tidy up an edge.

Reso/utions arise/link with Deluxe Paint 2
Last but not least is the Deluxe Paint 2 manual, which is
a vast improvement on the old, with both reference and
tutorial sections. The disk comes with example brushes and
stencils to use in the tutorials. I am impressed by the wa
that so much more has been incorporated into Deluxe Paint
2 without sacriﬁcing its best features, ease of use and fast
operation. With numerous screens of clip art just waiting for
your personal touch, Deluxe Paint 2 is an irresistable piece
of software.
Butcher
In an earlier review I found Butcher a very useful program;
much more than just a utility mainly because of its ability to
swap between screen formats (now achievable in Dpaint 2)
and for its selective print feature, clipping and printing any
part of the screen. A new version has improved the drawing
facilities and makes Butcher a useful art package in its own
right, though it does lack features like fonts and brushes.
The palette and special effects aie very comprehensive
with features such as edge enhancing arid colour ﬁlters. The
Mosaic option now allows you to deﬁne the tiles which are
used in the redeﬁnition of the picture on screen. A 'spare'
screen is kept in memory and can be merged or swapped
with the current screen.
Anyone interested in the printing industry will enjoy
investigating colour separation and screening — a way of
producing half tones for black and white printing. Pixels on
screen are analagous to the dots which make up all the
printed material in our newspapers and magazines and
Butcher investigates how they can be manipulated.
Experimenting with a dot matrix or laser printer can
bring interesting results. If you use Pagesetter for desk top
publishing then try processing your graphics through
Butcher ﬁrst. The packages complement each other and I'm
happy to recommend the second version of Butcher as
wholeheartedly as I did the ﬁrst,
Express Paint
An interesting newcomer to the Amiga graphics scene is
Express Paint, which is instantly recogniseable on the
shelves by its huge plastic box. The package contains mostly
air but also a 3.5" disk and a neatly typeset manual. Express
Paint boasts some very interesting features, not least the
ability to create a picture larger than screen size.
I found using the software a little less than 'intuitive'
G R A P H I C S

which was disappointing because there is no doubting the
power of some of the features. The text ﬁll immediately
caught my interest, especially as it works just as well with
irregular shapes as with nice straight columns. Amiga fonts
are supported with underline, bold and italic, centred, right
left and fully justiﬁed.
As well as screen size, the number of colours in use can be
deﬁned at the start of a session. When it comes to drawing I
liked the spraycan slider control, varying the density and
spread of the 'droplets'. Rectangles, circles, arcs, ellipses and
freehand drawing in different line styles are all available and
there's a pen tool which can be sized to suit. Space can be
ﬁlled with solid colour, text or cut pattern. Cuts, patterns
and brushes can be held in libraries ready for use, and cuts
can be taken from any part of the screen. Special effects can
then be performed upon them, ﬂipping, rotating, masking
colours and so on.

wasn't able to make full use of the larger screen and I
didn't like the ﬁnish on the low resolution display. I did
however enjoy using the 'lock' option which enables the
preservation of  'windows' during drawing and picture
merging operations. The desktop publishing element does
not compete with a  specialist product like Pagesetter.
Nevertheless, use of grids, boxes, purpose drawn cuts, line
styles and text ﬁlls can manufacture a convincing and
interesting page of text.
Although I found its working awkward compared with,
say, Deluxe Paint 2, there's no doubt that Express Paint has
a number of powerful features.

called TXED  i s  suplied with the
package. The ASCII output from an
editor i s  tokenised and the code

There are two versions o f SAM
Basic; the development version and a
run time version. The run time version
can be distributed so that your own
programs can be used by others, the
development version cannot. When a

from whence your program might
RETURN a value.
Sam Basic allows extensions to
itself to be loaded. This is important
because the language is large. and if a
certain extension is not required, it can
be discarded with KILL. There's a
function which can be used from
ssrithin a program to selftest whether
any particular extension is present. If
not, it can be added on from disk. It
looks like this:
IF NOT (EXTENSION("graphics"))-
THEN EXTEND WITH "sambasic:

SHOW EXTENSIONS is available
while developing.
Key Words
SAM Basic contains a bard core of the
usual functions and keywords with
many more available as extensions.
If you aredesigning a package with

a user interface then you'll be pleased
to know that windows can be opened
and sized. Up to thirty-two pull down
menus can be deﬁned, each containing
numbered items which can be chosen
with the mouse. Keywords such as
MOUSEBUTTON and PRESS are
employed t o  i n te rp re t mouse
movements. Menu items can be added
at a later date.
I was impressed by the way SAM
Basic handles ﬁling activities. The
keywords are sensibly similar t o
AmigaDOS commands i n  some
instances. e.g. DIR, DELETE FILE
and MAKE DIRECTORY, CHANGE
DIRECTORY is very useful. OPEN,
PRINT, OUTPUT and CLOSE( ALL)
FILE(S) are used fo r reading and
writing data. READ Fl L E reads a ﬁle's
status. OUTPUT IS redirects data to a
ﬁle or device,•e.g. a printer.
SAM Basic controls graphics via
special keywords and shape tables of
simple and virtual sprites, bobs and
three dimensional drawings. WE ﬁles

dumped to a printer. Font style, width

SAM Specials
SAM Basic has a feature known as
segments. These are separate SAM
Basic programs (up to 32) deﬁned by
the main program. Any segment can
be activated with the command USE
< segment name > S A M  Basic then
goes on interpreting from line I of the
segment. Each segment has to  be
treated as a separate program, but
values can be passed between segments
via SEND MESSAGE, MSGTYPE,
etc.
A potentially very powerful feature
of SAM Basic is its ability to activate
and manage a number of tasks at the
same time. Multi-tasking is usually the
domain of AmigaDOS but SAM Basic
provides commands like TASKING
ON/OFF, D E FIN E  TA S K , T O
TASK, H OL D  and SLEEP. Th e
commands deﬁne the tasks t o  be
performed a n d  t i d y  u p  a fte r
completion, o r perhaps temporarily
suspend a taks only to return to it later.
It is left to the programmer to keep
track of which tasks are 'operational'
although there are commands like
TASK STATUS to help.
The other features which I found
useful while programming in SAM
Basic were FRE - which gives memory
status information. i.e. how little you
have! UCASES and LCASES convert
to upper/lower case in strings and
TRIMS trims spaces. CSRLINE and
POS read the current cursor position.
The only category which I found
SAM Basic weak was sound and
speech, e.g. there is no equivalent of
Microsoft's TRANSLATES which
'speaks' from a  string o f phonetic
symbols.

There is online help for each menu and
'how to' text.
On the downside the use of a disk
buffer slowed down some operations
like cut and paste (although extra
memory is a cure for this). There was a
minimum o f  ﬁve  mouse clicks
requirement for each worksheet that I
wanted to open from the data disk in

In general I found Maxiplan Plus
responsive and data entry very easy
because of the excellent user interface.
Key press equivalents are available for
many of the menu options.
The graphs are very impressive, the
database features useful and the macro
language comprehensive, which
makes Maxiplan Plus an all-rounder

Knight Or
Knight Ot
/ t h i n k  i t  was PCW or  some such
magazine that graced us  w ith the
statistic t h a t  every t e n  hours . a
commercially av ailable adventure
game i s  released f o r  a  computer
somewhere in the world.
The sad fact of the matter is that
few o f  them can ever be similar to
Knight Ore, as most adventure games
are just a quick way of making money
out of an adventure generating system
— rarely do they actually make use of a
computer's c apabilities , a n d  a
"standard" t e x t  o n l y  adv entur e
running on an Amiga would be a
terrible waste.
I think Level Nine had this in mind
when they produced Knight Ore, an
adventure supporting full graphics as
well as allowing additional input from
the mouse — it is also rare to ﬁnd an
adventure game ( in the traditional
sense) where you play one of the bad
guys. In this case, it is a loathsome Ore
called Grindgleguts.

Out o f  the three adventures that
make up Knight Orc, the ﬁrst one —
Loosed Orc is the most infuriating in
that you have to get to grips with the
adventuring system i n  o r d e r  t o
actually play the game properly. For
this reason the ﬁrst adventure is the
easiest, but after the ﬁrst level. there's
no respite from the battering the brain
gets. Having to solve puzzles. getting
out o f  mazes, avoding a slightly gay
dragon (in the archaic sense o f  the
word!), and generally keeping out of
the way  takes u p  a  lot  o f  mental
energy, not to mention cherry cokes.
The adventuring system is massive,
vou can speak to any character in the
"world", and you can even tell them to
do things — providing they are willing
to do it. After all, picking up a bunch
of keys from within an empty well is
not too much to ask of anybody. but to
stand in the was of  a charging knight
with a bloody great sword is another
matter entirely.

Impact
H
ere we have a blast from the past.
Do you remember the original game of
Breakout, where you guide a small dot
around the screen by bouncing it off
your movable bat and similarly off a
pile of bricks piled up in front of you.
Since t h e  or iginal g a m e  w a s
released nearly a decade ago. Breakout
naturally faded away' into history. as
being probably t he ﬁrst computer
game to make it into the living room.
along with ping pong and asteroids.
Following s uit after the recent
success o f  Arkanoid. Impac t is  a
version of the game for the Amiga. but
this time, i t  has  been mor e than
revamped and souped-up with a few
colours. This time, the game has been
given t h e  f u l l  tr eatment w h i c h
comprises full Amiga graphics. multi-
coloured bricks, some great sound
effects and mouse control which is
surprisingly. a  y'ery efﬁcient way' o f
controlling the bat.
But the extras don't just end there.
Every n o w  a n d  t hen a  s pinning
spanner drops down from one of the
bricks. This can be picked up for extra
points, or as part of an "accumulator'
whereby y ou c an save y our bonus
points f o r  tools and goodies which
makes clearing the screens an easier
task.
There are nine bonuses in all, but
there ar e mor e spanners, s o i t  is
possible to have more than one active
at any given time. For instance, you
can have a double width bat and a
magnet "on" at the same time, but you
can only' really have one item when
going for higher goodies such as a
missile base (!), a smart bomb and even

Impact
The sound? Well, there isn't a great
deal of scope for music in a game like
this, but there are some wonderful
sound effects such as "Genie" chimes.
The screens are all well thought
out, hut should you ﬁnd the challenge
beginning to wane. you could always
try your hand at designing a few o f
your own. This is made possible by
including a screen designer so you can
design y our own silly screens. This
makes the game more maddening —
after all, no one likes to be eaten by
their own screen do they?
Impact is a good name. It is very
playable and is instantly addictive: the
sound effects, while not being stunning
are still imaginative, and the extras
really make the game an enjoyable way
of passing the odd evening or three. If
you are old enough to have enjoyed
Breakout, then this is the game for
you.

doesn't fall into the "hole" where the
incomplete track is.
Playing the game was more of an
annoyance than any thing. The screens.
when completed, were more or less the
same, and the overall "feel" o f  the
game was very tacky. Surely, if you are
going t o  produce a  game f o r  the
Amiga, even if it is a budget one, you
are going to make sure you try to use at
least a few of the facilities the machine
has to offer. How about three or four
channels of sound, or even a few more

elsewhere" pile. Diablo isn't addictive
in any way i t  simpls' insults the mind.

Image captured in 16 grey scales
D I G I P I C
Capture real time images
from any PAL source FAST
13191Pic will capture a single picture ﬁeld in real time (1 /5Dth of a
second) from your video source.
Save all, or a clipped part of a standard 320 x 200 picture in
WI format. Take up to four images randomly or in sequence
before storing and working on them.
DigIPIc works with the standard 16 level Amiga grey scale and
it includes a unique 32 level Grey Scale adaptor — the change is
dramatic! Alternatively you can produce a still picture in 32
COLOURS by using the three red green and blue colour ﬁlters
provided.
With the powerful, menu driven software you can modify a
picture captured by the digitiser. Manipulate intensities, and
intensity gradients throughout the image for a clear result. You
can vary the contrast range, sharpness, and brightness for a
speciﬁc effect. Set the grey scale to a small number of steps for
a dramatic ﬁnish, or use EDGE to produce an image that
deﬁnes the outline of objects — create your own cartoons!
You can load your DIgiPic image into Deluxe Paint, DigiPaint,
Prism, Superbase Professional, and many other programs for
sophisticated graphics applications.
DigiPic connects to any
Commodore Amiga computer

drives for the
limiga user
CUMANAa
Silence, high reliability and fast access are just some of
the advantages that purchasers of the new high quality
external 3.5" ﬂoppy disk drive from Cumana can enjoy when
using their Amiga computers.
The Cumana CAX 354 takes its power from the host
computer and offers a full 880k of formatted storage to either
A500 owners or users of the A1000 series.
Other points to ponder are, high quality NEC 3.5" double
sided drive mechanism, 1 Mb unformatted storage capacity
and standard connectors which enable easy addition of 5.25"
drives.
For those who want to
know the real nitty gritty the seek
time (trackto track) is a superfast
3ms with a settling time of 15ms,
to really zip through your
software — and all at an
astonishingly low price. Ask
your Cumana

M U
Midi, Music
and ME!
C
been a rather strange combination -
but nevertheless, some good things
have come o u t o f  the marriage
between high technology and musical
instruments: certainly at the very top
end of the spectrum we have the CM I
Fairlight and the Syco Fairlight 11, and
probably t h e  m o s t established
computer music system -  th e
Synclavier, has been with us for some
seven years.
• Th e  problem w i th  linking a
computer to musical instruments is
one of communication. This is why in
the early eighties, a  group o f
musicians, instrument makers and
computer scientists grouped together
to create a communications protocol
enabling computers and musical
instruments to be linked to each other,
sending information to and fro in much
the same way that some networks
operate, via wire links in a chain.
The communications standard was
called MIDI and stood for the Musical
Instrument Digital Interface. This was
partly responsible for the dramatic
increase in sales of synthesizers after
1983 when the standard really started
to catch on, when musicians saw just
how useful MIDI was.
At last! The Atniga becomes a fully ﬂedged
compositional tool
By Clive Grace
Computers have always been
considered a good medium with which
to store music; there have been many
packages released for the smaller 8 bit
computers to achieve this, but none of
the ones 1 have seen managed to
achieve the simplicity with which we
associate the sheer power o f  the
Synclavier or the Fairlight.
Composition — the next big thing?
Music compusition languages are very
useful i f you are programming music
with a rigid compositional structure.
Many songwriters studios have at least
one M C L  f o r  a ssi sti n g  t h e
composition process because songs are
very formulaic. Many of the songs in
the Top 40 are based around the
standard "verse chorus, verse, chorus"
formula. Indeed, some "e a r l y "
examples o f music from around the
18th century c a n  b e  similarly
classiﬁed, but without the rigidity of
popular music (for example, the fact
that most songs are in the key of C. and
very often they conform to  a  4/4
variant such as 2/4 or 4/8).
The computer has made th e
composing process so much easier. It
YOUR AMIGA january 1988
29
has rationalized th e  whole song
writing process in much the same
way that the word processor has
revolutionized the way words are put
into a word processor -  indeed. the
music composition packages (MCP's)
and music composition languages
(MCL's) reviewed here can be seen as
the ﬁrst major packages for the 16 bit
computer to rival the sheer processing
power o f  th e  I:airtight and th e
Synclavier.
Amiga Advantages
The advantages of using an Amiga for
music composition rather then lugging
the obese processing weight o f the
Fairlight are obvious th e  lower price
and the increased performance level.
Many users do not need all of the
facilities that the Fairlight has to offer.
and while the software on both the
CM I and the Syco machines has taken
an awful long time to produce. it can
become quickly outdated by other
programmers w ri ti n g  f o r  other
machines with these facilities built in
as standard. F o r  instance, th e
Fairlight requires quite a  l o t o f

memory to store samples and the like,
but with the Amiga, these can be
stored a s  a  condensed ﬁl e  a n d
retrieved as and when they are needed
(for example, the ' F T  ﬁle format
which enables a very high ﬁle inter-
changability b e tw e e n  b o t h
applications and packages).
Everyone has t o  accept when
buying a computer system that no
matter how advanced their machine is
at the time, there will be a time when
their machine will become outdated
and outperformed. This is the case
with m a n y  o f  t h e  so-called
"professional" composing systems
currently in use in many top ﬂight
recording studios. And nowadays it is
common to see an Apple in the corner
of the studio or as part of the mixing
desk - we are now seeing the Atari ST
and musical software being given full
quotes o n  L P  sleeves as musical
"instruments" (for example Tangerine
Dream's "Tyger" has full quotes to
Atari software packages and the Atari
logo!).
In the past, composers have had to
either fork out lots o f  money for
professional musicians to play their
music for them, or have had to learn
how t o  p l a y  t h e  instruments
themselves. While this leads to a great
deal more natural playing, this can
lead t o  stilted and uncomfortable
playing techniques.
Of course some people get it right
ﬁrst time, for example Mike Oldﬁeld,
%vho recorded a great deal of "Tubular
Bells" i n  "dead" studio time b y
himself, b u t after the album was
released and made him a great success
(and a considerable amount of money)
he decided to use more musicians on
the follow up album, and who can
blame him?
There are hundreds of composers

and writers these days still beavering
away at home or in their bedrooms
who still haven't mastered their
instruments a n d  it is for these people
that computer music has so much to
offer.
eik
Modern D a y  R e c o r d i n g
Techniques
The whole ethos behind using
computer music software packages is
to make the whole composing and
recording process so much easier.
For instance, the home musician
can record a piece of music on their
home computer using it like a cross
between a digital tape recorder and a
word processor using the crummy
sounds on their home systems. They
can then hire out some very expensive
syntheziers and drum machines, or
just use the ones available i n the
studio, and then record with them. Of
course with the Amiga, you can
sample the sounds o f the particular
instruments you are using for later use,
or for the studio.
At p r e s e n t, n o  o n e  h a s
copywrighted their sounds, but soon
this will become an act of piracy just
like ripping off other people's software
(which I hasten to add is killing the
software industry). You will soon have
to get permission to do so ﬁrst.
Composing
The best way o f  approaching the
problems o f  composing w i th  a
computer is to  consider the whole
process as a bit like writing a letter
with a word processor nothing exists
until you either save a ﬁle, or choose to
print it out.
YOUR AMIGA january 1988
30
Of the many music packages
currently available fo r the Amiga,
there are some extremely good ones
available. Aegis Development has an
excellent package called "Aegis
Sonix", whilst Electronic Arts has
"Deluxe Music Construction Set",
both work on the Amiga 500 as well as
the Amiga 1000.
Of the two, the most famous is the
Aegis Sonix package; this originally
started l i fe  a s  a  package called
"Musicraft". and while this was a very
good package in its own right, there
were still some vital features missing
that Aegis saw ﬁt to include on Sonix
when they bought the rights of the
software and tracked down the author
for a rewrite.
Aegis Development has taken an
interesting approach t o  music
software, turning the Amiga into more
of a  synthesizer th a n  a  music
composition package. Th e  sound
generation capabilities are very good
to say the least, supplying a number of
tools with which to edit and modify the
existing sounds stored on the disk o f
course you can use sampled sounds
from packages like "Perfect Sound"
with Aegis Sonix.
As part o f  the software, Aegis
Sonix has a waveform editor, enabling
the user to create custom waveforms
and envelopes in much the same way
as one would o n  a  conventional
"analogue" synthesizer.
The "main area" of the program is
the staff editor. This is essentially one
line of manuscript with a Bass and a
Treble clef at the top of the screen. As
music is entered onto the staff, the bars
scroll sideways and are individually
numbered, unlike some packages that
number the bars after every ten or so.
The time signature and the key
signature follow suit as with standard

music notation. Signatures can be
from 1/2 to 9/8 and can range from C
ﬂat to C sharp,
Just below this is the scroll bar. As
you edit music, it is often necessary to
move about the score that you are
working on, and the scroll bar makes
this a very easy task. If, for instance,
you want to jump to the middle of the
section, you must place the bar to the
middle of the scroll bar - it is as easy as
pushing the mouse!
At the bottom of the screen are the
general "controls" such as Volume.
Tempo, Transpose a n d  Tu n e .
Transpose is useful, should you want
to quickly hear the results of a key
transposition, it is useful for working
out which harmony or chord to use in
a song you are building up from just a
melody.
The three icons for Play. Stop and
Repeat are used to control the music
playing. The four buttons represent
half of the available instruments. The
two buttons directly below the Bass
clef (or whatever you have chosen), ﬂip
between sounds one to four inclusive,
and ﬁve to eight. These last four are
only accessible via a MIDI Interface
and a MID I patch, more o f which
later.
Keying in music is as simple as
point to the symbol held on the middle
line, clicking the icon, and moving the
selected shape onto the right line!
Notes that are too long for the bar
in a particular time signature are tied
over to the next bar with the correct
symbol. Amazingly, there is no slur
symbol, neither is there any way o f
slurring two notes together except by
tieing two notes over a bar! This is g
serious omission, especially w i th
certain pieces of music, as all sense of
dynamics can be lost.
Some of the more esoteric modern
notation symbols are not supported.
but I  would estimate that a  good
seventy per cent of modern notation
symbols are supported within the
software, certainly there is enough to
transcribe most pieces of music across
from paper to computer.
Like the Word Processor, getting
the notes into memory is only half of
what can be done. Whole sections of
music can he copied and transferred
from bar to bar as well as from stave to
stave. This makes pieces of music like
Pachelbers Canon a piece of cake to
key in.
The Amiga as a Synthesizer
Aegis Sonix can also behave as i f it
were a  hybrid Analogue/Digital
M
synthesizer. You are given full control
over the waveform by including a
sound editor; apart from supplying a
LF0 (low frequency ocillator) and
with a  ﬁlter with a  L F0  fade out
option there is a harmonic adjustor
enabling ve ry powerful editing
functions to be made to the general
sound.
Basic waveforms include the usual
square, sine, triangle and ramp (up
and down) waves. These are saved
with your music ﬁle. but they can be
stripped off and used with other music
ﬁles and with different packages as
well.
There i s  a  four-step A  DSR
envelope generator, not particularly
generous I admit, but no worse than
many professional synthesizers of the
analogue/digital hybrid era (Prophet 5
and Jupiter 8 to name but a few classic
machines from this era).
Aegis Sonix can accept M I D I
information as an incoming signal.
Sonix can also send data to external
synthesizers with the interface, as well
as MID I controlled (or moderated)
instruments including my good old
faithful drum machine, the Sequential
Circuits "Drumtracks".
There are no problems with other
interfaces as there is a Commodore
Amiga MIDI interface standard. That
said, the Mimetics MIDI interface is a
standard implementation and works
beautifully.
Having had the good fortune o f
trying Aegis Sonix out on the Yamaha
DX-7 - the archetypal MIDI keyboard
- I was pleased to note that it not only
accepts channel information, (more
than one instrument at a time) but
patch changes as well. Octave changes,
velocity sensitivity (only on post 1984
MIDI keboards) volume, vibrato and
even the pitch bend option are all
supported - amounting t o  quite a
complete MIDI speciﬁcation as far as
the DX-7 is concerned.
Aegis Sonix i s  a  remarkably
straightforward package: t h e
demonstration programs are very
good, albeit a little too "poppy". The
sounds supplied with these programs
are good, although I would have been
a little more impressed i f they were
more realistic, especially the Piano and
the Saxophone which are awful.
Aegis Sonix has an excellent data
entry system. especially if you are not
particularly au .
symbols used i n  twentieth century
musical notation forms. Aegis Sonix
is, by contrast, very straightforward
because all you have to do is point at
YOUR AMIGA january 1988
31
the icon, select it by pressing the left
hand mouse button, move t o  the
position on the line, and click left hand
button to lay it down.
There are plenty of features which
enable cutting and pasting, probably
Aegis Sonix's strongest point.
Files are saved i n  the SMUS
format, making them easy to import to
other packages such as Deluxe Music
Construction Set and Instant Music.
Both packages are by Electronic Arts.
Concluding Aegis Sonix
In all, this package is an excellent
introduction to writing music with the
Amiga. Music notation ends up as
more or less real music notation with
a few extra bits specifying instrument
names and so on...
This is a good package, perhaps
one of the best overall music packages
I have seen in a long time. It is MIDI
compatible a n d  ca n  send eight
channels o f MID I information at a
time -  not the full sixteen channels I
grant you, but eight channels of MIDI
information are more than enough for
many peoples applications.
Deluxe Music Construction Set
On a  slightly different level is the
Deluxe Music Construction Set from
Electronic Arts. This package boasts a
full standard music notation set. It can
display more than one line of stave
notation on the screen at any one time.
It can display a limited staff depth (i.e.
no Bass clef), for instruments that do
not go down low enough (like the
violin), i t has a full MID I driving
capability and some pretty amazing
general music editing facilities.
The truth of the matter is that the
Deluxe Music Construction Set i s
probably the most professional stave
orientated composition system I have
seen o n  a n y  machine. I n  m y
experience, i t is second only to the
Synclavier's rather expensive system
which can accept input from a vast
majority of inputs.
Deluxe Music Construction Set
has a few nice facilities when it comes
to connecting the Amiga to  MID I
instruments. There are no software
patches t o  b e  use, n o  "special"
notation forms to  be added to the
beginning of the music. Deluxe Music
Construction Set is as happy to send
MIDI information as it is with its own
sounds,
Unlike Aegis Sonix, there is no
synthesizer-like wave editor in this

package. The built in samples do not
sound all that brilliant, but again, any
standard sample ﬁle such as those
from Perfect Sound can easily be
transferred across the Deluxe Music
Construction Set format by using the
'FT converter.
The Deluxe Music Construction
Set has two music ﬁle formats. Firstly
the SMUS format, which is basically
the same as that of Aegis Sonix, in that
there are no slurs supported, there are
limited tie facilities, and basically it is a
simple note on/off notation. There are
no fancy signature changes during a
piece of music which is a shame, but
this does mean t h a t  ﬁl e s a r e
transportable fr o m  o n e  piece o f
software to another.
For the options not supported by
SMUS, you have to use the "DMCS'
format, which i s  exclusive to  the
Deluse Mu si c Construction S e t
package. DMCS format has automatic
note beaming, slurring, steam reversal
and a  novel, but thorough use o f
speciﬁc key signatures (not having to
key in a sharp to obtain a natural!).
There is better control of the dynamic
range of an instrument even accepting
"dolce" in the screen, and there is even
a play "style" option, which is fun to
play with, to say the least!
The Grand Staff editor really is
rather nice, but it can be a bit tedious
to use. If you miss a key, you have logo
through the process of going to the
eraser icon, and rub out the offending
note before moving onto the next one
in the sequence.
The page layout can be altered.
This does not affect the overall size of
each individual crotchet or quaver, but
MUSIC
it attempts to cram the notes together
so that the notes are very hard to read
at times. There is no attempt to resize
the notes on the stave. Usually I select
the "page" to be around eight or nine
bar widths. I then use the staff editor as
a spreadsheet type entry system
whereby the screen acts as a window
on the music.
Copying notes is a little clumsy,
certainly clumsier than Aegis Sonix'
bar by bar method. On the whole, the
system is reasonably friendly and is
quite easily mastered, even note for
note entering i s  a  l i ttl e  ti m e
consuming.
Changing notes over t o  their
slurred equivalents is easy; (a bug bear
of mine with the Fairlight). With
Deluxe Music Construction Set, all
you do is select the "pointer" icon and
"box" in the notes to be slurred. This
should be done from the outside going
in if there are more than two notes to
be slurred together. and it works very
well -  certainly better than anything
the Fairlight can offer.
"Boxing i n " notes is the most
important editing feature there is. It
forms the heart of most of the group
move and copy operations, and it is
even used to join notes together as is
found i n standard notation forms.
Thankfully t h e  Deluxe M u s i c
Construction Se t does n o t leave
individual notes in a sort of computer-
moderated version of notated music.
Printing i s very nice with this
package! Most of the popular printers
are supported, even a laser printer,
which should give some very nice
results if used carefully.
Composing with Deluxe Music
YOUR AMIGA january 1988
32
Construction Set is easier than with
the Aegis Sonix because the writer can
see more of the surrounding music at
the same time. It is possible to see six
bars o f four stave lines, all properly
notated and all nicely lined up.
Concluding Del u xe M u si c
Construction Set
This is a wonderful package, written
for the musician with an Amiga, I
found it particularly responsive with
the DX-7 as well as other synthesizers
such as the Juno 60 etc. I was surprised
to see that i t  was quite happily
accepting most o f  the information
from keyboards with retroﬁtted MIDI
interfaces, especially those with older
interfaces tacked on, such as the
Prophet Pro-One - probably the best
synthesizer there is for bass lines!
Deluxe Music is very good with
"real" music. I have input short pieces
of music by Mozart and Bach as well as
a few interesting ones by Bartok, and
all came out looking like they came in,
which is a  good sign for a music
package boasting MIDI compatibility.
I have tried this one in a small
studio and I was amazed at the speed
with which I was able to transfer other
peoples music into the computer -
unfortunately many young bands
these days cannot read music which is
a shame as the power of this package is
completely lost on them.
By reading this review you will
realise that I have been comparing this
software with parts of the CMI and
Syco Fairlights and the Synclavier -
instruments I  have had the good
fortune to use. With the processing
power and memory o f the Amiga,
these machines will soon be toppled by
great pieces of software such as Deluxe
Music Construction Set -  they may
look pretty, but that doesn't mean to
say that they are any the less powerful!
