Thoughts on iPhone X
Love it! I had an iPhone 6s. 
I was never able to get Touch ID 
to work for me, but Face ID has 
not failed me once. It’s fast and 
easy. I don’t miss the Home 
button, and the learning curve 
to use iPhone X is easy and 
quick. The screen is great, the 
processing is fast, and it feels 
great in my hand. The only 
drawback is the same issue 
with all iPhones: The edges are 
so smooth that without a case, 
the phone will slip out of your 
hand in a second.
RONALD MENDOZA
Setup couldn’t be any simpler: 
It asks you to put your old 
phone nearby. Unlocking your 
phone is so quick. Only issue I’ve 
encountered was restoring from 
an encrypted iPhone backup, 
many problems! Shouldn’t there 
be a disclaimer with High Sierra 
ğ#“For Nerds Only”? Equally, 
would it not be a good idea to 
add a footnote: “Phone the 
Apple helpline... It’s free!”?
BERNIE McCANN
High Sierra has introduced 
more fundamental changes 
than most macOS versions 
we’ve seen for some time, and 
it’s true that this has led to 
more incompatibilities and 
glitches than usual, notably 
with games and Adobe’s 
Creative Cloud apps. If you 
can, we’d recommend cloning 
your hard drive using Carbon 
Copy Cloner and trying out 
High Sierra on the clone ﬁrst.
Digital edition
Do I understand correctly the 
digital version of Mac|Life is not 
accessible via OS X?
JOHN K. HOWE
We produce more than one 
digital edition of Mac|Life. 
There’s a fully-interactive 
app for iPad, which you’ll ﬁnd 
in the App Store, and also a 
version you can read on a Mac 
(or PC) using the Zinio app.

but that was because I couldn’t 
remember the encryption 
password initially…
CARMINE LAVINO
I ﬁnd the Animojis infantile 
and sophomoric. I couldn’t 
fathom Craig Federighi 
acting like a caricature while 
demonstrating Animoji, and 
then the applause from what I 
had considered an adult, above-
average compilation of highly 
intelligent people. Ciao for now.
MIKE VOLPE
Scare tactics
Upon receiving your latest 
Mac|Life newsletter, I decided 
to install High Sierra. But ﬁrst 
I decided to read the TechRadar 
article you linked to about High 
Sierra problems and how to ﬁx 
them. I was horriﬁed ğ so 
Is High Sierra for the hard-core user 
only? It pays to be cautious this time.

Apple denies 
Face ID issues  
with iPhone X
“Quality and accuracy unchanged”
BY LEIF JOHNSON
APPLE GENERALLY ISN’T known for releasing quick 
statements regarding rumors about its devices, which 
makes it all the more remarkable that Apple responded 
lightning-fast to a Bloomberg story claiming it scrimped 
on Face ID quality to get the iPhone X out in time. 
In an email statement to our sister website TechRadar 
rq#Rfwrehu#58/#Dssoh#ľdwo|#ghqlhg#wkh#wuxwk#ri#wkh#
Bloomberg report, entitled “Inside Apple’s Struggle to 
Get the iPhone X to Market on Time.” At least, it denied 
wkh#duwlfohġv#vshflĽf#fodlp#wkdw#Idfh#LG#pd|#qr#orqjhu#
have the “one-in-a-million” chance of failure Apple 
touted in its reveal presentation last September.
“Bloomberg’s claim that Apple has reduced the 
accuracy spec for Face ID is completely false and we 
expect Face ID to be the new gold standard for facial 
authentication,” an Apple spokesperson said.
These are strong words for a company that usually 
releases the same canned statement about how it doesn’t 
discuss rumors when these kinds of things pop up.
“Customer excitement for iPhone X and Face ID has 
been incredible, and we can’t wait for customers to get 
their hands on it starting Friday, November 3,” the 
statement to TechRadar continued. “Face ID is a powerful 
and secure authentication system that’s incredibly easy 
and intuitive to use. The quality and accuracy of Face ID 
haven’t changed. It continues to be a one in a million 
probability of a random person unlocking your iPhone 
with Face ID.”
Apple’s statement doesn’t deny most of the claims in 
the article, which purports to give an insider’s look into

Face ID uses the iPhone X’s 
cameras and 30,000 infra-red dots 
to create a 3D map of your face.

WPA2: is your Wi-Fi 
network at risk?
Proof-of-concept code exposes  
wireless security ﬂaw
BY ROB MEAD-GREEN
TWO BELGIAN RESEARCHERS 
have published details of a 
serious ﬂaw in the WPA2 
protocol, which helps keep Wi-Fi 
networks secure. Mathy Vanhoef 
and Frank Piessens of the 
Katholieke Universiteit Levuen 
in Belgium say the vulnerability 
makes it easy for hackers to steal 
passwords, read the content of 
emails, intercept bank details, or 
even insert ransomware and 
other malicious content into TCP 
packet streams — and no network 
is safe without being patched.
To prove the point, Vanhoef and 
Piessens produced a proof-of-
concept code called KRACK (Key 
Reinstallation AttaCK), which is 
able to exploit the four-way 
handshake used between client 
devices (such as your iPhone or 
Mac) and the WPA2-protected 
Wi-Fi network they’re connected 
to. The researchers even set up 
a website at krackattacks.com, 
which explains the WPA2 ﬂaw in 
more detail.
While it seems Android and 
Linux operating systems are 
particularly badly affected, 
macOS, iOS and tvOS are 
vulnerable too — just not to the 
same extent. Apple has already 
included a patch for the WPA2 
ﬂaw in its latest security updates: 
macOS High Sierra 10.13.1, 
Security Update 2017-01 Sierra, 
Security Update 2017-01 El 
Capitan, iOS 11.1, tvOS 11.1 and 
watchOS 4.1. We recommend you 
update your devices as soon as 
possible to make sure you’re 
protected. More details on the 
security updates can be found 
at bit.ly/sec_update. Apple’s 
current AirPort Extreme is not 
believed to be affected. However, 
older routers from third-party 
brands are likely to be vulnerable 
— unless they’re patched with a 
ﬁrmware update too.
Until you’ve updated your 
devices, your best bet would be 
to avoid using public Wi-Fi, or use 
a Virtual Private Network (VPN) 
to encrypt your data before it’s 
transmitted. You should also try 
to use sites that have https:// 
encryption, and connect to your 
router using an Ethernet cable.
squabbles over component 
manufacture associated with the 
iPhone X from the always dubious 
“people familiar with the situation.”
But here’s the particular line that 
Apple appears to have a beef with:
“To boost the number of usable 
dot projectors and accelerate 
production, Apple relaxed some 
ri#wkh#vshflĽfdwlrqv#iru#Idfh#LG/#
dffruglqj#wr#d#glļhuhqw#shuvrq#
with knowledge of the process. As 
a result, it took less time to test 
completed modules, one of the major 
sticking points, the person said.”
FACE THE FACTS
The Bloomberg report still claims 
that even a downgraded version of 
Face ID is likely to still “be far more 
accurate than Touch ID, where the 
odds of someone other than the 
owner of a phone being able to 
unlock it are one in 50,000.”
But Apple isn’t backing down. 
Considering its usual silence in 
situations like this, it might be 
worth taking its reply seriously.
The good news is that we’re 
putting Face ID to the test in our 
iPhone X review in this issue, 
dowkrxjk#zkhq#zh#Ľuvw#wulhg#wkh#
iPhone X following the reveal event,

the authentication system.
Wklv#lvqġw#wkh#Ľuvw#wlph#Idfh#LG#
— which is replacing Touch ID on 
the iPhone X — has become news 
for the “wrong” reasons. It also 
failed to work properly during 
the presentation given by Apple 
executive Craig Federighi at the 
iPhone launch event in September, 
although Apple said this was due 
to other people handling the phone 
prior to the presentation. In essence, 
it said, Federighi’s troubles were 
proof that Face ID was working “as 
it was designed to.”
Apple’s AirPort Extreme is not affected 
by the WPA2 vulnerability.

Apps can ﬁlm and take pictures of you 
— thanks to iOS camera permissions
BY ROB MEAD-GREEN
GOOGLE ENGINEER FELIX Krause 
has detailed a vulnerability in iOS 
that means any app with permission 
to use the camera on your iPhone or 
lSdg#fdq#vhfuhwo|#Ľop#|rx#ru#wdnh#
pictures of you — whether you are 
aware of it or not.
The problem stems from the fact 
that once you give an app permission 
to access your camera, it can do so 
at any time provided that it’s in the 
foreground… and Krause has 
created a demo social 
advantage of your iPhone or iPad’s

the built-in Camera app, and to use

wkdq#jlylqj#lw#eodqnhw#dffhvv#wr#
either the contents of your Photos 
library or your camera roll. 
The other way, of course, is to 
cover the camera on your device 
when you’re not expressly using it by 
buying a camera cover, or placing a 
piece of insulation tape or even a

He runs the website Finer Things in Tech (ﬁnerthings.in) and hosts its podcast, The Finer Things In.
T
EN YEARS AGO, when the 
iPhone had just launched and 
many of us were still carrying 
iPods, Apple was far from 
anything you could call “the 
largest company in tech.” Today, 
by measures such as market cap, 
Apple is the most successful 
company in the world. While this 
might be largely attributable to the 
success of the iPhone and iPad, the 
Mac is still core to Apple and its 
customers. But is it still unique 
and relevant enough to the broader 
industry? The answer might not be 
as straightforward as you think.
I’m not going to compare specs 
or toss out a storm of confusing 
acronyms. But in the big picture, 
the personal computing landscape 
has changed dramatically over just 
wkh#sdvw#ghfdgh1#Pxfk#ri#rxu#Ľoh#
storage and collaboration has 
moved to “The Cloud” — apps 
and services that support most 
major platforms, or at least run 
in platform-agnostic browsers. 
Sometimes there are feature 
discrepancies. One app might have 
more up-to-date support on Mac, 
iPhone, or iPad, while another 
launches new features on Windows 
dqg#Dqgurlg#Ľuvw/#wkhq#Dssoh#odwhu1#
The point is that, depending on 
your line of work or play, it might 
be easier than ever to not have to 
care about the maker or operating 
system of the device you’re using.
On the hardware side, Apple 
switched the Mac from niche, 
increasingly outpaced PowerPC 
processors to Intel, the same kind 
of processors that dominated its 
Windows-powered competitors. 
Between 2005 and 2007, the inside 
of the Mac changed to resemble its 
rivals more than ever.
However, if you will allow me to 
ulļ#rļ#dq#rog#vd|lqj/#d#Pdf#lv#pruh#
than the sum of its parts. I think 
that’s true now more than ever. 
While Apple has long played the 
game of comparing hardware 
specs, it has always focused more 
on building great tools with that 
hardware. Anyone can buy or build 
a fast car. Only a driver can drive it.
The Mac will probably never 
appeal to everyone, whether 
because of Apple’s focus on the 
premium end of the market or a 
sheer dislike or misunderstanding 
of the company. But Apple’s 
strength lies in the platforms it 
builds on top of its hardware, and 
the appeal of those platforms is 
rooted in thousands of little details 
— from industry-leading features, 
such as out-of-the-box cross-app 
integrations, to the exceptional 
development tools it provides to 
the developer community. Apple 
didn’t just turn the Mac into a 
great software platform, it grew 
the Mac into a compelling platform 
for platforms to thrive.
Apple’s standing isn’t all about iOS devices, 
says DAVID CHARTIER — the Mac is still 
core to the company and its customers

Moore’s 
Law isn’t 
working
Making processors 
is getting harder
BY ROB MEAD-GREEN
MOORE’S LAW, WHICH states 
that the number of transistors in 
an integrated circuit (typically a 
processor) will double every two 
years, is no longer true — or so says 
Morris Chang, CEO of the Taiwan 
Semiconductor Manufacturing 
Company (TSMC), which makes 
Apple’s A11 Bionic chip for the 
iPhone 8, 8 Plus and X.
Chang made the comment at 
a technology forum to celebrate 
the company’s 30th anniversary, 
stating that while transistor density 
will continue to increase, it won’t 
increase at the same rate as it has 
until now — and that the year 2025 
will be a major challenge. 
Some kind of slowdown seems 
inevitable. Recent CPU updates 
from Intel, such as Kaby Lake, have 
focused more on energy efﬁciency 
than pure processing grunt, and 
Intel is struggling to move to a 
10nm process, which will enable it 
to squeeze even more transistors 
on to a processor die. Consequently 
its “Cannonlake” architecture is 
being pushed back to 2018.
Intel co-founder Gordon Moore 
made the observation about 
transistors in 1965, and it proved to 
be correct for decades afterward.

CLEANING. DECLUTTERING. 
TIDYING. In the real world, 
these things can be a hassle, 
but you at least have the 
advantage of knowing when to do them. 
(Hint: If you can’t get into a room for the 
piles of boxes and other rubbish, or can 
draw in the dust atop your surfaces, it’s 
time.) In the world of computing, 
however, clutter can be largely invisible.
Over the years, digital cruft builds up 
as you install new apps, moving your Mac 
further away from its pristine factory-
iuhvk#vwdwh1#Dqg#dv#|rx#judgxdoo|#Ľoo#lwv#
drive with new documents, only Finder’s 
status bar, assuming you have it turned 
on, provides any real indication of the 
current state of play regarding available 
storage. But, sooner or later, you’ll get a 
dreaded warning that your Mac’s running 
low on free space.
We’ve all been there — although most 
of us never get as bad as one Mac|Life 
writer, who discovered one time that 
there wasn’t enough room on his Mac 
to even take a single screenshot.
And sometimes there are other reasons 
why you may need to clean up your Mac 
— for example, when you have a system 
clash that’s hard to pin down, making 
your Mac behave in a strange manner.
The idea behind this feature is to 
rxwolqh#glļhuhqw#zd|v#|rx#fdq#ghfoxwwhu#
d#Pdf=#Ľqglqj#dqg#uhprylqj#grfxphqwv#
and apps you no longer need; shifting 
data to the cloud; and a “start from 
scratch” approach when things have 
already gone horribly wrong. And 
because you’re probably using an iPhone 
or iPad too, we’ll also spend a little time 
explaining how you can keep those 
devices in tip-top condition. 
After all, we should be far from the 
days when you have room only for that 
single snap left at an all-important 
event. That was understandable in

A  SCAN YOUR DRIVE
Prettier apps exist to 
examine your Mac, but 
few are more usable 
than GrandPerspective 
(Free, grandperspectiv.
sourceforge.net). Go to File > 
Scan Folder to scan your 
Mac’s entire drive and give 
you a graphical overview.
B  SELECT ITEMS
Click an item to highlight 
it. You’ll also see how it 
sits within any group of 
associated ﬁles (such as 
Applications, or tracks in 
iTunes). The Focus buttons 
(top left) move the selection 
up and down the hierarchy.
C  VIEW ITEM DETAILS
Whatever the selection you 
make, the path to the item 
will be shown in the status 
bar at the foot of the 
GrandPerspective window 
— along with the crucial value 
that tells you how much 
space it is taking up. 
D  PERFORM ACTIONS
Ctrl-click a selection and you 
can perform actions on it 
using the contextual menu 
— notably, previewing the 
item using Quick Look, 
or viewing it in Finder, prior 
to you potentially deleting it.
E  BEWARE OF DELETION
In GrandPerspective’s 
preferences, you can decide 
whether the app can move 
ﬁles to the trash, and 
whether conﬁrmation is 
required to do so. If unsure, 
turn off this capability of the 
app and delete ﬁles using 
only Finder.
F  RESCAN & REPEAT
GrandPerspective doesn’t 
provide a live view of your 
Mac’s drive. If you delete 
items, they’ll still appear in 
the app and simply be greyed 
out. Therefore, for ongoing 
pruning, make several 
changes and then rescan 
your Mac with the app.

If you still have the original iPhoto Library lurking 
around, you can back it up and delete it.

TRASH MASSIVE APPS
Never use iMovie? That’s over

/Applications in List view and sort 
by size to see what you can remove.
2
DELVE INTO DOWNLOADS
If you download lots of things in 
Vdidul/#wkh#Ľohv#lqlwldoo|#jhw#vdyhg#lq

folder out, it’ll be full of junk like app

PRUNE DEVICE BACKUPS
We recommend backing up your 
iOS devices to iCloud and also 
manually to iTunes, but the latter 
takes up space on your Mac. You 
can use the Devices tab in iTunes’ 
preferences to remove backups.

REMOVE LEGACY PHOTOS
When Apple replaced iPhoto 
with Photos, all your pictures and 
videos were migrated to the latter, 
meaning you no longer need your 
original iPhoto library. Back it up to 
an external drive, then delete it.
5
DELETE macOS INSTALLERS
Apple’s installers are well

macOS update, they vanish. That is 
unless you’ve made a manual copy.

DON’T FORGET THE TRASH
The Trash isn’t things you’ve 
wiped from your Mac, but items that 
are awaiting deletion. Until you empty 
the Trash (Ctrl-click it and choose 
Empty Trash), anything inside it still 
takes up space on your Mac.

With the arrival of 
version 12.7, iTunes 
is no longer the 
place to browse the 
App Store, nor to download and 
manage iOS apps. If you’re using 
it and were in the habit of 
downloading iOS apps to your 
Mac, you may now have a large 
and redundant archive of ﬁles.
These downloads are found in 
~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/
Mobile Applications, with apps 
varying in size from a few 
megabytes to several gigabytes. 
Back up to external storage and 
you can trash the folder, because 
these apps will never again be 
updated on your Mac. (You can, 
however, later put one back on 
a device, by dragging it from 
Finder to the device in iTunes.) If 
you can’t bear to part with the 
App Store or any other features 
removed in iTunes 12.7, download 
and install iTunes 12.6.3 instead.
Dump your  
iOS apps
Get started
Choose Apple menu > About 
This Mac, click the Storage tab, then 
click the Manage button. A window 
will open, detailing ﬁle types taking up 
space on your Mac. For example, click 
iOS Files for a list of iOS backups.
Recommendations
Click Recommendations at the 
top of the sidebar to view ways you can 
optimize storage and reduce clutter, 
remove Trash items after 30 days, 
remove watched videos from iTunes, 
and review whether ﬁles are needed.
View and delete
For those categories that 
directly list ﬁles, hover over an item 
and click the magnifying glass to view 
it in Finder, or the cross icon to delete 
it. Note: the latter action bypasses the 
Trash, deleting an item immediately.
HOW TO Scan with System Information
Detox your Mac
 maclife.com  JAN 2018   21

A  iCLOUD SYNC
If you use iCloud, documents 
and other data can be 
synchronized across your 
Mac and iOS devices, 
avoiding duplication or 
copies of ﬁles at various 
stages of completion.
B  SHARE DESKTOP  
& DOCUMENTS
Opt to store your Desktop 
and Documents folders in 
iCloud Drive, and they’ll be 
accessible and kept in sync 
across Macs with Sierra or 
later, iCloud Drive in iOS 10, 
and Files in iOS 11, if signed 
in to your iCloud account.
C  OPTIMIZE
In iCloud Drive’s prefs, turn 
on Optimize Mac Storage. If 
space is low, your Mac works 
out what you’re unlikely to 
use soon and turns the 
local copy into a link that 
redownloads the ﬁle from 
iCloud if needed. Be wary of 
any ﬁles with dependencies.
D  WATCHED VIDEOS
If you download a lot of 
movies and TV shows from 
the iTunes Store, they’ll take 
up gigabytes of storage. Your 
Mac can automatically delete 
any items you’ve watched. To 
do that, click the appropriate 
checkbox in the Advanced 
tab in iTunes’ preferences.
E  STORE YOUR  
PHOTOS IN iCLOUD
In the iCloud section of 
Photos’ prefs, check iCloud 
Photo Library. Your photos 
and videos will all be sent to 
iCloud and synced across all 
your devices (along with any 
edits you have made) — 
assuming you have enough

> 6 iCloud tips for your Mac
As we note below, 
Apple does not 
give you any kind 
of control over what is synced 
to iCloud Drive when using the 
Desktop & Documents Folders 
setting. Therefore, anything 
stored there will take up space 
on any Mac that’s signed into 
your iCloud account. 
The Optimize Mac Storage 
option is a workaround to some 
extent, since it’ll download only 
the ﬁles it thinks you need when 
space is at a premium. You can 
also consider splitting your 
documents between local 
archives (in a user-created  
~/Local Documents folder) and 
synced content stored in iCloud. 
However, you’re then risking 
complication and clutter, and 
might want to consider Dropbox 
or Google Drive unless Apple 
later offers more control in a 
future macOS or iOS update.
Syncing 
feeling 
Manage iCloud
iCloud is all or nothing when it 
comes to syncing. Whatever’s stored 
there will end up on your Mac, unless 
you’re really low on space and have 
activated the Optimize Mac Storage 
option — which decides for you.
Prune Dropbox
Dropbox is much friendlier 
in this regard. Access the service’s 
preferences from its menu bar app, 
select Sync, then click “Choose folders 
to sync.” You can then decide which 
folders will be synced to your Mac.
Tame Google Drive
 Select Preferences from the 
vertical bar button, then Google Drive. 
Click “Sync these folders only,” then 
choose which to sync. You can also 
sync folders from your Mac, including 
your Desktop and Photos library.

Detox your Mac

THE SOLUTIONS WE’VE 
looked at so far for 
decluttering and cleaning 
your Mac have been fairly 
minor — the rough equivalent of a 
bit of dusting, or trashing old boxes 
that have been stacked in a corner 
for way too long. But there’s a more 
extreme option — the decluttering 
equivalent of “nuke it from orbit.”
We’ll now explore this course of 
action, which starts with beginning 
afresh, reverting your Mac to the 
equivalent of factory settings. After 
that, you’ll gradually build it back up 
to a workable state, restoring your 
documents, media, and apps.
STARTING AGAIN
Although there’s a sense of 
busywork when peering into your 
Mac with GrandPerspective, starting 
from scratch is serious hard work. 
\rx#fdqġw#h{shfw#wr#Ľqlvk#d#frpsohwh#
Mac refresh in an odd half-hour. 
Instead, you’re going to need to set 
aside a day or more of Mac time. It’s 
also going to be a dull, tedious slog, 
with a lot of waiting around.
You might then reasonably 
ask why you’d want to do this. 
What are the advantages? In what 
circumstances would this be 
considered a good idea? We can think 
ri#wzr1#Wkh#Ľuvw#lv#zkhq#wkhuhġv#
something very wrong with your

it. You may have tried repeatedly to 
get your Mac running smoothly, but 
it’s stubbornly resisting. This is rare, 
but low-level issues can occur after a 
Mac has accumulated the detritus of 
several years of use and updates. 
Installing apps, services, and 
hardware can take their toll.
The second reason is that it can be 
immensely rewarding to start again 
with a clean slate. Sure, you can 
delete the odd app you don’t think 
you need, but what about deleting all 
ri#wkhpB#Dqg#wkh#vdph#zlwk#Ľohv#dqg#
gdwdB#\rxġoo#wkhq#txlfno|#Ľqg#rxw#
what you really need (instead of just 
kdylqj#vwxļ#kdqjlqj#durxqg#iru#wkh#
sake of it). As we’ve said, this is an 
extreme option, and not for the 
faint-hearted, but it can be an 
hļhfwlyh#zd|#wr#eulqj#vdqlw|#dqg#
calm back to your Mac experience.
Before you begin, ensure you have 
at least two copies of anything 
important from your Mac. We have 
shown you how to back up your vital 
vwxļ#lq#wkh#sdvw/#dqg#vr#zh#zrqġw#jr#
into depth here. But we strongly 
recommend making at least one full 
If your aim in starting from 
scratch is to clean your Mac 
and quickly reinstall all your 
personal user data from Time Machine, 
note that Time Machine backups are 
ﬁle system independent. 
So, if you tried the macOS High 
Sierra public beta and converted your 
Fusion Drive to APFS, which is not 
supported in the ﬁnal public release, 
you can make one last backup, erase 
the Fusion Drive to macOS Extended 
format, install the non-beta macOS 
High Sierra, then use the Setup 
Assistant — or Migration Assistant 
after setup — to restore content from 
the backup. This also means that if 
your Mac’s startup disk is purely ﬂash-
based, and so is forcibly switched to 
APFS by High Sierra, your old Time 
Machine backups are not rendered 
useless to it.

Start from scratch
The most extreme of cleaning options is to strip  
your Mac right back and effectively start again

The preparation is a little intimidating, but 
there’s nothing like a fresh install of macOS 
to really clear things out.

at least 16GB of free space for macOS

installer. You’ll need a macOS 
installer from the Mac App Store, 
and Install Disk Creator (Free, 
macdaddy.io/install-disk-creator) 
or  follow the steps at bit.ly/macos_
boot. Restart your Mac while holding 
Opt, and select the installer you just 
created. When the macOS Utilities 
window appears, select Disk Utility. 
Use the Erase feature to format your 
Mac’s usual startup disk as either 
APFS, if it’s a solid-state drive (SSD), 
or as macOS Extended (Journaled) 
with a GUID Partition Map scheme 
if it’s a hard drive or Fusion Drive.
Quit Disk Utility and 
install macOS from the 
macOS Utilities window, 
choosing your newly 
formatted drive as the 
destination. Once the 
process is complete, you’ll 
need to enter your Apple ID 
and other details.
GET YOUR LIFE BACK
At this point, you have all 
sorts of choices. You could 
copy across the contents of 
your entire user folder 
from a clone of your drive, 
or restore from the Time 
Machine backup. But a 
smarter move is often to 
restrict installation and 
copy just the things that 
it turns out you really need.
For example, rather than 
installing (from the Mac 
App Store and elsewhere) 
all your favorite apps, wait 
xqwlo#|rx#qhhg#rqh#Ľuvw#ğ
and consider whether 
you might already have 
something installed that 
could do the job instead. With your 
documents, copy across supporting 
Ľohv#iru#fxuuhqw#surmhfwv/#exw#ohdyh#
rwkhu#rog#vwxļ#rq#|rxu#edfnxs#
drives unless it’s needed one day for 
reference or revival. That way, your 
Documents and Applications folders 
will be cleaner and simpler, far easier 
to manage, and take up less space.
It’s also worth noting that this 
can go hand-in-hand with cloud 
services. Sure, you could just copy 
your entire iTunes library back to 
your Mac — and perhaps you should, 
if you have many meticulously 
generated playlists. Alternatively, 
you could start using Apple Music or 
Spotify, massively reducing space 
usage, creating music collections 
that will sync across devices, and 
potentially discovering new music 
instead of listening to the same old 
vwxļ1#Diwhu#doo/#li#|rxġuh#vwduwlqj#
afresh with your Mac, there’s no 
reason why you can’t do so (to some 
extent) with your music.
Finally, a word of warning: take 
care of your backups. These will now 
be where your Mac “history” lives 
— not on your Mac itself. Be very 
careful to not overwrite them or 
damage them. Again, this is why 
making multiple copies of your 
documents — instead of relying on 
just one — is a very smart idea.
When starting from scratch 
on your Mac, be aware that 
a clean install mean wiping 
the entire contents of your 
startup drive. That means anything 
that previously had dependencies will 
need those reinstated to fully function. 
You might ﬁnd clean installs of music 
software lack custom instruments, for 
example, and creative apps may lack 
plug-ins. Copy across an old movie or 
a podcast project, and it’ll work only 
if it can still ﬁnd any ﬁles you added.
This is why it’s important to have a 
clone of your original system, so you 
can copy across ﬁles you later need. 
Note that ﬁles in your user account‘s 
Library folder will be hidden on clones, 
but can be reached in Finder with Go > 
Go to Folder; for the path, use the 
format /Volumes/[vol name]/Users/
[user name]/Library/.

A  INSTALL HAZEL
Hazel ($32, noodlesoft.com) 
is an app that can automate 
your ongoing maintenance, 
using rules you set up. It 
monitors folders for you and 
performs speciﬁed actions. 
B  START DEFINING 
YOUR RULES
Open System Preferences > 
Hazel and add a folder to 
watch using the Folder pane’s 
Plus button. Then create 
rules for that folder, adding 
each using the Plus button 
beneath the Rules pane. You 
can have duplicate ﬁles or 
broken downloads trashed 
automatically, for example.
C  BUILD ACTIONS
If you’ve ever created a 
playlist in iTunes, the steps 
for creating rules are similar 
here. You deﬁne conditions 
that trigger actions when 
any, all, or none of the 
conditions are met. Use the 
Preview button to test a rule.
D  REMOVE APPS
In Hazel’s Trash tab, you 
can enable its App Sweep 
feature. This tries to remove 
application support ﬁles 
when you delete an app, 
thereby potentially freeing 
up more space than just 
trashing the app alone.
E  AUTOMATE TRASH
macOS can be set to 
automatically erase items 
that have been in the Trash 
for 30 days, but Hazel offers 
many more timescale 
alternatives — and you can 
optionally set a maximum 
Trash size, too.
F  USE SMART FOLDERS
Alongside Hazel, or instead 
of it, you can also use Smart 
Folders to keep tabs on 
certain ﬁle types. In Finder, 
click File > New Smart Folder. 
Set up searches for recently 
added large ﬁles, say, to 
make sure you’ve actually 
done something with them.

need the originals in Downloads.

conventions and then stick to them. 
\rxġoo#eh#pruh#olnho|#wr#Ľqg#dqg#xvh#
things that you’ve previously saved.
6
CONSIDER GAMIFICATION
If it’s tricky to get good habits 
going, gamify them. Momentum 
Habit Tracker (Free, Mac App Store) 
gives you three free “habits” you can 
track, one of which can be a daily 
attempt to keep your Mac cruft-free.
> Form good habits for a clean Mac
You might think we’re 
killjoys for suggesting 
you keep new app 
installs to a minimum. But the 
cruft that accumulates from 
countless apps can sometimes 
cause problems for your Mac.
One alternative is to create 
a sandbox — a new partition, 
created using Disk Utility, into 
which you install a second copy 
of macOS. This sandbox can be 
used to test new apps, and since 
you’ll have to restart into it, 
you’ll be much more likely to give 
any apps you install there proper 
focus for a set period of time.
Doing this, of course, won’t 
save you space, but it can keep 
your main partition relatively 
pristine, while also retaining a 
space for you to have fun with 
any apps you want to try. 
Alternatively, if you can afford it, 
get a cheap second-hand Mac to 
do much the same with.
Two Macs  
in one
Import into iTunes
Set your rule’s condition to Kind 
is… Music. Set a ﬁrst action to “Import 
into iTunes” (the playlist will default to 
Library). Add an action “Move to folder 
Trash.” This will then delete originals 
after they’ve been imported.
Trash installers
This rule needs two conditions. 
The ﬁrst: Extension is dmg. The second: 
Date Added is “not in the last 1 month.” 
Set the action to: Move to folder Trash. 
Files of that type added over a month 
ago will be automatically binned.
Flag old items
Use the same date condition 
as in the previous step, but omit the 
Extension part. Use the “Set color 
label” action, and set the label to red. 
Old items will now be labelled, making 
them easier to spot for pruning.

apps and games when 
storage is low. This can free 
up space, and you don’t lose 
anything — simply tap an 
app’s Home screen icon to 
redownload it; its docs and 
data will still be present.

iOS unsurprisingly suggests 
using iCloud Photo Library if 
you’re not already doing so. 
Note that you may need to 
pay for additional iCloud 
storage space to use this.
E  REVIEW MEDIA
If it’s present, tap Show All 
to see additional suggestions 
for videos and attachments, 
both of which can take up a 
lot of space. In all cases, you 
can preview individual items 
before deleting them.
F  EXAMINE APPS
Scroll down for a list of all 
the apps and games installed 
on your device, with those 
taking up the most room at 
the top, and the date you last 
used each. You can delete 
or ofﬂoad apps manually, if 
you want. You can always 
redownload apps later, but 
deleting will trash their data.

If you like to try new apps and

OFFLOAD VIDEOS
Videos shot on your iOS device

habit of connecting your device to 
your Mac, and save videos there. This 
safeguards them and frees up space.

Apps such as Facebook and 
Twitter tend to cache content locally, 
to speed up browsing. You can often

As of iOS 11, app 
developers must make 
all their apps 64-bit 
compliant to take full advantage 
of the processors used in iPads 
and iPhones — 32-bit apps and 
games are no longer supported. 
In Settings, go to General > 
About > Applications. Any items 
listed under “no updates 
available” won’t launch at all 
on iOS 11. Chances are, many 
of these items will never be 
updated either, and are now 
therefore just clutter. 
For anything in the list you 
no longer care about, just delete 
it. If there’s something lurking 
you’d hoped to return to one day 
(such as a favorite game), or you 
have an inkling that an update 
may be imminent, ofﬂoad the 
app instead. That way, if or when 
an update does appear, you can 
reinstall it, and any associated 
data will have been preserved.
Removing 
32-bit apps
Get started
Plug a device into a Mac with 
iMazing (imazing.com) installed, and 
you can delve into various media types 
by selecting them in the app’s sidebar. 
Note: to access all categories, iMazing 
will ﬁrst have to make a backup.
Prune content
iMazing enables you to export 
and then delete photos, videos, music, 
and books outside of iTunes — although 
the free version limits how many items 
you can do this with. Paying $40 will 
unlock the app’s full functionality.
Save messages
The app also enables additional 
types of tidying — for example, select a 
conversation in Messages and you can 
archive it to PDF, and quickly export all 
of its attachments, before deleting it 
and freeing up the space it all took up.

head directly to the Keyboard 
pane in System Preferences, 
where magic awaits. 
In the Text tab there, you can 
create your own shortcuts — 
keywords you type which 
macOS replaces with a longer 
phrase. So, for example, if we 
type “shrug” with a semicolon 
before it, we get “¯\_(    )_/¯” 
while “sorryno” with 
a semicolon in front gives us 
“Thanks for this. I’ve passed it 
on to X, who’ll get in touch as 
soon as possible.”
While you’re in that pane, go

gestures for zoom, scroll, and rotate — but there 
are more, as you’ll discover in System Prefs > 
Trackpad. Two-ﬁngered swipes move between 
pages or open Notiﬁcation Center; three-ﬁngered 
dragging moves items around; a three-ﬁngered 
tap looks up a word or uses macOS’s data 
detectors for contextual actions; and four- 
ﬁnger gestures show the desktop, display 
Launchpad, open Mission Control or App Exposé, 
or move between full-screen apps. Enable them 
in System Prefs’ Trackpad pane, except for three-
ﬁnger drag, which is in the Accessibility pane.
Don’t forget Magic Mouse gestures: You

UNDER EVERY 
APP’S name in

sub-menu. Services are for 
performing speciﬁc tasks within 
apps, such as searching for the 
selected text using Google, or 
sending info from one app to 
another. They can be 
exceptionally useful if you’re 
willing to spend a bit of time

Once again, go to System

they work in every app, but some 
are app-speciﬁc. Services that 
are checked appear in the 
aforementioned sub-menu. 
For example, if you enable 
Summarize you can create a 
short overview of the selected 
text in almost any app; if you’ve

app, you’ll see services to add 
the selected text to your

your name — black on white paper 
works best, and thicker pen nibs 
give the best results. Open your 
document in Preview, and click the 
Markup button in the toolbar. You 
should now see a new toolbar of 
markup tools below the main one. 
Click the sixth icon from the left, 
which looks a bit like a signature, 
and then choose Create Signature.
Now for the fun part. Hold your 
signature up to your Mac’s camera 
and position it so it’s shown in the 
on-screen preview. Click Done to see 
the result. If you’re unhappy with it, 
you can retake the shot. Preview stores 
your signature for access later on, and 
enables you to move, resize, and rotate 
it just like any other object.

NOTIFICATIONS CAN BE 
useful, but sometimes you 
don’t want to be alerted 
when Jennifer posts yet 
another “here’s what I made for 
dinner” pic to Facebook, or when 
you receive an unimportant email. 
You might be in a meeting, 
delivering a presentation, or simply 
wu|lqj#wr#frqfhqwudwh1#Wr#wxuq#rļ#wkh#

Talk to your Mac
YOU KNOW SIRI enables you to search for 
things using your voice, but you might not 
know that your Mac has a superb dictation 
system too. All you need to do to dictate 
words is quickly press the fn key twice and then start 
speaking. There’s a bit of a lag between speaking and 
seeing the results on screen, but the speech recognition 
system is very fast, and you can also use commands, such 
as “new paragraph.” You can see the full list of commands 
at System Preferences > Accessibility. Choose Dictation 
from the left-hand pane, then select Dictation Commands.
To get the best possible performance, which requires 
about 700MB of disk space, turn on Enhanced Dictation 
(in System Preferences > Keyboard > Dictation). This saves 
the feature having to communicate with Apple’s servers 
and does the work on your Mac, thus enabling it to work 
even when you don’t have an Internet connection. It 
makes the results a little less accurate but much faster.
Your Mac is also able to read text to you. Go to System 
Preferences > Accessibility > Speech to set a keyboard 
shortcut and the voice that will speak whatever text is 
selected when you press that key combo.
SOMETIMES IT’S 
THE little things 
we love the 
most, such as 
Spotlight’s ability to do 
much more than search 
your Mac’s storage and your 
web browsing history. Once 
you summon it using its 
menu bar icon or by 
pressing Cmd+Space, you 
can get it to work out math 
— for example, typing 
“100/3” immediately 
displays 33.333333, and it 
shows the results as you go 
along in longer calculations.
Spotlight can convert 
currencies, too. Typing 
“$350 in Euro” works out 
the Euro value based 
on today’s exchange 
rate. It can also convert 
temperatures: Type “5°C” 
and Spotlight tells you 
that’s 41° Fahrenheit. It 
can even let you know about 
the weather: Type “Weather 
in New York” for the local 
forecast. Then there’s 
football scores — type 
“scores” followed by a 
team name — and word 
ghĽqlwlrqv#ğ#w|sh#wkh#zrug#
on its own, or preface it 
zlwk#ģghĽqh1Ĥ#Li#Vsrwoljkwġv#
scope is too broad, head to 
System Preferences > 
Spotlight to limit which 
results it displays.
Spotlight can calculate currency conversions and do math, 
and look up word deﬁnitions and even weather forecasts.
Do math in Spotlight
Dictation is even better if you 
enable its enhanced mode and  
use a good-quality microphone.

LANGUAGE PURISTS 
MAY weep, but if you don’t 
use emoji you’re missing 
out on a lot of fun — 
especially on social media, where a 
picture can tell a thousand words and 
a string of emoji can make even the 
dullest post look interesting. The emoji 
keyboard is obvious in iOS, but it’s a little 
more hidden in macOS. To bring it up, 
press Cmd+Ctrl+Space. 
The pop-up that appears is a compact 
view, with the most popular emoji shown 
ﬁrst and icons representing different 
categories at the bottom. If you click on 
the icon at the top right, you’ll see the 
full Character Viewer window — with not 
just emoji, but arrows, bullets, currency 
symbols, math and science symbols, and 
special punctuation marks. It’s worth 
switching to this view if you ﬁnd yourself 
using the same emoji repeatedly, since 
you can add individual ones to your 
favorites list for faster access.
Insert emoji
You can use emoji just 
as you do on iOS: Press 
Cmd+Ctrl+Space to open 
the Character Viewer.
Cache content
FOR ANYONE WITH multiple Macs 
or iOS devices, you can reduce your 
Internet bandwidth usage with High 
Sierra’s Content Caching feature. It’s 
useful if you have a monthly download limit, but 
it’s also a great timesaver. It stores downloads 
vxfk#dv#vriwzduh#xsgdwhv#dqg#lForxg#Ľohv/#dqg#
when another Mac, iOS device, or Apple TV 
wants such content, it’ll check with your Mac 
to see if it has already been downloaded. If it 
has, the device takes that version instead of 
downloading it again from the Internet. 
For best results, your main Mac should have 
an Ethernet connection to your router, with 
other devices on Wi-Fi. You can enable Content 
Caching in System Prefs > Sharing. If you have a 
complex network setup you might need to tweak 
it; by default it works only on a single subnet, 
such as your Mac having the address 10.0.0.2 
and other devices 10.0.0.3 onwards.
Content Caching helps you avoid downloading duplicates of data from 
iCloud or Apple’s App Stores. See bit.ly/content_caching.

APP TIPS
Get started with the Procreate app
This version integrates iOS 11’s 
new ﬁle system, so you can 
drag pictures and more to and 
from iCloud or elsewhere.
Pinching the canvas zooms 
and rotates it, so you can paint 
from any angle. Flick-pinch to 
pop it back to full-screen size.
You can set the top toolbar 
and brush size controls (left) 
to hide themselves when you 
brush near them.
Every session is automatically 
recorded, and you can save a 
time-lapse video from the 
Actions menu at any time.

From the home-
made compilation 
tapes of the ’80s to 
today’s shared links 
from Apple Music and Spotify, 
one of the great joys of 
music is sharing your 
discoveries or favorites 
with others. SoundShare 
was designed to do just 
that, and to do so in a way 
that made sharing as easy 
as possible — it doesn’t 
matter if you’re on Apple 
Music and your friend is 
on Spotify or Deezer; 
VrxqgVkduh#Ľqgv#wkh#
right song in the 
appropriate service.
Version 3 has two key 
improvements. First, it

SOUNDSHARE 3

GREAT 
uses MusicKit, the iOS 11 
framework that enables 
deeper integration with Apple 
Music. This means apps such 
as SoundShare can access 
personalized playlists and 
recommendations in much the 
same way the Apple Music app 
does. Second, and even more 
fun, it has a Party Mode.
With Party Mode you can 
invite friends to collaborate on 
a playlist. It’s best for — you 
guessed it — parties, where a 
single iOS device can handle 
everybody’s requests and send 
to a wired or wireless speaker 
system. No more pairing 
multiple devices, swapping 
cables, or worse, giving others 
your passcode. It works really 
well, although the ability to let 
others interrupt playback with 
their own choices could be a 
problem if any of your friends 
are impolite and have terrible 
taste in tunes. In a nice touch, 
SoundShare can even stream 
Party Mode videos to Apple TV 
e|#Ľqglqj#wkhp#rq#\rxWxeh1
There are a couple of 
caveats. Spotify sharing 
doesn’t work with the free 
version of Spotify; you need 
to have a Spotify Premium 
account. SoundShare can work 
only with what’s available, so 
glļhuhqfhv#ehwzhhq#vwuhdplqj#
services’ catalogs may prevent 
you from sharing the odd track 
ehwzhhq#wzr#glļhuhqw#pxvlf#
vhuylfhv1#\rx#fdqġw#vkduh#zlwk#
anybody who doesn’t have the 
SoundShare app, so Android 
owners are not able to take 
part in Party Mode. And we 
encountered the odd bug, 
such as when the Invite option 
trapped us in a Contacts page. 
But overall SoundShare 3 is a 
fohyhu#dqg#hļhfwlyh#zd|#wr#
share music with friends.
THE BOTTOM LINE. 
SoundShare 3 makes music 
more social, and Party Mode is 
good fun. GARY MARSHALL
SoundShare uses 
Apple Music, 
Deezer and Spotify.

When it comes to staying on 
top of payments, BillMinder 
does the job better than 
most — or it did, until regular 
updates stopped coming in early 2013, 
suggesting the app had been abandoned. 
Thankfully it has not been, and here’s a 
new version with a cleaner interface, 
which nicely complements iOS 11.
It’s a good news/bad news scenario, 
however: BillMinder 4 is a completely 
new app, with no free upgrade for users 
of the previous version. That said, the 
$4.99 price tag is reasonable, especially 
considering the app is now universal and 
works equally well on iPhone and iPad.
After years of ignoring QR 
codes, iOS 11 ﬁnally supports 
them: Open the Camera app, 
point it at one of these 
square pixellated barcodes wherever you 
see it, and an alert pops up offering the 
action or information contained in it. 
Most commonly QR codes will take you to 
a website, but they can also be used to 
send you to a location in Maps, add an 
entry to Contacts, and more. One handy 
idea is to use a QR code to log into a 
Wi-Fi network, saving you the trouble of 
typing the username and password.
But how do you create your own QR 
codes? Visual Codes makes it easy: Tap

EXCELLENT 
BillMinder 4 includes native iPad support — and 
it works equally as well as the iPhone version.
You can create QR codes containing various 
different types of information.
You can get up to speed pretty quickly 
by logging into your account and syncing 
data from the previous version, but you 
may be faced with hundreds of bills 
showing up past due after abandoning 
the app two years ago. What’s worse, 
there’s no way to bulk clear such entries, 
short of marking them paid one at a time.
None of this will be a hassle if you’re 
new to the app, and the developers have 
added useful functionality missing from 
the previous version, such as the ability 
to export CSV ﬁles or send data to 
PocketMoney, the popular ﬁnancial app.
One area still lacking is reports, which 
no longer have a dedicated tab. In its 
Add Code, then enter the URL, phone 
number, contact info, or whatever you 
want. The code is generated immediately.
Now what? You could take a 
screenshot (press Home and Sleep 
together), crop it to the code, then do 
whatever you want with the image. 
Better, add the $1.99 in-app purchase to 
get buttons that let you share, save, or 
print codes. A separate purchase at the 
same price enables you to scan existing 
QR codes into the app. Your own codes 
are always kept safe for re-use.
The author says there are competing 
standards for QR codes, so it’s not 
certain they’ll all work with every device 
place is a new dashboard view that 
provides a graphic-rich look at monthly 
and category totals along with the 
percentage of bills paid on time, but 
no way to export this information.
THE BOTTOM LINE. A welcome 
return, but we’re sticking with Chronicle 
for now. J.R. BOOKWALTER
or every QR code reader app (dozens are 
available for iOS and Android). They’ll 
always work for iOS 11 users, though, and 
basic URLs at least should work pretty 
much universally.

way to generate basic QR codes on your 
iPhone or iPad. ADAM BANKS

with far too many exits, and

make use of the game’s ability 
to raise sections of road, 
creating junctions that look 
like someone dropped concrete 
spaghetti from on high.
It comes across like Mini 
Metro meets Flight Control, 
as realized by a bag of crayons. 
And every time the map zooms 
out to reveal yet more freeways 
to tackle, you’ll be grinning at 
the game’s deviousness. One 
thing that won’t raise a smile, 
though, is its resolute “no

feature to stop you from trying 
to be a perfectionist, it ensures 
immediacy but is infuriating 
when you blunder — or the 
game doesn’t connect a road as 
expected — and you have to 
start again. It’d also be nice to 
get an inkling of each level’s 
high-score potential, rather 
than you having to take a risk, 
obliterating a road design and 
starting again, in the hope of

APPS AND GUIDES TO GET MORE FROM YOUR WATCH
WATCH
>>>App Life

ARKit has done 
wonders for making 
Augmented Reality 
mainstream, enabling 
developers to come 
up with many clever 
iOS 11 apps. One of 
the more curious is AirRuler, which 
turns your iPhone into a virtual ruler to 
measure length, height, or distance.
In practice, AirRuler isn’t all that 
accurate. There are two different 
modes: One for smaller objects where 
the user aims the camera at two points, 
and another best suited to measuring 
height or distance.
AirRuler supports watchOS, turning 
the Apple Watch into a digital readout 
as measurements are made. That may 
not sound like much, but it makes the 
process easier, since you can see the 
results as measurements are taken 
without the graphics getting in the way.
You’ll need an iPhone 6S or later to 
use AirRuler. The app can also capture 
photos or videos of AR measurements.
THE BOTTOM LINE. Apple Watch is 
relegated to sidekick status, but winds 
up aiding in the measurement process. 
J.R. BOOKWALTER
If you’re interested in 
a mortgage, new car, 
or other bank loan, a 
standard calculator 
will only get you so 
far — especially when 
estimating monthly 
installments. Better known in the 
banking industry as “EMI,” this is the 
amount of your principal plus interest, 
amortized over the loan term.
Although an App Store search turns 
up several items with the name “EMI 
Calculator,” this particular one caught 
our eye because it’s free and includes 
support for Apple Watch. It’s also 
surprisingly adept at tackling the basics 
and has a straightforward interface.
Calculations can be done in four 
ways: By EMI, amount, percentage rate, 
or period. Although this kind of math 
isn’t something you’ll do every day, it’s 
cool to be able to access such data 
from your wrist. The iPhone app also 
enables you to quickly ﬁnd your nearest 
bank, ATM, or other ﬁnancial institution.
THE BOTTOM LINE. Free and easy 
to use, this app is a quick way to 
estimate how much you’ll pay on your 
next loan. J.R. BOOKWALTER

T
his is the biggest shake-up in 
the market since Apple’s original 
iPhone deﬁned the smartphone 
a decade ago. It also seems risky, axing 
reliable key elements such as the 
Home button and Touch ID, instead 
introducing new methods of navigating 
and unlocking — and charging a lot 
more for the privilege: The iPhone X 
costs $999 for the basic 64GB model, 
and an eye-watering $1,149 for the 
256GB version. So what does your 
money buy you?
The 5.8-inch OLED display is leaps 
ahead of the screen in the iPhone 8 
and 8 Plus for many reasons: the 
sharpness, the color quality, the fact 
that it ﬁlls the whole front of the 
phone. The screen is also taller, but 
while it looks larger than the iPhone 
8 Plus’s 5.5-inch display on paper, it’s 
only marginally bigger in terms of 
screen real estate — it’s just stretched 
upwards. The term “bezel-less” is not 
quite accurate, either: There are slight 
bands around the edges of the screen, 
but they don’t mar the experience — 
instead they give your ﬁngers 
something to land on.
The notch at the top is something 
that’s going to divide opinion. Apple 
has taken a chunk out of the top of the 
screen to house the new TrueDepth 
camera, and it encroaches on the 
display. In portrait mode this is hard 
to notice, and the way the status bar 
spills around it is nice. But in landscape 
orientation it will annoy if you expand 
a movie to ﬁll the screen rather than 
display letterboxed. 
Unfortunately, many app developers 
are not ready for the taller format, 
with almost all apps we used packing 
black bars above and below the display, 
and those that take advantage of the 
aspect ratio displaying some glitches. 
Developers are likely to quickly ﬁx their 
code, but right now it’s disappointing.
Unlike the displays on the iPhone 8 
and iPhone 8 Plus, the iPhone X screen 
includes HDR playback. It can show 
movies encoded in the HDR10 and 
Dolby Vision formats (but not 4K, 
sadly) and, combined with the OLED 
display, the images offer much more 
depth and realistic color reproduction. 
If you’re watching a scene with 
explosions in it, the effect is incredible.
It’s inherently harder to make out 
detail in darker scenes in HDR movies, 
but compared side-by-side with iPhone 
8, the overall richness, depth, and 
quality for movies is higher here.
FACIAL FEATURES
Face ID, Apple’s face-recognition 
system — which replaces the 
ﬁngerprint-scanning Touch ID — is 
simple to set up: Just spin your head 
around a couple of times and you’re 
ready to go. This system has far 
exceeded our expectations for the 
new biometric technology. 
That’s not to say there won’t be 
some transition required from your 
current iPhone. There’s a slight delay 
at times, and you need to be looking at 
the handset to make it work. There are 
reports of Face ID not working as well 
in certain lighting conditions, but we 
haven’t encountered these issues.
An issue does crop up when using 
Apple Pay. Where previously you’d

approach the reader with your thumb 
over the Home button and it would 
instantly verify payment, with the 
iPhone X you need to double-click the 
side button to activate Face ID, have it 
register your face, and then it’ll be 
ready to pay. It’s not a tough system to 
master, but it’s not as easy as before.
Animoji, the feature that enables 
you to create talking emoji using the 
TrueDepth camera, is fun — you can be 
a talking robot or a poop, among other 
avatars. The precision of the face 
mapping is truly impressive. But it is a 
novelty, not something you’ll buy this 
phone for (unless you plan a career 
in Animoji karaoke, of course). And 
while you can share videos of Animoji 
with friends using apps other than 
iMessage, it’s not straightforward to do.
 
MISSING HOME
iOS 11 operates a little differently on 
the iPhone X. The main difference is 
the lack of a Home button. This has 
been replaced by gestures. Swiping up 
from the foot of the screen now does 
the job the Home button used to do. 
This takes some getting used to, but 
becomes automatic after a day or so. 
Beyond that, however, Apple has made 
things a little too convoluted. To open 
the app switcher, say, you do a short 
swipe upwards and pause for a 
moment… Go too far and you’ll just 
access the Home screen. To shut down 
apps, it’s no longer a swipe but a press 
and then a swipe. This doesn’t feel 
intuitive — and the same can be said 
for the new gesture where you swipe 
right on the foot of the screen to move 
between recently-used apps. 
Control Center now lives to the right 
of the notch at the top of the screen, 
with the notiﬁcations panel on the left. 
We like the placement of these two 
— having Control Center at the bottom 
got in the way of too many apps in the 
past. If you’re using the iPhone X in 
landscape mode, though, you’re going 
to run into trouble. Without the notch 
to separate them, the notiﬁcations 
panel takes up the bulk of the space 
at the expense of Control Center, and 
you’ll need to swipe accurately from 
the top right corner to access it.
Gaming on iPhone X is strong, in 
part thanks to the A11 Bionic chip. The 
new penchant for AR gaming, where 
games are played within a plane 
overlaid on real-world surroundings, is 
a key part of Apple’s new strategy, and 
we managed to play a game of The 
Machines with aplomb.
And don’t forget about the excellent 
Taptic Engine — it really enhances 
gaming. You’ll get a real sense of 
a machine-gun ﬁring, taking hits 
yourself, or swiping through a list with 
a real clicking feel in the hand.

iPhone 8 Plus (6.14 ounces compared 
to 7.13 ounces), the iPhone X feels 
more substantial, in a good way. It feels 
strong and solidly built, although early 
tests show that all that glass won’t 
stand up well to being dropped. The 
glass front and back panels are also 
smudge-suckers, and the outer band 
gets covered in ﬁngerprints fast.
But while the rear of the phone is 
glass, as on the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, 
there’s a different design language at 
play here. Every button is elegantly 
embedded into the rim of the phone, 
yet there’s a sharpness to each key. 
press to the camera icon to reach it, 
instead of swiping), but it’s hard to 
fault the natural, clear, and crisp 
photos. Video capabilities are also 
among the best on the market, with 
4K recording at 60fps delivering ﬂuid 
footage, although it will take up a good 
chunk of space on your device.
Apple has gotten things almost 
entirely right with the iPhone X. The 
price is steep, but you get a high-res 
OLED screen, wireless charging, water 
resistance, millions of apps, up to 
256GB to store them in, lightning-fast 
download speeds, AR effects, speedy 
and reliable face recognition, great 
speakers, and sublime photos from 
both front and back cameras.
Is it perfect? Of course not. The 
notch at the top of the screen irks, and 
the bezels are a little too heavy to call 
it bezel-less. The camera isn’t market-
leading (although it’s very good), and 
despite its innovations the iPhone X’s 
dizzying price is impossible to ignore.
All that said, the iPhone X is the 
closest to perfection Apple has ever 
come with an iPhone.
THE BOTTOM LINE. If you’re okay 
with the sky-high price, you’re going to 
love the iPhone X. GARETH BEAVIS
The iPhone X is surprisingly easy 
to use single-handed; it balances 
naturally in the hand, with the glass 
and metal combination feeling grippy, 
and most thumbs will be able to roam 
comfortably over the slippery surface. 
You’ll need to drag down notiﬁcations 
and Control Center with the digits of 
your other hand on most occasions, 
but the iPhone X is a good mix of 
a large phone screen while being 
ergonomic enough to use in one hand.
The front-facing 7MP TrueDepth 
camera can sense depth incredibly 
well, and the Portrait mode can now 
be used with the front-facing camera 
to take great selﬁes. Not only will this 
produce a great background blur, but 
you can also change the lighting, or cut 
yourself out of the picture and place 
yourself on a blank background.
The rear camera is similar to the 
one on the iPhone 8 Plus. Both have 
a 12MP dual-sensor array (for taking 
zoomed-in pictures, or capturing a 
good depth-of-ﬁeld), but the iPhone X’s 
telephoto lens has an f/2.4 aperture, 
where on iPhone 8 Plus it’s f/2.8 (and 
only the wide-angle lens has optical 
image stabilization). So, the iPhone X 
delivers shots rich with detail, and 
low-light performance is a touch better 
than with previous iPhones. 
The camera could do with opening 
a little faster from the Lock screen

T
he DS418play is the latest in a line of 
Synology network-attached storage 
(NAS) boxes that have been designed to 
stream audio and video to all of the devices 
on your home network.
The DS418play is a four-bay NAS that 
can be conﬁgured as a RAID array for speed 
or redundancy. Unlike other Synology NAS 
boxes, it transcodes video and audio on the 
ﬂy, so you can store ﬁles on its storage drives 
(not included) and then stream them to an 
app, such as Synology’s own video player or 
the popular VLC on your iPhone or iPad, even 
when iOS doesn’t support the ﬁle format.
The DS418play has a faster processor 
and more memory than its predecessors; it 
supports up to 40TB of storage and can 
transcode two channels of H.264/H.265 
4K video simultaneously. It also supports 
hardware encryption for ﬁle transmission. 
And it can be used as a destination for Time 
Machine backups, as well as being a regular 
ﬁle server. Apps available for iPhone and iPad 
enable you to stream audio and video and 
manage ﬁles. With the apps switched on in 
Share sheets, you can share photos and 
video to the NAS box, too. Support for CCTV 
cameras and direct downloads round out a 
comprehensive set of features.
The DS418play’s OS is easy to set up and 
conﬁgure. We had no problems installing 
storage drives, starting it up, and getting our 
Mac to discover the box on our network. We 
copied video shot on an iPhone to the NAS, 
and played it back on other devices on the 
network as well. We also uploaded video and 
audio content via the Finder on a Mac and 
then streamed it to our iOS devices. 
THE BOTTOM LINE. If you want a high-
capacity streaming media server that doubles 
as a NAS all-rounder, the DS418play ﬁts the 
bill perfectly. KENNY HEMPHILL

You can’t fault SuperTab 3’s ambition of trying to 
make an app switcher the center of your workﬂow. 
Instead of Cmd+Tab just showing app icons, it 
provides conﬁgurable rows of goodies to explore.
In some cases, this works well. With active apps, 
you can quickly cycle through their open windows. 
You might have one row for recent apps, and 
another for the Dock’s contents. Hot keys can be 
assigned to items for instant launching.
But for many item types, this isn’t an optimal 
interface. It’s initially exciting to add custom 
items and folders, but it soon becomes tiresome 
staring at rows of practically identical thumbnails. 
On-hover previews are problematic, too, working 
only with a limited number of document types.
SuperTab 3 works best as a hot-key launcher 
twinned with a switcher for apps, windows, and/or 
visibly distinct folders. It’s broadly impressive, but 
Witch is a better, souped-up take on Apple’s app 
switcher — and has added window smarts.
THE BOTTOM LINE. Interesting but messy, 
and a poor match for too many item types.

Photographers can set their watches by 
Photoshop Elements’ update every year 
— Adobe has clearly nailed some complex 
logistics. More complicated: coming up 
with an annual refresh that appeals every 
time. Photoshop Elements 2018 is either 
an $80 upgrade from an earlier version, 
or a $100 purchase if you don’t have it 
already. So what has Adobe added to keep 
photographers tempted?
There are no huge interface overhauls 
here, something that has been true for 
the last few updates of Elements, and it’s 
starting to make the software look and 
feel dated, particularly since Apple’s 
Photos app has been given a new lease of 
life in macOS High Sierra. All of Elements’ 
existing appeal is there, though — the 
interface is clean, and there are easily 
enough tools that if you’re unwilling to 
give the full-blown Photoshop a try, 
you’ll still be able to get started fast.
Jxlghg#hglwv#duh#hļhfwlyho|#lqwhudfwlyh#
tutorials to help you do things, such as 
creating layer masks with shape overlays, 
or double exposures. Both these, and a 
few others, are new and work well.
There are a few new features. Auto 
Selection attempts to isolate a subject 
when you draw a marquee selection 
around it, while “Open closed eyes” 
attempts to rescue images where your 
subject has been caught mid-blink. The 
former works reasonably well, providing 
rough-and-ready cutouts and getting a 
vhohfwlrq#uhdg|#iru#wkh#UhĽqh#Hgjh#gldorj#
faster. Opening closed eyes requires two 
photos — one with a subject blinking 
and one without. We had trouble with this 
— “No face found” is a common error 
message. When it does work, on virtually 
identical images where closed eyes are the 
rqo|#glļhuhqfh/#lw#zrunv#qhduo|#shuihfwo|/#
but then the question is why you would 
need to open a subject’s eyes when you 
have a similar photo with them open.
If you’re not already an Elements user, 
this is a powerful photo editor and a 
worthy alternative to a Creative Cloud 
subscription, although the Photos app 
may serve you just as well. For upgraders, 
this is one to miss.
THE BOTTOM LINE. A usable, powerful 
photo editor. But it’s expensive, so look

T
hese are Beats’ premier full-size wireless 
headphones. Most of the frame is plastic, 
and the pads are soft synthetic leather, 
which ultimately doesn’t matter much. Beats’ 
build quality has been criticized over the 
years, but seems perfectly good here.
The headphones’ Pure Adaptive Noise 
Cancelling (Pure ANC) appears designed to 
avoid distortion caused by cancellation of 
louder sources, which we’ve heard next to 
subway car doors, say. It doesn’t solve a big 
real-world issue, however: wind whistling 
around the pinhole microphone creating more 
noise. These headphones are slightly more 
susceptible to this than some.
The tech is reasonably effective, though, 
making cities less stressful, stopping engine 
noise ruining your music, and avoiding the 
need to raise volume in noisy places. Yet ANC 
in Bose’s QuietComfort 35 is signiﬁcantly 
better. Pure ANC leaves the Studio3 Wireless 
with a slight low-mid frequency noise bed. 
Some ANC headphones sound like digital 
tinnitus; these are more like a record player.
Sound isn’t overly bassy or juvenile. 
There’s width similar to some of the best 
portable headphones’, with a quite forward 
presentation. This makes key parts of a mix 
seem close to your ears, ensuring sound isn’t 
too relaxed. Relatively conservative low bass 
is one potential surprise. Sennheiser’s 
Momentum 2.0 cans, for example, are more 
aggressive here, making kick drums stand out 
and seem more powerful.
There’s a thickness in the upper bass and 
low mids, rather than a sub-bass gut punch. 
In many situations it works well. Podcasts 
aren’t underpinned by bass rumble, but 
voices sound robust. With vocal-led music, 
particularly a gravelly crooner such as 
Leonard Cohen, this is imperfect; it stops 
music sounding properly separated, and can 
seem abrasively resonant with certain songs.
We’ve heard this from Beats before, and 
noted how it makes the soundstage seem 
constrained. This ﬂaw is largely absent in 
rivals, most damningly Urbanista’s Seattle 
Wireless. These Beats sound better in other 
respects, but it’s not good that something 
one-third of the price has more coherent 
mids. The treble is slightly safe too, lacking 
a little compared to rivals of this price.
Battery life is good — 22 hours with ANC 
and wireless on, or up to 40 without ANC. 
Apple’s W1 chip makes connecting to your 
phone straightforward.
THE BOTTOM LINE. The Studio3 is solidly 
built and has decent noise cancellation. 
However, overall sound quality lags behind 
its chief rivals. ANDREW WILLIAMS

We reviewed Parallels Desktop in Mac|Life 
134. This month we’re turning our attention 
to Fusion, its main commercial competitor.
Installation is a breeze, once you’ve 
authorized an extension that’s needed 
and macOS High Sierra blocks. It should 
complete in less than a minute, and even 
installing Windows — which takes a while 
longer — is almost entirely automated. Stick 
with the defaults as far as you can and leave 
it alone for half an hour, and when you 
return the guest OS will be up and running. 
It’s not only cheaper, but also less hassle 
than buying a PC. Windows apps are snappy 
on a 2012 Mac mini, both inside the Windows 
hqylurqphqw#dqg#zkhq#uxqqlqj#dv#ľrdwlqj#
macOS windows, and with your networking 
settings carrying through you should be able 
to get online right away. You can also access 
commonly-used Windows apps by right-
clicking the Fusion icon on the macOS Dock. 
The only real disappointment is that when 
Windows is running in full screen you can’t 
sit another app beside it in Split View.

support for the latest versions of Windows 
and macOS, but many of the other 
improvements are aimed at power users, 
such as integrating automation tools for use 
in testing pipelines, the option to simulate 
data loss and network latency, copying guest 
data, and enabling Windows Virtualization 
Based Security, which protects the operating 
system kernel from malware. These are all 
valuable additions, but few of them will help

There are many reasons why you’d want 
to create a bootable clone of your Mac’s 
startup drive — or any other connected 
drive. Perhaps you’re performing a clean 
install of macOS, for example. Or simply 
deleting or overwriting large amounts of 
data. In each case, a bootable clone can 
get you out of trouble should something 
go disastrously wrong.
Carbon Copy Cloner does much more 
than create bootable clones, but that 
remains its core function. And if you’re 
using High Sierra, Carbon Copy Cloner 
supports both the new OS and APFS.
New features in CCC 5 include a guided

Cloning Coach is also new. It watches in 
wkh#edfnjurxqg#dv#|rx#frqĽjxuh#wdvnv/#
alerts you to any potential problems, and 
gives advice on how to avoid them.

organized in groups. 
Aside from its utility, perhaps the best 
thing about Carbon Copy Cloner is its 
interface, which is logically laid out. There 
is room for improvement: sometimes tips 
can be displayed beyond the edge of the 
screen and, with no way to resize the CCC 
window, the only way to see some of them 
is to drag the window around.

is an excellent tool. Cloning your Mac or

W
e liked the new MX mice and keyboards 
released by Logitech recently, which 
provided ingenious features such as 
the ability to quickly switch control between 
two separate computers, and the company’s 
new MX Sound speakers attempt to provide 
similar versatility when you’re listening to 
music on your Mac, iPhone or iPad.
The two compact speakers stand just 
160mm wide and 160mm high, so they’ll 
sit comfortably on either side of your Mac 
without taking up too much desk space. The 
speakers provide Bluetooth for iOS devices, 
and can pair with two devices at once. There 
are also two 3.5mm connectors for audio 
input from a Mac or other wired device, and 
a headphone connector as well. And, just 
like the other Logitech MX products, the MX 
Sound enables you to switch between devices 
— either Bluetooth or wired — quickly and 
easily. All you have to do is pause the audio 
on one device and then start playing a track 
on the other one, and the MX Sound will 
automatically detect the new audio input 
and switch over for you.
You’re not going to get hi-ﬁ quality from 
a set of speakers costing $100, but the MX 
Sound does a good job for such a compact 
little set of speakers. They produce a warm, 
full sound with the massed harmonies of 
Somebody To Love by Queen, and manage to 
create an open, expansive soundstage for the 
widescreen atmospherics of Enya’s Orinoco 
Flow. The only minor disappointment is the 
bass output. To be fair, the little bass port 
(which does double duty as a stand) on each 
speaker adds some body to the mid-bass 
on pop tracks like Blondie’s Rapture, but the 
small speakers do struggle to get down to the 
deeper, electronic bass of Prime Evil by The 
Orb. There are bigger and better speakers 
around, but if you need just a compact set of 
desktop speakers to enhance music and video 
on your Mac and mobile devices then the MX 
Sound will do the trick very nicely, without 
costing the earth.
THE BOTTOM LINE. The MX Sound 
manages to squeeze very respectable sound 
quality into compact and affordable stereo 
speakers that make a great companion for 
a desktop Mac, iPad or iPhone. Connectivity 
is good, too, with quick and easy switching 
between Bluetooth and wired connections.

abundance of ports. Notably, in contrast to the Elgato and 
CalDigit rivals we’ve tried, it has FireWire 800 for legacy 
devices, and an SD card reader and optical audio output, 
both of which are omitted from recent MacBook Pros.
There’s also a Mini DisplayPort, which may make up for 
the slightly higher cost of this dock — the aforementioned 
rivals use full-size DisplayPort, but you may have a Mini 
DisplayPort adapter and suitable cable from an older Mac.
This is the best-specced Thunderbolt 3 dock we’ve tried 
for variety and quantity of ports. Two of its USB ports can 
provide higher power to an iPad, say, if you install a driver.
If a dock is the ointment for connectivity complaints with

Charging your iPhone is a perfect time to back up 
the data stored there. SanDisk iXpand Base makes 
it a snap to kill these two birds with one stone.
The base is a four-inch puck about an inch thick 
with a metal bottom and soft rubber top where 
the iPhone sits. Plug a USB to Lightning cable 
(not included) into the base of the unit, then tuck 
it away inside a groove along the edge to keep 
things tidy. There’s no wireless charging or 
backup — iXpand works only when plugged in.
A standard SD card with 32, 64, 128, or 256GB 
comes pre-installed. Backups are done from the 
iXpand Base app, which automatically springs into 
action when launched.
This isn’t a good ﬁt if you use iCloud Photo 
Library, since the app has to download everything 
at full resolution during backup, but it works well 
with traditional camera rolls. Once it’s all backed 
up, you can purge content to free up device space, 
then view or restore it at any time.

WHAT IS ZONING?
 An ordinary thermostat 
will simply turn your 
heating on or off. 
However, many smart 
thermostats provide 
a “zoning” option as well. 
This is more expensive, 
as it requires additional 
adaptors that you connect 
to individual radiators, but 
does provide greater 
control over the heating 
in individual rooms.
WHAT IS GEOFENCING?
 The thermostat app can 
use your iPhone’s GPS to 
monitor your location. 
You can then establish a 
perimeter — or geofence 
— around your home that 
activates the thermostat. 
So, if you drive home from 
the station every night, 
the app can turn on the 
heating once you come 
within half a mile of home.

Mohu is a name familiar to many, 
thanks to the company’s line-up of 
antennas that enable cord-cutters 
to watch favorite network shows sans cable or 
satellite. Not content with conquering live TV, 
Mohu recently debuted AirWave, an antenna 
equipped with streaming capabilities, which 
enables everyone in your house to tune in.
The AirWave hardware requires a free 
companion app to function. That’s where Mohu 
TV comes in, streaming live, local feeds from 
the built-in tuner and providing free network 
television from the likes of ABC, CBS and more.
Mohu TV also includes a cable-style 14-day 
program guide, which requires no monthly 
subscription, and there’s a “carefully curated” 
selection of internet-based streaming channels 
to enhance the experience. Be sure to install

is free, but a $99 Core 
Edition is required, which 
includes 24 sculpted pieces 
called “Artefacts” that 
players stack on a special 
sensing platform known 
as the Plinth of Life.
When a player touches 
an Artefact to the platform, 
it appears on screen, 
turning into an amazing

world. There are hundreds 
of potential creatures to

It’s never been easier 
to make animated GIF 
videos, but being able 
to watch them on the big screen 
remains a challenge. That all 
changes with Momento.
Although it sadly lacks the 
customization niceties of the iOS 
app, the tvOS edition is about as 
easy to use as it gets. Allow the app 
to access your iCloud Photo Library, 
and a grid of thumbnails pops up, 
already animated and ready to view 
with a click of the Siri Remote.
Momento works automatically 
when there are multiple still 
photos taken around the same 
time, as well as with videos in your 
library. There’s a short delay as

combining the former Disney

Unfortunately, much of that depends on how 
well written the ransomware is, and what 
vulnerabilities it exploits. 
Ransomware typically starts by encrypting 
local storage. Because macOS has System 
Integrity Protection (SIP), system ﬁles and 
bundled apps can’t normally be encrypted. 
Ransomware is therefore most likely to 
start with your Home folder; if that’s large, 
it could take hours to encrypt completely.
SIP protects only your startup volume, 
so eventually the ransomware could get to 
encrypt your backups, when they’re mounted. 
With multiple backups, that’s unlikely to 
happen before it announces its presence or 
you detect it. When your monthly drive isn’t 
connected, malware can’t attack it, making it 
a valuable part of your protection strategy.
Although anti-virus products normally 
incorporate checks and signatures once 
malware has been identiﬁed by researchers, 
most can’t offer good protection until the 
malware is known about. 
Generic techniques are the only means 
of protection from unknown malware; 
Objective-See’s RansomWhere? from bit.ly/
objectivesee_ransomware uses a generic 
approach and should warn you very early 
if ransomware starts encrypting your ﬁles. 
RansomWhere? is free to download and use.
Make sure you check 
out these important 
support articles on 
Apple’s website to 
better understand 
the latest features.

WHAT’S THE BEST 
PROTECTION FROM MUD 
FOR AN iPHONE?
A sealed case cover, such 
as the Grifﬁn Survivor 
Extreme, seals controls 
and ports and provides 
water resistance. Mud is 
often quite abrasive, so 
inspect the case when in 
use. When it’s soiled, rinse 
the case clean and use an 
old soft toothbrush to 
gently remove debris.
HOW CAN I EXTEND 
BATTERY LIFE IN 
PATCHY COVERAGE?
In areas with patchy 
coverage, searching for a 
signal is a substantial drain 
on your iPhone’s battery. 
Low Power Mode does 
little to help, though. The 
only way to get better 
battery life is to switch on 
Airplane mode until you’re 
back in better cellular 
reception conditions.

Handoff usually just works, 
but when it doesn’t, it can be 
very hard to ﬁx. Basic checks 
are simple: On your MacBook 
Air, open About This Mac and 
then click the System Report 
button to open the System 
Information window. Select 
Bluetooth in the left-hand 
pane and check to see 
whether the main pane 
shows Handoff is supported.
Check that your Mac and 
iOS devices each have both 
Bluetooth and Wi-Fi turned 
on, and are signed into the 
same Apple ID on the same 
Wi-Fi network. Enable 
Handoff in the General pane 
on your Mac, and on each 
iOS device in Settings > 
General > Handoff.
From there, it’s a case of 
trying various little magic 
tricks which may or may not 
get it working… 
On each device, sign out 
of iCloud, and back in again. 
On your Mac, try trashing 
the Bluetooth preference ﬁle 
at /Library/Preferences/com.
apple.Bluetooth.plist, and 
resetting the SMC and 
NVRAM. For your Mac and 
devices, restarting them or 
shutting down and starting 
up again can suddenly

If after trying all these

I’m trying to connect my new iPad and iPhone 7 with my MacBook Air using Handoff, but

HOW DO I GET MY  
MAC TO REMEMBER  
ITS VOLUME SETTING?
If your Mac is forgetting its 
sound volume setting when 
starting up, this is because 
it isn’t being stored in 
NVRAM (formerly PRAM). 
Reset that by starting with 
the Cmd+Opt+P+R keys 
held down until the second 
startup chime (or more 
than 20 seconds on a new 
MacBook Pro), then release 
them and let your Mac 
start up normally.
DOES KEEPING MY 
HARD DRIVE AWAKE 
HELP IT LAST LONGER?
Spinning up a hard drive 
increases mechanical wear. 
Hard drives last longer if 
you set Energy Saver to 
not put them to sleep, and 
leave your Mac running at 
all times rather than 
shutting it down at the 
end of each day.
These restarts are almost certainly caused 
by repeated kernel panics, most probably 
reﬂecting a failing graphics card, but they 
could result from El Capitan’s fragility.
Run Apple Hardware Test (AHT, or 
Diagnostics on recent models) ﬁrst. Shut 
down and disconnect all external devices 
apart from a wired keyboard and mouse and 
any wired Ethernet connection. Start up, and 
immediately press and hold D until the AHT 
icon appears. Select language, click the right 
arrow, and begin the test. Initially, run normal 
rather than extended testing. If you can’t get 
your mouse to work, use the cursor and the 
Return key. Sometimes AHT or Diagnostics 
won’t detect graphics card faults, which 
should return an error code starting with 
VFD, typically VFD006. More extensive 
diagnostics at a Genius Bar may be needed.
If there’s deﬁnitely no hardware fault, 
browse your logs following starting up. For 
El Capitan, check out bit.ly/electriclight_
readinglogs. Consider upgrading to macOS 
Sierra, which is more stable in this respect, 
and better supported.
> Start up restarts
When I start or wake my iMac (Mid 2011) 
running 10.11.6, it often spontaneously 
restarts several times before working, even 
in Safe mode. I’ve reseated and tested the 
memory. There are crash reports referring 
to GPU resets. Is the graphics card dying?

CAN I UPGRADE MY 
iMAC 27-INCH LATE 
2014 FOR HEVC?
The only iMacs with 
hardware acceleration for 
HEVC are 5K 27-inch Late 
2015 models with Skylake 
chipsets, and all 2017 
models with Kaby Lake. 
Because this depends on 
the chipset, there won’t 
be any way to extend 
support to earlier models.
MY iMAC IS LIFELESS!
Verify it’s getting power 
by using a different 
socket and mains cable. 
Reset its SMC by 
disconnecting all cables, 
including power, for 15 
seconds, then reconnect 
and wait for ﬁve seconds 
before pressing the Power 
button. Still no signs 
of life? Then it needs to 
be repaired.
First deauthorize all apps, 
including any Adobe CS/CC 
apps. Open iTunes and go to 
Account > Authorizations > 
Deauthorize This Computer. 
Now make at least two 
copies of anything on 
that Mac which may be of 
importance, so that you can 
retrieve it in the future. 
Once that’s done, sign 
out of iCloud on that Mac, 
and allow this to remove 
iCloud data from the 
Mac; that data will still be 
accessible on other Macs 
using that iCloud account. 
Finally sign out of your 
account in the Messages 
app’s Preferences.
To erase your Mac’s 
storage, when running 
Mavericks or later, the Mac 
must be connected to the 
internet. Start it up in 
remote Recovery mode 
by holding down the 
Cmd+Opt+R keys. Select 
Disk Utility, then select your 
startup drive, and click 
the Erase tab. Erase free 
space too, selecting a level 
between the two extremes 
of fastest and most secure.
Erase your storage and 
set it to Mac OS Extended 
(Journaled) format, then 
quit Disk Utility. If your Mac 
is being sold or passed on 
to another user, select 
Reinstall OS X. When that 
process reaches the step of 
inviting you to select your 
country and region, press 
Cmd+Q and shut your Mac

How can I wipe all personal ﬁles from my old Mac prior to its disposal?
> My MacBook Pro  
can’t stay awake
My MacBook Pro enters a wake-sleep loop every 
minute, running until its battery is drained. This was 
resolved with Sierra, but has now returned. Energy 
Saver is set for system sleep after one minute, and 
the log gives a “Shutdown Cause” of –60 each time. 
Any idea how can I ﬁx this?
This is very unusual. These cycles may be the result 
of a serious disk error. Shutdown Cause codes given in 
the log following startup, and sometimes when waking, 
should be 5, indicating the previous shutdown was 
“clean.” Negative values imply hardware issues.
A cause code of –60 indicates a serious disk error, 
normally a bad master directory block. First test for 
hardware faults by restarting in Diagnostics mode 
(holding down D) and running its tests, then restart in 
Recovery mode (holding down Cmd+Opt+R) and run 
Disk Utility’s First Aid on your startup SSD.
If it can’t be repaired, restart in Recovery mode, 
reformat the SSD, reinstall macOS from there, 
and restore from your backup. If that doesn’t 
ﬁx it, make an appointment at a Genius Bar.

These are classic symptoms of a preference 
ﬁle that isn’t saving the changes you made, 
and the property list in question should be  
~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.ﬁnder.plist, 
which stores the great majority of Finder’s 
settings. The traditional way to ﬁx this would 
be to move that ﬁle to another folder, such 
as Documents, then to log out and log back 
on again, or restart. 
The snag with this is that macOS now 
manages preference ﬁles in a complex way, 
and you may ﬁnd that the regenerated 
preference ﬁle still doesn’t solve the problem. 
In that case, use free tools such as Prefs 
Editor (bit.ly/prefs_editor) or PrefEdit (bit.ly/
pref_edit) instead.
There may also be more problems with 
your preference ﬁles, such as incorrect 
permissions settings, which can stop them 
working normally. Apple has recently started 
to recommend that these can be addressed 
by repairing their permissions — not in the old 
way as before El Capitan, but those in your 
Home folder. Apple provides complete details 
about this in bit.ly/preference_permissions, 
and we look at this at bit.ly/electriclight_
repairingpermissions and provide simpler 
tools to help perform the repair.
When your web browser, or most apps 
capable of downloading apps and installers, 
saves that download, it automatically 
attaches quarantine information to the ﬁle — 
in the form of an extended attribute, or xattr, 
with the name com.apple.quarantine — and 
> Ins and outs of quarantine
How does macOS Sierra know whether an app has been downloaded from the Internet 
or not, and so run a full security check on it?
puts it into quarantine. This information is 
also recorded in the database at ~/Library/
Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices.
QuarantineEventsV2
When you try to open or run that app, 
or any app installed from a quarantined disk 
image, archive or installer bundle, the Finder 
notiﬁes Gatekeeper, which performs a full 
check on its signature(s). This ensures that, 
if a signature has been revoked, for example, 
macOS will refuse to run it and compromise 
security. If the app passes that check, or you 
opt to run it without a valid signature, a ﬂag 
in the xattr is changed to indicate that the 
full check has been performed successfully, 
and Gatekeeper won’t be asked to check it 
as thoroughly again.
Don’t try to circumvent these checks by 
using tools like curl that bypass them, or by 
tampering with the quarantine xattr: they’re 
there to protect you from malware.
HOW CAN I RUN AN 
UNSIGNED APP 
IN SIERRA?
The simplest way is to 
select the app in Finder 
and use Finder’s Open 
command to open it. The 
ﬁrst time you do this after 
downloading the app, 
you’ll have to opt to open 
the app despite its missing 
signature, but once it has 
been run, full Gatekeeper 
checks are not repeated.
 
 
 
 
 
 
HOW MUCH FREE SPACE 
DO I NEED ON SSD FOR 
macOS HIGH SIERRA?
In addition to the space 
needed for a major macOS 
update, if you start up 
from an SSD, the installer 
will need extra free space 
to convert it to APFS. It is 
not readily predictable, but 
most upgraders will ﬁnd 
10GB of space an absolute 
minimum, with 50GB much 
more comfortable.
> Finder Favorites stuck
When upgrading to a new MacBook Pro, I can’t rearrange 
the order of items in Finder windows’ Favorites, something 
which used to work ﬁne. Although I can drag them into the 
order I want, they revert to standard when I next start up. 
Is this a corrupt preference ﬁle, and how can I ﬁx it?

This happens if your Mac has two keychains 
it needs to open, neither of which uses your 
current password. This probably resulted 
from changing your login password, but that 
change not being reﬂected in your keychains.
When you enter your login password, it’s 
used for two functions: to open access as 
that user, and to open that user’s default 
keychain, the one named login. If the 
password used for the login keychain no 
longer matches that used to log in, when 
the Mac comes to open the user’s login 
keychain, it discovers that the password it 
has doesn’t match that for that keychain, 
so it will prompt you to enter the current 
password for that keychain.
You can ﬁx this using Keychain Access, in 
the Utilities folder. Start that app, and select 
your login keychain at the left of the window. 
In the Edit menu, use the Change Password 
for Keychain “login”… command, and change 
the password to the same password you use 
when logging in to your Mac.
You may need to open the Local Items 
keychain and copy-and-paste items from that 
into your login keychain so that macOS will 
never need to open that keychain either.
This should ensure that each time you log 
in to your Mac from now on, macOS can open 
the login keychain without any need for the 
separate alert, and that it can ﬁnd all the 
information it needs there.

When I start my MacBook Pro up and log in, I’m prompted for my password for two 
keychains, named Local Items and login. How can I stop this?
HOW DO I FIX ERRORS WHEN BACKING

You can work around Time Machine errors 
such as this by adding your iCloud Drive to its

HOW DO I USE AN APFS SSD OR USB

Recompose shots in Photoshop
Use Content-Aware Fill in Photoshop to rework your images
REQUIRES
Photoshop CC, and a 
picture to recompose 
YOU WILL LEARN
What Content-Aware Fill is 
and how best to use it
IT WILL TAKE
30 minutes
HOW TO Give your image more space
Find a suitable image
Not all images are great for content-
aware cropping. Lots of really ﬁne detail, or 
faces, at the frame’s edge can cause problems. 
Landscapes like the above, with lots of sky, are 
likely to work better. If only it weren’t tilted…
Set up the Crop tool
Press C to select the Crop tool, and 
note the new options immediately above your 
image. The ﬁrst thing to check is that the ﬁrst 
pop-up menu, which lets you pick the aspect 
ratio of the image, is set to Original Ratio.
 
GENIUS TIP
When cropping an image, 
consider cycling through 
Photoshop’s composition 
guides — select the Crop 
tool and hit O (the letter) 
— for composition ideas.
IT USED TO be that cropping 
an image went only one way 
— smaller. Cropping in to an 
image usually means making 
the subject of your shot bigger, and 
discarding pixels around the edge of the 
frame. This is useful; not only does it 
mean you can draw attention to your 
subject, which is helpful if it’s small, but 
you can also reposition it in the frame if 
it’s strangely placed to begin with.
With Photoshop CC, cropping doesn’t 
necessarily mean zooming in. Take 
rotating a shot, for instance. Ordinarily, 
rotating an image creates white space at 
its corners, but Photoshop automatically 
constrains your image — that is, makes 
it smaller — to avoid this white space 
vkrzlqj#xs#lq#|rxu#Ľqdo#lpdjh1#Wkh#

and colors nearby. DAVE STEVENSON

Use the straightener
Photoshop’s Straighten tool enables 
you to draw a line along the horizon and level 
the image to it automatically. Hold Cmd, then 
drag across the horizon of your image. When 
you let go, your image will level up.
Make the magic happen
With your image level, you’ll notice you 
now have grey and white checkerboard at the 
corners. Ordinarily you’d delete these, along 
with some of the image. Instead, make sure 
Content-Aware is checked, and press Return.
QUICK LOOK The Crop tool’s options
BLANK BITS
A blank area shows up as  
grey/white checkerboard. 
This will print as white, 
and needs to be dealt with 
to produce a great result.
CHECK IT
The all-important Content-
Aware checkbox. When it’s 
filled with a check mark 
here, Photoshop will work 
its magic on blank areas.
OVERLAYS
This spiral overlay is 
known as the golden ratio, 
but others are available. 
The grid is valuable for 
getting images level.
ASPECT RATIO
You can keep the image’s 
original aspect ratio, but 
others are available from 
this pop-up — square is 
good for Instagram, say.
LEVEL IT UP
The Straighten tool won’t 
make wonky lines straight 
but turns sloping horizons 
level — a real boon for all 
landscape photographers.
 
GENIUS TIP
Unlike many Photoshop 
tools, the Crop tool can 
work destructively. You 
can make a backup of 
images before using it, 
just in case, or otherwise, 
uncheck Delete Cropped 
Pixels in the Options bar, 
and you can later choose 
Image > Reveal All to 
restore excluded areas.

Content-Aware Fill
Press Shift+F5, or choose Edit > Fill, 
and you’ll see the Content-Aware Fill dialog. 
Make sure the pop-up at the top of it reads 
“Content-Aware,” then press Return. You’ll 
then ﬁnd that the pattern disappears.
More space
Press Return to see the recomposed 
image. Thanks to the Content-Aware Fill, which 
has ﬁlled-in the extended canvas area very 
credibly, you can give your photo’s subject 
more space and add a convincing background.
Get closer
For images you’re using online, this is 
all you have to do. For those you’ll print, it’s 
worth being more detail-oriented. Look at the 
ﬁne details, and look for repeating patterns 
generated by the content-aware crop process.
Fill again 
If you still have a repeating pattern, try 
repeating the Content-Aware Fill process. The 
result will change each time, so just stop when 
you achieve a less obvious result, then press 
Cmd+D to deselect the area you changed.
Beyond boundaries
Content-aware cropping also enables 
you to zoom out as well as in. Here, we’d like 
our volcano to be a bit smaller in the frame, so 
we can run text around it. Press C, then drag 
the box beyond the original shot’s boundaries.
Outline the pattern
This repeating pattern is subtle, but will 
stand out in a big print. It’s easy to ﬁx, though. 
Press L to select the Lasso tool, then draw 
loosely around the pattern you want to ﬁx. An 
accurate outline, in this case, is unimportant.
 
JARGON BUSTER
Some tools in Photoshop 
are destructive, meaning 
they change image data 
for good — at least once 
you close the file, which 
clears the undo history. 
This includes many 
brushes and retouching 
tools, and adjustments not 
applied as adjustment 
layers (which are 
nondestructive).

the web, or doing something else, the app 
tracks the time you spend on each task.
The app uses the Pomodoro technique, 
a method that’s used to focus on tasks 
and avoid distractions, dividing your time 
into work and rest periods. A timer is 
started and you work until it counts down 
wr#}hur/#zkhq#dq#dodup#ru#qrwlĽfdwlrq#

OCRTOOLS is capable of translating 
the text you capture in up to 37 
languages. You can choose which 
languages to use, and then convert 
text from an image that’s in another 
language, converting and translating 
it all within the same app.
This feature alone can prove useful 
if you’re researching a subject from old 
documents that aren’t available in your 
own language(s). Note, however, that 
this feature uses an Internet-based 
service, so avoid using it to translate 
personal or otherwise sensitive info.

Trying to convert text from an 
image where the text is not straight 
can produce some unusual results. 
Here’s an example of what you might 
get from a document that’s askew.

language” pop-up in the top bar and 
pick a language to translate to. Again, 
be patient as the app does its work.
 
Fine-tune an image 
If you don’t have an app that 
can rotate images arbitrarily, try 
ToyViewer (Free, bit.ly/mltoyviewer). 
Choose Operation > Rotate, enter an 
angle, click OK, then save as a new ﬁle.
Use the text 
You can now manipulate the 
text in the middle pane of OCRTOOLS. 
Select some and then copy and paste 
it into your preferred editing app using 
the same methods you’d normally use.
 
Copy and paste
The translation will eventually 
appear in the window’s bottom pane. 
You can interact with it there in exactly 
the same ways as with the converted 
text in the middle pane, enabling you 
to copy and paste it into another app.
 
Three panels 
Now open OCRTOOLS. When 
you ﬁrst do so, you’ll be presented with 
three totally empty panels. This may 
seem unusual, but once you start using 
the app it’ll soon begin to make sense.

QUICK LOOK iBetterCharge’s interface
HOW OFTEN DOES this happen 
in your life: you’re rushing out 
somewhere and grab your 
iPhone to take with you, but 
discover it is down to 20% charge. Or 
maybe the niggling situation for you

to run out. It’s frustrating when you need 
to use an iOS device and realize its battery 
needs charging. One solution to this is to 
monitor the charge on your Mac.
iBetterCharge is a free tool that shows 
the battery level of your iOS devices in 
your Mac’s menu bar. Once set up, it 
works wirelessly, enabling you to see 
whether devices using your home’s Wi-Fi 
network, but not necessarily in the same 
room as you, need charging. You can

The main limitation is that although 
any number of devices can be added, they 
must all sync with the same account in 
iTunes on your Mac. ROLAND WADDILOVE

10 minutes
ADD NEW DEVICE
Use the menu bar icon to 
identify an iPhone or iPad 
you want to monitor. Any 
number of devices can be 
added, provided they sync 
with your iTunes account.
PREFERENCES
Never forget to charge 
your devices again. In the 
app’s preferences you can 
configure it to notify you 
when a device’s battery 
falls below a certain level.
CONNECT 
THE CABLE
To add an iOS device to 
iBetterCharge, first 
connect it to your Mac 
using a USB cable. Once it 
has been identified to the 
app, it can be unplugged.
MONITOR YOUR 
BATTERY LEVELS
Click iBetterCharge’s 
menu bar icon and you’ll

each of your configured 
devices, listed by name, 
with percentage level.

SET UP NOTIFICATIONS
Trust your device
When an iPhone or iPad is 
connected, iBetterCharge detects it 
and this message appears. You might 
need to wake the iOS device, unlock it 
and tell it to trust your Mac.
Being able to see the charge status of 
your iPhone by clicking an icon in your 
Mac‘s menu bar is useful, especially if 
you’ve left it in another room. This 
capability is great for monitoring 
shared devices like the family iPad, too, 
which may be used by your partner or 
kids and left around the house with 
little charge. If you set iBetterCharge to 
display notiﬁcations when a device’s 
battery falls below a certain level, you 
can take action before it becomes a 
problem. Now there’s no excuse for 
your iOS devices’ batteries being ﬂat.
Get iBetterCharge
iBetterCharge is free, but is not 
in the Mac App Store. Download it from 
softorino.com/ ibettercharge. Double-
click the zip ﬁle and then drag the app 
to your Applications folder.
Sync over Wi-Fi
Open iTunes, if it doesn’t open 
automatically when you connect your 
iOS device. Click the device icon (top 
left), then enable “Sync with this 
[device] over Wi-Fi” under Options.
 
Conﬁgure warnings
Click iBetterCharge’s menu bar 
icon and choose Preferences. In the 
Notiﬁcations tab, set the warning level 
where you like between 5% and 50%, 
and set whether you see banners, hear 
sounds, or have the app’s icon animate.
 
First run
The ﬁrst time you open the app, 
some introductory pages will be shown. 
Click through them until you get to this 
page. Notice how the app adds an icon 
to the menu bar for quick access.
 
View your devices
iBetterCharge can now connect 
wirelessly to your device, and displays 
its battery level provided the device is 
connected to your Wi-Fi network. 
Repeat these steps for all your devices.
 
Ignore devices
You might want to monitor all 
your iOS devices’ batteries. However, 
you can ignore select devices if you 
wish and choose to monitor only your 
kids’ iPad, say. To select devices, click 
Ignore List in the app’s preferences.
 
Add a device
Either click Start in the app’s 
main window, or click the app’s menu 
bar icon and choose “Add New Device.” 
To add your iPhone or iPad you must 
ﬁrst connect your device over USB.

Picniic’s main interface. Take some time 
to familiarize yourself with the various panels 
— the colorful layout is fairly easy to learn.

Add a shared entry 
When you tap the calendar panel, say, 
and add a new entry, remember that it’ll be 
visible to your whole family. Consider what 
should be included and what’s personal —  
maybe keep the latter in iOS’s Calendar app.
Unlock extra features 
Some features require you to pay for 
a premium subscription. They include a meal 
planner, a family locator (or you could use 
Find My Friends), an encrypted locker for info. 
Annual subs are far better value than monthly.
 
POWERFUL

You can create multiple 
shopping lists by tapping

them off, or Start Over to 
clear all checked items or 
to delete the whole list.

This feature imports the 
contents of calendars 
from other services, 
rather than maintaining a 
persistent connection to 
them. In Apple’s Calendar 
app, say, create a new 
calendar, move family 
events to it, and then 
connect to it in Picniic.

QUICK LOOK Get Siri to tell you who’s calling
SIRI DOES MUCH more than 
simply answer your queries 
and tell you jokes. It can also 
be used to announce who is 
trying to contact you, interrupting an 
incoming call’s ringtone for a brief 
moment to tell you the caller’s name.

ensure each person’s ringtone is set to 
vrphwklqj#wkdw#lghqwlĽhv#wkhp#xqltxho|/#
or at least their connection to you.
As well as being useful if you have 
vision problems, having Siri announce a 
caller’s identity means you don’t have to 
Ľvk#durxqg#lq#d#srfnhw#ru#edj#dqg#fkhfn#
your phone’s display — and it works if 
you’re using headphones too, which is

It also helps when driving, keeping you

not one of your contacts.

your phone is not muted, 
Siri will say who is calling.

>>>Create
92   JAN 2018  maclife.com

HOW TO Set up call announcements
 
Make your choice
There are four possible behaviors. 
You can get your iPhone to always announce 
whenever an incoming call is received. With 
Always selected, caller announcements can 
play through your iPhone’s built-in speaker.
Use with headphones
The car option also announces calls 
through your headphones. If you want Siri 
to announce calls only when you’re using 
headphones, not when your car’s hands-free 
system is connected, pick Headphones Only.
Use in a car
Select “Headphones & Car” and Siri can 
announce callers through your car’s Bluetooth 
audio system. You can’t enable announcements 
for the car only and not your headphones. This 
is so that it works with hands-free headsets.
 
Accepting a call
Now when your iPhone rings, provided 
it is not muted, Siri will speak to tell you who 
is calling, so you won’t have to pick up (or even 
glance at) your phone to ﬁnd out. Either accept 
or decline, or let it ring out to voicemail.
 
BLOCK UNWANTED 
INTERRUPTIONS
To prevent Siri announcing 
unwanted repeat callers, 
tap “i” next to their 
numbers in the Phone app 
Recents tab, then “Block 
this Caller.” Or, make use 
of bit.ly/hiyaapp to send 
pests direct to voicemail.
 
AIRPODS 
ASSISTANCE
You can set AirPods to 
become the active mic 
when you insert one into 
an ear. In Settings > 
Bluetooth, tap the “i” 
next to your AirPods and 
ensure Automatic Ear 
Detection is enabled. Also 
choose whether both 
pods or a specific one will 
function as a microphone.
Dig into Settings
If you want Siri to announce who is 
calling you whenever your iPhone rings, then 
you need to go to the top level of the Settings 
app. In the ﬁfth group of features down, which 
begins Accounts & Passwords, tap Phone.
Find the correct option
The option you want on the item 
settings page is the very ﬁrst one under the 
Calls heading: Announce Calls, which has 
Never next to it by default. Tap that option 
to see the other available choices.

HOW TO Get notiﬁcations of matching auctions
Name the search
You can now type in a custom name for 
the search to make it easily identiﬁable in your 
list of saved searches. Far more important are 
the other two options, which determine where 
you’re notiﬁed of new auctions.
Get notiﬁcations on iOS
If you’re desperate for a particular 
item, consider enabling “Phone alerts” too, so 
notiﬁcations of matching items are delivered 
straight to your iOS device’s screen, and set an 
appropriate type of notiﬁcation — see sidebar.
Enable email alerts
If you ﬂick the switch next to “Email 
alerts,” you‘ll receive emails whenever new 
items matching your criteria are listed. This is 
helpful if you’re looking for rare items or don’t 
mind getting notiﬁed of every matching item.
 
Save your search
When you’ve applied your desired 
options to your search, tap the Save button to 
store it. Ensure you’ve enabled notiﬁcations in 
Settings (see “Take Control”) to be told when 
auctions that match your criteria are listed.

previous page). Finally, 
on iPhone, allow eBay to 
use cellular data.
 
TAKE 
CONTROL
 
iOS 11 has a new setting, 
Show Previews, at the top 
of Settings > Notifications. 
If set to When Unlocked or 
Never, consider overriding 
it for eBay alone: tap eBay 
further down that page 
and set the Show Previews 
there to Always, to see at 
a glance if an auction alert 
is urgent without having 
to touch your device.
 
Perform a search
Tap Search in the bottom bar. On the 
next page, type keywords into the search ﬁeld, 
then tap Search on the keyboard. Try to be as 
detailed as possible in your description to 
drill down to the exact item you want.
Tap to save
When you conduct the search, all of the 
auctions that match your search criteria will be 
listed. Instead of scrolling down the results on

such as Mail and Facebook, text size will 
grow accordingly (or shrink, if you wish).
Make text bolder
The option below Text Size (or

Use Smart Invert
In General > Accessibility > Display 
Accommodations, you could always 
invert colors; but Smart Invert now 
reverses interface colors but not media. 
Alas, while it works for Photos, it doesn’t 
work for images in Safari.
Read out a selection
Use the Speaking Rate slider to 
preview how fast the OS will talk. Then 
switch to another app, select some text, 
and tap Speak. Note how the current 
sentence is underlined, and words are 
highlighted as they are spoken. 
Type to Siri
If you want to use Siri somewhere 
you have to be quiet, turn on General > 
Accessibility > Siri > Type to Siri. When 
Siri is activated, you now type in your 
query. Note, however, that this entirely 
overrides voice input functionality.
Auto-brightness
The iOS auto-brightness toggle 
used to be in Display & Brightness. Apple 
now thinks you should leave it on, so has 
hidden it. If you “think different,” you can 
now ﬁnd it in General > Accessibility > 
Display Accommodations.
Increase contrast
If you have trouble dealing with 
the semi-transparent interface elements 
peppered throughout iOS 11, you can 
make them look more solid. In General > 
Accessibility, tap Increase Contrast, and 
then Reduce Transparency.
Fine-tune 3D Touch
On an iPhone with 3D Touch, go to 
General > Accessibility > 3D Touch. In this 
pane, you can disable the feature entirely 
if you regularly trigger it accidentally, or 
you can adjust its sensitivity so that it 
requires a ﬁrmer press before activation.
Reduce motion
Had your ﬁll of iOS 11’s dizzying 
animations, such as folder zooms, and 
the app switcher? Most of them can be 
stilled by turning on Reduce Motion in 
General > Accessibility. Auto-playing 
Messages effects are toggled separately.
Turn on mono audio
Listening out for someone? Want 
to use just one earbud, keeping the other 
ear free, without missing half your stereo 
track? Use General > Accessibility > Mono 
Audio to mix the left and right channels 
into a mono signal sent to both channels.
Turn on speech
Few people use speech on macOS, 
but it’s great for prooﬁng your written 
documents. We suspect even fewer 
realize iOS is capable of the same. Go to 
General > Accessibility > Speech, and turn 
on Speak Selection to get started.

Contents subject to change
IN 2009, RUMORS emerged that Apple 
was working on a tablet computer. By the 
end of the year it was the talk of the 
industry. Not the computer industry — 
the publishing industry.
Adobe helped Condé Nast mock up its 
tech magazine, Wired, on a touchscreen, 
while Bonnier, publisher of Popular 
Science, and design studio Berg 
produced a widely shared video of what 
it called “Mag+.” Interactive magazines, 
like CD-ROMs in the 1990s, were to be 
the next digital content revolution.
On January 27, 2010, a visibly unwell 
Steve Jobs unveiled the iPad at San 
Francisco’s Yerba Buena Center for the 
Arts, although it was two months from 
shipping. Highlighting how users of 
iPhones and MacBooks were using them 
for web browsing, music and video, 
games and e-books, he proposed 
a “third category of device” that 
was “better at these tasks” — 
unlike the then contemporary 
netbooks, which Jobs pointed 
out weren’t “better at anything.”
Conﬁrming the name “iPad,” 
which many had dismissed as 
unintentionally amusing, Jobs 
showed off “the best web 
browsing experience you’ve ever 
had” and the full-size on-screen 
keyboard, “a dream to type on.” 
Later, Jobs said his ﬁrst 
inspiration for the iPad was 
imagining typing on glass. 
Work on the device had started 
in the early 2000s, eventually 
spinning off into the iPhone.
Software chief Scott Forstall took to 
the stage to explain how the iPhone OS 
(later iOS) had been adapted to the big 
screen. But no publishers were invited to 
unveil their interactive concepts. Jobs 
had reacted angrily to Time, Inc.’s 
premature demonstration of a digital 
Sports Illustrated for the anticipated 
Apple tablet. With Wired and Popular 
Science, this would become a top-selling 
digital edition — but the iPad never did 
transform publishing. Instead, just as 
Steve had predicted, its versatility and 
simplicity made it the new consumer 
choice in portable computing.
