Estimated lab time: 60 minutes 
Exercise 1.1 
Performing a Clean Installation 
Overview 
 
In this exercise, you install Windows Server 2012 on a new computer 
with no previously installed operating system. 
Mindset 
In many cases, organizations purchase servers without operating systems 
installed—sometimes called bare metal servers—either because they have 
an existing license agreement or because they intend to purchase the OS 
through another channel. In these cases, you perform what is known as a 
clean operating system installation, which is a procedure that creates a new 
server with its default operating system settings. 
Completion time

Exercise 1.2 
Performing an Upgrade Installation 
Overview 
 
In this exercise, you install Windows Server 2012 on a computer 
running Windows Server 2008 R2. 
Mindset 
Assuming that a server meets all the requirements and has compatible 
drivers and applications installed, it is possible to perform an in-place 
upgrade, which retains all the system’s software, data, and configuration 
settings. However, the more complex the server configuration, the more 
likely it will be for incompatibilities to arise, resulting in an end result that 
is unstable or otherwise problematic. 
Completion time 
20 minutes 
  1. Log on to the SVR-SO-B computer using the domain Administrator account and the 
password Pa$$w0rd, which loads Windows Server 2008 R2 and displays the Server 
Manager console. 
  2. Using Server Manager, determine which roles are installed on the server and make a note 
of them in the space on your worksheet. 
 
 
  3. Click Start > Run. The Run dialog box appears. 
 

                                                                                                                             Lab 1: Installing Servers   5  
 
 
 
 
  4. In the Open text box, type d:\setup.exe and click OK. The Windows Setup window for 
Windows Server 2012 appears. 
  5. Click Install Now. The Get important updates for Windows Setup page appears. 
  6. Click No thanks. The Select the operating system you want to install page appears. 
  7. Select Windows Server 2012 Datacenter (Server with a GUI) and click Next. The License 
terms page appears. 
  8. Select I accept the license terms and click Next. The Which type of installation do you 
want? page appears. 
  9. Click Upgrade: Install Windows and keep files, settings, and applications. The 
compatibility report page appears.  
Question
3 
Under what conditions would the Upgrade option not be 
available to you during the Windows Server 2012 installation 
process.  
10. Review the compatibility information provided and click Next. The Upgrading Windows 
page appears. 
Question
4 
The compatibility notes that appear during this exercise are 
recommendations; they do not prevent you from performing 
the upgrade. However, in a real-world upgrade situation, this 
might not be the case. Give an example of a compatibility 
note that will stop the upgrade process and force you to take 
action before restarting the installation.  
11. The upgrade process installs Windows Server 2012 and any compatible applications that 
existed on the server before you began the upgrade. The computer restarts several times 
and ends up on the main logon screen. 
NOTE 
The length of time required for the Windows Server 2012 
upgrade process can be 20 minutes or more, depending on 
the number and type of applications, files, and configuration 
settings on the computer at the outset.   
12. Press Ctrl+Alt+Del and log on using the Administrator account and the password 
Pa$$w0rd. The Windows Server 2012 desktop appears and Server Manager loads. 
13. Click Local Server in the left pane, take a screen shot of the Properties window by 
pressing Alt+Prt Scr, and then paste it into your Lab 1worksheet file in the page provided 
by pressing Ctrl+V. 
 

6  Installing and Configuring Windows Server 2012  
 
14. Using Server Manager, determine which roles are installed on the server and make a note 
of them in the space on your worksheet. 
 
 
 
Question
5 
What proof do you have that the procedure just completed 
has upgraded the operating system on the computer and not 
just performed a new, clean installation?  
 
End of exercise. You can leave the windows open for the next exercise. 
Exercise 1.3 
Installing Windows Server Migration Tools 
Overview 
 
In this exercise, you install the Windows Server Migration Tools, 
which enable you to migrate roles from an existing server to a new 
server running Windows Server 2012. 
Mindset 
Compared to an in-place upgrade, a side-to-side migration is a more 
complex procedure, but usually results in a more stable server 
configuration. Windows Server 2012 includes tools that facilitate the 
migration of certain roles, but before you can use them, you must deploy 
those tools on both the source and the destination server. 
Completion time 
10 minutes 
 
  1. Select the SVR-SO-A computer, on which you installed Windows Server 2012, 
previously in this lab. SVR-SO-A will be the destination server in the migration. 
  2. Press Ctrl+Alt+Del. The Windows login page appears, with the Administrator user 
account.  
  3. In the Password text box, type Pa$$w0rd and press Enter. The Server Manager console 
loads. 
  4. In Server Manager, click Manage > Add Roles and Features. The Add Roles and 
Features Wizard appears, displaying the Before you begin page.  
  5. Click Next. The Select installation type page appears. 
  6. Click Next to accept the default Role-based or feature-based installation type. The Select 
destination server page appears. 

                                                                                                                             Lab 1: Installing Servers   7  
 
 
 
 
  7. Click Next to accept the default settings, which install the selected roles and features to 
the local server. The Select server roles page appears. 
  8. Click Next to continue. The Select features page appears (see Figure 1-2). 
 
 
Figure 1-2 
The Select features page of the Add Roles and Features Wizard  
 
  9. Select the Windows Server Migration Tools check box and click Next. The Confirm 
installation selections page appears.  
10. Click Install. The wizard installs the Windows Server Migration Tools feature. 
11. When the installation is completed, click Close. The wizard closes. 
12. To install the Windows Server Migration Tools on SVR-SO-C, the source server in the 
migration, you must create a distribution folder on SVR-SO-A and populate it with the 
installation files for the tools. To create a distribution folder for the Windows Server 
Migration Tools on SVR-SO-A, open the Start screen and right-click anywhere around 
the border to display the icon bar. 
Question
6 
Why can you not install the Server Migration Tools to the 
server running Windows Server 2008 server using the Add 
Roles and Features Wizard on your server running Windows 
Server 2012?  
13. Click All apps. The Apps page appears. 
14. Right-click Command Prompt and, from the icon bar, select Run as administrator. An 
Administrator: Command Prompt window appears. 

8  Installing and Configuring Windows Server 2012  
 
15. At the prompt, type cd \windows\system32\ServerMigrationTools and press Enter. 
16. At the prompt, type SmigDeploy.exe/package/architecture “amd64” /os WS08R2/ 
path “C:\users” and press Enter. The program creates the Windows Server Deployment 
Tools distribution folder in the specified location. 
17. Take a screen shot of the Command Prompt window by pressing Alt+Prt Scr and then 
paste it into your Lab 1 worksheet file in the page provided by pressing Ctrl+V. 
18. To share the distribution folder, in the Command Prompt window, type net share 
WSMT=C:\Users. 
End of exercise. You can leave the windows open for the next exercise. 
Lab 
Challenge 
Accessing a WSMT Distribution Point 
Overview 
 
After completing Exercise 1.3, a user on SVR-SO-C, the source server 
for the migration, can access the installation files for the Windows 
Server Migration Tools from the distribution point on the destination 
server, SVR-SO-A. 
Mindset 
After creating a distribution point for the Windows Server Migration Tools 
on the server running Windows Server 2012, the source server can access 
the distribution point over the network, or by copying the files on a portable 
storage device. 
Completion time      10 minutes 
To complete the challenge, you must install the Windows Server Migration Tools on 
SVR-SO-C by accessing the shared distribution folder on SVR-SO-A and running the 
Smigdeploy.exe program with no parameters from an Administrative command prompt. 
Then, take a screen shot of the Command Prompt window by pressing Alt+Prt Scr and 
then paste it into your Lab 1worksheet file in the page provided by pressing Ctrl+V. 
HINT 
The distribution folder is already shared on SVR-SO-A, but 
before SVR-SO-C can access the share, you must turn on 
File and Printer Sharing on SVR-SO-A.

Lab 
Challenge 
Using the Server Core Interface 
Overview 
 
After completing Exercise 2.3, the SVR-MBR-B server is left in the 
Server Core interface. Users must work from the command line to 
perform administrative tasks. 
Mindset 
Microsoft now recommends Server Core as the default installation option 
for Windows Server 2012. Users should become familiar with the basic 
command prompt and Windows PowerShell tools, because it might not be 
practical to install the GUI whenever additional server configuration is 
required. 
Completion time

Lab 4: Configuring File and Share Access    29 
Exercise 4.3 
Working with NTFS Permissions 
Overview 
 
In this exercise, you demonstrate the use of NTFS permissions in 
combination with share permissions. 
Mindset 
The use of share permissions and NTFS permissions together can be 
confusing, especially when there are multiple administrators working 
on the same servers. Permissions should, therefore, be dictated by a 
company policy adhered to by everyone. 
Completion time 
15 minutes 
  1. On SVR-MBR-C, in File Explorer, right-click the Accounting folder you created in 
Exercise 4.1 and, from the context menu, select Properties. The Accounting Properties 
sheet appears. 
  2. Click the Security tab (see Figure 4-1).

click OK. A File Explorer window appears, displaying the contents of the share you 
created in Exercise 4.1. 
10. Open the Budget file, modify the text, and try to save your changes. The system denies 
you access to the file. 
Question
5  
Why are you unable to modify the Budget file, when you have 
the Allow Full Control NTFS permission? 
11. On SVR-MBR-C, log off of the system and then log on again using the Student account 
and the password Pa$$w0rd. 
12. Open File Explorer, browse to the Accounting folder on the E: drive and, as before, try to

Exercise 12.1 
Designing a DNS Namespace 
Overview 
 
Your firm is launching a new division, which will have its own 
DNS namespace, and your first task is to design that namespace by 
specifying appropriate domain and host names for the computers in 
the division. 
Mindset 
Why is it practical and necessary to have a policy in place for the 
naming of your organization’s domains and hosts?  
Completion time 
20 minutes 
1. 
Design a DNS namespace for your organization that conforms to the following 
guidelines. 
• 
The root domain name for the organization is adatum.com. All of the additional domains 
you create must be subordinate to this domain. 
• 
The internal network must be in a different domain from the external network. 
• 
The organization consists of three internal divisions: Sales, Human Resources, and 
Production. Each division must be represented by a separate subdomain in the namespace. 
• 
Each division has departmental servers performing various roles and as many as 200 
workstations, only some of which are shown in the diagram. Your host names should 
identify the function of each computer.  
• 
Three servers on an external perimeter network host the company’s Internet services: Web, 
FTP, and e-mail. These servers must be in the domain adatum.com. 
2. 
On the worksheet shown in Figure 12-1 and in your Lab 12 worksheet file, write the 
domain names and the fully qualified domain names you have selected for the computers 
in the appropriate spaces.

associated pointer (PTR) record check box in the New Host 
dialog box?  
  4. Click Add Host. A DNS message box appears, stating that the resource record was 
created.  
  5. Click OK. A new, blank Add Host dialog box appears. 
  6. Repeat steps 2 to 4 to create Host records for the Internet FTP and Internet e-mail servers 
in your namespace design, using the IP addresses 10.0.0.11 and 10.0.0.12, respectively. 
  7. In the three domains you created in Exercise 12.3, create Host resource records for all of 
the remaining computers in your namespace design, placing each computer within its 
appropriate subdomain; Human Resources, Sales, or Production, using the names you 
specified in your diagram and different IP addresses in the 10.0.0.10 to 10.0.0.30 range. 
       NOTE 
For the purposes of this exercise, the actual IP addresses you use when 
creating your resource records do not matter. In an actual DNS 
deployment, you must either specify an appropriate IP address for each 
host, based on the subnet to which the computer is connected, or rely on 
DHCP to create the resource records for the computers. 

                                                                           Lab 12: Deploying and Configuring the DNS Service   103

Lab 
Challenge       Using Reverse Name Resolution 
Overview 
 
Reverse name resolution is when a resolver sends an IP address to a 
DNS server and receives a host name in return, rather than sending a 
host name and receiving an IP address. 
Completion time 
20 minutes 
To complete this challenge, you must configure the DNS server on SVR-DC-A to perform 
reverse name resolutions for all of the resource records you created in Exercise 12.4.

Challenge 
Confirming GPO Application 
Overview 
 
To complete this challenge, you must demonstrate that the Group 
Policy settings you have created in the Paris Lockdown GPO have 
taken effect on SVR-MBR-C. 
Mindset                    How can you tell when Group Policy settings are active? 
Completion time 
15 minutes 
The SVR-MBR-C computer is located in the Paris OU, and is a member of the Server group. It 
should, therefore, receive the settings you configured in the Paris Lockdown GPO. Prove that 
this is the case by taking screen shots of the computer that demonstrate that the Account 
Lockout Threshold value has changed.  
NOTE 
Before you begin working on SVR-MBR-C, open an administrative 
command prompt and run the gpupdate/force command to refresh the 
computer’s Group Policy settings.

APPENDIX: 
LAB SETUP GUIDE  
 
INTRODUCTION 
Instructors can use the MOAC lab manual for 70-410: Installing and Configuring Windows 
Server 2012 in any one of the following classroom learning environments: 
• Microsoft Labs Online (MLO). Each student requires a basic workstation that accesses virtual 
machines hosted by servers on the Internet. 
• Classroom-based virtual machines. Each student requires a server or workstation capable of running 
as many as three Windows Server 2012 virtual machines simultaneously, using a hypervisor product, 
such as Microsoft Hyper-V or Microsoft Virtual Server. 
• Individual classroom computers. Each student (or group of students) requires three servers running 
Windows Server 2012, connected to an independent local area network.  
Classrooms using the MLO option require no setup or preparation beyond the acquisition of 
credentials providing access to the MLO web site. Each MLO lab consists of an independent 
environment consisting of two or three virtual machines, with all required software already 
installed and configured. Students only have to log on and select the lab they want to 
complete.  
For courses using a classroom-based virtual machine solution, each student must have a 
computer with sufficient memory and other hardware resources to support three instances of 
Windows Server 2012, each running in a separate virtual machine. The instructor or lab 
manager is responsible for outfitting the computers, and for selecting and installing the 
hypervisor product that will support the virtual machines.  
For courses using traditional server hardware, without virtual machines, students must have 
three servers to complete all of the exercises in the lab manual. Each group of three servers 
must be connected to a separate local area network, or to a classroom network configured in 
such a way as to keep each student’s traffic separate from the others. Here again, the instructor 
or lab manager is responsible for designing and implementing the hardware configuration for 
the classroom.  
This document provides operating system setup instructions for each of the labs in the manual. 
For classroom-based solutions, either virtual or traditional, instructors or lab managers are 
responsible for deploying the operating systems needed for each lab and configuring them 
using the individual requirements for each lab, as described in the following sections.  

166  Installing and Configuring Windows Server 2012 
This document includes step-by-step instructions for manual operating system installation and 
configuration. However, many schools already have procedures in place for automating the OS 
deployment and configuration processes. Any method is acceptable, as long as it provides the 
operating environment each lab requires. 
LAB REQUIREMENTS 
For each of the lab sections that follow, there is a table listing the configuration requirements 
for each of the two or three computers required to complete the lab exercises. The column 
headings in each table provide the computer names by which the servers are identified in the 
lab manual.  
The MOAC lab system naming conventions are as follows: 
• System type – Server (SVR) or workstation (WKSTN) 
• Network role – Domain controller (DC), member server (MBR), or standalone (SO) server 
• Instance – A single letter (A, B, or C) uniquely identifying the system in the lab 
Thus, for example, a computer with the name SVR-DC-A is the first server configured as a 
domain controller in a particular lab.  
Lab 1. Installing Servers 
Because it requires students to install and upgrade servers, Lab 1 has some unique setup 
requirements.  One server must be in a bare metal configuration, that is, with all the hardware 
necessary to install and run Windows Server 2012, but with its hard disk completely blank. 
Lab 1 is unique in that it requires Windows Server 2008 R2 to be installed on two of its 
servers. One of these will be upgraded to Windows Server 2012 during the lab, and the other 
will function as the source system for a side-to-side migration.

Lab 2. Configuring Servers  
Lab 2 introduces students to the setup procedures you must perform immediately after 
installing Windows Server 2012. For that purpose, you must first install a domain controller 
for a new domain. The students will then join a second, newly installed server to the domain 
during the lab. 

                                                                                                                     Appendix: Lab Setup Guide   167

Lab 3. Configuring Local Storage  
This lab requires students to work with the Windows Server 2012 storage subsystem. To 
accommodate this, one of the three servers (SVR-MBR-C) must have three hard disks, in 
addition to the one on which the operating system is installed. This is, obviously, most easily 
accomplished in a virtual machine environment. The three disks can be any size, and should be 
in their newly installed—that is, offline—state at the beginning of the lab.

Lab 4. Configuring File and Share Access  
Lab 4 uses an additional hard disk to create and configure shares. The lab is designed to use 
the same hardware configuration as Lab 3, with three additional disks on SVR-MBR-C. 
However, it is also possible to complete the exercises with a single additional disk, or by using 
only the system disk. In these cases, the only changes needed will be to the drive letter that the 
students use to create the directories they will share.

Lab 7. Creating and Configuring Virtual Machine Settings  
In this lab, students practice creating and configuring virtual machines in a Hyper-V 
environment. This presents a problem when the lab environment itself relies on virtual 
machines.  
When, as in the MLO environment, a lab server running Windows Server 2012 is itself a guest 
on a Hyper-V server, you can only install the Hyper-V role using the DISM.exe tool from the 
command line. This is because DISM.exe bypasses the normal prerequisites check. Also, 
although you can create virtual machines on a second generation Hyper-V server (that is, a 
guest Hyper-V server running on a host Hyper-V server), you cannot actually run them.  
Lab 7 is designed so that the lab servers can run as guests on a Hyper-V host server. In a 
virtualized classroom environment, you can provide students with a Hyper-V server running 
three guest servers on virtual machines, and they will be able to complete the labs 
successfully. The labs have not been tested with any other hypervisor products.

Lab 8. Creating and Configuring Virtual Machine Storage  
In Lab 8, students continue their work with Hyper-V virtual machines and, in this case, their 
virtual storage capabilities. For this lab, the two member servers must have the Hyper-V role 
installed prior to the commencement of the lab. As in Lab 7, if you are working in a virtualized 
environment, you must install Hyper-V using the DISM.exe tool from the command prompt. 
As with Lab 3 and Lab 4, this lab requires the SVR-MBR-C server to have three hard disks, in 
addition to the system disk. You must initialize the disks and create simple volumes on them 
before the commencement of the lab.

Lab 16. Creating Group Policy Objects  
In Lab 16, students create Group Policy objects and link them to organizational units. To 
prepare the domain, you must create an OU and a group, and then add the SVR-MBR-C object 
to both, so that the server can receive the settings from the GPO the students create. 
The students’ final challenge in the lab is to demonstrate how the SVR-MBR-C computer has 
received the settings from the GPO. To do this, they must be aware that they can use the 
Resultant Set of Policy (RSOP) snap-in to view a computer’s operative Group Policy settings. 
There is no indication of this in the lab manual, so the instructor should be prepared to give the 
students a hint, if necessary.
