§4-3 Vagueness: Another Option—Resist the Premises
Greg Restall

Resolving the Problem
r1, r1 ⊃r2, r2 ⊃r3, . . . , r9,999 ⊃r10,000 ⊢r10,000
▶The premises seem true,
▶The argument seems valid.
▶The conclusion seems false.

Resolving the Problem
r1, r1 ⊃r2, r2 ⊃r3, . . . , r9,999 ⊃r10,000 ⊢r10,000
▶The premises seem true, but they aren’t all true.
▶The argument seems valid.
▶The conclusion seems false.

Option 3
1. Logic does not apply to vague expressions.
2. Logic does apply, and the argument is not valid.
3. Logic does apply, the argument is valid but one of the
premises is false.
4. Logic does apply, the argument is valid and sound,
and therefore the conclusion is true.

▶The world is modelled by all of the appropriate valuations.
▶Statements are super-true, super-false, and in the gap.
▶Two-valued tautologies are super-true in all supervaluations.

For you to try
Here are three circles,
numbered 1, 2, 3.
Let ri be the statement:
circle i is red,
and let li be the
statement: circle i is large.
Suppose four
acceptable
valuations all make
make l1 and r3 true
and l3 and r1 false,
and r2 and l2 can
be true or false,
independently.
Which of the
following
statements are
super-true?
▶r2
▶r2 ∨∼r2
▶r2 ∨l2
▶r2 ⊃r3

along is not?
