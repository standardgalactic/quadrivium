The Science of Ocean Pollution
The marine environment supports nearly half of the universal primary production, 
and a great share of which drives global fisheries. The Science of Ocean Pollution is 
written and presented in the author’s characteristic conversational style and provides 
comprehensive coverage of the current situation regarding pollution in the world’s 
oceans. Even though our welfare is intricately linked, interconnected with the sea 
and its natural resources, humans have substantially altered the face of the ocean 
within only a few centuries. The face of today’s sea is quite apparent, obvious and 
visible; it floats. This book examines pollution runoff, plastics, oil spills and other 
pollutants that float in our seas as well as methods to best remediate these issues.

Preface
The Science of Ocean Pollution is the tenth volume in the acclaimed series that 
includes The Science of Lithium (Li), The Science of Electric Vehicles (EVs): Concepts 
and Applications, The Science of Rare Earth Elements: Concepts and Applications, 
The Science of Water, The Science of Air, The Science of Environmental Pollution, 
The Science of Renewable Energy, The Science of Waste and The Science of Wind 
Power all of which bring this highly successful series fully into the 21st century. 
The Science of Ocean Pollution continues the series mantra based on good science 
and not feel-good science. It also continues to be presented in the author’s trade­
mark conversational style—making sure communication is certain—not a failure. 
My aim, my goal is to be comprehensive in coverage and comprehensible in that 
which I deliver.
This book is about a serious, growing problem related to an unmanaged commons. 
The unmanaged commons addressed herein is about the practice of polluting the sea, 
the ocean, the marine environment and the unmanaged commons. In The Science 
of Ocean Pollution the facts about the unmanaged commons being polluted every 
day, every hour, every minute and every second are presented in my characteristic 
no-holds-barred, no limits, no political leanings and no nutcase wackoe off the wall 
bologna: Just the facts, ma’am—and everyone else (Thanks, Sgt. Joe Friday).
You may have heard the old saying, idiom, phrase or expression that water is the 
elixir of life on Earth. Having spent the majority of my life studying water, analyzing 
water, drinking water, watering my plants and animals, practicing personal hygiene 
using water, writing about water and teaching environmental health and engineering 
students about water, I have come to realize, early on, that water is indeed the elixir 
of life on Earth.
Now the irony in this statement about water being the elixir of life on Earth is that 
when explained to humans who do not think about water, unless thirsty or dying of 
thirst, is that they agree about the true value of water. But only to a point.
Only to a point?
Yes. The average person learns, usually early on, that water is a must, a have to 
have, a crucial ingredient to maintain his or her good health and life. The problem, 
the irony, is manifested when we forget that we are not the only life on Earth. For 
example, trees, flowers, grass and weeds all require water to survive. And then, there 
are the animals. They are living organisms too … they must have water to survive. 
The problem with the animals on Earth is that most are only visible if they can be 
seen. How about the animals and other lifeforms on Earth that are not normally seen. 
For example, we do not normally view, in their natural environment, fishes, marine 
algae, lichens, birds, invertebrates such as crabs, lobsters, sea stars, urchins, mussels, 
clams, barnacles, snails, limpets, sea squirts, sea anemones and so many more life­
forms in the sea. These listed sea life forms not only depend on water to survive but 
also their survival is important to maintaining life and good health in humans. So, 
the question is why would we or why do we pollute marine environments?

Preface
It is a gross understatement to say that the marine environment is of pronounced 
significance to humankind. Why? Well, consider that more than 20% of the world’s 
population (~1.3 billion people) live within 62.1 miles (100 km) of the coast, a figure 
that is likely to rise up exponentially by 2050. Then, in addition, the marine environ­
ment supports nearly half of the universal primary production, and great share of 
which drives global fisheries.
The bottom line: even though human welfare is intricately linked, interconnected 
with the sea and its natural resources, humans have substantially altered the face of 
the ocean within only a few centuries. The face of today’s sea is apparent, obvious 
and visible; it floats the floatable—in mass.

Prologue—Follow the Float
In 1980 as an officer in the US Navy, I was stationed aboard an amphibious warship 
that was underway from Norfolk, Virginia to Rota, Spain. We navigated the trip via 
the Great Circle Route which is the shortest route between two points on the surface 
of a sphere. After we got underway and were two days in route to Rota I served my 
routine four-hour watch as Officer of the Deck (OOD), navigating the ship along its 
charted track. The ship was equipped with navigation hardware including gyrocom­
pass, magnetic compass and satellite navigation (SATNAV for geospatial position­
ing) aids. And the duty Quartermaster was dutifully plotting our track on the map.
During my OOD watches, I quickly concluded that if all navigation aids available 
to me had failed I would have no problem keeping the ship on the proper course. All 
I needed to do was to ensure that the helmsmen paralleled the stream of garbage that 
was apparent and continuous on our port side during most of the trip.
Later, I found out that scientists call the garbage track I saw and followed the 
North Atlantic Garbage Patch in the North Atlantic Ocean; it is a kissing cousin, 
so to speak, of the better-known Great Pacific Trash Island. My Navy navigator, an 
MIT engineer and environmental science PhD holder, informed me that humans 
are known to produce about 200 billion pounds of plastic and that somewhere near 
10% of this material ends up in the ocean. These plastics accumulate in the sea and 
whirls around one of the five oceanic gyre—regions where currents push water (and 
its plastic face) in an inward circular motion, trapping it in the center. The results of 
this swirling waste are enormous floating garbage heaps.
Today, I often wonder what the floating face on these gyres looks like.

And the Sea Will Show
The earth was formless and void or a waste and emptiness, and darkness was 
upon the face of the deep [primeval ocean that covered the unformed earth]. 
The Spirit of God was moving (overing, brooding) over the face of the waters.
Genesis 1:1 Amplified Bible (2015)
INTRODUCTION
A famous true tale about a double murder was revealed by washed-up debris, an 
odd aluminum container, and beside it, a gold tooth glittered in a scorched human 
skull. This event took place on Palmyra Island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. 
The investigation and murder trial and ultimate conviction of the perpetrator are 
revealed in Bugliosi (of Helter–Skelter fame) and Henderson’s written account and 
later movie And the Sea Will Tell. And the truth be known, the sea did tell. In this 
chapter, And the Sea Will Show, it is shown that the sea does indeed tell, and it also 
shows.
In this book, the term seas, commonly and accurately described as being con­
nected to the ocean or simply the ocean, is used interchangeably with the oceans 
throughout this presentation even though there is a difference between the two, but 
herein the difference is not important.
So, what is important?
What is important is what was said initially in the first paragraph; that is, the sea 
will show. Not only will it show human remains as Bugliosi and Henderson point out, 
but it shows, reveals, uncovers, displays, and brings to light a very pressing problem. 
The problem is apparent to anyone who has sailed the “seven seas” and looked out 
upon the face of the ocean and observed the miles of waste, debris, garbage, rubble, 
trash, and flotsam and jetsam that is clearly visible in and on the floating sea. It is the 
human-deposited substances, materials and chemicals residing on the surface of the 
seas, the floating seas, that are described in this book.
Typically, when thinking about, dreaming about or actually viewing the sea, we 
will see a few characteristics that are part and parcel of the sea environment. For 
instance, we will see waves caused by the wind; that is, if there is any wind. If you 
dip your toes into the sea, you will feel the temperature of the water, and of course, 
you recognize that the sea is water. If you are a fisherperson, you will enjoy trying 
your luck at catching the big one, assuming there are any big ones left in the deep 
blue seas. If you are a diver, you will be exposed to the absolute beauty of the under­
water environment. From above and below the water level, you will observe the 
variety of sea watercolors. Another aspect of viewing the sea that many people sense 
is the mystery—the mystery of what lies below the surface; the unknown.

The Science of Ocean Pollution
One thing is certain; when we look at the face of the sea today, there is no mystery 
when we see the floating sea. There is no mystery because the floating mass covering 
miles of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans and other locations in gyre regions is quite 
visible, discernable and obvious. A gyre is a ringlike system of ocean currents. Note 
that in the Northern Hemisphere, the ocean currents rotate clockwise and in the 
Southern Hemisphere counterclockwise. When these currents rotate, they take along 
billions of passengers, floating passengers on a floating sea.
So, if you haven’t personally observed any of the passengers in the floating seas, 
you might be wondering who or what are the passengers? Let’s start with the “who” 
first. If you consider sea life as a who, microorganisms as a who, washed out to sea 
land animals alive and deceased as a who, and human remains as a who, then we 
can classify floating organisms as the who. The “what” is usually more apparent 
and likely to be observed? In this introductory chapter, the materials, substances, 
chemicals and sound waves that are carried in or on the floating are introduced and 
further described and explained in the chapters that follow. For now, it is important 
to point out the types of passengers (pollutants) carried in and on the floating seas. 
For example, a good starting topic to introduce floating sea passengers is the floating 
garbage such as plastic debris including bags, straws, cutlery, six-pack rings, water 
bottles and other floatable plastics all of which are a huge threat to the survival of 
marine fauna. Plastics are ingested by sea life; it entangles sea life, and it suffocates 
sea life. More is said about the plasticization of the floating seas later in the text.
Other substances that are passengers in and on the floating seas are the pharma­
ceuticals and personal care products called “PPCPs.” PPCPs are a diverse group of 
chemicals that include all drugs [both prescription, over-the-counter medications, 
and even illicit drugs flushed down the toilet or thrown into a water body (river or 
ocean)] and nonmedicinal consumer chemicals, such as the fragrances (musk’s) in 
lotions and soaps and the ultraviolet filters in sunscreens. A short list of topicals and 
other PPCPs include:
•	 Toilet-flushed animal wastes
•	 Prescription and over-the counter therapeutic drugs
•	 Veterinary drugs
•	 Fragrances
•	 Soap
•	 Shampoo, condition, other hair treatment products
•	 Body lotion, deodorant, body powder
•	 Cosmetics
•	 Sunscreen products
•	 Diagnostic agents
•	 Nutraceuticals (e.g., vitamins, medical foods, functional foods, etc.)
•	 Insect repellents
Sunscreen, body lotion, insect repellents, essential oils, hair products, makeup 
and other topicals become part of the face of the floating seas by making their way 
into the water masses via the bodies of swimmers. The other listed substances find 
their way into the floating seas via the toilet, sink, garbage disposals, throw-aways

And the Sea Will Show
or castoffs and from industrial and domestic wastewater treatment systems. The 
statement about industrial and domestic wastewater contributing PPCPs to the float­
ing seas may surprise people. The surprise is manifested when it is thought that 
wastewater treatment removes the listed substances from raw sewage or industrial 
waste before the treated wastestream is outfalled into the receiving body of water. 
While secondary and advanced wastewater treatment unit processes remove most 
solids and pathogens from the raw influent, it is also true that the topicals and other 
PPCPs listed above are not completely removed from the waste stream. And this 
has only recently garnered attention (beginning about 20 years ago). The author 
personally authenticated the presence, the existence of PPCPs in studies conducted 
during the 2015–2017 timeframe using USEPA’s Method 1964 when samples were 
taken at the outfalls of wastewater treatment plants discharging treated wastewater 
into the James, York, and Elizabeth Rivers, the Lower Chesapeake Bay and offshore 
in the Atlantic Ocean in the Hampton Roads Region of Southeastern Virginia. The 
conclusion drawn from this study is that PPCPs persist through wastewater treatment 
unit processes and were subsequently discharged from wastewater treatment plants 
into surrounding surface water and groundwater. At the present time, new develop­
ments in technology have led to improvements in detecting and quantifying PPCPs 
in water, sediments, and fish tissue. Based on the results of sampling, testing and 
analysis of the waters from the Hampton Roads study, it was apparent that PPCPs 
found their way into the aquatic environment and are ubiquitous in the floating seas.
With regard to another study conducted to determine the extent of PPCP contami­
nation of aquatic fauna, the USEPA (2013) reported the following results:
•	 Seven of the 24 pharmaceuticals and 2 of the 12 personal care product 
chemicals were detected in the fish tissue samples, antihistamines, antide­
pressants and musk’s were the most prevalent PPCPs.
Note: For comparative purposes, we like to say that 1-ppm is analogous 
to a full shot glass of water from a standard swimming pool while 1-ppt is 
comparable to one droplet of water from a dropper of water from the same 
pool.
•	 Most pharmaceutical occurred at concentrations low parts per billions 
(ppt), while the musk’s commonly occurred at concentrations of low parts 
per million (ppm).
•	 Fewer PPCPs were detected in fish from discharge areas where facilities 
apply advanced wastewater treatment technologies, such as ozonation.
It is important to point out that despite the recent advances in PPCP research, the 
full extent, magnitude and consequences of their presence in aquatic environments 
are still largely unknown.
The bottom line is that we simply do not know what we do not know about the 
full extent of the environmental impact of PPCPs in our aquatic systems. To a lesser 
extent, we do know and also recognize that in the floating seas, PPCPs negatively 
affect algae, sea urchins, fish and mammals as well as coral reefs in the seas.
Eutrophication is another type of floating sea pollution; it is the process of enrich­
ment of water bodies by nutrients. The problem is that when nutrients in water bodies 

4
The Science of Ocean Pollution
increases, it causes a serious decrease in oxygen levels and in floating seas causes 
dead zones. Currently, it is estimated that there are approximately 400 or more dead 
zones in the floating seas worldwide. When eutrophication in lakes occurs, it nor­
mally contributes to its slow evolution into a bog or marsh and ultimately into dry 
land. Eutrophication can be accelerated by human activities, thereby speeding up the 
aging process. The nutrients involved in the eutrophication process are conveyed by 
freshwater rivers into the floating seas. The rivers receive nutrients from runoff from 
large farming operations and from wastewater treatment plants.
Whenever we spot a contaminant following our environment, we often suffer 
from the Double-D Syndrome.
The Double-D Syndrome?
Yes. Double D for disturbing and disgusting. A perfect example of when the 
Double-D Syndrome may manifest itself happens when beachgoers go to the beach 
for some sun, surf and swimming, and while in the water or walking the shoreline, 
floating on the sea are the contents of several toilet flushes or septic tank failures. 
The floating sea carries these flushed toilet ingredients or former inhabitants of 
someone’s septic tank along on their merry way here, there, everywhere and any­
where. Swimming in a floating mass of raw sewage is definitely a Double-D event … 
but it happens more than one might think or want. How do the disturbing and dis­
gusting materials get into the water? Generally, it is caused by failed infrastructure, 
inappropriately designed treatment systems, overloaded systems, poor maintenance, 
and by-passed treatment systems during storm events or system failures. When the 
floating seas are recipients and transporters of soaps and detergents, human waste­
water, and solid sludge, they are fouled not only to the dislike of humans but also to 
the detriment of aquatic life.
Two other major contributors to the floating seas are the waste materials, chemi­
cals-fertilizers, pesticides, veterinary potions/medicines/hormones, animal and fish 
foods and other assorted ingredients that are the result of agricultural and aquacul­
ture runoff.
With regard to agricultural runoff potentially there are several constituents con­
tributed to the floating seas. The most prevalent source of agricultural pollution is 
soil runoff. Rainwater carries sediments (soil particles) and dumps them in nearby 
streams. The streams, of course, empty into the seas, and with the water flow, some 
of the sediment reaches estuaries and eventually the ocean. When this occurs too 
much sediment clouds the water, reducing the amount of sunlight that reaches aquatic 
plants. It can also smother fish larvae and clog the gills of fish. Another problem with 
agricultural sediment runoff is that it commonly carries passengers such as fertiliz­
ers, pesticides, heavy metals, and other pollutants that wash into the rivers, causing 
algal blooms and depleted oxygen, which is the death nil for most aquatic life.
Nutrient that washes into aquatic ecosystems is another problem with agricultural 
runoff: Nutrients such as phosphorus, nitrogen and potassium in the form of fertil­
izers, sludges and manures. Manure deposited by a large heard of animals that are 
not assimilated through the soil surface and are carried off by storm runoff into local 
streams or other water bodies is a problem. Complicating the issue, it is important 
to point out that agri-business, large-scale, factory-farming practices have created a 
different farm category, the livestock version of factory crop farming: Concentrated 

5
And the Sea Will Show
Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) and the massive quantity of manure produced 
from such operations—the key word is “massive.” In the 1920s, no one was capa­
ble of spilling millions of gallons of manure into a local stream in a single event. 
However, today such an event is possible because of the piling up mountains of 
manure in one place. Simply, the piling up is the result of greater concentration and 
reduced diversity in farm operations.
These businesses don’t use traditional pastures and feeding practices. Typically, 
the manure is removed from the livestock buildings or feedlots and stored—in stock­
piles or lagoon/pond systems—until it can be spread on farm fields, sold to other 
farmers as fertilizer, or composted. When properly designed, constructed and man­
aged, CAFO-produced manure is an agronomically important and environmentally 
safe source of nutrients and organic matter necessary for the production of food, 
fiber and good soil health. Experience had demonstrated that when properly applied 
to land, at proper levels, manure will not cause water quality problems nor end up 
in the floating seas. When properly stored or deposited in holding lagoons or ponds, 
properly conveyed to the disposal outlet, and properly applied to the appropriate end-
use, potential CAFO waste environmental problems can be mitigated.
CAFOs are farming operations where large numbers (often in the thousands of 
animals) of livestock or poultry are housed inside buildings or in confined feedlots. 
How many animals? The USEPA defines a CAFO or industrial operation as a con­
centrated animal feeding operation where animals are confined for more than 45 
days per year. To classify as a CAFO, such an operation must also have over 1000 
animal units—a standardized number based on the amount of waste each species 
produces, basically 1000 pounds of animal weight. Thus, dairy cattle count as 1.4 
animal units each. A CAFO could house more than 750 mature dairy cattle (milking 
and or dry cows) or 500 horses and discharge into navigable water through a man-
made ditch or a similarly man-made device. CAFO classification sets numbers for 
various species per 1000 animal units:
•	 2500 Hogs
•	 700 Dairy Cattle
•	 1000 Beef Cattle
•	 100,000 Broiler Chickens
•	 82,000 Layer Hens
Unless you’ve seen such an operation, getting a grasp on the scope of the problem 
can be difficult. By using comparison, we quantify the issue: How do the amounts 
of CAFO-generated animal manure compare to human waste production? Let’s take 
a look at it.
Here’s a small-scale number: One hog, per day, excretes 2.5 times more waste 
than an adult human—nearly three gallons (Cantrell, Perry, & Sturtz, 2004).
Here’s a medium-scale number: A 10,000-hog operation produces as much waste 
in a single day as a town of 25,000 people (Sierra Club, 2004)—but the town has a 
treatment plant.
Here’s a big picture approach: The USEPA estimates that human uses gener­
ate about 150 million tons (wet weight) of human sanitary waste annually in the 

6
The Science of Ocean Pollution
United States, assuming a US population of 285 million and an average waste gen­
eration of about 0.518 tones per person per year. The USDA estimates that opera­
tions that confine livestock and poultry animals generate about 500 million tons of 
excreted manure annually. The USEPA estimates over 450,000 CAFOs in the United 
States, producing 575 billion pounds of manure annually in the United States today 
(USEPA, 2003).
Here’s the bottom line: By these estimates, all confined animals generate well 
over three times more raw waste than is generated by humans in the United States. 
Much of this waste undergoes no—or very little—waste treatment. Waste-handling 
for any CAFO is a major business concern and expense. Unless regulation and leg­
islation support sound environmental practices for these operations, CAFO owners 
have little incentive to improve their waste-handling practices.
When livestock are not confined but instead are allowed to graze, there is always 
the potential for overgrazing. Overgrazing exposes soils, increases erosion, encour­
ages invasion by undesirable plants (weeds), destroys fish habitat, and can also 
destroy riparian corridors (streambanks and floodplains) where the vegetation is a 
natural water quality filter for contaminants—preventing the pollutants from enter­
ing the floating seas.
Another potential agricultural practice that can affect floating seas is irrigation 
practices. Inefficient irrigation can cause water quality problems. In arid areas, for 
example, where rainwater does not carry minerals deep into the soil, evaporation of 
irrigation can concentrate salts. Excessive irrigation can affect water quality in float­
ing seas by causing erosion, transporting nutrients, pesticides, and heavy metals, or 
decreasing the amount of water that flows naturally in streams and rivers.
Harmful chemical contamination of the floating seas can also result from agricul­
tural practices. Insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides are used to kill agricultural 
pests. These chemicals can enter and contaminate water through direct application, 
runoff and atmospheric deposition. They can poison fish, contaminate food sources 
and destroy the habitat that aquatic life use for protective cover.
Although it is one of those practices that is not well known or thought about by the 
general public, aquaculture is a thriving enterprise that serves the purpose of provid­
ing needed foodstuffs to a hungry population. However, it is or can be a practice of 
concern for those alarmed at the condition of our floating seas. Aquaculture is the 
husbandry, or culture, of marine plants or animals—all life stages of animals includ­
ing fish, mollusks and crustaceans. Aquaculture is undertaken in a variety of ways, 
including fish hatcheries, raceways, ponds, floating or submersible cages or pens, and 
bag, rack or suspended culture.
The wastes or pollutants produced in aquaculture consist of chemicals used in 
maintaining the facility operations and cleanliness, drugs used for disease control, 
and metabolic product such as uneaten food, feces, and ammonia. It is the waste 
produced from feeding the fish that is the bulk of the waste. The uneaten foods can 
be discharged from the aquaculture process as suspended solids, and these can be 
further conveyed to the floating seas.
Another contributing source to the floating seas is industrial waste. When indus­
trial wastes are dumped into the floating seas directly or indirectly by river transport, 
the dumped or conveyed waste materials are dangerous not only to the water and sea 

7
And the Sea Will Show
life but also to the humans who consume the affected and infected sea life. The high 
contaminants include radioactive waste, arsenic, lead, fluoride, cyanide and many 
other pollutants.
The floating sea is turning into vinegar. Well, not quite, but it is going acidic with 
a reduction in pH (see Figure 1.1), caused primarily by the uptake of carbon diox­
ide from the atmosphere. Moreover, chemical additions and subtractions are also 
increasing the floating sea’s pH.
Carbon dioxide (CO2) in Earth’s atmosphere is increasing; it has shown a steady 
rise for many years. The ocean is a “sink” for CO2, so as the sink takes on more and 
more CO2, the dissolved carbon dioxide in the floating seas increases as well.
As the level of CO2 increases in the water of the floating sea chemical reactions 
(aka ocean acidification) occur, reducing seawater pH, carbonate ion concentration 
and saturation states of biologically important calcium carbonate minerals.
Why are the calcium carbonate minerals important? Calcium carbonate min­
erals are building blocks for the shells and skeletons of many marine organisms. 
Organisms such as oysters, clams, sea urchins, shallow water corals, deep-sea corals 
and calcareous plankton are calcifying organisms that need carbonate ions for mak­
ing and maintaining shells and other calcium carbonate.

and graduate student classes, one of the topics or subjects that always gets the

attention of students occurs whenever I classify noise as a floating sea pollutant. The 
truth be told many people do not classify noise as a pollutant, that is, unless you are 
exposed to unwanted sounds—the definition of noise.
How does deep water noise have anything to do with the surface area of the float­
ing sea? Well, consider that much of the unwanted sounds and noise are generated 
on the surface of the sea either from boats, military sonar, underwater construction 
or from oil platforms and from other sources. Human-made noise travels through the 
floating seas affecting and confusing aquatic wildlife, such as whales.
THE BOTTOM LINE
The purpose of the first chapter is to introduce the reader to the pollutants, contami­
nants, impurities, toxins, chemicals and other forms of waste products affecting what 
this book calls our floating seas. So, a detailed discussion on the major pollutant pas­
sengers within and riding on the floating sea is presented in the chapters that follow. 
For now, however, it is important to answer the question: Where do these pollutants 
in the floating seas come from? There first major pollutant source is known as a point 
source. The second major pollutant source is known as a nonpoint source (NPS). A 
Point source is any discernible, confined and discrete conveyance, including but not 
limited to any pipe, ditch, channel, … concentrated animal feeding operation … 
from which pollutants are or may be discharged. This term does not include agricul­
tural stormwater discharges and return flows from irrigated agriculture [33 US 
§ 1362(14)]. A NPS is an entry point of effluent into a water body in a diffuse manner,
so there is no definite point of entry. Examples include agricultural and urban runoff,
construction sites and runoff from mining operations.

Ocean Dumping
The floating ocean and the islands and beaches that once were so fair, that 
humans could find a sandy stretch and relax without much care. Then came the 
remnants of waste cast away by those who didn’t understand, how to protect 
the lakes, rivers, seas and sacred land. They built ramps, dumps, boats to cast 
away their trash that affect fish, and then people use nets, hooks, lines, and 
sinkers to fill their dish. From their dish full of fish became the order of the day 
and their fill, this made sick the people and the rush to fill their wills. To bring 
the people and the oceans back to health, from dire consequences, humans 
must avoid their stealth.
Frank R. Spellman (1996)
OCEAN DUMPING IS NOTHING NEW
The history of unlimited dumping whatever items no longer wanted into the oceans 
was common practice before 1972. The key words just stated are “unlimited dump­
ing” in the seas. Be sure, be certain, take it to the bank that ocean dumping is still 
on-going … on-going in a huge way. One only need to view the floating seas to 
know this to be true. Unfortunately (or maybe fortunately depending on your point 
of view), we cannot see what resides at the bottom of the floating seas.
Anyway, a couple of years ago I performed a non-scientific survey of more than 
60 people from all walks of life about ocean dumping. The purpose of the survey? 
I wanted to get an idea of what people thought of the practice of dumping trash and 
other unwanted items into the oceans. Actually, from the responses I was able to 
obtain I ended up with more information than I expected and much of it quite surpris­
ing to me. For example, I was surprised to find out that many of the respondents not 
only thought dumping trash in the oceans was “no big thing” but also that the practice 
was okay and currently being conducted universally without regulation. The old “out 
of sight out of mind” syndrome—it is gone and therefore no longer thought about.
I guess I should not have been all that surprised by the responses. This is the 
case, of course, because in the past (before 1972), communities around the world 
used the ocean for waste disposal, including the disposal of chemical and indus­
trial wastes, radioactive wastes, trash, munitions, sewage sludge and contaminated 
dredged material. Little to no attention and/or concern was given or expressed to the 
negative impacts of waste disposal on the marine environment. Even less attention 
was focused on opportunities to recycle or reuse such materials. And to this day in 
many countries throughout the globe, the beat goes on, so to speak.
While reviewing many of the comments I obtained from respondents to my ques­
tions about ocean dumping, I noticed a trend of thinking or mindset similar to the 
19th-century Frontier Mentality that settled the wide open western United States 
with the assumption being that the frontier (and the floating seas) has unlimited 
2

The Science of Ocean Pollution
capacity to disperse waste (waste being anything no longer wanted). I noticed that 
this same mindset that humans are superior to all else on Earth and that the oceans 
are endless, unlimited, infinite is prevalent. And so why not use them to dump what 
is no longer needed or wanted? Is this out of sight out of mind idiom at work today? 
Again, yes it is. Partially this is the case but again it is the mindset that the oceans are 
endless just as the Old West was in the United States and dumping unwanted materi­
als in one location will have zero effect on the next location. “If I leave it behind, I 
do not have to look at it, worry about it, or even think about it.” Dumping waste prod­
ucts, for some people, is a catharsis, a release, a cleansing, as it seems. Again, with 
regard to ocean wastes that were frequently dumped in coastal and ocean waters, the 
thinking assumes that marine waters had an unlimited capacity to mix and disperse 
waste. This is the idiom that says, “Dilution is the solution to pollution.” We experi­
ence this dilution is the solution to pollution idiom every day whenever a smokestack 
sends dirty smoke bellowing out into the atmosphere, and the air above the stack is 
so immense that with time and wind it dilutes the smoke, and it is no longer apparent. 
The problem with the dilution is the solution to pollution mindset or idiom is that it 
is totally dependent on two things: frequency of dumping and quantity of pollution. 
Consider, for example, end-of-pipe pollution dumping into a river body—remember, 
all rivers empty into the floating sea. If this particular end-of-pipe pollution is the 
only source of pollution into this particular river, then flow and turbulence within the 
river, if its total stretch is long enough, will dilute the pollution and the downstream 
water will return to normal—depending on what is normal, of course.
The point is that dilution can be the solution only when there are not multiples sources 
of pollution dumped in close proximity with each other. Rivers usually are the locations 
of not one city or town but can be and are locations for one city or town after another. 
When this is the case, dilution is the solution to pollution is not possible because dilution 
can’t occur when pollutants are summarily dumped downstream from one another. In 
the indirect water reuse process, the same issue is apparent. A river with one city or town 
using its water and discharging used water into it is workable. However, when the river is 
home to one settlement after another, dilution may not be the solution to pollution.
We can only guess or estimate the volumes and types of materials disposed in 
ocean wastes in the United States prior to 1972 because no complete records exist. 
However, some reports indicated that vast amounts of waste were ocean dumped. 
USEPA (2021), for example, points out that in 1968 the National Academy of 
Sciences estimated the following annual volumes of ocean dumpy by vessel or pipes:
•	 100 million tons of petroleum products
•	 Two to four million tons of acid chemical wastes from pulp mills
•	 More than one million tons of heavy metals in industrial wastes
•	 More than 100,000 tons of organic chemical wastes
A 1970 Report to the President from the Council on Environmental Quality on 
ocean dumping described that in 1968 the following were dumped in the ocean in 
the United States:
•	 38 million tons of dredged material (34 percent of which was polluted)
•	 4.5 million tons of industrial waste

11
Ocean Dumping
•	 4.5 million tons of sewage sludge (aka biosolids—significantly contami­
nated with heavy metals)
•	 0.5 million tons of construction and demolition debris
EPA records indicate that more than 55,000 containers of radioactive wastes were 
dumped at three ocean sites in the Pacific Ocean between 1946 and 1970. Almost 
34,000 containers of radioactive wastes were dumped at three ocean sites off the 
East Coast of the United States from 1951 to 1962.
Following decades of uncontrolled dumping, some areas of the ocean became 
demonstrably contaminated with high concentrations of harmful pollutants including 
heavy metals, inorganic nutrients and chlorinated petrochemicals. The uncontrolled 
ocean dumping caused severe depletion of oxygen levels in some ocean waters. At 
the mouth of the Hudson River (aka the New York Bight) where New York City 
dumped sewage sludge and other materials, oxygen concentrations in waters near the 
seafloor declined significantly between 1949 and 1969.
Note: Conditions have steadily, if not slowly, improved at the New York Bight. 
Trash still washes ashore from the 12-mile dump site but not all the beaches in the 
area have remained closed, and the potential for steady and safe usage by the public 
seems certain.
Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act
Congress enacted the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA) in 
1972 (aka Ocean Dumping Act). The Act declares that it is the policy of the United 
States to regulate the dumping of all materials which would adversely affect human 
health, welfare or amenities, or the marine environment, ecological systems or eco­
nomic potentialities.
What MPRSA does is it implements the requirements of the London Convention 
(Convention on the Prevention of Marine pollution by Dumping Wastes and Other 
Matter of 1972). The London Convention is one of the first international agreements 
for the protection of the marine environment from human activities. MPRSA con­
sists of Title 1 which contains the permitting and enforcement provisions for regulat­
ing ocean dumping and Title II authorizes marine research.
USEPA uses MPRSA to establish criteria for reviewing and evaluating permit 
applications. USEPA is responsible for issuing ocean dumping permits for materials 
other than dredged material. With regard to dredged material, the U.S. Army Corps 
DID YOU KNOW?
We all understand that air contains oxygen but few of us realize that water also 
contains a small amount oxygen. Oxygen in water is necessary to maintain 
aquatic life. When the same water is overloaded with organics in the presence 
of oxygen, the oxygen is used to biodegrade the organic material. Too much 
organic material in water means oxygen is depleted to the point where it is 
used up and the dissolved oxygen decreases to the point where aquatic life and 
the quality of the water are affected.

The Science of Ocean Pollution
of Engineers (USACE) is responsible for issuing ocean dumping permits, using 
USEPA’s environmental criteria. Permits for ocean dumping of dredged material are 
subject to EPA review and written concurrence. EPA is also responsible for desig­
nating and managing ocean disposal sites for all types of materials (USEPA, 2021).
The site management and monitoring plans (SMMPs) for each designated ocean 
dredge materials disposal site is co-developed by EPA and USACE. Moreover, EPA 
and USACE often work together in conducting oceanographic surveys at ocean dis­
posal sites to evaluate environmental conditions at the site and to determine what 
management actions may be needed.
Environmental regulations employed by EPA and USACE are important because 
they prevent unregulated disposal of wastes and other materials into the ocean which 
results in the degradation of marine and natural resources and poses human health 
risks. For almost 50 years, EPA’s Ocean Dumping Management Program has stopped 
many harmful materials from being ocean dumped, worked to limit ocean dump­
ing generally and worked to prevent adverse impacts to human health, the marine 
environment and other legitimates uses of the ocean (e.g., fishing, navigation) from 
pollution caused by ocean dumping (USEPA, 2021).
Note that EPA under the MPRSA is not the only federal agency that has a role 
with respect to ocean dumping. The USACE, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration (NOAA) and the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) also have roles with 
respect to ocean dumping. While it is true that USEPA has primary authority for 
regulating ocean disposal of all material, it does not have full responsibility for the 
regulation of dredged material disposal in ocean. This responsibility is shared with 
USACE. Maintaining surveillance of ocean dumping is the responsibility of USCG. 
In conducting the long-range research on the effects of human-induced changes to 
the marine environment, it is NOAA’s responsibility.
In addition, USEPA’s Ocean Dumping Management Program coordinates with 
partners at the international, federal, state and local levels, and through interagency 
groups, including National and Regional Dredging Teams, on ocean dumping, 
dredged material management, pollution prevention and marine protection activities.
What’s Being Ocean Dumped Today?
At the current time, the vast majority of material disposed in the ocean is uncon­
taminated dredged material (sediment) removed from our nation’s waterways to sup­
port a network of coastal ports and harbors for commercial, transportation, national

40 CFR 220–229 contains EPA’s ocean dumping regulations and include the 
criteria and procedures for ocean dumping permits and for the designation and 
management of ocean disposal sites under the MPRSA. USACE has published

and 335–337.

defense and recreational purposes. Additional materials disposed in the ocean 
include human remains for burial at sea, vessels, human-made ice piers in Antarctica 
and fish wastes.
What Cannot Be Dumped in the Ocean?
USEPA and the MPRSA ocean dumping regulations prohibit ocean dumping of cer­
tain materials, such as:
•	 Radiological, chemical and biological warfare agents
•	 High-level radioactive wastes
•	 Persistent inert synthetic or natural materials which may float or remain in 
suspension in the ocean in such manner that they may interfere materially 
with fishing, navigation or other legitimate uses of the ocean
•	 Sewage sludge
•	 Materials insufficiently described to permit application of the environmen­
tal impact criteria of 40 CFR 227 subpart B
•	 Medical wastes (isolation wastes, infectious agents, human blood and blood 
products, pathological wastes, sharps, body parts, contaminated bedding, 
surgical wastes and potentially contaminated laboratory wastes, dialysis 
wastes)
•	 Industrial wastes, specifically liquid, solid or semi-solid wastes from a 
manufacturing or processing plant (except on an emergency basis)
•	 Materials containing the following constituents in greater than trace 
amounts (except on an emergency basis): organohalogen compounds, mer­
cury and mercury compounds, cadmium and cadmium compounds, oil of 
any kind or in any for, and known carcinogens, mutagens or teratogens.
Ocean Dumping Ban Act
The 1988 Ocean Dumping Ban Act banned the dumping of industrial wastes, includ­
ing those previously permitted for incineration at sea. Incineration at sea is considered 
to be ocean dumping because the emissions from the stack deposit into the sur­
rounding ocean waters. Moreover, incineration at sea is regulated under the London 
Convention and London Protocol. The London Convention defines “incineration at 
sea” as the deliberated combustion of wastes and other matter on marine incinera­
tion facilities for the purpose of their thermal destruction. Combustion associated

Ocean dumping is usually placed into three lists: Gray list (highly contami­
nated and toxic water); Blacklist (mercy, cadmium, plastic, oil products, 
radioactive waste and anything made for biological and chemical warfare);

Blacklist and those materials that disturb or damage the coral reef ecosystems.

with activities incidental to the normal operation of vessels, platforms and other 
manmade structures is excluded from the scope of this definition. Note that marine 
incineration facility means a vessel, platform or other manmade structure operating 
for the purpose of incineration at sea.
Under the London Protocol, incineration at sea and the export of wastes and other 
materials for incineration at sea are prohibited. The United States has signed the 
London Protocol, which is intended to modernize and eventually replace the London 
Convention; however, the Senate has not ratified the treaty (USEPA, 2021).
Is the 1972 MPRSA Effective?
The ocean is no longer considered an appropriate disposal location for most wastes. 
The driving force for this change was the passage of the MPRSA in 1972; it is the 
major ruling for turning concern toward focus on protecting the marine environment 
and has been quite effective. Today, the United States is at the forefront of protecting 
coastal and ocean waters from adverse impacts due to ocean dumping.

It is estimated that about 80% of marine debris originates as land-based trash 
and the remaining 20% is attributed to at-sea international or accidental dis­
posal or loss of goods and waste. This breakdown can vary depending on fac­
tors like location of landmasses, population densities and behavior of currents 
in surrounding marine waters (Spellman, 2017).

The Plastisphere It Floats
INTRODUCTION
It can be said that one of the major, if not the premier riders, passengers in the 
floating seas (in the plastisphere) is the plastics and, in turn, they carry hitchhikers 
(microbes—bacterial biofilm) here, there and everywhere the plastics roam. And 
many of these plastics and their hitchhikers (hydroids) roam in our oceans and form 
new marine ecosystems.
Whenever I lectured on the Science of Environmental Pollution in my environ­
mental health and some engineering classes at Old Dominion University and short 
courses I taught at Virginia Tech for more than 20 years, in short order, after men­
tioning plastic pollution in both the water and soil environments (the Plastispheres), 
a student would always ask:
“Plastisphere? What is the Plastisphere?”
I was used to this particular query and replied with the same rote answer: “The 
plastisphere is a new marine ecosystem that consists of the four P’s.”
“The four P’s … sounds like you are pitching insurance or something like 
that … ah, just joking, sir.”
Because I like jokes and people with guts, with backbone, with grit, with open 
minds, this question has never bothered me. Instead, I simply turned to the 
chalkboard or the flip charts and with an extra-large black-marker I printed 
the following:

Then I would turn and face a classroom (my classes were always standing room 
only, because of which the students called me “Professor Easy”) and always wit­
nessed the same facial expression and body movements and the scratching of some 
heads as they penciled in on their notepads or typed in on electronic devices my 
equation for plastisphere.
By the way, at every end of course test I gave, I always asked the test taker to 
state my plastisphere equation, for extra credit, of course—a gift from “Professor 
Easy”—on their test score. To my total surprise of the thousands of students I lec­
tured to, only a handful could not remember the equation.
Anyway, an in-depth explanation of the ocean plastisphere(s) is presented later 
in the text. For now, let’s return to important foundational information about plastic 
patches in our oceans.

Simply stated, plastics are everywhere. The increasing global production and use 
of plastics has led to an amassing of gargantuan expanses of plastic debris in the

The Science of Ocean Pollution
world’s floating seas—the so-called “Great Garbage Patches.” Because plastics are 
low density, low cost and structurally sound substances, they are the main drivers 
making plastic products and their usage popular and continuously increasing in pro­
duction throughout the globe. However, it is these same characteristics that make 
plastic so widespread in everyday usage, in everyday life and make them so difficult 
to decrease because of their durability and “persistence” in the environment. The 
floating seas are diverse habitats. These habitats, including the floating sea surface, 
the beaches, the water column and sea floor (benthic zone) consist of environments 
that affect the deterioration of plastics in very different ways. For example, most 
plastic degradation occurs in sunlight, UV radiation, near beaches and on the sur­
face of the floating seas. The problem is that the photo oxidation process that works 
to degrade plastics on or near beaches and on the surface of the floating seas is not 
able to penetrate the deep, dark depths of the floating seas (see Figure 3.1). Thus, 
without UV radiation and other surface conditions available, the floating sea floors 
are carpeted with acres and acres of plastic carpets, mats and mass blankets that 
have shelf-lives, so to speak, of unknown length. Another factor that affects plastic 
degradation in the floating seas is temperature. The rate of plastic degradation is 
temperature-dependent; thus, as the floating sea temperatures decrease with increase 
in depth, the shelf-life of the plastic increases. What about microorganisms? Don’t 
the floating seas’ microorganisms biologically degrade and consume the plastic? The 
simple answer is no. The compound answer is also no or qualified by saying it is an 
extremely slow process, if it decomposes at all. It is a matter of oxygen availability. 
The deeper the level of the floating seas, the greater is the decrease in dissolved 
oxygen (DO) levels. The microorganisms, the would-be plastic decomposers, need 
oxygen; thus, if decomposition occurs at all by the kinetic biological processes, it 
is extremely slow. When plastics in the floating seas are broken apart by whatever

mechanism works on them, another problem emerges. Namely, large pieces of plas­
tic are broken apart and eventually become copious masses of microplastics. These 
microplastics end up being ingested in aquatic lifeforms residing in the floating seas.
A FLOATING SEA OF PLASTIC
After the opening epigraph (this is what “Professor Easy” calls it) to this chapter, it 
is now time to get down to the floating sea of plastic that has often been referred to as 
plastic soup. More appropriately, it might be referred as synthetic polymer soup. The 
term was coined by Charles J. Moore in 1997, after he found patches of plastic pollu­
tion in the North Pacific Gyre called the Great Pacific Garbage Patch (Plastic Soup 
Foundation, 2019). Plastic is distributed by currents and winds and is most abundant 
in the central and western North Pacific. Plastics have now made themselves a per­
manent part of the marine environment for the initial time in the extended history 
of global seas—there are no ancient deposits of these materials or their biological 
consequences with high concentrations of synthetic polymers in the globe’s one vast 
prehistoric ocean. Moreover, when we take ice cores to check out environmental 
conditions in prehistoric times, we do not find plastic (Note: Plastic was invented 
in 1907 as Bakelite). When we explore caves where clans of cavepersons resided, 
we never find plastic items. Also, when we dig into and sift out the ancient artifacts 
and residues in middens (the archaeological garbage dumps), we do not find plastics. 
However, if we look today at ice and sediment core samples deposited in the last 
180 years (polystyrene discovered in 1839), we will find a clear record of plastic 
deposition and the consequences. Yes, a clear record of recent deposits into the float­
ing sea … and the beat goes on, so to speak.
The Floating Sea of Plastic by any other name is an accumulation of plastic 
objects and particles (e.g., plastic bottles, bags and microbeads—nurdles) in the 
Earth’s environment that adversely affects wildlife, of colonizing hydroids, wild­
life habitat and humans (Parker, 2018). Plastic marine debris is, as stated earlier, 
of particular concern due to its longevity in the marine environment, the physical 
(e.g., entanglement, gastrointestinal blockage, reef destruction) and chemical threats 
and hazards (e.g., bioaccumulation of the chemical ingredients of plastic or toxic 
chemicals sorbed to plastics) it presents to marine and bird life, and the fact that it 
is frequently mistaken as food by birds and fish. The most attention paid to plastic 
contamination of marine environments is focused on the so-called “Great Pacific 
and Atlantic Garbage Patches” located in remote gyres (i.e., giant circular oceanic 
surface currents); however, it is important to note that the gyre accumulations are not 
the only water bodies polluted by plastics. For example, plastic trash and particles 
are now found in most marine and terrestrial habitats, including the deep sea, Great 
Lakes, coral reefs, beaches, rivers and estuaries. There is virtually no location on 
earth that remains untouched by plastics. This occurrence presents a serious threat 
to our environment.
A significant amount of marine plastic waste normally falls within the broad cat­
egory of macroscopic pollutants. Macroscopic pollutants (>5mm) include large visi­
ble items (e.g., floatable, flotsam and jetsam, nurdles, marine debris and shipwrecks); 
these contaminate or pollute surface water bodies (lakes, rivers, streams, oceans). 

18
The Science of Ocean Pollution
In an urban stormwater context, these large visible items are termed floatable—
this includes waterborne litter and debris, including toilet paper, condoms and tam­
pon applicators, plastic bags or six-packs rings and accompanied trash such as food 
cans, jugs, cigarette butts, yard waste, polystyrene foam, metal and glass beverage 
bottles (see Figure 3.2), as well as oil and grease. Floatable plastic debris come from 
street litter that ends up in storm drains (catch basins) and sewers. Floatable plastic 
debris can be discharged into the surrounding waters during certain storm events 
when water flow into treatment plants (i.e., those without overflow storage lagoons) 
exceeds treatment capacity. Floatable plastic debris contribute to visual pollution, 
detract from the pleasure of outdoor experiences and pose a threat to wildlife and 
human health.
The terms flotsam and jetsam, as used currently, refer to any kind of marine 
debris. The two terms have different meanings: jetsam refers to materials jettisoned 
voluntarily (usually to lighten the load in an emergency) into the sea by the crew of 
a ship. Flotsam describes goods that are floating on the water without having been 
thrown in deliberately, often after a shipwreck.
Nurdles (strongly resembling fish eggs), also known as mermaids’ tears, are pre-
production plastic pellets or plastic resin pellets, are plastic pellets typically under 
5 mm in diameter (see Figure 3.3) and are a major component of marine debris. 
Also, children’s pop tubes (see Figure 3.4) and sensory tubes have contributed to the 
growth of ocean patches. In the case of nurdles, it is estimated that billions of pounds 
of nurdles are manufactured annually in the United States alone. Not only are they a 
significant source of ocean and beach pollution, but nurdles also frequently find their 
way into the digestive tracts of various marine creatures.
In the past, the major source of marine debris was naturally occurring driftwood; 
humans have been discharging similar material into the oceans for thousands of 
years. In the modern era, however, the increasing use of plastic with its subsequent 
discharge by humans into waterways has resulted in plastic materials and/or prod­
ucts being the most prevalent form (as much 80%) of marine debris. Plastics are

persistent water pollutants because they do not biodegrade as many other substances 
do. Not only is waterborne plastic unsightly but it also poses a serious threat to fish, 
seabirds, marine reptiles and marine mammals, as well as to boats and coastal habi­
tations (NOAA, 2009). Plastic debris has been responsible for the entanglement and 
deaths of many marine organisms, such as fish, seals, turtles and birds. Sea turtles 
are affected by plastic pollution. Some species consume jelly fish (hydroids), but 
often mistake plastic bags for their natural prey. Consumed plastic materials can kill 
the sea turtle by obstructing the esophagus (Gregory, 2009). Baby sea turtles are particu­
larly vulnerable according to a 2018 study by Australian scientists (Gabbatiss, 2018).
Types of Plastic
Types of plastics include:
•	 Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET or PETE)—the largest use for PET is for 
synthetic fibers, in which case it is referred to as polyester. PET’s next larg­
est application is as bottles for beverages, including water. It is also used in 
electrical applications and packaging (ICS, 2011a).
•	 High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE)—HDPE is used for a wide variety of 
products, including bottles, packaging containers, drums, automobile fuel 
tanks, toys and household goods. It is also used for packaging many house­
hold and industrial chemicals such as determents and bleach and can be 
added into articles such as crates, pallets or packaging containers (ICS, 
2011b).
•	 Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC)—PVS is produced as both rigid and flexible res­
ins. Rigid PVC is used for pipe, conduit and roofing tiles, whereas flexible 
PVC has applications in wire and cable coating, flooring, coated fabrics and 
shower curtains (ICIS, 2011c).
•	 Low-Density Polyethylene (LDPE)—LDPE is used mainly for film applica­
tions in packaging, such as poultry wrapping and trash bags. It is also used 
in cable sheathing and injection molding applications (ICS, 2011b).
•	 Polypropylene (PP)—PT is used in packaging, automotive parts, or made 
into synthetic fibers. It can be extruded for use in pipe, conduit, wire and 
cable applications. PP’s advantages are a high impact strength, high soften­
ing point, low density and resistance to scratching and stress cracking. A 
drawback is its brittleness at low temperatures (ICIS, 2011d).
DID YOU KNOW?
It has been estimated that container ships lose over 10,000 containers at sea 
each year (usually during a storm; (Podsada, 2001). One famous spillage 
occurred in the Pacific Ocean in 1992, when thousands of rubber ducks and 
other toys went overboard during a storm. The toys have since been found all over 
the world; scientists have used the incident to gain a better understanding of 
ocean currents.

21
The Plastisphere It Floats
•	 Polystyrene (PS)—PS has applications in a range of products, primarily 
domestic appliances, construction, electronics, toys and food packaging 
such as containers, produce baskets and fast-food containers (ICIS, 2011e).
•	 Thermosets—Thermosets are plastics and resins that harden permanently 
after one treatment of heat and pressure; once they are set, they can’t be 
melted.
•	 Thermoplastics—A thermoplastic is a type of plastic that melts when 
heated and freezes to a solid when cooled sufficiently.
•	 Elastomers—Elastomers are polymers with viscoelasticity (i.e., both vis­
cosity and elasticity) and have very weak intermolecular forces, generally 
low Young’ modulus (elasticity in tension) and high failure strain compared 
with other materials (De, 1996).
•	 Polyamides (PA) or (nylons)—Fibers, toothbrush bristles, tubing, fishing 
line and low-strength machine parts, such as engine parts or gun frames.

Microplastics
Approximately 90% of the plastic pieces or fibers in the pelagic marine environment 
are less than 5 mm in diameter; these are known as microplastics and classified as 
primary microplastics (Browne, Galloway, & Thompson, 2010; Eriksen et al., 2013; 
Thompson et al., 2004). The term microplastics was introduced by Thompson and 
colleagues in 2004 to denote plastic particles less than 5 mm in diameter (Thompson 
et al., 2004). There are two types of microplastics: primary and secondary. As men­
tioned, primary microplastics are defined as less than 5 mm in size. Secondary 
microplastics are slightly bigger and once formed large pieces of plastic.
DID YOU KNOW?
The primary contributors of plastics in the oceans are China, Indonesia, 
Philippines, Sri Lanka and Thailand (Spellman, 2014).

22
The Science of Ocean Pollution
Microplastics come in many forms including beads, resin pellets, fibers and frag­
ments. Plastic microfibers are fibers, such as nylon and polyester, which are used to 
make clothing, furnishings, and even fishing nets and lines. Resin pellets are melted 
and used to create larger plastic items. In addition, secondary microplastics are gen­
erated when larger pieces of plastic are fragmented by weathering actions including 
the effects of ultraviolet rays, and wind and wave action. Current information on the 
use of tiny plastic abrasives (commonly called microbeads or nanobeads), especially 
in pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), such as toothpaste, face 
washes, cosmetics and home cleaning products, and synthetic fabrics shedding dur­
ing laundering has shown the prevalence of micro- and nanoparticle size plastics 
as being pervasive in water bodies (Eriksen et al., 2013). Many of the microplastics 
are generated as stated above and are manifested from daily activities and products 
that we use without giving them a second, third or fourth thought. These household 
activities and products include:
•	 Body wash
•	 Tires
•	 Wet wipes
•	 Skincare products
•	 Dishwasher/laundry detergent pods
•	 Toothpaste
•	 Synthetic clothing (gives the stretch factor to the clothing)
•	 Tea bags
From this list, it is obvious that many of the contributors of microplastics to 
oceans (and other biomes) are the result of the use of pharmaceuticals and per­
sonal care products (PPCPs). Again, we contribute to microplastic pollution simply 
because we do not think about it; ignorance of the ingredients of our everyday 
personal care products and their fate is common. That is, we just think about using 
such products to keep us clean and healthy without even giving a thought to their 
ultimate fate and impact on the environment. We often do not think about our envi­
ronment until it offends us—until it is visible or in one way or the other reaches 
out and grabs them.
To gain a better understanding of PPCPs and their use in our daily lives, consider 
the following case study.
CASE STUDY 3.1—PPCPs AND OCEAN PATCHES
Each morning a family of four wakes up and prepares for the workday for the two 
parents and school for the two teenagers. Fortunately, this family has three upstairs 
bathrooms to accommodate everyone’s need to prepare for the day; via the morning 
natural waste disposal, shower and soap usage, cosmetic application, hair treatments, 
vitamins, sunscreen, fragrances and prescribed medications end up down the various 
drains. In addition, the over-night deposit of cat and dog waste is routinely picked 
up and flushed down the toilet. Let’s examine a short inventory of what this family 

23
The Plastisphere It Floats
of four has disposed of or has applied to themselves as they prepare for their day 
outside the home.
•	 Toilet-flushed animal wastes
•	 Prescription and over-the-counter therapeutic drugs
•	 Veterinary drugs
•	 Fragrances
•	 Soap
•	 Shampoo, conditioner, other hair treatment products
•	 Body lotion, deodorant, body powder
•	 Cosmetics
•	 Sunscreen products
•	 Diagnostic agents
•	 Nutraceuticals (e.g., vitamins, medical foods, functional foods, etc.)
Even though these bioactive substances have been around for decades, today 
we group all of them (the exception being animal wastes), substances and/or prod­
ucts, under the title of pharmaceuticals and personal care products called “PPCPs” 
(Spellman, 2021).
We pointed to the human activities of the typical family of four in contributing 
PPCPs to the environment but other sources of PPCPs should also be recognized. 
For example, residues from pharmaceutical manufacturing, residues from hospitals, 
clinics, doctors or veterinary offices, or Urgent Care facilities, illicit drug disposal 
[i.e., police knock on the door and the frightened user flushes the illicit drugs down 
the toilet (along with $100 bills, weapons, dealers’ phone numbers, etc.) and into 
the wastewater stream], veterinary drug use, especially antibiotics and steroids and 
agribusiness are all contributors of PPCPs in the environment.
In our examination of the personal deposit of PPCPs to the environment and to 
the local wastewater supply, let’s return to that family of four. After having applied 
or ingested the various substances mentioned earlier, the four individuals involved 
unwittingly add traces (or more than traces) of these products, PPCPs, to the environ­
ment through excretion (the elimination of waste material from the body) and when 
bathing, and then possibly through disposal of any unwanted medications to sewers 
and trash. How many of us have found old medical prescriptions in the family medi­
cine cabinet and decided they were no longer needed? How many of us have grabbed 
up such unwanted medications and disposed of them with a single toilet flush? Many 
of these medications (for example antibiotics) are not normally found in the environ­
ment. However, microplastics that are part and sometimes whole of these products 
are finding their way into oceans and other environmental biomes on a continuous 
and growing basis.
Note that whenever I have listed the household activities and products that con­
tribute to microplastic contamination of our oceans and other biomes in my classes, 
it was not uncommon for a student to ask: “Tea bags … really?”
Really, for sure.
The fact is tea bags contain up to 25% plastic. In one of my environmental lab­
oratory classes, I instructed my upper graduate students to analyze tea bags sold 

24
The Science of Ocean Pollution
by three different companies—brands. I did not inform the students about what I 
wanted them to find in their analysis of the tea bags, as the “Easy Professor” I simply 
told them to find out what the tea bags were made of—what they consisted of, chemi­
cally and otherwise.
When they looked at the teabags other than what I had informed them of the con­
tents, they had a difficult time believing that tea bags contained plastic.
Wrong. It was not long before they did indeed find that all three brands consisted 
of various amounts of plastic.
Then the question was: Why? Why is plastic in tea bags?
It has to do with sealing and maintaining the shape of the tea bags. Keeping 
their shape in hot liquid is a must and this is accomplished by using a plastic poly­
mer, usually polypropylene is added. Note that even though the amounts of plastic 
found in most tea bars is minimal (some would say insignificant in content between 
manufacturers).
Think about this: Millions of tea bags are used daily to provide millions of cups 
of tea that are consumed.
Okay, so what does this have to do with microplastics becoming members of the 
Great Ocean Garbage Patches?
Good question.
Keep in mind that whenever we ingest anything it will eventually be excreted 
from our bodies (i.e., waste materials, hopefully). A huge amount of these waste 
materials is excreted as solid waste or urinated as waste fluid.
Okay, most people understand this but what is not understood by the majority is 
where do a large percentage of the solid and liquid human excretions end up? Where 
do they go? Simply, it is one of those out of sight out of mind expressions applicable 
here—forget what we can’t see.
Anyway, in the United States, about 85% of human waste is pumped (or gravity 
flowed) to some type of wastewater treatment plant or operation or process (could 
be septic tanks). Wastewater treatment is beneficial to both humans and the environ­
ment. A simplistic wastewater treatment consists of a series of unit processes that are 
designed to settle out grit and physical components of the wastestream and to disinfect 
the treated outfalled water. After collecting wastewater from domestic and industrial 
sources, the inflow to the wastewater treatment plant is screened. Screening removes 
large solids, such as rags, cans, rocks, egg shells, condoms, branches, leaves, roots, 
etc., from the flow before the flow moves on to downstream processes.
After screening wastewater, the next unit process is usually designed to remove grit. 
The purpose of grit removal is to remove inorganic solids (sand, gravel, clay, egg shells, 
coffee grounds, metal filings, seeds and other similar materials) that could cause exces­
sive mechanical wear. Several processes or devices are used for grit removal, all based 
on the fact that grit is heavier than the organic solids, which should be kept in sus­
pension for treatment in following unit processes. Grit removal may be accomplished 
in grit chambers or by the centrifugal separation of biosolids. Processes use gravity/
velocity, aeration or centrifugal force to separate the solids from the wastewater.
The next wastewater treatment process associated with primary treatment, sec­
ondary treatment and tertiary treatment (primary sedimentation or clarification) 
should remove both settleable organic and floatable solids. Poor solids removal 

25
The Plastisphere It Floats
during this step of treatment may cause organic overloading of the biological treat­
ment processes following primary treatment. Normally, each primary clarification 
unit can be expected to remove 90 to 95% of settleable solids, 40 to 60% of the total 
suspended solids, and 25 to 35% of biological oxygen demand (BOD).
The next unit process that is typically used in wastewater treatment is some type 
of biological treatment that uses suspended growth of organisms to remove BOD and 
suspended solids. These types of biological treatment include trickling filters, rotat­
ing biological contactors (RBCs), and the activated biosolids process. The activated 
biosolids process is a human-made process that mimics the natural self-purifica­
tion process that takes place in streams. In essence, we can state that the activated 
biosolids treatment process is a “stream in a container.” In wastewater treatment, 
activated-biosolids processes are used for both secondary treatment and complete 
aerobic treatment without primary sedimentation.
Note that within the wastewater unit process, chain solids are also removed; all of the 
biological processes must include some form of solids removal (settling tank, filter, etc.).
Finally, before the treated wastewater is outfalled to its receiving body (stream, river, 
lake, etc.), it is disinfected—the goal is to ensure that the treated wastewater is free of 
pathogenic microorganisms (deactivated to the extent possible). One of the commonly 
used disinfection processes is chlorine treatment. Chlorine is a powerful oxidizer that is 
commonly used in wastewater and water treatment for disinfection, in wastewater treat­
ment for odor control, bulking control and other applications. When chlorine is added to 
a unit process, we want to ensure that a measured amount is added, obviously.
This simplified description of conventional wastewater treatment unit processes 
has been purposely provided here to make a point about cleaning our water that 
eventually or directly ends up in our oceans. Here is the problem, in years of my 
research on testing treated wastewater from secondary treatment plants, I two dis­
turbing findings: in 14 different effluent streams I found the presence of forever 
chemicals and microplastics.
“Forever chemicals?”
Yes, this not a book about forever chemicals but for explanation purposes per- 
and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a family of human-made chemicals used 
for their water- and strain-resistant qualities used in nonstick frying pans, water-
repellant sports gear, stain-resistant rugs, cosmetics and countless other consumer 
products. The problem with PFAS is that its chemical bonds are so strong that they 
don’t degrade or do so only slowly in the environment.
Note: For a more informed and detailed report on PFAS, I recommend The 
Science of Environmental Pollution, 3rd edition by this author.
Let’s get back to the microplastic problem. Keep in mind that it is not just the 
plastic bottles and other plastics that are part and parcel of the Great Ocean Garbage 
Patches but even more so the microplastics that reside within the Patches.
CASE STUDY 3.2—PHANTOMS OF THE FLOATING SEAS
The phantoms of the floating seas are the ghost nets and lost fishing lines. Ghost nets 
and lines are fishing nets and fishing lines that have been left or lost in the floating 
seas by fishermen. The problem is that these nets and lines are nearly invisible in 

26
The Science of Ocean Pollution
and underwater and can be tangled on a rocky reef or drifting in the open floating 
sea. The nets are designed to restrict movement, causing starvation, laceration and 
infection, and suffocation in those that need to return to the surface to breathe (BBC 
News, 2007).
Ghost nets and lines are having impacts on coral reefs. NOAA researchers in 
the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands are actively using photogrammetry to mea­
sure the damage that lost or discarded fishing nets and lines cause to coral reefs. 
The Northwestern Hawaiian Islands stretch to more than 1200 miles northwest of 
the main Hawaiian Islands. They contain 124 mostly uninhabited small islands, 
atolls, reefs and submerged banks. The researchers have found that the ghost nets 
and lines are silently floating through the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, snag­
ging on coral reefs and entangling wildlife (see Figure 3.5). The researchers have 
observed ghost nets and lines tumbling across expansive coral reef environments. 
They break, shade and abrade coral, preventing them from healthy growth. These 
lost or abandoned nets and lines are a persistent that accumulate over time, but 
we are still learning the extent of the damage nets and lines inflict upon the cor­
als. However, the researchers found that regardless of net size or algae growth, 
corals were lost. The good news is that the researchers have removed more than 
2,000,000 pounds of fishing nets, lines and other marine debris from this sensitive 
coral reef ecosystem.

CASE STUDY 3.3—INVASION OF LARVAL FISH NURSERIES
NOAA (2019) reports that new research exposes that many larval fish species from 
different ocean habitats are surrounded by and ingesting plastics in their preferred 
nursery habitat. Many of the world’s marine fish spend their first days or weeks feed­
ing and developing at the floating sea surface. Larval fish are the next generation of 
adult fish that will supply protein and essential nutrients to people around the world. 
However, at the present time, little is known about the ocean processes that affect the 
survival of larval fish. However, in a NOAA-conducted research process the team 
found that surface slicks contained far more larval fish than neighboring surface 
waters. Floating surface slicks are naturally occurring, ribbon-like, smooth water 
features at the ocean surface. They form when internal sea waves converge near 
coastlines in marine ecosystems worldwide. The floating sea surface slicks aggre­
gate plankton, which is an important food resource for larval fish. The research team 
found larval fish in the floating sea surface slicks were larger, well-developed and 
had increased swimming abilities. Laval fish that actively swim are better able to 
respond and orient to their environment. This suggests that tropical fish are actively 
seeking surface slicks to capitalize on concentrated prey. The unfortunate truth is 
that the team also discovered that the same floating sea processes that aggregate prey 
for larval fish also concentrate buoyant, passively floating plastics. Note that plastic 
densities in these floating sea surface slicks were, on average, eight times higher than 
the plastic densities found in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. After towing the net 
more than 100 times, the researchers found that plastics were 126 times more con­
centrated in floated sea surface slicks than in surface water just a few hundred yards 
away. They also found that there were seven times more plastics than there were 
larval fish (NOAA, 2019).
Larval fish prefer their prey in the less than 1 mm range; the majority of the 
plastics found in floating sea surface slicks were very small (<1 mm). Moreover, the 
researchers found that many fish species ingested plastic particles, including lar­
val coral reef fish and pelagic species; many ingest plastic just days after they are 
spawned (see Figure 3.6).
With regard to larval fish, researchers are not sure how harmful plastic ingestion 
is to larval fish. However, in adult fish, plastics can cause gut blockage, malnutrition 
and toxicant accumulation. Based on research, what we do know is that larval fish 
are highly susceptible to changes in their environment and food. We also know that 
prey-size plastics could impact development and even reduce survivorship of larval 
fish that ingest them.
Using satellites, researchers were able to measure the size and distribution of 
the floating sea surface slicks. It turns out that even when viewed from outer space, 
surface slicks are distinct from the rest of the floating seas. Researchers found that 
surface slicks comprise less than 10% of the floating sea habitat. However, they are 
estimated to contain about 42% of all surface-dwelling larval fish and nearly 92% of 
all floating plastics (NOAA, 2019).
It is interesting to note that although nearly every type of commercial plastic is 
present in the floating sea debris, floating marine debris is dominated by polyethyl­
ene and polypropylene because of their high production volumes, their broad utility 

28
The Science of Ocean Pollution
and their buoyancy (Colton et al., 1974; Ng & Obbard, 2006; Rios & Moore, 2007). 
Low-density polyethylene or linear low-density polyethylene is commonly used to 
make plastic bags or six-pack rings; polypropylene is commonly used to make reus­
able food containers or beverage bottle caps (USEPA, 2017).
Even though much of the floating sea debris research focuses on floating plastic 
debris, it is important to recognize that only approximately half of all plastic is defi­
nitely buoyant, that is, it floats (USEPA, 2017). It is a scientific fact that buoyancy is 
dependent on the density of the material and the presence of entrapped air. 
Researchers have documented the presence of plastics throughout the water column, 
including on the seafloor of nearly every ocean and sea (Ballent et al., 2013; 
Maximenko et al., 2012).
DID YOU KNOW?
A water column is a conceptual column of water from the surface of the float­
ing sea to the bottom sediment. The open sea water column is divided into five 
parts, pelagic zones (Greek for open sea).

Plastic Containers and Packaging
The floating seas have become depositories for plastic containers and packaging. 
Plastic resins are used in the manufacture of packing products. Some of these include 
polyethylene terephthalate (PET) soft drink and water bottles, high-density polyeth-
ylene (HDPE) milk and water jugs, film products (including bags and sacks) made 
of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and other containers and packaging (including 
clamshells, trays, caps, lids, egg cartons, loose fill, produce baskets, coatings and 
closures) made up of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polystyrene (PS), polypropylene (PP) 
and other resins. USEPA used data on resin sales from the American Chemistry 
Council to estimate the generation of plastic containers and packaging in 2017. Jugs 
and containers include a variety of plastic packaging types. Examples include (but 
are not limited to) milk jugs, food containers, (e.g., yogurt containers, take out con-
tainers, etc.), oil lube bottles, plastic buckets, baskets or barrels. Most are made from 
polyethylene (PE) (Spellman, 2021).
USEPA estimated approximately 14.5 million tons of plastic containers and pack-
aging were generated in 2017, approximately 5.0% of MSW generation (Note that 
plastic packaging as a category in this analysis does not include single-service plates 
and cups, and trash bags, both of which are classified as nondurable goods).
USEPA also estimated the recycling of plastic products based on data published 
annually by the American Chemistry Council, as well as additional industry data. 
The recycling rate of PET bottles and jars was 29.1 in 2017 (910,000 tons). It is 
estimated that recycling of HDPE natural bottles (e.g., milk and water bottles) was 
220,000 tons, or 29.3% of generation. Overall, the amount of recycled plastic contain-
ers and packaging in 2017 was almost 2 million tons or 13.6% of plastic containers 
and packaging generated. Additionally, 16.9% of plastic containers and packaging 
waste generated was combusted with energy recovery, while the remainder (over 
69%) was landfilled (Spellman, 2021; USEPA, 2021).
Plastics: Persistent Bioaccumulative and Toxic Substances (PBTs)
Substances such as persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBTs) chemicals pose a 
risk to the floating sea environment because they resist degradation, persisting for 
years or even decades (USEPA, 2017). PBTs are toxic to humans and marine organ-
isms and have been shown to accumulate at various trophic levels (feeding levels) 
through the food chain. PBTs can be insidious in the environment even at low levels 
attributable to their ability to biomagnify up the food web, leading to toxic effects 
at higher trophic levels even though ambient concentrations are well below toxic 
thresholds. The subgroup of PBTs known as persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are 
especially persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (such as DDT, dioxins and PCBs) 
(Engler, 2012; Spellman, 2021).
Global representatives from 92 countries concluded that there is a definite need to 
reduce and eliminate worldwide use and emissions of persistent organic pollutants 
(POPs), highly toxic chemicals such as DDT, and dioxins that remain in the envi-
ronment for years. The conclusion they came to was the result of agreements made 
during a meeting, held in Montreal, June 29 to July 3, 1998, that focused on a list of 

30
The Science of Ocean Pollution
12 persistent chemicals, including nine pesticides. Eight of these nine pesticides are 
on Pesticide Action Network’s Dirty Dozen list: Aldrin, chlordane, DDT, dieldrin, 
endrin, heptachlor, hexachlorobenzene and toxaphene. The remaining chemicals on 
the list are dioxins, furans, mirex and PCBs.
“These substances travel readily across international borders to even the most 
remote region, making this a global problem that requires a global solution,” said 
Klaus Toepfer (2022), executive director of the United Nations Environment Program 
(UNEP), which sponsored the meetings. A growing body of scientific evidence indi­
cates that exposure to very low doses of certain POPs can lead to cancer, damage to 
the central and peripheral nervous systems, diseases of the immune system, repro­
ductive disorders and interference with normal infant and child development. POPs 
can travel through the atmosphere thousands of miles from their source. In addition, 
these substances concentrate in living organisms and are found in people and ani­
mals worldwide (Spellman, 2021).
In describing PBTs, it can be said that they are hydrophobic, aquaphobic or have 
low water solubility and for this reason, when in the marine environment, they tend 
to partition to sediment or concentrate at the floating sea surface (Hardy et al., 1990; 
USEPA, 2017) and not dissolve into solution. When PBTs encounter plastic debris, 
they tend to preferentially take up or hold (sorb) to the debris. In effect, plastics are 
like magnets for PBTs.
Research has shown that different pollutants sorb to different types of plastics in 
varying concentrations depending on the concentration of the PBT in seawater and 
the amount of plastic particle surface area available. Plastics on the seafloor may 
sorb PBTs from the sediments, (Graham & Thompson, 2009; Rios & Moore, 2007), 
in addition to sorbing them from the seawater. Graham and Thompson (2009) found, 
like other researchers, that weathering of plastic bottles, bags, fishing lien and other 
products in the ocean causes tiny fragments to break off. These plastic fragments 
may accumulate biofilms, sink and become mixed with sediment, where benthic 
invertebrates may encounter and ingest them. Concentration of PBTs such as PCBs 
and DDE (the breakdown product of DDT) on plastic particles have been shown to 
be orders of magnitude greater than concentrations of the same PBTs found in the 
surrounding water (Spellman, 2021).
Because of their varying behaviors in the environment, the potential for PBTs to 
sorb to plastic debris is complex; however, they are more likely than not to preferen­
tially sorb to plastic debris. The particular affinity to sorb will depend on the PBT and 
type of plastic: polyethylene sorbs PCBs more readily than polypropylene does (Endo 
et al., 2005). The longer plastic is in the water, the more weathered and fragmented 
it becomes (Teuten et al., 2007). With increased fragmentation comes higher relative 
surface area, thereby increasing the relative concentration of sorbed PBTs (a process 
referred to as hyperconcentration of contaminants) (Engler, 2012; Spellman, 2021).
CASE STUDY 3.4—SAILING THE SOUTH PACIFIC OCEAN
In 1965, as an enlisted person in the United States Navy, I had the good fortune to 
sail in the USS Lipan (ATF-85) homeported in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Lipan was an 
ocean-going tugboat (decommissioned now) and was used for several functions such 

31
The Plastisphere It Floats
as towing targets, transporting equipment to various US territories in the Pacific 
Ocean and other utility assignments. In early 1965, one of Lipan’s utility assign­
ments was the transportation of ornithologists from the Smithsonian Institute to 17 
different South Pacific islands to study birds including taking blood samples from 
the birds during a three-month cruise in the South Pacific Ocean (Oceania). The 17 
visited islands are all below the equator—(Yes, I am a fully initiated Shellback and 
15 years later as a commissioned officer while on board USS Whidbey Island LSD-
41, we crossed the Artic Circle while I was officer of the deck and I was initiated 
into the Realm of Boreas Rex, King of the North, and became a Blue Nose). I men­
tion this Blue Nose trip because while sailing the Northern Atlantic we crossed the 
Great Circle Route from North America to Europe where I experienced my second 
exposure to the floating ocean of trash—the Northern Atlantic Ocean Great Garbage 
Patch).
Anyway, back to my South Pacific cruise where Lipan, its crew and guest scien­
tists visited the following islands: Baker, Sydney, Gardner, Christmas, Bora Bora, 
American Samoa (Pago Pago is interesting city there), Solomon Islands, Bora Bora, 
Palmyra and a few other islands. At that time an island of interest to me, I was able 
to ride the rubber raft through the hazardous reef and walk the beach at Palmyra 
Island—nothing but sandy beach and the rest palm trees. Note that some investiga­
tors feel that pilot Amelia Earhart may have disappeared on or near Palmyra Island. I 
accompanied the scientists as their helper while we remained ashore for about 3 days 
per island. (Note: the truth be told it was this adventure as a 21-year-old that drove 
me to love science). Also note that this island, Palmyra, obtained literary recognition 
as the location where the great book, And The Sea Well Tell by Vincent Bugliosi—
the famous prosecutor of the Manson Family—is a written account about a couple 
residing there and eventually accused of killing a visiting couple and stealing their 
sailboat.
I mention this 1965 Oceania USS Lipan cruise because during the cruise I wit­
nessed nothing but clear, very blue, beautiful uncontaminated ocean—no plastics 
or other trash was apparent then. Simply, it was the Brilliant Abyss as described by 
Helen Scales (2021) in her book of the same title.
The question is how is it today?
Well, today the brilliant abyss is home to the South Pacific Great Garbage Patch, 
one of five offshore plastic patches haunted by accumulation—this one is 1.5 times 
the size of Texas. It resides in those former pristine waters, less traveled waters (the 
key word is “former”)—and grows in size with each passing day. Occasionally, large 
items such as buoys and fishing gear collect in the Patch but most of the materials 
within the constantly moving mass are broken into small bits—with microplastics 
being the most common accumulation. This situation is tragic as is but the problem 
is that once microplastics enter the gyre that forms the Patch it is nearly impossible 
to get them out.
So the obvious question is how do we clean up this and the other gigantic garbage 
patches? Some researchers are pushing for biodegradable plastics. Based on my 
years of researching the five Great Garbage Patches and their accumulation of micro­
plastics, I have concluded that biodegradable plastics will not decompose in ocean 
water. Moreover, the Patches consist of a slow-moving, mostly invisible catastrophe, 

32
The Science of Ocean Pollution
the consequences of which are only now beginning to be understood. But we still do 
not know what we do not know about the impact of these gargantuan-sized floating 
masses of people-developed trash. People-developed trash such as microplastics is a 
persistent presence—more akin to an invasive species—a brown rat, Africanized 
bees, Zebra mussels—than an ordinary contaminant, an unmatched threat to life on 
this globe.
PLASTISPHERE REVISITED
At the beginning of this chapter, I presented an equation I made up and used in my 
university lectures presented to undergrads and grad students and water/wastewater 
professionals. So I post it a here again:

To this point, this equation has been explained in simplistic terms in order to 
communicate to the reader the gist of the problems involved with microplastic pol­
lution of our oceans. By the way, microplastic pollution is not unique or exclusive to 
the oceans only. Microplastics are present in the soil, in freshwater bodies, in fish, 
uptaken into some plants and humans who ingest the contaminated fish and plants 
or decide to swim one of the Great Ocean Garbage Patches (not recommended) are 
repositories for highly persistent microplastics—also, remember the tea bags?
Anyway, to this point as presented in the plastisphere equation, people, pollution 
and persistence have been addressed.
What about politics?
Well, politics comes into play whenever there is some issue that smacks people 
in the face, so to speak. The problem with microplastic contamination is that the 
issue has been studied and brought into focus in aquatic systems. The problem now 
is double-headed:
•	 First, terrestrial problems associated with microplastics are just now com­
ing into focus, but there is not much attention being paid in terrestrial sys­
tems because the so-called hit in the face with the reality of the potential 
problem is foreign to most people.
DID YOU KNOW?
As microplastics journey through the various biomes, they can contain thou­
sands of different chemicals many of which are harmful to life. Moreover, as 
one of these microplastic particles works its way through the environment, 
it accumulates hitchhikers, pollutants already present in the environment, 
including viruses, bacteria and human pathogens. Simon (2022) points out that 
microplastic is not a monolith but a many-headed petrochemical hydra. And 
one of the major problems with this is that the microplastic hitchhikers are 
poisons consumed by Earth’s organisms.

The Plastisphere It Floats
•	 Second, remote locations like the South Pacific Garbage Patch are not an area 
frequently traveled by boat or raft. Again, this remote area and the other float­
ing garbage patches are out of sight and out of mind for most people.
Again, politics usually does not enter the picture until it is visible. Floating water 
pollution and deep-sea contamination can only be the subject of political legislation 
on a global scale.
THE BOTTOM LINE
The question is are we going to get a handle on controlling the dumping of plastics 
into the floating seas? Well, we had better because we simply can’t maintain our 
so-called “good life” without plastics and life period without the floating seas. And 
the importance of healthy oceans can’t be overstated. The best method of prevention 
is to stop and retain the plastic at the source. However, the truth be told the odds of 
preventing garbage patches are slim to none.
By the way, the real bottom line is slim and may have left town.
Note: Because the Great Ocean Garbage Patches are a growing issue, more in-
depth information about these are presented in the following chapter.

Garbage Patch Sea
Earlier it was pointed out that the major floating seas contain huge islands of floating 
mass of garbage (which makes one wonder what the floating sea floor of the great 
garbage patch regions look like?). These garbage patches are large areas of the ocean 
where litter, fishing gear, and other floating debris—known as marine debris—col­
lect. They are formed by rotating ocean currents, similar to whirlpools that pull 
floating objects in, called “gyres.” The pulling action of the thousand-mile-wide 
gyres pulls debris into one location, forming “patches.” The Great Pacific Garbage 
Patch” (aka the great vortex or great trash vortex) located in North Pacific Gyre 
(between Hawaii and California) is the most famous of the five gyres in the float­
ing seas. In addition to the Great Pacific Garbage Patch gyre, there is one in the 
Indian Ocean, two in the Atlantic Ocean, another one in the Southern Pacific Ocean. 
Garbage patches located in each one of these gyres are of varying sizes. Note that 
when the term “patch” is used to describe these floating masses of garbage, it is a 
misleading label, leading many to believe that these are islands of trash. Instead, the 
debris is spread not only across the surface of the floating seas but also extending 
into the depths to the ocean floor. The debris ranges in size, from large, abandoned 
fishing nets and line to microplastics fragments less than 5 mm in size.
THE GREAT PACIFIC GARBAGE PATCH
In 1997, while sailing his sailboat through the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, Captain 
Charles Moore saw something unexpected and stated, “Here and there, odd bits and 
flakes speckle the ocean’s surface.” He identified the flakes as plastic objects. He said 
it looked like a “a giant saltshaker had sprinkled bits of plastic onto the surface of the 
ocean.” During his 7-day transit of the Garbage Patch, he scanned the water daily 
and found that “No matter the time of day of how many times a day I look, it’s never 
more than a few minutes before I sight a plastic morsel bobbing by” (Moore, 2011).
The bits and flakes speckling on the ocean surface described by Captain Moore are 
still there and growing in size daily. Located between Hawaii and California, it is the 
most well-known patch (see Figure 4.1). Investigators have discovered that some areas 
of the patch have more trash than others, much of the debris is microplastics (NOAA, 
2019). And that aggravates the floating seas’ mess—microplastics are smaller than a 
pencil eraser, and not readily noticeable to the human eye (NOAA, 2021).
Well, why don’t we just send skimmer boats out to the floating seas’ garbage 
patches and skim the plastics off the surface? Well, that sounds like a reasonable 
proposition but is not possible.
Not possible?
Yes,
Why?
4

36
The Science of Ocean Pollution
The “why” is answered simply by pointing out that while there are larger items, 
like nets, plastic bottles and containers the microplastics are like pepper flakes float­
ing in soup (NOAA, 2021)—not easy to scoop up or skim off the surface (or below 
surface). Those who have sailed through the garbage patches, as the author of this 
account did years ago, point out that it is possible to sail through some areas of a 
garbage patch without seeing any debris at all. This is the case, of course, because 
the garbage patches are enormous! Moreover, because of their size, it is difficult to 
determine the exact size as the trash is constantly moving with winds and ocean 
currents.
Environmental Impact of Garbage Patches
Because the Great Pacific Garbage Patch and the other patches are far out in the mid­
dle of the floating seas where people hardly ever go, it can be problematic to think 
about or study them. Views of impacts on sea life in the patches are rare. However, 
we do know what floating sea garbage can do to wildlife, so we simply extrapolate 
DID YOU KNOW?
The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is actually a combination of two separate 
trash vortexes. The first one near Japan is known as the Western Garbage 
Patch. The second one lies between California and Hawaii and is known as the 
Eastern Garbage Patch.

to determine what impact great garbage patches have on the aquatic lifeforms (and 
humans, too).
So, when we extrapolate what we know about ghost fish nets (aka ghost fishing) 
and abandoned fishing line, we know that marine life can be caught and injured, or 
potentially killed in this type of debris. It is the lost fishing nets that are most haz­
ardous to aquatic life. Moreover, they are called “ghost” nets because they continue 
to fish even though they are no longer under the control of the fisher. Ghost nets are 
known to wrap around or trap aquatic animals, entangling, strangling or wounding 
them. Note that in addition to nets and fishing line, plastic debris with loops can also 
hook wildlife—packing straps, six-pack rings, handles of plastic bags and so forth 
are floating death traps for many types of aquatic life.
We can also extrapolate what we know about the harm of aquatic life ingesting 
micro-debris and microplastics to what goes in the patches. Animals may mistak­
enly eat debris and plastic. Again, we know this can be harmful to the health of fish, 
seabirds and other floating sea animals. When debris is ingested, it takes up room in 
the animal stomachs, making them feel full and stopping them from eating real food.
Another problem with floating sea debris is that it can become boats for unwanted 
passengers (hitchhikers), conveying species from one place to another. So, algae, 
barnacles, crabs or other species attach themselves to debris and are transported 
across the ocean. The problem is the hitchhiking organism may be an invasive spe­
cies, meaning it might settle and establish in a new environment, and it may outcom­
pete or overcrowd native species, disrupting the ecosystem.
Human Health Impact
With regard to the floating sea garbage patches and their effect on human health, the 
truth be known we simply do not know what we do not know about their impact. In 
a general sense, we do know that when sea organisms ingest microplastic and then 
humans consume the organisms as foodstuff, that we ingest the microplastic too. 
Moreover, we also know that humans ingest microplastics from sea salt, tap water, 
honey and other sources—and don’t forget the tea bags. Again, we do not know how 
the human ingestion of microplastics affects health. Moreover, plastic microfibers 
are also transported in the air and found in household dust from furniture, carpet, 
clothing and so forth, so exposure from seafood and other floating sea sources may 
be small in comparison. Note that researchers are actively investigating the effects 
of human ingestion of microplastics.
Floating sea debris in garbage patches can have other impacts. For example, the 
debris can cause damage to vessels. Floating sea debris is often difficult to see in 
the sea especially if it is floating right below the water surface level. A boat moving 
through the water can hit the debris, possibly causing vessel damage. Boat propellers 
can become entangled with nets and fishing line and intakes can become clogged.
The Garbage Patch Pollution Solution
Even the experts can’t say for certain what will occur if nothing changes, and mean­
while the floating seas continue to be polluted with debris. It seems likely that the 
amount of debris will continue to grow as more and more debris is thrown or washed 

38
The Science of Ocean Pollution
into the floating seas. This continued growth will likely worsen current impacts on 
the environment, vessel safety, navigation and the economy (NOAA, 2021).
One thing seems almost certain; it may be impossible to entirely get rid of floating 
sea garbage patches. Some of the material will not break down in the environment 
any time soon, and the other materials like plastic may never fully break down or 
go away. The larger debris, like fishing nets, can be removed by people, but debris 
in the floating sea garbage patches is mostly 5 mm in size and difficult to remove 
by hand. A complicating factor is the wind. In the floating seas, the wind and waves 
continuously mix the debris causing debris to be spread from the surface all the 
way to the sea floor. Because of the size of the microplastics and the wind and wave 
action constantly mixing them and spreading them out, it is very difficult to remove 
them. Research is underway to find a way to find a cost-effective technological solu­
tion for removing debris from the floating seas, but this is proving to be a daunting 
task. The bad news is we will have to deal with this problem for as far as the eye can 
see or not see, so to speak.
For the time being, prevention is the solution to pollution in the floating seas. By 
acting to prevent marine debris, we can stop this problem from growing. First, we 
need to understand the source of the debris. It all boils down to throttling, checking 
ineffective or improper waste management. Dumping and littering must be curbed 
and stopped. Finally, stormwater runoff must be controlled, managed and carefully 
monitored. Solving this problem is an all-hands-on-deck requirement.
Microplastics are spawned from so many sources including garbage bags and 
storage containers; bottle caps, rope, gear and strapping; utensils, coups, floats, cool­
ers; fishing nets and textiles; lates pain, coatings, medical devices, automotive parts 
and electronics’ laundry detergent pods, fishing bait; pipe, film containers; lami­
nated safety glass; drink bottles and textile fibers; resins and paints; ship varnish and 
construction debris.
THE BOTTOM LINE
We know what the problem is, and the problem is us.

The Floating 
Sun-Screened Sea
THE DOUBLE-EDGE SWORD
Are you familiar with any of the following chemicals?
•	 Octocrylene
•	 Octinoxate
•	 OD-PABA
•	 Nano-zinc oxide
•	 Nano-Titanium dioxide
•	 Oxybenzone
•	 Benzophenone-1
•	 Benzophenone-8
•	 3-Benzylidene camphor
•	 4-Methyphenzylidene camphor
Well, unless you are a chemist, these chemicals might be as foreign to you as 
Mare Spumans (from the Latin for Foaming Sea), a topographical feature of Earth’s 
Moon. The irony in the above list of common chemicals is that they are the ingredi­
ents that many of us often use whenever we want to protect ourselves from the harm­
ful ultraviolet (UV) rays of the sun; they are ingredients in sunscreen. With regard 
to sunscreen and the floating seas, sunscreen chemicals are a double-edged sword. 
One edge of the sword is that sunscreen is designed as a skincare product designed 
to protect human skin against the harmful effects of UV light. The other edge of the 
sword, however, is that the same products and chemicals designed to protect humans 
threaten marine life in the floating seas.
If the sunscreen we use was something that simply provides us with needed pro­
tection and then evaporates and disappears from our bodies, that might be a good 
thing. Depending, of course, on where the product disappears to. And this points 
to the gist or essence of the problem with sunscreen products. What we place on 
our bodies (not counting tattoos) eventually comes off. And so, it is with sunscreen 
products and skin lotions of one type or another. When we swim or shower, sun­
screen and other body lotions wash off and enter our waterways, including the 
floating seas.
Enter our waterways? Yes. Remember that what goes down the drain or what 
washes off at the beach while swimming is taken up by water. Wash water from 
a shower, sink or washing machine removes topicals such as sunscreen and body 
lotions from our bodies and from our washed clothing. Whatever goes down the

drain ends up in a septic tank and drain field, wastewater treatment plant, in the 
water via boat pump-outs or end-of-the pipe discharges.
This last statement may surprise you because it is often assumed that septic tanks, 
wastewater treatment plants, boat pump-outs and end-of-pipe discharges are treated, 
sucked up somewhere or somehow and treated at some place. Well, the truth be told 
septic tanks drain and when they do the water sometimes ends up seeping into riv­
ers and/or oceans but one way or the other the ocean is the end point of the water 
discharged.
Wastewater treatment secondary and advanced treatment plants that are prop­
erly operated and maintained do a reliable job in removing most pathogens, con­
taminants and many other objectionable pollutants from the wastestream. However, 
just as with forever chemicals and microplastics to topicals like sunscreen and 
other lotions, the removal process is not necessarily that effective. These products 
can make their way through the treatment processes and end up outfalling to what­
ever water body that is utilized with the eventual end point being the floating seas. 
Most of the topicals discussed here end up in the oceans in very small parts, por­
tions, fragments in the range of parts per million (ppm) or parts per trillion (ppt). 
On the surface (and the surface is applicable here), this does not seem to be much 
of a worry because of the small parts that make it to the floating seas. However, 
we are not speaking of a discharge here, or there, or somewhere; instead, we are 
speaking of multiple discharges that when taken on the whole mount up to many 
parts in total.
Then there are the boat pump-outs. Many of the pleasure boats (recreational ves­
sels) of today have on-board toilets, sinks and even showers. Boating requires sun­
screen protection for the boaters—that is, if the boaters are smart. Thus, it stands to 
reason that when out on the water in boats the usage of onboard hygiene facilities 
will be used. When used at sea, many of the hygiene appliances/apparatus dump 
their waste into the water bodies and eventually make their way to the floating seas. 
Even many lakes that are not land-locked have outlet rivers that flow to the sea.
All wastewater eventually ends up in the ocean, although the travel there might 
be very slow.
End-of-pipe discharges are generally wet weather events, resulting from rainfall 
and snowmelt. They include stormwater runoff, combined sewer overflows (CSOs) 
and wet weather sanitary sewer overflows (SSOs). Stormwater runoff accumulates 
all kinds of pollutants such as oil and grease, chemicals nutrients, metals, salts, fer­
tilizer and bacteria as it travels across land. CSOs and wet weather SSOs contain a 
mixture of raw sewage (this is where the topicals such as sunscreen come into play), 
also industrial wastewater and stormwater.
Okay, let’s get back to sunscreen. Obviously, aquatic animals have no need 
or desire for sunscreen products. Therefore, when they are exposed to sunscreen 
and other topical products, the result is not protection from sun burn or a beauty 
treatment instead it is harmful. For example, sunscreen is harmful to green algae 
(sometimes referred to as seaweed) by impairing growth and photosynthesis. Green 
algae are food for both sea life and humans. Green algae are also used to treat 
some cancers and are a sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide. The point here is that 
green algae are important—for several reasons. Sunscreen also damages coral. 

41
The Floating Sun-Screened Sea
Sunscreen chemicals accumulate in tissues, can bring about bleaching, deform 
young, damage DNA and even kill. In mussels, sunscreen can stimulate defects 
in the young. Sea urchin young can deform the young, damage reproductive and 
immune systems. In fish, sunscreen can decrease fertility and reproduction and 
cause female characteristics in male fish. Sunscreen products can accumulate in 
dolphins and be transferred to young.
PHARMACEUTICALS AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS (PPCPs)
Sunscreen is just one product used by humans that can end up in the floating seas. 
As mentioned earlier, Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products (PPCPs) which 
include sunscreen are also chemical products that can find their way into the floating 
seas. PPCPs are sometimes termed “emerging pollutants.” However, it is important 
to point out that PPCPs are not truly emerging; they are not new and as was pointed 
out earlier are commonly used by most people; instead, it is the understanding of 
the significance of their occurrence in the environment that is beginning to develop, 
beginning to emerge. PPCPs comprise a very broad, diverse collection of thousands 
of chemical substances. Pharmaceuticals, or prescription and over the counter medi­
cations made for human use or veterinary or agribusiness purposes, are common 
PPCPs found in the environment. In addition to prescription, veterinary and over the 
counter (OTC) therapeutic drugs, fragrances, cosmetics, sunscreen agents, diagnos­
tic agents, nutraceuticals (vitamins), biopharmaceuticals (medical drugs produced by 
biotechnology), growth-enhancing chemicals used in livestock operations and many 
others are included. Also note that microplastics are used in some of these prod­
ucts mainly in cosmetic applications. This broad collection of substances containing 
microplastics (<5 mm) refers, in general, to any product used by individuals for 
cosmetic reasons (e.g., anti-aging cleansers, toners, exfoliators, facial masks, serums 
and lip balm).
Note that wastewater treatment processes remove many substances and particles 
from the wastestream; however, as mentioned earlier this may not be the case with 
PPCPs and microplastics—they largely pass through unchanged. The micro- and 
nano-particle plastics used in PPCP products, as well as other microplastics caused 
by fragmentation, are available for ingestion by a wide range of animals in the 
aquatic food web. We can say without a doubt that the problem with PPCPs is that 
we do not know what we do not know about them—the jury is still out on their exact 
environmental impact.
Even though the jury is still out on PPCPs and although PPCPs are used in large 
quantities, the concentrations of PPCPs currently being found in water suppliers 
are very small. The laboratory tests for these compounds do not report concentra­
tions in parts per million (ppm) or parts per billion (ppb) but instead report con­
centrations in parts per trillion (ppt), which is the same as nanograms per liter. One 
part per million is equivalent to a shot glass full of water dipped from an Olympic 
swimming that is 2 m deep. One part per billion is equivalent to one drop from 
an eye dropper filled from the same Olympic pool. One part per trillion is equiva­
lent to 1 drop in 20 Olympic pools that are 2 m deep, or 1 second in 31,700 years 
(Spellman, 2014).

42
The Science of Ocean Pollution
THE BOTTOM LINE
Sunscreen, body lotion, insect repellents, essential oils, cosmetic makeup and other 
cosmetics, and hair products can make their way into the floating seas via the bod­
ies of swimmers and pharmaceuticals via human and animal excretion, disposed of 
drugs and medicines, and illicit drug activities. These substances negatively affect 
sea life such as sea urchins, algae, fish, mammals and coral reefs. As detrimental 
as these products and substance are to the floating seas, they are not alone in their 
impact. And this is clearly pointed out in the remaining chapters of this book.

The Floating Oily Sea
This chapter could begin with thousands of words describing the tragedy, the hor­
ror, heartbreak, the suffering that sea life undergoes when the floating sea becomes 
oily. Instead, to get the point across as succinctly as possible, without wasting words 
Figure 6.1 is included here.
To gain understanding of the impact of oil on and in the Floating Seas, we must 
have knowledge of the substance itself. Now this may seem a funny or weird state­
ment to many who will simply ask “who does not know what oil is?” The truth be 
known the term “oil” is a general classification of a substance that has many facets, 
so to speak. Common thinking is that oil is a single, simple substance and most 
of us know exactly what it is. When asked to describe oil, what it looks like, most 
people would probably describe it as black in appearance, and viscous in hand; it is 
molasses-like. First of all, oil comes in a wide variety of colors and is not always 
black. Instead, oil color ranges from black to red to yellow, and oil can appear in a 
number of different colors and consistencies. Because of the color range of oils, it 
can be difficult for oil spill searchers to identify the oil from the air. In viewing an 
oil spill from the air, the oil nearest to the source and visibly spraying out of the well 
is yellowish in color. As the oil collects in an oil pollution boom, it gets thicker and 
becomes orange in color. The thickest oil that is collected to the far end of a pollution 
boom is black.
Different types of oil can vary in appearance. However, an oil slick appearance is 
affected by weather conditions and how long the oil has been out on the water. After 
a few days of exposure to varying weather conditions, oil slick can dramatically 
change appearance. For example, with time oil can become patchy, it can emulsify, 
or become mixed with water. Also, oil color and consistency can change as the oil 
encounters other materials in the water, or simply the exposure to air. Even close to 
the source of the spill, the colors can be quite variable depending on the thickness 
of the oil.
Because oil comes in such a wide variety of colors, it can be mistaken for some­
thing else—and vice versa. For instance, an oil spill can be a false spill. This is espe­
cially the case when viewed from the air—naturally occurring algae look a lot like 
a reddish-brown oil; boat wakes, seagrass and many other things can look like oil.
The reality is that oil is not a single substance, and is definitely not simple in 
composition, and most of us have no clue as to what exactly oil is. For instance, there 
are many kinds of oil. The differentiation of oils is made according to their viscosity, 
volatility and toxicity. Viscosity refers to an oil’s resistance to flow; that is, its thick­
ness, stickiness, tackiness and/or gumminess. Volatility refers to how quickly the 
oil evaporates in air; that is, its instability, unpredictability, explosiveness. Toxicity 
refers to how toxic, or poisonous, the oil is to either people or other organisms (like 
sea life), that is, its noxiousness, harmfulness, injuriousness.

OIL CLASSIFICATIONS (NOAA, 2020)
Oil is classified into five basic groups.
Group 1: Non-Persistent Light Oils (Gasoline, Condensate)
This group is highly volatile and usually evaporates within 1–2 days. After evapo­
ration, no residue is left behind. It contains high concentrations of toxic (soluble) 
compounds and can cause localized, severe impacts to water column and intertidal 
DID YOU KNOW?
Crude oil and natural gas naturally enter the floating seas at areas known as 
“seeps.” These hydrocarbons leak through the ground through fractures and 
sediments.
DID YOU KNOW?
When spilled, the various types of oil can affect the environment differently, 
and they also differ in how hard they are to clean up.

resources. Cleanup operations can be dangerous due to high flammability and toxic 
air hazard.
Group 2: Persistent Light Oils (Diesel, No. 2 Fuel Oil, Light Crudes)
This group is moderately volatile, and will leave residue up to about one-third of the 
spill amount after a few days. It consists of moderate concentrations of toxic (soluble) 
compounds and will “oil” or contaminated intertidal resources with long-term con­
tamination potential. Cleanup is usually very effective.
Group 3: Medium Oils (Most Crude Oils, IFO 180-Intermediate 
Fuel Oil w/98% Residual Oil and 2% Distillate Oil)
One-third of this group will evaporate within 24 hours. Oil contamination of inter­
tidal areas can be severe and long-term. Impacts to waterfowl and fur-bearing mam­
mals can be severe. If conducted quickly, cleanup can be quite effective.
Group 4: Heavy Oils (Heavy Crude Oils, No. 6 Fuel Oil—Used by 
Ocean Liners and Tanker Fuel; Bunker C Is a Heavier Variety)
In this group, there is little to no evaporation. Heavy contamination of intertidal areas 
is likely. It can have severe impacts to waterfowl and fur-bearing mammals (coating 
and ingestion) and can cause long-term contamination of sediments. Members in 
this group weather very slowly. Under any and all conditions, shoreline cleanup is 
difficult.
Group 5: Sinking Oils (Slurry Oil, Residual Oils)
Members of this group sink in water. On shorelines, contamination is similar to 
Group 4. When spilled in water, oil usually sinks quickly enough that no shore­
line contamination occurs. When submerged, there is no evaporation or dissolution. 
For animals living in bottom sediments impact can be severe, especially for mus­
sels. Sediment is usually contaminated long-term. Dredging is usually employed to 
remove sinking oils from the bottom.
OIL SPILL TYPES
Oil spills are classified by ten oil types, including:
•	 Biodiesel Spills—when spilled tend to behave similar to petrodiesel at 
first, i.e., they remain on the surface and spread very quickly to a thin 
film. Biodiesels contain mild surfactants. Their rate of natural dispersion 
increases droplet formation and slows the rate of droplet resurfacing. They 
form white, milky emulsion. Biodiesel is slightly more viscous than pet­
rodiesel, especially at lower temperatures. As a result, recovery rates are 

46
The Science of Ocean Pollution
higher with skimmers than petrodiesel. Biodiesels are slightly soluble in 
water. For water-column toxicity, it varies widely by biodiesels, possibly 
due to differences in feedstocks and additives. Small droplets of biodiesel 
can have a mothering effect on small organisms. Biodiesels biodegrade 
roughly 2.5 times faster than petrodiesels. Aquatic life can suffocate due to 
oxygen depletion for releases to shallow or isolated water bodies. Biodiesel 
can foul fur and feathers; bird eggs coated with biodiesel can have com­
plete hatching failure. With regard to fate, environmental and toxicological 
information regarding biodiesel spills, the jury is still out with no definitive 
conclusions as of yet (Hollebone et al., 2007; Hollebone & Yang, 2009).
•	 Denatured Ethanol Spills—Denatured alcohol is a mixture of ethanol 
(grain alcohol) that is blended with 2–7% unleaded gasoline to make it 
undrinkable. Other additives often present in denatured ethanol include 
methanol (4%), methyl isobutyl ketone (2%) and ethyl acetate (1%). The 
most common ethanol product shipped by rail is called E98 (2% gasoline). 
The behavior of spills to the floating seas will vary, depending upon the 
mixing energy and dilution potential of the receiving water. In fast-flowing 
and deep waterbodies, rapid mixing and dilution is typical, and as a result 
low concentrations; in slow, shallow waterbodies, elevated concentrations 
are expected to persist for days. Ethanol does not adsorb to soils very well. 
If spilled onto soil, it will seep into the ground and will be transported 
with groundwater. It does not sorb well onto carbon, so treatment of con­
taminated water by filtering with granulated activated carbon is not very 
effective. Ethanol biodegradation rates in soil, groundwater and surface 
water have predicted half-lives ranging from 0.1 to 10 days at tempera­
tures >50°F. In colder temperatures, ethanol can persist for several months. 
Gasoline constituents tend to be more persistent. The presence of ethanol 
in blended fuels can slow the rate of degradation of benzene, toluene, ethyl 
benzene and xylenes (BTEX) compounds in the gasoline fraction (the etha­
nol is preferentially degraded first), which can extend the transport of BTE 
in groundwater plumes. Ethanol is considered to be practically nontoxic, 
based on acute toxicity tests with aquatic species. However, releases to 
water can cause fish kills as a result of the high biochemical oxygen demand 
(BOD), which can lower dissolved oxygen levels leading to hypoxia. For 
large spills, the hypoxic plume can travel downstream and kill fish for tens 
of miles and days after the release (Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 2016; 
National Response Team, 2010; Shaw, 2011).
•	 Dielectric Fluid Spills (non-PCB fluids)—The primary components in 
dielectric fluids are mineral oils, light petroleum distillates, silicone flu­
ids, and synthetic and natural esters. Multiple products can be used in 
cables and other equipment. The greatest hazard of dielectric fluid spills to 
biological resources is smothering. Dielectric fluids may cause bird mor­
tality by hypothermia from matted feathers. Greater risks to birds may 
result from large aggregations in the proximity of the spill. Mineral oils, 
silicone fluids and ester-based fluids have low to very low water solubility 
(1< ppm), aquatic toxicity and bioaccumulation potential; therefore, mortality 

47
The Floating Oily Sea
of aquatic resources (fish, invertebrates and seaweed) is unlikely. Products 
based on light petroleum distillates will have physical and fate properties 
based on their chemical composition. Environmental hazard may be attrib­
uted primarily to the additives used in these products. The effects of low 
dissolved oxygen concentration may be a concern of highly biodegradable 
dielectric fluids, particularly for releases to shallow or isolated water bodies. 
There is little fate, environmental and toxicological information regarding 
spills of these fluids in freshwater and marine environment (NOAA, 2019).
•	 Small Diesel Spills (500–5000 gallons)—Diesel fuel is light, refined 
petroleum product with a relatively narrow boiling range. It is much lighter 
than water (specific gravity is 0.82–0.88 vs. 1.00 for fresh water and 1.03 
for seawater). It is not possible for diesel to sink and accumulate on the 
bottom as free oil. Diesel is one of the most acutely toxic oil types. Fish 
and invertebrates that come in direct contact with naturally dispersed and 
entrained diesel in the water column of the floating seas may be killed. 
However, small spills in open water are so rapidly diluted that fish kills 
have never been reported. Fish kills have been reported for small spills in 
confined, shallow water and in streams, where weathering and mixing are 
reduced. Fish and invertebrates in small streams can be affected for miles 
downstream of a diesel release. High mortality of animals and plants occur 
in diesel-soaked wetland soils. Marine birds are affected by direct contact. 
Mortality is caused by ingestion during preening or by hypothermia from 
matted feathers. Experience with small diesel spills is that few birds are 
directly affected because of the short time the oil is on the water surface. 
However, small spills could result in serious impacts to birds under the 
“wrong” conditions, such as a spill adjacent to a nesting colony or transport 
of steams into a bird concentration area. Shellfish can be tainted from diesel 
spills in shallow, nearshore areas. These organisms bioaccumulate the oil, 
but will also depurate (i.e., made free from impurities) the oil, usually over 
a period of several weeks after exposure ends.
•	 Diluted Bitumen (Dilbit) Spills—Diluted bitumen (Dilbit) is unconven­
tional crude oils created by mixing bitumen, which is a highly viscous form 
of petroleum with a density close to 1 g/cm3, with a lighter hydrocarbon 
(diluent) to meet the minimum requirements for transport in pipelines vis­
cosity <350cSt (centistokes) and density <0.34 g/cm3. The greatest hazard 
of diluted bitumen spills to biological resources is smothering. The aquatic 
toxicity of diluted bitumen varies widely due to variations in the chemical 
composition of the source of bitumen oil and the products used as diluents. 
However, the aquatic toxicity of diluted bitumen oils is generally similar to 
that of conventional crude. Chronic toxicity due to residual oil associated 
with sediments may be of greater concern. Early containment and recovery 
are key to reducing the risks of the oil submerging or sinking in freshwater, 
as it will lose the diluent by evaporation over time and can adhere to par­
ticulates in the water under turbulent conditions.
•	 Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) Spills—Heavy fuel oils (HFO) are dense, viscous 
oils. They are produced by blending heavy residual oils (a by-product of 

48
The Science of Ocean Pollution
producing the light products that are the primary focus of a refinery) with a 
lighter oil to meet specifications for viscosity and pour point. The greatest 
hazard of heavy fuel oil spills to biological resources is smothering. Adverse 
effects of floating HFO are related primarily to coating of wildlife dwell­
ing on the water surface, smothering of intertidal organisms and long-term 
sediment contamination. Direct mortality rates can be high for seabirds, 
waterfowl and fur-bearing marine mammals, especially where populations 
are concentrated in small areas, such as during bird migrations or marine 
mammal haulouts (i.e., when floating sea mammals temporarily leave the 
sea to forage). Direct mortality rates are generally less for shorebirds and 
wading birds, because they rarely enter the water. Shorebirds, which feed 
in intertidal habitats where oil strands and persists, are at higher risk of 
sublethal effects either from contaminated or reduced populations of prey. 
When released to water, dissolution of water-soluble constituents in HFOs 
will depend on environmental factors affecting water-column mixing and 
oil weathering. Due to the low water solubility of their chemical constitu­
ents, the toxicity of HFOs to aquatic organisms is expected to be lower 
than that of other petroleum products including diesel. Chronic toxicity 
associated with residual oil associated with sediments may be of greater 
concern.
•	 Kerosene and Jet Fuel Spills—Kerosene is a light refined product (C6–C16) 
that has a lower boiling point range than diesel/No. 2 fuel oils. Jet-A (freeze 
point of -40°C) and JetA1 (freeze point of -47°C) are highly refined kero­
sene-type fuels used in commercial and general aviation turbine engines. 
JP-8 is military fuel that is similar to Jet-A1 but contains additional addi­
tives (de-icing, anti-bacterial, anti-corrosive and anti-static agents) that are 
added in amounts equal to a few 100 ppm. These are the most commonly 
used jet fuels today. The rapid loss by evaporation for spills to open water 
reduces the exposure to aquatic organisms, and thus fish kills are seldom 
reported. Spills to small streams with dense vegetation cover will evaporate 
much slower, allowing the fuel to persist and impact both animals and veg­
etation. For example, the release of 112,000 gallons of JP-5 into a mangrove 
creek in Puerto Rico in October 1999 resulted in impacts to 50 acres of 
mangrove forest and mortality of 30 acres. There was extensive mortality 
of fish, shellfish and birds. A culvert was plugged to prevent the fuel from 
spreading further downstream, which raised the water level by 3 ft. The 
mangrove canopy slowed evaporation, allowing recovery of 15–20% of the 
spilled fuel (U.S. Department of Commerce, 2019). Jet fuels are relatively 
less acutely toxic than diesel. Aquatic organisms that come in direct con­
tact with naturally dispersed and entrained jet fuel in the floating sea water 
column may be killed. However, small spills in open water may not result 
in fish kills. Fish kills may occur for small spills in confined, shallow water 
and in streams, where weathering and mixing are reduced. Fish and inver­
tebrates in small streams can be affected for miles downstream of a jet fuel 
release into the water.

The Floating Oily Sea
•	 Non-Petroleum Oil Spills—Non-petroleum oils include vegetable oils 
(soybean oil, palm oil, sunflower oil and rapeseed oil—see Figures 6.1 and 
6.2) and animal fats (e.g., beef tallow oil). These oils are regulated under 
40 CFR 112 and have similar spill-planning requirements as petroleum 
oils. Vegetable-based oils can be used as lubricants in dredges and other 
marine equipment. The greatest hazard of vegetable oil spills to biologi­
cal resources, particularly in their liquid form, is smothering. They can 
cause physical effects by coating animals and plants with oil. Wildlife that 
becomes coated with animal fats or vegetable oils could die of hypothermia, 
dehydration and diarrhea, starvation or suffocation from clogging of nos­
trils, throat or gills. They will foul shorelines, clog water treatment plants 
and burn when ignition sources are present. After polymerization, oxida­
tion or mixing with debris, vegetable oils can become denser than water 
and sink, forming an impermeable cap on the sediments and smothering 
benthic resources. Large spills of vegetable oils that have polymerized have 
been described as:
•	 Soybean oil: Spill to a freshwater river that formed milky material and 
hard crusts on the shoreline, as well as stringy, rubbery masses that 
sank.
•	 Unrefined sunflower oil: Marine spill thank sank and formed a cap on 
benthic habitats, as well as concrete-like lumps in intertidal sandy sedi­
ments that persisted for >6 years.
All non-petroleum oils can rapidly deplete the oxygen levels in sediments and 
isolated water bodies because of the high biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). Thus, 
aquatic life can suffocate. Birds may not be able to detect or avoid slicks of vegetable 
oil on the floating sea. Relatively small spills have killed hundreds of birds. Vegetable 
oils lack chemical compounds that are acutely toxic to aquatic organisms. However, 
vegetable oils can form toxic intermediate products during oxidation and microbial 
degradation that have been shown to be toxic to microorganisms, algae, plankton, 
mussels and amphipods. Despite this, toxicity to aquatic resources from vegetable 
oils is primarily driven by oxygen depletion and asphyxiation. They will produce 
rancid odors; thus, residues could become an attractant to animals, such as bears, 
which could increase their risk of human encounters or vehicle strikes when cross­
ing roads to access the spill site. Unpolymerized vegetable oils in sediments rapidly 
and completely biodegrade, even under anaerobic conditions, particularly when the 
concentrations are below 2% by weight. Higher sediment concentrations will take 
longer, up to several months. Little is known about the properties and behavior of 
animal fats, which tend to be more solid at ambient temperatures. A spill of 15,000 
gallons of beef tallow into the Houston Ship Channel in 2011 formed thick patties 
that were controlled using fish nets and removed using pitchforks. Animal fats would 
likely pose fouling risks to animals and plants, have a high BOD, produce rancid 
odors and biodegrade slowly (CEDRE, 2008; Mudge, 1995; Mudge, 1997; Mudge, 
Goodchild, & Wheeler, 1995; Salam et al., 2012).

50
The Science of Ocean Pollution
•	 Light Shale (Tight) Oil Spills—Light shale oils (also called light tight 
oils) are very light crude oils from oil reservoirs with very low permeability 
that are produced by horizontal drilling and fracking methods (e.g., from 
Bakken and Eagle Ford formations). Often, the production sites do not have 
a local or central processing facility, and the crude oil that is shipped off 
site contains all the volatile fractions. This characteristic may create added 
fire and air quality concerns during spills because of the oil’s high volatility.
The aquatic toxicity of light shale oils varies widely due to variations in 
the chemical composition of the oil source. Light shale oils containing rela­
tively high concentrations of the more water-soluble oil components may 
pose greater risks of acute toxicity. These fractions are also highly volatile; 
thus, exposures may be of short duration. Aquatic organisms that come in 
direct contact with naturally dispersed and entrained light shale oil in the 
water column may be killed. However, small spills in open water many do 
not result in fish kills due to rapid dilution and evaporation. Fish kills my 
occur for small spills in confined, shallow water and in streams, where 
weathering and mixing are reduced. Fish and invertebrates in small stream

Rapeseed (see Figure 6.2) is a bright-yellow flowering member of the mustard 
or cabbage family, cultivated mainly for its oil-rich seed, which naturally con­
tains appreciable amounts of erucic acid (a monounsaturated omega-9 fatty 
acid). Probably the best-known rapeseed is Canola especially bred to have a 
very low level of erucic acid and are especially prized for use for human and 
animal food.

can be affected for miles downstream of a light shale oil release into the 
water.
•	 Synthetic-Based Drilling Mud Spills—Drilling muds are used to lubricate 
and cool the drill bit, control reservoir pressure and transport drill cuttings 
back to the surface during oil exploration and development. There are three 
types of drilling muds: oil-based, water-based and synthetic-based. In con­
trast to synthetic-based fluids, both oil-based (i.e., diesel oil and/or mineral 
oil, containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [PAHs]) and water-based 
drilling fluids are considered to be traditional materials, which have lower 
drilling performance and are associated with greater water and sediment 
quality issues. Synthetic-based drilling muds (SBMs) are often used during 
drilling of deep water and directional well. EPA prohibits the discharge 
of synthetic-based drilling muds and oil-based drilling muds and cuttings. 
Bulk drilling muds are not intentionally discharged; however, drilling fluids 
that include drilling mud and cuttings may be treated to remove the bulk 
of the drilling mud (cuttings can contain ~10% synthetic chemical content) 
and discharged in Federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico and Cook Inlet, 
AK. Both synthetic-based drilling muds and cuttings mixed with muds 
can be accidentally discharged. SBMs and their biodegradation products 
exhibit low toxicity to water-column organisms, and thus there is low risk of 
direct toxicity from the settling material. Because SBM cuttings clump and 
settle rapidly, impacts associated with increased water-column turbidity are 
likely of short duration. However, slow moving and sessile benthic fauna 
within the footprint of the deposition zone are at risk of smothering by the 
settling material. The metals in SBM discharges have a low bioavailability 
and low toxicity to marine organisms because they are in solid or com­
plexed forms and will either disperse or settle out to the seafloor. They are 
associated with dispersed cuttings and solid additives (barite and clays), not 
with the continuous phase (water, oil or synthetic), in drilling fields. Filter 
feeders such as mussels have shown rapid uptake of SBM chemicals in lab­
oratory tests (and rapid elimination when placed in clean water). Damage to 
gills of suspension- and deposit-feeding bivalves has been reported in labo­
ratory tests with barite, a major constituent of SBMs. In areas of high SBM 
concentrations in sediments, the sediments can become oxygen depleted 
due to the increased biological oxygen demand of aerobic biodegradation. 
When this happens, sensitive species can die off and be replaced by hardier 
opportunistic species. This decrease in benthic biological diversity can be 
reversed when anaerobic biodegradation of the drilling mud organics low­
ers their concentration enough for the sediments to become re-oxygenated, 
although it may take years for recovery to be complete (Neff, McKelvey, & 
Ayers, 2000; Stout & Payne, 2018).
THE BOTTOM LINE
Spilled oil into the floating seas can harm living things because its chemical constit­
uents are poisonous. Because most oils float, the creatures most affected by oil are 
animals like sea otters and seabirds that are found on the sea surface of on shorelines 

52
The Science of Ocean Pollution
if the oil comes ashore. If the oil remains on a beach for a while, other creatures, such 
as snails, clams and terrestrial animals may suffer. Ultimately, the effects of any oil 
depend on where it spilled, where it goes, and what animals and plants, or people, 
it affects.

The Floating Sewer Sea
INTRODUCTION
Water—the ace of elements. Water dives from the clouds without parachute, wings 
or safety net. Water runs over the steepest precipice and blinks not a lash. Water is 
buried and rises again; water walks on fire and fire gets the blisters. Stylishly com­
posed in any situation—solid, gas or liquid—speaking in penetrating dialects under­
stood by all things—animal, vegetable or mineral—water travels intrepidly through 
four dimensions, sustaining (Kick a lettuce in the field and it will yell “Water!”), 
destroying (The Dutch boy’s finger remembered the view from Ararat) and creat­
ing (It has even been said that human beings were invented by water as a device for 
transporting itself from one place to another, but that’s another story). Always in 
motion, ever flowing (whether at stream rate or glacier speed), rhythmic, dynamic, 
ubiquitous, changing and working its changes, a mathematics turned wrong side out, 
a philosophy in reverse, the ongoing odyssey of water is irresistible (Robbins, 1976).
Note: The reader may wonder why freshwater and wastewater and their contami­
nants and pathogens are covered in this chapter and in the chapters that follow when 
it is ocean pollution we are concerned with in this text? Simply, keep in mind that 
all water flows to the seas and the oceans in one manner or another. So, the author 
deliberately includes freshwater contamination because the contaminants are often 
passengers carried to the seas.
WARNING: SWIMMING PROHIBITED!
WATER CONTAMINATED
Have you ever planned a beach outing for fun in the surf? Or maybe you just wanted to 
get away from it all (whatever “it all” is) and enjoy just taking in the beach scenery and 
the smell of the floating sea. Considering that Earth is covered by more than 70% of 
floating seas, it is not a strange or happen stance occurrence for people to take in the won­
ders provided by the floating seas of the world. In the United States, for example, 23 of 
the 50 states are bordered by or surrounded by (e.g., Hawaii) the floating seas. Therefore, 
it is not that uncommon for citizens of the United States (and other countries) to eventu­
ally find their way to the beach seeking recreation or, again, to get away from it all.
The problem for those seeking a fun time at the beach, for whatever reason, is 
that it is not that unusual for the fun-seekers to arrive at a beach here, there, or 
wherever and to find signs posted warning not to enter the water because they are 
contaminated. The contamination that would-be swimmers are warned about is not 
necessarily the result of garbage dumped into the waters, and also is not normally the 
result of driftwood and seaweed riding (Nature’s sea riders) the waves and eventually 
making their way to the shoreline.
No, it is not Nature’s sea riders that close the beach. Instead, it is the pathogenic 
microorganisms that may be in the water, making exposure to disease-bearing 
organisms that make the water unsafe for swimmers.

The Science of Ocean Pollution
So, the question becomes what is contaminating the beaches? The answer: Sewage 
(aka wastewater) is the culprit (see Figure 7.1). Sewage originates primarily from 
domestic, commercial and industrial sources and boaters. Many are under the impres­
sion that once they flush their toilets or drain their sinks, bathtubs and shower water 
that the wastestream is conveyed either to a local wastewater treatment plant or a pri­
vate, on-site or facility septic tank for treatment and proper disposal with the end result 
being the transformation of contaminated wastewater into a safe product discharged 
back into the environment. Note that when a wastewater treatment plant is properly 
operated and maintained, the treated wastestream that outfalls into the receiving water 
body is usually cleaner than the water in the receiving body. This may surprise many 
but based on experience I have found this to be the case and not the exception.
So, what is the problem?
In regard to sewage discharges into the floating seas, the problem is multi-
faceted. Meaning the problem is aggravated because of several different sources of 
raw sewage, mostly sludge (aka biosolids) released or dumped into the floating seas. 
Although wastewater (sewage) treatment facilities are designed to accommodate and 
treat wastewater from their service area, partly treated or even untreated wastewater 
sometimes is discharged. Part of the multi-faceted problem has to do with decayed, 
dated, poorly maintained infrastructure. Wastewater treatment plants that are not

Environmental Pollution, 4th ed. (2021). Boca Raton, FL: CRC Press.)

55
The Floating Sewer Sea
properly maintained and operated are an element of the multi-faceted problem. 
Another negative element can be attributed to weather; that is, heavy rainfall events 
can overwhelm the treatment unit processes using combined sewers and stormwater 
systems (aka combined sewer overflows—CSOs—see Figure 7.1). CSOs are sewers 
that are designed to collect rainwater runoff, domestic sewage and industrial waste­
water in the same piping system. For the most part, combined sewer systems convey 
all of their wastewater to a wastewater treatment plant, where it is treated and then 
discharged to a water body. During weather events that include heavy rainfall or 
snowmelt, however, the wastewater volume in a combined sewer system can exceed 
the capacity of the wastewater treatment plant. For this reason, combined sewer sys­
tems are designed to overflow occasionally and discharge excess wastewater directly 
into the receiving water body. These overflows, called combined sewer overflows 
(CSOs), contain not only storm water but also untreated human and industrial waste, 
toxic substances/materials and debris. They are a major floating water pollution con­
cern for more than 770 cities in the United States that have combined sewer systems. 
CSOs may be thought of as a type of “urban wet weather” discharge. This means 
that, like sanitary sewer overflows (SSOs) and storm water discharges, they are dis­
charges from a municipality’s wastewater conveyance infrastructure that are caused 
by precipitation events such as rainfall or heavy snowmelt.
Another way in which raw sewage enters the floating seas is whenever wastewa­
ter treatment plants bypass the treatment system or unit processes. This occasion­
ally occurs whenever the treatment process malfunctions for one reason or another. 
Often times, these types of bypasses are kept quiet from the public because of the 
possible embarrassment that might be generated from such practices.
In unsewered areas, improperly designed or malfunctioning septic tanks can con­
taminate groundwater and surface water, including coastal areas of the floating seas. In 
some developed regions (Halifax Harbor in Nova Scotia, Canada raw sewage continued 
to pour into the Harbor until 2008 when a wastewater treatment plant was put online), 
raw sewage continues to pour into harbors, bays and coastal waters of the floating seas. 
In developing countries with no on-site or centralized sanitation facilities, no opportu­
nity exists for any type of treatment, and human wastes go directly into the floating seas. 
Before 1972 in the United States, sewage sludge (aka biosolids) was routinely dumped 
into the floating seas. Although today’s environmental regulations in the United States 
prohibit this practice, sewage sludge is still disposed at sea in some countries.
Note: Raw sewage runoff into rivers, lakes, creeks, streams and even in ground­
water will eventually make their way to the oceans. It may take considerable time for 
this to occur and by the time it does much of the pollutants within this wastestream 
are deposited in earthly structures (in soils, ground mostly) before they empty into 
the seas. The key to mitigating point and nonpoint sewage pollution is treatment. 
Thus, in the following section, the basics of wastewater treatment is presented.
SETTING THE STAGE
Before we discuss surface water pollution, we must define several important terms 
related to water pollution. One of these is point source. A point source is, as defined 
by the Clean Water Act (CWA), any discernible, confined and discrete conveyance, 

56
The Science of Ocean Pollution
including but not limited to any pipe, ditch, channel, tunnel, conduit, well, discrete 
fissure, container, rolling stock, concentrated animal feeding operation (CAFO), or 
vessel or other floating craft, from which pollutants are discharged. For example, 
the outfalls of industrial facilities or wastewater treatment plants are point sources. 
A nonpoint source, in contrast, is more widely dispersed. An example of nonpoint 
source of pollution is rainwater carrying topsoil (sediments), animal waste (feces) 
and chemical contaminants into a stream. Nonpoint pollution includes water runoff 
from farming, urban areas, forestry and construction activities. Nonpoint sources 
comprise the largest source of water pollution, contributing an estimated 70% or 
more of the contamination in quality-impaired surface waters. Note that atmospheric 
deposition of pollutants is also a nonpoint source of acid, nutrients, metals and other 
airborne pollutants.
Another important term associated with nonpoint sources is runoff. Runoff means 
a nonpoint source that originated on land. The USEPA considers polluted runoff the 
most serious water pollution problem in the United States. Runoff occurs because 
of human intervention with landscapes. When land is disturbed by parking lots, tar­
mac, roads, factories, homes and buildings, rainwater is not free to percolate through 
the soil, which absorbs and detoxifies many pollutants. Instead, when there is little 
if any soil, contaminated rainwater runs off into area water bodies, polluting them.
Surface Water Pollutants
Surface water pollutants can harm aquatic life, threaten human health or result in the 
loss of recreational or aesthetic potential. Surface water pollutants come from indus­
trial sources, nonpoint sources, municipal sources, background sources and other/
unknown sources. The question is, what are the pollutants of concern for surface 
water systems? The eight chief pollutants are biochemical oxygen demand, nutrients, 
suspended solids, pH, oil and grease, pathogenic microorganisms, toxic pollutants 
and nontoxic pollutants.
CASE STUDY 7.1—NONPOINT SOURCE POLLUTION AND 
THE CHESAPEAKE BAY
Water quality in the Chesapeake Bay is directly related to the quality of the water 
that enters the bay through fresh water sources. The Susquehanna River provides 
roughly half of the Chesapeake Bay’s fresh water.
The water quality of the Susquehanna River is directly related to the water qual­
ity of its tributaries, which include dozens of smaller rivers and creeks that travel 
through agricultural lands. Runoff from farms and feedlots are primary culprits of 
nonpoint source pollution, the focus of much environmental concern, and a problem 
much more difficult to trace, locate, control or remediate than point source pollution.
The Chesapeake Bay’s environmental condition has been an enormous source of 
concern. While Bay cleanup efforts have made progress over the last several years, 
the exact causes of the Bay’s decreased crab and oyster populations are not proved. 
Are increased levels of nitrogen from fertilizers affecting the Bay’s biota? Is exces­
sive sedimentation the culprit? Studies of possible causes and millions of dollars 

57
The Floating Sewer Sea
invested in a variety of remediation efforts have begun to display a wide variety of 
results. Only solid, careful scientific examination will provide the answer (Lancaster 
New Era, 10/1/98).
CASE STUDY 7.2—GOOD SCIENCE VS. “FEEL GOOD” SCIENCE
Environmental policymakers in the Commonwealth of Virginia came up with what 
is called the Lower James River Tributary Strategy on the subject of nitrogen (a 
nutrient) from the Lower James River and other tributaries contaminating the Lower 
Chesapeake Bay Region. When in excess, nitrogen is a pollutant. Some “theorists” 
jumped on nitrogen as being the cause of a decrease in the oyster population in 
the Lower Chesapeake Bay Region. Oysters are important to the local region. They 
are important for economical and other reasons. From an environmental point of 
view, oysters are important to the Lower Chesapeake Bay Region because they have 
worked to maintain relatively clean Bay water in the past. Oysters are filter-feeders. 
They suck in water and its accompanying nutrients and other substances. The oyster 
sorts out the ingredients in the water and uses those nutrients it needs to sustain its 
life. Impurities (pollutants) are aggregated into a sort of ball that is excreted by the 
oyster back into the James River.
You must understand that there was a time, not all that long ago (maybe 50 years 
ago), when oysters thrived in the Lower Chesapeake Bay. Because they were so 
abundant, these filter-feeders were able to take in turbid Bay water and turn it almost 
clear in a matter of three days. (How could anyone dredge up, clean and then eat such 
a wonderful natural vacuum cleaner?)
Of course, this is not the case today.
The oysters are almost all gone.
Where did they go?
Who knows?
The point is that they are no longer thriving, no longer colonizing the Lower 
Chesapeake Bay Region in numbers they did in the past. Thus, they are no longer 
providing economic stability to watermen; moreover, they are no longer cleaning 
the Bay.
Ah! But don’t panic! The culprit is at hand; it has been identified. The “environ­
mentalists” know the answer—they say it has to be nutrient contamination; namely, 
nitrogen is the culprit. Right?
Not so fast.
A local sanitation district and a university in the Lower Chesapeake Bay region 
formed a study group to formally, professionally and scientifically study this prob­
lem. Over a five-year period, using Biological Nutrient Removal (BNR) techniques 
at a local wastewater treatment facility, it was determined that the effluent leaving 
the treatment plant and entering the Lower James River consistently contained below 
8 mg/L nitrogen (a relatively small amount) for five consecutive years.
The first question is: Has the water in the Chesapeake Bay become cleaner, clearer 
because of the reduced nitrogen levels leaving the treatment plant?
The second question is: Have the oysters returned?
Answer to both questions, respectively: no; not really.

58
The Science of Ocean Pollution
Wait a minute. The environmentalists, the regulators and other well-meaning 
interlopers stated that the problem was nitrogen. If nitrogen levels have been reduced 
in the Lower James River, shouldn’t the oysters start thriving, colonizing and clean­
ing the Lower Chesapeake Bay again?
You might think so, but they are not. It is true that the nitrogen level in the waste­
water effluent was significantly lowered through treatment. It is also true that a major 
point source contributor of nitrogen was reduced with a corresponding decrease in 
the nitrogen level in the Lower Chesapeake Bay.
If the nitrogen level has decreased, then where are the oysters?
A more important question is: What is the real problem?
The truth is that no one at this point in time can give a definitive answer to this 
question.
Back to the original question: Why has the oyster population decreased?
One theory states that because the tributaries feeding the Lower Chesapeake Bay 
(including the James River) carry megatons of sediments into the bay (stormwater 
runoff, etc.), they are adding to the Bay’s turbidity problem. When waters are highly 
turbid, oysters do the best they can to filter out the sediments but eventually they 
decrease in numbers and then fade into the abyss.
Is this the answer? That is, is the problem with the Lower Chesapeake Bay and its 
oyster population related to turbidity?
Only solid, legitimate, careful scientific analysis may provide the answer.
One thing is certain; before we leap into decisions that are ill-advised, that are 
based on anything but sound science and that “feel” good, we need to step back and 
size up the situation. This sizing-up procedure can be correctly accomplished only 
through the use of scientific methods.
Don’t we already have too many dysfunctional managers making too many dys­
functional decisions that result in harebrained, dysfunctional analysis—and results?
Obviously, there is no question that we need to stop the pollution of Chesapeake 
Bay.
However, shouldn’t we replace the timeworn and frustrating position that “we 
must start somewhere” with good common sense and legitimate science?
The bottom line: We shouldn’t do anything to our environment until science sup­
ports the investment.
The Bottom Line: Shouldn’t we do it right?
Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)
Organic matter (dead plants and animal debris, and wild animal and bird feces), 
human sewage, food-processing wastes, chemical plant wastes, slaughterhouse 
wastes, pulp- and paper-making operations wastes and tannery wastes discharged 
to a water body are degraded by oxygen-requiring microorganisms. The amount of 
oxygen consumed during microbial utilization of organics is called the biochemical 
oxygen demand (BOD). BOD is classified as a conventional pollutant because it 
is amendable to treatment by a municipal sewage treatment plant. Although some 
natural BOD is almost always present, BOD is often an indication of the presence of 
sewage and other organic waste. High levels of BOD can deplete the oxygen in water. 

59
The Floating Sewer Sea
Fish and other aquatic organisms present in such waters with low-oxygen conditions 
may die.
Nutrients
Elements such as carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous, sulfur, calcium, iron, potassium, 
manganese, cobalt and boron are called nutrients (or biostimulants); they are essen­
tial to the growth and reproduction of aquatic plants and animals that depend on 
the surrounding water to provide their nutrients. However, just as too much of any 
good thing can have serious side effects for all of us, so it is the case with too many 
nutrients in water. For example, when fertilizers composed of nutrients enter surface 
water systems, over-enrichment with nitrogen and phosphorus may result. A rich 
supply of such nutrients entering a lake may hasten eutrophication, which USEPA 
defines as a process during which a lake evolves into a bog or marsh and eventually 
disappears. Excess nutrients also can stimulate a very abundant dense growth of 
aquatic plants (bloom), especially algae. Again, the two nutrients that concern us in 
this text are nitrogen and phosphorous.
Nitrogen (N2), an extremely stable gas, is the primary component of the earth’s 
atmosphere (78%). The nitrogen cycle is composed of four processes. Three of the 
processes—fixation, ammonification and nitrification—convert gaseous nitrogen 
into usable chemical forms. The fourth process—denitrification—converts fixed 
nitrogen back to the unusable gaseous nitrogen state.
Nitrogen occurs in many forms in the environment and takes part in many bio­
chemical reactions. Major sources of nitrogen include runoff from animal feedlots, 
fertilizer runoff from agricultural fields, from municipal wastewater discharges and 
from certain bacteria and blue-green algae that obtain nitrogen directly from the 
atmosphere. Certain forms of acid rain can also contribute nitrogen to surface waters.
Nitrogen in water is commonly found in the form of Nitrate (NO3), which indi­
cates that the water may be contaminated with sewage. Nitrates can also enter the 
groundwater from chemical fertilizers used in agricultural areas. Excessive nitrate 
concentrations in drinking water pose an immediate health threat to infants, both 
human and animal, and can cause death. The bacteria commonly found in the intes­
tinal tract of infants can convert nitrate to highly toxic nitrites (NO2). Nitrite can 
replace oxygen in the bloodstream and results in oxygen starvation that causes a blu­
ish discoloration of the infant (“blue baby” syndrome).
Phosphorous (P) is an essential nutrient that contributes to the growth of algae 
and the eutrophication of lakes, though its presence in drinking water has little effect 
DID YOU KNOW?
Lakes and reservoirs usually have less than 2 mg/L of nitrate measured as nitro­
gen. Higher nitrate levels are found in groundwater ranging up to 20 mg/L, but 
much higher values are detected in shallow aquifers polluted by sewage and/or 
excessive use of fertilizers.

60
The Science of Ocean Pollution
on health. In aquatic environments, phosphorous is found in the form of phosphate 
and is a limiting nutrient. If all phosphorous is used, plant growth ceases, no matter 
the amount of nitrogen available. Many bodies of freshwater currently experience 
influxes of nitrogen and phosphorous from outside sources. The increasing concen­
tration of available phosphorous allows plants to assimilate more nitrogen before 
the phosphorous is depleted. If sufficient phosphorous is available, high concentra­
tions of nitrates will lead to phytoplankton (algae) and macrophyte (aquatic plant) 
production.
Major sources of phosphorous include phosphates in detergents, fertilizer and 
feedlot runoff, and municipal wastewater discharges. The USEPA 1976 Water 
Quality Standards—Criteria Summaries for phosphorous—recommended a phos­
phorous criterion of 0.10 µg/L (elemental) phosphorus for marine and estuarine 
waters, but no freshwater criterion.
pH
pH refers to the acidity or alkalinity of water; when it exceeds regulatory limits, it 
is considered to be a conventional pollutant. A low pH may mean a water body is 
too acidic to support life optimally. Some water bodies are naturally acidic, but oth­
ers are made so by acidic deposition or acid runoff from mining operations. pH is a 
measure of the hydrogen ion (H+) concentration. Solutions range from very acidic 
(having a high concentration of H+ ions) to very basic (having a high concentration 
of OH− ions). The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, with 7 being the neutral value. The 
pH of water is important to the chemical reactions that take place within water, and 
pH values that are too high or low can inhibit the growth of microorganisms.
With high and low pH values, high pH values are considered basic and low pH 
values are considered acidic. Stated another way, low pH values indicate a high 
level of H+ concentration, while high pH values indicate a low H+ concentration. 
Because of this inverse logarithmic relationship, there is a tenfold difference in H+ 
concentration.
Natural water varies in pH depending on its source. Pure water has a neutral pH, 
with an equal number H+ and OH−. Adding an acid to water causes additional + 
ions to be released, so that the H+ ion concentration goes up and the pH value goes 
down.

In preparing freshwater for potable water uses, waterworks operators test for the 
hydrogen ion concentration of the water to determine the water’s pH. In coagulation 
a test, as more alum (acid) is added, the pH value lowers. If more lime (alkali) is 
added, the pH value raises. This relationship is important in water treatment—if a 
good floc is formed, the pH should then be determined and maintained at that pH 
value until the raw water changes.
Pollution can change a water’s pH, which in turn can harm animals and plants 
living in the water. For instance, water coming out of an abandoned coal mine can 
have a pH of 2, which is very acidic and would definitely affect any fish crazy

enough to try to live in it. By using the logarithm scale, this mine-drainage water 
would be 100,000 times more acidic than neutral water—so stay out of abandoned 
mines.
Solids
Natural water can contain a number of solid substances (what we may call impu­
rities) or constituents. The concentrations of various solid substances in water in 
dissolved, colloidal or suspended form are typically low but vary considerably. A 
hardness value of up to 400 ppm of calcium carbonate, for example, is sometimes 
tolerated in public supplies, whereas 1 ppm of dissolved iron would be unacceptable. 
When a particular solid constituent can affect the good health of the water user or the 
environment, it is called a contaminant or pollutant. These solid contaminants and/
or pollutants are considered to be conventional pollutants.
Other than gases, all contaminants of water contribute to the solid content. 
Natural water carries many dissolved and undissolved solids; these are considered 
to be conventional pollutants. The undissolved solids are non-polar substances and 
consist of relatively large particles of materials such as silt, that will not dissolve. 
Classified by their size and state, by their chemical characteristics and their size 
distribution, solids can be dispersed in water in both suspended and dissolved forms.
Size of solids in water can be classified as suspended solids, settleable, colloi­
dal or dissolved. Total solids are those suspended and dissolved solids that remain 
behind when the water is removed by evaporation. Solids are also characterized as 
being volatile or nonvolatile.
The distribution of solids is determined by computing the percentage of filterable 
solids by size range. Solids typically include inorganic solids such as silt and clay 
from riverbanks and organic matter such as plant fibers and microorganisms from 
natural or human-made sources.
Suspended solids are physical pollutants, and may consist of inorganic or organic 
particles, or of immiscible liquids. Inorganic solids such as clay, silt and other soil 
constituents are common in surface water. Organic materials—plant fibers and bio­
logical solids—are also common constituents of surface waters. These materials are 
often natural contaminants resulting from the erosive action of water flowing over 
surfaces. Fine particles from soil runoff can remain suspended in water and increase 
its turbidity or cloudiness. This can stunt the growth of aquatic plants by limiting the 
amount of sunlight reaching them. Effluents from wastewater treatment plants, from 
industrial plants, and runoff from forestry and agricultural operations are sources of 
DID YOU KNOW?
Sea water is slightly more basic (the pH value is higher) than most natural 
fresh water. Neutral water (such as distilled water) has a pH of 7, which is in 
the middle of being acidic and alkaline. Seawater happens to be slightly alka­
line (basic), with a pH of about 8. Most natural water has a pH range of 6–8, 
although acid rain can have a pH as low as 4.

62
The Science of Ocean Pollution
suspended solids. Note that because of the filtering capacity of the soil, suspended 
solids are seldom a constituent of groundwater.
Colloidal solids are extremely fine suspended solids (particles) of less than one 
micron in diameter; they are so small (though they still make water cloudy) that they 
will not settle even if allowed to sit quietly for days or weeks.
Solids in water affect how clear it is. Water’s clarity, its turbidity, is one of the 
first characteristics people notice. Turbidity in water is caused by the presence of 
suspended matter, which results in the scattering and absorption of light rays. The 
greater the amount of total suspended solids (TSS) in the water, the murkier it 
appears and the higher the measured turbidity. Thus, in plain English, turbidity is a 
measure of the light-transmitting properties of water. Natural water that is very clear 
(low turbidity) allows you to see images at considerable depths. As mentioned, high 
turbidity water, on the other hand, appears cloudy. Keep in mind that water of low 
turbidity is not necessarily without dissolved solids. Dissolved solids do not cause 
light to be scattered or absorbed, and thus, the water looks clear. High turbidity 
causes problems for the waterworks operator—components that cause high turbidity 
can cause taste and odor problems and will reduce the effectiveness of disinfection.
Color in water can be caused by a number of solids (contaminants) such as iron, 
which changes in the presence of oxygen to yellow or red sediments. The color of 
water can be deceiving. In the first place, color is considered an aesthetic quality 
of water with no direct health impact. Secondly, many of the colors associated with 
water are not true colors, but the result of colloidal suspension (apparent color). This 
apparent color can often be attributed to iron and to dissolved tannin extracted from 
decaying plant material. True color is the result of dissolved chemicals (most often 
organics) that cannot be seen. True color is distinguished form apparent color by 
filtering the sample.
Fats, Oil and Grease (FOG)
Fats, oil and grease (FOG) are household wastes (conventional pollutants) that are 
routinely disposed of improperly down kitchen drains or flushed down toilets. Putting 
these greasy materials down a sink can lead to sewer clogs, and the clogs can lead to 
wastewater backing up into a home or business, spilling out onto the streets, and even 
its way into storm drains and to the beaches.
Oil spills in or near surface water bodies that eventually reach the water body can 
have a devastating effect on fish, other aquatic organisms, and birds and mammals. 
Note that spills are not the only source of oil in water: oil leaking from automobiles 
and other vehicles or released during accidents is washed off roads with rainwater 
DID YOU KNOW?
Homemakers should mix fats, oils and grease with absorbent waste such as 
paper towels, kitty litter, coffee grounds or shredded newspaper before dis­
carding in the trash.

63

and into water bodies. Improper disposal of used oil from vehicles is another source; 
motor and other recreational boats release unburned fuel into water bodies.
Pathogenic Organisms
From the perspective of human use and consumption, the biggest concern associated 
with microorganisms is infectious disease. Microorganisms are naturally found in 
water (and elsewhere in the environment) and can cause infections. However, organ­
isms that are not native to aquatic systems are of greatest concern—native or not, 
they can be transported by natural water systems. These organisms usually require 
an animal host for growth and reproduction. Nonpoint sources of these microorgan­
isms include runoff from livestock operations and stormwater runoff. Point sources 
include improperly operating sewage treatment plants. When the surface water body 
functions to provide drinking water to a community, the threat of infectious micro­
organism contamination is very real and may be life-threatening. Those people who 
live in industrial nations with generally safe water supplies think of pathogenic con­
tamination as a third-world problem. However, several problems in industrial nations 
(Sydney, Australia’s local water supply, for example, had serious problems over the 
summer of 1998) have alerted us to the very real possibility of dangerous contamina­
tion in our own water supplies.
Other pathogenic contamination problems in water and humans have mani­
fested themselves via certain waterborne protozoans; certain types can cause dis­
ease. Of particular interest to the water pollution practitioner are the Entamoeba 
histolytica (amebic dysentery and amebic hepatitis), Giardia lamblia (Giardiasis), 
Cryptosporidium (Cryptosporidiosis) and the emerging Cyclospora (cyclosporo­
sis). Sewage contamination transports eggs, cysts and oocysts of parasitic protozoa 
and helminths (tapeworms, hookworms, etc.) into raw water supplies, leaving water 
treatment (in particular filtration) and disinfection as the means by which to dimin­
ish the danger of contaminated water for the consumer.
To prevent the occurrence of Giardia and Cryptosporidium spp. in surface water 
supplies, and to address increasing problems with waterborne diseases, USEPA 
implemented its Surface Water Treatment Rule (SWTR) in 1989. The rule requires 
both filtration and disinfection of all surface water supplies as a means of primarily 
controlling Giardia spp. and enteric viruses. Since implementation of its Surface 
Water Treatment Rule, USEPA has also recognized that Cryptosporidium spp. is an 
agent of waterborne disease. In 1996, in its next series of surface water regulations, 
the USEPA included Cryptosporidium.
To test the need for and the effectiveness of USEPA’s Surface Water Treatment 
Rule, LeChevallier et al. conducted a study on the occurrence and distribution of 
Giardia and Cryptosporidium organisms in raw water supplies to 66 surface water 
filter plants. These plants were located in 14 states and one Canadian province. A 
combined immunofluorescence test indicated that cysts and oocysts were widely dis­
persed in the aquatic environment. Giardia spp. was detected in more than 80% 
of the samples. Cryptosporidium spp. was found in 85% of the sample locations. 
Considering several variables, Giardia or Cryptosporidium spp. was detected in 
97% of the raw water samples. After evaluating their data, the researchers concluded 

64
The Science of Ocean Pollution
that the Surface Water Treatment Rule might have to be upgraded (subsequently, it 
has been) to require additional treatment (LeChevallier, Norton, & Lee, 1991).
Giardia
Giardia (gee-ar-dee-ah) lamblia (also known as hiker’/traveler’s scourge or dis­
ease) is a microscopic parasite that can infect warm-blooded animals and humans. 
Although Giardia was discovered in the 19th century, not until 1981 did the World 
Health Organization (WHO) classify Giardia as a pathogen. An outer shell called 
a cyst that allows it to survive outside the body for long periods protects giardia. 
If viable cysts are ingested, Giardia can cause the illness known as Giardiasis, an 
intestinal illness that can cause nausea, anorexia, fever and severe diarrhea.
In the United States, Giardia is the most commonly identified pathogen in water­
borne disease outbreaks. Contamination of a water supply by Giardia can occur in 
two ways: (1) by the activity of animals in the watershed area of the water supply; or 
(2) by the introduction of sewage into the water supply. Wild and domestic animals 
are major contributors in contaminating water supplies. Studies have also shown 
that, unlike many other pathogens, Giardia is not host-specific. In short, Giardia 
cysts excreted by animals can infect and cause illness in humans. Additionally, in 
several major outbreaks of waterborne diseases, the Giardia cyst source was sewage-
contaminated water supplies.
Treating the water supply, however, can effectively control waterborne Giardia. 
Chlorine and ozone are examples of two disinfectants known to effectively kill 
Giardia cysts. Filtration of the water can also effectively trap and remove the par­
asite from the water supply. The combination of disinfection and filtration is the 
most effective water treatment process available today for prevention of Giardia 
contamination.
In drinking water, Giardia is regulated under the Surface Water Treatment 
Rule (SWTR). Although the SWTR does not establish a Maximum Contaminant 
Level (MCL) for Giardia, it does specify treatment requirements to achieve at least 
99.9% (3-log) removal and/or inactivation of Giardia. This regulation requires that 
all drinking water systems using surface water or groundwater under the influence 
of surface water must disinfect and filter the water. The Enhanced Surface Water 
Treatment Rule (ESWTR), which includes Cryptosporidium and further regulates 
Giardia, was established in December 1996.
Giardiasis
During the past 15 years, Giardiasis has been recognized as one of the most frequently 
occurring waterborne diseases in the United States. Giardia lamblia cysts have been discov­
ered in the United States in places as far apart as Estes Park, Colorado (near the Continental 
Divide); Missoula, Montana; Wilkes-Barre, Scranton and Hazleton, Pennsylvania; and 
Pittsfield and Lawrence, Massachusetts, just to name a few (CDC, 1995).
Giardiasis is characterized by intestinal symptoms that usually last one week or 
more and may be accompanied by one or more of the following: diarrhea, abdominal 
cramps, bloating, flatulence, fatigue and weight loss. Although vomiting and fever 
are commonly listed as relatively frequent symptoms, people involved in waterborne 
outbreaks in the United States have not commonly reported them.

65
The Floating Sewer Sea
While most Giardia infections persist only for one or two months, some people 
undergo a more chronic phase, which can follow the acute phase or may become 
manifest without an antecedent acute illness. Loose stools and increased abdomi­
nal gassiness with cramping, flatulence and burping characterize the chronic phase. 
Fever is not common, but malaise, fatigue and depression may ensue (Weller, 1985). 
For a small number of people, the persistence of infection is associated with the 
development of marked malabsorption and weight loss. Similarly, lactose (milk) 
intolerance can be a problem for some people. This can develop coincidentally with 
the infection or be aggravated by it, causing an increase in intestinal symptoms after 
ingestion of milk products.
Some people may have several of these symptoms without evidence of diarrhea or 
have only sporadic episodes of diarrhea every three or four days. Still others may not 
have any symptoms at all. Therefore, the problem may not be whether you are 
infected with the parasite or not, but how harmoniously you both can live together or 
how to get rid of the parasite (either spontaneously or by treatment) when the har­
mony does not exist or is lost.
Giardiasis occurs worldwide. In the United States, Giardia is the parasite most 
commonly identified in stool specimens submitted to state laboratories for parasi­
tologic examination. During a three-year period, approximately 4% of one million 
stool specimens submitted to state laboratories tested positive for Giardia (CDC, 
1979). Other surveys have demonstrated Giardia prevalence rates ranging from 1 to 
20%, depending on the location and ages of persons studied. Giardiasis ranks among 
the top 20 infectious diseases that cause the greatest morbidity in Africa, Asia and 
Latin America; it has been estimated that about two million infections occur per year 
in these regions (Walsh, 1981; Walsh & Warren, 1979). People who are at highest risk 
for acquiring Giardia infection in the United States may be placed into five major 
categories:
1.	People in cities whose drinking water originates from streams or rivers, and 
whose water treatment process does not include filtration, or where filtra­
tion is ineffective because of malfunctioning equipment
2.	Hikers/campers/outdoor people
3.	International travelers
4.	Children who attend day-care centers, day-care center staff, and parents 
and siblings of children infected in day-care centers.
5.	Gay men
DID YOU KNOW?
Three prescription drugs are available in the United States to treat giardiasis: 
quinacrine, metronidazole and furazolidone. In a recent review of drug trials 
in which the efficacies of these drugs were compared, quinacrine produced 
a cure in 93% of patients, metronidazole cured 92% and furazolidone cured 
about 84% of patients (Davidson, 1984).

66
The Science of Ocean Pollution
People in categories 1, 2 and 3 have in common the same general source of 
infection, i.e., they acquire Giardia from fecally contaminated drinking water. The 
city resident usually becomes infected because the municipal water treatment pro­
cess does not include the filter necessary to physically remove the parasite from 
the water. The number of people in the United States at risk (i.e., the number who 
receive municipal drinking water from unfiltered surface water) is estimated to be 
20 million. International travelers may also acquire the parasite from improperly 
treated municipal waters in cities or villages in other parts of the world, particu­
larly in developing countries. In Eurasia, only travelers to Leningrad appear to be 
at increased risk. In prospective studies, 88% of US and 35% of Finnish travelers 
to Leningrad who had negative stool tests for Giardia on departure to the Soviet 
Union developed symptoms of giardiasis and had positive test for Giardia after they 
returned home (Brodsky, Spencer, & Schultz, 1974; Jokipii & Jokippii, 1974). With 
the exception of visitors to Leningrad, however, Giardia has not been implicated as a 
major cause of traveler’s diarrhea—it has been detected in fewer than 2% of travelers 
who develop diarrhea. However, hikers and campers risk infection every time they 
drink untreated raw water from a stream or river.
Persons in categories 4 and 5 become exposed through more direct contact with 
feces or an infected person: exposure to soiled of an infected child (day-care center-
associated cases), or through direct or indirect anal-oral sexual practices in the case 
of gay men.
Although community waterborne outbreaks of giardiasis have received the great­
est publicity in the United States during the past decade, about half of the Giardia 
cases discussed with the staff of the Centers for Disease Control over a three-year 
period had a day-care exposure as the most likely source of infection. Numerous out­
breaks of Giardia in day-care centers have been reported in recent years. Infection 
rates for children in day-care center outbreaks range from 21 to 44% in the United 
States and from 8 to 27% in Canada (Black et al., 1981; Pickering et al., 1984). The 
highest infection rates are usually observed in children who wear diapers (one to 
three years of age).
Local health officials and managers or water utility companies need to realize 
that sources of Giardia infection other than municipal drinking water exist. Armed 
with this knowledge, they are less likely to make a quick (and sometimes wrong) 
assumption that a cluster of recently diagnosed cases in a city is related to municipal 
drinking water. Of course, drinking water must not be ruled out as a source of infec­
tion when a larger than expected number of cases is recognized in a community, but 
the possibility that the cases are associated with a day-care center outbreak, drinking 
untreated stream water or international travel should also be entertained.
To understand the finer aspects of Giardia transmission and strategies for control, 
the drinking water practitioner must become familiar with several aspects of the 
parasite’s biology. Two forms of the parasite exist: a trophozoite and a cyst, both of 
which are much larger than bacteria. Trophozoites live in the upper small intestine 
where they attach to the intestinal wall by means of a disc-shaped suction pad on 
their ventral surface. Trophozoites actively feed and reproduce at this location. At 
some time during the trophozoite life, it releases its hold on the bowel wall and floats 
in the fecal stream through the intestine. As it makes this journey, it undergoes a 

67
The Floating Sewer Sea
morphologic transformation into an egg like structure called a cyst. The cyst (about 
6–9 nm in diameter × 8–12 μm—1/100 mm—in length) has a thick exterior wall 
that protects the parasite against the harsh elements that it will encounter outside the 
body. This cyst form of parasite is infectious to other people or animals. Most people 
become infected either directly (by hand-to-mouth transfer of cysts from the feces 
of an infected individual) or indirectly (by drinking feces-contaminated water). Less 
common modes of transmission included ingestion of fecally contaminated food and 
hand-to-mouth transfer of cysts after touching a fecally contaminated surface. After 
the cyst is swallowed, the trophozoite is liberated through the action of stomach acid 
and digestive enzymes and becomes established in the small intestine.
Although infection after ingestion of only one Giardia cyst is theoretically pos­
sible, the minimum number of cysts shown to infect a human under experimental 
conditions is ten (Rendtorff, 1954). Trophozoites divide by binary fission about every 
12 hours. What this means in practical terms is that if a person swallowed only a 
single cyst, reproduction at this rate would result in more than one million parasites 
10 days later, and one billion parasites by day 15.
The exact mechanism by which Giardia causes illness is not yet well understood 
but is not necessarily related to the number of organisms present. Nearly all of the 
symptoms, however, are related to dysfunction of the gastrointestinal tract. The para­
site rarely invades other parts of the body, such as the gall bladder or pancreatic 
ducts. Intestinal infection does not result in permanent damage.
Data reported by the CDC indicate that Giardia is the most frequently identified 
cause of diarrheal outbreaks associated with drinking water in the United States. 
The remainder of this section is devoted specifically to waterborne transmissions of 
Giardia. Giardia cysts have been detected in 16% of potable water supplies (lakes, 
reservoirs, rivers, springs, groundwater) in the United States at an average concen­
tration of three cysts per 100 L (Rose, Gerba, & Jakubowski, 1991). Waterborne 
epidemics of giardiasis are a relatively frequent occurrence. In 1983, for example, 
Giardia was identified as the cause of diarrhea in 68% of waterborne outbreaks in 
which the causal agent was identified (CDC, 1984). From 1965 to 1982, more than 50 
waterborne outbreaks were reported (Craun, 1984). In 1984, about 250,000 people in 
Pennsylvania were advised to boil drinking water for six months because of Giardia-
contaminated water.
Many of the municipal waterborne outbreaks of Giardia have been subjected to 
intense study to determine their cause. Several general conclusions can be made 
from data obtained in those studies. Waterborne transmission of Giardia in the 
United States usually occurs in mountainous regions where community drinking 
water obtained from clear running streams is chlorinated but not filtered before 
distribution. Although mountain streams appear to be clean, fecal contamination 
upstream by human residents or visitors, as well as by Giardia-infected animals such

Giardia has an incubation period of 1–8 weeks.

68
The Science of Ocean Pollution
as beavers, has been well documented. Water obtained from deep wells is an unlikely 
source of Giardia because of the natural filtration of water as it percolates through 
the soil to reach underground cisterns. Well-waste sources that pose the greatest risk 
of fecal contamination are poorly constructed or improperly located ones. A few out­
breaks have occurred in towns that included filtration in the water treatment process, 
where the filtration was not effective in removing Giardia cysts because of defects in 
filter construction, poor maintenance of the filter media or inadequate pretreatment 
of the water before filtration. Occasional outbreaks have also occurred because of 
accidental cross-connections between water and sewage systems.
From these data, we conclude that two major ingredients are necessary for water­
borne outbreak. Giardia cysts must be present in untreated source water, and the 
water purification process must either fail to kill or to remove Giardia cysts from 
the water.
Though beavers are often blamed for contaminating water with Giardia cysts, that 
they are responsible for introducing the parasite into new areas seem unlikely. Far 
more likely is that they are also victims: Giardia cysts may be carried in untreated 
human sewage discharged into the water by small-town sewage disposal plants or 
originate from cabin toilets that drain directly into streams and rivers. Backpackers, 
campers and sports enthusiasts may also deposit Giardia-contaminated feces in the 
environment, which are subsequently washed into streams by rain. In support of this 
concept is a growing amount of data that indicate a higher Giardia infection rate in 
beavers living downstream from US National Forest campgrounds, compared with a 
near zero rate of infection in beavers living in more remote areas.
Although beavers may be unwitting victims of the Giardia story, they still 
play an important part in the contamination scheme, because they can (and prob­
ably do) serve as amplifying hosts. An amplifying host is one that is easy to 
infect, serves as a good habitat for the parasite to reproduce and, in the case of 
Giardia, returns millions of cysts to the water for every one ingested. Beavers are 
especially important in this regard because they tend to defecate in or very near 
the water, which ensures that most of the Giardia cysts excreted are returned to 
the water.
The microbial quality of water resources and the management of the microbi­
ally laden wastes generated by the burgeoning animal agriculture industry are criti­
cal local, regional and national problems. Animal wastes from cattle, hogs, sheep, 
horses, poultry and other livestock and commercial animals can contain high con­
centrations of microorganism, such as Giardia, that are pathogenic to humans.
The contribution of other animals to waterborne outbreaks of Giardia is less 
clear. Muskrats (another semiaquatic animal) have been found in several parts of the 
United States to have high infection rates (30–40%) (Frost, Plan, & Liechty, 1984). 
Recent studies have shown that muskrats can be infected with Giardia cysts from 
humans and beavers. Occasional Giardia infections have been reported in coyotes, 
deer, elk, cattle, dogs and cats (but not in horses and sheep) encountered in moun­
tainous regions of the United States. Naturally occurring Giardia infections have 
not been found in most other wild animals (bear, nutria, rabbit, squirrel, badger, 
marmot, skunk, ferret, porcupine, mink, raccoon, river otter, bobcat, lynx, moose, 
bighorn sheep).

Scientific knowledge about what is required to kill or remove Giardia cysts from 
a contaminated water supply has increased considerably. For example, we know that 
cysts can survive in cold water (4°C) for at least two months, and they are killed 
instantaneously by boiling water (100°C) (Bingham et al., 1979). We do not know 
how long the cysts will remain viable at other water temperatures (e.g., at 0°C or in a 
canteen at 15–20°C), nor do we know how long the parasite will survive on various 
environment surfaces, e.g., under a pine tree, in the sun, on a diaper-changing ` 
or in carpets in a day-care center.
The effect of chemical disinfection (chlorination, for example) on the viability of 
Giardia cysts is an even more complex issue. The number of waterborne outbreaks 
of Giardia that have occurred in communities where chlorination was employed 
as a disinfectant process demonstrates that the amount of chlorine used routinely 
for municipal water treatment is not effective against Giardia cysts. These observa-
tions have been confirmed in the laboratory under experimental conditions (Jarroll, 
Bingham, & Meyer, 1979; Jarroll, Bingham, & Meyer, 1980). This does not mean 
that chlorine does not work at all. It does work under certain favorable conditions. 
Without getting too technical, gaining some appreciation of the problem can be 
achieved by understanding a few of the variables that influence the efficacy of chlo-
rine as a disinfectant.
1.	 Water pH: at pH values above 7.5, the disinfectant capability of chlorine
is greatly reduced.
2.	 Water temperature: the warmer the water, the higher the efficacy. Chlorine 
does not work in ice-cold water from mountain streams.
3.	 Organic content of the water: mud, decayed vegetation or other sus­
pended organic debris in water chemically combines with chlorine, making
it unavailable as a disinfectant.
4.	 Chlorine contact time: the longer Giardia cysts are exposed to chlorine,
the more likely the chemical will kill them.
5.	 Chlorine concentration: the higher the chlorine concentration, the more
likely chlorine will kill Giardia cysts. Most water treatment facilities try
to add enough chlorine to give a free (unbound) chlorine residual at the
customer tap of 0.5 mg per liter of water.
The five variables above are so closely interrelated that improving another can 
often compensate for an unfavorable occurrence in one. For example, if chlorine 
efficacy is expected to be low because water is obtained from an icy stream, the 
chlorine contact time, chlorine concentration or both could be increased. In the case 
of Giardia-contaminated water, producing safe drinking water with a chlorine con­
centration of 1 mg per liter and contact time as short as 10 minutes might be pos­
sible—if all the other variables were optimal (i.e., pH of 7.0, water temperature of 
25°C and a total organic content of the water close to zero). On the other hand, if
all of these variables were unfavorable (i.e., pH of 7.9, water temperature of 5°C and
high organic content), chlorine concentrations in excess of 8 mg per liter with several 
hours of contact time may not be consistently effective. Because water conditions 
and water treatment plant operations (especially those related to water retention time, 

70
The Science of Ocean Pollution
and, therefore, to chlorine contact time) vary considerably in different parts of the 
United States, neither the USEPA nor the CDC has been able to identify a chlorine 
concentration that would be safe yet effective against Giardia cysts under all water 
conditions. Therefore, chlorine as a preventive measure against waterborne giardia­
sis generally has been used under outbreak conditions when the amount of chlorine 
and contact time have been tailored to fit specific water conditions and the existing 
operational design of the water utility.
In an outbreak, for example, the local health department and water utility may 
issue an advisory to boil water, may increase the chlorine residual at the consumer’s 
tap from 0.5 mg/L to 1 or 2 mg/L and, if the physical layout and operation of the 
water treatment facility permit, increase the chlorine contact time. These are emer­
gency procedures intended to reduce the risk of transmission until a filtration device 
can be installed or repaired or until an alternative source of safe water (a well, for 
example) can be made operational.
The long-term solution to the problem of municipal waterborne outbreaks of giar­
diasis involves improvements in and more widespread use of filters in the municipal 
water treatment process. The sand filters most commonly used in municipal water treat­
ment today cost millions of dollars to install, which makes them unattractive for many 
small communities. The pore sizes in these filters are not sufficiently small to remove 
a Giardia (6–9 μm × 8–12 μm). For the sand filter to remove Giardia cysts from the 
water effectively, the water must receive some additional treatment before it reaches the 
filter. The flow of water through the filter bed must also be carefully regulated.
An ideal prefilter treatment for muddy water would include sedimentation (a hold­
ing pond where large, suspended particles are allowed to settle out by the action of 
gravity) followed by flocculation or coagulation (the addition of chemicals such as 
alum or ammonium to cause microscopic particles to clump together). The sand 
filter easily removes the large particles resulting from the flocculation/coagulation 
process, including Giardia cysts bound to other microparticulates. Chlorine is then 
added to kill the bacteria and viruses that may escape the filtration process. If the 
water comes from a relatively clear source, chlorine may be added to the water before 
it reaches the filter.
The successful operation of a complete waterworks operation is a complex pro­
cess that requires considerable training. Troubleshooting breakdowns or recognizing 
the potential problems in the system before they occur often requires the skills of 
an engineer. Unfortunately, most small water utilities with water treatment facilities 
that include filtration cannot afford the services of a full-time engineer. Filter opera­
tion or maintenance problems in such systems may not be detected until a Giardia 
outbreak is recognized in the community. The bottom line is that although filtration 
is the best that water treatment technology has to offer for municipal water systems 
against waterborne giardiasis, it is not infallible. For municipal water filtration facili­
ties to work properly, they must be properly constructed, operated and maintained.
Whenever possible, persons in the out-of-doors should carry drinking water of 
known purity with them. When this is not practical, when water from streams, lakes, 
ponds and other outdoor sources must be used, time should be taken to properly 
disinfect the water before drinking it.

Cryptosporidium
Ernest E. Tyzzer first described the protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium in 1907. 
Tyzzer frequently found a parasite in the gastric glands of laboratory mice. Tyzzer 
identified the parasite as a sporozoan, but of uncertain taxonomic status; he named 
it Cryptosporidium muris. Later, in 1910, after more detailed study, he proposed 
Cryptosporidium as a new genus and C. muris as the type of species. Amazingly, 
except for developmental stages, Tyzzer’s original description of the life cycle was 
later confirmed by electron microscopy. Later, in 1912, Tyzzer described a new spe­
cies, Cryptosporidium parvum (Tyzzer, 1912).
For almost 50 years, Tyzzer’s discovery of the genus Cryptosporidium (because 
it appeared to be of no medical or economic importance) remained (like himself) 
relatively obscure. However, slight rumblings of the genus’ importance were felt in 
the medical community when Slavin wrote about a new species, Cryptosporidium 
meleagridis, associated with illness and death in turkeys (Tyzzer, 1912). Interest 
remained slight even when Cryptosporidium was found to be associated with bovine 
diarrhea (Panciera, Thomassen, & Garner, 1971).
Not until 1982 did worldwide interest focus in on the study of organisms in the 
genus Cryptosporidium. During this period, the medical community and other 
interested parties were beginning to attempt a full-scale, frantic effort to find out as 
much as possible about Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). The CDC 
reported that 21 AIDS-infected males from six large cities in the United States had 
severe protracted diarrhea caused by Cryptosporidium.
However, 1993 was when the “bug—the pernicious parasite Cryptosporidium—
made [itself and] Milwaukee famous (Mayo Foundation, 1996).”
Note: The Cryptosporidium outbreak in Milwaukee caused the deaths of 
100 people—the largest episode of waterborne disease in the United States in the 
70 years since health officials began tracking such outbreaks.
Today, we know that the massive waterborne outbreak in Milwaukee (more than 
400,000 persons developed acute and often prolonged diarrhea or other gastrointes­
tinal symptoms) increased in interest in Cryptosporidium at an exponential level. 
The Milwaukee Incident spurred both public interest and the interest of public health 
agencies, agricultural agencies and groups, environmental agencies and groups, and 
suppliers of drinking water. This increase in interest level and concern has spurred 
on new studies of Cryptosporidium with emphasis on developing methods for recov­
ery, detection, prevention and treatment (Fayer, Speer, & Dubey, 1997).
The USEPA has become particularly interested in this “new” pathogen. For 
example, in the reexamination of regulations on water treatment and disinfection, 
the USEPA issued MCLG and CCL for Cryptosporidium. The similarity to Giardia 
lamblia and the necessity to provide an efficient conventional water treatment capa­
ble of eliminating viruses at the same time forced the USEPA to regulate the sur­
face water supplies in particular. The proposed “Enhanced Surface Water Treatment 
Rule” (ESWTR) included regulations from watershed protection to specialized oper­
ation of treatment plants (certification of operators and state overview) and effective 
chlorination. Protection against Cryptosporidium included control of waterborne 
pathogens such as Giardia and viruses (DeZuane, 1997).

The Basics of Cryptosporidium
Cryptosporidium (crip-toe-spor-ID-ee-um) is one of several single-celled protozoan 
genera in the phylum Apicomplexa (all referred to as coccidian). Cryptosporidium 
along with other genera in the phylum Apicomplexa develops in the gastrointes­
tinal tract of vertebrates through all of their life cycle—in short, they live in the 
intestines of animals and people. This microscopic pathogen causes a disease called 
Cryptosporidiosis (crip-toe-spor-id-ee-O-sis).
The dormant (inactive) form of Cryptosporidium called an oocyst (O-O-sist) 
is excreted in the feces (stool) of infected humans and animals. The tough-walled 
oocysts survive under a wide range of environmental conditions.
Several species of Cryptosporidium were incorrectly named after the host in 
which they were found; subsequent studies have invalidated many species. Now, 
eight valid species of Cryptosporidium (see Table 7.1) have been named.
Upton reports that C. muris infects the gastric glands of laboratory rodents and 
several other mammalian species, but (even though several texts state otherwise) is 
not known to infect humans. However, C. parvum infects the small intestine of an 
unusually wide range of mammals, including humans, and is the zoonotic species 
responsible for human Cryptosporidiosis. In most mammals, C. parvum is predomi­
nately a parasite of neonate (newborn) animals. He points out that even though excep­
tions occur, older animals generally develop poor infections, even when unexposed 
previously to the parasite. Humans are the one host that can be seriously infected at 
any time in their lives, and only previous exposure to the parasite results in either full 
or partial immunity to challenge infections.
Oocysts are present in most surface bodies of water across the United States, 
many of which supply public drinking water. Oocysts are more prevalent in surface 
waters when heavy rains increase runoff of wild and domestic animal wastes from 
the land, or when sewage treatment plants are overloaded or break down.

The Floating Sewer Sea
Only laboratories with specialized capabilities can detect the presence of 
Cryptosporidium oocysts in water. Unfortunately, present sampling and detection 
methods are unreliable. Recovering oocysts trapped on the material used to filter 
water samples is difficult. Once a sample is obtained, however, determining whether 
the oocyst is alive or whether it is the species C. parvum that can infect humans is 
easily accomplished by looking at the sample under a microscope.
The number of oocysts detected in raw (untreated) water varies with location, 
sampling time and laboratory methods. Water treatment plants remove most, but not 
always all, oocysts. Low numbers of oocysts are sufficient to cause Cryptosporidiosis, 
but the low numbers of oocysts sometimes present in drinking water are not consid­
ered cause for alarm in the public.
Protecting water supplies from Cryptosporidium demands multiple barriers. 
Why? Because Cryptosporidium oocysts have tough walls that can withstand many 
environmental stresses and are resistant to the chemical disinfectants such as chlo­
rine that are traditionally used in municipal drinking water systems.
Physical removal of particles, including oocysts, from water by filtration is an 
important step in the water treatment process. Typically, water pumped from riv­
ers or lakes into a treatment plant is mixed with coagulants, which help settle out 
particles suspended in the water. If sand filtration is used, even more particles are 
removed. Finally, the clarified water is disinfected and piped to customers. Filtration 
is the only conventional method now in use in the United States for controlling 
Cryptosporidium.
Ozone is a strong disinfectant that kills protozoa if sufficient doses and contact 
times are used, but ozone leaves no residual for killing microorganisms in the 
distribution system, as does chlorine. The high costs of new filtration or ozone 
treatment plants must be weighed against the benefits of additional treatment. Even 
well-operated water treatment plants cannot ensure that drinking water will be 
completely free of Cryptosporidium oocysts. Water treatment methods alone can­
not solve the problem; watershed protection and monitoring of water quality are 
critical. For example, land use controls such as septic system regulations and best 
management practices to control runoff can help keep human and animal wastes 
out of water.
Under the Surface Water Treatment Rule of 1989, public water systems must filter 
surface water sources unless water quality and disinfection requirements are met, 
and a watershed control program is maintained. This rule, however, did not address 
Cryptosporidium. The USEPA has now set standards for turbidity (cloudiness) and 
coliform bacteria (which indicate that pathogens are probably present) in drinking 
water. Frequent monitoring must occur to provide officials with early warning of 
potential problems to enable them to take steps to protect public health. Unfortunately, 
no water quality indicators can reliably predict the occurrence of Cryptosporidiosis. 
More accurate and rapid assays of oocysts will make it possible to notify residents 
promptly if their water supply is contaminated with Cryptosporidium and thus avert 
outbreaks.
The bottom line: The collaborative efforts of water utilities, government agen­
cies, health care providers and individuals are needed to prevent outbreaks of 
Cryptosporidiosis.

The Science of Ocean Pollution
Cryptosporidiosis
Denis D. Juranek (1995) from the Centers for Disease Control has written in Clinical 
Infectious Diseases:
Cryptosporidium parvum is an important emerging pathogen in the U.S. and a cause 
of severe, life-threatening disease in patients with AIDS. No safe and effective form 
of specific treatment for Cryptosporidiosis has been identified to date. The parasite 
is transmitted by ingestion of oocysts excreted in the feces of infected humans or 
animals. The infection can therefore be transmitted from person-to-person, through 
ingestion of contaminated water (drinking water and water used for recreational 
purposes) or food, from animal to person, or by contact with fecally contaminated 
environmental surfaces. Outbreaks associated with all of these modes of transmis­
sion have been documented. Patients with human immunodeficiency virus infec­
tion should be made more aware of the many ways that Cryptosporidium species 
are transmitted, and they should be given guidance on how to reduce their risk of 
exposure.
The CDC points out that since the Milwaukee outbreak, concern about the safety 
of drinking water in the United States has increased, and new attention has been 
focused on determining and reducing the risk of Cryptosporidiosis from community 
and municipal water supplies.
Cryptosporidiosis is spread by putting something in the mouth that has been con­
taminated with the stool of an infected person or animal. In this way, people swal­
low the Cryptosporidium parasite. As previously mentioned, a person can become 
infected by drinking contaminated water or eating raw or undercooked food contam­
inated with Cryptosporidium oocysts; direct contact with the droppings of infected 
animals or stools of infected humans; or hand-to-mouth transfer of oocysts from 
surfaces that may have become contaminated with microscopic amounts of stool 
from an infected person or animal.
The symptoms may appear two to ten days after infection by the parasite. 
Although some persons may not have symptoms, others have watery diarrhea, head­
ache, abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting and low-grade fever. These symptoms 
may lead to weight loss and dehydration.
In otherwise healthy persons, these symptoms usually last one to two weeks, at 
which time the immune system is able to stop the infection. In persons with sup­
pressed immune systems, such as persons who have AIDS or who recently have 
had an organ or bone marrow transplant, the infection may continue and become 
life-threatening.
Now, no safe and effective cure for Cryptosporidiosis exists. People with normal 
immune systems improve without taking antibiotic or antiparasitic medications. The 
treatment recommend for this diarrheal illness is to drink plenty of fluids and to get 
extra rest. Physicians may prescribe medication to slow the diarrhea during recovery.
The best way to prevent Cryptosporidiosis is
•	 Avoid water or food that may be contaminated.
•	 Wash hands after using the bathroom before handling food.

75
The Floating Sewer Sea
•	 If you work in a childcare center where you change diapers, be sure to wash 
your hands thoroughly with plenty of soap and warm water after every dia­
per change, even if you wear gloves.
During community-wide outbreaks caused by contaminated drinking water, 
drinking water practitioners should inform the public to boil drinking water for one 
minute to kill the Cryptosporidium parasite.
Cyclospora
Cyclospora organisms, which until recently were considered blue-green algae, 
were discovered at the turn of the century. The first human cases of Cyclospora 
infection were reported in the 1970s. In the early 1980s, Cyclospora was rec­
ognized as pathogen in patients with AIDS. We now know that Cyclospora is 
endemic in many parts of the world and appears to be an important cause of trav­
eler’s diarrhea. Cyclospora are two to three times larger than Cryptosporidium, 
but otherwise have similar features. Cyclospora diarrheal illness in patients with 
healthy immune systems can be cured with a week of therapy with trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX).
So, exactly what is Cyclospora? In 1998, the CDC described Cyclospora cay­
etanensis as a unicellular parasite previously known as a cyanobacterium-like 
(blue-green algae-like) or coccidian-like body (CLB). The disease is known as cyclo­
sporiasis. Cyclospora infects the small intestine and causes an illness characterized 
by diarrhea with frequent stools. Other symptoms can include loss of appetite, bloat­
ing, gas, stomach cramps, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, muscle ache and fever. Some 
individuals infected with Cyclospora may not show symptoms. Since the first known 
cases of illness caused by Cyclospora infection were reported in the medical jour­
nals in the 1970s, cases have been reported with increased frequency from various 
countries since the mid-1980s (in part because of the availability of better techniques 
for detecting the parasite in stool specimens).
Huang et al. detailed what they believe is the first known outbreak of diarrheal ill­
ness associated with Cyclospora in the United States. The outbreak, which occurred 
in 1990, consisted of 21 cases of illness among physicians and others working at a 
Chicago hospital. Contaminated tap water from a physicians’ dormitory at the hos­
pital was the probable source of the organisms. The tap water probably picked up 
the organism while in a storage tank at the top of the dormitory after the failure of a 
water pump (Huang, Weber & Sosin, 1995).
The transmission of Cyclospora is not a straightforward process. When infected 
persons excrete the oocyst state of Cyclospora in their feces, the oocysts are not 
infectious and may require from days to weeks to become so (i.e., to sporulate). 
Therefore, transmission of Cyclospora directly from an infected person to someone 
else is unlikely. However, indirect transmission can occur if an infected person con­
taminates the environment and oocysts have sufficient time, under appropriate con­
ditions, to become infectious. For example, Cyclospora may be transmitted by 
ingestion of water or food contaminated with oocysts. Outbreaks linked to contami­
nated water, as well as outbreaks linked to various types of fresh produce, have been 
reported in recent years (Herwaldt et al., 1997). How common the various modes of 

76
The Science of Ocean Pollution
transmission and sources of infection are not yet known, nor is it known whether 
animals can be infected and serve as sources of infection for humans.
Persons of all ages are at risk for infection. Persons living or traveling in devel­
oping countries may be at increased risk, but infection can be acquired worldwide, 
including in the United States. In some countries of the world, infection appears to 
be seasonal.
Based on currently available information, avoiding water or food that may be 
contaminated with stool is the best way to prevent infection. Reinfection can occur.
Note: De Zuane (1997) points out that pathogenic parasites are not easily removed 
or eliminated by conventional treatment and disinfection unit processes. This is 
particularly true for Giardia lamblia, Cryptosporidium and Cyclospora. Filtration 
facilities can be adjusted in depth, prechlorination, filtration rate and backwashing to 
become more effective in the removal of cysts. The pretreatment of protected water­
shed raw water is a major factor in the elimination of pathogenic protozoa.
Toxic Pollutants
There are hundreds of potentially toxic water pollutants. Of these, USEPA, under the 
Clean Water Act, regulates more than 100 pollutants of special concern. These include 
arsenic and the metals mercury, lead, cadmium, nickel, copper and zinc. Organic toxic 
pollutants include benzene, toluene and many pesticides, herbicides and insecticides.
Nontoxic Pollutants
Nontoxic pollutants include chemicals such as chlorine, phenols, iron and ammonia. 
Color and heat are also nontoxic pollutants regulated under CWA. Pure water is 
colorless, but water in natural water systems is often colored by foreign substances. 
For example, many facilities discharge colored effluents into surface water systems. 
However, colored water is not aesthetically acceptable to the general public; thus, the 
intensity of the color that can be released is regulated by law. Heat or thermal non­
toxic pollution can cause problems, but is not ordinarily a serious pollutant, although 
in localized situations it can cause problems with temperature-sensitive organism 
populations.
CASE STUDY 7.3—RIVER CLEANUP
Volunteers for the biannual Conestoga River cleanup found everything from tires, 
washing machines, bicycles and motor scooters to candy wrappers and car engines 
in the river—several truckloads of trash. Low water levels enabled volunteers to

remove trash in the middle of the river, where in higher water seasons, it has been 
unreachable. They will sell the metal for scrap, and the Lancaster County Solid 
Waste Authority will waive the tipping fee for disposing of the rest of the illegally 
dumped trash.
Volunteers also planted bushes (donated by the Chesapeake Bay Foundation) 
on the stream banks, to serve the dual function of erosion and dumping preven­
tion. Organizers see signs that the river cleanup program is helping in several ways. 
More volunteers turn out each time for the cleanup, allowing the group to expand 
their coverage. They also feel the message is getting through to people that the river 
is not the place to dump their trash. The river gives up less trash each year. State 
Representative Mike Sturla hopes that people are beginning to understand that “this 
is not the place to put it.” (Lancaster New Era, 9/27/98).
Macroscopic Pollution
Macroscopic pollutants include large visible items (e.g., floatable, flotsam and jet­
sam, nurdles, marine debris and shipwrecks) contaminating or polluting surface 
water bodies (lakes, rivers, streams, oceans). In an urban stormwater context, these 
large visible items are termed floatable—waterborne litter and debris, including toi­
let paper, condoms and tampon applicators, plastic bags or six-packs rings and food 
cans, jugs, cigarette butts, yard waste, polystyrene foam, metal and glass beverage 
bottles, as well as oil and grease. Floatable come from street litter that ends up in 
storm drains (catch basins) and sewers. Floatable can be discharged into the sur­
rounding waters during certain storm events when water flow into treatment plants 
(i.e., those without overflow storage lagoons) exceeds treatment capacity. Floatable 
contribute to visual pollution, detract from the pleasure of outdoor experiences and 
pose a threat to wildlife and human health.
The terms flotsam and jetsam, as used currently, refer to any kind of marine 
debris. The two terms have different meanings: jetsam refers to materials jettisoned 
voluntarily (usually to lighten the load in an emergency) into the sea by the crew of 
a ship. Flotsam describes goods that are floating on the water without having been 
thrown in deliberately, often after a shipwreck.
A nurdle (strongly resembling a fish egg), also known as mermaids’ tears, pre-
production plastic pellet or plastic resin pellet, is a plastic pellet typically under 5 mm 
in diameter (see Figure 9.1) and is a major component of marine debris. It is esti­
mated that at least 60 billion pounds of nurdles are manufactured annually in the 
United States alone (Heal the Bay, 2009). Not only are they a significant source of 
ocean and beach pollution, but nurdles also frequently find their way into the diges­
tive tracts of various marine creatures.
In the past, the major source of marine debris was naturally occurring driftwood; 
humans have been discharging similar material into the oceans for thousands of 
years. In the modern era, however, the increasing use of plastic with its subsequent 
discharge by humans into waterways has resulted in plastic materials and/or prod­
ucts being the most prevalent form (as much 80%) of marine debris. Plastics are 
persistent water pollutants because they do not biodegrade as many other substances 
do. Not only is waterborne plastic unsightly but it also poses a serious threat to fish, 

78
The Science of Ocean Pollution
seabirds, marine reptiles and marine mammals, as well as to boats and costal habita­
tions (NOAA 2009).
A shipwreck refers to large derelict (abandoned and deserted at sea) ships. In 
addition to the navigational hazard that shipwrecks present, oil spillage, lubricants, 
greases, paint, heavy metals such as mercury and flotsam are also generally the 
result.
Note: Although PPCPs have been discussed earlier in the text, it is important to 
broaden the discussion about these pollutants mainly because they are hardly ever 
mentioned, discussed or thought about. I deliberately present more information on 
PPCPs because they slip through traditional wastewater treatment systems and end 
up in the floating seas.
PPCPs
According to the USEPA (2009), the acronym PPCPs was coined in the 1999 critical 
review published in Environmental Health Perspectives to refer to Pharmaceuticals 
and Personal Care Products. Sometimes termed “emerging pollutants,” it is impor­
tant to point out that PPCPs are not truly emerging; it is the understanding of the 
significance of their occurrence in the environment that is beginning to develop 
(USEPA 2005). PPCPs comprise a very broad, diverse collection of thousands of 
chemical substances, including prescription, veterinary and over the counter (OTC) 
therapeutic drugs, fragrances, cosmetics, sunscreen agents, diagnostic agents, nutra­
ceuticals (vitamins), biopharmaceuticals (medical drugs produced by biotechnol­
ogy), growth-enhancing chemicals used in livestock operations and many others.
This broad collection of substances refers, in general, to any product used by 
individuals for personal health or cosmetic reasons (e.g., anti-aging cleansers, toners, 
exfoliators, facial masks, serums and lip balm).
Sources of PPCPs include (USEPA 2005):
•	 human bathing, shaving and swimming
•	 illicit drugs
•	 veterinary drug use, especially antibiotics and steroids
•	 agribusiness
•	 residues from pharmaceutical manufacturing
•	 residues from hospitals
DID YOU KNOW?
It has been estimated that container ships lose over 10,000 containers at sea 
each year (usually during a storm; (Podsada, 2001). One famous spillage 
occurred in the Pacific Ocean in 1992, when thousands of rubber ducks and 
other toys went overboard during a storm. The toys have since been found all over 
the world; scientists have used the incident to gain a better understanding of 
ocean currents.

79
The Floating Sewer Sea
People contribute PPCPs to the environment when:
•	 medication residues pass out of the body and into sewer lines
•	 externally applied drugs and personal care products they use was down the 
shower drain
•	 unused or expired medications are placed in the trash
The problem with PPCPs is that we do not know what we do not know about 
them—the jury is still out on their exact environmental impact. Thus far, studies have 
shown that pharmaceuticals are preset in our nation’s waterbodies. Further research 
suggests that certain drugs may cause ecological harm. More research is needed to 
determine the extent of ecological harm and any role it may have in potential human 
health effects. To date, scientists have found no evidence of adverse human health 
effects from PPCPs in the environment.
Of the approximately three feet of water that falls each year on every square foot 
of Earth (on average—much of it in the oceans), approximately six inches returns to 
the sea. Evaporation takes another two feet. The last six inches infiltrates through 
earth’s interstices, voids, hollows and cavities, filtering into the sponge-like soil. In 
traveling down into and through the soil, the course that water follows may carry 
it only a few inches, a few feet or several hundred feet, before it joins the subterra­
nean water stores that comprise the Earth’s groundwater supply. This water supply 
(one people are often oblivious to) contains an estimated 1,700,000 cubic miles of 
water, hidden underground. Enough water, if you could spread over earth’s surface, 
to blanket all earth’s land surfaces with one thousand feet of water. US groundwater 
sources constitute a freshwater supply greater than all the surface water in the United 
States—and that is including the Great Lakes.
This enormous reservoir, our groundwater supply, feeds all the natural foun­
tains and springs of Earth. These natural exits to groundwater allow it to bubble up 
in cool, blue pools from springs. In more unusual circumstances, from places too 
deep within the earth to imagine, groundwater heats up, forms steam and bursts 
from the surface in geysers and hot springs. Though we make use of many different 
groundwater sources, not all groundwater supplies can be tapped for use. In some 
places, the water is not accessible, because of pumping costs and drilling difficulties. 
Groundwater supplies, too, are not always pure. Contaminated groundwater supplies 
have become a significant pollution problem.
However, most of the Earth’s groundwater supply lies within reach of the sur­
face, accessible by drilling a borehole or well down to the water table. Humans have 
obtained water this way for millennia, and as more and more people inhabit Earth, 
more use is made of our groundwater supplies. Currently, groundwater serves as a 
reliable source of potable water for millions of Earth’s inhabitants, and if used with 
moderation, groundwater should remain a viable source for years to come.
Groundwater Uses and Sources
The water we use, by population, breaks down to roughly 50% groundwater sources 
and 50% surface water sources. Large cities rely primarily on surface water for their 

80
The Science of Ocean Pollution
supplies, but 95% of small communities and rural areas use groundwater. A 
larger percent of the US population is supplied by surface water than by ground­
water, but only one-fourth of the total number of communities is supplied by 
surface water.
As a water supply source, groundwater has several desirable characteristics: 
(1) natural storage, eliminating the need for man-made impoundments; (2) usu­
ally available at point of demand, so transmission cost is reduced significantly; 
and (3) filtration through the natural geologic strata means groundwater usu­
ally appears clearer to the eye than surface water (McGhee, 1991). For these 
reasons, groundwater is generally preferred as a municipal and industrial water 
source.
For many years, we believed that groundwater was safe from contamination, nat­
urally cleansed by traveling through the soil. Groundwater was considered safe to 
drink, and many water utilities delivered it to their customers with no further treat­
ment. We know better now.
We have discovered that groundwater is not automatically safe to use as a potable 
water supply. Discoveries of contaminated groundwater have led to the closure of 
thousands of potable water wells across the United States. The USEPA reported that 
in the mid-1980s, more than 8000 drinking water wells in areas all over the nation 
were no longer usable because of contamination. Monitoring the complex ground­
water situation nationwide is fraught with difficulty, because of the vast number of 
potential and possible contamination sources, including contamination by toxic or 
hazardous materials leaking from waste treatment facilities, natural sources or land­
fills that may not be evident to either the public or regulatory agencies, as well as 
from many other sources. Groundwater contamination’s biggest problem is twofold: 
monitoring its condition is difficult, and when contaminated, restoring it is difficult 
(and expensive)—if possible at all.
Aquifers
An aquifer performs two important functions: storage and transport. Expressed sim­
ply, the subsurface is charged with the water that then becomes groundwater when 
surface water seeps down from the rain-soaked surface, and sinks until it reaches an 
impermeable layer, where it collects and fills all the pores and cracks of the perme­
able portions. The top of this saturated zone is called the water table,
Groundwater occurs in two different zones in unconfined aquifers (an aqui­
fer not overlain by an impermeable layer is unconfined). These zones are distin­
guished by whether or not water fills all the cracks and pores between particles of 
soil and rock. The unsaturated zone, which lies just beneath the land surface, is 
characterized by crevices that contain both air and water. While the unsaturated 
zone contains water (vadose water), this water is essentially unavailable for use. 
Water flow in a confined aquifer (a water-bearing layer sandwiched between two 
less permeable layers) is restricted to vertical movement only. An unconfined aqui­
fer allows water to flow with more freedom of movement and resembles flow in an 
open channel.

81
The Floating Sewer Sea
Groundwater Flow
To have any flow at all, a hydraulic gradient must exist, whether groundwater flow 
occurs in an unconfined aquifer’s open channel-like flow or a confined aquifer’s 
vertical-only (pipe-like) flow. The hydraulic gradient is the difference in hydraulic 
head divided by the distance along the fluid flow path. For our applications of the 
concept, you should know that groundwater moves through an aquifer in the direc­
tion of the hydraulic gradient, at a rate proportional to the gradient (the direction 
of the slope of the water table), inversely related to the aquifer’s permeability. The 
more permeable the substrate and the steeper the slope, the more rapidly the water 
flows.
Groundwater, of course, contrary to popular belief, does not flow like a river. 
Percolating downward, groundwater moves from high elevations to lower elevations 
at a variable rate that is dependent on underground conditions. Sometimes slow-
moving, it can sometimes move surprisingly quickly, from less than an inch to a 
several feet a day.
Groundwater aquifers, as we said previously, supply a large portion of the US 
population—and almost all of the rural population. They form important sources 
of water. Groundwater use demand continues to increase, which threatens both the 
quantity and quality of this critically important resource. Two important points 
should be remembered that concern groundwater: (1) The groundwater supply is 
not inexhaustible; and (2) groundwater is not exempt from surface contamination. 
It is not completely purified as it percolates through the ground, even though the 
interconnectedness of the hydrological cycle in self-purification works to our advan­
tage. The processes integral to the water cycle can trap toxins, complicating efforts 
to clean them up, which is of special concern for persistent pollutants. The natural 
processes that clean our water as it travels through the hydrological cycle worked 
well for centuries, but now, in many places, humans have overloaded the capacity 
of the water cycle to self-purify. While we are now cleaning up problems created by 
past environmental abuse and ignorance, inevitably, we create problems that future 
generations will have to clean up. The solutions we try now will present future gen­
erations with problems we did not foresee, but re-creating past mistakes is foolish 
and foolhardy. Our water system is too valuable for us to risk.
Thus, it logically follows that groundwater pollution can be a very serious prob­
lem. We already know, through experience and study, that any pollutant that contacts 
the ground holds the possibility for contaminating groundwater. As water enters the 
ground, it filters naturally through the soil, and in some soils, that process quite 
effectively removes many substances, including suspended solids and bacteria—and 
pollutants. Some chemicals are removed as they bind themselves to the surface of 
soil particles (phosphates). In some areas, though, industrial and municipal wastes 
are sprayed on the ground surface, and employing the natural self-purification pro­
cess, that wastewater filters through the soil, becomes purified in the process and 
recharges the groundwater reservoir. Septic tanks, agriculture, industrial waste 
lagoons, underground injection wells, underground storage tanks and landfills can 
all lead to ground water contamination. Nature is not defenseless against these pol­
luters. Natural purification of water, as it passes through the soil works to cleanse 

82
The Science of Ocean Pollution
polluted water is a slow but beneficial process; however, because the water has no 
access to air and is not readily diluted.
CASE STUDY 7.4—NITRATES AND PREGNANCY
A federal study to examine the possibility of a link between water polluted by 
nitrates and miscarriages is under consideration. Scientists at the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention have been pushing for a regional or national study since four 
Indiana women drinking well water high in nitrates had miscarriages between 1991 
and 1994. All four women carried healthy babies to term, once the tasteless, odorless 
bacteria found in animal waste was removed from their well water.
La Grange, IN, Lancaster Co., PA, Albany, GA, and Pojoaque, NM are all pos­
sible sites where local drinking waters are often high in nitrates and are under 
consideration as possible study sites. Soil with large amounts of limestone and agri­
cultural areas contaminated with animal waste are often contaminated with nitrates. 
Manure and chemical fertilizers can also contribute to nitrate pollution. “Blue Baby 
Syndrome,” a condition of depleted oxygen levels in infants, is caused by nitrate 
consumption.
Serious examination into drinking water as a factor in birth defects, adverse preg­
nancy outcomes and developmental disabilities has never been accomplished. That 
the four Indiana women all carried healthy babies to term once the nitrate source was 
removed is of particular to toxicologists, indicating a strong possible link between 
the contaminated water and the problem pregnancies.
Funding for this study, however, has not been approved, and may not be approved. 
Competition for federal funding to underwrite research is stiff. Other, more well-
known issues, including possible harmful effects of chlorination used for water puri­
fication and the vulnerability of our water supplies to terrorism, are also in line for 
the same funding dollars (Lancaster New Era, 9/22/98).
Drainage-basin activities that pollute surface waters also cause groundwater 
contamination. Problems can occur from sources as diverse as septic tanks, agri­
culture, industrial waste lagoons, underground injection wells, underground storage 
tanks and landfills. Waste disposal sites located in unsuitable soils (or even directly 
over fractured dolomites and limestones) can cause major problems. Disposal sites 
located directly on top of such rock allow polluted water to travel into wells. At least 
25% of the usable groundwater (from wells) is already contaminated in some areas 
(Draper, 1987).
Causes of groundwater contamination vary. Increasingly, groundwater contami­
nation from saltwater, microbiological contaminants, and toxic organic and inor­
ganic chemicals have occurred, and are now being observed. The major source of 
groundwater contamination in the United States comes from the improper disposal 
of toxic industrial wastes. The levels of and problems related to contamination from 
these wastes are increased significantly when waste disposal sites are not protected 
by some type of lining; when disposal sites lie in permeable materials above usable 
water aquifers; and when these sites are located close to water supply wells. In 1982, 
the Conservation Foundation reported that groundwater contamination was respon­
sible for closing hundreds of US wells.

WETLANDS
Wetlands are areas that are inundate or saturated by surface or groundwater at fre­
quency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances 
do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil 
conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas. 
Wetlands routinely replenish and purify groundwater supplies. By absorbing excess 
nutrients and immobilizing pesticides, heavy metals and other toxins, wetland plants 
prevent them from moving up the food chain. Wetlands have been used to treat sew­
age in some locations. However, wetland ecosystems are relatively fragile, and their 
capacity to cleanse polluted water is limited. Many have been overwhelmed by pol­
lution, though more of our natural wetland areas have been destroyed by anthropo­
genic activities. In the United States, for example, half our wetlands have been lost 
to urban and agricultural development (Goldsmith & Hildyard, 1998).
THE BOTTOM LINE ON SURFACE WATER AND 
GROUNDWATER POLLUTION
Unless you notice water bodies best described as cesspools, and/or experience water 
that smells foul and tastes worse (and ultimately might make you ill), you may think 
that water pollution is relative and find it hard to define. Once you come up with a 
definition (it might have something to do with physical characteristics and negative 
impact), you may also consider the idea that freshwater pollution is not a new phenom­
enon. Only the issue of freshwater pollution as a major public concern is relatively new.
We have defined water pollution as the presence of unwanted substances in water 
beyond levels acceptable for health or aesthetics. We pointed out that water pollut­
ants may include organic matter (living or dead) heavy metals, minerals, sediment, 
bacteria, viruses, toxic chemicals and volatile organic compounds. We have also 
made the point that surface water pollution is a serious threat to our survival on 
Earth—but we also need to point out that contamination of our groundwater supplies 
is even a more serious threat.
Natural forms of pollutants have always been present in surface waters. Many 
of the pollutants we have discussed in this chapter were being washed from the air, 
eroded from land surfaces or leached from the soil, and ultimately found their way 
into surface water bodies long before humans were present to walk on Earth. Floods 
and dead animals pollute, but their effects are local and generally temporary. In 
prehistoric times (and even in more recent times), natural disasters have contributed 
to surface water pollution. Cataclysmic events—earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, 
meteor impact, transition from ice age to inter glacial to ice age—have all contrib­
uted to surface water pollution. Natural purification processes—over time—were 
able to self-clean surface water bodies. We can accurately say that without these 
self-purifying processes, the water-dependent life on earth could not have developed 
as it did (Peavy et al., 1985).
But the natural problems, the ones the environment could eventually self-clean, 
are augmented by anthropogenic ones. Man-made problems piled on top of the natu­
ral pollutants present us with greater risks—and greater challenges.

84
The Science of Ocean Pollution
Groundwater cycles and sources are complex and the problems that affect ground­
water demand our most complicated remedial processes, because of the interconnec­
tions with soil pollution. Underground storage tanks, for example, create problems 
as difficult in their way to control as nonpoint source pollution’s effects of surface 
water supplies.

Water Pollution 
Treatment
INTRODUCTION
As the world population grows, we are forced by circumstances we have created to 
face the realization of our resources’ limitations. Most of us in the United States 
have always been fortunate enough to have had enough of whatever we needed, and 
whatever we wanted. When something we like breaks or wears out, we throw it 
away and buy a new one, and often we don’t even try to fix the problem. We neglect 
basic maintenance until we damage our belongings beyond repair and we expect 
that we will always have enough. But some things are beyond our control, beyond 
our power or financial ability to replace or repair. Our water supply is one of these. 
Without concern, without attention, without preventive maintenance and reclama­
tion, our water supply will not be able to support the needs of the future (Spellman 
& Whiting, 2006).
In regard to water pollution, remediation means providing a remedy. When 
humans contaminate water, eventually when the contamination gets our attention, 
when the contamination irritates the hell out of us, when the contamination totally 
offends us, and/or when the contamination makes us ill or worse, we sometimes 
provide a remedy. There are, of course, various types of remedy; many of them are 
discussed in this chapter. But the type of remedy is not yet our concern in this brief 
introduction. On the contrary, at this moment it is our intent to make the point that 
we simply do not seem to get “it” when we contaminate water and then repeat our 
actions—over and over again. When it comes to preventing pollution, our intentions 
and actions seem somewhat topsy-turvy. This trend is not new to human nature or 
to environmental problems. Maybe we can sum up environmental remediation and 
learning from our mistakes from, arguably, the wisdom provided to us by the Mad 
Hatter and Alice in Alice in Wonderland (Carroll, 1865):
Alice:	
Nobody ever tells us to study the right things we do. We’re only sup­
posed to learn from the wrong things. But we are permitted to study 
the right things other people do. And sometimes we’re even told to 
copy them.
Mad Hatter:	 That’s cheating!
Alice:	
You’re quite right, Mr. Hatter. I do live in a topsy-turvy world. It 
seems like I have to do something wrong first, in order to learn from 
what not to do. And then, by not doing what I’m supposed to do, per­
haps I’ll be right. But I’d rather be right the first time, wouldn’t you?

The Science of Ocean Pollution
HISTORICAL PROSPECTIVE
The public, environmentalists and legislators came to the realization in the early 
1970s that our water resources were in critical condition and needed the protection 
offered by regulation. Specifically, our traditional fresh water supplies were at risk: 
lakes, streams and rivers. While environmentalists were aware of how serious our 
water resource problems were several years before legislation was enacted, in the 
1950s and 1960s, their voiced environmental concerns were ignored, or overridden 
by the loud, financially driven declarations of polluters, who simply played their 
standard trump card and declared “greenies” and other environmentalists to be weir­
does, communists, flower children, pot heads and ultra, ultra-bleeding-heart liberals. 
For many years, most people ignored the environmentalists, and their concerns were 
sidelined. Eventually, though, we woke up and put pressure on Congress to enact two 
important regulations designed to protect our water resources: the Federal Water 
Pollution Control Act of 1972, and the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974.
The Safe Drinking Water Act (SWDA) of 1974 (a US federal law) came about 
when federal legislators became aware of the sad (and unhealthy) condition of many 
local drinking water supplies, and the reluctance of local and state officials to remove 
pollutants from their wastewater. The act set national drinking water standards called 
maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) for pollutants that might adversely affect pub­
lic health and welfare. The first standards went into effect 3 years later and specifi­
cally covered every public water supply in the country serving at least 15 service 
connections, or 25 or more people. Because over 200 contaminants from hazardous 
wastes injected into the soil were identified in groundwater, SDWA also established 
standards to protect groundwater from such practices. Specifically, SDWA requires 
establishment of programs to protect critical groundwater sources of drinking water, 
to protect areas around wells that supply public drinking water systems, and to regu­
late the underground injection of wastes above and below drinking water sources.
Later, in 1982 and 1983, the USEPA established a priority list for setting regula­
tions for over 70 substances. These substances were listed because they are toxic 
and likely to be found in drinking water. In 1986, when Congress reauthorized the 
SWDA, it amended the Act and directed the EPA to monitor drinking water for 
unregulated contaminants and to inform public water suppliers about which sub­
stances to look for. The 1986 reauthorization also instructed the EPA to set stan­
dards within 30 years for all 70 substances on its priority list. By the end of 1994, 
the priority list had been expanded, and the EPA had set standards for more than 80 
substances.
Under the Act, local public water systems are required to monitor their drinking 
water periodically for contaminants with MCLs and for a broad range of other con­
taminants as specified by the EPA. Enforcement of the standards, monitoring and 
reporting are the responsibility of the individual states, but the 1986 amendments 
require the EPA to act when the state fails or moves too slowly and authorizes sub­
stantial civil penalties against the worst violators.
SWDA and its amendments also authorize EPA to set secondary drinking water 
standards regarding public welfare, by providing guidelines on the taste, odor, color 
and aesthetic aspects of drinking water—those that do not present a health risk. 

89
Water Pollution Treatment
These guidelines are nonenforceable and are called suggested levels. The EPA rec­
ommends these levels to the states as reasonable goals, but federal law does not 
require water systems to comply with them, though some individual states have 
enforceable regulations regarding these concerns.
The 1996 amendments also ban all future use of lead pipe and lead solder in 
public drinking water systems and require public water systems to tell their users of 
the potential sources of lead contamination, its health effects and the steps they can 
reasonably take to mitigate lead contamination.
In 1972, Congress enacted the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, commonly 
called the Clean Water Act (CWA). CWA stems originally from a much-amended 
1948 law, which helped communities to build sewage treatment plants. CWA is “the 
keystone” of environmental law and is credited with significantly cutting the amount 
of municipal and industrial pollution fed into the nation’s water bodies.
Through the 1970s and 1980s, the primary aim of the Clean Water Act was to 
make national waters fishable and swimmable. Specifically, it sought to eliminate 
discharge of untreated municipal and industrial wastewater into waterways (many of 
which are used as sources of drinking water), providing billions of dollars to finance 
building of sewage treatment plants.
In the 1987 amendments (The Water Quality Act, which reauthorized the origi­
nal Clean Water Act), the Act focused on updating standards for dealing with toxic 
chemicals, since much of the toxic pollution still fouling the nation’s surface water 
bodies came from companies that had installed 1970s-era pollution control tech­
nologies. For the first time, these regulations attempted to deal with water pollution 
stemming from non-point sources (city streets and croplands, for example), requiring 
states to identify waters that do not meet quality standards and developing programs 
to deal with the problem.
EFFECT OF REGULATIONS ON PREVENTING WATER POLLUTION
Are the laws pertaining to water supply protection passed since the early 70s ade­
quate to protect our water resources, and to ensure water quality? While assuming so 
might feel good, such an assumption ignores several important concerns. Enacting 
regulation does not ensure compliance or enforcement; enacting legislation does not 
ensure program funding; and enacting legislation does not ensure complete cover­
age of the entire problem. Exceptions to regulation coverage can cause plenty of 
pollution problems on their own. For example, over 100,000 public water systems 
are exempt from SDWA requirements as not serving year-round residents, although 
these systems include schools, factories, seasonal resorts, summer camps, roadside 
restaurants and hospitals.
Simply stated, regulations designed to protect the environment, and at the same 
time to protect public health and welfare are only the first step across the bridge 
between pollution and prevention. Once in place, regulations must be complied with 
and enforced. Then the effort shifts from one of determining direction, objectives 
and goals—to one of implementation. In this implementation phase, technology 
comes into play—in fact, it plays the key role. Remember, a society can have all 
kinds of plans, objectives, goals and regulations to stipulate what needs to be done to

The Science of Ocean Pollution
correct or mitigate an environmental problem, but none of these will bring about 
positive results unless the means (technology) is available at reasonable cost to 
accomplish the requirements. With the “means” also comes a certain amount of 
common sense. Only solid, legitimate, careful scientific analysis can provide the 
answers and the solutions to environmental problems. Making environmental 
decisions through political action rather than scientific analysis gives us deci­
sions that “feel” good or “feel” right, rather than solve the problem. We need 
to step back and size up the situation. This can only be accomplished by using 
proper, careful scientific methodology. The future of our water supply shouldn’t 
be left to dysfunctional bureaucracy, hare-brained analysis and/or the results of 
pseudo-analysis.
In the sections that follow, we briefly discuss traditional treatment technologies 
currently available and widely used for water, wastewater, thermal contamination, 
underground storage tanks (USTs) and groundwater pollution problems.
A SHERLOCK HOLMES’ TYPE AT THE PUMP
He wandered the foggy, filthy, corpse-ridden streets of 1854 London searching, mak­
ing notes, always looking … seeking a murdering villain—and find the miscreant, 
he did.1 He acted; he removed the handle from a water pump. And, fortunately for 
untold thousands of lives, his was the correct action—the lifesaving action.
He was a detective—of sorts. No, not the real Sherlock Holmes—but absolutely 
as clever, as skillful, as knowledgeable, as intuitive—and definitely as driven. His 
real name: Dr. John Snow. His middle name? Common Sense. Snow’s master crimi­
nal, his target—a mindless, conscienceless, brutal killer: Cholera.
Let’s take a closer look at this medical super sleuth and at his quarry, the deadly 
killer cholera—and at Doctor Snow’s actions to contain the spread of cholera. More 
to the point, let’s look at Dr. Snow’s subsequent impact on water treatment (disinfec­
tion) of raw water used for potable and other purposes.
Dr. John Snow
An unassuming—and creative—London obstetrician, Dr. John Snow (1813–1858), 
achieved prominence in the mid-19th century for proving his theory (in his On the 
Mode of Communication of Cholera) that cholera is a contagious disease caused 
by a “poison” that reproduces in the human body and is found in the vomitus and 
stools of cholera patients. He theorized that the main (though not the only) means 
of transmission was water contaminated with this poison. His theory was not held 
in high regard at first, because a commonly held and popular counter-theory stated 
that diseases are transmitted by inhalation of vapors. Many theories of cholera’s 
cause were expounded. In the beginning, Snow’s argument did not cause a great 
stir; it was only one of many hopeful theories proposed during a time when chol­
era was causing great distress. Eventually, Snow was able to prove his theory. We 
describe how Snow accomplished this later, but for now, let’s take a look at Snow’s 
target: Cholera.

Water Pollution Treatment
Cholera
According to the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), cholera is an acute, diar­
rheal illness caused by infection of the intestine with the bacterium Vibrio cholera. 
The infection is often mild or without symptoms, but sometimes can be severe. 
Approximately 1 in 20 infected persons have severe disease symptoms characterized 
by profuse watery diarrhea, vomiting and leg cramps. In these persons, rapid loss of 
body fluids leads to dehydration and shock. Without treatment, death can occur 
within hours.
How does a person contract cholera? Good question. Again, we refer to the CDC 
for our answer. A person may contract cholera (even today) by drinking water or eat­
ing food contaminated with the cholera bacterium. In an epidemic, the source of the 
contamination is usually feces of an infected person. The disease can spread rapidly 
in areas with inadequate treatment of sewage and drinking water. Disaster areas 
often pose special risks. The aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans caused, 
for example, concern for a potential cholera problem.
Cholera bacterium also lives in brackish river and coastal waters. Shellfish eaten 
raw have been a source of cholera, and a few people in the United States have con­
tracted cholera after eating raw shellfish from the Gulf of Mexico. The disease is not 
likely to spread directly from one person to another; therefore, casual contact with 
an infected person is not a risk for transmission of the disease.
Flashback to 1854 London
The information provided in the preceding section was updated and provided by 
CDC in 1996. Basically, for our purposes, CDC confirms the fact that cholera is a 
waterborne disease. Today, we know quite a lot about cholera and its transmission, 
how to prevent infection and how to treat it. But what did they know about cholera 
in the 1850s? Not much—however, one thing is certain: They knew cholera was a 
deadly killer. That was just about all they knew—until Dr. John Snow proved his 
theory. Recall that Snow theorized that cholera is a contagious disease caused by 
a poison that reproduces in the human body and is found in the vomitus and stools 
of cholera victims. He also believed that the main means of transmission was water 
contaminated with this poison.
DID YOU KNOW?
You don’t need to be a rocket scientist to figure out just how deadly cholera was 
during the London cholera outbreak of 1854. Comparing the state of “medi­
cine” at that time to ours is like comparing the speed potential of a horse and 
buggy to a state-of-the-art NASCAR race car today. Simply stated: Cholera 
was the classic epidemic disease of the 19th century, as the plague had been for 
the fourteenth. Its defeat reflected both common sense and progress in medi­
cal knowledge—and the enduring changes in European and American social 
thought.

92
The Science of Ocean Pollution
Dr. Snow’s theory was correct, of course, as we know today. The question is, how 
did he prove his theory correct? The answer to which provides us with an account of 
one of the all-time legendary quests for answers in epidemiological research—and 
an interesting story.
Dr. Snow proved his theory in 1854, during yet another severe cholera epidemic 
in London. Though ignorant of the concept of bacteria carried in water, Snow traced 
an outbreak of cholera to a water pump located at an intersection of Cambridge and 
Broad Street (London).
How did he isolate this source to this particular pump? He accomplished this by 
mapping the location of deaths from cholera. His map indicated that the majority of 
the deaths occurred within 250 yards of that water pump. The water pump was used 
regularly by most of the area residents. Those who did not use the pump remained 
healthy. Suspecting the Broad Street pump as the plague’s source, Snow had the 
water pump handle removed and ended the cholera epidemic.
Sounds like a rather simple solution, doesn’t it? For us, it is simple, but remem­
ber, in that era, aspirin had not yet been formulated—to say nothing of other medi­
cal miracles we take for granted—antibiotics, for example. Dr. John Snow, by the 
methodical process of elimination and linkage (Sherlock Holmes would have been 
impressed—and he was), proved his point, his theory. Specifically, through pains­
taking documentation of cholera cases and correlation of the comparative incidence 
of cholera among subscribers to the city’s two water companies, Snow showed that 
cholera occurred much more frequently in customers of the water company that drew 
its water from the lower Thames, where the river had become contaminated with 
London sewage. The other company obtained water from the upper Thames. Snow 
tracked and pinpointed the Broad Street pump’s water source. You guessed it: the 
contaminated lower Thames, of course.
Dr. Snow the obstetrician became the first effective practitioner of scientific 
epidemiology. His creative use of logic, common sense and scientific information 
enabled him to solve a major medical mystery—to discern the means by which chol­
era was transmitted.
Pump Handle Removal—To Water Treatment (Disinfection)
Dr. John Snow’s major contribution to the medical profession, to society and to 
humanity in general can be summarized rather succinctly: He determined and 
proved that the deadly disease cholera is a waterborne disease (Dr. John Snow’s 
second medical accomplishment was that he was the first person to administer anes­
thesia during childbirth).
What does all of this have to do with water treatment (disinfection)? Actually, 
Dr. Snow’s discovery—his stripping of a mystery to its barest bones—has quite a lot to 
do with water treatment. Combating any disease is rather difficult without a determina­
tion on how the disease is transmitted—how it travels from vector or carrier to receiver. 
Dr. Snow established this connection, and from his work, and the work of others, prog­
ress was made in understanding and combating many different waterborne diseases.
Today, sanitation problems in developed countries (those with the luxury of ade­
quate financial and technical resources) deal more with the consequences that arise 

93
Water Pollution Treatment
from inadequate commercial food preparation, and the results of bacteria becoming 
resistant to disinfection techniques and antibiotics. We simply flush our toilets to rid 
ourselves of unwanted wastes and turn on our taps to take in high-quality drinking 
water supplies, from which we’ve all but eliminated cholera and epidemic diarrheal 
diseases. This is generally the case in most developed countries today—but it cer­
tainly wasn’t true in Dr. Snow’s time.
The progress in water treatment from that notable day in 1854 [when Snow made 
the “connection” (actually the “disconnection” of handle from pump) between 
deadly cholera and its means of transmission] to the present reads like a chronology 
of discovery leading to our modern water treatment practices. This makes sense, of 
course, because with the passage of time, pivotal events and discoveries occur—
events that have a profound effect on how we live today. Let’s take a look at a few 
elements of the important chronological progression that evolved from the simple 
removal of a pump handle to the advanced water treatment (disinfection) methods 
we employ today to treat our water supplies.
After Snow’s discovery (that cholera is a waterborne disease emanating primarily 
from human waste), events began to drive the water/wastewater treatment process. 
In 1859, 4 years after Snow’s discovery, the British Parliament was suspended during 
the summer because the stench coming from the Thames was unbearable. According 
to one account, the river began to “seethe and ferment under a burning sun.” As was 
the case in many cities at this time, storm sewers carried a combination of storm 
water, sewage, street debris and other wastes to the nearest body of water. In the 
1890s, Hamburg, Germany suffered a cholera epidemic. Detailed studies by Koch 
tied the outbreak to the contaminated water supply. In response to the epidemic, 
Hamburg was among the first cities to use chlorine as part of a wastewater treatment 
regimen. About the same time, the town of Brewster, New York became the first US 
city to disinfect its treated wastewater. Chlorination of drinking water was used on 
a temporary basis in 1896, and its first known continuous use for water supply disin­
fection occurred in Lincoln, England and Chicago in 1905. Jersey City, NJ became 
one of the first routine users of chlorine in 1908.
Time marched on, and with it came an increased realization of the need to treat 
and disinfect both water supplies and wastewater. Between 1910 and 1915, techno­
logical improvements in gaseous and then solution feed of chlorine made the pro­
cess more practical and efficient. Disinfection of water supplies and chlorination of 
treated wastewater for odor control increased over the next several decades. In the 
United States, disinfection, in one form or another, is now being used by more than 
15,000 out of approximately 16,000 Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTWs). 
The significance of this number becomes apparent when you consider that fewer 
than 25 of the 600+ POTWs in the United States in 1910 were using disinfectants.
Water Treatment
Treatment of drinking water to remove contaminants is one of the oldest forms of 
public health protection. Municipalities normally control contaminants in drinking 
water supplies by following established treatment procedures. The contaminants of 
most concern to us are those that may cause disease: pathogenic microorganisms. 

94
The Science of Ocean Pollution
Table 8.1 lists some of the most common diseases caused by microorganisms found 
in water supplies, and their common sources.
Although safeguarding health is the most important reason for treating drinking 
water, it is not the only reason. Consumer acceptance is also important. One thing is 
certain, however, that the treatment needs of a water system differs depending on the 
quality of the source water.
Typically, before distribution to local destinations (homes, schools, businesses 
and hospitals), water withdrawn from its source (lake, river or aquifer) undergoes 
some type of treatment. Again, initial water quality determines the needed degree of 
treatment. Most water systems, large or small, include certain basic treatment steps.
Water treatment is a reasonably simple process. Once treated, the water is sent 
through a network of pipes (distribution system) to customers. To ensure its quality, 
water must be monitored and tested by licensed operators throughout the treatment and 
delivery process. Generally, surface water is more complicated to treat than ground­
water because contamination is more likely. However, sometimes groundwaters are 
“hard” (containing calcium or magnesium), which means an additional step is added to 
the treatment process (softening by using alum and lime) to remove hardness.
Note: Keep in mind that all water eventually ends up in the floating oceans; there­
fore, treatment of freshwater is added here because if not treated wastewater ends up 
in the oceans. Moreover, wastewater treatment is not all inclusive in the removal of 
pollutants and this is particularly the case in PPCPs. It has been my experience that 
these contaminants escape treatment or are not treated at all before outfalling into 
the oceans.
WASTEWATER TREATMENT
In the previous section, we learned some of the methodology used to clean raw 
water and make it suitable for human consumption. In the anthropogenic hydraulic 
cycle, the majority of water provided to the community by a public water supply is

Water Pollution Treatment
discharged to some form of wastewater collection and disposal system where it is 
purified and often then returned to surface water bodies, to again becomes part of 
the available water supply. Actually, there are five major sources that generate waste­
water, and each source’s wastewater presents specific characteristics.
1.	Human and Animal Wastes: This contains the solid and liquid discharges 
of humans and animals, and millions of bacteria, viruses and other organ­
isms—some pathogenic. Considered by many as the most dangerous from 
a human health viewpoint.
2.	Household Wastes: The wastes (other than human and animal wastes) dis­
charged from the home. Contains paper, household cleaners, detergents, 
trash, garbage and any other substance that the average homeowner may 
decide to discharge into the sewer system.
3.	Industrial Wastes: All materials which can be discharged from industrial 
processes into the collection system are included in this category. May con­
tain chemicals, dyes, acids, alkalis, grit, detergents and highly toxic materi­
als. Characteristics are industry specific and cannot be determined without 
detailed information on the specific industry and processes used.
4.	Stormwater Runoff: If the collection system is designed to carry both the 
wastes of the community and stormwater runoff, wastewater can, during 
and after storms, contain large amounts of sand, gravel, road-salt and other 
grit, as well as excessive amounts of water.
5.	Groundwater Infiltration: If the collection system is old or not sealed prop­
erly, groundwater may enter the system through cracks, breaks or unsealed 
joints. This can add large amounts of water to the wastewater flows, as well 
as additional grit.
Wastewater can be classified according to the sources of the flow.
1.	Domestic Wastewater (sewage): This consists mainly of human and animal 
wastes, household wastes, small amounts of groundwater infiltration and 
perhaps small amounts of industrial wastes.
2.	Sanitary Wastewater: This consists of domestic wastes and significant 
amounts of industrial wastes. In many cases, the industrial wastes can be 
treated without special precautions. In other cases, the industrial wastes 
require special precautions or a pretreatment program to ensure the wastes 
do not cause compliance problems for the plant.
3.	Industrial Wastewater: Often industries determine that treating its wastes 
independent of the domestic wastes is more economical than paying for 
municipal wastewater treatment.
4.	Combined Wastewater: This is a combination of sanitary wastewater and 
storm water runoff. All the wastewater and stormwater of the community is 
transported through one system and enters the treatment system.
5.	Stormwater: Many communities have installed separate collection systems 
to carry the stormwater runoff. Stormwater flow should contain grit and 
street debris, but no domestic or sanitary wastes.

96
The Science of Ocean Pollution
Wastewater contains many different substances which can be used to character­
ize it. Depending on the source, the specific substances present will vary, as will the 
amounts or concentration of each. For this reason, wastewater characteristics are 
normally described for an average domestic wastewater. Other sources and types of 
wastewater can dramatically change the characteristics.
Physical characteristics of wastewater include:
•	 Color—Typical wastewater is gray and cloudy. Wastewater color will 
change significantly if allowed to go septic. Typical septic wastewater will 
be black.
•	 Odor—Fresh domestic wastewater has a musty odor. This odor will change 
significantly if septic. Septic wastewater develops the rotten egg odor asso­
ciated with hydrogen sulfide production.
•	 Temperature—Wastewater temperature will normally be close to that of 
the water supply. Significant amounts of infiltration or stormwater flow can 
cause major temperature changes.
•	 Flow—The volume of wastewater is normally expressed in terms of gallons 
per person per day. Most treatment plants are designed using an expected 
flow of 100–200 gallons per person per day. This figure may have to be 
revised to reflect the degree of infiltration or stormwater flow the plant 
receives. Flow rates will vary throughout the day. This variation, which 
can be as much as 50% to 200% of the average daily flow, is known as the 
diurnal flow variation.
Wastewater chemical characteristics include:
•	 Alkalinity—A measure of the wastewater’s capability to neutralize acids. 
Measured in terms of bicarbonate, carbonate and hydroxide alkalinity, 
alkalinity is essential to buffer (hold the neutral pH) wastewater during the 
biological treatment process.
•	 Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)—A measure of the amount of bio­
degradable matter in the wastewater. Normally measured by a 5-day test 
conducted at 20°C. The BOD5 domestic waste is normally in the range of 
100–300 mg/L.
•	 Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)—A measure of the amount of oxidiz­
able matter present in the sample. The COD is normally in the range of 
200–500 mg/L. The presence of industrial wastes can increase this significantly.
•	 Dissolved Gases—Gases which are dissolved in wastewater. The specific 
gases and normal concentrations are based on the composition of the waste­
water. Typical domestic wastewater contains oxygen (relatively low concen­
trations), carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide (if septic conditions exist).
•	 Nitrogen Compounds—The type and amount of nitrogen present varies 
from the raw wastewater to treated effluent. Nitrogen follows a cycle of oxi­
dation and reduction. Most of the nitrogen in untreated wastewater will be 
in the forms of organic nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen, presence and levels 
determined by laboratory testing. The sum of these two forms of nitrogen is 

97
Water Pollution Treatment
also measured and is known as Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN). Wastewater 
will normally contain 20–85 mg/L of nitrogen. Organic nitrogen will nor­
mally be in the range of 8–35 mg/L and ammonia nitrogen will be in the 
range of 12–50 mg/L.
•	 pH—A method of expressing the acid condition of wastewater. For proper 
treatment, wastewater pH should normally be in the range of 6.5–9.0.
•	 Phosphorus—Essential to biological activity and must be present in at least 
minimum quantities or secondary treatment processes will not perform. 
Excessive amounts can cause stream damage and excessive algal growth. 
Phosphorus will normally be in the range of 6–20 mg/L. The removal of 
phosphate compounds from detergents has had a significant impact of the 
amounts of phosphorus in wastewater.
•	 Solids—Most pollutants found in wastewater can be classified as solids. 
Wastewater treatment is generally designed to remove solids, or to convert 
solids to a removable or more stable form. Solids can be classified by their 
chemical composition (organic or inorganic) or by their physical character­
istics (settleable, floatable, colloidal). Concentration of total solids in waste­
water is normally in the range of 350–1200 mg/L.
•	 Water—Always the major component of the wastewater. In most cases, 
water makes up 99.5% to 99.9% of wastewater. Even in the strongest waste­
water, the total amount of contamination present is less than 0.5% of the 
total, and in average strength wastes, it is normally less than 0.1%.
As a process, wastewater treatment is designed to use the natural purification 
processes to the maximum level possible, and to complete these processes in a con­
trolled environment rather than over many miles of stream. Removing contaminants 
not addressed by natural processes and treating the solids generated by the treatment 
steps are further tasks of wastewater treatment. The specific goals wastewater treat­
ment plants are designed to accomplish include:
•	 Protecting public health
•	 Protecting public water supplies
•	 Protecting aquatic life
•	 Preserving the best uses of the waters
•	 Protecting adjacent lands
Wastewater treatment is accomplished by applying up to seven principle treat­
ment steps to the incoming wastestream. The processes and equipment for each step 
are specific to the task. The major categories of treatment steps used in many treat­
ment plants include preliminary treatment, primary treatment, secondary treatment, 
advanced waste treatment, disinfection and biosolids treatment.
Preliminary treatment removes materials (wood, rocks and other forms of debris) 
that could damage treatment plant equipment, or that would occupy treatment capac­
ity without being affected by treatment.
Primary treatment removes larger particles by filtering through screens, remov­
ing settleable and floatable solids in ponds or lagoons. Water is removed from the top 

98
The Science of Ocean Pollution
of the settling lagoon and released to further treatment stages. Water that has been 
treated in this manner has had its sand and grit removed, but still carries a heavy 
load of organic matter, dissolved salts, bacteria and other microorganisms. Primary 
treatment removes up to about 60% of suspended solids. In larger cities where sev­
eral cities a few miles or less from each other take water and return it to a stream, 
primary wastewater treatment is not adequate.
Secondary treatment usually follows primary treatment and is designed to 
remove BOD5 and dissolved and colloidal suspended organic matter by biological 
action. Organics are converted to stable solids, carbon dioxide and more organisms 
by holding the wastewater until the organic material has been degraded by the bac­
teria and other microorganisms. It removes up to 90% of the oxygen-demanding 
wastes by using either trickling filters, where aerobic bacteria degrade sewage as 
it seeps through a large vat bed filled with media (rocks, plastic media, etc.) cov­
ered with bacterial growth, or an activated sludge process, in which the sewage is 
pumped into a large tank and mixed for several hours with bacteria-rich biosolids 
and air to increase bacterial degradation. To optimize this action, large quanti­
ties of highly oxygenated water for aerating water are added directly by a blower 
system.
Advanced wastewater treatment (tertiary sewage treatment) uses physical, chemi­
cal and biological processes to remove additional BOD5, solids and nutrients. 
Advanced wastewater treatment is normally used in facilities that have unusually 
high amounts of phosphorus and nitrogen present.
Disinfection is used to kill pathogenic microorganisms, to eliminate the possibil­
ity of disease when the flow is discharged.
Biosolids treatment works to stabilize the solids removed from the wastewater 
during treatment, inactivates pathogenic organisms and/or reduces the volume of the 
biosolids by removing water (dewatering).
THERMAL POLLUTION TREATMENT
Heat is considered a water pollutant because of the adverse effect it has on oxygen 
levels and aquatic life in surface water bodies. Approximately half of the water with­
drawn in the United States is used for cooling large power-producing plants. The 
easiest and cheapest (thus most common) method is to withdraw cold water from a 
lake or river, pass it through heat exchangers in the facility, and return the heated 
water to the same body of water. The warm water discharge raises the receiving 
body’s temperature, lowers DO content and causes aquatic organisms to increase 
their respiration rates, causing them to consume the already depleted oxygen faster.
We can minimize the harmful effects of excess heat on aquatic ecosystems in a 
number of ways. Two of the most commonly used methods are the cooling tower and 
dry tower methods.
In the cooling tower method, the heated water is sprayed into the air and cooled 
by evaporation. The obvious disadvantage of this treatment method is the loss of 
large amounts of water to evaporation. Production of localized fogs is another 
disadvantage.

Water Pollution Treatment
The dry tower method (cooling tower method) does not release water into the 
atmosphere. Instead, the heated water is pumped through tubes and the heat is 
released into the air, which is similar to the action performed by an automobile’s 
radiator. The disadvantage to using the dry tower method is the high cost of both 
construction and operation.
POLLUTION CONTROL TECHNOLOGY: 
UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANKS
Recent estimates have ranged from five to six million, but no one is quite sure just 
how many underground storage tanks (USTs) containing hazardous substances or 
petroleum products are in use in the United States. Compounding the issue, no one 
can even guess how many USTs are no longer being used (abandoned USTs). These 
abandoned tanks often still hold (or held) some portion of their contents, which may 
have been oozing (and sometimes pouring) out, fouling water, land and air. Another 
problem is just biding its time; older USTs that are not leaking today will probably 
leak soon, in the near future. One thing is certain, however, that environmental con­
tamination from leaking USTs poses a significant threat to human health and the 
environment.
Besides the obvious problem of fouling environmental mediums (water, soil and 
air), ironically, many of these leaking USTs also pose serious fire and explosion haz­
ards. The irony is that USTs came into common use primarily as a fire and explosion 
prevention measure (the hazard was buried under the ground). Today, however, the 
hazards we worked to protect ourselves from are finding ways and means to present 
themselves as hazards in a different manner.
The problem with leaking USTs goes beyond fouling the environment (especially 
groundwater, which 50% of the US population relies on for drinking water) and pre­
senting fire and explosion hazards. Products released from these leaking tanks can 
damage sewer lines, buried cables and poison our crops.
What are underground storage tanks (USTs)? USEPA under its Resource 
Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) defines USTs as tanks with 10% or more of 
their volume, including piping, underground. The largest portion of the USTs regu­
lated by EPA are petroleum storage tanks owned by gas stations; another significant 
percentage are petroleum storage tanks owned by a group of other industries (air­
ports, trucking fleets, farms, manufacturing operations and golf courses) that store 
petroleum products for their own use.
In 1986, the US Congress established a UST cleanup fund known as Leaking 
Underground Storage Tank (LUST) trust fund. The EPA, tasked with the responsi­
bility of exploring, developing and disseminating new cleanup technologies and the 
funding mechanism for the program, must still leave the primary job of cleaning up 
LUST sites to the various state and local governments. Owners and operators of tank 
facilities are liable for cleanup costs and damage caused by their tanks—not a small 
matter in any way. The average cost for remediating a site containing petroleum 
contamination to the soil and groundwater is on the order of $200,000–$350,000 
(present worth), depending on the lateral and vertical extent of the contamination 

100
The Science of Ocean Pollution
and the required cleanup target levels. In some cases, the cost of cleanup may exceed 
the value of the property.
When the EPA and other watchdog groups initially investigated the problem of 
leaking USTs in 1985, they found that many of the existing USTs were more than 
20 years old—or of unknown age. Compounding the problem, these older tanks 
were usually constructed of bare steel—not protected against corrosion and nearing 
the end of their useful lives (Holmes et al., 1993). Many of the old tank systems had 
already leaked or were right on the edge of leaking. Many of these old tanks were 
found in abandoned gas stations (shut down because of the oil crisis in the 1970s).
Because of the findings of the EPA and others on the scope of the problem with 
USTs, regulatory requirements were put into place. The regulatory requirements for 
USTs depend on whether the system is an existing or a new installation. An existing 
installation is defined as one that was installed prior to 1988.
These regulatory requirements for USTs must now be met. Under Federal 
Regulations (40 CFR Part 280), all existing USTs must have overfill and spill pro­
tection. Corrosion protection and leak detection systems must be installed in accor­
dance with the schedule mandated by the Federal regulations. The compliance 
schedule ensures that the oldest tanks (those with the greatest potential for failure) 
are addressed first. Pressured and suction piping installed prior to December 1988 
must have corrosion protection by December 1998.
To evaluate the integrity of an installed UST, all owners must abide by certain 
regulatory requirements (minimum requirements).
Under Federal Law, facilities having USTs containing petroleum and hazardous 
substances must respond to a leak or spill within 24 hours of release, or within another 
reasonable period of time, as determined by the implementing agency. Responses to 
releases from USTs are site-specific and depend on several different factors. Corrective 
action usually involves two stages. Stage one (initial response) is directed toward con­
tainment and collection of spilled material. Stage two (permanent corrective response) 
involves technical improvements designed to ensure that the incident does not occur 
again. Preventive-action technology usually includes employing either containment, 
diversion, removal or treatment protocols. The choice of which technology to employ 
in spill prevention and correction depends on its suitability, lifespan, ease of implemen­
tation and ease of performing required maintenance checks.
USEPA (1988) issued Cleanup of Releases from Petroleum USTs: Selected 
Technologies, which has become the standard reference in deciding which technol­
ogy to employ for use in cleanup of releases from petroleum USTs. Although only 
a limited number of technologies are available to clean environmental mediums of 
the contaminants associated with gasoline, their practicality, removal efficiencies, 
limitations and costs are well-documented.
Two technologies are presently used to limit the migration of floating gasoline 
across the water table and to recover free product from the water table: the Trench 
Method and the Pumping Well Method. The trench method uses a variety of equip­
ment, including skimmers, filter separators and oil/water separators. In the pumping 
well method, both single- and dual-pump systems are available for use.
When the water table is no deeper than 10–15 ft below the ground surface, the 
trench method is most effective. The advantages of this method include the ease at 

101
Water Pollution Treatment
which the trench can be excavated, and the ability to capture the entire leading edge 
of the plume. The disadvantage in using the trench method is that it does not reverse 
groundwater flow, which means it may not be appropriate for use when a potable 
well supply is threatened. The cost of this system is about $150 per cubic yard of soil 
excavated.
For deep spills (when the water table depth exceeds 20 ft below the ground sur­
face), a pumping well system is the preferred method used to recover free product 
from the water table. The major advantage of using this system is that it can reverse 
the direction of groundwater flow. Including the cost of labor and engineering, this 
system ranges from about $150 to $300 per foot for 4- to 10-in. gravel-packed galva­
nized steel wells (USEPA, 1988).
Because gasoline spilled onto the soil may eventually find its way to groundwater, 
removal of gasoline from unsaturated soils is an essential component of any correc­
tive action plan. A number of removal techniques are available, but they all vary 
in effectiveness and cost. The most widely used corrective action is excavation and 
disposal. Other methods include volatilization, incineration, venting, soil washing/
extraction and microbial degradation.
Excavation and disposal can be 100% effective. Unfortunately, however, usually 
only a small portion of the contaminated soil can be removed, because of high costs. 
Other disadvantages include the limitations of excavation equipment (backhoes nor­
mally only reach down to about 16 ft.), that landfills may not accept the contaminated 
soil and lack of uniform guidelines for the proper disposal of contaminated soil.
Volatilization will effectively remove about 99% of volatile organic compounds 
(VOCs), but the process does not have an extensive track record (because it is little 
used) to make definitive statements as to its efficiency and/or effectiveness in the 
field.
Incineration, like volatilization, will remove approximately 99% of gasoline 
constituents in soil. Having proven itself highly reliable, incineration of gasoline 
contaminated soil is widely practiced. The practice does have a few limitations, how­
ever. (1) The soil must be brought to the surface, increasing the risk of exposure. (2) 
Incineration is usually appropriate only when toxics other than volatiles are pres­
ent. (3) Unfortunately, permitting delays (fighting the bureaucratic paper chase) may 
cause time delays.
The big advantage of using venting (which can be up to 99% effective) is that it 
allows for the removal of gasoline without excavation. However, because critical 
parameters have not yet been defined, venting is not widely used in the field. Venting 
is relatively easy to implement, but its effectiveness is uncertain because soil charac­
teristics may impede free movement of vapors—and could even lead to an explosion 
hazard.
Soil washing and extraction works to leach contaminants from the soil into a 
leaching medium, after which the extracted contaminants are removed by conven­
tional methods. Under ideal conditions, up to 99% of VOCs can be removed. If 
the contaminated soil contains high levels of clay and silt, they may impede the 
separation of the solid and liquid after the washing phase. The soil’s suitability 
for decontamination using this method should be verified before this procedure is 
implemented.

102
The Science of Ocean Pollution
Microbial degradation, theoretically, can remove up to 99% of the contaminants. 
This method is in the research mode, with field testing still in progress, so its cost 
effectiveness and overall effectiveness have not been verified. If further testing sup­
ports its viability for use in the field, the advantage will be that in situ treatment is 
possible with volatiles completely destroyed.
POLLUTION CONTROL TECHNOLOGY: 
GROUNDWATER REMEDIATION
Nyer (1992) points out that when a pollutant is released onto or into the soil, the main 
force on the movement of the material is gravity. If the ground is porous, the pollut­
ant will move downward. Some lateral spread of the movement will occur, controlled 
by the porosity of the soil. The speed of movement will be dependent on the viscosity 
of the material spilled and the porosity of the soil. Several things can happen to the 
contaminant as it progresses downward before it encounters the aquifer. Initially, 
the contaminant may undergo any of the following: adsorption on the soil particles, 
volatilization, biological degradation, and usually to a lesser degree, hydrolysis, oxi­
dation, reduction and dehydrohalogenation (Olsen & Davis, 1990).
For many years, groundwater was not only the only source of potable water avail­
able in certain areas, but it was also the source of choice even when other sources 
were available, because of the perception of groundwater as pure. People thought 
that it only needed disinfection before being sent to the household tap. They assumed 
that precipitation filtered its way through Earth’s strata to the water table where it 
was held in a “clean” state and, by the nature of its confinement there, was protected 
from surface contamination.
This view of groundwater has problems, though. In the first place, since ground­
water is so widely used and because the populations using it have increased at a 
steady pace, many groundwater supplies have either been depleted or lowered to the 
point where in coastal areas, saltwater intrusion takes place. Secondly, groundwater 
supplies may become polluted.
Both groundwater depletion and groundwater pollution may be irreversible. 
Depletion can cause an aquifer to consolidate, diminishing its storage capacity. 
Groundwaters may be contaminated by both naturally occurring and artificial mate­
rials. Just about anything water comes into contact with will eventually be dissolved 
in or mixed with the flow. If contaminated, the water is likely to remain that way.
Of particular concern in groundwater pollution are nonaqueous-phase liquids 
(NAPLs). NAPLs are classified as either light (LNAPLs) or dense (DNAPLs). 
LNAPLs include such products (referred to as products because of their potential 
for commercial reuse) as gasoline, heating oil and kerosene. The widespread use of 
underground storage tanks has made these products common in many soils. Because 
LNAPLs are light, they tend to float on the groundwater, penetrating the capillary 
fringe and depressing the water surface. Even when the source of the spill is con­
trolled, the soil will remain contaminated, and the floating layer will serve as a long-
term source of contamination (McGhee, 1991). From a health standpoint, DNAPLs 
are a much more serious problem. They include trichloroethane, carbon tetrachlo­
ride, creosote, dichlorobenzene and others. Because these compounds are toxic, with 

103
Water Pollution Treatment
low viscosity, great density and low solubility, they are not only health hazards but 
they are also very mobile in groundwater and spread quickly throughout a localized 
aquifer.
Nyer (1992) points out that if the aquifer must be cleaned, the treatment method 
or methods employed for an organic cleanup will depend upon several factors. Nyer 
suggests all of the following will have to be considered when choosing the unit oper­
ations to be used:
•	 Description of the release: concentration, quantity of contaminant, total 
time allotted for cleanup and final use of the water
•	 Properties of the spilled material: solubility, density, strip ability, absorb­
ability and biodegradability
•	 Site and aquifer characteristics: depth to water, permeability, extent of con­
tamination and ongoing site activities
In contaminated groundwater mitigation and treatment, usually only localized 
areas of an aquifer need reclamation and restoration, because the spread of contami­
nants is usually confined to the plume. Experience has shown, however, that even 
after the original source of contamination is removed, cleanup of a contaminated 
aquifer is often costly, time-consuming and troublesome. Problems with cleanup 
include difficulty in identifying the type of subsurface environment, locating poten­
tial contamination sources, defining potential contaminant transport pathways, 
determining contaminant extent and concentration, and choosing and implementing 
an effective remedial process (Davis & Cornwell, 1991).
Cleanup is possible, but not simple. Certain methods, in some cases (especially 
where groundwater has been pumped from the subsurface), have proven success­
ful. These efforts have been refined from processes used to treat industrial wastes. 
However, attempting to treat site-contaminated groundwater using these methods is 
often confusing. The contaminants themselves may also dictate what methodologies 
should work for mitigation. When the contaminant is a single chemical, the treat­
ment system employed may be simple, but cases involving multiple contaminants, 
extremely complex. To determine which treatment should be employed, only rep­
resentative samples and laboratory analysis will provide the needed information. 
Cleanup technologies commonly used for groundwater containing organic contami­
nation include air stripping and activated carbon. The chemical precipitation process 
is used for inorganics in groundwater. We briefly describe each of these treatment 
processes in the following.
In air stripping (a relatively simple mass transfer process), a substance in solution 
in water is transferred to a solution in a gas. Air stripping uses four basic equipment 
configurations, including diffused aeration, countercurrent packed columns, cross­
flow towers and coke tray aerators. The countercurrent packed tower system has sig­
nificant advantages (provides the most liquid interfacial area and high air-to-water 
volume ratios) over the other systems and is most often used in removing volatile 
organics from contaminated groundwater.
Carbon adsorption occurs when an organic molecule is brought to the activated 
carbon surface and held there by physical and/or chemical forces. When activated 

104
The Science of Ocean Pollution
carbon particles are placed in water containing organic chemicals and mixed to give 
adequate contact, adsorption of the organic chemicals occurs. Activated carbon 
adsorption has been successfully employed for removing organics from contami­
nated groundwaters.
Biological treatment, a new technology still under evaluation by pilot studies, 
works to remove or reduce the concentration of organic and inorganic compounds. 
To undergo biological treatment, contaminated groundwater must first be pretreated 
to remove toxins that could destroy microorganisms needed to metabolize and 
remove the contaminants.
In removing inorganic contaminants, the established and commonly used meth­
odology is chemical precipitation. Accomplished by the addition of carbonate, 
hydroxide or sulfide chemicals, chemical precipitation has successfully removed 
heavy metals from groundwaters.
When groundwater near a potable water system (well) is contaminated, the most 
common way to protect the water from an approaching plume of contaminated 
groundwater is to use some combination of extraction wells and injection wells. 
Extraction wells are used to lower the water table, creating a hydraulic gradient that 
draws the plume to the wells. Injection wells raise the water table and push the plume 
away. Working in combination, extraction wells and injection wells’ pumping rates 
can be adjusted in such a way to manipulate the hydraulic gradient, which helps keep 
the plume away from the potable water well, drawing it toward the extraction well. 
Once extracted, the contaminated water is treated, and either re-injected back into 
the aquifer, reused or released into the local surface water system (Masters, 1991).
THE BOTTOM LINE
Traditional treatment methods go a long way toward handling the problems of point 
source pollution problems. The issues of how to handle the less obvious problems of 
non-point source pollution and the out-of-sight problems of USTs and groundwater 
are now being addressed. These problems are more subtle and demand the applica­
tion of skills from a number of remediation technologies/techniques.

Runoff into the 
Floating Sea
The sea, once it casts its spell, holds one in its net of wonder forever.
Jacques Cousteau
NONPOINT SOURCE POLLUTION
As shown in Figures 9.1 and 9.2 nonpoint source pollution (NPS) generally results 
from land runoff and unlike pollution from industrial and sewage treatment plants, 
comes from many diffuse sources. Runoff results from precipitation, atmospheric 
deposition, drainage, seepage or hydrological modification.
Other wastes that enter our water supply are more difficult to define, quantify and 
control. Stormwater or storm runoff, for example, is also a major contributor to the 
endless wastewater stream. The average person might assume that rain that runs off 
their homes, into their yards and then down the streets during a storm event is fairly 
clean. It is not. Harmful substances wash off roads, fields, lawns, parking lots, and 
rooftops and can harm our still waters (lakes, ponds, etc.) and running waters (riv­
ers, streams, etc.). Stormwater also, obviously, is incident-related. If it doesn’t rain, 
stormwater doesn’t enter the system. Stormwater provides nonpoint-source pollut­
ants to the wastewater stream; we know in a general way what they will carry, and 
we put systems in place to channel and control the stream, but complex programs 
and modeling are used—and essential—to evaluating how to handle stormwater to 
avoid serious problems with treatment and control, specifically to handle many dif­
ferent levels of force in storm incidents of differing durations.
Agricultural sources also contribute several problems to wastewater treatment, 
problems that have been difficult to evaluate, identify and control. Historically, 
especially before the chemical industry provided manufactured fertilizers and pes­
ticides for crop farm production and growth hormones and antibiotics for livestock 
production, the techniques individual farmers used were reasonably environmen­
tally friendly—because the size of the farm dictated the limits of production: Any 
individual farmer has limits that include his own physical and financial ability to 
work, and effective natural limits on how many bushels of grain or animals per 
acre the land itself could support, because in general, overloading those capacities 
provide negative results. As modern practices evolved, though, our water systems 
suffered. Fertilizers, pesticides, hormones and antibiotics send nonpoint-source pol­
lution directly into local water systems, which create downstream problems in the 
water system. A number of both crop and livestock farming practices contribute to 
soil erosion, which, of course, affects both soil and water quality. However, the most 
9

108
The Science of Ocean Pollution
recent changes in farming practices in the last several decades (perhaps best defined 
as the switch from the small farmer to “agribusiness” or factory farms), and the 
increasing demand for inexpensive meat products, have created a new set of prob­
lems to address. While the “factory farming” of crops presents a whole different set 
of issues, we address problems created by the factory farming of livestock, which 
creates agricultural point-source pollution of extreme scope.

Runoff into the Floating Sea
CASE STUDY 9.1
Note: Consider the following proposal; it was presented to my environmental health 
students at Old Dominion University (ODU) each semester (1999–2009). Along with 
the proposal the following instructions are given to the students: Read the following 
and explain why it will not work. Second, provide a better alternative. If the proposal 
will work, how will it work? Finally, should we do anything to clean up Chesapeake 
Bay—or should we just leave the entire mess for Mother Nature? Explain your opin­
ion in no more than one paragraph. Readers might also want to consider these ques­
tions and provide their own answers.
Chesapeake Bay: A Modest Proposal
Nutrient pollution in the Chesapeake Bay is real and ongoing—the controversy over 
what is the proper mitigation procedure(s) is intense and never-ending (very politi­
cal). Nutrients are present in animal and human waste and chemical fertilizers. All 
organic material such as leaves, and grass clippings contains nutrients. These nutri­
ents cause algal growth and depletion of oxygen in the Bay, which leads to the forma­
tion of dead zones lacking in oxygen and aquatic life.
Nutrients can find their way to the Bay from anywhere within the 64,000 square 
mile Chesapeake Bay watershed—and that is the problem. All streams, rivers and 
storm drains in this huge area eventually lead to the Chesapeake. The activities of 
over 13.6 million people in the watershed have overwhelmed the Bay with excess 
nutrients. Nutrients come from a wide range of sources, which include sewage treat­
ment plants (20–22%), industry, agricultural fields, lawns and even the atmosphere. 
Nutrient inputs are divided into two general categories, point sources and nonpoint 
sources.
Sewage treatment plants, industries and factories is the major point sources (end-
of-pipe dischargers). These facilities discharge wastewater containing nutrients 
directly into a waterway. Although each facility is regulated for the amount of nutri­
ents that can be legally discharged, at times, violations occur.
The largest source of nutrients dumped into the Bay are from nonpoint sources 
(general runoff). These nonpoint sources pose a greater threat to the Chesapeake 
ecosystem, as they are much harder to control and regulate. It is my view that because 
of the difficulty in controlling runoff from agricultural fields and the lack of politi­
cal will and the technical difficulty in preventing such flows, wastewater treatment 
plants and other end-of-pipe dischargers have become the targets of convenience for 
the regulators. The problem is that the regulators require the expenditure of hundreds 
of millions of dollars to upgrade wastewater treatment to biological nutrient removal 
(BNR), tertiary treatment and/or the combining of microfiltration membranes with a 
biological process to produce superior quality effluent—these requirements are com­
mendable, interesting, achievable, but alone will not lead to Bay restoration.
The alternative, the answer to the dead-zone problem, to the lack of oxygen prob­
lem in various locations in the Chesapeake Bay? Take a portion of the hundreds of 
millions of dollars earmarked for upgrading wastewater treatment plants and build 
mobile, floating platforms containing electro/mechanical aerators or mixers. These 

110
The Science of Ocean Pollution
platforms should be outfitted with diesel generators and accessories to provide power 
to the mixers. The mixer propellers are adjustable; they are able to mix at water 
depths of 10–35 ft. Again, these platforms are mobile. When a dead zone appears in 
the Bay, the platforms are moved to the center of the dead-zone area and mixers ener­
gized at the appropriate depth—the platforms are anchored to the Bay bottom and so 
arranged to accommodate maritime traffic. The idea is to churn the dead-zone water 
and sediment near the Bay bottom and force a geyser-like effect above the surface to 
aerate the Bay water in the dead-zone regions. Absolutely nothing adds more oxygen 
to water than natural or artificial aeration. Of course, while aerating and forcing 
oxygen back into the water, bottom sediments containing contaminants will also be 
stirred up and sent to the surface, and temporary air pollution problems will occur 
around the mobile platforms. Some will view this turning up of contaminated sedi­
ments as a bad thing. On the contrary, removing contaminants from the Bay through 
evaporation is a very good thing.
How many of these mobile mixer platforms will be required? It depends on the 
number of dead zones. Enough platforms should be constructed to handle the warm 
season’s average number of dead zones that appear in the Bay.
Will this modest proposal actually work? I do not have a clue. However, this pro­
posal makes more sense than spending hundreds of millions of dollars on upgrading 
wastewater treatment plants and effluent quality when this only accounts for 20–22% 
of the actual problem…and the regulators and others do not have the political will to 
go after runoff which is the real culprit in contaminating the Chesapeake Bay with 
nutrients.
Recall that it was that great mythical hero Hercules, arguably the world’s first 
environmental engineer, who said that “dilution is the solution to pollution.” Let’s 
dilute the hell out of the Chesapeake Bay dead zones by aerating them.
Note: In this presentation about ocean pollution it is important to point out where 
some of the pollution comes from; thus, the following is presented.
OTHER SOURCES OF WATER POLLUTION
Water covers almost three-quarters of Earth’s surface. Although it is our most abun­
dant resource, water is present on Earth in only a thin film—and almost 97% of it is 
saltwater. Earth’s water performs many functions essential to life on Earth, helping 
to maintain climate, diluting environmental pollution and, of course, supporting all 
life. Freshwater sources include groundwater and surface water. In this chapter, we 
focus on surface water—rivers, lakes, streams, wetlands and coastal waters all of 
which end up in the sea, one way or another.
Note that each year billions of trash and other pollutants enter the ocean. We have 
pointed out that some of this pollution comes from nonpoint sources, but this does 
not account for all of the sources. Some debris ends up on our beaches, washed in 
with the waves and tides. Some debris sinks, some are eaten by marine animals that 
mistake it for food, and some accumulates in ocean gyres.
So, in addition to nonpoint sources of ocean pollution, what are the other sources 
of pollution? Point-source pollution is commonly known as end-of-the-pipe pollu­
tion. Ocean water pollution comes from factories, power plants, municipal sewage 

111
Runoff into the Floating Sea
treatment plants and other end-of-pipe sources such as construction sites where 
waste enters stormwater systems that empty in the ocean.
Most human settlements evolved and continue to develop along the shores of many 
freshwater bodies, mainly rivers. The obvious reason for this is threefold: accessibil­
ity, a plentiful source of drinking water, and, later, a source of energy (waterpower) 
for our earliest machines.
When human populations began to spread out and leave the watercourses, we 
found that some areas had too little water and others too much. Human beings 
(being the innovative and destructive creatures we are) have, with varying degrees 
of success, attempted to correct these imbalances by capturing fresh water in reser­
voirs behind dams, transferring fresh water in rivers and streams from one area to 
another, tapping underground supplies and endeavoring to reduce water use, waste 
and contamination. Water pollution can be defined in a general way as the presence 
of unwanted substances in water beyond levels acceptable for health or aesthetics. In 
some of these efforts, we have been successful; in others (when gauged against the 
present condition of our water supplies) we are still learning—and we have much 
more to learn.
Unfortunately, only a small proportion (about 0.5%) of all water on Earth is found 
in lakes, rivers, streams or in the atmosphere. Even this small amount, though, is 
more than enough, if it were kept free of pollution and distributed evenly, to provide 
for the drinking, food preparation and agricultural needs of all Earth’s people. We 
simply need to learn how to better manage and conserve the fresh water readily 
available to us. And also we need to learn how to better manage the pollutants that 
enter our oceans.
Again, an important fact to keep in mind about pollutants is that eventually a 
huge percentage of them end up in the oceans either from rivers and streams and 
groundwater sources—freshwater surface and groundwater sources. As mentioned, 
in many cases, these pollutants do not enter the ocean in a quick manner, for example 
it may take several years for groundwater pollutants to make their way to the ocean, 
but eventually they will.
Note: Because freshwater surface and groundwaters containing pollutants will 
eventually make their way into the ocean, it is important to provide a basic discus­
sion of both surface and groundwater; thus, the next sections are presented.
Surface Water
Precipitation that does not infiltrate into the ground or return to the atmosphere is 
called surface water. When freshly fallen and still mobile, not having yet reached 
a body of water, we call it runoff—water that flows into nearby lakes, wetlands, 
streams, rivers, reservoirs and eventually outfalls into the oceans.
Before continuing our discussion of surface water, let us review the basic concepts 
of the hydrologic cycle.
Actually, a manifestation of an enormous heat engine, the water cycle raises water 
from the oceans in warmer latitudes by a prodigious transformation of solar energy. 
Transferred through the atmosphere by the winds, the water is deposited far away 
over sea or land. Water taken from the Earth’s surface to the atmosphere (either by 

112
The Science of Ocean Pollution
evaporation from the surface of lakes, rivers, streams and oceans or through transpi­
ration of plants) forms clouds that condense to deposit moisture on the land and sea 
as rain or snow. The water that collects on land flows back to the oceans in streams 
and rivers.
The water that we see is surface water. USEPA defines surface water as all water 
open to the atmosphere and subject to runoff. Surface fresh water can be broken 
down into four components: lakes, rivers and streams, estuaries and wetlands.
Limnology is the study bodies of open fresh water (lakes, rivers and streams) and 
of their plant and animal biology and physical properties. Freshwater systems are 
grouped or classified as either lentic or lotic. Lentic (lenis = calm) systems are rep­
resented by lakes, ponds, impoundments, reservoirs and swamps—standing water 
systems. Lotic (lotus = washed) systems are represented by rivers, streams, brooks 
and springs—running water systems. On occasion, distinguishing between these 
two different systems is difficult. In old, wide and deep rivers where water velocity is 
quite low, for example, the system becomes similar to that of a pond.
Surface water (produced by melting snow or ice or from rainstorms) always fol­
lows the path of least resistance. In other words, water doesn’t run uphill. Beginning 
with droplets and ever-increasing, runoff is carried by rills, rivulets, brooks, creeks, 
streams and rivers from elevated land areas that slope down toward one primary 
water course—a topographically defined drainage area. Drainage areas, known as water­
sheds or drainage basins, are surrounded by a ridge of high ground called the water­
shed divide. Watershed divides separate drainage areas from each other.
Lentic (Standing or Still) Water Systems
Natural lentic water systems include lakes, ponds, bogs, marshes and swamps. Other 
standing freshwater bodies, including reservoirs, oxidation ponds, and holding 
basins, are usually constructed. The term still water can be deceiving and still for 
only some period of time—because its contents will eventually end up in the ocean. 
Consider the following:
Still Water
Consider a river pool, isolated by fluvial processes and time from the mainstream 
flow.1 We are immediately struck by one overwhelming impression: It appears so 
still … so very still … still enough to sooth us. The river pool provides a kind of 
poetic solemnity, if only at the pool’s surface. No words of peace, no description of 
silence or motionless can convey the perfection of this place, in this moment stolen 
out of time.
We ask ourselves, “The water is still, but does the term ‘still’ correctly describe 
what we are viewing … is there any other term we can use besides still—is there any 
other kind of still?”
Yes, of course, we know many ways to characterize still. For sound or noise, 
“still” can mean inaudible, noiseless, quiet or silent. With movement (or lack of 
movement), still can mean immobile, inert, motionless or stationary. At least this is 
how the pool appears to the casual visitor on the surface. The visitor sees no more 
than water and rocks.

113
Runoff into the Floating Sea
The rest of the pool? We know very well that a river pool is more than just a sur­
face. How does the rest of the pool (the subsurface, for example) fit the descriptors we 
tried to use to characterize its surface? Maybe they fit, maybe they don’t. In time, we 
will go beneath the surface, through the liquid mass, to the very bottom of the pool 
to find out. For now, remember that images retained from first glances are almost 
always incorrectly perceived, incorrectly discerned and never fully understood.
On second look, we see that the fundamental characterization of this particular 
pool’s surface is correct enough. Wedged in a lonely riparian corridor—formed by 
riverbank on one side and sand bar on the other—between a youthful, vigorous river 
system on its lower end and a glacier- and artesian-fed lake on its headwater end, 
almost entirely overhung by mossy old Sitka spruce, the surface of the large pool, 
at least at this particular location, is indeed still. In the proverbial sense, the pool’s 
surface is as still and as flat as a flawless sheet of glass.
The glass image is a good one because like perfect glass, the pool’s surface is 
clear, crystalline, unclouded, definitely transparent, yet perceptively deceptive as 
well. The water’s clarity, accentuated by its bone-chilling coldness, is apparent at 
close range. Further back, we see only the world reflected in the water—the depths 
are hidden and unknown. Quiet and reflective, the polished surface of the water per­
fectly reflects in a mirror-image reversal the spring greens of the forest at the pond’s 
edge, without the slightest ripple. Up close, looking straight into the bowels of the 
pool we are struck by the water’s transparency. In the motionless depths, we do not 
see a deep, slow-moving reach with muddy bottom typical of a river or stream pool; 
instead, we clearly see the warm variegated tapestry of blues, greens, and blacks 
stitched together with threads of fine, warm-colored sand that carpets the bottom, at 
least 12 feet below. Still, waters can run deep.
No sounds emanate from the pool. The motionless, silent water doesn’t, as we 
might expect, lap against its bank or bubble or gurgle over the gravel at its edge. 
Here, the river pool, held in temporary bondage, is patient, quiet, waiting, withhold­
ing all signs of life from its surface visitor.
Then the reality check: The present stillness, like all feelings of calm and seren­
ity, could be fleeting, momentary, temporary, you think. And you would be correct, 
of course, because there is nothing still about a healthy river pool.
At this exact moment, true clarity is present; it just needs to be perceived … and 
it will be.
We toss a small stone into the river pool and watch the concentric circles ripple 
outward as the stone drops through the clear depths to the pool bottom. For a brief 
instant, we are struck by the obvious: the stone sinks to the bottom, following the 
laws of gravity, just as the river flows according to those same inexorable laws—
downhill in its search for the sea. As we watch, the ripples die away, leaving as little 
mark as the usual human lifespan creates in the waters of the world, then disappears 
as if it had never been. Now the river water is as before, still. At the pool’s edge, we 
look down through the massy depth to the very bottom—the substrate.
We determine that the pool bottom is not flat or smooth, but instead is pitted 
and mounded occasionally with discontinuities. Gravel mounds alongside small cor­
responding indentations—small, shallow pits—make it apparent to us that gravel 
was removed from the indentations and piled into slightly higher mounds. From our 

114
The Science of Ocean Pollution
topside position, as we look down through the cool, quiescent liquid, the exact height 
of the mounds and the depth of the indentations is difficult for us to judge; our vision 
is distorted through several feet of water.
However, we can detect near the low gravel mounds (where female salmon bur­
ied their eggs, and where their young grow until they are old enough to fend for 
themselves), and actually through the gravel mounds, movement—water flow—an 
upwelling of groundwater. This water movement explains our ability to see the var­
iegated color of pebbles. The mud and silt that would normally cover these pebbles 
has been washed away by the water’s subtle, inescapable movement. Obviously, in 
the depths, our still water is not as still as it first appeared.
The slow, steady, inexorable flow of water in and out of the pool, along with 
the up-flowing of groundwater through the pool’s substrate and through the salmon 
redds (nests) is only a small part of the activities occurring within the pool, includ­
ing the air above it, the vegetation surrounding it and the damp bank and sandbar 
forming its sides.
Let’s get back to the pool itself. If we could look at a cross-sectional slice of the 
pool, at the water column, the surface of the pool may carry those animals that can 
literally walk on water. The body of the pool may carry rotifers and protozoa and 
bacteria—tiny, microscopic animals—as well as many fish. Fish will also inhabit 
hidden areas beneath large rocks and ledges, to escape predators. Going down further 
in the water column, we come to the pool bed. This is called the benthic zone, and 
certainly the greatest number of creatures lives here, including larvae and nymphs of 
all sorts, worms, leeches, flatworms, clams, crayfish, dace, brook lampreys, sculpins, 
suckers and water mites.
We need to go down even further, down into the pool bed, to see the whole story. 
How far this goes and what lives here, beneath the water, depends on whether it is 
a gravelly bed or a silty or muddy one. Gravel will allow water, with its oxygen and 
food, to reach organisms that live underneath the pool. Many of the organisms that 
are found in the benthic zone may also be found underneath, in the hyporheal zone.
But to see the rest of the story we need to look at the pool’s outlet, and where its 
flow enters the main river. This is the riffles—shallow places where water runs fast 
and is disturbed by rocks. Only organisms that cling very well, such as net-winged 
midges, caddisflies, stoneflies, some mayflies, dace and sculpins can spend much 
time here, and the plant life is restricted to diatoms and small algae. Riffles are a 
good place for mayflies, stoneflies and caddisflies to live because they offer plenty 
of gravel to hide.
At first, we struggled to find the “proper” words to describe the river pool. 
Eventually, we settled on “Still Waters.” We did this because of our initial impres­
sion, and because of our lack of understanding—lack of knowledge. Even knowing 
what we know now, we might still describe the river pool as still waters. However, 
in reality, we must call the pool what it really is: a dynamic habitat. This is true, 
of course, because each river pool has its own biological community, all members 
interwoven with each other in complex fashion, all depending on each other. Thus, 
our river pool habitat is part of a complex, dynamic ecosystem. On reflection, we 
realize, moreover, that anything dynamic certainly can’t be accurately characterized 
as “still”—including our river pool.

Lotic (Flowing) Water Systems
The human circulatory system to the Earth’s water circulation system. The hydro­
logical cycle pumps water as our hearts pump blood, continuously circulating water 
through air, water bodies and various vessels. As our blood vessels are essential to 
the task of carrying blood throughout our bodies, water vessels (rivers) carry water, 
fed by capillary creeks, brooks, streams, rills and rivulets. Consider the following 
account of stream genesis.
Stream Genesis
Early in the spring on a snow and ice-covered high alpine meadow the time and place 
the water cycle continues.2 The cycle’s main component, water, has been held in 
reserve—literally frozen, for the long dark winter months, but with longer, warmer 
spring days, the sun is higher, more direct, and of longer duration and the frozen 
masses of water respond to the increased warmth. The melt begins with a single 
drop, then two, then more and more. As the snow and ice melts, the drops join a 
chorus that continues unending; they fall from their ice-bound lip to the bare rock 
and soil terrain below.
The terrain the snowmelt strikes in not like glacial till, the unconsolidated, 
heterogeneous mixture of clay, sand, gravel and boulders, dug-out, ground-out and 
exposed by the force of a huge, slow and inexorably moving glacier. Instead, this 
soil and rock ground is exposed to the falling drops of snowmelt because of a com­
bination of wind and tiny, enduring force exerted by drops of water as over season 
after season they collide with the thin soil cover, exposing the intimate bones of 
the Earth.
Gradually, the single drops increase to a small rush—they join to form a splash­
ing, rebounding, helter-skelter cascade, many separate rivulets that trickle, then run 
their way down the face of the granite mountain. At an indented ledge halfway down 
the mountain slope, a pool forms whose beauty, clarity and sweet iciness provides 
the visitor with an incomprehensible, incomparable gift—a blessing from Earth.
The mountain pool fills slowly, tranquil under the blue sky, reflecting the pines, 
snow and sky around and above it, an open invitation to lie down and drink, and to 
peer into the glass-clear, deep waters, so clear that it seems possible to reach down 
over 50 feet and touch the very bowels of the mountain. The pool has no transition 
from shallow margin to depth, it is simply deep and pure. As the pool fills with more 
melt water, we wish to freeze time, to hold this place and this pool in its perfect state 
forever, it is such a rarity to us in our modern world. But this cannot be—mother 
nature calls, prodding, urging—and for a brief instant, the water laps in the breeze 
against the outermost edge of the ridge, then a trickle flows over the rim. The giant 
hand of gravity reaches out and tips the overflowing melt onward, and it continues 
the downward journey, following the path of least resistance to its next destination, 
several thousand feet below.
When the overflow, still high in altitude, but its rock-strewn bed bent downward, 
toward the sea, meets the angled, broken rocks below, it bounces, bursts and mists 
its way against steep, V-shaped walls that form a small valley, carved out over time 
by water and the forces of the Earth.

116
The Science of Ocean Pollution
Within the valley confines, the melt water has grown from drops to rivulets to 
a small mass of flowing water. It flows through what is at first a narrow opening, 
gaining strength, speed and power as the V-shaped valley widens to form a U-shape. 
The journey continues as the water mass picks up speed and tumbles over massive 
boulders, then slows again.
At a larger but shallower pool, waters from higher elevations have joined the main 
body—from the hillsides, crevices, springs, rills, mountain creeks. At the influent 
pool-sides all appears peaceful, quiet and restful, but not far away, at the effluent end 
of the pool, gravity takes control again. The overflow is flung over the jagged lip, and 
cascades downward several hundred feet, where the waterfall again brings its load to 
a violent, mist-filled meeting.
The water separates and joins again and again, forming a deep, furious, wild 
stream that calms gradually as it continues to flow over lands that are less steep. The 
waters widen into pools overhung by vegetation, surrounded by tall trees. The pure, 
crystalline waters have become progressively discolored on their downward journey, 
stained brown, black with humic acid and literally filled with suspended sediments; 
the once-pure stream is now muddy.
The mass divides and flows in different directions, over different landscapes. Small 
streams divert and flow into open country. Different soils work to retain or speed the 
waters, and in some places the waters spread out into shallow swamps, bogs, marshes, 
fens or mires. Other streams pause long enough to fill deep depressions in the land and 
form lakes. For a time, the water remains and pauses in its journey to the sea. But this 
is only a short-term pause because lakes are only a short-term resting place in the water 
cycle. The water will eventually move on, by evaporation or seepage into groundwa­
ter. Other portions of the water mass stay with the main flow, and the speed of flow 
changes to form a river, which braids its way through the landscape, heading for the 
sea. As it changes speed and slows, the river bottom changes from rock and stone to silt 
and clay. Plants begin to grow, stems thicken and leaves broaden. The river is now full 
of life and the nutrients needed to sustain life. But the river courses onward, its destiny 
met when the flowing rich mass slows its last and finally spills into the sea.
THE BOTTOM LINE
The great part of pollutants that make their way into the ocean come from human 
activities along the coastlines, far inland and from ships at sea. Again, one of the 
biggest sources of ocean pollution is nonpoint source pollution, which occurs as 
result of runoff. As mentioned, most surface water is the result of surface runoff. 
The amount and flow rate of this surface water is highly variable, which comes into 
play for two main reasons: (1) human interferences (influences) and (2) natural con­
ditions. In some cases, surface water runs quickly off land surfaces. From a water 
resources standpoint, this is generally undesirable, because quick runoff does not 
provide enough time for the water to infiltrate the ground and recharge groundwater 
aquifers. Surface water that quickly runs off land also causes erosion and flooding 
problems. Probably the only good thing that can be said about surface water that runs 
off quickly is that it usually does not have enough contact time to increase in mineral 
content. Slow surface water off land has all the opposite effects.

Log Patrol
TRANSFORMATIVE JOURNEYS
In my younger teenage years (many moons ago) while still adventurous and resilient 
(advantages of youth), I had the good fortune of hooking up with a couple of close 
relatives, an older uncle in his 60s and a cousin in his 30s, in Seattle, Washington in 
the lucrative but hazardous (for me, anyway) log-patrolling activity. My uncles had 
purchased a wooden World War II landing craft and renovated it including installa­
tion of a brand-new diesel engine that enabled the craft to plow the seas slowly but 
with a lot of towing power. And it turned out we needed a lot of the towing power for 
our log-patrolling enterprise.
My relatives were far thinkers and adventurers who tried different activities to 
make a living. They purchased the retrofitted landing craft to become licensed log 
patrollers (aka log salvors) and to capture, tow and sell errant logs. We were after 
errant logs in the Strait of Juan de Fuca and lower in the Puget Sound region, mostly 
submerged logs that had escaped from logging companies tow booms that were 
headed toward various pulp mills in Puget Sound including the Everett, Washington 
area. The Strait is 96 miles (154 km) long that is the main outlet to the Pacific Office 
via the Salish Sea. Within the long waterway (see Figure 10.1), which is classified as 
a channel, contains numerous islands, including Vancouver Island, and its southern 
boundary is the northern coast of the Olympic Peninsula. This channel, bordered 
by the islands and the northern Washington State, is covered with enormous forest 
stands of valuable trees.
These enormous stands of Douglas fir, Sitka spruce, Western cedar, Western 
Hemlock and bigleaf maples trees frame this pristine waterway, which is framed 
to the north and south with islands within the Strait and with some in-between the 
United States and Canadian borders (see Figure 10.1).
For years, various logging enterprises in the Pacific Northwest took advantage of 
and harvested the trees for construction and the lesser perfect sawlogs for the pulp 
mills in the region. These logging operations located along the Washington State 
border within the Strait harvested and transported to the shoreline where loggers 
and tug crews moved the sawlogs into the water where they are boomed together as 
one large floating island and then towed to the mills for processing (see Figure 10.2).
Where and when our log-patrolling enterprise became active was whenever the 
log driving of the log-boom loose aggregations making their way to designated pro­
cessing centers and pulp mills along the coast. Inevitably it seems that every time the 
log booms were towed to the destinations, some of the logs would become free and 
driven and guided by the tides and current flow in the channel.
It was these errant floaters that we were pursuing; these harvested logs are valu­
able and to us “green gold”—to others potential hazards. Once the logs are free they 
become navigation hazards. Imagine, for instance, a family cruising the Straight at

high speed that runs into a log submerged just below the water surface. Disaster for 
sure and sometimes of the fatal variety.
Once these wayward logs are free and creating navigational hazards they are 
also free game for log patrollers like we were. So, we patrolled the waters within the 
Straight, along Vancouver Island up to the Salish Sea which is the entrance to the 
Pacific Ocean. My job on the craft was to jump onto one of the errant logs we found 
and to peg them with the butt end of my ax—I almost joined the realm of Davy Jones 
more than once, but in my youth never gave it a second or third thought; not until 
today that is.
Anyway, after capturing the free-floating logs, we hauled them to various logging 
companies and pulp mills, where we were able to sell premium logs for up to $35 per 
log. Financially we make small fortunes, and whenever we captured pristine, uncut 
logs that ended up in the water through wind, erosion, and storm events, we were able 
to make a pretty penny more for each log.
The truth be told, it was the storms that made our days, so to speak. Storms broke 
up log booms, damaged growing trees, and sent many to the watery environment 
waiting for capture. Winter time was our best hunting season, for sure. Also, when 
floating logs became sparse and harder to fine, we simply turned to beachcombing 
because there always seemed to be fallen timber, broken tree limbs and driftwood of 
one sort or another. These fallen giants and other components were rather easy for 
us to take hold of. Our restored, sea worthy and powerful former landing craft was 
perfect for beachcombing because it could beach the nose of the craft ashore. We 
were going to salvage the wood that washed onto the beach, the driftwood or fallen 
trees. After beaching, two of us would jump out onto the beach and I would peg 
whatever remnant we could and attached a bow tow line and use our onboard winch 
to the logs to the edge of the beach. If there were other fallen trees, components and 
driftwood close to pegging the first log, we would hook up to as many as 6 at a time 
and eventually would backout into the waterway with our tows and quickly shift the 
towing lines to the stern of the boat and follow the waterway to whatever mill we 
could easily reach—and paying the highest prices for our tows.
This enterprise of log patrolling was lucrative, and we made lots of money. And 
of course that was our goal, our intention. Also, we cleaned up the beaches and 
removing hazardous floating and partially submerged logs. We also captured drift 
lumber—includes the remains of human-made wooden objects, such as buildings 
and their contents washed into the sea during storms, discarded wooden objects 
discarded into the water from shore, dropped dunnage of lost cargo (like logs) from 
ships (jetsam), and the remains of shipwrecked wooden ships and boats (aka flot­
sam). After a few log-patrolling adventures where we captured loose logs and drift­
wood and towed to sell to the mills, we also determined that we could make some 
money by collecting driftwood that could be used as part of decorative furniture or 
other as a popular element in the scenery in fish tanks. When we found the decora­
tive driftwood we had no problem selling it.
Presently (2023), now in my old age, I remember the adventure of capturing rouge 
timber with great fondness and great glee and the warmth of accomplishing an early 
challenge. This feeling is not related to the money I made during the time but mostly 
due to the once-in-a-lifetime adventure of it all. And surprisingly, in those youthful 

122
The Science of Ocean Pollution
adventures, I became interested in the science involved with the whole thing, the 
whole wet world of oceans and freshwater sources.
You gained an interest in science?
Yes.
What science?
My interest in science was pegged, so to speak, toward the end of our log-
patrolling adventures. We would on occasion get to the mouth of the Pacific Ocean 
and recover partially submerged logs to peg, tow and drop off at the mill. I found out 
quickly by jumping onto a large free-floating log and I immediately lost footdrift­
ers age and went into the drink. When I attempted to climb onto the log I could not 
because of the slime that covered the log; one of the slickest surfaces I ever tried to 
gain. Thus, I would simply swim to the forward ladder and climb safely onto the 
boat.
Besides recognizing and understanding the driftwood is a major nuisance I also 
found doing my research in a local Seattle library (no Internet or PCs in those days) 
several publications that described the ecology of driftwood or more importantly 
of what are known as deep ocean drifters. I learned about ocean drifters and their 
tendency to sink eventually and then later rise partially to the surface.
I also learned about the lifeforms that attached to dead trees. First, the upright 
variety of dead trees offers vital habitat to certain birds and bats, and when the 
dead tree is horizontal on the forest floor, it is a bonanza for life, including future 
trees. Note that tree falls basically rot in place, but many of them have a natural 
afterlife—a watery afterlife and morph from land ecological systems but also into 
traveling trees, going with the flow. And, of course, it was these floating logs with 
their attached lifeforms that we pursued at the entrance to the Pacific Ocean, where 
they would eventually turn into deep ocean drifters, ghosts of from distant forests 
and previous shipwrecks that can end up far at sea.
The deep ocean drifters are not as hazardous as plastic trash is to the ocean and 
the Great Garbage Patches and can actually house an environment for living organ­
isms. What these deep ocean drifters are is really a fragile ecological link between 
land and water.
It is important to note, after my years of studying ocean waste, that all the news 
about deep ocean drifters is bad or harmful to the ocean environment. This is cer­
tainly the case for lifeforms that form ecological systems on and within the wooden 
mass. These deep ocean drifters not only feed and shelters lots of microbes (biofilm) 
but can also colonize unreachable habitats, and as passengers on the ocean currents, 
they will eventually enter the realm of the Great Ocean Garbage Patches. And herein 
lies, the problem because although the deep ocean drifters decompose with two 
years, some pieces last much longer under certain conditions and become obstacles, 
hazardous members for navigation through the Great Ocean Garbage Patches. As 
driftwood is seaward large patches of driftwood sometimes collect at a waterway’s 
mouth and many of these drifters, we were able to collect and tow to the mills. 
Many of the deep ocean drifters provide homes for decomposers and other microbes, 
and this is not a problem. The deep oceans drifters eventually become part of the 

123
Log Patrol
Patches, and until they totally decompose, they can be navigational hazards even 
within remote deep ocean regions. The drifting logs form floating reefs that host a 
large variety of marine wildlife. I remember observing wingless water striders (sea 
skaters), the only insects known to inhabit the deep ocean areas and they lay their 
eggs on the floating wood. Later in my travels about U.S. Naval ships, I also observed 
and studied marine woody debris on the margins of the Great Pacific Ocean Patch. 
From observation and study, I found that the decaying log surfaces host a specific 
succession of tenants. In the first stage of decay, wood-decaying bacteria and fungi, 
along with a few other invertebrates that make wood-degrading enzymes, including 
gribbles—tiny crustaceans that bore into wood and plant material including seaweed 
and seagrass for ingestion of food. The gribbles, when they bore into the wood, are 
creating burrows that other animals exploit. The cellulose in the wood is digested 
and later the wood can become spongy and friable (The Virtual Ranger, 2007). Later 
I noted that secondary colonizers like talitrids (aka driftwood hoopers), as well as 
isopods, insect larvae, termites and some ants comprise the secondary colonizers. 
The gribbles aren’t the only animals that bore into the wood. There are also bivalve 
mollusks like shipworms, and wood piddocks that commonly occur in waterlogged 
timbers.
Eventually, the deep ocean drifters undergo “wood fall,” whereby the timber 
finally sinks to the sea bed where they undergo further decomposition and provide 
a new ecosystem whereby they are inhabited by different communities of creatures 
that work to finish the timber off. When this occurs, the wood is converted to wood 
drops that in turn support other invertebrates.
THE BOTTOM LINE
Deep ocean drifters make a transformative journey in the vast oceans. The fact that 
they eventually decompose and while doing so allow hitchhikers of several different 
types of organisms to create a temporary habitat is not, as stated earlier, all that bad. 
The problem is that before these drifters sink to the sea bottom and are decomposed 
to bits they end up in the Great Ocean Patches and become holding platforms for all 
types of trash; thus, they help to enlarge the Patches, and this is not good side of the 
deep ocean drifters.

Other Assorted 
Containers and Packaging
INTRODUCTION
USEPA defines containers and packaging as products that are assumed to be dis­
carded the same year the products they contain are purchased. Unfortunately, many 
of these containers and packaging end up in the ocean. In addition, containers and 
packaging make up a major portion of municipal solid waste (MSW), amounting to 
more than 82 million tons of generation in 2017 (28% of total generation). Packaging 
is the product used to wrap or protect goods, including food, beverages, medications 
and cosmetic products. Containers and packaging are used in the shipping, storage 
and protection of products. They also provide sales and marketing benefits.
With regard to recycling containers and packaging it is corrugated boxes that are 
among the most frequently recycles products. In 2017, the recycling rate of generated 
packing and containers was 53%. Additionally, the combustion of containers and 
packaging was 7 million tons (21% of total combustion with energy recovery) and 
landfills received 30 million tons (20.5% of total landfilling) in 2017.
Containers and packaging products in MSW are made of several materials: paper 
and paperboard, glass, steel, aluminum, plastics, wood and small amounts of other 
materials (USEPA, 2021).
Glass Containers and Packaging
When we point out that various glass containers and packaging materials are a sig­
nificant part of the almost endless list of waste materials dumped into the oceans 
we are not referring pointedly and specifically to a “message in a glass bottle” (see 
Figure 11.1) pollution. A message in a bottle has been a form of communication dat­
ing back to early historical times. This is not to say that a message in a bottle is not 
pollution because it is; the growing awareness that bottles constitute waste that can 
harm the environment and marine life has triggered the trend in favor of using bio­
degradable drift cases and wooden blocks instead of glass bottles carrying messages, 
of any type or form (see Figure 11.1).
Glass containers typically found as ocean waste include beer and soft drink bot­
tles, wine and liquor bottles, as well as bottles and jars for food and juices, cosmetics 
and other products. Beginning in 2009, the Glass Packaging Institute provided pro­
duction data and various regulatory agencies, such as USEPA, and other interested 
parties use the information as needed. About 70% of glass consumption is used for 
containers and packaging purposes (Pongracz, 2007). From this information USEPA 
estimated that 9.1 million tons of glass containers were generated in 2015, or 3.5% of 
municipal solid waste (MSW). At least 13.2% of the production of glass and contains

are burned with energy recovery. The amount of glass containers and packaging 
going into the land fill is about 53% (USEPA, 2021).
Steel Containers and Packaging
It is relatively rare to find or run into steel containers and packaging in the oceans. 
This is the case because only about 5% of steel is used for packaging purposes; this 
is in sharp contrast to the total world of steel consumption. World production of steel 
containers and packaging amounted to 2.2 million tons in 2018 (0.8%) of total MSW 
generation. Most of this amount was represented by cans used for food products. 
Approximately 1.6 million tons (73%) of steel packaging were recycled. Also, the 
steel packaging that was combusted with energy recovery was about 5%, and 21% 
were landfilled (USEPA 2021).
Paper and Paperboard Containers and Packaging
“Go float your boat.” This is something many of us hear when children and maybe 
later as adults. For those not familiar with this saying, it refers to the taking of a 
single piece of paper and folding it in such a fashion so as to make it “sea or bathtub 
worthy,” so to speak. The reference here is to the paper used. Ocean waste consisting 
of paper and cardboard containers and corrugated boxes and other paper and card­
board packaging, and not handmade paper boats.

Other Assorted Containers and Packaging
Corrugated boxes were the largest single product category of MSW in 2018 at 
33 million tons generation, or 11% of total generation. Corrugated boxes also repre­
sent eh largest single product of recycled paper and paperboard containers and pack­
aging. In 2018, approximately 32 million tons of corrugated boxes were recycled 
out 34 million tons of total paper and paper board recycling. The recycling rate 
for corrugated boxes was 230,000 tons, and landfills received 940,000 tons in 2018 
(USEPA, 2021).
Other paper and paperboard packaging found in water bodies including the 
marine environment includes milk and juice cartons and other products packaged 
in gable top cartons and liquid food aseptic cartons, fold cartons (e.g., cereal boxes 
frozen food boxes), some department store boxes, bag, and sacks, wrapping papers, 
and other paper and paperboard packaging (primarily set-up boxes such as she, cos­
metic and candy boxes). Overall, paper and paperboard containers and packaging 
totaled about 42 million tons of MSW generation in 2018, or 14% of total generation 
(USEPA, 2021).
Recycling of corrugated boxes is by far the largest component of paper packag­
ing recycling. Additionally, smaller amounts of other paper packaging products also 
enter the recycling stream (estimated at about 1.8 million tons in 2018). The overall 
recycling rate for paper and paperboard packaging was 81% in 2018. Smaller propor­
tions were combusted for energy recovery (3.7%) and landfilled (15.4%). Other paper 
packaging, such as sacks and cartons, is mostly recycled as mixed paper (USEPA, 
2021).
Back to go floating your boat. If you are into floating handmade boats composed 
only of wood and paper this type of simple float device is made of materials that are 
fully biodegradable and is therefore not considered a waste product or a contamina­
tor of marine environments.
Wood Containers and Packaging
Wood packaging includes anything made out of wood, mostly wood pallets, wood 
chips, boards, planks, including wood crates. USEPA used data, the production of 
wood packaging derived from purchased market research and research from the 
Center for Forest Products at Virginia Tech and the United States Department of 
Agriculture’ Forest Service Southern Research Station. In 2018, the data collected 
indicated that the amount of generated wood pallets and other wood packaging was 
11.5 million tons, totaling 4% of total MSW generation. The amount of wood pal­
let recycling (usually by chipping for uses such as mulch or bedding material, but 
excluding wood combusted as fuel) in 2018 was about 3 million tons (USEPA, 2021). 
Additionally, about 14% of the wood containers and packaging waste generated was 
combusted with energy recovery, while the remained (59%) was landfilled.
Miscellaneous Packaging
Other miscellaneous packaging includes bags made of textiles (rags, clothing, sheets, 
blankets, etc.) and small amounts of leather. Estimates about the dumping of these 
materials are the only data currently available; however, UESPA estimated that the 

128
The Science of Ocean Pollution
amount generated was 340,000 tons in 2018, and none of which was recycled or com­
posted. Approximately 21% of the other miscellaneous packaging was combusted 
with energy recovery, while the majority was landfilled (79%) (USEPA, 2021).
THE BOTTOM LINE ON OCEAN DUMPING
Simply, throwing waste into the ocean, whether intentional or otherwise, is perform­
ing the act of ocean dumping. To fully understand the danger of this occurrence, 
which is not to be taken lightly, it is necessary to summarize the impacts of ocean 
dumping. These impacts include:
•	 filthy beaches
•	 toxic water
•	 reduced dissolved oxygen in the water
•	 malnutrition in marine creatures
•	 entangled marine creatures
•	 poisonous sea life
•	 human health problems
•	 damaged sea creature internal organs
•	 continued growth of ocean garbage patches
•	 proliferation of invasive specifies
•	 increased dead zones
•	 increased death rate of sea birds
•	 hinders photosynthesis for marine plants
•	 disrupts food chain
•	 damage coral reef
Again, we know the culprit of any type of nonnatural pollution, and the culprit 
is us.

Industrial Sea Pollution
INTRODUCTION
In 1966–1968, during the Viet Nam War I served on a US Naval ship as an enlisted 
electrician. My job mostly entailed rewinding electric motors for 7th Fleet ships that 
had electric motor failures and sent them to my shop to be repaired. Seemed like I 
always had at least one burned up motor to rewind. We also had other shops that per­
formed other repair activities such as machining new parts, molding new parts and 
replacing electrical and mechanical components for other ships’ equipment.
We successfully accomplished whatever repair assignment that we were given 
while we sailed from place to place in the South China Sea and while berthed in 
Danang Harbor, South Vietnam.
I mention this timeframe while assigned to the Naval ship for providing repair 
functions to other ships because there was a practice, at that time, whereby repair 
technicians like me in our repairing removed the failed parts and thousands of 
pounds of copper wire removed from burned up motor coils and dumped all into the 
South China Sea (not in Danang Harbor).
Today, I often wonder how our dumping practice was tolerated by all, including 
myself. I often imagine the South China Sea’s bottom or sea bed is a repository for 
countless pieces of what we called junk, trash and so forth. The thinking at the time 
aboard the ships during that period was twofold: First, throwing away what we called 
junk into the sea made more room available for the accumulation of more junk to 
pile up before we also deep-sixed it. Secondly, having grown up in a “throw-away 
society” we never gave a first, second or third thought about throwing the junk into 
Davy Jones Locker—satisfying the old idiom: out of sight is out of mind.
But it is still in my mind; dumb moves are sometimes unforgettable.
Note: In this book, pollution and environmental damage are synonymous.
OCEAN INDUSTRIES
In my studies of ocean industries and the types of ocean pollutants that they dis­
charge into ocean environments, I found eight industries in what some call the ocean 
economy, ocean enterprise or New Blue Economy. These industries are depicted in 
Figure 12.1 and they include offshore oil and gas, marine equipment and construc­
tion, seafood production and processing, container shipping, shipbuilding and repair, 
cruise tourism, port activities and offshore wind.
From Figure 12.1, it is obvious that the ocean is a key and growing source of food, 
energy and minerals, and the majority of world trade relies on ocean transportation.
Approximately 40% of the world’s population live in coastal regions, and three-
quarters of the world’s large cities are located on the coast (United Nations, 2017).

•	 Offshore oil and gas
•	 Waste disposal
Offshore Wind Industry
Matters related to providing sustainable options and to preventing climate change by 
potentially prohibiting and/or reducing the use of fossil fuels have spurred growth in 
the renewable energy industry. Wind power is one of these renewable energy sectors/
providers. Wind onshore power construction/application/operation with wind farms 
and individual wind turbines has been on-line in the United States (and many other 
countries) for several years. In the past decade, there has been increased interest in 
construction/application/operation of offshore wind farms. This increased interest 
in offshore wind farms has a few significant advantages over onshore wind farms: in 
terms of power, offshore winds are generally more constant, stronger and less turbu­
lent winds than onshore wind farms; increased winds offshore lead to an increase in 
the production of electricity as compared to onshore wind farms.
Basically, as with just about anything human-made, there is a good and a bad side. 
In this book, it is the bad or pollution side of industrial sector work, including wind 
power, that concerns us. The point is whether we call it a breeze, air current, cur­
rent of air, gale, hurricane, draft, zephyr, sea breeze or the all inclusive general term 
“wind” or by any other name, one thing is certain; Earth’s wind has a good and bad 
side. In this regard and for the truth be known, wind can be said to have a Dr. Jekyll 
and Mr. Hyde personality or characteristic or aspect; that is, again, like the two well-
known literary personalities, one side is good, and the other side is bad. The bad 
or negative characteristics of wind are tornadoes, hurricanes, movement of pollen 
and mold (allergens) and the causation of waves in lakes and oceans that can cause 
destructive flooding. Wind erosion is another bad aspect and is a main geomorpho­
logical influence, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. It is also a major source 
of land desertification, degradation, harmful airborne dust and crop damage—espe­
cially when being magnified far above natural rates by anthropogenic activities such 
as agriculture, deforestation and urbanization. This is the “Mr. Hyde” or bad side of 
wind. The “Dr. Jekyll” or good side of wind onshore and to some extent offshore that 
affects world circulation of weather patterns, pollinates plants, reduces air pollu­
tion via air circulation, moves warm breezes that comfort us and provides energy to 
produce wind power. However, it is this providing of energy to produce wind power 
offshore, one of the “bad sides” of wind of offshore wind turbine operation, which is 
the focus of this section.
The bottom line: it is important to keep in mind that the good and/or bad aspects 
of wind are essential to Earth’s natural processes, all of which are generated with and 
by the urges or whims of Mother Nature.
Good, Bad and Worse
Good:	
As long as Earth exists, the wind will always exist. The energy 
in the winds that blow across the United States each year could 

132
The Science of Ocean Pollution
produce more than 16 billion GJ of electricity—more than one and 
on-half times the electricity consumed in the United States in 2000.
Bad:	
Turbines are expensive. Wind doesn’t blow all the time, so they 
have to be part of a larger plan. Turbines make noise. Turbine 
blades kill birds.
Ugly:	
Some look upon giant wind turbine blades cutting through the air 
as grotesque scars on the landscape, visible polluters.
The bottom line:	 Do not expect Don Quixote, mounted in armor on his old nag, 
Rocinante, with or without Sancho Panza, to gallop on water and 
charge those offshore windmills. Instead, expect—you can count 
on it, bet on it and rely on it—that the charge to build those wind­
mills will be done by the rest of us, to satisfy our growing, inexo­
rable need for renewable energy. What other choice do we have?
F. R. Spellman (2022)
The potential environmental impact of wind energy during site development/
evaluation, site construction, and site operations and maintenance are discussed in 
the following sections.
Offshore Site Environmental Impacts
Offshore site evaluation phase activities, such as monitoring and testing, are temporary 
and are conducted at a smaller scale than those at the construction and operation phases. 
Potential impacts of these activities are presented below by type of affected resource. 
The impacts described are for typical site evaluation and exploration activities, such as 
seabed clearing (removal of natural cover), borings for geotechnical surveys and guy 
wire installation, and position of equipment, such as meteorological towers.
Impact to air quality during monitoring and testing activities would cause tempo­
rary and local generation of vehicle emissions and fugitive dust. These impacts are 
unlikely to cause an exceedance of air quality standards, or impact climate change.
Impact to aquatic habitat occurs during site monitoring and testing.
Ecological impact on avian life can be extensive because during migration peri­
ods millions of birds of various species cross various seas on their journey between 
their breeding grounds in North America, northern Asia, Scandinavia and their win­
ter quarters (Dierschke, 2003). These particular areas are notorious for their huge 
bird populations; thus, it is clear that installation of offshore windfarms has some 
consequences for avian life. Research has shown that offshore wind farms must be 
sited in open, exposed areas with high wind speeds and avian life can be impacted 
in areas that provide habitats for breeding, wintering and migration. Direct mortality 
from striking turbine blades is only part of the problem. The other parts include the 
towers, nacelles and associated structures such as cables, power lines and meteoro­
logical masts (Drewitt & Langston, 2006).
The overall pollution effects (that we know of or speculate about) of offshore wind 
turbine installation and operation include:
•	 Biodiversity loss
•	 Decrease in fish populations

133
Industrial Sea Pollution
•	 Visual pollution (some people think wind turbines are ugly)
•	 Water pollution
•	 Navigation hazard
•	 Endangerment and extinction of species
•	 Loss of livelihood for locals
•	 Effects on aquatic plants
•	 Destruction of aquatic habitats
With regard to destruction or loss of aquatic habitats, wind farms push out resident 
birds. Also construction of wind farms may create “reef effect” (i.e., artificial reef 
effect) in which the base of the wind turbines becomes temporary habits for mol­
lusks. Moreover, during the construction phase noise levels are increased and many 
wonder if this noise is beaching whales along the East Coast. Ohman and Sigray 
(2007) have argued that during the construction phase sedimentation and noise could 
influence fish and other marine organism. Then there are the underwater cables; 
these can influence marine animals due to the electromagnetic fields that the electric 
current in the cables induces. Wind turbine farms also affect fisheries. Fishing may 
be restricted, less frequented or closed. The artificial reefs may also become habitat 
for invasive species.
Ocean Development
In ocean development activities, the construction of any ocean enterprise disturbs 
the natural environment and basically pollutes the site via disturbance of the site’s 
aquatic environment.
Biodiversity Loss
Pollution effects on ocean biodiversity occur anytime the natural marine environ­
ment is tampered with, modified or destroyed by human activities.
Decrease in Fish Populations
Ocean pollution affects living conditions for fish. Certain pollutants decrease oxy­
gen content in the water, poison the water, kill off food that fish need to eat—so, 
when oxygen is low, poison enters the scene and destroy foodstuffs that fish need to 
survive.
Wind Turbine Visual Pollution
Some people see wind turbines ashore or offshore as eyesores. Some people view 
wind turbines as obstructers of a person’s view of a seascape or spoils a scene of 
natural beauty. The truth be told beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and therefore 
this type of pollution is subjective. Wind turbines are large, enormous with a stan­
dard height of around 70 m, and with blades approximately 50 m in length.
Wind Turbine Navigation Hazards
Wind turbines can interfere with navigation radar and also many of their structures 
occupy busy shipping lanes whereby forcing ships to use alternate routes which can 
lead to the piling up of ships in narrow and congested waters leading to possible col­
lisions at sea.

134
The Science of Ocean Pollution
Destruction of Aquatic Habitats
During construction as well as during operation of offshore wind farms, marine 
habitats are unsettled and destroyed.
Destruction of Aquatic Plants
Construction and operation of offshore wind turbine farms disrupts and destroys 
aquatic plants.
Loss of Livelihood for Local Populations
Local inhabitants along coastal areas where wind farms are sited and operated can 
suffer economically from changes, disruption to various normal living conditions.
Water Pollution
Construction and operation of offshore wind farms can cause water pollution from 
construction activities, by the noise generated during construction and turbine opera­
tion, by acoustic vibration, by metal contamination associated with corrosive seawa­
ter activities that change the quality of the water.
Ship Building and Repair
Ship building and repair is one of the on-going industrial activities that is not only 
important, necessary and vital to maintaining a strong economy with uninterrupted 
ocean and waterway supply chains but it can also be hazardous to the environment, 
waterways and oceans. Tremendous amounts of metal and other hazardous chemical 
and materials are used in ship construction and in some ship repair activities. Note 
that adverse effects to personal health and the environment are spawned by ship 
building and repair activities such as welding, painting, blasting and fiberglass pro­
duction. Moreover, water quality takes a direct detrimental hit whenever shipbuild­
ing and repair wastes and pollutants are released into the environment.
Desalination of Salt Water
The desalination of salt water industry processes enormous amounts of seawater 
every day worldwide. In addition to the enormous amounts of seawater desalted to 
fresh water, enormous amounts of waste brine are also produced. These pollutants 
are dumped back into the seawater contaminating the water and affecting aquatic 
life within.
Aquaculture Industry
The aquaculture industry is gaining in popularity worldwide but is largely practiced 
in China. Recently, the negative effects of waste from aquaculture to aquatic envi­
ronment are becoming increasingly recognized. These negative effects are mani­
fested when aquaculture facilities discharge into the ocean. Typically, because feed 
and fertilizer are used to enhance to the maximum, these effluents are enriched with 
nitrogen, phosphorus, organic matter and suspended solids, all of which contribute to 

135
Industrial Sea Pollution
water body eutrophication. Recall that Eutrophication is another type of floating sea 
pollution; it is the process of enrichment of water bodies by nutrients. The problem 
is that when nutrients in water bodies increase it causes a serious decrease in oxygen 
levels and in floating seas causes dead zones.
Algaculture Industry
Algaculture is a relatively new enterprise using modern technology. The problem is 
that certain pesticides must be used to control algal growth. It is important that we 
do not contaminate that which is not intended.
Marine Biotechnology Industry
Consisting of many sub-fields, marine biotechnology studies the marine resources 
of the world.
So, what is the marine biotechnology process? The marine biotechnology is the 
process that involves the marine resources of the world that are studied in biotech­
nology applications.
Okay, so what are biotechnology applications? The applications are multi-faceted 
and utilized in numerous tasks, such as using marine organisms and seaweed grown 
in local farms to derive new cancer treatments. Marine biotechnologists view the 
marine environment as a treasure trove of biological and chemical assortment among 
all types of ecosystems. Marine biotechnologists focus on developing new drugs 
from marine resources. Moreover, marine technologists also focus on the reaches of 
ocean depths and locations where little-known forms of deep-ocean life reside. Note 
that because there is the growing use of marine life in the food, cosmetic and agri­
cultural industries, such as aquaculture, marine biotechnologists attempt to harness 
the potential of the marine environment for human benefit (Thakur & Thakur, 2006; 
De Jesus-Ayson, 2011; Pomponi, 1999).
Well, from the above information just provided you might be wondering with all 
the positive aspects presented about Marine Biotechnology, what is the problem, the 
worry, the drawback and/or the problem? I have studied Marine Biotechnology for 
the past 15 years, in great detail, to know that what we are doing appears to be good 
science. And I believe this is true but what worries me is that we are in the beginning 
stages of learning as much as possible about the technology without knowing what 
we do not know—what we do not know about the risk side.
Carbon Sequestration Industry
As part of the grand scheme to protect the Earth from climate change, the carbon 
sequestration (better known as carbon capture and sequestration, CCS) tactic is 
being supported to help reduce the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted into the 
Earth’s atmosphere. When stated straightforwardly and in simplistic terms by sup­
porters of CCS as a means to protect Earth’s environment, it is a concept that seems 
to have widespread support in some sectors where climate change is an alarming 
concept.

136
The Science of Ocean Pollution
Having spent a lifetime studying and teaching the potential impact of global cli­
mate change, I have kept an open mind to at least listening to the various proposed 
actions that can or could reduce the amount of global CO2 emissions and to in some 
way, somehow mitigate the issue.
When I am focused on this issue, one thought always enters my mind about a point 
of view that one of my students in one of my college grad/undergrad environmental 
health classes related to me and a full class of students at the end of December 2014.
The student: “I don’t get all this worry about excessive CO2 emissions here on 
Earth … it stands to reason that the more CO2 that we have the more plants, trees, 
forests we will have … more CO2 will simply turn Earth into more jungle and the 
plants and trees therein will feel all of us more oxygen … I don’t get the worry.”
Well, after this profound statement by the open-minded, far-thinking students, 
there was a moment of silence in the classroom. I even wondered if we were all 
breathing again. Well, fortunately we were.
Anyway, after a minute or so of silence, I pointed out that the student must have 
read the NASA’s December 29, 2014 statement titled, “NASA Finds Good News 
On Forests and Carbon Dioxide.” In a nutshell, what the NASA article stated is 
that tropical forests may be absorbing far more carbon dioxide than many scien­
tists thought, in response to rising atmospheric levels of the greenhouse gas (NASA, 
2014). Tropical forest is synonymous with jungle, so I think my open-minded student 
had something to think about, for sure.
Anyway, the major problem with CCS is that when CO2 is captured and stored, it 
has not gone away, it has simply been sequestered (hidden—stored).
Problem?
Yes, the greatest environmental risk associated with CCS relates to the long-term 
storage of the captured CO2. What if there is a leak? If a gradual or catastrophic leak 
occurs, what then?
Fishing Industry
Ocean pollution as a result of the fishing industry can be effected by throwing waste 
into the oceans but the primary contributor to ocean pollution is derelict fishing gear. 
Derelict fishing gear (see Figure 12.2) is the gear that is lost and discarded and no 
longer under the control of a commercial or recreational fisher.
Offshore Oil and Gas Industry
When oil is spilled, it can cause big problems. Oil spills can harm sea creatures, 
contaminate beaches and make seafood unsafe to eat. Oil spills are quite common. 
Thousands of oil spills occur in the oceans each year. Many of these spills are small 
but they can cause extensive damage.
Bioprospecting and Mineral Industries
Have you ever wondered what is hidden in the vast oceans of the globe? What sea 
animal lurks in the Hadal Zone (i.e., the deepest areas of the oceans)? There certainly 

137
Industrial Sea Pollution
have been many stories and personal accounts written about the oceans. Maybe you 
have read accounts about the open and deep-ocean beds being goldmines, huge 
crocks of gold—a sea full of treasures. And the truth be told, this is the case.
We know that the oceans are vast area containing valuable minerals and biologi­
cal ingredients for medical use. Because of the speculation about ocean’s valuable 
contents, on-going research and exploring are beginning to gain momentum.
It is this extraction of precious minerals that is of concern to us—with regard to 
ocean pollution. It was often assumed that dredging or employing some other tech­
nology used in the extraction of minerals and nodules on the sea floor would only 
cause a small disturbance of the extraction site’s water column. However, present 
practice in ocean extraction of minerals has demonstrated that the disturbance of 
the extraction zone or spot caused plumes of fine substances on the ocean floor. This 
plume is hazardous to the delicate sea life and sends contamination upward and in 
other directions to over 600 feet. The point is that when we continue and accelerate 
the mining the ocean pollution is to be expected.
Offshore Wind and Tide Power
In order to support our lifestyles, that is, for those fortunate to be living the “good 
life,” energy resources are needed.1 In pursuit of energy that will not contribute 
to climate change and pollution, one alternative renewable energy source gaining

138
The Science of Ocean Pollution
attention is the oceans. This includes wave kinetic energy, tidal energy and ocean 
thermal energy conversion.
Ocean Tides and Waves
Water is the master sculptor of Earth’s surfaces. The ceaseless, restless motion of 
the sea is an extremely effective geologic agent. Besides shaping inland surfaces, 
water sculpts the coast. Coasts include sea cliffs, shores and beaches. Seawater set in 
motion erodes cliffs, transports eroded debris along shores and dumps it on beaches. 
Therefore, most coasts retreat or advance. In addition to the unceasing causes of 
motion—wind, density of seawater and rotation of the earth—the chief agents in this 
process are tides, currents and waves.
The periodic rise and fall of the sea (once every twelve hours and twenty-six 
minutes) produces the tides. Tides are due to the gravitational attraction of the moon 
and, to a lesser extent, the sun on the Earth. The moon has a larger effect on tides and 
causes the Earth to bulge toward the moon. It is interesting to note that at the same 
time the moon causes a bulge on Earth, a bulge occurs on the opposite side of the 
Earth due to inertial forces. The effect of the tides is not too noticeable in the open 
sea, the difference between high and low tide amounting to about 2 feet. The tidal 
range may be considerably greater near shore, however. It may range from less than 
2 feet to as much as 50 feet. The tidal range will vary according to the phase of the 
moon and the distance of the moon from the Earth. The type of shoreline and the 
physical configuration of the ocean floor will also affect the tidal range.
Waves, varying greatly in size, are produced by the friction of wind on open 
water. Wave height and power depend upon wind strength and fetch—the amount 
of unobstructed ocean over which the wind has blown. In a wave, water travels in 
loops. Essentially an up-and-down movement of the water, the diameter of the loops 
decreases with depth. The diameter of loops at the surface is equal to wave height (h). 
Breakers are formed when the wave comes into shallow water near the shore. The 
lower part of the wave is retarded by the ocean bottom, and the top, having greater 
momentum, is hurled forward causing the wave to break. These breaking waves may 
do great damage to coastal property as the race across coastal lowlands driven by 
winds or gale or hurricane velocities.
The natural geological work of the sea consists of erosion, transportation and 
deposition. The sea accomplishes its work of coastal landform sculpting largely by 
means of waves and wave-produced currents; their effect on the seacoast may be 
quite pronounced. The coast and accompanying coastal deposits and landform devel­
opment represent a balance between wave energy and sediment supply.
Waves attack shorelines and erode by a combination of several processes. The 
resistance of the rocks composing the shoreline and the intensity of wave action to 
which it is subjected are the factors that determine how rapidly the shore will be 
eroded. Wave erosion works chiefly by hydraulic action, corrosion and attrition. As 
waves strike a sea cliff, hydraulic action crams air into rock crevices putting tremen­
dous pressure on the surrounding rock; as waves retreat, the explosively expanding 
air enlarges cracks and breaks off chunks of rock (scree). Chunks hurled by waves 
against the cliff break off more scree (via a sandpapering action)—a process called 
corrasion. The sea rubs and grinds rocks together forming scree that is thrown into 

139
Industrial Sea Pollution
the cliffs reducing broken rocks to pebbles and sand grains—a process called attri­
tion (Lambert, 2007). Several features are formed by marine erosion—different 
combinations of wave action, rock type and rock beds:
•	 Sea Cliffs or Wave-Cut Cliffs—these are formed by wave erosion of 
underlying rock followed by the caving-in of the overhanging rocks. As 
waves eat farther back inland, they leave a wave-cut beach or platform. 
Such cliffs are essentially vertical and are common at certain localities 
along the New England and Pacific coasts of North American.
•	 Wave-cut Bench—these are the result of wave action not having enough 
time to lower the coastline to sea level. Because of the resistance to erosion, 
a relatively flat wave-cut bench develops. If subsequent uplift of the wave-
cut bench occurs, it may be preserved above sea level as a wave-cut bench.
•	 Headlands—these are finger-like projections of resistant rock extending 
out into the water. Indentations between headlands are termed coves.
•	 Sea Caves, Sea Arches and Stacks—these are formed by continued wave 
action on a sea cliff. Wave action hollows out cavities or caves in the sea 
cliffs. Eventually, waves may cut completely through a headland to form a 
sea arch; if the roof of the arch collapses, the rock left separated from the 
headland is called a stack.
Marine deposition takes place whenever currents and waves suffer reduced veloc­
ity. Some rocks are thrown up on the shore by wave action. Most of the sediments 
thus deposited consist of rock fragments derived from the mechanical weathering of 
the continents, and they differ considerably from terrestrial or continental deposits. 
Due to input of sediments from rivers, deltas may form, and due to beach drift such 
features as spits and hooks, bay barriers, and tombolos may form. Depositional fea­
tures along coasts are discussed below.
•	 Beaches—these are transitory coastal deposits of debris which lie above 
the low-tide limit in the shore zone.
•	 Barrier Islands—these are long narrow accumulations of sand lying par­
allel to the shore and separated from the shore by a shallow lagoon.
•	 Spits and Hooks—these are elongated, narrow embankments of sand and 
pebble extending out into the water but attached by one end to the land.
•	 Tombolos—these are bars of sand or gravel connecting an island with the 
mainland or another island.
•	 Wave-built Terraces—these are structures built up from sediments depos­
ited in deep water beyond a wave-cut terrace.
Wave Energy
Again, waves are caused by the wind blowing over the surface of the ocean.2 In many 
areas of the world, the wind blows with enough consistency and force to provide con­
tinuous waves. Wave energy does not have the tremendous power of tidal fluctuations 
but the regular pounding of the waves should not be underestimated because there 
is tremendous energy in the ocean waves. The total power of waves breaking on the 

140
The Science of Ocean Pollution
world’s coastlines is estimated at between 2 and 3 million megawatts. In optimal 
wave areas, more than 65 megawatts of electricity could be produced along a single 
mile of shoreline, according to the US Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable 
Energy (EERE, 2004). In essence, because the wind is originally derived from the 
sun, we can actually consider the energy in ocean waves to be a stored, moderately 
high-density form of solar energy. According to certain estimates, wave technologies 
could feasibly fulfill 10% of the global electricity supply if fully developed (World 
Energy, 2010). The West Coasts of the United States and Europe and the coast of 
Japan and New Zealand are good sites for harnessing wave energy.
Three main processes create waves: (1) air flowing over the sea exerts a tangen­
tial stress on the water surface, resulting in the formation and growth of waves; (2) 
turbulent air flow close to the water surface creates rapidly varying shear stresses 
and pressure fluctuations (when these oscillations are in phase with existing waves, 
further wave development occurs); and (3) when waves have reached a certain size, 
the wind can exert a stronger force on the up-wind face of the wave, resulting in 
additional wave growth. Waves located within or close to the areas where they are 
generated are called storm waves; swell waves can develop at great distances from 
the point of origin. The distance over which wind energy is transferred into the 
ocean to form waves is called the fetch. Sea state is the general condition of the free 
surface on a large body of water—with respect to wind waves and swell—at a certain 
location and moment (Table 12.1).
The shape of a typical wave is described as sinusoidal (that is, it has the form of 
a mathematical sine function). The difference in height between the peaks troughs 
is known as the height, H, and the distance between successive peaks (or troughs) 
of the wave is known as the wavelength, λ. The time in seconds taken for succes­
sive peaks (or troughs) to pass a given fixed point is known as the period, T. The 
frequency, v, of the wave describes the number of peak-to-peak (or trough-to-trough) 
oscillations of the wave surface per second, as seen by a fixed observer, and is the 
reciprocal of the period. That is, v =1/T.

If a wave is traveling at velocity v past a given fixed point, it will travel a distance 
equal to its wavelength λ in a time equal to the wave period T (i.e., v = λ/T). The 
power, P, (Kw/m) of an idealized ocean wave is approximately equal to the square of 
the height, H (m), multiplied by the wave period, T (seconds). The exact expression 
is the following:
	
P

= g H T
where P is in units of watts/m and g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m s−2) 
(Phillips, 1977).
For deep-water waves, the velocity of a long ocean wave can be shown to be 
proportional to the period (if the depth of water is greater than about half of the 
wavelength λ) as follows:
	
2
=
π
v
gT
A useful approximation can be derived from this: velocity in meters/second is 
about 1.5 times the wave period in seconds. The result leads to deep-ocean waves 
traveling faster than the shorter waves. Moreover, if the above relationships hold, we 
can find the deep-water wavelength, λ, for any given wave period.

As the water becomes shallower, the properties of the waves become increasingly 
dominated by water depth. When waves reach shallow water, their properties are 
completely governed by the water depth, but in intermediate depths (i.e., between d = 
λ/4π) the properties of the waves will be influenced by both water depth d and wave 
period T (Phillips, 1977).
As waves approach the shore, the seabed starts to have an effect on their speed, 
and it can be shown that if the water depth d is less than a quarter of the wavelength, 
the velocity is given by:
	
= √
v

As waves propagate, their energy is transported. The energy transport velocity is 
the group velocity. As a result, the wave energy flux, through a vertical plane of unit 
width perpendicular to the wave propagation direction, equal to:

where cg is the group velocity (m/s).
While development of modern wave energy concerted dates back to 1799 (Ross, 
1995), the technology did not receive worldwide attention until the 1970s when an 
oil crisis occurred and Stephen Salter published a notable paper about the technol­
ogy in Nature in 1974 (Salter, 1974). In the early 1980s, after a significant drop 
in oil prices, technical setbacks and a general lack of confidence, progress slowed 
in the development of wave energy devices as a commercial source of electrical 
power. In the late 1990s, awareness of the depletion of traditional energy resources 
and the environmental impacts of the large utilization of fossil fuels significantly 
increase, thereby facilitating the development of green energy resources. The 
development of the wave energy technology grew rapidly, particularly in oceanic 
countries such as Ireland, Denmark, Portugal, the United Kingdom and the United 
States. Quite a few pre-commercial ocean devices were deployed. For example, a 
United States company, Ocean Power Technology, deployed one of their 150 kW 
wave energy conversion (WEC) systems in Scotland in 2011 (OPT, 2011). An Irish 
company, Wavebob, tested a one-quarter model in Galway Bay, Ireland, in 2006 
(Wavebob, 2011). In Denmark, the half-scale 600 kW Wave Star energy system 
was deployed at Hanstholm in 2009 (Wavestar, 2014), and a quarter and a half size 
model Wave Dragon was tested at Nissum Bredning in 2003 (Wave Dragon, 2014). 
Furthermore, international organizations, such as the International Energy Agency 
and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), are heavily involved in 
the development of wave energy devices. In 2001, the International Energy Agency 
established an Ocean Energy System Implementation Agreement to facilitate the 
coordination of ocean energy studies between countries (IEA-OES, 2011). In 2007, 
the IEC established an Ocean Energy Technical Committee to develop ocean energy 
standards (IEC, 2011).
In the early 1970s, the harnessing of wave power focused on using floating devices 
such as Cockerell Rafts (a wave power hydraulic device), Salter Duck (curved-cam-
like device that can capture 90% of waves for energy conversion), Rectifier (concerts 
A-C to D-C electricity) and the Clam (a floating rigid toroid—i.e., doughnut-
shaped—that converts wave energy to electrical energy). Wave energy converters 
can be classified in terms of their location: fixed to the seabed, generally in shallow 
water; floating offshore in deep water; or tethered in intermediate depths. At present, 
these floating devices are not cost effective and have very difficult moving problems.

The wave height increases with increases in:

143
Industrial Sea Pollution
So current practice is to move in shore, sacrificing some energy but fixed devices, 
according to Tovey (2005), have several advantages, including:
•	 easier maintenance
•	 easier to land on device
•	 no mooting problem
•	 easier power transmission
•	 enhanced productivity
•	 better design life
Wave energy devices can be classified by means of their reaction system, but it is 
often more instructive to discuss how they interact with the wave field. In this con­
text, each moving body may be listed as either displace or reactor:
•	 Displacer—this is the body moved by the waves. It might be a buoyant ves­
sel or a mass of water. If buoyant, the displacer may pierce the surface of 
the waves or be submerged.
•	 Reactor—this is the body that provides reaction to the displacer. As sug­
gested above, it could a body fixed to the seabed, or the seabed itself. It 
could also be another structure or mass that is not fixed but moves in such a 
way that reaction forces are created (e.g., by moving by a different amount 
or at different times). A degree of control over the forces acting on each 
body and/or acting between the bodies (particularly stiffness and damping 
characteristics) is often required to optimize the amount of energy captured.
In some designs, the reactor is actually inside the displacer, while in others it is an 
external body. Internal reactors are not subject to wave forces, but external ones may 
experience loads that cause them to move in ways similar to a displacer. This can 
be extended to the view that some devices do not have dedicated reactors at all, but 
rather a system of displacers whose relative emotion creates a reaction system. There 
are three types of well-known Wave Energy Conversion devices: Point absorbers, 
terminators and attenuators.
A point absorber is a floating structure that absorbs energy in all directions by 
virtue of its movements at or near the water surface. It may be designed so as to 
resonate—that its, move with larger amplitudes than the waves themselves. This 
feature is useful to maximize the amount of power that is available for capture. The 
power take-off system may take a number of forms, depending on the figuration of 
displacers/reactors.
DID YOU KNOW?
Hydro (water) Kinetic Energy is the energy possessed by a body of water 
because of its motion (KE = 1.2 mv2). Hydro-Static (at rest) Energy is the 
energy possessed by a body because of its position or location at an elevation 
or height above a reference or datum (PE = mgh).

144
The Science of Ocean Pollution
A terminator is also a floating structure that moves at or near the water surface, 
but it absorbs energy in only a single direction. The device extends in the direc­
tion normal to the predominant wave direction, so that as waves arrive, the device 
restrains them. Again, resonance may be employed and the power take-off system 
may take a variety of forms.
An attenuator device is a long floating structure like the terminator, but is orientated 
parallel to the waves rather than normal to them. It rides the waves like a ship and move­
ments of the device at its bow and along its length can be restrained so as to extract 
energy. A theoretical advantage of the attenuator over the terminator is that its area nor­
mal to the waves is small and therefore the forces it experiences are much lower.
The tides rise and fall in eternal cycles. Tides are changes in the level of the oceans 
caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and sun, and the rotation of the earth. The 
relative motions of these cause several different tidal cycles, including a semidiurnal 
cycle (with period 12 hours 25 minutes); a semi-monthly cycle—i.e., Spring or Neap 
Tides corresponding with the position of the moon; a semi-annual cycle—period about 
178 days which is associated with the inclination of the Moon’s orbit. This causes the 
highest spring tides to occur in March and September; and other long-term cycles—
e.g., a nineteen-year cycle of the moon. Nearshore water levels can vary up to 40 feet, 
depending on the season and local factors. Only about 20 locations have good inlets 
and a large enough tidal range—about 10 feet—to produce energy economically 
(USDOI 2010). The tide ranges have been classified as follows (Massenlink & Short, 1993):
•	 Micromareal, when the tidal range is less than 2 m
•	 Mesomareal, when the tidal rang is between 2 m and 4 m
•	 Macromareal, when the tidal range is higher than 4 m
Some of the oldest ocean energy technologies use tidal power. Tidal power is 
more predictable than solar power and wind energy. All coastal areas consistently 
experience two high and two low tides over a period of slightly greater than 24 hours. 
For those tidal differences to be harness into electricity, the difference between high 
and low tide must be at least 5 m, or more than 16 feet. There only about 40 sites 
on the earth with tidal ranges of this magnitude. Currently, there are no tidal power 
plants in the United States. However, conditions are good for tidal power generation 
in both the Pacific Northwest and the Atlantic Northeast regions of the country. Tidal 
energy technologies include the following:
•	 Tidal Barrages—a barrage or dam is a simple generation system for tidal 
plants that involves a dam, known as a barrage, across an inlet. Sluice gates 
DID YOU KNOW?
The Spring Tides have a range about twice that of neap tides, while the other 
cycles can cause further variations of up to 15%. The tidal range is amplified 
in estuaries, and in some situations, the shape of the estuary is such that near 
resonance occurs.

145
Industrial Sea Pollution
(gates commonly used to control water levels and flow rates) on the barrage 
allow the tidal basin to fill on the incoming high tides and to empty through 
the turbine system on the outgoing tide, also known as the ebb tide. There 
are two-way systems that generate electricity on both the incoming and 
outgoing tides. A potential disadvantage of a barrage tidal power system is 
the effect a tidal station can have on plants and animals in estuaries. Tidal 
barrages can change the tidal level in the basin and increase the amount of 
matter in suspension in the water (turbidity). They can also affect naviga­
tion and recreation.
•	 Tidal fences—these look like giant turnstiles. A tidal fence has vertical axis 
turbines mounted in a fence. All the water that passes is forced through the 
turbines. Some of these currents run at 5–8 knots (5.6–9 miles per hour) 
and generate as much energy as winds of much higher velocity. Tidal fences 
can be used in areas such as channels between two landmasses. Tidal fences 
are cheaper to install than tidal barrages and have less impact on the envi­
ronment tidal barrages, although they can disrupt the movement of large 
marine animals.
•	 Tidal turbine—these are basically wind turbines in the water that can be 
located anywhere there is a strong tidal flow (function best where coastal 
currents run at between 3.6 and 4.9 knots—4–5.5 mph). Because water is 
about 800 times denser than air, tidal turbines have to be much sturdier than 
wind turbines. Tidal turbines are heaver ad more expensive to builds but 
capture more energy.
Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion
The most plentiful renewable energy source in our planet by far is solar radiation: 
170,000 TW (170,000 × 1012 W) fall on Earth. Because of its dilute and erratic 
nature, however, it is difficult to harness. To do so, that is, to capture this energy, 
we must employ the use of large collecting areas and large storage capacities; these 
requirements are satisfied on Earth only by the tropical oceans. We are all taught 
at an early age that oceans (and water in general) cover about 71% (or 2/3rds) of 
Earth’s surface. In a fitting reference to the vast oceans covering the majority of 
Earth, Ambrose Bierce (1842–1914) commented: “A body of water occupying about 
two-thirds of the world made for man who has no gills.” So, true, we have no gills; 
thus, for those who look out upon those vast bodies of water that cover the surface 
they might ask: What is their purpose? And, of course, this is a good question with 
several possible answers. In regard to renewable energy, we can look out upon those 
vast seas and wonder: How can we use this massive storehouse of energy for our 
own needs? Because it is so vast and deep, it absorbs much of the heat and light that 
comes from the sun. One thing seems certain: Our origin, past, present and future, 
lies within those massive wet confines we call oceans.
Ocean Energy
The ocean is essentially a gigantic solar collector.3 The energy from the sun heats the 
surface water of the ocean. In tropical regions, the surface water can be 40 or more 

146
The Science of Ocean Pollution
degrees warmer than the deep water. This temperature difference can be used to pro­
duce electricity. Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) has the potential to pro­
duce more energy than tidal, wave and world energy combined. The OTEC systems 
can be open or closed. In a closed system, an evaporator turns warm surface water 
into stream under pressure. This steam spins a turbine generator to produce electricity. 
Water pumps bring cold deep water through pipes to a condenser on the surface. The 
cold water condenses the steam, and the closed cycle begins again. In an open system, 
the steam is turned into fresh water, and new surface water is added to the system. A 
transmission cable carries the electricity to the shore. The OTEC systems must have a 
temperature difference of about 25 degrees Celsius to operate. This limits OTEC’s use 
to tropical regions where the surface waters are very warm and there is deep cold water. 
Hawaii, with its tropical climate, has experimented with OTEC system since the 1970s. 
Because there are many challenges to widespread use, there are no large or major opera­
tions, but, at present, several experimental OTEC plants. Pumping the water is a giant 
engineering challenge. Because of this, OTEC systems are not very energy efficient. 
DON (2003) estimates it will probably be 10–20 years before the technology is available 
to produce and transmit electricity economically from OTEC systems.
The types of OTEC systems include the following:
•	 Closed-Cycle
These systems use fluid with a low-boiling point, such as ammonia, to rotate 
a turbine to generate electricity. Warm surface seawater is pumped through 
a heat exchanger where the lower-boiling-point fluid is vaporized. The 
expanding vapor turns the turbo-generator. Cold deep-seawater—pumped 
through a second heat exchanger—condenses the vapor back into a liquid, 
which is then recycled through the system.
•	 Open-Cycle
These systems use the tropical oceans’ warm surface water to make elec­
tricity. When warm seawater is placed in a low-pressure container, it boils. 
The expanding steam drives a low-pressure turbine attached to an electrical 
generator. The steam, which has left its salt behind in the lower pressure 
container, is almost pure fresh water. It is condensed back into a liquid by 
exposure to cold temperatures from deep-ocean water.
•	 Hybrid
These systems combine the features of both the closed-cycle and open-
cycle systems. In a hybrid system, warm seawater enters a vacuum chamber 
where it is flash-evaporated into steam, similar to the open-cycle evapora­
tion process. The steam vaporizes a lower-boiling-point fluid (in a closed-
cycle loop) that drives a turbine to produce electricity.
In summarizing the (General Pollution) impacts,4 that is, to highlight the environ­
mental impacts of new ocean energy and hydrokinetic technologies, the following 
is included here:
•	 alteration of ocean current or waves
•	 alteration of bottom, substrates and sediment transport/deposition

147
Industrial Sea Pollution
•	 alteration of bottom habitats
•	 impacts of noise
•	 effects of electromagnetic fields
•	 toxicity of chemicals
•	 interference with animal movements and migrations
•	 designs that incorporate moving rotors or blades also pose the potential for 
injury to aquatic organisms from strike or impingement
•	 ocean thermal energy conversion technologies have unique environmental 
impacts
The extraction of kinetic energy from river and ocean currents or tides will reduce 
water velocities in the vicinity (i.e., near field) of the project (Bryden et al., 2004). 
Large numbers of devices in a river will reduce water velocities, increase water sur­
face elevations and decrease flood conveyance capacity. These effects would be pro­
portional to the number and size of structures installed in the water. Rotors, foils, 
mooring and electrical cables, and field structures will all act as impediments to 
water movement. The resulting reduction in water velocities could, in turn, affect 
the transport and deposition of sediment, organisms living on or in the bottom sedi­
ments, and plants and animals in the water column. Conversely, moving rotors and 
foils might increase mixing in systems where salinity or temperature gradients are 
well defined. Changes in water velocity and turbulence will vary greatly, depending 
on distance from the structure. For small numbers of units, the changes are expected 
to dissipate quickly with distance and are expected to be only localized; however, 
for large arrays, the cumulative effects may extend to a greater area. The alterations 
of circulation/mixing patterns caused by large numbers of structures might cause 
changes in nutrient inputs and water quality, which could in turn lead to eutrophica­
tion, hypoxia and effects on the aquatic food web.
The presence of floating wave energy converters will alter wave heights and struc­
tures, both in the near field (within meters of the units or project) and, if installed in 
large numbers, potentially in the far field (extending meters to kilometers (km) out 
from the project). The above-water structures of wave energy converters will act as 
a localize barrier to wind and, thus, reduce wind-wave interactions. Michel et al. 
(2007) noted that many of the changes would not directly relate to environmental 
impacts; for example, impacts on navigational conditions, wave loads on adjacent 
structures and recreation on nearby beaches (e.g., surfing, swimming) might be 
expected. Reduced wave action could alter bottom erosion and sediment transport 
and deposition (Largier, Behrens & Robart, 2008).
Wave measurements at operating wave energy conversion projects have not yet 
been made, and the data will be technology and project-size specific. The potential 
reductions in wave heights are probably smaller than those for wind turbines due to 
the low profiles of wave energy devices. For example, ASR Ltd. (2007) predicted 
that operation of wave energy conversion devices at the proposed Wave Hub (a wave 
power research facility off the coast of Cornwall, UK;//htpp.www.wavehub.co.uk) 
would reduce wave height at shorelines 5–20 km away by 3–6%. Operation of six 
wave energy conversion buoys (WEC; a version of OPT’s PowerBuoys) in Hawaii 
was not predicted to impact oceanographic conditions (DON, 2003). This conclusion 

148
The Science of Ocean Pollution
was based on modeling analyses of wave height reduction due to both wave scatter­
ing and energy absorption. The proposed large spacing of buoy cylinders (51.5 m 
apart, compared to a buoy diameter of 4.5 m) resulted in predicted wave height 
reductions of 0.5% for a wave period (i.e., time in seconds, between the passage of 
consecutive wave crests past a fixed point) of 9 seconds (s) and less than 0.3% for a 
wave period of 15 s. Bochert and Zettler (2006) summarized the changes in wave 
heights that were predicted in various environmental assessments. Recognizing that 
impacts will be technology- and location-specific, estimated wave height reductions 
ranged from 3 to 15%, with maximum effects closet to the installation and near the 
shoreline. Millar, Smith and Reeve (2007) used a mathematical model to predict that 
operation of the Wave Hub, with WECs covering a 1 km by 3 km area located 20 km 
from shore, could decrease average wave heights by about 1–2 centimeters (cm) at 
the coastline. This represents an average decrease in wave height of 1%; a maximum 
decrease in the wave height of 3% was predicted to occur with a 90% energy transmit­
ting wave farm (Smith, Millar & Reeve, 2007). Other estimates in other environmental 
settings predict wave height reductions ranging from 3 to 13% (Nelson et al., 2008). 
Largier et al. (2008) concluded that height and incident angle are the most important 
wave parameters for determining the effects of reducing the energy supply to the coast.
The effects of reduced wave heights on coastal systems will vary from site to 
site. It is known that the richness and density of benthic organism is related to 
such factors as relative tidal range and sediment grain size (e.g., Rodil & Lastra, 
2004), so changes in wave height can be expected to alter benthic sediments and 
habitat for benthic organism. Coral reefs reduce wave heights and dissipate wave 
and tidal energy, thereby creating valuable ecosystems (Lugo-Fernandez, Roberts, 
& Wiseman, 1998; Roberts, Wilson, & Lugo-Fernandez, 1992). In other cases, wave 
height reductions can have long-term adverse effects. Estuary and lagoon inlets may 
be particularly sensitive to change in wave heights. For example, construction of a 
storm-surge barrier across an estuary in the Netherlands permanently reduce both 
the tidal range and mean high water level by about 12% from original values, and 
numerous changes to the affected salt marshes and wetlands soils were observed (de 
Jong, de Jong & Mulder, 1994).
DID YOU KNOW?
The PowerBuoy® design, developed by Ocean Power technologies (OPT), is 
one of the most widely deployed WEC device designs in the world. Presently, 
a 10-buoy test array of the PB150 PowerBuoy® is propose for deployment 
in Reedsport, Oregon. The PB150 is a utility-scale 150-kilowatt (kW) buoy 
that—in the initial design—contains hydraulic fluid, which is cycle as the buoy 
moves up and down with the waves. The moving fluid or mechanical parts are 
used to spin a generator, which produces electricity. The buoy is approximately 
35 m (115 feet) tall (of which approximately 9 m (30 feet) projects above the 
water’s surface) and 11 m (36 feet) in diameter. It is held in place by a three-
point mooring system (Reedsport OPT Wave Park, 2010).

149
Industrial Sea Pollution
Tidal energy converters can also modify wave heights and structure by extracting 
energy from the underlying current. The effects of structural drag on currents were 
not expected to be significant (MMS, 2007), but few measurements of the effects 
of tidal/current energy devices on water velocities have been reported. A few tidal 
velocity measurements were made near a single, 150-kilowatt (kW) Stingray demon­
strator in Yell Sound in the Shetland Islands (The Engineering Business Ltd, 2005). 
Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers were installed near the oscillating hydroplane 
(which travels up and down the water column in response to lift and drag forces) 
as well as upstream and downstream of the device. Too few velocity measurements 
were taken for firm conclusions to be made, but the data suggest that 1.5–2.0 m/s 
tidal currents were slowed by about 0.5 m/s downstream from the Stingray. In prac­
tice, multiple units will be spaced far enough apart to prevent a drop in performance 
(turbine output) which caused extraction of kinetic energy and localized water veloc­
ity reductions.
Modeling of the Wave Hub project in the United Kingdom suggested a local 
reduction in marine current velocities of up to 0.8 m/s, with a simultaneous increase 
in velocities of 0.6 m/s elsewhere (Michel et al., 2007). Wave energy converters 
are expected to affect water velocities less than submerged rotors and other similar 
designs because only cables and anchors will interfere with the movements of tides 
and currents.
Tidal energy conversion devices will increase turbulence, which in turn will alter 
mixing properties, sediment transport and, potentially, wave properties. In both the 
near field and far field, extraction of kinetic energy from tides will decrease tidal 
amplitude, current velocities and water exchange in proportion to the number of 
units installed, potentially altering the hydrologic, sediment transport and ecological 
relationships of rivers, estuaries and oceans. For example, Polagye et al. (2008) used 
an idealized estuary to model the effects of kinetic power extraction on estuary-
scale fluid mechanics. The predicted effects of kinetic power extraction included (a) 
reduction of the volume of water exchanged through the estuary over the tidal cycle, 
(b) reduction of the tidal range landward of the turbine array and (c) reduction of the 
kinetic power density in the tidal channel. These impacts were strongly dependent 
on the magnitude of kinetic power extraction, estuary geometry, tidal regime and 
non-linear turbine dynamics.
Karsten et al. (2008) estimated that extracting the maximum of 7 gigawatts (GW) 
of power from the Minas Passage (Bay of Fundy) with in-stream tidal turbines could 
result in large changes in the tides of the Minas Basin (greater than 30%) and signifi­
cant far-field changes (greater than 15%). Extracting 4 GW of power was predicted 
to cause less than a 10% change in tidal amplitudes, and 2.5 GW could be extracted 
with less than a 5% change. The model of Blanchfield et al. (2007) predicted that 
extracting the maximum value of 54 megawatts (MW) from the tidal current of 
Masset Sound (British Columbia) would decrease the water surface elevation within 
a bay and the maximum flow rate through the channel by approximately 40%. On the 
other hand, the tidal regime could be kept within 90% of the undisturbed regime by 
limiting extracted power to approximately 12 MW.
In the extreme far field (i.e., thousands of km), there is an unknown potential for 
dozens or hundreds of tidal energy extraction devices to alter major ocean current 

150
The Science of Ocean Pollution
such as the gulf stream (Michel et al., 2007). The significance of these potential 
impacts could be ascertained by predictive modeling and subsequent operational 
monitoring as projects are installed.
Operation of hydrokinetic or ocean energy technologies will extract energy from 
the water, which will reduce the height of waves or velocity of currents in the local 
area. This loss of wave/current energy could, in turn, alter sediment transport and the 
wave climate of nearby shorelines. Moreover, installation of many of the technolo­
gies will entail attaching the devices to the bottom by means of pilings or anchors 
and cables. Transmission of electricity to the shore will be through cables that are 
either buried in or attached to the seabed. Thus, project installation will temporar­
ily disturb sediments, the significance of which will be proportional to the amount 
and type of bottom substrate disturbed. There have been few studies of the effects 
of burying cables from ocean energy technologies, but experience with other buried 
cables and trawl fishing indicate the possible severity of the impacts. For example, 
Kogan et al. (2006) surveyed the condition of an armored, 6.6-cm-diameter coaxial 
cable that was laid on the surface of the seafloor off Half Moon Bay, California. The 
cable was not anchored to the seabed. Whereas the impacts of laying the cable on 
the surface of the seabed were probably small, subsequent movements of the cable 
had continuing impacts on the bottom substrates. For example, cable strumming 
by wave action in shallower, nearshore areas created incisions in rocky siltstone 
outcrops ranging from superficial scrapes to vertical grooves and had minor effects 
on the habitats of aquatic organisms. At greater depths, there was little evidence of 
effects of the cable on the seafloor, regardless of exposure. Limited self-burial of the 
unanchored cable occurred over an 8-year period, particularly in deeper waters of 
the continental shelf.
During operation, changes in current velocities or wave heights will alter sedi­
ment transport, erosion and sedimentation. Due to the complexity of currents and 
their interaction with structures, operation of the projects will likely increase scour 
and deposition of fine sediments on both localized and far-field scales. For example, 
turbulent vortices that are shed immediately downstream from a velocity-reducing 
structure (e.g., rotors, pilings, concrete anchor blocks) will cause scour, and this 
sediment is likely to be deposited further downstream. On average, extraction of 
kinetic energy from currents and waves is likely to increase sediment deposition in 
the shadow of the project (Michel et al., 2007), the depth and areal extent of which 
will depend on local topography, sediment types and characteristics of the current 
and the project. Subsequent deposition of sediments is likely to cause shoaling and 
a shift to a finer sediment grain size on the lee side of wave energy arrays (Bochert 
& Zettler, 2006). Scour and deposition should be considered in project development, 
but many of the high energy (high velocity) river and nearshore marine sites that 
could be utilized for electrical energy production are likely to have substrates with 
few or no fine sediments. Changes in scour and deposition will alter the habitat for 
bottom-dwelling plants and animals.
Loss of wave energy may lead to changes in longshore currents, reductions in the 
width and energy of the surf zone, and changes in beach and erosion and deposition 
patterns. Millar et al. (2007) modeled the wave climate near the Wave Hub electri­
cal grid connection point off the north coast of Cornwall. The installation would 

151
Industrial Sea Pollution
be located 20 km off the coast, in water depths of 50–60 m. Arrays of WECs con­
nected to the Wave Hub would occupy a 1 km × 3 km site. The mathematical model 
predicted that an array of WECs would potentially affect the wave climate on the 
nearby coast, on the order of 1–2 cm. It is unknown whether such small reductions in 
the average wave height would measurably alter sediment dynamics along the shore, 
given the normal variations in waves due to wind and storms.
Water quality will be temporarily affected by increased suspended sediments 
(turbidity) during installation and initial operation. Suspension of anoxic sediments 
may result in a temporary and localized decline in the dissolved oxygen content of 
the water, but dilution by oxygenated water current would minimize the impacts. 
Water quality may also be compromised by the mobilization of buried contami­
nated sediments during both construction and operation of the projects. Excavation 
to install the turbines, anchoring structures, and cables could release contaminants 
adsorbed to sediments, posing a threat to water quality and aquatic organism. Effects 
on aquatic biota may range from temporary degradation of water quality (e.g., a 
decline in dissolved oxygen content) to biotoxicity and bioaccumulation of previous 
buried contaminants such as metals.
Installation and operation of hydrokinetic and marine energy projects can directly 
displace benthic (i.e., bottom-dwelling) plants and animals or change their habitats by 
altering water flows, wave structures or substrate composition. Many of the designs 
will include a large anchoring system made of concrete or metal, mooring cables and 
electrical cables that lead from the offshore facility to the shoreline. Electrical cables 
might simply be laid on the bottom, or they more likely will be anchored or buried to 
prevent movement. Large bottom structures will alter water flow, which may result 
in localized scour and/or deposition. Because these new structures will affect bottom 
habitats, consequently changes to the benthic community composition and species 
interactions in the area defined by the project may be expected (Louse et al., 2008).
Bottom disturbances will result from the temporary anchoring of construc­
tion vessels; digging and refilling the trenches for power cables; and installation 
of permanent anchors, pilings or other mooring devices. Motile organisms will be 
displaced and sessile organism destroyed in the limited areas affected by these activ­
ities. Displaced organisms may be able to relocate if similar habitats exist nearby and 
those habitats are not already at carrying capacity. That is, each population has an 
upper limit on size, called the carrying capacity. Carrying capacity can be defined 
as being the optimum number of species’ individuals that can survive in a specific 
area over time. Stated differently, the carrying capacity is the maximum number of 
species that can be supported in a bioregion. A pond may be able to support only a 
dozen frogs depending on the food resources for the frogs in the pond. If there were 
30 frogs in the same pond, at least half of them would probably die because the pond 
environment wouldn’t have enough food for them to live. Carrying capacity, symbol­
ized as K, is based on the quantity of food supplies, the physical space available, the 
degree of predation and several other environmental factors.
Species with benthic-associated spawning or whose offspring settle into and 
inhabit benthic habitats are likely to be most vulnerable to disruption during proj­
ect installation. Temporary increase in suspended sediments and sedimentation 
down current from the construction area can be expected. The potential effects of 

152
The Science of Ocean Pollution
suspended sediments and sedimentation on aquatic organism are periodically reviews 
(e.g., Newcombe & Jensen, 1996; Wilber & Clarke, 2001; Wilber et al., 2005; Wood 
& Armitage, 1997). When construction is completed, disturbed areas are likely to 
be recolonized by these same organisms, assuming that the substrate and habitats 
are restored to a similar state. For example, Lewis et al. (2003) found that numbers 
of clams and burrowing polychaetas (worms) fully recovered within one year after 
construction of an estuarine pipeline, although fewer wading birds returned to forage 
on these invertebrates during the same time period.
Installation of the project will alter benthic habitats over the longer term if the 
trenches containing electrical cables are backfilled with sediments of different size 
or composition than the previous substrate. Permanent structures on the bottom 
(ranging in size from anchoring systems to seabed-mounted generators or turbine 
rotors) will supplant the existing habitats. These new structures would replace natu­
ral hard substrates or, in the case of previously sandy area, add to the amount of hard 
bottom habitat available to benthic algae, invertebrates and fish.
This could attract a community of rocky reef fish and invertebrate species (includ­
ing biofouling organisms) that would not normally exist at that site. Depending on 
the situation, the newly created habitat could increase biodiversity or have negative 
effects by enabling introduced (exotic) benthic species to spread. Marine fouling 
communities developed on monopiles for offshore wind power plants are significantly 
different from the benthic communities on adjacent hard substrates (Wilhelmsson & 
Maim, 2008; Wilhelmsson, Malm, & Ohman, 2006).
Changes in water velocities and sediment transport, erosion and deposition caused 
by the presence of new structures will alter benthic habitats, at least on a local scale. 
This impact may be more extensive and long-lasting than the effects of anchor and 
cable installation. Deposition of sand may impact seagrass beds by increasing mor­
tality and decreasing the growth rate of plant shoots (Craig et al., 2008). Conversely, 
deposition of organic matter in the wakes of marine energy devices could encourage 
the growth of benthic invertebrate communities that are adapted to that substrate. 
Mussel shell mounds that slough off from oil and gas platforms may create surround­
ing artificial reefs that attract a large variety of invertebrates (e.g., crabs, sea stars, 
sea cucumbers, anemones) and fish (Love, Caselle, & Snook, 1999). Accumulation of 
shells and organic matter in the areas would depend on the wave and current energy, 
activities of biota and numerous other factors (Widdows & Brinsley, 2002). While 
the new habitats created by energy conversion structures may enhance the abun­
dance and diversity of invertebrates, predation by fish attracted to artificial struc­
tures can greatly reduce the numbers of benthic organism (Davis, VanBlaricom, & 
Dayton, 1982).
Movements of mooring or electrical transmission cables along the bottom (sweep­
ing) could be a continual source of habitat disruption during operation of the project. 
For example, Kogan et al. (2006) found that shallow water wave action shifted a 
6.6-cm diameter, armored coaxial cable that was laid on the surface of the seafloor. 
The strumming action caused incisions in rocky outcrops, but effects on seafloor 
organisms were minor. Anemones colonized the cable itself, preferring the hard 
structure over the nearby sediment-dominated seafloor. Some flatfishes were more 
abundant near the cable than at control sites, probably because the cable created a 

153
Industrial Sea Pollution
more structurally heterogeneous habitat. Sensitive habitats that may be particularly 
vulnerable to the effects of cable movements include macroalgae and seagrass beds, 
coral habitats, and other biogenic habitats like worm reefs and mussel mounds.
THE BOTTOM LINE
Wave, tide and heat recovery energy projects may also have benefits to some aquatic 
habitats and populations. The presence of a marine energy conversion project will 
likely limit most fishing activities and other access in the immediate area. Bottom 
trawling can disrupt habitats, and benthic communities in areas that are heavily 
fished tend to be less complex and productive than in areas that are not fished in 
that way (Jennings et al., 2001; Kaiser et al., 2000). Blyth et al. (2004) found that 
cessation of towed-gear fishing resulted in significantly greater total species richness 
and biomass of benthic communities compared to sites that were still fished. The 
value of these areas in which fishing is precluded (or, at least limited to certain gear 
types) by the energy project would depend on the species of fish and their mobility. 
For relatively sedentary animals, reserves less than 1 km across have augmented 
local fisheries, and reserves in Florida of 16 km2 and 24 km2 have sustained more 
abundant and sizable fish than nearby exploited areas (Gell & Roberts, 2003). On 
the other hand, the protection of long-lived, late-maturing or migratory marine fish 
species may require much larger marine protected areas (greater than 500 km2) than 
those envisioned for most energy developments (Blyth-Skyrme et al., 2006; Kaiser, 
2005; Nelson, 2008).

INTRODUCTION
The study of sound and its behavior in the ocean is known as ocean acoustics. Like 
ripples on a pond sound waves radiate in all directions away from the source. Ocean 
noise refers to sounds made by human activities that can interfere with or obscure the 
ability of marine animals to hear natural sounds in the ocean, Freshwater and marine 
animals rely on sound for many aspects of their lives including reproduction, feed­
ing, predator and hazard avoidance, communication and navigation (Popper, 2003; 
Weilgart, 2007). Consequently, underwater noise generated during shipping, recre­
ational boating and energy exploration installation and operation of a hydrokinetic or 
ocean energy conversion device has the potential to impact these organisms. Noise 
may interfere with sounds animals make to communicate or may drive animals from 
the area. If severe enough, loud sounds could damage their hearing or cause mortali­
ties. For example, it is known from experience with other marine construction activi­
ties that the noise created by pile driving creates sound pressure levels high enough 
to impact the hearing of harbor porpoises and harbor seals (Thomsen et al., 2006). 
The effects are less certain for fish (Hastings & Popper, 2005), although fish mortali­
ties have been reported for some pile-driving activities (Caltrans, 2001; Longmuir & 
Lively, 2001). Noise generated during normal operations is expected to be less pow­
erful, but could still disrupt the behavior of marine mammals, sea turtles and fish at 
great distances from the source. Changes in animal behavior or physiological stresses 
could lead to decreased foraging efficiency, abandonment of nearby habitats, 
decrease reproduction and increased mortality (National Research Council (NRC), 
2005)—all of which could have adverse effects on both individuals and 
populations.
Construction and operation noise may disturb seabirds using the offshore and 
intertidal environment. Shorebirds will be disturbed by onshore construction and 
operations, causing them to abandon breeding colonies (Thompson et al., 2008). 
Pinnipeds (seals, sea lions and walruses) may abandon onshore sites used for repro­
duction (rookeries) because of noise and other disturbing activities during installa­
tion. On the other hand, some marine mammals and birds may be attracted to the 
area by underwater sounds, lights or increase prey availability.
There are many sources of sound/noise in the aquatic environment (NRC 2003; 
Simmonds, Dolman, & Weilgart, 2003). Natural sources include wind, waves,

earthquakes, precipitation, cracking ice and mammal and fish vocalizations. Human-
generated ocean noise comes from such diverse sources as recreational, military and 
commercial ship traffic; dredging; construction; oil drilling and production; geo­
physical surveys; sonar; explosions; and ocean research (Johnson et al., 2008). Many 
of these sounds will be present in an area of new energy developments. Noises gener­
ated by marine and hydrokinetic energy technologies should be considered in the 
context of these background sounds. The additional noises from these energy tech­
nologies could result from installation and maintenance of the units, movements of 
internal machinery, waves striking the buoys, water flow moving over mooring and 
transmission cables, synchronous and additive non-synchronous sound from multi­
ple unit arrays and environmental monitoring using hydroacoustic techniques.
There are many ways to express the intensity and frequency of underwater sound 
waves (Thomsen et al., 2006; Wahlberg & Westerberg, 2005). An underwater acous­
tic wave is generated by displacement of water particles. Consequently, the passage 
of an acoustic wave creates local pressure oscillations that travel through water with 
a given sound velocity. These two parameters, pressure and velocity, are used to 
define the intensity of an acoustic field and therefore are useful for considering the 
effects of noise on aquatic animals.
The intensity of the acoustic field is defined as the vector product of the local 
pressure fluctuations and the velocity of the particle displacement. A basic unit for 
measuring the intensity of underwater noise is the sound pressure level (SPL). The 
SPL of a sound, given in decibels (dB), is calculated by:

where P is a pressure fluctuation caused by a sound source, and Po is the reference

The distance acoustic waves travel is primarily dependent upon ocean tem­
perature and pressure.

The decibel scale is a logarithmic scale used to measure the amplitude of a 
sound. A decibel doesn’t really represent a unit of measure like a meter or 
yard, but instead, a pressure value in decibels expresses a ratio between the 
measured pressure and a reference pressure. On the decibel scale, everything 
refers to power, which is amplitude squared. Amplitude describes the height of 
the sound pressure wave or the “loudness” of a sound and is often measured 
in decibels.

et al., 2006). Using the above formula, doubling the pressure of a sound (P) results in 
a 6 dB increase in SPL.
The sound pressure of a continuous signal is often expressed by a root means 
square (rms) measure, which is the square root of the mean value of squared instan­
taneous sound pressures integrated over time (Madsen, 2005). Like SPL, the result­
ing integration of instantaneous sound pressure levels is also expressed in dB re 
1 µPa (rms). An rms level of safe exposure to received noise has been established 
for marine mammals; the lower limits for concern about temporary or permanent 
hearing impairments in cetaceans and pinnipeds are currently 180 and 190 dB re 
1 µPa (rms) respectively (NMFS, 2003; Southhall et al., 2007). However, Madsen 
(2005) argues that rms safety measures are insufficient and should be supplemented 
by other estimates of the magnitude of noise (e.g., maximum peak-to-peak SPL in 
concert with a maximum received energy flux level).
Sound intensity is greatest near the sound source and, in the far field, decreases 
smoothly with distance. As the acoustic wave propagates through the water, inten­
sity is reduced by geometric spreading (dilution of the energy of the sound wave as 
it spreads out from the source over a larger and larger area) and, to a lesser extent, 
absorption, refraction and reflection (Wahlberg & Westerberg, 2005). Attenuation of 
sound due to spherical spreading in deep water is estimated by 20 log r, where r is 
the distance in m from the source (NRC, 2000). Assuming simple spherical spread­
ing (no reflection from the sea surface or bottom) and the consequent transmission 
loss of SPL, a 190 dB source level would be reduced to 150 dB at 100 m. close to 
the source, changes in sound intensity vary in a more complicated fashion, particu­
larly in shallow water, as a result of acoustic interference from natural or man-made 
sounds or where there are reflective surfaces (seabed and water surfaces).
Sound exposure level (SEL) is a measure of the cumulative physical energy of the 
sound event which takes into account both intensity and duration. SELs are computed 
by summing the cumulative sound pressure squared (p2) over time and normalizing the 
time to 1 second. Because the calculation of the SEL for a given underwater sound

According to several articles published in Electrical Engineering and the Journal 
of the Acoustical Society of America, the decibel suffers from the following dis­
advantages (Chapman, 2000; Clay, 1999; Hickling, 1999; Horton, 1954):
•	 The decibel creates confusion.
•	 The logarithmic form obscures reasoning.
•	 Decibels are more related to the area of slide rules than that of mod­
ern digital processing.
•	 They are cumbersome and difficult to interpret.
Hickling (1999) concludes “Decibels are a useless affectation, which is 
impeding the development of noise control as an engineering discipline.”

The Science of Ocean Pollution
source is a way to normalize to 1 second the energy of noise that may be much briefer 
(such as the powerful, but short impulses caused by pile driving), SEL is typically used 
to compare noise events of varying durations and intensities.
In addition to intensity, underwater noise will have a range of frequencies (Hz or 
cycles per $). For convenience, measurements of the potentially wide range of individ­
ual frequencies associated with noise are integrated into “critical bands” or filters; the 
width of a band is often given in 1/3-octave levels (Thomsen et al., 2006). Thus, sounds 
can be expressed in terms of the intensities (dB) at particular frequency (Hz) bands.
The NRC (2000) pointed out that there are four fundamental properties of sound 
transmission in water relevant to the consideration of the effects of noise on aquatic 
animals:
1.	The transmission distance of sound in seawater is determined by a combina­
tion of geometric spreading loss and an absorptive loss that is proportional 
to the sound frequency. Thus, attenuation (weakening) of sound increases 
as its frequency increases.
2.	The speed of a sound wave in water is proportional to the temperature.
3.	The sound intensity decrease with distance from the sound source. 
Transmission loss of energy (intensity) due to spherical spreading in deep 
water is estimated by 20 log10 r, where r is the distance in m from the source.
4.	The strength of the sound is measured on a logarithmic scale.
From these properties, it can be seen that high-frequency sounds will dissipate 
faster than low-frequency sounds, and a sound level may decrease by as much as 60 
dB at 1 km from the source. Acoustic wave intensity of 180 dB is 10 times less 
intense than 190 dB, and 170 dB is 100 times less than 190 dB (NRC, 2000).
DID YOU KNOW?
While pressure continues to increase as ocean depth increases, the tempera­
ture of the ocean only decreases up to a certain point, after which it remains 
relatively stable.
DID YOU KNOW?
The area in the ocean where sound waves refract up and down is known as the 
“sound channel.” Note that the channeling of sound waves occurs because of 
the properties of sound and the temperature and pressure differences at different 
depths in the ocean. Within the deep sound channel, sound carries very long 
distances. This deep sound channel is known as SOFAR (SOund Fixing And 
Ranging) channel. Sound, especially low-frequency sound, can travel thousands 
of meters with very little loss of signal. Note that the novel The Hunt for Red 
October describes the use of the SOFAR channel in submarine detection.

Noise Produced by Ocean Energy Technologies
There is very little information available on sound levels produced by construc­
tion and operation of ocean energy conversion structures (Michel & Burkhard, 
2007). However, reviews of the construction and operation of European offshore 
wind farms provide useful information on the sensitivity of aquatic organisms to 
underwater noise. For example, Thomsen et al. (2006) reported that pile-driving 
activities generate brief, but very high sound pressure levels over a broad band of fre­
quencies (20–20,000 Hz). Single pulses are about 50–100 ms in duration and occur 
approximately 30–60 times per minute. The SEL at 400 m from the driving of a 
1.5-m-diameter pile exceeded 140 dB re 1 µPa over a frequency range of 40–3000 Hz 
(Betke, Schultz-von Glahn, & Matuschek, 2004). It usually takes 1–2 h to drive one 
pile into the bottom. Sounds produced by the pile-driving impacts above the water’s 
surface enter the water from the air and from the submerged portion of the pile and 
propagate through the water column, and into the sediments, from which they pass 
successively back into the water column. Larger-diameter longer piles require rela­
tively more energy to drive into the sediments, which results in higher noise levels. 
For example, the SPL associated with driving 3.5-m-diameter piles is expected to be 
roughly 10 dB greater than for a 1.5-m-diameter pile (Thomsen et al., 2006). Pile 
driving sound, while intense and potentially damaging, would occur only during the 
installation of some marine and hydrokinetic energy devices.
Some ocean energy technologies will be secured to the bottom by means of moor­
ings and anchors drilled into rock. Like pile-driving hydraulic drilling will occur 
during a limited time period, and noise generation will be intermittent. DON (2003) 
summarized underwater SPL measurements of three hydraulic rock drills; frequen­
cies ranged from about 15 Hz to over 39 Hz and SPLs ranged from about 120–170 dB 
re 1 µPa. SPLs were relatively consistent across the entire frequency range.
During operation, vibration of the device’s gearbox, generator and other moving 
components are radiated as sound into the surrounding water. Noise during operation 
of wind farms is of much lower intensity than noise during construction (Betke et al., 
2004; Thomsen et al., 2006), and the same may be true for hydrokinetic and ocean 
energy farms. However, this source of noise will be continuous. Measurements of 
sound levels associated with the operation of hydrokinetic and ocean energy farms 
have not yet been published. One example of a wave energy technology, the WEC 
buoy (a version of OPT’s PowerBuoy) that has been tested in Hawaii, has many of the 
mechanical parts contained within an equipment canister or mounted to a structure 
through mounting pads. Thus, the acoustic energy produced by the equipment is not

The reference pressure in air differs from that in water. Therefore a 130 dB 
sound in water is not the same as a 130 dB sound in air. The amplitude of 
sound in air is measured in (dB re 20µPa@ 1m) and in water (dB re 1µPa@ 
1m).

The Science of Ocean Pollution
well coupled to the seawater, which is expected to reduce the amount of radiated 
noise (DON, 2003). Although no measurements had been made, it was predicted 
that the acoustic output from the WEC buoy system would probably be in the range 
of 75–80 dB re 1 µPa. This SPL is equivalent to light to normal density shipping 
nose, although the frequency spectrum of the WEC buoy is expected to be shifted 
to higher frequencies than typical shipping noise. By comparison, Thomsen et al. 
(2006) reported the ambient noise measured at five different locations in the North 
Sea. Depending on Frequency, SPL ranged from 85 to 115 dB, with most energy 
occurring at frequencies less than 100 Hz.
The Environmental Statement for the proposed installation of the Wave Dragon 
wave energy demonstrator off the coast of Pembrokeshire, UK predicted noise levels 
associated with installation of concrete caisson (gravity) block and steel cable moor­
ing arrangement, installation of subsea cable and support activity (Wave Dragon 
Wales Ltd., 2007). The installation of gravity blocks is not expected to generate 
additional noise over and above that of the vessel conducting the operation. Vessel 
noise will depend on the size and design of the ship but is expected to be up to 180 dB 
re 1 µPa at 1 m. Other predicted installation noise sources and levels stem from 
operation of the ship’s echosounder (220 dB re 1 µPa at 1 m peak-to-peak), cable 
laying and fixing (159–181 dB re 1 µPa at 1 m) and directional drilling (129 dB re 
1 µPa rms at 40 m above the drill). There are no measurements available for the 
noise associated with operation of an overtopping device such as the Wave Dragon. 
Wave Dragon Wales Ltd. (2007) predicted that operational noise would result from 
the Kaplan-style hydro turbines (an estimated 143 dB re 1 µPa at 1 m), as well as 
unknown levels and frequencies of sound from wave interactions with the body of 
the device, hydraulic pumps and the mooing system.
In April 2008, the Ocean Renewable Power Company (ORPC) made limited 
measurements of underwater noise associated with operation of their 1/3-scale 
working prototype instream tidal energy conversion device, its Turbine Generation 
Unit (TFU). The TGU is a single horizontal axis device with two advanced design 
cross-flow turbines that drive a permanent magnet generator. An omnidirectional 
hydrophone, calibrated for a frequency range of 20–250 kHz, was used to make near 
field measurement adjacent to the barge from which the turbine was suspended and 
at approximately 15 m from the turbine. Multiple far-field measurements were also 
made at a distance out to 2.0 km from the barge. Noise measurements were made 
over one full tidal cycle, with supplemental measurement taken later. Sound pressure 
levels at 1/3-octave frequency bands were used to calculate rms levels and SELs. 
During times when the turbine generator unit was not operating, background noise 
ranged from 112 to 138 dB re 1 µPa rms and SELs ranged from 120 to 140 dB re 
1 µPa. A single measurement made when the turbine blades were rotating (at 52 rpm) 
resulted in an estimate of 132 dB re 1 µPa (rms) and an SEL of 126 dB re 1 µPa at a 
horizontal distance of 15 m and a water depth of 10 m. These very limited readings 
suggest that the single 1/3-scale turbine generator unit did not increase noise above 
ambient levels.
In addition to the sound intensity and frequency spectrum produced by the 
operation of individual machines, impacts of noise will depend on the geographic 
location of the project (water depth, type of substrate), the number of units and the 

165

arrangement of multiple-unit arrays. For example, due to noise from surf and surface 
waves, noise levels in shallow, nearshore areas (≤ 100 m deep and within 5 km of the 
shore) are typically somewhat higher for low frequencies (≤ 1 kHz) and much higher 
frequencies above 1 kHz.
Because of the complexity of describing underwater sounds, investigators have 
often used different units to express the effects of sound on aquatic animals and have 
not always precisely reported the experimental conditions. For example, acoustic 
signal characteristics that might be relevant to biological effects include frequency 
content, rise time, pressure and particle velocity time series, zero-to-peak and peak-
to-peak amplitude, means squared amplitude, duration, integral of mean squared 
amplitude over duration, sound exposure level and repetition rate (NRC, 2003; 
Thomsen et al., 2006). Each of these sound characteristics may differentially impact 
different species of aquatic animals, but the relationships are not sufficiently under­
stood to specify which are the most important. Many studies of the effects of noise 
report the frequency spectrum and some measure of sound intensity (SPL, rms and/
or SEL).
Underwater noise can be detected by fish and marine mammals if the frequency 
and intensity falls within the range of hearing for the particular species. An organ­
ism’s hearing ability can be displayed as an audiogram, which plots sound pressure 
level (dB) against frequency (Hz). Nedwell et al. (2004) compiled audiograms for a 
number of aquatic organisms. If the pressure level of a generated sound is transmit­
ted at these frequencies and exceeds the sound pressure level (i.e., above the line) on 
a given species’ audiogram, the organism will be able to detect the sound. There 
is a wide range of sensitivity to sound among marine fish. The herrings (Clupeoidea) 
are highly sensitive to sound due to the structure of their swim bladder and auditory 
apparatus, whereas flatfish such as plaice and dab (Pleuronectidae) that have no swim 
bladder are relatively insensitive to sound (Nedwell et al., 2004). Possible responses 
to the received sound may include altered behavior (i.e., attraction, avoidance, inter­
ference with normal activities; Nelson et al., 2008) or, if the intensity is great enough, 
hearing damage or mortality. For example, fish kills have been reported in the vicin­
ity of pile-driving activities (Caltrans, 2001; Longmuir & Lively, 2001).
The NRC (2000) reviewed studies that demonstrated a wide range of suscepti­
bilities to exposure-induced hearing damage among different marine species. The 
implications are that critical sound levels will not be able to be extrapolated from 
studies of a few species (although a set of representative species might be identified), 
and it will not be possible to identify a single sound level value at which damage to 
the auditory system will begin at all, or even most, marine mammals. Participants 
in a recent NOAA workshop (Boehlert, McMurray, & Tortorici, 2008) suggested 
that sounds that are within the range of hearing and “sweep” in frequency are more 
likely to disturb marine mammals than constant-frequency sounds. Thus, devices 
that emit a constant frequency may be preferable to ones that vary. They believed 
that the same may be true, although perhaps to a lesser extent, for sounds that change 
in amplitude.
Moore and Clarke (2002) compiled information on the reactions of gray whales 
(Eschrichtius robustus) to noise associated with offshore oil and gas development and 
vessel traffic. Gray whale response included changes in swim speed and direction to 

166

avoid the sound sources, abrupt but temporary cessation of feeding, changes in call­
ing rates and call structure and changes in surface behavior. They reported a 0.5 
probability of avoidance when continuous noise levels exceeded about 120 dB re 
1 µPa and when intermittent noise levels exceeded about 170 dB re 1 µPa. They 
found little evidence that gray whales travel far or remain disturbed for long as a 
result of noises of this nature
Weilgart (2007) reviewed the literature on the effects of ocean noise on ceta­
ceans (whales, dolphins, porpoises), focusing on underwater explosions, shipping, 
seismic exploration by the oil and gas industries and naval sonar operations. She 
noted that strandings and mortalities of cetaceans have been observed even when 
estimated received sound levels were not high enough to cause hearing damage. 
This suggests that a change in diving patterns may have resulted in injuries due to 
gas and fat emboli (a fat droplet that enters the bloodstream). That is, aversive noise 
may prompt cetaceans to rise to the surface too rapidly, and the rapid decompres­
sion causes nitrogen gas supersaturation and the subsequent formation of bubbles 
(emboli) in their tissues (Fernandez et al., 2005). Other adverse (but not directly 
lethal) impacts could include increased stress elves, abandonment of important habi­
tats, masking of important sounds and changes in vocal behavior that may lead to 
reduced foraging efficiency or mating opportunities. Weilgart (2007) pointed out 
that responses of cetaceans to ocean noise are highly variable between species, age 
classes and behavioral states, and many examples of apparent tolerance of noise have 
been documented.
Nowacek et al. (2007) reviewed the literature on the behavioral, acoustic and 
physiological effects of anthropogenic noise on cetaceans and concluded that the 
noise source of primary concern are ships, seismic exploration, sonars and some 
acoustic harassment devices (AHDs) that are employed to reduce the by-catch of 
small cetaceans and seals by commercial fishing gear.
Two marine mammals whose hearing and susceptibility to noise have been stud­
ied are the harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) and the harbor seal (Phoca vitu­
lina). Both species inhabit shallow coastal waters in the North Atlantic and North 
Pacific. Harbor porpoises are found as far south as Central California on the West 
Coast. The hearing of the harbor porpoise ranges from below 1 kHz to around 140 kHz. 
In the United States, harbor seals range from Alaska to Southern California on the 
West Coast, and as far south as South Carolina on the East Coast. Harbor seal hear­
ing ranges from less than 0.1 kHz to around 100 kHz (Thomsen et al., 2006). Sounds 
produced by marine energy devices that are outside of these frequency ranges would 
not be detected by these species.
Thomsen et al. (2006) compared the underwater noise associated with pile-
driving to the audiograms of harbor porpoises and harbor seals and concluded that 
pile-driving noise would likely be detectable at least 80 km away from the source. 
The zone of masking (the area within which the noise is strong enough to interfere 
with the detection of other sounds) may differ between the two species. Because the 
echolocation (sonar) used by harbor porpoises is in a frequency range (120–150 kHz) 
where pile-driving noises have little or no energy, they considered masking of echo­
location to be unlikely. On the other hand, harbor seals communicate at frequencies 
ranging from 0.2 to 3.5 kHz, which is within the range of highest pile-driving sound 

167
Noisy Sea
pressure levels; thus, harbor seals may have their communications masked at consid­
erable distances by pile-driving activities.
The responses of green turtles (Chelonia mydas) and loggerhead turtles (Caretta 
caretta) to the sounds of air guns used for marine seismic surveys were studied by 
McCauley et al. (2000a, 2000b). They found that above a noise level of 166 dB re 1 µPa 
rms the turtles noticeably increased their swimming activity, and above 175 dB re 
1 µPa rms their behavior became more erratic, possibly indicating that the turtles 
were in an agitated state. On the other hand, later studies were not able to detect an 
impact on turtles of the sounds produced by air guns in geophysical seismic sur­
veys. Caged squid (Sepioteuthis australis) showed a strong startle response to an air 
gun at a received level of 174 dB re 1 µPa rms. When sound levels were ramped up 
(rather than a sudden nearby startup), the squid showed behavioral response (e.g., 
rapid swimming) at sound levels as low as approximately 156 dB re 1 µPa rms but 
did not display the startle response seen in the other tests.
Hastings and Popper (2005) reviewed the literature on the effects of underwater 
sounds on fish, particularly noises associated with pile driving. The limited number 
of quantitative studies found evidence of changes in the hearing capabilities of some 
fish, damage to the sensory structure of the inner ear or, of fish close to the sources, 
mortality. They concluded that the body of scientific and commercial data is inad­
equate to develop more than the most preliminary criteria to protect fish from pile 
driving sounds and suggested the types of studies that could be conducted to address 
the information gaps. Similarly, Viada et al. (2008) found very little information on 
the potential impacts to sea turtles of underwater explosives. Although explosives 
produce greater sound pressures than pile driving and are unlikely to be used in 
most ocean energy installations, studies of their effects provide general information 
about the peak pressures and distances that have been used to establish safety zones 
for turtles.
Wahlberg and Westerberg (2005) compared source level and underwater mea­
surements of sounds from offshore windmills to information about the heaving capa­
bilities of three species of fish: goldfish, Atlantic salmon and cod. They predicted 
that these fish could detect offshore windmills at a maximum distance of about 0.4–
25 km, depending on wind speed, type and number of windmills, water depth and 
substrate. They could find no evidence that the underwater sounds emitted by wind­
mill operation would cause temporary or permanent hearing loss in these species, 
even at a distance of a few meters, although sound intensities might cause permanent 
avoidance within ranges of about 4 m. They noted that shipping causes considerably 
higher sound intensities than operating windmills (although the noise from shipping 
is transient), and noises from installation may have much more significant impacts 
on fish than those from operation.
In the Environmental Assessment of the proposed Wave Energy Technology 
(WET) Project, DON (2003) considered the sounds made by hydraulic rock drilling 
to be detectable by humpback whales, bottlenose dolphins, Hawaiian spinner dol­
phins and green sea turtles. Assuming a transmission loss due to spherical spreading, 
drilling sound pressure levels of 160 dB re 1 µPa would decrease by about 40 dB at 
100 m from the source. They regarded a SPL of 120 dB re 1 µPa to be below the level 
that would affect these four species. In fact, they reported that other construction 

168
The Science of Ocean Pollution
activities involving similar drilling attracted marine life, fish and sea turtles in par­
ticular, perhaps because bottom organisms were stirred up by the drilling.
There are considerable information gaps regarding the effects of noise generated 
by marine and hydrokinetic energy technologies on cetaceans, pinnipeds, turtles 
and fish. Sound levels from these devices have not been measured, but it is likely 
that installation will create more noise than operation, at least for those technolo­
gies that require pile driving. Operational noise from generators, rotating equipment, 
and other moving parts may have comparable frequencies and magnitudes to those 
measured at offshore wind farms; however, the underwater noise created by a wind 
turbine is transmitted down through the pilings, whereas noises from marine and 
hydrokinetic devices are likely to be greater because they are at least partially sub­
merged. It is probable that noise from marine energy projects may be less than the 
intermittent noises associated with shipping and many other anthropogenic sound 
sources (e.g., seismic exploration, explosions, commercial, naval sonar).
The resolution of noise impacts will require information about the device’s acous­
tic signature (e.g., sound pressure levels across the full range of frequencies) for both 
individual units and multiple-unit arrays, similar characterization of ambient (back­
ground) noise in the vicinity of the project, the hearing sensitivity (e.g., audiograms) 
of fish and marine mammals that inhabit the area and information about the behav­
ioral response to anthropogenic noise (e.g., avoidance, attraction, changes in school­
ing behavior or migration routes). Simmonds et al. (2003) describe the types of in 
situ monitoring that could be carried out to develop information on the effects of 
underwater noise arising from a variety of activities. The studies include monitoring 
marine mammal activity in parallel with sound level monitoring during construction 
and operation. Baseline sound surveys would be needed against which to measure 
the added effects of energy generation. It will be important to measure the acoustic 
characteristics produced by both single units and multiple units in an array, due to 
the possibility of synchronous or asynchronous, additive noise produced by the array 
(Boehlert et al., 2008). Minimally, the operational monitoring would quantify the 
sound pressure levels across the entire range of sound frequencies for a variety of 
ocean/river conditions in order to assess how meteorological, current strength and/or 
wave height conditions affect sound generation and sound masking. The monitoring 
effort should consider the effects of marine fouling on noise production, particularly 
as it relates to mooing cables.

Electromagnetic Sea
INTRODUCTION
A few years ago, in one of my environmental health classes at Old Dominion 
University (ODU) while I was presenting my well-versed and well-worn lecture (and 
fortunately rated yearly as one of the best classes in the University—I always had the 
smartest students) on environmental pollution I got to the part of the on-going lec­
tures that deal with EMF—well that was like opening Pandoras Box. Now I am not 
talking about a situation like Hesiod’s when she opened Pandora’s Box and released 
physical and emotional curses upon mankind.
No, instead what came forth from my open-minded, far-thinking, smart, non-
snowflake students were questions, and actually in almost all cases their personal 
statements about EMF.
To begin with in presenting my discussion about EMF (Electric & Magnetic 
Fields—Electromagnetic Fields) that they are invisible fields or areas of energy, 
sometimes referred to as radiation, associated with the use of electrical power and 
various forms of natural and human-made light. Then I went on to explain that EMFs 
are typically grouped into one of two categories by their frequency:
•	 Non-ionizing: low-level radiation which is generally perceived as harmless 
to humans; and
•	 Ionizing: high-level radiation which has the potential for cellular and DNA 
damage.
At this point I would pause and ask: “Do you have any questions?” Well, this is 
when Pandora’s Box flew wide open.
Student question #1: “Professor, is it true that using cell phones give off EMFs and 
that this exposure might give the user cancer of the ear, brain, or whatever?”
Answer #1: “Cell phones emit non-ionizing radiation—low to mid-frequency radia­
tion which is generally perceived as harmless due to its lack of potency. Also, non-
ionizing low to mid-level forms of radiation are radio frequency (RF), microwaves, 
and visual light.”
Student question/statement #2: One of the young women sitting in the back raised her 
hand and I acknowledged her to speak. “Professor … and that non-ionizing radiation 
might not be anything to worry about but I am not sure … and I do not think anyone 
really knows the harm of it all … in my case I do not use cell phones or microwaves … 
I don’t need the exposure.”
There was a moment of silence.
Answer #2: “Well, what you avoid in life is your business and your choice. However, 
microwave ovens computers, wireless networks, cell phones, bluetooth devices, 
power lines and MRIs are all non-ionizing and non-hazardous radiation types …

The Science of Ocean Pollution
that is as far as we know. We do know that exposure to UV, X-Rays, and Gamma 
Rays, all ionizing radiation are hazardous.”
I also had several questions and statements from the 142 students in the room dur­
ing that lesson but almost all were related to the two questions above. So, I returned 
to my lecture and discussed ocean EMF pollution.
OCEAN EMF POLLUTION
Underwater cables will be used to transmit electricity between turbines in an array 
(inter-turbine cables), between the array and a submerged step-up transformer (if 
part of the design), and from the transformer or array to the shore (CMACS, 2003). 
Ohman, Sigray, and Westerberg (2007) categorize submarine electric cables into the 
following types: telecommunications cables; high voltage, direct current (HVDC) 
cables; alternating current three-phase power cables; and low-voltage cables. All 
types of cable will emit EMF in the surrounding water. The electric current traveling 
through the cables will induce magnetic fields in the immediate vicinity, which can 
in turn induce a secondary electrical field when animals move through the magnetic 
fields (CMACS, 2003).
Nature of the Underwater Electromagnetic Field
In 1819, Hans Christian Oersted, a Danish scientist, discovered that a field of mag­
netic force exists around a single wire conductor carrying an electric current. The 
electromagnetic field (EMF) created by electric current passing through a cable is 
composed of both an electric field (E field) and an induced magnetic field (B field). 
Although E can be contained within undamaged insulation surrounding the cable, 
B fields are unavoidable and will in turn induce a secondary electric field (iE field). 
Thus, it is important to distinguish between the two constituents of the EMF (E and 
B) and the induced field, iE. Because the electric field is a measure of how the volt­
age changes when a measurement point is moved in a given direction, E and iE are 
expressed as volts/m (V/m).
The intensity of a magnetic field can be expressed as magnetic field strength or 
magnetic flux density (CMACS, 2003). The magnetic field can be visualized as field 
lines, and the field strength (measured in amperes/m [A/m]) corresponds to the den­
sity of the field lines. Magnetic flux density is a measure of the density of magnetic 
lines or force, or magnetic flux lines, passing through an area. Magnetic flux density 
(measured in teslas [T]) diminishes with increasing distance from a straight current-
carrying wire. At a given location in the vicinity of a current-carrying wire, the 
magnetic flux density is directly proportional to the current in amperes. Thus, the 
magnetic field B is directly linked to the magnetic flux density that is flowing in a 
given direction.
When electricity flows (electron flow) through the wire in a cable, every section 
of the wire has this field of force around it in a plane perpendicular to the wire. The 
strength of the magnetic field around a wire (cable) carrying a current depends on the 
current because it is the current that produces the field. The greater the current flow 
in a wire, the greater the strength of the magnetic field. A large current will produce 

173
Electromagnetic Sea
many lines of force extending far from the wire, while a small current will produce 
only a few lines close to the wire.
The EMF associated with new marine and hydrokinetic energy designs has not 
been quantified. However, there is considerable experience with submarine electri­
cal transmission cables, with some predictions and measurements of their associated 
electrical and magnetic fields. For example, the Wave Energy Technology (WET) 
generator will be housed in a canister buoy and connected to shore by a 1190-m-long, 
6.5-cm-diameter electrical cable. The cable is designed for three-phase AC transmis­
sion, can carry up to 250 kW and has multiple layers of insulation and armoring to 
contain the electrical current. Depending on the current flow (amperage), at 1 m from 
the cable, the magnetic field strength was predicted to range from 0.1 to 0.8 A/m and 
the magnetic flux density would range from 0.16 to 1.0 µT. The estimated strength 
of the electric field at the surface of the cable (apparently the iE) would range from 
1.5 to 10.5 mV/m. The electric field strength, magnetic field strength and magnetic 
flux density would all decrease exponentially with distance from the cable.
The Centre for Marine and Coastal Studies (CMACS, 2003) surveyed cable manu­
facturers and independent investigators to compile estimates of the magnitudes of E, 
B and iE fields. Most agreed that the E field can be completely contained within the 
cable by insulation. Estimates of the B field strength ranged from zero (by one manu­
facturer) to 1.7 and 0.61 µT at distances of 0 and 2.5 m from the cable respectively. 
By comparison, the Earth’s geomagnetic field strength ranges from approximately 20 
to 75 µT (Bochert & Zettler, 2006). In another study cited by CMACS (2003), a 150 kV 
cable carrying a current of 600 A generated an induced electric field (iE) of more than 
1 mV/m at a distance of 4 m from the cable; the field extended for approximately 
100 m before dissipating. Lower voltage/amperage cables generated similarly large iE 
fields near the cable, but the fields dissipated much more rapidly with distance.
For short-distance undersea transmission of electricity, three-phase AC power 
cables are most common; HVDC is used for longer-distance, high-power applica­
tions (Ohman et al., 2007). In AC cables the voltage and current alternate sinusoi­
dally at a given frequency (50 or 60 Hz), and therefore the E and B fields are also 
time-varying. That is, like AC current, the magnetic field induced by a three-phase 
AC current has a cycling polarity, which is not like the natural geomagnetic fields. 
On the other hand, the E and B fields produced by a direct current (DC) cable (e.g., 
HVDC) are static. Because the magnetic fields induced by DC and AC cables are 
different, they are likely to be perceived differently by aquatic organisms.
Because neither sand nor seawater has magnetic properties, burying a cable will 
not affect the magnitude of the magnetic (B) field; that is, the B fields at the same 
distance from the cable are identical, whether in water or sediment (CMACS, 2003). 
On the other hand, due to the higher conductivity of seawater compared to sand, the 
iE field associated with a buried cable is discontinuous across the sand/water bound­
ary; the iE field strength is greater in water than in sand at a given distance from the 
cable. For example, for the three-phase AC cable modeled by CMACS (2003), the 
estimated iE field strengths at 8 m from the cable were 10 µV/m and 1– 2 µV/m in 
water and sand, respectively.
The EMF generated by a multi-unit array of marine or hydrokinetic devices will 
differ from EMF associated with a single unit or from the single cable sources that 

174
The Science of Ocean Pollution
have been surveyed. Depending on the power generation device, a project may have 
electrical cable running vertically through the water column in addition to multiple 
cables running along the seabed or converging on a subsea pod. The EMF created by 
a matrix of cables has not been predicted or quantified.
Effects of Electromagnetic Fields on Aquatic Organisms
Electrical Fields
Natural electric fields can occur in the aquatic environment as a result of biochemi­
cal, physiological and neurological processes within an organism or as a result of 
an organism swimming through a magnetic field (Gill et al., 2005). Some of the 
elasmobranchs (e.g., sharks, skates, rays) have specialized tissues that enable them 
to detect electric fields (i.e., electroreception), an ability that allows them to detect 
prey and potential predators and competitors. Two species of Asian sturgeon have 
been reported to alter their behavior in changing electric fields (Basov, 1999; 2007). 
Other fish species (e.g., eels, cod, Atlantic salmon, catfish, paddlefish) will respond 
to induced voltage gradients associated with water movement and geomagnetic 
emissions (Colin and Whitehead, 2004; Wilkens & Hoffman, 2005), but their elec­
trosensitivity does not appear to be based on the same mechanism as sharks (Gill 
et al., 2005).
Bayayev and Fursa (1980) observed the reaction of 23 species of marine fish to 
electric currents in the laboratory. Visible reactions occurred following exposure 
to electric fields ranging from 0.6 to 7.2 V/m and varied depending on the species 
and orientation to the field. They noted that changes in the fishes’ electrocardio­
grams occurred at field strength 20 times lower than those that elicited observable 
behavioral response. Enger, Kristensen, and Sand (1976) found that European eels 
(Anguilla anguilla) exhibited a decelerated heart rate when exposed to a direct cur­
rent electrical field with a voltage gradient of about 400–600 µV/cm. In contrast, 
Rommel and McCleave (1972) observed much lower voltage thresholds of response 
(0.07–0.67 µV/cm) in American eels (Anguilla rostrata). The eels’ electrosensitivity 
measured by Rommel and McCleave is well within the range of naturally occurring 
oceanic electric fields of at least 0.10 µV/cm in many currents in the Atlantic Ocean 
and up to 0.46 µV/cm in the Gulf Stream.
Kalmijn (1982) described the extreme sensitivity of some elasmobranchs to elec­
tric fields. For example, the skate (Raja clavata) exhibited a cardiac response to uni­
form square-wave fields of 5 Hz at voltage gradients as low as 0.01 µV/cm. Dogfish 
(Mustelus canis) initiated attacks on electrodes from distances in excess of 38 cm 
and voltage gradients as small as 0.005 µV/cm.
Marra (1989) describes the interactions of elasmobranchs with submarine optical 
communications cables. The cable created an iE field (1 µV/m at 0.1 m) when sharks 
crossed the magnetic field induced by the cable. The sharks respond by attacking and 
biting the cable. Marra (1989) was unable to identify the specific stimuli that elicited 
the attacks, but he suggested that at close range the shark interpreted the electrical 
stimulus of the iE field as prey, which it then attacked.
The weak electric fields produced by swimming movements of zooplankton can 
be deterred by juvenile freshwater paddlefish (Polyodon spathula). Wojtenek et al. 

175
Electromagnetic Sea
(2001) used dipole electrodes to create electric fields that simulated those created 
by water flea (Daphnia sp.) swimming. They tested the effects of alteration current 
oscillations at frequencies ranging from 0.1 to 50 Hz and stimulus intensities ranging 
from 0.125 to 1.25 µA peak-to-peak amplitude. Paddlefish made significantly more 
feeding strikes at the electrodes at sinusoidal frequencies of 5–15 Hz compared to 
lower and higher frequencies. Similarly, the highest strike rate occurred at the inter­
mediate electric field strength (stimulus intensity of 0.25 µA peak-to-peak ampli­
tude). Strike rate was reduced at higher water conductivity, and their fish habituated 
(ceased to react) to repetitive dipole stimuli that were not reinforced by prey capture.
Gill and Taylor (2002; cited in CMACS, 2003) carried out a pilot study of the 
effects on dogfish of electric fields generated by a DC electrode in a laboratory tank. 
They reported that the dogfish avoided constant electric fields as small as 1000 µV/m, 
which would be produced by 150 kV cables with a current of 600 A. Conversely, the 
dogfish were attracted to a field of 10 µV/m at 0.1 m from the source, which is similar 
to the bioelectric fields emitted by dogfish prey. The electrical field created by the 
three-phase, AC cable modeled by CMACS (2003) would likely be detectable by a 
dogfish (or other similarly sensitive elasmobranches) at a radial distance of 20 m. It 
is possible that the ability of fish to discriminate an electrical field is a function of not 
only the size/intensity but also the frequency (Hz) of the emitted field.
Like elasmobranches, sturgeon (closely related to paddlefish) can utilize electro­
receptor senses to locate prey and may exhibit varying behavior at different electric 
field frequencies (Basow, 1999). For this reason, electrical fields are a concern as 
they may impact migration or the ability to find prey. The National Marine Fisheries 
Service (NMFS) proposed critical habitat for the Southern distinct population seg­
ment of the threatened North American green sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris) 
along the coastline out to the 110 m isobath lien (70 FR 52084-52110; September 8, 
2008). One of the principal constituent elements in the proposal is safe passage along 
the migratory corridor. Green sturgeons migrate extensively along the nearshore 
coast from California to Alaska, and there is concern that these fish may be deterred 
from migration by either low-frequency sounds or electromagnetic fields created 
during operation of marine energy facilities.
Magnetic Fields
Many terrestrial and aquatic animals can sense the Earth’s magnetic field and appear 
to use this magnetosensitivity for long-distance migrations. Aquatic species whose 
long-distance migrations or spatial orientation appear to involve magnetoreception 
include eels (Westerberg and Begout-Aranas, 1999; cited in CMACS, 2003), spiny 
lobsters (Boles & Lohmann, 2003), elasmobranchs (Kalmijn, 2000), sea turtles 
(Lohmann & Lohmann, 1996), rainbow trout (Walker et al., 1988), tuna and ceta­
ceans (Lohmann, Lohmann, & Endres, 2008a; Wiltschko & Wiltschko, 1995). Four 
species of Pacific salmon were found to have crystals of magnetite within them and it 
is believed that these crystals serve as a compass that orients to the Earth’s magnetic 
field (Mann et al., 1988; Walker et al., 1988). Because some aquatic species use the 
Earth’s magnetic field to navigate or orient themselves in space, there is a potential 
for the magnetic fields created by the numerous electrical cables associated with 
offshore power projects to disrupt these movements.

176
The Science of Ocean Pollution
Gill et al. (2005) placed magnetosensitive organisms into two categories: (1) those 
able to detect the iE field caused by movement through a natural or anthropogenic 
magnetic field and (2) those with detection systems based on ferromagnetic min­
erals (i.e., magnetite or greigite). Johnsen and Lohmann (2005; 2008) add a third 
possible mechanism for magnetosensitivity—chemical reactions involving proteins 
known as cytochromes (i.e., a class of flavoproteins that are sensitive to blue light; 
involved in circadian rhythm entrainment in plants, insects and mammals). Those 
species using the iE mode may either do it passively (i.e., the animal estimates its 
drift from the electric fields produced by the interaction between tidal/wind-driven 
currents and the vertical component of the Earth’s magnetic field) or actively (i.e., 
the animal derives its magnetic compass heading form its own interaction with the 
horizontal component of the Earth’s magnetic field). For example, Kalmijn (1982) 
suggested that the electric fields that elasmobranches induce by swimming through 
the Earth’s magnetic field may allow them to detect their magnetic compass head­
ings; the resulting voltage gradients may range from 0.05 to 0.5 µV/cm. Detection of 
a magnetic field based on internal deposits of magnetite occurs in a wide range of 
animals, including birds, insects, fish, sea turtles and cetaceans (Bochert & Zettler, 
2006; Gould, 1984). There is no evidence to suggest that seals are sensitive to mag­
netic fields (Gill et al., 2005).
Westerberg and Begout-Aranas (1999; cited in CMACS, 2003) studied the effects 
of a B field generated by a HVDC power cable on eels (Anguilla anguilla). The 
B field was on the same order of magnitude as the Earth’s geomagnetic field and, 
coming from a DC cable, was also a static field. Approximately 60% of the 25 eels 
tracked crossed the cable, and the authors concluded that the cable did not appear to 
act as a barrier to the eel migration. In another behavioral study, Meyer, Holland, and 
Papastamatiou (2004) showed that conditioned sandbar and scalloped hammerhead 
sharks readily respond to localized magnetic fields of 25–100 µT, a range of values 
that encompasses the strength of the Earth’s magnetic field.
Some sea turtles (see Sidebar 7.1) undergo transoceanic migrations before return­
ing to nest on or near the same beaches where they were hatched. Lohmann and 
Lohmann (1966) showed that sea turtles have the sensory abilities necessary to 
approximate their global position of a magnetic map. This would allow them to 
exploit unique combinations of magnetic field intensity and field line inclination 
in the ocean environment to determine direction and/or position during their long-
distance migrations. Irwin and Lohmann (2005) found that magnetic orientation 
in loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) can be disrupted at least temporarily by 
strong magnetic pulses (i.e., five brief pulses of 40,000 µT with a 4 ms rise time). The 
impact of a changed magnetic environment would depend upon the role of magnetic 
information in the hierarchy of cues used to orient/navigate (Wiltschko & Wiltschko, 
1995). Juvenile loggerheads deprived of either magnetic or visual information were 
still able to maintain a direction of orientation, but when both cues were removed, 
the turtles were disoriented (Avens & Lohmann, 2003). The magnetic map sense 
exhibited by hatchlings is also thought to allow female sea turtles to imprint upon the 
location of their natal beaches so that later in life they can return there to nest. This 
phenomenon is termed ‘natal homing’ (Lohmann, Putman, & Lohmann, 2008b), 
and it serves to drive genetic division among subpopulations of the same species. 

177
Electromagnetic Sea
As a result, altering magnetic fields near nesting beaches could potentially result 
in altered nesting patterns. Given the important role of magnetic information in the 
movements of sea turtles, impacts of magnetic field disruption could range from 
minimal (i.e., temporary disorientation near a cable or structure) to significant (i.e., 
altered nesting patterns and corresponding demographic shifts resulting from large-
scale magnetic field changes) and should be carefully considered with siting projects.
THE BOTTOM LINE
The truth be told we do not know what we do not know about the possible repercus­
sions of EMF exposure on land or in the seas. One thing is certain; however, we do 
know that the chances are better than good that all of us are exposed to electromag­
netic pollution on a daily basis. The more convenience society expects the greater 
EMF exposure. Keep in mind that we are perpetually surrounded by devices that 
emit EMF, including Wi-Fi routers, mobile phones, Bluetooth devices, etc.

Heated Oceans
INTRODUCTION
NASA on its website from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory posted a fact sheet on 
vital global ocean warming in which it highlighted the latest 2021 ocean temperature 
measurement and the reading: 337 (± 2) zettajoules since first measured and recorded 
in1955. Zettajoules SI prefix “zetta” represents a factor of 1021, or in exponential 
notation, 1E21. So 1 zettajoule equals 1021 joules. The symbol for joule is J and is 
also called a Newton meter, watt second or coulomb volt. For heat gain temperature 
measurement, it is conventional (and used in this text) to use Watts per square meter 
for different ocean depths as NASA (2023) used in its measurements of ocean heat 
content. NOAA reported its heat-gain rates findings on average over Earth’s surface 
during the 1993–2021 the heat-gain rates were 0.37 (± 0.05) to 0.44 (± 0.12) Watts per 
square meter for depths from 0 to 700 m (down to 0.4 miles). In the meantime, heat 
gain rates were 0.17 (±0.03) to 0.29 (±0.03) Watts per square meter for depths of 700–
2000 m (0.4–1.2 miles). The estimated increase for depths between 2000–6000 m 
(1.2–3.1 miles), the estimated increase was 0.07 (±0.03) Watts per square meter for the 
period from September 1992 to January 2012. According to the State of the Climate 
2021 report, “Summing the three latest (despite their slightly different time periods 
as given above), the full-depth ocean heat gain rate ranges from 0.64 to 0.80 W 
m-2 applied to Earth’s entire surface” (NOAA, 2023).
PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL COUPLING WITH THE ATMOSPHERE
The ocean couples with the atmosphere in two main ways. The first way is physi­
cally, through the exchange of heat, water and momentum. The ocean receives most 
of its heat along the equator, where incoming solar radiation is almost double of that 
received at the North and South Poles. This is the reason that sea surfaces are much 
warmer along the equator than at the poles.
Fluidity plays a huge role in in the ocean and atmosphere. It’s the air temperature 
gradients that primarily determine the speed and direction of air and sea currents. 
Winds are created by the oceans whenever heat rises and escapes the ocean warm­
ing the atmosphere. In turn, it is the wind pushing against the sea surface that drives 
ocean current patterns. Over the years, a complex series of system of currents was 
established whereby the ocean transports a remarkable amount of heat toward the 
poles. Note that heat escapes more readily into a cold atmosphere than a warm one, 
the northward flow of ocean and air currents is enhanced by the flow of heat escaping 
into the atmosphere and, ultimately, into outer space.
The ocean has high momentum inertia (i.e., resistance to change) and high 
temperature. It has a very slow circulation style as compared to the atmosphere, 
so changes in its systems generally occur over much longer time spans than in the 
15

180
The Science of Ocean Pollution
atmosphere, where, in a single day storms can form and dissipate in a single day. 
The atmosphere changes in a matter of minutes to hours to days whereas the ocean 
changes over periods from months to years to decades. There is no linear interaction 
between the ocean and atmosphere, and occurs over decades, which is why their 
“dialogue” is so hard to interpret (NOAA, 2023).
At the present time, scientists have suggested that the atmosphere provides 
the means for the ocean to extend its reach globally and set off, like dominoes, 
chaos of meteorological events. For example, during the 1997–1998 El Nino we 
witnessed record levels of rainfall in southern California—where it is normally 
an arid desert. NOAA (2023) pointed out that just before the El Nino, the tropi­
cal Indian Ocean warmed dramatically. Then the warming propagates across the 
Pacific. About 9 months into an El Nino, the new trade wind patterns cross over 
South America, and change the current patterns of the tropical Atlantic, bring­
ing drought to Brazil, where there is normally lush rainforest, and the African 
Sahel. Some scientists speculate about a decadal climatic pendulum swing regard­
ing ocean temperature oscillations between hot and cold. Scientists have come to 
call the mechanistic system by which the ocean drives climate change as the global 
heat engine.
The second way that ocean and atmosphere are linked is chemical, as the 
ocean is both a source and a sink of greenhouse gases. A lot of the heat that 
escapes the ocean is in the form of evaporated water, the most substantial green­
house gas by far. Note that water vapor also contributes to the formation of 
clouds, which shade the surface and have a net cooling effect. In the long run 
and facing another one of those we do not know what we do not know about 
these oceanic influences (shading from increased cloud formation or heat reten­
tion from higher levels of water vapor) will exert the larger influence on global 
temperatures.
In regard to ocean pollution it is carbon dioxide removal (i.e., the settling of car­
bon dioxide) from the atmosphere that is most important. Carbon dioxide settling in 
the oceans is of primary concern because the carbon dioxide pollution is linked to 
human activities. It all began with the Industrial Revolution and with it the increase 
of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere (and then into the oceans) of more than 30%, 
while, at the same time, average global temperatures have climbed about 0.5°C. A 
major problem with carbon dioxide settling in the atmosphere is that it takes approxi­
mately 100 years before it settles into the oceans or is taken out of the atmosphere by 
plants. Note that the oceanic removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere has a 
cooling effect on global temperatures.
Most of the world’s carbon (90%), measured over geological time, has settled in 
the ocean. There are several physical and biological processes that result in chemi­
cal exchanges between the atmosphere and ocean and between the upper ocean and 
deep ocean. Carbonate chemistry regulates much of the transfer of carbon dioxide 
from air to sea. Note, however, that it is biological processes, such as photosynthesis 
which turns carbon dioxide into organic material that also plays an important role. 
With the passage of time, organic carbon settles into the deep ocean—this process 
is referred to as the “biological pump.” The ocean’s biological pump is one of three 
ocean pumps discussed in the next section.

181
Heated Oceans
Ocean Pumps
There are three main pumps (or processes) involved in the carbon cycle that brings 
atmospheric carbon dioxide into the ocean interior and distributes it through the 
oceans. These three pumps are (1) the biological pump, (2) the solubility pump and 
(3) the carbonate pump.
Solubility Pump
The solubility pump is a physicochemical counterpart of the biological pump. This 
pump conveys significant amounts of carbon known as and in the form of dissolved 
inorganic carbon (DIC) from the ocean’s surface to its interior. This pump’s process 
is not biological instead it involves physical and chemical processes only (Raven & 
Falkowski, 1999).
The driver of the solubility pump are two processes in the ocean:
•	 A strong inverse function of seawater temperature is the solubility of carbon 
dioxide; and
•	 The deep water at high latitudes where seawater is usually cooler and denser 
drives the thermohaline circulation.
Seawater in the ocean’s interior (deep water) is formed under the same surface condi­
tions that promote carbon dioxide solubility, it contains a higher concentration of dis­
solved inorganic carbon than might be expected from average surface concentrations. 
Accordingly, the carbon from the atmosphere is pumped into the ocean’s interior when 
these two processes act together. Note that one consequence of this is that when deep 
water upwells in warmer, equatorial latitudes, it strongly outgasses carbon dioxide to 
the atmosphere because of the reduced solubility of the gas (Raven & Falkowski, 1999).
Carbonate Pump
Sometimes referred to as the “hard tissue” component of the biological pump, the 
carbonate pump fixes inorganic bicarbonate and causes a net release of carbon diox­
ide (Hain, Sigman, & Haug, 2014). Coccolithophores like some other surface marine 
organisms produce hard structures out of calcium carbonate, which is a form of par­
ticulate inorganic carbon, by fixing bicarbonate (Rost and Reibessel (2004). This is 
DIC fixation which is an important part of the oceanic carbon cycle.

DID YOU KNOW?
The total active pool of carbon at the Earth’s surface for durations of less than 
10,000 years is roughly 40,000 gigatons C (Gt C, a gigaton is one billion tons, 
or the weight of approximately 6 million blue whales), and about 95% (~38,000 
Gtr C) is stored in the ocean, mostly as dissolved inorganic carbon (Falkowskit 
et al., 2000; Schlesinger, 2013).

182
The Science of Ocean Pollution
Note that in regard to organisms, once this carbon is fixed into hard tissue, the 
organisms either stay in the euphotic zone to be recycled as part of the regenerative 
nutrient cycle or once they die, continue to the second phase of the biological pump 
and begin to sink to the ocean floor. The sinking particles often form aggregates as 
they sink, greatly increasing the sinking rate. These aggregates give particles a better 
chance of avoiding predation and decomposition in the water column and eventually 
reaching the ocean floor (de la Roche & Passow, 2014).
The Bottom Line: The Biological Pump is not the result of single process but is 
the combination of a number of processes each of which influences biological pump­
ing. Taken as a whole, the pump transfers about 11 gigatons of carbon every year 
into the ocean’s interior. This removes carbon from contact with the atmosphere 
for thousands of years or longer. An ocean without a biological pump would result 
in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels about 414 parts per million (for short “ppm”) 
higher than the present day.
2021 STATE OF THE CLIMATE HIGHLIGHTS
NOAA (2023) State of the Climate Report reported various climate indicators such 
as patterns, changes and trends of the global climate system. Examples of the indica­
tors include assorted types of greenhouse gases; temperatures not only in the oceans 
but also throughout the atmosphere and land; cloud cover; sea level; ocean salinity 
sea ice extent and snow cover.
Report highlights include these indications of a warming planet:
•	 Carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide—the dominant greenhouse 
gases—all reached new record highs.
•	 Lake surface temperatures were their highest on record.
•	 Global drought continued in 2021 and peaked at 32% of global land areas 
in August.
•	 Annual global sea surface temperature was lower than in 2019 and 2020 due 
in large part to La Nina, yet still 0.29°C higher than the 1991–2020 average.
•	 Ocean heat content and global sea level rise reached record levels.
DID YOU KNOW?
Biological carbon pump’s budget calculations are based on the ratio between 
sedimentation (i.e., carbon export to the ocean floor) and remineralization (i.e., 
release of carbon to the atmosphere.
DID YOU KNOW?
In 2021, the annual global CO2 concentration grew at its fifth highest-rate since 
1958.

Heated Oceans
THE BIG HEAT BUCKET
Sharks, whales, octopi, eels, coral reefs, El Nino, La Nina, tasty seafood and 
mysterious deep-water organisms and even assorted bottom feeders. Scott (2006) 
points out that all these things and others come to mind when we think of the 
world’s oceans. Experts and researchers have learned to think of the ocean as 
something different, something that is really not thought about or thought about 
to any degree. The ocean, they tell us, is Earth’s “biggest heat bucket.” And what 
this is all about is similar to overfilling a bucket under a water faucet, the ocean is 
filling up with heat that increasing levels of greenhouse gases are preventing from 
escaping to space.
By using satellites and in-the-water sensors NASA scientists compared computer 
simulations of Earth’s climate with countless measurements of ocean heat content. 
Climatologists and oceanographers have provided what NASA calls the “smoking 
gun” of human-caused global climate change. Their prediction of Earth’s energy 
imbalance closely matches real-world observations (Scott, 2006).
OCEAN SPECIFIC HEAT
Earth is an absorber and emitter of heat—some of this heat is radiated back into 
space. Oceans, along with land and ice, are active material constituents of Earth’s 
climate system along with the atmosphere. If conditions are perfect or balanced 
with the same amount of heat absorbed by Earth being radiated back into space that 
is when we have a balanced energy budget—and its temperature remains regular. 
However, if the incoming and outgoing energy is balanced (matched), the Earth is 
either warming or cooling over time; note that this is the case even if the change isn’t 
immediately perceptible.
When the greenhouse effect is mentioned, talked about or thought about, it is 
not uncommon for those doing the mentioning, talking about or thinking about the 
greenhouse effect to assume that the atmosphere is absorbing the incoming heat. The 
truth known is the atmosphere can’t hold that much heat; it lacks heat capacity. Heat 
capacity or thermal capacity (joule per kelvin –J/K), a physical property of matter, 
is the amount of energy that must be put into something to change its temperature, 
and air has very low heat capacity.
Ok, air has very low heat capacity, so where does all the incoming heat go? As 
stated earlier the heat ends up in the oceans with some heat going to land and ice. 
The oceans are the biggest absorbers of incoming heat but are actually slow to heat, 
to change temperature, while land heats up rather quickly.
Let’s get back to the atmosphere.
DID YOU KNOW?
The increased concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is directly 
related to combustion of fossil fuels, changes in land use and the production 
of cement.

184
The Science of Ocean Pollution
The main reason oceans heat more slowly than the atmosphere is the difference in 
their total mass. With regard to the atmosphere it only weighs a very small fraction 
of what the ocean weighs. Also, there is an intrinsic property of the atmosphere (air) 
that makes it not quite as good at hold heat as the ocean. That property is called spe­
cific heat. Specific heat is the heat capacity of a material per unit mass. The amount 
of heat (in calories) required to raise the temperature of one gram of a substance is 
1°C; the specific heat of water is 1 calorie.
OCEANS: EARTH’S HEAT SINK
When sunlight reaches the Earth’s surface. The world’s oceans absorb some of this 
energy and store it as heat. NASA’s (2023) Goddard Space Flight Center points out that 
“the world’s oceans are like brakes slowing down the full effects of greenhouse gas 
warming of the atmosphere.” The oceans have absorbed more than just the heat from the 
sun but also have absorbed 25% of human emissions of carbon dioxide and additionally 
90% of additional warming due to the greenhouse effect. Think about a massive sponge, 
the oceans, that pulls from the atmosphere heart carbon dioxide chlorofluorocarbons, 
oxygen and nitrogen and stores them in their depths for centuries and for the ages.
In the oceans, heat is initially absorbed at the surface; however, some of it eventu­
ally spread to deeper waters. Note that ocean currents also move this heat around 
the world. Water has a much higher heat capacity than air, meaning the oceans are 
a heat sink because they can absorb larger amounts of heat energy but with only a 
slight increase in temperature.
Ocean heat content (OHC) is the total amount of heat stored by the oceans, where 
it is stored where it is stored for indefinite time periods as internal energy or enthalpy 
(i.e., the sum of system internal energy and the product of its pressure and volume). 
Ocean temperature plays an important role in the Earth’s climate. Heat from the 
ocean surface provides energy for storms and thereby influences weather patterns.
Note that ocean temperature change is a slow process and takes centuries to heat 
up. This is the case even though oceans have absorbed more than 90% of the Earth’s 
extra heat since 1955 (IPCC, 2013; Levitus et al., 2012). If not for the large heat-
storage capacity provided by the ocean, the atmosphere would warm more rapidly 
(Levitus et al., 2012). Another result
Weather patterns, outside of Earth’s equatorial areas, are driven largely by ocean 
currents. Currents are movements of ocean water in a continuous flow, created 
largely by surface winds but also partly by temperature and Earth’s rotation, tides 
and salinity gradients. These currents art like conveyor belts, transporting warm 
water and precipitation from the equator toward the poles and cold water from the 
poles back to the tropics. Currents regulate global climate.
THE BOTTOM LINE
Heat radiated from Earth’s surface is having difficulty escaping into space because 
of the increase in greenhouse gas. A high percentage of the excess atmospheric heat 
is passed back to the ocean. As a result, upper ocean heat contents have increased 
significantly over the past few decades.

Ocean Acidification
ESSENTIAL PRINCIPLES OF OCEAN SCIENCES
It is difficult to impossible to understand ocean acidification without first knowing 
the essentials.1
For instance, most of the Earth’s water (97%) is in the ocean. Ocean water has 
unique properties. It is salty, its freezing point is slightly lower than fresh water, its 
density is slightly higher, its electrical conductivity is much higher and it is slightly 
basic. Balance of pH is vital for the health of the marine ecosystems and important 
in controlling the rate at which the ocean will absorb and buffer changes in atmo­
spheric carbon dioxide. The ocean is the largest reservoir of rapidly cycling carbon 
on Earth. Many organisms use carbon dissolves in the ocean to form shells, other 
skeletal pars and coral reefs.
It is environmental factors that define oceans. Simply, the oceans support a great 
deal of diversity of life and ecosystems. Due to the interaction of abiotic factors 
such as salinity, temperature, oxygen, pH, light, nutrients, pressure, substrate and 
circulation, ocean life is not evenly distributed temporally or spatially, that is, it is 
“irregular.” Some regions of the ocean support more diverse and abundant life than 
anywhere on Earth, while much of the ocean is considered a desert.
Changes in ocean temperature and pH due to human activities can affect the 
survival of some organisms and impact biological diversity (coral bleaching 
due to increased temperature and inhibition of shell formulation due to ocean 
acidification).
The Bottom Line: The ocean and humans are in extrinsically interconnected. The 
ocean and life in the ocean shape the features of the earth.
CLIMATE CHANGE’S EVIL TWIN
In a high carbon dioxide world, dangerous waters are ahead. With regard to 
Earth’s oceans, they are the repository, the sink of large amounts of carbon diox­
ide. This intake of carbon dioxide is actually an overload in the oceans and is, 
like its twin, climate change, causing a sea change, threatening fragile, finite 
marine life and, in turn, food security, livelihoods and local global economies 
(NOAA, 2016).
The oceans are like humungous sponges sponging/absorbing increasing amounts 
of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. As massive sponges the world’s oceans have 
absorbed more than 150 billion metric tons of carbon from human activities—this 
has occurred over the past 200 years. In 2016, that’s a worldwide average of 15 
pounds per person per week, enough to fill a coal train long enough to encircle the 
equator 13 times every year (NOAA, 2016).

Carbon, which is an essential ingredient of all living things, is the basic building 
block of the large organic molecules necessary for life. Carbon is cycled into food 
chains from the atmosphere, as shown in Figure 16.1. From Figure 16.1, it can be 
seen that green plants obtain carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air and, through photo­
synthesis, described by Asimov (1989) as the “most important chemical process on 
Earth,” produce the food and oxygen that all organisms live on. Part of the carbon 
produced remains in living matter; the other part is released as CO2 in cellular respi­
ration. Miller (1988) points out that the carbon dioxide released by cellular respira­
tion in all living organisms is returned to the atmosphere.
Some carbon is contained in buried dead and animal and plant materials. Much 
of these buried animal and plant materials were transformed into fossil fuels. Fossil 
fuels, coal, oil and natural gas, contain large amounts of carbon. When fossil fuels 
are burned, stored carbon combines with oxygen in the air to form carbon dioxide, 
which enters the atmosphere. In the atmosphere, carbon dioxide acts as a beneficial 
heat screen as it does not allow the radiation of Earth’s heat into space. This balance 
is important. The problem is that as more carbon dioxide from burning is released 
into the atmosphere, the balance can and is being altered. Odum (1983) warns that the 
recent increase in consumption of fossil fuels “coupled with the decrease in ‘removal 
capacity’ of the green belt is beginning to exceed the delicate balance.” Massive

At STP (Standard Temperature and Pressure), one ton of carbon dioxide would 
fill a sphere 32 feet (about 9.8 m) in diameter. The average car in the United 
States will produce this over a three-month period.

increases in carbon dioxide into the atmosphere tend to increase the possibility of 
global warming. The consequences of global warming “would be catastrophic … 
and the resulting climatic change would be irreversible” (Abrahamson, 1988).
The ocean’s role in the global carbon cycle is critical as it is a vast reservoir of 
carbon, that naturally exchanges carbon with the atmosphere, and consequently 
takes up an enormous portion of human-released (anthropogenic) carbon from the 
atmosphere. This accumulation of carbon in the ocean may also be impacting marine 
life through a process known as acidification.
When oceans take in atmospheric carbon dioxide the carbon dioxide dissolves in 
sweater, series of chemical reactions occur resulting in the increased concentration 
of hydrogen ions. This increase causes the seawater to become more acidic. Ocean 
acidification refers to a reduction in the pH of the ocean over an extended period of 
time, again, caused primarily by the uptake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. 
Coast acidification refers to the same processes resulting from absorption of carbon 
dioxide, as well as a number of additional, local-level processes, including the excess 
input of nutrients from shore (from fertilizers, wastewater, animal manure and more). 
Note that coastal acidification generally exhibits more variability over shorter time 
scales relative to open-ocean acidification. Acidification is affecting the entire 
world’s oceans. As the pH of ocean water decreases, there is a resulting decrease in 
the amount of carbonate ions available for many marine organisms to form their 
calcium carbonate shells. Oysters, clams, corals and other shell-building creatures 
are less able to precipitate the mineral aragonite, which they use to build or rebuild 
their skeletons. As marine life is impacted, so too are economics that are dependent 
on fish and shellfish for food.
The bottom line here is that ocean acidification is often called climate change’s 
“evil twin.” The overload of carbon dioxide in our oceans is literally causing a sea 
change, threatening fragile, finite marine life and, in turn, food security, livelihoods 
and local global economics (NOAA, 2016).
The truth known is that the consequences of disrupting what has been a relatively 
stable ocean environment for tens of millions of years are beginning to show. It’s 
all about carbonic acid. Carbon dioxide in massive amounts dissolves in seawater

and is converted into carbonic acid. This process of ocean acidification is literally 
causing a sea change that is threatening the fundamental chemical balance of ocean 
and coastal waters from pole to pole. One of the immediate concerns is that corro­
sive waters are increasingly making it difficult for fragile marine life to build their 
protective shells and skeletons. Each of these stressors is a problem. However, since 
all three stressors are hitting out oceans at one time is a triple threat, with enormous 
implications for food security, local to global economies, jogs and vital consumer 
goods and services.
At the present time we do not know what we do not know about ocean acidi­
fication. What we do know is that the consequences can be profound. What we 
have now is a three-way attack of stressors to vulnerable species by the increas­
ing acidified water, ocean warming and the decrease in oxygen that is critical to 
marine life.
OSTEOPOROSIS OF THE SEA
Ocean acidification impacts sea corals and shelled sea life. We are finding 
daunting list of hotspots. For good reason, ocean acidification is called “osteo­
porosis of the sea.” Acidification of the sea can create conditions that literally 
eat away at the minerals that oysters, clams, lobsters, shrimp, coral reefs, some 
seaweed plants and other marine life use to build their shells and skeletons 
(NOAA, 2016).
Pteropods
Pteropods, or sea butterflies, is a tiny sea snail that is the size of a small pea and are 
a vital source of food for salmon and other commercially important fish. Researchers 
estimate that the percentage of pteropods in various ocean regions have dissolving 
shells due to ocean acidification which has doubled in the nearshore habitats. This 
has occurred since the pre-industrial era and is on track to triple by 2050 when 
coastal waters become 70% more corrosive than in the pre-industrial era due to 
human-caused ocean acidification.
THE BOTTOM LINE
Ocean acidification impacts ocean species to varying degrees. Not all the news is bad 
about carbon dioxide in the oceans causing acidification. This is the case because 
to live just like the plants on land photosynthetic algae and seagrasses benefit from 
high carbon dioxide levels in the oceans, as they require carbon dioxide. On the other 
hand, research has shown that lower environmental calcium carbonate saturation 
states a dramatic effect on some calcifying species, including clams, oysters, sea 
urchins, shallow water corals, deep sea corals and calcareous plankton. The truth 
of the matter is that more than a billion people worldwide depend on food from the 
ocean as their primary source of protein. The point is that both food security and 
jobs in the United States and around the world depend on the fish and shellfish in 
our oceans.

Ocean Hypoxia
INTRODUCTION
In Chapter 9, Case Study 9.1 presented a Modest Proposal concerning the nutri­
ent pollution of Chesapeake Bay leading to dead zones due to hypoxia. Hypoxia in 
general and marine hypoxia are certain factors related to ocean pollution. Simply 
defined: Marine Hypoxia (aka Ocean Pollution) is a shortage of dissolved oxygen. 
Ocean hypoxia is a growing, worldwide problem that can have dramatic impacts on 
marine life and ecosystems. A decline in oxygen in sea water is generally recognized 
as one of the likely consequences of global climate change; warm water does not 
hold as much oxygen. This situation may be naturally occurring or be exacerbated or 
directly caused by human influences.
Water temperature is one of the most important characteristics of the ocean. 
Warming of ocean water affects:
•	 Dissolved oxygen levels—the solubility of oxygen decreases as water tem­
perature increases,
•	 Biological processes—temperature affects metabolism, reproduction and 
growth.
•	 Chemical processes—temperature affects the solubility and reaction rates 
of chemicals. By and large, the rate of chemical reactions increases with 
increasing water temperature.
•	 Water density and stratification—water is most dense at 4°C. Differences 
in water temperature and density between layers of water in a water body 
lead to stratification and seasonal turnover in lakes.
•	 Aquatic ecosystem species diversity—many aquatic species can survive 
only within a limited temperature range.
•	 Environmental cues for life—changes in water temperatures can signal 
aquatic insects to emerge or fish to spawn.
The most important source of heat for ocean water is generally the sun, although 
the temperature can also be affected by the temperature of water inputs (such as pre­
cipitation. Surface runoff, groundwater and water from various tributary sources).
DID YOU KNOW?
The amount of oxygen that dissolves in water can vary in daily and seasonal pat­
terns and decreases with higher temperature, salinity and elevation. The maxi­
mum solubility of oxygen in water at 1 atm pressure at sea level)ranges from 
about 15 mg/L at 0°C to 8mg/L at 30°C—the important point is, ice-cold water 
can hold twice as much dissolved oxygen as warm water (Spellman, 2020).

The Science of Ocean Pollution
With regard to surface runoff most elementary students learn early in their edu­
cation process that water on Earth flows downhill—from land to the sea. However, 
they may or may not be told that water flows downhill toward the sea by various 
routes. The route (or pathway) that we are primarily concerned with is the surface 
water route taken by surface water runoff. Surface runoff is dependent on various 
factors. For example, climate, vegetation, topography, geology, soil characteris­
tics and land-use determine how much surface runoff occurs compared with other 
pathways.
The primary source (input) of water to total surface runoff, of course, is precipi­
tation. This is the case even though a substantial portion of all precipitation input 
returns directly to the atmosphere by evapotranspiration. Evapotranspiration is a 
combination process, as the name suggests whereby water in plant tissue and in the 
soil evaporates and transpires to water vapor in the atmosphere. A substantial por­
tion of precipitation input returns directly to the atmosphere by evapotranspiration. 
It is also important to point out that when precipitation occurs, some rainwater is 
intercepted by vegetation where it evaporates, never reaching the ground or being 
absorbed by plants. A large portion of the rainwater that reaches the surface on 
ground, in lakes and streams also evaporates directly back to the atmosphere.
Although plants display a special adaptation to minimize transpiration, plants still 
lose water to the atmosphere during the exchange of gases necessary for photosyn­
thesis. Notwithstanding the large percentage of precipitation that evaporates, rain- or 
melt-water that reaches the ground surface follows several pathways in reaching a 
stream channel or groundwater.
Soil can absorb rainfall to its infiltration capacity (i.e., to its maximum rate). 
During a rain event, this capacity decreases. Any rainfall in excess of infiltration 
capacity accumulates on the surface. When this surface water exceeds the depression 
storage capacity of the surface, it moves as an irregular sheet of overland flow. In arid 
areas, overland flow is likely because of the low permeability of the soil. Overland 
flow is also likely when the surface is frozen and/or when human activities have ren­
dered the land surface less permeable. In humid areas, where infiltration capacities 
are high, overland flow is rare.
In rain events, where the infiltration capacity of the soil is not exceeded, rain pen­
etrates the soil and eventually reaches the groundwater—from which it discharges 
to the stream slowly and over a long period. This phenomenon helps to explain why 
stream flows through a dry weather region remains constant; the flow is continuously 
augmented by groundwater. This type of stream is known as a perennial stream, 
as opposed to an intermittent one, because the flow continues during periods of no 
rainfall.
When a stream courses through a humid region, it is fed water via the water 
table, which slopes toward the stream channel. Discharge from the water table into 
the stream accounts for flow during periods without precipitation and explains why 
this flow increases, even without tributary input, as one proceeds downstream. Such 
streams are called gaining or effluent, as opposed to losing or influent streams that 
lose water into the ground (see Figure 17.1). The same stream can shift between gain­
ing and losing conditions along its course because of changes in underlying strata 
and local climate.

195
Ocean Hypoxia
The current velocity (speed) of water (driven by gravitational energy) in a chan­
nel varies considerably within a stream’s cross-section owing to friction with the 
bottom and sides, with sediment, and the atmosphere, and to sinuosity (bending or 
curving) and obstructions. Highest velocities, obviously, are found where friction is 
least, generally at or near the surface and near the center of the channel. In deeper 
streams, current velocity is greatest just below the surface due to the friction with 
the atmosphere; in shallower streams, current velocity is greatest at the surface due 
to friction with the bed. Velocity decreases as a function of depth, approaching zero 
at the substrate surface.
The bottom line on surface water flow: eventually all water flows to the sea (one 
way or another).
TOO MUCH OR TOO LITTLE OXYGEN
Besides situations whereby there may be too little dissolved oxygen in the ocean, 
there is also the possibility that there might be too much oxygen in the water—
the water might be oxygen saturated. Oxygen saturation in aquatic environments 
is the ratio of the concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO) to the maximum amount 
of oxygen that will dissolve in that water body, at the temperature and pressure 
which constitute stable equilibrium conditions. Note that well-aerated water (such

196
The Science of Ocean Pollution
as a fast-moving river) without oxygen producers or consumers is 100% saturated 
(Spellman, 2020).
Supersaturation of water (more than 100% saturation) in ‘stagnant’ water can 
occur whenever there is the presence of photosynthetic aquatic oxygen producers or 
if there is a slow equilibration after a change of atmospheric conditions.
Stagnant water? Isn’t stagnant water defined as freshwater bodies where the water 
is not moving?
Yes and Yes. Correct on both questions. In surface water bodies such as lakes, 
bogs, ponds, lagoons, swamps, estuaries and ‘Still Waters’ (i.e., defined as river 
ponds in this book—see chapter 9) where flow has stopped.
In the freshwater bodies mentioned above, a common measure of water stagna­
tion is the Biotic Index.
The Biotic Index is a scale, a systematic survey of macroinvertebrates organ­
isms (i.e., animals that lack a spine and are large enough to be seen with the naked 
eye—freshwater macroinvertebrates include aquatic insects, crayfish, snails, clams 
and worms). Because the diversity of species in a stream is often a good indicator 
of the presence of pollution, the biotic index can be used to correlate with stream 
quality. Observation of types of species present or missing is used as an indicator of 
stream pollution. The biotic index, used in the determination of the types, species 
and numbers of biological organisms present in a stream, is commonly used as an 
auxiliary to BOD determination in determining stream pollution. The biotic index is 
based on two principles:
1.	A large dumping of organic waste into a stream tends to restrict the variety 
of organisms at a certain point in the stream.
2.	As the degree of pollution in a stream increases key organisms tend to dis­
appear in a predictable order. The disappearance of particular organisms 
tends to indicate the water quality of the stream.
Several different forms of the biotic index. In Great Britain, for example, the 
Trent Biotic Index (TBI), the Chandler score, the Biological Monitoring Working 
Party (BMWP) score and the Lincoln Quality Index (LQI) are widely used. Most 
of the forms use a biotic index that ranges from 0 to 10. The most polluted stream, 
which therefore contains the smallest variety of organisms, is at the lowest end of the 
scale (0); the clean streams are at the highest end (10). A stream with a biotic index of 
greater than 5 will support game fish; on the other hand, a stream with a biotic index 
of less than 4 will not support game fish.
As mentioned, because they are easy to sample, macroinvertebrates have pre­
dominated in biological monitoring. Macroinvertebrates are a diverse group. They 
demonstrate tolerances that vary between species. Thus, discrete differences tend to 
show up, containing both tolerant and sensitive indicators. Macroinvertebrates can 
be easily identified using identification keys that are portable and easily used in field 
settings. Present knowledge of macroinvertebrate tolerances and response to stream 
pollution is well documented. In the United States, for example, the Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) has required states in incorporate narrative biological cri­
teria into its water quality standards by 1993. The National Park Service (NPS) has 

197
Ocean Hypoxia
collected macroinvertebrate samples from American streams since 1984. Through 
their sampling effort, NPS has been able to derive quantitative biological standards 
(Spellman, 2020).
The biotic index provides a valuable measure of pollution. This is especially the 
case for species that are very sensitive to a lack of oxygen. An example of an organ­
ism that is commonly used in biological monitoring is the stonefly. Stonefly larvae 
live underwater and survive best in well-aerated, unpolluted waters with clean gravel 
bottoms. When stream water quality deteriorates due to organic pollution, stonefly 
larvae cannot survive. In the author’s expert in the Shenandoah River I found that 
the degradation of stonefly larvae has an exponential effect upon other insects and 
fish that feed off the larvae; when the stonefly larvae disappear, so in turn do many 
insects and fish (Spellman, 2020).
Table 17.1 shows a modified version of the BMWP biotic index. Considering that 
the BMWP biotic index indicates ideal stream conditions, it considers the sensi­
tivities of different macroinvertebrate species are represented by diverse popula­
tions and are excellent indicators of pollution. These aquatic macroinvertebrates are 
organisms that are large enough to be seen by the unaided eye. Moreover, most 
aquatic macroinvertebrates species live for at least a year; and they are sensitive to 
stream water quality both on a short-term basis and over the long term. For example, 
mayflies, stoneflies and caddisflies are aquatic macroinvertebrates that are consid­
ered clean-water organisms; they are generally the first to disappear from a stream 
if water quality declines and are, therefore, given a high score. On the other hand, 
tubificid worms (which are tolerant to pollution) are given a low score.
In Table 17.1, a score from 1 to 10 is given for each family present. A site score 
is calculated by adding the individual family scores. The site score or total score is 
then divided by the number of families recorded to derive the Average Score Per 
Taxon (ASPT). High ASPT scores result due to such taxa as stoneflies, mayflies and 
caddisflies being present in the stream. A low ASPT score is obtained from streams 
that are heavily polluted and dominated by tubificid worms and other pollution-
tolerant organisms. From Table 17.1, it can be seen that those organisms having high 
scores, especially mayflies and stoneflies, are the most sensitive and others, such as

dragonflies and caddisflies, are very sensitive to any pollution (deoxygenation) of 
their aquatic environment.
As noted earlier, the benthic macroinvertebrate biotic index employs the use of 
certain benthic macroinvertebrates to determine (to gauge) the water quality (relative 
health) of a water body (stream or river). Benthic macroinvertebrates are classified 
into three groups based on their sensitivity to pollution. The number of taxa in each 
of these groups are tallied and assigned a score. The scores are then summed to yield 
a score that can be used as an estimate of the quality of the water body life.
Is it not true that Table 17.1, the biotic index, is actually and especially designed 
for the evaluation of streams and rivers and not oceans?
Yes, the biotic index is commonly used to measure the quality of (the DO levels) 
the river, stream, lake and other surface body systems but it can be and is used to 
measure seawater also. I have used the biotic index (modified for checking the qual­
ity of saltwater—that is, for the different saltwater species types compared to fresh­
water species) in Chesapeake Bay during the 1996–2005 timeframe, for example.
Note: Let’s first look at freshwater macroinvertebrates and those used in saltwater 
systems.
INSECT MACROINVERTEBRATES (FRESHWATER 
QUALITY INDICATORS)1
The most important insects groups in streams are Ephemeroptera (mayflies), Plecoptera 
(stoneflies), Trichoptera (caddisflies), Diptera (true flies), Coleoptera (beetles), 
Hemiptera (bugs), Megaloptera (alderflies and dobsonflies) and Odonata (dragonflies 
and damselflies). The identification of these different orders is usually easy and there 
are many keys and specialized references (e.g., Merritt & Cummins, An Introduction 
to the Aquatic Insects of North America, 1980) available to help in the identification of 
species. In contrast, for some genera and species, specialist taxonomists can often only 
diagnose particularly the Diptera. As mentioned, insect macroinvertebrates are ubiqui­
tous in streams and are often represented by many species. Although the numbers refer 
to aquatic species, a majority is to be found in streams.
Mayflies (Order: Ephemeroptera)
Description: Wing pads may be present on the thorax; three pairs of segmented 
legs attach to the Thorax; one claw occurs on the end of the segmented legs; 
gills occur on the abdominal segments and are attached mainly to the sides 
DID YOU KNOW?
In order for water to support life, there must be oxygen dissolved into the liquid. 
Note, however, that oxygen is not part of the water molecule, H2O, but is oxy­
gen gas, O2 dissolved in water—DO. There are a few ways to measure the DO 
content. One is by meter and DO can be measured using titration or by using 
colorimetric methods, where a reactive substance responds to the oxygen levels.

of the abdomen, but sometimes extend over the top and bottom of the abdo­
men; gills consist of either flat plates or filaments; there long thin caudal 
(tails filaments) usually occur at the end of the abdomen, but there may only 
be two in some kinds.
Streams and rivers are generally inhabited by many species of mayflies and, in 
fact, most species are restricted to streams. For the experienced freshwater ecologist 
who looks upon a mayfly nymph, recognition is obtained through trained observa­
tion: abdomen with leaf-like or feather-like gills, legs with a single tarsal claw, gen­
erally (but not always) with three cerci (three ‘tails;’ two cerci, and between them 
usually a terminal filament; see Figure 17.2). The experienced ecologist knows that 
mayflies are hemimetabolous insects (i.e., where larvae or nymphs resemble wing­
less adults) that go through many postembryonic molts, often in the range between 
20 and 30. For some species, body length increases about 15% for each instar.
Mayfly nymphs are mainly grazers or collector-gatherers feeding on algae and 
fine detritus, although a few genera are predatory. Some members filter particles 
from the water using hair-fringed legs or maxillary palps. Shredders are rare among 
mayflies. In general, mayfly nymphs tend to live mostly in unpolluted streams, where 
with densities of up to 10,000/sq. meter, they contribute substantially to secondary 
producers.
Adult mayflies resemble nymphs, but usually possess two pairs of long, lacy 
wings folded upright; adults usually have only two cerci. The adult lifespan is short, 
ranging from a few hours to a few days, rarely up to two weeks, and the adults do not 
feed. Mayflies are unique among insects in having two winged stages, the subimago 
and the imago. The emergence of adults tends to be synchronous, thus ensuring the 
survival of enough adults to continue the species.

The Science of Ocean Pollution
Stoneflies (Order: Plecoptera)
Description: Long thin antenna projects in front of the head; wing pads usu­
ally present on the thorax but may only be visible in older larvae; three pairs 
of segmented legs attach to the thorax; two claws are located at the end of 
the segmented legs; gills occur on the thorax region, usually on the legs or 
bottom of the thorax, or there may be no visible gills (usually there are none 
or very few gills on the abdomen); gills are either single or branched fila­
ments; two long thin tails project from the rear of the abdomen. Stoneflies 
have a very low tolerance to many insults; however, several families are 
tolerant of slightly acidic conditions (see Figure 17.3).
Although many freshwater ecologists would maintain that the stonefly is a well-
studied group of insects, this is not exactly the case. Despite their importance, less than 
5–10% of stonefly species are well known with respect to life history, trophic interac­
tions, growth, development, spatial distribution and nymphal behavior. Notwithstanding 
our lacking extensive knowledge in regard to stoneflies, enough is known to provide an 
accurate characterization of these aquatic insects. We know, for example, that stonefly 
larvae are characteristic inhabitants of cool, clean streams (i.e., most nymphs occur 
under stones in well-aerated streams). While they are sensitive to organic pollution, or 
more precisely to low oxygen concentrations accompanying organic breakdown pro­
cesses, stoneflies seem rather tolerant to acidic conditions. The lack of extensive gills at 
least partly explains their relative intolerance of low oxygen levels.
Stoneflies are drab-colored, small- to medium-sized 1/6– 2 ¼ inches (4–60 mm), 
rather flattened insects. Stoneflies have long, slender, many-segmented antennae and 
two long narrow antenna-like structures (cerci) on the tip of the abdomen. The cerci 
may be long or short. At rest, the wings are held flat over the abdomen, giving a 
“square-shouldered” look compared to the roof-like position of most caddisflies and 
FIGURE 17.3  Stonefly (Plecoptera order).

the vertical position of the mayflies. Stoneflies have two pairs of wings. The hind 
wings are slightly shorter than the forewings and much wider, having a large anal 
lobe that is folded fanwise when the wings are at rest. This fanlike folding of the 
wings gives the order its name: “pleco” (folded or plaited) and “-ptera” (wings). 
The aquatic nymphs are generally very similar to mayfly nymphs except that they 
have only two cerci at the tip of the abdomen. The stoneflies have chewing mouth­
parts. They may be found anywhere in a non-polluted stream where food is available. 
Many adults, however, do not feed and have reduced or vestigial mouthparts.
Stoneflies have a specific niche in high-quality streams where they are very 
important as a fish food source at specific times of the year (winter to spring, espe­
cially) and of the day. They complement other important food sources, such as cad­
disflies, mayflies and midges.
Caddisflies (Order: Trichoptera)
Description: Head has a thick hardened skin; antennae are very short, usually 
not visible; no wing pads occur on the thorax; top of the first thorax always 
has a hardened plate and in several families, the second and third section 
of the thorax have a hardened plate; three pairs of segmented legs attach 
to the thorax; abdomen has a thin soft skin; singe of branched gills on the 
abdomen in many families, but some have no visible gills; pair of prologs 
with one claw on each, is situated at the end of the abdomen; most families 
construct various kinds of retreats consisting of a wide variety of materials 
collected from the streambed.
Trichoptera (Greek: trichos, a hair; ptera, wing), is one of the most diverse insect 
orders living in the stream environment, and caddisflies have nearly a worldwide 
distribution (the exception: Antarctica). Caddisflies may be categorized broadly into 
free-living (roving and net spinning) and case-building species.
Caddisflies are described as medium-sized insects with bristle-like and often 
long antennae. They have membranous hairy wings (which explains the Latin name 
“Trichos”), which are held tent-like over the body when at rest, most are weak fliers. 
They have greatly reduced mouthparts and five tarsi. The larvae are mostly cater­
pillar-like and have a strongly sclerotized (hardened) head with very short antennae 
and biting mouthparts. They have well-developed legs with a single tarsi. The abdo­
men is usually 10-segmented, in case-bearing species the first segment bears three 
papillae, one dorsally and the other two laterally which help hold the insect centrally 
in its case allowing a good flow of water passed the cuticle and gills, the last or anal 
segment bears a pair of grappling hooks.
In addition to being aquatic insects, caddisflies are superb architects. Most cad­
disfly larvae (see Figure 17.4) live in self-designed, self-built houses, called cases. 
They spin out silk, and either lives in silk nets or use the silk to stick together bits of 
whatever is lying on the stream bottom. These houses are so specialized, that you 
can usually identify a caddisfly larva to genus if you can see its house (case). With 
nearly 1400 species of caddisfly species in North America (north of Mexico), this is 
a good thing!

202
The Science of Ocean Pollution
Caddisflies are closely related to butterflies and moths (Order: Lepidoptera). They 
live in most stream habitats and that is why they are so diverse (have so many spe­
cies). Each species has special adaptations that allow it to live in the environment it 
is found in.
Mostly herbivorous, most caddisflies feed on decaying plant tissue and algae. 
Their favorite algae are diatoms, which they scrape off rocks. Some of them, though, 
are predacious.
Caddisfly larvae can take a year or two to change into adults. They then change 
into pupae (the inactive stage in the metamorphosis of many insects, following the 
larval stage and preceding the adult form) while still inside their cases for their meta­
morphosis. It is interesting to note that caddisflies, unlike stoneflies and mayflies, go 
through a “complete” metamorphosis.
Caddisflies remain as pupae for 2–3 weeks and then emerge as adults. When they 
leave their pupae, splitting their case, they must swim to the surface of the water 
to escape it. The winged adults fly evening and night, and some are known to feed 
on plant nectar. Most of them will live less than a month: like many other winged 
stream insects, their adult lives are brief compared to the time they spend in the 
water as larvae.
Caddisflies are sometimes grouped by the kinds of cases they make into five main 
groups: free-living forms that do not make cases, saddle-case makers, purse-case 
makers, net-spinners and retreat-makers and tube-case makers. Caddisflies demon­
strate their architectural talents in the cases they design and make. For example, a 
caddisfly might make a perfect, 4-sided box case of bits of leaves and bark, or tiny 
bits of twigs. It may make a clumsy dome of large pebbles. Others make rounded 
tubes out of twigs or very small pebbles. In our experience in gathering caddisflies, 
we have come to appreciate not only their architectural ability but also their flare 
in the selection of construction materials. For example, we have found many cad­
disfly cases constructed of silk, emitted through an opening at the tip of the labium, 
used together with bits of ordinary rock mixed with sparkling quartz and red garnet, 
green peridot and bright fool’s gold.
In addition to the protection their cases provide them, the cases provide another 
advantage. The cases actually help caddisflies breathe. They move their bodies up 
and down, back and forth inside their cases, and this makes a current that brings 
them fresh oxygen. The less oxygen there is in the water, the faster they have to 
move. It has been seen that caddisflies inside their cases get more oxygen than those

that are outside of their cases—and this is why stream ecologists think that cad­
disflies can often be found even in still waters, where dissolved oxygen is low, in 
contrast to stoneflies and mayflies.
True Flies (Order: Diptera)
Description: Head may be a capsule-like structure with thick hard skin; head 
may be partially reduced so that it appears to be part of the thorax, or it may 
be greatly reduced with only the mouthparts visible; no wing pads occur on 
the thorax; false-legs (pseudo-legs) may extend from various sections of the 
thorax and abdomen composed of entirely soft skin, but some families have 
hardened plates scattered on various body features. The larval states do not 
have segmented leg features.
True or two- (Di-) winged (ptera) flies not only include the flies that we are most 
familiar with, like fruit flies and houseflies, they also include midges (see Figure 17.5), 
mosquitoes and craneflies (see Figure 17.6). Houseflies and fruit flies live only on land, 
and we do not concern ourselves with them. Some, however, spend nearly their whole 
lives in water; they contribute to the ecology of streams.
True flies are in the order Diptera and are one of the most diverse orders of the 
class Insecta, with about 120,000 species worldwide. Dipteran larvae occur almost 
everywhere except Antarctica and deserts where there is no running water. They 
may live in a variety of places within a stream: buried in sediments, attached to 
rocks, beneath stones, in saturated wood or moss or in silken tubes, attached to the 
stream bottom. Some even live below the stream bottom.
True fly larvae may eat almost anything, depending on their species. Those with 
brushes on their heads use them to strain food out of the water that passes through. 
Others may eat algae, detritus, plants and even other fly larvae.
The longest part of the true fly’s life cycle, like that of mayflies, stoneflies and 
caddisflies, is the larval stage. It may remain an underwater larva for anywhere from 
a few hours to five years. The colder the environment, the longer it takes to mature. 
It pupates and emerges, then, and becomes a winged adult. The adult may live four

FIGURE 17.6  Cranefly larvae.

204
The Science of Ocean Pollution
months—or it may only live for a few days. While reproducing, it will often eat plant 
nectar for the energy it needs to make its eggs. Mating sometimes takes place in 
aerial swarms. The eggs are deposited back in the stream; some females will crawl 
along the stream bottom, losing their wings, to search for the perfect place to put 
their eggs. Once they lay them, they die.
Diptera serve an important role in cleaning water and breaking down decaying 
material, and they are a vital food source (i.e., they play pivotal roles in the process­
ing of food energy) for many of the animals living in and around streams. However, 
the true flies most familiar to us are the midges, mosquitoes and the craneflies 
because they are pests. Some midge flies and mosquitoes bite; the cranefly, however, 
does not bite but looks like a giant mosquito.
Like mayflies, stoneflies and caddisflies, true flies are mostly in larval form. Like 
caddisflies, you can also find their pupae, because they are holometabolous insects 
(go through complete metamorphosis). Most of them are free-living; that is, they 
can travel around. Although none of the true fly larvae have the six, jointed legs we 
see on the other insects in the stream, they sometimes have strange little almost-legs 
(prologs) to move around with. Others may move somewhat like worms do, and 
some—the ones who live in waterfalls and rapids—have a row of six suction discs 
that they use to move much like a caterpillar does. Many use silk pads and hooks at 
the ends of their abdomens to hold them fast to smooth rock surfaces.
Beetles (Order: Coleoptera)
Description: Head has thick hardened skin; thorax and abdomen of most adult 
families have moderately hardened skin, several larvae have a soft-skinned 
abdomen; no wing pads on the thorax in most larvae, but wing pads are 
usually visible on adults; three pairs of segmented legs attach to the tho­
rax; no structures. Or projections extend from the sides of the abdomen in 
most adult families, but some larval stages have flat plates or filaments; no 
prolegs or long tapering filaments at the end of the abdomen. Beetles are 
one of the most diverse insect groups but are not as common in aquatic 
environments.
Of the more than 1 million described species of insect, at least one-third are 
beetles, making the Coleoptera not only the largest order of insects but also the most 
diverse order of living organisms. Even though the most speciose order of terrestrial 
insects, surprisingly their diversity is not so apparent in running waters. Coleoptera 
belongs to the infraclass Neoptera, division Endopterygota. Members of this order 
have an anterior pair of wings (the elytra) that are hard and leathery and not used in 
flight; the membranous hindwings, which are used for flight, are concealed under the 
elytra when the organisms are at rest. Only 10% of the 350,000 described species of 
beetles are aquatic.
Beetles are holometabolous. Eggs of aquatic coleopterans hatch in 1 or 2 weeks, 
with diapause occurring rarely. Larvae undergo from three to eight molts. The pupal 
phase of all coleopterans is technically terrestrial; making this life stage of beetles 
the only one that has not successfully invaded the aquatic habitat. A few species 

205
Ocean Hypoxia
have diapausing prepupae, but most complete transformation to adults in two to 
three weeks. Terrestrial adults of aquatic beetles are typically short-lived and some­
times nonfeeding, like those of the other orders of aquatic insects. The larvae of 
Coleoptera are morphologically and behaviorally different from the adults, and their 
diversity is high.
Aquatic species occur in two major suborders, the Adephaga and the Polyphaga. 
Both larvae and adults of six beetle families are aquatic. Dytiscidae (predaceous 
diving beetles), Elmidae (riffle beetles), Gyrinidae (whirligig beetles), Haliplidae 
(crawling water beetles), Hydrophilidae (water scavenger beetles) and Noteridae 
(burrowing water beetles). Five families, Chrysomelidae (leaf beetles), Limnichidae 
(marsh-loving beetles), Psephenidae (water pennies), Ptilodactylidae (toe-winged 
beetles) and scirtidae (marsh beetles) have aquatic larvae and terrestrial adults, as do 
most of the other orders of aquatic insects; adult limnichids, however, readily sub­
merge when disturbed. Three families have species that are terrestrial as larvae and 
aquatic as adults, Curculionidae (weevils), Dryopidae (long-toed water beetles) and 
Hydraenidae (moss beetles), a highly unusual combination among insects. Because 
they provide a greater understanding of a freshwater body’s condition (i.e., they are 
useful indicators of water quality), we focus our discussion on the riffle beetle, water 
penny and whirligig beetle.
Riffle beetle larvae (most commonly found in running waters, hence the name 
Riffle Beetle) are up to ¾” long (see Figure 17.7). Their body is not only long but 
also hard, stiff and segmented. They have six long segmented legs on the upper 
middle section of body; back end has two tiny hooks and short hairs. Larvae may 
take three years to mature before they leave the water to form a pupa; adults return to 
the stream. Riffle beetle adults are considered better indicators of water quality than 
larvae because they have been subjected to water quality conditions over a longer 
period. They walk very slowly under the water (on stream bottom), and do not swim 
on the surface. They have small oval-shaped bodies (see Figure 17.8) and are typi­
cally about ¼” in length. Both adults and larvae of most species feed on fine detritus 
with associated microorganisms that are scraped from the substrate, although others 
may be xylophagous, that is, wood-eating (e.g., Lara, Elmidae). Predators do not 
seem to include riffle beetles in their diet, except perhaps for eggs, which are some­
times attacked by flatworms.
The adult water penny is inconspicuous and often found clinging tightly in a 
sucker-like fashion to the undersides of submerged rocks, where they feed on attached 
algae. The body is broad, slightly oval and flat in shape, ranging from 4 to 6 mm (1/4 in.) 
in length. The body is covered with segmented plates and looks like a tiny round 
leaf (see Figure 17.9). It has six tiny, jointed legs (underneath). The color ranges from 
light brown to almost black. There are 14 water penny species in the U.S. They live 
FIGURE 17.7  Riffle beetle larvae.

206
The Science of Ocean Pollution
predominately in clean, fast-moving streams. Aquatic larvae live one year or more 
(they are aquatic); adults (they are terrestrial) live on land for only a few days. They 
scrape algae and plants from surfaces.
Whirligig beetles are common inhabitants of streams and normally are found on 
the surface of quiet pools. The body has pincher-like mouthparts. Six segmented legs 
on the middle of the body; the legs end in tiny claws. Many filaments extend from 
the sides of the abdomen. They have four hooks at the end of the body and no tail 
(see Figure 7.10).
Note: When disturbed, whirligig beetles swim erratically or dive while emitting 
defensive secretions.
As larvae, they are benthic predators, whereas the adults live on the water surface, 
attacking dead and living organisms trapped in the surface film. They occur on the 
surface in aggregations of up to thousands of individuals. Unlike the mating swarms 
of mayflies, these aggregations serve primarily to confuse predators. Whirligig bee­
tles have other interesting defensive adaptations. For example, the Johnston’s organ 
at the base of the antennae enables them to echolocate using surface wave signals; 
their compound eyes are divided into two pairs, one above and one below the water 
surface, enabling them to detect both aerial and aquatic predators; and they produce 
noxious chemicals that are highly effective at deterring predatory fish.

Water Strider (“Jesus Bugs”) (Order: Hemiptera)
Description: The most distinguishing characteristic of the order is the mouth­
parts that are modified into an elongated, sucking beak. Most adults have 
hemelytra, which are modified leathery forewings. Some adults and all lar­
vae lack wings; both most mature larvae possess wing pads. Both adults 
and larvae have three pairs of segmented legs with two tarsal claws at the 
end of each leg. Many families are able to also utilize atmospheric oxygen. 
This order is generally not sued for the biological assessment of flowing 
waters, due to their ability to use atmospheric oxygen.
It is fascinating to sit on a log at the edge of a stream pool and watch the drama 
that unfolds among the small water animals. Among the star performers in small 
streams are the Water Bugs. These are aquatic members of that large group of 
insects called the “true bugs,” most of which live on land. Moreover, unlike many 
other types of water insects, they do not have gills but get their oxygen directly 
from the air. Most conspicuous and commonly known are the Water Striders or 
Water Skaters. These ride the top of the water, with only their feet making dim­
ples in the surface film. Like all insects, the water striders have a three-part body 
(head, thorax and abdomen), six jointed legs and two antennae. It has a long, 
dark, narrow body (see Figure 17.11). The underside of the body is covered with 
water-repellent hair. Some water striders have wings, others do not. Most water 
striders are over 5 mm (0.2 in.) long. Water striders eat small insects that fall on 
the water’s surface and larvae. Water striders are very sensitive to motion and 
vibrations on the water’s surface. It uses this ability in order to locate prey. It 
pushes its mouth into its prey, paralyzes it and sucks the insect dry. Predators of 
the water strider, like birds, fish, water beetles, backswimmers, dragonflies and 
spiders, take advantage of the fact that water striders cannot detect motion above 
or below the surface of the water.
Alderflies and Dobsonflies (Order: Megaloptera)
Description: Head and thorax have thick hardened skin, while the abdomen 
has thin, soft skin; prominent chewing mouthparts project in front of the 
head; no wing pads on the thorax; three pairs of segmented legs attaché to 
FIGURE 17.10  Whirligig beetle larva.

208
The Science of Ocean Pollution
the thorax; seven or eight pairs of stout tapering filaments extend from the 
abdomen; end of the abdomen has either a pair of prologs with two claws on 
each proleg, or a single long tapering filaments with no prolegs.
Larvae of all species of Megaloptera (“large wing”) are aquatic and attain the 
largest size of all aquatic insects. Megaloptera is a medium-sized order with less than 
5000 species worldwide. Most species are terrestrial; in North America, 64 aquatic 
species occur. In running waters, alderflies (Family: Sialidae) and dobsonflies 
(Family: Corydalidae; sometimes called hellgrammites or toe biters) are particularly 
important, as they are voracious predators, having large mandibles with sharp teeth.
Alderfly brownish-colored larvae possess a single tail filament with distinct hairs. 
The body is thick-skinned with six to eight filaments on each side of the abdomen; 
gills are located near the base of each filament. Mature body size: 0.5–1.25 inches 
(see Figure 17.12). Larvae are aggressive predators, feeding on other adult aquatic 
macroinvertebrates (they swallow their prey without chewing); as secondary con­
sumers, other larger predators eat them. Female alderflies deposit eggs on vegetation 
that overhangs water, larvae hatch and fall directly into water (i.e., into quiet but 
moving water). Adult alderflies are dark with long wings folded back over the body; 
they only live a few days.
FIGURE 17.12  Alderfly larva.
FIGURE 17.11  Water strider.

209
Ocean Hypoxia
Dobsonfly larvae are extremely ugly (thus, they are rather easy to identify) and 
can be rather large, anywhere from 25 to 90 mm (1–3.5”) in length. The body is 
stout, with eight pairs of appendages on the abdomen. Brush-like gills at base of 
each appendage look like “hairy armpits” (see Figure 17.13). The elongated body 
has spiracles (spines) and has three pairs of walking legs near the upper body and 
one pair of hooked legs at the rear. The head bears four segmented antennae, small 
compound eyes and strong mouth parts (large chewing pinchers). Coloration var­
ies from yellowish, brown, gray and black, often mottled. Dobsonfly larvae, com­
monly known as hellgrammites, are customarily found along stream banks under 
and between stones. As indicated by the mouthparts, they are predators and feed on 
all kinds of aquatic organisms.
Dragonflies and Damselflies (Order: Odonata)
Description: Dragonflies: Lower lip (labium) is long and elbowed to fold back 
against the head when not feeding, thus concealing other mouthparts; wing 
pads are present on the thorax; three pairs of segmented legs attach to the 
thorax; no gills on the sides of the abdomen; Dragonflies have three pointed 
structures may occur at the end of the abdomen forming a pyramid-shaped 
opening; bodies are long and stout or somewhat oval. Damselflies have 
three flat gills at the end of the abdomen forming a tail-like structure and 
their bodies are long and slender.
The Odonata (dragonflies, suborder Anisoptera; and damselflies, suborder 
Zygoptera) is a small order of conspicuous, hemimetabolous insects (lack a pupal 
stage) of about 5000 named species and 23 families worldwide. Odonata is a Greek 
word meaning toothed one. It refers to the serrated teeth located on the insect’s 
chewing mouthparts (mandibles). Characteristics of dragonfly and damselfly larvae 
include:
•	 Large eyes;
•	 Three pairs of long segmented legs on upper middle section (thorax) of 
body;
•	 Large scoop-like lower lip that covers bottom of mouth;
•	 No gills on sides or underneath of abdomen.
FIGURE 17.13  Dobsonfly larva.

210
The Science of Ocean Pollution
Note: Dragonflies and damselflies are unable to fold their four elongated wings 
back over the abdomen when at rest.
Dragonflies and damselflies are medium to large insects with two pairs of long 
equal-sized wings. The body is long and slender, with short antennae. Immature 
stages are aquatic and development occurs in three stages (egg, nymph, adult).
Dragonflies are also known as darning needles. Myths about dragonflies warned 
children to keep quiet or less the dragonfly’s ‘darning needles’ would sew the child’s 
mouth shut. The nymphal stage of dragonflies is grotesque creatures, robust and 
stoutly elongated. They do not have long ‘tails’ (see Figure 17.14). They are com­
monly gray, greenish or brown to black in color. They are medium to large aquatic 
insects, ranging in size from 15 to 45 mm the legs are short and used for perching. 
They are often found on submerged vegetation and at the bottom of streams in the 
shallows. They are rarely found in polluted waters. Food consists of other aquatic 
insects, annelids, small crustacea and mollusks. Transformation occurs when the 
nymph crawls out of the water, usually onto vegetation. There it splits its skin and 
emerges prepared for flight. The adult dragonfly is a strong flier, capable of great 
speed (>60 mph) and maneuverability (fly backward, stop on a dime, zip 20 feet 
straight up and slip sideways in the blink of an eye!). When at rest the wings remain 
open and out to the sides of the body. A dragonfly’s freely movable head has large, 
hemispherical eyes (nearly 30,000 facets each), which the insects use to locate prey 
with their excellent vision. Dragonflies eat small insects, mainly mosquitoes (large 
numbers of mosquitoes), while in flight. Depending on the species, dragonflies lay 
hundreds of eggs by dropping them into the water and leaving them to hatch or by 
inserting eggs singly into a slit in the stem of a submerged plant. The incomplete 
metamorphosis (egg, nymph, mature nymph and adult) can take 2–3 years. Nymphs 
are often covered by algal growth.
Note: Adult dragonflies are sometimes called “mosquito hawks” because they eat 
such a large number of mosquitoes that they catch while they are flying.
Damselflies are smaller and more slender than dragonflies. They have three 
long, oar-shaped feathery tails, which are actually gills, and long slender legs 
FIGURE 17.14  Dragonfly nymph.

211
Ocean Hypoxia
(see Figure 17.15). They are gray, greenish or brown to black in color. Their habits 
are similar to those of dragonfly nymphs and emerge from the water as adults in 
the same manner. The adult damselflies are slow and seem uncertain in flight. 
Wings are commonly black or clear, and body is often brilliantly colored. When at 
rest, they perch on vegetation with their wings closed upright. Damselflies mature 
in one to four years. Adults live for a few weeks or months. Unlike the dragonflies, 
adult damselflies rest with their wings held vertically over their backs. They mostly 
feed on live insect larvae.
Note: Relatives of the dragonflies and damselflies are some of the most ancient of 
the flying insects. Fossils have been found of giant dragonflies with wingspans up to 
720 mm (28.4”) that lived long before the dinosaurs!
NON-INSECT MACROINVERTEBRATES
Non-insect macroinvertebrates are important to our discussion of stream and fresh­
water ecology because many of them are used as bioindicators of stream quality. 
Three frequently encountered groups in running water systems are Oligochaeta 
(worms), Hirudinea (leeches) and Gastropoda (lung-breathing snails). They are by no 
means restricted to running water conditions and the great majority of them occupy 
slow-flowing marginal habitats where the sedimentation of fine organic materials 
takes place.
Oligochaeta (Family Tubificidae, Genus: Tubifex)
Tubifex worms (commonly known as sludge worms) are unique in the fact that they 
build tubes. Sometimes there are as many as 8000 individuals per square meter. 
They attach themselves within the tube and wave their posterior end in the water 
to circulate the water and make more oxygen available to their body surface. These 
worms are commonly red, since their blood contains hemoglobin. Tubifex worms 
may be very abundant in situations when other macroinvertebrates are absent; they 
can survive in very low oxygen levels and can live with no oxygen at all for short 
periods. They are commonly found in polluted streams and feed on sewage or 
detritus.
FIGURE 17.15  Damselfly nymph.

212
The Science of Ocean Pollution
Hirudinea (Leeches)
Despite the many different families of leeches, they all have common characteristics. 
They are soft-bodied worm-like creatures that are flattened when extended. Their 
bodies are dull in color, ranging from black to brown and reddish to yellow, often 
with a brilliant pattern of stripes or diamonds on the upper body. Their size varies 
within species but generally ranges from 5 mm to 45 cm when extended. Leeches 
are very good swimmers, but they typically move in an inchworm fashion. They are 
carnivorous and feed on other organisms ranging from snails to warm-blooded ani­
mals. Leeches are found in warm protected shallows under rocks and other debris.
Gastropoda (Lung-Breathing Snail)
Lung-breathing snails (pulmonates) may be found in streams that are clean. However, 
their dominance may indicate that dissolved oxygen levels are low. These snails are 
different from right-handed snails because they do not breathe under water by use of 
gills but instead have a lung-like sac called a pulmonary cavity, which they fill with 
air at the surface of the water. When the snail takes in air from the surface, it makes 
a clicking sound. The air taken in can enable the snail to breathe under water for long 
periods, sometimes hours.
Lung-breathing snails have two characteristics that help us to identify them. First, 
it has no operculum or hard cover over the opening to its body cavity. Second, snails 
are either “right-handed” or “left-handed,” and the lung-breathing snails are “left-
handed.” We can tell the difference by holding the shell so that its tip is upward and 
the opening toward us. If the opening is to the left of the axis of the shell, the snail is 
termed sinistral—that is it is left-handed. If the opening is to the right of the axis of 
the shell, the snail is termed dextral—that is it is right-handed, and it breathes with 
gills. Snails are animals of the substrate and are often found creeping along on all 
types of submerged surfaces in water from 10 cm to 2 m deep.
Before the Industrial Revolution of the 1800s, metropolitan areas were small and 
sparsely populated. Thus, river and stream systems within or next to early com­
munities received insignificant quantities of discarded waste. Early on, these river 
and stream systems were able to compensate for the small amount of waste they 
received; when wounded (polluted), nature has a way of fighting back. In the case 
of rivers and streams, nature provides their flowing waters with the ability to restore 
themselves through their own self-purification process. It was only when humans 
gathered in great numbers to form great cities that the stream systems were not 
always able to recover from having received great quantities of refuse and other 
wastes. What exactly is it that man does to rivers and streams? What man does to 
rivers and streams is to upset the delicate balance between pollution and the purifica­
tion process. That is, we tend to unbalance the aquarium.
In the sampling I conducted in various sectors of Upper and Lower-Chesapeake 
Bay including in a few dead zones I used three sampling and testing protocols. The 
first samples I took were in shallow water with an optical dissolved oxygen meter 
with a 16 ft optical DO probe—no deeper than 16 feet to accommodate the length 
of DO probe.

213
Ocean Hypoxia
In deeper water I took samples at various depths and tested the samples in an envi­
ronmental laboratory using two standard methods: titration and a colorimetric method.
If I decided to use titration I always made sure I had a 5 mL sample of the water 
and I used Standard Methods procedure for testing and evaluating DO content taken 
at various water depths. In the colorimetric test procedure, I also took a 5 mL sample 
of the water and, again, I used a Standards Method to test and evaluate DO content. 
After calibrating the meter, I placed the probe into the sample, let the meter stabilize 
and then I wrote down the reading.
SALTWATER MACROINVERTEBRATES (INDICATORS)
After months of sampling, testing and recording the findings I created quite a large 
collection of documented (digital) readings. In subsequent years I found the recordings 
golden because they gave me a basis for comparing results against historic results.
When using the Biotic Index in Chesapeake Bay the only change I needed to 
make for accurate measurement was to modify the Freshwater Biotic Index to cor­
respond to saltwater estuaries (Chesapeake Bay; see Figure 17.16) so I changed from 
freshwater species to saltwater species. The standard simplified scale adapted for use 
in Chesapeake Bay is shown in Figure 17.16. Recall that a Biotic Index is a scale for 
showing the quality of an environment by indicating the types and abundances of 
organisms present in a representative sample of the environment. Keep in mind that 
the Biotic Index is often used to access the quality of water in marine and freshwater 
ecosystems. I have used it both in freshwater and in marine sampling. Also, keep in 
mind that numerous conditions or circumstances have occurred and also created to 
account for the indicator species found in each region of study.
What about salt water macroinvertebrates? Well, in my sampling I understood 
that when I could not find them, I knew something was not right—let’s leave it at 
that—for now.
FIGURE 17.16  Dissolved oxygen levels required by various species in Chesapeake Bay.

214
The Science of Ocean Pollution
Okay, enough said, let’s take a look at the predominant salt water 
macroinvertebrates.
•	 Harlequin Shrimp (Hymenocera picta)—these unique marine creatures 
are a species of saltwater shrimp that literally devour starfish; one bite at a 
time. They reside in coral reefs in the tropical Indian and Pacific Oceans. 
These starfish killers even devour crown-of-thorns starfish, which pos­
sesses significant defensive mechanisms—for humans beware of stepping 
on one of these creatures because if you make that mistake the result will 
imbue with memories that you would rather forget.
•	 The White-Patched Anemone Shrimp (Periclimenes Brevicarpalis)(aka 
Glass Anemone/American Shrimp)—this creature features a translucent 
body with an array of spots covering its body. These creatures often form a 
symbiotic relationship with a single anemone.
•	 Porcelain Crab (Neopetrolisthes Sp)—these creatures are spectacular in 
appearance with white bodies with several markings and black spots.
•	 Pom-Pom Crab/Boxer Crab (Lybia edmondsoni)—called the Pom-Pom 
crab because it carries a sea anemone in each claw to ward off predators. 
Box Crab is another common name for this creature because its claws look 
like boxing gloves. In Hawaii they call this creature the inedible flower crab.
•	 Coral Banded Shrimp/Banded Cleaner Shrimp (Stenopus hispidus)—
this red and white banded creature can be found in reefs from coral ledges 
to rocky ledges and crevices. It has the ability to lose a claw for safety 
reasons.
•	 Regular Starfish (Pentaceraster alveolatus)—these starfish are as big as 
an adult human’s hand. They are carnivores with a diet that includes mol­
lusks, detritus and worms. They are often called Cushion Stars.
•	 Carnation Tree Coral (Dendronephyta)—this soft, good-looking corals in 
tropical reefs. The depend on zooplankton to keep alive, but they only eat at night.
•	 Sand Dollar (Clypeaster Australasia)—whether they are called sand 
dollars, sea cookies, snapper biscuits or pansy shells the are a species of 
flat, burrowing sea urchins. They are small in size, usually about three to 
four inches with a rigid test (i.e., skeleton). Their diet consists of floating 
microorganisms.
•	 Sea Urchin (Echinoidea)—estimates have the number of species with 
these spiny, globular echinoderms primarily feed on algae.
•	 Cleaner Shrimp (Lysmata Amboinensis)—this swimming decapod crus­
tacean is well-named because it works to clean other organisms of parasites.
THE BOTTOM LINE
We refer to severely hypoxic waters as “dead zones,” where few macroscopic organ­
isms, whether in fresh or sea water, can exist. Hypoxia can affect the distribution of 
species because most species will leave an area well before the oxygen concentra­
tions fall to levels that might kill them. The point is that hypoxia can kill. Moreover, 
when a site in the sea is sampled for certain species and none are found, it is safe to 

215
Ocean Hypoxia
say that something profound is going on at this site. Thus, the problem might be a 
lack of dissolved oxygen caused by pollution.

INTRODUCTION
I used to think that the Island of Hong Kong was the brightest place on Earth—the 
brightest because of human-made and directed light, at night, of course. Having 
visited the Island and Kowloon on mainland China—connected by two road-only 
tunnels, three railway tunnels and one combined rail and road tunnel and what we 
(Sailors) called the “Suzy Wong” ferry three separate times while a member of the 
United States Navy I was fascinated by light everywhere—just no real night time 
clothed in darkness. These trips to Hong Kong occurred before the Island transi­
tioned to Communism. It was the lights from the Island, Kowloon, and the shop­
ping and great food and drink there that always got my interest. I recall walking 
in Kwun Tong, Wong Tai Sin and Yau Tsim Mong, all districts in Kowloon, and no 
matter where I walked it was the same: bright lights everywhere—in the localities 
of Kowloon City, Kowloon Tong, Lam Tin, Prince Edward or West Kowloon same 
thing; it was like daylight everywhere. The District lighting and the Island localities 
with its surrounding waters were never, ever, dark; that is, not while I was there, at 
least.
Light pollution in Hong Kong and Kowloon is caused by boats in Victoria Harbor, 
buildings, street lights and fireworks. This light pollution can be detrimental to the 
health of people and animals in the area.
I stated that I used to think that Hong Kong and Kowloon were the brightest loca­
tions on the planet at night. And there is no mistaking there lighting up the night. 
Well, after visiting Las Vegas several times for business and visits to the casino poker 
rooms, I soon learned that light pollution in Hong Kong and Kowloon are secondary 
when compared to the brightest spotlight on Earth, located on the Las Vegas Strip. 
I am speaking of the Luxor Sky Beam—well, according to Bogard (2013). This is a 
level 9 environment on the Bortle Scale. Bogard authored a non-fiction book titled 
The End of Night: Searching for Natural Darkness in an Age of Artificial Light. 
Bogard’s narrative is based on his personal observations concerning informing us of 
the primal, riotously dark night sky and how it has shaped the human involvement 
in science and in art. He also points out the importance of darkness—what our over-
lighted regions have hidden from our celestial view.
THE BORTLE SCALE
The Bortle scale (aka the Bottle scale) is a nine-level (1–9) numeric scale that mea­
sures the night sky’s brightness of a particular location. The scale is based on view­
ing the magnitude of the faintest star you can discern under given sky conditions; 
this procedure is referred to as NELM (naked-eye limiting magnitude). What this 
procedure really attempts to accomplish is the quantification of astronomical 
18

observability of celestial objects and the interference caused by light pollution. 
Bortle created the scale and published it in the February 2001 edition of Sky & 
Telescope magazine.
Note that Bortle’s goal in publishing his scale was to help amateur astronomers 
evaluate the darkness of an observing site. Also, his scale aids in comparing the 
darkness of one location to others. For simplicity, a modified form of Bortle’s 1–9 
scale, with Class 1 that includes the darkest skies available on Earth through Class 9, 
inner-city skies is shown in Table 18.1. Where additional information beyond naked-
eye limiting magnitude (NELM) is provided (Bortle, 2001).
Note: The celestial body used for classification of the sites is the Milky Way (see 
Figure 18.1). Keep in mind that some classes can possess very drastic differences 
from the one next to it, for example, Bortle Class 4–5.
DID YOU KNOW?
When it comes to pollution the environment most of the pollution comes from 
humans and their technological inventions. For example, plastic—that stuff 
that human ingenuity invented. At the present time, we can find plastic this or 
that or something else EVERYWHERE—or so it seems. We have literally cre­
ated a new ecological niche: the Plastisphere. So, because of our inventiveness, 
our genius, our ingenuity and our need to live the so-called good life and to 
satisfy our need for light, we have created other helpful technology such as the 
lightbulb—one of the most important human inventions of all time. While we 
all know the benefits provided by lightbulbs, keeping us safe and comfortable 
light pollution, however, has flooded certain areas with excessive and is living 
up to being called the worst light pollution in the world (Shadbolt, 2013).

Note: There is some controversy related to the accuracy, and/or efficacy, and func­
tionality of the Bortle Scale. Other comments centered on the bias toward the Milky 
Way. From personal observation in Canyon Lands along the Colorado River, Utah, 
this author has no problem with the Bortle Scale—I could see what I could not see 
in the city—all cities.
THE SCIENCE OF LIGHT
In order to gain an understanding of light pollution, it is important to comprehend 
the significance, stability and fragility of natural lightscapes. In this discussion keep 
in mind that nothing on Earth can exist without light. The surface of Earth, during 
the day, is bathed in light from the sun. Weather, the water cycle and ecosystems are 
driven by the sun’s energy they receive and utilize. But when the sun goes down and 
we are wrapped in darkness the atmosphere becomes transparent and allows us to 
beyond our planet.
Electromagnetic Spectrum
The electromagnetic spectrum (EM Spectrum), where light visible to the human eye 
is located is in range of propagating mechanisms, which encompasses radiant energy 
(see Figure 18.2).
Referring to Figure 18.2, radiant energy may be seen (visible light) and felt (infra­
red radiation or heat transferred from warm objects) or it can penetrate (X-rays) 
and can do physical damage to the cells of the human body (gamma rays or nuclear 
radiation). Note that the very low-energy radiation is used by human technology as 
a carrier for communications (microwaves and radio waves). The visible spectrum is

formed by what we call visible light, the colors of the rainbow—red, orange, yellow, 
green, blue, indigo, violet (ROYGBIV)—and makes up a very narrow band in the 
entire electromagnetic spectrum. Note that blue and violet light contain more energy 
and have a shorter wavelength than orange and red light.
The EM spectrum can be expressed in terms of energy, wavelength or frequency. 
No matter how the EM spectrum is expressed each is related to the others in a precise 
mathematical way. Wavelength and frequency are represented by the Greek letters 
lambda (λ) and nu (ν). These symbols are used to write the relationships between 
energy, wavelength and frequency as wavelength equals the speed of light divided 
by the frequency, or is the

and energy equals Planck’s constant times the frequency, or

h is Planck’s constant, h = 6.626 × 10−27 erg-seconds.
Note that both the speed of light and Planck’s constant are constant—they never 
change value.

Types of EM Radiation
In our day-to-day lives we encounter portions of the EM spectrum; consider the fol­
lowing (NASA, 2013):
•	 Radio—our radios capture radio waves emitted by radio stations. Not that 
radio waves are also emitted by stars and gases in space.
•	 Microwave—this radiation cooks our TV dinners in just a few min­
utes but is also used by scientists to learn about the structure of nearby 
galaxies.
•	 Infrared—infrared light emitted by our skin and objects here are picked 
by night vision goggles. Infrared light helps scientists map the dust between 
the stars.
•	 Visible—we detect visible light. The stars, light bulbs and fireflies are dif­
ficult to not see.
•	 Ultraviolet—this radiation is emitted from the sun and is the reason for 
that summer tan and sunburns.
•	 X-ray—airport security uses them to see through bags, and a doctor and 
dentist use them to image your body and teeth.
•	 Gamma ray—the biggest gamma-ray generator of all in the Universe. On 
Earth, doctors used gamma-ray imaging to see inside our bodies.
HUMAN VISION
Before we discuss the fundamentals of human vision we first need to follow the sage 
advice of Voltaire who said, “If you wish to converse with me, define your terms.” 
So, that is what we do here first, define the key terms related to human vision. Note, 
that although the following discussion is bent toward human visual perception and 
acuity, it is important to point out that pollution of our oceans and shorelines and 
estuaries that impact humans also impact animals, especially aquatic organisms. 
This noise effect on aquatic animals/organisms is discussed later in this chapter. 
Anyway, to be following Voltaire and several other geniuses pertinent key terms and 
definitions are presented here first.
Key Terms and Definitions
Human vision is the response of the human eye over the visible light spectrum 
defines the so-called luminosity function or photopic curve.
DID YOU KNOW?
EM radiation can be expressed in terms of energy, wavelength, frequency. 
Frequency is measured in Hertz or cycles per second. Wavelength is measured 
in meters. Energy is measured in electron volts. These three quantities used 
for describing EM radiation are related to each other in a precise mathematical 
way.

222
The Science of Ocean Pollution
Well, these last two terms probably sound like gobbledygook or mumbo jumbo, 
maybe, to some folks but they are important and in simplistic terms—in regard to 
what we need to understand about the photopic curve—is that it is the peak of the 
curve that is yellow-green, at a wavelength of 555 nanometers (nm). Under very dark 
conditions (aka scotopic or dark-adapted) because of differences in the chemistry of 
the rod and cone cells in the human retina. Scotopic (rod) vision is more blue-sen­
sitive, but it is perceived as a black-and-white image by the human brain; this is the 
case because the rods do not have the means to differentiate color. Scotopic vision 
is important in observing the night sky and the landscape at night, however, light 
measurement (aka photometry) is based upon daytime vision or the photopic curve.
Photopic (or cone) vision is the vision of the eye under well-lit conditions. In 
humans and several other animals, photopic vision (mediated by cone cells) allows 
color perception and a significantly greater visual acuity and temporal resolution 
than that is offered by scotopic vision.
Three types of cones are used by humans to sense light in three bands of color. The 
cones have biological pigments with a maximum absorption value at wavelengths of 
about 420 nm (blue), 534 nm (bluish-green) and 564 nm (yellowish-green). Note that 
their sensitivity ranges overlap to provide vision throughout the visible spectrum.
Scotopic (or rod) vision is the vision of the human eye under low-light conditions. 
In humans, the eyes cone cells are nonfunctional in low visible light. It is the human 
cornea’s rod cells that produce scotopic vision and they are most sensitive to wave­
lengths of around 408 nm (blue-green) and are insensitive to wavelengths longer than 
about 640 nm (red-orange). This condition is called the Purkinje effect.
Purkinje effect (aka Purkinje shift), more specifically, is about the tendency for 
the peak luminance sensitivity of the shift toward the blue end of the color spectrum 
at low illumination levels as part of dark adaptation (Frisby, 1980; Purkinje, 1825). 
As a result, reds will appear darker—tending toward blackness—relative to others 
as light levels decrease. Generally speaking, the effect is often described from the 
perspective of the human eye, it has been observed and well-documented that there 
are a number of animals that describe the general shifting of spectral sensitivity due 
to pooling of red and cone output signals a park of dark/light adaptation (Armington 
& Thiede, 1956; Dodt, 1967; Hammond & James, 1971; Silver, 1966).
Angstrom is a unit of wavelength often used in science, equal to 10−10 m or 
0.1 nm.
Brightness is the strength of the sensation that results from viewing surfaces from 
which the light enters the eye.
Candela (cd) is a unit of luminous intensity. One candela is one lumen per stera­
dian (i.e., square radian). Used to be called the candle.
Candlepower is the luminous intensity expressed in candelas.
Cones and rods are groups of light-sensitive cells in the retinas of human and 
animal eyes. When the luminance level is high, cones dominate the response and 
provide color perception. At the low luminance level, it is the rods that dominate but 
give not significant color perceptions.
Radiant Energy is measured in units of erg, or joules, or kWh.
Footcandle is the Illuminance produced on a surface one foot from a uniform 
point source of one candela.

223

Glare is intense, sometimes blinding light that reduces visibility. Basically, glare 
is a light within the field of vision that is brighter than the brightness to which the 
eyes are adapted.
Illuminance is the density of luminous flux incident on a surface, measured in 
footcandles or lux.
Lumen is the unit of luminance and is equal to one lumen per square meter.
Nadir is a point on the celestial sphere directly below the observer, diametrically 
opposite the zenith.
Nanometer is often used as the unit for wavelength in the EM spectrum; 10−9 m.
Zenith is an imaginary point directly above a particular location, on the imagi­
nary celestial sphere.
LIGHT POLLUTION
Earlier the Bortle scale, a nine-level (1–9) numeric scale that measures the night 
sky’s brightness of a particular location was introduced. Recall, that the scale is 
based on viewing the magnitude of the faintest star you can discern under given sky 
conditions. What this procedure really attempts to accomplish is the quantification 
of astronomical observability of celestial objects and the interference caused by light 
pollution.
Okay, the point being made right here is that night vision is affected by light pol­
lution. In gauging whether or not that you are going to get a really clear, good look 
at the heavens in a 1- to 9-night-scale depends on where your view will fall upon the 
scale.
Categories of Light Pollution
Before any of those now alive on Earth those who were alive back then could look up 
into the heavens on a clear night and take in a view of brilliant stars and the Milky 
Way—that is almost obtainable today wherever humans live. The light pollution of 
today (2023) is caused by unnecessary, inefficient and incorrectly positioned artifi­
cial light. Specific categories of light pollution include light trespass, over illumina­
tion, glare, clutter and skyglow.
Light Trespass—has a neighbor’s light ever shined over your fence, onto your 
house and into your non-shielded windows causing you to lose sleep? If so, this 
is light trespass—unwanted light. Because of this present problem, many cities 
in the United States have developed standards for outdoor lighting to protect the 
rights of their citizens against light threshold. Light trespass can be reduced by 
using light fixtures that limit the amount of light emitted more than 80° above 
the nadir.
Over Illumination—If we illuminated an unoccupied area by using electrical 
lighting instead of natural lighting and provide lighting for an occupied area but 
with too much intensity and install too few electrical controls so that an is must 
be over-illuminated or not illuminated at all we are simply over illuminating. 
Even more simply we can say over-illumination is the excessive use of light on 
steroids.

224
The Science of Ocean Pollution
Glare—glare is just glare, right? Well, sort of but not exactly because it can be 
classified in three different ways. One of the classifications of glare is described by 
Mizon (2001), as follows:
•	 Blinding glare—staring into the sun is blinding and leaves temporary or 
permanent vision deficiencies.
•	 Disability glare—causes significant reduction is sight capabilities from 
effects such as being blinded by oncoming vehicle lights, or light scattering 
in for or in the eye, reducing contrast, as well as reflections from print and 
other dark areas that render them bright.
•	 Discomfort glare—is annoying and irritating and can cause fatigue experi­
enced over extended periods.
Mario Motta (2009), president of the Massachusetts Medical Society points out 
that “… glare from bad lighting is a public health hazard—especially the older you 
become.” The problem is glare light scattering in the eye causes loss of contrast, 
which can be hazardous while driving,
The bottom line on glare causing unsafe driving conditions is that bright and/or 
badly shielded lights around roads can partially blind pedestrians and drivers and 
contribute to accidents.
Light Clutter—excessive groupings of lights is the primary cause. The prob­
lems with light clutter have to do with the generation of confusion and distraction 
and can lead to accidents. A lot of the trouble with light clutter is human-caused; 
that is, not only the clutter itself but the design of street lighting fixtures. Another 
issue is advertising. Brightly lit advertisements alongside the highway or roadways 
can be a real problem, especially for drivers unfamiliar with the roadways. By 
the way, is it not the intention of advertisement to gain attention? Moreover, is it 
not the intention of advertisement to make people aware? Well, we all know what 
advertisement is intended for and to do but too much glaring light clutter with or 
without messaging is dangerous when the observer happens to be driving down a 
light-cluttered roadway.
DID YOU KNOW?
Stray light that fogs images (i.e., reduces contrast in shadow areas) is called 
veiling glare. It is caused by reflections between surfaces of lens components 
and the inside barrel of the lens. Veiling glare is a strong predictor of lens 
flare—image fogging (loss of shadow detail and color) as weak as “ghost” 
images—that can degrade image quality in the presence of bright light sources 
in or near the field of view. Note that it occurs in every optical system, includ­
ing the human eye (Imatest, 2023).

225

Skyglow—excluding the moon and stars this is the diffuse luminance of the night sky.
OCEAN LIGHT POLLUTION
To this point fundamental, foundational, very basic, human (and some animal) vision 
science has been presented to provide introductory elements necessary to understand 
ocean pollution and its profound effects on the environment, humans and wildlife. 
To properly begin this discussion the science of biological rhythms and the day-night 
cycle.
Biological Rhythms (Aka Chronobiology)
During our growing up and aging processes we may have wondered why it is that we 
have day and night and is night really necessary? All that darkness, why?
Well, it can be safely stated that most lifeforms on Earth need the day-night cycle. 
It is the rotation of the Earth that has imposed this day-night rhythm (i.e., the regular 
sequence of light and darkness) on all of us and the rest of the creatures on Earth. 
This rhythm or cycle has led to biological clocks that regulate what we call the circa­
dian rhythm (sometimes called meal timing, diurnal rhythm). In this cycle, our bod­
ies have hormones that are responsible for the sleep cycle and generally speaking, 
for our metabolism. Metabolism comes into play by temporarily separating oppos­
ing metabolic processes and by anticipating recurring feeding (and fasting) cycles 
which, in turn, increases metabolic efficiency.
DID YOU KNOW?
One of the standard food-for-thought type questions I always asked my college 
students in my environmental science, engineering and health college classes 
was as follows:
“When you light a candle, why is it that the flame is yellow?”
After a few minutes various students start to raise their hands and I let 
them, one at a time, provide their thoughts on the subject.
At first I was surprised that so many replied, in one fashion or another, that 
candle flame is yellow because that the human eye does not respond equally 
to all wavelengths in the visible range; instead, the candle flame would appear 
red. However, because of the mechanics of the eyes, it makes the eye sensitiv­
ity peak in green and diminish toward the red wavelengths, making the eye 
perceive flame color as yellow.
Was there more surprise when so many students provided the correct 
answer and in a relatively quick manner?
Not at all. This is the age of the digital device and all of my students had 
laptops or other electronic devices and they simply looked up the answer.
Is it not the number one goal of a college education to open students’ minds 
(make them seek solutions) so that they know where and how to find answers?

226
The Science of Ocean Pollution
Circadian rhythms or biological rhythms are part of the field of biology, chro­
nobiology, that examines timing processes, including cyclic phenomena in living 
organisms, such as their adaptation to solar- and lunar-related rhythms (DeCoursey, 
2003). Included in the science of chronobiology is comparative biology, physiology, 
genetics, molecular biology and behavior of organism related to their biological 
rhythms (DeCoursey, 2003). There are other aspects of chronobiology that include 
epigenetics (e.g., can be used to describe any heritable phenotypic change), develop­
ment, reproduction, evolution and ecology.
A major purpose or function of chronobiology is the study of variations of 
the timing and duration of biological activity in living organisms—this is 
important because of variance in many essential biological processes. 
Specifically, variations of the timing and duration of biological activity in liv­
ing organisms include animals—eating, sleeping, mating, migration, hibernat­
ing and cellular regeneration; in plants—photosynthetic reactions and leaf 
movements; in microbial organisms such as protozoa and fungi. They have also 
been found in bacteria, especially among the blue-green algae (ama 
cyanobacteria).
Biological Clocks
Circadian rhythm is a 24-hour cycle biological clock and is the best-studied rhythm. 
Studies have shown that rhythm in chronobiology is the circadian rhythm—the bio­
logical clock. It is a combination of three global genes that make this molecular 
clockwork tick, so to speak. This circadian rhythm can be broken into routine cycles 
during the 24-hour day (Nelson, 2005):
•	 Diurnal—describes organisms active during the daytime;
•	 Nocturnal—which describes an organism active in the night; and
•	 Crepuscular—describes animals primarily active during the dawn and 
dusk hours.
DID YOU KNOW?
With regard to ocean algae, it is interesting to note that one of the largest forms 
of saltwater algae is that few understand that the subject here, seaweed, is not 
a plant or some other exotic organism but is indeed seaweed is an algae. The 
three types of marine algae are:
•	 Brown algae,
•	 Green algae and
•	 Red algae.
Note: For some types of marine algae, seaweed can grow up to 150 feet in 
length.

MARINE RHYTHMS
After a brief introduction to circadian rhythms, which, in general, mostly focused on 
humans and their circadian rhythms, it is time to focus our attention to marine crea­
tures, their circadian rhythms and the effect of light pollution on these cycles. Note 
that circadian rhythm in ocean life could be driven by the circalunidian, circatidal 
clock or circatidal rhythm. For the purpose of our discussion on marine rhythms 
the subsequent discussion of marine rhythms will focus on the circatidal clock or 
circatidal rhythm.
Circatidal Rhythm
The circatidal rhythm is an aquatic organisms inside factor (endogenous) correspond­
ing to the tidal cycles. This having been said, keep in mind that marine organisms 
adapt to complex temporal environments that also include daily, tidal, semi-lunar, 
lunar and seasonal cycles.
With regard to ocean pollution, it is light pollution that affects the lives of many 
marine organisms.
Bright lights at night in cities are supposed to reduce crime, increase personal 
safety and highlight the benefits, if any, of the location. The problem is that the 
bright lights and glow of artificial lights impact animals. Experience and research 
have demonstrated that the glow of artificial lights also impact organisms in the seas 
and especially along human occupied sea shores with lighting from harbors, ships 
and offshore structures such as oil rigs is disrupting the lives of marine barnacles, 
works and corals. As Wheeling (2015) put it “light that leaks into the high seas may 
be keeping marine life from settling down.”
When artificial light affects organisms and ecosystems this ecology light pol­
lution affects species frequencies and food webs. This effect is demonstrated on 
land by certain species of spiders avoiding lit areas and other spider species being 
attracted to artificial lighting. Consider, for example, spider species that is attracted 
to artificial light and because of it will construct a spider web on a street light.
Why not? This spider species intuitively understands (in a neural way) that flies 
are attracted to light. And because the light attracts a steady food sources of flies for 
the spider, the spider is not only pleased but well-fed. The point is artificial lighting 
affects various species on land and in the seas.
It is the nocturnal organisms that are affected by artificial lighting. They function 
according to the dark and light cycles whereby negative impacts result for plants 
and animals. Simply, light pollution can confuse animal competitive interactions 
(everything is life is interactions based on who eats whom and so forth)—the point 
is artificial lighting can cause physiological harm and predator-prey relations (Perry 
et al., 2008). The natural diurnal patterns of light and dark, so disruption to these 
patterns impacts the ecological dynamics (Longcore & Rich, 2004).
When we talk about marine organisms and light pollution effect on them we 
can’t overlook sea birds. Birds migrate at night. Why? Because they can save water 
from dehydration in hot day flying and part of the bird’s navigation systems is based 
on stars—in ways we do not fully understand. The point is when over-lighting of 

228
The Science of Ocean Pollution
coastlines and other marine locations it is difficult for the birds to navigate when 
they can’t see the stars due to the bright lights. Outshining the sky because of over-
lighting prohibits birds and other animals from navigating by stars.
We do not want to forget sea turtles, especially hatchlings who emerge from their 
nests on beaches; they are also victims of light pollution. Contrary to popular belief, 
hatchling sea turtles do not depend on the moon to navigate but rather they find the 
ocean by moving away from the dark silhouette of vegetation and dunes, a behavior 
with which artificial lighting interferes (Salmon, 2003). Excessive lighting also may 
disorientate juvenile seabirds as they leave their nests and fly out to sea (Rodriquez 
et al., 2014; Rodriquez & Rodriquez, 2003; Rodriquez et al., 2012). Rodriquez et al. 
(2014) studied the factors of body condition, plumage development, fledgling date 
and sex influencing the mortality of Cory’s Shearwater Calonectris diomedea fledg­
lings stranded inland due to light pollution in Tenerife, Canary Islands during two 
consecutive breeding seasons (2009 and 2010). Late fledglings showed lower val­
ues of a body condition index than early ones. Miriam Cuesta-Garcia et al. (2022) 
point out that oceanic conditions determine food availability to seabirds and affect 
seabird reproductive parameters, such as breeding success, chick growth and sur­
vival rates. Again, in seabirds, juvenile survival at sea is positively correlated with 
body condition at fledgling. Moreover, especially in petrels and shearwaters (Order 
Procellariiformes), fledglings are disoriented by artificial light during their maiden 
flights from their nests to the sea, and many of them fall to the ground and are res­
cued by volunteers to mitigate light-induced mortality.
IT’S AN ANNUAL LIGHTING RIGHT
The truth be told we continue to alter natural light levels every year leading to the 
loss of natural nightscapes worldwide—an annual lighting right of civilization on the 
advance, on the growth, that’s what it is. Well, advancements and growth considered, 
light pollution has generated a range of ecological impacts, and mass facility events due 
to light-induced causal factors are one of the most severe (but often ignored) ecological 
consequences of light pollution. One only needs to look at the life cycle and habits of 
nocturnal seabirds, which are attracted, disoriented and ground by artificial lights in 
their habitat—a travesty that takes little notice; that is, unless you are a seabird.
Try to put yourself if the place of a seabird—for a moment, at least. The wide­
spread and overuse of artificial light at night has exposed you, as a seabird, to an 
ever-increasing threat. For burrow-nesting seabirds, it is all about being disorien­
tated by and attracted to artificial lighting. It’s the human-made structures—build­
ings, electric wires and pylons, fences or posts—that cause the problem because the 
seabirds can crash into them or hit the ground because the lighting fools them. Even 
if colliding with the structures or ground it may not be fatal to the seabird but it cer­
tainly can disable their ability to fly again, which means they are prime targets for 
predation, starvation, poaching or just plain abuse.
According to personal research and observation I have come to believe that petrels 
and shearwaters are the most affected by light pollution. But later I also added auk­
lets, puffins and eiders to my list of those affected. Of the more than 100 petrels I 
observed I came up with a ballpark figure of about 60% grounding tendency.

In 1966 while sailing a Hobby Cat along the North Caroline Coast I saw this huge-
white-winged bird flying right towards me from Jockey’s Ridge in the Outer Banks 
and I immediately thought I was going to be visited by an Albatross, Coleridge’s bird 
of record, so to speak. But the truth be told, it was Cory’s Shearwater (see Figure 18.3) 
that landed on my topmast and rode along the coast with me and when I looked at him 
or her she seemed to say, “thanks for the ride” and then it flew away.

In amphibians and reptiles, a change in light signals the start of activities such as 
foraging, sheltering, mating and reproducing and communicating. Artificial lights 
alter their circadian rhythm and create missteps. Introduced light sources during 
normally dark periods can disrupt levels of melatonin production.
Why is this significant?
This is significant because melatonin is a hormone that regulates photoperiodic 
physiology and behavior. Moreover, the light-dependent properties of magnetic 
compass orientation by amphibians are mediated by a magnetoreception mechanism 
(Phillips, Jorge, & Muheim, 2010).
THE BOTTOM LINE
As more people move to cities light pollution will also grow, and the number of 
marine ecosystems negatively affected will grow in turn. While artificial light pol­
lution of our oceans (and other water bodies) is only one factor affecting and damag­
ing our oceans, light pollution is one of those types of pollution that is often ignored 
until the impact can be observed and felt. Simply, darkness must be protected.

The Science of Ocean Pollution
The inappropriate or excessive use of artificial light, that is, light pollution, can have 
serious environmental consequences not only for our climate, wildlife but also for 
humans. The trouble is not many humans recognize over-lighting as a pollution 
problem.

Ocean Pollution 
and Health
INTRODUCTION
Let’s begin this chapter with some certain, undeniable, irrefutable and proven facts—
facts that have been highlighted and discussed to this point in the book:
•	 Ocean pollution is not from a single source.
•	 Instead, ocean pollution is from multiple sources.
•	 Ocean pollution is widespread.
•	 Ocean pollution is worsening.
•	 Sources of ocean pollution in many countries are poorly controlled.
•	 Ocean pollution is constantly fed from rivers, surface runoff, atmospheric 
deposition and direct discharges.
•	 Ocean pollution has several negative impacts on ecosystems.
•	 More than 80% of ocean pollution arises from human-based sources—the 
old “I do not want this item anymore, dump it in the river, stream, or ocean,” 
with all of it ending up in the ocean(s), eventually.
In this chapter we add one more fact; this is one that many will argue is the most 
important, the most significant and most vital to our understanding of what is going 
on with the pollution of our oceans. This critical fact is:
•	 Ocean pollution has negative impacts on human health, especially in vul­
nerable populations.
Negative impacts on human health?
Yes, for certain. And the negative impacts on human health, especially in vulner­
able populations, are absolutely absolute.
OCEAN POLLUTION: THREAT TO HUMAN HEALTH
Based on 50 years of experience; based on 50 years of research; based on 25 years 
of authoring several books about the science of water and water treatment, I state 
unequivocally that ocean pollution poses a clear and present danger to human health, 
ecosystem health and the well-being of all presently inhabiting Earth.
The problem: Pollution of oceans is widespread, extensive, common, pervasive, 
worsening (by the minute) and in most locations poorly controlled. What it boils 
down to is a complex mixture of plastics, toxic metals (e.g., mercury), manufactured 
19

234
The Science of Ocean Pollution
chemicals, petroleum (oil spills), urban and industrial wastes, fertilizers, pesticides, 
pharmaceutical chemicals (PPCPs), agricultural runoff and wastewater (sewage). 
Although a lot of ocean pollution comes from boats and ships that dump trash into 
the marine environment it only accounts for about 20% of the total. The other 80% 
arises from land-based sources.
How are ocean pollutants conveyed to the Oceans from land-based sources?
Rivers are the main conveyors of pollutants into oceans but is also accom­
panied by river runoff, is atmospheric deposition and direct discharges. Ocean 
pollution is often heaviest near the coasts and research has shown that it is 
the coasts of low- and middle-income countries where the pollution is most 
concentrated.
Most Ocean Pollution Begins on Land
As mentioned, 80% of marine pollution arises from land-based sources. And one of 
the biggest land-based sources is from non-point sources, which occurs as a result of 
runoff. Not all of the non-point sources are from large sources—small sources like 
septic tanks, cars, trucks and boats contribute to the runoff. The larger sources of 
land runoff into streams or directly into marine waters are from forests, ranches and 
farms. Dirt from these land sources can also make their way into water bodies that 
empty into the sea or the dirt enters directly into marine waters from beach locations. 
Some of the polluted runoff is caused by atmospheric deposition of air pollution 
which settles in the waterways that feed the oceans and also settles directly into the 
oceans.
The bottom line: Much of this land-based runoff empties into coastal shell­
fish regions making the shellfish unsafe to consume by both humans and 
wildlife.
OCEAN POLLUTION COLUMN
I ranked ocean pollutants consisting of 6 major pollutants which are shown 
in Figure 19.1. Take note that in the author’s judgment, the top of the column 
is reflective of the fact that the top ocean polluter is plastics (creating a new 
ecosystem that we call the plastisphere), with oil spills second, mercury (heavy 
metals) third, chemicals fourth, pesticides fifth and nutrients sixth in descend­
ing order; this view is based on each of the pollutants impact on the oceans—
on the degraded environment and on the negative health effects on humans and 
wildlife.
In Figure 19.1, depicts what the author calls the “Ocean Pollution Column,” note 
that you do not want to confuse the Ocean Pollution Column with the Ocean’s Water 
Column; there is a distinct difference between the two.
So, let’s compare and contrast the two to see what the difference is between the 
two.
First, it is important to describe the Ocean Water Column before making any kind 
of judgment between the two. Consider the following DYK?

235
Ocean Pollution and Health
Okay, based on the author’s view, let’s now take a closer look at the major con­
taminants that make up the Ocean Water Column. It is important to keep in mind 
that we are talking about a mixture of substances in the aquatic environment.
Plastic Waste
More than 10 tons of plastic waste is dumped, by one means or another, into the 
oceans each year. Recall that in Chapter 3 it was pointed out that in the author’s view 
plastic pollution is all about the 4 P’s:

DID YOU KNOW?
NOAA (2023) points out that although the ocean water column makes up 95– 
99% of the total livable volume of the planet (which includes all the water in 
the ocean between the surface and the seafloor), it remains one of the most 
poorly explored environments on Earth. The ocean water column, even in 
midwater, provides the volume needed for ocean animals/creatures to move 
freely in all three dimensions, making it difficult to find; but it is important to 
recognize that the water column actually holds a much greater biomass than 
the seafloor. From gelatinous animals such as jellyfish and comb jellies, sipho­
nophores (i.e., jellyfish, anemones and corals) and tunicates (swallow water 
organisms that possess dorsal nerve) to fish and mammals.
FIGURE 19.1  Ocean pollution column.

236
The Science of Ocean Pollution
With regard to health effects of plastic pollution of the oceans it is important 
to point out that aquatic animals have been eating plastic, usually micro- or nano-
plastic-sized particles ever since plastics have entered the oceans. In a study by Kuhn 
et al., in 2015 they found that over 700 species, including seabirds, fish, turtles and 
marine mammals, have been confirmed to eat plastic. Moreover, it seems likely that 
the number will increase over time as wildlife continues to encounter plastics.
So, why is it that many ocean animals ingest plastics? Sea life mistake plastic 
items for food or they ingest their regular food that has plastic fragments attached to 
it. Many plastics float and break into small, colorful bits that are quite attractive to 
hungry ocean animals and they are also easily eaten. The problem is that eating plas­
tic may lead to loss of nutrition, internal injury, intestinal blockage, starvation and 
probably death. One of the problems at the present time is that we do not know what 
we do not know about ocean animals ingesting plastics; however, research is ongoing 
to determine the effects of plastics ingestion, including effects to communities and 
wild populations (Kuhn, Bravo Rebolledo, & can Franeker, 2015).
It has been confirmed that marine mammals, sea turtles, plankton, shellfish, fish 
and birds at various depths within the ocean water column in all parts of the globe 
have ingested plastic debris. The exact amount of plastics ingested by sea animals 
is dependent on their feeding habits. It is not just the floating plastics these animals 
ingest but also if they feed on prey their prey may contain plastic debris.
When it comes to ingesting plastic debris some of sea animals are fortunate in 
that they are able to release it before it enters the digestive system; they do this by 
throwing up (regurgitating) the indigestible materials. Also, debris shape and size 
is a factor and depending on the shape and size the debris may pass through the 
animals digestive system without doing any harm. The point is if the animal ingests 
materials that because of their shape and size and can’t regurgitate or pass it through 
their system, it may suffer serious health problems. Particular sizes and shapes of the 
ingested plastics and other debris can cut the digestive system, leading to infection 
and internal bleeding. Also, by ingesting debris it may block the animal’s digestive 
system, making it feel full, lowering its urge to eat and making it difficult for the 
animal to receive the nutrients they need to maintain their health—and their lives.
One of the problems related to plastic debris in our oceans is that they quickly 
become modes of transportation for this, that or whatever—including pollutants of 
the harmful variety. These hitchhikers attach themselves to the plastic debris and 
are transported to the far reaches of the oceans. The plastic debris and its harmful 
passengers may release chemicals that are part and parcel of the plastic manufactur­
ing process. When marine animals ingest these chemicals they become the edges 
of double-edged swords; that is, the marine animal may become ill or worse or on 
the other side of the double-edged sword the contaminated animal may be eaten by 
another animal and therefore it too becomes contaminated. The problem is that at the 
present time, we only know very little about what we should know about the harmful 
effects of marine animals ingesting plastic debris. Simply, there is a lot we do not 
know or understand about the ultimate damage to marine animals, to the environ­
ment and to the rest of us.
So, what is it that we know about plastic ingestion by marine life? Well, the best 
source of this information seems to be that provided by the reviewers, Kuhn et al. 

237
Ocean Pollution and Health
(2015). For example, in their well-thought-out review of the evidence, they have 
determined that 32% of sea turtles have plastic marine debris in their stomachs. In 
the case of sea birds, the reviewers report that 40% of seabird species studied have 
ingested plastic. Moreover, in their review of research about marine mammals they 
found 56% of all species (69 species) have been found to ingest debris. Earlier it was 
pointed out that one of the factors that is part of the plastisphere equation is persis­
tence. And this persistence is includes marine animals that have ingested debris; it 
can stay in their systems for a long time and is passed on to predators (persists) who 
consume the contaminated marine animals. Later reviews found strong increases in 
records were also listed for fish and invertebrates; these groups were not previously 
considered in any detail.
Plastic Waste Effect on Humans
With growing evidence there is no doubt about marine debris can cause problems 
for wildlife, but it can also affect the health of humans. To begin with, marine debris 
on a beach can be dangerous if sharp, like several glass and plastic fragments. Also, 
these sharp fragments can contain harmful chemicals and can be a real hazard to 
children. Larger plastic debris in the ocean can also be a hazard. Based on a personal 
run-in with a 10-gallon plastic bottle ¾ full and just hovering below the water surface 
it nailed me one day (many moons ago) while I was sailing a Hobie Cat (my former 
sport catamaran) in Chesapeake Bay. With a strong almost gale-force wind push­
ing me along at a record speed the port side of my craft struck the hidden 10-gallon 
plastic bottle floating an inch or two below the surface. The damage was extensive 
and a hard lesson learned.
So, larger debris can be a dangerous physical hazard to recreational boaters and 
is and has happened and still is—that is a given. However, the actual environmental 
and health risks associated with different plastics and associated chemicals to both 
marine wildlife and humans remain largely unknown—another one of those “we do 
not know what we do not know” scenarios.
We do know, however, that microplastics, tiny pieces of plastic 5 mm and smaller, 
have been found in the air, tap water, sea salt, bottled water and even in beer—and 
definitely in the fish that we eat. But for now let’s consider the National Geographic 
article by Laura Parker (2015) titled “Microplastics found in 90 Percent of table salt” 
a well-written discussion of a problem that most have no knowledge of but about a 
product that most of us use: salt.
Anyway Parker points out that microplastics were found in sea salt several years 
ago. And more importantly, maybe, is that now recent research has shown that the 
table salt that many of us use is accompanied by microplastics in 90% of the brands 
presently available. In a study I organized at Old Dominion University in one of my 
environmental classes the students were assigned to find out how many standard 
table salt brands contained plastic we found 16 different brands of sea salt contained 
microplastics. But here is the real problem, again, it is the old we do not know what 
we do not know about the potential harm of eating, drinking or inhaling microplas­
tics inside of us—a huge question mark (?), for sure. How much exposure to micro­
plastics actually begin to hurt us?

238
The Science of Ocean Pollution
The Bottom Line: We do not know how much input of microplastics is harmful 
to us. We need to find out.
Oil Spills
Oils spills are listed in the second tier in my ocean pollution column, Figure 19.1. 
According to NOAA (2022), each year, there are thousands of oil and chemical spills 
in coastal of the United States. Remember the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill? The 
spill began on April 20, 2010, with a blowout of BP’s Macondo drilling platform in 
the Gulf of Mexico. Along with the death of 11 men, the spill was one of the United 
States’ worst environmental disasters with approximately 200 million gallons of oil 
flowed from the Macondo well.
So, where did the oil travel, where did it go and where is it now?
Well, after the spill, the spilled oil met the environment—the ocean environment. 
First, the oil was weathered because of environmental exposure. Second, it evapo­
rated, emulsified into foam, naturally dispersed and/or dissolved. Third is when our 
“we do not know what we do not know” factor enters the scene, so to speak. The 
scene? Yes, anyway, we do know that a significant, but unknown, portion was broken 
down by microbes and the sun. Fourth, oil traveled to the seafloor by attaching or 
combining with particles (e.g., sand). Fifth, during the oil’s travel through the ocean 
water column to the seafloor, various animals ate oil particles or droplets and then 
excreted fecal pellets containing oil; all of which sank to the floor.
Keep in mind that the BP Deepwater Horizon spill is an excellent example of a 
huge oil spill into the sea or ocean. Other oil spills from small boats, ships and at sea 
transfers of oil contribute a share of the oil contamination (see Figure 19.2).
With regard to marine oil spills and their effect on life, human and wildlife the 
release of oil into out coastal waterways can (and has) kill wildlife, destroy habitat A view of the presence of concentrated patches of a dark, oily substance floating on the water's surface along the New Orleans river walk, indicating a discharge of heavy fuel oil. The floating oil is close to the boardwalk, where there are multiple large buildings built right on the edge of the boardwalk.

Ocean Pollution and Health
and contaminate critical resources in the food chain. The oil also destroys the insu­
lating ability of fur-bearing mammals, such as sea otters. For birds, oil contamina­
tion affects the water repellency of their feathers. Without the ability to shed water 
and insulate from cold water, birds and mammals die from hypothermia.
Many birds poison themselves when they ingest oil in attempting to clean them­
selves. Juvenile sea turtles can also become trapped in oil and mistake it for food. 
Whales and dolphins can inhale oil, which can affect lungs, immune function and 
reproduction.
The bottom line: Marine life exposed to oil may not suffer death but the oil can 
make the fish and shellfish unsafe for humans to eat. Oil spills kill the marine micro­
organisms that produce oxygen.
Mercury (Heavy Metals)
Mercury and heavy metals flow into the oceans when industrial, agricultural and 
human wastes run off or are deliberately discharged into rivers that then empty into 
the sea. These pollutants cause disease, genetic mutations, birth defects, reproduc­
tive difficulties, behavioral changes and death in many marine organisms (USEPA, 
2015). Mercury and other heavy metals enter the food chain when erosion breaks 
down rocks and releases their metal components into streams and groundwater. 
Mercury and heavy metals used on farms, or around the house, are spilled and 
spread on the grounds where they too are washed into rivers by the rain or soaked 
into the soil to mix with groundwater. Incorrectly or insufficiently treated industrial 
wastes and raw sewage are discharged directly into rivers. Much of this material 
eventually settles to the bottom of the ocean water column. Bottom-dwelling clams 
ingest the mercury and heavy metals as they burrow into the mud. When humans, 
birds and fish devour the clams, or birds and humans eat the fish that ate the clams, 
they also eat the mercury or heavy metals stored within their prey or table food of 
humans.
The Bottom Line: Focusing on the health risks of oceanic mercury it presents a 
serious threat to human health. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
states that mercury consumption by people of all ages can result in loss of peripheral 
vision, weakened muscles, impairment of hearing and speech and deterioration of 
movement coordination (USEPA, 2015).
Chemicals (Manufactured)
Toxic chemicals flow into the oceans when industrial, agricultural and human wastes 
run off or are deliberately discharged into rivers that then empty into the sea. These 
pollutants cause disease, genetic mutations, birth defects, reproductive difficulties, 
behavioral changes and death in many marine organisms. Manufactured chemicals 
enter the food chain when erosion breaks down rocks and releases their chemical 
components into streams and groundwater. Chemicals used on farms, or around the 
house, are spilled and spread on the grounds where they too are washed into rivers 
by the rain or soaked into the soil to mix with groundwater. Incorrectly or insuffi­
ciently treated industrial wastes and raw sewage are discharged directly into rivers. 

240
The Science of Ocean Pollution
Much of this material eventually settles to the bottom of the ocean water column. 
Bottom-dwelling clams ingest the manufactured chemicals as they burrow into the 
mud. When humans, birds and fish devour the clams, or birds and humans eat the 
fish that ate the clams, they also eat the manufactured chemicals stored within their 
prey or table food of humans.
Note that many of the manufactured chemicals used to make pharmaceuticals and 
personal care products (PPCPs) find their way into rivers or directly deposited by 
boaters into the oceans. The following discussion explains PPCPs and their impact 
on water. Keep in mind that in addition to fresh water and potable water contamina­
tion by PPCPs, they also end up in the oceans by boat discharges and by the rivers 
that enter the oceans.
Sick Water
The term Sick Water was coined by the United Nations in a 2010 press release 
addressing the need to recognize that it is time to arrest the global tide of sick water.1 
The gist of the UN’s report pointed out that transforming waste from a major health 
and environmental hazard into a clean, safe and economically attractive resource is 
emerging as a key challenge in the 21st century. As practitioners of environmental 
health, we certainly support the UN’s view on this important topic.
However, when we discuss sick water, in the context of this text and in many 
others we have authored on the topic we go a few steps further than the UN in 
describing the real essence and tragic implications of potable water that makes 
people or animals sick or worse or at least can be classified as sick again, in our 
opinion.
Water that is sick is actually a filthy medium, spent water, wastewater—a cock­
tail of fertilizer run-off and sewage disposal alongside animal, industrial, agricul­
tural and other wastes. In addition to these listed wastes of concern, other wastes 
that are beginning to garner widespread attention; they certainly have earned 
our attention in our research on the potential problems related to these so-called 
“other” wastes.
What are these other wastes? Any waste or product we dispose of in our waters; 
that we flush down the toilet, pour down the sink, or bathtub, pour down the drain of 
a worksite deep sink. Consider the following example of “pollutants” we discharge 
to our wastewater treatment plants or septic tanks—wastes we don’t often consider 
as waste products, but that in reality are waste products.
Pesticides
The primary source of pesticides in marine waters is from land to sea. Pesticides 
enter coastal waters after rain washes the chemicals into waterways that flow to the 
sea. Surface water runoff of pesticide-contaminated water is typically from farms 
and from neighborhoods where they are applied on lawns. Pesticides can also enter 
waterways and coastal waters as a result of what is called “spray drift.” The is the 
most challenging problem with applying pesticides; the pesticide is sprayed over an 
area and the wind blows some of the spray into a nearby waterbody.

241
Ocean Pollution and Health
Nutrients
Nutrients run off of land in urban areas where garden and lawn fertilizers are used. 
Wildlife and pet wastes are also sources of nutrients. This process is also known as 
eutrophication and was discussed in Chapter 1. Excessive amounts of nutrients can 
lead to more serious problems such as low levels of oxygen dissolved in the water. 
Several algal growths blocks light that is needed for plants, such as seagrasses, to 
grow. When the algae and seagrass die, they decay. In the process of decay, the 
oxygen in the water is used up and this leads to low levels of dissolved oxygen in 
the water. This, in turn, kills marine animals including fish, crabs, oysters and other 
aquatic animals.

Conclusion
THE BLOB REVISITED
Reams of paper have been used to record countless tomes about it; some of these are 
strictly poetry; some are fiction depicting some barnacle-covered, dressed in sea­
weed scaly-looking body with many appendages and all of them active like the … a 
giant squid, an apparition that turns whole when it bubbles its way from the depths of 
the desert ocean to the surface of a different world—the floating world.
After having literally sailed the seven seas, some seas more times than the other I 
fondly recall the beauty of the south Pacific Ocean, north and south Atlantic Ocean, 
the blueness of the Indian Ocean, the skimming by boat north and south, up and 
down the Red Sea, the Galapagos Islands, the South China Sea, the Sea of Japan and 
several other global locations I have come to realize and to appreciate the inherent 
beauty of that watery mass that covers 70% of Earth.
Thus, in my observations of human-caused pollution in basically every reach of 
the oceans I traveled, when I witnessed the floating masses of garbage, discards, 
remnants of this or that I have always felt a twinge internally similar to that feeling, 
I would have if someone deliberately vandalized the Mona Lisa or some other mas­
terpiece created by the other side of humans—the creative side.
Then I think about Keats.
Keats?
Yes.
Precisely I think of John Keats’s 1819 “Ode to Melancholy” which points out that 
of which we care not to acknowledge but at the same time we know to be the truth: 
“Keats says the only way we can really appreciate the world in all of its complexity 
and beauty is to feel sorrow at the fact that everything is passing.” So when I looked 
upon the floating seas 60 years ago and compare it to the here and, now I realize 
that the seas are not as beautiful as they might seem. Why are the real, that is, the 
untainted seas, not beautiful? Well, because the floating seas are transient, they are 
fragile, they are spoiled, they are dying right before our eyes; it is passing—we long 
for things to remain the same and not to die.
With all the human-caused pollution thrown or dumped into the seas that I have 
witnessed and, in some cases, have helped to mitigate the mess through clean-up 
efforts, it is important to note that all floating seas pollution is not human-caused.
No, not all.
For example, a present cause of floating sea pollution, as pointed out by Baio 
(2023), is that a naturally derived blob of stinky (possesses that sulfur dioxide and 
rotten egg odor) algae, Sargassum, that is presently approaching the coast of Florida 
to wreck wherever it lands. Sargassum is often found floating on the surface of the 

244
The Science of Ocean Pollution
ocean or washed up on beaches. And like almost all bad things, there is a good side 
to sargassum, and there is good for the ecosystem, but too much of the stinky stuff 
is almost unbearable to the average person and painful to those suffering from respi­
ratory ailments/diseases. Moreover, too much sargassum blocks canals and other 
waterway structures and passageways. One of the significant features of the massive 
blob is the fact that it is present at all—this is not the normal time of year when it 
thrives and grows into huge masses.
What is going on?
We are not sure.
The bottom line: Floating seas pollution is unforgiveable and unsustainable. 
However, again, we need to keep in mind that not all ocean pollution is human-
caused. Nature also has a hand in it. The difference? We have to live up to and 
acknowledge our mantra: no longer needed or wanted so we throw it away into the 
seas. While Nature is different it creates huge floating blobs and other forms of con­
tamination, but she works with a plan, a master plan—we need to figure out what the 
master plan is all about before our passing. Will we pass as described in Asimov’s 
story “Nightfall” (1941). He describes six suns that surround a planet so that it never 
experiences darkness. Then a freak eclipse blocks all six suns, and all of civilization 
is thrown into panic—doomed in its passing.
If the floating seas die, are we all doomed?
