Welcoming the 64C
Commodore's long awaited and much
trumpeted 64C has ﬁnally been re-
leased in a classic Commodore gift
pack in time for the Christmas rush.
Billed as a new personal computer
for home, schools and businesses.
Commodore describes its  design as
pace-setting and its  colouring (the
same as the I28's) as eye-catching
ivory and grey.
Described as completely compat-
ible with the C64 (and believed to be a
CM with a face lift by many in the
know). Commodore claims buyers of
the new machine will have access to the
largest software base in the world.
YOUR COMMODORE december 1986:5
Commodore's aim in launching the
new machine is to use it to form the
basis of a second generation of oper-
ating methods and facilities,complete-
ly n e w  t o  t h e  h o m e  c omputer
marketplace.
Commodore's C h r i s  K a d a y
commented: "The mixed business and
home c omputer audience a t  t his
(PCW) show has exposed this product
to the broadest potential user base
possible. Their intitial reaction bodes
well for  every associated person and
company in the computer industry, re-
tailers who are eager to sell it and soft-
ware developers who will enjoy the
challenge of producing new packages
to exploit its facilities."
The 64C has been launched in a
package including games and a mouse
under the label Connoisseur's Collec-
tion. The exact contents of the package
is as follows: the 64C plus cassette unit,
mouse and cheese colour graph ics soft-
ware, Pitmans Ty ping Tutor, plus
computer versions of the board games
Monopoly, Scrabble, Cluedo, Chess
and Renaissance.
The price of the Connoisser's Col-
lection is £249.99,

According to the Makers of the Speed-
king joystick, the demand for  their
product has been so great since its
launch in January this year, that they
have been hard pressed to meet it. In
fact Konix  claims that demand has
outstripped supply three times over.
This situation has now changed
(see pic) with Konix fairly drowning
under a waterfall of joysticks coming
off the production lines at the factory
in Tredegar, Wales. So if you have had
a yearning for a new Speedking joy-
stick for the last twelve months and
met with bitter regret and disappoint-
ment at your inability to obtain this
coveted possession then you can now
breath a sigh of relief,
Wyn Holloway of Konix said (as he
loomed out of a cardboard box): "We
would like to thank all our customers
for their patience over the last few
months. Now that the joystick can be
produced in sufﬁcient numbers we can
concentrate on ensuring the best joy-

stick yet is also the best-selling joystick
yet." The price is E12.9.5.
Cheetah Marketing also believes
that it has the ultimate joystick with
the Mach 1, Features of the Mach I
which Cheetah hopes will justify this
claim are: four ﬁre buttons, two in the
base and two in the handle, to ensure
that both left and right handed players
can use it comfortably: fast return-to-
centre ac tion; r apid ac tion s lider
switch f o r  autoﬁre; f o u r  gripping
suction pads on the base, It's built
from h ig h  impac t, wear  resistant
material w i t h  t o p  quality  mic r o-
switches and a high grade metal shaft.
The cost? E14.95.

Enter the dank,
masterpiece and see i f you can survive.
By Stuart Cooke
he arcade game gauntlet has certainly started off a new
craze in computer games. Many companies are producing
clones or programs similar to this superb arcade game.
Firebird's offering is Druid. It has everything you would
expect, spells, scrolling dungeons, treasure and obviously an
overall goal. What's more it is exceptionally easy to play.
Give it a couple of minutes and you'll be hooked. Even so it's
going to take you quite a while to win.
The object of the game is to guide your druid through
numerous levels of dungeon and ﬁnd your evil skulls that
were created by the Princes of Darkness. At the start of
the game our Druid ﬁnds himself wandering around a forest
with a number of spells to protect him. No sooner has he
started on his quest than the enemy lets his goats and giants
at you. Be thankful that your druid is carrying a number of
water spells as a quick blast from one of these is enough to
banish the nasties back to whatever plane of your C64's
circuitry they came from.
The water spell isn't the only one that your druid can use.
He has access to ﬁre and electricity spells which effect

different monsters that he meets upon his travels, different
spells having more effect on some ﬂashes than others. A key

he should want to. Invisibility spells allow your druid to

You can replenish your supply of spells by searching the
treasure chests that you ﬁnd on your way. Be warned
however, make sure that you choose the right item from the
treasure since the rest will disappear as soon as one item is
removed.
The Chaos and Invisibility spells are quite easy to
understand, the Golem however needs further explanation.
The Golem when brought into life will wander around the
playing area either under the contorl of yourself or that of a
second player, with a second joystick. The Ciolem has no
interest in its own safety and kills everything that it comes
into contact with, even if this does mean that his energy is
reduced and he will ﬁnally disappear into nothing. If you are
letting the Druid control the Golem then it does take quite a
lot of handling. Getting the Golem to go where you want it
to is sometimes nigh on impossible. Quite often he'll simply
get in your way so that you can't move anywhere. When
another player takes control the game becomes much easier.
With the Golem taking care of the nasties the Druid has
much more time available to him to ﬁnd treasure chests and
the way deeper into the complex, and hopefully to the four
skulls.
Energy is something that not only the Golem loses upon
contact with the enemy but the Druid also suffers from this
type of loss. As with most mortals, the druid does only have
one life. He can however replenish his energy but standing
upon one of the mystical pentagrams that are to be found

while chasing after the skulls.
The graphics used within the game are in the main
excellent with only a few of the monsters lacking in reality.
There's nothing worse than watching a quivering ghoul
heading towards you when you've just ran out of spells. The
monsters lack any real intelligence and seem to take the
shortest path to you. This means that a nasty will quite often
fuld itself stuck behind some object be it a wall of some
foliage allowing the druid to pick it off at his leisure.
The actual playing area consists of a number of large
scrolling levels. The scrolling of the background being very
smooth. As with real life the fact that you don't see the whole
screen is annoying when you ﬁnd you've just battled your
way past a horde of giant ants only to ﬁnd yourself at a dead
end and having to retrace your steps.
Druid is an excellent game. It is extremely simple to play
with minimal controls, the joystick is used for movement
with just a lew keys to select spells etc. but extremely difﬁcult
to master.
numerous levels of the game are enough to keep both
the newcomer to computer games and the arcade freak
hooked for quite some time.

Wigmore Offer
Your Commodore together with Wigmore House present
a host of special offers on their mouse and related
material.
T
placing, among other items, a mouse
and graphics software on cassette. We
reviewed this mouse in the March '86
issue of Your Commodore and were
very impressed with it.
Wigtnore, t h e  c ompany  w h ic h
markets the mouse, has recently re-
leased a new package called Artist 64
to which we gave a glowing review in
the November 1986 issue of the maga-
zine.
Because we were so impressed by
the mouse and its associated software
we have teamed u p  with Wigniore
House to provide our readers with a
series of special offers based around
these products.
1) Firstly we have the mouse itself. As
previously mentioned Commodore
was so impressed with this package
that i t  has been bundled int o the
Christmas Connoisseur's collection
package. T h e  Software Cheese i s
supplied on cassette and is an excellent
introductory graphics package. The
mouse is well constructed and even has
a mode which enables it to imitate a
joystic k.
The usual price for this package is
249.99, We are able to make. it avail-
able to you for just E42.90 plus £1.50
P&P.
2) As mentioned above the graphics
package that comes with the mouse is a
tape only version. Wigmore has made
a disk available and we are also offer-
ing a special offer on this, This may
also be o f  interest to purchasers of
Commodore's Christmas pack who
would want their mouse to work with
disk. Price, just 1:7.90 plus 75p p&p
compared to a normal price of E8.50
plus p&p. The disk software loads at 5-
6 times normal disk speed.
3) Artist 64 is an excellent graphics
package a n d  w e  wer e extremely
impressed with its range of capabili-
ties. I t  is in fact probably the most
versatile graphics program that we
have seen. You don't need a mouse to
use it as the software will quite happily
work with joystick.
READERS SERVICE
75p p&p.
Price, just E29.50 plus
Usual price 04.90.
4) Desk Top takes the mouse even
further. It gives your C64 (or (.'I28 in

ties which are accessed by the mouse.

great enigma: the John Bull Rolled
Oats packet. It carried a large picture
of John Bull, with top hat and Union
Jack vest, proudly carrying a packet of
John Bull Rolled Oats. If you looked
carefully you could see that this
illustrated packet had its own picture
of John Bull: smaller but equally
resplendent, and he was deﬁnitely
carrying a further, microcopic, packet
of rolled oats. Many a breakfast was
absent-mindedly consumed by people
seeking the answer to the fundamental
question o f  h o w  m a n y  e ve r-
diminishing John Bulls could be seen,
assuming. as economists say, perfect
information and better printing than is
usually found on the average porridge

seize on something like this to explain
the capacity of twentieth century man
to deal with recursively structured
computer languages!

reasonable given its usefulness and
quality.
Icons
There are many other programs o f
interest to  the serious applications
user. For example a AKMDOS up-
loaded by AM 12 has recently been
updated. This provides an icon drive
disk operating system as well as other
features. It costs a mere E1.99 (GOTO

These programs s h o w  t h e
advantages of buying user software on
Compunet. You can read the docu-
mentation a t  your leisure before
purchase. There are detailed reviews
available in the directories alongside
the program, o r  you can GOTO
REVIEWS for a full set. It is easy to
contact th e  programmer o r  th e
reviewer with queries. And, i f  my
experience is anything to go by, the
authors are only too keen to discuss
the use of their programs and consider
modiﬁcations o r improvements, try
that with commercially purchased
software! Finally, you can hear the
opinions from a range of other users.
For instance some comments b y
purchasers have been uploaded near
the DRIVER program, covering the
use o f the interface with a range of
printers.

routines for the slightly more serious
user. Over the months, I  intend to
describe some routines which will
simplify t h e  w ri ti n g  o f  Basic
programs. The majority o f routines
will be in machine code thus allowing
you to perform complex sequences by
the use of a simple SYS call.
This ﬁrst package is somewhat
larger than most and provides three
quarters of a WIMP environment. For
those of you who don't know, WIMP
means, Window, Icons, Mouse and
Pointers, This package mostly covers
the IMP part since Windows would
need quite a bit more code.
Newer machines use the WIMP
system to provide a simple "front end"
whereby a user with little training can
use the software. Icons (little pictures)
are used to represent functions, these
being selected with pointers controlled
by a mouse. Due to the constraints of
such a  system, bit mapping o f the
screen is mandatory. Hence this rather
large lump of code.
The code is in two Basic loaders
(listing I  parts I  and 2), Before I
describe how you use the routines, it is
best if I indicate the memory usage.

Create an easy to use icon environment in your own
programs with the ﬁrst routine in a new series.
By Allen Webb
The package p ro vi d e s 2 1
commands. They are entered via a
jump table starting at $C000 (49152).
shall refer to this address as SA from
now on.
SETUP (SYS SA, INK,
PAPER, BORDER
This routine switches o n  the b i t
mapped screen and sets the ink, paper
and border colours as required. Ink
refers to the colour of set points, and
paper refers to the colour o f unset
points. I have adopted high resolution
mode with 320 by 200 points and two
colours. This gives the most satisfying
results. This routine clears the bit map.
COLSET (SYS SA+3, INK
PAPER)
This instruction sets the bit map to the
speciﬁed colours without clearing the
area.
TURNON (SYS SA+6)
This command simply turns on the bit
map whilst leaving the pattern and
colour untouched.
TEXT (SYS SA+9)
This allows you to return to the normal
text screen.
POINT (SYS SA+12, X, Y,
FLAG)
This is the ﬁrst instruction involved
with the changing of the screen inform-
ation. The command acts on the point
X,Y according to the value of the ﬂag:
Flag = 0

The routine checks the X and Y
values. Values greater than the screen
range are set to the maximum value on
the screen.
CHANGECOL (SYS
SA+15, INK, PAPER)
You may, from time to time, want to
change the colours in a particular area.
This command does this but leaves the
rest of the screen untouched.
ZONE (SYS SA+18, XS,
YS, XF, YF, FLAG)
This command is closely related to
POINT in that it is used to change a
rectangle o f screen according to the
FLAG (see command point for the
values). The rectangle is deﬁned by its
top left corner (XS, YS) and its bottom
right corner (XF,YF). The command
acts to single pixel resolution and is
therefore a little slow,
CHARS (SYS SA+21,
ADDRESS)
The ability to print text on the screen is
a crucial part o f this package. The
designs of the characters used are kept
in a block o f RAM from SCBOO to
SCF00. This provides enough space
for 256 characters. You can of course,
load your own designs to this area.
Alternatively, you can copy the 64's
character se t d o w n  using th i s
instruction. The relevant addresses
are:
Upper case  
5
3
2

Lower case

TOGGLE (SYS SA+24)
The system used location 1000 to
decide whether the colour matrix is to

be updated each time a point is mani-
pulated. This instruction toggles this
location. This allows you to alter the
design without messing up the colours.
It is wise to POKE 1000 with one at the
start o f  your programs to  enable
colour updating.
BASICSCREEN (SYS
SA+27)
This routine sets up a standard screen
design. This has the form of a sheet of
paper with a shaded heading zone and
a "previous page" icon. The default
colours are set to two grey shades.
M A N E  (SYS SA+30, XS,
YS, XF, FLAG)
This draws a horizontal line from XS
to XF at YS according to the value of
the FLAG (see PLOT).
VLINE (SYS SA+33, XS,
YS, YF, FLAG)
This i s  th e  vertical analogue t o
HLINE.
SHAPE (SYS SA+36,
ADDRESS, X, Y, WIDTH,
HEIGHT, FLAG, RF)
The main vital aspect of this system is
the use o f shape tables to generate
icons. This command draws a shape
stored in RAM starting at the speciﬁed
address. The top left corner o f the
drawn shape is placed at X,Y and the
shape occupies a square of characters
of speciﬁed width and height. The ﬂags
have the following effects:

The character A is deﬁned by eight
bytes, as is B etc. These must be stored
in sequence in RAM, i.e.
ABCDEF
If you're not sure about redeﬁning
characters, take a  look a t the 64
Programmer's Reference Guide.
PTEXT (SYS SA+39,
TEXT, LINE, TAB, FLAG,
RF)
This command prints a line of text on a
speciﬁed line starting at a speciﬁed
horizontal offset (TAB). The effects of
FLAG and RF are as in SHAPE.
Text can be input as a string or in
quotes, the following examples being
valid:
SYS SA-1-39,AS,5,5,0,0
SYS S A - I - 3 9 ,
SYS SA-1-39,"FILE "- I- F1 $ + "
SCRATCHED",0,0,0,0
ZSHAPE (SYS SA+42, X,
Y, WIDTH, HEIGHT, ZF)
This instruction acts on an area of
whole characters o f speciﬁed height
and width with its top left corner at
X,Y. ZF has the values:
ZF-
ZF=2   r e v e r s e  ﬁeld zone
4-1
This instruction is useful for high-
lighting areas and providing non-
destructive cursors.
ICON (SYS SA+45,
ICON, NUMBER, X, Y,
FLAG, RF)
felt that it would be handy to provide
a resident library o f icons. I  have
therefore provided 13 o f  the most
commonly used_ The speciﬁed icon is

SAMPLE I CONS
tﬁ
YOUR COMMODORE december 1986:21

STO WIT (SYS SA+48)
This instruction copies the current
screen (both bit pattern and colours) to
two storage buffers. This allows you to
keep a default display on hand for use
v‘rith the "last page" icon.
GETIT (SYS SA+51)
This is the compliment of STO WIT in
that it recalls any screen currently in
the storage buffers.
PRINTMENU (SYS
SA+54, TEXT, LINE, TAB,
WIDTH, FLAG, RF, INK,
PAPER)
The crux of WIM P systems is the use of
pull down menus. These comprise of
lists of options in the form of a box,
from which you can make selections.
This option took  the most thought
since I  want i t  t o  have maximum
ﬂexibility. T h e  tex t giv en i n  t h e
command is  printed as  a  box  o f
speciﬁed width with it's top left corner
at the speciﬁed line and tab position.
FLAG and RF have their usual effects
and y o u  may  set t h e  colours as
required to give appropriate contrast
from the background.
You should ensure that the text
length is an exact multiple of the menu
width. I f  you don't, the command
won't crash but your menu may not
look quite right. In addition, you must
insert all spaces. Consider this simple
menu and imagine that all asterisks
represent spaces:

VAL I D AT E" " *SC R AT C H *F I L E
A width. of 13 should be used.
POINTER (SYS SA+57,
M U ,  COL2)
This c ommand initialis es  t h e
pointer. This has the form of an arrow
pointing northwest. To give a feeling
of depth, the pointer has one colour
C64 PROGRAM
(COL1 ) and a shadow (COL2). The
command has the action:
I) Turns on the pointer sprite.
2) Puts the pointer at the top left
corner of the screen.
3) Turns on the interrupt to drive the
pointer.
The pointer  i s  controlled b y
joystick in port 2. Since the poiner is
interrupt d r iv e n ,  i t  i s  m o v e d
independently of any Basic program.
You c an,  however, monit or  t h e
pointer's progress f r o m  Basic b y
PEEKing three locations:
869 h o l d s  the number of the line
pointed to
870 holds the number of the column
pointed to
868   h o l d s  the ﬁre button status
(0=pressed. 16=not pressed)
K I L L  (SYS SA+60)
This disables t h e  pointer . T h i s
command is  required on occasions
such as when accessing disks.
Examples
Well that's all of them. The important
point to appreciate is that this package
is deliberately general so that it can be
used for the widest possible range of
applications. You still have to write the
BASIC kernal program. So that you
have an idea of how to use the program
I've included a simple demonstration
in listing 2. This program is by no
means optimum and is simply there to
show you how the system works and to
give a  few ideas (so no complaints
about the poor structure).
The program is a simple disk aid.
The basic screen shows a simple four
option menu. This is selected by the
pointer w it h  t h e  option currently
pointed to highlighted. The last page
icon i n  the t o p  r ight corner also
functions. To choose an option, point
at the required option and press ﬁre.
You will notice that neither icons nor
menu light up until the pointer is on
the relevant area.this feature is crucial.
Try using the program, apart from
pressing Y or N at one stage, you need
just the joystick.
The most important part o f  the
routine occupies lines 110 to 900. In
summary, the lines have the following
effects:
YOUR COMMODORE december 1986:22
110: Set up menu limits.
115: Scan ﬁre button and see if pointer
is looking at an option or icon.
120: Read current line and column.
130: Check whether pointer is off the
menu. I f  not go to 180.
140: On menu, if currently pointing to
an option, go back to 115.
150: Pointing to new option so reverse
ﬁeld last option.
160: Highlight new option and return
to 115.
170: Back to 115.
180: Are we pointing to the icon, if so
go to 210.
185: If not and we were looking at the
icon then de-highlight icon and back to
115.
190: Back to 115.
200: Reset icon.
210: Highlight icon and back to 115
900: This performs the -
function.
I've used the ﬂags FL and RF to
keep track o f  whether an option is
highlighted or not. Additionally, RF
holds the position on the screen of the
option in a menu. Since we know the
position of the top of the menu, we can
easily calculate the number o f  the
option (line 1000 shows this).
The scratch option also uses a copy
of this routine but uses a menu based
on the array FIS which is crated by the
catalogue subroutine.
The o n l y  o p t io n  w hic h is n ' t
covered by the package is the input of
text fr om the keyboard. This  need
should not arise too often, but if  it
should, tr y  listing 3  o r  something
similar.
Given the time, I will write a more
structured program which will really
show what this package will do.

was with much anticipation that
we took ourselves 20 miles down the
motorway to the great metropolis of
Manchester to see this year's Com-
modore Show.
For whatever reason, i t  w a s
decided that an alternative venue to
London was to be used this year. In all,
it was a mistake.
Compared to previous shows, this
was a  rather small and unexciting
affair. Hav ing said that, w e  have
nothing but praise for those companies
that did choose to attend, for the rest,
we simply despair.
The choice of a date so close to the
PCW show was probably the main
error, but the deliberate choice of the
major software houses to only attend
the London show sealed the fate of this
event, We know that times are tough
for the industry but by ignoring the
Commodore Show, the industry is
simply biting the hand of those that
feed it, i.e. Commodore owners and
users. It was also particularly hard on
those of us who live in the north and
who cannot afford the price of attend-
ing the skows held in London.
OK, having got that gripe out of
the way, here's a rundown of the high-
spots of the show.
Overall there were about 50 stands,

Commodore Show in Manchester, our show report brings
you the highlights.

the centre-piece probably being Com-
modore's.
The New Boys
The 64C was very much in evidence, as
was the Amiga. This was our ﬁrst close
encounter with the Amiga and we were
thoroughly impressed. We had a long
chat with David Hill of Commodore
who alluded to all sorts of interesting
plans without giving any details. There
certainly appears to be some special
64C package for Christmas, the only
question is will it make the machine
attractive enough to sell? We somehow
suspect that it won't.
Sadly, there was no indication as to
what action was to be taken to make
the Amiga more accessible to the home
user.
It's a Gas
SHOW REPORT
Whilst on the subject of the Amiga,
Sophus had an Amiga running a trans-
puter via a sidecar. For those of you
who hav en't m e t  i t ,  t h e  sidecar
converts t h e  A m i g a  i n t o  a n
IBM ulator. Since they hadn't got the
necessary graphics driver, i t  wasn't
possible t o  hav e a  ﬂashy demo.
YOUR COMMODORE december 1986:30
Instead, the transputor was quietly
calculating the diffusion of a gas in a
stagnant room. Not guaranteed to get
everyone twitc hing b u t  impressive
enough.
School Days
The greatest source o f  noise in the
place was the Colleen stand. T his
company has a number of interesting
products most of which are aimed at
the educational market, The area o f
music is well supported by a Music
Compendium and a Music Creator. The
compendium seems to be a complete
teach yourself system and appeared to
be quite comprehensive. The Music
Creator allows you to write your tune
and then converts it into a piece of
interrupt driven code. This allows YOU
to us e t h e  mus ic  i n  y o u r  o w n
programs. The value of the creator has
exempliﬁed by  a  Quilled adventure
called M  ystery V  oyage. I t  w a s
rumoured that a future Quill system
may well include a patch to this music
system. It will be interesting to see if
this materialises. A particularly inter-
esting product fr om Colleen was a
variant using Anirog's Voice Activated
Unit. This allows you to write music by

simply uttering the notes. Due to the
noise at the show, the device was not
demonstrated but there was a video
showing its abilities. It appears that the
system, as with all Colleen's range, is
aimed at the disabled and as such will
be a  valuable and cheap aid. We
managed to get hold of a preview copy
of Colleen's forthcoming educational
software. Wa tch  th e  Education
column for our appraisal of it.
The Hard Stuff
Evesham Micros h a d  th e  usual
hardware goodies on show with a part-
icular emphasis on Dolphin DOS. This
hardware addition for your disk drive
enables signiﬁcant increases i n
LOADing and SAVEing speeds. Since
the overall performance of the disk is
increased, and even fast loaders are
handled more quickly. The result is
quite phenomenal.
Another hardware specialist
company which attended was Trilogic.
Trilogic's ﬂagship device is the Expert
Cartridge. This device uses software
from disk rather than on ROM to give
a ﬂexible, easily updated, product.
Apart from the existing freeze frame
and monitor functions, nibblers and a
'reverse assembler ( a  disassembler
which gives useable source code) are in
the pipeline. A  new product is the
Scorpion. This is a device which allows
the use of either joystick port for a
single stick. A switch on the top of the
box allows you to switch the stick to
either port or both. We've tried this
unit out and it's certainly well made
and works well. It's main value is that
by eliminating the need to physically
move your joystick from one port to
the other, it prevents nasty accidents
which might blow your interface chip.
On the whole, a nice little number. For
128 owners, Trilogic offers a gizmo
called I-CON which converts RGBI to
RGB so allowing you t o  get 80
columns on TVs. Since not all TVs are
suitable, you should talk to Trilogic if
you are interested.
Clubbing
For the real enthusiasts, there was the
usual stand from ICPUG (Independ-
ent Commodore Products User
Group). Using the normal cunning
and guile the Club managed to extract
SHOW REPORT
our renewal fee fro m o u r  over
burdened bank account. Seriously,
though, at only E10, membership is a
great investment.
All Systems Go
System Software had a number of very
interesting items. Th i s company
specialises in compilers for various
languages. The well known Petspeed
has been extended to the 128 and looks
very interesting. A new product is a
beast called Hackpack 128. This is a
collection of toolkit items and includes
a RAM-disk facility. A 64 compilation
comprising of Pascal and Basic com-
pilers and a toolkit is also on the cards.
Analytically speaking
The supposed selling point of the 64C
is a thing called GEOS. First Analyti-
cal L td , the U K  agents fo r this
product, was in attendance. GEOS, if
you don't know, is a window/icon
system providing ﬁle handling, a text
handler and a graphics pack. It seems
quite a nice suite of programs. Spread-
sheet and word processor software are
scheduled for later this year making
the system more attractive to  the
serious user. GEOS is an interesting
albeit expensive package which i s
worthy 'of a close look. See elsewhere
in this issue for a detailed review.
More from Meedmore
Meedmore (Distribution) had an inter-
esting mix of items. On the one hand,
they had a range of hardware from the
now defunct STACK Computers. On
the other there was also a rather nice
mouse driven graphics package called
ARTIST. This software was capable of
most functions one expects from
graphics routines and gave some inter-
esting results.
On Line
The two main exponents of network-
ing Compunet and Micronet — were
in evidence with special subscription
offers. These systems have improved a
great deal and offer a wide range of
facilities to those who can afford the
phone bill (although they make the
point that it's not that expensive!).
YOUR COMMODORE december 1986:31
Repair Shop
A common source of anguish is the
problem o f  obtaining spares when
your machine turns its toes up. HRS
Electronics Ltd, which claims to be the
sole UK Distributor of CBM spares,
were very much in evidence. Certainly,
they may be a life saver for those
obscure little items.
Conclusion
So what was our overall impression?
Well, the most appropriate word is
disappointed. We got the feeling that
this was a  poorly organised show
which made the E3 entrance fee very
steep. This impression of shabbiness
was enhanced by the poorly produced
Ofﬁcial Guide which was a joke to say
the least. The use of a venue other than
London is a good move but it must
receive the same degree o f support
from the industry as the London based
shows — the world does not end at the
Watford Gap!

of the 1541 disk drive, and the un-
reasonable expense o f  the 1570/1
drive, What alternative for Commo-
dore owners is there except to sell the
car? Perhaps the Enhancer 2000 could
help you avoid the necessity of such
drastic action.
The Enhancer 2000 is a third party
(i.e. you didn't make it, neither did
Commodore) replacement for the ofﬁ-
cial Commodore 1541 disk drive, with
which i t  is  reasonably compatible.
Externally it looks like what a 1541
should have looked like if the designer
of it hadn't had a headache at the time,
It is a slim, half-height unit, and is the
same grotty grey as the Commodore
64. The considerable size reduction has
been achieved by  putting the power
supply outside the case in the same way
as that of the Commodore 64.
This is  a very sensible idea and
doesn't clutter up your desk with too
many big boxes. The Enchancer 2000
has a footprint of about half that of the
1541, neat and simple.
HARDWARE R E V IE W
Disk Drive
2000
Fed up of  your 1541 disk drive. Firstline Software has
brought out an alternative drive for the C64.
By Myeroftt Appleby
The connections around the back
are the usual two serial sockets and the
power in. This is the same type o f
socket, but the plugs will not go into
each other 's  sockets. O therwis e
connecting up is the same as a normal
drive.
As f a r  as  us ing the device is
concerned, it is operationally identical
to the 1541. A ll the commands are
there, even some of the more advanced
and lesser used ones in an attempt to
improve t h e  c ompatibility . T h e
manual, however, is a bit disappoint-
ing,
If somebody had said that this was
possible to produce a worse manual
than Commodore I would have had
doubts, but now I know that it's true.
The Enhancer manual i s  awful.
However, there ar e a  number o f
Commodore disk drive books on the
market and any  one o f  them w ill
sufﬁce.
If this all sounds like money for
jam, then I'm sorry because I  have
saved the horrid bits until last. The
YOt COMMODORE december 1986:34
Enhancer 2000 is not compatible with
most commercial software, Anything
with a fast European turbo or some of
the more recent American turbos, will
not work, Likewise a lot of the more
ﬁendish European copy protections.
The Am e r ic a n  pr otec tions  a r e
catching up (like Activision), but some
of it will still run (like Epyx).
With some software however, it is
the case that the program will run, but
you cannot make a copy of it.
On the subject o f  turbos, i t  is
probably worth mentioning that the
Enhancer 2000 has its own built in, that
increases speed by  about 40%-50%.
This does mean that other utilities that
write t o  t h e  driv e R A M  w i l l  b e
negated.
Conclusion
For it  15, the Enhancer 2000 is a good
buy. The speed at  which the drive
works is good, and the styling and
reliability is as good as you can get. But
incompatibility with a lot (up to 60%)
of protected commercial software
must be taken into consideration (you
should also remember that the 1570/1
is also incompatible with a proportion
of commercial software), On the other
hand, if you are not going to be using
that much commercial software, then I
would recommend t his  peripheral
without reservation.

Collecting o
Golden Crown
Our original Repton game was immediately ac c laimed as a refreshingly new concept: a game requiring dexterity to complete its arcade-style
elements, and clear logical thinking to solve its strategic puzzles Repton involves retrieving treasure from cleverly-constructed traps of falling
rocks whilst avoiding the fearsome monsters and haunting spirits This is on astounding game reaching new heights in BBC arcade adventures,"
enthused the Micro User magazine.
Last Christmas saw the release of Repton 2, larger and much more challenging than before. Acorn User's Technical Editor Bruce Smith wrote:
"Repton 2 is better than anything I've played on the BBC Micro or Electron. Brilliant!"
Now, completely rewritten and improved for the Commodore, Amstrad, BBC Micro and Electron, we proudly present R'epton 3. For the ﬁrst time, a
screen-designer is included: try to devise screens that will perplex your friends, then see if you can solve their newly-designed screens. Another
Innovation is the character-designer which enables you to design your own monsters, rocks, eggs, spirits, diamonds ...any or all of the game's
characters can be redeﬁned as you wish.
Repton 3 Is much larger than its predecessors — it has 24 fascinating screens, and players who are skilful enough to complete them all can
enter our prize competition described below. All the favourite Repton characters have been retained, together with several new features: a
creeping poisonous fungus which grows at an alarming rate; time bombs and time capsules (for puzzles in the 4th dimension); and golden
crowns as well-deserved rewards for your endeavours. Can YOU complete Re !Dien 3?

MA C H IN E  CODE
Welcome to
the Machine
W
this your ﬁnal dose of machine code (do
I hear howls of despair?) in this series. I
want to ﬁnish off our encounter with
the 6510 by considering ﬂoating point
routines.
In an earlier part I described how
ﬂoating point values are stored in ﬁve
bytes. The resident Basic contains a
wide range of routines which allow you
Get to grips with the C64's mathematical routines.
By Allen Webb
to manipulate these numbers. The
question is, why would you want to use
ﬂoating point? If you want to write
games, you don't need them - ﬂoating
is too slow! I f  you want to  write
programs to  manipulate data, you
WILL need them.
Table 1 summarises some of the
ﬂoating point routines available.

accumulator 1 and FAC2 is ﬂoating
point accumulator 2 .  Where th e
routine involves a ﬂoating point value
in memory, the start address of the
value is held in the indicated registers.
Another important fu n cti o n
COMPARES FAC I to a value held in
memory. The address of the value is
held in Y/ACC and the entry point is
SBC5B. The accumulator returns a
value depending on the result of the
comparison:
ACC = 0...FAC1 = memory
ACC 1 ...FAC 1  > memory
ACC = SET. .FAC1 <  memory
LISTING 1 shows some example
routines using two values in memory
(NI and N2).
Lines 40 to 80 show how to load
FAC I with a value. Lines 90 to 160 add
two numbers. Lines 170 t o  230
multiply two numbers. Lines 240 to
280 extract the square root o f  a
number. Lines 330 to 350 simply print
FAC I on the screen to show that the
routines function correctly.
The ROMs also contain a number
of handy constants which are readily
accessible:

Lines 10 to 40 load FAC1 with a
random number and multiply it  by
100. FAC I therefore holds between zero
and 99. The remainder of LISTING 2
loads FACI with the value of PI.
From these examples you should
see that ﬂoating points operations
aren't that difﬁcult to use. They are, as
I've said before, very slow.
If y ou t r y  us ing t he random
number routine, you'll ﬁnd it's just as
MA C H IN E  CODE
slow in machine code as from Basic.
If you want to generate a random
number, there are better ways than by
using of ﬂoating point routines. First,
you can use the value held in  the
internal clock. This is ideal in Basic,
but at machine code speeds, it's no use.
The best source of random numbers is
the white noise generator in the sound
chip. Consider LISTING 3:
LISTING 3
10 LDA #
20 STA SID4OE
30 STA SD4OF
40 LDA $ 8 0
50 STA $D412
60 STA $13418
70 LDA $D41B
80 RTS
Lines 10 to 30 set the frequency to
the highest possible value. Line 50
selects white noise on voice 3, line 60
turns off the audio output of voice 3.
Line 70 extracts a random number
based o n  t h e  amplitude o f  t h e
waveform in voice 3. I ﬁnd this method
very effective and time independent.
Well that pretty well ﬁnished our
tour of the ROMs. I f  you look at a
decent disassembly of the ROMs, you
will ﬁnd many other useful routines
and will derive many hours of harmless
amusement.
You may have wondered why only
a fr ac tion o f  t h e  pos s ible 2 5 6
instructions are implemented on the
6510. I n  fact, it  appears that some
other codes do have a function. I must
warn you that these instructions are
unofﬁcial and I cannot guarantee that
the codes will function properly but
you can try dabbling with them.
First, there are a  collection o f
additional NOPs. Yo u  w ill already
know t h a t  N O P  i s  a  n o t h in g
instruction which can be used to leave
space in code or reﬁne timing loops.
There are in fact one byte, two byte
and three byte NOPs.
One Byte NOPs
The usual instruction used for NOP is
$EA. T h i s  ins tr uc tion i s  a l s o
performed b y  t h e  ins tr uc tions
SIA,S3A,S5A,S7A,SDA,SFA.
YOUR COMMODORE december 1986:39
Two Byte NOPs
This instruction is not only ignored but
also the following byte. The following
bytes perform this function, $80,804,
$14334,S44,S54,$64,S74,W4,S89.
Three Byte NOPs
This instruction is  ignored plus the
following t w o  bytes. T he relevant
instructions are, SOC,SIC,S3C,S5C,
SDC,SFC.
The value of these instructions are
that they are ignored by normal dis-
assemblers and are therefore useful if
you want to make your code difﬁcult
to decode. Let us consider a simple
example. LISTING 4 prints an asterisk
at the current cursor position:
I [STING 4
10 LDA # 82A
20 JSR SFTD2
30 RTS
Let us insert the bytes SO4 and 860
between lines 10 and 20.
LISTING 5
10 LDA # 82A
15 .BYTE $04,860
20 JSR W M 2
30 RTS
The $04 is a two byte NOP so that it
is ignored as is the $60 (RTS). This
means that the additional bytes are
ignored a n d  t h e  routine r uns  a s
required. I f  we try to disassemble this
code, however, we get the mess given in
LISTING 6:
I L I S TI NG  6
LDA #
r ?
RTS
,ISR SFFD2
RTS
If this is repeated at one or two
other places in the code, you can see
that the code would become rather
tough to decypher.

In TABLE 2, I've listed some other
instructions. T h e r e  a r e  o t h e r
instructions but I've tried to list the
most useful. The validity o f  these
instructions are uncertain since they
were derived from the 6502. I'm sure.
however, that you'll enjoy dabblinL
see if they work on your 64.

Remember. I cannot take respon-
sibility for any problems you may have
if you choose to use these codes. They
are really more of curiosity value than
anything else.
In this series I've tried to show that
there is no mystique to machine code.
On the contrary. if you've developed
tidy programming habits you should
ﬁnd it easy to use. The only nuisance is
that unlike high level languages,
machine code forces you to develop an
understanding of the hardware to get
the best results. But that isn't such a
bad thing, i s  it? Anyway, here's
wishing you many hours of successful
programming.

COMMODORE MUSIC SYNTHESIS PACKAGE
SOUND EXPANDER
This module, used via TV or external ampliﬁer, uses
FM chips which are signiﬁcantly more powerful than the
Commodore's SID chip. The eight available channels
produce extremely realistic sounds, allowing complex
chords and melody lines. Driven by pop-down menus,
the powerful sound facilities of the expander create a viable
composing tool.
5 OCTAVE KEYBOARD
Professionally-built with full-size keys to utilise the above
modules.
SOUND STUDIO
This powerful synthesis software contains a stored library of
60 sounds and the ability to create your own sounds via
screen menus. It also contains a multi-track recording
facility with powerful 6-track midi sequencer.
This package represents a breakthrough in computer-
controlled synthesis and compares in quality and
speciﬁcation with systems costing many times the price.

simple device. A  read only memory
(ROM) on a small board that brings
the connections of the ROM into an
edge connector and a simple plastic
case t h a t  provides a  convenient
housing to protect its contents and
make sure that the ROM is connected
to the computer the right way around.
The difﬁculty comes when manu-
facturing the cartridges. T o create a
masked ROM, you have to physically
build in the program at the time when
the c h i p  i s  a c t u a lly  m a d e  -
ecomonically unsound for  numbers
less t h a n  20000, a n d  w h o  c a n
guarantee sales of that number in this
competitive market? Also the cost of
manufacturing a  cartridge is  many
times the cost of duplicating a tape.
The o l d  ' u n s  amongs t u s  w i l l
remember t h e  i.30-180 f o r  V C S
cartridges 5-10 years ago. Commodore
solved their cost problem by  manu-
facturing their own clips - resulting in
around 1 1 0  f o r  a  Commodor e
cartridge. Nobody else could compete
and the cartridge games market as we
knew it collapsed for the moment (n.b.
Nintendo h a s  s o l d  8 0  M i l l i o n
cartridges for the Nintendo machine -
but that's another story...),
There is another way o f  making
cartridges, and another market to buy
them -  EPROMs and utilities, A n
EPROM is  similar t o  an ordinary
C64 REVIEW
Blow Your Own
Imagine being able to make your own cartridges for the
C64. Until now this has been a preserve of the
enthusiast. Now Sircal bring the advantages and
convenience of cartridges to the common man.

ROM and is functionally identical as
far as  the computer is  concerned.
However it can be programmed after
manufacture a n d  er as ed. T h e
programming and erasure isn't like a
normal read/write memory such as a
Random Access Memory, but must
use a special programmer and eraser.
The eraser will wipe the chip in about
20 minutes b y  s hining U V  lig h t
through a small window in the top of
it, Programming is accomplished by
plugging it into a programmer which
can ﬁll a chip in about 15 minutes.
This programming and erasure cycle
can be carried out about 100 times
before the chip 'wears out'. The chip
will retain its contents for about 100
years before it needs reminding (good
enough for most applications 1 think -
unless y o u  hav e s ome v aluable
Victorian software that's about t o
corrupt).
Utility cartridges are still available,
and if you look inside one of them you
wil see that they will usually contain
EPROMS. They arc usually utility
cartridges because utilities generally
have very small production runs, and
EPROMs are suitable for low volume
production.
BBC owners are very well versed
with EPROMs as the mac hine has
some spare sockets that they just lit
into. Commodore owners not so much
so. This is mainly due to having to ﬁnd

an EPRO M programmer (called a
blower), a n  e r a s e r  ( c a lle d  a
deprommer), a  s upply  o f  empty
cartridges, and some EPROMs, then
trying to ﬁnd all the necessary software
and the skill and information to use it.
A daunting task f o r  anybody not
completely skilled in the art.
Sircal has a new product aimed at
the inex per ienc ed ( a n d  m o r e
experienced) user in  the form o f  a
complete c ar tr idge c r eating k i t .
Comprising of a programmer that ﬁts
on to the user port of the Commodore
64, a stand alone (i.e. doesn't need to
plug into anything except the mains!)
deprommer, comprehensive driv er
software (in cartridge -  of  course!),
and a blank cartridge. The blank cart-
ridge is identical to a normal cartridge
except for one or two differences that
allow the EPRO M inside i t  t o  be
programmed without taking it  out,
and a small hole that lets the UV light
shine into it to wipe the cartridge when
its time is done.
Blank cartridges are a bit expensive
at 114 each, but after a while you could
always make your own as the chips are
only 12 a throw with the empty cart-
ridges a t  a b o u t  t h e  s ame. T h e
cartridges are also only 8K in size and
sit in the S8000-$A000 area in memory
reserved f o r  the use o f  external
cartridges whilst keeping Basic alive.
16K cartridges will be made available

if there is enough demand, these sit

need it.
The cartridge can be programmed
in two ways -  Basic or machine code.
The machine code method can be used
to make an auto-start cartridge - like a
Basic utility or a game. And all the
formatting and header codes are up to
you. The Basic method has all the
hard work done for you and will take a
Basic program and put i t  into the
cartridge where i t  can be instantly
recalled for later use. All the header
codes and the software needed to re-
load the program are written into the
cartridge by the operating software -
so you don't have to worry about a
thing,
The operating software is easy to
use, unambiguous, and well explained
in the short, but informative manual.
My only gripe is with the eraser.

With this you plug the cartridge into it
to erase and a small I,ED shows you
when the time is up for erasing (too
long reduces the life of the EPROM,
too s h o r t  a n d  i t  does n't erase
properly). My  gripe is that the join
between the eraser and the cartridge is
not very good and some of the light
leaks out, You may think that this is
not a l l  that important b u t  the
wavelengths that you need to erase an
EPROM can damage your eves. Sircal
say that they think it's safe, b u t _
There i s  a n  inter loc k  w h ic h
prevents y ou turning the erase o n
without the cartridge in place, but I
would have preferred something a
little better just for piece of mind.
Overall this is a great package for
creating cartridges for either your own
use or for limited distribution. For a
lone enthusiast though. I  w o u ld
recommend getting your own EPROM

use a standard EPROM and a normal
EPROM blower, just because of the
relatively high cost o f  this system.
However for  a multiple installation
such as a school or college. I think that
this system is excellent and I'm sure
that anyone with that type of instal-
lation could think up many ideas for
customised machines w it h  eas ily
changeable ROM software. The only
had points are the small size of the
cartridges -  8 K  is n't a  lo t  f o r  a

to change the mapping - so that it can
override t he operating system f o r
instance, like a lot of disk turbos do.
Otherwise a well thought out product.

delectation.
I
shoot-cm up type of game then this game makes a pleasant
change. Asterix takes you back over 2000 Years to the time
of the Romans and the Gauls.
Asterix is the Gauls' hero, or at least he will be if you help
him succeed in his task, Asterix with his friendsObelix has to
set out and ﬁnd seven pieces of a missing magic pot. The
village druid Getaﬁx needs this pot for making his magic
potion to help the Gauls stand against the Romans.
In this arcade adventure Asterix must wander around the
countryside battling against wild pigs and Romans. If the
boars are beaten they turn themselves into neat earn able
hams which are useful for keeping Obelix by your side.
You may ﬁnd it useful to map your route around the
playing area as several paths seem t o lead to the same
locations. Unfortunately the screens don't move as quick as
Asterix so there is quite a pause while the next screen is
drawn. Asterix simply hangs in limbo until the program
ﬁnishes drawing the screen, or perhaps this is when he nips
off to the gents.
When ﬁghting with Romans or the boars, a blown up
picture of yourself and your opponent appears on the screen.
This means that you can see exactly where you are hitting
your opponent, or more probably. where he is hitting you.
The action in the lighting sequence is very reminiscent of
one o f  the numerous boxing/kung fu etc. type games.
Asterix can punch. duck and kick. Even so it's tricky to
prevent him being clobbered over the head by a Roman's
staff.

Now Asterix isn't known for being a coward but I must
admit that the best strategy I found while playing was simply
to hit your opponent once and RUN.
Despite its excellent graphics, Asterix has limited lasting
interest. For a start all of the pieces of the cauldron appear in
the same place, once you've found where they all are and
you've mastered the lighting techniques you will ﬁnd the
game extremely dull.
Oh, and there's also a small bug, well quite a big one
really, that enables you to collect all the missing pieces of the
cauldron within a couple of minutes of starting the game. but
I'll leave you to ﬁnd Out what it is.
Superb graphics and music are let down by the actual
game, Still if  you remember the TV series and the comic
strips of Asterix then you may enjoy this game for a
while.

undiscovered by any of the other software houses. The thing
that distinguishes That Boxing from its more normally seen
counterpart, is tht not only is it fair game to hit your
opponent, you can also kick him. So imagine a fast and
furious boxing match with added violence.
Bouts normally take part in a boxing ring, but because
these are graphically boring, A nco has provided six different
backdrops o n  a  vaguely oriental theme, eac h o n e
representing an extra level of skill, Unless you own a 128,
these screens are loaded in two at a time so make sure that
you keep 'play' pressed on your cassette recorder. The high
score table can also be saved if you are particularly proud of
your achievements,
There are 12 different moves to be mastered. Normal
movement of the joystick will move you forward, backwards
or make you jump or crouch. Pressing the ﬁre button gives
access to a high and low punch. high, low, ﬂying and sweep
kicks as well as two defensive manoeuvres in which you can
protect your head or your body. The characters, although

fairly small, are well animal ed. A bout takes place over three
one minute rounds, although it can be less if one person runs
out of  energy. At  the end of each round, the players shift
position so that you can get a slightly different perspective.
There are the usual one or two player options.
There is nothing particularly outstanding about this
game but nothing dreadful either. Its appeal though is likely
to be limited to fans of combat simulations. G . R . H .

GODS AND HEROES
A
Hercules, a ﬁendishly difﬁcult platform game. The main
arguments levelled against it  by those who (for reasons
unknown) didn't like it, were that all too often, you had to
leap into the unknown hoping that a platform would myster-
iously appear underneath you at the crucial moment. They
thought that there was too much trial and error involved as
you frequently had no time at all to think. Well, Alpha
Omega has just released the sequel called Gods and Heroes
and it is every bit as good a game as the original with the
added bonus that you can now see a lot more on the screen to
help you plan your route through each of the 50 chambers. It
is still, however. ﬁendishly difﬁcult.
Continuing the classical theme, the Gods are playing
games with the Greek Superheroes. All those tasks of men
like Jason and Hercules were no more than assault courses
designed to amuse the inhabitants of Olympus. To see how
you would fare on the Ancient Greek equivalent of the
Krypton Factor. you are invited to try your hand at solving
the 50 puzzles that have been set before you.
The object of each screen is to reach a speciﬁc item — a
club, sword or  an axe are typical examples. There are
platforms to be leapt on to, mythological monsters to be
avoided and ropes t o  be swung from but be warned.

names as soon as you step on them. Ropes crumble at your
touch plunging you to your doom. And there are other
problems as well. All the superstructures may be a red
herring designed to lose you lives. A platform that is initially
invisible may lead directly to your desired object. You may
have to construct extra platforms out of building blocks.
As well as eight different speed levels to choose from and
one or two player options, you can also select which of the 50
screens you want to start from. This is an excellent idea as
there are many screens when you know what you want to do
but are unable to ﬁnd a way of doing it. There is nothing
worse than being stuck on screen two knowing that there are
another 48 as yet unseen. The graphics are not the best in the
world but still inﬁnitely better than the original. The balance
between puzzle solving and action is just right and there is a
constant feeling of just one more screen. All in all, a great
little game, especially for the price.

SINBAD
s Sinbad, you the hero must break out of your dungeon,
A
recover your treasures and do battle with various nasties,
until eventually you meet the vile and evil Sultan, who
caused you all this grief in the ﬁrst place.
On t h e  surface this  apears t o  b e  jus t another
platform/blast everything that moves ty pe o f  game.
However, underneath lies a very difﬁcult game to master.
The game is played over live scenarios, each one needing a
password to gain access to it. (Except scenario one and
scenario ﬁve, which is a continuation of four). This feature I
liked. There's nothing worse than, after successfully getting
past one difﬁcult screen, you have to do it all again should
you die off. Each level has its own particular degree of
difﬁculty
At the start of the game, you have to break out of your
dungeon by unlocking two doors with two keys that ypti
obtain. To obtain a key you need to collect eight of your

conﬁscated treasures. There is  no limit t o  amount o f
treasures that you can carry, but you are only allowed to
carry one key at a time. To hinder you in your task are birds
(particularly nasty), snakes and Sinbad lookalikes. I f  this
wasn't enough. There are numerous pulsating walls t o
navigate. These need split second timing and nimble ﬁngers
on the joystick.
Scene two is a straight forward platform scene. (Straight
forward did I say?) You have to kill off a certain number of
the guards who appear from behind the doors, using a sword
which you have miraculously obtained. One hit proves fatal
for these guards, whilst you on the other hand can sustain up
to four hits before you die. You can recover your lost energy
by collecting a golden chalice, these appear at random.
However, one guard is a very nasty fellow, one touch from
him means instant death for you, and the recovery of a
couple of dead guards.
Scene three is perhaps the easiest scene of all, but by no
means a walkover. The object here is to guide ﬁve of your
camels safely across the desert whilst ﬁghting off all sorts of
evil ﬂying things. Shooting your own camel will speed him
up, but should he be hit by anything else, then watch that
timer drop. When ﬁring missiles remember that all the time
you have your ﬁnger on the ﬁre button, you can guide your
bolt to its target. To compensate for this though, you are
restricted to the bottom 10 lines of the screen. So accuracy is
vital.
Scenes four and ﬁve make up one scenario. On four, you
have to shoot down the ever-present ﬂying carpets and roc
birds. The guards on the carpets take one hit, whilst the birds
take three — beware of falling bodies! After a certain number
have been disposed of enter the Sultan. Being a nasty type, he
transforms himself into a ﬁre breathing dragon and shoots
deadly ﬁrebolts at you.

One thing that I must mention. On all the scenes, you not
only have the nasties hindering your progress, you also have
a timer counting down from 999. (This moves very rapidly,
so don't hang around deciding what to do, time is short.
Overall, I  liked this game tremendously. Some of the
screens seem almost impossible to complete within the given
time. But this is the challenge. The graphics are nicely
presented, and the music, although not in the Rob Hubbard-
Ben Dalglish vein, is pleasant to listen to.
One small criticism is the fact that disk users cannot save
out high scores.

always remains constant. There are a few producers o f
software that are consistently good. One of these companies
is Denton Designs, which is behind Dante's Inferno, so I was
t
enough, in a few seconds came the familiar superb loading
picture.
When the program did eventually start, I thought to
myself, " O h no, not another Robin o f  the Wood type
Ciraphic Adventure!" Undaunted, I carried on and to my
Pleasant surpise I'm glad I did. True, it is in the R of W style.
the same type and quality o f  graphics, but there the
similarity ends. For this program is cunningly difﬁcult to
master.
For a start, you need to make decisions quickly and
accurately. The main objective is to pass through the various
realms o f  hell until you come face to face with Lucifer
himself. Aiding and abetting you, or hindering you as the
case may be, is a large assortment of nasty evil creatures.
Your job is to ﬁnd objects with which you can bribe these
creatures.
The manipulation and use of the objects takes some time
to control. Practice whilst still in Limbo. (The ﬁrst screen) on
how to use and manipulate them is advisable. Telling you
how to use them would spoil the fun of  ﬁnding out for
yourself. Be prepared to die often at the start, this is very
frustrating, but don't let this put you off. Once you have
mastered the ﬁrst few screens you will agree that it was worth
persevering with it.
Knowing a little of the story of Dante will u
 help you ﬁnish this game.
The playing area is quite large and very well presented.
The problems are not easy to solve, but a little intelligent
thought will clear the mists for you. There are a total of nine
realms for you to pass through before you meet the man
himself. Good luck to you. And as they say in all good
westerns, I'll see you in Hell.

GO FOR GOLD
M
long time now and Go for Gold is no exception. Originally
released as Hesgames a couple of years ago, it got very little
attention which is a pity because it is one of the best games of
its type ever released. And to be able to buy it for less than
three pounds has got to be one of the bargains of the year.
Up to six players can compete against one another with
each one getting to select the colour of his or her kit. There
are six events to compete in -  a complete mixture of skills
being required if you are going to win the big G. Your ﬁrst
chance to make a splash is quite literally that, springboard
diving. You must time the jumping up and down on the
board for maximum effect as well as deciding when to come
out of your dive and whether or not you are going to dive
forwards or backwards. If you are feeling especially clever,
you can nominate the dive that you are going to perform
(unike us lesser mortals who just jump and see what
happens) and score an extra 10%.
The 100m sprint and I 10m hurdles are two very similar
events. The former involves you waggling the joystick from
Left to right as fast as you can whilst the latter is the same with
added extra that your joystick should be to the right when
you reach a hurdle or else you trip up and get slowed down.
The program is equipped to watch out for false starts so you
can't cheat as you go for the record.
Hand and eye co-ordination are required if you are to be
on target for the next event - archery, Six arrows at four
targets of varying distances. You must take wind speed and
direction into account and should also try to shoot quickly
for the longer you delay, the more tired your arms get and
the harder it is to aim properly.
Speed and timing are the essential elements o f  a
successful long jump. You must run as fast as you can
towards the board and then time your leap at just the right
moment. Even then you can't relax as you must react in time
to throw yourself forward on landing in order to gain those
precious extra inches.
The ﬁnal event is weight lifting which is divided into two
sections. the snatch and clean and jerk. The power for lifting
comes from the thighs and timing is crucial if you are going
to get those huge weights above your head. Everything is
carefully controlled from your joystick and you get some
idea of what's involved for the clean and jerk with these

movements, all of which must be timed to perfection. Down,
up. down, pause, up, pause, down, up, down (very fast),
pause. up. This sequence brings the bar up on to your chest
and then powers it upwards as you drop down on to one knee
before ﬁnally standing upright. Well, that's the theory,
One of the nice things about Go for Gold is the little
touches. As you increase the weights, so vou see the larger
weights going on the bar. There is a real feeling of your hands
shaking in the archery and the Russian judge in the diving is
shortsighted and prefers it if you land in front of him. He is
also supposed to be biased if you wear red! You can even get
action replays of all the events except archery and so watch
your spectacular belly ﬂop over and over again.
This is far and away the best game released under the
Americana title so far, From someone whose only exercise is
winding his watch up in the morning, all I can do is suggest
that you go and get a copy today.

As in all platform games vou have to collect the odd item
or two to help you on your travels, whilst disposing of any
nasty creatures that may come your way. OK, so at times.
you as Conan may look like blob of white scrambling up
your ladders. The odd cloud or two may jerk its way across
the screen. The odd hidden character may show through the
sprites and scenery, but for all that, this program is enjoyable
to play.
The main objective is to ﬁnd a little green headed man
called Volta and dispose of him. Throughout your task, you
are helped by a nice little bird that will at times bless you with
an extra life. To  dispose of the nasties you wield your

magical sword and throw it with all your might. Having
succeeded in this, you then catch your sword as it hurtles
back into your hands.
The feature which attracted me to this particular game,
was that not all the screens were cluttered with platform after
platform. The playing areas are quite barren in some scenes
The joy and skill, is in ﬁnding the correct paths to follow. To
this end you are aided by a large ﬂashing arrow showing you
where you should end up. (Getting there is the fun). Some of
the routes you have to take are quite novel in their approach.
I cannot really say why, but for some reason this game
had me going back to it time and time again. One point
which many people may ﬁnd disconcerting is that each
screen is loaded in separately from the disk. However, the
load is a fairly quick load, so it should not detract too much
from the overall enjoyment.

Personally, I prefer the computer version as it adds a few
extra features to the board game. For a start a little character
called TP does all the work for you, including throwing a
dart at the numbered board so that you don't have to roll a
dice. You also have the added dimensions of visual and
musical questions. (A point worth bearing in mind is that if
you don't have any sound from your computer then you will
not be able to hear any of the musical questions.)
Unfortunately, the music produced isn't all that clear
and you have to listen very carefully to it. I'm sure that with a
little more effort the sound could have been improved
dramatically.
REVIEWS
The playing area is set up exactly the same as the board
game, see the screen shot. The idea is to move around the
board answering the questions on the relevant subject. Your
go continues until you fail to answer a question correctly.
The large sections at the end of the spokes earn S
in the category's colour if you get the question correct, Once
your piece is full then its back to the centre where the other
players pick the subject for you, answer this correctly and
you win the game.
Provided with the game is an extra set of questions, this
spare set can be used on any computer that is running Trivial
Pursuit and more sets will be available at a later date.
If you wish to speedup the game then you can make TP
redundant, he doesn't get too upset. This speeds up t he game
since TP normaly 'squeaks' out the questions to you quite
slowly, turn him off and they apear extremely quickly.
One extremely interesting feature of this game is the
ability to have a break down of the questions that you have
answered. This tells you which subject you favour, which
ones you excel at and more to the point the ones that you
haven't a clue about.
A time limit can be set in which the questions must be
answered, The maximum time allowed is nine minutes so
you don't have to wait until your Uncle Fred grovels in the
depths of his brain to ﬁnd something he read about in 1945.
What makes a great change for this type of trivia game is
the fact that you don't have to be good at spelling and type
the answers in as the computer expects them. You simply
have to tell everyone your answer, press the ﬁre button on
the joystick and the correct answer will appear so that you
can compare.
One feature that is missing from the game is a SAVE
GAME option. This would be extremely useful as games can
go on for many hours and it isn't always possible to play
through the night.
Some of you may spend a happy fortnight going round
and round the board getting nowhere fast but it is great fun
ﬁnding out what you don't know. Anyway it's far less
energetic than outdoor pursuits.

vandals break in and start scattering litter all over the place.
As there are no employees present, the owner has no option
but to  hire two cowboy contract cleaners -  Otto and
Bobban.
Bribed with the promise of large amounts of money, they
go in armed with brooms, guns (for shooting the radioactive
vandals!) and smart bombs. Your objective is to sweep up
the various bits of rubbish before the vandals can put them
back. Succeed and it is on to the next one of eight different

Clean Up Time can be played as either a one or two player
game. I f  you select the two player option, then you can
decide to play either as a team or competitors. As you score
bonus points for  killing the other person, it is not too
difﬁcult to see what more people will do. claiming that it was
an accident. The problem with this is that at the start of each
level, the two cleaners come out of their respective rooms at
the top of the screen which just happen to be right next to
each other so that one player can put a bullet in the other's
back before he even blinks.
This is a simple game to play with not too much to
recommend it but with nothing too bad about it either.

had things and get away with it. This game lets you do just
that.
As Jack, you are let loose upon an unsuspecting public
and you cause havoc wherever you go. The more havoc you
can create, the more your rating goes up.
The basic idea is that you go around the town and pick up
objects that will assist you in your dirty deeds. Having secure
an object, you then have to decide in what way it can be best
used. This aspect o f  the game brings all your skills as a
Dennis the Mennis into play. Use an object in one place, and
your Naughtyometer will hardly budge, but used in the best
place -  up it goes.
Movement is by the standard left/right and ﬁre button
space. To pick an object up - you may carry only two - you
press the one or two key accordingly. (That is to say if you
press the two key ﬁrst, then the object you pick up is placed
into pocket two. T o use it you press two again.) To go
through a door, you press Retuin.
Exploring the town can be quite funny, as usual though,
you have to avoid anything else that moves. Coming into
contact with any moving object gets you spanked. After a
certain number of spankings you loose one life.

exception. The adrenalin builds up as you get further and
further into the battle. Unfortunately, Aftermath could not
even get me slightly excited.
The main object of the game is to ﬁght your way through
wave after wave of alien craft until you reach the enemy's
stronghold. Having reached this far, one strategically placed
bomb makes you the master.
I have to be honest though and admit that I did not get
this far into the game. The main reason being that I turned
off my machine. The playing area consists of a continously
dowward scrolling patch o f  greenery, dotted with grey
square to represent the buildings of the enemy.
Having got past the ﬁrst wave, you immediately get the
second one and so on and so on. Unless you miss the slight
pause between each wave, you would not know that you had
successsfully negotiated the previous one.
To add to all the excitement, you have a continuous
ﬂicker on screen where the interrupt occurs, this somewhat
detracts your attention from the job at hand.
I do not normally criticise a program in such a strong
way (I always think of the hard work and effort that the
programmer puts in )  but i n  my  opinion, and please
remember, this is only MY opinion, this game is a very poor
Black-Hawk.

TWO ON TWO
A
Two is a one or two player basketball simulation in which
you play either singly or as a team against the computer or as
opponents with the computer controlling one player on each
side.
Before you actually start playing, there are a huge
number of options ranging from practice mode to choosing
the abilities of your player (dribbling and jumping skills,
shooting accuracy etc). You can choose to play in a one off
exhibition match or take place in a league.
The game itself is divided into four quarters. First one
side attacks and then the other. Although you can steal the
bail, you have to wait for the other part of the pitch to be
drawn before proceeding so that there are no quick break-
aways. Success in the game depends on your shooting and
passing abilities. A quick press of the joystick throws the ball
to your team-mate or asks him to do the same to you whilst a
longer press makes your man jump and you should aim to
release the ball towards the basket right at the top of' the leap.
Your computer controlled team-mate plays a semi-
intelligent sort of game, trying to ﬁnd space and scoring
opportunities as he sees ﬁt, but he doesn't always do what
you think he ought to. If this is really annoying you, you can
start to call the plays and tell your man to patrol a speciﬁed
zone on the court.
The animation of the players is well done although the
rest of the graphics are nothing special. The main problem
with the game is that basketball is very much a minority
sport over here and with the game being fairly expensive and
disk only, is likely to remain that way. For true fans only.

girlfriends. One such person is Al 'Dutch Meat' Bluntz. Al
was just a plain, ordinary former interplanetary sportsman
and bartender until the day that Manic Monk kidnapped his
loved one. MM is the greatest criminal brain in the whole
universe and he has taken the voluptuous Jane to a part of
the galaxy unknown to the rest of mankind - New Almere.
Big Al decides to go and rescue her and so hi-jacks a space
shuttle in order to get himself to the outskirts of MM's nerve
centre.
The ﬁrst thing to say about the game is that it is huge -a
massive arcade adventure cum platform game cum strategy
game set over 2000 screens. You only get some idea of how
big it is when you log on to one of the terminals giving you
access to a map of the area full of weird and wonderful
structures to  be explored. Correct use o f terminals is
essential if you are to rescue your young lady and there are 10
different sorts for you to log on. These range from ordinary
viewers to teleport systems. There are various two and four-
way switches to be manipulated and top up stations for your
strength, energy and fuel supplies. The most important
though are the heart terminals. These open previously
locked doors which allow access towards the huge heart
where MM has made a love nest for the unwilling Jane.
There are 14 hearts to be deactivated as well as some duds.
Al starts off in his space ship and his ﬁrst problem is
getting out. There are only three rooms but they are full of
assorted nasties and energy barriers to  be overcome.
Naturally, Al has taken the trouble to arm himself and has
three different weapon systems available. The energy shield
forms a barrier all round our intrepid hero, killing all that it
touches but i t does require considerable amounts o f -
surprise, surprise -  energy. Your laser is a more effective
distance weapon but gulps fuel. Finally, there is the good old
fashioned Karate kick which again uses energy and can only
be used when you are running. Personal damage reduces

strength but all three of these levels can be topped up at the
appropriate terminal.
Once you have worked out how to escape from your
capsule, it is necessary to switch into ﬂying mode in order to
explore the vast regions o f  space. All changing between
transport and weapon modes is done by selecting the correct
icon via the function keys. A teleport terminal is a useful ﬁrst
one to ﬁnd as it saves you both time and trouble as you ﬂy
through space. You cannot (deport directly into another
building but there are many convenient platforms for you to
land on. A word of warning. It is necessary to switch back
into walking mode before you use a terminal. Remember to
start ﬂying again before you walk off the platform or else
you will ﬁnd yourself vapourised before you can say Alpha
Centaurii.
Hopeless is a highly original game and one that, unusual
for a game on such a large scale, is both playable and
addictive. Well worth keeping an eye open for.

HACKER II
A
original Hacker, the Government of the USA now looks on
you as being some sort of specialist in the ﬁeld. One day
whilst quietly perusing the Activision Bulletin Board, your
activities are interrupted by an on screen message from the
CIA. This invites you to go off in search of the Doomsday
Papers which are reported to be hidden in a secret Siberian
base_ The contents of these papers if released, would end
Western civilisation as we know it.
REVIEWS
As might be expected, the papers are protected by a
complex security screen and you will have to penetrate it if
you want to get away with your mission. The defences
consist of a series of cameras and guards and to Outwit them,
you have a  device known as Multi-function Switching
Matrix. This is a combination of four screens which can be
tuned in to monitor some of the 38 cameras. This is coupled
with a video from which you can record various bits and then
use the tapes t o  bypass a  speciﬁc camera w ith y our
recording. This requires some considerable editing skills as
everything has to be perfectly synchronised.
You also start off with three Mobile Remote Units which
you will use to actually get the papers when you ﬁnd them
providing you can avoid the Annihilator - a little beast that
the Russians can call upon with the sole objective o f
destroying the MRUs.
The presentation of Hacker II is phenomenal and you
can spend hours just playing with your machine, tuning in
your monitors and switching from screen to screen. The
instructions come in the form of an operating manual which
is somewhat verbose and requires considerable study. I have
considerable reservations about the game itself though. I
suspect that it will be the sort of title that you show to your
friends in order to demonstrate how clever you and the
machine are, but will seldom go back and actually play.

NOW GAMES 3
YOUR COMMoDORE december 1986:56
C
Now Gaines 3 follows in the style of Now That's What I Call
Music pop records -  in other words, an assortment of last
year's hit titles. There are ﬁve games included on the tape
and they range from sporting simulations to strategy games
to arcade adventures.
First off the tee is Nick Faldo Plays the Open which as
you might guess, is a golf simulation. The course is the Royal
St Georges at Sandwich and you must select club, power and
direction of shot. The game is entirely icon driven and there
are added features such as the caddy questioning your choice
if he thinks that you are wildly out in the club that you pick.
Not a bad golf game but suffers in comparison to recent
releases such as Leaderboard and Golf Construction set.
Sorcery is an arcade adventure in which you play a
wizard trying to defeat the forces of evil. As you ﬂy around
the various locations, so you ﬁnd objects which must be
manipulated correctly in order to allow access to other areas
of the game. Collisions with monsters deplete your energy
and you must also complete your task of placing a speciﬁc
item on the altar at Stonehenge before your time limit
expires.

Code Name Mat II sees you as Captain of Centurion II
trying to protect the energy rich satellites of the Planet Vesta.
Your ship is  equipped with various scanners, weapon
systems and warp drives and you must decide how best to
deploy your forces as you attempt to destroy the invading
ﬂeet of Myon craft. An interesting mix of strategy, ﬂight
simulation and combat action.
The ﬁnal program on side one of the tape is another
arcade adventure Everyone's a Wally starring Wally Week
and th'e rest of his family. Your objective is to collect the
assorted parts of the code that let you into the safe and so pay
your wages. Different members of the family have different
abilities and you need to swap between them as you explore
the somewhat unusual town where they live. All this whilst
avoiding tripping over the baby and other assorted hazards.
There is only one game on side two but it is in three
separate parts. A View to a Kill is an arcade adventure based
on the James Bond ﬁlm of the same name. Part one involves
a car chase round Paris and is shown as a 3-D maze together
with a plan view of your surroundings. The second part sees
our hero and his lady friend attempt to escape from a
burning building in San Francisco, collecting such useful
items as a geiger counter en route. This is used in the ﬁnal
part in which James has to defuse the nuclear bomb hidden
deep within a mine another  maze. You can only enter parts
2 and 3 when you earn a code from part I but this shouldn't
prove to be too difﬁcult. A disappointing attempt at what
could have been a very good game.
There is nothing outstanding in this package which
makes you think that you ought to buy the tape straight
away but none of the games are really bad either. Probably
only worth considering if you don't already own any of the
titles. I f  you have seen one or two before, then there are
plenty of Other collections to consider.

PUB GAMES
YOUR COMMODORE december 1986:57
A
Pub Games lets you keep your hand in when the Dog and
Duck is closed or allows the kids to see what they have been
missing before they are old enough to sample the dubious
delights o f  the aforementioned hostelry. Seven different
events are included for you to make a fool o f  yourself
although, as if you do succeed in knocking over the black
mushroom every time you step up to the bar billiards table,
everyone will just assume that the landlord hasn't been
watering the best bitter quite as much as usual.
Darts is the most popular pub game and is ﬁrst to appear
on the tape. Usual, rules, straight in, double out. Your hand
wobbles fairly violently as you aim your arrow so it is not too
easy to keep getting the high scores. The wire around the
treble 20 also seems to have been strengthened considerably
and unless your shot is dead on, your dart bounces to the
ﬂoor off the wire. However, if you do manage to score a
maximum, then there is a recognisable version of a drunken
"180".
Bar billiards is played over a set period of time with the
objective being to pot balls billards fashion whilst avoiding
knocking o v e r  t hr ee strategically plac ed w ooden
mushrooms. You must select the angle, power and spin of
your shot. The table is superbly depicted as shown from
where you would actually stand if you were playing and the
only problem is a bit of dodgy bouncing when several balls
collide at the top of the table.
Dominoes is a well presented version of the game, the
main problems being that you can see what your opponent is
holding if, like me, you are unscupulous. It is also easy to
lose track of both ends of the chain if you are not careful so
that you need to remember what doms are on the table, •
Table football is the best of three games with nine balls
per game. The computer selects which ever rod the ball is
nearest and all you have to do is move up and down on the
rod to position your men and move backwards and forwards
to kick. Great fun this.
The two card games are a bit naff. Pontoon is a straight-
forward buy, twist and stick version. You start off with E. 10
and play for 10 consecutive hands or until your money runs

out. The version o f  poker though would make the
Cincinnatti Kid turn in his grave though. Ten hands are dealt
in succession and you get one chance to replace as many
cards as you want in an attempt to improve your hand. There
is no betting per se apart from an initial ante and money is
paid out according to ﬁxed odds on what hand you hold
although these are well below what they should be (out by a
factor of thousands in some cases!)
The ﬁnal game is skittles. Two targets move across the
screen at different speeds, the one at the front representing
your hand and the one at the back being where you are
aiming. Press the button and the ball travels in a straight line
between the two, hopefully knocking down a few skittles en
route.
Pub Games is not a bad collection of events. There are a
few quirks such as player one sometimes using joystick one
and sometimes joystick two which is a triﬂe annoying when
you ﬁnd all your pints (sorry points!) going to your
opponent's total. Also, although you can practise on your
own, you really need someone else to play against. Person-
ally, I prefer the real thing, watered pints and all,

head into the ofﬁce, Deactivators is certainly one of these
and offers every games player a challenge.
The Deactivators are in control of an ofﬁce complex and
have been given the job of defusing a number of bombs that
someone has kindly left lying around the complex.
REVIEWS
YOUR COMMODORE december 1986:58
Simple you might think, wander around the buildings
ﬁnd the bombs and get rid of them. Well you'd be wrong.
Firstly you can't get all of the bombs out of the ofﬁce block
since some of the transporters, it's a very modern ofﬁce,
don't work. Plus there are of course the nasties out to stop
you.
The game has ﬁve different ofﬁce buildings of different
complexities. You start off in a four by four building that is
obviously very easy to ﬁnd your way around. The droids that
are given the job of cleaning out this setup can only move
around limited areas within the rooms, The playing area
shows you the droid that you are currently controlling and
the room next door. The playing area is actually shown in
3D. The droids actually change in size as they move towards
the back or front of the room which is an extremely nice
touch.
Moving around and between the rooms is simply a
matter of going through doorways dropping through holes
in ﬂoors, up and down ﬁremans poles and via matter
transporters.
The ﬁrst level should really be treated as a practice one,
The simple four by four layout giving you a taste of what is to
come. As an example of the type of problem that you have to
overcome consider the plight of the droid whose nearest
transporter will not work and is stuck within only two rooms
with a bomb to keep him company. One of the other droids
must ﬁnd a circuit board that is missing from the computer
console, insert it in its proper case so that the original druid
can get rid of a bomb. Simple isn't it?
Once you get on to the later levels the fun really starts. I
forgot to tell you earlier that the ofﬁce complex has been
open to some experimentation in gravity. This means that
some o f the rooms totally ignore the normal effects o f
Newton's discovery, You may ﬁnd that the ﬂoor has
suddenly become the ceiling or the wall has suddenly become
the ﬂoor. This can get you really confused when you are
trying to control a droid.
Usually only one droid has access to the building's outer
door where the bombs must be detonated. This means that
you have a certain amount of switching between droids. For
example one droid may get hold of a bomb, he may then
have to throw it through an open window, only to be caught
by a droid in the next room, who must then rush to the
outside door and get rid of it. This is no problem on the ﬁrst
room but certainly presents further problems later on in the
game.
As mentioned, the programmers have included some
nice graphics effect s, especially the 3D mentioned earlier.
However, colour has been used very little in the game and
tends to give you a feeling of emptiness as though nothing is
happening. This however isn't the case as the game is fast
and furious and doesn't leave you a second spare.
An excellent game which is refreshingly different. Even if
it is a little difﬁcult to play at ﬁrst.

The Manager of Everton
Howard Kendall says...
This must be the ultimate
of all strategy games... Excellent
OUT NOW._ O U T  NOW._ O U T  N OW.-
Pit your wits and skills against 65 other teams which have their own
Transfers, Finances, Injuries etc., involving OVER 1050 PLAYERS
all with their individual skill levels of Passing, Tackling, Kicking etc.
All results are achieved by 22 players using Art iﬁc ial Intelligence
with 'live action' graphics and player commentary from any of the
three division ﬁxtures
YOUR TASK IS TO...
Manage a given 3rd Division team and succeed by either Promotion
or interesting larger Clubs with your expertise in winning the League
Championship or better still THE DOUBLE. Careful programming
has eliminated luck so you will need astuteness and a Managerial
mind to organise Administration, Staff & Players, Wages &Transfers
(not easy we promise), Crowd Control, Policing, Scouts, Finance,
Gates, Injuries and Physiotherapy. At your disposal are print-outs,
individual player reports, visits to League Grounds, Fixtures, Results
and current League Tables of ALL THREE DIVISIONS.
To survive you will have to be good t o  impress other clubs you
will have to be very good t o  succeed you will have to be excellent.
But will you achieve the ultimate of 'THE DOUBLE'???
HOWARD KENDALL did not achieve success in 5 minutes neither
will you!
COMPETITION, COMPETITION...
If you can be the FIRST to achieve THE DOUBLE you will WIN A
DAY OUT in style at EVERTON EC., for a ﬁxture of your choice
and meet HOWARD KENDALL.

STATESIDE NEWS
America, birthplace of Commodore machines, is still
.
correspondent brings you the latest from over there.
By Lewis Tilley
Party time everybody! Party time!
This is  the familiar cry during the
holiday season in the States. From the
humblest room in a school dormitory
to the swank penthouse ofﬁces of the
advertising agencies in the big towns,
this invitation to fun and games is
heard. T his  column is  devoted t o
helping you have the best of all times in
this s e a s o n .  
A
 f u l l  p a g e
advertisement i n  a  f a v o u r i t e
Commodore magazine gets us off to
the r ight start w ith a  bright read
heading: C E L E B R A T E  E V E R Y
OCCASION W I T H  YO U R  C O M-
PUTER!, it reads. The ad continues
"you've no idea just how much fun
your computer can be!", and invites
you to a party software line with Card-
ware ($9.95 ), Partyware (I:14.95),
Heartware ($9.95) and, so help me,
Warewithall ($14.95). The last 'pun ﬂy'
named pr oduc t does n't ac tually
include software but supplies you with
all the colourfully designed paper,
envelopes, stickers, markers, dis k
labels and a disk on to which you print
the other disks. They are all offered by
Hi-Tech Expansions Inc. What hath
Printshop wrought?
Now that you have an invitiation to
a party in the US, it's time to look at
the culture. Join me in some of the
different versions o f  American foot-
ball to which you were introduced in
the ﬂesh last summer.
World's Greatest Football by Epyx has
scrolling playing ﬁelds and tricky
windows and icons and costs $35.
Epyx also does World's Greatest Base-
ball which isn't quite up to the stand-
ard of the football game.
On-Field Football, $29•95 b y
Gamestar, uses only six men on a team
and might get neophyte fans confused
about the real games, Gamestar's On-
Court Tennis, also $29.95, seems to
give a more realistic version of that
game with 3D, shadows, foreshorten-
ing and good joystick controls.
Super Bowl Sunday ($35) from the
Avon Hill Game Company, is a total
control simulation which uses the two
football conferences, AF L/N F L, in
games based o n statistics o f  Super
Bowls in the past. This game as been
called " t h e  outstanding statistical
replay football program in the com-
puter ﬁeld".
There has been an Expansion Disk
1 previously issued which covered the
1984-85 National Football League
season. For this Christmas we have the
Expansion Disk 2 which digs into the
past for more super teams. Would you
believe Detroit-Cleveland 1953? I can
barely remember it. The expansion
disks are only $20 each.
Had enough American football?
Epyx follows Summer Games I and II
and Winter Games with World Games.
You tr av el ar ound t h e  globe t o
compete in eight different events. Or
with another Epyx title you could stay
in one squared circle and wrestle all by
yourself or with a friend andyour joy-
sticks. I n  Championship Wrestling
there ar e 2 0  holds  plus  overhead
graphics. For bike racers there is also
the new Super Cycle from Epyx,
Leader Board has been one of the
outstanding computer sports present-
ations for the American market (and
now it has also met with success in the
UK). I t  is the sound and the swing
which makes the golf game so satisfy-
ing. One feels that they have actually
grooved a club like a master.
Leader Boards's publisher, Access
software Inc., is issuing 10th Frame,
"the professional bowling simulator"
by the same authors, Bruce and Roger
Carver, for the Christmas trade. Both
of these games cost a whopping $3995
here in the US. I  bought my Leader
Board on a legit non-pirated magazine
disk in Italy for 13 Lira (about $10). Of
course there was the other $800 for the
ﬂight, you can't win.
A recent reconstruction in Japan of
the interior of 22IB Baker Street was
modelled o n one that was done in
London at the time of the last coron-
ation. This boardgame adaption of the
same name doesn't give you the feeling
of being with Holmes in his own digs
but it does challenge you with 30 cases
of the old Sleuth in Victorian London.
Thirty more cases are being prepared
for future issue by  Intellicreations/
Datasoft.
Electronics Ar ts  is  trying some-
thing new with Scavenger Hunt. In an
attempt to involve the whole family in
computer games, Scavenger Hunt uses
a 64, a gameboard and a pack of cards.
There's also another package called
urder P a r t y  w h i c h  s upplies
invitations, c lues  a n d  differently
computed answers f o r  every party
time.
I c an't let y ou leave my  party
without sending you on to another one
so I've saved the spicy one till last.
leather Goddesses of Phobos (shortly
to be available i n  the U K .  I  a m
informed) i s  f r o m  Infoc om a n d
features leather clad women who want
to turn earth into a sex scene for them-
selves. Cheap thrills from a computer,
a rather dubious sales ploy , I ' m
inclined to believe.
To conclude, L  think  that I'v e
included something for  everyone in
every sense so all that remains is to
wish you a Merry Christmas and a
I lappy New Year,
YOUR COMMODORE december 1986:67

listings are free of those horrible little
black blobs which send you searching
around the keyboard for  a suitable
graphic symbol. You may also have
noticed the funny numbers by the side
of each line of the listing. Fret no more,
it's all part of our easy entry aid.
Instead of those nasty graphics and
rows o f  countless spaces in PRINT
statements and strings we use a special
coding s y s tem. T h e  c o d e ,  o r
mnemonic, is  always contained i n
square brackets and you'll soon learn
to decipher their meanings.
For example, [SA] would mean
type in a Shifted A, or an ace of spades
in layman's terms, and [SA10] would
mean a row of ten of these symbols,
[S+2] means hold down the shift
key and press the plus key twice. I t
doesn't take a great leap of logic to
realise that [C-1-2] means exactly the
same thing except that the Commo-
dore key (bottom left of the keyboard)
is held down instead of the shift key.
If more than two spaces appear in a
statement then this will be printed as
[SPCLI] or , exceptionally, ISSPC41.
Translated into English this means
press the spacebar four times or in the
latter case hold the shift key down
while you do it.
A string of special characters could
appear as:
[CTRL N ,  DOWN2,LEFT5,BLUE,
F3,C3]
This would be achieved by holding
Easy Entry C64 111
CUD
Listings

for the C64.
down the CTRL key as you press N,
press the cursor key down twice, the
cursor left key ﬁve times, press the key
marked BLUE while holding down the
CTRL key, press the F 3 key and,
ﬁnally hold the Commodore key down
while pressing the number two key (C2
would of  course make the computer
print in brown).
Always remember that you should
only have a row of graphics characters
on your screen with no square brackets
and no commas, unless something like
this appears:
[SS1,[01
In this case the two characters should
have a comma between them.
On rare occasions [REV 11 will
appear in a listing. This is a delete
symbol and is created by entering the
line up to this mnemonic, Then type a
closing quotation mark (SHIFT & 2)
and delete it. This gets the computer
out of quotes mode. Hold down CTRL
and press t h e  number  nine k ey
(RVSON), type the relevant number of
reversed T 's  and then hold down
CTRL and press zero (RVSOFF).
Next type another quotation mark and
delete it again. Now ﬁnish the line and
press RETURN.
A list of these special cases is given
in the table but remember that only
one o f  these mnemonics will appear
outside of a PRINT string: the symbol
for pi. This may appear when its value
is needed in a calculation so this may
look something like:
YOUR COMMODORE december 1986:69
:CC=21PIl*R:
Ignore the square brackets and just
type i n  a  shifted upward pointing
arrow (le, the pi symbol).

immediately because i t will be used
with most of the present and future
listings appeari ng  i n  Y o u r
Commodore.
At the start of each programming
session, load Checksum and run it.
The screen will turn brown with yellow
characters and each time you type in a
line and press the RETURN key a
number will appear on the screen in
white. This should be the same as the
corresponding value in the magazine.
If the two values don't relate to one
another, you have not copied the line
exactly as printed so go back and check
each character carefully. When you
ﬁnd the error simply correct it and
YOUR COMMODORE december 1986:70
press RETURN again.
If you want to turn off the checker
simply type SYS49I52 and the screen
will return to the familiar blue colours.
You can then do whatever it was you
wanted to do and if this doesn't use the
area where Checksum lies you can go
back t o  i t  w i th  th e  same SYS

If you think that one of our programs looks very interesting, but you can't
afford the t ime
/
computer keyboard just ﬁnished a marathon typing session
entering one of the superb programs from Your Commodore.
Your ﬁngers reach for the keyboard and press the letters R.
U and N . You press RETURN, sit back and nothing
happens.
Everyone has probably faced this problem. When it does
happen it's a matter of spending hours searching through
the program for any typing mistakes. No matter how lo ng
you look or how many people help you, you can usually
guarantee that at least one little bug slips through unnoticed.
The Your Commodore Software Service makes available
all of the programs from each issue on both cassette and disk
at a price of E6.00 for disk and E4.00 for cassette. None of the
documentation for the programs is supplied with the
software since it is all available in the relevant magazine.
Should you not have the magazine then back issues are
available from the following address:
INFONET LTD, Times House, 179 The Marlowes, Hemel
Hempstead, Herts. II PI 1 BB.
TEL: (0442) 48435
please contact this address for prices and availability.
The Cassette
Software
for sale
All programs on the cassette are saved using a turbo
program. If you have ever purchased software from us on
cassette before it is worth pointing out that as of this issue
cassette the turbo used has been altered. On all cassettes for
previous issues the programs are unprotected and appear in
the same format as they do in the magazine i.e. in the form of
Basic loaders, The new turbo being used from this issue
onwards allows us to produce fully working versions of the
program on cassette. This means that you will simply have to
LOAD the programs in and they will automatically start.
Should we put any programs for the C128 on the cassette
they will be stored as C64 programs. LOAD these programs
into the computer in C64 format and resave them to cassette
or disk. To use the program turn your computer into 028
mode and LOAD and RUN as normal.
READERS SERVICE
The Disk
Please Note
UTILITY SPECIAL
YOUR COMMODORE december 1986:72
Programs on the disk will also be supplied as totally working
versions, i.e. when possible we will not use Basic Loaders
thus making use of the programs much easier. Unfortunately
at the moment we cannot duplicate C16 and Plus/4
cassettes. However programs for these machines will be
available on the disk.
What programs are available?
At the top of each article you will ﬁnd a strap containing
the article type, C64 Program etc. So that you can see which
programs are available on which format you will also ﬁnd a
couple of symbols after this strap. The symbols have the
following meaning:
OLD
This symbol means that the program is available on cassette,
These programs are available on disk.
Since the programs supplied on cassette are total working
versions of the program, we do not put disk only programs
on tape. There is no sense in placing a program that expects
to be reading from disk on to tape.
This contains a few of our most popular utilities from earlier
issues of the magazine. The programs are:
MACH 2 our disk based assembler from Nov '85 to Feb '86.
STOP THIEF — add protection to your programs with this
utility from our Feb '86 issue.
IN CHARACTER — an excellent character editor from
November 1985.
MOB MAKER — to complement the character editor, a
sprite editor from the March 1985 issue.
DISK EDITOR — an extremely powerful utility for disk
drive owners allowing you to directly access and alter every
segment of your disk.

Should you not have any of the above issues and would
like instructions then a full set of photocopies is available for
E1.50. Please order this separately from: Your Commodore,
Utility Special Photocopies, No 1 Golden Square, London

(a) A F IND routine which will be of
use i n  developing Basic programs.
FIND a$ would list all Basic lines
containing a $ ,  ready  f o r  y o u  t o
examine or change.
(b) A MERG E routine for disk use
which w ill merge all o r  part o f  a
program on the disk with a program in
memory. The routine is a true merge in
that you could select a subroutine from
a program on disk and merge it with a
program already in the Plus/4 memory
- not add it on the end as is the case
with many Merge programs,
(c) An assembler for the Plus/4 which
would support a ll labels etc. and
enable y ou t o  write machine code
programs in assembler language,
Starting Up
The program in its completed state is
loaded fr om disk o r  tape into the
normal Basic area. The ﬁrst part is in
Basic which operates routines to move
the utilities into memory starting at
8E300, lowers the top of memory to
protect the routines and inserts a
wedge in the GETCHR routine so that
new Basic commands FIND, MERGE
and ASSEMBLE are accepted.
First type in the Basic program in
Figure I. The SYS 4528 will operate
the sequence whic h initialises t he
program, the screen is cleared and a
heading printed so that you know the
program is raedy for use, DO  NOT
RUN this program before typing in the
initialisation program which is given in
Figure 2.
PLUS/4 PROGRAM
Remember
the Plus/4

I have decided that the bestd way to
enter machine code is  t o  use the
monitor. The reason most programs
are written in data statements is that
the C64 does not have a monitor. So
YOUR COMMODORE december 1986:77
type M[Shifted0] and [RETURN] to
go i n t o  monitor , t h e n  M  I I  BO
[RETURN] will display the ﬁrst block
of memory. Change t h e  memory
locations to read as in Figure 2. At the
5

end of the ﬁrst block, M (RETURN]
will display the next block of memory
ready for you to change.
Have you done it correctly? This is
always a worry but there is a check. On
the Plus/4 you can disassemble the
routine using the monitor.
Type D 11B0 12CF [RETURN] to
disassemble the routine and it should
be as Figure 3. If not, check for errors
and adjust.
This may be as far as you wish to go
in your ﬁrst session, so I shall now look

lowered t o  SE300 ready fo r  o u r
machine code.
A little more explanation now will
help when you are writing your own
routines, so let's look at the code in
Figure 3.
The ﬁrst six statements store the
machine code command ..IMP $E343 in
the GETC H R  command i n  th e
operating RAM. The routine starts at
$0473 and it deserves a few moments of
study so  disassemble i t  using the
monitor and work out what it does.
This is the routine which is in constant
use when the computer is executing
Basic routines. When yo u  typ e
[RETURN] after a direct command
the operating system uses this routine
to read your instruction.
Our new command inserted into
the routine is called a wedge and will
enable the computer to look our new
commands' before th e  operating
system looks fo r  a  normal Basic
command. If it ﬁnds one of our new
commands o u r  program w i l l  b e
executed, otherwise operation will be
returned to  the compUter operating
system. This wedge will make a slight
difference to the speed of operation

but so small that you will not notice it
and your normal Basic programs will
still be able to work even when the
utilities are loaded.
The statements from LDA S E 2
to BEW 1 C F  move the machine
code from $1200 to $29FF into high
RAM from $E300 to $FAFT.
New values for the top of memory
are loaded i n to  th e  pointers a t
$3.3334,$37 and $38 ﬁnishing with a
return RTS which returns us to the
basic programs to print the header.
The rest of the machine code works
from high RAM but for explanation I
will refer to its low RAM location.
However, after you've typed th e

initialisation routine and ru n  the
program to  relocate at $E300, you
could disassemble fro m th e  new
locations for a clearer idea of what is
happening.
The routines from $1200 to $1212
are the ROM and RAM switches (dealt
with in Your Commodore, May-July
'86). These will be moved to the tape
buffer area $03E0 b y  instructions
$1213 to $121E when the routines are
activated.
$121F to $1242 is the routine to
enable high RAM to use sub-routines
in H i  RO M (Your Commodore July
'86).
$1243 t o  $125D checks i f  the
computer is dealing with a  direct
command, if not the wedge returns the
computer to  the GETCHR routine
with the JMP $0481 command.
$1269 to $12AA checks to see if the
direct command is one of ours, if not it
returns t o  Basic b y  th e  branch
statement at $1276.
A list of the new commands is given
from $12AB to SI 2CF, these are stored
with the last letter shifted i.e. FIND is
stored as E46E49,E4E and ﬁnally $C4.
I have left a little space from $12BC to
IL

$12CF for your new commands when
you write your own utility. (Actually
the space will be in high RAM from
$E3BC to SE3CF.
The addresses of the new rotuines
(-1) are stored as Hi bytes from $12D1
and Lo bytes from $12D7, Remember
the stack adds one to the pointers
stored on the stack when a RTS is
encountered in the program.
Notice that I've left three zero bytes
at the end of each list to enable you to
add your own routines later.
If one o f  our new routines is
required then its address is pushed on
to the stack at $12A0 to $12A9 and
then goes to the routine on meeting the
RTS at $12AA.

Entering the Code
kir We will now enter the code at the place
where it normally exists.
Remember that before you start to
enter the routine you will need to be in
high RAM and you will need to alter
the memory location $07F8 to to $80
so that RAM will be displayed rather
ri than ROM. Figure 4 shows the storage
for the ROM subroutine addresses that
will be available for our program.
Figure 5 is the FIND routine. Figure 6
gives the MERGE routine, Figure 8
gives the ASSEMBLER program.
When you have entered all the
code, or at an intermediate stage if you
like, save the program as follows.
(a) Type X[RETURN] to go back to
Basic, then NEW [RETURN].
PLUS/4 PROGRAM
(b) LOAD'UTILITIES i f  on tape.
DLOAD'UTILITIES' if on disk.
DO NOT RUN
(c) Type M[Shiftedel [RETURN] to go
into monitor.
(d) Check that location $07F8 is $80.
(e) Type T E300 FI300 1200. This will
transfer our maclArie code to  low
RAM to join our Basic program.
(f) Return to Basic with X [RETURN].
(g) Save with the normal instruction.
SAVE 'UTILITIES' — tape
DSAVE' UTILITIES' d i s k
At the start o f the next session
LOAD and RIJN the program in the
normal Basic manner. Continue to
enter the machine code from where
you left off and, at the end, save as
above.
Check Program
Remember that it is always a good idea
to save machine code programs before
you run them in case you have made a
typing mistake which makes the
program hang. If you do get a hang up,
press the RUN/STOP key and keep it
pressed while you press the reset
button. If you have difﬁculties, load
the check program Figure 8. RUN and
check the values given in the table.
Figure 9. This will enable you to ﬁnd
which section has the mistake.
The machine code program that
You have now entered is an aid to
programmers. I t  contains three
programs: F I N D .  M E R G E ,
ASSEMBLE.
YOUR COMMODORE december 1986:81
Procedure
It is a good idea to keep the program as
the ﬁrst on a disk when SHIFTED
RUN/STOP will load and run the
program. For a cassette system, load
and run in the normal manner. You
should see the title o f the program
1.yhich will have loaded into the top of
RAM. The top of memory pointers
will also have been lowered to protect
the program. Basic programs can now
be used as required. FIND, MERGE
and ASSEMBLE w i l l  a l so  b e
available.
FIND
This command will print all the Basic
lines containing th e  sequence o f
characters following the command e.g.
FIND PRINT will list all the lines in
the program containing the word
PRINT.
Note: I f  you wish to  search for a
sequence that is inside literates then
you must p u t literates after the
command FIND e.g.
FIND "PRINT searches for the word
PRINT inside literates. I t  will ﬁnd
different lines to FIND PRINT.
MERGE
This routine will merge a program on
disk with a program in memory. If the
FIG. 5 FIND ROUTINE

program on disk has line numbers the
same a s  t h e  program already i n
memory then the new program will
contain both lines! The RENUMBER
command could be used to allocate
unique numbers to each line.

Or by using them as labels in statement
lines:
60 LOOP T XA
Statement 5 0 w ill assign the H E X
value 89088 to STROUT.
Statement 60 will assign the current
location to LOOP.
Note t h a t  a  label s hould b e
separated fr om the Op-Code b y  a
space. Also the ﬁrst three letters of a
label should not normally be an Op-
Code e.g.
10 LDA LDA$45
PLUS/4 PROGRAM
would not be accepted.
If such a label is essential then use a
colon after the label.
10 LDA:LDA$45
would be acceptd by the program.
The two types of statement should not
be used on one line
i.e. 10 LOOP STROUT=S9088 is not
permitted.
Variables m a y  b e  u p  t o  s ix
characters in  length and may be a
mixture of alpha-numeric characters.
Statements of the type:
YOUR COMMODORE december 1986!85
30 LABEL=NAME
are only valid if  NAME has already
been deﬁned. (If not LABEL would be
given the default Nra ue WEFT).
It is particularly important that all
zero page addresses are deﬁned before
they are used.
Difﬁculties m a y  aris e i f  these
simple rules are not followed, f o r
example:
ASC
ASC-H X
ASC-IN
would be taken as identical, since the
ﬁrst non alpha-numeric character is
used in the ASSEMBLER program as
a terminator.
The s y mbol h a s  a  special
meaning:
10*=$800
assigns the next code to location $8000
and the ASSEMBLER will continue
assembling f r o m  t h is  point. T h e
default value has been set at 80333.
The symbol * may not be used as a
variable or label e.g.
BNE *+2
will not work (Use BNE 2 ) .
The ASSEMBLER runs through the
assembler language program twicce,
the ﬁrst time allocating values t o
variables and labels, the second run
produces the pr int out. I n  a  long
program there will be a short pause
before the print-out commences.
Comments
Comments should be preceded by a
semi-colon.
(i) I f  the comment follows a normal
instruction it should be limited to 35
characters -  all characters after this
will be ignored.
(ii) I f  the statement contains only a
comment then the print out will be
offset to the left. The comment may
then be up to 57 characters.
(iii) I f  the statement contains only a
semi-colon t h e n  not hing w i l l  b e
printed but a carriage return/line feed
will be sent to the screen or printer.
This is useful when it is required to
leave a gap between different sections
of  the program.

Op-codes
All t h e  6502/7501 op-codes a r e
accepted plus an additional three.
(i) T XT ' will load all characters after
the apopstrophe i n t o  memory  as
ASCII codes.
(ii) WR D  O PERAND will load the
operand as low then high bytes.
(iii) B Y T  O PERAND w ill load an
OPERAND of value less than 256 as
one byte.
BYTE L A B E L  will load the low
byte of LABEL.
BYT L A B E L  w ill load the high
byte of LABEL.
Modes
Different modes are recognised by the
following normal convention:
IMPLIED and ACC -  Op-code with
no operand -  SEC.
ABSOLUTE -  Op-code with absolute
operand - LDA$1001. ZERO-PAGE -
Op-code with zero-page operand
LDA$30.
INDIRECT -  Operand in brackets -
.IMP($3020).
INDEXED -  Operand followed by
comma then X or Y (Default value is
Y). LD,A 5672.Y.
INDIRECT I N D EXED  -  Brackets
Comma -  LDA (64).Y.
INDEXED I N D I R EC T  -  Bracket
Comma +  Bracket -  LDA(64,X).
IMMEDIATE -  b e f o r e  operand -
LDA $32.
RELATIVE -  Recognised f r o m
coding -  BCC LABEL.
Operands
There are several types of operands.
(i) Base 10 -  5230.
(ii) Hex -  SAl2B.
(Note: Hex numbers must be preceded
by a dollar sign and have either two or
four characters e.g. SO2 not $2,)
(iii) Binary -  %1001001I
(Note: Binary starts with % and may
have up ti eight digits of either one or
zero.)
(iv) ASCII -  'B
(Note: Start with ' and limited to one
character apart from TXT). Care is
needed here since the program uses the
Basic editor. Statements such as:
10 LDA ' 7
are liable to be changed by the Basic
editor to 10 LDA ' P R I N T .  The same

W
computers, people shrink in horror at
the sheer number of commands that
you need to know before you can get
your computer to work. Take a look at
the C64 with its  complicated disk
commands w hic h n o  greenie t o
computers i s  going t o  remember
straight away. i t  is  therefore n o t
surprising that someone has at long
last come up with a product that will
make communication between you,
your C64 and its Commodore disk
drive a  lo t  easier and much more
pleasant.
C64 REVIEW
raphic
Environment
Operating
System
Windows, Icons and Menus all form part of the new easy
to use operating system that you can add to your C64
with GEOS.
By Stuart Cooke
GEOS replaces many of the usual
typed commands w ith a  series o f
pictures, c a lle d  ic o n s ,  m a k i n g
handling of your input much easier.
For example instead of having to type
in the usual LO AD "name", device,
secondary-address command as you
normally would with a C64 program
you simply have to move your pointer
to the icon or 'picture' of the program
that you require, select it by pressing
the button, next choose LO AD from
the appropriate menu and it's away
you go.
Not only does G FOS improve your
YOUR COMMODORE december 198690
communication with y our computer
but rather it gives you access to a whole
host o f  facilities. F o r  example y ou
have faster disk access, a desk top
which offers y ou facilities such as
calendars and alarm clocks and a
calculator. With the software supplied
you also get a graphics program called
quite original — G EO PAMT  and a
pseudo 'Wor dpr oc es s or  c a lle d
G E
Perhaps the best way to describe
the operation of the program is to refer
to t he pictures accompanying this
review.

coollike e opt i on$
to to say how
much I enjoyed the last issue of Your
Commodore. I was particularly inter-
ested in the article about
Once you have loaded GEOS into
your CM you will be presented with a
display similar to that in photograph
The large area in the centre o f  the
screen shows what programs are on the
disk in the drive — or rather a portion of
the ﬁles on disk. I f  you look at the
bottom corner of this 'page' you will
ﬁnd a 'dog-ear', move your pointer to
this and the next page of programs on
the disk is shown, If you examine the
screen shot more closely you will see
that each of  the ﬁles has a different
picture associated with it. This enables
you to see at a glance what type of
program each one is. For example the
picture with the palette is a graphics
program — easy isn't it?
Whenever y ou save a  program
while using GEOS the date and time
that it was SAVEd is noted together
with a small amount of text if you like.
As you may already know it is possible
to protect ﬁles on a CM disk, however
Commodore didn't give any easy way
to use this extremely useful facility,
with GEOS you can now protect and
unprotect ﬁles with ease.
Any C M  disk can be used with
GEOS. Should you use one that hasn't
been set up for use with GEOS, all of
the ﬁles will be given the symbol of an
index c a r d  w i t h  a  s t a n d a r d
Commodore l o g o  o n  i t .  T h i s
symbolises an old-style CM program.
You do have the option o f  turning
your disks into GEOS disks and this
doesn't alter the contents of your disk
at all but does take up some room.
Changing a disk withing GEOS is also
extremely easy. Move the pointer to
the disk LOGO and press the button,
the ﬁles now displayed on the screen
will be those that are on the current
disk in the drive.
Across the top of the area that is
used to illustrate the contents of the
disk currently being used you will ﬁnd
a series of Menus. Should you move
the pointer to one of these, the menu
will ' p u ll dow n' a n d  t he various
options  a v a ila b le  a r e  s h o w n .

GEOS
C64 REVIEW
This menu is used to access a number
of different desk accessories. Y o u
needn't have all of these available on
the disk you are using, after all if you
never use the calculator option then
you may as well remove it from the
disk directory so that you get more
room f o r  pr ogr am storage. T h e
options available o n  the standard
GEO,S
are the PREFERENCE MANAG ER
which allows you to change the actual
colours that are being used on the
screen. Yo u  can alter the speed at
which the pointer moves and you can
also alter the design of the pointer. The
preference menu is also where you set
up the clock and the date for use within
the program.
A calculator is also available which
offers 11 functions. You can either
.
that appears on the screen when you
choose this option or you can simply
use the keys, which is far quicker.
A notepad w it h  127 pages is
available f o r  jotting d o w n  thos e
important telephone messages and the
text and photo managers allow you to
transfer little pieces of  artwork and
text around different programs.
YOUR COMMODORE december 1986:91
The printer that you are using is also
selected from the GEOS menu. You
must us e a  pr inter  w it h  grahics
capability w i t h  G EO S s inc e a n y
printout is  actually produced as  a
grahpics dump rather than using the
printers characters set. This is a lot
slower than printing straight text but
does allow you to use numerous type
s ty les  a n d  d i f f e r e n t  f o n t s .
While on the subject of printers it is
worth pointing out that to print any
ﬁle you simply need to point to it and
then move the now highlighted ﬁle to
the printer icon at the bottom of the
screen, the ﬁle will now be printed. If
you should wish to erase a ﬁle simply
move the picture t o  the trash bin
instead.
File
The ﬁle menu is where you can start to
manipulate your disk ﬁles. First on the
list o f  commands from this menu is
OPEN whic h simply LO AD S and
RUNS the selected ﬁle. DUPLICATE
allows you to copy an existing ﬁle to
one of a new name but on the same
disk. Copying programs between disks
is extremely simple. Select the ﬁle that
you wish to copy. Move its icon below
the ﬁle display area. Close the source
disk and remove it from the disk drive.
Place the new disk into the drive select
OPEN from the disk menu move the
icon o f  the ﬁle back into the display
area and hey presto! One copied ﬁle,
RENAME, as its name suggests,
allows you to alter the name of any
ﬁles on your disk. PRINT is the same
as dragging the ﬁle to the printer — it
prints out the contents of the selected
ﬁle.
The INFO command is extremely
interesting as it allows you to examine

speciﬁc information about the ﬁles on
disk this information includes:
Name o f  the disk where the ﬁle is
located.
The type of ﬁle -  system, application
etc.
The permanent internal name of ﬁle.
The ﬁle structure.
The size of the ﬁle.
The date and time that the program
was last modiﬁed.
The name of the programmer.
Whether t h e  pr ogr am i s  w r it e
protected or not.
View
This option allows you to select the
way in which the ﬁles are displayed in
the display area. One choice available
is ICON, which displays the programs
with their icon, as on photos I and 2.
You c a n  a ls o  dis play  t h e  ﬁles
alphabetically by name, in the order of
last modiﬁcation by size or by the ﬁle
type.
Disk
This is  where GEOS allows you to
perform y our  general maintainance
upon your disks. The ﬁrst option in the
menu is OPEN. This will read the disk
that is  currently i n  the drive and
display the directory on the screen in
the format speciﬁed in the view option.
CLOSE i s  t h e  opposite t o  t h is
command and y o u  should always
CLOSE a disk before you remove it
from the drive.
Copying a  whole disk is  made
possible with the COPY command.
This disk copy is intended only for two
drive systems and works extremely
quickly. Single drive users can still use
this c ommand a n d  they  w i l l  b e

C64 REVIEW
prompted t o  s wap dis k s  b y  t h e
program. this may however take 25
swaps to copy a full disk. A BACKUP
utility program is  provided on the
GEOS disk which will need only three
disks swaps s o is  obviously muc h
better.
A new disk obviously needs to be
formatted before use, The FORMAT
command allows you to do this with
ease.
Quite often it is useful to be able to
change the name that appears at the
top o f  your disks. T he R EN AME
command allows you to do this.
When you have used a disk for
quite some time it is useful to be able to
tidy the disk up and check it for errors.
Normally you would use the standard
Commodore Validate command t o
perform this. The VALIDATE option
in the DISK menu performs the same
task.
When you ﬁrst boot GEOS into the
computer it is set up for single disk
operation. The A D D  D I SK option
enables you to use a second drive with
GEOS. adding greater ﬂexibility to the
system and requiring fewer disk swaps.
This is the menu that allows you to
escape f r o m  G EO S. T h e  options
available allow y ou t o  perform a
RESET of GEOS• and reopens the disk.
BASIC' returns y ou in t o  standard
Commodore Basic. To reload GEOS
you simply have to make sure that the
original GEOS is in the drive and hit
the RESTORE key. This however will
only wor k  i f  you haven't r un any
programs that use the area of memory
at which the GEOS bootstrap sits
(SC000).
The ﬁnal option isn't of that much
interest to UK users as it boots up a
YOUR COMMODORE december 1986:92
communications pr ogr am c alled
QLINK. It is important to point out
that Q L I N K  i s  f o r  us e w it h  a n
American communications system
and cannot be used in the UK.
The Programs
As well as providing an exceptionally
friendly fr ont end f o r  disk users.
GEOS• also comes complete with two
ex tremely  p o w e r f u l  p r o g r a m s
GEOWRITE and GEOPAINT Many
people have referred to GEO WRITE as
a wordprocessor but I think that this is
going a little far, What GEO WRITE
does do is allow you to enter text into
your C64 in  one o f  a number o f
avbilable fonts, include pictures that
you have produced within GEOPAINT
and then dump the whole thing to your
printer. Missing from the program are
all of the usual things that you would
expect from a wordprocessor such as
search a n d  replace. variable page
lengths, different line spacing etc,
though you can change margins and
tabs as on a typewriter.
GEO WRITE is extremely easy to
use and should present no problems to
anyone who would like to print out a
letter or  document. T o start up the
program you simply have to OPEN the
GEOWRITE program by  using the
pointer (NB a quick double press on
the button w hile pointing t o  t he
program performs the same function),
you will then be asked if you want to
create a new ﬁle or  wish to edit an
existing one, again a ll answers are
input via the pointer and controller.
Once the necessary information has
been entered you will ﬁnd yourself in
GEOWRITE staring at the text editing
window.
Because the C64 does not display
on its screen as many characters as a

1
p
window over a large piece o f paper
scrolling as you move around the page.
The ability to enter text where you
want is particularly important when
you want to add pictures that you have
created fr o m  within GEOPAINT,
When entering text you do not have to
worry about the positioning of words
as you would when using a typewriter
as the program has an automatic
word-wrap facility. This means that if
a word will not ﬁt on a line then the
computer will automatically start it on
the next line of the display for you.
Across the top of your document you
will see a similar menu to that found
when using GEOS as a 'front end' for
your disks. As before you have the
GEOS menu which offers you all of
your desk to p  facilities such a s
calculator etc.
FILE allows you to perform such
operations as SAVEing the ﬁle to
memory f o r  later use o r  simply
updating the copy of the ﬁle that is on
disk so that you can carry on working
knowing that what you have already
done is safely on disk.
No matter how proﬁcient a typist
you are or how good a writer, you are
bound to make some mistakes, thus
the E D IT command. This option
allows you to remove whole sections of
text from the program or simply copy
it elsewhere, this is extremely handy
for re-organising the structure of your
document. Inserting te xt i n to  a
document i s  also extremely easy,
simply move the pointer to the place
where you would like to insert and it's
away you go!
The options menu has some
extremely powerful commands within
it_ The ﬁrst of these is the PREVIEW
AGE option. This draws on the
screen a high-res picture of what the
page will look like, Since the page is
greatly reduced this isn't usually
legible but it does give you an idea of
what your ﬁn
that you can move things around i f
necessary.
The second important option is
HIDE PICTURES_ A s  previously
mentioned, you can insert pictures
f r
However, every time a  picture is
displayed on screen it is fetched from
disk showing d o w n  th e  whole
operation until it is almost unbearable,
With this command all pictures are
erased from the screen until PRINT or
SHOW PICTURES is selected.
Fonts
C64 REVIEW
Numerous fonts are available for use
with the wordprocessor and many of
these are available in different sizes.
For examples of the text available take
a look at Figure I which contains a
printout of some of the text. As well as
being able to alter the type and size of
the fonts you can also alter the style in
which they are printed. The options
available are SOLID i.e. a normal face.
BOLD ITA L IC , OU TL IN E a n d
UNDERLINE. Again, these a re
shown in Figure I,
GEOPA MT is extremely easy to
use though it does have a couple of
'quirks'. For example i f you select a
new font and start typing, it takes a
while for the program to load the new
font from disk and then catch you up.
This quite often means that you have
typed a lot of text that the program has
not printed, the way around this is
simply to  take time when changing
to
Typing letters and documents can
now be made more interesting by
mixing te xt styles a n d  graphics.
However, I don't think that you would
ﬁnd too many people who would like
to use this program on an every day
basis as wordprocessor, too many
functions are missing. It is however
great fun.
Geopaint
This program, supplied with GEOS,
allows you to create your own charts
tables or other graphics for inclusion
within any text or you can even design
pictures that will occupy a full sheet of
printer paper. The program has two
modes of operation, 16 colour mode
and mono mode. The colour mode
allows you to access the full colour
capabilities of the C64, any printout
being produced in shades of grey. The
mono mode allows just two colours
which is far better and clearer for
pictures that are to be printed out.
After all a  printer only has two
colours, black and white. If you have
ever used a graphics program then you
will be pleased to know that all of the
options that you would expect from a
professional graphics program are
present.
A pencil is used for thin detailed
lines around the screen and a brush is
used for painting in larger areas. When
using a brush it is possible to select the
actual shape that the brush takes and
what pattern i t leaves behind it. A
computer brush doesn't need to leave a
solid wash of paint, it can leave behind
it textures such as checks or bricks. In
fact any o f  32 different patterns.
Should you simply wish to shade an
area o f  your drawing, then th e

airbrush is probably what you require.
This places random dots on the screen,
the longer you hold it on a particular
area the more dots you get.
Filling in  areas o f  the screen is
made particularly easy with the ﬁll
option. Point to the picture of the tap
and then to any area on the screen and
the area will be rapidly ﬁlled with the
current pattern. This ﬁll is extremely
fast and is one of the best that I have
seen in a C64 graphics program.
Options exist for drawing straight
lines, the measurements of which are
given at the bottom of the screen in a
handy readout. There is also a ruler
option that allows y ou t o  measure
distances o n  the screen, again the
ﬁgures appear at the bottom of the
screen.
Shapes
Options exist for  producing squares
and circles with either ﬁlled or open
centres and both are extremely quick.
It would have been nice to see options
for other  shapes as  well such as
triangles or elipses although you can
draw these with the pencil and lines
option, should you need them, and
then ﬁll them in using the ﬁll option.
Not only can you copy a picture
into a text ﬁle but you can also add text
into a picture. This is useful for adding
text t o  graphs, labelling pictures or
simply leaving your mark o n  your
latest masterpiece. A s  w i t h  t h e
wordprocessor you can choose the text
style and font that you require. All text
is entered in rectangular text regions.
The actual dimensions of the region
being under your control. You can
even mov e a  region and alter its
dimensions when it has text in it, the
text reformating itself to ﬁt the new
area.
Don't Panic
As with all good graphics programs, a
safety device is available which will
recover the state of your picture before
the last command, This is extremely
useful if  you make a mistake such as
ﬁlling in your whole picture with a
pattern. Also, whenever the viewing
area of the page is moved, the whole
picture is stored to disk so you can
usually get a fairly recent version of
your artwork back from disk with the
RECOVER option. Should you make
small errors then y ou can use the
erasor to rub them out.

Getting Larger
A z oom facility is  available which
makes it extremely easy to add ﬁne
detail to your picture. One extremely
nice touch is the way that you can
always see an actual size picture of any
enlarged area at the bottom o f  the
screen.
Areas
It is possible to manipulate rectangular
areas o f  the screen in a number of
ways. Yo u  can invert them, rotate
them, copy them, move them and even
wipe them clear,
As with the Wordprocessor only a
small area of the screen is displayed at
once, the PREVIEW option again
displays the whole page in small detail
so that you can see what the ﬁnished
product looks like.
GEOPALVT is one o f  the better
graphics programs that I have used.
The fact that you can only see a small
area of the screen is a bit of a hindrance
at ﬁrst but is quite easy when you get
used to it. The fact that you only see a
small area of the screen at once does
mean that you can get more detail into
your printouts than is available with
most other graphics programs since
they generally only work with an area
the size of the screen.
Verdict
GEOS provides an extremely easy user
interface for the C64 and a disk drive.
Myself, I would probably prefer to use
YOUR COMMODORE december 1986:94
the old style Commodore commands
for L O AD in g  a n d  R U N ing dis k
programs, though I must admit I have
been using them for quite some time.
Having shown GEOS to a number of
computer novices it is clear that they
found GEOS both quick and easy to
use. T h e  programs s upplied a r e
extremely pow er f ul a n d  s hould
provide both experienced users and
people who are just playing around
with s ome q u it e  satisfying a n d
professional results,
GEOS doesn't end here however.
As I have stated it is really a new way of
communicating with y our C64 and
disk drive. Numerous new programs
are in the pipeline that will be based
around the GEOS front end, These
include a professional wordprocessor
and database, a host of new fonts and a
set o f  new desk utilities including a
calendar generator, an editor that will
allow you to change the icons to suit
your own applications, an art grabber
that will allow you to swap graphics
with other commercial programs and
even a game of Blackjack.
if  the forthcoming programs can
manage to maintain the same ease of
use as the ones provided with the
program, then GEOS is certainly a
winner.
