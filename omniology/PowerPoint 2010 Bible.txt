I
was very fortunate to have a great team of experienced professionals on this book. Thanks
to executive editor Carol Long for the opportunity to work on this project. Maureen Spears
did a great job as my Development Editor, managing the process through some very tight
deadlines, and once again my wonderful technical editor Echo Swinford came through with
numerous improvements and suggestions that took the book up a notch in quality and
usefulness. Thanks also to my copy editor, Mildred Sanchez, for tightening up my language
and making sure I was making sense.

S
ome books zoom through a software program so fast it makes your head spin. You’ll come
out dizzy, but basically able to cobble together some sort of result, even if it doesn’t look
quite right. This is not one of those books.
The PowerPoint 2010 Bible is probably the only PowerPoint book you will ever need. In
fact, it might even be the only book on giving presentations you’ll ever need. No, seriously!
I mean it.
As you probably guessed by the heft of the book, this is not a quick-ﬁx shortcut to PowerPoint
expertise. Instead, it’s a thoughtful, thorough educational tool that can be your personal trainer
now and your reference text for years to come. That’s because this book covers PowerPoint from
‘‘cradle to grave.’’ No matter what your current expertise level with PowerPoint, this book brings
you up to the level of the most experienced and talented PowerPoint users in your ofﬁce. You
might even be able to teach those old pros a thing or two!
But this book doesn’t stop with PowerPoint procedures. Creating a good presentation is much
more than just clicking a few dialog boxes and typing some text. It requires knowledge and
planning — lots of it. That’s why this book includes a whole chapter on planning a presentation,
and another whole chapter on the practical issues involved in presenting one. You learn things
like the following:
 How to select the best color schemes for selling and informing
 How to gauge the size of the audience and the meeting room when selecting fonts
 How to arrange the tables and chairs in the meeting room to encourage (or discourage)
audience participation
 How to choose what to wear for a live presentation
 How to overcome stage fright
And lots more! When you ﬁnish this book, you will not only be able to build a presentation
with PowerPoint, but you’ll also be able to explain why you made the choices you did, and you’ll
deliver that presentation smoothly and with conﬁdence.
If you are planning a presentation for remote delivery (for example, posting it on a Web site or
setting up a kiosk at a trade show), you’ll ﬁnd lots of help for these situations too. In fact, an
entire section of the book is devoted to various nontraditional presentation methods, such as live
Internet or network delivery, trade show booths, and interactive presentation distribution on a
disk or CD.

Preface
How This Book Is Organized
This book is organized into parts, which are groups of chapters that deal with a common general
theme. Here’s what you’ll ﬁnd:
 Part I: Building Your Presentation. In this part, you start building a robust, content-rich
presentation by choosing a template, entering your text, and applying text formatting.
 Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content. This part teaches you how to import
and create various types of graphical and multimedia content including clip art, diagrams,
photos, charts, sound effects, movies, and music. You’ll also learn here how to create
movement with animation effects and transitions.
 Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience. This part helps you prepare your presentation
for various delivery scenarios, including printing handouts for a live audience, running a
live show on a computer screen, designing visual aids for user-interactive or self-running
presentations, and sharing a collaborating with others.
 Part IV: Project Labs. This part provides four step-by-step walkthroughs that demon-
strate how to create some of the most powerful and sought-after PowerPoint effects and
projects, including creating navigation systems, classroom games, complex animations,
and graphically presented text.
What’s on the companion CD-ROM
The CD-ROM included with PowerPoint 2010 Bible contains more than 500 PowerPoint
templates and backgrounds that you can use to design your own PowerPoint presentations.
If you aren’t familiar with how to choose a background or template for your presentation, be
sure to read Chapter 3 in this book, which discusses templates, and Chapter 5, which includes
the backgrounds discussion, before attempting to use the CD-ROM. Please see the CD-ROM
Appendix for more information on the professional designers who supplied the templates for
your use. The CD-ROM also contains author ﬁles for use in the Project Labs in Part IV.
Special Features
Every chapter in this book opens with a quick look at what’s in the chapter and closes with a
summary. Along the way, you also ﬁnd icons in the margins to draw your attention to speciﬁc
topics and items of interest.
Here’s what the icons mean:
Cross-Reference
These icons point you to chapters or other sources for more information on the topic under discussion. ■

P
owerPoint 2010 is a member of the Microsoft Ofﬁce 2010 suite of
programs. A suite is a group of programs designed by a single manu-
facturer to work well together. Like its siblings — Word (the word
processor), Excel (the spreadsheet), Outlook (the personal organizer and
e-mail manager), and Access (the database) — PowerPoint has a well-deﬁned
role. It creates materials for presentations.
A presentation is any kind of interaction between a speaker and audience, but
it usually involves one or more of the following visual aids: 35mm slides,
overhead transparencies, computer-based slides (either local or at a Web
site or other network location), hard-copy handouts, and speaker notes.
PowerPoint can create all of these types of visual aids, plus many other types
that you’ll learn about as you go along.
Because PowerPoint is so tightly integrated with the other Microsoft Ofﬁce
2010 components, you can easily share information among them. For
example, if you have created a graph in Excel, you can use that graph on a
PowerPoint slide. It goes the other way, too. You can, for example, take the
outline from your PowerPoint presentation and copy it into Word, where
you can dress it up with Word’s powerful document formatting commands.
Virtually any piece of data in any Ofﬁce program can be linked to any
other Ofﬁce program, so you never have to worry about your data being
in the wrong format. PowerPoint also accepts data from almost any other
Windows-based application, and can import a variety of graphics, audio,
and video formats.
In this chapter you’ll get a big-picture introduction to PowerPoint 2010, and
then we’ll ﬁre up the program and poke around a bit to help you get familiar
with the interface. You’ll ﬁnd out how to use the tabs and panes, and how
to get help and updates from Microsoft.

Part I: Building Your Presentation
Who Uses PowerPoint and Why?
PowerPoint is a popular tool for people who give presentations as part of their jobs, and also
for their support staff. With PowerPoint, you can create visual aids that help get the message
across to an audience, whatever that message may be and whatever format it may be presented
in. Although the traditional kind of presentation is a live speech presented at a podium, advances
in technology have made it possible to give several other kinds of presentations, and PowerPoint
has kept pace nicely. The following list outlines the most common PowerPoint formats:
 Podium: For live presentations, PowerPoint helps the lecturer emphasize key points
through the use of overhead transparencies, 35mm slides, or computer-based shows.
 Kiosk shows: These are self-running presentations that provide information in an un-
attended location. You have probably seen such presentations listing meeting times and
rooms in hotel lobbies and as sales presentations at trade show booths.
 CDs and DVDs: You can package a PowerPoint presentation on a CD or DVD and dis-
tribute it with a press release, a marketing push, or a direct mail campaign. The presenta-
tion can be in PowerPoint format, or can be converted to Web format or even a movie clip,
for distribution.
 Internet formats: You can use PowerPoint to create a show that you can present live over
a network or the Internet with a service such as PowerPoint Live, while each participant
watches from his or her own computer. You can even store a self-running or interactive
presentation on a Web site in a variety of formats and make it available for the public to
download and run on a PC.
When you start your ﬁrst PowerPoint presentation, you may not be sure which delivery method
you will use. However, it’s best to decide the presentation format before you invest too much
work in your materials, because the audience’s needs are different for each medium.
Cross-Reference
You learn more about planning your presentation in Chapter 2. ■
Most people associate PowerPoint with sales presentations, but PowerPoint is useful for people in
many other lines of work as well. The following sections present a sampling of how real people
just like you are using PowerPoint in their daily jobs.
Sales
More people use PowerPoint for selling goods and services than for any other reason. Armed
with a laptop computer and a PowerPoint presentation, a salesperson can make a good impres-
sion on a client anywhere in the world. Figure 1-1 shows a slide from a sample sales presenta-
tion.
Sales possibilities with PowerPoint include the following:
 Live presentations in front of clients with the salesperson present and running the show.
This is the traditional kind of sales pitch that most people are familiar with.
4

Chapter 1: A First Look at PowerPoint
 Self-running presentations that ﬂip through the slides at speciﬁed intervals so that
passersby can read them or ignore them as they wish. These types of presentations are
great for grabbing people’s attention at trade show booths.
 User-interactive product information demos distributed on CD/DVD that potential
customers can view at their leisure on their own PCs. This method is very inexpensive,
because you can create a single presentation and distribute it by mail to multiple
customers.
FIGURE 1-1
PowerPoint offers unparalleled ﬂexibility for presenting information to potential customers.
Cross-Reference
See Chapter 20 to learn about controlling a live presentation. You create a self-running or user-interactive
presentation in Chapter 21. ■
Marketing
The distinction between sales and marketing can be rather blurred at times, but marketing gener-
ally refers to the positioning of a product in the media rather than its presentation to a particular
company or individual. Marketing representatives are often called upon to write advertising copy,
generate camera-ready layouts for print advertisements, design marketing ﬂyers and shelf dis-
plays, and produce other creative selling materials.
5

Part I: Building Your Presentation
PowerPoint is not a drawing program per se, and it can’t substitute for one except in a crude
way. However, by combining the Ofﬁce 2010 clip art collection and drawing tools with some
well-chosen fonts and borders, a marketing person can come up with some very usable designs
in PowerPoint. Figure 1-2 shows an example. You learn about clip art in Chapter 12. You can
also integrate video clips in PowerPoint presentations that can tell the story of your product; see
Chapter 17 for more information.
FIGURE 1-2
PowerPoint can generate camera-ready marketing materials, although they can’t substitute for the
tools that professional advertising companies use.
Human Resources
Human resources personnel often ﬁnd themselves giving presentations to new employees to
explain the policies and beneﬁts of the company. A well-designed, attractive presentation gives
the new folks a positive impression of the company they have signed up with, starting them off
on the right foot.
One of the most helpful features in PowerPoint for the human resources professional is the
Organization Chart tool. With it, you can easily diagram the structure of the company and make
changes whenever necessary with a few mouse clicks. Figure 1-3 shows an organization chart on
6

Chapter 1: A First Look at PowerPoint
a PowerPoint slide. You can also create a variety of other diagram types. Organization charts and
other diagrams are covered in Chapter 11.
FIGURE 1-3
Microsoft’s Organization Chart lets you easily create organizational diagrams from within
PowerPoint.
Education and Training
Most training courses include a lecture section in which the instructor outlines the general pro-
cedures and policies. This part of the training is usually followed up with individual, hands-on
instruction. PowerPoint can’t help much with the latter, but it can help make the lecture portion
of the class go smoothly.
If you have access to a scanner, you can scan in diagrams and drawings of the objects you are
teaching the students to use. You can also use computer-generated images, such as screen cap-
tures and video clips, to teach people about software.
PowerPoint’s interactive controls even let you create quizzes that each student can take on-screen
to gauge his or her progress. Depending on the button the student clicks, you can set up the
quiz to display a ‘‘Yes, you are correct!’’ or ‘‘Sorry, try again’’ slide. See Figure 1-4. For details
about this procedure, see Chapter 21 and Lab 4 in the Project Labs section at the end of
the book.

Hotel and Restaurant Management
Service organizations such as hotels and restaurants often need to inform their customers of var-
ious facts but need to do so unobtrusively so that the information will not be obvious except to
those looking for it. For example, a convention center hotel might provide a list of the meetings
taking place in its meeting rooms, or a restaurant might show pictures of the day’s specials on a
video screen in the waiting area.
In such unattended situations, a self-running (kiosk) presentation works best. Typically the com-
puter box and keyboard are hidden from passersby, and the monitor displays the information.
Cross-Reference
You learn more about kiosk setups in Chapter 21. ■
Clubs and Organizations
Many nonproﬁt clubs and organizations, such as churches and youth centers, operate much
the same way as for-proﬁt businesses and need sales, marketing, and informational materials.
But clubs and organizations often have special needs too, such as the need to recognize
8

Chapter 1: A First Look at PowerPoint
volunteers for a job well done. Ofﬁce online provides a Certiﬁcate template that’s ideal for
this purpose. Figure 1-5 shows a certiﬁcate generated in PowerPoint. Another popular use for
PowerPoint is to project the lyrics of a song on a big screen for sing-alongs at churches and
meetings.
FIGURE 1-5
With PowerPoint, you can easily create certiﬁcates and awards.
What’s New in PowerPoint 2010?
PowerPoint 2010 is very much like PowerPoint 2007 in its basic functionality. It uses a tabbed
Ribbon across the top, rather than a traditional menu system, and employs dialog boxes and a
Quick Access Toolbar in the same ways that 2007 did.
This doesn’t mean that there aren’t changes and improvements, though! The following sections
outline the major differences you will see when you upgrade from PowerPoint 2007 to
PowerPoint 2010.
Backstage View
The File tab in the upper left corner of the PowerPoint window replaces the Ofﬁce button from
PowerPoint 2007. Clicking it opens a full-screen File menu system, also known as Backstage view.
9

Part I: Building Your Presentation
From Backstage view, you can select ﬁle operations such as saving and printing, customizing
the interface, and sharing your work with others. Figure 1-6 shows Backstage view. To leave
Backstage view, click any other tab.
FIGURE 1-6

tion commands.

Better Support for Video Import and Editing
One of the features most asked for in PowerPoint has been support for more video ﬁle for-
mats, and PowerPoint 2010 has delivered it. PowerPoint 2010 supports a wide variety of formats
including QuickTime, Flash, Windows Media, and MP4. You can now also link video clips from
online sources such as YouTube.
Not only can you import motion video from a larger variety of sources than in earlier versions,
but you can also edit videos directly from within PowerPoint. For example, you can change the
brightness and contrast of a video, trim it to show only certain parts, add a bookmark in the
video clip (which you can then hyperlink to, to jump to a particular spot in the video quickly),
and more. Figure 1-7 shows the Format tab in PowerPoint 2010’s Video Tools.
10

Chapter 1: A First Look at PowerPoint
FIGURE 1-7
Enhanced video tools enable you to modify the video clip without leaving PowerPoint.
Output to Video and DVD
Another feature in high demand has been the ability to output a presentation directly to popular
video formats. In the past, people have had to resort to third-party solutions, but PowerPoint
2010 includes this capability built-in. You can now output your presentation to Windows Media
Video (.wmv) format, which can be played back by Windows Media Player or a variety of other
utilities.
Collaboration
Collaborating with others on a draft presentation is now easier to do. PowerPoint now includes
a Compare feature that includes revision tracking. With revision tracking you can see who has
made what changes to the presentation, and review each change individually to accept or reject
it, as shown in Figure 1-8.
Other Changes
Besides the major changes you’ve learned about in the preceding sections, there are also a num-
ber of smaller but still important improvements, including these:
 New photo editing tools allow you to apply artistic ﬁlters to pictures, remove backgrounds,
and crop with more precision.
 New transition effects are available in PowerPoint 2010, and they are now easier to apply,
thanks to the new Transitions tab on the Ribbon.
 You can now insert math equations into a presentation with the Microsoft Ofﬁce Equation
Editor. Equation editing was revamped in some of the other Ofﬁce applications in Ofﬁce
2007, but PowerPoint is only now getting the new and improved equation interface.
 You can customize the Ribbon by adding, removing, and rearranging commands and tabs.
This is a new feature across all of the Ofﬁce 2010 applications, and very welcome to power
users who like to control their working environment on-screen.
 Presentation broadcasting is much improved in PowerPoint 2010 because of its integration
with the Web-based PowerPoint Live service.

Comment
Learning Your Way around PowerPoint
Now that you have seen some of the potential uses for PowerPoint and toured the new features,
let’s get started using the program.
PowerPoint is one of the easiest and most powerful presentation programs available. You can
knock out a passable presentation in a shockingly short time by skimming through the chapters
in Parts I and II of the book, or you can spend some time with PowerPoint’s advanced features
to make a complex presentation that looks, reads, and works exactly the way you want.
Starting and Exiting PowerPoint
You can start PowerPoint just like any other program in Windows: from the Start menu. Follow
these steps:
1.
Click the Start button. The Start menu opens.
2.
Click All Programs.
12

Chapter 1: A First Look at PowerPoint
3.
Click Microsoft Ofﬁce.
4.
Click Microsoft PowerPoint 2010. The program starts.
If you have opened PowerPoint before, a shortcut to it might appear in the Recently Used Pro-
grams list, which is directly above the All Programs command on the Start menu. If you use
other applications more frequently than PowerPoint, PowerPoint may scroll off this list and you
therefore have to access it via the All Programs menu.
Tip
If you don’t want to worry about PowerPoint scrolling off the list of the most frequently used programs on
the Start menu, right-click PowerPoint’s name on the Start menu and choose Pin to Start Menu. PowerPoint
will then appear on the list at the top of the left column of the Start menu, as shown in Figure 1-9. To
remove it from there later, right-click it and choose Unpin from Start Menu. ■
FIGURE 1-9
A shortcut to PowerPoint might appear on the top level of the Start menu.
Right-click

When you are ready to leave PowerPoint, select File ➪Exit or click the Close (X) button in the
top-right corner of the PowerPoint window. (The File button is the orange tab in the top-left cor-
ner.) If you have any unsaved work, PowerPoint asks if you want to save your changes. Because
you have just been playing around in this chapter, you probably do not have anything to save
yet. (If you do have something to save, see Chapter 3 to learn more about saving.) Otherwise,
click No to decline to save your changes, and you’re outta there.

Part I: Building Your Presentation
Understanding the Screen Elements
PowerPoint’s interface is typical of any Windows program in many ways, but it also has some
special Ofﬁce 2010–speciﬁc features as well. The PowerPoint window contains these elements,
pointed out in Figure 1-10:
 Title bar: Identiﬁes the program running (PowerPoint) and the name of the active presen-
tation. If the window is not maximized, you can move the window by dragging the title
bar.
 Ribbon: Functions as a combination of menu bar and toolbar, offering tabbed ‘‘pages’’ of
buttons, lists, and commands. The next section describes it in more detail.
 File tab: Opens the File menu (Backstage view), from which you can open, save, print,
and start new presentations.
 Quick Access Toolbar: Contains shortcuts for some of the most common commands.
You can add your own favorites here as well.
 Minimize button: Shrinks the application window to a bar on the Windows taskbar; you
click its button on the taskbar to reopen it.
 Maximize/Restore button: If the window is maximized (full screen), it changes to win-
dowed (not full screen). If the window is not maximized, clicking here maximizes it.
 Close button: Closes the presentation. You may be prompted to save your changes, if you
made any.
 Work area: Where active PowerPoint slide(s) appear. Figure 1-10 shows it in Normal
view, but other views are available that make the work area appear differently.
Cross-Reference
See the section ‘‘Changing the View’’ later in this chapter for details. ■
 Status bar: Reports information about the presentation and provides shortcuts for chang-
ing the view and the zoom.
Note
Because this isn’t a Windows book, Windows controls are not covered in detail here. However, if you’re
interested in learning more about Windows-based programs in general, pick up Windows 7 For Dummies or
The Windows 7 Bible, also published by Wiley. Windows Vista and Windows XP versions of these books are
also available. ■
Working with the Ribbon
As mentioned earlier in the chapter, PowerPoint 2010’s user interface is based on the Ribbon,
which is a bar across the top of the window that contains tabbed pages of commands and but-
tons. Rather than opening a menu and selecting a command, you click a tab and then click a
button or open a list on that tab.

 File tab: A tab-like button that opens Backstage view, from which you can choose to start
a new presentation, save, print, and perform other ﬁle-related activities. See Figure 1-10
for this button’s location.
 Quick Access Toolbar: A small toolbar adjacent to the Ofﬁce button from which you can
select commonly used commands.
Tip
To add a command to the Quick Access Toolbar, right-click the toolbar and choose Add to Quick Access
Toolbar. To remove the command from there, right-click the command icon and choose Remove from
Quick Access Toolbar. ■
15

Part I: Building Your Presentation
 Tab: A tabbed page of the Ribbon. Figure 1-11 shows the Home tab, for example.
 Contextual tab: A tab that appears only when certain content is selected, such as a
graphic or a chart. The context name appears above the tab name. In Figure 1-11, Drawing
Tools is the context name for the Format tab.
FIGURE 1-11

launcher
 Group: A section of a tab. The Home tab shown in Figure 1-11 has the following groups:
Clipboard, Slides, Font, Paragraph, Drawing, and Editing.
 Dialog box launcher: A small icon in the bottom-right corner of a group, from which you
can open a dialog box related to that group.
Note
To ﬁnd out what a toolbar button does, point the mouse at it. A ScreenTip pops up explaining it. ■
Working with Collapsible Tab Groups
Within a tab, groups can expand or collapse depending on the width of the PowerPoint window.
When the window is large enough (somewhere around 1100 pixels), everything within each
group is fully expanded, so that each item has its own button. When the window is smaller,
groups start collapsing so that all groups remain visible. At ﬁrst, large buttons get smaller
and stack vertically; if that’s not enough, then groups collapse into single large buttons with
drop-down lists from which you can select the individual commands. Figure 1-12 shows the
same tab in three different widths for comparison.
Caution
Because of the Ribbon’s collapsing ability, the exact steps for performing certain procedures depend on the
active PowerPoint window’s width. A small window may require an extra step of opening a button’s menu
to select a command, for example. For a large window, each command appears directly on the tab. This
book assumes an average window size of 1024 x 768 pixels; if you run PowerPoint at a smaller resolution,
you may occasionally have an extra step to access a command. ■
16

Chapter 1: A First Look at PowerPoint
FIGURE 1-12
The size of the PowerPoint window determines how much the groups are collapsed or expanded
on the Ribbon.
Working with Backstage View
When you open Backstage view by clicking the File tab, a multilayered menu system appears.
Many of the commands along the left side of the screen are categories that open submenus when
you click them. For example, in Figure 1-13, the Share command has been selected, revealing
additional choices.
The top-level categories and commands in Backstage view are:
 Save: Saves the current presentation.
 Save As: Saves the current presentation and prompts you for ﬁle name and location infor-
mation, even if the ﬁle has been previously saved.
 Open: Displays the Open dialog box, from which you can select a ﬁle to open.
 Close: Closes the active presentation.
 Info: Displays information about the current presentation, including its properties. Com-
mands are available for working with versions, permissions, and sharing.
 Recent: Displays a list of recently opened presentations, from which you can quickly
reopen one.
 New: Displays a list of templates available for starting a new presentation.
 Print: Provides access to printing options, including setting a print range, choosing a
printer, and specifying settings like color and collation.
 Save & Send: Offers access to features for distributing the presentation via e-mail or fax,
changing the presentation type, creating PDF and XPS ﬁles, and publishing/packaging the
presentation.
 Help: Opens a list of Help options, including links to the PowerPoint help ﬁle, online
resources, and updates.
17

Part I: Building Your Presentation
 Options: Click here to open a dialog box where you can customize the interface, also
described in Chapter 24.
 Exit: Choose this command to exit PowerPoint, as you learned earlier in the chapter.
FIGURE 1-13
In Backstage view, most of the main commands open a submenu or a dialog box.
Working with Dialog Boxes
PowerPoint sometimes uses dialog boxes to prompt you for more information. When you issue
a command that can have many possible variations, a dialog box appears so you can specify the
particulars.
A dialog box can be modal or non-modal. A modal dialog box must be closed before you can
continue working on the presentation. A non-modal dialog box can be left open indeﬁnitely as
you work. Most of the dialog boxes in PowerPoint 2010 are non-modal.
Figure 1-14 illustrates some of the controls you may encounter in PowerPoint’s dialog boxes:
 Check box: These are individual on/off switches for particular features. Click to toggle
them on or off.
18

Chapter 1: A First Look at PowerPoint
 Option buttons: Each section of the dialog box can have only one option button chosen at
once. When you select one option button, the previously selected one becomes deselected,
like on a car radio. Click the one you want.
 Increment buttons: Placed next to a text box, these buttons allow you to increment the
number in the box up or down by one digit per click.
 Drop-down list: Click the down arrow next to one of these to open the list, and then click
your selection from the menu that appears.
 Command button: Click one of these big rectangular buttons to jump to a different dia-
log box. OK and Cancel are also command buttons; OK accepts your changes and Cancel
rejects them.
In Figure 1-14, there are categories along the left side of the dialog box. Click a category to
change to a different ‘‘page’’ of options. You might also sometimes see tabs at the top of a dialog
box, which serve the same purpose.
Cross-Reference
Dialog boxes that open or save ﬁles have some special controls and icons all their own, but you learn about

Part I: Building Your Presentation
Changing the View
A view is a way of displaying your presentation on-screen. PowerPoint comes with several views
because at different times during the creation process, it is helpful to look at the presentation in
different ways. For example, when you add a graphic to a slide, you need to work closely with
that slide, but when you rearrange the slide order, you need to see the presentation as a whole.
PowerPoint offers the following views:
 Normal: A combination of several resizable panes, so you can see the presentation in mul-
tiple ways at once. Normal is the default view.
 Slide Sorter: A light-table-type overhead view of all the slides in your presentation, laid
out in rows, suitable for big-picture rearranging.
 Notes Page: A view with the slide at the top of the page and a text box below it for typed
notes. (You can print these notes pages to use during your speech.)
 Slide Show: The view you use to show the presentation on-screen. Each slide ﬁlls the
entire screen in its turn.
 Reading View: A simpliﬁed version of Slide Show view, which appears in a window rather
than full-screen. This view is new in PowerPoint 2010.
Cross-Reference
This chapter covers only the ﬁve regular views. The Master views are discussed in Chapter 5. ■
There are two ways to change a view: Click a button on the View tab, or click one of the view
buttons in the bottom-right corner of the screen, as shown in Figure 1-15. All of the views are
available in both places except the Notes Page, which you can access only from the View tab,
and Slide Show, which you can access only from the buttons or from the Slide Show tab (From
Beginning or From Current Slide).
Tip
When you save, close, and reopen a ﬁle, PowerPoint opens the same view in which you left the ﬁle. To
have the ﬁles always open in a particular view, choose File ➪Options ➪Advanced, and open the Open All
Documents Using This View list and select the desired view. The options on this list include some custom
versions of Normal view that have certain panes turned off. For example, you can open all documents in
Normal – Outline and Slide view to always start with the Notes pane turned off. ■
Normal View
Normal view, shown in Figure 1-16, is a very ﬂexible view that contains a little bit of everything.
In the center is the active slide, below it is a Notes pane, and to its left is a dual-use pane with
two tabs: Slides and Outline. (Figure 1-15 shows the Slides tab, and Figure 1-16 shows the Out-
line tab.) When the Outline tab is selected, the text from the slides appears in an outline form.
20

Chapter 1: A First Look at PowerPoint
When the Slides tab is selected, thumbnail images of all the slides appear (somewhat like Slide
Sorter view, which you will see later in this chapter).
FIGURE 1-15
Select a view from the View tab or from the viewing controls in the bottom-right corner of the
screen.

Reading

Each of the panes in Normal view has its own scroll bar, so you can move around in the outline,
the slide, and the notes independently of the other panes. You can resize the panes by dragging
the dividers between the panes. For example, to give the notes area more room, point the mouse
pointer at the divider line between it and the slide area so that the mouse pointer becomes a
double-headed arrow, and then hold down the left mouse button as you drag the line up to a
new spot.
The Slides/Outline pane is useful because it lets you jump quickly to a speciﬁc slide by clicking
on it. For example, you can click on any of the slide thumbnails on the Slides tab to display it in
the Slide pane, as shown in Figure 1-15. You can also click on some text anywhere in the outline
to jump to the slide containing that text, as shown in Figure 1-16.
21

Tip
In Microsoft Word, an Outlining toolbar is available when you are working on an outline. In PowerPoint,
some of those same tools are available, but in a different location. You can right-click anywhere in the
Outline pane to access those tools on a context menu, such as expanding and collapsing outline levels and
reordering items. ■
You can turn the Slides/Outline pane off completely by clicking the X button in its top-right
corner. This gives maximum room to the Slides pane. When you turn it off, the Notes pane dis-
appears too. To get the extra panes back, reapply Normal view.
Slide Sorter View
If you have ever worked with 35mm slides, you know that it can be helpful to lay the slides
out on a big table and plan the order in which to show them. You rearrange them, moving this
one here, that one there, until the order is perfect. You might even start a pile of backups that
you will not show in the main presentation, but will hold back in case someone asks a pertinent
question. That’s exactly what you can do with Slide Sorter view, as shown in Figure 1-17. It
22

Chapter 1: A First Look at PowerPoint
lays out the slides in miniature, so you can see the big picture. You can drag the slides around
and place them in the perfect order. You can also return to Normal view to work on a slide by
double-clicking the slide.
FIGURE 1-17
Use the Slide Sorter view for a birds-eye view of the presentation.
Slide Show View
When it’s time to rehearse the presentation, nothing shows you the ﬁnished product quite as
clearly as Slide Show view does. In Slide Show view, the slide ﬁlls the entire screen. You can
move from slide to slide by pressing the Page Up or Page Down keys, or by using one of the
other movement methods available (see Figure 1-18).
Cross-Reference
You learn about these other movement methods in Chapter 20. ■
23

Part I: Building Your Presentation
You can right-click in Slide Show view to display a menu that enables you to control the show
without leaving it. To leave the slide show, choose End Show from the menu or just press the
Esc key.

Tip
When entering Slide Show view, the method you use determines which slide you start on. If you use the
Slide Show View button in the bottom-right corner of the screen, the presentation will start with what-
ever slide you have selected. (You can also press Shift+F5 to do this, or choose Slide Show ➪From Current
Slide.) If you use the Slide Show ➪From Beginning command, or press F5, the presentation will start at the
beginning. ■
Notes Page View
When you give a presentation, your props usually include more than just your brain and your
slides. You typically have all kinds of notes and backup material for each slide — ﬁgures on
last quarter’s sales, sources to cite if someone questions your data, and so on. In the old days
of framed overhead transparencies, people used to attach sticky notes to the slide frames for this
purpose and hope that nobody asked any questions that required diving into the four-inch-thick
stack of statistics they brought.
Today, you can type your notes and supporting facts directly in PowerPoint. As you saw earlier,
you can type them directly into the Notes pane below the slide in Normal view. However, if you
have a lot of notes to type, you might ﬁnd it easier to work with Notes Page view instead.
Notes Page view is accessible only from the View tab. In this view, you see a single slide (uned-
itable) with an editable text area below it called the notes placeholder, which you can use to type
your notes. See Figure 1-19. You can refer to these notes as you give an on-screen presenta-
tion, or you can print notes pages to stack neatly on the lectern next to you during the big
event. If your notes pages run off the end of the page, PowerPoint even prints them as a sepa-
rate page. If you have trouble seeing the text you’re typing, zoom in on it, as described in the
next section.
24

Chapter 1: A First Look at PowerPoint
FIGURE 1-19
Notes Page view offers a special text area for your notes, separate from the slides.
Zooming In and Out
If you need a closer look at your presentation, you can zoom the view in or out to accommo-
date almost any situation. For example, if you have trouble placing a graphic exactly at the same
vertical level as some text in a box next to it, you can zoom in for more precision. You can view
your work at various magniﬁcations on-screen without changing the size of the surrounding tools
or the size of the print on the printout.
In Normal view, each of the panes has its own individual zoom. To set the zoom for the
Slides/Outline pane only, for example, select it ﬁrst; then choose a zoom level. Or to zoom only
in the main workspace (the Slide pane), click it ﬁrst. In a single-pane view such as Notes Page
or Slide Sorter, a single zoom setting affects the entire work area.
The larger the zoom number, the larger the details on the display. A zoom of 10% would make
a slide so tiny that you couldn’t read it. A zoom of 400% would make a few letters on a slide so
big they would ﬁll the entire pane.
25

Part I: Building Your Presentation
The easiest way to set the zoom level is to drag the Zoom slider in the bottom-right corner of the
PowerPoint window, or click its plus or minus buttons to change the zoom level in increments,
as shown in Figure 1-20.
FIGURE 1-20

Current Zoom
Fit to Window
To resize the current slide so that it is as large as possible while still ﬁtting completely in the
Slides pane, click the Fit Slide to Current Window button, or Choose View ➪Fit to Window.
Another way to control the zoom is with the Zoom dialog box. Choose View ➪Zoom to open it.
(You can also open that dialog box by clicking the % next to the Zoom slider in the lower right
corner of the screen.) Make your selection, as shown in Figure 1-21, by clicking the appropriate
button, and then click OK. Notice that you can type a precise zoom percentage in the Percent
text box. You can specify any percentage you like, up to 400%. (Some panes and views will not
go higher than 100%.)
FIGURE 1-21
You can zoom with this Zoom dialog box rather than the slider if you prefer.
Enabling Optional Display Elements
PowerPoint has a lot of optional screen elements that you may (or may not) ﬁnd useful, depend-
ing on what you’re up to at the moment. The following sections describe them.
26

Chapter 1: A First Look at PowerPoint
Ruler
Vertical and horizontal rulers around the slide pane can help you place objects more precisely.
To toggle them on or off, select or deselect the Ruler check box on the View tab, as shown in
Figure 1-22. Rulers are available only in Normal and Notes Page views.
FIGURE 1-22
Gridlines and the ruler help align objects on a slide.

The rulers help with positioning no matter what content type you are working with, but when
you are editing text in a text frame they have an additional purpose as well. The horizontal ruler
shows the frame’s paragraph indents and any custom tab stops, and you can drag the indent
markers on the ruler just as you can in Word.
Note
The ruler’s unit of measure is controlled from the Regional Settings in the Control Panel in Windows. ■
Tip
The vertical ruler is optional. To disable it while retaining the horizontal ruler, choose File ➪Options, click
Advanced, and in the Display section, clear the Show Vertical Ruler check box. ■
27

Part I: Building Your Presentation
Gridlines
Gridlines are non-printing dotted lines at regularly spaced intervals that can help you line up
objects on a slide. Figure 1-22 shows gridlines (and the ruler) enabled.
To turn gridlines on or off, use either of these methods:
 Press Shift+F9.
 On the View tab, in the Show group, select or deselect the Gridlines check box.
Choose Home ➪Align ➪View Gridlines. There are many options you can set for the gridlines,
including whether objects snap to it, whether the grid is visible, and what the spacing should be
between the gridlines. To set grid options, follow these steps:
1.
On the Home tab, in the Drawing group, choose Arrange ➪Align ➪Grid Settings, or
right-click the slide background and choose Grid and Guides. The Grid and Guides dialog
box opens (see Figure 1-23).
2.
In the Snap To section, select or deselect these check boxes:
 Snap Objects to Grid: Speciﬁes whether or not objects will automatically align with the
grid.
 Snap Objects to Other Objects: Speciﬁes whether or not objects will automatically align
with other objects.
3.
In the Grid Settings section, enter the amount of space between gridlines desired.
4.
Select or deselect the Display Grid On Screen check box to display or hide the grid. (Note
that you can make objects snap to the grid without the grid being displayed.)
5.
Click OK.
FIGURE 1-23
Set grid options and spacing.

Chapter 1: A First Look at PowerPoint
Guides
Guides are like gridlines except they are individual lines, rather than a grid of lines, and you can
drag them to different positions on the slide. As you drag a guide, a numeric indicator appears
to let you know the ruler position, as shown in Figure 1-24. Use the Grid and Guides dialog box
shown in Figure 1-24 to turn guides on/off, or press Alt+F9.
FIGURE 1-24
Guides are movable, non-printing lines that help with alignment.

(being dragged)
You can create additional sets of guide lines by holding down the Ctrl key while dragging a
guide (to copy it). You can have as many horizontal and vertical guides as you like, all at posi-
tions you specify.
Color/Grayscale/Pure Black and White Views
Most of the time you will work with your presentation in color. However, if you plan to print
the presentation in black and white or grayscale (for example, on black-and-white handouts),
you should check to see what it will look like without color.
Tip
This Color/Grayscale/Pure Black and White option is especially useful when you are preparing slides that
will eventually be faxed, because a fax is pure black and white in most cases. Something that looks great on
a color screen could look like a shapeless blob on a black-and-white fax. It doesn’t hurt to check. ■
29

Part I: Building Your Presentation
Click the Grayscale or the Pure Black and White button on the View tab to switch to one of
those views. When you do so, a Grayscale or Black and White tab becomes available, as shown
in Figure 1-25. From its Setting group, you can ﬁne-tune the grayscale or black-and-white pre-
view. Choose one that shows the object to best advantage; PowerPoint will remember that setting
when printing or outputting the presentation to a grayscale or black-and-white source.
FIGURE 1-25
Select a grayscale or a black-and-white preview type.
When you are ﬁnished, click the Back to Color View button on the Grayscale tab. Changing the
Black and White or Grayscale settings doesn’t affect the colors on the slides; it only affects how
the slides will look and print in black and white or grayscale.
Opening a New Display Window
Have you ever wished you could be in two places at once? Well, in PowerPoint, you actually can.
PowerPoint provides a way to view two spots in the presentation at the same time by opening a
new window.
To display a new window, display the View tab and click New Window in the Window group.
Then use Arrange All or Cascade to view both windows at once.
You can use any view with any window, so you can have two slides in Normal view at once, or
Slide Sorter and Notes Pages view, or any other combination. Both windows contain the same
presentation, so any changes you make in one window are reﬂected in the other window.
Arranging Windows
When you have two or more windows open, whether they are for the same presentation or dif-
ferent ones, you need to arrange them for optimal viewing. You saw earlier in this chapter how
to resize a window, but did you know that PowerPoint can do some of the arranging for you?
When you want to arrange the open windows, do one of the following:
 Tile: On the View tab, click Arrange All to tile the open windows so there is no overlap.
 Cascade: On the View tab, click Cascade to arrange the open windows so that the title
bars cascade from upper-left to lower-right on the screen. Click a title bar to activate a
window.
These commands do not apply to minimized windows. If you want to include a window in the
arrangement, make sure you restore it from its minimized state ﬁrst.
30

Chapter 1: A First Look at PowerPoint
Switching among Windows
If you have more than one window open and can see at least a corner of the window you want,
click it to bring it to the front. If you have one of the windows maximized, on the other hand,
or if another window is obscuring the one you want, click Switch Windows (on the View tab)
and select the window you want to view.
Using the Help System
The PowerPoint Help system is like a huge instruction book in electronic format. You can
look up almost any PowerPoint task you can imagine and get step-by-step instructions for per-
forming it.
To open the PowerPoint Help window, choose File ➪Help ➪Microsoft Ofﬁce Help, or press F1,
or click the Help icon (the question mark) in the upper-right corner of the PowerPoint window,
as shown in Figure 1-26.

To look up information in the Help system, you can:
 Click one of the topics on the default Browse PowerPoint 2010 Help page shown in
Figure 1-26, and then keep clicking subtopics to narrow down the search until you arrive
at what you want.
 Type a keyword or phrase in the Search box, and then click Search or press Enter to ﬁnd
all Help articles that contain it.
Tip
Much of the Ofﬁce 2010 Help system relies on an Internet connection. By default, Ofﬁce 2010 applications
automatically connect to Microsoft’s servers online to gather additional Help information. If you have a
slow Internet connection, and ﬁnd that searches are slow, try disabling online Help so that PowerPoint just
uses the Help ﬁles installed on your PC. To do this, from the PowerPoint Help window, click the connection
status indicator (see Figure 1-26), and from the menu that appears, choose Show Content Only From This
Computer. ■
When you browse or search the Help system, a list of articles matching the topic or search term
appears. Click an article to read it. Figure 1-27 shows an article on saving ﬁles, for example.
FIGURE 1-27
A typical article in the Help system contains some background information and step-by-step
instructions.

Using PowerPoint Support Resources

can diagnose problems with your PowerPoint installation, for example, download updates, regis-
ter your copy of PowerPoint, and more.
To access these tools, follow these steps:
1.
Choose File ➪Help.
2.
Click the button for the option you want to access. These are summarized in Table 1-2.

Check for Updates
Connects to the Ofﬁce Web site, runs a utility that evaluates the dates on
your current Ofﬁce ﬁles, and downloads and installs updates if available.
Understanding Product Activation
All Ofﬁce 2010 products must be activated after a certain number of days or a certain number of
uses. This is a simple matter if you have an Internet connection. Every time you start an Ofﬁce
2010 application, a reminder to activate appears. Follow the prompts to activate it. You do not
have to give any personal information.
So what is this activation, and why is it required? Activation locks your copy of Ofﬁce (or
PowerPoint, if you bought it separately) to the hardware conﬁguration in your computer, so that
it can’t be installed on any other PC.
The activation utility surveys a sampling of your PC’s hardware (around a dozen different com-
ponents), and based on their models, serial numbers, and so on, it comes up with a number.
Then it combines that number mathematically with the 24-digit installation key code you entered
when you installed the software, to produce a unique number that represents that particular
copy of Ofﬁce combined with that particular PC. It then sends that number off to an activation
database at Microsoft, along with the original installation key code.
So how does this prevent illegal software copying? Two ways. One is that the installation key
code is locked to that hardware ID, so that if you install the same copy on a different PC, it can’t
be activated there. (This is not the case for some corporate and volume-licensed copies.) The
other is that it prevents you from radically changing the hardware in the PC without contacting
Microsoft for reactivation authorization. For example, you could not take the hard disk out of
the PC and put it in another PC without reactivating Ofﬁce.
It is this second point that has been an issue of conﬂict between Microsoft and users, because
many users like to tinker with their hardware and they do not want to have to contact Microsoft
every time they make hardware changes. According to Microsoft documentation, the change of
34

Chapter 1: A First Look at PowerPoint
one or two pieces of hardware will not trigger the need for reactivation, but your experience may
differ. Even if you are prompted to reactivate, you can usually reactivate a legitimate installation
via phone with no problems.
There are two situations in which you might not have to activate:
 When you buy a new PC with Ofﬁce preinstalled. Ofﬁce will already have been activated,
so you do not have to go through the process.
 If you work for a company or attend a school that has a licensing agreement with Microsoft
for a certain number of copies. You might have a version of Ofﬁce that does not contain
the activation requirement.
When you go through the activation process, you are also asked whether you want to register
your copy of the software. Activation by itself sends no identifying information about you or
your PC to Microsoft; if you want to be on the Microsoft mailing list for update information, you
must go through the additional process of registration.
Adjusting Privacy Settings
In some situations, it is advantageous for your copy of PowerPoint to communicate with
Microsoft over the Internet. For example, when you use the Help system, you get better results
if you are connected, and when inserting clip art, you have more images to choose from if you
are connected.
It’s a two-way street: your copy of PowerPoint can also help Microsoft by sending information to
the company about your usage habits. For example, when Microsoft is developing a new version
of PowerPoint, they look at usage data to determine which features of the program people are
using the most and the least. This program for gathering user data is the Customer Experience
Improvement Program, and participation in it is optional.
To control whether — and how — your copy of PowerPoint interacts online with Microsoft,
follow these steps to conﬁgure Privacy Options:
1.
Choose File ➪Options.
2.
Click Trust Center, and then click the Trust Center Settings button. The Trust Center
dialog box opens.
3.
Click Privacy Options, and then select or deselect any of the check boxes in the Privacy
Options section. See Figure 1-28. To get information about each of the options, point to
the ‘‘i’’ symbol to its right.
4.
Click OK, and then OK again to close all open dialog boxes.

W
ow! What a great presentation! That’s what you want your audi-
ence to come away thinking, right?
Most people won’t be nit-picky enough to pinpoint exactly what they loved
about the experience. Nobody is likely to say, ‘‘Weren’t the colors in that pie
chart on slide 43 artfully chosen?’’ or ‘‘Did you see his tie? I wonder where
I can buy one just like it.’’ Instead, you’ll leave your audience with an over-
all impression that they gather from a host of little details, from the color
scheme on your slides to the anecdotes and jokes you tell.
You can turn off your computer for this chapter, because you won’t need
it to follow along. In this chapter, I’ll present some strategies for planning
the best presentation ever. I’ll provide an 11-point action plan for building
your presentation ﬁle, and address some of the ‘‘soft’’ topics that can make
or break a show, such as how to arrange a room, what to wear, where to
stand, and more.
Qualities of an Effective
Presentation
What separates an effective presentation from an ineffective one? No, it’s not
just a gut feeling; there are proven attributes for which you can strive. The
rest of this chapter elaborates on these points, but here’s a quick overview of
what to work on.
37

Part I: Building Your Presentation
An effective presentation:
 Is designed and formatted appropriately for the audience and the medium.
 Is tightly focused on its subject, with extraneous facts trimmed away or hidden for backup
use.
 Uses the right PowerPoint theme, with colors and fonts chosen to reinforce the message of
the presentation.
 Includes the right amount of text on each slide, without overcrowding.
 Uses artwork purposefully to convey information and create an overall visual impression.
 Uses charts rather than raw columns of numbers to present ﬁnancial or numeric informa-
tion.
 Employs sound and video to create interest where needed, but does not allow the effects to
dominate the show.
 Uses animations and transitions if appropriate for the audience and message, but does not
allow them to dominate.
 Offers the audience handouts that contain the information they will want to take with
them.
 Leaves time at the end for a question-and-answer session so the audience members can
clarify any points they were confused about.
Now that you know what the goal is, how do you get there? The following section outlines a
precise, step-by-step action plan for developing a presentation that has these qualities.
Developing Your Presentation Action Plan
Can you guess what the single biggest problem is when most people use PowerPoint? Here’s a
hint: It’s not a problem with the software at all. It’s that they don’t think things through carefully
before they create their presentation, and then they have to go back and make major modiﬁca-
tions later. You’ve probably heard the saying, ‘‘If you don’t have time to do it right, how are you
going to ﬁnd time to do it over?’’ This sentiment is certainly applicable to creating presentations.
In the following sections, I outline a strategy for creating the appropriate PowerPoint presenta-
tion right from the start. By considering the issues addressed here, you can avoid making false
assumptions about your audience and their needs, and so avoid creating a beautiful presentation
with some horrible ﬂaw that makes it unusable. By spending a half-hour or so in this chapter,
you can save yourself literally days in rework later.
Step 1: Identifying Your Audience and Purpose
Before you can think about the presentation you need to create, you must ﬁrst think of
your audience. As you probably already know from real-life experience, different audiences
respond to different presentation types. For example, a sales pitch to a client requires a
38

Chapter 2: What Makes a Great Presentation?
very different approach than an informational brieﬁng to your coworkers. Ask yourself these
questions:
 How many people will be attending the presentation? The attendance makes a differ-
ence because the larger the group, the larger your screen needs to be so that everyone can
see. If you don’t have access to a large screen, you have to make the lettering and charts big
and chunky so that everyone can read your presentation.
 What is the average age of the attendees? Although it’s difﬁcult to generalize about
people, it’s especially important to keep your presentation light and entertaining when
you’re presenting to a very young audience (teens and children). Generally speaking, the
older the audience, the more authoritative you need to be.
 What role will the audience take in relation to the topic? If you are rolling out a new
product or system, the managerial staff will likely want a general overview of it, but the
line workers who will actually be operating the product need a lot of details. Generally
speaking, the higher the level of managers, the more removed they will be from the action,
and the fewer details of operation they need.
 How well does the audience already know the topic? If you are presenting to a group
that knows nothing about your topic, you want to keep things basic and make sure that
you deﬁne all of the unfamiliar terms. In contrast, with a group of experts, you are likely
to have many follow-up questions after the main presentation, and so you should plan on
having some hidden backup slides ready in anticipation of those questions. See Chapter 20
for more on hiding slides for backup use.
 Does the audience care about the topic? If the topic is personally important to the
attendees (such as information on their insurance beneﬁts or vacation schedule), they will
likely pay attention even if your presentation is plain and straightforward. However, if you
must win them over, you need to spend more time on the bells and whistles.
 Are the attendees prejudiced either positively or negatively toward the topic? Keep-
ing in mind the audience’s preconceived ideas can make the difference between success
and failure in some presentations. For example, knowing that a client hates sales pitches
can help you to tailor your own presentation to be out of the ordinary.
 Are the attendees in a hurry? Do your attendees have all afternoon to listen to you, or do
they need to get back to their regular jobs? Nothing is more frustrating than sitting through
a leisurely presentation when you’re watching precious minutes tick away. Know your
audience’s schedule and their preference for quick versus thorough coverage.
Next, think about what you want the outcome of the presentation to be. Although you might
want more than one outcome, you should try to identify the primary one as your main goal.
Some outcomes to consider include the following:
 Audience feels good about the topic: Some presentations are strictly cheerleading ses-
sions, designed to sway the audience’s opinion. Don’t discount this objective — it’s a per-
fectly legitimate reason to make a presentation! For example, suppose a new manage-
ment staff has taken over a factory. The new management team might want to reassure
the workers that everything is going to be okay. A feel-good, Welcome to the Team presen-
tation, complete with gimmicks such as company T-shirts or hats, can go a long way in
this regard.

Part I: Building Your Presentation
 Audience is informed: Sometimes you need to convey information to a group of peo-
ple, and no decision is involved on their part. For example, suppose your company has
switched insurance carriers and you want to let all of the employees know about their new
beneﬁts. An informational presentation can cover most of the common questions and save
your human resources people a lot of time in answering the same questions over and over.
 Audience members make individual decisions: This presentation is a kind of sales
pitch in which you are pitching an idea or product to a group, but each person says yes
or no individually. For example, suppose you are selling timeshare vacation condos. You
may give a presentation to a group of 100 people in an attempt to sell your package to at
least a few members of the group.
This presentation type can also have an informational ﬂavor; you are informing people
about their choices without pushing one choice or the other. For example, if your employ-
ees have a choice of health plans, you might present the pros and cons of each plan and
then leave it to each employee to make a selection.
 Audience makes a group decision: This is the kind of presentation that scares a lot of
people. You face a group of people who will confer and make a single decision, based on
the information you present. Most sales pitches fall into this category. For example, you
might be explaining your product to a group of managers to try to get their company to
buy it.
Think about these factors carefully and try to come up with a single statement that summarizes
your audience and purpose. Here are some examples:
 I am presenting to 100 factory workers to explain their new health insurance choices and teach
them how to ﬁll out the necessary forms.
 I am presenting to a group of six to ten mid-level managers, trying to get them to decide as a
group to buy my product.
 I am presenting to a group of 20 professors to convince at least some of them to use my company’s
textbooks in their classes.
 I am presenting to individual Internet users to explain how my company’s service works.
Let’s take that ﬁrst example. Figure 2-1 shows some notes that a presenter might make when
preparing to explain information about employee beneﬁts enrollment to a group of factory work-
ers. Jot down your own notes before moving to step 2.
Step 2: Choosing Your Presentation Method
You essentially have three ways to present your presentation to your audience, and you need to
pick the way that you’re going to use up front. These methods include speaker-led, self-running,
and user-interactive. Within each of those three broad categories, you have some additional
choices. Before you start creating the presentation in PowerPoint, you should know which
method you are going to use because it makes a big difference in the text and other objects that
you put on the slides.
40

FIGURE 2-1
Make notes about your presentation’s purpose and audience.
Speaker-Led Presentations
The speaker-led presentation is the traditional type of presentation: You stand up in front of a
live audience (or one connected through teleconferencing) and give a speech. The slides that you
create in PowerPoint become your support materials. The primary message comes from you, and
the slides and handouts are just helpers.
With this kind of presentation, your slides don’t have to tell the whole story. Each slide can con-
tain just a few main points, and you can ﬂesh out each point in your discussion. In fact, this
kind of presentation works best when your slides don’t contain a lot of information, because
people pay more attention to you, the speaker, if they’re not trying to read at the same time. For
example, instead of listing the top ﬁve reasons to switch to your service, you might have a slide
that just reads: Why Switch? Five Reasons. The audience has to listen to you to ﬁnd out what the
reasons are.
This kind of presentation also requires some special planning. For example, do you want to
send each audience member home with handouts? If so, you need to prepare them. They may
or may not be identical to your PowerPoint slides; that’s up to you. You also need to learn how
to handle PowerPoint’s presentation controls. It can be really embarrassing to be ﬁddling with
the computer controls in the middle of a speech, and so you should practice, practice, practice
ahead of time.
41

Part I: Building Your Presentation
Cross-Reference
Handouts and other support materials (such as cards for speaker notes) are covered in Chapter 19. For more
on PowerPoint presentation controls, see Chapter 20. ■
Self-Running Presentations
With a self-running presentation, all of the rules change. Instead of using the slides as teasers
or support materials, you must make the slides carry the entire show. All of the information
must be right there, because you won’t be looking over the audience’s shoulders with helpful
narration.
In general, self-running presentations are presented to individuals or very small groups. For
example, you might set up a kiosk in a busy lobby or a booth at a trade show and have a brief
but constantly running presentation of perhaps ﬁve slides that explains your product or service.
Because there is no dynamic human being keeping the audience’s attention, self-running presen-
tations must include attention-getting features. Sounds, video clips, interesting transitions, and
prerecorded narratives are all good ways to attract viewers.
You must also consider the timing in a self-running presentation. Because there is no way for a
viewer to tell the presentation, ‘‘Okay, I’m done reading this slide; bring on the next one,’’ you
must carefully plan how long each slide will remain on-screen. This kind of timing requires some
practice!
Cross-Reference
Part III explains how to use sounds, videos, and other moving objects in a presentation to add interest.
Chapter 21 deals with timing issues that are associated with a self-running presentation, as well as how
to record voice-over narration. ■
User-Interactive Presentations
A user-interactive presentation is like a self-running presentation, except that the viewer has
some input. Rather than standing passively by, the viewer can tell PowerPoint when to advance a
slide. Depending on the presentation’s setup, viewers may also be able to move around in the
presentation (perhaps to skip over topics that do not interest them) and request more infor-
mation. This type of presentation is typically addressed to a single user at a time, rather than
a group, and is usually distributed over the Internet, a company intranet, or via CD.
The user runs the presentation using either PowerPoint or a free program called PowerPoint
Viewer that you can provide for download. You can also translate a PowerPoint presentation
to HTML format (the native format for World Wide Web pages), so that anyone with a Web
browser can view it. However, presentations may lose some of their features when you save them
in Web format, so consider the decision carefully.
Cross-Reference
Chapter 21 explains how to place action buttons on slides so that the viewer can control the
action. Chapter 22 covers some of the issues involved in preparing a presentation for mass distribution. ■
42

Chapter 2: What Makes a Great Presentation?
Step 3: Choosing Your Delivery Method
Whereas the presentation method is the general conceptual way that the audience interacts with
the information, the delivery method is the way that you deliver that interaction. It’s a subtle
but important difference. For example, suppose that you have decided to use a speaker-led pre-
sentation method. That’s the big picture, but how will you deliver it? Will you present from a
computer, or use 35mm slides, or overhead transparencies, or just plain old handouts? All of
these methods fall under the big umbrella of ‘‘speaker-led.’’
PowerPoint gives you a lot of options for your delivery method. Some of these options are more
appropriate for speaker-led shows, while others can be used for any presentation method. Here
are some of the choices:
 Computer show through PowerPoint: You can use PowerPoint’s Slide Show view to
play the slides on a computer screen. If necessary, you can also hook up a large, external
monitor to the PC so that the audience can see it better. This setup requires that Power-
Point (or the PowerPoint Viewer utility) be installed on the computer at the presentation
site. This method works for speaker-led, self-running, or user-interactive shows.
 Computer show through a Web site: You can save your presentation in Web format and
then publish it to a Web site. You can use this method for speaker-led, self-running, or
user-interactive shows, and no special software is required — just a Web browser. How-
ever, you lose some of the cool graphical effects, including some transitions and animation
effects. Web delivery is used mostly for self-running or user-interactive shows.
 Computer show on CD: You can create a CD that contains both the presentation and the
PowerPoint Viewer utility. The presentation starts automatically when the viewer inserts
the CD into a PC. This method is most useful for self-running or user-interactive shows
 Broadcast: You can broadcast your presentation on the Internet, so that others can view
it on their own computers in real-time. Presentation broadcasting has been improved in
PowerPoint 2010, and is covered in Chapter 22.
 Video clip: You can output your presentation to a movie ﬁle that can be played using a
variety of media players. Videos can be distributed on CD or DVD, online, or via e-mail.
 Overhead transparencies: You can create overhead transparencies, which are just clear
sheets, on most printers. During your presentation, you place them on an overhead projec-
tor one at a time.
Caution
Be careful that the transparencies that you buy are designed for your printer! For example, inkjet trans-
parencies will melt in a laser printer. ■
 35mm slides: A somewhat outdated method, but still viable if computer equipment is
unavailable. 35mm slides look good, and transport well in carousels, but you lose all your
special effects, such as animation and sounds.
 Paper: If there is no projection media available, then your last resort is to distribute your
slides to the audience on paper. If you give them handouts, these handouts should be a
supplement to an on-screen show, and not the main show themselves.
43

Part I: Building Your Presentation
Cross-Reference
Chapter 19 covers printing, both on paper and on transparencies. See Chapter 21 for more on self-running
presentations. ■
Step 4: Choosing a Theme That Matches
Your Medium
PowerPoint comes with so many themes and templates that you’re sure to ﬁnd one that is
appropriate for your situation. A theme is a set of design settings: background, fonts, colors,
and graphic effects. PowerPoint 2010 has many built-in themes that are available in every
presentation, and you can also create your own themes and use themes that others have
created and stored in theme ﬁles. A template is a full-ﬂedged PowerPoint ﬁle that has been
designated as a sample from which you can create new presentations. It contains everything that
a presentation requires, including sample slides. A template can also contain multiple themes
that are piggybacked onto slide masters within the template. When you start a new presentation,
you do so from a template, and you inherit any themes and sample slides in that template, in
addition to having the built-in themes available.
Tip
You aren’t stuck with the color scheme or design that comes with a particular theme or template. As
you learn in Chapter 5, you can apply different color, font, and effects themes separately from the
overall theme. ■
What’s the best theme to use? What are the best colors? It all depends on the situation, and on
your presentation medium.
If you are lucky enough to have access to a computer-based presentation system, you can show
your slides on a PC monitor or TV screen. Some large meeting facilities even have projectors that
let you project the image onto very large screens.
Here are some guidelines for formatting for presenting on a computer screen:
 Fonts: The image on a computer screen is usually nice and sharp, and so you can use any
font. However, you should ﬁrst test your presentation on the computer and projector from
which you’ll be presenting, as some fonts may look more jagged than others. If you are
presenting to a large group on a small screen, make sure that you keep all of the lettering
rather large. Also make sure that the font is available on the presentation computer; if it’s
not there, your text and bullets may not look the way you anticipated.
 Text color: Go for contrast. Both dark text on a light background and light text on a dark
background work well.
 Background color: Dark backgrounds such as dark blue, green, or purple are a good
choice if the room is not too dark. Light backgrounds can add ambient light to the room,
which can sometimes be helpful. You are also free to use gradients, shading, patterns, pic-
tures, and other special backgrounds because all of these elements display nicely on most
monitors.
44

Chapter 2: What Makes a Great Presentation?
 Content: You can go all out with your content. Not only can you include both text and
graphics, but also animations, transitions, sounds, and videos.
If you are showing the presentation on a large screen (either with a computerized projector or
35mm slides), the following suggestions may be helpful:
 Fonts: You can use almost any readable font. If your audience will sit far away from the
screen, stick with plain fonts such as Arial and Times New Roman for the body text.
 Text color: Go for contrast. Try light text on a dark background. My personal favorite for
large-format screens is bright yellow text on a navy blue background.
 Background color: Keep it dark — but not black. Light colors make the screen too bright.
Dark blues, greens, and purples are all good choices. Stick with solid backgrounds to
compensate for any image distortion that occurs on-screen. You should avoid patterned,
shaded, or clip art backgrounds.
 Content: You can use any combination of text and graphics with success, but it has to be
static. Animations and transitions don’t work with 35mm slides. For example, if you have
a bulleted list, don’t build the bulleted list one bullet at a time from slide to slide. It looks
awkward.
Using a non-computerized overhead projector, like the one your teacher may have had in grade
school, is never anyone’s ﬁrst choice. However, sometimes it may be all that is available. An
overhead projector image is medium-sized (probably about 36′′x36′′), but often of poor qual-
ity. You will probably be ﬁghting with room lighting, and so your slides may appear washed out.
Here are some tips for preparing slides that you will be showing with overhead projectors:
 Fonts: For headings, choose chunky block fonts, such as Arial Black, that can stand up to
a certain amount of image distortion. For small type, choose clear, easy-to-read fonts such
as Arial or Times New Roman.
 Text color: Black letters on a light background stand out well. Avoid semi-dark lettering,
such as medium-blue, because it easily washes out under an overhead projector’s powerful
light.
 Background color: Avoid dark backgrounds. You probably will not position each slide
perfectly on the overhead projector, and the white space around the edges is distracting if
your transparencies have a dark background. Consider using a simple white background
when you know that you’re going to be using transparencies, and especially when you want
to write on the transparencies.
 Content: Keep it simple. Overheads are best when they are text-heavy, without a lot of
fancy extras or clip art. The overhead projector is an old technology, and slides that are too
dressy seem pretentious.
Step 5: Developing the Content
Your slides should say to the audience, ‘‘I had you in mind when I created this,’’ and, ‘‘Relax;
I’m a professional, and I know what I’m doing.’’ Good-looking, appropriate slides can give the
audience a sense of security, and can lend authority to your message. On the other hand, poorly
45

Part I: Building Your Presentation
done or inconsistent slides can tell the audience, ‘‘I just slapped this thing together at the last
minute,’’ or, ‘‘I don’t really know what I’m doing.’’
Only after you have made all of the decisions in steps 1 through 4 can you start developing your
content in a real PowerPoint presentation. Now comes the work of writing the text for each
slide, which most people prefer to do in Normal view. Type the text on the outline or on the
text placeholder on the slide itself, and you’re ready to roll.
Developing your content may include more than just typing text. For example, your content may
include charts that you created in PowerPoint or imported from another program such as Excel,
pictures, and other elements.
Avoiding Information Overload
When presenting, you want to give the audience exactly the information that they need and no more.
You don’t want them to leave clutching their heads and saying, ‘‘Wow! That was too much to absorb!’’
or, ‘‘What a waste of time!’’ You may have a great deal of information that you need to convey to the
audience in a very short time. To ensure that they absorb it all without feeling overwhelmed, here are
a few ideas:
 Before you give your presentation, analyze it closely to make sure that you only
cover the essential topics. By trimming some nonessential topics, you make more
room to cover the important themes in enough detail.
 Don’t try to cram every detail onto your slides. Use the slides for general talking
points, and then ﬁll in the discussion with your speech.
 Use SmartArt to replace bullets. As you will learn in Chapter 11, you can easily use
the new SmartArt diagrams in PowerPoint 2010 in place of a plain bulleted list to
make the information more memorable and easier to understand.
 Provide detailed handouts that elaborate on your slides. Ensure that the audience
receives them at the beginning of the presentation. Then, refer to the handouts
throughout the presentation, letting the audience know that they can read all of the
details later.
 Summarize at the end of the presentation with a few simple slides. These should con-
tain bullet points that outline what the audience should have learned. You might even
want to use interim summary slides throughout a complex presentation.
Cross-Reference
Chapter 4 guides you through the process of creating slides and text boxes. You learn about graphical con-
tent in Part II of this book. In Lab 1, you learn how to present content without bulleted lists. ■
Step 6: Creating the Visual Image
The term visual image refers to the overall impression that the audience gets from watching the
presentation. You can create a polished, professional impression by making small tweaks to your
presentation after you have decided on the content.
46

Chapter 2: What Makes a Great Presentation?
You can enhance the visual image by making minor adjustments to the slide’s design. For
example, you can give a dark slide a warmer feel by using bright yellow instead of white for
lettering. Repositioning a company logo and making it larger may make the headings look less
lonely. You can use WordArt effects to dress up some text and make it look more graphical. A
product picture is more attractive in a larger size or with a different-colored mat around it. All
of these little touches take practice and experience.
Audiences like consistency. They like visual elements that they can rely on, such as a repeated
company logo on every slide, accurate page numbering on handouts, and the title appearing in
exactly the same spot on every slide. You can create a consistent visual image by enforcing these
rules in your presentation development. It’s easier than you might think, because PowerPoint
provides a slide master speciﬁcally for images and text that should appear on each slide.
Cross-Reference
You’ll work with slide masters and learn more about the beneﬁts of consistency in Chapter 5. ■
Step 7: Adding Multimedia Effects
If you’re creating a self-running presentation, multimedia effects are extremely important for
developing audience interest. Flashy videos and soundtracks can make even the most boring
topic fun to hear about, especially for young audiences. How about a trumpet announcing the
arrival of your new product on the market, or a video of your CEO explaining the reasoning
behind the recent merger?
Caution
Even if you are going to be speaking live, you still might want to incorporate some multimedia elements
into your show. However, be careful not to let them outshine you or to appear gratuitous. Be aware of
your audience (see step 1), and remember that older and higher-level managers want less ﬂash and more
substance. ■
All kinds of presentations can beneﬁt from slide animations and transitions. Animations are sim-
ple movements of the objects on a slide. For example, you can make the bullet points on a list
ﬂy onto the page one at a time, and discuss each one on its own. When the next bullet ﬂies in,
the previous ones can turn a different color so that the current one stands out. You might also
animate a picture of a car so that it appears to ‘‘drive onto’’ the slide, accompanied by the sound
of an engine revving. You can also animate charts by making data series appear one at a time,
so that it looks like the chart is building. Transitions are animated effects for moving from slide
to slide. The most basic and boring transition is to simply remove one slide from the screen and
replace it with another. However, you can also use many alternative effects such as zooming the
new slide in, sliding it from the top, bottom, left, or right, or creating a fade-in transition effect.
Cross-Reference
Chapters 16 and 17 deal with the mechanics of placing sound and video clips into a presentation and con-
trolling when and how they play. You can learn about animations and transitions in Chapter 18. ■
47

Part I: Building Your Presentation
Step 8: Creating the Handouts and Notes
This step is applicable only to speaker-led presentations. With a live audience, you may want
to provide handouts so that they can follow along. You can make handouts verbatim copies
of your slides, or abbreviated versions with only the most basic information included as a
memory-jogger. Handouts can be either black and white or in color, and PowerPoint provides
several handout formats. For example, you can print from one to nine slides per printout, with
or without lines for the audience to write additional notes.
Tip
A continual debate rages in the professional speakers’ community over when to give out handouts. Some
people feel that if you distribute handouts beforehand, people will read them and then not listen to the
presentation. Others feel that if you distribute handouts after the presentation, people will frantically try
to take their own notes during the presentation or will not follow the ideas as easily. There’s no real right
or wrong answer, it seems, and so you should distribute them whenever it makes the most sense for your
situation. ■
As the speaker, you may need your own special set of handouts with your own notes that the
audience should not see. PowerPoint calls these Notes Pages, and there is a special view for cre-
ating them. (You can also enter notes directly into the Notes pane in Normal view.)
Cross-Reference
Notes are covered, along with handouts, in Chapter 19, which also guides you through selecting the appro-
priate size and format, as well as working with your printer to get the best results for your handouts. ■
Step 9: Rehearsing the Presentation
No matter which type of presentation you are creating (speaker-led, self-running, or
user-interactive), you need to rehearse it. However, the goals for rehearsing are different for
each type.
Rehearsing a Live Presentation
When you rehearse a live presentation, you check the presentation slides to ensure that they are
complete, accurate, and in the right order. You may need to rearrange them and hide some of
them for backup-only use.
You should also rehearse using PowerPoint’s presentation controls, which display each slide on
a monitor and let you move from slide to slide, take notes, assign action items, and even draw
directly on a slide. Make sure that you know how to back up, how to jump to the beginning or
end, and how to display one of your backup slides.
Cross-Reference
You can learn about navigation skills in Chapter 20. ■
48

Chapter 2: What Makes a Great Presentation?
Rehearsing a Self-Running Presentation
With a speaker-led presentation, the presenter can ﬁx any glitches that pop up, or explain away
any errors. With a self-running presentation, you don’t have that luxury. The presentation itself
is your emissary. Therefore, you must go over it repeatedly, checking it many times to make
sure that it is perfect before distributing it. Nothing is worse than a self-running presentation
that doesn’t run, or one that contains an embarrassing error.
The most important feature in a self-running presentation is timing. You must make the presen-
tation pause for the correct amount of time so that the audience can read the text on each slide.
The pause must be long enough so that even slow readers can catch it all, but short enough
so that fast readers do not become bored. You can now see how difﬁcult this can be to make
perfect.
PowerPoint has a Rehearse Timings feature that is designed to help you with this task. It lets
you show the slides and advance them manually after the correct amount of time has passed.
The Rehearse Timings feature records how much time you spend on each slide, and gives you
a report so that you can modify the timing if necessary. For example, you may be working on a
presentation that is supposed to last ten minutes, but with your timings, it comes out to only
nine minutes. You can add additional time for each slide to stretch it out to last the full ten
minutes. You may also want to record voice-over narration for your presentation. You can also
rehearse this, to make sure that the voice matches the slide that it is supposed to describe (which
is absolutely crucial, as you can imagine!).
Cross-Reference
Chapter 18 covers the Rehearse timings feature; Chapter 21 covers voice-over narration. ■
Rehearsing a User-Interactive Presentation
In a user-interactive presentation, you provide the readers with on-screen buttons that they can
click to move through the presentation, so that timing is not an issue. The crucial factor with
a user-interactive presentation is link accuracy. Each button on each slide is a link. When your
readers click a button for the next slide, it must take them to the next slide and not to some-
where else. And if you include a hyperlink to a Web address on the Internet, when the readers
click it, the Web browser should open and that page should appear. If the hyperlink contains a
typo and the readers see File Not Found instead of the Web page, the error reﬂects poorly on
you. Chapter 21 covers creating and inserting these links.
If you are planning to distribute your presentation through the Internet, you have a big decision
to make. You can distribute the presentation in its native PowerPoint format and preserve all of
its more exciting features, such as animations and videos. However, not everyone on the Internet
owns a copy of PowerPoint, and so you are limiting your audience. Although PowerPoint sup-
plies a free program, called the PowerPoint Viewer that you can post for downloading on your
Web page, not everyone will take the time to download and install it, and so you may turn off
potential viewers before you start.
49

Part I: Building Your Presentation
Another option is to save the presentation in HTML (Web) format. When you save in HTML
format, you convert each of the slides to a Web page, and you add links (if you didn’t already
have them) that move the viewer from slide to slide. You lose some of the animations, transi-
tions, sounds, videos, animated graphics, and other extras, but you retain your text and most
static elements of the presentation. The advantage is that everyone with a Web browser can view
your presentation with no special downloads or setup.
Finally, you can save the presentation as a video (movie) clip and make that available online.
Cross-Reference
You learn more about preparing a presentation for the Internet, using either method, in Chapter 21. For
more on saving a movie clip and making it available online, see Chapter 17. ■
Step 10: Giving the Presentation
For a user-interactive or self-running presentation, giving the presentation is somewhat anticli-
mactic. You just make it available and the users watch it. Yawn.
However, for a speaker-led presentation, giving the speech is the highlight, the pinnacle, of the
process. If you’ve done a good job rehearsing, you are already familiar with PowerPoint’s pre-
sentation controls. You should be prepared to back up, to skip ahead, to answer questions by
displaying hidden slides, or to pause the whole thing (and black out the screen) so that you can
hold a tangential discussion.
Cross-Reference
Chapter 20 covers all of these situations in case you need to review them. ■
What remains now? Nothing, except for setting up the room and overcoming your stage fright.
Later in this chapter, you’ll get some tips about using a meeting room most effectively and being
a dynamic speaker. Check them out — and then go get ‘em!
Step 11: Assessing Your Success
and Reﬁning Your Work
If giving a presentation is a one-time thing for you — great. It’s over, and you never have to
think about it again. However, it is more likely that you will have to give another presentation
someday, somewhere, and so you shouldn’t drive the experience out of your mind just yet. Per-
haps you learned something that might be useful to you later. Immediately after the presentation,
while it is still fresh in your mind, jot down your responses to the following questions. Then
keep them on ﬁle to refer to later, the next time you have to do a presentation!
 Did the colors and design of the slides seem appropriate?
 Could everyone in the audience read the slides easily?
50

Chapter 2: What Makes a Great Presentation?
 Did the audience look mostly at you, at the screen, or at the handouts? Was that what you
intended?
 Did the audience take notes as you were speaking? If so, did you give them handouts with
note-taking lines to write on?
 Was the length of the presentation appropriate? Did the audience become bored or restless
at any point?
 Were there any slides that you wished you had prepared but didn’t?
 Were there any slides that you would omit if you were doing it over?
 Did your speaker notes give you enough help that you could speak with authority?
 Did the transitions and animations add to the entertainment value, or were they distracting
or corny?
 Did the sound and video clips play with adequate quality? Were they appropriate and
useful?
Choosing and Arranging the Room
Are you giving a live presentation? The choice of room — and its arrangement — can make a
big difference in your success. If you have any say in it, make sure that you get an appropriate
size room for the presentation. For example, a room that is too small makes people feel uncom-
fortable and seems crowded, whereas a room that is too large can create a false formality and
distance that can cause people to lose focus. You also don’t want to have to shout to be heard.
Caution
To avoid having to shout during your presentation, make sure that there is a working sound system, with a
microphone and ampliﬁer available, if necessary. If possible, check this detail a few days ahead of time, to
avoid scrambling for one at the last minute. ■
Next, make sure that tables and chairs are set up appropriately. Figures 2.2 through 2.5 illustrate
several setups, each of which is appropriate for a certain kind of presentation:
 For a classroom setting where the audience will take a lot of notes, give them something to
write on, as shown in Figure 2-2. This arrangement works well when the audience will be
listening to and interacting with you, but not with one another.
 If the audience is not expected to take notes while you are giving the speech, consider an
auditorium setup, as shown in Figure 2-3. This arrangement is also good for ﬁtting a lot of
people into a small room. (This is also known as theater-style seating.)
 If you want the audience to interact in small groups, you should set up groups where peo-
ple can see each other and still see you. Figure 2-4 shows a small-group arrangement.
 To make it easier for the entire group to interact with one another as a whole, use a
U-shape, as shown in Figure 2-5.

Choosing Your Attire
The outﬁt that you choose for the presentation should depend on the expectations of the audi-
ence and the message that you want to send to them. Before you decide what to wear, ask your-
self, ‘‘What will the audience be wearing?’’ Choose one of these classiﬁcations:
 Very informal: Jeans, shorts, T-shirts
 Informal: Nice jeans, polo shirts
 Business casual: Dress slacks and oxfords, with or without a tie, for men; dress slacks or
a skirt and a dressy, casual shirt (sweater, silk blouse, vest) for women
 Business: Dress slacks and a shirt and tie, with or without a jacket, for men; dress or skirt
(blazer optional) for women
 Business formal: Suit and tie for men; suit or conservative dress for women
Now, shape your own choice of attire, depending on the impression that you want to convey.
To convey authority, dress one level above your audience. Use this attire any time your audience
does not know who you are and when you need to establish yourself as the leader or the expert.
(Most teachers fall into this category.) For example, if your audience is dressed informally, you
should wear a dress shirt and tie (for men) or a skirt and sweater (for women). (If you’re female
and will be seated on a stage, you might want pants or a very long skirt.) However, you should
not dress more than two levels above your audience because it makes them feel intimidated. For
example, if you are presenting to factory workers who are dressed in very informal clothing, you
should not wear a business suit.
To convey teamwork and approachability, dress at the same level as the audience, or slightly (no
more than one level) above. For example, if you are a CEO visiting a factory that you manage,
the workers already recognize your authority — you don’t have to prove it. Instead, you want to
53

Part I: Building Your Presentation
appear approachable, and so if they are wearing informal clothing, you might wear dress slacks
and a dress shirt (but no tie) for a man, or slacks and a sweater for a woman.
Avoid dressing below the audience’s level. This is almost never a good idea. If you do not know
what the audience will be wearing, err on the side of formality. It is better to look a little stiff
than it is to look less professional than your audience.
Keeping the Audience Interested
There are no miracle cures here — some people are naturally better, more interesting speakers
than others. However, there are deﬁnite steps that all speakers can take to stack the odds in their
favor when it comes to giving a successful live presentation.
Speech Techniques
Here are some strategies for improving your speaking style:
 Plant your feet ﬁrmly; don’t pace. Pacing makes you appear nervous, and people have
to constantly follow you with their eyes. However, you should keep your upper body
mobile, and should not be afraid to use arm gestures.
 Use gestures to support your voice. If you are talking about three different points, then
hold up ﬁngers to illustrate one, two, and three points. If you are talking about bringing
things together, bring your hands together in front of you to illustrate. Don’t freeze your
hands at your sides.
 Don’t memorize your speech. If someone asks a question, it will throw you off and you’ll
forget where you were.
 Conversely, don’t read the speech word for word from your notes. Notes should con-
tain keywords and facts, but not the actual words that you will say.
 Don’t talk with your face in your notes. Make eye contact with an audience member
before you begin speaking.
 Pick a few people in the audience, in different places in the room, and make direct
eye contact with each of them, in turn, as you speak. Talk directly to a single person
for the duration of the point that you are making and then move on. Also, don’t forget to
smile!
 Don’t be afraid to pause. Speaking slowly, with pauses to look at your notes, is much
more preferable than rushing through the presentation. Keep in mind that pauses that
might seem very long to you really aren’t.
 Don’t stare at or read your slides. Focus your attention on your audience, and pay as
little attention to the support materials as possible while you speak. You want to engage
directly with your audience to deliver your message in your own words.
 Emphasize verbs and action words in your presentation. Remember that the verb is
the most powerful element in the sentence.
54

Chapter 2: What Makes a Great Presentation?
Content Tips
Consider these content techniques:
 If the audience is not in a hurry and you are not rushed for time in your presentation, start
with some kind of icebreaker, like an anecdote or joke.
Caution
Be careful with humor. Analyze the joke that you plan to tell from all angles, making very sure that it does
not offend any race, ethnic group, gender, sexual orientation, or class of workers. It is much worse to tell a
joke that hurts someone’s feelings — even one person — than it is to tell none at all. ■
 Include the audience in interactive exercises that help to ﬁrm up their understanding of
the topic.
 Ask questions to see whether the audience understood you, and give out small prizes to the
people who give correct answers. Nothing energizes an audience into participation more
than prizes, even if they are cheap giveaways like key chains and bandannas.
 If possible, split the presentation into two or more sessions, with a short break and
question-and-answer period between each session.
 During the Q&A portion, turn off the slide projector, overhead, or computer screen so
that people focus on you and on the question, not on the previous slide. If turning off the
equipment isn’t practical, consider inserting a simple Q&A Session title slide or a blank
slide that displays during the Q&A.
Managing Stage Fright
Even if you’re comfortable with the PowerPoint slides that you’ve created, you still might be a
little nervous about the actual speech that you’re going to give. This is normal. In fact, a study
from a few years ago showed that public speaking is the number-one fear among businesspeople.
Fear of death came in second. That should tell you something.
It’s okay to be a little bit nervous because it gives you extra energy and an edge that can actu-
ally make your presentation better. However, if you’re too nervous, it can make you seem less
credible.
One way to overcome stage fright is to stop focusing on yourself, and instead focus on your
audience. Ask yourself what the audience needs and how you are going to supply that need.
Become their caretaker. Dedicate yourself to making the audience understand you. The more you
think of others, the less you think of yourself.
Summary
Although this chapter had little to do with PowerPoint per se, it focused on making successful
presentations using your PowerPoint slides as a tool. The information that you learned here can
help a beginning presenter look more experienced, or help a more experienced presenter polish
his or her skills to perfection.

f you’re an experienced Windows and PowerPoint user, starting
new presentations and saving ﬁles may be second nature to you. If
so — great! You may not need this chapter. On the other hand, if
you aren’t entirely certain about some of the ﬁner points, such as saving in
different formats or locations, stick around.
Even people who consider themselves ‘‘advanced’’ users may beneﬁt from
this chapter, because it looks at some of the unique advanced saving features
of Ofﬁce applications and explains how to secure ﬁles with passwords.
Starting a New Presentation
You can start a blank presentation from scratch, or you can base the new
presentation on a template or on another presentation. Using a template
or existing presentation can save you some time. However, if you have a
speciﬁc vision you’re going for, starting a presentation from scratch gives
you a clean canvas to work from.
Starting a Blank Presentation from Scratch
When you start PowerPoint, a new blank presentation begins automatically
with one slide. Just add your content to it, add more slides if needed, change
the formatting (as you’ll learn in upcoming chapters), and go for it.
If you need to start another blank presentation, follow these steps:
1.
Choose File ➪New. The available templates and themes
appear, on which you can base the new work, as shown in
Figure 3-1.
2.
Blank Presentation is already selected. Click Create.
57

Part I: Building Your Presentation
FIGURE 3-1
Select Blank Presentation from Backstage view.
Tip
Press the Ctrl+N shortcut key to start a new blank presentation. ■
Starting a Presentation from a Template
or Theme
A template is a ﬁle that contains starter settings — and sometimes starter content — on which
you can base new presentations. Templates vary in their exact offerings, but can include sample
slides, a background graphic, custom color and font themes, and custom positioning for object
placeholders.
When selecting a template, you can choose from these categories:
 Sample Templates: Microsoft-provided templates and presentations that come pre-
installed with PowerPoint.
 Sample Themes: Microsoft-provided theme ﬁles, which are the same as the themes that
you can later apply to a presentation from the Design tab.
58

Chapter 3: Creating and Saving Presentation Files
 My Templates: Templates that you have created and saved yourself, and templates that
you previously downloaded from Microsoft Ofﬁce Online.
 Microsoft Ofﬁce Online templates: Microsoft-provided templates that you download
from Microsoft on an as-needed basis.
 Recent templates: Shortcuts to recently-used templates. This lets you easily reselect the
same template you have used before.
 New from Existing: Shortcuts to existing presentations, which you can use as a basis for
new ones. This is useful when you want to create a new version of a presentation without
interfering with the original.
Note
Notice in Figure 3-1 that, in addition to Sample Templates, there are Themes. Themes are not templates,
but they are similar. Chapter 1 explains the difference. You can start a new presentation based on a theme
as an alternative to using a template. Such a presentation starts with deﬁned color, font, and effect settings,
but no sample slides. ■
Using a Sample Template
There are only a few sample templates stored on your hard disk, because Microsoft assumes that
most people have an always-on Internet connection these days. Each sample template demon-
strates a special-purpose type of presentation, such as a photo album, pitchbook, or quiz show.
If you are interested in standard corporate presentation templates, you might prefer to look at
the online offerings instead.
Follow these steps to start a presentation based on a sample template:
1.
Choose File ➪New. Icons for the various types of samples appear.
2.
Click Sample Templates. Icons for the installed sample templates appear.
3.
Click a template to see a preview of it.
4.
Select the template you want and click Create. A new presentation opens based on that
template.
Using an Online Template
The bulk of the templates for presentations are available online. You can access the library of
online templates without leaving PowerPoint. Follow these steps:
1.
Choose File ➪New.
2.
In the Ofﬁce.com Templates section, click the category of template you want.
3.
Depending on the category you choose, a subcategory list might appear in the center
pane. If it does, click the subcategory that you want. For example, if you choose More
Categories, you’ll ﬁnd an Ofﬁce 2007 Document Themes category.
4.
Click a template to see a preview of it.
5.
Select the template that you want and click Download. A new presentation opens based
on that template.
59

Part I: Building Your Presentation
Tip
Spend some time exploring the templates available via the Ofﬁce.com Templates section. There are many
categories here! For example, Design Slides has templates that don’t contain any sample content — just
design elements. ■
Using a Saved Template
When you start a new presentation with an online template, as in the preceding section,
PowerPoint copies that template to your hard disk so you can reuse it in the future without
connecting to the Internet. It is stored, along with any custom template you have created, in the
My Templates folder.
To access these downloaded and custom templates, follow these steps:
1.
Choose File ➪New.
2.
Click My Templates. A New Presentation dialog box appears which contains templates
that you have downloaded or created, as shown in Figure 3-2.
3.
Click OK. A new presentation opens based on that template.
Tip
To quickly access templates you have previously used, choose Recent Templates, and then double-click the
template to reuse. To remove an item from the Recently Used Templates list, right-click the item and choose
Remove Template. To clear the whole list at once, right-click any entry and choose Remove All Recent
Templates. ■

Chapter 3: Creating and Saving Presentation Files
Basing a New Presentation on an Existing One
If you already have a presentation that’s similar to the new one you need to create, you can base
the new presentation on the existing one.
Follow these steps to use an existing presentation as a template:
1.
Choose File ➪New.
2.
Click New from Existing. The New from Existing Presentation dialog box opens, as shown
in Figure 3-3.
FIGURE 3-3
Select an existing presentation to use as a template.
3.
Navigate to the location containing the existing presentation and select it. When you select
a presentation, the Open button changes to a Create New button.
4.
Click Create New.
Basing a New Presentation on Content from Another
Application
PowerPoint can open ﬁles in several formats other than its own, so you can start a new presenta-
tion based on some work you have done elsewhere. For example, you can open a Word outline
in PowerPoint. The results might not be very attractive — but you can ﬁx that later with some
text editing, slide layouts, and design changes.
61

Part I: Building Your Presentation
To open a ﬁle from another application, do the following:
1.
Choose File ➪Open. The Open dialog box appears.
2.
Click the File Type button (or Files of Type in Windows XP) and choose the ﬁle type. For
example, to open a text ﬁle, choose All Outlines, as shown in Figure 3-4.
FIGURE 3-4

Save your work as a PowerPoint ﬁle by choosing File ➪Save As.
Cross-Reference
See the section ‘‘Saving Your Work’’ for more details on saving. ■
Saving Your Work
PowerPoint is typical of most Windows programs in the way that it saves and opens ﬁles. The
entire PowerPoint presentation is saved in a single ﬁle, and any graphics, charts, or other ele-
ments are incorporated into that single ﬁle.
The ﬁrst time you save a presentation, PowerPoint opens the Save As dialog box, prompting you
for a name and location. Thereafter, when you save that presentation, PowerPoint uses the same
settings and does not prompt you for them again.
62

Chapter 3: Creating and Saving Presentation Files
Saving for the First Time
If you haven’t previously saved the presentation you are working on, Save and Save As do the
same thing: They open the Save As dialog box. From there, you can specify a name, ﬁle type,
and ﬁle location. Follow these steps:
1.
Choose File ➪Save. The Save As dialog box appears.
2.
Enter a ﬁlename in the File Name box, as shown in Figure 3-5.
FIGURE 3-5
Save your work by specifying a name for the presentation ﬁle.
Note
If you have Windows Vista, the Save As dialog box might not show the existing content of the current location
by default. To view it, click the Browse Folders arrow in the bottom-left corner of the dialog box. ■
Cross-Reference
To save in a different location, see the section ‘‘Changing Drives and Folders.’’ To save in a different format, see
the section ‘‘Saving in a Different Format.’’ ■
3.
Click Save. Your work is saved.
63

Part I: Building Your Presentation
Filenames can be up to 255 characters. For practical purposes, however, keep the names short.
You can include spaces in the ﬁlenames and most symbols except <, >, ?, *, /, and \. However,
if you plan to post the ﬁle on a network or the Internet at some point, you should avoid using
spaces; use the underscore character instead to simulate a space, if necessary. Filenames that use
exclamation points have also reportedly caused problems, so beware of that. Generally, it is best
to avoid punctuation marks in ﬁlenames.
Tip
If you want to transfer your presentation ﬁle to a different computer and show it from there, and that other
computer does not have the same fonts as your PC, you should embed the fonts in your presentation so
that the desired fonts are available on the other PC. To embed fonts from the Save As dialog box, click the
Tools button, choose Save Options, and select the Embed Fonts in the File check box. This option makes the
saved ﬁle larger than normal, so choose it only when necessary. For more information on advanced saving
features, see the section ‘‘Specifying Save Options.’’ ■
Saving Subsequent Times
After you have saved a presentation once, you can resave it with the same settings (same ﬁle
type, name, and location) in any of the following ways:
 Choose File ➪Save.
 Press Ctrl+S.
 Click the Save button on the Quick Access Toolbar.
If you need to save your presentation under a different name, as a different ﬁle type, or in a dif-
ferent location, use the Save As command instead. This reopens the Save As dialog box, as in the
preceding steps, so that you can save differently. The originally saved copy will remain under the
original name, type, and location.
Tip
If you frequently use Save As, you may want to place a button for it on the Quick Access Toolbar. To do
this, right-click the Save As command and choose Add to Quick Access Toolbar. ■
Changing Drives and Folders
By default, all ﬁles in PowerPoint (and all of the Ofﬁce applications) are saved to the Documents
folder or library (or My Documents under Windows XP) for the current user. Each user has his
or her own version of this folder, so that each person’s documents are kept separate depending
on who is logged in to the PC.
The Documents folder is a convenient save location for beginners, because they never have to
worry about changing the drive or folder. However, more advanced users will sometimes want
to save ﬁles to other locations. These other locations can include ﬂash drives, other hard disks in
64

Chapter 3: Creating and Saving Presentation Files
the same PC, hard disks on other PCs in a network, hard disks on Web servers on the Internet,
or writeable CDs.
Tip
Each user has a My Documents folder in his or her own proﬁle. The actual location of that folder
depends on the Windows version. For example, in Windows Vista or Windows 7, if Mary is logged in, the
path would be C:\Users\Mary\My Documents. In Windows XP, the path would be C:\Documents and
Settings\Mary\My Documents. If your usual PowerPoint ﬁles seem to be missing at some point, make sure
you are logged in under your usual username.
If you are using Windows 7, the Documents shortcut in the Libraries list actually refers to a library rather
than a single folder, and multiple folders may be associated with the Documents library. No matter — just
navigate to the location you want to use. ■
Throughout all of the Ofﬁce programs, the dialog boxes that save and open ﬁles are different
depending on the operating system you are using.
Changing the Save Location (Windows 7)
In Windows 7, the storage locations, and the interface for accessing these locations, are different
from earlier versions of Windows.
The navigation pane on the left side of the Save As dialog box is home to several collapsible/
expandable categories. Double-click a category to open it and then make selections from within
it (see Figure 3-6). You can choose from the following categories:
 Favorites: Shortcuts for popular locations such as Downloads and Desktop appear in the
Favorites list, and you can also add your own shortcuts here.
Tip
Add your own favorite locations to the Favorites list by dragging their icons into it. ■
 Libraries: Libraries are virtual folders that organize locations by the types of ﬁles they
contain. This is a new feature in Windows 7. Double-click Libraries and then click through
a category such as Documents or Pictures.
 HomeGroup: Windows 7 has a new home networking feature called HomeGroup; if you
use it to set up your network, you can browse other network computers by clicking here.
 Computer: Browse the complete drive and folder listing for your local PC here.
You can also navigate via the Address bar (this applies to both Windows 7 and Windows Vista).
The Address bar shows the path to the currently displayed location. You can jump directly
to any of those levels by clicking the name there. This is similar to the Up One Level feature
from Windows XP–style dialog boxes, except you are not limited to going up a single level at a
time — you can go directly up to any level. You can also click the right-pointing arrow to the
right of any level to see a menu of other folders within that location, and jump to any of them
from the menu, as shown in Figure 3-7.

Changing the Save Location (Windows Vista)
Windows Vista’s Save As dialog box offers some navigation locations that are slightly different
from the ones in Windows 7, as shown in Figure 3-8. Here’s a summary:
 Favorite Links list: This area displays shortcuts for popular locations such as Documents
and Desktop. Double-click a shortcut here to jump to the desired location.

 Folders list: This area displays a folder tree of locations, similar to the folder list in a
Windows Explorer window, or to the Computer listing in the Windows 7 version of the
dialog box. See Figure 3-8. To display the Folders list if it does not already appear, click
the up arrow to the right of Folders (below the Favorite Links list). To hide the Folders list,
click the down arrow (which replaces the up arrow).
Tip
Drag the divider line between the Favorite Links and Folders lists to adjust their relative sizes. Drag the
vertical divider line between the lists and the ﬁle listing to make the Favorite Links and Folders panes wider
or narrower. You can also enlarge the whole Save As dialog box, if necessary, by dragging its border. ■
Changing the Save Location (Windows XP)
Under Windows XP, the Save In list shows the top-level locations on the system, including each
drive, My Documents, and My Network Places. Open the list, as shown in Figure 3-9, and select
67

Part I: Building Your Presentation
the location in which you want to start. Then double-click folder icons in the ﬁle listing to drill
down to the location in which you want to save. To go back up one level, click the Up One
Level button. See Figure 3-9.
Along the left side of the Save As dialog box is the Places Bar. It’s roughly equivalent to the
Favorite Links list in Windows Vista. You can click a folder to jump to the desired location to
save a ﬁle.
FIGURE 3-9
Select a top-level location from the Save In list and then double-click folders to work your way

Tip
If you consistently want your PowerPoint ﬁles saved into a different folder, change the default ﬁle location.
Choose File ➪Options and click Save. Then type a new ﬁle location in the Default File Location text box.
You cannot browse for it; you must know the full path name. Separate the parts of the path with \ symbols,
like this: C:\Books\PowerPoint\PPBible. ■
Saving in a Different Format
PowerPoint 2007 and higher has an XML-based ﬁle format. XML (eXtensible Markup Language)
is a text-based coding system similar to HTML that describes formatting by using inline brack-
eted codes and style sheets. XML-based data ﬁles are smaller than the data ﬁles from earlier
68

Chapter 3: Creating and Saving Presentation Files
PowerPoint versions, and they support all of the latest PowerPoint features. For best results, use
this format whenever possible.
There are also several variants of this format for specialty uses. For example, there’s a
macro-enabled version with a .pptm extension. There are also ‘‘show’’ variants (.ppsx and .ppsm)
that open in Slide Show view by default, and template variants (.potx and .potm) that function
as templates.
However, not everyone has PowerPoint 2007 or higher. You can download a compatibility
pack for earlier PowerPoint versions that will allow them to accept the new ﬁles, but you can’t
assume that everyone who has an earlier version of PowerPoint will download it. Therefore
you might need to save presentations in other ﬁle formats in order to share ﬁles with other
people.
The available formats are shown in Table 3-1. In the Save As dialog box, open the Save As Type
drop-down list and select the desired format, as shown in Figure 3-10.

If you consistently want to save in a different format from PowerPoint 2007, choose File ➪Options and
click Save. Then, choose a different format from the Save Files in This Format drop-down list. This makes
your choice the default in the Save As Type drop-down list in the Save As dialog box. Not all of the for-
mats are available here; your choices are PowerPoint Presentation (the default), PowerPoint Macro-Enabled

to make:
 PowerPoint 2007/2010 format or backward-compatible with PowerPoint
97–2003. Unless compatibility is essential, go with the newer format because you
get access to all of the new features. (See Table 3-2 to learn what you’ll lose with
backward-compatibility.) If you use a backward-compatible format, some of the features
described in this book work differently or aren’t available at all.

Chapter 3: Creating and Saving Presentation Files
 Macro-enabled or not. If you plan to record and store macros, use a macro-enabled for-
mat; if not, use a ﬁle format that does not include macro support, for a slightly safer ﬁle
(because a ﬁle cannot carry viruses if it can’t carry macro code).
Cross-Reference
See Chapter 24 to learn how to record macros. ■
 Regular presentation or PowerPoint Show. The ‘‘show’’ variant starts the presentation
in Slide Show view when it is loaded in PowerPoint; that’s the only difference between it
and a regular presentation. You can build your presentation in a regular format, and then
save in show format right before distribution. PowerPoint shows can be opened and edited
in PowerPoint the same as any other ﬁle.
Most of the other choices from Table 3-1 are special-purpose and not suitable for everyday use.
The following sections explain some of those special ﬁle types.
Saving Slides as Graphics
If you save your presentation in one of the graphic formats shown in the Graphics/Other section
of Table 3-1, the ﬁle ceases to be a presentation and becomes a series of unrelated graphic ﬁles,
one per slide. If you choose one of these formats, you’re asked whether you want to export the
current slide only or all slides. If you choose all slides, PowerPoint creates a new folder in the
selected folder with the same name as the original presentation ﬁle and places the graphics ﬁles
in it.
Tip
The Picture Presentation format, new in PowerPoint 2010, does something unique: it converts each slide to
an image, and then places the images in a new presentation ﬁle. This is one way to make sure your slides
are not edited by anyone who uses the presentation. ■
Saving Slide Text Only
If you want to export the text of the slides to some other application, consider the Outline/RTF
format, which creates an outline similar to what you see in the Outline pane in PowerPoint. This
ﬁle can then be opened in Word or any other application that supports RTF text ﬁles. Only text
in placeholders is exported, though, not text in manually inserted text boxes.
Specifying Save Options
The Save Options enable you to ﬁne-tune the saving process for special needs. For example,
you can employ Save Options to embed fonts, to change the interval at which PowerPoint saves
AutoRecover information, and more.
There are two ways to access the Save options:
 Choose File ➪Options and click Save.
 From the Save As dialog box, click Tools ➪Save Options.
73

Part I: Building Your Presentation
The PowerPoint Options dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 3-11.
FIGURE 3-11
Set Save Options to match the way you want PowerPoint to save your work.
Then set any of the options desired. Click OK when you are ﬁnished.
Table 3-3 summarizes the Save Options. One of the most important features described in Table
3-3 is AutoRecover, which is turned on by default. This means if a system error or a power out-
age causes PowerPoint to terminate unexpectedly, you do not lose all of the work you have done.
The next time you start PowerPoint, it opens the recovered ﬁle and asks if you want to save it.
Caution
AutoRecover is not a substitute for saving your work the regular way. It does not save in the same
sense that the Save command does; it only saves a backup version as PowerPoint is running. If you quit
PowerPoint normally, that backup version is erased. The backup version is available for recovery only if
PowerPoint terminates abnormally (because of a system lockup or a power outage, for example). ■
74

Chapter 3: Creating and Saving Presentation Files
TABLE 3-3

Feature
Purpose
Save Files in This
Format
Sets the default ﬁle format to appear in the Save As dialog box. Your
choices are a regular presentation, a macro-enabled presentation, or a
97-2003 backward-compatible presentation.
Save AutoRecover
Info Every
Minutes
PowerPoint saves your work every few minutes so that if the computer has
problems and causes PowerPoint to terminate abnormally, you do not lose
much work. Lower this number to save more often (for less potential data
loss) or raise it to save less often (for less slowdown/delay related to
repeated saving).
AutoRecover File
Location
Specify the location in which AutoRecover drafts should be saved. By
default, it is C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\PowerPoint.
Default File
Location
Specify the location that you want to start from when saving with the Save
As dialog box. By default, it is your Documents (or My Documents) folder.
Save Checked-Out
Files To
Sets the location in which any drafts will be saved that you have checked
out of a Web server library such as SharePoint. If you choose The Server
Drafts Location on This Computer, then you must specify what that location
will be in the Server Drafts Location box. If you choose to save to the
Ofﬁce Document Cache, it’s not an issue because every save goes
immediately back to the server.
Show Detailed
Changes When a
Merge Occurs
Shows full information about what was changed when you merge two
PowerPoint ﬁles that are stored on a shared document management server.
Embed Fonts in
the File
Turn this on if you are saving a presentation for use on a different PC that
might not have the fonts installed that the presentation requires. You can
choose to embed the characters in use only (which minimizes the ﬁle size,
but if someone tries to edit the presentation they might not have all of the
characters out of the font that they need), or to embed all characters in the
font set. Unlike the others, this setting applies only to the current
presentation ﬁle.
Setting Passwords for File Access
If a presentation contains sensitive or conﬁdential data, you can encrypt the ﬁle and protect it
with a password. Encryption is a type of ‘‘scrambling’’ done to the ﬁle so that nobody can see it,
either from within PowerPoint or with any other type of ﬁle-browsing utility.
You can enter two separate passwords for a ﬁle: the Open password and the Modify password.
Use an Open password to prevent unauthorized people from viewing the ﬁle at all. Use a Modify
password to prevent people from making changes to the ﬁle.
75

Part I: Building Your Presentation
You can use one, both, or neither of the password types. For example, suppose you have a
personnel presentation that contains salary information. You might use an Open password and
distribute that password to a few key people in the Human Resources department who need
access to it. But then you might use a Modify password to ensure that none of those people
make any changes to the presentation as they are viewing it.
For the Open password, you can specify an encryption method and strength. Many encryption
codes are available, and the differences between them are signiﬁcant mostly to high-end techni-
cal users. However, if you do have a preference, you can choose it when you choose the Open
password.
To manage a ﬁle’s passwords and other security settings, follow these steps:
1.
Begin to save the ﬁle as you normally would from the Save As dialog box.
2.
In the Save As dialog box, click Tools, and choose General Options. The General Options
dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 3-12.
FIGURE 3-12
Set a password to prevent unauthorized access.
3.
If you want an Open password, enter it in the Password to Open box.
4.
If you want a Modify password, enter it in the Password to Modify box. (You don’t have to
use both an Open and a Modify password; you can use just one or the other if you like.)
5.
(Optional) If you want your personal information stripped from the ﬁle, such as your
name removed from the Author ﬁeld of the Properties box, select the Remove Automat-
ically Created Personal Information from This File On Save check box.
6.
(Optional) If desired, adjust the macro security level for PowerPoint (all ﬁles, not just
this one) by clicking the Macro Security button and making changes to the settings in
the Trust Center; then click OK to return to the General Options dialog box.
76

Chapter 3: Creating and Saving Presentation Files
7.
Click OK.
8.
If you speciﬁed a password in step 3, a conﬁrmation box appears for it. Retype the same
password and click OK.
9.
If you speciﬁed a password in step 4, a conﬁrmation box appears for it. Retype the same
password and click OK.
10.
Continue saving as you normally would.
When you (or someone else) open the ﬁle, a Password prompt appears. The Open password
must be entered to open the presentation ﬁle. The Modify password will not work. After that
hurdle, if you have set a separate Modify password, a prompt for that appears. Your choices are
to enter the Modify password, to cancel, or to click the Read-Only option to open the presenta-
tion in Read-Only mode.
Caution
If you add a Modify password to a PPTX ﬁle and then save it as a PPTX ﬁle, it can be opened and edited
in PowerPoint 2003 or earlier with the compatibility pack installed that allows opening of PPTX ﬁles. How-
ever, if you save the ﬁle in PowerPoint 2010 as a PowerPoint 97–2003 ﬁle (PPT ﬁle), it cannot be edited in
earlier versions. ■
Closing and Reopening Presentations
You can have several presentation ﬁles open at once and switch freely between them, but this
can bog down your computer’s performance somewhat. Unless you are doing some cut-and-paste
work, it’s best to have only one presentation ﬁle open — the one you are actively working on.
It’s easy to close and open presentations as needed.
Closing a Presentation
When you exit PowerPoint, the open presentation ﬁle automatically closes, and you’re prompted
to save your changes if you have made any. If you want to close a presentation ﬁle without exit-
ing PowerPoint, follow these steps:
1.
Choose File ➪Close.
If you have not made any changes to the presentation since the last time you saved, you’re
done.
2.
If you have made any changes to the presentation, you’re prompted to save them. If you
don’t want to save your changes, click Don’t Save, and you’re done.
3.
If you want to save your changes, click Save. If the presentation has already been saved
once, you’re done.
4.
If the presentation has not been saved before, the Save As dialog box appears. Type a name
in the File Name text box and click Save.

Opening a Presentation
To open a recently used presentation, choose Ofﬁce ➪Recent. Up to 22 can appear by default
(see Figure 3-13).
FIGURE 3-13
Open the presentation via the Ofﬁce menu.
Tip
To pin a certain ﬁle to the Ofﬁce menu’s list so that it never scrolls off, click the push-pin icon to the right
of the ﬁle’s name on the menu.
You can increase or decrease the number of recently used ﬁles that appear on the Recent list. Choose
File ➪Options, click Advanced, and in the Display section, set the Number of Documents in the Recent
Documents List.
You can right-click an entry on the Recent Files list for additional options, such as Open as Copy. ■
If the presentation you want to open does not appear on the Recent list, follow these steps to
ﬁnd and open it:
78

Chapter 3: Creating and Saving Presentation Files
1.
Choose File ➪Open. The Open dialog box appears.
2.
Choose the ﬁle you want. If necessary, change the location to ﬁnd the ﬁle.
Cross-Reference
See the section ‘‘Changing Drives and Folders’’ earlier in this chapter if you need help. ■
3.
Click Open. The presentation opens.
To open more than one presentation at once, hold down the Ctrl key as you click each ﬁle you
want to open. Then, click the Open button and they all open in their own windows. For more
information, see the ‘‘Working with Multiple Presentations’’ section later in this chapter.
The Open button in the Open dialog box has its own drop-down list from which you can select
commands that open the ﬁle in different ways. See Figure 3-14, and refer to Table 3-4 for an
explanation of the available options.
FIGURE 3-14
The Open button’s menu contains several special options for opening a ﬁle.

Part I: Building Your Presentation
TABLE 3-4
Open Options
Open Button Setting
Purpose
Open
The default; simply opens the ﬁle for editing.
Open Read-Only
Allows changes but prevents those changes from being saved
under the same name.
Open as Copy
Opens a copy of the ﬁle, leaving the original untouched.
Open in Browser
Applicable only for Web-based presentations; opens it for
viewing in a Web browser. PowerPoint 2010 does not save in
Web format, so it applies only to Web-based presentations
created in earlier versions of PowerPoint.
Open in Protected View
Opens the ﬁle in an uneditable view. This option not only
prevents you from saving any changes to the ﬁle, but it also
prevents you from making changes.
Open and Repair
Opens the ﬁle, and identiﬁes and repairs any errors it
ﬁnds in it.
Show Previous Versions
Applicable only if the presentation ﬁle is stored on an NTFS
volume under Windows Vista or Windows 7. See the next
section for details.
Opening a File from a Different Program
Just as you can save ﬁles in various program formats, you can also open ﬁles from various pro-
grams. PowerPoint can detect the type of ﬁle and convert it automatically as you open it, so you
do not have to know the exact ﬁle type. (For example, if you have an old PowerPoint ﬁle with
a .ppt extension, you don’t have to know what version it came from.) The only problem is with
ﬁles that don’t have extensions that PowerPoint automatically recognizes. In that case, you must
change the File Type setting in the Open dialog box to All Files so that the ﬁle to be opened
becomes available on the ﬁle list, as shown in Figure 3-15. This change is valid for only this one
use of the Open dialog box; the ﬁle type reverts to All PowerPoint Presentations, which is the
default, the next time you open it.
Caution
PowerPoint opens only presentation ﬁles and text-based ﬁles such as Word outlines. If you want to include
graphics from another program in a PowerPoint presentation, insert them using the Picture command on
the Insert tab. Do not attempt to open them with the Open dialog box. ■
80

Chapter 3: Creating and Saving Presentation Files
FIGURE 3-15
To open ﬁles from different programs, change the File Type setting to All Files.
Working with Multiple Presentations
You will usually work with only one presentation at a time. But occasionally you may need to have
two or more presentations open at once — for example, to make it easier to copy text or slides from
one presentation to another.
To open another presentation, choose File ➪Open and select the one you want, the same as usual.
When more than one presentation is open, you can switch among them by selecting the one you want
to see from the taskbar in Windows. Alternatively, you can click the Switch Windows button on the
View tab and select any open presentation from there as shown in the following ﬁgure.
Switch between open windows of all applications — not just PowerPoint — by pressing Alt+Esc
repeatedly to cycle through them, or by holding down the Alt key and pressing Tab to browse
thumbnails of open windows.

Finding a Presentation File to Open
If you have forgotten where you saved a particular presentation ﬁle, you’re not out of luck. The
Open dialog box (under Windows Vista and Windows 7) includes a Search box that can help
you locate it, as shown in Figure 3-16.
FIGURE 3-16
Use the Search box in the Open dialog box (Windows Vista and Windows 7 only) to look for a ﬁle.
Type search

Results
matching
search
To search for a ﬁle, follow these steps:
1.
Choose File ➪Open to display the Open dialog box.
2.
Navigate to a location that you know the ﬁle is in. For example, if you know it is on the C:
drive, display the top-level listing for the C: drive.
3.
Click in the Search box and type part of the ﬁlename (if you know it) or a word or phrase
used in the ﬁle.
4.
Press Enter. A list of ﬁles that match that speciﬁcation appears.
5.
Open the ﬁle as you normally would.
Note
You can also use the Search utility from outside of PowerPoint. In Windows, click Start and choose Search.
Although the Search utilities are different in each version of Windows, they all can ﬁnd a ﬁle by name,
content, author, date, or many other properties. ■
82

Chapter 3: Creating and Saving Presentation Files
Setting File Properties
File properties are facts about each ﬁle that can help you organize them. If you have a lot of
PowerPoint ﬁles, using ﬁle properties can help you search intelligently for them using the Search
feature you learned about in the preceding section. For example, you can specify an author, a
manager, and a company for each ﬁle, and then search based on those values.
To view the document’s properties, click the File button to open Backstage view. The document’s
properties appear in the right pane.
You can set a ﬁle’s properties by doing the following:
1.
Click File to open Backstage view.
2.
Click Properties (on the right side of the Info section), and on the menu that appears, click
Show Document Panel.
A Properties Ribbon appears above the presentation window.
3.
Fill in any information you want to store about the presentation, as shown in Figure 3-17.
4.
Click the down arrow to the right of Document Properties in the Properties Ribbon, and
choose Advanced Properties. The Properties dialog box for the ﬁle appears.
5.
Click the Summary tab, and conﬁrm or change any information there. This is the same
information that you entered in the Properties Ribbon, with the addition of a couple of
other ﬁelds, as shown in Figure 3-18.
6.
Click the Custom tab, shown in Figure 3-19, and choose any additional ﬁelds you need
and set values for them. For example, click the Client ﬁeld on the Name list, and type a
value for it in the Value text box. Repeat this for any of the other custom ﬁelds.
7.
Review the information on the Statistics and Contents tab if desired. (You can’t change
that information.)
8.
Click OK.
Now you can use the contents of the properties ﬁelds when performing a search.

Chapter 3: Creating and Saving Presentation Files
Managing Files from Within PowerPoint
To save yourself some time, you can perform certain ﬁle management tasks without leaving
PowerPoint. Any dialog box that enables you to select a ﬁle to open, such as the Open dialog
box, or enables you to save a ﬁle, such as the Save As dialog box, can also be used to copy,
delete, and rename ﬁles.
Creating a New Folder
When saving ﬁles, you might want to create a new folder to put them in. To create a new folder
in a Windows Vista or Windows 7–style dialog box, click New Folder in the command bar.
Figure 3-20 shows the Save As dialog box in Windows 7, which looks similar to the one in
Windows Vista.
To create a new folder in Windows XP, click the New Folder button in the row of buttons that
appears across the top of the Save As dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-21.
Copying a Presentation
One way to copy a presentation is to open it and then save it under a different name. (You
learned to do this earlier in this chapter.) But here’s a method that enables you to copy without
having to ﬁrst open the ﬁle:
1.
From the Open dialog box, select the ﬁle you want to copy. (You can also use the Save As
dialog box.)
2.
Right-click the ﬁle and choose Copy from the shortcut menu.
3.
If necessary, change to a different drive and/or folder.
4.
Right-click an empty area in the list of ﬁles.
5.
Choose Paste from the shortcut menu. The ﬁle appears. If you pasted it into the same
folder as the original, the new one has the words — Copy at the end of its name to dif-
ferentiate it. Rename it if desired.
Cross-Reference
For more on renaming ﬁles, see the section ‘‘Renaming a Presentation’’ later in this chapter. ■
6.
Click Cancel to close the dialog box.
Deleting a Presentation
Just as you can copy a ﬁle, you can delete a presentation ﬁle from Windows itself, bypassing
PowerPoint altogether. Just select the ﬁle in Windows Explorer and press the Delete key, or drag
it to the Recycle Bin on the Windows desktop.
85

Part I: Building Your Presentation

To delete a ﬁle from within PowerPoint, select it from the Save As or Open dialog box and press
the Delete key on the keyboard or right-click it and choose Delete. (Or in a Windows XP–style
dialog box, you can click the Delete button on the toolbar.) You cannot delete a ﬁle that is cur-
rently open.
Note
If you accidentally delete a ﬁle, you can get it back if you deleted it from Windows; just open the Recycle
Bin and drag it back out. ■
Renaming a Presentation
To rename a ﬁle from within the Save As or Open dialog boxes, click it and then press F2, or
right-click it and choose Rename from the shortcut menu. Then type the new name and press
Enter.
If you have the display of ﬁle extensions for known ﬁle types turned off in Windows (the
default), you do not need to type the .pptx extension when renaming ﬁles. In fact, if you do
type it, the ﬁle may end up with a double extension, like myﬁle.pptx.pptx. On the other hand,
86

Chapter 3: Creating and Saving Presentation Files
FIGURE 3-21

if you have the display of ﬁle extensions turned on, you must type the ﬁle extension while
renaming a ﬁle.
Tip
To change the setting that governs whether or not ﬁle extensions are displayed, open a Windows Explorer
window and then:
 Windows 7: Choose Organize ➪Folder and Search Options
 Windows Vista: Choose Organize ➪Folder and Search Options
 Windows XP: Choose Tools ➪Folder Options
Then click the View tab and select or clear the Hide Extensions for Known File Types check box. ■
Mapping a Network Drive
Mapping a network drive assigns a drive letter to a folder on a remote PC. This might be useful if
you save frequently to a network location and you don’t want to have to wade through multiple
levels of folders each time to ﬁnd it. (In Windows XP, you can accomplish the same thing by
creating a shortcut in My Network Places.)
87

Part I: Building Your Presentation
To map the currently displayed folder as a network drive, open the Tools menu from either the
Open or Save As dialog box and choose Map Network Drive. This opens a dialog box that lets
you associate a drive letter with the location.
Summary
This chapter made you a master of ﬁles. You can now conﬁdently create new presentations, and
save, open, close, and delete PowerPoint presentation ﬁles. You can also save ﬁles in different
formats, search for missing presentations, and lots more. This is rather utilitarian knowledge and
not very much fun to practice, but later you will be glad you took the time to learn it, when you
have important ﬁles you need to keep safe.
In the next chapter, you learn about slide layouts and text-based presentations. You also learn
how to create your own layouts, and how to use the Outline pane to create the text that will
form the basis of your message.

Working with text boxes
P
owerPoint makes it easy to create consistent, attractive slides that use
standard preset layouts. You just choose the layout that you want for
a particular slide and then ﬁll in its placeholders with text, graphics,
or other content.
In this chapter, you’ll learn how to build a simple text-based presentation by
creating new slides and entering text on them. You’ll learn how to import
content from other programs, and how to create, size, and position text
boxes to hold the text for your presentation.
Creating New Slides
Different templates start a presentation with different numbers and types of
slides. A blank presentation has only a single slide, and you must create any
others that you want.
There are several ways to create new slides. For example, you can type new
text in the outline and then promote it to slide status, or you can add slides
with the New Slide button that is on the Home tab. You can also copy exist-
ing slides, either within the same presentation or from other sources. The
following sections outline these procedures in more detail.
Creating New Slides from the Outline Pane
As discussed in Chapter 1, the Outline pane shows the text from the
presentation’s slides in a hierarchical tree, with the slide titles at the top
level (the slide level) and the various levels of bulleted lists on the slides
displaying as subordinate levels. Text that you type in the Outline pane
appears on the slide, and vice versa, as shown in Figure 4-1.
89

Part I: Building Your Presentation
FIGURE 4-1
When you type text into the Outline pane, it automatically appears on the current slide.
Note
The Outline pane doesn’t actually show all of the text in all cases; see ‘‘Creating Text Boxes Manually’’ later
in this chapter to ﬁnd out why text in some text boxes does not appear in the Outline pane. ■
Follow these steps to create a new slide from the Outline pane:
1.
Switch to Normal view and display the Outline pane (as in Figure 4-1) if it does not
already appear.
2.
Right-click the existing line on the Outline pane that the new slide should follow.
3.
Click New Slide. A new line appears in the Outline pane, with a slide symbol to its left.
4.
Type the title for the new slide. The title appears both in the Outline pane and on the
slide.
You can also create a new slide by starting a new line in the Outline pane and then promoting it
to slide level by pressing Shift+Tab. Follow these steps to insert a new slide in this way:
1.
Position the insertion point at the end of the last line of the slide that the new slide should
follow, and press Enter to start a new line.
90

Chapter 4: Creating Slides and Text Boxes
2.
Press Shift+Tab to promote the new line to the highest level (press it multiple times if
needed), so that a slide icon appears to its left.
3.
Type the title for the new slide. The title appears both in the Outline pane and on the
slide.
After creating the slide, you can continue creating its content directly in the Outline pane. Press
Enter to start a new line, and then use Tab to demote, or Shift+Tab to promote, the line to the
desired level. You can also right-click the text and choose Promote or Demote. Promoting a line
all the way to the top level changes the line to a new slide title.
Creating a Slide from the Slides Pane
Here’s a very quick method for creating a new slide, based on the default layout. It doesn’t get
much easier than this:
1.
In Normal view, in the Slides pane, click the slide that the new slide should follow.
2.
Press Enter. A new slide appears using the Title and Content layout. You can also
right-click the slide that the new one should follow and choose New Slide.
The drawback to creating a slide in either of these ways is that you cannot specify the layout. To
choose a layout other than the default one, see the next section.
Creating a Slide from a Layout
A slide layout is a layout guide that tells PowerPoint what placeholder boxes to use on a partic-
ular slide and where to position them. Although slide layouts can contain placeholders for text,
they also contain graphics, charts, tables, and other useful elements. After you create a new slide
with placeholders, you can click a placeholder to open whatever controls you need to insert that
type of object.
Cross-Reference
See the section, ‘‘Using Content Placeholders’’ for more information on inserting objects. ■
When you create new slides using the outline method described in the preceding section, the
new slides use the Title and Content layout, which consists of a slide title and a single, large
placeholder box for content. If you want to use another layout, such as a slide with two adjacent
but separate frames of content, you must either switch the slide to a different layout after its
creation (using the Layout menu on the Home tab), or you must specify a different layout when
you initially create the slide.
To specify a certain layout as you are creating a slide, follow these steps:
1.
In Normal or Slide Sorter view, select or display the slide that the new one should follow.
You can select a slide by clicking its thumbnail image in Slide Sorter view or on the Slides
pane in Normal view. You can also move the insertion point to the slide’s text in the Out-
line pane.
91

Part I: Building Your Presentation
2.
On the Home tab, do one of the following:
 To add a new slide using the default Title and Content layout, click the top (graphical)
portion of the New Slide button.
 To add a new slide using another layout, click the bottom (text) portion of the New
Slide button and then select the desired layout from the menu, as shown in Figure 4-2.

Tip
The layouts that appear on the menu come from the slide master. To customize these layouts, click
Slide Master on the View tab. You will learn more about the slide master and about changing layouts in
Chapter 5. ■
Copying Slides
Another way to create a new slide is to copy an existing one in the same presentation. This is
especially useful when you are using multiple slides to create a progression because one slide
is typically identical to the next slide in a sequence, except for a small change. (You can also
92

Chapter 4: Creating Slides and Text Boxes
build effects within a single slide using PowerPoint’s animation effects, as you will learn in
Chapter 18.)
There are several ways to copy one or more slides. One way is to use the Windows Clipboard,
as in the following steps:
1.
Select the slide or slides that you want to copy. See ‘‘Selecting Slides’’ later in this chapter
for more information about selecting slides.
Caution
If you select from the Outline pane, make sure that you click the icon to the left of the slide’s title so that the
entire slide is selected; if you select only part of the text on the slide, then only the selected part is copied. ■
2.
Press Ctrl+C. You can also click the Copy button on the Home tab, or right-click the
selection and click Copy.
3.
Select the slide that the pasted slide or slides should follow. Alternately, in the Outline
pane, click to place the insertion point where you want the insertion.
4.
Press Ctrl+V. You can also click the Paste button on the Home tab, or right-click the des-
tination and click Paste.
PowerPoint also has a Duplicate Slides command that does the same thing as a copy-and-paste
command. Although it may be a little faster, it gives you less control as to where the pasted
copies will appear:
1.
Select the slide or slides to be duplicated.
2.
On the Home tab, click the bottom part of the New Slide button to open its menu.
3.
Click Duplicate Selected Slides. As an alternative, you can right-click a slide (or a group of
selected slides) in the Slides pane and choose Duplicate Slide.
PowerPoint pastes the slides immediately after the last slide in the selection. For example,
if you selected slides 1, 3, and 6, then the copies are placed after slide 6.
Tip
To make duplication even faster, you can place the Duplicate Selected Slides command on the Quick Access
toolbar. To do that, right-click the command on the menu and choose Add to Quick Access Toolbar. ■
Inserting Content from External Sources
Many people ﬁnd that they can save a lot of time by copying text or slides from other programs
or from other PowerPoint presentations to form the basis of a new presentation. There’s no need
to reinvent the wheel each time! The following sections look at various ways to bring in content
from external sources.
93

Part I: Building Your Presentation
Copying Slides from Other Presentations
There are several ways to copy slides from other presentations. You can:
 Open the presentation, save it under a different name, and then delete the slides that you
don’t want, leaving a new presentation with the desired slides ready for customization.
 Open two PowerPoint windows side-by-side and drag-and-drop slides between them.
 Open two PowerPoint presentations, copy slides from one of them to the Clipboard
(Ctrl+C), and then paste them into the other presentation (Ctrl+V).
 Use the Reuse Slides feature in PowerPoint, as described next.
To reuse slides from other presentations with the Reuse Slides feature, follow these steps:
1.
On the Home tab, click the lower portion of the New Slide button to open its menu.
2.
Click Reuse Slides. The Reuse Slides pane appears.
3.
Click Open a PowerPoint File.
OR
Click the Browse button and then click Browse File.
4.
In the Browse dialog box, select the presentation from which you want to copy slides, and
click Open. Thumbnail images of the slides in the presentation appear in the Reuse Slides
pane, as shown in Figure 4-3.
5.
(Optional) If you want to keep the source formatting when copying slides, select the Keep
Source Formatting check box at the bottom of the task pane.
6.
(Optional) To see an enlarged image of one of the slides, move the mouse pointer over it.
7.
Do any of the following:
 To insert a single slide, click it.
 To insert all slides at once, right-click any slide and choose Insert All Slides.
 To copy only the theme (not the content), right-click any slide and choose Apply
Theme to All Slides, or Apply Theme to Selected Slides.
Inserting New Slides from an Outline
All of the Microsoft Ofﬁce applications work well together, and so it’s easy to move content
between them. For example, you can create an outline for a presentation in Microsoft Word and
then import it into PowerPoint. PowerPoint uses the heading styles that you assigned in Word
to decide which items are slide titles and which items are slide content. The top-level headings
(Heading 1) form the slide titles.
To try this out, open Word, switch to Outline view (from the View tab), and then type a short
outline of a presentation. Press Tab to demote, or Shift+Tab to promote, a selected line. Then
save your work, go back to PowerPoint, and follow these steps to import it:
1.
On the Home tab, click the lower portion of the New Slide button to open its menu.
94

Chapter 4: Creating Slides and Text Boxes
2.
Click Slides from Outline. The Insert Outline dialog box opens.
3.
Select the ﬁle containing the outline text that you want to import.
4.
Click Insert. PowerPoint imports the outline.
If there were already existing slides in the presentation, they remain untouched. (This includes
any blank slides, and so you might need to delete the blank slide at the beginning of the presen-
tation after importing.) All of the Heading 1 lines from the outline become separate slide titles,
and all of the subordinate headings become bullet points in the slides.
FIGURE 4-3
Choose individual slides to copy to the current presentation.
Tips for Better Outline Importing
Although PowerPoint can import any text from any Word document, you may not always get the
results that you want or expect. For example, you may have a document that consists of a series
of paragraphs with no heading styles applied. When you import this document into PowerPoint,
it might look something like Figure 4-4.
95

Part I: Building Your Presentation
FIGURE 4-4
A Word document consisting mainly of plain paragraphs makes for an unattractive presentation.
Figure 4-4 is a prime example of what happens if you don’t prepare a document before you
import it into PowerPoint. PowerPoint makes each paragraph its own slide and puts all of the
text for each one in the title placeholder. It can’t tell which ones are actual headings and which
ones aren’t because there are no heading styles in use. The paragraphs are too long to ﬁt on
slides, and so they are truncated off the tops of the slides. Extra blank lines are interpreted
as blank slides. Quite a train wreck, isn’t it? Figure 4-4 also illustrates an important point to
remember: Regular paragraph text does not work very well in PowerPoint. PowerPoint text is all
about short, snappy bulleted lists and headings. The better that you prepare the outline before
importing it, the less cleanup you will need to do after importing. Here are some tips:
 Non-headings in Word do not import into PowerPoint unless you use no heading styles
at all in the document (as in Figure 4-4). Apply heading styles to the text that you want to
import.
 Stick with basic styles only in the outline: for example, just Heading 1, Heading 2, and
so on.
 Delete all blank lines above the ﬁrst heading. If you don’t, you will have blank slides at the
beginning of your presentation.
96

Chapter 4: Creating Slides and Text Boxes
 Strip off as much manual formatting as possible from the Word text, so that the text picks
up its formatting from PowerPoint. To strip off formatting in Word, select the text and
press Ctrl+spacebar.
 Do not leave blank lines between paragraphs. These will translate into blank slides or blank
bulleted items in PowerPoint.
 Delete any graphic elements, such as clip art, pictures, charts, and so on. They will not
transfer to PowerPoint anyway and may confuse the import utility.
Importing from Other Text-Based Formats
In addition to Word, PowerPoint also imports from plain-text ﬁles, from WordPerfect (5.× or
6.×), from Microsoft Works, and from Web pages. The procedure is the same as in the preced-
ing steps. If the ﬁle does not appear in the Insert Outline dialog box, change the ﬁle type to the
desired ﬁle type.
If you are setting up a plain-text ﬁle for import, you obviously won’t have the outlining tools
from Word at your disposal. Instead, you must rely on tabs. Each line that should be a title slide
should start at the left margin; ﬁrst-level bullet paragraphs should be preceded by a single tab;
second-level bullets should be preceded by two tabs, and so on.
Post-Import Cleanup
After importing text from an outline, there will probably be a few minor corrections that you
need to make. Run through this checklist:
 The ﬁrst slide in the presentation might be blank. If it is, then delete it.
 The Title Slide layout may not be applied to the ﬁrst slide; apply that layout, if necessary.
(You can use the Layout list on the Home tab.)
 A theme may not be applied; choose one from the Design tab, if necessary, or format your
slide masters and layouts as desired.
Cross-Reference
See Chapter 5 for more information on working with themes. ■
 Some of the text might contain manual formatting that interferes with the theme formatting
and creates inconsistency. Remove any manual formatting that you notice. (One way to do
this is to select all of the text in the Outline pane by pressing Ctrl+A and then stripping
off the manual formatting by pressing Ctrl+spacebar or by clicking the Reset button in the
Slides group on the Home tab.)
 If some of the text is too long to ﬁt comfortably on a slide, change to a different slide layout,
such as a two-column list, if necessary. You might also need to split the content into two or
more slides.
 There might be some blank bullet points on some slides (if you missed deleting all of the
extra paragraph breaks before importing). Delete these bullet points.
97

Part I: Building Your Presentation
Opening a Word Document as a New Presentation
Instead of importing slides from a Word document or other text-based document, as described
in the preceding section, you can simply open the Word document in PowerPoint. PowerPoint
starts a new presentation ﬁle to hold the imported text. This saves some time if you are starting
a new presentation anyway, and you don’t have any existing slides to merge with the incoming
content.
To open a Word document in PowerPoint, follow these steps:
1.
Choose File ➪Open. The Open dialog box appears.
2.
Change the ﬁle type to All Outlines.
3.
Select the document.
4.
Click Open. The document outline becomes a PowerPoint presentation, with all
Heading 1 paragraphs becoming title slides.
Caution
You can’t open or insert a Word outline in PowerPoint if it is currently open in Word. This limitation is an
issue only for Word ﬁles, not plain text or other formats. ■
Importing Text from Web Pages
PowerPoint accepts imported text from several Web-page formats, including HTML and MHTML
(Single File Web Page). It is helpful if the data is in an orderly outline format, or if it was origi-
nally created from a PowerPoint ﬁle, because there will be less cleanup needed.
There are several ways to import from a Web page:
 Open a Web-page ﬁle as you would an outline (see the preceding section), but set the ﬁle
type to All Web Pages.
 Insert the text from the Web page as you would a Word outline (in the Home tab, click
New Slide ➪Slides from Outline).
 Reuse slides from a Web presentation as you would from any other presentation (in the
Home tab, click New Slide ➪Reuse Slides).
Caution
You should use one of the above methods rather than pasting HTML text directly into PowerPoint. This
is because when you paste HTML text, you might get additional HTML tags that you don’t want, includ-
ing cross-references that might cause your presentation to try to log onto a Web server every time you
open it. ■
When importing from a Web page, don’t expect the content to appear formatted the same way
that it was on the Web page. We’re talking strictly about text import here. The formatting on
the Web page comes from HTML tags or from a style sheet, neither of which you can import. If
you want an exact duplicate of the Web page’s appearance, take a picture of the page with the
Shift+PrintScreen command, and then paste it into PowerPoint (Ctrl+V) as a graphic.
98

Chapter 4: Creating Slides and Text Boxes
If you are importing an outline from an MHTML-format Web page that contains pictures, the
pictures are also imported into PowerPoint. If importing from a regular HTML ﬁle, you cannot
import the pictures.
Tip
If you need to show a live Web page from within PowerPoint, try Shyam Pillai’s free Live Web add-in, found
at www.mvps.org/skp/liveweb.htm. ■
Managing Slides
After inserting a few slides into a presentation, and perhaps building some content on them, you
might decide to make some changes, such as rearranging, deleting, and so on. The following
sections explain how to manage and manipulate the slides in a presentation.
Selecting Slides
Before you can issue a command that acts upon a slide or a group of slides, you must select the
slides that you want to affect. You can do this from either Normal or Slide Sorter view, but Slide
Sorter view makes it easier because you can see more slides at once. From Slide Sorter view, or
from the Slides pane in Normal view, you can use any of these techniques to select slides:
 To select a single slide, click it.
 To select multiple slides, hold down the Ctrl key as you click each one. Figure 4-5 shows
slides 1, 3, and 6 selected, as indicated by the shaded border around the slides.
 To select a contiguous group of slides (for example, slides 1, 2, and 3), click the ﬁrst slide,
and then hold down the Shift key as you click the last one. All of the slides in between are
selected as well.
To cancel the selection of multiple slides, click anywhere outside of the selected slides.
To select slides from the Outline pane in Normal view, click the slide icon to the left of the
slide’s title; this selects the entire slide, as shown in Figure 4-6. It’s important to select the entire
slide and not just part of its content before issuing a command such as Delete, because other-
wise, the command only affects the portion that you selected.
Deleting Slides
You may want to get rid of some of the slides, especially if you created your presentation using
a template that contained a lot of sample content. For example, the sample presentation may be
longer than you need, or you may have inserted your own slides instead.
Select the slide or slides that you want to delete, and then do either of the following:
 Right-click the selection and choose Delete Slide.
 Press the Delete key on the keyboard.
99

Part I: Building Your Presentation
FIGURE 4-5
Select slides in Slide Sorter view by holding down the Ctrl key and clicking each slide.

Undoing Mistakes
Here’s a command that can help you in almost all of the other chapters in this book: undoing.
The Undo command allows you to reverse past actions. For example, you can use it to reverse
all of the deletions that you made to your presentation in the preceding section. The easiest way
to undo a single action is to click the Undo button on the Quick Access toolbar or press Ctrl+Z.
You can click it as many times as you like; each time you click it, you undo one action.
Tip
By default, the maximum number of Undo operations is 20, but you can change this. Choose
File ➪Options, then click Advanced, and in the Editing Options section, change the Maximum
Number of Undos setting. Keep in mind that if you set the number of undos too high, it can cause
performance problems in PowerPoint. ■
You can undo multiple actions at once by opening the Undo button’s drop-down list, as shown
in Figure 4-7. Just drag the mouse across the actions that you want to undo (you don’t need to
100

Chapter 4: Creating Slides and Text Boxes
hold down the mouse button). Click when the desired actions are selected, and presto, they are
all reversed. You can select multiple actions to undo, but you can’t skip around. For example, to
undo the fourth item, you must undo the ﬁrst, second, and third ones, as well.
FIGURE 4-6
Select slides in the Outline pane by clicking the slide icon to the left of the slide title.
Slide
icons
The Redo command is the opposite of Undo. If you make a mistake with the Undo button, you
can ﬁx the problem by clicking the Redo button. Like the Undo button, it has a drop-down list,
and so you can redo multiple actions at once.
The Redo command is available only immediately after you use the Undo command. If Redo isn’t
available, a Repeat button appears in its place. The Repeat command enables you to repeat the
last action that you performed (and it doesn’t have to be an Undo operation). For example, you
can repeat some typing, or some formatting. Figure 4-8 shows the Repeat button.
Rearranging Slides
The best way to rearrange slides is to do so in Slide Sorter view. In this view, the slides in your
presentation appear in thumbnail view, and you can move them around on the screen to differ-
ent positions, just as you would manually rearrange pasted-up artwork on a table. Although you
101

Part I: Building Your Presentation
can also do this from the Slides pane in Normal view, you are able to see fewer slides at once.
As a result, it can be more challenging to move slides around, for example, from one end of the
presentation to another. To rearrange slides, use the following steps:
1.
Switch to Slide Sorter view.
2.
Select the slide that you want to move. You can move multiple slides at once if you like.
3.
Drag the selected slide to the new location. The mouse pointer changes to a little rectangle
next to the pointer arrow as you drag. A vertical line also appears where the slide will go if
you release the mouse button at that point, as shown in Figure 4-9.
4.
Release the mouse button. The slide moves to the new location.
FIGURE 4-7
Use the Undo button to undo your mistakes and the Redo button to reverse an Undo operation.

You can also rearrange slides in the Outline pane in Normal view. This is not quite as easy as
using Slide Sorter view, but it’s more versatile. Not only can you drag entire slides from place to
place, but you can also move individual bullets from one slide to another.
Follow these steps to move content in the Outline pane:
1.
Switch to Normal view and display the Outline pane.
2.
Position the mouse pointer over the slide’s icon. The mouse pointer changes to a
four-headed arrow.
3.
Click on the icon. PowerPoint selects all of the text in that slide.
4.
Drag the slide’s icon to a new position in the outline and then release the mouse button.
All of the slide’s text moves with it to the new location.
There are also keyboard shortcuts for moving a slide up or down in the Outline pane that may
be faster than clicking the toolbar buttons. You can press the Alt+Shift+Up arrow keys to move
a slide up, and the Alt+Shift+Down arrow keys to move a slide down.
These shortcuts work equally well with single bullets from a slide. Just click to the left of a single
line to select it, instead of clicking the Slide icon in step 3.
Using Content Placeholders
Now that you know something about inserting and managing entire slides, let’s take a closer look
at the content within a slide. The default placeholder type is a multipurpose content placeholder,
as shown in Figure 4-10.
103

Part I: Building Your Presentation
FIGURE 4-10
A content placeholder can contain a variety of different elements.
Table
Chart
Smart Art
Picture
Text
Clip Art
Movie
Inserting Content into a Placeholder
To type text into a content placeholder, click inside the placeholder box and start typing. You
can enter and edit text as you would in any word-processing program. To insert any other type
of content into a placeholder, click one of the icons shown in Figure 4-10. A dialog box opens
to help you select and insert that content type.
Cross-Reference
Chapters 6 and 7 cover the various formatting that you can apply to text on a slide. You will learn about
these various content types later in the book:
 Tables: Chapter 9
 SmartArt: Chapter 11
 Clip Art: Chapter 12
 Pictures (from ﬁles): Chapter 13
 Charts: Chapter 14
 Movies: Chapter 17 ■
A content placeholder can hold only one type of content at a time. If you click in the placeholder
and type some text, the icons for the other content types disappear. To access them again, you
must delete all of the text from the placeholder.
Placeholders versus Manually Inserted Objects
You can insert content on a slide independently of a placeholder by using the Insert tab’s buttons
and menus. This technique allows you to insert an item in its own separate frame on any slide,
104

Chapter 4: Creating Slides and Text Boxes
to coexist with any placeholder content. You can learn how to insert each content type in the
chapters in which they are covered (see the preceding list).
Creating Text Boxes Manually
The difference between a placeholder-inserted object and a manually inserted one is most signiﬁ-
cant with text boxes. Although you might think that all text boxes are all alike, there are actually
some signiﬁcant differences between placeholder text boxes and manually inserted ones.
Here are some of the characteristics of a text placeholder:
 You cannot create new text placeholder boxes on your own, except in Slide Master view.
Cross-Reference
You learn how to use Slide Master view to create your own layouts that contain custom text placeholders in
Chapter 5. ■
 If you delete all of the text from a text placeholder, the placeholder instructions return (in
Normal view).
 A text placeholder box has a ﬁxed size on the slide, regardless of the amount or size of text
that it contains. You can resize it manually, but if you reapply the layout, the placeholder
box snaps back to the original size.
 AutoFit is turned on by default in a text placeholder, so that if you type more text than will
ﬁt, or resize the frame so that the existing text no longer ﬁts, the text shrinks in size.
 The text that you type in a text placeholder box appears in the Outline pane.
A manual text box, on the other hand, is one that you create yourself using the Text Box tool on
the Insert tab. Here are some characteristics of a manual text box:
 You can create a manual text box anywhere, and you can create as many as you like,
regardless of the layout.
 If you delete all of the text from a manual text box, the text box remains empty or disap-
pears completely. No placeholder instructions appear.
 A manual text box starts out small vertically, and expands as you type more text into it.
 A manual text box does not use AutoFit by default; the text box simply becomes larger to
make room for more text.
 You cannot resize a manual text box so that the text that it contains no longer ﬁts; Pow-
erPoint refuses to make the text box shorter vertically until you delete some text from it.
(However, you can decrease its horizontal width.)
 Text typed in a manual text box does not appear in the Outline pane.
105

Part I: Building Your Presentation
Figure 4-11 shows two text placeholders (one empty) and a text box. Notice that the empty
placeholder contains ﬁller text to help you remember that it is there. Notice also that only the
text from the placeholder appears in the Outline pane; the text-box text does not. Empty text
boxes and placeholders do not show up in Slide Show view, so you do not have to worry about
deleting any unneeded ones.

When Should You Use a Manual Text Box?
Graphical content such as photos and charts can work well either in placeholders or as manually
inserted objects. However, when it comes to text, you should stick with placeholders as often as
possible. Placeholder text appears in the Outline pane, whereas text in a manually inserted text
box does not. When the bulk of a presentation’s text is in manually created text boxes, the out-
line becomes less useful because it doesn’t contain the presentation text. In addition, when you
change to a different formatting theme that includes different positioning for placeholders — for
example, to accommodate a graphic on one side — the manual text boxes do not shift. As a
result, they might end up overlapping the new background graphic with unattractive results. In
a case such as this, you would need to manually go through each slide and adjust the positioning
of each text box.
However, there are times when a manually created text box is preferable or even necessary.
For example, suppose that you have a schematic diagram of a machine and you need to label
106

Chapter 4: Creating Slides and Text Boxes
some of the parts. Manually placed text boxes are perfect for these little snippets of text that are
scattered over the surface of the picture. Manual text boxes are also useful for warnings, tips,
and any other information that is tangential to the main discussion. Finally, if you want to vary
the placement of the text on each slide (consciously circumventing the consistency provided by
layouts), and you want to precisely position each box, then manual text boxes work well because
they do not shift their position when you apply different themes or templates to the presentation.
Tip
If you insert text in a placeholder and then change the slide’s layout so that the slide no longer contains that
placeholder (for example, if you switch to Title Only or Blank layout), the text remains on the slide, but it
becomes an orphan. If you delete the text box, then it simply disappears; a placeholder does not reappear.
However, it does not become a manual text box, because its content still appears in the Outline pane, while
a manual text box’s content does not. ■
Creating a Manual Text Box
To manually place a text box on a slide, follow these steps:
1.
If necessary, reposition the existing placeholders or objects on the slide to make room for
the new text box.
2.
On the Insert tab, click Text Box. The mouse pointer turns into a vertical line. You can
alternately use the Text Box icon in any of the Shapes galleries, such as the one on the
Insert tab.
3.
Do either of the following:
 To create a text box that automatically enlarges itself horizontally as you type more
text, but does not automatically wrap text to the next line, click once where you want
the text to start, and begin typing.
 To create a text box with a width that you specify, and that automatically wraps text
to the next line and grows in height as needed, click and drag to draw a box where
you want the text box to be. Its height will initially snap back to a single line’s height,
regardless of the height that you initially draw; however, it will grow in height as you
type text into it.
4.
Type the text that you want to appear in the text box.
Working with Text Boxes
Text boxes (either placeholder or manual) form the basis of most presentations. Now that you
know how to create them, and how to place text in them, let’s take a look at how to manipulate
the boxes themselves.
Cross-Reference
Are you looking for information about formatting text boxes — perhaps to apply a background color or a
border to one? See the formatting text boxes discussion in Chapter 7. ■
107

Part I: Building Your Presentation
Selecting Text Boxes
On the surface, this topic might seem like a no-brainer. Just click it, right? Well, almost. A text
box has two possible ‘‘selected’’ states. One state is that the box itself is selected, and the other is
that the insertion point is within the box. The difference is subtle, but it becomes clearer when
you issue certain commands. For example, if the insertion point is in the text box and you press
Delete, PowerPoint deletes the single character to the right of the insertion point. However, if
you select the entire text box and press Delete, PowerPoint deletes the entire text box and every-
thing in it.
To select the entire text box, click its border. You can tell that it is selected because the border
appears as a solid line. To move the insertion point within the text box, click inside the text
box. You can tell that the insertion point is there because you can see it ﬂashing inside, and
also because the box’s border now consists of a dashed line. Figure 4-12 shows the difference
between the two borders.
FIGURE 4-12
The border of a text box is different when the box itself is selected (left) and when the insertion
point is in the box (right).
In the rest of this book, when you see the phrase ‘‘select the text box,’’ it means the box itself
should be selected, and the insertion point should not appear in it. For most of the upcoming
sections it does not make any difference, although in a few cases it does.
Tip
When the insertion point is ﬂashing in a text box, you can press Esc to select the text box itself. ■
You can select more than one text box at once by holding down the Shift key as you click addi-
tional text boxes. This technique is useful when you want to select more than one text box, for
example, so that you can format them in the same way, or so that you can resize them by the
same amount.
Sizing a Text Box
The basic techniques for sizing text boxes in PowerPoint are the same for every object type (for
that matter, they are also the same as in other Ofﬁce applications). To resize a text box, or any
object, follow these steps:
108

Chapter 4: Creating Slides and Text Boxes
1.
Position the mouse pointer over a selection handle for the object. The mouse pointer
changes to a double-headed arrow. If you want to resize proportionally, make sure that
you use a corner selection handle, and hold down the Shift key as you drag.
2.
Click and drag the selection handle to resize the object’s border.
Caution
Allowing PowerPoint to manage placeholder size and position through layouts ensures consistency among
your slides. When you start changing the sizes and positions of placeholders on individual slides, you can
end up creating consistency problems, such as headings that aren’t in the same spot from slide to slide, or
company logos that shift between slides. ■
You can also set a text box’s size from the Size group on the Drawing Tools Format tab. When
the text box is selected, its current dimensions appear in the Height and Width boxes, as shown
in Figure 4-13. You can change the dimensions within these boxes.
FIGURE 4-13
You can set an exact size for a text box from the Format tab’s Size group.

launcher
You can also set the size of a text box from the Size and Position dialog box:
1.
Click the dialog box launcher in the Size group on the Drawing Tools Format tab, as
shown in Figure 4-13. The Format Shape dialog box opens with the Size tab displayed.
2.
On the Size tab, set the height and width for the text box, as shown in Figure 4-14.
To keep the size proportional, select the Lock Aspect Ratio check box in the Scale section
before you start adjusting the height or width.
3.
(Optional) Click Close to close the dialog box.
Tip
The Format Shape dialog box is non-modal. This means that you can leave it open and continue to work on
your presentation. It also means that any changes that you make in this dialog box are applied immediately;
there is no Cancel button in the dialog box to cancel your changes. To reverse a change, you can use the
Undo command (Ctrl+Z). ■

Positioning a Text Box
To move an object, simply drag it by any part of its border other than a selection handle. Select
the object, and then position the mouse pointer over a border so that the pointer turns into a
four-headed arrow. Then drag the object to a new position. With a text box, you must position
the mouse pointer over a border and not over the inside of the frame; with all other object types,
you don’t have to be that precise; you can move an object by dragging anywhere within it.
To set an exact position, use the Format Shape dialog box:
1.
Click the dialog box launcher in the Size group on the Drawing Tools Format tab, as
shown in Figure 4-13. The Format Shape dialog box opens.
2.
On the Position tab, shown in Figure 4-15, set the horizontal and vertical position, and
the point from which it is measured. By default, measurements are from the top-left
corner of the slide.
3.
(Optional) Click Close to close the dialog box.
Changing a Text Box’s AutoFit Behavior
When there is too much text to ﬁt in a text box, there are three things that may happen:
 Do Not AutoFit: The text and the box can continue at their default sizes, and the text can
overﬂow out of the box or be truncated.
110

Chapter 4: Creating Slides and Text Boxes
 Shrink Text on Overﬂow: The text can shrink its font size to ﬁt in the text box. This is
the default setting for placeholder text boxes.
 Resize Shape to Fit Text: The text box can enlarge to the size needed to contain the text.
This is the default setting for manual text boxes.
FIGURE 4-15
You can adjust the position from the Format Shape dialog box.
Whenever there is too much text in a placeholder box, the AutoFit icon appears in the
bottom-left corner. Click that icon to display a menu, as shown in Figure 4-16. From that menu,
you can turn AutoFit on or off. Depending on the text-box type, you might not have all the
menu items shown in Figure 4-16.
FIGURE 4-16
You can use the AutoFit icon’s menu to change the AutoFit setting for a text box.
111

Part I: Building Your Presentation
With a manual text box, the AutoFit icon does not appear, and so you must adjust the AutoFit
behavior in the text box’s properties. The following method works for both manual and place-
holder boxes:
1.
Right-click the border of the text box and choose Format Shape.
2.
Click Text Box.
3.
In the Autoﬁt section, choose one of the Autoﬁt options, as shown in Figure 4-17.
4.
Click Close.
FIGURE 4-17
You can set AutoFit properties in the Format Shape dialog box.
One other setting that also affects AutoFit behavior is the Wrap Text in Shape option. This on/off
toggle enables text to automatically wrap to the next line when it reaches the right edge of the
text box. By default, this setting is On for placeholder text boxes and for manual text boxes
that you create by dragging. However, it is Off by default for manual text boxes that you cre-
ate by clicking. You can change the setting by displaying the text box’s properties, as shown in
Figure 4-17, and selecting or deselecting the Wrap Text in Shape check box.
112

Summary
In this chapter, you learned how to create new slides, either from scratch or from outside
sources. You learned how to select, rearrange, and delete slides, and how to place content on a
slide. Along the way, you learned the difference between a content placeholder and a manually
inserted object, and how to create your own text boxes, move and resize objects, and ﬁnd or
replace text. These are all very basic skills, and perhaps not as interesting as some of the more
exciting topics to come, but mastering them will serve you well as you build your presentation.
In the next chapter, you’ll learn about themes and layouts, two of the innovative features in
PowerPoint 2010 that make it such an improvement over earlier versions. You’ll ﬁnd out how
a theme differs from a template and how it applies font, color, and effect formatting to a presen-
tation. You will then apply layouts and create your own custom layouts and themes.

M
ost presentations consist of multiple slides, so you’ll need a way
of ensuring consistency among them. Not only will you want each
slide (in most cases) to have the same background, fonts, and text
positioning, but you will also want a way of ensuring that any changes you
make to those settings later automatically populate across all your slides.
To accomplish these goals, PowerPoint offers layouts, themes, and masters.
Layouts determine the positioning of placeholders; themes assign color, font,
and background choices; and masters transfer theme settings to the slides
and provide an opportunity for repeated content, such as a logo, on each
slide. In this chapter you learn how to use layouts, themes, and masters to
create a presentation that is attractive, consistent, and easy to manage.
Understanding Layouts
and Themes
As you learned in Chapter 4, a layout is a positioning template. The lay-
out used for a slide determines what content placeholders will appear and
how they will be arranged. For example, the default layout, called Title and
Content, contains a placeholder for a title across the top of the slide and a
multipurpose placeholder for body content in the center.
A theme is a group of design settings. It includes color settings, font choices,
object effect settings, and in some cases also a background graphic. In
Figure 5-1, the theme applied is called Concourse, and it is responsible for
the colored swoop in the corner, the color of that swoop, and the fonts used
on the slide. A theme is applied to a slide master, which is a sample slide
and not part of the regular presentation, existing only behind-the-scenes to
provide its settings to the real slides. It holds
115

Part I: Building Your Presentation
the formatting that you want to be consistent among all the slides in the presentation (or at least
a group of them, because a presentation can have multiple slide masters). Technically, you do
not apply a theme to a slide; you apply a theme to a slide master, and then you apply a slide
master to a slide. That’s because a slide master can actually contain some additional elements
besides the formatting of the theme such as extra graphics, dates, footer text, and so on.
FIGURE 5-1
In Slide Master view, notice that each layout has its own customizable layout master.

Themes versus Templates
PowerPoint 2007 and 2010 handle themes, layouts, and slide masters very differently from ear-
lier versions, and this can take some getting used to if you’re upgrading from PowerPoint 2003
or earlier.
In PowerPoint 2003 and earlier, you applied a design template (not a theme) to the slide master.
A design template was a regular PowerPoint template ﬁle (.pot extension) with color choices, font
choices, and background graphics. You could have multiple slide masters in a single presenta-
tion, so you could base some slides on a different design template than others. PowerPoint 2007
and 2010 still use templates, but the primary means of changing the presentation’s look and feel
is to apply different themes to the slide master rather than different templates to the presentation
as a whole. A template with multiple slide masters can carry multiple themes.
116

Chapter 5: Working with Layouts, Themes, and Masters
A theme is both simpler than and more complex than a template. It is simpler because it cannot
hold some of the things a real template can hold. A theme can provide only font, color, effect,
and background settings to the presentation. (It can also provide slide layouts, but let’s post-
pone that discussion for a bit.) On the other hand, a theme can also do more than a PowerPoint
template; you can apply a theme saved as a separate ﬁle to other Ofﬁce applications, so you can
share its color, font, and effect settings with Word or Excel, for example.
Where Themes Are Stored
A theme is an XML ﬁle (or a snippet of XML code embedded in a presentation or template ﬁle).
A theme can come from any of these sources:
 Built-in: Some themes are embedded in PowerPoint itself and are available from the
Themes gallery on the Design tab regardless of the template in use.
 Custom (automatically loaded): The default storage location for theme ﬁles in Windows
Vista or Windows 7 is C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates\
Document Themes. For Windows XP, it is C:\Documents and Settings\username\
Application Data\Microsoft\Templates\Document Themes. All themes (and templates
containing themes) stored here are automatically displayed among the gallery of theme
choices on the Design tab, in a Custom category.
 Inherited from starting template: If you start a presentation using a template other than
the default blank one, that template might have one or more themes included in it.
 Stored in current presentation: If you modify a theme in Slide Master view while you
are working on a presentation, the modiﬁed code for the theme is embedded in that pre-
sentation ﬁle.
 Stored in a separate ﬁle: If you save a theme (using any of a variety of methods you’ll
learn later in this chapter), you create a separate theme ﬁle with a .thmx extension. These
ﬁles can be shared among other Ofﬁce applications, so you can standardize settings such
as font and color choices across applications. (Some of the unique PowerPoint portions of
the theme are ignored when you use the theme in other applications.)
Themes, Layouts, and Slide Master View
In PowerPoint 2010, the slide master has separate layout masters for each layout, and you can
customize and create new layouts. For example, Figure 5-1 shows Slide Master view (View ➪
Slide Master). Notice along the left side that there is a different, separately customizable layout
master for each available layout, all grouped beneath the slide master. Any changes you make to
the slide master trickle down to the individual layout masters, but you can also customize each
of the individual layout masters to override a trickle-down setting. For example, on a particular
layout you can choose to omit the background graphic to free up its space on the slide for extra
content.
A master is a set of speciﬁcations that govern formatting and appearance. PowerPoint actually has
three masters: the Slide Master (for slides), the Handout Master (for handouts), and the Notes
Master (for speaker notes). This chapter deals only with the Slide Master.
117

Part I: Building Your Presentation
Cross-Reference
For more on the Handout and Notes Masters, see Chapter 19. ■
The slide master holds the settings from a theme and applies them to one or more slides in your
presentation. A slide master is not exactly the same thing as a theme because the theme can also
be external to PowerPoint and used in other programs, but there’s a rough equivalency there. A
slide master is the representation of a particular theme applied to a particular presentation.
Note
Which themes appear in Slide Master view? The ones you have applied to at least one slide in the presen-
tation, plus any custom themes copied from another presentation (see the section ‘‘Copying a Theme from
Another Presentation’’ for more details) and any themes inherited from the template used to create the pre-
sentation. The built-in themes do not show up here unless they are in use. ■
When you make changes to a slide master, those changes trickle down to the individual lay-
out masters associated with it. When you make changes to an individual layout master, those
changes are conﬁned to that layout in that master only.
To enter Slide Master view, choose View ➪Slide Master. A Slide Master tab appears. To exit
from Slide Master view, choose Slide Master ➪Close Master View or select a different view from
the View tab.
Changing a Slide’s Layout
As you construct your presentation, you may ﬁnd it useful to change a slide’s layout. For
example, you might want to switch from a slide that contains one big content placeholder to
one that has two side-by-side placeholders, to compare/contrast two lists, drawings, or diagrams.
Many of the layouts PowerPoint provides contain multipurpose placeholders that accept vari-
ous types of content. For example, the default layout, called Title and Content, has placeholders
for a slide title plus a single type of content — text, a table, a chart, a picture, a piece of clip
art, a SmartArt diagram, or a movie. You choose the layout you want based on the number and
arrangement of the placeholders, and not the type of content that will go into them.
When you change to a different layout, you change the type and/or positioning of the place-
holders on it. If the previous placeholders had content in them, that content shifts to a new
location on the slide to reﬂect the different positioning for that placeholder type. If the new lay-
out does not contain a placeholder appropriate for that content, the content remains on the slide
but becomes orphaned. This means it is a free-ﬂoating object, outside of the layout. You need to
manually position an orphaned object if it’s not in the right spot. However, if you later apply a
different layout that does contain a placeholder for the orphaned object, it snaps back into that
placeholder.
To switch a slide to a different layout, follow these steps:
1.
Select the slide or slides to affect.
2.
On the Home tab, click Layout. A menu of layouts appears, as shown in Figure 5-2.
3.
Click the desired layout.
118

Chapter 5: Working with Layouts, Themes, and Masters
FIGURE 5-2
Switch to a different layout for the selected slide(s).
Cross-Reference
If you want to modify a built-in layout, or create your own layouts, see ‘‘Customizing and Creating Layouts’’
later in this chapter. ■
When a presentation has more than one slide master deﬁned, separate layouts appear for each of
the slide master themes. Figure 5-3 shows the Layout menu for a presentation that has two slide
masters.
Applying a Theme
As you learned in ‘‘Understanding Layouts and Themes’’ at the beginning of this chapter, themes
are the PowerPoint 2010 way of applying different designs to the presentation. A theme includes
a background graphic (usually), color and font choices, and graphic effect settings. A theme can
also include custom layouts. The method for applying a theme depends on whether that theme
is already available in the current presentation or not. Some themes are built into PowerPoint so
that they are always available; other themes are available only when you use certain templates,
or when you speciﬁcally apply them from an external ﬁle. The following sections explain each of
those possibilities.
Note
Themes, also called design themes, contain a combination of colors, fonts, effects, backgrounds, and layouts.
There are also more specialized themes: color themes, font themes, and effect themes. When this book uses
the term ‘‘theme’’ alone, it’s referring to a design theme. Where there is potential for confusion, the book
calls it a design theme to help differentiate it from the lesser types of themes. ■
119

Part I: Building Your Presentation
FIGURE 5-3
When there are multiple slide masters, each one’s layout is separate.
Applying a Theme from the Gallery
A gallery in PowerPoint is a menu of samples from which you can choose. The Themes gallery is
a menu of all of the built-in themes plus any additional themes available from the current tem-
plate or presentation ﬁle.
To select a theme from the gallery, follow these steps:
1.
(Optional) If you want to affect only certain slides, select them. (Slide Sorter view works
well for this.)
2.
On the Design tab, in the Themes group, if the theme you want appears, click it, and skip
the rest of these steps. If the theme you want does not appear, you will need to open the
gallery. To do so, click the down arrow with the line over it, as shown in Figure 5-4.
120

Chapter 5: Working with Layouts, Themes, and Masters
FIGURE 5-4
Open the Themes gallery by clicking the down arrow with the line above it.
Click here
The Themes gallery opens, as shown in Figure 5-5. The gallery is divided into sections
based upon the source of the theme. Themes stored in the current presentation appear
at the top; custom themes you have added appear next. Built-in themes appear at the
bottom.
FIGURE 5-5
Select the desired theme from the menu.
Tip
You can drag the bottom-right corner of the menu to resize the gallery. To ﬁlter the gallery so that only a cer-
tain category of theme appears, click the down arrow to the right of All Themes at the top and select a category
from the menu that appears. ■
121

Part I: Building Your Presentation
3.
Click the theme you want to apply.
 If you selected multiple slides in step 1, the theme is applied only to them.
 If you selected a single slide in step 1, the theme is applied to the entire presentation.
Tip
To override the default behavior in step 3, so that you can apply a different theme to a single
slide, right-click instead of clicking in step 3 and choose Apply to Selected Slide(s) from the short-
cut menu. ■
Applying a Theme from a Theme or Template File
You can open and use externally saved theme ﬁles in any Ofﬁce application. This makes it pos-
sible to share color, font, and other settings between applications to create consistency between
documents of various types. You can also save and load themes from templates.
Cross-Reference
To create your own theme ﬁles, see ‘‘Creating a New Theme’’ later in this chapter. ■
To apply a theme to the presentation from a theme or template ﬁle, follow these steps:
1.
On the Design tab, open the Themes gallery (see Figure 5-5) and click Browse for Themes.
The Choose Theme or Themed Document dialog box opens.
2.
Navigate to the folder containing the ﬁle and select it.
3.
Click Apply.
Note
Any custom themes you might have previously saved are located by default in C:\Users\username\AppData\
Roaming\Microsoft\Templates\Document Themes (in Windows Vista or Windows 7) or C:\
Documents and Settings\username\Application Data\Microsoft\Templates\Document Themes (in
Windows XP). However, you don’t need to navigate to that location to open a theme ﬁle because all
themes stored here are automatically included in the gallery already. ■
Changing Colors, Fonts, and Effects
In addition to overall themes, which govern several types of formatting, PowerPoint also provides
many built-in color, font, and effect themes that you can apply separately from your choice of
overall theme. So, for example, you can apply a theme that contains a background design you
like, and then change the colors and fonts for it.
In the following sections, you’ll learn how to apply some of these built-in color, font, and effect
settings to a presentation without changing the overall theme. Then later in the chapter you will
learn how to save these customized settings as new themes and even how to create your own
custom color and font settings in a theme.
122

Chapter 5: Working with Layouts, Themes, and Masters
Understanding Color Placeholders
To understand how PowerPoint changes colors via a theme, you must know something about
how it handles color placeholders in general. PowerPoint uses a set of color placeholders for the
bulk of its color formatting. Because each item’s color is deﬁned by a placeholder, and not as a
ﬁxed color, you can easily change the colors by switching to a different color theme. This way if
you decide, for example, that you want all the slide titles to be blue rather than green, you make
the change once and it is applied to all slides automatically.
A group of colors assigned to preset placeholders is a color theme. PowerPoint contains 20+
built-in color themes that are available regardless of the overall theme applied to the presen-
tation. Because most design themes use placeholders to deﬁne their colors, you can apply the
desired design theme to the presentation and then ﬁne-tune the colors afterward by experiment-
ing with the built-in color themes.
How many color placeholders are there in a color theme? There are actually 12, but sometimes
not all of them are available to be applied to individual objects. When you choose a color theme
(Design ➪Colors), the gallery of themes from which you choose shows only the ﬁrst eight colors
of each color theme. It doesn’t matter so much here because you can’t apply individual colors
from there anyway. When selecting colors from a color picker (used for applying ﬁll and border
color to speciﬁc objects), as in Figure 5-6, there are 10 theme swatches. And when you deﬁne a
new custom color theme, there are 12 placeholders to set up. The ﬁnal two are for visited and
unvisited hyperlinks; these colors aren’t included in a color picker.
FIGURE 5-6
PowerPoint uses color pickers such as this one to enable you to easily apply color placeholders to
objects.
Switching Color Themes
After applying the overall theme you want, you might want to apply different colors. To switch
to a different color theme, follow these steps:
1.
(Optional) To apply a different color theme to a slide master other than the default one,
open Slide Master view (View ➪Slide Master) and click the desired slide master. Other-
wise, the color change will apply to all slides that use the default slide master. The default
slide master is the ﬁrst one listed in Slide Master view.
123

Part I: Building Your Presentation
2.
On the Design tab (or the Slide Master tab if in Slide Master view), click Colors. A gallery
of color themes opens.
3.
(Optional) Point to a color theme and observe the preview on the slide behind the list.
4.
Click the desired color theme. See Figure 5-7.
FIGURE 5-7
Select the desired theme from the dialog box.
Cross-Reference
You can also create custom color themes; see the section ‘‘Creating a Custom Color Theme’’ later in this
chapter for details. ■
Understanding Font Placeholders
By default in most themes and templates, text box fonts are not set to a speciﬁc font, but to one
of two designations: Heading or Body. Then a font theme deﬁnes what speciﬁc fonts to use. To
change the fonts across the entire presentation, all you have to do is apply a different font theme.
124

Chapter 5: Working with Layouts, Themes, and Masters
A font theme is an XML-based speciﬁcation that deﬁnes a pair of fonts: one for headings and one
for body text. Then that font is applied to the text boxes in the presentation based on their sta-
tuses of Heading or Body. For example, all of the slide titles are usually set to Heading, and all
of the content placeholders and manual text boxes are usually set to Body.
In a blank presentation (default blank template), when you click inside a slide title placeholder
box, you see Calibri (Headings) in the Font group on the Home tab. Figure 5-8 shows that the
current font is Calibri, but that it is being used only because the font theme speciﬁes it. You
could change the font theme to Verdana/Verdana, for example, and then the font designation for
that box would appear as Verdana (Headings).
FIGURE 5-8
When some text is using a font placeholder rather than a ﬁxed font, (Headings) or (Body) appears
after its name in the Font group on the Home tab.
In some font themes, the same font is used for both headings and body. In a default blank
presentation both fonts are Calibri, for example, and the Verdana/Verdana set is an additional
example. In many other font themes, though, the heading and body fonts are different.
Switching Font Themes
After applying an overall theme, you might decide you want to use different fonts in the presen-
tation. To switch to a different font theme, follow these steps:
1.
(Optional) To apply a different font theme to a slide master other than the default one,
open Slide Master view (View ➪Slide Master) and click the desired slide master. Other-
wise, the font change will apply to all slides that use the default slide master. The default
slide master is the ﬁrst one listed in Slide Master view.
2.
On the Design tab (or Slide Master tab, if in Slide Master view), click Fonts. A gallery of
font themes opens.
3.
(Optional) Point to a font theme and observe the change on the slide behind the list.
4.
Click the desired font theme. See Figure 5-9.
Changing the Effect Theme
Effect themes apply to several types of drawings that PowerPoint can construct, including
SmartArt, charts, and drawn lines and shapes. They make the surfaces of objects formatted with
3-D attributes look like different textures (more or less shiny-looking, colors more or less deep,
and so on).
125

Part I: Building Your Presentation
FIGURE 5-9
Select the font theme you want for your slide.
To change the effect theme, follow these steps:
1.
On the Design tab, click Effects. A gallery of effect themes opens.
2.
(Optional) Point to a theme and observe the change on the slide behind the list. (This
works only if you have an object on that slide that is affected by the effect theme; see the
sidebar ‘‘Setting Up a Graphic on Which to Test Effect Themes’’ to set up such an object.)
3.
Click the desired effect theme. See Figure 5-10.
Setting Up a Graphic on Which to Test Effect Themes
Because you haven’t worked with any of these graphics yet in this book, you haven’t had an opportunity
to try them out yet. Effect themes are most evident when you use colorful 3-D graphics, so do the
following to construct a dummy diagram that you can use to try out effect themes:
1. On the Insert tab, click SmartArt.
2. Click Cycle, click the top left diagram, and click OK.
126

Chapter 5: Working with Layouts, Themes, and Masters
3. On the SmartArt Tools Design tab, click Change Colors, and click the ﬁrst sample
under Colorful.
4. On the SmartArt Tools Design tab, open the SmartArt Styles gallery and click the ﬁrst
sample under 3-D.
Now you have a diagram on which you can see the effect themes applied.
FIGURE 5-10
Select the desired effect theme.
Creating and Managing Custom Color
and Font Themes
You can deﬁne your own custom color themes and font themes, and save them for reuse in other
presentations. By default these are saved in the personal folders for the logged-in user on the
local PC, and they remain available to that user regardless of the theme or template in use.
These custom color and font themes are also included if you save the overall theme as a sepa-
rate theme ﬁle (.thmx), as you will learn to do later in this chapter, so that you can take those
settings to another PC or send them to some other user.
127

Part I: Building Your Presentation
Creating a Custom Color Theme
A custom color theme deﬁnes speciﬁc colors for each of the 12 color placeholders (including the
two that you can’t directly use — the ones for hyperlinks). To create a custom color theme, ﬁrst
apply a color theme to the current presentation that is as close as possible to the color theme
you want. This makes it easier because you have to redeﬁne fewer placeholders. Then follow
these steps:
1.
On the Design tab, open the Colors list and choose Create New Theme Colors. The Create
New Theme Colors dialog box opens.
2.
Type a name for the new color theme in the Name box, replacing the default name (Cus-
tom 1, or other number if there is already a Custom 1).
3.
Click a color placeholder and open its menu. See Figure 5-11.
FIGURE 5-11
Select the color for the chosen placeholder.
4.
Click a color. Alternatively, you can click More Colors, select a color from the Colors dia-
log box (see Figure 5-12), and click OK. The Colors dialog box has two tabs: The Standard
tab has color swatches, and the Custom tab enables you to deﬁne a color numerically by
its RGB (Red Green Blue) or HSL (Hue Saturation Lightness).
5.
Redeﬁne any other colors as needed.
6.
Click Save. The color theme is saved, and now appears at the top of the Colors gallery, in
the Custom area.
128

Chapter 5: Working with Layouts, Themes, and Masters
FIGURE 5-12
Choose a custom color if none of the standard colors is appropriate.
Sharing a Custom Color Theme with Others
A custom color theme is available only to the currently logged-in user on the PC on which it is
created. If you want to share it with another user on the same PC, you can copy it into his or
her user folder in Windows Vista or Windows 7:
C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates\Document Themes\Theme Colors
where username is that user’s login name.
 In Windows XP:
C:\Documents and Settings\username\Application Data\Microsoft\Templates\Document
Themes\Theme Colors.
 The default color themes are located in:
C:\Program Files\Microsoft Ofﬁce\Document Themes 14\Theme Colors regardless of the
operating system version.
Another way to share a custom color theme is to create the new color theme and then save the
(overall) theme to a theme ﬁle (.thmx). See ‘‘Creating a New Theme’’ later in this chapter. The
resulting theme ﬁle will contain the custom colors, as well as the usual theme content.
Deleting a Custom Color Theme
A custom color theme remains until you delete it from the Theme Colors folder for your user
proﬁle. To delete a theme color, use Windows Explorer to navigate to this folder:
C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates\Document Themes\Theme Colors
129

Part I: Building Your Presentation
where username is your login name, and you’ll ﬁnd an .xml ﬁle for each of your custom color
themes. Delete the ﬁles for the color themes that you want to delete. You can also right-click the
color theme in the Gallery, click Edit, and then click the Delete button in the Edit Theme Colors
dialog box.
Tip
If you don’t want to delete a custom color theme, but you also don’t want it showing up on your Colors
menu in PowerPoint all the time, move the ﬁle to a folder outside of the Document Themes folder hierar-
chy. For example, create an Unused Themes folder on your hard disk and move it there until you need it.
When you want to use the custom color theme again, move the ﬁle back to its original location ■
If you don’t want to exit from PowerPoint to delete the color theme, you can take advantage of
the fact that you can use most dialog boxes in PowerPoint that save or open ﬁles to manage ﬁles
in general. Follow these steps:
1.
Open any dialog box that saves or opens ﬁles. For example, on the Design tab, open the
Themes gallery and choose Browse for Themes.
2.
Navigate to the location of the color themes:
C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates\Document
Themes\Theme Colors
3.
Open the File Type list and choose All Files so that all of the ﬁles appear.
4.
Select the ﬁle for the color theme that you want to delete and press the Delete key on the
keyboard.
5.
Click Cancel to close the dialog box.
Creating a Custom Font Theme
You can create your own custom font themes, which are then available in all presentations. A
custom font theme deﬁnes two fonts: one for headings and one for body text. To create a custom
font theme, follow these steps:
1.
On the Design tab, open the Fonts list and choose Create New Theme Fonts. The Create
New Theme Fonts dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 5-13.
FIGURE 5-13
Create a new custom font theme by specifying the fonts to use.
130

Chapter 5: Working with Layouts, Themes, and Masters
2.
Type a name for the new font theme in the Name box, replacing the default text there.
3.
Open the Heading Font drop-down list and select the desired font for headings.
4.
Open the Body Font drop-down list and select the desired font for body text.
5.
Click Save. The font theme is saved, and now appears at the top of the Fonts list, in the
Custom area.
Sharing a Custom Font Theme with Others
A custom font theme is available only to the currently logged-in user on the PC on which it is
created. If you want to share it with another user on the same PC, you can copy it into his or
her user folder:
 In Windows Vista or Windows 7:
C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates\Document Themes\Theme
Fonts
where username is that user’s login name.
 In Windows XP:
C:\Documents and Settings\username\Application Data\Microsoft\Templates\Document
Themes\Theme Fonts
You can also share a custom font theme by creating it and then saving the (overall) theme as a
new theme (.thmx) ﬁle. Then you can share that theme ﬁle with others via e-mail, disk, or other
distribution methods.
Cross-Reference
To save your theme as a new theme, see the section ‘‘Creating a New Theme.’’ ■
Deleting a Custom Font Theme
A custom font theme remains until you delete it from the Theme Fonts folder for your user pro-
ﬁle. To delete a font theme, use Windows Explorer to navigate to this folder:
 In Windows Vista or Windows 7:
C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates\Document Themes\Theme
Fonts
 In Windows XP:
C:\Documents and Settings\username\Application Data\Microsoft\Templates\Document
Themes\Theme Fonts
where username is your login name, and you’ll ﬁnd an .xml ﬁle for each of your custom font
themes. Delete the ﬁles for the font themes that you want to delete.
You can also delete it from within PowerPoint by browsing for the ﬁle with any dialog box that
saves or opens ﬁles, or by right-clicking the font theme in the Gallery, clicking Edit, and then
clicking Delete in the Edit Theme Fonts dialog box.
131

Part I: Building Your Presentation
Cross-Reference
Deleting a custom font theme from a dialog box is essentially the same as deleting a custom color theme.
See the section ‘‘Deleting a Custom Color Theme’’ for more details. ■
Changing the Background
The background is the color, texture, pattern, or image that is applied to the entire slide (or slide
master), on which everything else sits. By its very deﬁnition, it applies to the entire surface of
the slide; you cannot have a partial background. However, you can have a background graphic
overlaid on top of the background. A background graphic is a graphic image placed on the slide
master that complements and works with the background.
It’s important to understand the distinction between a background and a background graphic
because even though most themes contain both, they are set up differently, and making the
change you want to the overall appearance of your slides often involves changing both. For
example, Figure 5-14 shows the Concourse theme applied to a slide master. The slide back-
ground is pure white, and a blue and black background graphic is overlaid on it.
FIGURE 5-14
A slide’s background is separate from its background graphic(s) if any are present.
Background
(plain white)
Background graphic
(on slide master)
Most themes consist of both background formatting (even if it is just a solid color) and a back-
ground graphic. The background graphics included in the built-in themes in PowerPoint are
unique to those themes, and not available as separate graphics outside of them. So, for example,
if you want the colored swoop shown in Figure 5-14, the only way to get it is to apply the
Concourse theme. Because the decorative background graphics are unique to each theme, many
132

Chapter 5: Working with Layouts, Themes, and Masters
people choose a theme based on the desired background graphic, and then customize the slide
master’s appearance to modify the theme as needed.
Tip
To use a background graphic from one template with the look-and-feel of another, apply the ﬁrst theme to
a slide, and then in Slide Master view copy the background graphic to the clipboard. Then apply the second
theme and paste the graphic from the clipboard into the slide master. ■
Applying a Background Style
Background styles are preset background formats that come with the built-in themes in Pow-
erPoint. Depending on the theme you apply, different background styles are available. These
background styles all use the color placeholders from the theme, so their color offerings change
depending on the color theme applied.
To apply a background style, follow these steps:
1.
(Optional) To affect only certain slides, select them. (Or, to affect certain layouts, go into
Slide Master view and choose the layouts.)
2.
On the Design tab, click Background Styles. A gallery of styles appears, as shown in
Figure 5-15.
FIGURE 5-15
Apply a preset background style.
3.
Click the desired style to apply it to the entire presentation. Alternatively, you can
right-click the desired style and choose Apply to Selected Slides.
You cannot customize background styles or add your own custom background styles; there are
always 12 of them, and they are always determined by the theme. If you need a different back-
ground, you can choose Format Backgrounds and then customize the background settings as
described in the following sections.
133

Part I: Building Your Presentation
Applying a Background Fill
A custom background ﬁll can include solid colors, gradients, textures, or graphics. Because
Chapter 10 covers these in more detail, this section covers how to specify your own background
ﬁll, which involves the following steps:
1.
(Optional) To affect only certain slides, select them. . (Or, to affect certain layouts, go into
Slide Master view and choose the layouts.)
2.
On the Design tab, click Background Styles. The Background Styles gallery opens.
3.
Click Format Background. The Format Background dialog box opens.
4.
Choose the option button that best describes the type of ﬁll you want. See Figure 5-16.
5.
Set the options for the ﬁll type that you chose. For example, in Figure 5-16, click the
Color button and choose a solid color. The changes you make apply immediately.
FIGURE 5-16
Select a background ﬁll type, and conﬁgure the options for the type you chose.
Cross-Reference
See Chapter 10 for details about these ﬁll types and how to conﬁgure their options. ■
6.
(Optional) To apply the change to all slides, click Apply to All. Otherwise the change will
apply only to the slides you selected in step 1.
7.
(Optional) To apply a different background to some other slides, select them and repeat
steps 4 and 5. The Format Background dialog box is non-modal, so its changes are applied
immediately and you can select things in the presentation ﬁle without closing it.
8.
Click Close to exit the dialog box.
134

Chapter 5: Working with Layouts, Themes, and Masters
Working with Background Graphics
In the preceding steps, one of the ﬁll types you could choose was Picture or Texture Fill. This
type of ﬁll covers the entire background with the picture or texture that you specify.
This is not a background graphic, however. A background graphic is an object or a picture over-
laid on top of the background on the slide master. It complements the background, and it might
or might not cover the entire background.
Note
Some theme-provided background graphics actually consist of multiple shapes grouped together. You can
ungroup them, as shown in Chapter 10, so that you can modify or remove only a portion of the background
graphic. ■
Displaying and Hiding Background Graphics
Sometimes a background graphic can get in the way of the slide’s content. For example, on a
slide that contains a large chart or diagram, a background graphic around the border of the slide
can overlap the content. You don’t have to delete the background graphic entirely to solve this
problem; you can turn it off for individual slides. To hide the background graphics on one or
more slides, follow these steps:
1.
Select the slide or slides to affect.
2.
On the Design tab, select the Hide Background Graphics check box.
Deselect the check box to redisplay the background graphics later as needed.
Deleting Background Graphics
The background graphics reside on the slide master, so to remove one, you must use Slide Mas-
ter view. Follow these steps:
1.
On the View tab, click Slide Master. Slide Master view opens.
2.
Select the slide master or layout master that contains the graphic to delete.
3.
Click the background graphic to select it.
4.
Press the Delete key on the keyboard.
Tip
Some background graphics are on the slide master itself, and others are on individual layout masters.
The background graphics on the slide master trickle down to each of its layout masters, but can’t be
selected/deleted from the individual layout masters.
To use a background graphic only on certain layouts, cut it from the slide master to the Clipboard (Ctrl+X),
and then paste it individually onto each layout master desired (Ctrl+V). Alternatively, turn on the back-
ground graphic for the slide master and then use Hide Background Graphics on individual layout masters
that should not contain it. ■
135

Part I: Building Your Presentation
Adding Your Own Background Graphics
You can add your own background graphics, either to the slide master or to individual layout
masters. This works just like adding any other graphic to a slide (see Chapter 13), except you
add it to the master instead of to an individual slide.
Inserting pictures is covered in greater detail in Chapter 13, but here are the basic steps for
adding a background graphic:
1.
Display the slide master or layout master on which you want to place the background
graphic.
2.
Do any of the following:
 On the Insert tab, click Picture. Select a picture to insert and click Open.
 On the Insert tab, click Clip Art. Search for a piece of clip art to use, and insert it on
the master.
 In any application (including PowerPoint), copy any graphic to the Clipboard by press-
ing Ctrl+C; then display the master and paste the graphic by pressing Ctrl+V.
Tip
Most of the background graphics that come with the built-in themes are either semi-transparent or use one
of the placeholder colors for their ﬁll. Therefore changing the color theme also changes the color of the
background graphic. Keep that in mind if you are creating your own background graphics; it’s better to use
theme colors or transparency than to use ﬁxed colors that might clash with a color theme that you later
apply. ■
Working with Placeholders
As a review, to enter Slide Master view, display the View tab and click Slide Master. One or more
slide masters appear in the left pane, with its own subordinate layout masters. A slide master has
ﬁve preset placeholders that you can individually remove or move around. Figure 5-17 points
them out on a slide master with the Concourse theme applied, but they might be in different
locations in other themes:
 Title: The placeholder for the title on each slide
 Text: The main content placeholder on each slide
 Date: The box that displays the current date on each slide
 Slide number: The box that displays the slide number on each slide
 Footer: A box that displays repeated text at the bottom of each slide
These elements are all enabled by default, but the Footer is empty by default so it is not visible
on individual slides unless you type some text into it in Slide Master view or add text to it using
Insert Header and Footer. Each of these elements trickles down to the layout masters beneath it,
so formatting, moving, or deleting one of these elements from the slide master also changes it on
each of the layouts. See Figure 5-17 for an example of the various placeholders.
136

Chapter 5: Working with Layouts, Themes, and Masters
FIGURE 5-17
Each slide master contains these placeholders (or can contain them).
Slide Number
Date

Title
Text
Formatting a Placeholder
You can format the text in each of the placeholders on the slide master just like any regular text,
and that formatting carries over to all slides and layouts based on it. For example, if you format
the code in the Slide Number box with a certain font and size, it will appear that way on every
slide that uses that slide master. You can also format the placeholder boxes just like any other
text boxes. For example, you can add a border around the page number’s box, and/or ﬁll its
background with color.
Tip
If you want to make all of the text in a heading all-caps or small-caps, use the Font dialog box. From the
Home tab, click the dialog box launcher in the Font group and select the Small Caps or All Caps check box
there. ■
Cross-Reference
See Chapters 6 and 7 to learn how to format text. See Chapter 7 for more information about formatting text
boxes. ■
Moving, Deleting, or Restoring Placeholders
You can move each of the placeholders on the slide master or an individual layout master. For
example, you might decide you want the Footer box at the top of the slide rather than the bot-
tom, or that you want to center the slide number at the bottom of the slide:
 To move a placeholder, click it to select it and then drag its border, just as you did with
text boxes in Chapter 4.
137

Part I: Building Your Presentation
 To delete one of the placeholders on the slide master, select its box and press the Delete
key on the keyboard. Deleting it from the slide master deletes it from all of the associated
layouts as well.
 To remove all three of the footer placeholders at once (Date, Footer, and Slide Number)
display the Slide Master tab and deselect the Footers check box.
 To restore deleted placeholders on the slide master, display the Slide Master tab and select
the Footers check box. If any of the footer placeholders (Date, Footer, or Slide Number)
were previously deleted, they reappear.
Caution
Restored placeholders might not appear in the same spots as they did originally; you might need to move
them. To put the placeholders back to their original locations, reapply the theme from the Themes button
on the Slide Master tab. ■
Here are some more details you should remember about deleting and restoring:
 On an individual layout master, you can quickly delete and restore the Title and Footer
placeholders by selecting or deselecting the Title and Footers check boxes on the
Slide Master tab. The ‘‘footer’’ that this check box refers to is actually all three of the
bottom-of-the-slide elements: the actual footer, the date box, and the slide number box.
 You can also individually delete the placeholders from a layout master, the same as you can
on a slide master. Just select a placeholder box and press the Delete key.
 You can restore all of the placeholders, except Text, by selecting the aforementioned check
boxes on the Slide Master tab. Whenever any of the three footer boxes are missing, the
Footers check box becomes cleared, and you can restore the missing box or boxes by
re-selecting the check box.
 You cannot restore the Text placeholder, however, on an individual layout master. You
must recreate it with the Insert Placeholder command.
Cross-Reference
For more on the Insert Placeholder command, see the section, ‘‘Customizing and Creating Layouts.’’ ■
Displaying the Date, Number, and Footer on Slides
Even though the placeholders for Date, Number, and Footer might appear on the slide master,
they do not appear on the actual slides in the presentation unless you enable them. This might
seem counterintuitive at ﬁrst, but it’s actually a beneﬁt. PowerPoint enables you to turn the date,
number, and footer on and off without having to delete, recreate, or reformat their placeholders.
You can decide at the last minute whether you want them to display or not, and you can choose
differently for different audiences and situations.
You can control all three areas from the Header and Footer dialog box. To open it, from the
Insert tab click Header and Footer. (Clicking Date and Time or clicking Number opens the same
dialog box.) Then on the Slide tab, select the check boxes for each of the three elements that you
want to use, as shown in Figure 5-18.
138

Chapter 5: Working with Layouts, Themes, and Masters
FIGURE 5-18
Choose which footer elements should appear on slides.
Date and Time
You can set Date and Time either to Update Automatically or to Fixed:
 Update Automatically pulls the current date from the computer’s clock and formats it in
whatever format you choose from the drop-down list. You can also select a language and
a Calendar Type (although this is probably not an issue unless you are presenting in some
other country than the one for which your version of PowerPoint was developed).
 Fixed prints whatever you enter in the Fixed text box. When Fixed is enabled, it defaults
to today’s date in the m/dd/yyyy format.
Tip
In addition to (or instead of) placing the date on each slide, you can insert an individual instance of the
current date or time on a slide, perhaps as part of a sentence. To do so, position the insertion point inside
a text box or placeholder and then on the Insert tab, click Date and Time. Select the format you want from
the dialog box that appears and click OK. ■
Slide Number
This option shows the slide number on each slide, wherever the Number placeholder is posi-
tioned. You can format the Number placeholder on the master slide with the desired font, size,
and other text attributes
Cross-Reference
See Chapter 6 for more on formatting. ■
139

Part I: Building Your Presentation
By default, slide numbering starts with 1. You can start with some other number if you like by
following these steps:
1.
Close Slide Master view if it is open. To do so, click the Close button on the Slide Master
tab.
2.
On the Design tab, click the dialog box launcher in the Page Setup group. The Page Setup
dialog box opens.
3.
In the Number Slides From box, increase the number to the desired starting number.
4.
Click OK.
Tip
You can insert the slide number on an individual slide, either instead of or in addition to the numbering on
the Slide Master. Position the insertion point, and then on the Insert tab, click Slide Number. If you are in
Slide master view, this places a code on the Slide Master for the slide number that looks like this: <#>. If
you are on an individual slide, it inserts the same code, but the code itself is hidden and the actual number
appears. ■
Footer
The footer is blank by default. Select the Footer check box, and then enter the desired text in the
Footer box. You can then format the footer text from the slide master as you would any other
text (see Chapter 6 for details about formatting). You can also enter the footer text in the Header
and Footer dialog box’s Footer text box.
Don’t Show on Title Slide
This check box in the Header and Footer dialog box suppresses the date/time, page number,
and footer on slides that use the Title Slide layout. Many people like to hide those elements on
title slides for a cleaner look and to avoid repeated information (for example, if the current date
appears in the subtitle box on the title slide).
Customizing and Creating Layouts
In addition to customizing the slide master (including working with its preset placeholder boxes,
as you just learned), you can fully customize the individual layout masters.
A layout master takes some of its settings from the slide master with which it is associated. For
example, by default it takes its background, fonts, theme colors, and preset placeholder position-
ing from the slide master. But the layout master also can be individually customized; you can
override the slide master’s choices for background, colors, and fonts, and you can create, modify,
and delete various types of content placeholders.
140

Chapter 5: Working with Layouts, Themes, and Masters
Understanding Content Placeholders
You can insert seven basic types of content on a PowerPoint slide: Text, Picture, Chart, Table,
Diagram, Media (video or sound), and Clip Art. A placeholder on a slide master or layout master
can specify one of these types of content that it will accept, or you can designate it as a Content
placeholder, such that it will accept any of the seven types. Most of the layouts that PowerPoint
generates automatically for its themes use the Content placeholder type because it offers the
most ﬂexibility. By making all placeholders Content placeholders rather than a speciﬁc type,
PowerPoint can get by with fewer separate layout masters because users will choose the desired
layout based on the positioning of the placeholders, not their types.
A Content placeholder appears as a text placeholder with a small palette of icons in the center,
one for each of the content types. Each content placeholder can hold only one type of content at
a time, so as soon as the user types some text into the content placeholder or clicks one of the
icons in the palette and inserts some content, the placeholder becomes locked into that one type
of content until the content is deleted from it.
Note
If a slide has a placeholder that contains some content (any type), selecting the placeholder and pressing
Delete removes the content. To remove the placeholder itself from the layout, select the empty placeholder
and press Delete. If you then want to restore the placeholder, reapply the slide layout to the slide. ■
You can move and resize a placeholder on a layout master as you would any other object. Drag
a selection handle on the frame to resize it, or drag the border of the frame (not on a selection
handle) to move it.
Cross-Reference
The Content placeholders are shown in Chapter 4 in Figure 4-12. You can also see Chapter 4 for more on
moving and resizing an object. ■
Adding a Custom Placeholder
You can add a custom placeholder to an individual layout master. This makes it easy to build
your own custom layouts.
To add a custom placeholder, follow these steps:
1.
In Slide Master view, select the layout master to affect.
2.
On the Slide Master tab, click the bottom part of the Insert Placeholder button to open its
menu.
3.
Click Content to insert a generic placeholder, or click one of the speciﬁc content types.
See Figure 5-19. The mouse pointer becomes a cross-hair.
141

Part I: Building Your Presentation
FIGURE 5-19
Create a new placeholder on a slide.
4.
Drag on the slide to draw the placeholder box of the size and position desired. A blue box
appears showing where the placeholder box will go. When you release the mouse button,
the new placeholder appears on the slide.
Deleting and Restoring a Custom Placeholder
To delete a custom placeholder, select it and press the Delete key, just as you learned to do ear-
lier with the preset placeholders.
The difference between custom and preset placeholders is not in the deleting, but rather in the
restoring. You can immediately undo a deletion with Ctrl+Z, but you cannot otherwise restore a
deleted custom placeholder from a layout master. PowerPoint retains no memory of the content
placeholders on individual layouts. Therefore, you must recreate any content placeholders that
you have accidentally deleted.
Tip
To restore one of the built-in layouts, copy it from another slide master. See the sections ‘‘Duplicating and
Deleting Layouts,’’ and ‘‘Copying Layouts Between Slide Masters’’ later in this chapter. ■
142

Chapter 5: Working with Layouts, Themes, and Masters
Overriding the Slide Master Formatting for a Layout
You can apply formatting to a layout in almost exactly the same ways as you apply formatting to
a regular slide or to a slide master. Only a few things are off-limits:
 You cannot apply a different theme to individual layouts under a common slide master. To
use a different theme for some slides, you have to create a whole new slide master (covered
later in this chapter).
 You cannot apply a different font, color, or effect theme, because these are related to the
main theme and the slide master. If you need different fonts or colors on a certain layout,
specify ﬁxed font formatting for the text placeholders in that layout, or specify ﬁxed color
choices for objects.
Cross-Reference
For more on slide masters, see the section ‘‘Managing Slide Masters.’’ For more on formatting text place-
holders, see Chapter 6. For more on specifying colors for objects, see Chapter 10. ■
 You cannot delete a background graphic that is inherited from the slide master; if you want
it only on certain layouts, delete it from the slide master, and then paste it individually
onto each layout desired, or select Hide Background Graphics from the Slide Master tab
and then deselect Hide Background Graphics from certain layouts.
 You cannot change the slide orientation (portrait or landscape) or the slide size.
So what can you do to an individual layout, then? Plenty. You can do the following:
 Apply a different background.
 Reposition, resize, or delete preset placeholders inherited from the slide master.
 Apply ﬁxed formatting to text placeholders, including different fonts, sizes, colors,
attributes, indents, and alignment.
 Apply formatting using theme colors and theme fonts
 Apply ﬁxed formatting to any placeholder box, including different ﬁll and border styles
and colors.
 Create manual text boxes and type any text you like into them. You might do this to
include copyright notice on certain slide layouts, for example.
 Insert pictures or clip art that should repeat on each slide that uses a certain layout.
Creating a New Layout
In addition to modifying the existing layouts, you can create your own brand-new layouts, deﬁn-
ing the exact placeholders you want. To create a new layout, follow these steps:
1.
From Slide Master view, click the slide master with which to associate the new layout.
2.
Click Insert Layout. A new layout appears. Each new layout you create starts with preset
placeholders inherited from the slide master for Title, Footer, Date, and Slide Number.
143

Part I: Building Your Presentation
3.
(Optional) Delete any of the preset placeholders that you don’t want.
4.
Insert new placeholders as needed.
5.
(Optional) Name the layout.
Cross-Reference
To insert a placeholder, see the section ‘‘Adding a Custom Placeholder’’ earlier in the chapter. To name the
layout, see the next section ‘‘Renaming a Layout.’’ ■
Note
The new layout is part of the slide master, but not part of the theme. The theme is applied to the slide
master, but at this point their relationship ends; and changes that you make to the slide master do not affect
the existing theme. To save your custom layout(s), you have two choices: You can save the presentation as
a template, or you can save the theme as a separate ﬁle. You learn more about saving themes in ‘‘Managing
Themes’’ later in this chapter. ■
Renaming a Layout
Layout names can help you determine the purpose of a layout if it is not obvious from viewing
its thumbnail image.
To change the name of a layout, or to assign a name to a new layout you’ve created, follow these
steps:
1.
In Slide Master view, right-click the layout and choose Rename Layout. The Rename Lay-
out dialog box opens.
2.
Type a new name for the layout, replacing the existing name.
3.
Click Rename.
Duplicating and Deleting Layouts
You might want to copy a layout to get a head start on creating a new one. To copy a layout,
right-click the layout in Slide Master view and choose Duplicate Layout. A copy of the layout
appears below the original.
If you are never going to use a certain layout, you might as well delete it; every layout you can
delete makes the ﬁle a little bit smaller. To delete a layout, right-click the layout in Slide Master
view and choose Delete Layout.
Caution
You might have a couple of layouts at the bottom of the list that employ vertical text. These are for users
of Asian languages. They show up in the New Slide and Layout galleries on the home tab if you have
certain Asian languages enabled on your system. Don’t delete them if you will sometimes need to create
Asian-language slides. ■
144

Chapter 5: Working with Layouts, Themes, and Masters
Copying Layouts Between Slide Masters
When you create additional slide masters in the presentation, any custom layouts you’ve created
for the existing slide masters do not carry over. You must manually copy them to the new slide
master.
To copy a layout from one slide master to another, follow these steps:
1.
In Slide Master view, select the layout to be copied.
2.
Press Ctrl+C.
3.
Select the slide master under which you want to place the copy.
4.
Press Ctrl+V.
You can also copy layouts between slide masters in different presentations. To do so, open both
presentation ﬁles, and then perform the previous steps. The only difference is that after step 2,
you must switch to the other presentation’s Slide Master view.
Managing Slide Masters
Let’s review the relationship one more time between slide masters and themes. A theme is a
set of formatting specs (colors, fonts, and effects) that can be used in PowerPoint, Word, or
Excel. Themes are not applied directly to slides — they are applied to slide masters, which
govern the formatting of slides. The slide masters exist within the presentation ﬁle itself. You
can change them by applying different themes, but they are essentially ‘‘built in’’ to the presenta-
tion ﬁle.
When you change to a different theme for all of the slides in the presentation, your slide master
changes its appearance. You can tweak that appearance in Slide Master view. As long as all of
the slides in the presentation use the same theme, you need only one slide master. However, if
you apply a different theme to some of your slides, you need another master, because a master
can have only one theme applied to it at a time. PowerPoint automatically creates the additional
master(s) for you, and they are all available for editing in Slide Master view.
If you later reapply a single theme to all of the slides in the presentation, you do not need
multiple masters anymore, so the unused one is automatically deleted. In addition to all this
automatic creation and deletion of slide masters, you can also manually create and delete slide
masters on your own. Any slide masters that you create manually are automatically preserved,
even if they aren’t always in use. You must manually delete them if you don’t want them
anymore.
In the following sections, you learn how to create and delete slide masters manually, and how to
rename them. You also learn how to lock one of the automatically created slide masters so that
PowerPoint does not delete it if it falls out of use.
145

Part I: Building Your Presentation
Creating and Deleting Slide Masters
To create another slide master, click Insert Slide Master on the Slide Master tab. It appears below
the existing slide master(s) in the left pane of Slide Master view. From there, just start customiz-
ing it. You can apply a theme to it, modify its layouts and placeholders, and all the usual things
you can do to a slide master. Another way to create a new slide master is to duplicate an existing
one. To do this, right-click the slide master and choose Duplicate Master.
To delete a slide master, select it in Slide Master view (make sure you select the slide master
itself, not just one of its layouts) and press the Delete key. If any of that slide master’s layouts
were applied to any slides in the presentation, those slides automatically convert to the default
slide master’s equivalent layout. If no exact layout match is found, PowerPoint does its best: It
uses its default Title and Content layout and includes any extra content as orphaned items.
Renaming a Slide Master
Slide master names appear as category headings on the Layout list as you are selecting layouts.
For example, in Figure 5-20, the slide master names are Apex and Check.
FIGURE 5-20
Slide master names form the category titles on the Layout list.
146

Chapter 5: Working with Layouts, Themes, and Masters
To rename a slide master, follow these steps:
1.
In Slide Master view, right-click the slide master and choose Rename Master. The Rename
Master dialog box opens.
2.
Type a new name for the master, replacing the existing name.
3.
Click Rename.
Preserving a Slide Master
Unless you have created the slide master yourself, it is temporary. Slide masters come and go
as needed, as you format slides with various themes. To lock a slide master so that it doesn’t
disappear when no slides are using it, right-click the slide master and choose Preserve Master.
A check mark appears next to Preserve Master on its right-click menu, indicating it is saved. To
un-preserve it, select the command again to toggle the check mark off. See Figure 5-21.
FIGURE 5-21
The Preserve Master command saves a slide master so that PowerPoint cannot automatically
delete it.
Managing Themes
As you learned earlier in the chapter, themes are applied to slide masters to create the back-
ground, color, font, and effect formatting for a presentation. Some themes are built into Pow-
erPoint, and you can also create and save your own themes as separate ﬁles and apply them
to other presentations or even to other Ofﬁce documents, such as in Word and Excel. In this
section you learn how to create new themes, manage theme ﬁles, and apply themes across multi-
ple presentations.

Part I: Building Your Presentation
Creating a New Theme
To create a new theme, ﬁrst format a slide master exactly the way you want, including any cus-
tom layouts, backgrounds, colors, and font themes. Then save the slide master’s formatting as a
new theme by following these steps:
1.
On the Slide Master or the Design tab, click Themes, and click Save Current Theme. The
Save Current Theme dialog box opens.
 The default location shown in the Save Current Theme dialog box under Windows
Vista or Windows 7 is C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates\
Document Themes.
 For Windows XP, it is C:\Documents and Settings\username\Application
Data\Microsoft\Templates\Document Themes.
2.
Type a name for the theme ﬁle in the File Name text box.
3.
Click Save. The new theme is saved to your hard disk.
The new theme is now available from the Themes button’s menu in all presentations you create
while logged in as the same user on the same PC. All of its formatting is available, including any
custom color or font themes it includes. You can use it in other programs too; in Word or Excel,
choose Page Layout ➪Themes in one of those programs.
Renaming a Theme
You can rename a theme ﬁle by renaming the .thmx ﬁle from Windows Explorer, outside of
PowerPoint. You can also rename a theme ﬁle from inside PowerPoint by using any dialog box
that saves or opens ﬁles. For example, to use the Choose Theme or Themed Document dialog
box to rename a theme, follow these steps:
1.
From the Design or Slide Master tab, click Themes, and choose Browse for Themes. The
Choose Theme or Themed Document dialog box opens.
2.
Navigate to the folder containing the theme ﬁle to rename.
 By default, theme ﬁles are stored under Windows Vista or Windows 7 in:
C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates\Document Themes.
 For Windows XP, it is C:\Documents and Settings\username\Application
Data\Microsoft\Templates\Document Themes.
3.
Right-click the theme ﬁle and choose Rename.
4.
Type the new name for the theme and press Enter.
5.
Click Cancel to close the dialog box.
Deleting a Theme
A custom theme ﬁle continues appearing on the Themes gallery indeﬁnitely. If you want to
remove it from there, you must delete it from the Document Themes folder, or move it to some
other location for storage. To delete a theme, follow these steps:
148

Chapter 5: Working with Layouts, Themes, and Masters
1.
From the Design or Slide Master tab, click Themes, and choose Browse for Themes. The
Choose Theme or Themed Document dialog box opens.
2.
Navigate to the folder containing the theme ﬁles:
 In Windows Vista or Windows 7: C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\
Templates\Document Themes.
 In Windows XP: C:\Documents and Settings\username\Application Data\Microsoft\
Templates\Document Themes.
3.
Right-click the theme ﬁle and choose Delete.
4.
At the Delete File conﬁrmation box, click Yes.
5.
Click Cancel to close the dialog box.
Copying a Theme from Another Presentation
A presentation ﬁle ‘‘contains’’ themes, in that the themes are applied to its slide masters. (That’s
how a template contains themes too.) As you learned earlier, you can preserve a slide master
in Slide Master view so that it doesn’t get deleted automatically when there are no slides based
on it; by creating new slide masters, applying themes to them, and then preserving them, you
can create a whole library of themes in a single presentation or template ﬁle. Then to make this
library of themes available in another presentation, you simply base the new presentation on that
existing presentation (or template).
However, if you did not initially base the new presentation on the template or presentation that
contains the theme you want, you can apply the theme from it after the fact. One way to do this
is to copy and paste (or drag and drop) the slide master from one ﬁle’s Slide Master view to the
other’s.
Follow these steps to copy a slide master (and thereby copy its theme) to another presentation:
1.
Open both presentations.
2.
In the presentation that contains the theme, enter Slide Master view (View ➪Slide
Master).
3.
Select the slide master (top slide in the left pane) and press Ctrl+C to copy it.
4.
Switch to the other presentation (View ➪Switch Windows).
5.
Enter Slide Master view (View ➪Slide Master).
6.
Press Ctrl+V to paste the slide master (and its associated theme and layouts).
Summary
In this chapter you learned how themes and slide masters make it easy to apply consistent for-
matting in a presentation, and how layout masters are associated with slide masters and provide
consistent layouts for the slides based on them. You learned how to create, edit, rename, and
delete themes, masters and layouts, and how to copy themes between presentations.
149

Part I: Building Your Presentation
Now that you know how to format entire presentations using themes, you’re ready to start learn-
ing how to make exceptions to the formatting rules that the themes impose. In the next chapter
you will learn how to format text in PowerPoint, and apply different fonts, sizes, attributes, and
special effects. You can use this knowledge to make strategic changes to the text placeholders on
slide masters to further customize your themes, or you can make changes to text on individual
slides on a case-by-case basis to make certain slides stand out from the rest.

T
ext formatting is formatting that you can apply to individual charac-
ters of text. It includes font (typeface), size, attributes such as bold
and underline, ﬁll color, and border color. (Formatting that affects
entire paragraphs only, such as indentation or bullet style, is called paragraph
formatting, not text formatting, and is covered in Chapter 7.)
As you learned in Chapter 5, PowerPoint automates text formatting by apply-
ing themes to slide masters. The slide masters then dictate the default text
size, font, color, and attributes that should be used on slides. By applying
text formatting through the slide masters, rather than to individual slides,
you ensure consistency and make it much easier to make global font changes
later on.
However, you may need to change the formatting of some text. For example,
the font size for titles on the slide master may be a bit too large; in this case,
you can decrease the font size for the Title placeholder, and this change will
apply to all of the layouts for that master. You can even save the changes to
a new theme ﬁle so that you can reuse the theme with the smaller title text
later on.
In some cases, you might need to manually change the text formatting for an
individual text box, or even an individual paragraph or word. For example,
you may create text boxes manually that label the parts of a diagram; in this
case, you would probably want to use a ﬁxed font and size for those labels,
so that they do not change if you switch themes later on.
Changing the Font
There are several ways to change the font that is used in a presentation.
Whenever possible, in order to maintain consistency, you should use the
method that affects an entire slide master. However, in some cases, you may
151

Part I: Building Your Presentation
need to change the font in an individual text box, or even individual characters within the text
box. Ofﬁce 2010 comes with a lot of different fonts, and you may also have acquired some addi-
tional fonts by installing other programs. A font is a typeface, or a style of lettering. To see an
example of two different font styles, compare the lettering of the preceding heading to the letter-
ing in this paragraph.
Note
In the past, when most fonts were not scalable, a distinction was sometimes drawn between the term
‘‘typeface’’ — referring to a certain style of lettering — and the term ‘‘font’’ — which referred to a speciﬁc
typeface used at a certain size, with a certain combination of attributes, such as bold and italic. Nowadays,
however, the terms font and typeface are synonymous for all practical purposes. ■
Windows fonts are generic — that is, they work with any program. For example, a font that
came with a desktop publishing program such as Adobe InDesign also works with Microsoft
Word and with PowerPoint. Within PowerPoint, you have access to all of the installed Windows
fonts on your system.
The majority of the fonts that come with Windows and Ofﬁce are scalable, OpenType or True-
Type fonts. These are outline fonts, which means that they consist of unﬁlled, mathematically
created outlines of each character. When you assign a size, you are sizing the outline; each out-
line is then ﬁlled in with black (or whatever color you choose) to form each character. As a
result, these fonts look good at any size. PowerPoint’s Font list does not differentiate between
OpenType and TrueType fonts, and both are marked with TT icons to their left, as shown in
Figure 6-1. (A few proprietary fonts might show an O icon, for OpenType, instead of TT.)
Depending on the default printer, PowerPoint’s Font list may also contain fonts that have printer
icons to their left. These are printer-resident fonts, and they are built into the default printer that
you have set up in Windows. Figure 6-1 shows one such font, AvantGarde. You should not use
these fonts in a presentation that you plan to show on another computer or distribute to others
electronically, because not everyone will have these fonts available.
In terms of appearance, there are two basic groups of fonts: serif (those with little tails on each
letter, such as the small horizontal lines at the bases of the letters i and t) and sans-serif (those
without the tails). The regular paragraph text in this book uses a serif font. The headings use a
sans-serif font.
Choosing the Right Fonts
A font can make a tremendous difference in the readability and appeal of your presentation, so
selecting the right ones is very important. But how do you choose from among all of the fonts
that are installed on your system? Here are some general rules:
 Strive for consistency. (Yes, I keep harping on that, but it’s important.) You should avoid
changing the font on an individual slide, and instead, make font changes to the slide mas-
ter, or, in some cases, to a master layout.
152

Chapter 6: Formatting Text
FIGURE 6-1
Fonts appear on the Fonts list on the Home tab.
 Whenever possible, rather than choosing a ﬁxed font, use the (Headings) or (Body) place-
holders at the top of the Font menu (see Figure 6-1). You can then redeﬁne those place-
holders using a font theme. This makes it much easier to change the fonts for the entire
presentation later on.
Cross-Reference
For more on font themes, see Chapter 5. ■
 Try to use a sans-serif font for the ‘‘Headings’’ font, because sans-serif is easier to read at
large sizes.
 Use serif fonts for the body if the presentation is very text-heavy, because serif fonts are
easier to read in long paragraphs (such as in this book).
 Avoid serif fonts for tiny text, because the serifs tend to break up onscreen at small sizes.
 Avoid script fonts in presentations, because they are hard to read.
 Avoid novelty fonts, because they take the focus away from your message.
Another consideration when choosing fonts is whether the PC on which you present the show
is likely to have the same fonts installed. If you stick with Windows-supplied fonts such as
153

Part I: Building Your Presentation
Arial and Times New Roman, which are available in Windows XP and newer versions, this is
a non-issue. However, if you use a font that came with Ofﬁce 2007 and 2010 only, such as
Calibri, but you plan to present on a PC that uses Ofﬁce 2003 or earlier, then you might want
to embed the fonts in the presentation when you are saving it. If you present or edit the show
on a PC that does not have the right fonts, and the fonts are not embedded, then PowerPoint
will use fonts that are as close as possible to a match. Although this is helpful, it can also cause
strange and unexpected line breaks in your text.
Tip
When you install the Compatibility Pack in an earlier version of PowerPoint, it not only enables you to open
PowerPoint 2007 and 2010 ﬁles, but it also installs the fonts introduced in PowerPoint 2007/2010, such as
Calibri. ■
Tip
To embed fonts when saving the presentation, choose Tools ➪Save Options in the Save As dialog box.
Select the Embed Fonts in the File check box, and click OK. ■
Tip
If you end up on the other side of that equation and are stuck with a presentation that uses fonts that your
system doesn’t have, use Replace Fonts to replace all instances of the missing font with one that is available
on your PC. See ‘‘Replacing Fonts’’ later in this chapter. ■
Changing the Font Theme
Choosing a different font theme is covered in Chapter 5 because of the connection between
themes and fonts, but let’s have another look at it here in the context of font formatting. A font
theme is a speciﬁcation that names two fonts: one for headings (titles) and one for body text
(everything else). Font themes apply to all text that uses the font placeholders rather than a ﬁxed
font. To switch to a different font theme, follow these steps:
1.
On the Design tab, click Fonts. The Fonts menu opens to display samples of the avail-
able themes. These include both built-in font themes and any custom themes that you’ve
created.
2.
Hover the mouse pointer over a theme to see it previewed on the slide.
3.
Click the font theme that you want.
Cross-Reference
To create your own custom font themes, see Chapter 5. ■
Tip
You apply the font theme to the slide master that the current slide uses. If you have other slides in the
presentation that use different slide masters, the change does not affect them. To apply the change to all
slide masters, instead of clicking the font theme in step 3, right-click it and choose Apply to All Slides from
the menu that appears. ■
154

Chapter 6: Formatting Text
Applying a Fixed Font
If you apply a speciﬁc font to some text, that text will no longer use the font that is speciﬁed
by the font theme. That font will not change when you change the presentation’s overall font
theme.
If this is what you want, then you have two ways to apply a speciﬁc font: from the Home tab or
from the mini toolbar.
To apply a font from the Home tab, follow these steps:
1.
Select the text to be formatted. It can be on a slide master (most preferable), on a layout
master, or on an individual slide.
2.
On the Home tab, in the Font group, open the Font drop-down list (Figure 6-1).
3.
Point to a font other than the ones designated (Headings) and (Body). The selected text is
previewed in that font.
4.
Click the font that you want. PowerPoint applies the font to the text.
If you want to return to using the theme fonts, select the ‘‘Headings’’ or the ‘‘Body’’ font from the
top of the menu.
The mini toolbar is just what it sounds like — a small toolbar. It appears above and to the right
of selected text. When the mouse pointer is directly on top of the selected text, the mini toolbar
appears dimmed, but if you move your mouse up to the mini toolbar, it becomes fully visible.
To apply a font from the mini toolbar, follow these steps:
1.
Select the text to be formatted. It can be on a slide master (most preferable), on a layout
master, or on an individual slide.
2.
Hover the mouse pointer over the selection so that the mini toolbar appears, as shown in
Figure 6-2. If it does not appear, right-click the selection.
3.
On the mini toolbar, open the Font drop-down list.
4.
Point to a font other than the ones marked (Headings) or (Body). The selected text is pre-
viewed in that font.
5.
Click the font that you want. PowerPoint applies the font to the text.
FIGURE 6-2
Use the mini toolbar to apply a font.
155

Part I: Building Your Presentation
Using the Font Dialog Box
The Font dialog box (shown in Figure 6-3) provides a third way of changing the font. It also
gives you access to the controls for setting font size, color, and attributes, all of which you will
learn about later in this chapter.
To open the Font dialog box, click the dialog launcher in the Font group on the Home tab.
Then make your selections in the dialog box, just as you would from the Home tab’s Font group.
Notice in Figure 6-3 that the Font drop-down list is labeled Latin Text Font. In this case, ‘‘Latin’’
just means regular text characters.
FIGURE 6-3
The Font dialog box provides access to many different text-formatting controls, as well as the
font list.
Replacing Fonts
If you restrain yourself from using a lot of manual text formatting, and rely on the theme to han-
dle it, you should not have a problem with inconsistent font usage. Whenever you need to make
a change, you can do it once on the slide master and be done with it.
However, not everyone can be counted on to show such discipline and good design sense as you.
Suppose your coworker created a long presentation in which he sporadically applied a certain
font for some special elements. Now you need to work on that presentation, but you don’t have
that font. You will need to go through and hunt for all instances of that font and change them to
some other font. Fortunately, PowerPoint has a Replace Fonts feature that can help you to ﬁnd
all of these instances. Follow these steps:
1.
On the Home tab, click the down arrow for the Replace button and choose Replace Fonts.
The Replace Font dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 6-4.
2.
In the Replace drop-down list, select the font that you want to replace. Only the fonts that
are currently in use in the presentation appear on this list, and so it’s easy to navigate.
156

Chapter 6: Formatting Text
FIGURE 6-4
Replace all instances of one font with another.
3.
In the With drop-down list, select the desired replacement font. All of the available fonts
on your system appear here.
4.
Click Replace. All of the instances of that font are replaced.
5.
Repeat steps 2 to 4 to replace another font, or click Close when you’re ﬁnished.
Caution
Replacing the theme fonts makes the placeholders no longer respond to font theme changes. You have to
reset the slide master by reapplying a theme font there if you ‘‘un-theme’’ them using Replace Fonts. ■
Changing the Font Size
Each theme has a speciﬁed font size that it uses for titles and for body text, with different sizes
typically used for different levels of bulleted lists. You can use the default settings, or you can
edit the placeholders on the slide master to change them. In some cases, you might also need to
change the size of an individual block of text on an individual slide.
Note
As you learned at the end of Chapter 4, PowerPoint has an AutoFit feature that you can turn on or off for
each text box. When enabled, AutoFit permits the text size to shrink so that the text ﬁts into the text box,
or it permits the text box to grow so that the text ﬁts at its current size. However, AutoFit does not change
the text’s font size as applied by the Font Size setting; if you enlarge the text box, the text goes back to its
regular size. ■
Choosing the Right Sizes
The size of the text is just as important as the font. If the text is too large, it looks unattrac-
tive and amateurish, but if it’s too small, the people in the back row won’t be able to follow
along.
Font size is measured in points, and each point measures 1/72 of an inch when printed. How-
ever, PowerPoint slides are usually shown on a screen rather than in print, and so the appropri-
ate font size depends mainly upon the presentation medium. For example, a 72-point letter on a
15-inch monitor is very different than a 72-point letter on a 12-foot projection screen.
157

Part I: Building Your Presentation
The default sizes that are speciﬁed in the built-in themes provide you with a good starting point.
You can increase or decrease the sizes on the slide masters as necessary. Here are some things to
consider when choosing font size:
 The farther away the audience will be sitting from the slides, and the smaller the display
screen, the larger the text should be.
 Very thick and very thin letters are harder to read at small sizes. A font of moderate thick-
ness is most readable.
 Very tight spacing can make thick letters difﬁcult to read; on the other hand, very loose
spacing can emphasize the individual letters to the point where the words they comprise
are not as obvious. See the section ‘‘Adjusting Character Spacing’’ later in this chapter.
 If any of your slide titles are so long that they wrap to an additional line within the title
placeholder box, consider slightly decreasing the font size for the title placeholder on
the slide master so that the wrapping doesn’t occur. Make your changes to the slide
master — not the individual slide on which the problem occurs. This is because audiences
ﬁnd it jarring when the slide title is not in the same place or not the same size on every
slide.
Specifying a Font Size
The Font Size drop-down list, shown in Figure 6-5, is on the Home tab and is actually also
an input box. You can click it and type a font size directly into the text box, or you can open
the drop-down list and select a value. Typing your own value is useful if the size that you want
doesn’t appear on the list. At the smaller sizes, the list increments by one point, but at the larger
sizes, it makes bigger jumps, and so not all values are available.
Note
The same Font Size drop-down list is also available in the mini toolbar and in the Font dialog box. ■
As a shortcut, you can also use the Increase Font and Decrease Font buttons, which are available
both on the Home Ribbon and on the mini toolbar. They are shown in Figure 6-5, and they
increase or decrease the font size by one position on the Font Size list. (As noted earlier, for the
smaller sizes, the increment occurs at one point at a time, but for larger sizes there is more of a
jump between sizes.) You can also use the following keyboard shortcuts:
 Increase Font: Ctrl+Shift+>
 Decrease Font: Ctrl+Shift+<
Adjusting Character Spacing
Character spacing is the amount of blank space between individual letters. You can adjust this
spacing to make more or less text ﬁll a text box. Character spacing can affect the appearance and
readability of both titles and body text, and Figure 6-6 shows examples of the various character
spacing presets that are available with examples of how it affects your text.

To adjust character spacing, select the text and then choose a setting from the Character Spacing

To set custom spacing, choose More Spacing from the drop-down menu. This opens the Font
dialog box to the Character Spacing tab, as shown in Figure 6-7.
FIGURE 6-7
Adjust character spacing and kerning using custom settings in the Font dialog box.
To set custom spacing, choose either Expanded or Condensed from the Spacing list, and
then enter a number of points by which to expand or condense. As a point of reference,
Table 6-1 lists the presets from Figure 6-6 and their expand/condense values; use these as a
basis for ﬁne-tuning.

You can also adjust kerning in the Font dialog box. Kerning decreases the amount of space
between two letters, based upon their shapes. For example, when capital letters A and V appear
160

Chapter 6: Formatting Text
next to each other, you can reduce the space between them without them overlapping because
of their shapes. Kerning takes the shapes of the letters into account as it selectively tightens the
spacing. Kerning looks best when you apply it to large text, and so the Kerning for Fonts setting
enables you to specify a minimum font size, as shown in Figure 6-7, below which text is not
kerned.
Changing Font Color/Text Fill
To set the font color for individually selected text, use the Font Color button on the Home tab,
or use the Text Fill button on the Drawing Tools Format tab in the WordArt Styles group. Why
are there two buttons that do the same thing? Well, they don’t do exactly the same thing. The
Font Color button on the Home tab applies only simple, solid-color formatting, and is available
even in legacy presentations. The Text Fill button has a wider array of ﬁll options, including
gradients, textures, and even picture ﬁlls. It is available only in a PowerPoint 2007 or 2010 pre-
sentation. Figure 6-8 shows these two buttons and their menus.
FIGURE 6-8
The Font Color button (left) and the Text Fill button (right) can both apply solid-color formatting,
but only the Text Fill button can apply special ﬁll effects.
For text color and ﬁll, as with the colors of all objects, it is usually best to stick with the theme
color placeholders rather than using ﬁxed colors. This way, if you want to change the color
theme or the overall theme later on, the colors will automatically update. This doesn’t necessarily
mean that you have to forego special ﬁll effects; you just have to base them on theme colors. For
example, if you’re creating a gradient effect, you should use two theme colors for the gradient.
Cross-Reference

161

Part I: Building Your Presentation
Applying a Text Outline
PowerPoint 2010 can apply graphics-like formatting to any text. For example, you can apply
outlines to text, just as you can apply borders to drawn shapes, text boxes, or other objects. In
PowerPoint 2003 and earlier, this was possible only with WordArt text (that is, text treated as an
internal graphic) and not as regular text. Figure 6-9 shows some text with an outline.
FIGURE 6-9
You can now apply borders to regular text.
By default, text has no outline. To apply an outline, select the text and then choose a color from
the Text Outline button in the WordArt Styles group on the Drawing Tools Format tab. You can
choose either a theme color or a standard (ﬁxed) color. You can also choose an outline weight
from the Weight submenu, as shown in Figure 6-10. Chapter 10 covers object outlines (borders)
in more detail.
FIGURE 6-10
You can apply a text outline color, as well as a different line thickness, or weight.
162

Chapter 6: Formatting Text
Note
You can also apply dashes to the text outline, although this is usually not a good idea for text. Dashes are
more suitable for the borders of larger objects. ■
Applying Text Attributes
Text attributes are modiﬁers that you apply to the text, such as bold, italics, underline,
strikethrough, shadow, and so on. PowerPoint offers several attributes, as shown in
Figure 6-11.
FIGURE 6-11
Text attributes that are available in PowerPoint 2010.
There are actually several types of text attributes, and they can be divided into the following
major groups:
 Bold and italic are actually considered font styles. You can apply one of these four styles to
your text: Regular, Bold, Italic, or Bold Italic. In some fonts, each of these styles is formed
with a separate character set that is embedded in the font ﬁle, and the letters are actually
different shapes. However, in other fonts, bold is simulated by making each character a
little thicker, and italics is simulated by tilting each character to the right. Figure 6-12
shows the difference between these font types.
 Some attributes apply an effect on top of — or in addition to — the text. These include
underlining, strikethrough, and double strikethrough.
 Superscript and Subscript attributes are used for setting off symbols and numbers for foot-
notes, chemical notations, exponents, and so on. They raise or lower the affected text and
also shrink it by about 30 percent (this is the default setting, although you can also cus-
tomize the percentage).
 Shadow formatting takes two forms. If you apply it with the button in the Font group, then
it is available in all presentations, even legacy ones, and it simply places a slightly offset
gray copy behind the characters. You can also apply shadow formatting from the WordArt
Styles group to create different types of shadows.
163

Bold characters are thicker in
some spots but not in others

but shaped the same

versions of regular characters
 All Caps formatting appears to change lowercase letters to their uppercase equivalents.
However, they are not really uppercase; they’re just formatted this way. Removing the All
Caps attribute returns the text to its normal appearance.
 Small Caps formatting is similar to All Caps except that letters that are normally lowercase
appear slightly smaller than letters that were already uppercase to begin with.
Note
Small Caps formatting was not available in versions of PowerPoint prior to 2007, and if you save the
presentation in PowerPoint 97-2003 format and open it in an earlier version, the Small Caps attribute is
removed. ■
 Equalize character height formatting forces each letter to be the full height that is allotted
for capital letters. This distorts the letters and is most useful when working with shaped
WordArt text (which is covered later in this chapter).
As shown in Figure 6-13, the ﬁve most popular text attributes appear as toggle buttons in the
Font group on the Home tab. They are Bold, Italic, Underline, Shadow, and Strikethrough.
The other attributes are available in the Font dialog box. You can access them by following these
steps:
1.
On the Home tab, click the dialog box launcher in the Font group. The Font dialog box
opens, as shown in Figure 6-14.
2.
In the Font Style drop-down list, choose the combination of bold and italic that you want:

Changing Text Case
Each character has a numeric value stored in the presentation ﬁle, and uppercase character num-
bers are completely different from their lowercase counterparts. For example, a capital B is not
just formatted differently from a lowercase b — it is a different character.
As you learned in the preceding section, you can apply the All Caps attribute to some text to
force it to appear in all uppercase format, but this is just an illusion. The identifying numbers for
the characters have not changed; they’re just wearing a mask. When you remove the attribute,
the characters go back to the way they normally look.
If you want to really change the case of some text, including changing the numeric identiﬁers
for the characters behind the scenes, then you must either retype the text or use the Change
Case feature. You can access the Change Case attribute in the Font group on the Home tab, as
shown in Figure 6-15. Change Case enables you to set a block of text to any of the following
settings:
 Sentence case: Capitalizes the ﬁrst letter of the ﬁrst word in the sentence, and the ﬁrst
letter of the ﬁrst word after a sentence-ending punctuation mark such as a period.
 Lowercase: Converts all characters to lowercase that are not already so. (It does not do
anything to numbers or symbols.)
 Uppercase: Converts all characters to uppercase that are not already so. (It does not do
anything to numbers or symbols.)
 Capitalize each word: Capitalizes the ﬁrst letter of each word.
 Toggle case: Reverses the case of every letter. For example, it would change ‘‘Smith’’ to
‘‘sMITH.’’
FIGURE 6-15
Change the case of the selected text by selecting a Change Case option from the menu.
When you use the Change Case attribute, the text retains no memory of its previous capitaliza-
tion state. For example, if you used the Capitalize Each Word option on the word ‘‘PowerPoint,’’
it would convert to ‘‘Powerpoint.’’ If you wanted to re-capitalize the middle P, then you would
have to manually retype it (or select only that P and choose Change Case ➪Uppercase).
166

Chapter 6: Formatting Text
Tip
Most style guides dictate that you should capitalize all important words in titles, but not every word. For
example, in the title ‘‘The Best of the Best,’’ you do not capitalize the words ‘‘of’’ and ‘‘the.’’ Unfortunately,
the Capitalize Each Word option in PowerPoint cannot make that distinction for you, and so you must make
those changes manually. However, Microsoft Word’s grammar checker does identify and ﬁx these capital-
ization errors. If you have a long, text-heavy presentation, you might ﬁnd it worthwhile to export the text
to Word, perform a grammar check, and then re-import it. ■
Applying WordArt Styles
WordArt enables you to apply formatting features to text that would normally be used only with
graphics, such as special ﬁlls, outlines, glows, reﬂections, and other special effects. It’s pretty
amazing stuff, as you’ll see in the following sections.
Up until PowerPoint 2007, WordArt had always been a rather compartmentalized specialty fea-
ture. However, in PowerPoint 2007 and 2010, you can apply WordArt Styles to all text. There
is no distinction between WordArt and regular text, and so you do not have to choose between
cool special effects and including text in the outline and spell checks.
A WordArt Style is a preset combination of ﬁll color, outline color, and text effects. WordArt
Styles are built into PowerPoint — you can’t customize them or add to them. However, you can
apply one and then make changes to it.
Cross-Reference
For more on text effects, see the section ‘‘Applying Text Effects.’’ ■
To apply a WordArt Style, follow these steps:
1.
(Optional) To make the style apply to certain text, select that text.
2.
On the Drawing Tools Format tab, in the WordArt Styles group, open the WordArt Styles
gallery. Notice in Figure 6-16 that there are two categories of styles. Some apply only to
selected text, and others apply to the entire text box (object).
3.
Hover the mouse pointer over the styles to preview them on the text on the slide.
4.
Click the desired style to apply it. To remove a previous WordArt effect, click Clear
WordArt.
If you choose a WordArt style that is supposed to apply only to the selected text, but you have
not selected any text, then PowerPoint applies it to the word at the insertion point’s location.
The insertion point can be at the beginning of the word or anywhere within it, but not following
the word. If the insertion point follows a word, PowerPoint tries to apply the style to text that
is to the right of the word. If this is a blank space, the style applies to the blank space and the
change is not apparent.
167

Part I: Building Your Presentation
FIGURE 6-16
Select a WordArt Style.
Caution
When you save a presentation in PowerPoint 97-2003 format, any text box that contains text with WordArt
formatting applied is converted to a graphic that you cannot edit. If you need to edit the text in PowerPoint
2003 or earlier, make sure that you remove the WordArt effects before saving in that format. ■
Applying Text Effects
The text effects that you apply using the Text Effects button in the WordArt Styles
group — Shadow, Reﬂection, Glow, Bevel, 3-D Rotation, and Transform — are similar to
regular attributes such as bold, italic, and underline, in that they apply modiﬁers to the basic
text to produce some special appearance. However, this chapter looks at these effects separately
because they are part of the WordArt functionality in Ofﬁce 2007 and 2010, and apply only to
text in PowerPoint 2007/2010 format presentations.
Note
When working with text for backward-compatible presentations, stick with the effects that you can access
from the Font group. ■
All of these effects, except for Transform, are also available for formatting graphics objects such
as drawn shapes, SmartArt, and charts.
Cross-Reference
To customize and ﬁne-tune each of these effects, see Chapter 10. ■
168

Chapter 6: Formatting Text
Shadow
There are two ways to apply a shadow — one is available in all cases and the other is
available only with PowerPoint 2007/2010 presentations. The Shadow button on the Home
tab (in the Font group) applies a default shadow to any text, and you can use it even in a
backward-compatible presentation. Its shadow appears slightly below and to the right of the
text, and the shadow color is automatically based on the background color.
For more ﬂexibility, click the Text Effects button in the WordArt Styles group on the Drawing
Tools Format tab and then select Shadow to open a gallery of shadow presets. These presets are
divided into categories, including Outer (the default type), Inner, and Perspective, as shown in
Figure 6-17. You can scroll down in the gallery to access more presets.
FIGURE 6-17
Select a shadow preset.
You can also customize the shadow by choosing Shadow Options, which opens the Format Text
Effects dialog box. You can then ﬁne-tune the shadow by changing its color, transparency, size,
and so on.

Chapter 10 looks at each of the shadow settings in detail. ■
Caution
The WordArt gallery and its effects are not available when working in Compatibility mode (that is, on a
PowerPoint 97-2003 format presentation). ■
Reﬂection
Reﬂection creates a partial mirror image of the text beneath the original, making it appear as if it
were looking into a reﬂecting pool. Figure 6-18 illustrates the effect.
FIGURE 6-18
Select a reﬂection preset to apply a Reﬂection effect to text.
Choose a reﬂection preset from the Reﬂection submenu of the Text Effects menu, as shown in
Figure 6-18.
To remove the reﬂection effect, choose No Reﬂection from the top of the gallery menu.
You can also choose Reﬂection Options to open the Format Text Effects dialog box, from which
you can ﬁne-tune any of the following (see Figure 6-19):
 Transparency: The extent to which anything behind the text shows through the
reﬂection
170

Chapter 6: Formatting Text
 Size: The size of the reﬂection
 Distance: The distance between the reﬂection and the text or object being reﬂected
 Blur: The sharpness or blurriness of the reﬂection effect
FIGURE 6-19
Fine-tune a reﬂection effect in the Format Text Effects dialog box.
Glow
Glow appears as a soft halo effect around the text. You can choose from four levels of thickness
for the glow, as well as any glow color. Figure 6-20 shows a glow effect.
You can choose a glow preset from the Glow submenu of the Text Effects menu. You must ﬁrst
select the level that you want by clicking one of the presets in the gallery, as shown in Figure 6-
20. Then, if you cannot ﬁnd the desired color, you can reopen the submenu and choose More
Glow Colors. You can then click the color that you want from the color picker. To remove the
glow, choose No Glow from the top of the gallery menu.
You can also choose Glow Options to open the Format Text Effects dialog box, from which you
can specify the following (see Figure 6-21):
 Presets: Choosing a preset from this list is the same as choosing one from the Glow sub-
menu in Figure 6-20.
 Color: Sets the color of the glow.
171

Part I: Building Your Presentation
 Size: Sets the size of the glow around the text or object.
 Transparency: Determines the extent to which whatever is behind the glow shows
through.
FIGURE 6-20
You can select a glow preset, as well as a different color.
The Soft Edges effect applies only to shapes, not to text, so those options are grayed out (unavail-
able) in the dialog box in Figure 6-21.
172

Chapter 6: Formatting Text
FIGURE 6-21
Fine-tune the glow in the Format Text Effects dialog box.
Bevel (3-D format)
A bevel is a slanting, curving, or rounding off of the edges of an object. It is not a very obvi-
ous effect when applied to most text, and so it’s mostly for larger, drawn objects and pieces of
charts and diagrams. However, on large, thick letters in light colors, beveling is sometimes use-
ful to create a raised or textured effect. For example, in Figure 6-22, a bevel effect adds a raised
appearance to the letters.
Note
Bevel effects are not easily visible at the default zoom in Normal view. To really see the bevel effect, zoom
in on the letters to at least 300 percent. Bevels work well with light or bright-colored text; they are not
usually visible with black text. ■
Choose a bevel preset from the Bevel submenu of the Text Effects menu, as shown in
Figure 6-22.
173

Part I: Building Your Presentation
FIGURE 6-22
You can select a bevel preset and add depth or texture to text.
Beveling is a subset of a larger category of formatting known as 3-D. With 3-D, you can apply
not only bevels to the edges, but also depth, contours, and surface effects. The 3-D effects are
not as effective with text as with other types of objects because text is relatively small and thin,
and the effects are not readily visible.
Cross-Reference
For more on depth, contours, and surface effects, see Chapter 10. ■
To ﬁne-tune the bevel effect, select 3-D Options from the bottom of the Bevel submenu. The
Format Text Effects dialog box opens with the 3-D Format settings displayed, as shown in
Figure 6-23. From here you can adjust the width and height of the top and bottom bevel effect
(in points), and you can also experiment with the colors and sizes of the depth and contour
settings, as well as the 3-D lighting and surface effects.
174

Chapter 6: Formatting Text
FIGURE 6-23
Fine-tune the bevel settings in the Format Text Effects dialog box.
Tip
The Contour section governs the outline that appears around the text when you apply beveling. If you do
not want the beveled text to have an outline, set the Size to 0 points in the Contour section, as shown in
Figure 6-23. ■
The Depth setting in the Format Text Effects dialog box controls the length of the 3-D effect
that is applied to the text. It doesn’t do anything until you apply a Rotation setting, which is
covered in the next section. However, when you rotate the text, it shows ‘‘sides’’ according to its
depth setting. For example, in Figure 6-24, the text has a ﬁve-degree X rotation and a depth of
60 points.
FIGURE 6-24
The Depth setting sets the length of the sides of the text. These sides are visible only when you
apply a rotation to the text.
175

Part I: Building Your Presentation
3-D Rotation
The 3-D Rotation effect slants, tilts, or otherwise manipulates the text so that it looks as if it is
being viewed at an angle. Earlier versions of PowerPoint had a very basic 3-D effect that kept
the faces of the characters forward but added some perspective slant to the ‘‘sides’’ of the text.
However, in PowerPoint 2007 and 2010, you can actually slant and tilt the letters themselves, as
shown in Figure 6-25.
There are four factors that make up a 3-D rotation setting:
 X: Left-to-right rotation
 Y: Top-to-bottom rotation
 Z: Rotation around a center point
 Perspective: The height at which you are viewing (above or below)
FIGURE 6-25
The 3-D rotation effect makes text appear to tilt, slant, and rotate.
The 3-D rotation presets combine these factors to create commonly used effects. Select a rotation
preset from the 3-D Rotation submenu of the Text Effects menu, as shown in Figure 6-26.
To adjust each of the four factors separately, choose 3-D Rotation Options from the bottom of
the submenu and set the angles for each factor in the Format Text Effects dialog box. By com-
bining them with the 3-D Format settings in that same dialog box, you can create almost any
effect that you want.
Cross-Reference
For more on the various rotation settings, see Chapter 10. ■
176

Chapter 6: Formatting Text
FIGURE 6-26
Choose a 3-D rotation preset.
Transform
Transform settings are just for text and are not available for graphic objects such as drawn
shapes. You can think of transformations — which were called WordArt Shapes in some earlier
versions of PowerPoint — as ‘‘molds’’ into which you squeeze text in order to change its shape.
Figure 6-27 shows some examples of various transformations that are not rotated. However, you
can combine a transformation with 3-D rotation to create some even more unusual effects.
Applying a Transformation
There are two categories of transformation: Follow Path and Warp. Follow Path is the ‘‘tradi-
tional’’ type of WordArt transformation, squeezing the text into various shapes. Follow Path
does not reshape the text itself, but makes the characters hug a curved path. The bottom-right
example in Figure 6-27 is a Follow Path effect; the others are Warp effects.
177

Part I: Building Your Presentation
FIGURE 6-27
Some examples of transformation effects.
To apply a transformation effect, select it from the Transform submenu of the Text Effects menu,
as shown in Figure 6-28. To remove a transformation effect, choose No Transform.
Modifying a Transformation
After applying a transformation, you might be able to modify its shape somewhat, depending
on the transformation that you have chosen. Once you select the Transform setting, look for a
purple diamond in the WordArt text. Figure 6-29 shows an example. You can drag this diamond
to reshape the effect, making it more or less dramatic. You can drag the purple diamond in the
center of the WordArt to stretch or compress the center. Lines appear as you drag to show the
new position.
Note
You can also rotate the WordArt by dragging the green circle at the top. This works just like rotating any
other object and is covered in Chapter 10. ■
Tips for Using the Follow Path Transformations
The Follow Path transformations are a bit different from the Warp transformations, and so it
might not be obvious how to manipulate them. Here are some tips:
 If the text seems to follow the path in a lopsided manner (especially common with short
text phrases), set the text’s horizontal alignment to Center. To do this, use the Center but-
ton in the Paragraph group on the Home tab.
178

Cross-Reference
For more on text alignment, see Chapter 7. ■
 The third Follow Path transformation (Circle) makes text appear in a circle. Where it starts
depends on the horizontal alignment setting for the text. You can set horizontal align-
ment using the buttons in the Paragraph group on the Home tab. If you set the text to be
left-aligned, it starts at the left; if you center the text, the text bends around the right side
as a center point. If you use right alignment, the text starts upside-down.
 The fourth Follow Path transformation (Button) makes text appear above a center line, on
a center line, and then below a center line. To indicate what text should appear where,
press Enter to insert paragraph breaks between the text segments.
Copying Formatting with Format Painter
Once you have formatted text exactly the way you want it, you might want to copy it to other
blocks of text. To do this, you can use the Format Painter tool. Format Painter picks up the for-
matting of any object (including text) and ‘‘paints’’ it onto other objects.
To use Format Painter, follow these steps:
1.
Select the text or other object whose formatting you want to copy.
2.
On the Home tab, click the Format Painter icon in the Clipboard group, as shown in
Figure 6-30. The mouse pointer changes to a paintbrush. If you want to copy the for-
matting onto more than one object or section of text, double-click the Format Painter icon
instead of just clicking it.
FIGURE 6-30

Inserting Symbols
Occasionally you might need to insert a character that doesn’t appear on your keyboard, such as
a copyright © or ™symbol, or a letter with an accent mark over it. You can easily insert these
symbols by using the Symbol dialog box.
Follow these steps to insert a symbol:
1.
Choose Insert ➪Symbol. The Symbol dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 6-31.

Inserting Math Equations
Math has its own language, complete with special symbols and syntax, and even special types
of line breaks, dividers, and superscript/subscript requirements. It’s no wonder, then, that most
text-editing programs are inadequate for expressing complex mathematical equations.
PowerPoint 2010 includes the same robust Equation Editor utility that is in Microsoft Word;
you can use it to construct and format any equation you need. This makes PowerPoint useful for
math classes, for example, and for scientiﬁc and technical presentations.
Inserting a Preset Equation
In algebra and trigonometry, certain equations are used frequently, such as the Pythagorean
Theorem and the quadratic formula. Instead of re-creating them each time you need them, you
can insert them as a preset equation from Word.
Follow these steps to insert an equation preset:
1.
Click in a text box.
2.
On the Insert tab, open the Equation button’s drop-down list.
3.
Click one of the presets.
Creating a New Equation
If none of the presets match your needs, create a new, blank equation object instead by clicking
the Equation button (click its face, not its down arrow). The Equation Tools Design tab appears,
and type equation here appears in the text box, showing where to begin typing your equation. See
Figure 6-32.
To create a simple equation, just start typing it in the equation frame. You can use any number,
letter, or symbol from the keyboard. You can also select from a wide variety of math symbols in
the Symbols group on the Equation Tools Design tab.
Basic math symbols are shown by default in the Symbols group’s gallery, as shown in
Figure 6-32. Open the gallery and choose a different set of symbols if necessary, as shown
in Figure 6-33.
Depending on the equation, you may need one or more structures. Structures are symbols and/or
combinations of text placeholder boxes that help you create math expressions that could not be
easily expressed on a single line of text.
A stacked fraction is one of the simplest and most common examples. It consists of two place-
holder boxes, one on top of the other, with a horizontal line between them (see Figure 6-34).

open its menu.
3.
Click on the desired structure to insert it.
4.
Click in a placeholder and type or insert the content. Repeat this for each placeholder.
Tip
Structures can be nested. You can place one structure inside the placeholder box for another structure,
creating complex nests of structures and equations. ■
Follow these steps to insert a simple subscript box into an equation:
1.
In the equation, position the insertion point where you want the structure to be inserted.
2.
On the Equation Tools Design tab, click Script.
3.
In the Subscripts and Superscripts section of the menu, click Subscript. Two placeholder
boxes appear: one regular-sized and one smaller and slightly lowered.
4.
Click in the ﬁrst placeholder box and type or insert the content that should precede the
characters in subscript.
5.
Click in the second placeholder box and type or insert the content that should appear in
subscript.
All the other structures work exactly the same way, although some of them might appear intimi-
dating and complex. Just click in the placeholders and ﬁll in the content.
Switching Between Professional and Linear Layout
The default type of equation layout is Professional, which shows structures spread out on mul-
tiple lines wherever appropriate. Professional layout makes math formulas that are easy to read
and understand.
However, when space is an issue on a slide, you might be unwilling to give up two or more lines
in order to show an equation. To save space, it’s helpful to switch the equation’s view to Linear.
Using a Linear view runs the equation on a single line, changing the symbols where needed to
alternatives that can be expressed in a linear fashion (see Figure 6-35).
To switch between Linear and Professional views, use the corresponding buttons in the Tools
group on the Equation Tools Design tab.
184

Chapter 6: Formatting Text
FIGURE 6-35
Comparison of Professional (top) and Linear (bottom) views
Formatting an Equation
There are some differences in the formatting capabilities for equations versus regular text. Here’s
a quick summary:
 Font: Cambria Math is used for formulas by default. While you can change this (right-click
the equation and choose Font, or select the font from the Home tab), font changes will not
take effect unless the font you choose supports mathematical symbols. Because Cambria
Math is the only font that ships with Ofﬁce 2010 that fully supports all math symbols used
in the Equation Editor, it is in effect your only choice.
 Size: By default, the baseline font for an equation is 18 point. Some characters can be
larger or smaller than that depending on their context. You can select the equation’s frame
and then choose a different font size from the Home tab to adjust the overall size of the
equation up or down proportionally from there.
 Color: Use the Font Color button on the Home tab to change the color of the text used for
the equation if desired. Keep in mind, however, that equations are nearly always utilitarian
objects, not decorative.
 Bold: You can apply boldface to individual characters or to the entire equation.
 Strikethrough: You can apply strikethrough to individual characters or to the entire
equation.
 Italics: Letters in an equation are italicized by default, as are some symbols. It is usually
best to leave these at their default, because people expect to see those items italicized, and
the italics help them make sense of the equation.
 Underline: Underline cannot be applied to individual characters; it can be applied only to
the equation as a whole.
Summary
In this chapter, you learned many techniques for formatting text. You learned how to apply dif-
ferent fonts, sizes, colors, and attributes, and how to bend and shape text with 3-D effects and
WordArt transformations. In the next chapter, you’ll continue to look at text formatting, focusing
on paragraph-wide effects such as bulleted and numbered lists, indentation, and alignment.

I
n the previous chapter you learned how to format text by applying
fonts, sizes, colors, attributes, and WordArt special effects. Now that
your text is looking its best, you can expand the focus to the next level:
paragraphs.
What can you do to an entire paragraph, as opposed to an individual text
character? Plenty. For example, you can deﬁne multiple levels of bulleted
and numbered lists, and you can adjust the tab stops, indentations, line
spacing, and horizontal alignment for each paragraph.
All of these things happen within the context of text boxes, of course,
because PowerPoint places all text in text boxes. So this chapter also takes a
look at text box formatting, including ﬁlls, borders, vertical alignment, and
rotation.
Formatting Bulleted Lists
For better or for worse, most PowerPoint presentations contain a lot of
bulleted lists. In previous chapters, you’ve seen how easy it is to create a
bulleted list in PowerPoint. When you create a slide based on a layout that
includes a bullet list, or when you type a new slide in the outline pane, you
get bullets automatically.
Cross-Reference
See Chapter 2 for an analysis of why bulleted lists are sometimes not the best
way to present information, and see Lab 1 at the end of the book to learn
about alternatives. ■
187

Part I: Building Your Presentation
Caution
If you apply text formatting such as bold to a paragraph, the bullet character will also be affected. To avoid
this, leave a blank space after the ﬁnal character in the paragraph and then make sure you select only the
text, not the entire paragraph, before applying text effects. ■
Bullets and the Slide Master
You can apply the bulleted list changes that you learn about in the following sections to individ-
ual paragraphs, but your best bet is to apply them to the slide master, or at least to individual
layout masters. That way, you ensure consistency throughout the presentation. On the slide mas-
ter, ﬁve levels of bullets are deﬁned, as shown in Figure 7-1. (You can add additional levels by
pressing Enter and then Tab after the last level.) You can customize any of these levels individu-
ally. Here’s a high-level overview of the process:
1.
On the View tab, click Slide Master.
2.
Click the top slide in the left pane, selecting the slide master itself (not one of its subordi-
nate layouts).
3.
Click on the slide, in the ‘‘Click to edit Master text styles’’ line.
4.
Customize the bullet character, as in the following sections.
5.
Click in the ‘‘Second level’’ line, and customize it.
6.
Repeat the preceding steps for other levels that you want to customize. (If you do not plan
to use all nine levels, you do not need to make changes to them.)
7.
On the Slide Master tab, click Close.
FIGURE 7-1
To ensure consistency, make bullet format changes on the slide master.

Chapter 7: Formatting Paragraphs and Text Boxes
Using Bullet Presets
You can turn off the bullets for any paragraph(s) or text placeholder by selecting them and click-
ing the Bullets button on the Home tab to toggle the bullet(s) off. In that same way, you can
apply bullets to paragraphs or text placeholders that don’t currently have them.
The default bullet character depends on the theme but is usually one of the presets on the Bul-
lets button’s menu, as shown in Figure 7-2. To switch among the presets, select the paragraph(s)
to affect, open the button’s menu, and click a different preset. The menu also has a None com-
mand, an alternative for toggling bullets off.
Caution
When you turn the bullet character off in PowerPoint, the indentation of the paragraph does not change, so
you’re left with a ﬁrst line that hangs out to the left of any other lines in a multiline paragraph. To ﬁx this,
see the section ‘‘Setting Tabs and Indents’’ later in this chapter. ■
Each of the seven presets in the Bullets button’s menu is a placeholder. By default, each place-
holder is populated with a certain symbol, but you can modify any or all of the placeholders
to be different sizes or colors, and you can even replace the characters with your own choices
of symbols or graphics. In the following sections you learn how to select your own bullet
characters.
Changing Bullet Size and Color
Each of the bullet presets (see Figure 7-2) is actually a character from a symbol font. It is
text — and as such, you can format it like text. You can increase or decrease its size, and you
can change its color. To change a bullet’s size and color, follow these steps:
1.
Select the paragraph(s) to affect. For best results, make the change on the slide master to
ensure consistency.

2.
Open the Bullets button’s menu and choose Bullets and Numbering. The Bullets and
Numbering dialog box appears with the Bulleted tab displayed.
3.
In the Size box, use the increment buttons to increase or decrease the size. The size is in
relation to the text size of the paragraph.
4.
Click the Color button, and select a color from the Color Picker. See Figure 7-3.
5.
Click OK to apply the changes.
Note
The color and size changes you make in the Bullets and Numbering dialog box affect all presets. ■
Changing the Bullet Symbol
If you do not like any of the preset bullets, you can change that preset position to a different
character. You can use any character from any font installed on your system, including any letter
or number.

Using a Picture Bullet
The Clip Organizer contains many small graphics that work well as bullets. Such graphics have
a keyword of ‘‘bullet’’ assigned to them. The Picture Bullet dialog box, which you can access by
clicking the Picture button in the Bullets and Numbering dialog box, is a special simpliﬁed ver-
sion of the Clip Organizer that shows only clips that have ‘‘bullet’’ as one of their keywords.
To use a picture bullet from the Clip Organizer, follow these steps:
1.
Select the paragraph(s) to which you want to apply the picture bullet. For best results,
make the change on the slide master to ensure consistency.
2.
Open the Bullets button’s menu and choose Bullets and Numbering. The Bullets and
Numbering dialog box appears with the Bulleted tab displayed.
3.
Click the preset that you want to replace, and then click Picture. The Picture Bullet dialog
box opens, as shown in Figure 7-5.
FIGURE 7-5

4.
Select the desired graphic.
5.
Click OK. The graphic appears in the preset position that you chose in step 3.
6.
Click OK to apply the graphic to the selected paragraphs as a bullet.
Tip
To see more bullet graphics, select the Include Content from Ofﬁce Online check box. Then close and
reopen the Picture Bullet dialog box. Be aware, however, that with a slow Internet connection, this might
dramatically decrease the performance of this dialog box, making scrolling and picture preview very
sluggish. ■
Note
The bullets with yellow stars in the bottom-right corner have special animation effects when you display
them in slide show view. The top-left bullet in Figure 7-5 has a yellow star on it, for example. Bullets with
a blue globe in the bottom-left corner are from the Web collection. ■
Most of the picture bullets are a ﬁxed color; they do not change color when you change the
theme, and they are not affected by the Color setting in the Bullets and Numbering dialog box.
You can also add your own pictures as bullets. For best results, stick with very small, simple
graphics. A detailed photo might look great as a full-screen image, but as a bullet it will probably
look blurry and unrecognizable. To import your own picture, follow these steps:
1.
Select the paragraph(s) to which you want to apply the picture bullet. For best results,
make the change on the slide master to ensure consistency.
2.
Open the Bullets button’s menu and choose Bullets and Numbering. The Bullets and
Numbering dialog box appears with the Bulleted tab displayed.
3.
Click the preset that you want to replace, and then click Picture. The Picture Bullet dialog
box opens, as shown in Figure 7-5.
4.
Click Import. The Add Clips to Organizer dialog box opens.
5.
Select the graphic you want to use and click Add. The picture appears as a thumbnail in
the Picture Bullet dialog box.
6.
Select the newly imported picture and click OK to apply the graphic as a bullet to the
selected paragraph(s).
Tip
If the picture bullet is too small or too large, reopen the Bullets and Numbering dialog box and increase or
decrease the Size setting. ■
Formatting Numbered Lists
Numbered lists are very similar to bulleted ones except instead of using the same character for
each item they use sequential numbers or letters. Use a numbered list whenever the order of the
items is signiﬁcant.
193

Part I: Building Your Presentation
Using Numbering Presets
To switch from bullets to numbering, or to apply numbering to text that has neither bullets
nor numbering applied already, click the Numbering button on the Home tab. This applies the
default numbering style — the one in position #1 of the presets.
Like the Bullets button, the Numbering button also has a drop-down list with seven preset for-
mats plus None, as shown in Figure 7-6. You can apply any of those presets from the menu.
Tip
You usually don’t want to apply numbering to the slide master, because it’s not the norm — bullets are.
Also, the optimal amount of space between paragraphs is often different when using numbered lists. Con-
sider creating a special master layout for numbered lists and applying your number formatting to that layout
in Slide Master view. ■
Changing Number Size and Color
Numbers can have different sizes and colors in relation to the rest of the paragraph text, just as
bullets can. Using a different size and/or color can make the numbers stand out. To change a
number’s size and color, follow these steps:
1.
Select the paragraph(s) to affect. If you want to create a layout master to store the number-
ing formatting, switch to Slide Master view and work on that layout master.
FIGURE 7-6

In the Size box, use the increment buttons to increase or decrease the size. The size is in
relation to the text size of the paragraph. See Figure 7-7.
4.
Click the Color button, and select a color from the Color Picker.
5.
Click OK to apply the changes.
Note
The color and size changes you make in the Bullets and Numbering dialog box affect all seven presets. ■
Changing the Start Number
To start the numbered list at some number other than 1, change the Start At value in the Bullets
and Numbering dialog box (see Figure 7-7). You might do this, for example, if a numbered list
continues from one slide or one text box to the next.
Setting Tabs and Indents
In PowerPoint 2003 and earlier, you applied tabs and indents to entire text boxes only; you
could not set them for individual paragraphs, as in Word. In PowerPoint 2007 and 2010, how-
ever, you can set them for each paragraph, so you have more control.
195

Part I: Building Your Presentation
Working with Indents
Each level of bullet (or numbering) on the Slide Master has a preset indent deﬁned for it. There
are two separate indents: one for the ﬁrst line of the paragraph, and another for subsequent lines.
They are represented on the ruler by triangles:
 First line indent: This down-pointing triangle represents the positioning of the ﬁrst line
of the paragraph. Because bulleted lists are the default, and the bullet character hangs to
the left of the rest of the paragraph, by default, the ﬁrst line indent is set to be farther to the
left.
 Hanging indent: This up-pointing triangle represents the positioning of the second and
subsequent lines in a multiline paragraph. If it is a single-line paragraph, this indent is
ignored.
 Left indent: This rectangle controls both of the triangles as a single unit. If you want
to move both triangles and maintain the spacing between them, you would drag this
rectangle.
You can drag these symbols on the horizontal ruler to change their positions, as shown in
Figure 7-8. (Hold down Ctrl as you drag if you want ﬁner control over the positioning.) You
can also click the Increase List Level or Decrease List Level buttons in the Paragraph group on
the Home tab to change the overall left indent.
You can also control indentation more precisely by using the Paragraph dialog box’s Indentation
controls. These controls let you specify indentation at intervals as small as 1/10 of an inch, but
they do not have an exact one-to-one relationship with the indent markers on the ruler, so you
have to do a bit of mental translation.
There are three indentation settings in the Paragraph dialog box, as shown in Figure 7-9. Open
this dialog box by clicking the dialog box launcher in the Paragraph group on the Home tab.
The settings are as follows:
 Before Text: This is a general left indent setting. It sets both the hanging indent marker
and the left indent marker.
 Special: This controls what happens to the ﬁrst line. The choices are Hanging, First Line,
or None. To indent the ﬁrst line to the left of the others, choose Hanging. If you want the
ﬁrst line to the right of the others, choose First Line.
FIGURE 7-8

Chapter 7: Formatting Paragraphs and Text Boxes
FIGURE 7-9
You can set up indentation via the Paragraph dialog box.
 By: If you chose Hanging or First Line, this sets the amount by which the ﬁrst line will be
offset from the Before Text setting.
Note
Unlike in Word, there is no right indent marker for paragraphs in PowerPoint. ■
Working with Tabs
Default tab stops occur every 1′′ on the ruler. Each time you press the Tab key (except at the
beginning of a paragraph), the insertion point moves to the next tab stop. If you press tab at the
beginning of a paragraph, the paragraph is demoted one outline level. (Usually that demotion
also involves an indentation as well, but the indentation is deﬁned on the Slide Master in that
case.)
In PowerPoint 2010, each paragraph can have its own separate custom tab stops set. (PowerPoint
2003 and earlier deﬁned a single set of tab stops for the entire text box.) To set tab stops, follow
these steps:
1.
View the slide containing the text box in Normal or Slide Master view and select the para-
graphs to affect.
2.
If the Ruler does not appear, choose View ➪Ruler.
3.
Click inside the text box for which you want to set tabs.
4.
Click the Ruler where you want to set the tab. A little L appears, showing that you’ve just
placed a left tab stop.
You can also set centered, right-aligned, or decimal-aligned tab stops. To set one of these, click
the Tab Type button at the far left of the Ruler. Each time you click this button, it cycles through
the available tab stop types, as shown in Table 7-1.
To get rid of a tab stop, drag and drop it off the Ruler.

You can also set tab stops via a Tabs dialog box for more precision. To access the Tabs dialog
box, follow these steps:
1.
Select the paragraph(s) to affect. To affect all slides, select the placeholders on the Slide
Master in Slide Master view.
2.
On the Home tab, click the dialog box launcher in the Paragraph group. The Paragraph

3.
Click the Tabs button. The Tabs dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 7-10. From the
Tabs dialog box, you can do any of the following:
 Set a Tab Stop: Type a number in the Tab Stop Position box to represent the number
of inches from the left edge of the text box. Click the button in the Alignment section
that represents the desired alignment, and then click Set.
FIGURE 7-10

198

Chapter 7: Formatting Paragraphs and Text Boxes
 Clear a Tab Stop: To clear just one stop, select the stop to clear and then click the
Clear button. To clear all custom tab stops, click Clear All.
 Change the Default Tab Stop Interval: The default interval is 1′′. To change that,
use the increment buttons in the Default Tab Stops box to increase or decrease the
value, or type a new value directly into the box.
Adjusting Line Spacing
Depending on the theme, PowerPoint leaves varying amounts of space between lines and
between paragraphs. The default blank theme leaves some extra space between each paragraph
to make the divisions between them clearer; other themes tighten this up.
If the chosen theme doesn’t provide the line spacing you want, open it up in Slide Master view
and make changes to the text placeholders on the slide master(s). For example:
 If most of your bulleted lists are single-line, you can eliminate any extra space between
paragraphs to make them seem closer together.
 If most of your bulleted lists are multiline paragraphs, you can add space between para-
graphs to help differentiate them.
 If you want to make a large paragraph easier to read, you can add extra space between the
lines.
To set basic line spacing, open the Line Spacing button’s menu in the Paragraph group on the
Home tab and select one of the presets, as shown in Figure 7-11.
If you want more line spacing options, click the dialog box launcher for the Paragraph group on
the Home tab or choose Line Spacing Options at the bottom of the Line Spacing button’s menu.
The Paragraph dialog box contains the line spacing controls, as shown in Figure 7-12. There are
three line spacing settings you can adjust:
 Before: Space before the paragraph
FIGURE 7-11
Choose a line spacing preset from the button’s menu.
199

Part I: Building Your Presentation
FIGURE 7-12
Adjust line spacing in the Paragraph dialog box.
 After: Space after the paragraph
 Line Spacing: Space between the lines within the paragraph
Before and After are pretty straightforward; you can set their values in points. (Remember, one
point is 1/72 of an inch on a printed page.) It may be helpful to think about the spacing in rela-
tion to the font size that you are using. For example, if you are using 24-point text, an After
setting of 8 points would leave 1/3 of a line between paragraphs.
You can set the Line Spacing to a preset value of Single, 1.5 Lines, or Double. You can also set
it to Multiple and then enter a custom value in the At box. For example, a Multiple value of 1
is single spacing; a Multiple value of 0.9 is slightly less than single spacing, for just a bit of extra
tightness in the layout.
All of the previously mentioned line spacing values are based on the text size in the paragraph,
and not ﬁxed amounts. As the text size changes, the line spacing will adjust automatically. If you
need ﬁxed line spacing that does not change when the font changes, choose Exactly from the
Line Spacing list. Then you can enter an exact number of points for the spacing in the At box.
Changing Horizontal Alignment
You can set horizontal alignment on a paragraph-by-paragraph basis. The default alignment is
Left, but you can also have Centered, Right, Justiﬁed, and Distributed:
 Left, Centered, and Right: These are fairly self-explanatory. They refer to the point at
which each line of text aligns with the other lines of text. For example, the text in this book
is left-aligned; the left edge of the paragraph is uniform and the right edge is ragged.
 Justiﬁed: Aligns with both the right and left margins of the text box. Space is added
between words and letters to make that happen. The ﬁnal line of the paragraph is not
200

Chapter 7: Formatting Paragraphs and Text Boxes
justiﬁed; it is left-aligned. Many newspapers use this alignment. It works best for long lines
of text where there is a lot of text in which to spread out the extra spacing. Although justify
looks good with large paragraphs, it is of limited usefulness for the brief bullet points that
are the hallmark of most slides because it does not affect the last line, and in brief bullets
the ﬁrst line is the last line.
 Distributed: This is just like Justiﬁed, except it includes the last line of the paragraph. You
can use it to apply the Justiﬁed look to a single-line paragraph.
The Paragraph group on the Home tab contains buttons for Left, Centered, Right, and Justiﬁed.
Click a button to change the alignment of the selected paragraph(s), as shown in Figure 7-13.
FIGURE 7-13
Click a button on the Paragraph group to set alignment.
Centered
Right
Justified
Left
To use Distributed alignment, you must use the Paragraph dialog box. Click the dialog
box launcher for the Paragraph group, and then choose the alignment from the Alignment
drop-down list. Distributed appears on that list along with the other alignments.
Tip
Alignment refers to the text’s position in its text box, not on the slide. If you want a text box centered on
the slide, but the text is left-aligned within the box, simply move the text box where you want it. To align
objects, rather than individual text paragraphs, see ‘‘Aligning and Distributing Objects’’ in Chapter 10. ■
Formatting Text Boxes
In addition to formatting the paragraphs within a text box, you can also format the text box
itself. In Chapter 4 you learned how to create, resize, and move text boxes; now it’s time to ﬁnd
out how to change their appearances.
Applying Fills and Outlines
Text boxes are just like any other object in their ﬁll and outline formatting. You get the full
details of object formatting in Chapter 10, but here’s a quick look.
The ﬁll is the center of the text box, and the outline is the border. Each can have separate for-
matting. For example, you can have a transparent ﬁll with a solid border or vice versa. You can
201

Part I: Building Your Presentation
apply one of the Shape Styles presets from the Format tab to apply both at once, or you can
adjust them separately with their respective menus on the Format tab. See Figure 7-14.
To apply one of the presets, click it, or open the gallery if the one you want doesn’t appear. At
the bottom of the gallery is Other Theme Fills, as shown in Figure 7-15. The ﬁlls on this sub-
menu are the same as the background ﬁlls available from the Design tab, covered in Chapter 5.
If you switch themes such that the background ﬁll presets change, the background of the text
box changes, too, if it is formatted with one of these.

FIGURE 7-15
Choose Other Theme Fills to select one of the theme’s backgrounds for the ﬁll of the text box.
202

Chapter 7: Formatting Paragraphs and Text Boxes
The Shape Fill and Shape Outline buttons, and their respective menus, will be familiar if you’ve
reviewed Chapter 6, because they’re very much the same as for text (WordArt). For the ﬁll, you
can choose a solid color, a gradient, a picture, or a texture. For the outline, you can select a
color, thickness, and dash style. See Chapter 10 for the full details on ﬁlls and outlines.
Selecting one of the background ﬁlls in Figure 7-15 ﬁlls the text box separately with one of the
background presets. It does not necessarily pick the same background preset as is applied to the
slide master. If you want the text box to always have the same ﬁll as the current background,
you can either leave it set to No Fill (the default ﬁll), or you can set its ﬁll to match the back-
ground:
1.
Right-click the text box and choose Format Shape.
2.
Click Fill if it is not already selected.
3.
Click Slide Background Fill.
4.
Click OK.
There is only one minor difference between No Fill and a Slide Background Fill. If there are any
objects stacked behind the text box, the text box obscures them when set to Background, but
shows them when set to No Fill. Figure 7-16 shows the difference for two text boxes placed on
a wood grain background with a ﬁlled oval overlaid.
Caution
After you’ve set the text box’s ﬁll to Background, the Shape Styles presets no longer work on it until you go
back into the Format Shape dialog box and set the ﬁll to Solid Fill or one of the other ﬁlls. ■
Setting Fill Transparency
Fill transparency determines how much of the background (or whatever is layered behind the text
box) shows through it. By default, it is set to 0, which means the text box is not transparent at
all when it has a ﬁll assigned to it. To set the ﬁll transparency, follow these steps:
1.
Apply the desired ﬁll.
2.
Right-click the text box and choose Format Shape. The Format Shape dialog box opens.
3.
Click Fill if the ﬁll controls are not already displayed. See Figure 7-17.
4.
Drag the Transparency slider or enter a percentage in its text box.
5.
Click Close.
Tip
If the ﬁll is a gradient, you must set the transparency separately for each of the gradient stops. (A stop is
a color in the gradient.) Set the Gradient Stops drop-down list to Stop 1, adjust the transparency, set it to
Stop 2, adjust the transparency, and so on. Chapter 10 explains gradients in more detail. ■

Controlling Vertical Alignment
The vertical alignment is the positioning of the text vertically within the text box. The default
vertical alignment is Top, which means that if there is extra space in the text box, it congregates
at the bottom.
For the main text placeholders in a presentation, Top alignment is usually the best because it
prevents the ﬁrst line of text on each slide from looking like it is inconsistently placed. However,
for a manual text box on an individual slide, Middle alignment often looks better, especially in a
text box that has an outline or ﬁll deﬁned.
You can choose Top, Middle, or Bottom alignment, or centered versions of each (Top Centered,
Middle Centered, or Bottom Centered). The centered versions center the text horizontally within
the text box, but it’s not the same thing as horizontal alignment on a paragraph level. The text
remains left-aligned with itself, but it scoots over to the center of the text box. Figure 7-19 shows
the difference.
If you want one of the basic three alignments, click Align Text in the Paragraph group on the
Home tab and select Top, Middle, or Bottom, as shown in Figure 7-20.
If you want one of the centered-type alignments, you must use the Paragraph dialog box. Follow
these steps:
1.
Right-click the text box and choose Format Shape to open the Format Shape dialog box
or choose More Options at the bottom of the Align Text button’s menu. (ES)

If Resize Shape to Fit Text is selected here, the text box can’t be made any taller than is
necessary to accommodate the text in it, so there will be no blank space to allocate verti-
cally and no difference between the vertical alignment settings.
5.
Click Close.
Changing Text Box Rotation
PowerPoint 2010 provides several types of rotation. You can spin things around a center point
(the traditional 2-D type of rotation), or you can apply several 3-D rotation effects. However, the
3-D type is not well suited for text boxes because it tends to distort the text.
Cross-Reference
See Chapter 10 to learn more about the 3-D type and to experiment with a text box. See Chapter 6 for 3-D
type as it pertains to WordArt. ■
You can rotate a text box in 2-D by dragging its rotation handle, the green circle at the top of
the text box. The text stays with it, so you can create upside-down text, sideways text, or text at
whatever angle you like, as shown in Figure 7-22.
If you want to rotate the text box only, but not the text within it, here’s how to accomplish that:
1.
Right-click the text box and choose Format Shape.
207

4.
Click the buttons on the Z: row to rotate the text box while leaving the text as is.
5.
Click Close.
Changing Text Direction
Instead of rotating the text box, you might prefer to just rotate the text within it. Text can run
vertically on its side, facing either to the left or right, or the letters can be at normal orientation
individually but stacked vertically. To set a text direction, use the Text Direction button in the
Paragraph group on the Home tab. Figure 7-23 shows the menu and some examples of the text
direction settings.
Caution
After changing the text direction, you might need to resize the text box so that the text ﬂows in the new
direction. ■
Tip
When text is rotated 90 or 270 degrees, as in Figure 7-23, it often looks better if you use the Character
Spacing button in the Font group to set its spacing to Loose. Conversely, Stacked text often looks better
when set to Very Tight. ■

FIGURE 7-23
You can set text direction separately from text box rotation.
Setting Internal Margins
A text box’s internal margins control the amount of blank space between the edge of the box
and the text inside it. It’s just like the margins in a word-processing document except that each
text box has its own individual margin settings. To set a text box’s internal margins, follow these
steps:
1.
Right-click the text box’s border and choose Format Shape. The Format Shape dialog box
opens.
2.
Click Text Box. The Text Box settings appear, as shown in Figure 7-21.
3.
In the Internal Margin section, change the Left, Right, Top, and Bottom settings as needed.
4.
Click Close.

Part I: Building Your Presentation
Creating Multiple Columns
In earlier versions of PowerPoint, if you wanted two columns of text, you had to place them in
separate text boxes. This was awkward because the text boxes were not linked, so if you added
or deleted in one box, the text did not ﬂow into the other. In PowerPoint 2010, you can set up a
text box to create multiple linked columns within a single text frame. This provides an easy way
to convert a single-column layout into a multicolumn one, and solves the problem with awkward
editing. To adjust the number of columns used in a text box, follow these steps:
1.
Select the text box.
2.
Click the Columns button in the Paragraph group on the Home tab.
3.
Select a number of columns from the menu, as shown in Figure 7-24.
If you need a different number of columns, or you want to specify the spacing between them,
choose More Columns from the menu. Then in the Columns dialog box (see Figure 7-25), enter
a Number to specify the number of columns, and set an amount of spacing in inches.
FIGURE 7-24

Chapter 7: Formatting Paragraphs and Text Boxes
Summary
In this chapter, you learned how to format text boxes and the paragraphs within them. You
learned about bulleted and numbered lists, tabs and indents, vertical and horizontal alignment,
and more. Now you have the tools you need to set up a text-based presentation. (Don’t worry,

But what good is nice-looking text if it’s inaccurate or contains spelling errors? In the next
chapter, you learn how to make corrections to text with the spelling checker and the research
tools, and you learn how to automate certain types of corrections.

P
owerPoint contains many tools that can help you avoid embarrassing
mistakes in your presentation’s text, and this chapter takes a look
at some of them. You’ll learn how to replace one text string with
another, perform a spelling check, set up PowerPoint to correct your most
common errors automatically, and use the research tools in PowerPoint,
including encyclopedias, translation guides, and thesauruses.
Finding and Replacing Text
Like all Microsoft applications, PowerPoint has a built-in Find tool, which
lets you search for — and, optionally, replace — a string of text anywhere in
your presentation. This feature works in all views except for slide show, in
which it isn’t applicable. However, in Slide Sorter view, it ﬁnds and replaces
all instances only; you cannot interactively conﬁrm each instance.
We will ﬁrst take a look at the Find function. For example, let’s say that Bob
Smith was ﬁred this morning. (Poor Bob.) Now you need to go through your
presentation and see whether Bob’s name is mentioned so that you can take
out any lines that refer to him. Follow these steps to ﬁnd a text string (such as
Bob Smith):
1.
Click Find on the Home tab, or press Ctrl+F. The Find dialog box
appears.
2.
Type what you want to ﬁnd in the Find What text box, as shown in
Figure 8-1. If you want to ﬁnd a text string that you have searched
for before, open the Find What drop-down list and select it. This is
sometimes faster than retyping.
3.
If you want to ﬁnd only whole words or to match the case, select the
appropriate check box.
213

Part I: Building Your Presentation
FIGURE 8-1
Type what you want to ﬁnd, and then click the Find Next button.
4.
Click Find Next. The display jumps to the ﬁrst instance of the text in your presentation,
starting from the insertion point, working downward through the presentation, and then
looping back to the top.
5.
If the found instance was not the one that you were looking for, or if you want to see if
there are other instances, then click the Find Next button again. You can continue clicking
the Find Next button until you have seen all of the instances. When PowerPoint cannot
ﬁnd any more instances, a message appears — The search text was not found — and you
must click OK to clear the message.
6.
Click Close when you are ﬁnished.
You can also perform a replace, which adds functionality to the Find feature. This action ﬁnds
the speciﬁed text and then replaces it with other text that you specify. For example, suppose
that you are preparing a presentation for the Acme Corporation’s sales staff. Two days before the
presentation, you ﬁnd out that the Primo Corporation has purchased Acme. You now need to go
through the entire presentation and change every instance of Acme to Primo.
Tip
While you are using the Find feature, as explained in the preceding steps, you can switch to the Replace
dialog box by clicking the Replace button. When you do so, the Find string transfers over to the
Replace dialog box, so that you don’t have to retype it. ■
To ﬁnd and replace a text string, follow these steps:
1.
Click Replace on the Home tab, or press Ctrl+H. The Replace dialog box appears.
Note
The Replace button has a drop-down list. From this list, you can tell Replace Fonts to do a ﬁnd-and-replace for
certain font usage. You learn more about this in Chapter 6. ■
2.
Type the text that you want to ﬁnd in the Find What text box. If you have previously used
Find or Replace, the most recent text that you found appears in the text box.
3.
Type the new text in the Replace With text box. For example, if you were replacing
layoffs with downsizing, it would look like Figure 8-2.
4.
If you want whole words only or a case-sensitive search, select the appropriate check box.
214

Chapter 8: Correcting and Improving Text
FIGURE 8-2
Enter what you want to ﬁnd and what you want to replace it with.
5.
Click Find Next to ﬁnd the ﬁrst instance.
6.
If you want to replace that instance, click the Replace button. The next instance appears
automatically. After this, click Find Next to go on.
7.
Repeat step 6 to check and selectively replace each instance, or click the Replace All but-
ton to change all instances at once.
8.
When you are ﬁnished, click Close. You may have to click OK ﬁrst to clear a dialog box
telling you that the speciﬁed text was not found.
Correcting Your Spelling
If you think that a spelling check can’t improve the look of your presentation, just think for a
moment how ugly a blatant spelling error would look in huge type on a ﬁve-foot projection
screen. Frightening, isn’t it? If that image makes you nervous, it should. Spelling mistakes can
creep past even the most literate people, and pop up where you least expect them, often at
embarrassing moments.
Fortunately, like other Microsoft Ofﬁce programs, PowerPoint comes with a powerful spelling
program that can check your work for you at any time, minimizing the number of embarrassing
spelling mistakes. The Ofﬁce programs all use the same spelling checker, and so if you are famil-
iar with it in another Ofﬁce application, you should be able to breeze through a spell check in
PowerPoint with no problem.
Caution
When PowerPoint marks a word as misspelled, it really just means that the word is not in its dictionary.
Many words, especially proper names, are perfectly okay to use, even though they are not in PowerPoint’s
dictionary, so don’t believe PowerPoint against your own good judgment. ■
Checking an Individual Word
As you work, PowerPoint underlines words that aren’t in its dictionary with a red, wavy
line. Whenever you see a red-underlined word, you can right-click it to see a list of spelling
215

Part I: Building Your Presentation
suggestions, as shown in Figure 8-3. Click the correction that you want, or click one of the
other commands:
 Ignore All: Ignores this and all other instances of the word in this PowerPoint session. If
you exit and restart PowerPoint, the list is wiped out.
 Add to Dictionary: Adds this word to PowerPoint’s custom dictionary. (You learn more
about the custom dictionary later in this chapter.)
 Spelling: Opens the spelling checker, described in the next section.
FIGURE 8-3
Right-click a red-underlined word for quick spelling advice.
Tip
If you don’t want to see the red, wavy underlines on-screen, you can turn the feature off by selecting File ➪
Options, and then clicking Prooﬁng. Click the Hide Spelling Errors check box and click OK. This just turns
the underlines off; it doesn’t stop PowerPoint from checking spelling as you type. A separate Check Spelling
as You Type check box, in the same location, does that. Turning off Check Spelling as You Type relieves
PowerPoint of a small processing burden, making it run a bit faster. ■
Checking the Entire Presentation
If your presentation is long, it can become tiresome to individually right-click each
wavy-underlined word or phrase. In such cases, it’s easier to use the spell-check feature in
PowerPoint to check all of the words in the presentation.
To begin the spell check, click the Spelling button on the Review tab, or press F7. If there are no
misspelled words in your presentation, PowerPoint presents a dialog box telling you that your
spell check is complete. Click OK to close this dialog box. If, on the other hand, PowerPoint
ﬁnds a misspelled word, you can choose from several options, as shown in Figure 8-4:
 Not in Dictionary text box: Shows the misspelled word.
 Change to text box: Shows what the spelling will be changed to if you click the Change
or Change All buttons. You can choose a word from the Suggestions list or type your own
correction here.
216

Chapter 8: Correcting and Improving Text
FIGURE 8-4
When PowerPoint ﬁnds a misspelled word with the spell checker, you can respond
to it using these controls.
 Suggestions text box: Lists words that are close to the spelling of the word that you actu-
ally typed. Choose the one you want by clicking it; this moves it to the Change To text box.
 Ignore All button: Skips over all occurrences of the word in this PowerPoint session only.
 Change button: Changes the word to the word shown in the Change To text box.
 Change All button: Changes all occurrences of the word in the entire presentation to the
word in the Change To text box.
 Add button: Adds the word to PowerPoint’s custom dictionary so that it is recognized in
the future.
 Suggest button: Displays the suggestions in the Suggestions text box if you have set the
spell checker’s options so that suggestions do not automatically appear.
 AutoCorrect button: Adds the word to the AutoCorrect list so that if you misspell it the
same way in the future, PowerPoint automatically corrects it as you type. See the ‘‘Using
AutoCorrect to Fix Common Problems’’ section later in this chapter.
 Close button: Closes the Spelling dialog box.
When PowerPoint can’t ﬁnd any more misspelled words, it displays a dialog box to let you know
this; click OK to close it.
Tip
If you have more than one language dictionary available (for example, if you use PowerPoint in a multi-
lingual ofﬁce and have purchased multiple language packs from Microsoft), then you can specify which
language’s dictionary to use for which text. To do so, select the text that is in a different language than
the rest of the presentation, and then click Set Language on the Review tab. Select the appropriate language
from the list and click OK. ■
Setting Spelling Options
To control how (and whether) the spell checker operates, do the following:
1.
Choose File ➪Options, and click Prooﬁng. The Prooﬁng options appear, as shown in
Figure 8-5.
217

Part I: Building Your Presentation
FIGURE 8-5
You can set spelling options here.
2.
Select or deselect any of the check boxes as desired in the When correcting spelling in
Microsoft ofﬁce programs section:
 Ignore words in UPPERCASE: Prevents the spell checker from ﬂagging acronyms.
 Ignore words that contain numbers: Prevents the spell checker from noticing words
with digits in them, such as license plate numbers or model numbers.
 Ignore Internet and ﬁle addresses: Prevents the spell checker from ﬂagging Web or
e-mail addresses, network paths, or ﬁle paths.
 Flag repeated words: Flags second and subsequent instances of the same word in a
row, preventing you from making mistakes like writing ‘‘the the.’’
 Enforce accented uppercase in French: Suggests accents for uppercase letters as
appropriate. Applicable only when the editing language is French.
218

Chapter 8: Correcting and Improving Text
 Suggest from main dictionary only: Ignores any custom spelling dictionaries if any
are present.
 Foreign Language Modes: Use the drop-down lists for each of the languages
to ﬁne-tune the spell check for each language: French, Spanish, Portuguese, and
Brazilian.
Note
The options in the When correcting spelling in PowerPoint section apply across all Ofﬁce programs, including
Word and Excel. ■
3.
Select or deselect any of the check boxes as desired in the When correcting spelling in
PowerPoint section:
 Check spelling as you type: This option is on by default. Turning it off prevents the
spell checker from noticing and underlining words in red that it can’t ﬁnd in its dic-
tionary. This can cause a small improvement in performance on a slow computer; you
will not notice the difference on a fast computer.
 Use contextual spelling: Allows PowerPoint to ﬂag possible errors in context.
For example, when this feature is on, PowerPoint identiﬁes ‘‘I will go their.’’ as a
misspelling for the word ‘‘there.’’ This feature also uses some memory, and so it can
affect performance on a slow computer.
 Hide spelling errors: This option is off by default. Selecting this check box prevents
the red, wavy underline from appearing beneath misspelled words. It does not prevent
the spell checker from checking them; you can right-click a misspelled word to see
suggestions for it, as you normally would.
4.
Click OK to accept the new settings.
Working with Custom Dictionaries
The main spelling dictionary in PowerPoint is read-only, and so when you add words to the dic-
tionary, these words have to be stored somewhere else. This is where custom dictionaries come
in. A custom dictionary contains a list of words that should not be ﬂagged as misspellings. It
can include proper names, acronyms, abbreviations, or any other codes or text strings that you
frequently type.
Note
PowerPoint shares custom dictionaries with the other Ofﬁce 2010 applications, and so you can use these
dictionaries in PowerPoint or in one of the other applications. ■
The default custom dictionary is called custom.dic, and it’s stored in a separate
folder for each local user. If you are running Windows Vista or Windows 7, it’s in
Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\UProof. If you are running Windows XP,
it’s in Documents and Settings\username\Application Data\Microsoft\UProof. Because it is
unique to the logged-in user, each user can have his or her own custom dictionary.
219

Part I: Building Your Presentation
Tip
If there is a custom.dic ﬁle in a folder called Proof (as opposed to UProof), it’s left over from an earlier
version of Ofﬁce. If you upgraded to Ofﬁce 2010 from version 2003 or earlier, any words that you already
set up in it were copied over to the version in the UProof folder. Leave it in place if you still run an
older version of Ofﬁce on your computer in addition to 2010. Otherwise, you can delete it or leave it as
you want. ■
Editing the Custom Dictionary
As you are spell checking, one of the options that you can use is Add to Dictionary — mentioned
earlier in the chapter — which adds the word to the default custom dictionary. By default, this
ﬁle is custom.dic. You’ll learn how to create additional custom dictionaries later in this chapter.
You can also add words to the custom dictionary without having to type them in the presenta-
tion and then spell check them. Follow these steps to add words:
1.
Choose File ➪Options.
2.
Click Prooﬁng.
3.
Click Custom Dictionaries.
4.
Select the desired custom dictionary from the list. In Figure 8-6, only the default
custom.dic dictionary appears.
5.
Click Edit Word List. A dialog box appears, listing all of the words that are currently in
that dictionary.
FIGURE 8-6
Edit custom dictionaries from the Custom Dictionaries dialog box.
6.
To add a new word, type it in the Word(s) text box and click Add. Words can be no
longer than 64 characters.
7.
To delete a word, select it and click Delete. To clear the entire custom dictionary, click
Delete All.
8.
Click OK when you are ﬁnished editing the custom dictionary.
220

Chapter 8: Correcting and Improving Text
Caution
The custom dictionary accepts multi-word entries, but you must enter them as separate words in the list;
it does not recognize spellings that consist of only part of the word. For example, you could enter Shawna
Browslawski, but the spell checker would not recognize Shawna or Browslawski by themselves. However, if
you enter them as separate words, they are accepted either individually or together. ■
If you have a lot of words to add to the dictionary, you might prefer to edit the dictionary ﬁle
manually. Dictionary ﬁles are plain-text ﬁles, and so you can edit them in Notepad. You can
even combine two or more separate dictionary ﬁles into a single ﬁle by copying and pasting
lists of words between them. To edit a dictionary ﬁle, open it in a text editor such as Notepad.
Remember, the paths for the dictionary ﬁles are:
 Windows Vista or Windows 7: Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\UProof
 Windows XP: Documents and Settings\username\Application Data\Microsoft\UProof
Creating a New Custom Dictionary
A custom dictionary ﬁle can be as large as 64KB in size, or 5,000 words. If you need a larger
custom dictionary than this, you must create another dictionary ﬁle. You might also want addi-
tional custom dictionaries to keep sets of words separate for different clients or projects. For
example, when working for a client with many trademarked product names that consist of non-
traditional spellings of common words, you might want to set those names as correctly spelled,
but when working for another client who does not use those names, you might want those
words to be ﬂagged as possible misspellings. You can enable or disable each custom dictionary,
and so you can enable only the dictionaries that apply to the present project.
Tip
All spell checks use the main dictionary as well as all of the dictionaries that are selected in the Dictio-
nary List. To disable a certain dictionary from being used, deselect its check box in the Custom Dictionaries
dialog box. ■
To create a custom dictionary, follow these steps:
1.
Choose File ➪Options.
2.
Click Prooﬁng.
3.
Click Custom Dictionaries.
4.
Click New. The Create Custom Dictionary dialog box appears.
5.
Navigate to the location in which you want to store the dictionary. The location where
you store it depends on who you want to be able to access it:
 To make the dictionary accessible to all users of your PC, create a new folder on the
C drive called Dictionaries (or anything else you want to call it) and store dictionaries
there.
 To make the dictionary accessible to only the current Windows user, store it in the
default custom dictionary location:
221

Part I: Building Your Presentation
Windows Vista or Windows 7: Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\UProof
Windows XP: Documents and Settings\username\Application Data\Microsoft\UProof
6.
Type a name for the dictionary in the File name text box.
7.
Click Save.
The new dictionary appears in the Dictionary List in the Custom Dictionaries dialog box.
Tip
All enabled custom dictionaries are checked automatically during the spell-check process, but newly added
words are placed only in the default custom dictionary. To set the default dictionary, select a custom dic-
tionary in the Custom Dictionaries dialog box and then click the Change Default button. ■
Setting the Editing Language
PowerPoint performs spell check using the native language for your copy of Ofﬁce. For example,
if you bought your copy in the United States, then English (U.S.) is the default language. It is
important that you select the correct country as well as the correct language because some coun-
tries have different spellings for the same language than others. For example, in the United King-
dom, ‘‘s’’ substitutes for the American ‘‘z’’ in words like realise/realize, so if you use the wrong
editing language, words will be marked as misspelled when they really aren’t. The Language set-
ting is also used by some of the research tools, which are covered later in this chapter.
To mark a passage of text as a certain language (and country if applicable), follow these steps:
1.
Select the text that you want to mark. To mark text on more than one slide, select the text
from the Outline pane.
2.
On the Review tab, click Editing Language. The Language dialog box opens.
3.
Select the language and country from the list, as shown in Figure 8-7.
4.
(Optional) To set a certain language as the default, select it and click Default; then click
Yes to conﬁrm.
5.
Click OK.
FIGURE 8-7

Chapter 8: Correcting and Improving Text
Using AutoCorrect to Fix
Common Problems
With AutoCorrect, PowerPoint can automatically correct certain common misspellings and
formatting errors as you type. One way to add a word to the AutoCorrect list is to click the
AutoCorrect button in the Spelling dialog box. Another way is to directly access the AutoCorrect
options. To access AutoCorrect, follow these steps:
1.
Choose File ➪Options.
2.
Click Prooﬁng.
3.
Click AutoCorrect Options. The AutoCorrect dialog box opens.
4.
If it is not already displayed, click the AutoCorrect tab, as shown in Figure 8-8.
FIGURE 8-8
Set up the corrections that you want PowerPoint to handle as you type.
5.
Select the options that you want. At the top of the dialog box is a series of check boxes
that help you to ﬁne-tune some other corrections that AutoCorrect makes in addition to
spelling corrections:
 Show AutoCorrect Options buttons: This option controls whether a button is avail-
able to reverse an AutoCorrect action after the action occurs. (For more on how to use
this button, see the end of this section.)
 Correct TWo INitial CApitals: If you accidentally hold down the Shift key too long
and type two capital letters in a row (such as MIcrosoft), PowerPoint corrects this error
if you leave this option selected.
223

Part I: Building Your Presentation
 Capitalize ﬁrst letter of sentences: Leave this option selected to have PowerPoint
capitalize the ﬁrst letter of the ﬁrst word after a sentence-ending punctuation mark,
such as a period, or to capitalize the ﬁrst letter of the word that occurs at the beginning
of a paragraph.
Tip
Click the Exceptions button to open an AutoCorrect Exceptions dialog box. Here, you can enter a list of capi-
talization exceptions, such as abbreviations that use periods but aren’t at the end of a sentence (for example,
approx. and Ave.). You can also set up a list of Two Initial Capitals exceptions. ■
 Capitalize ﬁrst letter of table cells: Leave this option selected to capitalize the ﬁrst
letter of the ﬁrst word within a table cell. Otherwise, PowerPoint does not treat text in
a table as a sentence for capitalization purposes.
 Capitalize names of days: Leave this option selected to make sure that the names of
days, such as Sunday, Monday, and so on, are capitalized.
 Correct accidental use of CAPS LOCK key: If you accidentally leave the Caps Lock
on, PowerPoint can sometimes detect it and ﬁx this problem. For example, if you type
the sentence, ‘‘hE WAS GLAD TO SEE US,’’ PowerPoint may conclude that the Caps
Lock is inappropriately on, and so it turns the Caps Lock off for you and ﬁxes the sen-
tence.
 Replace text as you type: This option activates the main portion of AutoCorrect,
the word list. You must leave this option selected if you want AutoCorrect to correct
spelling as you are typing. For example, if you type ‘‘yoiu,’’ PowerPoint automatically
changes it to ‘‘you.’’
6.
Add items that you commonly misspell to the Replace/With list at the bottom of the dia-
log box. By default, this list already contains a number of word and symbol pairs. To the
left is the common misspelling, and to the right is the word that PowerPoint substitutes
in its place. Scroll through this list to see the types of corrections that PowerPoint makes.
To add a word pair to the list, type the misspelling in the Replace text box and then type
the replacement in the With text box. Then click the Add button. You can also add cor-
rections through the Spelling dialog box.
Tip
You can use AutoCorrect to insert typographical symbols. The (C) entry is already set up to insert a copyright
symbol, for example, and the (R) entry will insert a registered trademark symbol. If there is a symbol you use
frequently yourself, feel free to set up an AutoCorrect entry to insert it more easily. ■
If PowerPoint insists on making a correction that you do not want, you can delete that
correction from the list. Simply select it from the list and click Delete. For example, one
of my clients likes me to code certain headings with (C) in front of them, and so the ﬁrst
thing that I do in any Ofﬁce program is to remove the AutoCorrect entry that speciﬁes that
(C) must be converted to a copyright symbol ©.
7.
When you are ﬁnished, click OK to close the AutoCorrect dialog box.
224

Chapter 8: Correcting and Improving Text
Caution
Don’t use AutoCorrect for misspellings that you may sometimes want to change to some other word, or
you may introduce embarrassing mistakes into your document. For example, if you often type ‘‘pian’’
instead of ‘‘pain,’’ and you also sometimes type ‘‘pian’’ instead of ‘‘piano,’’ don’t tell PowerPoint to always
AutoCorrect to ‘‘pain,’’ or you may ﬁnd that PowerPoint has corrected your attempt at typing piano and
made it a pain! ■
When an AutoCorrect action occurs, provided you have not turned off the icon, a small, blue
rectangle appears when you point at the AutoCorrected word. Place your cursor over it to
display an icon, and then click the icon to see a menu, as shown in Figure 8-9. From here,
you can reverse the action, disable that particular correction, or open the AutoCorrect Options
dialog box.
FIGURE 8-9
You can reverse an action, disable a correction, or open the AutoCorrect Options dialog box.
Using AutoFormat As You Type
The AutoFormat As You Type feature enables PowerPoint to convert certain letter combinations
to typographical characters that look nicer on a slide than plain text. For example, one of the
AutoFormat As You Type actions is to convert two dashes (--) into a single long dash ( — ).
Other actions include automatic bulleted and numbered lists. For example, in a manual text box,
you might type 1, press Tab, and type a paragraph, then type 2, press Tab, and type another
paragraph. In this case, PowerPoint would guess that you want a numbered list and applies the
Numbering format to those paragraphs (just as if you had clicked the Numbering button on the
toolbar). Figure 8-10 shows all of the AutoFormat As You Type options.
To change the AutoFormat As You Type settings, follow these steps:
1.
Choose File ➪Options.
2.
Click Prooﬁng, and then click AutoCorrect Options.
3.
Click the AutoFormat As You Type tab.
4.
Select or deselect the options for the features that you want.
5.
Click OK.

Cross-Reference
For more on the AutoFit title text and body text feature, as well as changing a text box’s AutoFit behavior
in general, see Chapter 4. ■
Using Smart Tags
When you move your mouse over certain types of text, a smart tag appears. Depending on
the text, a smart tag might offer to perform a variety of actions on that text, such as looking
up an address, scheduling a meeting, or getting a stock quote. Smart tags are ‘‘smart’’ in that
PowerPoint is able to determine the type of content by its format and then offer appropriate
choices. For example, PowerPoint can distinguish dates and telephone numbers from ordinary
numbers, based on their patterns.
You can control the speciﬁc Smart Tag labels through the AutoCorrect dialog box. Here you can
choose what types of recognizers you want to use. A recognizer is a type of data, such as Date,
Financial Symbol, Place, and so on. The types of tags depend on what is installed on your PC.
By default, PowerPoint includes the following recognizers:
 Measurement converter: Identiﬁes measurements and offers to convert them to other
units.
 Dates: You can display the Outlook calendar and schedule a meeting.
226

Chapter 8: Correcting and Improving Text
 Financial symbols: You can get stock quotes, company reports, and business news from
MSN MoneyCentral.
A smart tag appears in a document as a dotted purple underline with an ‘‘i’’ icon. Click this icon
for a menu of actions that you can perform, as shown in Figure 8-11.
FIGURE 8-11
Use a smart tag by clicking its button and selecting from its menu.
Smart tags are not enabled by default, and so you must turn them on if you want to use them.
At the same time, you can also conﬁgure the tags, and add new tags if desired, by following
these steps:
1.
Choose File ➪Options.
2.
Click Prooﬁng.
3.
Click AutoCorrect Options. The AutoCorrect dialog box opens.
4.
Click the Smart Tags tab.
5.
To turn the Smart Tag labels on or off, select or deselect the Label Text with the Smart
Tags option.
6.
Select or deselect the options for each individual recognizer type, as shown in Figure 8-12.
7.
After enabling or disabling the desired smart tags, click Check Presentation. PowerPoint
re-checks the presentation for eligible text.
8.
A conﬁrmation box appears when the check is ﬁnished; click OK.
9.
Browse through the presentation and look for the Smart Tag icon; when you see it, you
can click it to access the smart tag.
Other smart tags are available, some for free and some for an additional charge. To see what’s
available, click the More Smart Tags button on the Smart Tags tab of the AutoCorrect dialog box
(Figure 8-12). Then follow the hyperlinks to the various services to learn about their beneﬁts and
costs. After you install new smart tags, these new tags might not be available until you exit and
restart PowerPoint.

Using the Research Tools
The Research feature is available in most of the Ofﬁce applications, including PowerPoint. It
enables you to connect with various online and ofﬂine data stores to look up information. This
may include online encyclopedias, dictionaries, and news services.
The available tools are divided into three broad categories of sites: reference, research, and
business/ﬁnancial. Reference sites include dictionaries, thesauruses, and translation utilities;
research sites include encyclopedias and news services; business and ﬁnancial information
includes stock quotes and company proﬁles.
You can consult all of the reference sites as a group, or you can consult an individual tool. For
example, you can look up a word in the dictionary, thesaurus, or translator all at once, or you
can just use the thesaurus.
Looking up a Word in a Dictionary
To get a simple, concise deﬁnition of a word, a dictionary is your best bet. Here’s how to use the
dictionary in PowerPoint:
1.
On the Review tab, click Research. The Research task pane opens.
2.
Open the drop-down list of references at the top of the task pane and choose Encarta Dic-
tionary: English (North America), or whatever language and country is appropriate.
3.
In the search for text box, type the word that you want to look up, and either press Enter
or click the green arrow icon. A deﬁnition of the word appears, as shown in Figure 8-13.
228

Chapter 8: Correcting and Improving Text
FIGURE 8-13
Look up a word in the Encarta Dictionary.
Tip
There are multiple dictionaries available; click the Research Options link at the bottom of the task pane to
open a dialog box from which you can select other dictionaries. For example, the English version of Ofﬁce
comes with both North American and United Kingdom dictionaries, although only one is enabled by default
(depending on the country in which you purchased Ofﬁce). ■
Finding Synonyms and Antonyms with the Thesaurus
The thesaurus feature works just like a hardbound thesaurus book. It lets you look up synonyms
and antonyms for a word so that you can make your vocabulary more varied and colorful.
Note
A synonym is a word that has a similar meaning to another word. An antonym is a word that has the oppo-
site meaning. ■
To look up a word in the thesaurus, follow these steps:
1.
Select a word that you want to look up.
229

2.
On the Review tab, click Thesaurus. The Research task pane opens with the word’s syn-
onyms and antonyms displayed.
Synonyms are grouped by general meaning. Antonyms are followed by the word
(Antonym).
Notice that the Thesaurus button opens the same task pane as the Research button, but
with the Thesaurus tool selected.
Note
If the word that you want to look up does not already appear in the presentation, skip step 1, and then, after
clicking the Thesaurus button, type the desired word in the search for text box. Then press Enter or click the
green arrow icon. ■

To insert a word into the presentation, do the following:
a. Position the insertion point where you want to insert the found word, or select the
word that you want to replace (if you did not select it already in step 1).
b. Open the task pane menu for the word that you want to insert. (Move your cursor over
the word to display a down arrow, and then click the down arrow.)

c. Click Insert. As you can see in Figure 8-14, you can also click Copy (to copy it to the
Clipboard for later insertion) and Look Up (to look up that word in the thesaurus).
Translating Text into Another Language
Translation helps you to translate text into a variety of languages. It’s not a perfect translation by
any means, so don’t embarrass yourself and try to translate your entire presentation for a foreign
audience. However, for simple words and phrases, as well as rough approximations of meaning,
it can serve you well. To translate a passage of text in your presentation, follow these steps:
1.
Select the text to be translated.
2.
On the Review tab, click Translate ➪Translate Selected Text. The Translation tools appear
in the Research task pane.
3.
Select the desired languages in the From and To drop-down lists, as shown in Figure 8-15.
4.
Click the green arrow icon. A translation appears for the selected text.
FIGURE 8-15

FIGURE 8-16
Find in-depth information about a term or phrase with the Research group of sources.
Ofﬁce 2010 also includes a Mini Translator utility that can quickly help you translate text into
a speciﬁed language. To enable it, choose Review ➪Translate ➪Mini Translator. In the dia-
log box that appears, choose the language you want to translate into and click OK. After doing
that, you can point to a word to pop up a Mini Translator, which provides a translation for
the word if one is available. From the Mini Translator you can also click Expand (to open the
Research pane).
Using Research Sites
The research sites are sources that provide more in-depth information about a particular word or
phrase, such as encyclopedias and news services. To use one of these services, follow these steps:
1.
Select the word or phrase that you want to look up.
2.
On the Review tab, click Research. The Research task pane opens. If it was already open,
it closes; click the Research button again to reopen it.
232

Chapter 8: Correcting and Improving Text
3.
Open the list of services and choose All Research Sites (or a particular site, if desired).
4.
In the results that appear, click a hyperlink to read its information, as shown in
Figure 8-16. Depending on what you select, a separate Web browser window may open.
Caution
Keep in mind that proper attribution of sources is a must. If you copy information from an online source
such as an encyclopedia or news service, you must cite your source. Also, depending on the source, you
might need to get written permission to use the data. This is especially true with photographs. Very few
news services permit you to reuse their photos without permission. ■
Using Business and Financial Sites
The business and ﬁnancial sites work just like research sites, except that they provide infor-
mation that would be of more use to a businessperson evaluating a company. For example,
Figure 8-17 shows the business summary that is provided for Microsoft. You can use these sites
in the same way as in the preceding steps, except that you must choose All Business and Finan-
cial Sites in step 3.

ou can type tabular data — in other words, data in a grid of rows and
columns — directly into a table, or import it from other applications.
You can also apply much of the formatting that you learned about in
Chapters 6 and 7, but there are some special methods that you must con-
sider when working with tabular data. In this chapter, you’ll learn how to
create and manage PowerPoint tables and how to insert tabular data from
other sources.
Creating a New Table
A table is a great way to organize little bits of data into a meaningful pic-
ture. For example, you might use a table to show sales results for several
salespeople or to contain a multicolumn list of team member names.
Note
Text from a table does not appear in the presentation’s outline. ■
There are several ways to insert a table, and each method has its purpose.
The following sections explain each of the table creation methods. (Methods
that involve using other programs, such as Word or Excel, are covered later
in the chapter, in the sections ‘‘Using Tables from Word’’ and ‘‘Integrating
Excel Cells into PowerPoint.’’)
A table can be part of a content placeholder, or it can be a separate,
free-ﬂoating item. If the active slide has an available placeholder that can
accommodate a table, and there is not already content in that placeholder,
the table is placed in it. Otherwise the table is placed as an independent
object on the slide and is not part of the layout.
235

Part I: Building Your Presentation
Tip
Depending on what you want to do with the table, it could be advantageous in some cases to not have the
table be part of the layout. For example, perhaps you want the table to be a certain size and to not change
when you apply a different theme. To ensure that the table is not part of the layout, start with a slide that
uses a layout that contains no table-compatible placeholder, such as Title Only. ■
Creating a Table with the Insert Table Dialog Box
To create a basic table with a speciﬁed number of rows and columns, you can use the Insert
Table dialog box. You can open it in either of two ways (see Figure 9-1):
 In a content placeholder, click the Table icon.
 On the Insert tab, choose Table ➪Insert Table.
FIGURE 9-1
Open the Insert Table dialog box from either the Table menu or a content placeholder.
Choose

In the Insert Table dialog box shown in Figure 9-2, specify a number of rows and columns and
click OK. The table then appears on the slide.
FIGURE 9-2
Enter the number of rows and columns to specify the size of the table that you want to create.
236

Chapter 9: Creating and Formatting Tables
Creating a Table from the Table Button
When you opened the Table button’s menu (see Figure 9-1) in the preceding section, you prob-
ably couldn’t help but notice the grid of white squares. Another way to create a table is to drag
across this grid until you select the desired number of rows and columns. The table appears
immediately on the slide as you drag, so you can see how it will look, as shown in Figure 9-3.
FIGURE 9-3
Drag across the grid in the Table button’s menu to specify the size of the table that you want to
create.

Drag

grid
Other than the method of specifying rows and columns, this method is identical to creating a
table via the Insert Table dialog box, because the same issues apply regarding placeholders versus
free-ﬂoating tables. If a placeholder is available, PowerPoint uses it.
Note
When you create a table with this method and the preceding one, the table is automatically formatted with
one of the preset table styles. You learn how to change this later in the chapter. ■
Drawing a Table
I’ve saved the most fun method for last. Drawing a table enables you to use your mouse pointer
like a pencil to create every row and column in the table in exactly the positions you want. You
can even create unequal numbers of rows and columns. This method is a good one to use when-
ever you want a table that is nonstandard in some way — different row heights, different column
widths, different numbers of columns in some rows, and so on. To draw a table, follow these
steps:
1.
From the Insert tab, click Table, and choose Draw Table. The mouse pointer turns into a
pencil.
237

Part I: Building Your Presentation
2.
Drag to draw a rectangle representing the outer frame of the table. Then release the mouse
button to create the outer frame and to display the Table Tools Design tab.
3.
On the Table Tools Design tab, click Draw Table to re-enable the Pencil tool if it is not
already enabled.
4.
Drag to draw the rows and columns you want. You can draw a row or column that runs
all the way across or down the table’s frame, or you can stop at any point to make a
partial row or column. See Figure 9-4. When you begin to drag vertically or horizontally,
PowerPoint locks into that mode and keeps the line exactly vertical or horizontal and
straight. (Exception: It allows you to draw a diagonal line between two corners of
existing cells.)
5.
(Optional) To erase a line, click the Eraser button on the Table Tools Design tab, and then
click the line to erase. Then click the Draw Table button on the Design tab to return the
mouse pointer to its drawing (pencil) mode.
6.
When you ﬁnish drawing the table, press Esc or click Draw Table again to toggle the
drawing mode off.
Tip
If you need a table that is mostly uniform but has a few anomalies, such as a few combined cells or a few
extra divisions, create the table using the Insert Table dialog box or the grid on the Table button, and then
use the Draw Table and/or Eraser buttons on the Design tab to modify it. ■

Chapter 9: Creating and Formatting Tables
Moving around in a Table
Each cell is like a little text box. To type in a cell, click in it and type. It’s pretty simple! You can
also move between cells with the keyboard. Table 9-1 lists the keyboard shortcuts for moving
the insertion point in a table.

Selecting Rows, Columns, and Cells
If you want to apply formatting to one or more cells, or issue a command that acts upon
them such as Copy or Delete, you must ﬁrst select the cells to be affected, as shown in
Figure 9-5:
 A single cell: Move the insertion point by clicking inside the desired cell. At this point,
any command acts on that individual cell and its contents, not the whole table, row, or
column. Drag across multiple cells to select them.
 An entire row or column: Click any cell in that row or column and then open the Select
button’s menu on the Layout tab and choose Select Column or Select Row. Alternatively,
position the mouse pointer above the column or to the left of the row, so that the mouse
pointer turns into a black arrow, and then click to select the column or row. (You can
drag to extend the selection to additional columns or rows when you see the black
arrow.)
There are two ways to select the entire table — or rather, two senses in which the entire table
can be ‘‘selected’’:
 Select all table cells: When you select all of the cells, they all appear with shaded back-
grounds, and any text formatting command that you apply at that point affects all of the
text in the table. To select all cells, do any of the following:
 Drag across all of the cells in the entire table.
 Click inside the table, and then press Ctrl+A.

 Select the entire table: When you do this, the table’s frame is selected, but the insertion
point is not anywhere within the table and cells do not appear with a shaded background.
You do this kind of selection before moving or resizing the table, for example. To select the
entire table, do any of the following:
 Choose Select Table from the Select button’s menu, shown in Figure 9-5.
 Click the frame of the table.
 Click inside the table, and then press Esc once.
 Right-click the table and choose Select Table.
 Drag a marquee around the table: You can use the mouse to drag a marquee (a box)
around the table. This is also called lassoing. When you release the mouse button, every-
thing inside the area is selected.
Editing a Table’s Structure
Now that you’ve created a table, let’s look at some ways to modify the table’s structure, including
resizing the entire table, adding and deleting rows and columns, and merging and splitting cells.
240

Chapter 9: Creating and Formatting Tables
Resizing the Overall Table
As with any other framed object in PowerPoint, dragging the table’s outer frame resizes it. Posi-
tion the mouse pointer over one of the selection handles (the dots on the sides and corners)
so that the mouse pointer becomes a double-headed arrow, and drag to resize the table. See
Figure 9-6.
Note
If you drag when the mouse pointer is over any other part of the frame, so that the mouse pointer becomes
a four-headed arrow, you move the table rather than resize it. ■
FIGURE 9-6
To resize a table, drag a selection handle on its frame.
Corner handle
Side handle
To maintain the aspect ratio (height to width ratio) for the table as you resize it, hold down the
Shift key as you drag a corner of the frame. If maintaining the aspect ratio is not critical, you can
drag either a corner or a side.
All of the rows and columns maintain their spacing proportionally to one another as you resize
them. However, when a table contains text that would no longer ﬁt if its row and column
were shrunken proportionally with the rest of the table, the row height does not shrink fully;
it shrinks as much as it can while still displaying the text. The column width does shrink
proportionally, regardless of cell content.
You can also specify an exact size for the overall table frame by using the Table Size group on
the Layout tab, as shown in Figure 9-7. From there you can enter Height and Width values. To
maintain the aspect ratio, select the Lock Aspect Ratio check box before you change either the
Height or Width settings.
241

Part I: Building Your Presentation
FIGURE 9-7
Set a precise height and width for the table from the Table Size group.
Inserting or Deleting Rows and Columns
Here’s an easy way to create a new row at the bottom of the table: Position the insertion point
in the bottom-right cell and press Tab. Need something more complicated than that? The Layout
tab contains buttons in the Rows & Columns group for inserting rows or columns above, below,
to the left, or to the right of the selected cell(s), as shown in Figure 9-8. By default, each button
inserts a single row or column at a time, but if you select multiple existing ones beforehand,
these commands insert as many as you’ve selected. For example, to insert three new rows, select
three existing rows and then click Insert Above or Insert Below.
FIGURE 9-8
Insert rows or columns by using these buttons on the Layout tab.
Alternatively, you can right-click any existing row or column, point to Insert, and choose one of
the commands on the submenu. These commands are the same as the names of the buttons in
Figure 9-8.
Caution
Adding new rows increases the overall vertical size of the table frame, even to the point where it runs off
the bottom of the slide. You might need to adjust the overall frame size after adding rows. On the other
hand, inserting columns does not change the overall frame size; it simply resizes the existing columns so
that they all ﬁt and are all a uniform size (unless you have manually adjusted any of them to be a custom
size). ■
To delete a row or column (or more than one of each), select the row(s) or column(s) that you
want to delete, and then open the Delete button’s menu on the Layout tab and choose Delete
Rows or Delete Columns.
Note
You cannot insert or delete individual cells in a PowerPoint table. (This is unlike in Excel, where you can
remove individual cells and then shift the remaining ones up or to the left.) ■
242

Chapter 9: Creating and Formatting Tables
Merging and Splitting Cells
If you need more rows or columns in some spots than others, you can use the Merge Cells and
Split Cells commands. Here are some ways to merge cells:
 Click the Eraser button on the Design tab, and then click the line you want to erase. The
cells on either side of the deleted line are merged.
 Select the cells that you want to merge and click Merge Cells on the Layout tab.
 Select the cells to merge, right-click them, and choose Merge Cells.
Here are some ways to split cells:
 Click the Draw Table button on the Design tab, and then drag to draw a line in the middle
of a cell to split it.
 Select the cell that you want to split, right-click it, and choose Split Cells. In the Split Cells
dialog box (see Figure 9-9), select the number of pieces in which to split in each direction,
and click OK.
 Select the cell to split, and then click Split Cells on the Layout tab. In the Split Cells dialog
box (see Figure 9-9), select the number of pieces in which to split in each direction, and
click OK.
FIGURE 9-9
Specify how the split should occur.
Applying Table Styles
The quickest way to format a table attractively is to apply a table style to it. When you insert
a table using any method except drawing it, a table style is applied to it by default; you can
change to some other style if desired, or you can remove all styles from the table, leaving it plain
black-and-white.
When you hover the mouse pointer over a table style, a preview of it appears in the active table.
The style is not actually applied to the table until you click the style to select it, however.
If the style you want appears on the Table Tools Design tab without opening the gallery, you can
click it from there. If not, you can scroll row by row through the gallery by clicking the up/down
arrow buttons, or you can open the gallery’s full menu, as shown in Figure 9-10.
243

Part I: Building Your Presentation
FIGURE 9-10
Apply a table style from the gallery.
To remove all styles from the table, choose Clear Table from the bottom of the gallery menu.
This reverts the table to default settings: no ﬁll, and plain black 1-point borders on all sides of
all cells.
The table styles use theme-based colors, so if you change to a different presentation theme or
color theme, the table formatting might change. (Colors, in particular, are prone to shift.)
By default, the ﬁrst row of the table (a.k.a. the header row) is formatted differently from the oth-
ers, and every other row is shaded differently. (This is called banding.) You can control how
different rows are treated differently (or not) from the Table Style Options group on the Table
Tools Design tab. There is a check box for each of six settings:
 Header row: The ﬁrst row
 Total row: The last row
 First column: The leftmost column
 Last column: The rightmost column
244

Chapter 9: Creating and Formatting Tables
 Banded rows: Every other row formatted differently
 Banded columns: Every other column formatted differently
Caution
With some of the styles, there is not a whole lot of difference between some of the settings. For example,
you might have to look very closely to see the difference between First Column being turned on or off; ditto
with Last Column and Total Row. ■
Tip
You can right-click one of the thumbnails in the Table Style gallery and choose Set as Default to change the
default table style. ■
Formatting Table Cells
Although table styles provide a rough cut on the formatting, you might want to ﬁne-tune your
table formatting as well. In the following sections you learn how to adjust various aspects of the
table’s appearance.
Changing Row Height and Column Width
You might want a row to be a different height or a column a different width than others in the
table. To resize a row or column, follow these steps:
1.
Position the mouse pointer on the border below the row or to the right of the column that
you want to resize. The mouse pointer turns into a line with arrows on each side of it.
2.
Hold down the mouse button as you drag the row or column to a new height or width. A
dotted line appears showing where it will go.
3.
Release the mouse button.
You can also specify an exact height or width measurement using the Height and Width boxes
in the Cell Size group on the Layout tab. Select the row(s) or column(s) to affect, and then enter
sizes in inches or use the increment buttons, as shown in Figure 9-11.
FIGURE 9-11
Set a precise size for a row or column.
Distribute Columns Evenly
Distribute Rows Evenly
The Distribute Rows Evenly and Distribute Columns Evenly buttons in the Cell Size group
(see Figure 9-11) adjust each row or column in the selected range so that the available space
245

Part I: Building Your Presentation
is occupied evenly among them. This is handy especially if you have drawn the table yourself
rather than allowed PowerPoint to create it initially. If PowerPoint creates the table, the rows
and columns are already of equal height and width by default.
You can also double-click between two columns to size the column to the left so that the text ﬁts
exactly within the width.
Table Margins and Alignment
Remember, PowerPoint slides do not have any margins per se; everything is in a frame. An indi-
vidual cell does have internal margins, however.
You can specify the internal margins for cells using the Cell Margins button on the Layout tab,
as follows:
1.
Select the cells to which the setting should apply. To apply settings to the entire table,
select the entire table.
2.
On the Layout tab, click the Cell Margins button. A menu of margin presets opens.
3.
Click one of the presets or choose Custom Margins, and then follow these steps:
a. In the Cell Text Layout dialog box, set the Left, Right, Top, and Bottom margin set-
tings, as shown in Figure 9-12.
b. Click OK.
FIGURE 9-12
You can set the internal margins on an individual cell basis for each side of the cell.
Applying Borders
The border lines around each cell are very important because they separate the data in each cell.
By default (without a table style) there’s a 1-point border around each side of each cell, but you
can make some or all borders thicker, a different line style (dashed, for example), a different
color, or remove them altogether to create your own effects. Here are some ideas:
 To make items appear to ‘‘ﬂoat’’ in multiple columns on the slide (that is, to make it look
as if they are not really in a table at all — just lined up extremely well), remove all table
borders.
246

Chapter 9: Creating and Formatting Tables
 To create a header row at the top without using the Quick Style Options, make the border
beneath the ﬁrst row of cells darker or thicker than the others.
 To make certain rows or columns appear as if they are outside of the table, turn off their
borders on all sides except the side that faces the other cells.
 To make certain items appear as if they have been crossed off a list, format those cells with
diagonal borders. This creates the effect of an X running through each cell. These diagonal
lines are not really borders in the sense that they don’t go around the edge of the cell, but
they’re treated as borders in PowerPoint.
When you apply a top, bottom, left, or right border, those positions refer to the entire selected
block of cells if you have more than one cell selected. For example, suppose you select two adja-
cent cells in a row and apply a left border. The border applies only to the leftmost of the two
cells. If you want the same border applied to the line between the cells too, you must apply an
inside vertical border.
To apply a border, follow these steps:
1.
Select the cell(s) that you want to affect.
2.
In the Draw Borders group on the Table Tools Design tab, select a line style, width,
and color from the Pen Style, Pen Weight, and Pen Color drop-down lists, as shown in
Figure 9-13.
FIGURE 9-13
Use the Draw Borders group’s lists to set the border’s style, thickness, and color.
Pen weight
Pen style
Pen color
Tip
Try to use theme colors rather than ﬁxed colors whenever possible, so that if you change to a different color
theme later, the colors you choose now won’t clash. ■
3.
Open the Borders button’s menu in the Table Styles group and choose the sides of the
selected area to which the new settings should apply. See Figure 9-14. For example, to
apply the border to the bottom of the selected area, click Bottom Border.
If you want to remove all borders from all sides, choose No Border from the menu.
4.
If necessary, repeat step 3 to apply the border to other sides of the selection. Some of the
choices on the Borders button’s menu apply to only one side; others apply to two or more
at once.
247

Part I: Building Your Presentation
FIGURE 9-14
Select the side(s) to apply borders to the chosen cells.
Applying Fills
By default, table cells have a transparent background so that the color of the slide beneath shows
through. When you apply a table style, as you learned earlier in the chapter, the style speciﬁes
a background color — or in some cases, multiple background colors depending on the options
you choose for special treatment of certain rows or columns.
You can also manually change the ﬁll for a table to make it either a solid color or a special ﬁll
effect. You can apply this ﬁll to individual cells, or you can apply a background ﬁll for the entire
table.
Filling Individual Cells
Each individual cell has its own ﬁll setting; in this way a table is like a collection of individual
object frames, rather than a single object. To set the ﬁll color for one or more cells, follow these
steps:
1.
Select the cell(s) to affect, or to apply the same ﬁll color to all cells, select the table’s outer
frame.
2.
On the Table Tools Design tab, click the down arrow next to the Shading button to open
its palette.
3.
Select the desired color or ﬁll effect. See Figure 9-15.
Cross-Reference
For more on the various effects, see Chapter 10. Also see ‘‘Filling a Table with a Picture’’ later in this
chapter for some issues involving picture ﬁlls speciﬁc to tables. ■
248

Chapter 9: Creating and Formatting Tables
FIGURE 9-15
Apply a ﬁll effect to the selected cell(s).
Tip
For a semi-transparent, solid-color ﬁll, ﬁrst apply the ﬁll and then right-click the cell and choose Format
Shape. In the Format Shape dialog box, drag the Transparency slider. For some types of ﬁlls, you can also
set the transparency when you initially apply the ﬁll. ■
Applying an Overall Table Fill
You can apply a solid color ﬁll to the entire table that is different from the ﬁll applied to the
individual cells. The table’s ﬁll color is visible only in cells in which the individual ﬁll is set to
No Fill (or a semi-transparent ﬁll, in which case it blends).
To apply a ﬁll to the entire table, open the Shading button’s menu and point to Table Back-
ground, and then choose a color, as shown in Figure 9-16.
To test the new background, select some cells and choose No Fill for their ﬁll color. The
background color appears in those cells. If you want to experiment further, try applying a
semi-transparent ﬁll to some cells, and see how the color of the background blends with the
color of the cell’s ﬁll.
Filling a Table with a Picture
When you ﬁll one or more cells with a picture, each cell gets its own individual copy of it.
For example, if you ﬁll a table with a picture of a koala, and the table has six cells, you get six
koalas, as shown in Figure 9-17.
If you want a single copy of the picture to ﬁll the entire area behind the table, there several ways
you can do this.
249

Part I: Building Your Presentation
FIGURE 9-16
Apply a ﬁll to the table’s background.
FIGURE 9-17
When you apply a picture ﬁll to a table, each cell gets its own copy.
250

Chapter 9: Creating and Formatting Tables
One is to set the picture to be tiled like a texture. Follow these steps:
1.
Select the cells, and then right-click the selection and choose Format Shape.
2.
Click Fill, and then click Picture or Texture Fill.
3.
Click the File button, select the picture ﬁle, and click Insert.
4.
Select the Tile Picture as Texture check box, as shown in Figure 9-18.
FIGURE 9-18
Set the picture to be tiled as a texture.
Another way to do this is to choose a picture ﬁll from the Shading options for the table. To do
that:
1.
Select the cell(s) you want to affect.
2.
Choose Design ➪Shading ➪Picture. The Insert Picture dialog box opens.
3.
Click Insert. The picture is inserted in the table cell.
At this point, the picture ﬁlls the table without regard for cell borders, but it probably doesn’t ﬁll
it exactly. Depending on the original size of the graphic and the size of the table, you probably
either see a truncated version of the picture or a tiled version that does not match up with the
cell borders. Figure 9-19 shows an example of a picture that is too large.
251

Part I: Building Your Presentation
FIGURE 9-19
This picture is too large for the table ﬁll.
To adjust the picture, use the Tiling Options in the Format Shape dialog box, as shown in
Figure 9-18:
 Adjust the position of the picture within the table by changing the Offset X and Offset
Y values. These are measured in points, and move the picture to the right (X) and
down (Y).
 Change the sizing of the picture by adjusting the Scale X and Scale Y values. The smaller
the number, the smaller the picture — but don’t go too small or the picture will start to tile
(unless that’s what you want, of course).
 Change the way the picture aligns in the table by changing the Alignment.
 (Optional) Set a mirror type if desired so that if you do have multiple copies tiled within
the frame, each copy is ﬂipped horizontally and/or vertically. (This is not common.)
It can take some time to get the picture optimally adjusted so that it exactly ﬁts in the allotted
space. Figure 9-20 shows an example.
If all of that seems like more than you want to mess with, there is an alternative method: Make
the table transparent and place the picture behind it on the slide. Here’s how:
1.
Place the picture on the slide by choosing Insert ➪Picture.
2.
Select the picture and choose Format ➪Send to Back. (If the picture is the only object on
the slide, this command is unavailable, but the command is unnecessary in that case.)
3.
Create a plain unformatted table on top of the picture.
4.
Set the table’s ﬁll to No Fill if it is not already transparent.
252

Chapter 9: Creating and Formatting Tables
FIGURE 9-20
The picture now ﬁlls the table background as a single copy.
5.
Resize the table and the picture as needed so they are both the same size. You might need
to crop the picture to keep the right aspect ratio.
Applying a Shadow to a Table
You can apply a shadow effect to a table so that it appears ‘‘raised’’ off the slide background. You
can make it any color you like, and adjust a variety of settings for it.
Note
If the cells have no ﬁll, the shadow will apply to the gridlines, not to the table as a whole object. ■
Here’s a very simple way to apply a shadow to a table:
1.
Select the table’s outer frame.
2.
Choose Table Tools Design ➪Effects ➪Shadow.
3.
Click the shadow type you want.
Here’s an alternative method that gives a bit more control:
1.
Select the table’s outer frame, and then right-click the frame and choose Format Shape.
2.
Click Shadow, and then choose a preset and a color, as shown in Figure 9-21.
3.
(Optional) If desired, drag any of the sliders to ﬁne-tune the shadow. These are covered in
greater detail in Chapter 10.
4.
Click Close to close the Format Shape dialog box when you are ﬁnished.

Applying a 3-D Effect to a Table
PowerPoint does not enable you to apply 3-D effects to tables, so you have to fudge that by cre-
ating the 3-D effect with rectangles and then overlaying a transparent table on top of the shapes.
As you can see in Figure 9-22, it’s a pretty convincing facsimile.
FIGURE 9-22

You might need to read Chapter 10 ﬁrst to do some of these steps, but here’s the basic proce-
dure:
1.
Create a rectangle from the Shapes group on the Insert tab, and apply a 3-D effect to
it (from the Drawing Tools Format tab’s Shape Effect ➪3-D Rotation). Use any effect
254

Chapter 9: Creating and Formatting Tables
you like. To create the traditional ‘‘box’’ appearance as in Figure 9-22, apply the second
Oblique preset and then in the 3-D Format options, increase the Depth setting to about
100 points.
2.
Size the rectangle so that its face is the same size as the table.
3.
On the Drawing Tools Format tab, choose Send Backward ➪Send to Back to send the
rectangle behind the table.
4.
Set the table’s ﬁll to No Fill if it is not already transparent.
5.
(Optional) Set the table’s outer frame border to None to make its edges appear to blend
with the edges of the rectangle. To do that, open the Borders button’s menu on the Table
Tools Design tab and select Outside Border to toggle that off.
Changing Text Alignment
If you followed the preceding steps to create the effect shown in Figure 9-22, you probably ran
into a problem: Your text probably didn’t center itself in the cells. That’s because, by default,
each cell’s vertical alignment is set to Top, and horizontal alignment is set to Left.
Although the vertical and horizontal alignments are both controlled from the Alignment group
on the Layout tab, they actually have two different scopes. Vertical alignment applies to the
entire cell as a whole, whereas horizontal alignment can apply differently to individual para-
graphs within the cell. To set vertical alignment for a cell, follow these steps:
1.
Select one or more cells to affect. To affect only one cell, you do not have to select it; just
click inside it.
2.
On the Layout tab, in the Alignment group, click one of the vertical alignment buttons:
Align Top, Center Vertically, or Align Bottom. See Figure 9-23.
FIGURE 9-23
Set the vertical and horizontal alignment of text from the Alignment group.
Vertical alignment
Horizontal alignment
To set the horizontal alignment for a paragraph, follow these steps:
1.
Select one or more paragraphs to affect. If you select multiple cells, all paragraphs within
those cells are affected. If you click in a cell without selecting anything, the change only
affects the paragraph in which you clicked.
255

Part I: Building Your Presentation
2.
On the Layout tab, in the Alignment group, click one of the horizontal alignment but-
tons: Align Left, Center, or Align Right. See Figure 9-23. You can also use the paragraph
alignment buttons on the Home tab for horizontal alignment, or the buttons on the mini
toolbar.
Tip
The horizontal alignments all have keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+L for left, Ctrl+E for center, and Ctrl+R for
right. ■
Changing Text Direction
The default text direction for table cells is Horizontal, which reads from left to right (at least in
countries where that’s how text is read). Figure 9-24 shows the alternatives.
FIGURE 9-24
You can set types of text direction.
To change the text direction for a cell, follow these steps:
1.
Select the cell(s) to affect. To affect only a single cell, move the insertion point into it.
2.
On the Layout tab, click Text Direction.
3.
Select a text direction from the menu that appears.
Note
You cannot set text direction for individual paragraphs; the setting applies to the entire cell. ■
Using Tables from Word
If a table already exists in Word, you can copy it into PowerPoint. PowerPoint will convert the
Word table to a PowerPoint table. From that point on, it is a part of the presentation, and main-
tains no relationship to Word. You can edit its text directly in PowerPoint.
256

Chapter 9: Creating and Formatting Tables
To paste a table from Word to PowerPoint, copy it to the Clipboard (Ctrl+C) in Word, and then
paste it onto a slide in PowerPoint (Ctrl+V). The resulting table appears in the center of the
slide.
Note
You might need to increase the font size; Word’s default size for body text is great for printed documents,
but too small for most PowerPoint slides. ■
A pasted Word table is placed into a content placeholder on the slide if an appropriate one is
available. Here are the basic rules for what goes on:
 If the slide has an appropriate content placeholder that is empty, the table is placed into it
but retains its own size and shape.
 If the slide does not have an appropriate empty content placeholder, the table is inserted as
a free-ﬂoating object, unrelated to any placeholders.
Word’s table feature is somewhat more robust than PowerPoint’s. If you want to maintain all the
Word capabilities in the table, paste the table as a Word object instead of doing a regular paste.
Follow these steps:
1.
Copy the table in Word (Ctrl+C).
2.
In PowerPoint, display the slide on which the table should be pasted.
3.
On the Home tab, open the Paste button’s menu and click Paste Special. The Paste Special
dialog box opens.
4.
Click the Paste option button.
5.
In the As list, choose Microsoft Ofﬁce Word Document Object.
6.
Click OK. The table appears as a free-ﬂoating object (not in any placeholder).
You can also use the Paste Options button that appears immediately after you paste the table.
Click the third icon: Embed.
The resulting table is an embedded object, and cannot be edited directly using PowerPoint’s table
feature. To edit the object, you must double-click it to open it in Word.
Tip
To maintain a dynamic link between the Word ﬁle and the PowerPoint presentation, choose Paste Link
instead of Paste in step 4. However, be aware that if you move the Word ﬁle, an error will appear in
PowerPoint when it cannot ﬁnd the ﬁle referenced in the link. See Chapter 15 for more information about
linking and embedding. ■
Integrating Excel Cells into PowerPoint
If you need the calculating capabilities in a table, consider embedding Excel cells into the slide
instead of using a traditional PowerPoint table.
257

Part I: Building Your Presentation
Object linking and embedding is covered in detail in Chapter 15, but here’s a quick look at how
to use Excel from within PowerPoint:
1.
Display the slide on which you want to place the Excel table.
2.
If desired, select a placeholder into which the table should be placed.
3.
On the Insert tab, click the Table button, and on its menu, choose Excel Spreadsheet. A
small frame with a few cells of an Excel spreadsheet appears, and the Ribbon changes to
the tabs and tools for Excel. See Figure 9-25.
FIGURE 9-25

Note
Don’t worry that the object does not seem to be correctly aligned at the top and left. The cell row and
column labels appear as you edit, and they disappear when you click away from the object. ■
4.
If desired, enlarge the Excel object by doing the following:
a. Click once on the Excel object’s border to select it. Black selection handles appear
around it.
b. Drag a corner selection handle to enlarge the area of the object.
5.
Create the table using Excel’s tools and features.
6.
(Optional) If there are unused cells, resize the object again (using its selection handles) so
that they are not visible.
7.
Click away from the object to deselect it and return to PowerPoint.
You’ve just created an embedded Excel object. It does not exist outside of this PowerPoint ﬁle;
it’s a mini-Excel spreadsheet that you use just for this one presentation. If you want to embed

content from an existing Excel ﬁle, copy and paste it as in the earlier section on Word tables, or
see Chapter 15 for more information about your options for linking and embedding content.
Summary
In this chapter, you learned the ins and outs of creating and formatting tables in PowerPoint
including how to insert, draw, move, and resize the various cells of a table as well as how to add
ﬁlls, styles, and effects. You also learned how to integrate Excel cells into your PowerPoint slides.
In the next chapter, you learn how to draw and format objects.

E
verything on a slide is a separate object. An object is anything that is
in its own rectangular frame and can be moved, sized, and format-
ted independently. For example, each drawn shape is an object, as
is each text box and each chart, diagram, and clip art image. So far in this
book, you’ve learned about several types of objects that you can format with
borders, shading, and other special effects, including text boxes and tables.
In upcoming chapters, you learn about even more types of objects that you
can format, such as SmartArt, charts, and clip art.
Most of the manipulation that you can apply to an object is the same,
regardless of the object type. Rather than repeat the details for formatting
each object type in individual chapters, almost everything you need to know
about object formatting can be found in this chapter. You will practice these
techniques on drawn lines and shapes, and in the process you will learn
about the drawing tools. You can then apply these same techniques to text
boxes and to virtually every type of graphic object that PowerPoint supports.
Working with the Drawing Tools
PowerPoint comes with a set of drawing tools that allow you to create simple
lines and shapes on your slides. These used to be referred to as AutoShapes
in Ofﬁce 2003 and earlier, but now they are simply called shapes. (Lines are
also called shapes, which seems counterintuitive, but there it is.)
About Vector Graphics
The drawing tools create simple, line-based vector graphics, each of which is a
separate object on the slide. For example, if you make a drawing that consists
of four rectangles, an oval, and several lines, you can move and resize each of
263

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
these objects separately. You can stack them to create a more complex drawing, format each one
individually, and even group them to create a single object that you can format, move, and resize
as a single unit.
A vector graphic is one that is based on a mathematical formula, such as in geometry class. For
example, if you draw a vector graphic line, PowerPoint stores the line start point, line end point,
and line properties (width, color, and so on) as numeric values. When you move or resize the
line, PowerPoint updates these numbers. Most clip-art images are also vector graphics. In con-
trast, a scanned image or a photo is a bitmap graphic, in which each individual colored pixel is
represented by a separate numeric value. This is why bitmap ﬁles are so much larger than vector
ﬁles — because there are more values to track.
The most important advantages of using vector graphics are:
 Size. Vector graphics ﬁles do not require much storage space because not every pixel of
the image needs to be represented numerically.
 Scalability. When you resize a vector graphic, the math is recalculated and the shape is
redrawn. This means that the picture is never distorted and its lines never become jagged
the way bitmap graphics do.
The main drawback to vector graphics is their lack of realism. No matter how good an artist you
are, a vector graphic will always have a ﬂat, cartoonish quality to it.
Note
3-D graphics programs such as AutoCAD are also based on vector graphics. They start out with a wireframe
image of a 3-D object (such as a cube), combine it with other wireframe images to make an object, and
then use a rendering tool to cover the wireframe with a color, pattern, or texture that makes it look like a
real object. Most computer games also use vector graphics. ■
Drawing Lines and Shapes
The drawing tools in PowerPoint are the same as in other Ofﬁce applications. For example, Word
and Excel both have identical tool sets. The Shapes button appears on the Insert tab, and you
can click it to open a menu of the available shapes, as shown in Figure 10-1.
To draw a shape, follow these steps:
1.
Select the desired shape from the Shapes palette (Figure 10-1).
2.
(Optional) To constrain the dimensions of the shape — for example, to force a rectangle
to be a square — hold down the Shift key.
3.
Drag to draw the shape. A silhouette of the shape appears as you drag. Release the mouse
button when you have the shape you want.
The preceding steps work well for most shapes, but there are a few special cases in which the
drawing process works a little differently. The following sections explain these differences.
264

Chapter 10: Drawing and Formatting Objects
FIGURE 10-1
Select a shape from the Shapes list.
Tip
You can resize the Shapes menu by dragging its bottom-right corner. ■
Tip
More shapes are available through the Clip Organizer. When searching for clip-art images (see Chapter 12),
use AutoShape as the keyword; you will see many more shapes, including ones that look like various types
of ofﬁce furniture and computers (which are useful in ofﬁce plans). ■
265

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Tip
To draw multiple objects of the same shape, you can lock the drawing tool on. Instead of clicking the
shape to select it in the Shapes gallery, right-click it and choose Lock Shape. It then stays on until you press
Esc to turn it off. ■
Straight or Curved Lines
The drawing tools include several types of lines, as shown in Figure 10-2. Here are some tips for
using some of the line tools:
 Straight line: Click the start point and then click the end point. The line is now complete
and the tool turns off. You can also draw lines with arrows at one or both ends.
 Straight (elbow) connector: Click and hold at the start point, and then drag to the end
point. You can adjust the position of the elbow by dragging the yellow diamond in the
center. If you click and release at the start point, a default size connector appears, which
you can then move or resize. You can also draw lines with arrows at one or both ends.
 Curved connector: Click and hold at the start point, and then drag to the end point. Click
a second time to complete the line. You can adjust the shape of the curve by dragging the
yellow diamond in the center. If you click and release at the start point, a default size con-
nector appears, which you can then move or resize. You can also draw lines with arrows at
one or both ends.
 Curve: This is a freeform, multi-segment curve. Click the start point, click again to create
a second point, and then click again to create more points. Between points, drag the mouse
pointer to adjust the curve. When you are ﬁnished, double-click the mouse.
 Scribble: This is a freeform line. Hold down the mouse button and drag to draw; release
the mouse button to ﬁnish.

Freeform Polygons
A polygon is a shape that consists of line segments. For example, stars, rectangles, triangles, and
pentagons are all polygons. The lines do not need to be the same length or at any particular
angle. The Freeform Polygon tool is in the Lines group (Figure 10-2), but it actually draws poly-
gons. It enables you to draw each line segment one by one, with the mouse pointer functioning
as a pencil. To use this tool, follow these steps:
266

Chapter 10: Drawing and Formatting Objects
1.
Open the Shapes palette and click the Freeform button.
2.
Click to place the start point, and then release the mouse button.
3.
Click another location to place the next point. A line appears between the two points.
Repeat this step as needed to create more points.
4.
End the shape:
 For an open shape, double-click where you want to place the ﬁnal point.
 For a closed shape, click the start point again as the ﬁnal point.
You can ﬁne-tune a freeform polygon by adjusting its points. You can also convert existing
shapes to freeform polygons, which you can then adjust point by point.
Cross-Reference
See the section ‘‘Editing a Shape’s Points’’ in this chapter for more information. ■
Flow-Chart Connectors
Flow-chart shapes are just ordinary shapes that happen to correspond to those used in stan-
dard ﬂow charts.
To experiment with ﬂow-chart connectors, draw a couple of shapes (any closed shapes) and then
draw a straight line between them. As you move the mouse pointer over the edge of a shape,
certain selection handles glow red. If you click and drag from one of these handles to the other
shape, the line becomes anchored to that shape. When you move the mouse to the second shape,
once again, certain selection handles glow red. Click one of the red glowing handles to anchor
the other end of the line there. Then delete the line and try an elbow connector; they work the
same way. Figure 10-3 shows one.
FIGURE 10-3
Flow-chart connectors have red balls on the ends when they are connected.
When you select the line, both of the selection handles at the ends appear red, indicating that
they are connected. If either end of the line is pale blue instead, this means that the end is not
secured to a shape.
267

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Connecting a line to a shape offers two advantages. One advantage is that you don’t have to
adjust the line exactly so that it touches the shape but does not overlap it. It lines up perfectly
with the edge of the shape at all times. Another advantage is that if you move the shape, the
line moves with it, changing its length and angle as needed so that the line remains anchored at
both ends.
Callouts
A callout is a regular shape except it has a resizable point on it that can be dragged to point to
other objects. Drag the yellow diamond on the callout shape to move its point.
Action Buttons
An action button is a type of drawing object that has an action associated with it. When users
click the action button during the presentation, something happens. For example, perhaps a cer-
tain slide appears, an external program launches, or a sound plays.
The main difference between placing an action button and placing other types of drawing objects
is that after you draw the action button, a dialog box appears, prompting you for the action.
Cross-Reference
You can learn how to use the action button dialog box in Chapter 21. ■
Choosing a Different Shape
If you chose the wrong shape to draw, it’s easier to just delete the shape and start over if you
have not applied any special formatting to it. However, if you have formatted the shape already,
you might ﬁnd it easier to change the shape rather than recreate it. To do so, follow these steps:
1.
Click the shape to select it.
2.
Click the Drawing Tools Format ➪Edit Shape button, and choose Change Shape from
the menu. The same palette of shapes appears as when you initially created the shape, as
shown in Figure 10-4.
3.
Click the new shape that you want.
Note
Lines cannot be changed in this manner. You must right-click them to change their type, and you can only
change to an elbow connector or a curved connector. ■
Editing a Shape’s Points
Each shape consists of a series of points that are connected with straight or curved lines. On a
freeform shape, you can adjust the positions of these points to change the shape of the object.
First, you need to convert the shape to freeform:
268

Chapter 10: Drawing and Formatting Objects
1.
Select the shape.
2.
On the Drawing Tools Format tab, open the Edit Shape drop-down menu (see
Figure 10-4) and select Edit Points.
You can also right-click the shape and choose Edit Points.
FIGURE 10-4
Use the Change Shape option in the Edit Shape drop-down menu to reselect a shape.
3.
Drag one or more of the selection handles (see Figure 10-5) to change the shape.
4.
Click away from the shape or press Esc.
Tip
Here’s a tip for combining multiple drawn shapes in interesting ways. Add the following commands to the
Ribbon or the Quick Access toolbar, as described in Chapter 24: Shape Combine, Shape Intersect, Shape
Subtract, and Shape Union. Each of these joins multiple shapes in a certain way. For example, Shape Union
combines two drawn shapes into a single shape. Draw a couple of shapes, overlap them slightly, select
them, and then play with these commands on your own to see how the commands work. ■
269

Adding Text to a Shape
You can use almost all of the closed shapes in PowerPoint as text boxes. PowerPoint recognizes
a manually created text box as a variation on a rectangle with some text in it. As a result, you
can just as easily place text in a shape of any other type. To add text to a shape, follow these
steps:
1.
Select the shape. (This is necessary to make the Drawing Tools Format tab available.)
2.
On the Drawing Tools Format tab, in the Insert Shapes group, click the Text Box button.
3.
Click inside the shape. A ﬂashing insertion point appears inside the shape. Instead of
steps 2 and 3, you can just click the shape and start typing if you prefer.
4.
Type the desired text.
Tip
You can also use the Text Box button to insert a new blank text box from the Drawing Tools Format tab,
independent of any existing shape. Instead of clicking inside a shape in step 3, click a blank area of the slide
and begin typing to create a new text box. A text box is just a rectangular shape with no border or ﬁll. You
can change it to a different shape by selecting from the Edit Shape ➪Change Shape menu, as shown in the
section ‘‘Choosing a Different Shape,’’ earlier in this chapter. You can then apply a shape style, as explained
in the section ‘‘Applying Shape or Picture Styles’’ later in this chapter, or apply a custom border or
ﬁll to it. ■
Text wraps within a shape automatically, in a rectangular area. If the shape is irregular, Power-
Point ﬁnds the largest available rectangular area within its center and conﬁnes the text to that
area. If you have converted a shape to freeform and adjusted its points, the text wrapping inside
the shape may not look right. For example, in Figure 10-6, the sides of the arrow have been
pulled in a bit manually, but the original text area still applies, resulting in some overhang of
the text. To correct this, you can manually insert line breaks where you want them by pressing
Shift+Enter.
270

Chapter 10: Drawing and Formatting Objects
FIGURE 10-6
If the text overﬂows the shape (left), press Shift+Enter to insert line breaks where needed (right).
Selecting Objects
No matter what type of object you are dealing with, you can select it by clicking it with the
mouse. Selection handles that look like pale blue circles appear around the object, as shown in
Figure 10-7.
FIGURE 10-7
Selection handles appear around a selected object.
You have already learned that you can select a single object by clicking it. However, sometimes
you might want to select multiple objects so that you can act upon them as a single unit. For
example, suppose you have drawn several shapes, and you want to select them as a group so
that you can move them or apply the same formatting to them.
To select more than one object, click the ﬁrst one to select it, and then hold down the Shift key
as you click additional objects. They all become selected.
Tip
Holding down the Ctrl key when you select multiple objects also does the same thing as Shift; however, if
you hold down the Ctrl key and drag, it makes a copy of the original item. This is why it’s better to use the
Shift key than the Ctrl key for selecting multiple objects — so that you don’t accidentally make copies by
dragging the item. ■
271

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
If you can’t easily click each object (perhaps because they are overlapping one another), an easy
way to select a whole group is to drag the cursor around them. For example, if you wanted to
select several stacked shapes, you would drag the cursor over them to select them all, as follows:
Simply click and hold down the mouse button above and to the left of the objects, and drag
down and to the right until you create a box around them. The box adds a light-blue shading
over the top of the area, as shown in Figure 10-8. Then, release the mouse button. All objects
that were entirely inside the boundary that you drew are selected, as shown in Figure 10-9.
FIGURE 10-8
Hold down the mouse button and drag a box that includes all of the shapes that you want to select.
FIGURE 10-9
Each selected object displays its own selection handles.
Note
Dragging from the top-left to the bottom-right is just one way of selecting the group; for example, you can
also drag from the lower-right to the upper-left if you prefer. ■
272

Chapter 10: Drawing and Formatting Objects
Another way to select objects is with the Selection and Visibility pane. To display this pane,
from the Home tab, choose Select ➪Selection Pane. In the Selection and Visibility pane, you
can click any object’s name to select it, or hold down the Ctrl key and click multiple objects to
select them. Figure 10-10 shows three selected objects.
FIGURE 10-10
The Selection and Visibility pane assists you in selecting objects.
The Selection and Visibility pane does more than just select objects. For example, you can use
the Re-order arrow buttons at the bottom of the pane to change the stacking order of objects,
which is covered later in this chapter. You can also click the eye icon next to an object to toggle
its display on or off in the slide. This provides a way of temporarily hiding an object without
affecting its presence or position on the slide.
Tip
If you have more than one of a certain type of object, PowerPoint names them generically in the Selection
and Visibility pane — for example, Oval 4, Rectangle 2, and so on. It is easier to keep track of which shape
is which if you change their names to something more meaningful. To change the name of an object, click
its name in the Selection and Visibility pane, and then click it again. The insertion point appears inside the
name, and you can edit it. Having recognizable names for objects also helps when you are sequencing their
animation. ■
273

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Deleting Objects
To delete an object, the easiest way is to select it and then press the Delete key on the key-
board. To delete more than one object at once, you can select multiple objects before pressing
the Delete key.
You can also right-click the selected object or objects and choose Cut. When you cut an object,
it is not the same as deleting it; the Cut command moves the object to the Clipboard, so that
you can use the Paste command to place it somewhere else. However, if you cut something, and
then never paste it, this is actually the same as deleting it.
Moving and Copying Objects
You can move or copy objects anywhere you like: within a single slide, from one slide to
another, or from one presentation to another. You can even copy or move an object to a
completely different program, such as Word or Excel.
Within a Slide
To move an object on a slide, you can simply drag it with the mouse. Just position the mouse
pointer over any part of the object except for a handle. When the mouse pointer changes to a
four-headed arrow, drag the object to a new location. A pale version appears to show the object’s
new location, as shown in Figure 10-11.
FIGURE 10-11
Drag an object on the slide to reposition it.
Tip
Holding down the Shift key as you drag constrains the movement of the object, making it possible to drag
it only horizontally or only vertically. Holding down the Ctrl key as you drag makes a copy of the original
object. ■
To copy an object on a slide, use the Copy command. Select the object and press Ctrl+C to
copy it, or click the Copy button on the Home tab. Then, press Ctrl+V to paste the object, or
click the Paste button on the Home tab. You can then drag the copy to wherever you want it on
the slide.
274

Chapter 10: Drawing and Formatting Objects
Note
Whenever you need to cut, copy, or paste, you have a variety of methods to choose from. There are the
Cut, Copy, and Paste buttons on the Home tab, the Cut, Copy, and Paste commands on the right-click
menu, and the shortcut key combinations, Cut (Ctrl+X), Copy (Ctrl+C), and Paste (Ctrl+V). ■
Tip
Ctrl+D works as a combination Copy-and-Paste command by automatically duplicating the object or objects
that you have selected. ■
From One Slide to Another
To move an object to a different slide, cutting and pasting works best. Select the object and press
Ctrl+X, or click Cut on the Home tab. Then display the slide on which you want the object to
appear, and press Ctrl+V, or click Paste on the Home tab.
To copy an object to a different slide without removing it from the original slide, you can do the
same thing, except that you need to use the Copy command (Ctrl+C or Copy button) instead of
the Cut command.
Note
If you want an object to appear in the same spot on every slide in the presentation, add the object to the
slide master rather than trying to copy it onto every slide. See Chapter 5 for more information. ■
Tip
When you copy and paste an object onto the same slide, the copy is offset from the original to allow for
easy selection. When you copy and paste an object onto a different slide, the copy appears in the same
position as the original. ■
From One Presentation to Another
To move or copy from one presentation to another, use Cut, Copy, and Paste commands. First,
select the object, and then cut or copy it. Display the destination slide (in normal view) in the
other presentation, and then paste.
Tip
An object that you move or copy to a different presentation might change its color because the destination
ﬁle is using a different color theme. This is because objects that have their colors deﬁned by a color theme
rather than by a ﬁxed color will change colors when you apply a different theme or template. ■
To Another Program
You can also move and copy objects from PowerPoint into other programs. For example, sup-
pose that you have created a table on a slide and you want to include it in a report in Word.
You can move or copy it to a Word document by cutting and pasting. For more information on
tables, see Chapter 9.
275

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Tip
Depending on the object and the destination application, copying and pasting usually results in smaller ﬁle
sizes than dragging and dropping. ■
Using the Ofﬁce Clipboard
The Microsoft Ofﬁce Clipboard lets you store more than one object at a time. You can copy or
cut multiple objects to the Clipboard and then paste them all into the same or different loca-
tions afterward. To use the Clipboard in multi-clip mode, click the dialog box launcher for the
Clipboard group on the Home tab. The Clipboard pane appears, as shown in Figure 10-12.
FIGURE 10-12

As you copy or cut items, they appear on a list in the Clipboard pane. When you want to paste
an item, display the slide on which you want to paste it — position the insertion point at the

Chapter 10: Drawing and Formatting Objects
desired location if the item is text — and then click the item in the Clipboard pane. The Clip-
board can hold up to 24 items. To remove an item, click the drop-down arrow next to it, and
choose Delete, as shown in Figure 10-12.
Tip
Click the Options button at the bottom of the Clipboard pane to display a list of on/off toggles that you can
set for Clipboard operation. For example, you can specify that the Clipboard pane appears automatically
when you press Ctrl+C twice in a row, and whether it displays an icon at the bottom of the screen when it
is active. ■
Understanding Object Formatting
Up until this point, we’ve considered all objects to be equal, but there are actually two major
classes of objects that PowerPoint supports: those that you create from within PowerPoint, and
those that you import from other sources. Each object type causes a different version of the For-
mat tab to display when you select it.
For drawn shapes, charts, SmartArt, and text boxes, the Drawing Tools Format tab in
Figure 10-13 appears. From here you can apply shape styles, as well as WordArt formatting, to
the text within the object.
FIGURE 10-13
For drawn objects, charts, and text boxes, these formatting options are available.
Note
SmartArt has some formatting features in common with drawn shapes and charts, but it also has some spe-
cial features and quirks of its own. For more information, see Chapter 11. ■
For photos and clip art, the Picture Tools Format tab in Figure 10-14 appears. It focuses on
applying ﬁlters through which you view the image (such as brightness and contrast), and apply-
ing Picture Styles that affect the shape and border of the frame.
Both of these versions of the Format tab (Drawing Tools and Picture Tools) have Size and
Arrange groups that work the same way.
The following sections explain how to apply formatting to the two types of objects, by using
the Drawing Tools Format tab or the Picture Tools Format tab. Some features are unique to one
object type or the other; other features can be used for both types, although some features that
do basically the same thing have different names, depending on the object type.
277

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
FIGURE 10-14
For photos and clip art, these formatting options are available.
Resizing Objects
Let’s start with something that all objects have in common: resizing. You can resize any object
on a slide, either by dragging a selection handle on its border or by using the Size group in the
Format tab.
In Chapter 4, you learned how to resize a text box; you can resize any object in this same way,
simply by dragging a corner or side selection handle to change the object’s size and shape. The
mouse pointer changes to a double-headed arrow when you move it over a selection handle. As
you resize the object, a faint shadow of the object appears to show its new size.
Tip
Some objects, such as photos, maintain their aspect ratio by default when you resize them using a corner
selection handle. In other words, the ratio of height to width does not change when you resize using the
corner selection handles. If you want to distort the object by changing its aspect ratio, drag one of the side
selection handles instead of a corner one. Other objects, such as drawn shapes, do not maintain the aspect
ratio unless you hold down the Shift key as you drag a corner selection handle. ■
You can also size an object by using the increment buttons to change the values in the Size
group on the Format tab, or by typing numbers directly into these text boxes.
Alternatively, you can click the dialog box launcher for the Size group to open a Format Pic-
ture (or Format Object) dialog box with the Size tab displayed, from which you can enter a
height and width, the same as you would in the Size group on the ribbon (see Figure 10-15).
This same dialog box is available for all object types, although more of the options are available
for photos than for drawn objects. Figure 10-15 shows the dialog box for a photo. For a drawn
object, some of the Scale options are unavailable, as well as the Crop From and Original Size
sections.
An advantage of using the Format Picture (or Format Shape) dialog box is that you can adjust
the scale of the object by a percentage. For example, you can shrink the object to 45 percent
of its original size by changing its Height and Width values in the Scale section to 45 percent
each. This feature is more useful for photos than for drawn objects, but it works for all object
types.
278

Chapter 10: Drawing and Formatting Objects
FIGURE 10-15

For imported objects only — such as pictures, clip art, and so on — you can also set these scale
options:
 Relative to Original Picture Size: The measurements in the Scale section refer to the
original picture size if you select this option; otherwise, they refer to the previous size of
the picture.
 Best Scale for Slide Show: When you select this option, PowerPoint adjusts the picture
size to match the resolution at which you show the presentation, as you have speciﬁed in
the Resolution drop-down list.
Cross-Reference
The Crop From options are available only for imported objects such as photos, and are covered in
Chapter 13. ■
279

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
The Original Size section is also available only for imported objects. You can click the Reset
Picture button in this section to reset the object back to the size that it was when you initially
placed it on the slide.
Arranging Objects
Arranging is another action that you can perform with all object types. For example, you can
specify an object’s position in relation to the slide or to other objects, change the stacking order,
rotate the object, group it with other objects, and much more.
Rotating and Flipping Objects
Most objects display a green circle at the top when you select them; this is called the rotation
handle. You can drag it to rotate the object, as shown in Figure 10-16. This action is called
free rotation because there is no precise numeric measurement that is related to the amount of
rotation, although, by holding down the Shift key while rotating, you can rotate the object by
15-degree increments.
FIGURE 10-16
Rotate an object by dragging its rotation handle.
Rotation handle

while dragging
You can also rotate an object by exactly 90 degrees. To do so, click the Rotate button on the
Format tab and select Rotate Right 90◦or Rotate Left 90◦, as shown in Figure 10-17.
On this same menu, you can also ﬂip an object either vertically or horizontally. Flipping is dif-
ferent from rotating in that it creates a mirror image of the object, not just a rotated version.
To set a precise amount of rotation for an object, use the Rotation text box in the Format Pic-
ture dialog box, shown in Figure 10-15. Use the increment buttons to increase or decrease the
rotation amount, or enter a precise number of degrees.
280

Chapter 10: Drawing and Formatting Objects
FIGURE 10-17
Rotate an object 90 degrees, or ﬂip an object from the Rotate menu.
Snapping Objects to a Grid
There is an invisible grid on every slide to which all objects snap. If you move an object and
position it so that it doesn’t quite align with the gridlines, when you release the object, it moves
slightly to snap into alignment with the nearest gridlines. This feature is on by default.
To turn off snapping for an individual instance, hold down the Alt key as you drag the object.
The object moves smoothly, unencumbered by the grid. To turn off snapping permanently,
follow these steps:
1.
On the Format tab, click Align and choose Grid Settings. The Grid and Guides dialog box
opens.
The Align button is also available on most contextual tabs, such as the Picture Tools For-
mat tab. You can also right-click the slide and choose Grid and Guides.
2.
Deselect the Snap Objects to Grid option, as shown in Figure 10-18.
3.
Click OK.
FIGURE 10-18
Toggle the grid on and off in the Grid and Guides dialog box.
281

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
You can also turn a feature on or off that is called Snap Objects to Other Objects (see
Figure 10-18). This feature is off by default. It helps you to precisely align shapes — for
example, to draw complex pictures where one line must exactly meet another — by snapping
shapes into position in relation to one another. You will not want to use this feature all of the
time because it makes it harder to position objects precisely in those instances where you do not
need one shape to align with another.
To display or hide the grid on the screen, select or deselect the Display Grid On Screen option.
To change the grid spacing, enter the desired amount in the Spacing text box.
Tip
New in PowerPoint 2010, you can use Smart Guides to help you align shapes. Smart Guides are little align-
ment lines (sometimes called whiskers) that appear when you drag one object close to another. You can
turn them off with Home ➪Arrange ➪Align ➪Grid Settings ➪Display Smart Guides When Shapes are
Aligned. (They’re on by default.) ■
Nudging Objects
If you are one of those people who have a hard time positioning objects precisely when you drag
them, you’ll appreciate the Nudge command. It moves an object slightly in the direction that you
want without altering it in the other plane. For example, suppose you have positioned a text box
in exactly the spot you want vertically but a little bit too far to the right. If you drag it manually,
you might accidentally change the vertical position. Instead, you can press an arrow key to move
it. Hold down Ctrl to override snapping to the grid.
Nudging moves the object one space on the grid when you have enabled the Snap Objects to
Grid option. (See the section, ‘‘Snapping Objects to a Grid’’ earlier in this chapter.) When the
Snap Objects to Grid option is turned off, you can nudge the object 1 pixel at a time.
Tip
Certain objects, such as SmartArt, will sometimes refuse to be moved (including by nudging) after you
have applied a 3-D Quick Style with a perspective view. To move such an object, click Edit in 2-D on the
SmartArt Tools Format tab. You can then move the object. Afterward, you can click Edit in 2-D again to
toggle it back to its regular 3-D appearance. Charts are quirky that way too; before you can nudge a chart,
you have to Ctrl+click it to select it. ■
Tip
Nudge buttons are not available on the Ribbon. However, if you would like, you can add them to the Quick
Access toolbar, or you can customize the Ribbon to include them. See Chapter 24 for more details. ■
Aligning or Distributing Objects
You can align or distribute objects either in relation to the slide or in relation to other objects.
Here are some examples:
282

Chapter 10: Drawing and Formatting Objects
 You can align an object to the top, bottom, left, right, or center of a slide.
 You can align two objects in relation to one another so that they are at the same vertical or
horizontal position.
 You can distribute three or more objects so that the spacing between them is even.
You can perform all of these functions from the Align drop-down menu on the Format tab when
you select one or more objects.
Note
The Align and Distribute features are not always available. To make them available, you must select Align
to Slide from the Align drop-down menu, or you must select two or more objects (for aligning) or three or
more objects (for distributing). ■
Aligning an Object in Relation to the Slide
To align a single object in relation to the slide, follow these steps:
1.
Select the object.
2.
On the Format tab, click Align, and make sure that Align to Slide is selected.
3.
Click Align again and choose one of the horizontal alignment commands: Align Left, Align
Center, or Align Right, as shown in Figure 10-19.
FIGURE 10-19
Choose an alignment for the object in relation to the slide.
4.
Click Align again and choose one of the vertical alignment commands: Align Top, Align
Middle, or Align Bottom.
283

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Aligning Two or More Objects with One Another
You can align two objects in relation to one another by assigning the same setting to both
objects. For example, in the left illustration in Figure 10-20, the objects are in their starting
positions. The right illustration shows what happens when you use the Align Top command to
move the lower object to the same vertical position as the higher one. If you use Align Bottom,
the higher object moves to match the lower one. If you use Align Center, both objects move to
split the difference between their two positions.
FIGURE 10-20
The original positioning (left) and the positioning after you apply the Align Top command (right).
To align two or more objects with one another, follow these steps:
1.
Select the objects.
2.
On the Format tab, click Align, and make sure that Align Selected Objects is selected.
3.
Click the Align button again to reopen the menu, and choose the desired alignment, either
vertical or horizontal.
Note
If you use the Align Top command and the objects move to the very top of the slide, you probably have
selected the Align to Slide option. Undo (Ctrl+Z) the action and try again. ■
Distributing Objects
Distribution works only in relation to the slide or with three or more objects selected. When you
distribute objects, you spread them evenly over a given space. For example, suppose you align
three boxes vertically, and now you want to even out the space between each box, as shown in
Figure 10-21. You can apply the Distribute Horizontally command to create the uniform spacing.
To distribute objects, follow these steps:
1.
Select the objects. To do so, hold down the Shift key while you click each one, or drag an
outline that encircles all of the objects.
2.
On the Format tab, click Align, and then click either Distribute Vertically or Distribute
Horizontally.
284

Chapter 10: Drawing and Formatting Objects
If you have only two objects selected, you cannot distribute them unless you have already
selected Align to Slide.
FIGURE 10-21
The original positioning (left) and the positioning after applying the Distribute Horizontally
command (right).
Layering Objects
You can stack objects on top of each other to create special effects. For example, you might cre-
ate a logo by stacking a text box on top of an oval or a rectangle, as shown in Figure 10-22.
FIGURE 10-22
You can create all kinds of logos, artwork, and other special effects by layering objects.

Drawn shape in back
Cross-Reference
To create a text box, see Chapter 4. ■
Tip
You can also type text directly into a drawn shape without using layering; simply right-click the shape and
choose Edit Text; you can also just begin typing while the shape is selected. ■
By default, objects stack in the order in which you create them. For example, in Figure 10-22,
the text box appears over the shape because the shape was created ﬁrst, and so it is on the bot-
tom of the stack. You can move the shape, but it will continue to be on the layer under the
text box.
285

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
If you need to reorder the objects in a stack, follow these steps:
1.
Click an object in the stack.
2.
Use one of the buttons in the Arrange group on the Format tab:
 Click Bring Forward to bring that object forward one position in the stack.
 Open the Bring Forward drop-down menu and choose Bring to Front to bring the
object to the top of the stack.
 Click Send Backward to send that object backward one position in the stack.
 Open the Send Backward drop-down menu and choose Send to Back to send the object
to the bottom of the stack.
3.
Repeat the steps to change the position of other objects in the stack as needed.
Another way to reorder object stacking is to use the Selection and Visibility pane:
1.
On the Home tab, choose Select ➪Selection Pane to display the Selection and Visibility
pane.
2.
Click an object’s name on the list.
3.
Click the Up or Down arrow buttons to move the object up or down in the stacking order.
Working with Object Groups
You have already learned how to select multiple objects and work with them as a single unit. For
example, you might select several shapes together that collectively form a picture that you have
drawn. If you intend to treat these objects as a single unit, you can save yourself some time by
grouping them. When you group two or more objects, these objects become a single object for
the purposes of moving and resizing. You can always ungroup them later if you need to work
with the objects separately. To group two or more objects together, follow these steps:
1.
Select all of the objects that you want to group.
2.
On the Format tab, open the Group drop-down menu and click Group. (Alternatively you
can press Ctrl+G.) The objects now form a group.
To ungroup a collection of objects, select the object group, open the Group drop-down menu,
and choose Ungroup, or press Ctrl+Shift+G. After ungrouping, you can make changes to
the objects separately. Then, if you want to regroup the same objects again, open the Group
drop-down menu and choose Regroup.
Tip
You can make some changes to objects even when they are part of a group, so it is not as necessary to
ungroup before editing or formatting an object. Try editing it ﬁrst as part of the group, and if that doesn’t
work, resort to ungrouping. ■
286

Chapter 10: Drawing and Formatting Objects
Caution
If you are moving a group, make sure you have selected the whole group, and not an object within it. If a
single object is selected in the group, it will move individually when you drag it. ■
Applying Shape or Picture Styles
Both the Drawing Tools Format tab and the Picture Tools Format tab (shown in Figures 10-13
and 10-14 respectively) have a style group from which you can apply preset formatting. For
drawn objects and charts, it is called Shape Styles; for photos and clip art, it is called Picture
Styles.
Using Shape Styles
Shape Styles are formatting presets that you can apply to drawn shapes, text boxes, and charts.
Shape Styles make it easy to apply common border and ﬁll combinations that use colors from
the current theme. A Shape Style is a combination of three things:
 Shape Fill: The color and style of the inside
 Shape Outline: The color and style of the outer border
 Shape Effects: Special effects that are applied to the object, such as shadows, reﬂection,
or beveled edges
Each of these can be separately applied, as you will learn later in this chapter. To apply a Shape
Style, follow these steps:
1.
Select the shape or shapes that you want to affect.
2.
On the Drawing Tools Format tab, open the Shape Styles gallery and click a style, as
shown in Figure 10-23.
The styles that appear on the gallery menu are built into PowerPoint, and you cannot change
them. Their colors change according to the color theme that is currently applied to the
presentation.
Tip
The Other Theme Fills option at the bottom of the gallery menu opens an extra palette that contains several
light and dark background ﬁlls that match the styles that display when you click Background Styles on the
Design tab. See Chapter 5 for more about applying background styles. Filling a shape with the same color
as the background makes it blend in with the background. ■
287

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
FIGURE 10-23
Apply a Shape Style as a shortcut to formatting a drawn object or a chart element.
Applying Picture Styles
Picture Styles are like Shape Styles, except that they apply to photos, clip art, and media clips.
A Picture Style applies different formatting than a Shape Style because pictures have different
needs. For example, a picture does not need a ﬁll color, because the picture is the ﬁll. A Picture
Style applies these things:
 Picture Shape: The shape of the frame in which the picture is placed
 Picture Border: The color and style of the outside of the picture frame
 Picture Effects: Special effects such as beveled edges and shadows
To apply a Picture Style, follow these steps:
1.
Select the picture that you want to affect.
2.
On the Picture Tools Format tab, open the Picture Styles gallery and click a style, as
shown in Figure 10-24.
The styles that appear on the gallery menu are built into PowerPoint, and you cannot change
them.
Tip
The formatting that you apply through Picture Styles is not dependent on the color theme, but some of the
border formatting is partially dependent on the background that you have chosen. For the Picture Styles
that include a border, the border color is either black or white, and it changes, depending on whether you
are using a light or dark background. (You can choose a background from the Background Styles button on
the Design tab.) If you want a different color border than the Picture Style provides, you can modify the
border color after applying the style. ■
288

Chapter 10: Drawing and Formatting Objects
FIGURE 10-24
Apply a Picture Style to quickly format an imported graphic such as a photo.
Understanding Color Selection
To apply a custom border or ﬁll color to an object, you must know something about how
PowerPoint uses and applies colors. Although this is covered in Chapter 5, here is a quick
review.
PowerPoint uses a set of color placeholders for the bulk of its color formatting. Because each
item’s color is deﬁned by a placeholder, and not as a ﬁxed color, you can easily change the col-
ors by switching to a different color theme. For example, if you decide that you want all of the
slide titles to be blue rather than green, you can make the change once and PowerPoint applies
it to all of the slides automatically.
A set of colors that is assigned to the preset positions is a color theme. You can apply both border
(outline) and ﬁll colors using color pickers. A color picker is a menu that shows the colors from
the currently chosen color theme, along with tints (light versions) and shades (dark versions) of
each of the theme colors. To stick with theme colors, which I recommend in most cases, choose
one of the theme colors or one of its tints or shades, as shown in Figure 10-25. You also have
the following options:
 To use a color that has already been used in this presentation, choose it from the Recent
Colors section. In Figure 10-25 there is one color in that section.
 If you need a color that does not change when you switch color themes, you can instead
click one of the swatches in the Standard Colors section on the color picker.
289

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
 If you need a color that is not represented in the Standard Colors section, you can choose
More Colors. (The command name varies, depending on what you are coloring; in
Figure 10-25, it is More Fill Colors.) This opens the Colors dialog box. The Standard
tab in the Colors dialog box contains swatches for many common colors. Most people
can ﬁnd the color that they want on the Standard tab. Click the color that you want and
click OK.
FIGURE 10-25
A color picker offers the current color theme’s colors, and also some standard (ﬁxed) colors.
If you need a color that does not appear in the swatches, you may need to use the Custom tab,
as shown in Figure 10-26. On this tab:
 You can enter the precise numbers for a color; for example, you can match the exact color
for a company logo.
 You can deﬁne colors numerically using either the HSL (hue, saturation, and luminosity)
or RGB (red, green, blue) color models. Choose the color model that you want from the
Color Model drop-down list.
 If you are using the HSL model, you can type the numbers into the Hue, Sat, and Lum
ﬁelds on the Custom tab. The hue is the tint (that is, green versus blue versus red). A low
number is a color at the red end of the spectrum, while a high number is a color at the
violet end. Saturation refers to the vividness of the color, and luminosity is the lightness or
darkness. A high luminosity mixes the color with white, while a low luminosity mixes the
color with black.
 An alternative way to deﬁne colors is by specifying numbers for red, green, and blue. Using
this measurement, 0, 0, 0 is pure black and 255, 255, 255 is pure white. All other colors
are some combination of the three colors. For example, pure blue is 0, 0, 255. A very pale
blue would be 200, 200, 255. You can play around with the numbers in the ﬁelds on the
Custom tab. The new color appears in the New area near the bottom of the dialog box.
Click OK to accept your choice.
290

Chapter 10: Drawing and Formatting Objects
FIGURE 10-26
Use the Custom tab of the Colors dialog box to precisely deﬁne a color that you want to use.
Tip
You can create an interesting see-through effect with the color by using the transparency slider. When this
slider is used for a color, it creates an effect like a watercolor paint wash over an item, so that whatever
is beneath it can partially show through. For photos, you can get a similar tint effect for the whole picture
using the Color drop-down list on the Picture Tools Format tab. ■
Applying an Object Border
A border (outline) around an object can draw attention to it, as well as separate it from sur-
rounding items.
When describing the buttons that create borders around an object, PowerPoint uses inconsis-
tent terminology between the two versions of the Format tab. For drawn objects, the button that
applies borders is called the Shape Outline button; for pictures it is called the Picture Border but-
ton. Both buttons open essentially the same menu — a standard color picker like the one shown
in Figure 10-25.
Note
The only difference between the Picture Border and the Shape Outline color pickers is that the latter has an
Arrows command. This command is available only when the selected object is a line (not a closed shape); it
applies arrowheads to one or both ends of the line. ■
291

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Border Attributes
A border has three basic attributes: its color, its width (thickness), and its dash style (solid,
dashed, dotted, etc.). You can set each of these basic attributes using the color picker, which
contains ﬂy-out menus at the bottom for Weight and Dashes. Each ﬂy-out menu has presets that
you can select.
To control the more advanced attributes of the line, or to make a selection other than a preset,
choose More Lines from one of the ﬂy-out submenus. This opens the Format Shape dialog box
with Line Style attributes selected, as shown in Figure 10-27.
FIGURE 10-27
Use the Format Shape dialog box to ﬁne-tune the line style.
Tip
You can also right-click and choose Format Picture to apply borders from the Format Picture dialog box. ■
In the Line Style controls of the Format Shape dialog box, you can set the following:
 Width: The thickness of the line in points
 Compound type: The number of parallel lines that comprise the overall line, and their
relative thicknesses
 Dash type: The style of line (solid, dashed, dotted)
292

Chapter 10: Drawing and Formatting Objects
 Cap type: The style for the ends of the line (applicable to lines only)
 Join type: The style for the corners of the shape
 Arrow settings: The types and sizes of the arrow heads (applicable to lines only)
Note
For a gradient line, click Line Color in the Format Shape dialog box. From there, you can choose Gradient
Line, and then choose a preset gradient or deﬁne your own. For more information about gradients, see the
section, ‘‘Gradient Fills’’ later in this chapter. ■
Creating a Semi-Transparent Border
By default, a line is not transparent at all. To specify a level of transparency for it, you can click
Line Color in the Format Shape dialog box and drag the Transparency slider to the right, or
enter a transparency percentage in the text box provided.
Note
Some of the picture or shape effects also affect the border of the object. These are covered later in this
chapter, in the section ‘‘Applying Object Effects.’’ ■
Applying an Object Fill
An object can have no ﬁll (that is, it can be transparent), or it can be ﬁlled with a solid color,
a gradient, a texture, a pattern, or a picture. Fills mostly apply to objects that you draw your-
self, such as shapes, charts, and SmartArt. Although Fill commands are available for imported
art such as pictures and clip art, these commands are not commonly applied to them. Because a
picture takes up the entire frame that it is in, any ﬁll that you might apply would not be visible
anyway (unless the picture has a transparent color set for it). With clip art, you might occasion-
ally want to apply a ﬁll, because most clip art has a transparent background. By applying a ﬁll to
it, you make the clip art’s background visible, so that it appears to be in a rectangular box rather
than ﬂoating on the background.

PowerPoint 2010 contains some interesting new features for working with pictures, including one that helps
you remove the background from a photo. See Chapter 13 for details. ■
Solid Fills
To apply a solid ﬁll for a shape, or other type of object that uses the Drawing Tools Format
tab (shown in Figure 10-13), you can choose a ﬁll type from the color picker that you access
through the Shape Fill button on the Drawing Tools Format tab. You can use the following
method.
293

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
To apply a solid ﬁll for an object that uses the Picture Tools Format tab (shown in
Figure 10-14), you must open the Format Shape dialog box for the object, and then click
Fill. Follow these steps:
1.
Right-click the object and choose Format Picture. The Format Picture dialog box opens.
2.
Click Fill.
3.
Click Solid Fill.
4.
Click the Color button in the dialog box to open a color picker.
5.
Select the desired color.
Cross-Reference
See the section ‘‘Understanding Color Selection’’ earlier in this chapter for more on selecting color. ■
6.
(Optional) Drag the Transparency slider to set transparency.
7.
Click Close.
Gradient Fills
When you watch a sunset, you can see how the red of the sun slowly fades into the blue-black
of the evening sky. You may not have thought of it in this way before, but this is a gradient.
Whenever one color turns gradually into another color, the transition is called a gradient. Gradi-
ents are often used on large shapes, on logos, and on backgrounds.
PowerPoint 2010 has powerful gradient capabilities. For example, you can create gradients
that consist of many different colors, and you can specify the spot at which one color shifts to
another.
Applying a One-Color Gradient Preset
For drawn shapes (and other objects that use the Drawing Tools Format tab), you can use the
Shape Fill button to access preset gradients that blend one color with either black or white.
These presets apply only to drawn objects, not to picture objects. Follow these steps to apply
a one-color preset:
1.
Apply a solid color ﬁll to the object; use the color that you want to combine with black or
white.
2.
Select the object and display the Drawing Tools Format tab.
3.
Open the Shape Fill drop-down menu, select Gradient, and click the desired gradient
style, as shown in Figure 10-28.
Applying a Custom Gradient
For more gradient options, use the Format Shape dialog box. This method works for all types
of objects, regardless of the type of Format tab that they use. When setting up a custom
294

Chapter 10: Drawing and Formatting Objects
gradient, you deﬁne stops. A stop is a position along the gradient that speciﬁes a certain color.
Each stop has three properties: color, stop position, and transparency. A gradient typically has
as many stops as it has colors; however, you can use the same color for multiple stops. For a
default, evenly spaced gradient, the stops are spaced out evenly in percentage. For example,
if you deﬁned three stops, they would be set at 0 percent, 50 percent, and 100 percent. You
can also achieve different effects by spacing out the stops differently. Figure 10-29 shows some
examples of various numbers and positions of stops.

You can use the Fill controls in the Format Shape dialog box to deﬁne a gradient, as shown in
Figure 10-30. The following list brieﬂy explains the settings in the dialog box.
You can set gradients to the following types:
 Linear: A linear gradient, like the ones in Figure 10-29, travels from one point to another.
You can set it to travel horizontally — as shown in Figure 10-29 — vertically, or diago-
nally, or you can set a speciﬁc angle.
 Radial: A radial gradient radiates out from a point. You can set it to radiate from the center
of the object, or from any of its corners.
 Rectangular: This gradient is similar to Radial, except that it radiates as a rectangle, rather
than as a curve.
 Path: This gradient follows the shape of the object. Try applying it to a starburst, for
example; the color radiates out from the center of the star.
You can also deﬁne your own colors and stops for a gradient, or you can start with one of the
Preset Colors settings. These are different from the single-color presets in the Drawing Tools For-
mat tab because they are color combinations with predeﬁned stops. You can also start with one
of these sets of combinations as a shortcut.
296

Chapter 10: Drawing and Formatting Objects
FIGURE 10-30
You can deﬁne gradient stops and settings in the Format Shape dialog box.
The Gradient Stops slider contains one or more markers, which you can drag to change its posi-
tion. To add another stop, click the plus (+) button; to remove a stop, select it and click the
minus (–) button.
The Transparency setting adjusts the amount of transparency that is associated with that posi-
tion in the gradient. You can use this setting to make certain areas of an object more transparent
than others. For example, you could deﬁne the same color for all of the gradient stops, but set
different levels of transparency for each stop, to make an object seem like it is fading away.
The Rotate with Shape option determines if the gradient rotates when you rotate a shape.
To create a custom gradient, follow these steps:
1.
Right-click the object to be ﬁlled and choose Format Shape or Format Picture, depending
on the object type. The Format Shape dialog box opens.
2.
Click Fill, and then click the Gradient Fill button. Controls for creating a custom gradient
appear, as shown in Figure 10-30.
3.
(Optional) Select a preset from the Preset Colors drop-down list. If you select a preset,
PowerPoint predeﬁnes two or more stops for you in the Gradient Stops section.
4.
Open the Type drop-down list and select the type of gradient that you want: Linear,
Radial, Rectangular, or Path.
297

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
5.
If you chose Linear, Radial, or Rectangular, open the Direction drop-down list and choose
a direction swatch. If you chose Linear, change the incremental value in the Angle text box
as needed to adjust the angle.
6.
Mark or clear the Rotate with Shape check box.
7.
On the Gradient Stops slider, select the ﬁrst marker. (You can do them in any order; I
usually start with the leftmost one and work to the right.)
8.
Do the following to modify the stop:
a. Open the Color drop-down list and select the color for that position.
b. (Optional) Use the increment buttons to adjust the Position value, or drag the marker
to a different position on the slider.
c. (Optional) Use the increment buttons to adjust the Brightness setting, or drag its
slider.
d. (Optional) Use the increment buttons to adjust the Transparency setting, or
drag its slider. Zero percent is no transparency, while 100 percent is complete
transparency.
9.
Select the next stop on the Gradient Stops slider bar, and repeat step 9.
10.
(Optional) Add or remove stops:
 If you need to create more stops, click the Add (+) button and then repeat step 8 for
each new stop.
 If you need to delete a stop, select it and then click the Remove (−) button.
11.
Click Close to close the dialog box.
Texture and Picture Fills
A texture ﬁll is actually a picture ﬁll, but it is a special type of picture that, when tiled, looks
like a surface texture such as wood, marble, or cloth. To apply a texture ﬁll, select one from the
Texture submenu on the Shape Fill drop-down menu (for an object that has the Drawing Tools
Format tab). The More Textures option at the bottom of the palette of presets opens the Shape
Fill dialog box (the same as the method in the following steps).
If you are ﬁlling an object that doesn’t have a Shape Fill button on the Drawing Tools Format
tab, you can use the Format Shape dialog box instead. Follow these steps:
1.
Right-click the object and choose Format Shape or Format Picture, depending on the
object type. The Format Shape dialog box opens.
2.
Click Fill if it is not already selected.
3.
Click to select the Picture or Texture Fill option.
4.
Click the Texture button and select a texture, as shown in Figure 10-31.
5.
Click Close.
298

Chapter 10: Drawing and Formatting Objects
FIGURE 10-31
Select one of the preset textures from the Texture button’s gallery.
Tip
You can also use your own pictures as textures. To do so, use the procedure for picture ﬁlls in the following
section and make sure that you select the Tile Picture as Texture option. ■
You can also use a picture as an object ﬁll. You can specify a picture from a ﬁle stored on your
hard disk, from the contents of the Clipboard, or from the clip art that is available in your Ofﬁce
applications. Picture ﬁlls were discussed brieﬂy at the end of Chapter 9 as they pertain to table
cells, but you can ﬁll almost any object with a picture, not just a text box or table cell.
Tip
You can ﬁll a clip-art image that has a transparent background with another picture, creating a
picture-on-picture effect. ■
In the Format Shape dialog box, when you select the Picture or Texture Fill option, shown in
Figure 10-31, three buttons appear:
 File: Click this button to open an Insert Picture dialog box, and then select the picture that
you want to use.
299

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
 Clipboard: Click this button to insert the contents of the Clipboard as the graphic to use.
This technique works only with the last item that you placed on the Clipboard, not the full
24-item Ofﬁce Clipboard.
 Clip Art: Click this button to open a Select Picture dialog box, which is a simpliﬁed ver-
sion of the Clip Art pane. Search for a clip-art image by keyword, and then select and insert
the clip art.
After you select the picture that you want to use, you can set any of the following options to
control how it appears:
 Tile Picture as Texture: When you enable this option, the picture appears at its actual
size as a background ﬁll for the object. If the picture is smaller than the object that it is
ﬁlling, then it tiles like a texture (where multiple copies are used). If the picture is larger
than the object that it is ﬁlling, then a truncated copy appears.
 Tiling Options: This option controls how the picture ﬁll adjusts within the object. An
offset moves it in the speciﬁed direction. See Figure 10-32.
FIGURE 10-32
Adjust tiling options.
Tip
Offsets are especially useful if you are using the Tile Picture as Texture option with a large picture; you can
use offsets to position the desired part of the picture in the viewable area. ■
 Transparency: Drag the slider or enter a percentage if you want the picture ﬁll to be
semi-transparent; this works just the same as with colors and gradients.
 Rotate with Shape: Select or deselect this option to indicate whether the picture should
rotate when the object is rotated. This is just the same as with gradients.
Background Fills
You can also apply the background as a ﬁll for shapes and drawn objects. This is somewhat
like setting the background ﬁll to No Fill so that the background shows through, except that
it hides any objects that are between the affected object and the background. In the example
in Figure 10-33, the oval has the background as its ﬁll, and it is sitting on top of a text box.
This is better than ﬁlling the oval with the same pattern, gradient, or texture as the background,
300

Chapter 10: Drawing and Formatting Objects
because no matter where you move it on the slide, its background will continue to ‘‘match’’ with
the slide’s background. To apply a background ﬁll, choose the Background option from the Fill
settings in the Format Shape dialog box.
FIGURE 10-33
A background ﬁll allows the background to show through, but hides any intervening objects.
Applying Object Effects
Object effects are special transformations such as reﬂections, glows, and bevels. You can apply
object effects from the Shape Effects or Picture Effects button on the Format tab, depending on
the object type. The available effects are nearly identical for all types of objects, except for the
different names of the buttons from which you select them. The following sections explain each
effect.
Preset
Presets (in the context of object effects) are 3-D effects. They include combinations of gradient
ﬁlls and edge formatting (such as bevels) that make an object appear to have some depth. You
can start with one of these presets as a shortcut to a more complex effect, or just use them as
they are. Figure 10-34 shows some of the presets applied to a circle.
Shadow
You can create outer, inner, or perspective shadows, as shown in Figure 10-35. At ﬁrst glance,
an inner shadow might look the same as an outer one, but if you increase an inner shadow’s
301

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
size, you will notice that the increased size of the shadow decreases the size of the object — that
is, the shadow cuts into the object, rather than appearing behind it as a separate element.
FIGURE 10-34
You can use presets to apply 3-D object effects.
FIGURE 10-35
Outer (left), inner (center), and perspective (right) shadows.
From the drop-down menu of the Shape Effects or Picture Effects button, select Shadow and
then click one of the shadow presets, or click More Shadows to open Shadow controls in the
Format Shape dialog box, as shown in Figure 10-36. To ﬁne-tune the shadow, you can start with
one of the presets from the Presets drop-down menu, customize it by choosing a color, and then
drag the sliders for each of the shadow attributes: Transparency, Size, Blur, Angle, and Distance.
The shadow applies to either the object or its frame, depending on the object type and whether
or not it has a transparent background. The following conditions create different results:
 Text and drawn shapes: A shadow applied to text, or to a drawn object, clings directly
to the object, regardless of the background ﬁll.
Note
If text is typed in a shape, the shadow applies only to the shape. If you want text typed in a shape to have
a shadow, you must use Text Effects in the WordArt Styles. ■
302

Chapter 10: Drawing and Formatting Objects
FIGURE 10-36
If none of the presets meets your needs, you can customize a shadow using the Format Shape
dialog box.
Caution
If a shape containing text has no ﬁll, the shadow you apply to the shape will apply to the text too. This
can cause problems when animating, though; the shadow won’t animate with the text. Therefore it is not
recommended to add a shape shadow to such a shape if you plan on assigning an animation event to it. ■
 Inserted pictures (such as scanned photos): The shadow applies to the rectangular
frame around the picture; if the picture is inserted in a shape, the shadow applies to the
shape.
 Clip art, text boxes, and charts: If the background is set to No Fill, the shadow applies
to the object inside the frame; if you have an applied ﬁll, the shadow applies to the frame.
Caution
If you change the shadow color, you should generally use a color that is darker than the object.
Lighter-colored shadows do not look realistic. However, for black text, you should use a gray shadow. ■
Reﬂection
Reﬂection creates a mirror image of the object, below the original. A reﬂection is affected by two
factors: the amount of reﬂection — partial or full — and the offset, or distance between it and
303

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
the original. The presets on the Shape Effect ➪Reﬂection submenu use various combinations of
these two factors.
You can also customize the reﬂection by choosing Reﬂection Options, or by displaying the
Reﬂection tab in the Format Shape dialog box, as shown in Figure 10-37. Choose a preset to
start with, and then drag the sliders to adjust it as needed. The factors you can change are
Transparency, Size, Distance, and Blur.
FIGURE 10-37
Customize a reﬂection effect on the Reﬂection tab of the Format Shape dialog box.
Glow and Soft Edges
Glow creates a colored ‘‘halo’’ around the object. You can choose the color either from the theme
colors or from a ﬁxed color that you specify. To select a different color, choose More Glow
Colors and then choose a color from the Colors dialog box. Choose Glow Options to open the
Format Shape dialog box, where you can adjust Color, Size, and Transparency for the effect.
Soft Edges is similar to the Glow effect. Whereas Glow creates a fuzzy halo around the outside of
an object, Soft Edges uses the same color as the object to create a fuzzy effect by cutting into the
edges of the object. The difference between these two effects is similar to the difference between
an outer and an inner shadow. A shape can have either or both.
304

Chapter 10: Drawing and Formatting Objects
Bevels
A bevel is an effect that you apply to the edge of an object to make it look raised, sunken,
or textured. You can apply beveling to ﬂat shapes and other objects to give them a thick,
three-dimensional appearance, or you can combine them with a real 3-D rotation effect, as
described in the following section. Figure 10-38 shows some examples of bevels that you can
create using presets. You can access these presets through the Bevel submenu in either the Shape
Effects or Picture Effects drop-down menu.
FIGURE 10-38
Beveled edges give a shape a three-dimensional appearance without tilting or rotating the object.
For more beveling choices, click 3-D Options at the bottom of the Bevel submenu. This opens
the Format Shape dialog box with the 3-D Format controls displayed, as shown in Figure 10-39.
You can also access this dialog box by right-clicking the object and choosing Format Shape (or
Format Picture).
Beveling is a type of non-rotational 3-D effect — in other words, it is a 3-D format. You will
learn about the other 3-D formatting options in the next section.
The Bottom bevel setting has no apparent effect unless you apply a 3-D rotation to the object,
because you can’t see the effect at zero rotation. As a result, we will only concern ourselves with
the width and height settings for a top bevel:
 Width: Speciﬁes how far the effect extends into the object
 Height: Speciﬁes how dramatic the effect is vertically
You won’t notice much height difference for a bevel unless you have applied a 3-D rotation to
the object, but the width setting is immediately apparent for all objects.
305

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
FIGURE 10-39
You can set bevels and other 3-D formatting effects in the 3-D Format section of the Format Shape
dialog box.
3-D Rotation and 3-D Formatting
The 3-D rotation effect makes a two-dimensional object look three-dimensional by applying
perspective to it. The 3-D rotation effect uses angle measurements for three dimensions: X, Y,
and Z:
 X rotation: Rotation from side to side
 Y rotation: Rotation from top to bottom
 Z rotation: Pivoting around a center point
X and Y rotation actually change the shape of the object on the slide to simulate perspective; Z
rotation simply spins the object, just as you would with a rotation handle.
You can combine 3-D rotation with 3-D formatting to create interesting effects, such as adding
‘‘sides’’ to a ﬂat object and coloring these sides in a certain way. For example, you could combine
these effects to turn a square into a cube. The 3-D formatting effect is formatting (colors, lengths,
and textures) that affects an object’s 3-D appearance. The 3-D formatting effect consists of the
following aspects:
 Bevel: As discussed in the preceding section, this effect alters the edges of the object. You
can set top and bottom bevels separately.
306

Chapter 10: Drawing and Formatting Objects
 Depth: This allows you to specify the size and color of the sides of the object. However,
the sides are not visible unless the object is three-dimensionally rotated.
 Contour: This allows you to specify the color and size of outlines that mark the edges of
the 3-D effect.
 Surface: This allows you to specify the material and lighting that the object should
simulate.
Figure 10-40 shows several types of 3-D rotation and formatting. Beveling is also a type of 3-D
formatting, and so some examples of it are included.
FIGURE 10-40
Some examples of 3-D rotation and formatting.

Depth 4 pt,
X: 40, Y: 40, Z: 310

Although you can use 3-D rotation and 3-D formatting together to create the effects shown in
Figure 10-40, they are actually controlled separately in PowerPoint. Therefore, creating these
effects is a two-step process.
Applying 3-D Rotation
To apply 3-D rotation, you can either use one of the 3-D Rotation presets, or you can enter
rotation amounts directly into the Format Shape dialog box. To use a preset, Click the Shape
Effects (or Picture Effects) button on the Format tab, select 3-D Rotation, and click a preset. The
Oblique presets at the bottom of the menu are the most similar to the older 3-D effects from
PowerPoint 2003 and earlier.
307

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Caution
If you have not yet added depth to the shape by using its 3-D Format settings, you won’t see any effect
from the Oblique presets because there are not yet any ‘‘sides’’ to the shape. ■
To rotate a precise amount, choose 3-D Options from the bottom of the presets menu, or
right-click the object and choose Format Shape (or Format Picture) to open the Format Shape
dialog box. Then click 3-D Rotation, as shown in Figure 10-41. You can start with one of the
presets by selecting it from the Rotation Preset drop-down menu.
FIGURE 10-41
Set X, Y, and Z rotation for the object in the Format Shape dialog box.
The other settings for rotation are:
 Keep Text Flat: This option prevents any text in the shape from rotating on the X- or
Y-axis.
 Distance from Ground: This setting adds space between the object and the background.
To see this effect more clearly, rotate the object.
 Reset to 2-D: You can press this button to remove all 3-D settings so that you can start
fresh.
308

Chapter 10: Drawing and Formatting Objects
Applying 3-D Formatting
You can use 3-D formatting to control the colors and the amount of depth of the surfaces and
sides of a 3-D rotated object. You control these settings from the 3-D Format section of the
Format Shape dialog box, as shown in Figure 10-39:
 The Depth of an object determines the length and color of its sides. In most cases, you
want to keep the sides set to the default color setting, Match Shape Fill. This enables the
sides to change colors when the shape changes colors. Although the sides are a darker
shade of the object’s color in order to create the illusion of depth, you can adjust their color
through the application of surface material and lighting.
 Contours are similar to outlines, or borders, except that contours go around each side of a
3-D object. For example, if you have a square with sides (a cube), the color and size that
you set for Contours creates a border around the front face as well as around each visible
side surface.
 The surface material determines how shiny the surface appears, and how bright its color is
on the front face compared to the sides. The Material button opens a palette that displays
various materials such as Matte, Plastic, and Metal. The Lighting button opens a palette
that displays various types of lighting that you can apply to the object, such as Harsh, Soft,
Bright Room, and so on. To adjust the direction from which the light hits the object, you
can change the Angle setting.
Tips for Creating Common 3-D Objects
The 3-D formatting and rotation settings in PowerPoint 2010 are very powerful, and can seem a
little overwhelming at ﬁrst because of the variety of available options. Take your time in explor-
ing them, and I think you’ll be pleasantly surprised at what you can accomplish. Here are some
things you can try.
To create a perfectly round sphere, which stays round no matter how you rotate it, follow these
steps:
1.
Draw an oval.
2.
Select the oval and use the Size boxes on the Drawing Tools Format tab to set its height
and width to the same value, thus making it a perfect circle. For this experiment, use a
whole number such as 1′′ or 2′′.
3.
Right-click the circle and choose Format Shape.
4.
In the 3-D Format settings, set the top and bottom bevel, both Height and Width, to 36
points for every 1′′ of diameter. For example, if your circle is 2′′ in diameter, use 72 points
for each.
To create a four-sided pyramid, follow these steps:
1.
Draw a rectangle.
2.
Select the rectangle and use the Size boxes on the Drawing Tools Format tab to set its
height and width to the same value, making it a perfect square. For this experiment,
use 1′′.
309

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
3.
Right-click the square and choose Format Shape.
4.
In the 3-D Format settings, for both the Top and Bottom bevel styles, choose Angle (the
ﬁrst preset on the second row).
5.
Set the bevel settings as follows:
a. Top Width: 36 points for every 1′′ of the square’s size, plus 1 point. For example,
for a 1′′ square, use 37 points; for a 2′′ square, use 73 points.
b. Top Height: 72 points for every 1′′ of the square’s size.
c. Bottom (height and width): 0 points.
6.
In the 3-D Rotation tab, rotate the object so that you can see it more clearly:
 X: 30
 Y: 300
 Z: 325
Tip
To create pyramids with different numbers of sides, use shapes other than squares. For example, to create a
three-sided pyramid, start with a triangle. To create a cone, use a circle. ■
Summary
In this chapter, you learned how to draw lines and shapes, and how to format almost any type
of object. You’ll use these skills as you go forward in the rest of the book, learning about speciﬁc
types of objects, including SmartArt, clip art, and so on. No matter what type of graphic you
encounter, you’ll be able to format it using these same techniques.
In the next chapter, you’ll learn how to create and format SmartArt diagrams, which combine the
best of a bulleted list with the best of drawn objects to present text data in an interesting way.

ust as charts and graphs can enliven a boring table of numbers,
a SmartArt diagram can enliven a conceptual discussion. SmartArt
helps the audience understand the interdependencies of objects or
processes in a visual way, so they don’t have to juggle that information
mentally as you speak. Some potential uses include organizational charts,
hierarchy diagrams, and ﬂow charts.
Understanding SmartArt Types
and Their Uses
SmartArt is a special class of vector graphic object that combines shapes,
lines, and text placeholders. SmartArt is most often used to illustrate rela-
tionships between bits of text.
The SmartArt interface is similar regardless of the type of diagram you are
creating. You can type directly into the placeholders on the diagram, or you
can display a Text pane to the side of the diagram and type into that, much
as you would type into an outline pane, to have text appear in a slide’s text
placeholder boxes. See Figure 11-1. You can also select some text, right-click
it, and choose Convert to SmartArt.
There are eight types of SmartArt diagrams in PowerPoint 2010, and each is
uniquely suited for a certain type of data delivery.

List
A List diagram presents information in a fairly straightforward, text-based way, somewhat like a
fancy outline. List diagrams are useful when information is not in any particular order, or when
the process or progression between items is not important. The list can have multiple levels, and
you can enclose each level in a shape or not. Figure 11-2 shows an example.
Process
A Process diagram is similar to a list, but it has directional arrows or other connectors that rep-
resent the ﬂow of one item to another. This adds an extra aspect of meaning to the diagram. For
example, in Figure 11-3, the way the boxes are staggered and connected with arrows implies that
the next step begins before the previous one ends.
Cycle
A Cycle diagram also illustrates a process, but a repeating or recursive one — usually a process
in which there is no ﬁxed beginning or end point. You can jump into the cycle at any point.
In Figure 11-4, for example, the ongoing process of product development and improvement is
illustrated.

Hierarchy
A Hierarchy chart is an organization chart. It shows structure and relationships between people
or things in standardized levels. For example, it can show who reports to whom in a company’s
employment system. It is useful when describing how the organization functions and who is
responsible for what. In Figure 11-5, for example, three organization levels are represented, with
lines of reporting drawn between each level. Hierarchy diagrams can also run horizontally, for
use in tournament rosters.

Tip
Should you include your company’s organization chart in your presentation? That’s a question that depends
on your main message. If your speech is about the organization, you should. If not, show the organization
structure only if it serves a purpose to advance your speech. Many presenters have found that an orga-
nization chart makes an excellent backup slide. You can prepare it and have it ready in case a question
arises about the organization. Another useful strategy is to include a printed organization chart as part of
the handouts you distribute to the audience, without including the slide in your main presentation. ■
Relationship
Relationship diagrams graphically illustrate how parts relate to a whole. One common type
of Relationship diagram is a Venn diagram, as in Figure 11-6, showing how categories of people
or things overlap. Relationship diagrams can also break things into categories or show how parts
contribute to a whole, as with a pie chart.
314

Chapter 11: Creating SmartArt Diagrams
FIGURE 11-6
A Relationship diagram shows how parts relate to a whole.
Matrix
A Matrix also shows the relationship of parts to a whole, but it does so with the parts in orderly
looking quadrants. You can use Matrix diagrams when you do not need to show any particular
relationship between items, but you want to make it clear that they make up a single unit. See
Figure 11-7.
FIGURE 11-7
A Matrix diagram uses a grid to represent the contributions of parts to a whole.
Pyramid
A Pyramid diagram is just what the name sounds like — it’s a striated triangle with text at var-
ious levels, representing not only the relationship between the items, but also that the items at
the smaller part of the triangle are less numerous or more important. For example, the diagram
in Figure 11-8 shows that there are many more workers than there are executives.
315

Tip
Notice in Figure 11-8 that the labels do not conﬁne themselves to within the associated shape. If this is a
problem, you might be able to make the labels ﬁt with a combination of line breaks (Shift+Enter) and font
changes. ■
FIGURE 11-8
A Pyramid diagram represents the progression between less and more of something.
Picture
The Picture category is a collection of SmartArt diagram types from the other categories that
include picture placeholders in them. You’ll ﬁnd List, Process, and other types of diagrams here;
the Picture category simply summarizes them.
Inserting a Diagram
All SmartArt diagrams start out the same way — you insert them on the slide as you can any
other slide object. That means you can either use a diagram placeholder on a slide layout or you
can insert the diagram manually.
To use a placeholder, start with a slide that contains a layout with a diagram placeholder in it, or
change the current slide’s layout to one that does. Then click the Insert SmartArt Graphic icon in
the placeholder, as shown in Figure 11-9. To insert from scratch, click the SmartArt button on
the Insert tab.
FIGURE 11-9
Click the SmartArt icon in the placeholder on a slide.

316

Chapter 11: Creating SmartArt Diagrams
Another way to start a new diagram is to select some text and then right-click the selection and
choose Convert to SmartArt.
Any way you start it, the Choose a SmartArt Graphic dialog box opens, as shown in
Figure 11-10. Select one of the SmartArt categories, click the desired SmartArt object,
and click OK, and the diagram appears. From there it’s just a matter of customizing.
FIGURE 11-10
Select the diagram type you want to insert.
Note
Some diagrams appear in more than one category. To browse all of the categories at once, select the All
category. You can access additional diagrams by choosing the Ofﬁce.com category. ■
When you select a diagram, SmartArt Tools tabs become available (Design and Format). You
will learn what each of the buttons on them does as this chapter progresses. The buttons change
depending on the type of diagram.
Editing SmartArt Text
All SmartArt has text placeholders, which are basically text boxes. You simply click in one of
them and type. Then use the normal text-formatting controls (Font, Font Size, Bold, Italic, and
so on) on the Home tab to change the appearance of the text, or use the WordArt Styles group
on the Format tab to apply WordArt formatting.
317

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
You can also display a Text pane, as shown in Figure 11-1, and type or edit the diagram’s text
there. The Text pane serves the same purpose for a diagram that the Outline pane serves for the
slide as a whole.
Warning
The text in the outline pane is not always in the order you would expect it to be for the diagram because
it forces text to appear in linear form from a diagram that is not necessarily linear. It does not matter
how the text appears in the Text pane because only you see that. What matters is how it looks in the
actual diagram. ■
Here are some tips for working with diagram text:
 To leave a text box empty, just don’t type anything in it. The Click to add text words do not
show up in a printout or in Slide Show view.
 To promote a line of text, press Shift+Tab; to demote it, press Tab in the Text pane.
 Text wraps automatically, but you can press Shift+Enter to insert a line break if necessary.
 In most cases, the text size shrinks to ﬁt the graphic in which it is located. There are some
exceptions to that, though; for example, at the top of a pyramid, the text can overﬂow the
tip of the pyramid.
 All of the text is the same size, so if you enter a really long string of text in one box, the text
size in all of the related boxes shrinks too. You can manually format parts of the diagram
to change this behavior, as you will learn later in the chapter.
 If you resize the diagram, its text resizes automatically.
Modifying SmartArt Structure
The structure of the diagram includes how many boxes it has and where they are placed. Even
though the diagram types are all very different, the way you add, remove, and reposition shapes
in them is surprisingly similar across all types.
Note
When you add a shape, you add both a graphical element (a circle, a bar, or other) and an associated text
placeholder. The same applies to deletion; removing a shape also removes its associated text placeholder
from the diagram. ■
Inserting and Deleting Shapes
To insert a shape in a diagram, follow these steps:
1.
Click a shape that is adjacent to where you want the new shape to appear.
2.
On the SmartArt Tools Design tab, click Add Shape.
You can either click the top part of the Add Shape button to add a shape of the same level and
type as the selected one, or you can click the bottom part of the button to open a menu from
318

Chapter 11: Creating SmartArt Diagrams
which you can choose other variants. The choices on the menu depend on the diagram type
and the type of shape selected. For example, in Figure 11-11, you can insert a shape into a dia-
gram either before or after the current one (same outline level), or you can insert a shape that is
subordinate (below) or superior to (above) the current one.
FIGURE 11-11
Add a shape to the diagram.
To delete a shape, click it to select it in the diagram, and then press the Delete key on the key-
board. You might need to delete subordinate shapes before you can delete the main shape.
Note
Not all diagram types can accept different numbers of shapes. For example the four-square matrix diagram
is ﬁxed at four squares. ■
Adding Bullets
In addition to adding shapes to the diagram, you can add bullets — that is, subordinate text to
a shape. To do so, click the Add Bullet button. Bullets appear indented under the shape’s text in
the Text pane, as shown in Figure 11-12.
FIGURE 11-12
Create subordinate bullet points under a shape.
319

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Promoting and Demoting Text
The difference between a shape and a bullet is primarily a matter of promotion and demotion
in the Text pane’s outline. The Text pane works just as the regular Outline pane does in this
regard; you can promote with Shift+Tab or demote with Tab. You can also use the Promote and
Demote buttons on the SmartArt Tools Design tab.
Changing the Flow Direction
Each diagram ﬂows in a certain direction. A cycle diagram ﬂows either clockwise or counter-
clockwise. A pyramid ﬂows either up or down.
If you realize after typing all of the text that you should have made the SmartArt diagram ﬂow in
the other direction, you can change it by clicking the Right to Left button on the Design tab. It
is a toggle; you can switch back and forth freely.
Reordering Shapes
Not only can you reverse the overall ﬂow of the diagram, but you can also move around
individual shapes. For example, suppose you have a diagram that illustrates ﬁve steps in a
process and you realize that steps 3 and 4 are out of order. You can move one of them without
having to retype all of the labels.
The easiest way to reorder the shapes is to select one and then click the Reorder Down or
Reorder Up button on the Design tab.
If you have more complex reordering to do, you might prefer to work in the Text pane instead,
cutting and pasting text like this:
1.
Display the Text pane if it does not already appear. You can either click the arrow
button to the left of the diagram or click the Text Pane button on the SmartArt Tools
Design tab.
2.
Select some text to be moved in the Text pane.
3.
Press Ctrl+X to cut it to the Clipboard.
4.
Click in the Text pane at the beginning of the line above which it should
appear.
5.
Press Ctrl+V to paste.
Repositioning Shapes
You can individually select and drag each shape to reposition it on the diagram. Any connectors
between it and the other shapes are automatically resized and extended as needed. For example,
in Figure 11-13, notice how the arrows that connect the circles in the cycle diagram have elon-
gated as one of the circles has moved out.
320

Chapter 11: Creating SmartArt Diagrams
FIGURE 11-13
When you move pieces of a diagram, connectors move and stretch as needed.

Arrows change size & position
Resetting a Graphic
After making changes to a SmartArt diagram, you can return it to its default settings with the
Reset Graphic button on the SmartArt Tools Design tab. This strips off everything, including
any SmartArt styles and manual positioning, and makes it exactly as it was when you inserted
it except it keeps the text that you’ve typed.
Changing to a Different Diagram Layout
The layouts are the diagram types. When you insert a SmartArt diagram you choose a type, and
you can change that type at any time later.
To change the layout type, use the Layouts gallery on the Design tab, as shown in
Figure 11-14. You can open the gallery and click the desired type, or click More Layouts
at the bottom of its menu to redisplay the same dialog box as in Figure 11-10, from which you
can choose any layout.

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Modifying a Hierarchy Diagram Structure
Hierarchy diagrams (organization charts) show the structure of an organization. They have some
different controls for changing their structure compared to other diagrams, so this chapter looks
at them separately.
Inserting and Deleting Shapes
The main difference when inserting an organization chart shape (that is, a box into which you
will type a name) is that you must specify which existing box the new one is related to and how
it is related.
For example, suppose you have a supervisor already in the chart and you want to add some peo-
ple to the chart who report to him. You would ﬁrst select his box on the chart, and then insert
the new shapes with the Add Shape button. For a box of the same level, or of the previously
inserted level, click the top part of the button; for a subordinate or other relationship, open the
button’s menu. See Figure 11-15. The chart can have only one box at the top level, however, just
as a company can have only one CEO.
FIGURE 11-15
Add more shapes to a hierarchy diagram.

box should be

When you insert a new shape in a hierarchy diagram, four of the options are the same as with
any other diagram, and one is new: Add Shape After and Add Shape Before insert shapes of the
322

Chapter 11: Creating SmartArt Diagrams
same level as the selected one, and Add Shape Above and Add Shape Below insert a superior
and subordinate level respectively. The new option, Add Assistant, adds a box that is neither
subordinate nor superior, but a separate line of reporting, as shown in Figure 11-16.
FIGURE 11-16
An Assistant box in a hierarchy chart.
Note
An assistant is a person whose job is to provide support to a certain person or ofﬁce. An executive secretary
is one example. In contrast, a subordinate is an employee who may report to a manager but whose job does
not consist entirely of supporting that manager. Confused? Don’t worry about it. You don’t have to make a
distinction in your organization chart. Everyone can be a subordinate (except the person at the top of the
heap, of course). ■
To delete a shape, select it and press the Delete key, as with all of the other diagram types.
Changing a Person’s Level in the Organization
As the organization changes, you might need to change your chart to show that people report to
different supervisors. The easiest way to do that is to move the text in the Text pane, the same
way as you learned in the section ‘‘Reordering Shapes’’ earlier in this chapter. To promote some-
one, select his or her box and press Shift+Tab.
To change who someone reports to, select his or her box and press Ctrl+X to cut it to the Clip-
board. Then select the box of the person they now report to, and press Ctrl+V to paste.
Controlling Subordinate Layout Options
When subordinates report to a supervisor, you can list the subordinates beneath that supervi-
sor in a variety of ways. In Standard layout, each subordinate appears horizontally beneath the
supervisor, as shown in Figure 11-17.
However, in a large or complex organization chart, the diagram can quickly become too wide
with the Standard layout. Therefore, there are ‘‘hanging’’ alternatives that make the chart more
323

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
vertically oriented. The alternatives are Both, Left Hanging, and Right Hanging. They are just
what their names sound like. Figure 11-18 shows examples of Left Hanging (the people report-
ing to Ashley Colvin) and Right Hanging (the people reporting to Karen Weir).
FIGURE 11-17
This is the standard layout for a branch of an organization chart.
FIGURE 11-18
Hanging layouts make the chart more vertically oriented.
324

Chapter 11: Creating SmartArt Diagrams
The layout is chosen for individual branches of the organization chart, so before selecting an
alternative layout, you must click on the supervisor box whose subordinates you want to change.
To change a layout, follow these steps:
1.
Click the box for the supervisor whose layout you want to change.
2.
On the Design tab, click Layouts. A menu of layout options appears.
3.
Choose one of the layouts (Standard, Both, Left Hanging, or Right Hanging).
Note
If the Layout button’s menu does not open, you do not have a box selected in a hierarchy diagram. ■
Formatting a Diagram
You can format a diagram either automatically or manually. Automatic formatting is the default,
and many PowerPoint users don’t even realize that manual formatting is a possibility. The fol-
lowing sections cover both.
Applying a SmartArt Style
SmartArt Styles are preset formatting specs (border, ﬁll, effects, shadows, and so on) that you can
apply to an entire SmartArt diagram. They make it easy to apply surface texture effects that make
the shapes look reﬂective or appear to have 3-D depth or perspective.
Note
SmartArt Styles do not include color changes. Those are separately controlled with the Change Colors but-
ton on the SmartArt Tools Design tab. ■
To apply a SmartArt style, follow these steps:
1.
Select the diagram so that the SmartArt Tools Design tab becomes available.
2.
On the SmartArt Tools Design tab, click one of the SmartArt Styles samples (see
Figure 11-19), or open the gallery and select from a larger list (see Figure 11-20).
FIGURE 11-19
Select a SmartArt Style.
Click here to
open the gallery
to select styles
325

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
FIGURE 11-20
Open the SmartArt Style gallery for more choices.
Changing SmartArt Colors
After you apply a SmartArt style, as in the preceding section, you might want to change the col-
ors used in the diagram.
The easiest way to apply colors is to use the Change Colors button’s menu on the Design tab.
You can select from a gallery of color schemes. As shown in Figure 11-21, you can choose a
Colorful scheme (one in which each shape has its own color), or you can choose a monochrome
color scheme based on any of the current presentation color theme’s color swatches.
Notice the command at the bottom of the menu in Figure 11-21: Recolor Pictures in SmartArt
Diagram. You can toggle this button on or off. When the button is toggled on, it applies a color
tint to any pictures that are part of the diagram.
Manually Applying Colors and Effects
to Individual Shapes
In addition to formatting the entire diagram with a SmartArt Style, you can also format individ-
ual shapes using Shape Styles, just as you did in Chapter 10 with drawn objects. Here’s a quick
review:
1.
Select a shape in a SmartArt diagram.
2.
On the SmartArt Tools Format tab, select a shape style from the Shape Styles gallery.
3.
(Optional) Fine-tune the style by using the Shape Fill, Shape Outline, and/or Shape Effects
buttons, and their associated menus.
326

Chapter 11: Creating SmartArt Diagrams
FIGURE 11-21
Select a color scheme from the Change Colors button’s menu.
Manually Formatting the Diagram Text
WordArt formatting works the same in a SmartArt diagram as it does everywhere else in Power-
Point. Use the WordArt Styles gallery and controls on the SmartArt Tools Format tab to apply
text formatting to individual shapes, or select the entire diagram to apply the changes to all
shapes at once. See Chapter 10 for more information about using WordArt Styles.
Making a Shape Larger or Smaller
In some diagram types, it is advantageous to make certain shapes larger or smaller than the oth-
ers. For example, if you want to emphasize a certain step in a process, you can create a diagram
where that step’s shape is larger. Then you can repeat that same diagram on a series of slides, but
with a different step in the process enlarged on each copy, to step through the process. There are
several options for this:
 You can manually resize a shape by dragging its selection handles, the same as with any
other object. However, this is imprecise, and can be a problem if you want multiple shapes
to be enlarged because they won’t be consistently so.
 You can set a precise size for the entire diagram by adjusting the height and width mea-
surements in the Size group on the Format tab, as shown in Figure 11-22. However, if
different shapes are already different sizes, and you want to resize them in proportion, this
won’t help.
327

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
 You can use the Larger or Smaller buttons on the Format tab to bump up or down the sizes
of one or more shapes slightly with each successive click.
FIGURE 11-22

shape or group

Resizing the Entire SmartArt Graphic Object
When you resize the entire SmartArt object as a whole, everything within its frame changes size
proportionally. There are several ways to do this:
 Drag and drop a corner selection handle on the SmartArt graphic’s outer frame.
 Use the Size controls on the SmartArt Tools Format tab to enter a precise height and width.
 Right-click the outer frame of the SmartArt and choose Size and Position. The Format
Shape dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 11-23; on the Size tab, enter a height and
width in inches, or scale it by a percentage in the Scale box. Select the Lock Aspect Ratio
check box if you want to maintain the proportions.
Editing in 2-D
If you choose one of the 3-D selections from the SmartArt Style gallery, the text might become
a bit hard to read and edit when you are working with the diagram at a small zoom percentage.
There are a couple of ways around this:
 Right-click a shape and choose Edit Text. The face of the shape appears in 2-D temporarily,
making it easier to edit the text.
 Click the Edit in 2-D button on the SmartArt Tools Format tab. The entire diagram appears
in 2-D temporarily.
Warning
Even though the face of the shape appears in 2-D, which you think would make it easier to read, in some
diagram types and styles the text might still be fuzzy and hard to read. You might be better off editing it in
the Text pane. ■
328

Chapter 11: Creating SmartArt Diagrams
FIGURE 11-23
Right-click the graphic and choose Size and Position to open this dialog box.
Changing the Shapes Used in the Diagram
Each SmartArt layout has its own defaults that it uses for the shapes, but you can change these
manually. On the SmartArt Tools Format tab, click Change Shape to open a palette of shapes,
just like the ones you learned to work with in Chapter 10. Then click the desired shape to apply
to the selected shape. You can also access this from the right-click menu.
Each shape is individually conﬁgurable. If you simply select the entire diagram, the Change
Shape button is not available; you must select each shape you want to change. Hold down the
Shift key as you click on each one to be selected. Figure 11-24 shows a diagram that uses some
different shapes.
FIGURE 11-24
You can apply different shapes within a SmartArt diagram.
329

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Saving a SmartArt Diagram as a Picture
SmartArt diagrams work only within Ofﬁce applications, but you can easily export one for use
in any other application. It is exported as a graphic (by default a .png ﬁle), which you can
then import into any application that accepts graphics. To save a diagram as a picture, follow
these steps:
1.
Select the outer frame of the SmartArt graphic object.
2.
Right-click the frame and choose Save as Picture. The Save as Picture dialog box opens.
3.
(Optional) Open the Save as Type list and select a different ﬁle type if desired.
Tip
PowerPoint can save graphics in GIF, JPEG, TIFF, PNG, BMP, WMF, and EMF formats. Different formats
have different qualities and advantages. EMF and WMF can be ungrouped, but not the other formats. EMF
does not result in a quality loss when resized, but most of the others do. JPG doesn’t use a transparent
background, but PNG does. ■
Summary
In this chapter, you learned how to create SmartArt diagrams. You learned how to select a dia-
gram type, how to rearrange shapes in a diagram, how to apply formatting, and how to export
diagrams as artwork you can use in other programs. You will probably ﬁnd lots of creative uses
for diagrams now that you know they’re available!
In the next chapter, you’ll learn how to incorporate clip art, both from Microsoft and from other
sources. You’ll ﬁnd out how to organize an artwork library using the Clip Organizer and how to
import your own clips.

lip art is pre-drawn art that comes with PowerPoint or that is
available from other sources (such as through the Internet). There
are thousands of images that you can use royalty-free in your work,
without having to draw your own. For example, suppose you are creating a
presentation about snow skiing equipment. Rather than hiring an artist to
draw a picture of a skier, you can use one of PowerPoint’s stock drawings of
skiers and save yourself a bundle.
Being an owner of a Microsoft Ofﬁce product entitles you to the use of the
huge clip art collection that Microsoft maintains on its Web site, and if you
are connected to the Internet while you are using PowerPoint, PowerPoint
can automatically pull clips from that collection as easily as it can from your
own hard drive. You can also use the Clip Organizer to catalog and organize
artwork in a variety of other formats, including photos that you scan, photos
that you take with your digital camera, and drawings and pictures that you
acquire from the Internet and from other people.
In this chapter you learn how to select and insert clip art in your presenta-
tions, how to integrate photos and images from other sources into the Clip
Organizer, and how to organize your clips for easy access.
Choosing Appropriate Clip Art
Don’t just use any old image! You must never use clip art simply because you
can; it must be a well-thought-out decision. Here are some tips for using clip
art appropriately:
 Use for fun: Use cartoonish images only if you speciﬁcally want to
impart a lighthearted, fun feel to your presentation.
331

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
 Use one style: The clip art included with Ofﬁce has many styles of drawings, ranging
from simple black-and-white shapes to very complex, shaded color drawings and pho-
tographs. Try to stick with one type of image rather than bouncing among several drawing
styles.
 Use only one piece per slide: Also, do not use clip art on every slide, or it becomes
overpowering.
 Avoid repetition: Don’t repeat the same clip art on more than one slide in the presenta-
tion unless you have a speciﬁc reason to do so.
 Avoid with bad news: If your message is very serious, or you are conveying bad news,
don’t use clip art. It looks frivolous in these situations.
 Better none than bad: If you can’t ﬁnd clip art that is exactly right for the slide, then don’t
use any. It is better to have none than to have an inappropriate image.
 Buy appropriate art: If clip art is important, and Ofﬁce doesn’t have what you want, you
can buy more. Don’t try to struggle along with the clips that come with Ofﬁce if it isn’t
meeting your needs; impressive clip art collections are available at reasonable prices at your
local computer store, as well as online.
About the Clip Organizer
The Clip Organizer is a Microsoft utility that you access from within an Ofﬁce application such
as PowerPoint. It organizes and catalogs artwork of various types. The primary type is clip art,
but it can also hold sounds, videos, and photos. All of the Microsoft-provided clip art is auto-
matically included in the Clip Organizer, including links to online Microsoft clip art; you can
also add your own clips from your hard disk. Most of the Microsoft clip art is online, rather than
stored locally, so you will need Internet access to use it.
The Clip Organizer has two main interfaces. When you use the Clip Art command on the Insert
tab, you work with the Clip Art task pane, and clips that you select are inserted onto the active
slide, as shown in the section ‘‘Inserting Clip Art on a Slide.’’ When you use the Clip Orga-
nizer utility separately, you must copy and paste the clip art into the presentation using the
Clipboard.
Depending on what you are inserting, you might also encounter other interfaces that access the
Clip Organizer, such as interfaces for choosing custom bullet characters, which are also stored as
clip art.
Inserting Clip Art on a Slide
You can insert clip art on a slide either with or without a content placeholder. If you use
a content placeholder, PowerPoint inserts the clip art wherever the placeholder is; if you
don’t, PowerPoint inserts the clip art at the center of the slide. (You can move it afterward, of
course.)
332

Chapter 12: Using and Organizing Clip Art
Tip
Most clip art ﬁles in Microsoft Ofﬁce applications have a .wmf extension, which stands for Windows
Metaﬁle. WMF is a vector graphic format, which means that it is composed of mathematical formulas
rather than individual pixels. This allows you to resize it without distortion and keeps the ﬁle size very
small. Some other clip art ﬁles are Enhanced Metaﬁle (.emf) ﬁles, which are like WMF ﬁles but with some
improvements. The Clip Organizer can also organize bitmap graphic ﬁles (that is, graphics composed of
individual pixels of color), as you see later in this chapter. However, there are some editing activities
through PowerPoint that you can perform only on WMF and EMF ﬁles. ■
To ﬁnd and insert a piece of clip art, follow these steps:
1.
(Recommended) If you want to include Web collections when searching for clip art, make
sure that you are connected to the Internet. Otherwise, you are limited to the clip art on
your local hard disk.
2.
On the Insert tab, click Clip Art. The Clip Art pane appears. Alternatively, you can click
the Clip Art icon in a content placeholder.
3.
Make sure the Include Ofﬁce.com Content check box is marked in the Clip Art pane.
4.
In the Search For text box, type the subject keyword that you want to search for.
5.
(Optional) Narrow down the types of results that you want, using the Results Should Be
list. For example, select only Illustrations (not photographs, videos, or audio) to ﬁnd only
clip art.
6.
Click Go. The matching clip art appears, as shown in Figure 12-1.

7.
Click the clip art that you want to insert. It appears on the slide.
8.
Edit the image, for example, by resizing or moving it, as explained later in this chapter.
Clip Art Search Methods
Now that you’ve seen the basic process for searching for a clip by keyword, let’s look at some
ways to ﬁne-tune those results so that you can more easily ﬁnd what you want.
Using Multiple Keywords
If you enter multiple keywords in the Search For text box of the Clip Art pane, only clips that
contain all of the entered keywords appear in the search results. You can simply type the words
separated by spaces; you do not have to use any special symbols or punctuation in order to use
multiple keywords.
Specify Which Media File Types to Find
Besides true clip art (WMF and EMF ﬁles), you can also ﬁnd videos, audio clips, and pho-
tographs using the Clip Art pane. You can learn more about each of these media types in later
chapters, but let’s take a quick look here at how to include them in searches. To ﬁlter results by
media type (or to enable additional media types), follow these steps:
1.
From the Clip Art pane, open the Results Should Be drop-down list. A list of media types
appears.
2.
Select or deselect check boxes for media types that you want to include or exclude, respec-
tively. See Figure 12-2.
FIGURE 12-2
Narrow the search for a clip to certain ﬁle types by only selecting check boxes for the media types
that you want.

Chapter 12: Using and Organizing Clip Art
Note
You can drag the left edge of the Clip Art task pane to the left to widen the pane so you can see more clips
at once. ■
Work with Found Clips
Each of the clips found by the clip art search has its own menu. You can open the menu by
right-clicking the clip, or by pointing at it with the mouse, so that an arrow button appears to
its right, and then clicking that arrow. Figure 12-3 shows an example menu.
FIGURE 12-3
Right-click a clip, or click its arrow button, for a menu of commands that apply to that clip.
The commands available include:
 Insert: Inserts the clip on the active slide. This is the same as clicking the clip, which also
inserts it.
 Copy: Copies the clip to the Clipboard. You can then paste it (Ctrl+V) onto any slide.
 Delete from Clip Organizer: Available only if the clip is stored on your hard disk;
removes it from your hard disk. The clip may still be available online, so it may continue
to show up in searches if you allow Ofﬁce.com to be searched. See ‘‘Deleting Clips from
the Clip Organizer’’ later in this chapter.
 Make Available Ofﬂine: Stores a copy of the clip on your hard disk. This enables you to
re-access it when you are not connected to the Internet, and also to change the clip’s prop-
erties and keywords. See the section ‘‘Making Clips Available Ofﬂine’’ later in this chapter.
 Move to Collection: Available only if the clip is stored on your hard disk; it places the clip
in another clip collection. See the section ‘‘Moving Clips Between Collections’’ later in this
chapter.
335

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
 Edit Keywords: Available only if the clip is stored on your hard disk. It enables you to
change the keywords assigned to the clip, which affects what searches it can be found with.
See the section ‘‘Working with Clip Keywords and Information’’ later in this chapter.
 Preview/Properties: Opens the Preview/Properties dialog box, from which you can see a
complete list of the clip’s keywords, determine its ﬁle name and size, and see a large-size
preview of it. See Figure 12-4. This information is read-only if the clip is online; some of it
can be changed if the clip is stored on your hard disk.
FIGURE 12-4

Working with Clip Art Collections
The Clip Organizer is an external utility (separate from PowerPoint) that manages clips, including
enabling you to organize them into various collections and categories and making them available
when you are ofﬂine. You can use the Clip Organizer to browse entire clip collections by subject,
regardless of keyword. It also manages clips of other types, including bitmap images (such as
scanned photos), sounds, and video clips. In the following sections, you learn how to browse,
categorize, and organize clips in the Clip Organizer, as well as how to add clips to it.
336

Chapter 12: Using and Organizing Clip Art
Opening and Browsing the Clip Organizer
To open the Clip Organizer, choose Start ➪All Programs ➪Microsoft Ofﬁce ➪Microsoft Ofﬁce
2010 Tools ➪Microsoft Clip Organizer.
Clip art is stored in collections, which are logical groupings of artwork arranged by subject or
location. The Collection List pane lists the three default collections:
 Ofﬁce Collections: These are the clips that came with Microsoft Ofﬁce 2010.
 My Collections: These include any clips that you have marked as favorites, as well as any
uncategorized clips. They also include any clips that you have added through the Clip
Organizer, any downloaded clips, and any clips shared from a network drive.
 Web Collections: These are clip collections that are available online via Microsoft. This is
by far the largest collection, but you must be connected to the Internet in order to access it.
All of the clips from this collection appear with a little globe icon in the corner when you
preview them in the task pane.
Within each of these collections are nested folders, or sub-collections, containing clips.
To expand or collapse a folder, double-click it, or click the plus or minus sign to its left.
Figure 12-5 shows the three top-level collections, with My Collections expanded.
FIGURE 12-5
You can browse clip art by collection, as well as by category within a collection.
Note
The physical location of the Ofﬁce Collections clips is
Program Files\Microsoft Office\MEDIA\
CAGCAT10. However, users don’t normally need to know this because PowerPoint manages the locations
of the clip art automatically. ■
337

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
The My Collections group contains these collections by default:
 Favorites: This is where clips are placed when you make them available ofﬂine. (This is
covered in the section ‘‘Making Clips Available Ofﬂine.’’)
 Unclassiﬁed Clips: This is where clips are placed when they are manually added to
the Clip Organizer. (This is covered in the section ‘‘Working with Clip Keywords and
Information.’’)
 Downloaded Clips: This category appears only if you have downloaded one or more clips
from Ofﬁce.com. If you have, all the downloaded clips appear here. Downloading clips is
covered in the section ‘‘Browsing for More Clips on Ofﬁce.com.’’)
You can add more folders to My Collections, as well as more clips. It is the only collection
that you can modify. Ofﬁce Collections contains collections that Microsoft provides and stores
on your hard disk. The Web Collections group contains collections that you access through the
Internet.
Using the Clip Organizer to Insert Clip Art
As you saw at the beginning of this chapter, when you insert clip art from the Clip Art pane,
you cannot browse for it. You can only search based on keywords. If you would rather peruse
the available clip art in a more leisurely fashion, you can open the Clip Organizer to do so.
The Clip Organizer is not really designed for easy insertion of clips into a presentation, but it is
possible to do this using the Clipboard. To select a clip from the Clip Organizer for insertion in
your presentation, do the following:
1.
Open the Clip Organizer, as you learned to do in the previous section.
2.
Make sure that Collection List, and not Search, is selected on the toolbar. Click Collection
List if necessary.
3.
Click the collection that you want to browse. The Clip Organizer displays the available
clips.
4.
When you ﬁnd the clip that you want to insert, right-click it and choose Copy.
5.
Close or minimize the Clip Organizer.
6.
Display the slide in PowerPoint on which you want to place the clip, and then press
Ctrl+V to paste. Alternatively, you can drag and drop clips from the Clip Organizer
window onto a PowerPoint slide.
Creating and Deleting Folders
Each folder in the Clip Organizer represents a collection (or a sub-collection within a collection).
The folders that you create are placed in the My Collections group, and you can place clips into
a collection or sub-collection by dragging and dropping them into the desired folder. To create a
folder in the Clip Organizer, follow these steps:
1.
Choose File ➪New Collection. The New Collection dialog box opens, as shown in
Figure 12-6.
338

Chapter 12: Using and Organizing Clip Art
FIGURE 12-6
You can create new collection folders.
2.
In the Name text box, type a name for the new collection.
3.
To create a top-level collection, click My Collections. To create a folder within a collec-
tion, click that collection within My Collections.
4.
Click OK. The Clip Organizer creates the new folder.
To delete a folder, right-click it and choose Delete foldername, where foldername is the name of
the folder.
Moving Clips Between Collections
A clip can exist in multiple collections simultaneously; only one copy actually exists on your
hard disk, but pointers to it can appear in multiple places. When you drag a clip from one
collection to another, you are actually making a copy of its pointer to the new location. The
shortcut to the clip is not removed from the original collection. You can delete a clip from a
collection by right-clicking it and choosing Delete, or pressing the Delete key.
Cataloging Clips
There are probably images elsewhere on your PC that you would like to use in PowerPoint
besides the Microsoft Ofﬁce clip art collection. For example, perhaps you have some scanned
photos or some clip art that you have downloaded from a Web site that offers free clips. If
you need to use this downloaded clip art only once or twice, you can simply insert it with the
Picture button on the Insert tab. However, if you want to use the clip art more often, you can
add it to your Clip Organizer. Adding to the Clip Organizer gives you the advantage of being
able to search for the image by keyword, which is useful if you have hundreds of photographs
to keep organized.
339

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
You can include images in all image formats in the Clip Organizer, not just the default
format that PowerPoint’s clip art uses. The image formats that PowerPoint supports are shown in
Table 12-1.
TABLE 12-1

The Clip Organizer is not only for clip art, but also for scanned and digital camera photos, video
clips, and sound clips. It can accept many sound and video formats.
Cross-Reference
You will work with the clip organizer further in Chapters 16 and 17, which deal with sound and video. ■
Adding a clip to the Clip Organizer does not physically move the clip; it simply creates a link to
it in the Clip Organizer so that the clip is included when you search or browse for clips.
Note
Any clips that you add are placed in My Collections; you cannot add clips to the Ofﬁce Collections or Web
Collections categories. This is the case whether you add them automatically or manually. ■
Caution
Some earlier versions of Ofﬁce stored the local collection of clip art in a different place. For
example, Ofﬁce XP stored this collection in
Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft
Shared\Clipart\Catcat50. By default, the clip art in this old location does not appear in the
collections for Ofﬁce 2003 and higher. The only way to import it into the Clip Organizer is by manually
cataloging it, as described here. ■
To add one or more clips, do the following:
1.
From the Clip Organizer window, choose File ➪Add Clips to Organizer ➪On My Own.
The Add Clips to Organizer window appears.
340

Chapter 12: Using and Organizing Clip Art
2.
Navigate to the clips that you want to add. They can be in a local, network, or Internet
location.
3.
Select the clips. To select more than one clip, hold down the Shift key to select a contigu-
ous group or the Ctrl key to select a non-contiguous group.
4.
Click the Add To button (not the Add button). A list of the existing collections in the Clip
Organizer appears, as shown in Figure 12-7.
5.
Select the collection in which you want to place the new clips, and click OK.
If you would rather create a new clip collection:
a. Click My Collections and then click New.
b. Type a name for the new collection.
c. Click OK.
Then select the new folder on the list and click OK.
6.
Click the Add button. The Clip Organizer adds the clips to the speciﬁed collection.
FIGURE 12-7
You can specify the location to which you want to add the clips.
Working with CIL or MPF Files
Occasionally, you might encounter a ﬁle that claims to be clip art but that has a .cil or .mpf
extension. Both of these are clip art ‘‘package’’ formats that Microsoft has used to bundle and
transfer clip art at one time or another. MPF is the newer format for Ofﬁce XP and higher; CIL
is the older format for Ofﬁce 97 and 2000.
These packages are executable, which means that executing them copies the art to the Clip
Organizer. When you ﬁnd one of these ﬁles, you can choose to run it rather than save it to
immediately extract its clips, or you can download the ﬁle and then double-click it to extract the
clip art from it later.
341

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Deleting Clips from the Clip Organizer
To remove a graphic — or even an entire folder — from your Clip Organizer, right-click it and
choose Delete. This does not delete the pictures from the hard disk; it simply removes its refer-
ence from the Clip Organizer. You can also delete individual clips in the same way.
Inserting an Image from a Scanner
If you have a scanner or digital camera, you can use it from within the Clip Organizer to scan
a picture and store it there. In PowerPoint 2010, this is the only way to access the Scanner and
Camera Wizard, because that functionality is no longer in the main PowerPoint application. To
scan a picture into the Clip Organizer, do the following:
1.
Make sure your scanner is ready. Place the picture that you want to scan on the scanner
glass.
2.
From the Clip Organizer, choose File ➪Add Clips to Organizer ➪From Scanner or
Camera.
3.
Select the scanner from the Device list. See Figure 12-8.
4.
Choose a quality: Web quality (low) or Print quality (high).
5.
To scan using default settings, click Insert. To adjust the settings further, click Custom
Insert, change the settings, and then click Scan.
FIGURE 12-8
Choose a scanner or camera form which to insert the clip.
The scanned clip appears in the My Collections collection, in a folder with the same name as the
device (in this case, the scanner’s make and model). From there, you can assign keywords to the
clip to make it easier to ﬁnd, as explained in the next section.
Tip
On a Windows Vista or Windows 7 system, the scanned ﬁle is located in the
Pictures\Microsoft
Clip Organizer folder on your hard disk, in case you want to use it in some other application that does
not support the Clip Organizer. It is assigned a ﬁlename that begins with mso (for example, mso414611),
and it is saved in JPEG format. Under Windows XP, it is located in
My Pictures\Microsoft Clip
Organizer. ■
342

Chapter 12: Using and Organizing Clip Art
Caution
Good-quality scanners can scan at 600 dpi or more, but for use in PowerPoint, an image doesn’t need to
be any higher resolution than 96 dpi, the resolution of a monitor. Excessive resolution when scanning is one
reason why graphics take up so much space. If you want to use an image in PowerPoint that has already
been scanned and has a high resolution, consider opening it in a graphics program and reducing its resolu-
tion before importing it into PowerPoint. ■
Making Clips Available Ofﬂine
Most of the clips that appear in the Clip Organizer are not on your local hard disk; they are
online. This means that you do not have access to them when you are not connected to the
Internet. If you ﬁnd some clip art in the Clip Organizer that you want to have available ofﬂine,
you can add the clip to your local hard disk, as follows:
1.
In the Clip Organizer or the Clip Art pane, open the menu of the clip that you want (the
arrow to its right) and choose Make Available Ofﬂine. The Copy to Collection dialog box
opens.
If the Make Available Ofﬂine command is not present, it means that this clip is already on
your local hard disk.
2.
Select the collection in which you want to place the clip. (You can also click New to create
a new collection.) Then click OK.
Strategies for Organizing Your Clips
To use the Clip Organizer most effectively, you need to put some thought into how you want to
structure your collections. There are several ways to organize the My Collections group, and each
method has its pros and cons:
 By location: This is how the automatic cataloging sets up your collection. Pros: You can
browse all of the clips in a location at once. Cons: The clips are not grouped logically
according to content.
 By topic: You can create folders for various subjects, such as agriculture, animals, busi-
ness, and so on, similar to the Ofﬁce Collections and Web Collections. Pros: It is easy to
ﬁnd clips for a certain subject. Cons: There is no differentiation between media types.
 By media type: You can create folders for various media types, such as clip art, pictures,
sounds, and videos. Pros: You do not have to wade through a lot of clips of the wrong ﬁle
type to ﬁnd what you want. For example, you do not have to look through clip art to ﬁnd
sounds, and vice versa. Cons: When creating a presentation, you usually have a topic in
mind before a media type.
Tip
Perhaps the best solution if you have a lot of clips is to combine the topic and media-type methods. You
can organize ﬁrst by topic, and then within topic into separate folders by media type, or you can organize
ﬁrst by media type and then by topic within those folders. ■
To change the organization method of your Clip Organizer window from location-based to topic-
or type-based, you can create new folders and then drag clips into the new folders. The Clip
343

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Organizer only copies the shortcuts there — it does not move them there — and so they remain
in their location-based folders, as well. You can either leave these location-based folders in place
for extra ﬂexibility, or you can delete them.
Working with Clip Keywords and Information
Any clips you add to the Clip Organizer must be assigned keywords so they will show up when
you do a search by keyword in the Clip Art pane.
You can edit the keywords and information only for clips stored on your own hard disk, not
for clips stored online. That’s because the online collection is shared by all Ofﬁce users. If you
want to re-keyword an online clip, copy it to your hard disk ﬁrst and then work with that
copy.
When you add a clip to the Clip Organizer, a few keywords are automatically assigned.
Speciﬁcally, every folder within the path is assigned as a keyword, as is the ﬁle
extension. For example, suppose that the clip
Downy.jpg is cataloged from the
C:\Users\FaitheLaptop\Pictures\Fractals folder. It will have the following key-
words pre-assigned: Fractals, Pictures, FaitheLaptop, Users, and jpg. However, these keywords
are not very helpful when you want to locate the clip by subject, and so you will want to add
some content-based keywords, as well.
Changing the Keywords for an Individual Clip
To modify a clip’s keywords and information, do the following:
1.
From the Clip Organizer, right-click the clip (or click the down arrow to its right) and
choose Edit Keywords.
2.
The default caption for the clip is the ﬁlename. You can change it to a more meaningful
caption in the Caption text box. This caption will appear in some views as well as any-
where that an application automatically pulls a caption.
3.
To add a keyword for the clip, type the new keywords in the Keyword text box and click
Add, as shown in Figure 12-9.
4.
To remove a keyword, click the keyword on the list and click Delete.
5.
When you ﬁnish changing the clip’s keywords and caption, click OK to close the dialog
box, or click the Previous or Next button to move to a different clip in the same folder.
Changing the Keywords for Multiple Clips at Once
You can modify multiple clips at once by selecting multiple clips before you right-click (step 1 in
the preceding steps). When you select multiple clips, the All Clips at Once tab becomes available
in the Keywords dialog box. From there, you can add keywords that apply to all of the selected
clips.
344

Chapter 12: Using and Organizing Clip Art
FIGURE 12-9
You can add or delete keywords for a clip.
Browsing for More Clips on Ofﬁce.com
When you browse for clip art while connected to the Internet, the Ofﬁce.com clip art automati-
cally appears. However, you can also visit the Ofﬁce.com Web site to browse the clip art directly.
To open a Web browser window for the Ofﬁce.com clip art gallery, do one of the following:
 Open a Web browser window and navigate to http://office.microsoft.com and
click the Images link.
 From the Clip Organizer window, click the Clips Online toolbar button.
 From the Clip Art task pane, click Find More at Ofﬁce.com.
Either way, the same Web page displays (provided you have Internet access). It contains infor-
mation about clip art, links to art collections, featured clips, and more. It is constantly changing,
but Figure 12-10 shows how it looked on the day I visited.
If you have a full-time Internet connection, there is little reason to download clips to your
hard disk from the Ofﬁce Online Web site because your clip art search by keyword will always
include this Web site. However, if your Internet connection is not always active, you might
want to download the clips you need in advance so that they will be available when you need
them.

From the Web page shown in Figure 12-10, type a keyword in the Search box and press
Enter.
2.
In the list of clips that the site ﬁnds, point to a clip that you want. A pop-up menu for it
appears, as shown in Figure 12-11.
3.
Click Add to Basket. The clip appears in a Selection Basket pop-up in the upper-right
corner of the page. See Figure 12-12. You can hover the mouse over the words ‘‘Selection
Basket’’ to make this pop-up reappear if it goes away.
4.
Repeat steps 2 and 3 as needed to select more clips. Then click Selection Basket to see the
clips you have selected.
5.
Click the Download hyperlink below the clip images. The clips download and links for
them are created in the Clip Organizer.

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Modifying Clip Art
Most of the modiﬁcations that you will learn about in Chapter 13 apply to both photographs and
clip art. For example, you can increase or decrease brightness and contrast, apply color washes,
crop, rotate, and so on. However, there are also some special modiﬁcations that apply only to
clip art and other vector images.
Recoloring a Clip
One of the top complaints about clip art is that the colors are wrong. For example, you may
have the perfect drawing, but its colors clash with your presentation design. In PowerPoint 2003,
you could change an individual color within a clip art image. PowerPoint 2007 and 2010 don’t
offer this capability, but you can recolor individual parts of a clip by changing it to a Microsoft
Drawing object and then selecting and coloring individual lines or shapes. For more information,
see the section ‘‘Deconstructing and Editing a Clip,’’ later in this chapter.
On a more basic level, PowerPoint 2010 provides a Recolor option that enables you to apply a
single-color wash to the image, based on any of the theme’s colors or any ﬁxed color. To apply a
color wash to a clip, follow these steps:
1.
Select the clip that you want to recolor. The Picture Tools Format tab becomes available.
2.
On the Picture Tools Format tab, click Color to open the menu shown in Figure 12-13.
FIGURE 12-13
Select a color wash to apply to the clip.
348

Chapter 12: Using and Organizing Clip Art
3.
Click the color wash that you want to apply, or click More Variations to choose another
color.
Note
More Variations opens a palette from which you can select light and dark tints of the theme colors or
standard (ﬁxed) colors. You can also choose More Colors to open a Color dialog box for more ﬁxed
colors. ■
Setting a Transparent Color
Some clips enable you to redeﬁne one of the colors as see-through, so that anything behind it
shows through. This doesn’t work on all clips because most clips already have a color deﬁned
as transparent: the background. This is why a clip art image appears to ﬂoat directly on a col-
ored background rather than being locked into a rectangle. However, for clips that do not have
a transparent color already deﬁned, you can deﬁne one.
Caution
Setting a transparent color works best on clip art; in a photograph, an area that looks at ﬁrst glance like a
single color is often actually dozens of different shades of the same overall tint, and setting the transparent
color sets only one of those many shades to be transparent. ■
To set a transparent color, open the Color menu, as in the preceding section (Figure 12-13).
Then choose Set Transparent Color, and click a color in the image.
Deconstructing and Editing a Clip
Have you ever wished that you could open a clip art image in an image-editing program and
make some small change to it? Well, you can. And what’s more, you can do it without leaving
PowerPoint.
Because clip art is composed of vector-graphic lines and ﬁlls, you can literally take it apart piece
by piece. Not only can you apply certain colors (as in the preceding section), but you can also
choose individual lines and shapes from it to recolor, move, and otherwise modify.
To deconstruct a piece of clip art, follow these steps:
1.
After placing the clip on a slide, right-click the clip and choose Edit Picture. A message
appears, telling you that it is an imported picture, and asking whether you want to convert
it to a Microsoft Ofﬁce drawing object.
Caution
Ungrouping a clip resets previous color adjustments you may have made. ■
2.
Click Yes. Each individual shape and line in the clip is now a separate object that you can
select individually.
349

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
To recolor an individual line or shape, follow these steps:
1.
Select the line or shape. Selection handles appear around it.
2.
On the Format tab, click Shape Fill and select a ﬁll color. See Figure 12-14.
3.
Click Shape Outline and select an outline color.
FIGURE 12-14
Change the ﬁll color of an individual shape within the clip.
Select a shape within
the clip and recolor it
To move the pieces of the clip around, follow these steps:
1.
Right-click the clip and choose Group ➪Ungroup. All of the individual shapes show their
own separate selection handles, as shown in Figure 12-15.
350

Chapter 12: Using and Organizing Clip Art
FIGURE 12-15
You can break apart a clip art image into separate shapes.
Note
In some cases you do not have to ungroup in order to move an individual piece; you can try moving a piece
without performing step 1 and see if that works for you. ■
2.
Click away from the selected shapes to deselect them all, and then click the individual
shape that you want to move. Hold down the Ctrl key and click multiple shapes, if
needed.
3.
Drag the shape where you want it.
Summary
In this chapter, you learned how to insert and manage clip art and how to modify it in
PowerPoint. You learned how to organize your clips in the Clip Organizer and how to ﬁnd more
clips online. You learned how to recolor a clip, and even how to break it down into individual
pieces and modify each piece. In the next chapter, you learn how to work with photographic
images, which present their own set of challenges in terms of ﬁle size, resolution, cropping,
and more.

W
hether you’re putting together a slide show to display your
vacation photos or adding photos of industrial products to a
business presentation, PowerPoint has the tools and capabilities
you need. And with the Picture Styles feature in PowerPoint 2010, it has
never been easier to give those photos professional-looking frames, shadows,
picture styles, and artistic effects.
In this chapter you’ll learn the ins and outs of using photographs in a
PowerPoint presentation, including tips and tricks for preparing them
beforehand, compressing them so they take up less disk space, and
exporting pictures out of PowerPoint so you can save them separately.
Understanding Raster Graphics
There are two kinds of graphics in the computer world: vector and raster. As
you learned earlier in the book, vector graphics (clip art, drawn lines and
shapes, and so on) are created with mathematical formulas. Some of the
advantages of vector graphics are their small ﬁle size and the fact that they
can be resized without losing any quality. The main disadvantage of a vec-
tor graphic is that it doesn’t look ‘‘real.’’ Even when an expert artist draws
a vector graphic, you can still tell that it’s a drawing, not a photograph.
For example, perhaps you’ve seen the game The Sims. Those characters and
objects are 3-D vector graphics. They look pretty good but there’s no way
you would mistake them for real people and objects.
In this chapter, you’ll be working with raster graphics. A raster graphic is
made up of a very ﬁne grid of individual colored pixels (dots). The grid is
sometimes called a bitmap. Each pixel has a unique numeric value repre-
senting its color. Figure 13-1 shows a close-up of a raster image. You can
353

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
create raster graphics from scratch with a ‘‘paint’’ program on a computer, but a more common
way to acquire a raster graphic is by using a scanner or digital camera as an input device.
FIGURE 13-1
A raster graphic, normal size (right) and zoomed in to show individual pixels (left).
Note
The term bitmap is sometimes used to refer generically to any raster graphic, but it is also a speciﬁc ﬁle
format for raster graphics, with a BMP extension. This is the default format for the Paint program that
comes with Windows XP and Windows XP desktop wallpaper. (The Windows 7 and Windows Vista versions
of Paint use a different format, .png, as the default.) ■
Because there are so many individual pixels and each one must be represented numerically,
raster graphics are much larger than vector graphics. They take longer to load into the PC’s
memory, take up more space when you store them as separate ﬁles on disk, and make your
PowerPoint presentation ﬁle much larger. You can compress a raster graphic so that it takes up
less space on disk, but the quality may suffer. Therefore, it’s best to use vector graphics when
354

Chapter 13: Working with Photographic Images
you want simple lines, shapes, or cartoons and reserve raster graphics for situations where you
need photographic quality.
The following sections explain some of the technical speciﬁcations behind raster graphics; you’ll
need this information to make the right decisions about the way you capture the images with
your scanner or digital camera, and the way you use them in PowerPoint.
Resolution
The term resolution has two subtly different meanings. One is the size of an image, expressed in
the number of pixels of width and height, such as 800 x 600. The other meaning is the number
of pixels per inch when the image is printed, such as 100 dots per inch (dpi). The former mean-
ing is used mostly when referring to images of ﬁxed physical size, such as the display resolution
of a monitor. In this book, the later meaning is mostly used.
If you know the resolution of the picture (that is, the number of pixels in it), and the resolution
of the printer on which you will print it (for example, 300 dpi), you can ﬁgure out how large
the picture will be in inches when you print it at its native size. Suppose you have a picture that
is 900 pixels square, and you print it on a 300 dpi printer. This makes it 3 inches square on the
printout.
Resolution on Preexisting Graphics Files
When you acquire an image ﬁle from an outside source, such as downloading it from a Web
site or getting it from a CD of artwork, its resolution has already been determined. Whoever cre-
ated the ﬁle originally made that decision. For example, if the image was originally scanned on
a scanner, whoever scanned it chose the scan resolution — that is, the dpi setting. That deter-
mined how many individual pixels each inch of the original picture would be carved up into. At
a 100 dpi scan, each inch of the picture is represented by 100 pixels vertically and horizontally.
At 300 dpi, each inch of the picture is broken down into three times that many.
If you want to make a graphic take up less disk space, you can use an image-editing program to
change the image size, and/or you can crop off one or more sides of the image.
Caution
If you crop or decrease the size of an image in an image-editing program, save the changes under a dif-
ferent ﬁlename. Maintain the original image in case you ever need it for some other purpose. Decreasing
the image resolution decreases its dpi setting, which decreases its quality. You might not notice any quality
degradation on-screen, but you will probably notice a difference when you are printing the image at a large
size. That’s because the average monitor displays only 96 dpi, but the average printer prints at 600 dpi or
higher.
PowerPoint slides do not usually need to be printed at a professional-quality resolution, so image quality
on a PowerPoint printout is not usually an issue. However, if you use the picture for something else
later, such as printing it as a full-page color image on photo paper, then a high dpi ﬁle can make a
difference. ■

Resolution on Graphics You Scan Yourself
When you create an image ﬁle yourself by using a scanner, you choose the resolution, expressed
in dpi, through the scanner software. For example, suppose you scan a 4-inch by 6-inch photo
at 100 dpi. The scanner will break down each 1-inch section of the photo horizontally and ver-
tically into 100 separate pieces and decide on a numeric value that best represents the color
of each piece. The result is a total number of pixels of 4 x 100 x 6 x 100, or 240,000 pixels.
Assuming each pixel requires 3 bytes of storage, the ﬁll becomes approximately 720KB in size.
The actual size varies slightly depending on the ﬁle format.
Now, suppose you scan the same photo at 200 dpi. The scanner breaks down each 1-inch
section of the photo into 200 pieces, so that the result is 4 x 200 x 6 x 200, or 960,000 pixels.
Assuming again that 1 pixel required 3 bytes for storage (24 bits), the ﬁle will be approximately
2.9MB in size. That’s a big difference.
The higher the resolution in which you scan, the larger the ﬁle becomes, but the details of the
scan also become ﬁner. However, unless you are zooming in on the photo, you cannot tell a dif-
ference between 100 dpi and a higher resolution. That’s because most computer monitors display
at 96 dpi, so any resolution higher than that does not improve the output.
Let’s look at an example. In Figure 13-2 you can see two copies of an image open in a graphics
program. The same photo was scanned at 75 dpi (left) and 150 dpi (right). However, the differ-
ence between them is not signiﬁcant when the two images are placed on a PowerPoint slide, as
shown in Figure 13-3. The lower resolution image is at the top left, but there is no observable
difference in the size at which they are being used.
FIGURE 13-2
At high magniﬁcation, the difference in dpi for a scan is apparent.

Chapter 13: Working with Photographic Images
FIGURE 13-3
When the image is used at a normal size, there is virtually no difference between a high-dpi and
low-dpi scan.
75 dpi
150 dpi
Scanners and Color Depth
If you are shopping for a scanner, you will probably notice that they’re advertised with higher numbers
of bits than the graphics formats support. This is for error correction. If there are extra bits, it can throw
out the bad bits to account for ‘‘noise’’ and still end up with a full set of good bits. Error correction in a
scan is a rather complicated process, but fortunately your scanner driver software takes care of it for you.
Resolution on Digital Camera Photos
Top-quality digital cameras today take very high resolution pictures, and are much higher than
you will need for an on-screen PowerPoint presentation. At a typical size and magniﬁcation, a
high-resolution graphic ﬁle is overkill; it wastes disk space needlessly. Therefore, you may want to
adjust the camera’s image size so that it takes lower-resolution pictures for your PowerPoint show.
If you think you might want to use those same pictures for some other purpose in the future,
such as printing them in a magazine or newsletter, then go ahead and take them with the
camera’s highest setting, but you should compress them in PowerPoint or resize them in a
third-party image editing program. See the section ‘‘Compressing Images’’ later in this chapter to
learn how.
357

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Color Depth
Color depth is the number of bits required to describe the color of a single pixel in the image.
For example, in 1-bit color, a single binary digit represents each pixel. Each pixel is either black
(1) or white (0). In 4-bit color, there are 16 possible colors because there are 16 combinations of
1s and 0s in a four-digit binary number. In 8-bit color there are 256 combinations.
For most ﬁle formats, the highest number of colors you can have in an image is 16.7 million
colors, which is 24-bit color (also called true color). It uses 8 bits each for Red, Green, and Blue.
There is also 32-bit color, which has the same number of colors as 24-bit, but adds 8 more bits
for an alpha channel. The alpha channel describes the amount of transparency for each pixel.
This is not so much an issue for single-layer graphics, but in multilayer graphics, such as the
ones you can create in high-end graphics programs like Photoshop, the extent to which a lower
layer shows through an upper one is important.
Tip
For a great article on alpha channel usage in PowerPoint by Geetesh Bajaj, go to www.indezine.com/
products/powerpoint/ppalpha.html. ■
A color depth of 48-bit is fairly new, and it’s just like 24-bit color except it uses 16 rather than 8
bits to deﬁne each of the three channels: Red, Green, and Blue. It does not have an alpha chan-
nel bit. 48-bit color depth is not really necessary, because the human eye cannot detect the small
differences it introduces. Of the graphics formats that PowerPoint supports, only PNG and TIFF
support 48-bit color depth.
Normally, you should not decrease the color depth of a photo to less than 24-bit unless there
is a major issue with lack of disk space that you cannot resolve any other way. To decrease the
color depth, you would need to open the graphic ﬁle in a third-party image-editing program,
and use the command in that program for decreasing the number of colors. Before going through
that, try compressing the images in the presentation (see the section ‘‘Compressing Images’’ later
in the chapter) to see if that solves the problem.
File Format
Many scanners scan in JPEG format by default, but most also support TIF, and some also sup-
port other formats. Images you acquire from a digital camera are almost always JPEG. Images
from other sources may be any of dozens of graphics formats, including PCX, BMP, GIF, or
PNG.
Different graphic formats can vary tremendously in the size and quality of the image they pro-
duce. The main differentiators between formats are the color depth they support and the type of
compression they use (which determines the ﬁle size).
Remember earlier how I explained that each pixel in a 24-bit image requires 3 bytes? (That’s
derived by dividing 24 by 8 because there are 8 bits in a byte.) Then you multiply that by the
height, and then by the width, to determine the image size. Well, that formula was not com-
pletely accurate because it does not include compression. Compression is an algorithm (basi-
cally a math formula) that decreases the amount of space that the ﬁle takes up on the disk by
358

Chapter 13: Working with Photographic Images
storing the data about the pixels more compactly. A ﬁle format will have one of these three states
in regard to compression:
 No compression: The image is not compressed.
 Lossless compression: The image is compressed, but the algorithm for doing so does not
throw out any pixels so there is no loss of image quality when you resize the image.
 Lossy compression: The image is compressed by recording less data about the pixels, so
that when you resize the image there may be a loss of image quality.
Table 13-1 provides a brief guide to some of the most common graphics formats. Generally
speaking, for most on-screen presentations JPEG should be your preferred choice for graphics
because it is compact and Web-accessible (although PNG is also a good choice and uses lossless
compression).

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Tip
If you are not sure what format you will eventually use for an image, scan it in TIF format and keep the
TIF copy on your hard disk. You can always save a copy in JPEG or other formats when you need them for
speciﬁc projects. The TIF format’s compression is lossless, so it results in a high-quality image. ■
Importing Image Files into PowerPoint
Most of the choices you make regarding a raster image’s resolution, color depth, and ﬁle type
are done outside of PowerPoint. Consequently, by the time you’re ready to put them into
PowerPoint, the hard part is over.
Assuming you have already acquired the image, use the following steps to insert it into
PowerPoint:
1.
Display the slide on which you want to place the image.
2.
If the slide has a content placeholder for Insert Picture from File, as in Figure 13-4, click
it. Otherwise, click Picture on the Insert tab. The Insert Picture dialog box opens.
FIGURE 13-4
You can insert a picture by using the Insert Picture from File content placeholder icon.

3.
Select the picture to import. See Figure 13-5. You can switch the view by using the View
(or Views) button in the dialog box to see thumbnails or details if either is effective in
helping you determine which ﬁle is which.
4.
Click Insert. The picture is inserted.
Tip
If you have a lot of graphics in different formats, consider narrowing down the list that appears by selecting
a speciﬁc ﬁle type from the ﬁle type list. By default it is set to All Pictures, as in Figure 13-5. ■

Linking to a Graphic File
If you have a sharp eye, you may have noticed that the Insert button in Figure 13-5 has a
drop-down list associated with it. That list has these choices:
 Insert: The default, inserts the graphic but maintains no connection.
 Link to File: Creates a link to the ﬁle, but does not maintain a local copy of it in
PowerPoint.
 Insert and Link: Creates a link to the ﬁle, and also inserts a local copy of its current state,
so if the linked copy is not available in the future, the local copy will still appear.
Use Link to File whenever you want to insert a pointer rather than the original. When the
presentation opens, it pulls in the graphic from the disk. If the graphic is not available, it
displays an empty frame with a red X in the corner in the graphic’s place. Using Link to File
keeps the size of the original PowerPoint ﬁle very small because it doesn’t actually contain the
graphics — it only links to them. However, if you move or delete the graphic, PowerPoint won’t
be able to ﬁnd it anymore.
361

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
The important thing to know about this link in the Link to File feature is that it is not the same
thing as an OLE link. This is not a dynamic link that you can manage. It is a much simpler link
and much less ﬂexible. You can’t change the ﬁle location to which it is linked, for example; if
the location of the graphic changes, you must delete it from PowerPoint and reinsert it.
Tip
If you are building a graphic-heavy presentation on an older computer, you might ﬁnd that it takes a long
time to move between slides and for each graphic to appear. You can take some of the hassle away by
using Link to File instead of inserting the graphics. Then temporarily move the graphic ﬁles to a subfolder
so PowerPoint can’t ﬁnd them. It displays the placeholders for the graphics on the appropriate slides, and
the presentation ﬁle is much faster to page through and edit. Then when you are ready to ﬁnish up, close
PowerPoint and move the graphics ﬁles back to their original locations so PowerPoint can ﬁnd them again
when you reopen the presentation ﬁle. ■
Acquiring Images from a Scanner
If you have a compatible scanner attached to your PC, you can scan a picture directly
into the Clip Organizer (which you learned about in Chapter 12), and from there import it into
PowerPoint. You can also use the scanner’s interface from outside of PowerPoint (and outside of
the Clip Organizer).
Note
Earlier versions of PowerPoint had direct access to the Scanner and Camera Wizard, but PowerPoint 2010
does not have this. The only way to access the Scanner and Camera Wizard in Ofﬁce 2010 applications is
via the Clip Organizer. ■
To scan an image from the Microsoft Clip Organizer, follow these steps:
1.
Open the Clip Organizer utility (Start ➪All Programs ➪Microsoft Ofﬁce ➪Microsoft
Ofﬁce 2010 Tools ➪Microsoft Clip Organizer).
2.
Choose File ➪Add Clips to Organizer ➪From Scanner or Camera. The Insert Picture
from Scanner or Camera dialog box opens.
3.
Choose the scanner from the Device list, as shown in Figure 13-6.
FIGURE 13-6
Select the device and the basic properties.
362

Chapter 13: Working with Photographic Images
Note
In step 3, more than one choice may be available for your scanner on the Device list, even if you have only one
scanner. If you have a choice between a driver that has the word ‘‘TWAIN’’ in the name and one that doesn’t,
avoid the TWAIN one. TWAIN is an older, backward-compatible scanner interface that offers fewer features,
and you won’t see the feature-rich Custom Insert dialog box; instead you’ll see a much simpler dialog box if
you click Custom Insert, which provides fewer customization options. ■
4.
Choose a resolution: Web (low) or Print (high). Lower resolution means smaller ﬁle
size and fewer pixels overall comprising the image. Low resolution is the best choice for
on-screen presentations.
5.
Click Insert to scan with the default settings, or click Custom Insert, make changes to the
settings, and click Scan.
The Custom Insert option opens the full controls for the scanner. They vary depending on the
model; the box for an HP scanner is shown in Figure 13-7.
FIGURE 13-7
Custom insert options are available when scanning into the Clip Organizer.
Here are some of the things you can do in the Custom Insert dialog box:
 Choose a scanning mode: Color Picture, Grayscale Picture, or Black and White Picture
or Text. This option determines the color depth. Color is full 24-bit color. Grayscale is 256
shades of gray (8-bit, single color). Black and white is single-bit scanning that produces an
extremely small ﬁle similar to a fax.
 Preview the scan: Click the Preview button to do a test scan and then drag the black
squares in the preview area to adjust what portion of the image is saved when you do the
‘‘real scan’’ by clicking the Scan button.
363

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
 Choose a paper source: If your scanner has a document feeder, you have that choice on
the Paper Source drop-down list in addition to Flatbed (the default).
 Adjust the quality of the scanned picture: Click the Adjust the Quality of the Scanned
Picture hyperlink to open an Advanced Properties dialog box. From there you can drag the
Brightness and Contrast sliders and choose a resolution setting (dots per inch). The default
depends on your scanner, but is probably 150 or 200 dpi.
Tip
The default dpi setting is appropriate in most cases where you are using the image at approximately the
same size as the original, but if you are concerned about ﬁle size, you can reduce this to 100 dpi without
a noticeable loss of image quality on-screen. If you plan on using the image at a large size, like full screen,
and the image was originally a very small hard copy, then scan at a higher resolution. ■
Acquiring Images from a Digital Camera
There are a lot of ways to transfer images from a digital camera in Windows. You can connect
most cameras to the PC via a USB port and treat them as a removable drive, from which
you can drag and drop pictures into a folder on your hard disk. You can also remove the
memory card from the camera and use a card reader, and in some cases you can even insert a
memory card into a printer and print the images directly.
With all of these methods available, inserting directly from the camera into the Clip Organizer is
probably not your ﬁrst choice. However, if you want to try it, use the same method as with the
scanner. Then just follow the prompts to select and insert the picture.
Note
When you hear digital cameras referred to in megapixel that means a million pixels in total — the height
multiplied by the width. For example, a 1,152 by 864-pixel image is approximately 1 megapixel (995,328
pixels, to be exact). Most digital cameras take pictures at 10 to 15 megapixels these days, which is overkill
for use in a PowerPoint show. Most cameras have settings you can change that control the image size,
though, so you can reduce the image size on the camera itself. You can also resize the picture after trans-
ferring it to the computer. ■
Capturing and Inserting Screen Shots
A screen shot is a picture that you take of your computer screen using Windows itself (or a screen
capture utility). Most of the images in this book are screen shots. You might want to take screen
shots to illustrate the steps in a computer-based procedure, and then create a PowerPoint presen-
tation that teaches others to perform that procedure.
Windows has always had a basic screen shot capability built into it: the PrintScreen key. You
can press PrintScreen at any time to copy an image of the screen to the Clipboard. Then you can
paste directly onto your slide, or open a graphics editing program such as Paint and paste from
the Clipboard to save the ﬁle.
364

Chapter 13: Working with Photographic Images
In PowerPoint 2010, you can also capture and insert screen shots directly, bypassing the Clip-
board and an outside graphics program. The Screenshot command in PowerPoint also enables
you to capture individual windows rather than the entire screen.
To capture a screen shot of an open window, follow these steps:
1.
Display the slide on which you want to place the screen shot.
2.
Choose Insert ➪Screenshot. A menu appears showing thumbnails of the available win-
dows. See Figure 13-8.
FIGURE 13-8
Capture a window using the Screenshot command.
3.
Click the thumbnail image of the window you want to capture. The image is immediately
inserted as a new picture on the active slide.
Note
The Screenshot command does not show every open window as a thumbnail; it shows each tab of Internet
Explorer, and each open Ofﬁce application window except for PowerPoint itself. If you want to capture a
window other than the ones shown in the thumbnails, you must use the Screen Clipping command. ■
If the window you want does not appear on the thumbnails list, or if you want different crop-
ping, use the Screen Clipping command instead. Follow these steps:
1.
Display the window that you want to capture.
2.
Using the taskbar, switch to PowerPoint.
3.
Choose Insert ➪Screenshot ➪Screen Clipping. The PowerPoint window is minimized,
and the window immediately beneath it appears, with a whitewash overlay on it.
365

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
4.
Click and drag to deﬁne the rectangular area you want to crop, as in Figure 13-9. When
you release the mouse button, the deﬁned area appears in PowerPoint as a new image.
FIGURE 13-9
Drag to deﬁne an area of the screen to be captured.
Tip
If you need better cropping than you can get with the preceding steps, use the cropping techniques in the
following section to ﬁne-tune the crop after insertion into PowerPoint.
If you need more robust screen capture capabilities, consider an application that is speciﬁcally designed for
screen captures such as SnagIt (snagit.com). ■
Sizing and Cropping Photos
After placing a picture on a slide, you will probably need to adjust its size, and/or crop it,
to make it ﬁt in the allotted space the way you want it. The following sections explain these
techniques.
366

Chapter 13: Working with Photographic Images
Sizing a Photo
Sizing a photo is just like sizing any other object. Drag its selection handles. Drag a corner to
maintain the aspect ratio, or drag a side to distort it. (Distorting a photo is seldom a good idea,
though, unless you’re after some weird funhouse effect.)
You can also specify an exact size for a photo the same as with drawn objects. Right-click the
photo and choose Size and Position to set a size in the Format Picture dialog box on the Size tab
(see Figure 13-10). Alternatively, you can display the Format tab, and then use the Height and
Width boxes in the Size group, also shown in Figure 13-10.
FIGURE 13-10
Size a photo via either the dialog box or the Format tab.
Width
Height
Height and width
as a percentage of
original size
Height and
width in inches
The most straightforward way to specify the size is in inches in the Height and Width boxes,
either in the dialog box or on the tab. These measurements correspond to the markers on the
on-screen ruler in Normal view. The size of a slide varies depending on how you have it set up
(by using the Page Setup tab), but an average slide size is 10 inches wide by 7.5 inches tall. You
can also size the photo using the Scale controls in the Size and Position dialog box, in which
you adjust the size based on a percentage of the original size.
Note
The Scale is based on the original size, not the current size. So, for example, if you set the Height and
Width to 50%, close the dialog box, and then reopen it and set them each to 75%, the net result will be
75% of the original, not 75% of the 50%. However, you can override this by deselecting the Relative to
Original Picture Size check box (see Figure 13-10). ■
367

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
If you are setting up a presentation for the primary purpose of showing full-screen graphics, you
can use the Best Scale for Slide Show check box (see Figure 13-10). This enables you to choose a
screen resolution, such as 640 x 480 or 800 x 600, and size the pictures so that they will show
to the best advantage in that resolution. Choose the resolution that corresponds to the display
setting on the PC on which you will show the presentation. To determine what the resolution
is on the PC, right-click the Windows desktop and choose Screen Resolution (Windows 7),
or right-click the Windows desktop, choose Properties, and then look up the resolution under
Settings (Windows XP and Windows Vista).
Tip
When possible, develop your presentation at the same Windows screen resolution as the PC on which you
present the show. Many digital projectors display at 1024 x 768. ■
Cropping a Photo
Cropping is for those times when you want only a part of the image. For example, you
might have a great photo of a person or animal, but there is extraneous detail around it, as
shown in Figure 13-11. You can crop away all but the important object in the image with a
cropping tool.
FIGURE 13-11

368

Chapter 13: Working with Photographic Images
Tip
Here’s something important to know: Cropping and sizing a picture in PowerPoint does not reduce the over-
all size of the PowerPoint presentation ﬁle. When you insert a picture, PowerPoint stores the whole thing at
its original size and continues to store it that way regardless of any manipulations you perform on it within
PowerPoint. That’s why it’s recommended throughout this chapter that you do any editing of the photo
in a third-party image program before you import it into PowerPoint. However, there’s a work-around. If
you use the Compress Pictures option (covered later in this chapter), it discards any cropped portions of
the images. That means the ﬁle size decreases with the cropping, and that you can’t reverse the cropping
later. ■
You can crop two sides at once by cropping at the corner of the image, or crop each side indi-
vidually by cropping at the sides. To crop an image, do the following:
1.
Select the image, so the Picture Tools Format tab becomes available.
2.
Click the Crop button on the Picture Tools Format tab. Your mouse pointer changes to a
cropping tool and crop marks appear on the picture (see Figure 13-11).
3.
Position the pointer over one of the black markers on the image frame, and drag toward
the center until the image is cropped the way you want.
4.
Repeat step 3 for each side. Then click the Crop button again, or press Esc, to turn crop-
ping off.
5.
Resize the cropped image, if needed.
Figure 13-12 shows the result of cropping and resizing the image from Figure 13-11.
FIGURE 13-12
The picture has been improved by cropping and resizing it.
369

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
To undo a crop, reenter cropping mode by clicking the Crop button again, and then drag the
side(s) back outward again. Or you can simply reset the photo, as described in the following
section.
New in PowerPoint 2010, you can also crop to a shape, or crop to a particular aspect ratio (that
is, ratio of height to width).
Cropping to a shape crops the picture so that it ﬁts inside one of the drawing shapes that
PowerPoint provides, such as a star, triangle, or arrow. (This feature was called Picture Shape
in PowerPoint 2007, and was accessed differently.)
To crop to a shape, follow these steps:
1.
Select the picture.
2.
On the Picture Tools Format tab, click the down arrow under the Crop button, and point
to Crop to Shape. A palette of shapes appears, as shown in Figure 13-13.
3.
Click the shape to which you want the picture cropped.
FIGURE 13-13
You can crop a picture to a shape.
370

Chapter 13: Working with Photographic Images
Tip
After cropping to a shape, you’ll notice the central part of the image might not be exactly centered within
the shape. To adjust the centering of the picture within the crop area, right-click the picture and choose
Format Picture. Click the Crop tab, and then adjust the values in the Picture Position section, as shown in
Figure 13-14. ■
FIGURE 13-14
Set a precise amount of cropping in the Format Picture dialog box.
You can also crop to an aspect ratio. PowerPoint offers several preset ratios to choose from that
correspond to common picture sizes, such as 2:3, 3:4, and 3:5. To apply an aspect ratio crop:
1.
Select the picture.
2.
On the Picture Tools Format tab, click the down arrow under the Crop button, and point
to Aspect Ratio. A list of ratios appears.
3.
Click the ratio you want to use. Crop marks appear on the image.
New in PowerPoint 2010, you can see the rest of the picture as you crop, for reference.
4.
Click the Crop button or press Esc on your keyboard to ﬁnalize the cropping operation.
You can also crop ‘‘by the numbers’’ with the Crop settings in the Format Picture dialog box.
Here’s how to do that:
1.
Select the picture.
2.
Right-click the picture and choose Format Picture.
371

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
3.
Click the Crop tab.
4.
Use the controls under Picture Position (see Figure 13-14) to manually enter cropping
amounts for each side.
Note
To crop from the bottom, decrease the Height setting; to crop from the right, decrease the Width setting.
The Left and Top settings crop from those sides, respectively. ■
Caution
You cannot uncrop after compressing the picture (assuming you use the default compression options that
include deleting cropped areas of pictures). By default, saving compresses and makes crops permanent, so
be sure to undo any unwanted cropping before you save. ■
Resetting a Photo
Once the picture is in PowerPoint, any manipulations you do to it are strictly on the surface. It
changes how the picture appears on the slide, but it doesn’t change how the picture is stored
in PowerPoint. Consequently you can reset the picture back to its original settings at any time
(provided you have not compressed the picture). This resetting also clears any changes you make
to the image’s size, contrast, and brightness (which are discussed in the next section).
Resetting a photo is different depending on what aspects of it you want to reset. In the Format
Picture dialog box, many of the tabbed sections have a Reset button. Click the Reset button that
applies to what you want to reset. For example, to reset the cropping and sizing of a photo, click
the Reset button on the Size tab.
Adjusting and Correcting Photos
PowerPoint 2010 has some new features for adjusting, correcting, and applying artistic effects to
photos. Not only can you adjust the brightness and contrast, but you can sharpen or soften an
image, tint it, make it black-and-white, and apply several types of artistic effects to it that make
it look like it was created in some other medium, such as charcoal pencil or collage.
Applying Brightness and Contrast Corrections
You can adjust the brightness and contrast for any photo in PowerPoint, and you can adjust the
sharpness or softness of the image.
Brightness refers to the overall level of light in a picture. The brighter the setting, the lighter each
pixel of the image is. Brightness does not affect the color hues. You might increase the brightness
on a photo that was taken in a dimly lit room, for example.
372

Chapter 13: Working with Photographic Images
Contrast refers to the difference between the lighter areas and the darker areas of the photo.
Adjusting contrast makes the lights lighter and the darks darker. Increasing the contrast of a
picture makes its image more distinct; this can be good for an older, washed-out picture, for
example.
Sharpness/softness is a slider, with the default being right in the middle between them. When you
sharpen an image, the edges of the objects in the picture appear more distinct; when you soften
an image, the edges are blurred. PowerPoint ﬁnds the edges of objects by looking for areas where
the color changes dramatically from one spot to the adjacent one.
The easiest way to access those controls is through the Corrections button on the Picture
Tools Format tab. Click the button and then click one of the preset thumbnails, as shown in
Figure 13-15. Brightness and contrast are two separately adjustable settings, but the presets on
the menu shown in Figure 13-15 combine them. In the Brightness and Contrast section, the
sample in the upper-left corner decreases both, and the sample in the lower-right increases both.
In between, the samples combine settings in various ways. Point at a sample to see a pop-up
ScreenTip listing its speciﬁcs.

To choose a value other than the ones listed, click Picture Corrections Options to open the

you can drag sliders or enter exact percentages for each setting individually. See Figure 13-16.

Recoloring a Picture
Several color options are available from the Color button’s drop-down list on the Picture Tools
Format tab. PowerPoint 2010 has enhanced its color options greatly over earlier versions. You
can apply color washes to the image, make it black-and-white or grayscale, make it look washed
out, and more. You can point at a sample to see a preview of it on the selected image.
The Color menu has three sections (see Figure 13-17):
 Color Saturation: This refers to the vibrancy of the colors. At the low end is
grayscale — no colors at all, or 0% saturation. The center point is 100% saturation, the
default. At the high end is a very vividly colored version of the image at 400% saturation.
 Color Tone: The presets in this section enable you to adjust the ‘‘temperature’’ of the
image, from very cool (increased blue and green) to very warm (increased red and yel-
low). Color tones are measured numerically; the higher the number, the warmer the tone.
4700K is very cool; 11200K is very warm.
 Recolor: These presets enable you to radically adjust the colors of the image by choosing
a grayscale, sepia, black-and-white, washout, or other preset, or applying a colored wash
over the picture. Here’s where you’ll ﬁnd the equivalent settings to the Recolor presets from
earlier versions of PowerPoint, but also many more options. For more colors to choose
from, point to More Variations and choose from the ﬂy-out palette of colors. The last two
rows of colors (darks and lights) are based on the theme colors.
374

Chapter 13: Working with Photographic Images
FIGURE 13-17
Choose color presets to apply to the image.
You can also choose Picture Color Options from the menu in Figure 13-17 to open the For-
mat Picture dialog box and display the Picture Color tab. Here you’ll ﬁnd buttons that open
menus with the same presets as on the menu, and also sliders for ﬁne-tuning the Saturation and
Temperature.
Note
In most areas of PowerPoint, the dialog box method provides more ﬂexibility than the menu method. One
exception is when recoloring an image. On the Color button’s menu you have more presets to choose from,
as well as a More Variations command that provides access to even more colors. In contrast, in the Format
Picture dialog box, fewer presets are available, and there is no way to choose an alternative color from a
palette from there. ■
Setting a Transparent Color and Removing
a Background
The Transparent Color feature, which you also learned about in Chapter 12, can be used to
remove one of the colors from the photo, making the areas transparent that were previously
occupied by that color. For example, suppose you have a scanned photo of your CEO and you
want to make the background transparent so it looks like his head is sitting right on the slide.
This feature could help you out with that.
To set a transparent color, select the image and then choose Format ➪Color ➪Set Transparent
Color. Then, on the image, click an area that contains the color you want to make transparent.
375

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Setting a transparent color sounds like a great idea, but in reality it does not work as well with
photos as it does with clip art. For one thing, it replaces all instances of that color, not just in
the background. So, for example, if you have a picture of a man with a white shirt on a white
background and choose to make white the transparent color (because you want to drop out
the background), the man’s shirt becomes transparent, too.
Another reason it doesn’t work that well on photos is that what looks like one color in a photo
is not usually just one color. Think of a blue sky, for example. It probably consists of at least two
dozen different shades of blue. If you try to make one of those shades of blue transparent using
PowerPoint’s transparency tool, you’ll probably just end up with splotches of transparent areas.
So what’s the solution? In previous versions of PowerPoint, there wasn’t much you could do. You
had to use alpha channels in a third-party image-editing program to create true transparency and
save the image as TIF or PNG. (JPEG format does not support alpha channels.) In PowerPoint
2010, however, there is a Remove Background command that can do the trick in many cases.
To remove the background, select the picture and then choose Picture Tools Format ➪Remove
Background. The Background Removal tab becomes available, and the areas of the image that
PowerPoint plans to remove appear with a purple wash over them (shown in Figure 13-18).
FIGURE 13-18
The Background Removal tab provides tools for helping you separate a picture’s subject from its
background.

376

Chapter 13: Working with Photographic Images
If PowerPoint has correctly guessed at the edges of the image subject, click Keep Changes to
accept the background removal as is.
If it has not gotten it quite right, do any of the following to make corrections:
 PowerPoint–generated border: A dotted border appears around what PowerPoint
thinks is the central part of the image. Drag the selection handles along this border to
expand it to allow additional parts of the image to be preserved if needed.
 To include more image: Click Mark Areas to Keep and then drag on the image, in
the purple shaded areas, to delineate additional parts of the image that should not be
removed.
 To exclude image sections: Click Mark Areas to Remove and then drag on the image, in
the areas that are not purple shaded, to mark additional parts of the image that should be
removed.
 For mistakes: If you make a mistake and mark an area you shouldn’t have, click Delete
Mark and then click on that mark.
Applying Artistic Effects
Artistic effects are new in PowerPoint 2010. They are special types of transformations you can
apply to images to make them appear as if they were created in some medium other than pho-
tography. For example, you can make a photo look like a pencil sketch or a painting.
To apply artistic effects, select the picture and then choose Picture Tools Format ➪Artistic
Effects and choose from the menu that appears, as shown in Figure 13-19. Each effect is
mutually exclusive with the others; when you select a different effect, the previously applied
effect is removed.
For more control over the artistic effects, choose Artistic Effects Options. This opens the Format
Picture dialog box with the Artistic Effects tab displayed. From here, after selecting one of
the effects, you can make ﬁne adjustments with the sliders and other controls that appear.
There are different controls for different effects; Figure 13-20 shows the ones for the Pencil
Sketch effect.
Applying Picture Styles and Effects
You can format pictures using the same effects as you learned for drawn objects in Chapter 10.
Click the Picture Effects button on the Format tab, and then choose one of the categories there,
such as Shadow, Reﬂection, Glow, or Bevel. Refer to Chapter 10 for the details of each effect
type.
You can also choose a preset Picture Style from the Picture Styles group on the Picture Tools
Format tab. Click one of the samples displayed in that group, or open the gallery of Picture
Styles for even more choices. See Figure 13-21.

Compressing Images
Having an image that is too large (that is, too high a dpi) is not a problem quality-wise. You can
resize it in PowerPoint to make it as small as you like; just drag its selection handles. There will
be no loss of quality as it gets smaller.
However, as mentioned earlier in the chapter, inserting a picture ﬁle that is much larger than
necessary can increase the overall size of the PowerPoint ﬁle, which can become problematic if
you plan to distribute the presentation in a form where space or bandwidth is an issue.
To avoid problems with overly large graphic ﬁles, you can compress the images to reduce their
resolution and remove any cropped portions. You can do this from within PowerPoint or with a
third-party utility.
379

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Reducing Resolution and Compressing Images in
PowerPoint
PowerPoint offers an image compression utility that compresses all of the pictures in the presen-
tation in a single step and reduces their resolution to the amount needed for the type of output
you specify (e-mail, Screen, or Print).
Picture resolution is measured in PowerPoint in pixels per inch, or ppi. This roughly translates
to dots per inch (dpi) on a printout. A computer screen shows 96 pixels per inch, so you do not
need higher resolution than that if you are only showing your presentation on-screen. However,
if you are distributing the presentation in other forms, a higher resolution might be appropriate.
To reduce resolution and compress images, do the following:
1.
Click a picture, so that the Format tab appears.
2.
Click the Compress Pictures button. The Compress Pictures dialog box appears, as shown
in Figure 13-22.
FIGURE 13-22
Click OK to compress with the default settings.
Compress Pictures button
3.
(Optional) If you do not want to compress all of the pictures, select the Apply Only to
This Picture check box.
4.
(Optional) If you wish to save additional space by deleting the cropped-out areas of pic-
tures, select the Delete Cropped Areas of Pictures check box.
5.
Select the desired amount of compression:
 Print (220 ppi): Choose this if you are printing the presentation on paper; it keeps the
photos at a resolution where they will look crisp on a printout.
380

Chapter 13: Working with Photographic Images
 Screen (150 ppi): Choose this if you are displaying the presentation using a projec-
tor or distributing via the Internet. Some projectors have a higher resolution than a
monitor.
 E-mail (96 ppi): Choose this if you are e-mailing the presentation to others, because
this lower setting results in a smaller ﬁle that will transmit more easily via e-mail.
 Use Document Resolution: Use this to match the resolution of the pictures to the
resolution deﬁned in the PowerPoint Options (File ➪Options ➪Advanced).
6.
Click OK to perform the compression.
Caution
Some e-mail servers have limits on the ﬁle sizes they will accept, so keeping the PowerPoint ﬁle as small
as possible when distributing via e-mail is a good idea. If you send someone an e-mail with a large ﬁle
attached to it, the server may reject the message, but you might not get an error message back from the
server at all, or you might not get one for several days. ■
Reducing Resolution with a Third-Party Utility
Working with resolution reduction from an image-editing program is somewhat of a
trial-and-error process, and you must do each image separately.
You can approximate the correct resolution by simply ‘‘doing the math.’’ For example, suppose
you have a 10′′ x 7.5′′ slide. Your desktop display is set to 800 x 600. So your image needs to
be 800 pixels wide to ﬁll the slide. Your image is a 5′′ x 3′′ image, so if you set it to 200 dpi,
that gives you 1,000 pixels, which is a little larger than you need but in the ballpark.
Exporting a Photo from PowerPoint
to a Separate File
What goes in must come out, right? Suppose you have a picture that exists only in PowerPoint,
for whatever reason. Perhaps it was scanned directly into PowerPoint in an earlier version, for
example, and you no longer have access to the original ﬁle.
There are two ways to get a graphic out of PowerPoint and make it a separate ﬁle again: You can
use the Save As Picture feature in PowerPoint, or you can simply use the Windows Clipboard to
copy and paste a graphic into an image-editing program.
Exporting a Graphic with Save As Picture
To save a picture separately from PowerPoint, do the following:
1.
Right-click the picture in PowerPoint and choose Save as Picture.
2.
In the Save as Picture dialog box, display the location where you want to save the ﬁle.
381

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
3.
Open the Save As Type list and choose the graphic format you want. You can choose TIF,
JPEG, or a variety of others. See the discussion of ﬁle formats earlier in this chapter for
guidance.
4.
Enter a name in the File Name box.
5.
Click Save.
Exporting a Graphic with the Clipboard
Copy-and-paste is a fast and simple way of transferring a graphic from PowerPoint into an
image-editing program, and from there you can save it in any supported format. Select a graphic
in PowerPoint, copy it (Ctrl+C), open the graphics program, and paste it (Ctrl+V).
Exporting Entire PowerPoint Slides as Graphics
You can save entire slides — or all slides in the whole presentation — as images. To do this:
1.
Choose File ➪Save & Send ➪Change File Type.
2.
Under Image File types, click the type of graphic you want to create: PNG or JPEG. See
Figure 13-23.
PNG results in a higher-quality, larger image ﬁle than JPEG.
FIGURE 13-23
Save slides as image ﬁles via the File ➪Save & Send command.
Choose one of these
image types
382

Chapter 13: Working with Photographic Images
3.
In the Save As dialog box, change the ﬁle location and name if desired.
4.
Click Save. A dialog box appears asking whether you want to save every slide in the pre-
sentation or the current slide only.
5.
Click Every Slide or Current Slide Only, depending on your preference.
6.
If you choose Every Slide, a message appears that a folder has been created for the slide
ﬁles. Click OK. (Each slide is a separate graphic.)
Creating a Photo Album Layout
Most presentations in PowerPoint are text-based, with accompanying photographs. The default
Blank Presentation template is biased in favor of text. Graphics, as you have seen in this chapter,
require some extra effort.
The Photo Albums feature in PowerPoint creates a new presentation that is speciﬁcally designed
as a carrier of pictures. It is useful when you need to create a presentation that is very heavy on
graphics, with little or no text except picture captions.
Creating a New Photo Album
When you create a new photo album, it starts a new presentation for you. Any other presenta-
tions that you may have open are not disturbed, and you can switch back to them at any time
with the View tab. The new presentation has a title slide, as well as slides for the photos you
place in the album.
To start a new photo album, follow these steps:
1.
On the Insert tab, click Photo Album. (Click the top part of the button, not the text and
arrow beneath it.) The Photo Album dialog box opens.
2.
To add a photo from a ﬁle, click the File/Disk button. The Insert New Pictures dialog box
opens.
3.
Select one or more pictures, and then click Insert. (To select multiple pictures, hold down
Ctrl or Shift as you click on the ones you want.) The photos appear in the Photo Album
dialog box as shown in Figure 13-24.
4.
Repeat steps 2 and 3 as needed to insert all the photos from disk that you want.
5.
For each image on the Pictures in Album list, select the picture and then apply any cor-
rection needed with the buttons beneath the Preview pane. You can rotate right or left,
increase or decrease the contrast, and increase or decrease the brightness.
6.
Use the arrows to move an image up or down in the order.
7.
In the Album Layout section, open the Picture Layout box and choose the layout for the
presentation slides. For example, in Figure 13-24, 1 Picture has been chosen.
383

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
FIGURE 13-24
Specify graphics to appear in the photo album, a page layout, and a style of photo frame.
8.
If available, choose a frame shape from the Frame Shape list. Some choices from step 7 do
not permit a frame shape to be chosen.
Tip
You can create themes speciﬁcally for photo albums, and then use them here by clicking the Browse button to
browse for a theme. You might also want to experiment with the photo album themes in the dialog box when
you create the photo album initially. ■
9.
(Optional) To add caption boxes for each picture, select the Captions Below ALL Pictures
check box.
10.
(Optional) To show the pictures in black and white, select the ALL Pictures Black and
White check box.
11.
Click Create. PowerPoint creates the new presentation containing the photos and the lay-
out you speciﬁed.
12.
Save the photo album (File ➪Save) as a presentation.
Modifying a Photo Album
You can reopen the dialog box from Figure 13-24 by clicking the down arrow beneath the Photo
Album button on the Insert tab and choosing Edit Photo Album.
You can also modify the slides in the presentation individually. These are just regular, editable
slides, and you can add anything to them that you like, including text boxes, clip art, and so on.
Think of it as an on-screen scrapbook! You can crop the photos inserted via the photo album
as well.
384

Chapter 13: Working with Photographic Images
Summary
In this chapter, you learned about the technical specs for graphics that determine their ﬁle size,
quality, and ﬂexibility, and you learned how to insert them into your presentations. You learned
how to format a photo, and how to color, crop, and manipulate photos to create special effects.
In the next chapter, you’ll learn how to work with charts. You’ll ﬁnd out how to take advantage
of PowerPoint 2010’s graphics-like capabilities for structuring and formatting numeric data in
chart format.

any times when you include a chart in PowerPoint, this chart
already exists in some other application. For example, you might
have an Excel workbook that contains some charts that you want
to use in PowerPoint. If this is the case, you can simply copy and paste them
into PowerPoint, or link or embed them, as you will learn in Chapter 15.
However, when you need to create a quick chart that has no external source,
PowerPoint’s charting tool is perfect for this purpose. The PowerPoint 2010
charting interface is based upon the one in Excel, and so you don’t have to
leave PowerPoint to create, modify, and format professional-looking charts.
Note
What’s the difference between a chart and a graph? Some purists will tell you
that a chart is either a table or a pie chart, whereas a graph is a chart that
plots data points on two axes, such as a bar chart. However, Microsoft does
not make this distinction, and neither do I in this book. I use the term ‘‘chart’’
in this book for either kind. ■
Understanding Charts
PowerPoint 2010’s charting feature is based upon the same Escher 2.0 graph-
ics engine as is used for drawn objects. Consequently, most of what you have
learned about formatting objects in earlier chapters (especially Chapter 10)
also applies to charts. For example, you can apply shape styles to the indi-
vidual elements of a chart, and apply WordArt styles to chart text. However,
there are also many chart-speciﬁc formatting and layout options, as you will
see throughout this chapter.
387

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Parts of a Chart
The sample chart shown in Figure 14-1 contains these elements:
 Data series: Each different bar color represents a different series: Q1, Q2, and Q3.
 Legend: Colored squares in the Legend box describe the correlation of each color to a data
series.
 Categories: The North, South, East, and West labels along the bottom of the chart are the
categories.
 Category axis: The horizontal line running across the bottom of the chart is the category
axis, also called the horizontal axis.
 Value axis: The vertical line running up the left side of the chart, with the numbers on it,
is the value axis, also called the vertical axis.
 Data points: Each individual bar is a data point. The numeric value for that data point
corresponds to the height of the bar, measured against the value axis.
 Walls: The walls are the areas behind the data points. On a 3-D chart, as shown in
Figure 14-1, there are both back and side walls. On a 2-D chart, there is only the plot area
behind the chart.
 Floor: The ﬂoor is the area on which the data points sit. A ﬂoor appears only in a
3-D chart.

PowerPoint 2010 versus Legacy Charts
The Charts feature in PowerPoint 2010 shown in Figure 14-2 (which is the same as in Power-
Point 2007) is very powerful and ﬂexible. It is based on the charting feature in Excel. Earlier
versions of PowerPoint (2003 and earlier) used a much simpler charting utility called Microsoft
Graph.
FIGURE 14-2
The PowerPoint 2010 charting interface.
If you create a chart in a PowerPoint 2010 presentation and then save the ﬁle as a PowerPoint
97–2003 presentation, it does not take away your ability to access the PowerPoint 2010 chart-
ing interface as long as you are working in PowerPoint 2007 or 2010. The chart is still saved
as a PowerPoint 2010 object in the 2003 ﬁle, but it also contains a 2003 version of itself, for
backward compatibility.
If you want to make sure that the chart appears exactly as you created it in PowerPoint 2003,
even if it is edited there, then you should insert the chart initially using Microsoft Graph, rather
389

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
than the PowerPoint 2010 charting tools. To do this, insert a Microsoft Graph object by follow-
ing these steps:
1.
On the Insert tab, click Object. The Object dialog box opens.
2.
Click Create New.
3.
On the Object Type list, click Microsoft Graph Chart.
4.
Click OK. The Microsoft Graph window opens within PowerPoint, complete with a
2003-style menu bar from which you can access all of the same controls that were
available in PowerPoint 2003’s charting interface. The Microsoft Graph window is shown
in Figure 14-3.
FIGURE 14-3

Tip
When you double-click to edit a Microsoft Graph chart within a PowerPoint 2010 presentation ﬁle, a mes-
sage appears asking whether you want to Convert, Convert All, or Edit Existing. If you choose to convert
(this chart or all charts) to 2010 format, you can use the new charting tools. If you choose Edit Existing,
Microsoft Graph opens. ■

Chapter 14: Working with Charts
Starting a New Chart
The main difﬁculty with creating a chart in a non-spreadsheet application such as PowerPoint is
that there is no data table from which to pull the numbers. Therefore, PowerPoint creates charts
using data that you have entered in an Excel window. By default, it contains sample data, which
you can replace with your own data.
You can place a new chart on a slide in two ways: You can either use a chart placeholder from a
layout, or you can place one manually.
If you are using a placeholder, click the Insert Chart icon on the placeholder. If you are placing
a chart manually, follow these steps:
1.
On the Insert tab, click Chart. The Insert Chart dialog box opens, as shown in
Figure 14-4.
FIGURE 14-4
Select the desired chart type.
2.
Click the desired chart type. See Table 14-1 for an explanation of the chart types.
Figures 14-5 and 14-6 show examples of some of the chart types.
3.
Click OK. The chart appears on the slide, and an Excel datasheet opens with sample data.
4.
Modify the sample data as needed. To change the range of cells that appear in the chart,
see the section ‘‘Redeﬁning the Data Range,’’ later in this chapter. If you want, you can
then close the Excel window to move it out of the way.

Design tab. ■
TABLE 14-1
Chart Types in PowerPoint 2010’s Charting Tool
Type
Description
Column
Vertical bars, optionally with multiple data series. Bars can be clustered, stacked, or based
on a percentage, and either 2-D or 3-D.
Line
Shows values as points, and connects the points with a line. Different series use different
colors and/or line styles.
Pie
A circle broken into wedges to show how parts contribute to a whole.
This de-emphasizes the actual numeric values. In most cases, this type is a single-series only.
Bar
Just like a column chart, but horizontal.
Area
Just like a column chart, but with the spaces ﬁlled in between the bars.
XY (Scatter)
Shows values as points on both axes, but does not connect them with a line. However, you
can add trend lines.
Stock
A special type of chart that is used to show stock prices.
Surface
A 3-D sheet that is used to illustrate the highest and lowest points of the data set.
Doughnut
Similar to a pie chart, but with multiple concentric rings, so that multiple series can be
illustrated.
Bubble
Similar to a scatter chart, but instead of ﬁxed-size data points, bubbles of varying sizes are
used to represent a third data variable.
Radar
Shows changes of data frequency in relation to a center point.
Note
At any point, you can return to your PowerPoint presentation by clicking anywhere outside of the chart on
the slide. To edit the chart again, you can click the chart to redisplay the chart-speciﬁc tabs. ■
Tip
If you delete a column or row by selecting individual cells and pressing Delete to clear them, the empty
space that these cells occupied remains in the chart. To completely remove a row or column from the data
range, select the row or column by clicking its header (letter for column; number for row) and click Delete
on the Home tab in Excel. ■
393

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Working with Chart Data
After you create a chart, you might want to change the data range on which it is based, or how
this data is plotted. The following sections explain how you can do this.
Plotting by Rows versus by Columns
By default, the columns of the datasheet form the data series. However, if you want, you can
switch the data around so that the rows form the series. Figures 14-7 and 14-8 show the same
chart plotted both ways so that you can see the difference.
FIGURE 14-7
A chart with the columns representing the series.
Note
What does the term data series mean? Take a look at Figures 14-7 and 14-8. Notice that there is a leg-
end next to each chart that shows what each color (or shade of gray) represents. Each of these colors, and
the label associated with it, is a series. The other variable (the one that is not the series) is plotted on the
chart’s horizontal axis. ■
To switch back and forth between plotting by rows and by columns, click the Switch
Row/Column button on the Chart Tools Design tab.

A chart can carry a very different message when you arrange it by rows versus by columns. For example,
in Figure 14-7, the chart compares the quarters. The message here is about improvement — or lack
thereof — over time. Contrast this to Figure 14-8, where the series are the regions. Here, you can compare
one region to another. The overriding message here is about competition — which division performed the
best in each quarter? It’s easy to see how the same data can convey very different messages; make sure
that you pick the arrangement that tells the story that you want to tell in your presentation. ■
Redeﬁning the Data Range
After you have created your chart, you may decide that you need to use more or less data. Per-
haps you want to exclude a month or quarter of data, or to add another region or salesperson.
To add or remove a data series, you can simply edit the datasheet. To do so, follow these steps:
1.
On the Chart Tools Design tab, click Edit Data. The Excel datasheet appears. A blue
outline appears around the range that is to be plotted.
2.
(Optional) To change the data range to be plotted, drag the bottom-right corner of the
blue outline. For example, in Figure 14-9, the West division is being excluded.
You can also enlarge the data range by expanding the blue outline. For example, you
could enter another series in column E in Figure 14-9 and then extend the outline to
encompass column E.

FIGURE 14-9
You can redeﬁne the range for the chart by dragging the blue outline on the datasheet.
Drag the corner of
the blue outline to
change the range
The preceding steps work well if the range that you want to include is contiguous, but what if
you wanted to exclude a row or column that is in the middle of the range? To deﬁne the range
more precisely, follow these steps:
1.
On the Chart Tools Design tab, click Select Data. The Select Data Source dialog box opens,
along with the Excel datasheet, as shown in Figure 14-10.
FIGURE 14-10
To ﬁne-tune the data ranges, you can use the Select Data Source dialog box.
396

Chapter 14: Working with Charts
2.
Do any of the following:
 To remove a series, select it from the Legend Entries (Series) list and click Remove.
 To add a series, click Add, and then drag across the range on the datasheet to enter it
into the Edit Series dialog box; then click OK to accept it.
 To edit a series, select it in the Legend Entries (Series) list and click Edit. Then drag
across the range or make a change in the Edit Series dialog box, and click OK.
3.
(Optional) To redeﬁne the range from which to pull the horizontal axis labels, click the
Edit button in the Horizontal (Category) Axis Labels section. A dotted outline appears
around the current range; drag to redeﬁne that range and click OK.
4.
(Optional) To redeﬁne how empty or hidden cells should be treated, click the Hidden
and Empty Cells button. In the Hidden and Empty Cell Settings dialog box that appears,
choose whether to show data in hidden rows and columns, and whether to deﬁne empty
cells as gaps in the chart or as zero values. Then click OK. The Hidden and Empty Cells
Settings dialog box is shown in Figure 14-11.
FIGURE 14-11
Specify what should happen when the data range contains blank or hidden cells.
5.
When you are ﬁnished editing the settings for the data ranges, click OK to close the Select
Data Source dialog box.
6.
(Optional) Close the Excel datasheet window, or leave it open for later reference.
Chart Types and Chart Layout Presets
The default chart is a column chart. However, there are a lot of alternative chart types to choose
from. Not all of them will be appropriate for your data, of course, but you may be surprised at
the different spin on the message that a different chart type presents.
Caution
Many chart types come in both 2-D and 3-D models, and you can choose which chart type looks most
appropriate for your presentation. However, try to be consistent. For example, it looks nicer to stay with
all 2-D or all 3-D charts rather than mixing the types in a presentation. ■
397

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
You can revisit your choice of chart type at any time by following these steps:
1.
Select the chart, if needed, so that the Chart Tools Design tab becomes available.
2.
On the Design tab, click Change Chart Type.
3.
Select the desired type, just as you did when you originally created the chart. Figure 14-4
shows the chart types.
4.
Click OK.
This is the basic procedure for the overall chart type selection, but there are also many options
for ﬁne-tuning the layout. The following sections explain these options.
Tip
To change the default chart type, after selecting a chart from the Change Chart Type dialog box, click the
Set as Default Chart button. ■
PowerPoint provides a limited number of preset chart layouts for each chart type. You can
choose these presets from the Chart Layouts group in the Chart Tools Design tab. They are good
starting points for creating your own layouts, which you will learn about in this chapter.
To choose a layout, click the down arrow in the Chart Layouts group and select one from the
gallery, as shown in Figure 14-12. Although you cannot add your own layouts to these presets,
you can create chart templates, which are basically the same thing with additional formatting
settings. This chapter also covers chart template creation.
FIGURE 14-12
You can choose one of the preset layouts that ﬁts your needs.
Working with Labels
On the Chart Tools Layout tab, the Labels group provides buttons for controlling which labels
appear on the chart. Figure 14-13 points out the various labels that you can use.
398

Chapter 14: Working with Charts
FIGURE 14-13
Labels help to make it clear to the audience what the chart represents.
Each of these label types has a button on the Layout tab that opens a drop-down list that con-
tains some presets. The drop-down list also contains a ‘‘More’’ command for opening a dialog
box that contains additional options. For example, the drop-down list for the Chart Title button
contains a ‘‘More Title Options’’ command, as shown in Figure 14-14.
FIGURE 14-14
Each type of label has its own button that displays a drop-down list.
399

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Tip
You can add data labels to a series by right-clicking a series and choosing Add Data Labels. You can also
format label text from the mini bar, which may be easier than using the Home tab’s controls. ■
You can format the label text, just as you can format any other text. To do this, select the text
and then use the Font group on the Home tab. This allows you to choose a font, size, color,
alignment, and so on.
You can also format the label box by right-clicking it and choosing Format name, where name is
the type of label that the box contains. In some cases, the dialog box that appears contains only
standard formatting controls that you would ﬁnd for any object, such as Fill, Border Color, Bor-
der Styles, Shadow, 3-D Format, and Alignment. These controls should already be very familiar
to you from Chapter 9. In other cases, in addition to the standard formatting types, there is also
a unique section that contains extra options that are speciﬁc to the content type. For example,
for the Legend, there is a Legend Options section in which you can set the position of a legend.
The following sections look at each of the label types more closely. These sections will not dwell
on the formatting that you can apply to them (fonts, sizes, borders, ﬁlls, and so on) because this
formatting is the same for all of them, as it is with any other object. Instead, they concentrate on
the options that make each label different.
Working with Chart Titles
A chart title is text that typically appears above the chart — and sometimes overlapping
it — that indicates what the chart represents. Although you would usually want either a chart
title or a slide title, but not both, this could vary if you have multiple charts or different content
on the same slide.
You can select a basic chart title, either above the chart or overlapping it, from the Chart Title
drop-down list, as shown in Figure 14-14. You can also drag the chart title around after plac-
ing it. For more options, you can choose More Title Options to open the Format Chart Title
dialog box. However, in this dialog box there is nothing that speciﬁcally relates to chart titles;
the available options are for formatting (Fill, Border Color, and so on), as for any text box.
Working with Axis Titles
An axis title is text that deﬁnes the category or the unit of measurement on an axis. For example,
in Figure 14-13, the vertical axis title is Millions.
Axis titles are deﬁned separately for the vertical and the horizontal axes. Click the Axis Titles
button on the Layout tab, and then select either Primary Horizontal Axis Title or Primary Vertical
Axis Title to display a submenu that is speciﬁc to that axis. When you turn on an axis title, a text
box appears containing default placeholder text, ‘‘Axis Title.’’ Click in this text box and type your
own label to replace it, as shown in Figure 14-15. If you’ve plotted any data on a secondary axis,
you’ll see Secondary Horizontal and Secondary Vertical Axis Title options as well.
400

Chapter 14: Working with Charts
Tip
You can easily select all of the placeholder text by clicking in the text box and pressing Ctrl+A. ■
FIGURE 14-15
An axis title describes what is being measured on the axis.
Vertical
axis title
For the horizontal axis title, the options are simple: either None or Title Below Axis. You can
choose More Primary Horizontal Axis Title Options, but again, as with the regular title options,
there are no unique settings in the dialog box — just general formatting controls.
For the vertical axis title, you can choose from among the following options, as shown in
Figure 14-16.
 Rotated Title: The title appears vertically along the vertical axis, with the letters rotated
90 degrees (so that their bases run along the axis).
 Vertical Title: The title appears vertically along the vertical axis, but each letter remains
unrotated, so that the letters are stacked one on top of the other.
 Horizontal Title: The title appears horizontally, like regular text, to the left of the
vertical axis.
401

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
FIGURE 14-16
You can select these vertical axis titles, from left to right: Rotated Title, Vertical Title, and
Horizontal Title.
Each type of vertical axis shrinks the chart somewhat when you activate it, but the Horizontal
Title format shrinks the chart more than the others because it requires more space to the left of
the chart.
Caution
If you turn off an axis title by setting it to None and then turn it back on again, you will need to retype the
axis title; it returns to the generic placeholder text. ■
If the chart does not resize itself automatically when you turn on the vertical axis title, you
might need to adjust the chart size manually. Click the chart, so that selection handles appear
around the inner part of the chart (the plot area), as shown in Figure 14-17. Then drag the left
side-selection handle inward to decrease the width of the chart to make room for the vertical
axis label.
Working with Legends
The legend is the little box that appears next to the chart (or sometimes above or below it). It
provides the key that describes what the different colors or patterns mean. For some chart types
and labels, you may not ﬁnd the legend to be useful. If it is not useful for the chart that you
are working on, you can turn it off by clicking the Legend button on the Layout tab and then
clicking None. You can also just click it and press Delete. Turning off the legend makes more
room for the chart, which grows to ﬁll the available space. To turn the legend back on, click the
Legend button again and select the position that you want for it, as shown in Figure 14-18.
Caution
Hiding the legend is not a good idea if you have more than one series in your chart, because the legend
helps people to distinguish which series is which. However, if you have only one series, a legend might not
be useful. ■
402

Chapter 14: Working with Charts
FIGURE 14-17
You can adjust the size of the plot area to make more room for the vertical axis title.
FIGURE 14-18
You can select a legend position, or turn the legend off altogether.
403

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
To resize a legend box, you can drag one of its selection handles. The text and keys inside the
box do not change in size, although they may shift in position.
When you right-click the legend and choose Format Legend, or when you choose More Legend
Options from the Legend drop-down list on the Layout tab, the Format Legend dialog box opens
with the Legend Options displayed, as shown in Figure 14-19. From here, you can choose the
legend’s position in relation to the chart and whether or not it should overlap the chart. If it does
not overlap the chart, the plot area will be automatically reduced to accommodate the legend.
Note
The controls on the Legend Options tab refer to the legend’s position in relation to the chart, not to
the position of the legend text within the legend box. You can drag the legend wherever you want it on the
chart after placing it. ■
FIGURE 14-19
You can set legend options in the Format Legend dialog box.
Adding Data Labels
Data labels show the numeric values (or other information) that are represented by each bar or
other shape on the chart. These labels are useful when the exact numbers are important or where
the chart is so small that it is not clear from the axes what the data points represent.
404

Chapter 14: Working with Charts
To turn on data labels for the chart, click the Data Labels button on the Layout tab. The options
available depend on whether it’s a 2-D or 3-D chart, and on what type of chart it is (bar, pie,
column, and so on). Figure 14-20 shows the options for 3-D pie chart.
FIGURE 14-20
You can display or hide data labels using the Data Labels button.
Data labels show the values by default, but you can also set them to display the series name and
the category name, or any combination of the three. The data labels can also include the legend
key, which is a colored square. To quickly add data labels to a chart, right-click the chart and
choose Add Data Labels.
To set data label options, choose More Data Label Options from the Data Labels drop-down
menu, to access the Format Data Labels dialog box, as shown in Figure 14-21. For a 3-D chart,
the Label Position section does not appear.
Tip
To turn the data labels on or off for a particular data point or data series, select it and then select the None
or Show option in the Data Labels drop-down menu. This is useful when you want to highlight a particular
value or set of values. ■
Adding a Data Table
Sometimes the chart tells the full story that you want to tell, but other times the audience may
beneﬁt from seeing the actual numbers on which you have built the chart. In these cases, it is
a good idea to include the data table with the chart. A data table contains the same information
that appears on the datasheet.
To display the data table with a chart, click the Data Table button on the Layout tab, as shown
in Figure 14-22, and choose to include a data table either with or without a legend key.
405

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
FIGURE 14-21
You can set data label options using the Format Data Labels dialog box.
FIGURE 14-22
Use a data table to show the audience the numbers on which the chart is based.
To format the data table, choose More Data Table Options from the Data Table drop-down
menu. From the Format Data Table dialog box that appears, you can set data table border
options, as shown in Figure 14-23. For example, you can display or hide the horizontal, vertical,
and outline borders for the table from here.
406

Chapter 14: Working with Charts
FIGURE 14-23
Use the Data Table Options to specify which borders should appear in the data table.
Controlling the Axes
No, axes are not the tools that chop down trees. Axes is the plural of axis, and an axis is the side
of the chart containing the measurements against which your data is plotted.
You can change the various axes in a chart in several ways. For example, you can make an axis
run in a different direction (such as from top-to-bottom instead of bottom-to-top for a vertical
axis), and you can turn the text on or off for the axis and change the axis scale.
Using Axis Presets
You can select some of the most popular axis presets using the Axes button on the Layout tab.
As with the axis titles that you learned about earlier in this chapter, there are separate submenus
for horizontal and vertical axes. Figure 14-24 shows the options for horizontal axes, and
Figure 14-25 shows those for vertical axes.
407

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
FIGURE 14-24
Presets for horizontal axes.
FIGURE 14-25
Presets for vertical axes.
Setting Axis Scale Options
The scale determines which numbers will form the start and endpoints of the axis line. For
example, take a look at the chart in Figure 14-26. The bars are so close to one another in
value that it is difﬁcult to see the difference between them. Compare this chart to one showing
the same data in Figure 14-27, but with an adjusted scale. Because the scale is smaller, the
differences now appear more dramatic.
408

Chapter 14: Working with Charts
FIGURE 14-26
This chart does not show the differences between the values very well.
FIGURE 14-27
A change to the values of the axis scale makes it easier to see the differences between values.
409

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Tip
You will probably never run into a case as dramatic as the difference between Figures 14-26 and 14-27
because PowerPoint’s charting feature has an automatic setting for the scale that is turned on by default.
However, you may sometimes want to override this setting for a different effect, such as to minimize or
enhance the difference between data series. This is a good example of ‘‘making the data say what you
want.’’ For example, if you wanted to make the point that the differences between three months were
insigniﬁcant, then you would use a larger scale. If you wanted to highlight the importance of the differ-
ences, then you would use a smaller scale. ■
To set the scale for an axis, follow these steps:
1.
On the Layout tab, choose Axes ➪Primary Vertical Axis ➪More Primary Vertical Axis
Options. The Format Axis dialog box opens, displaying the Axis Options, as shown in
Figure 14-28.
FIGURE 14-28
You can set axis options in the Format Axis dialog box, including the axis scale.
2.
Drag the Format Axis dialog box to the side so that you can see the results on the chart.
3.
If you do not want the automatic value for one of the measurements, click Fixed and enter
a different number in its text box.
 Minimum is the starting number. The usual setting is 0, as shown in Figure 14-26,
although in Figure 14-27, it is set to 2.8.
410

Chapter 14: Working with Charts
 Maximum is the top number. This number is 4 in both Figure 14-26 and
Figure 14-27.
 Major unit determines the axis text. It is also the unit by which gridlines stretch out
across the back wall of the chart. In Figure 14-26, gridlines appear at increments of
0.5 million units; in Figure 14-27, they appear by 0.2 million units.
 Minor unit is the interval of smaller gridlines between the major ones. Most charts
look better without minor units, because these units can make a chart look cluttered.
You should leave this setting at Auto. You can also use this feature to place tick marks
on the axes between the labels of the major units.
4.
(Optional) If you want to activate any of these special features, select their check boxes.
Each of these check boxes recalculates the numbers in the Minimum, Maximum, Major
Unit, and Minor Unit text boxes.
 Values in reverse order. This check box turns the scale backwards so that the greater
values appear at the bottom or left.
 Logarithmic scale. Rarely used by ordinary folks, this check box recalculates the
Minimum, Maximum, Major Unit, and Minor Unit according to a power of 10 for the
value axis, based on the range of data. (If this explanation doesn’t make any sense to
you, then you’re not the target audience for this feature.)
 Floor crosses at. When you select this feature, you can enter a value indicating where
the axes should cross. You can specify an axis value of a particular number, or use
Maximum axis value.
5.
(Optional) You can set a display unit to simplify large numbers. For example, if you
set display units to Thousands, then the number 1000 appears as ‘‘1’’ on the chart. If you
then select the Show Display Units Label on Chart check box, an axis label will appear as
‘‘Thousands.’’
6.
(Optional) You can set tick-mark types for major and minor marks. These marks appear
as little lines on the axis to indicate the units. You can use tick marks either with or
without gridlines. (To set gridlines, use the Gridlines button’s menu on the Chart Tools
Layout tab.)
7.
If you are happy with the results, click Close.
Setting a Number Format
You can apply a number format to axes and data labels that show numeric data. This is similar
to the number format that is used for Excel cells; you can choose a category, such as Currency
or Percentage, and then ﬁne-tune this format by choosing a number of decimal places, a method
of handling negative numbers, and so on.
To set a number format, follow these steps:
1.
Right-click the axis and choose Format Axis.
2.
In the Format Axis dialog box that appears, click Number. A list of number formats
appears.
411

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
3.
(Optional) You can select the number format in two ways: the ﬁrst way is to select the
Linked to Source check box if you want the number format to be taken from the number
format that is applied to the datasheet in Excel. The second way is to click the desired
number format in the Category list. Options appear that are speciﬁc to the format that you
selected. For example, Figure 14-29 shows the options for the Number type of format,
which is a generic format.
FIGURE 14-29
You can set a number format in the Format Axis dialog box.
4.
(Optional) You can ﬁne-tune the numbering format by changing the code in the Format
Code text box. The number signs (#) represent optional digits, while the zeroes represent
required digits.
5.
Click Close to close the dialog box.
Note
To see some examples of custom number formats that you might use in the Format Code text box, choose
Custom as the number format. ■
412

Chapter 14: Working with Charts
Formatting a Chart
In the following sections, you learn about chart formatting. There is so much that you can do to
a chart that this subject could easily take up its own chapter! For example, just like any other
object, you can resize a chart. You can also change the fonts, change the colors and shading of
bars, lines, or pie slices, use different background colors, change the 3-D angle, and much more.
Tip
The Format dialog box can remain open while you format various parts of the chart. Just click a different
part of the chart behind the open dialog box (drag it off to the side if needed); the controls in the dialog
box change to reﬂect the part that you have selected. ■
Clearing Manually Applied Formatting
PowerPoint uses Format dialog boxes that are related to the various parts of the chart. These
dialog boxes are nonmodal, which means that they can stay open indeﬁnitely, that their changes
are applied immediately, and that you don’t have to close the dialog box to continue working
on the document. Although this is handy, it is all too easy to make an unintended formatting
change.
To clear the formatting that is applied to a chart element, select it and then, on the Format tab,
click Reset to Match Style. This strips off the manually applied formatting from that element,
returning it to whatever appearance is speciﬁed by the chart style that you have applied.
Formatting Titles and Labels
Once you add a title or label to your chart, you can change its size, attributes, colors, and font.
Just right-click the title that you want to format and choose Format Chart Title (or whatever kind
of title it is; for example, an axis label is called Axis Title). The Format Chart Title (or Format
Axis Title) dialog box appears.
Note
The formatting covered in this section applies to the text box, not to the text within it. If you need to for-
mat the ﬁll, outline, or typeface, use the mini toolbar (right-click to open it) or use the font tools on the
Home tab. ■
The categories in this dialog box vary, depending on the type of text that you are formatting, but
the following categories are generally available:
 Fill: You can choose No Fill, Solid Fill, Gradient Fill, Picture or Text Fill, or Automatic.
When you select Automatic, the color changes to contrast with the background color
speciﬁed by the theme.
 Border Color: You can choose No Line, Solid Line, or Automatic. When you select Auto-
matic, the color changes to contrast with the background color speciﬁed by the theme.
413

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
 Border Styles: You can set a width, a compound type (that is, a line made up of multiple
lines), and a dash type.
 Shadow: You can apply a preset shadow in any color you want, or you can ﬁne-tune the
shadow in terms of transparency, size, angle, and so on. You might need to apply a ﬁll to
the box in order for the shadow to appear. This shadow is for the text box, not for the text
within it; use the Font group on the Home tab to apply the text shadow, or the shadows
available for WordArt.
 3-D Format: You can deﬁne 3-D settings for the text box, such as Bevel, Depth, Contour,
and Surface.
 Alignment: You can set vertical and horizontal alignment, angle, and text direction, as
well as control AutoFit settings for some types of text.
Note
Alignment is usually not relevant in a short label or title text box. The text box is usually exactly the right
size to hold the text, and so there is no other way for the text to be aligned. Therefore, no matter what
alignment you choose, the text looks very much the same. ■
From the Home tab or the mini toolbar, you can also choose all of the text effects that you
learned about earlier in this book, such as font, size, font style, underline, color, alignment,
and so on.
Applying Chart Styles
Chart styles are presets that you can apply to charts in order to add colors, backgrounds, and ﬁll
styles. The Chart Styles gallery, shown in Figure 14-30, is located on the Chart Tools Design tab,
which appears when you select a chart.
FIGURE 14-30
You can apply a chart style using the Chart Styles gallery.
Click here for more chart
styles
Chart styles are based on the themes and color schemes in the PowerPoint Design tab. When
you change the theme or the colors, the chart style choices also change.
Note
You cannot add to the presets in the Chart Styles gallery, but you can save a group of settings as a template.
To do this, use the Save As Template command on the Chart Tools Design tab. ■
414

Chapter 14: Working with Charts
Formatting the Chart Area
Your next task is to format the big picture: the chart area. The chart area is the big frame that
contains the chart and all of its elements: the legend, the data series, the data table, the titles,
and so on.
The Format Chart Area dialog box has many of the same categories as for text boxes — such as
ﬁll, border color, border styles, shadow, and 3-D format — and it also adds 3-D rotation if you
are working with a 3-D chart. You can choose to rotate and tilt the entire chart, just as you did
with drawn shapes earlier in this book.
Formatting the Legend
When you use a multi-series chart, the value of the legend is obvious — it tells you which
colors represent which series. Without the legend, your audience will not know what the various
bars or lines mean. You can do all of the same formatting for a legend that you can for other
chart elements. Just right-click the legend, choose Format Legend from the shortcut menu, and
then use the tabs in the Format Legend dialog box to make your modiﬁcations. The available
categories are Fill, Border Color, Border Styles, and Shadow, as well as the Legend options
mentioned earlier in this chapter.
Tip
If you select one of the individual keys in the legend and change its color, the color on the data series in
the chart changes to match. This is especially useful with stacked charts, where it is sometimes difﬁcult to
select the data series that you want. ■
Formatting Gridlines and Walls
Gridlines help the reader’s eyes move across the chart. Gridlines are related to the axes, which
you learned about earlier in this chapter. Although both vertical and horizontal gridlines are
available, most people use only horizontal ones. Walls are nothing more than the space between
the gridlines, formatted in a different color than the plot area. You can set the Walls ﬁll to None
to hide them. (Don’t you wish tearing down walls was always that easy?) You can also use the
Chart Wall and Chart Floor buttons on the Layout tab.
Note
You can only format walls on 3-D charts; 2-D charts do not have them. To change the background behind
a 2-D chart, you must format the plot area. ■
In most cases, the default gridlines that PowerPoint adds work well. However, you may want to
make the lines thicker or a different color, or turn them off altogether.
Gridline presets are available from the Gridlines drop-down menu on the Layout tab. There are
separate submenus for vertical and horizontal gridlines, as shown in Figure 14-31. You can also
choose the More command for either of the gridlines submenus for additional options.
415

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
FIGURE 14-31
You can apply gridline presets from the Gridlines drop-down menu.
To change the gridline formatting, right-click a gridline and choose Format Major Gridlines.
You can then adjust the line color, line style, and shadow from the Format Major Gridlines dia-
log box.
Note
Gridline spacing is based on the major and minor units that you have set in the Format Axis dialog box
(vertical or horizontal). To set this spacing, see the section, ‘‘Setting Axis Scale Options,’’ earlier in this
chapter. ■
Formatting the Data Series
To format a data series, just right-click the bar, slice, or chart element, and choose Format Data
Series from the shortcut menu. Then, depending on your chart type, different tabs appear that
you can use to modify the series appearance. Here are the ones for bar and column charts, for
example:
 Series Options: This tab contains options that are speciﬁc to the selected chart type.
For example, when working with a 3-D bar or column chart, the series options include
Gap Depth and Gap Width, which determine the thickness and depth of the bars. For
a pie chart, you can set the rotation angle for the ﬁrst slice, as well as whether a slice is
‘‘exploded’’ or not.
 Shape: For charts involving bars and columns, you can choose a shape option such as Box,
Full Pyramid, Partial Pyramid, Cylinder, Full Cone, or Partial Cone. The partial options
truncate the top part of the shape when it is less than the largest value in the chart.
 Fill: You can choose a ﬁll, including solid, gradient, or picture/texture.
 Border Color: The border is the line around the shape. You can set it to a solid line, no
line, or Automatic (that is, based on the theme).
 Border Styles: The only option available on this tab for most chart types is Width, which
controls the thickness of the border. For line charts, you can set arrow options and other
line attributes.
416

Chapter 14: Working with Charts
 Shadow: You can add shadows to the data series bars or other shapes, just as you would
add shadows to anything else.
 3-D Format: These settings control the contours, surfaces, and beveling for 3-D data
series.
Other chart types have very different categories available. For example, a line chart has Marker
Options, Marker Fill, Line Color, Line Style, Marker Line Color, and Marker Line Style, in
addition to the generic Series Options, Shadow, and 3-D Format categories.
It is often easier to set up formatting for a chart using the tools on the Chart Tools Format tab.
From here, you can choose preset shadows and bevels, which is easier than manually setting up
3-D effects.
Rotating a 3-D Chart
Three-dimensional charts have a 3-D Rotation option in the Format Chart Area dialog box.
This feature works just the same as with other 3-D objects, where you can rotate the chart on
the X-, Y-, and Z-axis. In addition, there are some extra chart-speciﬁc options, as shown in
Figure 14-32. For example, you can set the chart to AutoScale, control its depth, and reset it to
the default rotation.
FIGURE 14-32

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Working with Chart Templates
After you have formatted a chart the way you want it, you can save it as a template. You can
then apply these same formatting options to other charts at a later time.
Creating a Chart Template
To create a chart template, follow these steps:
1.
Select a chart that is formatted exactly the way you want the template to be. If you want
the template to use theme colors, use them in the chart; if you want the template to use
ﬁxed colors, apply them instead.
2.
On the Chart Tools Design tab, click Save As Template. The Chart Template dialog box
opens.
3.
Type a name for the template.
4.
Click Save.
Note
By default, under Windows Vista and Windows 7, chart templates are stored in Users\username\AppData\
Roaming\Microsoft\Template\Charts, with a .crtx (Chart Template) extension. In Windows XP, it’s
\Documents and Settings\username\Application Data\Microsoft\Templates\Charts. You can copy templates
from another PC and store them in that location and they will show up on your list of chart templates on
the current PC. ■
Applying a Chart Template
To apply a chart template to an existing chart, follow these steps:
1.
Select the chart, and on the Chart Tools Design tab, click Change Chart Type.
You can also right-click the chart and choose Change Chart Type.
2.
At the top of the list of categories, click Templates. PowerPoint displays all of the custom
templates that you have created.
3.
Click the template that you want to use.
4.
Click OK.
To apply a chart template to a new chart as you are creating it, after choosing Insert ➪Chart,
click Templates folder and select the desired template.
Managing Template Files
Chart template ﬁles remain on your hard disk until you delete them. If you want to get
rid of a chart template, or rename it, you can do so by opening the folder location that
418

Chapter 14: Working with Charts
contains these templates. Although you can manually browse to the location (Users\username\
AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Template\Charts), this is an easier way:
1.
On the Insert tab, click Chart.
2.
In the Insert Chart dialog box, click Manage Templates. The folder location opens in an
Explorer window. From here, you can rename or delete ﬁles.
Summary
In this chapter, you learned how to create and format charts using PowerPoint. You learned how
to create charts, change their type and their data range, and use optional text elements on them
such as titles, data labels, and so on. You also learned how to format charts and how to save
formatting in chart templates. In the next chapter, you learn how to incorporate data from
other sources, including programs that do not necessarily have anything to do with PowerPoint
or Ofﬁce.

from Other Programs
IN THIS CHAPTER
Working with external content:
An overview
Copying content from other
programs
Introducing OLE
Linking and embedding data
Exporting PowerPoint objects
to other programs
A
s you have already seen, PowerPoint contains an assortment of tools
for creating various types of objects: charts, WordArt, SmartArt
diagrams, clip art, and so on. You have also learned how to place
graphics into PowerPoint from a saved ﬁle, how to embed Excel charts on
slides, and how to borrow slides from other PowerPoint presentations and
outlines from Word or other text editors.
However, a lot of other objects don’t fall into any of these categories, so
PowerPoint doesn’t have a special command for bringing in exactly that
type of object. Examples include a ﬂow chart from a program like Microsoft
Visio, a slide from a different presentation application, some records from a
database, or a map from a mapping program.
This chapter looks at the various ways to import and create content from
other applications in PowerPoint, as well as how to export PowerPoint
objects for use in other programs.
Working with External Content:
An Overview
There are several ways to bring content from other programs into your
presentation. The method you choose depends on how you want the content
to behave once it arrives. You can make the inserted content a full citizen of
the presentation — that is, with no ties to its native application or data
ﬁle — or you can help it retain a connection to its original application
(called embedding) or to its original data ﬁle (called linking).
The simplest way to import content into PowerPoint is to use the Copy and
Paste commands. For text-type data from most applications, this results in
421

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
the incoming data integrating itself with PowerPoint without retaining any connection to the
source. For example, you can select some cells from an Excel worksheet, and then click Copy
on the Home tab to copy them to the Clipboard. Then in PowerPoint you can paste them by
clicking Paste, and the Excel cells become a PowerPoint table. You can also do the same thing
with drag-and-drop from one application to the other.
Caution
Not all data types exhibit the behavior described here. With some source data types, especially types that
are more graphical than text-based, copy-and-paste results in an embedded object that will open its native
application for editing. For example, when you copy and paste a chart from Excel, it is by default linked. ■
Another choice is to embed the data. You can do this for existing or new data. Embedding
it maintains the relationship between that data and its native application, so that you can
double-click it to edit it with that native application later. To embed existing data, you copy the
data to the Clipboard, use the Paste button’s menu to select Paste Special, and then choose the
appropriate data type from the list. For example, suppose you want to be able to edit the pasted
cells in Excel later. You can use Paste Special and choose Microsoft Excel Worksheet Object as
the type. (More on this shortly.)
To embed new data, you use the Object button on the Insert tab, and then choose to create a
new embedded object of the desired type. (More on this shortly, too.) For example, suppose you
have a favorite program for creating organization charts. You can start a new embedded organi-
zation chart on a PowerPoint slide instead of using PowerPoint’s own SmartArt hierarchy chart.
That organization chart is then stored only within your PowerPoint ﬁle, not separately.
Yet another choice is to link the data from its original source ﬁle. When you do this, PowerPoint
maintains information about the name and location of the original, and each time you open the
presentation ﬁle it rechecks the original to see if any changes have been made to the original data
ﬁle. If so, PowerPoint updates its copy of the object to the latest version. For example, suppose
you want to include data from an Excel workbook that a coworker is creating. He warns you
that his data is not ﬁnal yet, but you want to create the presentation anyway. By creating a link
to his data, rather than pasting a static copy of it, you ensure that you will always have the latest
data no matter how many times he changes it.
You can create a link to an entire ﬁle or to a speciﬁc part of a ﬁle. For example, you can link to
the entire Excel workbook, or just to a certain range of cells on a certain sheet. The procedures
are different — for the entire ﬁle you use Object (Insert tab), but for a portion of the ﬁle you use
Paste Special (Home tab). Both methods create a link to the entire Excel workbook, but Object
automatically displays the entire ﬁrst sheet of the workbook in your PowerPoint ﬁle, whereas
Paste Special displays only the cells that you’ve selected.
Copying Content from Other Programs
Let’s assume for the moment that you don’t need any special linking or embedding. You just
want the content from some other program to be placed on a PowerPoint slide. You have two
choices: Use the Clipboard, or use drag-and-drop.
422

Chapter 15: Incorporating Content from Other Programs
Using the Clipboard
The easiest way to place something into PowerPoint is to use the Windows Clipboard. Because
almost all Windows-based programs employ the Clipboard, you can move data from any pro-
gram to almost any other with a minimum of fuss. Follow these steps:
1.
Create the data in its native program or open a ﬁle that contains it.
2.
Select the data you want, and click Copy on the Home tab, or if it is not an Ofﬁce
program, choose Edit ➪Copy.
Note
Ctrl+C always works to copy to the Clipboard, so use that if you can’t ﬁnd the copy command in the
application. ■
3.
Switch to PowerPoint, and display the slide on which you want to place the content.
4.
Click Paste on the Home tab. The content appears on the slide. PowerPoint makes its
best guess as to the correct formatting. For example, if you paste Excel worksheet cells,
it attempts to convert them to a table because that’s the closest match among the native
PowerPoint layouts.
5.
Move or resize the new content as necessary on the slide.
Note
Don’t forget that there are many alternative methods for using the Copy and Paste commands. The shortcut
keys are among the fastest: Ctrl+C for copy and Ctrl+V for paste. ■
PowerPoint, like all Ofﬁce 2010 applications, has an enhanced version of the Clipboard that is
available when both the source and destination locations are Microsoft Ofﬁce applications. It
enables you to copy more than one item at a time to the Clipboard, and then choose among
them when pasting. When pasting to a non-Ofﬁce application, however, only the last item
copied to the Clipboard is available.
When you copy twice in a row without pasting while in an Ofﬁce application, the Clipboard
task pane appears, with each copied clip separately listed. (If it doesn’t, see the following note.)
You can also open this Clipboard task pane by clicking the dialog box launcher in the Clipboard
group on the Home tab.
Tip
If pressing Ctrl+C twice doesn’t open the clipboard, open the task pane the other way (by clicking the dia-
log box launcher in the Clipboard group on the Home tab), and then click the Options button and click
Show Ofﬁce Clipboard When Ctrl+C Is Pressed Twice. ■
You can then open the destination and click the clip you want to paste. Or you can click the
down arrow next to a clip and choose Delete to delete it. See Figure 15-1.
423

Using the Ofﬁce 2010 Clipboard task pane enables you to copy more than one clip to

Tip
Fine-tune the way the Clipboard works in Ofﬁce 2010 applications by clicking the Options button
at the bottom of the Clipboard task pane. This opens a menu from which you can specify when and
how the Clipboard task pane appears. For example, you can set it to show a Clipboard icon in the
taskbar. See Figure 15-2. ■
FIGURE 15-2

424

Chapter 15: Incorporating Content from Other Programs
As mentioned earlier, when you are copying and pasting some types of content, especially graph-
ical types, PowerPoint embeds the content by default rather than simply pasting it.
Embedding the content tends to increase the size of the PowerPoint presentation ﬁle, so
avoid doing it unless you think you will need that capability. (More on embedding later in
the chapter.) You can tell whether content has been embedded by double-clicking it. If it’s
embedded, its native application will open within PowerPoint (or in a separate window). If it’s
not embedded, a PowerPoint dialog box will open for the content. To avoid embedding content
that PowerPoint wants to embed by default, follow these steps:
1.
Copy the data to the Clipboard in its native application.
2.
In PowerPoint, on the Home tab, open the Paste button’s menu and click Paste Special.
3.
Choose a different format for the paste, such as Bitmap. Do not choose the format that
ends with ‘‘Object’’ or you will get an embedded copy.
4.
Click OK.
Alternatively, you can use one of the icons at the bottom of the Paste Special menu to quickly
choose a speciﬁc type of paste operation. See Figure 15-3. For example, you can choose to keep
the source formatting, use the destination theme, paste as a picture, or paste as plain text.
FIGURE 15-3
Use the buttons on the Paste Special menu to choose how a paste should occur.

Using Drag-and-Drop
In some cases, you can also use drag-and-drop to move an object from some other application
(or from a ﬁle management window) to PowerPoint. Not all Windows programs support this
feature though. If you’re not sure whether a program supports it, try it and see. Here’s how to
drag and drop something:
1.
Create the object in its native program or open the ﬁle that contains it. The object can be
a single unit such as an entire graphic, or it can be a small piece of a larger document or
image such as a few cells selected from a large worksheet.
425

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
2.
Open PowerPoint and display the slide on which you want to place the data.
3.
Resize both applications’ windows so that both the data and its destination are visible
on-screen.
4.
Select the data in its native program.
5.
If you want to copy, rather than move, hold down the Ctrl key.
6.
Drag the content to the PowerPoint slide. An outline appears on the PowerPoint slide
showing where the data will go.
7.
Release the mouse button. The data is moved or copied.
Caution
When dragging-and-dropping from Excel, data arrives in PowerPoint in a plain text box, with columns and
rows separated by spaces. If you want to retain the original tabular format from Excel, use copy-and-paste,
not drag-and-drop. ■
As with copying and pasting, not all content gets the ‘‘plain paste’’ treatment when you drag and
drop. Generally speaking, text-based data will drag without embedding, but graphic-based data
will usually embed. (There are exceptions.) Use the Paste Special method described earlier rather
than drag and drop if you run into this situation.
Inserting Graphics from a File
When you use copy-and-paste or drag-and-drop to insert content from a graphics-based appli-
cation, as mentioned in the preceding section, PowerPoint embeds by default. This makes the
ﬁle size larger than necessary for the PowerPoint presentation, however, so it’s better to use the
Picture button (Insert tab) when you insert graphics. This inserts a plain-old copy of the picture,
without embedding, and keeps the PowerPoint ﬁle size more manageable.
Introducing OLE
The abbreviation OLE stands for Object Linking and Embedding. It enables Windows-based appli-
cations that support it to share information dynamically. That means that the object remembers
where it came from and has special abilities based on that memory. Even though the name OLE
is a little scary (it ranks right up there with SQL in my book!), the concept is very elementary,
and anyone can understand and use it.
You already understand the term object in the PowerPoint sense, and the term is similar to that
in the case of OLE. An object is any bit of data (or a whole ﬁle) that you want to use in another
program. You can paste it in with no connection to its source, or you can link or embed it.
Two actions are involved in OLE: linking and embedding. Here are quick deﬁnitions of each:
 Linking creates a connection between the original ﬁle and the copy in your presentation,
so that the copy is always updated.
 Embedding creates a connection between the object in the presentation and the application
that originally created it, so that you can edit the object in that original application at any
time from within PowerPoint.
426

Chapter 15: Incorporating Content from Other Programs
The key difference is that linking connects to the source data ﬁle, whereas embedding connects
to the source application.
For a link to be updatable, linked objects must already exist independently of the PowerPoint
presentation. For example, if you want to link an Excel chart, you must ﬁrst create that chart in
Excel and save your work in an Excel ﬁle. That way, PowerPoint has a ﬁlename to refer to when
updating the link.
Caution
Links can slow down your presentation’s loading and editing performance. Therefore, you should create
links last, after you have ﬁnished adding content and polishing the formatting. ■
Linking and embedding are not appropriate for every insertion. If you want to use content (such
as cells from an Excel worksheet or a picture from a graphics program) that will not change, it’s
best to copy it normally. For the Excel data cells or text from a Word document, use regular
Copy/Paste; for the graphic image, use Picture (on the Insert tab). Reserve linking for objects
that will change and that you will always need the most recent version of. Reserve embedding
for objects that you plan to edit later and require the native applications editing tools to do so.
Here are some ideas of when linking or embedding might be useful:
 If you have to give the same presentation every month that shows the monthly sales statis-
tics, link to your Excel worksheet where you track them during the month. Your presenta-
tion will always contain the most current data.
 If you want to draw a picture in Paint (a program that comes with Windows) or some other
graphics program, embed the picture in PowerPoint. That way, you don’t have to open
Paint (or the other program) separately every time you want to work on the picture while
you’re ﬁne-tuning your presentation. You can just double-click the picture in PowerPoint.
You can always break the link when you ﬁnalize the presentation if you want to cut down
on the ﬁle size.
 If you know that a coworker is still ﬁnalizing a chart or drawing, link to her working ﬁle
on the network. Then whenever changes are made to it, your copy will also be updated.
(Beware, however, that once you take your presentation away from the computer that has
network access, you can no longer update the link.)
Linking and/or Embedding Part of a File
As I mentioned earlier, you can link or embed either a part of an existing ﬁle or the whole ﬁle.
If you need only a part of an existing ﬁle, such as a few cells from a worksheet, an individual
chart, or a few paragraphs of text, you use the following procedure:
1.
In its native application, create or open the ﬁle containing the data you want to copy.
2.
If you have just created the ﬁle, save it. The ﬁle should have a name before you go any
further if you are linking; this is not necessary for embedding, but it won’t hurt anything.
3.
Select the data you want.
427

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
4.
On the Home tab, click Copy, or press Ctrl+C.
5.
Switch to PowerPoint and display the slide on which you want to paste the data.
6.
On the Home tab, open the Paste button’s menu and click Paste Special. The Paste Special
dialog box opens. See Figure 15-4.
FIGURE 15-4
Use the Paste Special dialog box to link or embed a piece of a data ﬁle from another program.
7.
If you want to embed, leave Paste selected. If you want to link, click Paste Link.
8.
Choose the format from the As list. Because you want to link or embed, choose a type that
ends with the word object.
9.
If you want the pasted object to appear as an icon instead of as itself, mark the Display as
Icon check box. This check box might be unavailable if the object type you chose in step
8 does not support it.
10.
Click OK. The object is placed in your presentation.
If you link the object, each time you open your PowerPoint presentation, PowerPoint checks the
source ﬁle for an updated version. If you embed the object, you can double-click it at any time
to open it in its native application for editing.
Perhaps you are wondering about the other data types. If you chose Paste in step 7 (rather than
Paste Link), you will see other formats on the list. All of these are non-linkable, non-embeddable
formats. The choices depend on the type of data, but include some of the following:
 Formatted Text (RTF): This data type formats text as it is formatted in the original ﬁle.
For example, if the text is formatted as underlined in the original ﬁle, it is pasted as under-
lined text in PowerPoint.
 HTML Format: This option formats the content as it would be formatted on a Web page.
 Unformatted Text: This option ignores the formatting from the native ﬁle and formats
the text as the default PowerPoint font you’ve speciﬁed.
 Picture (Windows Metaﬁle): The object appears as a 16-bit WMF-format graphic.
428

Chapter 15: Incorporating Content from Other Programs
 Picture (Enhanced Metaﬁle): The object appears as a 32-bit EMF-format graphic.
 Device Independent Bitmap: The object comes in as a bitmap picture, like a Windows
Paint image.
Tip
Enhanced Metaﬁle is, as the name implies, an updated and improved ﬁle format from Windows
Metaﬁle. It is a 32-bit format, whereas Windows Metaﬁle is a 16-bit format. Enhanced metaﬁle
graphics cannot be used in MS-DOS or 16-bit Windows applications. If that backward-compatibility is
important to use, use Windows Metaﬁle. You can get more information about Windows metaﬁles at
multivac.fatburen.org/localdoc/libwmf/caolan/ora-wmf.html. ■
Embedding an Entire File
Sometimes you might want to place an entire ﬁle on a PowerPoint slide — for example, if the
ﬁle is small and contains only the object that you want to display, like a picture. To create this
connection, you use the Object button (on the Insert tab), which is handier than the procedure
you just learned because you do not have to open the other application.
1.
In PowerPoint, display the slide on which you want to place the ﬁle.
2.
Choose Insert ➪Object. The Insert Object dialog box opens.
3.
Click the Create from File button. The controls change to those shown in Figure 15-5.
4.
Click Browse, and use the Browse dialog box to locate the ﬁle you want. Then click OK to
accept the ﬁlename.
5.
(Optional) If you want to link instead of embed the ﬁle, mark the Link check box.
FIGURE 15-5
Enter the ﬁlename or browse for it with the Browse button.
429

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Caution
Do not link to a ﬁle housed on a disk that might not always be available during your presentation. For
example, don’t link to a ﬂoppy or USB ﬂash drive unless you are also storing the presentation ﬁle on the same
drive. And don’t link to a network drive unless you know the network will be available at show time from the
computer on which you will present. ■
6.
Click OK. The ﬁle is inserted on your PowerPoint slide.
You can tell that the ﬁle is embedded, rather than simply copied, because when you double-click
it, it opens in its native application. In contrast, when you double-click an item that is copied
without embedding, its Properties box or some other PowerPoint-speciﬁc dialog box opens in
PowerPoint. If you choose to link the object, you need to edit it in the native application.
Embedding a New File
If you want to embed a foreign object, but you haven’t created that object yet, a really easy way
to do so is to embed it on the ﬂy. When you do this, the controls for the program open within
PowerPoint (or in a separate application window, depending on the application) and you can
create your object. Then, your work is saved within PowerPoint rather than as a separate ﬁle.
1.
Open PowerPoint and display the slide on which you want to put the new object.
2.
Choose Insert ➪Object. The Insert Object dialog box appears.
3.
Click Create New. A list of available object types appears. See Figure 15-6.
FIGURE 15-6
Choose the object type you want to create. The object types listed come
from the OLE-compliant programs installed on your PC.
4.
Click the object type you want and then click OK. The application opens.
5.
Depending on the application, additional dialog boxes might appear. For example, if you
are creating a new graphic object, a box might appear asking you about the size and color
depth. Respond to any dialog boxes that appear for creating the new object.
430

Chapter 15: Incorporating Content from Other Programs
6.
Create the object using the program’s controls. The program might be in a separate
window from PowerPoint, or it might be contained within the PowerPoint window as in
Figure 15-7.
FIGURE 15-7
The embedded program’s controls appear, with PowerPoint in the background.
7.
When you are ﬁnished, if the program was opened within PowerPoint, click anywhere
on the slide outside of that object’s frame. Or, if the application was in a separate
window, choose File ➪Exit and Return to Filename (where Filename is the name of
your PowerPoint ﬁle). If you are prompted to save the ﬁle, choose No.
Tip
If you are prompted to save the object in a ﬁle and you choose Yes, the application creates a copy of the object
that exists outside of PowerPoint. The copy is not linked to PowerPoint. ■
If you are asked whether you want to update the object in Filename before proceeding, you
should choose Yes. This prompt occurs in many of the applications that open in separate
windows.
8.
Resize and move the object on the slide as necessary.
431

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Because you are creating a ﬁle that doesn’t have a name or saved location separate from the
PowerPoint presentation, there is no need to link it to anything. Embedding is the only option.
Working with Linked and Embedded
Objects
Now that you have a linked or embedded object, what can you do with it? Many things. You can
edit an embedded object by double-clicking it, of course. And you can update, change, and even
break the links associated with a linked object. The following sections provide some details.
Opening and Converting Embedded Objects
When you select an embedded object in PowerPoint and then right-click the object, you can
choose datatype Object where datatype is the object type. (Its exact name depends on the object
type, for example, Worksheet Object.) From the submenu you can choose the following:
 Edit: Opens the object for editing within PowerPoint (if possible). Some applications can
work from within PowerPoint, such as the Excel example in Figure 15-7. If the object is
related to an application that can’t do this, the object opens for editing in a separate win-
dow for that application.
 Open: Opens the object for editing in a separate window for the application with which it
is associated.
 Convert: Opens a dialog box that enables you to convert the object to some other type (if
possible). This sounds great in theory, but in practice there are usually very few alternatives
to choose from.
Tip
Although convert options also appear for linked objects, you cannot convert them; you must break the link
ﬁrst. That’s because a linked object must have a certain object type to maintain its link. Even after breaking
a link, there might not be any viable choices for converting it to other formats. ■
Editing a Linked or Embedded Object
To edit a linked or embedded object, follow these steps:
1.
Display the slide containing the linked or embedded object.
2.
Double-click the object. The object’s program controls appear. They might be integrated
into the PowerPoint window, such as the ones for Excel that you saw in Figure 15-7, or
they might appear in a separate window.
3.
Edit the object as needed.
4.
Return to PowerPoint by doing one of the following:
432

Chapter 15: Incorporating Content from Other Programs
 If the object is embedded (not linked), click the slide behind the object to return to
PowerPoint.
 If the object is linked, choose File ➪Exit. Remember, the menu system that appears is
for the embedded application, not for PowerPoint. When you are asked to save your
changes, click Yes.
You can also edit a linked object directly in its original application, independently from
PowerPoint. Close your PowerPoint presentation and open the original application. Do your
editing, and save your work. Then, reopen your PowerPoint presentation and the object will
reﬂect the changes.
Changing How Links Update
OLE links are automatically updated each time you open your PowerPoint ﬁle. However,
updating these links slows down the ﬁle opening considerably, so if you open and close the ﬁle
frequently, you might want to set the link updating to Manual. That way, the links are updated
only when you issue a command to update them. To set a link to update manually, follow these
steps:
1.
Open the PowerPoint presentation that contains the linked object(s).
2.
Choose File ➪Info and then click the Edit Links to Files hyperlink at the right. The Links
dialog box appears as shown in Figure 15-8.
FIGURE 15-8
You can change the update setting for the links in your presentation here.
3.
Click the link that you want to change.
4.
Click the Manual button.
5.
If you want to change any other links, repeat steps 3 and 4. You can also use the Shift and
Ctrl keys to select more than one link at once.
6.
If you want to update a link now, select it and click the Update Now button.
433

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
7.
Click OK.
8.
Choose File ➪Save to save the presentation changes (including the changes to the
link settings).
When you set a link to manual, you have to open the Links dialog box and click Update Now, as
in step 6, each time you want to update it. Or, you can right-click the object and choose Update
Link from its shortcut menu.
Breaking a Link
When you break a link, the object remains in the presentation, but it becomes an ordinary
object, just like any other picture or other object you might have placed there. You can’t
double-click it to edit it anymore, and it doesn’t update when the source changes. To break a
link, reopen the Links dialog box shown in Figure 15-8 (File ➪Info ➪Edit Links to Files), click
the link to break, and then click Break Link. If a warning box appears, click OK.
When you break a link, embedding information disappears, too. For example, if you have a
linked Excel chart and you break the link, the result is a simple pasted image of the chart with
no ties to the Excel application. To reestablish a link, simply recreate it as you did originally.
Changing the Referenced Location of a Link
If you move ﬁles around on your hard disk, or move them to other disks, you might need to
change the link location reference. For example, perhaps you are moving the presentation ﬁle
to a ﬂash drive and you want to place all of the linked ﬁles needed for the presentation in a
separate folder on the ﬂash drive. To change a link reference, do the following:
1.
Copy or move the ﬁles where you want them. For example, if you want to transfer the
presentation and linked ﬁles to a CD, do that ﬁrst.
2.
Open the PowerPoint presentation that contains the linked object(s) to change. If you
copied the presentation to some new location, make sure you open the copy that you want
to change.
3.
Choose File ➪Info ➪Edit Links to Files. The Links dialog box opens, as shown in
Figure 15-8.
4.
Click the link you want to change.
5.
Click Change Source. A Change Source dialog box opens. It is just like the normal Open
dialog boxes you have worked with many times.
6.
Select the ﬁle to be linked from its new location, and click Open. The link is updated.
7.
In the Links dialog box, click Close.

Chapter 15: Incorporating Content from Other Programs
Caution
If you change the location of a link to a different ﬁle, depending on the object type, the link may change
to refer to the entire ﬁle, as if you had inserted it with Insert ➪Object. If you used Edit ➪Paste Special,
Paste Link to insert only a part of the original ﬁle, that aspect might be lost and the entire ﬁle might appear
as the object in the presentation. In such situations, it is better to delete the object and recreate the link
from scratch. ■
Exporting PowerPoint Objects to
Other Programs
You can copy any object in your PowerPoint presentation to another program, either linked or
unlinked. For example, perhaps you created a chart using the PowerPoint charting tools for one
of your PowerPoint slides, and now you want to use that chart in a Microsoft Word document.
To use a PowerPoint object in another program, you do the same basic things that you’ve learned
in this chapter, but you start with PowerPoint. Here are some examples:
 To copy an object from PowerPoint, select it in PowerPoint and copy it to the Clipboard
(Ctrl+C). Then switch to the other program and Paste (Ctrl+V).
 To embed (or optionally link) an object from a PowerPoint presentation into another pro-
gram’s document, choose it in PowerPoint and copy it (Ctrl+C). Then, switch to the other
program and use Paste Special. (In programs other than Ofﬁce 2010, the command is usu-
ally Edit ➪Paste Special.)
 To embed or link an entire PowerPoint presentation in another program’s document, use
the Object command in that other program (probably on an Insert tab or menu), and
choose your PowerPoint ﬁle as the source.
You can also save individual slides as various types of graphics with the File ➪Save As com-
mand, as you learned to do in Chapter 3.
Summary
In this chapter, you learned the mysteries of OLE, a term you have probably heard bandied
about but were never quite sure what it meant. You can now use objects freely between
PowerPoint and other programs, and include links and embedding for them whenever
appropriate.
In the next chapter, you learn how to add sound effects, music, and soundtracks to a
presentation.

W
hether it’s a simple sound effect or a complete musical sound-
track, sounds in a PowerPoint presentation can make a big dif-
ference in the audience’s perception of your message. In this
chapter, you will learn when and how to use sounds, how to place them
in the presentation, and how to manage their playback.
How PowerPoint Uses Sounds
There are several ways that you can include a sound in a presentation:
 Insert a sound ﬁle. The sound plays during the presentation when-
ever anyone points to or clicks the sound icon, or plays automatically,
depending on the settings that you specify. This is useful in an inter-
active presentation because it gives the audience a choice of whether
to play the sound.
 Associate a sound with an object (such as a graphic), so that the
sound plays when anyone points to or clicks that object. This is
another good technique for interactive presentations.
 Associate a sound with an animation effect (such as a series
appearing in a graph), so that the sound plays when the animation
effect occurs. For example, you might have some text ‘‘drive in’’ onto
a slide and associate the sound of an engine revving with that action.
 Associate a sound with a slide transition (a move from one slide
to the next), so that the sound plays when the next slide appears. For
example, you may assign a shutter-click sound, such as the sound
that a slide projector makes when it changes slides, to the transitions
between slides.
437

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
 Insert a musical soundtrack that plays automatically in the background. This is
useful for unattended (kiosk-style) presentations.
Cross-Reference
In this chapter, you learn about inserting ﬁles as icons, associating them with objects, and creating musical
soundtracks. Chapter 18 covers transition and animation sounds. ■
Understanding Sound File Formats
Computer sound ﬁles come in several formats, but they can be divided into two broad categories:
waveform (often abbreviated as WAV or wave) and MIDI.
 Waveform: This can refer to a speciﬁc ﬁle format that has a .wav extension, but it can also
refer generically to any sound ﬁle that has an analog origin. For example, when you record
sound using a microphone, the resulting ﬁle is a waveform ﬁle because it was originally a
‘‘sound wave’’ that the microphone captured. The tracks on an audio CD and MP3 clips can
also be considered waveform ﬁles because at some point, presumably, a person went to a
recording studio and made music with their voice or with instruments that were recorded.
Other waveform formats include WMA, RMI, AU, AIF, and AIFC. Waveform ﬁles sound
very realistic because they are recordings of real-life sounds. The drawback is that the ﬁle
size is typically large. MP3 is a relatively compact format, but even MP3 ﬁles require about
1MB per minute of recording.
 MIDI: MIDI stands for multi-instrument digital interface, and refers to the interface
between a computer and a digital instrument such as an electronic keyboard. When you
make a MIDI recording, there is no analog source — it is purely digital. For example, you
press a key on an electronic keyboard, and that key press is translated into instructions
that are written to a computer ﬁle. No microphone, and no sound waves in the air. What
is the sound of one key pressing? It is completely up to the software. It could sound like
a piano, a saxophone, or a harpsichord — whatever instrument it is set up to ‘‘be’’ at
the moment. MIDI ﬁles (usually identiﬁed by a .mid extension) are smaller in size than
waveform ﬁles, and several minutes of recording typically take up much less than 1MB of
space. The drawback to MIDI music is that it can sound rather artiﬁcial and cold. After all,
a computer emulating a saxophone is not the same thing as a real saxophone.
You need to understand the difference between these sound formats so that you can choose the
correct format when recording sounds for your presentation, or when choosing recorded music.
Keep in mind that whenever you use a waveform ﬁle in a presentation, you will add considerably
to the presentation’s ﬁle size. But also keep in mind that when you choose MIDI over waveform
for your music, you get a different type of music, one that sounds more artiﬁcial.
Caution
The sounds available via Microsoft Ofﬁce’s clip art collection are royalty-free, which means that you can
use them freely in your presentation without paying an extra fee. However, if you download sounds from
the Internet or acquire them from other sources, you must be careful not to violate any copyright laws.
Sounds recorded from television, radio, or compact discs are protected by copyright law, and you or your
company might face serious legal action if you use them in a presentation without the permission of the
copyright holder. ■
438

Chapter 16: Adding Sound Effects, Music, and Soundtracks
Where to Find Sounds
There are sound collections available all over the Internet, just as there are clip art collections.
You can also buy sound collections on CD. If you ﬁnd yourself putting together a lot of presen-
tations, or searching the Internet for hours to ﬁnd speciﬁc sounds for this or that purpose, then
you might ﬁnd it more cost-effective to simply buy a good collection of sounds.
Here are some Web sites where you can ﬁnd some sounds:
 A1 Free Sound Effects ( www.a1freesoundeffects.com/noflash.htm): This Web
site offers a lot of free sounds for non-commercial use. You can also buy them quite
cheaply for commercial use.
 Microsoft ( http://office.microsoft.com) Microsoft offers a nice collection of free
sounds to work with Ofﬁce versions 2000 and higher.
 Partners in Rhyme ( www.sound-effect.com): This Web site offers sound and music
collections for sale, as well as some free ﬁles for download. Their background music clips
are cool because they are set up for perfect looping — that is, continuous play without a
noticeable break between the end and the beginning.
 Wav Central ( wavcentral.com): This is a big repository of all kinds of free sounds
in WAV format. (Beware of possible copyright violations, though; some of the clips here
appear to be from movies, TV shows, and so on.)
PowerPoint itself also offers a small selection of sounds, and you can ﬁnd out how to access them
within the program later in this chapter.
The Clip Art task pane can help you ﬁnd sounds in Microsoft’s collection of clips. Although the
collection of sounds is not as extensive as the collection of artwork, you may be able to ﬁnd
something of use.
Cross-Reference
This chapter does not speciﬁcally address the Clip Art task pane because it was covered quite thoroughly in
Chapter 12. ■
When to Use Sounds –– and When Not to
Sounds should serve the purpose of the presentation; you should never use them simply because
you can. If you add a lot of sounds purely for the fun of it, then your audience may lose respect
for the seriousness of your message. That being said, there are many legitimate reasons to use
sounds in a presentation. Just make sure that you are clear on what your reasons are before you
start working with them. Here are some ideas:
 For new slides: You can assign a recognizable sound, such as a beep or a bell, to each
slide, so that when your audience hears the sound, they know to look up and read the
new slide.
439

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
 For voice-overs: You can record a short voice-over message from a CEO or some other
important person who could not be there in person.
 For emphasis or humor: You can punctuate important points with sounds, or use sounds
to add occasional humorous touches.
However, if you are trying to pack a lot of information into a short presentation, you might want
to avoid sounds that take up presentation time when they play, such as elaborate sound effects.
You should also avoid sounds and other whimsical touches if you are delivering very serious
news. You may also want to avoid sounds if you intend to present on a very old and slow com-
puter because any kind of media clip — whether sound or video — will slow the system down
even more, both when you load the presentation and when you present it.
Now that you know where to ﬁnd sounds, and how to make intelligent decisions about their
use, let’s start using them in your presentations.
Inserting a Sound File as an Icon
The most elementary way to use a sound ﬁle in a presentation is to place the sound clip directly
on a slide as an object. An icon appears on the slide, and you can click the icon during the pre-
sentation to play the sound. This method works well if you want to play the sound at exactly the
right moment in the presentation.
Tip
To ‘‘hide’’ the sound icon, drag it off the edge of the slide. The sound still works, but the audience can-
not see the icon. You can also mark the Hide During Show check box on the Audio Tools Playback tab to
prevent the icon from appearing. ■
You can place a sound ﬁle on a slide in either of two ways: by selecting a sound from the Clip
Art task pane, or by selecting a sound from a ﬁle on your computer or network. The following
sections cover each method.
Tip
You can also assign the sound to an existing object on the slide, as explained in the section ‘‘Assigning a
Sound to an Object,’’ later in this chapter. When you do this, the object to which you attach the sound
serves the same function as an icon; you click the object to play the sound. ■
Choosing a Sound from the Clip Art Task Pane
You learned about the Clip Art task pane in Chapter 12. Its primary function is to help you
insert clip art (graphics), but it also manages sounds and movie ﬁles. The Clip Art task pane
is a good place to start if you are not sure which sound ﬁles are available or what kind of sound
you want.
Follow these steps to choose a sound from the Clip Art task pane:
1.
Make sure your Internet connection is enabled. This will make a much wider variety of
clips available.
440

Chapter 16: Adding Sound Effects, Music, and Soundtracks
2.
On the Insert tab, click the down arrow beneath the Audio button, and click Clip Art
Audio. The Clip Art task pane appears with icons for the available clips.
3.
(Optional) To narrow down the list of clips to only those with certain keywords, type the
keyword in the Search For text box and press Enter.
4.
(Optional) To preview the clip, do the following:
a. Right-click a clip and choose Preview/Properties from the shortcut menu. A
Preview/Properties dialog box opens, and the sound plays.
b. If you want to play the sound again, click the Play button (right-pointing triangle), as
shown in Figure 16-1.
c. (Optional) To preview another clip, click the Next (≥) or Previous (≤) buttons.
d. To close the dialog box, click Close.
FIGURE 16-1
You can preview a clip in the Preview/Properties dialog box.
Tip
The Preview/Properties dialog box also enables you to change or add keywords to the clip, as you did with the
clip art in Chapter 12. Click the Edit Keywords button to expand the dialog box to include controls for editing
the keyword list. ■
441

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
5.
Click the clip that you want to insert. An icon appears on the slide for it. When the icon is
selected, play controls appear below the icon, as shown in Figure 16-2.
FIGURE 16-2
The sound clip appears as a small speaker icon on the slide.

Controls appear

selected
Note
In PowerPoint 2010, inserted clips are set to play when clicked. This is a change from previous versions of
PowerPoint, which opened a dialog box asking you to choose whether the sound should play automatically or
only when clicked. You can change the default play behavior on the Audio Tools Playback tab, as you will learn
later in this chapter in the section ‘‘Conﬁguring Sound Playback.’’ ■
6.
Reposition and resize the icon if necessary. For example, in Figure 16-2, the icon has been
moved off to the corner where it is less noticeable.
Tip
If you don’t want the icon to appear at all on the slide, mark the Hide During Show check box on the Audio
Tools Playback tab, or drag the icon completely off the slide (for example, to the left or right of the slide). Be
careful though. If you set the sound to play only when its icon is clicked, and then you hide the icon, you lose
access to it. ■
7.
If you want to insert another sound clip, repeat steps 3 to 6. If you are ﬁnished with the
Clip Art task pane for now, close it by clicking its Close (X) button.
442

Chapter 16: Adding Sound Effects, Music, and Soundtracks
Choosing a Sound from a File
If the sound that you want is not accessible from the Clip Art task pane, you can either add it to
the Clip Organizer, as you learned in Chapter 12, or you can simply import it from a ﬁle. The
former technique is better if you plan to use the clip a lot; the latter makes more sense if you are
using the clip only once or expect to use it only infrequently.
Note
If you installed PowerPoint or Ofﬁce using the default options, then there are many sound ﬁles available
in the Windows\Media folder on your hard disk. You can use one of these ﬁles if you want to practice the
following steps. ■
Follow these steps to insert a sound from a ﬁle:
1.
On the Insert tab, click the Audio button (or open its list and click Audio from File). The
Insert Audio dialog box opens.
2.
Navigate to the drive and folder that contain the sound that you want. If you do not know
which location to use, try the Windows\Media folder on the hard disk where Windows is
installed.
3.
Click the sound ﬁle that you want to use, as shown in Figure 16-3, and then click Insert.
A Speaker icon appears on the slide, as shown in Figure 16-2.
FIGURE 16-3
Choose a sound ﬁle from your hard disk or other location (such as your company’s network).
443

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Tip
Notice the arrow next to the Insert button in the Insert Audio dialog box (Figure 16-3). It opens a menu
from which you can choose to link the ﬁle instead of embedding it. Normally PowerPoint embeds almost all
content, but linking may be appropriate in special situations. ■
Conﬁguring Sound Playback
Now let’s look at some ways to control when the sound plays. You can adjust some basic settings
on the Audio Tools Playback tab, or ﬁne-tune playback settings with the Animations pane.
Adjusting Basic Playback Settings
Using the Audio Tools Playback tab, you can conﬁgure a variety of basic options that deﬁne
how the sound clip will play. For example, you can set whether it plays automatically or
not, how loudly it will play in relation to the other sounds in the presentation, and whether
or not it should repeat continuously.
To conﬁgure the sound’s basic playback properties, do the following:
1.
Click the icon to select it. Play controls appear beneath it and selection handles appear
around the icon.
2.
On the Audio Tools Playback tab, open the Start menu and choose an option: On Click,
Automatically, or Play Across Slides. See Figure 16-4.
FIGURE 16-4
Conﬁgure basic playback options on the Audio Tools Playback tab.
The Play Across Slides option enables the sound to continue to play even if the presenta-
tion advances to the next slide (or more). The default is to play across 999 slides; you will
learn how to specify a different number of slides in the next section.
3.
(Optional) Mark the Loop Until Stopped check box if you want the sound to play contin-
uously. By default the sound plays only once.
Note
The Rewind After Playing check box is available for sounds, but doesn’t do much. Rewinding leaves the clip
at its start point, rather than its end point, after playback. For a video, this makes a difference because it
controls which frame of the video remains on-screen after playback; for audio that’s not an issue. ■
444

Chapter 16: Adding Sound Effects, Music, and Soundtracks
Setting a Clip to Play on Mouse Click or Mouseover
Even if you set up a clip to play automatically, it still will play (or replay) if you click it. That’s
because, by default, it has an action setting applied to it that plays it on-click.
Action settings are a form of trigger animation. They set up the clip to be triggered (to play)
when something happens — for example, when they are clicked or touched with the mouse.
(Chapter 18 covers trigger animations in more detail.)
The Action Settings dialog box for a clip is accessed via the Insert ➪Action command. The dia-
log box has two tabs: Mouse Click and Mouse Over. Each tab is identical in its controls. With
them, you can deﬁne what happens when someone clicks the icon and when someone rolls the
mouse over the icon (without clicking).
As you can see in Figure 16-5, the selected sound clip will play when clicked. (The Object
Action is set to Play on the Mouse Click tab.) On the Mouse Over tab, by default, no action is
selected.

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
To set up a sound clip so that it plays when you roll the mouse over it (without clicking), follow
these steps:
1.
Select the clip on the slide.
2.
On the Insert tab, click Action. The Action Settings dialog box opens.
3.
Click the Mouse Over tab.
4.
Click the Object Action option button.
5.
Open the Object Action drop-down list and choose Play.
6.
Click OK.
Fine-Tuning Playback Settings in the Animation Pane
The Start setting for the clip (On Click, Automatically, or Play Across Slides) that you select on
the Audio Tools Playback tab sets up an animation event for the sound clip. You can view and
change this animation event from the Animation Pane.
To access a sound’s animation settings, click Animation Pane on the Animations tab. The
Animation Pane appears, and any audio or video clips you have inserted on the active slide
appear on the list there, along with any animations you have set up (see Chapter 18). In
Figure 16-6, there is only one animation: the audio clip.
FIGURE 16-6
More settings are available for an audio clip via the Animation Pane.

Chapter 16: Adding Sound Effects, Music, and Soundtracks
Tip
Clips that you insert from the Clip Art task pane have names that may be difﬁcult to remember and distin-
guish; for example, in Figure 16-6, the sound clip has a numeric name. You can rename a clip by choosing
Home ➪Selection ➪Selection Pane, and in the Selection and Visibility task pane, click the clip, press F2
(to rename), and type a new name for it. That new name will also be used in the Animation Pane to refer
to the clip. ■
Controlling When a Clip Will Play
In the Animation Pane, you can choose from three settings for a clip to play:
 Start On Click: Sets up a trigger animation so that the sound plays when you click its
icon.
 Start After Previous: Plays the sound automatically after the previous animation (if any).
For this to work, Automatically must be set for the start value on the Audio tools Play-
back tab.
 Start With Previous: Plays the sound simultaneously with the previous animation (if
any). For this to work, Automatically must be set for the start value on the Audio tools
Playback tab.
If there are no other animated events on the slide, the ‘‘previous event’’ is the slide itself appear-
ing, and the effect is identical to Start After Previous. The difference is apparent only if you have
multiple animation events on the slide; this setting enables you to synchronize multiple events to
occur simultaneously. Chapter 18 covers this in more detail.
To change a sound clip’s setting, follow these steps:
1.
Right-click the clip’s name on the Animation Pane. A menu opens. (The same menu opens
if you point at the clip’s name and then click the arrow button that appears on it.)
2.
Click the desired Start setting. See Figure 16-7.
When specifying a start point on the Audio Tools Playback tab, choosing On Click starts
the sound ﬁle when you click the mouse anywhere on the slide, even if you do not click the
sound icon itself. If you want the sound to play only when the sound icon is clicked (the
default when you insert a sound), make sure that a trigger is set up for it. To check this out,
right-click the sound’s entry in the Animation pane and choose Timing from the menu shown in
Figure 16-7. Then in the Play Audio dialog box, click Triggers, select the Start Effect on Click
Of option button, and make sure that the sound icon is chosen from the drop-down list. See
Figure 16-8.
Tip
In PowerPoint 2010, in Slide Show view a set of playback controls appears along with the sound icon, so
you can pause and play the clip using those controls during the show. This makes it less critical to have
pause and play triggers set up for the icon itself. ■

An audio clip can be set to play on click, after the previous animation event, or simultaneously
with the previous animation event.

Delaying or Repeating a Sound
Depending on the situation, it may be useful to have a sound play after a short delay, or to
repeat the sound more than once. In Chapter 18, you can learn more about setting animation
options. However, here are some quick instructions for customizing a sound:
1.
On the Animations tab, click Animation Pane to open the Animation Pane if it does not
already appear.
2.
Select the icon for the sound. A gray box appears around its name in the pane.
448

Chapter 16: Adding Sound Effects, Music, and Soundtracks
3.
Open the menu for the sound clip and choose Timing. The Play Audio dialog box opens
with the Timing tab displayed.
4.
Enter a number of seconds in the Delay text box. The delay occurs between when the
previous event happens and when the sound begins.
5.
Open the Repeat drop-down list and choose the number of times that the sound should
repeat. You can choose 2, 3, 4, 5, or 10 times, as well as Until Next Click, and Until
End of Slide. You can also type in your own number of times to repeat (up to 9999). See
Figure 16-9.
6.
Click OK.
FIGURE 16-9
You can use the Timing controls to delay the sound, and to make it repeat.
Choosing the Starting and Ending Point
for a Sound Clip
There might be times when you want to start the clip from some point other than the beginning.
For example, you may have a really good sound clip, except that the ﬁrst 5 seconds are garbled
or it may contain content that you do not want to use; or you may want to play just the ﬁrst
15 seconds of the clip.
PowerPoint supports two methods of controlling a clip’s starting point. The older method
involves using the Effect Options command and works in all presentations. The newer method
uses the Trim feature, which is available only in PowerPoint 2010. The Trim feature allows you
to set both a starting and an ending point for the clip; Effect Options can only alter the starting
point. I recommend that you use the trim feature whenever possible, falling back to the older
method only when working with older existing presentations that already use that feature.
449

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Setting the Starting Point with Effect Options
The Effect Options method enables you to set a starting point for the clip that is a certain num-
ber of seconds into it. It also enables you to specify whether the clip should start from the begin-
ning if you temporarily stop it and then restart, or whether it should start from the point at
which you left off.
To control the point at which a clip starts, do the following:
1.
Open the Animation Pane if it does not already appear (Animations ➪Animation Pane).
2.
Open the menu for the sound clip in the Animation Pane and choose Effect Options. The
Play Audio dialog box opens with the Effect tab displayed, as shown in Figure 16-10.
3.
In the Start Playing area, choose one of these options:
 From the Beginning, which is the default play mode.
 From the Last Position if you want it to pick up where it left off when you stopped it.
 From Time, and then enter the number of seconds into the clip that it should begin
playing.
4.
Click OK.
FIGURE 16-10
You can specify that a clip plays at a different time than the beginning, or set it to restart playing
from wherever it left off if you stop it.
Setting the Starting and Ending Point by Trimming
Trimming is a new feature in PowerPoint 2010. It works with both audio and video clips, and in
many cases it can help you avoid having to use a third-party video or audio editing program to
make simple cuts to a clip.
450

Chapter 16: Adding Sound Effects, Music, and Soundtracks
To trim an audio clip, follow these steps:
1.
Select the clip’s icon on the slide.
2.
On the Audio Tools Playback tab, click Trim Audio. The Trim Audio dialog box opens.
3.
Drag the green marker to the right to trim a portion of the beginning of the clip.
See Figure 16-11. Alternatively, enter a number of seconds to trim in the Start
Time box.
FIGURE 16-11
Trim from the beginning and/or end of the clip.
4.
Drag the red marker to the left to trim a portion of the end of the clip. Alternatively, enter
a number of seconds to trim in the End Time box.
5.
Preview the trimming by clicking the Play button. Then adjust the trimming as needed.
6.
When you are satisﬁed with the trim points, click OK to accept the trim.
Note
Trimmed parts of the clip will be deleted when you use the Compress Media command to decrease the size
of your presentation ﬁle. ■
Note
If you use both methods to specify a clip’s starting point — Effect Options (just explained) and trimming
(covered next) — the effects are not cumulative, but the longer of the two delays takes effect. So, for
example, if you speciﬁed 10 seconds for the Effect Options and 20 seconds for the Start Time in the Trim
Audio dialog box, the clip would be trimmed by 20 seconds at the beginning. Confusing? Yes. Stick with
one method or the other when possible. ■
Adjusting the Fade Duration
The fade duration is the amount of time at the beginning and/or end of the clip when the volume
will gradually increase (at the beginning) or decrease (at the end). The ability to adjust it is new
in PowerPoint 2010, and applies only to waveform audio clips (not MIDI).
451

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
To set a fade duration, follow these steps:
1.
Select the clip’s icon on the slide.
2.
On the Audio Tools Playback tab, enter a number of seconds in the Fade In box.
3.
Enter a number of seconds in the Fade Out box.
Setting a Clip to Continue across Multiple Slides
Normally a clip will stop playing after it has played once (or however many times you have set it
up to play), or until you click the mouse or advance to the next slide. However, if you are using
a music track such as an MP3 ﬁle, you might want it to continue playing across multiple slides.
Earlier in the chapter, you learned how on the Audio Tools Playback tab, you can set the Start
setting to Play Across Slides. When you do that, PowerPoint sets up that sound to continue play-
ing through 999 slides (or as many slides as you have, if fewer than that).
If you would like the clip to stop after fewer slides than that, you must adjust the Stop Playing
setting in the Play Audio dialog box. Follow these steps:
1.
In the Animation Pane, right-click the clip and choose Effect Options. The Play Audio
dialog box opens with the Effect tab displayed.
2.
In the Stop Playing area, choose one of these options:
 On Click to go back to the default play mode (same as choosing Start on Click
elsewhere).
 After Current Slide to stop the audio when you move to the next slide, or when the
clip has ﬁnished playing, whichever comes ﬁrst. This setting allows the clip to continue
playing through mouse clicks, as long as the slide does not advance.
 After
Slides, and then enter a number of slides; the audio will continue until
the speciﬁed number of additional slides have passed. Use 999 for the entire presenta-
tion, or use a smaller number, as in Figure 16-12.
3.
Click OK.
Tip
What if you want to jump around in an audio clip? For example, suppose you want to play the ﬁrst 20 sec-
onds of the clip, and then skip to the 75-second point. You can do that by inserting two separate copies of
the clip. Set each one with the start time desired for it, and then in the Animation Pane, set one of them
to continue After Previous and make the other copy the previous animation event. Alternately you can set
bookmarks on the audio control, and then add triggers to the bookmarks. (That latter method has the advan-
tage of keeping the ﬁle size smaller, since you have only one copy of the clip in the presentation.) Those
instructions will make more sense to you after you have read Chapter 18, which covers custom animation
effects in detail. ■

Specifying the Sound Volume
When you give your presentation, you can specify an overall volume using the computer’s vol-
ume controls in Windows. However, sometimes you might want the volume of one sound to be
different from others. To set the volume for a speciﬁc sound, follow these steps:
1.
Select the clip on the slide.
2.
On the Audio Tools Playback tab, click the Volume button. A menu appears.
3.
Choose the volume level you want (Low, Medium, High, or Mute).
You can also use a volume slider to adjust the volume more precisely than is possible with the
presets available in the preceding steps. Here’s how:
1.
Click the clip on the slide. Play controls appear under its icon.
2.
Click the speaker icon on the play controls. A Volume slider pops up. See Figure 16-13.
3.
Drag the slider up or down to adjust the clip’s volume.
Tip
The sound will play at a consistent volume throughout the duration of the clip. If you need the volume
to change partway through, you can use a sound-editing program to change the clip volume before
inserting it. ■

Click here for Volume slider
Changing the Appearance of the Sound Icon
The sound icon on the slide can be formatted like any other drawn object. You can resize
it by dragging its selection handles, or set a speciﬁc height and width from the Audio Tools
Format tab.
You can also right-click the sound icon and choose Format Audio to open its Format Audio dia-
log box, and from there you can apply any effects that you like (shadow, reﬂection, and so on).
All the controls in the Format Audio dialog box are strictly appearance-based and focused on the
icon; there is nothing there that controls the way the sound plays.
Assigning a Sound to an Object
Many presenters prefer to assign sound ﬁles to clip art or to other objects that they place in the
presentation, rather than inserting them with their own separate icons. This way, they still have
precise control over when a sound plays (for example, when they click a clip art image with
which a sound is associated), but the control mechanism is hidden.
Although you can assign a sound to any object, many people assign their sounds to graphics. For
example, you might attach a sound ﬁle of a greeting from your CEO to the CEO’s picture. The
picture would be set up as the trigger, and clicking on it would play the audio clip.
Sounds can also be assigned to objects via the Action Settings dialog box, which you learned
about earlier in the chapter. In that case, though, you are setting a mouse action for a non-sound
object, and attaching a sound effect to the action as a side effect. This method works only with
WAV-format ﬁles (the actual .wav ﬁle format, not just waveform clips); if you need to use any
other ﬁle format, you can use one of the other methods previously described in this chapter,
such as setting up the sound to trigger on click of another object.
Follow these steps to assign a sound to an object:
1.
Insert the object that you want to associate with the sound. For example, the object can be
a graphic, chart, or text box.
2.
Select the object, and on the Insert tab, click Action. The Action Settings dialog box
appears.
454

Chapter 16: Adding Sound Effects, Music, and Soundtracks
3.
Click either the Mouse Click tab or the Mouse Over tab, depending on which action you
want. As you learned earlier in the chapter, mouse-click plays the sound when you click
the object, while mouse over plays the sound when you move your mouse pointer over
the object.
4.
Mark the Play Sound check box. Then open the drop-down list and choose a sound,
as shown in Figure 16-14. You can choose from a variety of sounds that are stored in
C:\Windows\Media, or you can choose Other Sound to open the Add Sound dialog box
and pick a sound from any location. You can only use WAV sounds for this, though.
FIGURE 16-14
You can choose the sound that you want to assign to the object.
5.
Click OK. The object now has the sound associated with it so that when you click it or
move the mouse over it during the presentation, the sound plays.
Note
Chapter 18 is devoted entirely to transitions and animation effects, and so this chapter does not describe
them in detail. In Chapter 18, you can learn how to assign sounds to the transition between slides, or to
the movement (animation) of any object on any slide. ■
Adding a Digital Music Soundtrack
Digital music clips, such as MP3 and WMA ﬁles, work just like other audio clips. You insert
them using the Insert ➪Audio ➪Audio from File command, as described earlier in this chapter
in ‘‘Inserting a Sound File as an Icon.’’
455

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
In most cases, you will want the music to continue through multiple slides; see ‘‘Setting a Clip
to Continue Across Multiple Slides’’ earlier in this chapter to learn how to do that. (The easiest
way is to choose Audio Tools Playback ➪Start and select Play Across Slides.) In addition, you
will probably want to hide the icon for the audio track, so that it doesn’t get in the way. To do
this, select the icon on the slide and then choose Audio Tools Playback ➪Hide During Show.
By default in PowerPoint 2010, MP3 and WMA music tracks are embedded in the ﬁle, rather
than linked. If you want to link them, click the arrow next to the Insert button in the dialog box
where you select the clip and choose to link to the ﬁle. This works the same as with any other
audio clip. (Note that embedding was not the default in earlier versions of PowerPoint, so if you
are working with a ﬁle created in an earlier version that already has a music soundtrack, the ﬁle
may be linked; the easiest way to change that is to remove it and re-insert it.)
Adding a CD Audio Soundtrack
If you want to use music from a CD as the background music for your presentation, you might
want to rip the track(s) you want to your hard disk ﬁrst. To rip means to make a copy of the
track in a digital audio format such as MP3 or WMA and save it on your computer. You can
then play the track without having to have the CD in the computer. Nearly any music player
software will rip tracks for you; Audacity is one such program that works well, for example.
(Avoid using Windows Media Player because it adds digital rights management restrictions.) After
ripping the tracks, insert them into the presentation as you would any other audio ﬁle. See the
previous section for an outline of the process.
In some instances you may prefer to use audio tracks directly from the CD. This method keeps
the size of the presentation ﬁle small because the music clip is not embedded in it, but it
requires you to have the CD in the PC as you show the presentation. You cannot use CD audio
tracks in presentations that you plan to distribute as self-running presentations on a data CD or
over the Internet, because the computers on which it will run will not have access to the CD.
Adding the Insert CD Audio Command
to the Quick Access Toolbar
Microsoft recommends that you use digital audio tracks such as MP3 and WMA ﬁles for the
music in your presentation, so they have de-emphasized the command for inserting CD audio
in PowerPoint 2010. The command does not appear on the Ribbon by default. Therefore, if you
want to use this feature, you must add the command to the Quick Access Toolbar or to the
Ribbon. I’ll review the procedure for adding it to the Quick Access Toolbar here because it is
simpler; if you want to add it elsewhere on the Ribbon, see Chapter 24.
To add the Play CD Audio Track command to the Quick Access Toolbar, follow these steps:
1.
Choose File ➪Options. The PowerPoint Options dialog box opens.
2.
Click Quick Access Toolbar.
456

Chapter 16: Adding Sound Effects, Music, and Soundtracks
3.
Open the Choose Commands From drop-down list (above the left column) and select
Commands Not in the Ribbon.
4.
Scroll through the list of commands. Select Play CD Audio Track, and then click the
Add >> button to move it to the list on the right. See Figure 16-15.
FIGURE 16-15
Add the Play CD Audio Track button to the Quick Access Toolbar.
Quick Access
Toolbar
5.
Click OK. The command now appears on the Quick Access Toolbar (the row of buttons
above the File and Home tabs).
Placing a CD Soundtrack Icon on a Slide
To play a CD track for a slide, you must place an icon for it on the slide. You can place a range
of tracks, such as multiple tracks from a CD, using a single icon. To do so, follow these steps:
1.
Insert the CD in your PC.
2.
Click the Play CD Audio Track icon on the Quick Access Toolbar. (You learned how to
place it there in the previous section.) The Insert CD Audio dialog box appears.
3.
Specify the starting track number in the Start at Track text box in the Clip selection
section, as shown in Figure 16-16.
4.
Specify the ending track number in the End at Track text box. If you want to play only a
single track, the Start at Track and End at Track numbers should be the same. The start or
457

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
end time changes only after you click one of the up- or down-arrows next to the time. For
example, if you want to play tracks 1, 2, and 3, you should select track 1 as the start track
and track 3 as the end track (as opposed to track 4).
FIGURE 16-16
You can specify a starting and ending track, as well as a time within those tracks.
5.
If you want to begin the starting track at a particular spot (other than the beginning), enter
this start time in the Time text box for that track. For example, to start the track 50 sec-
onds into the song, you would type 00:50.
6.
By default, PowerPoint plays an entire track. If you want to stop the ending track at a
particular spot, enter this end time in the Time text box for that track. For example, in
Figure 16-16, track 1 is the starting track, and track 12 is the ending track, at 5 minutes
14 seconds long (05:14:90). If you wanted to end track 12 ten seconds early, you could
change the Time setting under End to 05:04:90. You can see the total playing time at the
bottom of the dialog box.
7.
(Optional) If desired, adjust the volume with the Sound Volume button. Click the button
and then drag its slider.
8.
Click OK. The CD icon appears in the center of the slide. You can drag it off the edge of
the slide if it interferes with your slide content. You can also resize it if you want, just like
any other object.
9.
Click the CD Audio Tools Options tab.
10.
Open the Play Track list and choose Play Across Slides.
Tip
You can play any number of tracks from a single CD using a single icon, as long as they are contiguous
and you play them in their default order. If you need non-contiguous tracks from the CD, or in a different
order, or you just want certain segments of some of the clips, then you must place each clip individually
on the slide, and then control their order in the Animation Pane. See Chapter 18 for details. If you do not
want the icons to appear on the slide, then drag them off the slide’s edge. ■
458

Chapter 16: Adding Sound Effects, Music, and Soundtracks
The CD track is now an animated object on your slide. By animated, I mean that it is an object
that has some action associated with it.
Controlling When a CD Track Plays
You can set many of the same properties for a CD track on a slide that you can for a sound ﬁle
icon. You can also use the Animation controls to specify precisely when and how a track will
play. To do this, follow these steps:
1.
Display the Animation Pane from the Animations tab.
2.
Select the CD icon on the slide. A gray box appears around its name in the Custom
Animation pane.
3.
Open the drop-down menu for the selected clip and choose Effect Options. This opens
the Play CD Audio dialog box.
From this point, the options are exactly the same as those for regular sound ﬁles that you have
learned about earlier in this chapter. All of the same tabs are available, including Effect, Timing,
and Sound Settings.
Using the Advanced Timeline
to Fine-Tune Sound Events
The Advanced Timeline is turned on by default. A timeline appears at the bottom of the
Animation Pane, and indicators appear next to each clip to show how long it will take to play
and at what point it starts. This is useful when you are trying to coordinate several sound and/or
video clips to play sequentially with a certain amount of space between them. It also saves you
from having to calculate their starting and ending times in relation to the initial appearance of
the slide.
To turn the Advanced Timeline on or off, do the following:
1.
If the Animation Pane does not already appear, click Animation Pane on the
Animations tab.
2.
Open the drop-down menu for any of the items in the pane and choose Show Advanced
Timeline. (If the command Hide Advanced Timeline appears instead, the advanced time-
line is already displayed; close the menu without selecting anything.)
3.
(Optional) Widen the Animation Pane by dragging its left border toward the center of the
slide, so that you have more working room.
4.
(Optional) Click the word Seconds at the bottom of the pane. This opens a menu where
you can choose Zoom In or Zoom Out to change the zoom on the timeline.
5.
Click a clip to select it on the Animation Pane. A right-pointing arrow appears next to
the clip. The arrow position corresponds to the place on the timeline where the clip is
currently set to begin.
459

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
6.
Open the clip’s drop-down menu and choose either With Previous or After Previous,
depending on how you want it to relate to the clip that precedes it.
Caution
If there is more than one sound clip set to After Previous, a vertical line appears where the ﬁrst clip will ﬁn-
ish. If a clip is set to After Previous, it cannot start before the clip that precedes it. Therefore, any delay that
you set up for a subsequent clip will be in relation to the end of the preceding clip. If the clip is set to With
Previous, the two can overlap. ■
7.
(Optional) To reorder the clips on the list, click a clip and then click the up or down
Re-Order arrow at the bottom of the pane.
8.
To change the amount of delay that is assigned to a clip, drag the red arrow next to the
clip to the right or left. This is the same as changing the number in the Delay text box in
the clip’s properties. See Figure 16-17.

Chapter 16: Adding Sound Effects, Music, and Soundtracks
Tip
You can use custom animation to create complex systems of sounds that play, pause, and stop in relation to
other animated objects on the slide. Although Chapter 18 contains full details, here is a quick explanation
of how to use custom animation: Add a sound to the Custom Animation pane by clicking Add Effect, then
choose Sound Actions, and then select Play, Pause, or Stop. In this way, you can create separate actions for
the same clip to start, pause, or stop at various points. ■
Recording Sounds
Most PCs have a microphone jack on the sound card where you can plug in a small microphone.
You can then record your own sounds to include in the presentation. In this case, I am referring
to simple, short sounds. If you want to record a full-blown voice-over narration, see Chapter 21.
To record a sound, follow these steps:
1.
Display the slide on which you want to place the sound clip.
2.
On the Insert tab, open the Audio button’s drop-down menu and choose Record Audio.
The Record Sound dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 16-18.
FIGURE 16-18
You can record your own sounds using your PC’s microphone.
3.
Click the Start Recording button.
4.
Record the sound. When you are ﬁnished, click the Stop Recording button (the black
square).
5.
(Optional) To play back the sound, click the Play button (the black triangle).
6.
Click OK to place the sound on the slide. A sound icon appears on the slide.
7.
Use the controls that you learned about earlier in this chapter to specify when and how
the sound plays.
Summary
In this chapter, you learned about the many ways that you can use sound in your presentation.
You learned how to place a sound object on a slide, how to associate sounds with other objects,
how to use a CD soundtrack, and how to record your own sounds. The next chapter continues
to discuss multimedia by looking at how you can place video clips on slides.

P
owerPoint 2010 has much better support for motion video than any
earlier version. It not only supports more video types (including
Flash, which was previously difﬁcult to integrate with PowerPoint),
but it allows you to trim the clip, bookmark a point in it, and add a wide
variety of formatting to it. In this chapter, you’ll learn how to insert and
conﬁgure motion video.
Understanding Video Types
Three cheers for Microsoft for increasing the number of video ﬁle types that
PowerPoint supports! Presentation developers have long been frustrated
by PowerPoint’s inability to accept certain ﬁle formats, but that problem
is largely in the past now. PowerPoint 2010 supports the formats listed in
Table 17-1.
Note
What’s the difference between a movie and a video? There really isn’t any.
PowerPoint uses the terms interchangeably. ■
PowerPoint treats most video types similarly, in terms of how much control
you have over their appearance and playback, except for the ﬁnal two in
Table 17-1: Adobe Flash Media and animated GIFs. Both of these deserve a
bit of special discussion.

Adobe Flash Media
Flash media (.swf) is a very versatile format for creating animated, and sometimes interactive,
demos and games. Other names for this format include Shockwave or Macromedia Flash.
(Macromedia was the company that developed Flash; they were acquired by Adobe.)
Flash media is commonly used in education because of its interactivity. Not only can a Flash
clip show movement through a process, but it can accept mouse clicks from a viewer. So, for
example, after illustrating a process, the clip can offer a multiple-choice quiz for review, with the
viewer clicking on the answers.
Flash is unique in PowerPoint in that it is not embedded in the ﬁle like other video formats; by
default it is linked.
PowerPoint does not offer a full set of controls for a Flash clip; you can’t trim it, for example,
and you can’t set it to fade in or out. However, you can place a Flash clip on a slide, resize
it, and control many appearance aspects of it, such as frame color.
Animated GIF
Animated GIFs are not really videos in the traditional sense. An animated GIF is a special type of
graphic that stores multiple versions of itself in a single ﬁle, and ﬂips through them in sequence,
like an animation created by ﬂipping the corners of a book. When the ﬁle is displayed — on
a presentation slide, a Web page, or some other place — it cycles through the still graphics at
a certain speed, making a very rudimentary animation. You cannot control the animation of an
animated GIF through PowerPoint, nor can you set it up to repeat a certain number of times.
464

Chapter 17: Incorporating Motion Video
That information is contained within the GIF ﬁle itself. PowerPoint simply reads that information
and plays the GIF accordingly.
PowerPoint’s Clip Organizer comes with many animated GIFs that have simple conceptual plots,
such as time passing, gears turning, and computers passing data between them. They are more
like animated clip art than real videos, but they do add an active element to an otherwise static
slide.
Tip
It is possible to convert an animated GIF to a ‘‘true’’ video format such as AVI. However, you can’t
do it using PowerPoint alone; you need a conversion utility. Corel Animation Shop will do this
( www.corel.com), as will many GIF-editing programs. ■
Choosing a File Format for Your Video Recordings
You may not have a choice in the settings used for the recording of live video or the ﬁle for-
mat. If you do have a choice, AVI is among the best formats for use in PowerPoint because of its
near-universal compatibility. There may be compatibility issues with video in some MPEG vari-
ants, such as MPEG-2 and MPEG-4, because you might need to install a separate DVD-playing
utility or a speciﬁc codec to handle those formats.
Cross-Reference
See the ‘‘Troubleshooting Videos That Won’t Play’’ section later in this chapter for more information on
MPEG variants. ■
On the theory that Microsoft-to-Microsoft always works, the Windows Media Video format
(.wmv) is also a good choice. Because Windows Movie Maker creates its videos in this format by
default, it’s a good bet that they will work well in PowerPoint.
Balancing Video Impact with File Size and Performance
Clip quality is usually measured either in frames per second (fps), which is anywhere from 15
(low) to 30 (high), or in kilobits per second, which is anywhere from 38 kbps to 2.1 mbps. You
might experiment with different settings to ﬁnd one with acceptable quality for the task at hand
with the minimum ﬁle size. For example, with Windows Movie Maker, a wide variety of quality
settings are available.
When you are recording your own video clips with a video camera or other device, it is easy to
overshoot. Video clips take up a huge amount of disk space, and inserting large video clips into
a PowerPoint ﬁle can make that ﬁle very large. Even if you choose to link the clips instead of
embedding them, the clips still take up space on your hard disk.
Depending on the amount of space available on your computer’s hard disk, and whether you
need to transfer your PowerPoint ﬁle to another PC, you may want to keep the number of sec-
onds of recorded video to a minimum to ensure that the ﬁle size stays manageable. On the other
465

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
hand, if you have a powerful computer with plenty of hard disk space and a lot of cool video
clips to show, go for it!
Tip
After you have completed the bulk of the editing work on your presentation, you may wish to use the
File ➪Compress Media command to decrease the resolution and/or increase the compression ratio on
the media clips in your presentation. Doing so may result in a minor loss of playback quality, but may make
the difference between a presentation ﬁtting or not ﬁtting on a particular disk. ■
Tip
If you are linking clips instead of embedding them, place the video clip in the same folder as the presenta-
tion ﬁle before inserting the video clip. This creates a relative reference to the clip within the PowerPoint
link to it, so that when you move both items to another location, the link’s integrity remains. ■
Locating Video Clips
Not sure where to ﬁnd video clips? Here are some places to start:
 Your own video camera. You can connect a digital video camera directly to your PC,
or connect an analog video camera to an adapter board that digitizes its input. Then you
use a video editing program to clean them up and transfer them to your hard disk. Most
video cameras come with such software; you can also use Windows Movie Maker (free
with Windows XP and Vista).
Tip
If you have Windows 7, Windows Movie Maker is not included. However, you can download it for free from
this link: http://download.live.com/moviemaker. You might want to download it anyway, even if you
have a version already in Windows XP and Vista, because that way you’ll get the most recent version. ■
 The Clip Organizer. When you’re connected to the Internet, you get the whole collection
as you browse. Most of these are animated GIFs, rather than real videos.
 The Internet in general. There are millions of interesting video clips on every imaginable
subject. Use the search term ‘‘video clips’’ plus a few keywords that describe the type
of clips you are looking for. Yahoo! is a good place to start looking (www.yahoo.com).
Some clips are copyrighted or have usage limitations, but others can be used freely; check
the usage information provided with the clip.
Caution
Whenever you get a video clip from the Internet, make sure you carefully read any restrictions or usage agree-
ments to avoid copyright violations. If you create a presentation using copyrighted material in an unauthorized
way, you or your company could potentially get sued. ■
466

Chapter 17: Incorporating Motion Video
 Commercial collections of video clips and animated GIFs. Many of these companies
advertise on the Internet and provide free samples for downloading. Several such compa-
nies have included samples on the CD that accompanies this book.
 The Internet Archive (www.archive.org). This site contains links to huge repositories
of public domain footage on all subjects, mostly pre-1960s material on which the copy-
right has expired. Warning — you can easily get sucked in here and waste several days
browsing!
Placing a Video on a Slide
Your ﬁrst step is to place the video on the slide. After that, you can worry about position, size,
and playing options.
Just as with audio clips, you can place a video clip on a slide using the Clip Organizer, or do so
directly by inserting from a ﬁle or pasting from another application.
Inserting a Video from a File
A video clip ﬁle inserted in PowerPoint 2010 can be either embedded or linked. (This is a
change from earlier versions of PowerPoint, in which all clips were linked.)
 Embedded: The default. The clip is inserted into the presentation ﬁle, so that if you copy
or distribute the presentation ﬁle, the clip goes along with it automatically. Because the
presentation ﬁle serves as a container for the clip, the presentation ﬁle’s size grows by
the size of the video clip ﬁle (plus a little extra for overhead).
 Linked: A link to the clip is placed on the slide, so that the clip does not take up space in
the presentation ﬁle. When you play back the presentation, the video clip must be in the
expected location for it to work.
Caution
If you plan on moving the presentation to another location later, and you want to use links, place the video
clip in the same folder as the presentation itself before you insert the video clip into the presentation. That
way the path to it stored in the presentation ﬁle will be relative, and the link will still work after you move
the presentation and video clip. Alternatively, you can use the Package Presentation for CD feature to trans-
fer a presentation and all of its support ﬁles, including videos, to a new location. See ‘‘Giving a Presentation
on a Different Computer’’ in Chapter 20. ■
Before inserting a clip, decide which method is best for your situation. Then follow these steps
(for all video types except animated GIF):
1.
Display the slide on which the video should appear.
2.
If there is a content placeholder on the slide that will accommodate a video clip, click that.
Otherwise, choose Insert ➪Video.
467

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
3.
In the Insert Video dialog box, locate and select the clip you want. You might need to
change the ﬁle type setting in the dialog box.
4.
If you want the clip to be embedded, click Insert.
Or
If you want the clip to be linked, click the down arrow to the right of the Insert button
and choose Link to File. See Figure 17-1.
The video clip appears on the slide.
FIGURE 17-1
To link, rather than embed, open the Insert button’s menu and choose Link to File.
Caution
If you are inserting a QuickTime clip, you will need to have a QuickTime player installed, and you need the
32-bit version of Ofﬁce. ■
Note
If you want to insert an animated GIF, and it is available via the Clip Organizer, use the steps in ‘‘Insert-
ing a Video from the Clip Organizer’’ later in this chapter. If you want to insert an animated GIF that is
a ﬁle on your hard disk, use the Insert ➪Picture command, as described in Chapter 13, ‘‘Working with
Photographic Images.’’ ■
468

Chapter 17: Incorporating Motion Video
Managing Video Links
In Chapter 15, ‘‘Working with Linked and Embedded Objects,’’ you learned how to update and
break links to outside content. Those same techniques work for linked video clips if you choose
to link them rather than embed them.
Choose File ➪Info ➪Edit Links to Files (on the right side of the screen) to open the Links dia-
log box. From there you can edit or break a link. See Figure 17-2.
FIGURE 17-2
You can manage the links in the presentation, including video links, from here.
Note
Another method of opening the Links dialog box is File ➪Info ➪View Links (it’s a hyperlink under the
Optimize Media Compatibility button). That works only if it’s a PowerPoint 2010 presentation, though; it
doesn’t work if it’s a PowerPoint 2003 or 2007 presentation until you choose File ➪Info ➪Convert to
update the ﬁle to the latest version. ■
Inserting a Clip as an Object
Another way to insert a clip is to place it as an object, rather than as a video. This creates an
icon on the slide that you can click to play the clip in an outside player (such as Windows Media
Player).
You can do this with any video clip type for strategic reasons. For example, there may be situa-
tions where you want to use an outside player, rather than playing the clip directly on the slide.
To insert a video as an object, follow these steps:
1.
Display the slide on which you want to insert the video.
2.
Choose Insert ➪Object. The Insert Object dialog box opens.
3.
Click Create from File.
469

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
4.
Click Browse. Locate and select the video to use, and click OK to return to the Insert
Object dialog box. See Figure 17-3.
FIGURE 17-3
Insert a clip as an object if you want it to open in a separate player.
5.
Click OK. An icon for the clip appears on the slide.
Inserting a Video from the Clip Organizer
Just as with sounds and graphics, you can organize video ﬁles with the Clip Organizer, which
is discussed in detail in Chapter 12. Most of the clips that come with the Clip Organizer are
animated GIFs rather than recorded videos.
To select a video from the Clip Organizer, follow these steps:
1.
Make sure your Internet connection is established (for the best selection of clips).
2.
Display the slide on which you want to place the video.
3.
On the Insert tab, click the down arrow on the Video button, and choose Clip Art Video.
The Clip Organizer task pane appears, showing the available video clips. Thumbnails of
each clip appear, showing the ﬁrst frame of the clip. You can tell that each is an animation
rather than a static graphic because of the little star icon in the bottom-right corner of each
thumbnail image. See Figure 17-4.
Note
The Clip Organizer shows real videos mixed together with animated GIFs in the search results. Check a clip’s
properties if you’re in doubt as to its type. ■
4.
(Optional) If you want to preview the clip, open its menu (the down arrow to its right)
and choose Preview/Properties. The clip plays in a dialog box; when you’re done watching
it, click Close.
470

Click the clip you want to insert.
6.
Close the Clip Organizer.
To test the video, enter Slide Show view and click it to play it (if it does not play automatically).
You can control when and how the clip plays; you learn to do that later in this chapter.
Tip
Many interesting clips are available through the Clip Organizer if you are connected to the Internet so you
can access the Microsoft site. Unlike with artwork, it is not obvious what a clip does just by looking at its
name and the ﬁrst frame (which is what appears as its thumbnail image). Take some time to insert a lot of
clips and try them out to see what you have to choose from. ■
Remember that you can add your own video clips to the Clip Organizer, as you learned in
Chapter 12, and you can categorize them, add keywords, and everything else that you can do to
artwork.

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Linking to an Internet Video
Web sites like YouTube are a rich source of video footage. Previous versions of PowerPoint did
not handle Internet-originated video clips very well, but PowerPoint 2010 provides a special
command just for linking to online video sources.
Caution
To link to a video clip online, you need the 32-bit version of PowerPoint 2010, Adobe Flash Player version
9 or above, and/or Windows Media Player version 10 or above, depending on the clip type. If you are using
the 64-bit version of PowerPoint 2010, the Insert ➪Video ➪Video from Web command is not available. ■
To link to an Internet video, follow these steps:
1.
Using your Web browser, navigate to the Web page for the clip you want to use, and copy
the Embed code to the Clipboard (Ctrl+C). It is usually provided in a text box somewhere
on the page; for example, in Figure 17-5 it appears to the right of the clip.
FIGURE 17-5
Copy the Embed code for the clip.
Embed code
472

Chapter 17: Incorporating Motion Video
Make sure you get the Embed code, not the URL code. The URL code would be what
you would paste into a browser window’s Address bar if you wanted to go directly to
that page.
2.
Display the slide on which you want to place the video clip link.
3.
Choose Insert ➪Video ➪Video from Web. The Insert Video From Web Site dialog
box opens.
4.
Paste the Embed code from the Clipboard into the dialog box (Ctrl+V). The code may
look similar to Figure 17-6. (Even though this is called Embed code, keep in mind that it
is really a link, not a true embedding.)
FIGURE 17-6
Paste the Embed code into the dialog box.
5.
Click Insert. The link to the clip appears on the slide.
There are some things you can’t do with a linked clip from the Internet, including trimming,
bookmarking, and fading. However, you can apply formatting to the clip much like a regular
video — you can change the frame shape, apply color corrections, add reﬂection, and so on.
Managing Videos Between PCs
and PowerPoint Versions
PowerPoint 2010 handles videos very differently than previous versions did, so there are some
differences you may encounter when moving a presentation to or from different versions of Pow-
erPoint. The following sections explain some basic techniques for minimizing the likelihood of
problems.
Working with Older Presentations in PowerPoint 2010
When you open a presentation created in an earlier version of PowerPoint, the video clips con-
tinue to play. However, you will probably want to update the ﬁle to PowerPoint 2010 format so
you can enjoy the additional capabilities.
473

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
After opening the ﬁle, choose File ➪Info ➪Convert to update it to PowerPoint 2010 format. In
the Save As dialog box that appears, specify a name for the new converted version (the original
remains intact) and click Save.
After saving the presentation in 2010 format, all PowerPoint 2010 video editing features are
available, just as if you had started this presentation in version 2010 from scratch.
Working with PowerPoint 2010 Presentations
in Older Versions
Older versions of PowerPoint did not allow videos to be embedded, and supported a smaller
number of ﬁle formats, so you may run into problems when you move a PowerPoint 2010 pre-
sentation to a PC that uses an earlier version. This may come as a surprise to some people,
because in most ways PowerPoint 2007 and 2010 are very similar. Videos are the one area in
which they differ greatly.
FIGURE 17-7
Run the Optimize Media Compatibility utility to improve backward compatibility.
474

Chapter 17: Incorporating Motion Video
To minimize the impact of such problems, there are two things you can do:
 Link all videos, rather than embedding them. Delete the embedded version and re-insert
them, choosing Link to File from the Insert button’s drop-down menu in the Insert Video
dialog box.
 Run the Optimize Media Compatibility utility. To do so, select File ➪Info ➪Optimize
Media Compatibility. See Figure 17-7. When the utilities has ﬁnished, click Close.
Some clip types may show Unsupported in the Status column of the Optimize Media
Compatibility dialog box. This means that that clip’s format may not be playable in an earlier
PowerPoint version; you might need to convert that clip to some other format using a third-party
video editor and then reinsert it into PowerPoint.
Other clip types may show Complete in the Status column. This means that the clip has been
modiﬁed for greater compatibility, and should work in an earlier PowerPoint version.
Caution
If you back-save a presentation ﬁle (that is, save it in PowerPoint 97–2003 format) that contains videos, any
videos that are in formats unsupported by that version will be saved as static graphics (of the ﬁrst frame of
the video). ■
Changing the Video’s Formatting
The formatting for a video clip refers to the size, shape, position, and effects of the frame in
which the video appears. It doesn’t have anything to do with the playback of the video itself.
The following sections explain how to affect the formatting of a video clip in various ways.
Choosing the Size of the Video Clip Window
You can resize a video clip’s window just like any other object. Simply drag its selection handles.
Be careful, however, that you do not distort the image by resizing in only one dimension. Make
sure you drag a corner selection handle, not one on a single side of the object. To set an exact
size, enter the dimensions in the Height and Width text boxes on the Format tab.
Also be aware that when you enlarge a video clip’s window, the quality of the clip suffers.
If you make the clip large and are unhappy with its quality, you can reset it to its original size
by following these steps:
1.
Right-click the clip and choose Size and Position.
2.
Click Reset.
3.
Click Close.
475

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Setting the Initial Image (Poster Frame)
The poster frame is the image that appears when the clip is not playing. By default it is the ﬁrst
frame of the video clip. However, if the ﬁrst frame of the video is a blank screen, you may want
to use something else instead.
You can choose an external image ﬁle for the poster frame, or you select a frame from the video
itself.
Choosing an External Poster Frame
To use an external still image as the poster frame, follow these steps:
1.
In Normal view, select the image.
2.
Choose Format ➪Poster Frame ➪Image from File. The Insert Picture dialog box appears.
3.
Select the picture you want to use.
4.
Click Insert.
Choosing a Video Frame as the Poster Frame
To use a frame from the video itself as the poster frame, do the following:
1.
In Normal view, select the video clip.
2.
Verify that playback controls appear below the clip in Normal view. (They do for most
ﬁle types, but not for Flash, animated GIFs, or linked ﬁles from Web sites.) If there are no
playback controls, you cannot proceed with these steps.
3.
Click the Play button (right-pointing triangle) on the controls below the clip.
4.
When the video displays the frame you want to use, click the Pause button (two vertical
bars) on the controls below the clip.
5.
Choose Video Tools Format ➪Poster Frame ➪Current Frame.
Resetting the Poster Frame
To return to the default poster frame (the ﬁrst frame of the video clip), select the clip and then
choose Format ➪Poster Frame ➪Reset.
Applying Corrections and Color Washes
You can apply brightness and contrast corrections to a video clip in the same way as you do
photographic images. This was covered in detail in Chapter 13, ‘‘Working with Photographic
Images.’’ Choose Video Tools Format ➪Corrections and then choose one of the sample images
that reﬂects the changes to be made. See Figure 17-8.
The same color washes that you learned about in Chapter 13 for photos also apply to most video
clips. Click the Color button and choose a color wash, or choose More Variations for more color
choices. Choosing a color from the Color button’s menu (see Figure 17-9) will set the video to
play as a monochrome (single-color) clip, using the color you chose.
476

FIGURE 17-8
Adjust the brightness and/or contrast of the clip if desired.
FIGURE 17-9
Choose a color wash or other color setting.
477

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Applying Video Styles and Effects
On the Video Tools Format tab, you’ll ﬁnd the same style and effect options as for photos.
Here’s a sampling of what you can do; refer to Chapter 13 for more details on each of these
options.
 Styles: Open the Styles palette and pick one of the presets there to apply a combination of
frame shape and image effects.
 Video Effects: Click this button for access to the same formatting options as for images:
Shadow, Reﬂection, Glow, Soft Edges, Bevel, and 3-D.
 Video Border: Click this button to choose a border color and thickness for the video clip’s
outer frame.
 Video Shape: Click this button and then choose one of the built-in shapes to alter the
shape of the video clip’s frame. You might choose to make it a rounded rectangle, for
example, or an oval.
 Crop: You can crop the window of the clip so that part of the clip does not appear
(uncommon).
 Send Backward: You can send the clip behind other objects on the slide. This makes it
possible to use overlapping lines, shapes, and textboxes to annotate the video clip window.
Note
The Reset Design button on the Format tab resets everything you have done to a clip’s formatting except
the setting of the poster frame. To reset the poster frame, choose Format ➪Poster Frame ➪Reset. ■
Compressing Media Clips
If disk space is an issue, you may want to compress the media clips in the presentation so that
the overall size of the PowerPoint ﬁle is decreased. This results in a loss of clip quality, so don’t
do it unless you have to.
Caution
Save a copy of your presentation with another name before you compress the media clips. That way if
the playback quality suffers too much, you can revert to the higher quality version. This also gives you the
high-quality version to play back locally. ■
To compress the media clips, choose File ➪Info ➪Compress Media. On the menu that appears,
choose a playback quality; Presentation Quality (high-quality, for playback on a local PC),
Internet Quality (medium, for sending via e-mail or playback on a Web page), or Low Quality
(for situations where available disk space is very limited and playback quality is not important).
See Figure 17-10.
478

Chapter 17: Incorporating Motion Video
When you issue the command, the Compress Media dialog box opens, and the compression
begins automatically. Wait for it to ﬁnish and then click Close.
FIGURE 17-10
Compress the media clips for a smaller ﬁle size.
Specifying Playback Options
Playback options are the options that control when and how the clip plays. Unlike the formatting
options you learned about in the previous sections, these controls affect the action of the clip, the
unique qualities it has as a motion video object rather than a static image.
Displaying or Hiding Playback Controls
By default, when a video clip plays in Slide Show view, playback controls appear below it. They
make it easy to start and stop the clip and to skip to a different section of it (by clicking on the
timeline below the clip).
You may sometimes want to hide those controls, however. To hide them, on the Slide Show
tab, clear the Show Media Controls check box. Note that this setting applies to the entire
presentation; you unfortunately cannot disable or enable playback controls separately for individ-
ual clips.
479

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Choosing a Start Trigger
There are a number of ways to specify when a clip starts playing. Let’s take a look at some of
these.
Making a Clip Play Automatically or On Click
A video clip’s default playback setting is On Click, meaning that it plays during Slide Show view
only when the clip itself is clicked. You can change this behavior, so that it plays automatically
when it appears, by changing the Start setting on the Video Tools Playback tab, as shown in
Figure 17-11. (You can also set this on the Animations tab.)
FIGURE 17-11
Set a clip to play back either automatically or on click.
Choose to play the
clip automatically or
on click
Note
If you set the clip to start automatically, you can optionally specify a number of seconds that should pass
before that occurs. On the Animations tab, enter a number of seconds in the Delay box to build in this
delay. You’ll learn more about delaying the start of an animation event in Chapter 18, ‘‘Creating Animation
Effects and Transitions.’’ ■
Playing the Clip on Mouseover
By default, an inserted clip is already set up to play on click, but not when the mouse pointer
passes over it. To play the clip only when the mouse pointer passes over it (mouseover) use the
Action command, like this:
1.
Select the clip in Normal view.
2.
Choose Insert ➪Action. The Action Settings dialog box opens.
3.
Click the Mouse Over tab.
4.
Select the Object Action button.
5.
Open the drop-down list and choose Play. See Figure 17-12.
480

Chapter 17: Incorporating Motion Video
FIGURE 17-12
Action settings on the Mouse Over tab control whether the
clip plays when the mouse passes over it.
6.
Click OK.
Triggering Play by Clicking Another Object
Triggers specify when the action should occur. They enable you to trigger an event as a result of
clicking the event object or something other than the event object. For example, you could put a
piece of clip art on the slide next to a video, and have the video playback begin when you click
the clip art.
Trigger animation is set automatically for the clip itself when you insert it, so that the clip starts
and pauses when you click it. To set up a trigger for an object other than the clip itself, follow
these steps:
1.
Place both the video and the trigger object (such as a button or a piece of clip art) on the
slide.
2.
Choose Animations ➪Animation Pane. The Animation pane appears. There may already
be an animation listed there which plays and pauses the video clip.
3.
Select the video clip and choose Add Animation ➪Play. A new animation event appears
at the top of the Animation pane.
4.
Right-click this new event and choose Timing. The Play Animation dialog box opens.
481

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
5.
Click the Triggers button.
6.
Click Start Effect On Click Of.
7.
Open the drop-down list and choose the object that will serve as the trigger. For example,
in Figure 17-13, the object is an oval that has the word Play in it.
FIGURE 17-13
Set up optional triggers that make the clip play when you click something other than the clip.
8.
Click OK.
9.
Test the trigger in Slide Show view.
Choosing Clip Playback Options
On the Video Tools Playback tab is a group of check boxes that govern various small details
about the clip playback. Mark or clear any of these as desired:
 Play Full Screen: Switches the clip to full-screen size when it is playing in Slide Show
View.
 Hide While Not Playing: Hides the still image (the poster frame) of the clip.
 Loop Until Stopped: Plays the clip over and over until you move to the next slide or stop
it using its playback controls.
 Rewind After Playing: When the clip ﬁnishes, normally the ﬁnal frame remains
on-screen; marking this check box makes the ﬁrst frame appear again instead.
482

Chapter 17: Incorporating Motion Video
Caution
If you are using an animated GIF, it plays the number of times speciﬁed in its header. That could be inﬁnite
looping (0), or it could be a speciﬁed number of times. You can’t set it to do otherwise. (You can, however,
delay its initial appearance with custom animation. See Chapter 18 for details.) Other videos, such as your
own recorded video clips, have more settings you can control. ■
Controlling the Volume
The clip can have a different Volume setting than the rest of the presentation’s audio. That way
you can compensate for a clip that is louder or quieter than the other audio in the presentation.
To do so, click the Volume button on the Video Tools Playback tab and then choose Low,
Medium, High, or Mute from the menu.
Trimming the Clip
New in PowerPoint 2010, you can trim footage off the beginning or end of a video clip from
within PowerPoint. This makes it possible for you to do some rudimentary editing without hav-
ing to use a separate video editing program.
Caution
Not all types of clips can be trimmed. If the Trim Video button is unavailable on the Playback tab, the clip
you have selected can only be trimmed using a third-party program. ■
To trim a clip, follow these steps:
1.
Select the clip on the slide.
2.
Choose Video Tools Playback ➪Trim Video. The Trim Video dialog box opens.
3.
To trim off the beginning of the clip, do the following:
a. Click the Play button (right-pointing triangle) and wait until the part of the clip plays
where you want to begin.
b. Click the Pause button (the two vertical lines). A thin vertical line on the timeline
shows where the clip has stopped.
If you didn’t pause it at exactly the right place, use the Next Frame or Previous Frame
buttons to move back or forward one frame per click until the marker is in the right
spot.
You can also drag the thin vertical line to the left or right on the timeline to move it
manually.
c. Drag the green marker on the left end of the timeline to the gray vertical line. See
Figure 17-14.

b. Click the Pause button (the two vertical lines). A gray vertical line on the timeline
shows where the clip has stopped.
c. Drag the red marker on the right end of the timeline to the gray vertical line.
5.
Click OK to accept the trimming.
Caution
Compressing the media in the presentation (File ➪Compress Media) deletes the trimmed parts from the
embedded copy of the clip. ■
484

Chapter 17: Incorporating Motion Video
Setting Fade In and Fade Out Durations
Some clips already begin and/or end with a ‘‘fade to black’’ effect. If one of your clips doesn’t,
and you want such an effect, you can apply it manually from within PowerPoint. (This is new in
PowerPoint 2010.)
Select the clip, and on the Video Tools Playback tab, enter values (in seconds) in the Fade In
and/or Fade Out boxes. Seconds are expressed as whole numbers, so 1.25 would be 1.25 sec-
onds. The larger the number you enter, the longer the effect will take and the more obvious it
will seem. See Figure 17-15.
FIGURE 17-15
Set a clip to fade in and/or fade out if desired.
Fade controls
Setting a Bookmark
You can set a bookmark (in other words, a marker) at any point within the video, and then jump
among those marked locations during a presentation. To jump ahead to the next bookmark in a
video clip, you can press Alt+End; to jump backward to the previous bookmark, use Alt+Home.
To set a video bookmark, follow these steps:
1.
Select the video clip on the slide.
2.
In Normal view, use the Play button (right-pointing triangle) below the video clip to begin
a preview of it.
3.
When the video playback gets to the point where you want the bookmark, choose
Playback ➪Add Bookmark.
The clip stops playing, and a bookmark is inserted at that spot. A bookmark symbol (tiny white
or gold circle) appears on the playback timeline under the clip. See Figure 17-16.
To remove a bookmark, click the bookmark symbol and then choose Playback ➪Remove
Bookmark.
You can then set up a trigger to a bookmark, so that something happens when the video play-
back reaches a certain point. For example, you could have some text appear over the top of the
485

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
video at a certain point, and then disappear and some other text come in at another point. (Use
Send Backward to move the video behind the text box as needed.)
FIGURE 17-16
Set bookmarks within a clip’s playback if desired.
Click here to add

Here’s how to set a trigger to a bookmark.
1.
Add the object to the slide that should appear at a certain point in the video playback. For
example, add a text box.
2.
Select the object that should appear, and add an entrance animation effect to it, as you
learned earlier in the chapter.
3.
With the object still selected, choose Animations ➪Trigger ➪On Bookmark and click the
desired bookmark.
The bookmarks are consecutively numbered, from left to right on the clip timeline.
If you want the object to exit at a certain point in the video, continue with these steps:
4.
(Optional) Set another bookmark at the point where the object should exit.
5.
Add an exit effect to the object.
486

Chapter 17: Incorporating Motion Video
6.
Choose Animations ➪Trigger ➪On Bookmark and choose the bookmark that represents
the position at which it should exit.
You can repeat that process for multiple objects, so that different text or graphics appear over the
top of the video at different points.
Troubleshooting Video Problems
Here are some work-arounds available for most of the common problems with PowerPoint
video clips.
Troubleshooting Videos That Won’t Play
For problems with videos that won’t play, explore one or more of these possible ﬁxes:
 Update your players. Make sure you have the latest versions of:
 Windows Media Player (should be version 10 or higher)
 Flash Player (should be version 9 or higher)
 QuickTime
 DirectX
 Play it in an external player: If your video won’t play in PowerPoint, but it will play
outside of PowerPoint using one of your media players you have installed, insert the clip as
an object with the Insert ➪Object command. That way it will play using an external player
during the presentation.
 Convert to WMV format: PowerPoint easily handles Windows Media Video (WMV) for-
mat clips. You can import a video clip into Windows Movie Maker (free with Windows
XP and Windows Vista, and available for free download if you have Windows 7) and then
export it to WMV format from there.
Tip
If you record video with your own video camera, and it won’t play in PowerPoint, it’s probably because
your camera uses a proprietary codec. Use the software that comes with the camera to re-render your
video using a more common codec. A utility called gspot, available at www.headbands.com/gspot, can
identify what codecs are being used in your video ﬁles. ■
Tip
This may seem hard to believe, but it works. If you get an error message when you try to drag and drop
an AVI video clip into your presentation or if you try to insert it and PowerPoint simply ignores you, try
renaming the ﬁle extension from .avi to .mpg. This often will ﬁx it. ■
487

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Troubleshooting Poor Playback Quality
Be aware that slower, older computers, especially those with a meager amount of RAM, may not
present your video clip to its best advantage. The sound may not match the video, the video may
be jerky, and a host of other little annoying performance glitches may occur. On such PCs, it is
best to limit the live-action video that you use and rely more on animated GIFs, simple WMV
animations, and other less system-taxing video clips.
When you are constructing a presentation, keep in mind that you may be showing it on a lesser
computer than the one on which you are creating it, and therefore performance problems may
crop up during the presentation that you did not anticipate. Here are some ideas for at least par-
tially remediating the situation:
 Make sure you test the presentation on the actual computer on which you are going to
show it, especially if you need a nonstandard codec.
 Copy the entire presentation and all of its support ﬁles to the fastest hard disk on the sys-
tem instead of running it from a CD. Hard disks have much faster access time. Use File ➪
Save & Send ➪Package Presentation for CD to collect the needed ﬁles instead of manually
copying them through Windows, to ensure that you get all of the ﬁles and properly resolve
their links.
 Run the entire presentation on the playback PC from start to ﬁnish beforehand. If there are
delays, jerks, and lack of synchronization, just let it play itself out. Then try the whole pre-
sentation again, and it will usually be much better the second time. This happens because
the system caches some of the data, and it’s faster to read it from the cache than from
the disk.
 Make sure the playback PC is in the best shape it can be in. If feasible, upgrade its RAM.
Run Disk Defragmenter and Disk Cleanup on it, and make sure its video driver is up
to date.
 Work with the original media clips to decrease their complexity, and then re-import them
into PowerPoint. For example, use video-editing software to lower the frames per second of
video clips, and use image-editing software to lower the dots per inch of any large graphics.
 If possible, spread out the more complex slides in the presentation so that they are not
adjacent to one another. Have an intervening slide that is just simple text.
 If all else fails, convert the presentation into a video, or transfer the presentation to video-
tape from the original PC (where presumably it plays correctly).
Summary
In this chapter, you learned how to place video clips on your slides and how to set them up to
play when you want them to. You learned about the differences between various video formats,
and how to set up clips to play when you display the slide and/or when you click them. You
488

Chapter 17: Incorporating Motion Video
learned how to set a clip’s volume and appearance, and how to make it play at different starting
points and stop at different ending points.
In the next chapter, you’ll learn about transitions and object animation. With a transition, you
can create special effects for the movement from one slide to another. With object animation,
you can control the entry and exit of individual objects on a slide. You can make them ﬂy in
with special effects or build them dramatically one paragraph, bar, or shape at a time.

Creating Animation
Effects and Transitions
IN THIS CHAPTER
Assigning transitions to slides
Animating Slide Content
Layering animated objects
S
o far in this book, you have learned about several types of moving
objects on a slide. One object type is a movie, or video clip, that has
been created in an animation program or recorded with a video cam-
era. Another type is an animated GIF, which is essentially a graphic that has
some special properties that enable it to play a short animation sequence
over and over.
However, neither of these types is what PowerPoint means by animation. In
PowerPoint, animation is the way that individual objects enter or exit a slide.
On a slide with no animation, all of the objects on the slide simply appear
at the same time when you display it. (Boring, eh?) However, you can apply
animation to the slide so that the bullet points ﬂy in from the left, one at a
time, and the graphic drops down from the top afterward.
A transition is another kind of animation. A transition refers to the entry or
exit of the entire slide, rather than of an individual object on the slide.
Here are some ideas for using animation effectively in your presentations:
 Animate parts of a chart so that the data appears one series at a time.
This technique works well if you want to talk about each series
separately.
 Set up questions and answers on a slide so that the question appears
ﬁrst, and then, when you click the question, the answer appears.
 Dim each bullet point when the next one comes into view, so that you
are, in effect, highlighting the current one.
 Make an object appear and then disappear. For example, you might
have an image of a lightning bolt that ﬂashes on the slide for one
second and then disappears, or a picture of a racecar that drives onto
the slide from the left and then immediately drives out of sight to
the right.
491

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
 Rearrange the order in which objects appear on the slide. For example, you could make
numbered points appear from the bottom up for a Top Ten list.
Assigning Transitions to Slides
Transitions determine how you get from slide A to slide B. Back in the old slide projector days,
there was only one transition: the old slide was pushed out, and the new slide dropped into
place. However, with a computerized presentation, you can choose from all kinds of fun transi-
tions, including wipes, blinds, ﬂy-ins, and much more. These transitions are almost exactly like
the animations, except that they apply to the whole slide (or at least the background — the base
part of the slide — if the slide’s objects are separately animated).
Note
The transition effect for a slide refers to how the slide enters, and not how it exits. As a result, if you want
to assign a particular transition while moving from slide 1 to slide 2, you would assign the transition effect
to slide 2. ■
The individual transitions are hard to describe in words; it is best if you just view them onscreen
to understand what each one does. You should try out several transitions before making your
ﬁnal selection.
Setting Transition Effects and Timings
The default transition effect is None. One slide replaces another with no special effect. If you
want something ﬂashier than that, you must choose it from the Transitions tab.
As you are setting up the transition effect, you have a choice of allowing it to occur manually
(that is, On Click) or automatically. Generally speaking, if there is a live person controlling and
presenting the show, transitions should be manual. With manual transitions, the presenter must
click the mouse to move to the next slide, just like clicking the advance button on a 35mm slide
projector. This might sound distracting, but it helps the speaker to maintain control of the show.
If someone in the audience asks a question or wants to make a comment, the show does not
continue on blindly, but pauses to accommodate the delay.
However, if you are preparing a self-running presentation, such as for a kiosk, automatic transi-
tions are a virtual necessity. In the following section you will learn how to set the timing between
slides. Timings also are in effect when you record narration, as described in Chapter 21.
To assign a transition effect and control its timing, follow these steps:
1.
View or select the slide in Normal or Slide Sorter view. If you use Slide Sorter view, you
can more easily select multiple slides to which you can apply the transition.
492

Chapter 18: Creating Animation Effects and Transitions
2.
(Optional) On the Transitions tab, in the Transition to This Slide group, click the
transition you want to use. Open the gallery to see additional transitions if needed. See
Figure 18-1. The effect is previewed on the slide.
If you do not want a transition effect, do not choose a transition; instead leave the default
transition (None) selected.
FIGURE 18-1

Click here for more
transitions
3.
Click Effect Options and select any options for the chosen effect transition as desired. The
effects listed will be different depending on the transition you chose.
4.
In the Timing group, mark or clear the check boxes for:
 On Mouse Click: Transitions when you click the mouse.
 Automatically: Transitions after a speciﬁed amount of time has passed. (Enter the
time, in seconds, in the associated text box.)
Note
It is perfectly okay to leave the On Mouse Click check box selected, even if you choose automatic
transitions — in fact, this is a good idea. There may be times when you want to manually advance to the next
slide before the automatic transition time has elapsed, and leaving this option selected allows you to do so. ■
Caution
You will probably want to assign automatic transitions to either all or none of the slides in the presentation, but
not a mixture of the two. This is because mixed transition times can cause confusion, when some of the slides
automatically advance and others do not. However, there may be situations where you need to assign different
timings and effects to the various slides’ transitions. ■
5.
(Optional) Adjust the Duration setting to specify how quickly the transition effect will
occur.
This is not the timing between slides, but rather the timing from the beginning to the end
of the transition effect itself. For example, for a Fade transition, it determines how fast the
fade occurs.
493

6.
(Optional) If you want a sound associated with the transition, select it from the Sound
drop-down list. See the next section for details.
7.
(Optional) If you want these same transition settings to apply to all slides in the presenta-
tion, click Apply to All.
Any automatically advancing transitions that you have set appear with the timings beneath each
slide in Slide Sorter view, as shown in Figure 18-2.

More about Transition Sounds
Transition sounds have different controls than the sounds described in Chapter 16. In the Tran-
sition Sound menu, shown in Figure 18-3, you can choose from among PowerPoint’s default
sound collection, or you can choose any of the following:
 No Sound: Does not assign a sound to the transition.
 Stop Previous Sound: Stops any sound that is already playing. This usually applies where
the previous sound was very long and was not ﬁnished when you moved on to the next
slide, or in cases where you used the Loop Until Next Sound transition (see below).
494

Chapter 18: Creating Animation Effects and Transitions
FIGURE 18-3
Select a transition sound.
 Other Sound: Opens a dialog box from which you can select another WAV sound ﬁle
stored on your system.
 Loop Until Next Sound: An on/off toggle that sets whatever sound you select to loop
continuously either until another sound is triggered or until a slide appears that has Stop
Previous Sound set for its transition.
Caution
Sounds associated with transitions can get annoying to your audience very quickly. Don’t use them
gratuitously. ■
Rehearsing and Recording Transition Timings
The trouble with setting the same automatic timings for all slides is that not all slides deserve or
need equal time onscreen. For example, some slides may have more text than others, or more
complex concepts to grasp. To allow for the differences, you can manually set the timings for
each slide, as described in the preceding section. However, another way is to use the Rehearse
Timings feature to run through your presentation in real time, and then to allow PowerPoint to
set the timings for you, based on that rehearsal.
495

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Note
When you set timings with the Rehearse Timings feature, PowerPoint ignores any hidden slides. If you later
unhide these slides, they are set to advance automatically. You need to individually assign them an Auto-
matically After transition time, as described earlier in the chapter. ■
To set transition timings with the Rehearse Timings feature, follow these steps:
1.
On the Slide Show tab, click Rehearse Timings. The slide show starts with the Recording
toolbar in the upper-left corner, as shown in Figure 18-4.
FIGURE 18-4
Use the Recording toolbar to set timings for automatic transitions.
Next
Pause
Current slide timing
Repeat

Note
If you want to record voiceover narration as you rehearse and record the timings, click Record Slide Show
in step 1 instead of Rehearse Timings. (Have your microphone ready to go before you do that.) Chapter 21
explains narration recording in more detail. ■
2.
Click through the presentation, displaying each slide for as long as you want it to appear
in the actual show. To move to the next slide, you can click the slide, click the Next but-
ton in the Recording toolbar (right-pointing arrow), or press Page Down.
When setting timings, it may help to read the text on the slide, slowly and out loud, to
simulate how an audience member who reads slowly would proceed. When you have
read all of the text on the slide, pause for one or two more seconds and then advance. If
you need to pause the rehearsal at any time, click the Pause button. When you are ready
to resume, click the Pause button again.
If you make a mistake on the timing for a slide, click the Repeat button to begin timing
this slide again from 00:00.
Tip
If you want a slide to display for a fairly long time, such as 30 seconds or more, you might ﬁnd it faster to enter
the desired time in the Current Slide Timing text box on the Recording toolbar, rather than waiting the full
amount of time before advancing. To do this, click in the text box, type the desired time, and press Tab. You
must press the Tab key after entering the time — do not click the Next button — or PowerPoint will not apply
your change. ■
496

Chapter 18: Creating Animation Effects and Transitions
3.
When you reach the ﬁnal slide, a dialog box appears, asking whether you want to keep
the new slide timings. Click Yes.
Tip
If you want to temporarily discard the rehearsed timings, deselect the Use Timings check box on the Slide
Show tab. This turns off all automatic timings and allows the show to advance through mouse-clicks only.
To clear timings altogether, choose Slide Show ➪Record Slide Show ➪Clear ➪Clear Timings on All
Slides. ■
Animating Slide Content
Whereas transitions determine how a slide (as a whole) enters the screen, animations determine
what happens to the slide’s content after that point. You might animate a bulleted list by having
each bullet point fade in one-by-one, for example, or you might make a picture gradually grow
or shrink to emphasize it. The effects you can create are limited only by your imagination.
Animation gives you full control over how the objects on your slides appear, move, and dis-
appear. You can not only choose from the full range of animation effects for each object, but
you can also specify in what order the objects appear and what sound is associated with their
appearance.
Animation: A First Look
The Animations tab provides many settings and shortcuts for creating animation events. An event
is an animation occurrence, such as an object entering or exiting the slide. An event can also
consist of an object on the slide moving around in some way (spinning, growing, changing color,
and so on).
Each animation event appears as a separate entry in the Animation pane. You can display or hide
the Animation pane by choosing Animations ➪Animation Pane at any time.
When you animate bulleted lists and certain other types of text groupings, the associated events
may be collapsed or expanded in the Animation pane. For example, in Figure 18-5, an animated
bulleted list’s events are collapsed.
Notice the following in Figure 18-5:
 The event has a mouse icon to its left. That indicates that the animation is set to occur On
Click.
 It has a green star on it. Green means entrance; this is an entrance effect. (Yellow means
emphasis, and red means exit effect.) A line instead of a star means it is a motion path
(covered later in this chapter).
 It has a double down-pointing arrow below it. That indicates that there are collapsed ani-
mation events beneath it.

Tip
To assign meaningful names to slide objects so it’s easier to tell what you are working with when animating,
choose Home ➪Select ➪Selection Pane. Then in that pane, you can edit each object’s name. ■
In Figure 18-6, the events are expanded. To expand or collapse a group of events, click the dou-
ble up-pointing or down-pointing arrow. Notice the following in Figure 18-6:
 Each event has a mouse icon to its left. That indicates that each one requires a separate
mouse click to activate.
 Each bulleted list item on the slide has a number next to it that corresponds to one of the
numbered animation events in the Animation pane.

Chapter 18: Creating Animation Effects and Transitions
Choosing an Animation Effect
There are four categories of custom animation effects. Each effect has a speciﬁc purpose, as well
as a different icon color:
 Entrance (green): The item’s appearance on the slide is animated. Either it does not
appear right away when the rest of the slide appears, or it appears in some unusual way
(such as ﬂying or fading), or both.
 Emphasis (yellow): The item is already on the slide, and is modiﬁed in some way. For
example, it may shrink, grow, wiggle, or change color.
 Exit (red): The item disappears from the slide before the slide itself disappears, and you
can specify that it does so in some unusual way.
 Motion Paths (gray): The item moves on the slide according to a preset path. Motion
paths are discussed later in the chapter.
Within each of these broad categories are a multitude of animations. Although the appearance of
the icons may vary, the colors (on the menus from which you choose them, and on the effects
listed in the Animation pane) always match the category.
Different effect categories have different choices. For example, the Emphasis category, in addition
to providing movement-based effects, also has effects that change the color, background, or other
attributes of the object.
You can choose animation effects in any of these ways (all from the Animations tab) after select-
ing the object to be animated:
 Click one of the animation samples in the Animations group.
 Click the Add Animation button, and choose an effect from the menu that appears.
 Click the down arrow to open the gallery in the Animations group, and choose an effect
from the gallery that appears. (This menu is identical to the one provided by the Add Ani-
mation button.) See Figure 18-7.
 Click the Add Animation button and then choose one of the ‘‘More’’ commands at the bot-
tom, depending on the type of animation you want. For example, you might want More
Entrance Effects. This opens a dialog box with a full listing of the effects of that type as
shown in Figure 18-8.
Note
Use the Animation Gallery to change an existing animation, or to apply animation to an object that is not
already animated. Add Animation can be used to add more animation to an object that is already animated,
as well as to animate objects that are not already animated. ■
499

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
FIGURE 18-7
Choose an animation effect to apply.
Changing an Effect’s Direction
After applying an animation, you can control its options with the Animations ➪Effect Options
menu. The options that appear there depend on the effect you have chosen. Some effects have a
direction for entrance or exit, for example.
Setting Animation Timing
The timing controls for animations are located in the Timing group on the Animations tab, as
shown in Figure 18-9.
500

Chapter 18: Creating Animation Effects and Transitions
FIGURE 18-8
The More command opens a dialog box of effects for the chosen type.
FIGURE 18-9
Control the timing of an animation from the Timing group.
By default, animations are set to occur On Click. You can instead set them to occur automatically
by choosing one of these settings from the Start drop-down list on the Animations tab:
 With Previous: The animation occurs simultaneously with the start of the previous event
in the Animation pane. If there is no previous event, the animation occurs simultaneously
with the appearance of the slide itself.
 After Previous: The animation occurs after the previous animation event has ﬁnished
occurring. If there is no previous event, the animation occurs after the appearance of the
slide itself.
501

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
The difference between those two settings is subtle, because most animation events are very short
in duration. However, if an event is set to After Previous and the previous event takes a long
time to execute, the difference may be more noticeable.
You can also set a Delay for the animation (Animations ➪Delay). This delays the animation’s
start for a speciﬁed number of seconds after the previous event.
The Duration setting (Animations ➪Duration) controls the speed at which the animation occurs.
The higher the duration setting, the slower it will execute.
Copying Animation
The Animation Painter is a very handy new feature in PowerPoint 2010 that enables you to copy
an animation effect from one object to another. To use it, follow these steps:
1.
Select the object that is already animated the way you want.
2.
Choose Animations ➪Animation Painter.
3.
Click the object to receive the copied animation. (You can navigate to a different slide
before doing this.)
Special Options for Text Animation
When you are animating the text in a text box, some extra options become available.
For starters, you can choose the grouping that you want to animate. For example, suppose
that you have three levels of bullets in the text box, and you want them to be animated
with each second-level bullet appearing separately. You can specify the second level as the
animation grouping, so that all third-level bullets appear as a group, along with their associated
second-level bullet.
Changing the Grouping Level
The grouping level is the detail level at which separate animations occur. For example, if the ani-
mation is grouped by paragraph, each paragraph (that is, each bullet point) is a separate event.
You can change the grouping level by choosing Animations ➪Effect Options and then choosing
one of these options;
 As One Object: Makes the entire content placeholder a single animation event.
 All At Once: Makes each paragraph a separate event, but assigns On Click to only the ﬁrst
one; the others are set to animate With Previous, which means they occur simultaneously
with the ﬁrst one.
 By Paragraph: Animates each paragraph separately and assigns On Click to each event.
This is the default.
502

Chapter 18: Creating Animation Effects and Transitions
If you have more than one level of bullets, the subordinate-level bullet points are animated along
with their ﬁrst-level parent when you use Animations ➪Effect Options ➪By Paragraph.
If you want bullets that are other than ﬁrst-level to be separately animated, you must set that up
in the Effect Options dialog box. Follow these steps:
1.
In the Animation pane, collapse the group (by clicking the double up arrow). Then
right-click the collapsed group and choose Effect Options.
2.
In the Effect Options dialog box, click the Text Animation tab.
3.
Open the Group Text drop-down list and choose the level at which you want to group
bullet points. For example, in Figure 18-10, I am grouping by 2nd Level Paragraphs.
4.
Click OK to accept the new grouping setting.
FIGURE 18-10
Group by a certain level of paragraphs (bullets).
Tip
To animate the list in reverse order (that is, from the bottom up), mark the In Reverse Order check box (see
Figure 18-10). ■
Animating Each Individual Word or Letter
By default, when a paragraph animates, it does so all at once. You can optionally instead set it
to animate one word at a time, or even one letter at a time. (Be careful with this, though; it gets
annoying quickly!)
To set this up, do the following:
1.
Right-click the animation event in the Animation pane and choose Effect Options. The
Effect Options dialog box opens.
503

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
2.
On the Effect tab, open the Animate Text drop-down list and choose a setting:
 All at once
 By word
 By letter
3.
Click OK.
Removing an Animation Effect
You can remove the animation for a speciﬁc object, or remove all of the animation for the entire
slide. When an object is not animated, it simply appears when the slide appears, with no delay.
For example, if the title is not animated, the slide background and the title appear ﬁrst, after
which any animation executes for the remaining objects. To remove animation from a speciﬁc
object, do the following:
1.
Display the Animation pane (Animations ➪Animation Pane).
2.
If the object is part of a group, such as a bulleted list, then expand or collapse the list,
depending on the effect that you want to remove. For example, to remove an animation
effect from an entire text box, you must ﬁrst collapse the list. To remove an animation
effect from only a single paragraph, such as a bulleted item, you must ﬁrst expand the list.
3.
Select the animation effect from the pane, and then press the Delete key on the keyboard,
or right-click and choose Remove, or choose None from the Animation Gallery. Power-
Point removes the animation and then renumbers any remaining animation effects.
Assigning Multiple Animation Effects to a Single Object
Some objects might need more than one animation effect. For example, you may want an object
to have an Entrance and an Exit effect, or you may want a bulleted list to enter one way and
then emphasize each point in a different way.
To assign a new animation effect to an object that is already animated, just select it and apply
another animation event to it with Animations ➪Add Animation. You don’t have to do anything
special to it just because it already has an animation event. (You can’t use the Animation Gallery
to add an animation to an object that already has an animation because it will just change the
existing event, not create a new event.)
After assigning another event to it, you may want to rearrange the order of the events; see the
section ‘‘Reordering Animation Effects’’ later in this chapter for details.
Note
Keep in mind that the numbers that appear next to the objects on the slides when the Animations tab is
displayed do not refer to the objects themselves — they refer to the animation events. If an object does not
have any animation assigned to it, then it does not have a number. Conversely, if an object has more than
one animation effect assigned to it, then it has two or more numbers. ■
504

Chapter 18: Creating Animation Effects and Transitions
Reordering Animation Effects
By default, animation effects are numbered in the order that you created them. To change this
order, do the following:
1.
On the Animation pane, click the effect whose position you want to change.
2.
Click the Re-Order up- or down-arrow buttons at the bottom of the pane, or the Move
Earlier or Move Later buttons on the Animations tab, to move the position of the anima-
tion in the list. See Figure 18-11.
FIGURE 18-11
Reorder animation effects from the task pane or the Animations tab.

You can also drag-and-drop items in the animations list to rearrange them. Position the mouse
pointer over an object, so that the pointer turns into a double-headed up or down arrow, and
then drag the object up or down in the list.
Setting Animation Event Triggers
Animation event triggers tell PowerPoint when to execute an animation. By default, an animation
occurs as part of the normal animation sequence, using whatever settings you have assigned to
it, such as On Click, With Previous, or After Previous.
When you set an animation to On Click, the click being referred to is any click. The mouse does
not need to be pointing at anything in particular. In fact, pressing a key on the keyboard can
serve the same purpose.
505

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
If you want an animation effect to occur only when you click something in particular, you can
use a trigger to specify this condition. For example, you may have three bullet points on a list,
and three photos. If you want each bullet point to appear when you click its corresponding
photo, you can animate each bullet point with the graphic object as its trigger.
Caution
There is a small complication in the preceding example: You can have only one trigger for each object,
and in this case, object means the entire text placeholder. Therefore, if you want to animate bullet points
separately with separate triggers, then you need to place each of them in a separate text box. ■
To set up a trigger, do the following:
1.
On the Animation pane, click the effect whose timing you want to set.
2.
Choose Animations ➪Trigger ➪On Click Of and then click the object that should be
used as the trigger for that event. See Figure 18-12.
FIGURE 18-12
Choose a trigger object for the selected animation event.
Here’s an alternative method:
1.
On the Animation pane, right-click the effect whose timing you want to set and choose
Timing. The Timing tab appears.
2.
Click the Triggers button. The controls for setting up a trigger appear on the Timing tab,
as shown in Figure 18-13.
3.
Select the Start Effect on Click Of option, and then open the drop-down list and select an
object. All of the objects on the slide appear in this list.
4.
Click OK.
Caution
Do not trigger the entrance of an object on Click Of itself, or there will be no way to make it appear. ■
506

Chapter 18: Creating Animation Effects and Transitions
FIGURE 18-13
You can also set up a trigger via the Timing tab.
Associating Sounds with Animations
You learned about sounds in Chapter 16, including how to associate a sound with an object.
However, associating a sound with an animation effect is different because the sound plays when
the animation occurs, not necessarily when the object appears or is clicked. By default, animation
effects do not have sounds assigned, but you can assign a sound by doing the following:
1.
In the Animation pane, select the animation effect to which you want to assign a sound.
Then open the drop-down list for the effect, and choose Effect Options.
2.
On the Effect tab (see Figure 18-14), open the Sound drop-down list and choose a sound.
You can choose any of the sounds in the list, or you can choose Other Sound to select a
sound ﬁle from another location. (Only WAV ﬁles can be used for this.)
OR
To make a previously playing sound stop when this animation occurs, choose Stop Previ-
ous Sound from the Sound drop-down list.
FIGURE 18-14
Choose a sound to be associated with the animation.

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Making an Object Appear Differently after Animation
After an object has been animated, you might want to have it appear differently on the slide. For
example, after some text animates, you might want it to be dimmed. To set this up, follow these
steps:
1.
In the Animation pane, select the animation effect. Then open the drop-down list for the
effect, and choose Effect Options.
2.
Open the After Animation drop-down list and choose one of the following options, as
shown in Figure 18-15:
 A scheme color: You can choose one of the colored squares, which represent each of
the current scheme colors.
 More Colors: Click here to choose a speciﬁc color, just as you would for any object.
For example, you can set text to gray to make it appear dimmed.
 Don’t Dim: This is the default setting; it speciﬁes that PowerPoint should do nothing
to the object after animation.
 Hide After Animation: This setting makes the object disappear immediately after the
animation ﬁnishes.
 Hide on Next Mouse Click: This setting makes the object disappear when you click
the mouse after the animation has completed. For example, this is useful for showing
and then hiding individual bullet points.
3.
Click OK.
FIGURE 18-15
You can choose a color for the object after animation, or specify that it should be hidden afterward.
508

Chapter 18: Creating Animation Effects and Transitions
Working with Motion Paths
Motion paths enable you to make an object ﬂy onto or off of the slide, and also make it ﬂy
around on the slide in a particular motion path! For example, suppose you are showing a map
on a slide, and you want to graphically illustrate the route that you took when traveling in that
country. You could create a little square, circle, or other AutoShape to represent yourself, and
then set up a custom motion path for the shape that traces your route on the map.
Using a Preset Motion Path
PowerPoint comes with dozens of motion paths, in every shape that you can imagine. To choose
one of them for an object, follow these steps:
1.
On the slide, click the object that you want to animate, and then choose Animations ➪
Add Animation and then either scroll down to the bottom and click one of the paths on
the list, or choose More Motion Paths.
You can also choose one of the animations in the Animations gallery, and then click Effect
Options on the Ribbon to choose a path.
2.
If you choose More Motion Paths, the Add Motion Path dialog box appears, as shown in
Figure 18-16. Click the path that you want.
If you select the Preview Effect check box, the effect previews on the slide behind the dia-
log box; you can drag the dialog box to the side to see the preview more clearly.
FIGURE 18-16
You can select a motion path.
509

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
3.
Click OK. The motion path appears on the slide, adjacent to the object. A green arrow
shows where the object will begin, and a dotted line shows the path that it will take, as
shown in Figure 18-17. A red arrow shows where the path ends. If it’s a closed path you
will only see the green arrow.
FIGURE 18-17
The motion path appears on the slide.
End point
Start point
Motion path
At this point, you have a wide variety of options you can change:
 To change the starting point for the motion path, drag the green arrow.
 To change the ending point, drag the red arrow.
 You can change any of the settings for the motion path, just as you would for any other
custom animation:
 Change the Duration setting. The default is 2 seconds.
 Change the Start setting. The default is On Click.
 Change the path’s timing or effects.
4.
Choose Animations ➪Effect Options and select any of the following options:
 Unlocked/Locked: If the path is unlocked and you move the animated object on the
slide, the path repositions itself with the object; if the path is locked, then it stays in
the same place, even when you move the object on the slide. You can toggle these two
options.
510

Chapter 18: Creating Animation Effects and Transitions
 Edit Points: This option enables you to change the motion path, and is discussed in
the next section, Editing a Motion Path.
 Reverse Path Direction: This option does just what it says: It makes the animation
run in the opposite direction.
If the Effect Options button on the Animations tab is not available, make sure the motion path is
selected (not the animated object).
There are even more effect options available. To see them, right-click the animation in the
Animation Pane and choose Effect Options to open a dialog box for the effect. On the Effect tab,
do any of the following:
 Set the Path to Locked or Unlocked. (This is the same as described in step 7.)
 Assign a number of seconds to Smooth Start, Smooth End, and/or Bounce End to ﬁne-tune
how the animation begins and ends. (This is a new setting, and is only available from this
dialog box.)
 Mark the Auto-Reverse check box to make the animation reverse itself after executing, so
the shape ends up back where it started. (This is not the same thing as Reverse Path Direc-
tion in step 7. Reverse Path Direction makes the path run backwards; Auto-Reverse makes
it run forwards and then backwards.)
 Associate a sound with the animation.
Editing a Motion Path
You can move the motion path by dragging it, or by nudging it with the arrow keys, as you
would any object.
You can resize or reshape the motion path by dragging its selection handles (the circles around
its frame); this is just like resizing any other object. To rotate the motion path, drag the green
circle at the top of the path; this is just like rotating any other object.
You can also modify the motion path manually by editing its points. A motion path consists of
anchor points with straight lines or curves between them. These points are normally invisible,
but you can also display them and change them.
To edit a motion path, follow these steps:
1.
Select the motion path on the slide (not the object itself).
2.
Choose Animations ➪Effect Options ➪Edit Points. (You can also right-click the path and
choose Edit Points.) Small black squares appear around the path.
3.
Click one of the black squares; a slightly larger white square appears near it. A line with
white squares on either end of the segment is a curve. These white squares are handles
that you can drag to modify the point. You can also drag the black square itself; either
way will work, although each method affects the path differently. For example, dragging
the black square moves the point itself, whereas dragging the handle repositions the curve
and leaves the point in place.
4.
Drag a square to change the path, as in Figure 18-18.
5.
When you are ﬁnished editing the path, choose Animations ➪Effect Options ➪Edit
Points again, or press Esc, or click away from the path, to turn the editing feature off.
511

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
FIGURE 18-18
You can edit a motion path by dragging the black or white squares that represent its anchor points.
Drawing a Custom Motion Path
If none of the motion paths suit your needs, or if you cannot easily edit them to the way you
want, you can create your own motion path. A motion path can be a straight line, a curve, a
closed loop, or a freeform scribble.
To draw a custom motion path for an object, follow these steps:
1.
Select the object that you want to move on the slide.
2.
Choose Animations ➪Add Animation and then click Custom Path from the bottom of the
menu.
3.
Drag to draw the path on the slide. Here are some hints:
 For a Line, click at the start point and then click again at the end point. The start point
will have a green arrow, and the end point will have a red one.
 For a Curve, click at the beginning of the line, and then move the mouse a little and
click again to anchor the next point. Keep creating points like this until you have com-
pletely deﬁned the curve. Don’t draw the entire curve before you click — you need to
create interim anchor points along the way. Double-click when you are ﬁnished.
 For a Freeform path, click for each anchor point that you want; straight lines will
appear between the anchor points. You can also click and drag to create non-straight
lines too. Double-click when you are ﬁnished.
 For a Scribble, the pointer changes to a pencil. Draw on the slide with the mouse
button held down. Double-click when you are ﬁnished.
4.
After drawing the path, edit and ﬁne-tune it as you would any other motion path.
Animating Parts of a Chart
If you create a chart using PowerPoint’s charting tool, then you can display the chart all at once
or apply a custom animation effect to it. For example, you can make the chart appear by series
(divided by legend entries), by category (divided by X-axis points), or by individual element in a
series or category. Figures 18-19 and 18-20 show progressions based on series and category.
512

Chapter 18: Creating Animation Effects and Transitions
FIGURE 18-19
In this progression, the chart is appearing by series.
513

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
FIGURE 18-20
Here, the chart is appearing by category.
Along with making various parts of the chart appear at different times, you can also make them
appear using any of the animated techniques that you have already learned, such as ﬂying in,
dropping in, fading in, and so on. You can also associate sounds with the parts, and dim them
or change them to various colors when the animation is ﬁnished.
To animate a chart, you must ﬁrst set up the entire chart to be animated, just as you would any
other object on a slide.
Then, to set up the chart so that different parts of it are animated separately, do the following:
1.
Choose Animations ➪Effect Options and then choose any of the following options from
the Sequence section of the menu (see Figure 18-21):
 As One Object: The entire chart is animated as a single object.
 By Series: In a multi-series chart, all of series 1 enters at once (all the bars of one
color), then all of series 2 enters at once, and so on.
 By Category: All the bars for the ﬁrst category appear at once (an entire grouping of
multi-colored bars), then the second category’s bars, and so on.
514

Chapter 18: Creating Animation Effects and Transitions
 By Element in Series: Each data point is animated separately, in this order: each point
(from bottom to top, or left to right) in series 1, then each point in series 2, and so on.
 By Element in Category: Each data point is animated separately, in this order: each
point (from bottom to top, or left to right) in category 1, then each point in category 2,
and so on.
FIGURE 18-21
You can animate the chart by series, by category, or by individual data points.
Tip
You can also set up chart animation from the Effect Options dialog box. Collapse the chart’s animation in
the Animation pane (if needed), and then right-click it and choose Effect Options. In the dialog box that
appears, click the Chart Animation tab, and make your selection there. The choices are exactly the same as
on the menu (Figure 18-21), plus there is one additional check box: Start Animation by Drawing the Chart
Background, which is on by default. It animates the grid and legend. If you deselect this option, these items
appear immediately on the slide, and the data bars, slices, or other chart elements appear separately from
them. ■
515

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Tip
You do not have to use the same animation effect for each category or each series of the chart. After you
set up the chart to animate each piece individually, individual entries appear for each piece on the list in
the Animation pane. You can expand this list and then apply individual settings to each piece. For example,
you could have some data bars on a chart ﬂy in from one direction, and other data bars ﬂy in from another
direction. You can also reorder the pieces so that the data points build in a different order from the default
order.
Not all animation effects are available for every type of chart and every series or category animation. If a
particular animation is not working, try a simpler one, such as Fade or Wipe. ■
Controlling Animation Timing
with the Advanced Timeline
The animation timeline is a graphical representation of how animated content will appear on the
slide. The timeline is also covered in Chapter 16, in the discussion about sounds and sound-
tracks. It is on by default in PowerPoint 2010. If you don’t see it, right-click any animation event
in the Animation Pane and choose Show Advanced Timeline.
The timeline is useful because it can tell you the total time involved in all of the animations that
you have set up, including any delays that you have built in. Figure 18-22 shows a timeline for
a chart that is animated by category, in which each event is set to occur After Previous.
For events that are set to On Click, the Advanced Timeline shows them to be occurring simul-
taneously, but this is not really true; they are just not time-sequenced with one another in the
same way that events set to With Previous or After Previous are.
Notice also in Figure 18-22 that the Seconds button at the bottom opens a menu from which
you can Zoom In and Zoom Out on the timeline.
You can also use the timeline to create delays between animations and to increase the duration
of individual animations. To increase the duration of an item, you can drag the right side of
the bar representing its length in the Animation pane. Drag the left side of the bar to create a
delay between animations. When you drag the bar for an item that is set to After Previous, the
other bars also move. However, when you drag the bar for an item that is set to With Previous,
PowerPoint allows an overlap.
Animation Tips
Here are some tips for using animation in your own work:
 Try to use the same animation effect for each slide in a related series of slides. If you want
to differentiate one section of the presentation from another, use a different animation
effect for the text in each different section.
 If you want to discuss only one bullet point at a time on a slide, set the others to dim or
change to a lighter color after animation.
516

Chapter 18: Creating Animation Effects and Transitions
FIGURE 18-22
The advanced timeline shows how much time is allotted to each animated element on the slide.
 If you want to obscure an element but you cannot make the animation settings do it the
way you want, consider using a shape that is set to the same color ﬁll as your background
color and that has no outside border. This shape will appear ‘‘invisible’’ but will obscure
whatever is behind it.
 Animate a chart based on the way you want to lead your audience through the data. For
example, if each series on your chart shows the sales for a different division and you want
to compare one division to another, you can animate by series. If you want to talk about
the results of that chart over time rather than by division, you can animate by category
instead.
 If you want to create your own moving graphic but you do not have access to a program
that creates animated GIFs, you can build a very simple animation on a slide. Simply create
the frames of the animation — three or more drawings that you want to progress through
in quick succession. Then, lay them one on top of another on the slide and set the timings
so that they play in order. You can adjust the delays and repeats as needed.
517

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Layering Animated Objects
Part of the challenge of animation is in deciding which objects should appear and disappear and
in what order. Theoretically, you could layer all of the objects for every slide in the entire pre-
sentation on a single slide and use animation to make them appear and disappear on cue.
Caution
If you are thinking about creating complex layers of animation where some objects disappear and are
replaced by other objects on the same slide, step back and consider whether it would be easier to simply
use two or more separate slides. When there is no delay or animation deﬁned in the transition between
two slides (if their content is identical or very similar), the effect is virtually identical to that of layered,
animated objects — with much less time and effort required to set them up. ■
You can use layering when you want part of a slide to change while the rest of it remains static.
For example, you could create your own animated series of illustrations by stacking several pho-
tos and then animating them so that the bottom one appears, followed by the next one on top
of it, and so on. This can provide a rough simulation of motion video from stills, much like ﬂip-
ping through illustrations in the corners of a stack of pages. You can set the animation speeds
and delays between clips as needed to achieve the effect you want.
When you stack objects, the new object that is placed on top of the old object obscures it, so
that it is not necessary to include an exit action for the old object. However, if the item being
placed on top is smaller than the one beneath, then you need to set up an exit effect for the
object beneath and have it occur concurrently (that is, With Previous) with the entrance of the
new one. For example, suppose that you want to place a photo on the right side of a slide, and
some explanatory text for it on the left, and then you want to replace these elements with a dif-
ferent photo and different text, as shown in Figure 18-23. In Lab 2 at the back of this book,
you’ll learn step-by-step how to set up this type of animation sequence.
FIGURE 18-23
Although these ﬁgures look like two separate slides, they are actually a single slide at two different
points in the animation sequence.
518

Chapter 18: Creating Animation Effects and Transitions
To set up this animation to occur on the same slide, you would ﬁrst place the content that
should appear ﬁrst, and then apply exit effects to this content. For example, set the initial photo
to On Click for its exit trigger, which will make it disappear when you click the mouse. Set its
associated text box to With Previous and have it animate immediately after this photo, so that
the text box disappears at the same time as the photo.
Next, place the other text box and other picture over the top of the ﬁrst items. In Normal view,
it looks like each spot has both a picture and a text box. You must now animate the new text
box and the new picture with entrance effects that are set to With Previous, so that both will
appear at the same time that the other two items are exiting. They all have the same animation
number because they all occur simultaneously.
It is always a good idea to preview animation effects in Slide Show view after creating them. To
do this, click the Slide Show View icon in the Animation pane. When you have ﬁnished check-
ing the effects, press Esc to return to PowerPoint.
Summary
In this chapter, you learned how to animate the objects on your slides to create some great
special effects, and how to create animated transitions from slide to slide. You learned how to
specify sounds, speeds, and timing for effects, and how to layer effects to occur sequentially or
simultaneously. Use this newfound knowledge for good, not evil! In other words, do not apply
so many animations that your audience focuses more on the effects than on your message. If you
would like more practice with these effects, work through Lab 2 at the end of this book.
In the next chapter, you’ll learn how to create support materials for a presentation, such as hand-
outs and speaker notes, and how to format and ﬁne-tune their formatting.

I
f you are presenting a live show, the centerpiece of your presentation is
your slides. Whether you show them using a computer screen, a slide
projector, or an overhead projector, the slides — combined with your
own dazzling personality — make the biggest impact. But if you rely on your
audience to remember everything you say, you may be disappointed. With
handouts, the audience members can follow along with you during the show
and even take their own notes. They can then take the handouts home with
them to review the information again later.
You probably want a different set of support materials for yourself than you
want for the audience. Support materials designed for the speaker’s use are
called speaker notes. In addition to small printouts of the slides, the speaker
notes contain any extra notes or background information that you think you
may need to jog your memory as you speak. Some people get very ner-
vous when they speak in front of a crowd; speaker notes can remind you
of the joke you wanted to open with or the exact ﬁgures behind a particular
pie chart.
The When and How of Handouts
Presentation professionals are divided about how and when to use handouts
most effectively. Here are some of the many conﬂicting viewpoints. I can’t
say who is right or wrong, but each of these statements brings up issues that
you should consider. The bottom line is that each of them is an opinion on
how much power and credit to give to the audience; your answer may vary
depending on the audience you are addressing.
 You should give handouts at the beginning of the presentation.
The audience can absorb the information better if they can
follow along on paper.
523

Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
This approach makes a lot of sense. Research has proven that people absorb more facts if
presented with them in more than one medium. This approach also gives your audience
free will; they can listen to you or not, and they still have the information. It’s their choice,
and this can be extremely scary for less-conﬁdent speakers. It’s not just a speaker conﬁ-
dence issue in some cases, however. If you plan to give a lot of extra information in your
speech that’s not on the handouts, people might miss it if you distribute the handouts at
the beginning because they’re reading ahead.
 You shouldn’t give the audience handouts because they won’t pay as close atten-
tion to your speech if they know that the information is already written down for
them.
This philosophy falls at the other end of the spectrum. It gives the audience the least power
and shows the least conﬁdence in their ability to pay attention to you in the presence of a
distraction (handouts). If you truly don’t trust your audience to be professional and listen,
this approach may be your best option. However, don’t let insecurity as a speaker drive you
prematurely to this conclusion. The fact is that people won’t take away as much knowledge
about the topic without handouts as they would if you provide handouts. So, ask yourself
if your ultimate goal is to ﬁll the audience with knowledge or to make them pay attention
to you.
 You should give handouts at the end of the presentation so that people will have
the information to take home but not be distracted during the speech.
This approach attempts to solve the dilemma with compromise. The trouble with it, as
with all compromises, is that it does an incomplete job from both angles. Because audi-
ence members can’t follow along on the handouts during the presentation, they miss the
opportunity to jot notes on the handouts. And because the audience knows that handouts
are coming, they might nod off and miss something important. The other problem is that if
you don’t clearly tell people that handouts are coming later, some people spend the entire
presentation frantically copying down each slide on their own notepaper.
Creating Handouts
To create handouts, you simply decide on a layout (a number of slides per page) and then
choose that layout from the Print dialog box as you print. No muss, no fuss! If you want to get
more involved, you can edit the layout in Handout Master view before printing.
Choosing a Layout
Assuming you have decided that handouts are appropriate for your speech, you must decide on
the format for them. You have a choice of one, two, three, four, six, or nine slides per page.
 1: Places a single slide vertically and horizontally ‘‘centered’’ on the page.
 2: Prints two big slides on each page. This layout is good for slides that have a lot of ﬁne
print and small details or for situations where you are not conﬁdent that the reproduction
quality will be good. There is nothing more frustrating for an audience than not being able
to read the handouts!
524

Chapter 19: Creating Support Materials
 3: Makes the slides much smaller — less than one-half the size of the ones in the two-slide
layout. But you get a nice bonus with this layout: lines to the side of each slide for
note-taking. This layout works well for presentations where the slides are big and simple,
and the speaker is providing a lot of extra information that isn’t on the slides. The audience
members can write the extra information in the note-taking space provided.
 4: Uses the same size slides as the three-slide layout, but they are spaced out two-by-two
without note-taking lines. However, there is still plenty of room above and below each
slide, so the audience members still have lots of room to take notes.
 6: Uses slides the same size as the three-slide and four-slide layouts, but crams more slides
on the page at the expense of note-taking space. This layout is good for presentation with
big, simple slides where the audience does not need to take notes. If you are not sure if the
audience will beneﬁt at all from handouts being distributed, consider whether this layout
would be a good compromise. This format also saves paper, which might be an issue if you
need to make hundreds of copies.
 9: Makes the slides very tiny, almost like a Slide Sorter view, so that you can see nine at a
time. This layout makes them very hard to read unless the slide text is extremely simple.
I don’t recommend this layout in most cases, because the audience really won’t get much
out of such handouts.
Tip
One good use for the nine-slides model is as an index or table of contents for a large presentation. You can
include a nine-slides-per-page version of the handouts at the beginning of the packet that you give to the
audience members, and then follow it up with a two-slides-per-page version that they can refer to if they
want a closer look at one of the slides. ■
Finally, there is an Outline handout layout, which prints an outline of all of the text in your
presentation — that is, all of the text that is part of placeholders in slide layouts; any text in
extra text boxes you have added manually is excluded. It is not considered a handout when you
are printing, but it is included with the handout layouts in the Handout Master. More on this
type of handout later in the chapter.
Printing Handouts
When you have decided which layout is appropriate for your needs, print your handouts as
follows:
1.
(Optional) If you want to print only one particular slide, or a group of slides, select the
ones you want in either Slide Sorter view or in the slide thumbnails task pane on the left.
2.
Select File ➪Print. The Print options appear.
3.
Enter a number of copies in the Copies text box. The default is 1. If you want the copies
collated (applicable to multi-page printouts only), make sure you mark the Collate
check box.
4.
Set options for your printer or choose a different printer. See the ‘‘Setting Printer-Speciﬁc
Options’’ section later in this chapter for help with this.
525

Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
5.
If you do not want to print all the slides, type the slide numbers that you want into the
Slides text box. Indicate a contiguous range with a dash. For example, to print slides 1
through 9, type 1-9. Indicate noncontiguous slides with commas. For example, to print
slides, 2, 4, and 6, type 2, 4, 6. Or to print slides 2 plus 6 through 10, type 2, 6-10. To
print them in reverse order, type the order that way, such as 10-6, 2.
Alternatively, you can click Print All Slides to open a menu of range choices, and choose
one of these from its list:
 Print Selection to print multiple slides you selected before you issued the Print com-
mand. It is not available if you did not select any slides beforehand.
 Print Current Slide to print whatever slide you selected before you issued the Print
command.
 Custom Range to print the slide numbers that you type in the Slides text box. When
you enter slide numbers in the Slides text box, this option gets selected automatically,
so usually you don’t have to select this option manually.
 Custom Show to print a certain custom show you have set up. Each custom show
you have created appears on the list. You won’t see any custom shows if you haven’t
created any.
6.
(Optional) Hidden slides are printed, by default. If you don’t want to print hidden slides,
click the same button again to reopen the menu and click Print Hidden Slides to toggle
the check mark off next to that command.
7.
Click Full Page Slides to open a menu of views you can print.
8.
On the menu that appears, click the number and layout of handouts you want. See
Figure 19-1.
Note
You can choose in step 8 to print an Outline if you prefer. An outline can be a useful handout for an audience
in certain situations. ■
9.
(Optional) Click the Color button and select the color setting for the printouts:
 Color: This is the default. It sends the data to the printer assuming that color will be
used. When you use this setting with a black-and-white printer, it results in slides with
grayscale or black backgrounds. Use this setting if you want the handouts to look as
much as possible like the on-screen slides.
 Grayscale: Sends the data to the printer assuming that color will not be used. Colored
backgrounds are removed, and if text is normally a light color on a dark background,
that is reversed. Use this setting if you want PowerPoint to optimize the printout for
viewing on white paper.
 Pure Black and White: This format hides most shadows and patterns, as described in
Table 19-1. It’s good for faxes and overhead transparencies.

Tip
To see what your presentation will look like when printed to a black-and-white printer, on the View tab click
Grayscale or Pure Black and White. If you see an object that is not displaying the way you want, right-click
it and choose Grayscale or Black and White. One of the options there may help you achieve the look you’re
after. ■
10.
(Optional) If desired, open the drop-down list from which you chose the handout layout
and select any of these additional options:
 Frame Slides: Draws a black border around each slide image. Useful for slides being
printed with white backgrounds.
 Scale to Fit Paper: Enlarges the slides to the maximum size they can be and still ﬁt on
the layout (as deﬁned in the Handout Master, covered later in this chapter).
 High Quality: Optimizes the appearance of the printout in small ways, such as allow-
ing text shadows to print.
 Print Comments and Ink Markup: Prints any comments that you have inserted with
the Comments feature in PowerPoint (covered in Chapter 5).
11.
Check the preview of your handouts, which appears at the right. Make any necessary
changes.
12.
Click Print. The handouts print, and you’re ready to roll!
Caution
Beware of the cost of printer supplies. If you are planning to distribute copies of the presentation to a lot
of people, it may be tempting to print all of the copies on your printer. But the cost per page of printing is
fairly high, especially if you have an inkjet printer. You will quickly run out of ink in your ink cartridge and
have to spend $20 or more for a replacement. Consider whether it might be cheaper to print one original
and take it to a copy shop. ■
Setting Printer-Speciﬁc Options
In addition to Print settings in PowerPoint that you learned about in the preceding section, there
are controls you can set that affect the printer you have chosen.
Notice that a printer’s name appears under the Printer heading in Figure 19-1. Click that
printer’s name to open a menu of additional printers you can select instead. These are the
printers installed on your PC (either local or network).
Note
Some of the ‘‘printers’’ listed are not really physical printers but drivers that create other types of ﬁles.
For example, Fax saves a copy of the ﬁle in a format that is compatible with the Fax driver included in
Windows. It doesn’t produce a hard copy printout. ■
After selecting the desired printer, click the Printer Properties hyperlink beneath the name. A
Properties dialog box opens that is speciﬁc to that printer. Figure 19-2 shows the box for my
HP PhotoSmart C4700 printer, an all-in-one inkjet. Notice that there are three tabs: Printing
Shortcuts, Features, and Advanced. The tabs may be different for your printer.
528

Chapter 19: Creating Support Materials
FIGURE 19-2
Each printer’s options are slightly different, but the same types of settings are available on most
printers.
These settings affect how the printer behaves in all Windows-based programs, not just in
PowerPoint, so you need to be careful not to change anything that you don’t want globally
changed. Here are some of the settings you may be able to change on your printer. (Not all of
these are shown in Figure 19-2.)
 Paper Size: The default is Letter, but you can change to Legal, A4, or any of several
other sizes.
 Paper Source: If your printer has more than one paper tray, you may be able to select
Upper or Lower.
 Paper Type: Some printers print at different resolutions or with different settings depend-
ing on the type of paper (for example, photo paper versus regular paper). You can choose
the type of paper you are printing on.
 Print Quality: Some printers give you a choice of quality levels, such as Draft, Normal,
and Best. Draft is the quickest; Best is the slowest and may use more ink.
 Duplex or Print on Both Sides: Some printers enable you to print on both sides of the
paper. Some printers ﬂip the paper over automatically but most prompt you to ﬂip it over
manually.
529

Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
 Orientation: You can choose between Portrait and Landscape. It’s not recommended that
you change this setting here, though; make such changes in the Page Setup dialog box in
PowerPoint instead. Otherwise, you may get the wrong orientation on a printout in other
programs.
 Page Order: You can choose Front to Back or Back to Front. This determines the order the
pages print.
 Pages Per Sheet: The default is 1, but you can print smaller versions of several pages on a
single sheet. This option is usually only available on PostScript printers.
 Copies: This sets the default number of copies that should print. Be careful; this number
is a multiplier. If you set two copies here, and then set two copies in the Print dialog box in
PowerPoint, you end up with four copies.
 Graphics Resolution: If your printer has a range of resolutions available, you may be able
to choose the resolution you want. My printer lets me choose between 300 and 600 dots
per inch (dpi); on an inkjet printer, choices are usually 360, 720, and 1,440 dpi. Achieving
a resolution of 1,440 on an inkjet printer usually requires special glossy paper.
 Graphic Dithering: On some printers, you can set the type of dithering that makes up
images. Dithering is a method of creating shadows (shades of gray) from black ink by using
tiny crosshatch patterns. You may be able to choose between Coarse, Fine, and None.
 Image Intensity: On some printers, you can control the image appearance with a
light/dark slide bar.
Some printers, notably inkjets, come with their own print-management software. If that’s
the case, you may have to run that print-management software separately from outside of
PowerPoint for full control over the printer’s settings. You can usually access such software from
the Windows Start menu.
Using the Handout Master
Just as the Slide Master controls your slide layout, the Handout Master controls your hand-
out layout. To view the Handout Master, on the View tab click Handout Master, as shown in
Figure 19-3. Unlike the Slide Master and Title Master, you can have only one Handout Master
layout per presentation.
You can do almost exactly the same things with the Handout Master that you can with the Slide
Master. The following sections describe some of the common activities.
Setting the Number of Slides Per Page
You can view the Handout Master with various numbers of slides per page to help you see how
the layout will look when you print it. However, the settings are not different for each num-
ber of slides per page; for example, if you apply a header or footer, or page background, for a
three-slides-per-page layout, it also applies to all the others. To choose the number of slides per
page to display as you work with the Handout Master, click the Slides Per Page button and then
make your selection from its menu. See Figure 19-4.

Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
Using and Positioning Placeholders
The Handout Master has four placeholders by default: Header, Footer, Date, and Page Number,
in the four corners of the handout respectively:
 Header: Appears in the upper-left corner, and is a blank box into which you can type ﬁxed
text that will appear on each page of the printout.
 Footer: Same thing as Header but appears in the lower-left corner.
 Date: Appears in the upper-right corner, and shows today’s date by default.
 Page Number: Appears in lower-right corner and shows a code for a page number <#>.
This will be replaced by an actual page number when you print.
In each placeholder box, you can type text (replacing, if desired, the Date and Page codes already
there). You can also drag the placeholder boxes around on the layout.
There are two ways to remove the default placeholders from the layout. You select the place-
holder box and press Delete, or you can clear the check box for that element on the Handout
Master tab as shown in Figure 19-5.
FIGURE 19-5

checkboxes for
placeholders
Note
Because the header and footer are blank by default, there is no advantage to deleting these placeholders
unless they have something in them you want to dispose of; having a blank box and having no box at all
have the same result. ■
Tip
You can’t move or resize the slide placeholder boxes on the Handout Master, nor can you change its mar-
gins. If you want to change the size of the slide boxes on the handout or change the margins of the page,
consider exporting the handouts to Word and working on them there. See the section ‘‘Exporting Handouts
or Notes Pages to Word’’ at the end of this chapter for more information. ■
532

Chapter 19: Creating Support Materials
Setting Handout and Slide Orientation
Orientation refers to the direction on the page the material runs. If the top of the paper is one
of the narrow edges, it’s called Portrait; if the top of the paper is a wide edge, it’s Landscape.
Figure 19-6 shows the difference in handout orientation.
FIGURE 19-6
Portrait (left) and Landscape (right) handout orientation.
You can also set an orientation for the slides themselves on the handouts. This is a separate set-
ting that does not affect the handout page in terms of the placement of the header, footer, and
other repeated elements. Figure 19-7 shows the difference between portrait and landscape slide
orientation on a portrait handout.
FIGURE 19-7
Landscape (left) and Portrait (right) slide orientation.
To set either of these orientations, use their respective drop-down lists on the Handout Master
tab, in the Page Setup group.
533

Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
Formatting Handouts
You can manually format any text on a handout layout using the formatting controls on the
Home tab, the same as with any other text. Such formatting affects only the text you select, and
only on the layout you’re working with. You can also select the entire placeholder box and apply
formatting.
You can also apply Colors, Fonts, and/or Effects schemes from the Edit Theme group, as shown
in Figure 19-8, much like you can do for the presentation as a whole. The main difference is that
you cannot select an overall theme from the Themes button; all the themes are unavailable from
the list while in Handout Master view. The settings you apply here affect only the handouts, not
the presentation as a whole.
FIGURE 19-8
Apply color, font, and/or effect schemes from the Edit Theme group.
534

Chapter 19: Creating Support Materials
Note
You probably won’t have much occasion to apply an Effects scheme to a handout layout because handouts
do not usually have objects that use effects (i.e., drawn shapes, charts, or SmartArt diagrams). ■
Creating Speaker Notes
Speaker notes are like handouts, but for you. Only one printout format is available for
them: the Notes Pages layout. It consists of the slide on the top half (the same size as in the
two-slides-per-page handout) with the blank space below it for your notes to yourself.
Speaker notes printed in PowerPoint are better than traditional note cards for several reasons.
For one thing, you can type your notes right into the computer and print them out on regular
paper. There’s no need to jam a note card into a typewriter and use messy correction ﬂuid or
erasers to make changes. The other beneﬁt is that each note page contains a picture of the slide,
so it’s not as easy to lose your place while speaking.
Typing Speaker Notes
You can type your notes for a slide in Normal view (in the notes pane), or in Notes Page view.
The latter shows the page more or less as it will look when you print your notes pages; this can
help if you need to gauge how much text will ﬁt on the printed page.
To switch to Notes Page view, on the View tab click Notes Page as shown in Figure 19-9. Unlike
some of the other views, there is no shortcut button for this view in the bottom-right corner of
the PowerPoint window. Once you’re in Notes Page view, you can zoom and scroll just like in
any other view to see more or less of the page at once. You can scroll further to move from slide
to slide, or you can move from slide to slide in the traditional ways (the Page Up and Page Down
keys on the keyboard or the Next Slide or Previous Slide buttons on-screen).
Note
Use the Zoom control to zoom in or out until you ﬁnd the optimal view so that the text you type is large
enough to be clear, but small enough so that you can see across the entire width of the note area. I ﬁnd
that 100 percent works well on my screen at 1024 x 768 resolution, but yours may vary. ■
Just type your notes in the Notes area, the same as you would type any text box in Power-
Point. The lines in the paragraph wrap automatically. Press Enter to start a new paragraph. When
you’re done, move to the next slide.
535

Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
FIGURE 19-9
Notes Page view is one of the best ways to work with your speaker notes.
Changing the Notes Page Layout
Just as you can edit your handout layouts, you can also edit your notes page layout. Just switch
to its Master and make your changes. Follow these steps:
1.
On the View tab, click Notes Master.
2.
Edit the layout, as you have learned to edit other masters. See Figure 19-10. This can
include:
 Moving placeholders for the slide, the notes, or any of the header or footer elements.
 Changing the font used for the text in any of those areas.
 Resizing the placeholder for the slide graphic.
 Resizing the Notes pane.
 Adding clip art or other graphics to the background.
 Adding a colored, textured, or patterned background to the notes page.
3.
When you are ﬁnished, click the Close Master View button to return to Normal view.
536

Chapter 19: Creating Support Materials
FIGURE 19-10
You can edit the layout of the notes pages in Notes Master view.
Printing Notes Pages
When you’re ready to print your notes pages, follow these steps:
1.
Choose File ➪Print. The Print controls appear.
2.
Click the button immediately below the Slides text box, and choose Handouts as the type
of layout to print.
3.
Set any other options, just as you did when printing handouts earlier in the chapter.
(If you need to choose which printer to use or to set the options for that printer, see the
‘‘Setting Printer-Speciﬁc Options’’ section earlier in this chapter.) There are no special
options for notes pages.
4.
Click OK. The notes pages print.
Caution
If you print notes pages for hidden slides, you may want to arrange your stack after they’re printed so that
the hidden slides are at the bottom. That way you won’t get confused when giving the presentation. ■
537

Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
Printing an Outline
If text is the main part of your presentation, you might prefer to print an outline instead of
mini-slides. You can use the outline for speaker notes, audience handouts, or both. To print the
text from Outline view, follow these steps:
1.
View the outline in Normal or Outline view.
2.
Choose File ➪Print. The Print controls appear.
3.
Click the button immediately below the Slides text box, and choose Outline as the type of
layout to print.
4.
Set any other print options, as you learned in the ‘‘Printing Handouts’’ section earlier in
the chapter.
5.
Click OK.
Be aware, however, that the outline will not contain text that you’ve typed in manually placed
text boxes or any other non-text information, such as tables, charts, and so on.
Exporting Handouts or Notes Pages
to Word
One of the drawbacks to PowerPoint is that the notes and handouts pages cannot be fully for-
matted. There’s a lot you can’t do with them — such as set margins, or change the sizes of
the slide images for handouts. To get around this, you might want to create your handouts in
Microsoft Word. To send your presentation to Word, follow these steps:
1.
Choose File ➪Save & Send ➪Create Handouts ➪Create Handouts. The Send to
Microsoft Ofﬁce Word dialog box appears as shown in Figure 19-11.
FIGURE 19-11
Choose a format for sending the presentation to Word.
538

Chapter 19: Creating Support Materials
2.
Choose one of the formats shown in Figure 19-11. You can send to Word in a variety
of formats. Some formats are more appropriate for handouts, others for speaker notes.
Table 19-2 gives some suggestions:

(Optional) If you want to maintain a link between the PowerPoint ﬁle and the Word
ﬁle, choose Paste Link. Otherwise, leave Paste selected. If you maintain a link, then the
changes you make to the PowerPoint ﬁle are reﬂected in the Word ﬁle.
4.
Click OK. Word opens and the slides appear in the format you chose. See Figure 19-12.
FIGURE 19-12
With the notes pages or handouts in Word, you can change the margins and other settings.
539

Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
5.
Modify the formatting as desired, and then print from Word.
6.
(Optional) Save your work in Word if you want to print the same pages again later. (You
may choose to resend to Word later, after making changes in PowerPoint instead.)
Note
The slides appear in Word in a table (if you chose a Next to Slides option), but without visible gridlines
showing. You can resize (or even delete) the columns for each element by dragging the column dividers,
just like you do in a table in PowerPoint. ■
Changing the Margins in Word
One beneﬁt of exporting handouts to Word is being able to change the margins. In Word, on
the Page Layout tab, click the Margins button, and choose a margin preset or choose Custom
Margins.
However, note that changing the page margins does not resize the table. If you change the left
margin, the table may start at a different place in relation to the left margin (because the table
is left-aligned), but if you want to increase the margins so that you can increase the table width,
those are two separate activities.
You can also set internal margins in the cells in a table. To do so, on the Table Tools Layout tab,
click Cell Margins.
Change the Table Alignment
The table itself has a default alignment in relationship to the page: Top Left. If you prefer the
look of a centered table, you may want to switch this:
 To make the table horizontally centered on the page, select the table as a whole. To do
this, click the square above and to the left of the table with the four-headed arrow in it.
Then use the Center button on the Home tab (Paragraph group) to center it. Note that this
does not center the text within the cells; this refers only to the table.
 To vertically center the table on the page, you need to set the vertical alignment for
the document. To do so, on the Page Layout tab in Word, click the dialog box launcher in
the Page Setup group, and on the Layout tab in the Page Setup dialog box, set the vertical
alignment to Center.
Change Alignment Within a Cell
To center the content within a cell horizontally, click in that cell and then on the Table Tools
Layout tab, click the Middle Center button (or any of the other buttons that are combinations of
vertical and horizontal alignment) as shown in Figure 19-13.
540

Chapter 19: Creating Support Materials
FIGURE 19-13
Set table alignment from the Table Tools Layout tab.
Resize Rows and Columns
To resize a column, drag the border between that column and the one to its right. When the
mouse pointer is over a column border, it changes to a double-headed arrow with a line between
the arrows. Alternatively you can specify an exact size by clicking in the column, and then on the
Table Tools Layout tab, set a value in the Cell Size group. Do the same for row heights. For a
better look at the gridlines, on the Table Tools Format tab, enable View Gridlines. These appear
only on-screen; they will not print.
Note
You cannot resize a row or column to the point that its text content no longer ﬁts. (And the lines for the
audience to write on are comprised of underline characters, which are considered text.) Therefore, you may
need to resize the content or even delete some of it. For example, if you use a layout that includes blank
lines, you’ll get several blank lines in some of the cells. To make these cells narrower, you need to decrease
the length of the lines ﬁrst. To make these cells shorter, you may need to delete one or more of the
lines. ■
Turn On/Off Cell Borders
By default, all borders are turned off for all cells in the table. You can turn them on in a variety
of ways, but perhaps the easiest is to select one or more cells, and then use the Borders button
on the Table Tools Design tab. Choose the button that has no borders (all dotted lines) to turn
all borders off again. See Figure 19-14.
Note
One thing to note about these borders is that whatever you choose applies to the selected range, not to the
individual cells. For example, suppose you choose a range of cells that contains three rows and you apply a
bottom border. The border would be applied only to the bottom of the bottom row of cells. ■
Apply a Background
To apply a background to the entire page, use the Page Color button on the Page Layout tab in
Word. A palette of colors appears. The choices are much the same as in PowerPoint.
541

Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
FIGURE 19-14
The Borders button has a drop-down list of border sides to turn on/off.
Tip
Word 2010 uses the same themes as PowerPoint. You can apply a theme to the document in Word to make
it match the formatting of the presentation in PowerPoint. ■
To apply a background to only certain cells, select the cells and then on the Table Tools
Design tab, click the Shading button and select a color. This is a lot like applying a ﬁll color
in PowerPoint.
Resize the Graphics
Resizing the slide images is one of the most common reasons why people export PowerPoint
handouts to Word. Each image is resizable individually, so they need not necessarily be the same
size (although it usually looks better if they are).
If you want to make the slides larger, you can ﬁrst increase the column width for the column in
which they reside. Then drag the selection handles on the slide thumbnail to resize.
Note
If you want to resize all of the slide images and you want them all to be the same size, set the table column
width to the width you want for the images and then resize each picture as large as it can be while still
ﬁtting in that column. Unfortunately you cannot resize multiple images as a batch. ■
542

Chapter 19: Creating Support Materials
Summary
In this chapter, you learned how to create a hard copy to support your presentation. You can
now create a variety of handouts, and write and print out speaker notes for yourself. You also
learned how to export handouts, notes pages, and outlines to Word, where you can use the full
power of Word’s formatting tools to create exactly the look you want.
In the next chapter, you take a look at the controls that PowerPoint offers for preparing for a
live presentation. You learn how to create custom shows, work with hidden slides, and navigate
through a presentation in Slide Show view.

t’s show time! Well, actually I hope for your sake that it is not time for
the show this very instant, because things will go much more smoothly
if you can practice using PowerPoint’s slide-show controls before you
have to go live.
Presenting the show can be as simple or as complex as you make it. At the
most basic level, you can start the show, move through it slide-by-slide with
simple mouse-clicks or key presses, and then end the show. However, to
take advantage of PowerPoint’s extra slide-show features, you should spend a
little time studying the following sections.
Note
The ﬁrst part of this chapter assumes that you are showing your presenta-
tion on a PC that has PowerPoint 2010 installed; sections later in this chapter
discuss other situations. ■
Starting and Ending a Show
To start a show, do any of the following:
 On the Slide Show tab, click either From Beginning or From Current
Slide.
 Click the Slide Show View button in the bottom-right corner of the
screen (to begin from the current slide).
 Press F5 (to begin from the beginning).
 Press Shift+F5 (to begin from the current slide).
Once the show is underway, you can control the movement from slide to
slide as described in the section, ‘‘Moving from Slide to Slide.’’
545

Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
To end the show, do any of the following:
 Right-click and choose End Show.
 Press Esc, - (minus), or Ctrl+Break.
If you want to temporarily pause the show while you have a discussion, you can blank the screen
by pressing W or , (comma) for a white screen, or B or . (period) for a black screen. To resume
the show, press any key.
Tip
If you set up the slide transitions to occur automatically at a certain time, you can stop or restart the show
by pressing S or + (plus sign). However, this is more of an issue for self-running shows, which are discussed
in Chapter 21. ■
Using the On-Screen Show Controls
When you display a slide show, the mouse pointer and show controls are hidden. To make them
appear, you can move the mouse. When you do this, very faint buttons appear in the bottom-left
corner of the slide show, as shown in Figure 20-1, and the mouse pointer also appears. You can
toggle the pointer and these buttons on and off by pressing A or = (equals). Ctrl+H also hides
the pointer and buttons. When you toggle this feature on, the following buttons appear:
FIGURE 20-1
Buttons appear in the bottom-left corner of a slide in Slide Show view. The third button opens a
menu that controls navigation between slides.
Back

Pen
Forward
 Back, the leftmost button, takes you back to the previous slide, or to the previous anima-
tion event if the present slide contains animation.
 Pen, next to Back, opens a menu for controlling the appearance of the pen or pointer.
(I discuss this feature later in this chapter.)
 Slide, which displays a box icon, opens a menu for navigating between slides. You can also
open the navigation menu, shown in Figure 20-2, by right-clicking anywhere on the slide.
546

Chapter 20: Preparing for a Live Presentation
FIGURE 20-2
Click the Slide button or right-click on the slide to open this menu.
Tip
You can set up your show to move backward when you click the right-mouse button. Choose File ➪Options,
click Advanced, and in the Slide Show section deselect the Show Menu on Right Mouse Click check box. If
you do that, you can’t right-click to open the navigation menu, though. The control buttons in the lower left
corner of Slide Show view can be disabled via File ➪Options ➪Advanced ➪Slide Show ➪Show Popup
Toolbar. ■
 Forward, the rightmost button, moves you to the next slide. Normally, you can just click
to go to the next slide, but if you are using the pen (covered later in this chapter), then
clicking it causes it to draw, rather than advance the presentation. In this situation, you
can use the Forward button.
Note
Because the slide navigation menu that appears is identical whether you click the Slide button or
right-click anywhere on the slide, this chapter only mentions the right-click method whenever you need to
choose something from this menu. However, keep in mind that you can also click the Slide button if you
prefer. ■
New in PowerPoint 2010 are media control shortcuts in Slide Show view as seen in Table 20-1.
There are a lot of shortcut keys to remember when working in Slide Show view, and so
PowerPoint provides a handy summary of these keys. To see them, right-click and choose Help,
or press F1. The Slide Show Help dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 20-3. The dialog box
has several tabbed pages; click a tab to browse for the shortcuts of interest to you. Click OK to
close this dialog box when you are done.

Moving from Slide to Slide
The simplest way to move through a presentation is to move to the next slide. To do so, you can
use any of these methods:
 Press any of these keys: N, Spacebar, right arrow, down arrow, Enter, or Page Down.
 Click the left-mouse button.
 Right-click and then choose Next.
 Click the right-pointing arrow button in the bottom-left corner of the slide.
548

Chapter 20: Preparing for a Live Presentation
If you have animated any elements on a slide, these methods advance the animation, and do not
necessarily move to the next slide. For example, if you have animated your bulleted list so that
the bullets appear one at a time, then any of the actions in this list make the next bullet appear,
rather than making the next slide appear. Only after all of the objects on the current slide have
displayed does PowerPoint advance to the next slide. If you need to immediately advance to
the next slide, you can use the instructions in the section, ‘‘Jumping to Speciﬁc Slides,’’ later in
this chapter.
To back up to the previous slide, use any of these methods:
 Press any of these keys: P, Backspace, left arrow, up arrow, or Page Up.
 Click the left-pointing arrow button on the bottom-left corner of the slide.
 Right-click and then choose Previous.
You can also go back to the last slide that you viewed. To do this, right-click and choose Last
Viewed. Although you would think that the last slide viewed would be the same as the previous
slide, this is not always the case. For example, if you jump around in the slide show — such
as to a hidden slide — then the last slide viewed is not the previous slide in the show but the
hidden slide that you have just viewed.
Jumping to Speciﬁc Slides
There are several ways to jump to a particular slide. One of the easiest ways is to select the slide
by its title. To do so, follow these steps:
1.
During the slide show, right-click to display the shortcut menu.
2.
Select Go to Slide. A submenu appears, listing the titles of all of the slides in the presen-
tation, as shown in Figure 20-4. Parentheses around the slide numbers indicate hidden
slides.
3.
Click the slide title to which you want to jump.
FIGURE 20-4
You can go to a speciﬁc slide using the Go to Slide command on the menu.
549

Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
Tip
The slide titles on the menu shown in Figure 20-4 come from title placeholders on the slides. If you want
to show text on the list here but you don’t want it to appear on the slide, type it in a title placeholder and
then drag the placeholder off the edge of the slide, so it doesn’t show in Slide Show view. ■
You can also jump to a certain slide number by typing this number and pressing Enter. For
example, to go to the third slide, you would type 3 and then press Enter. Another way is to
press Ctrl+S to open an All Slides dialog box listing the titles of all of the slides in the presenta-
tion. You can click a slide to select it and then click Go To, as shown in Figure 20-5.
FIGURE 20-5
The All Slides dialog box lists the titles of all of the slides so that you can select the one that you
want to go to.
To jump back to the ﬁrst slide in the presentation, hold down both the left- and right-mouse
buttons for two seconds (or type 1 and press Enter).
Blanking the Screen
Sometimes during a live presentation there may be a delay. Whether it is a chatty audience mem-
ber with a complicated question, a ﬁre drill, or just an intermission, you will want to pause the
show.
If you have the slides set for manual transition, then whichever slide you stopped on remains on
the screen until you resume. However, you may not want this. For example, it may be distracting
to the audience, especially if the pause is to allow someone to get up and speak in front of the
screen. A solution is to turn the screen into a blank expanse of black or white. To do so, type
W or a comma (for white), or B or a period (for black). To return to the presentation, you can
press the same key, or press any key on the keyboard.
550

Chapter 20: Preparing for a Live Presentation
Tip
While the screen is completely black or white, you can draw on it with the Pen tool so that it becomes a
convenient ‘‘scratch pad.’’ Any annotations that you make with the pen on the blank screen are not saved;
when you resume the presentation, they are gone forever. (In contrast, you do have the opportunity to save
any annotations you make on the slides themselves, as you will learn in the next section.) ■
Using the On-Screen Pen
Have you ever seen a coach in a locker room drawing out football plays on a chalkboard? Well,
you can do the same thing in PowerPoint. You can have impromptu discussions of concepts that
are illustrated on slides, and punctuate the discussion with your own circles, arrows, and lines.
Perhaps during the discussion portion of your presentation, you may decide that one point on
the slide is not important. In this case, you can use the pen to cross it out. Conversely, a certain
point may become really important during a discussion so that you want to emphasize it. In this
case, you can circle it or underline it with the pen cursor.
You can choose your pen color as follows:
1.
Move the mouse or press A to make the buttons appear.
2.
Click the Pointers button (the one that looks like a pen). A menu appears. Alternatively
you can right-click and then choose Pointer Options to see this same menu.
3.
Select Ink Color and then click the color you want, as shown in Figure 20-6.
FIGURE 20-6
You can select a pen type and an ink color for it.
Tip
To change the default pen color for the show, so that you do not always have to manually select the color
you want, click Set Up Show on the Slide Show tab. Then, in the Pen Color drop-down list, choose the
color you want. ■
551

Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
You can turn on the type of pen that you want, as follows:
1.
Click the Pointers button again.
2.
Click the type of pen that you want:
 Pen: A thin solid line
 Highlighter: A thick, semi-transparent line
Note
The on-screen buttons in the slide show continue to work while you have a pen enabled, but you have to
click them twice to activate them — once to tell PowerPoint to temporarily switch out of the Pen mode,
and then again to open the menu. ■
You can also turn on the default Pen by pressing Ctrl+P, and then return to the arrow again by
pressing Ctrl+A or Esc.
After enabling a pen, just drag-and-draw on the slide to make your mark. You should practice
drawing lines, arrows, and other shapes because it takes a while to master. Figure 20-7 shows an
example of using the pen.
FIGURE 20-7
You can draw on the slide with the pen tools.
Pen
Highlight
Caution
As you can see from Figure 20-7, the on-screen pen is not very attractive. If you know in advance that you
are going to emphasize certain points, then you may prefer to build the emphasis into the presentation by
making these points larger, bolder, or in different colors. You can also circle the points using an animated
oval shape. ■
To erase your lines and try again, press E (for Erase), or open the Pointer menu (or right-click
and choose Pointer Options) and choose Erase All Ink On Slide. To erase just a part of the ink,
open the Pointer menu, choose Eraser, and then use the mouse pointer to erase individual lines.
Note
Unlike in some earlier versions of PowerPoint, drawings stay with a slide, even when you move to
another slide. ■
552

Chapter 20: Preparing for a Live Presentation
When you exit Slide Show view after drawing on slides, a dialog box appears, asking whether
you want to keep or discard your annotations. If you choose Keep, the annotations become
drawn objects on the slides, which you can then move or delete, similar to a line drawn with
the drawing tools.
To change the pen back to a pointer again, open the Pointer menu and choose Arrow, press
Ctrl+A, or press Esc. The pen remains a pen when you advance from slide to slide.
Hiding Slides for Backup Use
You may not always want to show every slide that you have prepared. Sometimes it pays to pre-
pare extra data in anticipation of a question that you think someone might ask, or to hold back
certain data unless someone speciﬁcally requests it.
By hiding a slide, you keep it ﬁled in reserve, without making it a part of the main slide show.
Then, at any time during the presentation when (or if) it becomes appropriate, you can display
that slide. Hiding refers only to whether the slide is a part of the main presentation’s ﬂow; it has
no effect in any other view.
Tip
If you have only a handful of slides to hide, go ahead and hide them. However, if you have a large group of
related slides to hide, consider creating a custom show for them instead. Custom shows are covered later in
this chapter. ■
Hiding and Unhiding Slides
A good way to hide and unhide slides is in Slide Sorter view because an indicator appears below
each slide to show whether it is hidden. This way, you can easily determine which slides are
part of the main presentation. In the slide thumbnail pane in Normal view, hidden slides appear
ghosted out.
Follow these steps to hide a slide:
1.
Switch to Slide Sorter view.
2.
Select the slide or slides that you want to hide. Remember, to select more than one slide,
hold down the Ctrl key as you click the ones that you want.
3.
Click the Hide Slide button on the Slide Show toolbar. A gray box appears around the
slide number and a diagonal line crosses through it, indicating that it is hidden.
To unhide a slide, select the slide and click the Hide Slide button again. The slide’s number
returns to normal. You can also right-click a slide and choose Hide Slide or Unhide Slide to
toggle the hidden attribute on and off.
553

Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
Tip
To quickly unhide all slides, select all of the slides (press Ctrl+A) and then click the Hide Slides button
twice. The ﬁrst click hides all of the remaining slides that were not already hidden, and the second click
unhides them all. ■
Showing a Hidden Slide During a Presentation
When you advance from one slide to the next during a show, hidden slides do not appear. (This
is what being hidden is about, after all.) If you need to display one of the hidden slides, follow
these steps:
1.
In Slide Show view, right-click, or click the Slide icon in the bottom-left corner of
the screen.
2.
Choose Go to Slide, and then choose the slide to which you want to jump. Hidden slides
show their slide numbers in parentheses, but you can access them like any other slide.
Refer back to Figure 20-4, where the third slide is hidden.
Tip
If you already know the number of the hidden slide, then you can simply type the number on the keyboard
and press Enter to display it. This also works with slides that are not hidden. ■
Once you display a hidden slide, you can easily return to it later. When you move backward
through the presentation (using the Backspace key, the left- or up-arrow key, or the on-screen
Back button), any hidden slides that you displayed previously are included in the slides that
PowerPoint scrolls back through. However, when you move forward through the presentation,
the hidden slide does not reappear, regardless of when you viewed it previously. You can always
jump back to it again using the preceding steps. You can also set up hyperlinks to go to, and
leave, hidden slides.
Using Custom Shows
Many slide shows have a linear ﬂow: First you show slide one, and then slide two, and so on,
until you have completed the entire presentation. This format is suitable for situations where
you are presenting clear-cut information with few variables, such as a presentation about a new
insurance plan for a group of employees. However, when the situation becomes more complex,
a single-path slide show may not sufﬁce. This is especially true when you are presenting a per-
suasive message to decision-makers; you want to anticipate their questions and needs for more
information and have many backup slides, or even entire backup slide shows that are prepared
in case questions arise. Figure 20-8 shows a ﬂow chart for this kind of presentation.
Note
If you simply want to hide a few slides for backup use, then you do not need to create a custom show.
Instead, you can just hide the slides. ■

Another great use for custom shows is to set aside a group of slides for a speciﬁc audience. For
example, you might need to present essentially the same information to employees at two dif-
ferent sites. In this case, you could create two custom shows within the main show, where each
show includes slides that they both have in common, as well as slides that are appropriate for
only one audience or the other. Figure 20-9 shows a ﬂow chart for this kind of presentation.
Notice in Figure 20-9 that although some of the slides in the two custom shows are the same,
they repeat in each custom show rather than jumping back to the main presentation. This is
because it is much easier to jump to the custom show once and stay there, than it is to keep
jumping into and out of the show.
Slides in a custom show remain a part of the main presentation. Placing a slide in a custom
show does not exclude it from the regular presentation ﬂow. However, you may decide that
you no longer want to show the main presentation in its present form; you may just want to
use it as a resource pool from which you can select slides for other custom shows. To learn how
to set up PowerPoint so that a custom show starts rather than the main presentation when you
enter Slide Show view, see the section, ‘‘Using a Custom Show as the Main Presentation,’’ later in
this chapter.

Ideas for Using Custom Shows
Here are some ideas to start you thinking about how and why you might want to include some
custom shows in your presentation ﬁles:
 Avoiding duplication: If you have several shows that use about 50 percent of the same
slides and 50 percent different ones, then you can create all of the shows as custom shows
within a single presentation ﬁle. This way, the presentations can share the 50 percent of
the slides that they have in common.
 Managing change: By creating a single presentation ﬁle with custom shows, you make
it easy to manage changes. If any changes occur in your company that affect any of the
common slides, then making the change once in your presentation ﬁle makes the change
to each of the custom shows immediately.
 Overcoming objections: You can anticipate client objections to your sales pitch and pre-
pare several custom shows, each of which addresses a particular objection. Then, whatever
556

Chapter 20: Preparing for a Live Presentation
reason your potential customer gives for not buying your product, you have a counterac-
tive argument at hand.
 Covering your backside: If you think that you may be asked for speciﬁc ﬁgures or other
information during a speech, you can have this information ready in a custom show (or
on a few simple hidden slides, if there is not a lot of information) to display if needed. No
more going through the embarrassment of having to say, ‘‘I’m not sure, but let me get back
to you on that.’’
Creating Custom Shows
To create a custom show, ﬁrst create all of the slides that should go into it. Start with all of the
slides in the main presentation. Then follow these steps:
1.
On the Slide Show tab, click Custom Slide Show, and then click Custom Shows. The
Custom Shows dialog box opens.
Note
If no custom shows are deﬁned yet, the Custom Shows command is the only item that appears on this menu.
Otherwise, your existing custom shows appear on the menu, and you can run them from here. ■
2.
Click New. The Deﬁne Custom Show dialog box opens.
3.
Type a name for your custom show in the Slide Show Name text box, replacing the default
name.
4.
In the Slides in Presentation pane, click the ﬁrst slide that you want to appear in the cus-
tom show.
Tip
You can select multiple slides in step 4 by holding down the Ctrl key as you click each one. However, be aware
that if you do this, the slides move to the Slides in Custom Show pane in the order that they originally appeared.
If you want them in a different order, copy each slide over separately, in the order that you want, or rearrange
the order as described in step 7. ■
5.
Click Add to copy the slide to the Slides in Custom Show pane, as shown in Figure 20-10.
FIGURE 20-10
Use the Add button to copy slides from the main presentation into the custom show.
557

Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
6.
Repeat steps 4 and 5 for each slide that you want to include in the custom show.
7.
If you need to rearrange the slides in the custom show, click the slide that you want to
move in the Slides in Custom Show pane and then click the up- or down-arrow button to
change its position.
8.
When you are ﬁnished building your custom show, click OK. The new show appears in
the Custom Shows dialog box.
9.
(Optional) To test your custom show, click the Show button. Otherwise, click Close to
close the Custom Shows dialog box.
Editing Custom Shows
You can manage your custom shows from the Custom Shows dialog box, the same place
in which you created them. This includes editing, deleting, or making a copy of a show. To
change which slides appear in a custom show, and in what order, follow these steps:
1.
On the Slide Show tab, click Custom Slide Show and then click Custom Shows. The Cus-
tom Shows dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 20-11.
2.
If you have more than one custom show, then click the one that you want to edit.
3.
Click Edit. The Deﬁne Custom Show dialog box reappears, as shown in Figure 20-10.
4.
Add or remove slides, as needed. To add a slide, select it in the left pane and click Add.
To remove a slide, select it in the right pane and click Remove.
FIGURE 20-11
You can select a custom show to edit, copy, or delete, and then click the appropriate button.
Note
Removing a slide from a custom show does not remove it from the overall presentation. ■
5.
Rearrange slides as needed with the up- and down-arrow buttons.
6.
(Optional) You can change the custom show’s name in the Slide Show Name text box.
7.
Click OK. PowerPoint saves your changes.
8.
Click Close to close the Custom Shows dialog box.
558

Chapter 20: Preparing for a Live Presentation
Copying Custom Shows
A good way to create several similar custom shows is to create the ﬁrst one and then copy it.
You can then make small changes to the copies as necessary. To copy a custom show, follow
these steps:
1.
On the Slide Show tab, click Custom Slide Show and then click Custom Shows. The Cus-
tom Shows dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 20-11.
2.
If you have more than one custom show, then select the show that you want to copy.
3.
Click Copy. A copy of the show appears in the dialog box. The ﬁlename includes the
words Copy of so that you can distinguish it from the original.
4.
Edit the copy, as explained in the preceding section, to change its name and content.
5.
When you are ﬁnished, click Close to close the Custom Shows dialog box.
Deleting Custom Shows
It is not necessary to delete a custom show when you do not want it anymore; it does not do any
harm remaining in your presentation. Because custom shows do not display unless you call for
them, you can simply choose not to display it. However, if you want to make your presentation
more orderly, you can delete a custom show that you no longer want. Follow these steps:
1.
On the Slide Show tab, click Custom Slide Show and then click Custom Shows. The Cus-
tom Shows dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 20-11.
2.
Select the show that you want to delete.
3.
Click Remove. The show disappears from the list.
4.
Click Close to close the Custom Shows dialog box.
Displaying a Custom Show
To start your presentation with a custom show, on the Slide Show tab, click Custom Slide Show
and then click the name of the custom show on the drop-down menu. The custom show runs.
You can also call up the custom show at any time during your main presentation. There are two
ways to do this: You can navigate to the custom show with PowerPoint’s regular presentation
controls, or you can create a hyperlink to the custom show on your slide.
Navigating to a Custom Show
During a presentation, you can jump to any of your custom shows by following these steps:
1.
Open the shortcut menu in Slide Show view by right-clicking or by clicking the navigation
button.
2.
Choose Custom Show and then select the custom show that you want, as shown in
Figure 20-12. The custom show starts.
559

Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
FIGURE 20-12
Choose the custom show that you want to jump to.
When you start a custom show, you are no longer in the main presentation. To verify this, open
the shortcut menu again, choose Go to Slide, and check out the list of slides. This list shows
only the slides that belong to the custom show.
Navigating Back to the Main Show
To return to the main show, follow these steps:
1.
Press Ctrl+S to open the All Slides dialog box.
2.
Open the Show drop-down list and choose All Slides.
3.
Select the slide that you want to go to. You can choose from all of the slides in the entire
presentation.
4.
Click Go To.
Tip
To avoid having to click Ctrl+S to return to the main show, you can create a hyperlink or action button for
a speciﬁc slide in your main show. ■
Creating a Hyperlink to a Custom Show
Although you learn a lot about hyperlinks in upcoming chapters, here is a preview. Hyperlinks
are hot links that you place on your slides. When you click a hyperlink, you jump the display to
some other location. This is why they are called hot. A hyperlink can jump to an Internet loca-
tion, a different spot in your presentation, an external ﬁle (such as a Word document), or just
about anywhere else.
One way to gain quick access to your custom shows in a presentation is to create hyperlinks for
them on certain key slides that act as jumping-points. You can insert a text hyperlink into any
text box, and its text becomes the marker that you click. For example, if you insert a hyperlink
560

Chapter 20: Preparing for a Live Presentation
for a custom show called Radio Spots, then the hyperlink text could read Radio Spots. If you want
to get fancier, you can select some existing text or an existing graphic object, and then attach the
hyperlink to it. For example, in Figure 20-13, I have inserted a clip-art image of a radio and set
it up to be a hyperlink to the custom show that provides details about the radio spots.
FIGURE 20-13
You can create hyperlinks on slides that display custom shows.
Text box with
instructions
Hyperlink to
custom show
Follow these steps:
1.
If you are attaching the hyperlink to another object (such as the radio in Figure 20-13) or
some text, then select the object or text.
2.
On the Insert tab, click Hyperlink. The Insert Hyperlink dialog box appears.
3.
Click the Place in This Document icon along the left side of the dialog box.
4.
In the Select a Place in This Document pane, scroll down to the Custom Shows list.
5.
Click the custom show that you want to jump to with this hyperlink, as shown in
Figure 20-14.
6.
(Optional) If you want to return to the same spot that you left in the main presentation
after viewing this custom show, then select the Show and Return check box. If you do not
select this option, the presentation will simply end when the custom show ends.
7.
(Optional) If you want to specify a ScreenTip for the hyperlink, click the ScreenTip button
to create one.
8.
Click OK.
561

Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
FIGURE 20-14
Choose one of your custom shows as the place to jump to when the user clicks the hyperlink.
Choose a
custom show
If you are using text for the hyperlink, the text now appears underlined and in a different color.
This color is controlled by the color theme of your presentation (speciﬁcally the Hyperlink and
Followed Hyperlink colors). If you are using a graphic, its appearance does not change. How-
ever, when you are in Slide Show view and you move the mouse pointer over the object, the
pointer changes to a pointing hand, indicating that the object is a hyperlink.
Tip
If you do not want your linked text to be underlined or to change colors upon return, you can draw a
rectangle with no border and 100% Transparent ﬁll over the top of the text and link to the shape instead.
Because this shape is on top of the text, you click it instead of the text. Keep in mind that you should prob-
ably create your link before changing the border and ﬁll of the shape to no color! ■
Another way to use hyperlinks for custom shows is to set up the ﬁrst few slides generically for
all audiences, and then to branch off into one custom show or another, based on user input. The
diagram in Figure 20-8 is an example of this type of presentation. After the ﬁrst two slides, you
could set up a ‘‘decision’’ slide that contains two hyperlinks — one for Digital Products and one
for Audio Products. The user would then click the hyperlink they want.
Tip
You can also create hyperlinks to custom shows by using action buttons. Action buttons are a special type
of drawn shape that is designed speciﬁcally for creating hyperlinks within a presentation. ■
562

Chapter 20: Preparing for a Live Presentation
Using a Custom Show as the Main Presentation
If you have a complete show contained in one of your custom shows, you may sometimes want
to show it as the default presentation. To do this, you must tell PowerPoint that you want to
bypass the main presentation and start with the custom show.
The easiest way to show a custom show is to select it from the Custom Slide Show drop-down
menu on the Slide Show tab. However, you can also set up a custom show to be the default
show for the presentation by following these steps:
1.
On the Slide Show tab, click Set Up Slide Show. The Set Up Show dialog box appears.
2.
Open the Custom Show drop-down list and choose the show that you want to use, as
shown in Figure 20-15.
FIGURE 20-15
Use the Set Up Show dialog box to control which of your
custom shows runs when you start the show.
3.
Click OK. Now, when you start the show, the custom show runs.
Tip
You do not have to set up a custom show to narrow down the list of slides that appear when you run your
presentation. You can choose which slides you want to show by using the From and To text boxes in the
Show Slides section, as shown in Figure 20-15. For example, to show slides 5 to 10, you would type 5 in
the From text box and 10 in the To text box. ■
563

Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
Creating and Using Sections
When you have lots of slides in a presentation, you may ﬁnd it helpful to organize them into
sections for easier management in Normal or Slide Sorter view. You can then collapse or expand
the sections to focus in on a subset of the slides, as shown in Figure 20-16.
FIGURE 20-16

Caution
Section breaks do not appear in the Outline pane in Normal view — they only appear in the Slides pane. ■
Creating a Section Break
To divide your presentation into multiple sections, insert a section break between two slides. All
the slides above the break are in one section, and all slides below the break are in another.
To insert a section break, follow these steps:
1.
In Normal view, in the Slides pane, click between two slides. A horizontal line
appears there.
2.
Right-click the horizontal line and choose Add Section. A new section break is created.
You can also select the slide you want to use as the ﬁrst slide in a section. Then choose Home ➪
Section to make it into a section heading.
564

Chapter 20: Preparing for a Live Presentation
Renaming a Section
Each section you create has a default generic name: Untitled Section. You will probably want to
rename the sections to more meaningful names. To rename a section, follow these steps:
1.
Right-click the section bar. A shortcut menu opens, as shown in Figure 20-17.
2.
Click Rename Section.
3.
Type the new name.
4.
Press Enter.
FIGURE 20-17
Right-clicking a section bar opens a shortcut menu of commands.
Deleting a Section
There are several options when deleting a section:
 Remove Section: Deletes the section break but keeps the slides in that section, which are
placed in the previous section.
 Remove Section & Slides: Deletes the section break and all slides that were within that
section.
 Remove All Sections: Deletes all section break lines but keeps all slides.
To do any of these, right-click the section bar and make your selection from the shortcut menu,
as shown in Figure 20-17.
Reordering Sections
Sections can be useful for quickly reordering large blocks of slides. Place all the slides within a
single section, and then move the section to move all the slides at once.
To move a section, use either of these techniques:
 Right-click the section bar and choose Move Section Up or Move Section Down.
See Figure 20-17.
 Drag the section bar up or down in the Slides pane. You might ﬁnd this easier if
you collapse the section, but it is not required.
565

Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
Caution
If you select a section bar and then issue the Cut or Delete command, all the slides within that section
are removed, but the section bar remains. The section bar itself is not included in the operation. Therefore
you cannot use the Cut and Paste method (Ctrl+X and Ctrl+V) to move sections to different spots in the
presentation. ■
Giving a Presentation on a
Different Computer
The computer on which you create a presentation is usually not the same computer that you will
use to show it. For example, you may be doing the bulk of your work on your desktop computer
in your ofﬁce in Los Angeles, but you need to use your laptop computer to give the presentation
in Phoenix.
One way to transfer a presentation to another computer is simply to copy the PowerPoint ﬁle
(the ﬁle with the .pptx extension) using a ﬂash drive or other removable media. However, this
method is imperfect because it assumes that the other computer has all of the fonts, sounds, and
other elements that you need for every part of the show. This can be a dangerous assumption.
For example, suppose that your presentation contains a link to some Excel data. If you do not
also copy the Excel ﬁle, then you cannot update the data when you are on the road.
A better way to ensure that you are taking everything you need while traveling is to use the
Package Presentation for CD feature in PowerPoint. This feature reads all of the linked ﬁles and
associated objects and ensures that they are transferred along with the main presentation. You do
not actually need to copy the presentation to a writeable CD, and you do not need a CD-R or
CD-RW drive to use this feature. You can copy the presentation to anywhere you want, such as
to a ZIP drive or a network location.
Copying a Presentation to CD
If you have a CD-R or CD-RW drive, then copying the presentation to CD is an attractive choice.
It produces a self-running disc that contains all the presentation ﬁles and their needed linked
ﬁles, plus a Web page (.html format) from which you can choose which presentation ﬁle to run.
That Web page also contains a hyperlink you can use to download the PowerPoint Viewer appli-
cation if needed. (You need it only if PowerPoint itself is not installed on the PC on which you
want to view the presentation.) Figure 20-18 shows a sample Web page for accessing a package
that contains two different presentations, for example.
Tip
You can copy many presentation ﬁles onto a single CD, not just the currently active one. The only limit
is the size of the disc (usually 650MB to 700MB). By default, the currently active presentation is included,
although the following steps show you how to add other presentations. ■
566

Chapter 20: Preparing for a Live Presentation
FIGURE 20-18
The Package for CD command generates a CD containing all data ﬁles needed to show the presen-
tation plus a browser-based interface like the one shown here.
Here is the basic procedure, which is elaborated on in the following sections:
1.
Place a blank CD-R or CD-RW disc in your writeable CD drive.
2.
Finalize the presentation in PowerPoint. If you are using a CD-R disc, keep in mind that
this disc type is not rewriteable, and so you should ensure that the presentation is exactly
as you want it.
3.
Choose File ➪Save & Send ➪Package Presentation for CD ➪Package for CD. The
Package for CD dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 20-19.
FIGURE 20-19
Use the Package for CD feature to place all of the necessary ﬁles for the presentation on a CD.
4.
Type a name for the CD; this is similar to adding a volume label for the disc.
5.
(Optional) Add more ﬁles to the CD if you want. See the next section, ‘‘Creating a CD
Containing Multiple Presentation Files,’’ for more details.
567

Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
6.
(Optional) Set any options that you want. See the section, ‘‘Setting Copy Options,’’ later in
this chapter, for more details.
7.
Click Copy to CD.
8.
If a warning appears asking if you want to include linked ﬁles in your package, click Yes.
The CD-writing process may take several minutes, depending on the writing speed of your
CD drive and the size of the presentation ﬁles that you are placing on it.
If a message appears that the package will not include comments, revisions, or ink anno-
tations, click Continue. This message appears only if your presentation contains any of
those things.
9.
A message appears when the ﬁles are successfully copied to the CD, asking whether you
want to copy the same ﬁles to another CD. Click Yes or No. If you choose No, then you
must also click Close to close the Package for CD dialog box.
The resulting CD automatically plays the presentations when you insert it in any computer. You
can also browse the CD’s contents to open the PowerPoint Viewer separately and use it to play
speciﬁc presentations.
Caution
File corruption can occur on a CD drive during the writing process. After burning a CD, test it thoroughly
by running the complete presentation from CD before you rely on the CD copy as the version that you take
with you while traveling. ■
Creating a CD Containing Multiple Presentation Files
By default, the active presentation is included on the CD, but you can also add others, up to
the capacity of your disc. For example, if you have several versions of the same presentation
for different audiences, then a single CD can contain all of them. As you are preparing to copy
the ﬁles using the Package for CD dialog box, shown in Figure 20-19, follow these steps to add
more ﬁles:
1.
Click Add. An Add dialog box opens, similar to the Open dialog box that you use to open
PowerPoint ﬁles.
2.
Select the additional ﬁles that you want to include, and click Add to return to the
Package for CD dialog box. The list of ﬁles now appears as shown in Figure 20-20, with
extra controls.
Note
You can select multiple ﬁles from the same location by holding down the Ctrl key as you click the ones you
want. To include multiple ﬁles from different locations, repeat steps 1 and 2 for each location. ■
568

Chapter 20: Preparing for a Live Presentation
FIGURE 20-20
When you specify multiple ﬁles for a CD, you can specify the order in which they should play.
3.
(Optional) Rearrange the list by clicking a presentation and then clicking the up- or
down-arrow buttons to the left of the list.
4.
If you need to remove a presentation from the list, click it and then click Remove.
5.
Continue making the CD as you normally would.
Setting Copy Options
The default copy options are suitable in most situations. However, you may sometimes want
to modify them. To do this, open the Package Presentation for CD dialog box, and follow
these steps:
1.
Click Options. The Options dialog box open, as shown in Figure 20-21.
FIGURE 20-21
You can set options for copying the presentations to CD.
569

Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
2.
The Linked Files check box is selected by default; this option tells PowerPoint to
include the full copies of all linked ﬁles. You can deselect this option if you want; a
static copy of the linked data will remain in the presentation, but the link will not work.
You should leave this option selected if you have sounds or multimedia ﬁles in your
presentation that are linked rather than embedded.
3.
The Embedded TrueType Fonts check box is also selected by default. If you are sure that
the destination computer contains all of the fonts that are used in the presentation, then
deselect this option. This makes the presentation ﬁle slightly smaller. Remember, not all
fonts can be embedded; this depends on the level of embedding allowed by the font’s
manufacturer.
4.
If you want to add passwords for the presentations, do so in the Enhance Security and
Privacy section. There are separate text boxes for open and modify passwords.
5.
If you want to check the presentation for private information, such as your name or
any comments, select the Inspect Presentations for Inappropriate or Private Information
check box.
6.
Click OK, and then write the CD as you normally would.
Note
If you select the check box in step 5, as part of the process, the Document Inspector window opens, and
you can use it to check the document for selected types of content. Inspect it and click Inspect. ■
Copying a Presentation to Other Locations
Although it is not well known, you can also use the Package Presentation for CD feature to copy
presentation ﬁles and their associated support ﬁles to any location you want. For example, you
can transfer ﬁles to another computer on a network, or place them on a ﬂash drive. To do so,
follow these steps:
1.
In the Package for CD dialog box, set up the package exactly the way you want it,
including all of the presentation ﬁles and options. See the preceding sections for more
information.
2.
Click Copy to Folder. A Copy to Folder dialog box appears.
3.
Type a name for the new folder to be created in the Name the Folder text box.
4.
Type a path for the folder in the Choose Location text box, as shown in Figure 20-22.
FIGURE 20-22
You can copy presentation ﬁles and support ﬁles anywhere, not just to a CD.

Chapter 20: Preparing for a Live Presentation
5.
Click OK.
6.
If a warning appears about linked ﬁles, then click Yes or No as appropriate. PowerPoint

Working with Audio-Visual Equipment
The ﬁrst part of this chapter assumed that you were using a computer with a single monitor
to show your presentation, but this may not always be the case. This section looks at the
entire range of audio-visual options from which you can choose. There are many models of
projection equipment in conference rooms all across the world, but most of them fall into one of
these categories:
 Noncomputerized equipment: This can include an overhead transparency viewer, a
35mm slide projector, or other older technology. You face two challenges if you need
to work with this category of equipment: One is ﬁguring out how the equipment works
because every model is different, and the other is producing attractive versions of your
slides to work with them. There are companies that can produce 35mm slides from your
PowerPoint ﬁles, or you can invest in a slide-making machine yourself. For transparencies,
you simply print your slides on transparency ﬁlm that is designed for your type of printer.
 Single computer with a single monitor: If there is a computer with a monitor in the
meeting room, then you can run your presentation on that computer. You can do this with
the Package Presentation for CD feature that is discussed in the preceding sections, and
then run the presentation directly from the CD, provided that PC has PowerPoint or the
PowerPoint Viewer on it.
 Single computer with a dual-monitor system: On systems with dual monitors, one
monitor is shown to the audience and the other is for your own use. This is useful when
you want to display your speaker notes on the monitor that the audience does not see.
However, you might need to set up multi-monitor support in Windows so that you can
view different displays on each monitor.
 Projection system (LCD) or large monitor without a computer: If the meeting room
has a large monitor but no computer, you will need to bring your own laptop computer
and connect it to the monitor. Most of these systems use a standard VGA plug and cable.
The following sections look at some of these options in more detail.
Presenting with Two Screens
If you have two monitors — either your laptop computer screen and an external monitor, or two
external monitors hooked up to the same computer — you can display the presentation on one
of them and your own notes on the other one. This is a very handy setup!
571

Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
Caution
To use two screens, you need the full version of PowerPoint on your laptop, not just the PowerPoint
Viewer. You also need compatible hardware. For example, your laptop must have an external VGA port
and a built-in video card that supports DualView (a Windows feature) in your version of Windows. If you
have a desktop computer, you must have two separate video cards or a video card with two separate
video ports. ■
Conﬁguring Display Hardware for Multi-Screen
Viewing
First, you need to prepare your hardware. On a laptop computer, this means enabling both the
built-in and the external monitor ports and connecting an external monitor. Some laptops toggle
between internal, external, and dual monitors with an Fn key combination; refer to your laptop’s
documentation.
On a desktop computer, install a second video card and monitor, and then do the following to
set them up in Windows:
1.
When Windows restarts after you install the second video card, right-click the desktop
and choose Personalize (Windows Vista or Windows 7) or Properties (Windows XP).
2.
Click Display Settings (Windows Vista), or Display ➪Change Display Settings (Windows
7), or click the Settings tab (Windows XP).
3.
A sample area displays two monitors. Figure 20-23 shows Windows 7; other Windows
versions are similar.
FIGURE 20-23
You must set up the second monitor in Windows before setting it up in PowerPoint.
572

Chapter 20: Preparing for a Live Presentation
4.
The monitor that you use most of the time should be monitor 1, and the other one should
be monitor 2. To determine which is which, click Identify Monitors (Windows Vista, as in
Figure 20-23) or the Identify button (Windows XP or Windows 7); large numbers appear
brieﬂy on each screen.
5.
If you need to swap the numbering of the monitors, click the one that should be the pri-
mary monitor and then select Make This My Main Display (Windows 7), This Is My Main
Monitor (Windows Vista), or Use This Device as the Primary Monitor (Windows XP). This
option will be unavailable if the currently selected monitor is already set to be the primary
one.
6.
Select the secondary monitor, and then select the Extend These Displays (Windows 7) or
Extend My Desktop onto This Monitor check box (Windows Vista) or Extend the Desktop
Onto This Monitor check box (Windows XP).
7.
(Optional) If the monitors are not arranged in the sample area in the way that they are
physically positioned on your desk, you can drag the icons for the monitors to where you
want them.
8.
(Optional) You can click a monitor in the sample area to adjust its display settings.
Tip
You can also adjust the refresh rate for each monitor. To do this, make sure that you have selected the
video card to which the monitor is attached, and then click the Advanced Settings button (Windows Vista or
Windows 7) or the Advanced button (Windows XP). On the Monitor tab in the dialog box that appears,
change the refresh rate. A higher refresh rate reduces screen ﬂicker, but if you exceed the monitor’s maximum
supported rate, the display may appear distorted and the screen may be damaged. ■
9.
Click OK. You are now ready to work with the two monitors in PowerPoint.
You can now drag items from your primary monitor to your secondary one! This can also be
useful outside of PowerPoint. For example, you can have two applications open at once, each in
its own monitor window.
Setting Up a Presentation for Two Screens
If you have two monitors available, and conﬁgured as described in the preceding section, you
can use the following steps to help PowerPoint recognize and take advantage of these monitors:
1.
Open the presentation in PowerPoint.
2.
On the Slide Show tab, click Set Up Slide Show. The Set Up Show dialog box opens, as
shown in Figure 20-24.
3.
In the Multiple Monitors section, open the Display Slide Show On drop-down list and
choose the monitor that the audience will see. This list is not available if you do not have
multiple monitors enabled (see the preceding section).
4.
Select the Show Presenter View check box. This will give you a separate, very useful con-
trol panel on the other monitor during the show, as described in the next section.
5.
Click OK. You are now ready to show the presentation using two separate displays — one
for you and one for the audience.
573

Presenting with Two Screens Using Presenter View
Presenter View is a special view of the presentation that is available only on systems with more
than one monitor, and only where you have selected the Show Presenter View check box in
the Set Up Show dialog box, as described in the preceding section. This view provides many
useful tools for managing the show behind-the-scenes, as shown in Figure 20-25. It appears
automatically on the non-audience monitor when you enter Slide Show view, and includes the
following features:
 At the bottom of the screen is a pane containing thumbnail images of each slide. You can
jump to a slide by selecting it here. You can also move between slides by using the large
left- and right-arrow buttons.
 The speaker notes for each slide appear in the right pane. You cannot edit them from here,
however. Zoom buttons appear below the speaker notes pane, so you can zoom in and out
on the notes.
 A Time and Duration display appears below the current slide. It tells you the current time
and how long you have been talking.
 The panes are adjustable by dragging the dividers between them, so you can have larger
thumbnails, a smaller slide display, more or less room for notes, and so on.
Presenter View does not have all of the features that you have learned about so far in Slide
Show view. However, keep in mind that the audience’s monitor is still active and available for
your use! Because you extended the desktop onto the second monitor, you can simply move
the mouse pointer onto the audience’s display and then use the buttons in the corner (or the
right-click menu) as you normally would.

Summary
In this chapter, you learned how to prepare for a big presentation. You now know how to pack-
age a presentation and move it to another computer, how to set up single and multi-screen
audio-visual equipment to work with your laptop, and how to control a presentation on-screen
using your computer. You also know how to jump to different slides, how to take notes during a
meeting, and how to assign action items. You’re all set! All you need now is a nice starched shirt
and a shoeshine.
In the next chapter, you learn about designing presentations that are user-interactive or
self-running. You can do this by creating easy-to-use action buttons for situations where you
cannot be there to press the buttons yourself.

presentations
I
n the last few chapters, you’ve been learning how to build and present
slide shows that support you as you speak to your audience directly.
When you build such presentations, you design each slide to assist you,
not duplicate your efforts. Slides designed for a live presentation typically
do not contain a lot of detail; they function as pointers and reminders for the
much more detailed live discussion or lecture taking place in the foreground.
When you build a self-running or user-interactive presentation, the focus is
exactly the opposite. The slides are going out there all alone and must be
capable of projecting the entire message all by themselves. Therefore, you
want to create slides that contain much more information.
Another consideration is audience interest. When you speak to your audi-
ence live, the primary focus is on you and your words. The slides assist you,
but the audience watches and listens primarily to you. Therefore, to keep the
audience interested, you have to be interesting. If the slides are interesting,
that’s a nice bonus. With a self-running or user-interactive presentation, on
the other hand, each slide must be fascinating. The animations and transi-
tions that you learned about in Chapter 18 come in very handy in creating
interest, as do sounds and videos, discussed in Chapters 16 and 17.
Note
Another name for a self-running presentation is a kiosk presentation. This
name comes from the fact that many self-running informational presentations
are located in little buildings, or kiosks, in public areas such as malls and con-
vention centers. ■
577

Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
Understanding User Interactivity
Letting the audience take control can be scary. If you aren’t forcing people to go at a certain pace
and view all the slides, what’s to guarantee that they don’t skim through quickly or quit halfway
through?
Well, there are no guarantees. Even in a show with a live speaker, though, you can’t control
whether or not people pay attention. The best you can do is put together a compelling presen-
tation and hope that people want to view it. The same applies to a user-interactive presentation.
People are either going to watch and absorb it or they’re not. There’s no point in treating the
audience like children. On the contrary, they will likely respond much better if you give them
the options and let them decide what content they need.
Navigational controls are the main thing that separates user-interactive presentations from nor-
mal ones. You have to provide an idiot-proof way for people to move from slide to slide. Okay,
technically, yes, they could use the same navigational controls that you use when presenting a
show (see Chapter 20), but those controls aren’t always obvious. Moving forward is a no-brainer
(click the mouse), but what about moving backward? Would you have guessed ‘‘P’’ for Previous
if you hadn’t already known? Probably not. And what if they want to end the show early? The
ﬁrst half of this chapter shows you various techniques for creating navigational controls.
Here are some ideas for ways to use navigational controls:
 Web resource listings. Include a slide that lists Web sites that users can visit for more
information about various topics covered in your presentation. You can also include Web
cross-references throughout the presentation at the bottom of pertinent slides.
 Product information. Create a basic presentation that describes your products, with For
More Information buttons for each product. Then create hidden slides with the detailed
information about each product and hyperlink those slides to the For More Information
buttons. Don’t forget to put a Return button on each hidden slide so that users can easily
return to the main presentation.
 Access to custom shows. If you have created custom shows, set up action buttons or
hyperlinks that jump the users to them on request.
 Quizzes. Create a presentation with a series of multiple-choice questions. Create custom
action buttons for each answer. Depending on which answer the user clicks, set it up to
jump to either a ‘‘Congratulations, you’re right!’’ slide or a ‘‘Sorry, try again’’ slide. From
each, include a Return button to go on with the quiz.
 Troubleshooting information. Ask the user a series of questions and include action but-
tons or hyperlinks for the answers. Set them up to jump to the slides that further narrow
down the problem based on their answers until they ﬁnally arrive at a slide that explains
the exact problem and proposes a solution.
 Directories. Include a company directory with e-mail hyperlinks for various people or
departments so that anyone reading the presentation can easily make contact.
Besides navigational controls, the other big consideration with a user-interactive show is distri-
bution. How will you distribute the presentation to your audience? Some of the methods you’ve
578

Chapter 21: Designing User-Interactive or Self-Running Presentations
already learned about in this book will serve you well here, such as packaging a presentation on
CD (Chapter 20). Or you may choose instead to set up a user kiosk in a public location, e-mail
the presentation ﬁle to others, or make it available on the Web.
Navigational Control Basics
All navigational controls that you create on slides are, at their core, hyperlinks. You’re proba-
bly familiar with these already from using the Web; they’re underlined bits of text or specially
enabled graphics that take you to a different site or page that you clicked. In the case of your
PowerPoint presentation, the hyperlinks take users to the next or previous slide, a hidden slide,
a custom slide show, or perhaps some external source such as a Web site or data ﬁle.
Types of Navigational Controls
Even though they are all hyperlinks (so they all work the same underneath), the various types
of navigational controls can look very different on the surface. You can have ‘‘bare’’ hyperlinks
where the actual address appears, hyperlinks where the text is different from the address, action
button graphics, or graphics you create or import yourself. In addition, a navigational control can
have pop-up helper text in a ScreenTip. Figure 21-1 shows several types of navigational controls
on a sample slide.
FIGURE 21-1

Directions
Note
Most people associate the word hyperlink with the Internet. However, a hyperlink is simply a link to
somewhere else; it does not necessarily refer to an Internet location. You can hyperlink to another slide in
the same presentation, for example, or to a different presentation, or even to some unrelated data ﬁle in
another application like Word or Excel. ■
579

Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
Notice the directions at the bottom of Figure 21-1. This is necessary because it’s not obvious
that the graphic is a hyperlink, and users would not normally think to try clicking on it. Notice
also the ScreenTip associated with the second text hyperlink. This is useful because the text itself
does not provide the address, and the user may want to know the address before clicking the
hyperlink. For example, if the PC does not have Internet access, the user would not want to
click a hyperlink that points to a Web page.
The action buttons in the bottom-right corner in Figure 21-1 are typical of the action buttons
that PowerPoint creates. They are just AutoShapes with pre-assigned action settings for On Click.
You can create your own, but the preset ones are awfully handy.
Evaluating Your Audience’s Needs
Before you dive into building an interactive presentation, you must decide how the audience
will navigate from slide to slide. There is no one best way; the right decision depends on the
audience’s comfort level with computers and hyperlinks.
Consider these points:
 Is the audience technically savvy enough to know that they should press a key or click the
mouse to advance the slide, or do you need to provide that instruction?
 Does your audience understand that the arrow action buttons mean Forward and Back, or
do you need to explain that?
 Does your audience understand hyperlinks and Web addresses? If they see underlined text,
will they know that they can click it to jump elsewhere?
 Is it enough to include some instructions on a slide at the beginning of the show, or do you
need to repeat the instructions on every slide?
Think about your audience’s needs and come up with a plan. Here are some sample plans:
 For a beginner level audience: Begin the presentation with an instructional slide explain-
ing how to navigate. Place action buttons in the same place on each slide (using the Slide
Master) to help them move backward and forward and include a Help button that they can
click to get more detailed instructions.
 For an intermediate level audience: Place action buttons on the same place on each
slide, along with a brief note on the ﬁrst slide explaining their presence.
 For an advanced audience: Include other action buttons on the slide that allow the user
to jump around freely in the presentation — go to the beginning, to the end, to a certain
section, and so on. Advanced users understand and can take advantage of a more sophisti-
cated navigation system.
In the next few sections, I show you how to create all of the types of navigational controls shown
in Figure 21-1.
580

Chapter 21: Designing User-Interactive or Self-Running Presentations
Creating Text Hyperlinks
Now that you know that hyperlinks are the key to user interactivity, you will want to add some
to your presentation. You can start with text-based hyperlinks because they’re the easiest. You
can add them either bare or with explanatory text.
Typing a Bare Hyperlink
The most basic kind of hyperlink is an Internet address, typed directly into a text box.
When you enter text in any of the following formats, PowerPoint automatically converts it to
a hyperlink:
 Web addresses: Anything that begins with http:// or www.
 E-mail addresses: Any string of characters with no spaces and an @ sign in the middle
somewhere.
 FTP addresses: Anything that begins with ftp://.
You do not have to do anything special to create these hyperlinks; when you type them and
press Enter or the space bar, PowerPoint converts them to hyperlinks. You know the conver-
sion has taken place because the text becomes underlined and a different color. (The exact color
depends on the color scheme in use.)
Figure 21-2 shows some examples of these bare hyperlinks. I call them bare because
you see what’s underneath them — the actual address — right there on the surface.
There is no friendly ‘‘click here’’ text that the link hides behind. For example, the text
support@microsoft.com is a hyperlink that sends e-mail to that address. In contrast, a link that
reads ‘‘Click here to send e-mail to me’’ and contains the same hyperlink address is not bare,
because you do not see the address directly.
FIGURE 21-2
Some examples of bare Internet hyperlinks.
Note
If PowerPoint does not automatically create hyperlinks, the feature may be disabled. Choose File ➪Options.
Click Prooﬁng, and then click AutoCorrect Options. Click the AutoFormat As You Type tab, and make sure
the Internet and network paths with hyperlinks check box is marked. ■
581

Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
Note
FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol. It’s a method of transferring ﬁles via the Internet. FTP used to be a
totally separate system from the Web, but nowadays, Web browsers have FTP download capabilities built-in,
so anyone who has a Web browser can receive ﬁles via FTP. ■
Creating a Friendly Text Hyperlink
A friendly hyperlink is a hyperlink comprising text but not just the bare address. For example,
in Figure 21-1, ‘‘Customer Satisfaction Surveys’’ is a text hyperlink. (‘‘Friendly’’ is not an
industry-standard technical term; it’s just one I ﬁnd convenient for discussion in this book.)
You can select already-entered text and make it a hyperlink, or you can enter new text. Either
way, follow these steps:
Note
These steps take you through the process generically; see the sections in ‘‘Choosing the Hyperlink Address’’
later in the chapter for speciﬁc information about various kinds of hyperlinks you can create. ■
1.
To use existing text, select the text or its text box. Otherwise, just position the insertion
point where you want the hyperlink.
2.
On the Insert tab, click Hyperlink, or press Ctrl+K. The Insert Hyperlink dialog box
opens as shown in Figure 21-3.
FIGURE 21-3
Insert a hyperlink by typing the text to display and choosing the URL or other location to jump to.
Note
If the Hyperlink button is not available on the Insert tab, check to make sure you have positioned the insertion
point in a text box or selected some text. ■
582

Chapter 21: Designing User-Interactive or Self-Running Presentations
3.
In the Text to Display ﬁeld, type or edit the hyperlink text. This text is what appears
underlined on the slide. Any text you’ve selected appears in this ﬁeld by default; changing
the text here changes it on your slide as well.
4.
Enter the hyperlink or select it from one of the available lists. (See the following section,
‘‘Choosing the Hyperlink Address,’’ to learn about your options in this regard.)
5.
(Optional) The default ScreenTip for a hyperlink is its address (URL) or the ﬁle path if it is
a ﬁle stored on a local disk. If you want the ScreenTip to show something different when
the user points the mouse at the hyperlink, click the ScreenTip button and enter the text
for the ScreenTip. See Figure 21-4.
FIGURE 21-4
Enter a custom ScreenTip if desired.
6.
Click OK to close the Set Hyperlink ScreenTip dialog box.
7.
Click OK to accept the newly created hyperlink.
Tip
Ideally the combination of the hyperlink text and the ScreenTip should provide both the actual address and
some friendly explanation of it. If the bare address appears as the hyperlink text, use friendly text describing
the link location as the ScreenTip. If the friendly text appears as the hyperlink text, use the actual address
as the ScreenTip. ■
The options in step 4 for selecting the address were purposely glossed over because this is a
rather complex topic. The various options are shown in the next section.
Choosing the Hyperlink Address
You can use the Insert Hyperlink dialog box to create a hyperlink to any address that’s accessible
via the computer where the presentation will run. Although many people think of a hyperlink as
an Internet address, it can actually be a link to any ﬁle, application, Internet location, or slide.
Caution
A hyperlink will not work if the person viewing the presentation does not have access to the needed ﬁles
and programs or does not have the needed Internet or network connectivity. A hyperlink that works ﬁne on
your own PC might not work after the presentation has been transferred to the user’s PC. ■
583

Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
Possible addresses to hyperlink include the following:
 Other slides in the current presentation
 Slides in other presentations (if you provide access to those presentations)
 Documents created in other applications (if the user has those applications installed
and those document ﬁles are available)
 Graphic ﬁles (if the user has access to an application that can display them)
 Internet Web pages (if the user has an Internet connection and a Web browser)
 E-mail addresses (if the user has an Internet connection and an e-mail program)
 FTP site addresses (if the user has an Internet connection and a Web browser or
an FTP program)
Creating a Link to a Slide in This Presentation
The most common kind of link is to another slide in the same presentation. There are many uses
for this link type; for example, you can hide several backup slides that contain extra information.
You can then create hyperlinks on certain key slides that allow the users to jump to one of those
hidden slides to peruse the extra facts. To create a hyperlink to another slide:
1.
Start the hyperlink normally (on the Insert tab, click Hyperlink).
2.
In the Insert Hyperlink dialog box, click Place in This Document. The dialog box controls
change to show a list of the slides in the presentation (see Figure 21-5).
3.
Select the slide or custom show that you want.
4.
Click OK.
FIGURE 21-5
Select the slide that the hyperlink should refer to.
584

Chapter 21: Designing User-Interactive or Self-Running Presentations
Tip
If you are choosing a custom show and you want the presentation to continue from the original spot after
showing this custom show, mark the Show and Return check box (see Figure 21-5). This check box is not
available for individual slides. For an individual slide, put a Return action button on it to return to the pre-
viously viewed slide. See the section ‘‘Creating Your Own Action Buttons’’ later in this chapter. ■
Creating a Link to a Web or FTP Site
If you want to link to a Web or FTP site, as you learned earlier in the chapter, you can sim-
ply type the address directly into any text box. Alternatively, you can use the Insert Hyperlink
command to create the link.
When the Insert Hyperlink dialog box is open, if you don’t know the address you want to refer
to, you can browse for it. Here’s how:
1.
Leaving the Insert Hyperlink dialog box open, switch out of PowerPoint and back
to Windows.
2.
Open a Web browser and navigate to the page to which you want to refer.
3.
Switch back to PowerPoint. The address is ﬁlled in for you in the Address box.
4.
Continue creating the hyperlink normally.
Tip
You can also copy and paste a URL into the Address box, or choose a page from the Browsed Pages list. ■
Creating a Link to a File on Your Hard Disk or Network
You can also create a hyperlink to any ﬁle available on your PC’s hard disk or on your local area
network. This can be a PowerPoint ﬁle or a data ﬁle for any other program, such as a Word
document or an Excel spreadsheet. Or, if you don’t want to open a particular data ﬁle, you can
hyperlink to the program ﬁle itself, so that the other application simply opens.
For example, perhaps you have some detailed documentation for your product in Adobe
Acrobat format (PDF). This type of document requires the Adobe Acrobat Reader. So you
can create a hyperlink with the text ‘‘Click here to read the documentation’’ and link to the
appropriate PDF ﬁle. When your audience member clicks that link, Adobe Acrobat Reader opens
and the documentation displays.
Caution
Remember that not everyone has the same applications installed that you do. For example, although Adobe
Acrobat Reader is free, many people don’t have it installed yet. You might want to add another hyperlink or
button to your slide that users can click to download a free viewer for that application’s data from the Web
if needed. ■
585

Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
To link to a data ﬁle, start the hyperlink normally (on the Insert tab, click Hyperlink) and click
Existing File or Web Page if that is not already selected. Then do one of the following:
 Click Current Folder to display a ﬁle management interface from which you can select any
folder or drive on your system. You can open the Look In list and choose Computer to
start from the top level of your drives/folders structure, and then navigate to the location
containing the ﬁle and select it. See Figure 21-6.
 Click Recent Files to display a list of the ﬁles you have recently opened on your PC (all
types), and click the ﬁle you want from the list.
FIGURE 21-6
You can browse ﬁles on your hard disk by choosing Current Folder, and then setting Look
In to Computer.
Complete the hyperlink normally from that point. You are not limited to only the folder on your
local drives if you choose Current Folder; you can open the Look In list and choose My Network
Places to browse the network. However, make sure that the PC on which the presentation will be
displayed will also have access to this same location.
Creating a Link to an Application for Creating a New Document
Perhaps you want the audience to be able to create a new document by clicking a hyperlink.
For example, perhaps you would like them to be able to provide information about their expe-
rience with your Customer Service department. One way to do this is to let them create a new
document using a program that they have on their system, such as a word processor.
Caution
Keep in mind that not everyone will have the same applications you do. A new document hyperlink will not
work if the user does not have an appropriate application for creating that ﬁle type. ■
586

Chapter 21: Designing User-Interactive or Self-Running Presentations
To create a link to a new document, start the hyperlink normally. Click the Create New Doc-
ument button, and the controls in the Insert Hyperlink dialog box change to those shown in
Figure 21-7.
Enter the name of the new document that you want to create. The type of document created
depends on the extension you include. For example, to create a Word document, use the .doc or
.docx extension. See Table 21-1 for other extensions. If the path where it should be stored is not
correct in the Full Path area, click the Change button. Navigate to the desired location, and click
OK to return. Then click Edit the New Document Later and ﬁnish up normally.
Caution
If you provide this presentation to multiple users, each one will use the same ﬁlename for the new docu-
ment. This can be a problem because one ﬁle may overwrite another. It might be easier to collect informa-
tion from multiple users using an e-mail address hyperlink (discussed later in this chapter). ■
FIGURE 21-7
You can create a new document with a hyperlink.
The most important part about adding a link to create a new ﬁle is to make sure that you
use an extension that corresponds to a program that users have on the PCs where they
will be viewing the presentation. When a program is installed, it registers its extension (the
usually-three-character code after the period in a ﬁle’s name) in the Windows Registry, so
that any data ﬁles with that extension are associated with that program. For example, when
you install Microsoft Word, it registers the extension .docx for itself, and PowerPoint registers
.pptx for its own use. Table 21-1 lists some of the more common ﬁle types and their registered
extensions on most PCs. Also make sure that the location you specify for the Full Path will
always be accessible whenever the presentation is run.
587

Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
Tip
If you need to hyperlink to an executable ﬁle, but you do not need a new document (for example, to link
to a program like Calculator), do not use Hyperlink on the Insert tab. Instead, use an Action Setting and
choose Run Program as the action. For the program to run, use the full path to the application, in quotation
marks. Because you must enter the full paths to each of these, the link will probably not work when the
presentation is run on a different computer. ■

ﬁrst choice for documents unless you speciﬁcally need them to be without
formatting.
RTF
Rich Text Format, a ﬂexible, application-independent word processing format.
It works in WordPad (the free word processor in Windows), and also in most
other word processing programs, including Word and WordPerfect. This is a
good choice if you don’t know which word processing program is installed on
the PC.
WPD
WordPerfect, a competitor to Word.
BMP
Microsoft Paint (which comes free with Windows), or some other more
sophisticated graphics program if one is installed.
MDB
Microsoft Access, a database program.
MPP
Microsoft Project, a project management program.
PPTX or PPT
Microsoft PowerPoint (you know what that is!). PPTX is the 2007 version;
PPT is the 2003 and earlier.
XLSX, XLSM, XLS
Microsoft Excel, a spreadsheet program. XLSX and XLSM are the 2007 versions
or (non-macro-enabled and macro-enabled, respectively) and XLS is the 2003
and earlier version.
Creating a Link to an E-Mail Address
You can also create a link that opens the user’s e-mail program and addresses an e-mail to a
certain recipient. For example, perhaps you want the user to e-mail feedback to you about how
he liked your presentation or send you requests for more information about your product.
588

Chapter 21: Designing User-Interactive or Self-Running Presentations
Caution
For an e-mail hyperlink to work, the person viewing the presentation must have an e-mail application
installed on his or her PC and at least one e-mail account conﬁgured for sending e-mail. This isn’t always
a given, but it’s probably more likely than betting that they have a certain application installed (as in the
preceding section). ■
To create an e-mail hyperlink, either type the e-mail address directly into the text box on the
slide (for a bare hyperlink) or start a hyperlink normally with the Hyperlink button on the Insert
tab. Then click the E-mail Address button in the dialog box and ﬁll in the e-mail address and an
optional subject line. PowerPoint will automatically add mailto: in front of the address. Then
complete the hyperlink normally. See Figure 21-8.
FIGURE 21-8
You can use a hyperlink to send e-mail.
Editing or Removing Hyperlink
If you need to change the displayed text for the hyperlink, simply edit it just as you do any text
on a slide. Move the insertion point into it and press Backspace or Delete to remove characters,
and then retype new ones.
If you need to change the address, or the ScreenTip, right-click the hyperlink and choose Edit
Hyperlink. The Edit Hyperlink dialog box appears, which is identical to the Add Hyperlink dia-
log box except for the name. From there you can change any properties of the link, just like you
did when you created it initially.
To remove a hyperlink, you can either delete the text completely (select it and press Delete), or
just remove the hyperlink leaving the text intact. To do the latter, right-click the hyperlink and
choose Remove Hyperlink.

Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
Creating Graphical Hyperlinks
There are two ways to create a graphics-based hyperlink. Both involve skills that you have
already learned in this chapter. Both work equally well, but you may ﬁnd that you prefer one
to the other. The Action Settings method is a little bit simpler, but the Insert Hyperlink method
allows you to browse for Web addresses more easily.
Creating a Graphical Hyperlink with Action Settings
A graphics-based hyperlink is really no more than a graphic with an action setting attached to it.
You set it up just as you do with the action buttons (which you will learn more about later in
this chapter).
1.
Place the graphic that you want to use for a hyperlink.
2.
Click the graphic and then on the Insert tab, click Action. The Action Settings dialog
box opens.
3.
Choose Hyperlink To.
4.
Open the Hyperlink To drop-down list and choose URL. The Hyperlink to URL dialog
box opens.
5.
Type the URL to link to and click OK as shown in Figure 21-9.
FIGURE 21-9
You can create a hyperlink via an action setting.
590

Chapter 21: Designing User-Interactive or Self-Running Presentations
Caution
If you are using an e-mail address, type mailto: in front of the address you enter in step 5. If you do not,
PowerPoint will automatically add http:// in front of it and the link will not work. ■
6.
Click OK.
Now the graphic functions just like an action button in the presentation; the audience can click
it to jump to the speciﬁed location.
Creating a Graphical Hyperlink with Insert Hyperlink
If you would like to take advantage of the superior address-browsing capabilities of the Insert
Hyperlink dialog box when setting up a graphical hyperlink, follow these steps instead of the
preceding ones:
1.
Place the graphic that you want to use for a hyperlink.
2.
Right-click it and choose Hyperlink, or choose Insert ➪Hyperlink from the Ribbon. The
Insert Hyperlink dialog box appears.
3.
Choose the location, as you learned earlier in this chapter for text-based hyperlinks. The
only difference is that the Text to Display box is unavailable because there is no text. If
you typed the text in a graphic, Text to Display is available.
4.
Click OK.
Using Action Buttons
Action buttons, which you saw in Figure 21-1, enable your audience members to move from
slide to slide in the presentation with a minimum of fuss. PowerPoint provides many preset
action buttons that already have hyperlinks assigned to them, so all you have to do is place them
on your slides.
The action buttons that come with PowerPoint are shown in Table 21-2, along with their pre-
set hyperlinks. As you can see, some of them are all ready to go; others require you to specify
to where they jump. Most of the buttons have a default action assigned to them, but you can
change any of these as needed.
Tip
At ﬁrst glance, there seems little reason to use action buttons that simply move the slide show forward and
backward. After all, isn’t it just as easy to use the keyboard’s Page Up and Page Down keys, or to click the
left mouse button to advance to the next slide? Well, yes, but if you use Kiosk mode, described later in the
chapter, you cannot move from slide to slide using any of the conventional keyboard or mouse methods.
The only thing the mouse can do is click on action buttons and hyperlinks. ■

Return
Last slide viewed, regardless of normal order. This is useful to place
on a hidden slide that the audience will jump to with another link
(such as Help), to help them return to the main presentation when
they are ﬁnished.
Movie
Nothing, by default, but you can set it to play a movie that you
specify.

Nothing, by default, but you can set it to open a ﬁle that you specify.
Sound
Plays a sound that you specify. If you don’t choose a sound, it plays
the ﬁrst sound on PowerPoint’s list of standard sounds (Applause).
Help
Nothing, by default, but you can point it toward a slide containing
help or a Help ﬁle from an application (usually has a .hlp extension
but could also have a .chm or .html extension).
None
Nothing, by default. You can add text or ﬁlls to the button to create
custom buttons.
Placing an Action Button on a Slide
To place an action button, follow these steps:
1.
If you want to place the button on the Slide Master, display it (on the View tab, click Slide
Master). If you want to place the button on all layouts, click the top slide (the slide master
itself). If you want only a certain layout to receive the buttons, click it.
592

Chapter 21: Designing User-Interactive or Self-Running Presentations
Tip
Some action buttons are best placed on the Slide Master, such as Next and Previous; others, such as Return, are
special-use buttons that are best placed on individual slides such as hidden slides. ■
2.
On the Insert or Home tab, click Shapes. A palette of shapes appears; at the bottom of the
palette are the action buttons, as shown in Figure 21-10.
FIGURE 21-10
Action buttons are shapes, inserted from the Shapes palette.

Click the button that you want to place. Your mouse pointer turns into a crosshair.
4.
To create a button of a speciﬁc size, drag on the slide (or Slide Master) where you want it
to go. Or, to create a button of a default size, simply click once where you want to place
it. You can resize the button at any time later, the same as you can any object.
593

Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
Tip
If you want to place several buttons, and you want them all to be the same size, place them at the default
size to begin with. Then select them all, and resize them as a group. That way they will all be exactly the
same size. ■
5.
The Action Settings dialog box appears. Make sure the Mouse Click tab is on top, as
shown in Figure 21-11.
6.
Conﬁrm or change the hyperlink set up there:
 If the action button should take the reader to a speciﬁc location, make sure the correct
slide appears in the Hyperlink To box. Refer to Table 21-2 to see the default setting for
each action button. Table 21-3 lists the choices you can make and what they do.
 If the action button should run a program, choose Run program and enter the pro-
gram’s name and path, or click Browse to locate it. For example, you could open the
Calculator application from an action button. The executable ﬁle that runs it is calc.exe.
 If the action button should play a sound, make sure the Play Sound check box is
marked, and choose the correct sound from the Play Sound drop-down list (or pick a
different sound ﬁle by choosing Other Sound).
FIGURE 21-11
Specify what should happen when you click the action button.
7.
Click OK. The button has been assigned the action you speciﬁed.
8.
Add more action buttons as desired by repeating these steps.
9.
If you are working in Slide Master view, exit it by clicking the Close Master View button.
10.
Test your action buttons in Slide Show view to make sure they jump where you want
them to.
To edit a button’s action, right-click it and choose Hyperlink to reopen this dialog box at
any time.

dialog box instead of Hyperlink To.)
Adding Text to a Blank Action Button
The blank action button you saw in Table 21-2 can be very useful. You can place several of them
on a slide and type text into them, creating your own set of buttons. To type text into a blank
button, follow these steps:
1.
Place a blank action button on the slide (from the Shapes gallery).
2.
Right-click the action button and choose Edit Text. An insertion point appears in it.
(You can also select the button and simply start typing.)
3.
Type your text, and then click away from the button when you are ﬁnished. If you need
to edit the text later, simply click the text to move the insertion point back into it, just as
you do with any text box.
595

Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
Formatting and Changing the Shape
of an Action Button
You can format action buttons just like other shapes, as you learned to do in Chapter 10. You
can apply borders, ﬁlls and effects to them, and apply Shape Style presets. You can also use
WordArt styles or individual text formatting controls to format the text on them.
To make action buttons of different shapes, you can use the Change Shape button, as in the fol-
lowing steps:
1.
Select the action button(s) to change.
2.
On the Drawing Tools Format tab, click Edit Shape ➪Change Shape.
3.
Click a different shape.
Figure 21-12 shows some examples of custom buttons you can create with your own text and
some shape formatting.
FIGURE 21-12
You can create any of these sets of action buttons by typing and formatting text on blank buttons.
Creating Your Own Action Buttons
You can create an action button out of any object on your slide: a drawn shape, a piece of clip
art, a photograph, a text box — anything. To do so, just from the Insert tab click Action. Then,
set the On Click action to Hyperlink To, Run Program, or Play Sound, just as you did for the
action buttons in the preceding sections.
Make sure you clearly label the object that you are using as an action button so that the users
will know what they are getting when they click it. You can add text to the object directly
(for example, with an AutoShape), or you can add a text box next to the button that explains
its function. If you want to use a ScreenTip to label the item, use a hyperlink rather than an
action setting.
596

Chapter 21: Designing User-Interactive or Self-Running Presentations
Creating Self-Running Presentations
Self-running presentations are not exactly user-interactive because the user does not partici-
pate in their running. The show runs at its own pace and the user sits (or stands) passively and
observes it.
Not sure when you might use a self-running presentation in your daily life? Here are some ideas:
 Trade shows: A self-running presentation outlining your product or service can run
continuously in your booth on equipment as simple as a laptop and an external monitor.
People who might not feel comfortable talking to a salesperson may stop a few moments
to watch a colorful, multimedia slide show.
 Conventions: Trying to provide hundreds of convention-goers with some basic informa-
tion, such as session starting times or cocktail party locations? Set up an information booth
in the convention center lobby to provide this information. The slide show can loop end-
lessly through three or four slides that contain meeting room locations, schedules, and
other critical data.
 In-store sales: Retail stores can increase sales by strategically placing PC monitors in areas
of the store where customers gather. For example, if there is a line where customers stand
waiting for the next available register or clerk, you can show those waiting customers a few
slides that describe the beneﬁts of extended warranties or that detail the special sales of
the week.
 Waiting areas: Auto repair shops and other places where customers wait for something
to be done provide excellent sales opportunities. The customers don’t have anything to do
except sit and wait, so they will watch just about anything — including a slide presentation
informing them of the other services that your shop provides.
The most important aspect of a self-running show is that it loops continuously until you stop it.
This is important because there won’t be anyone there to restart it each time it ends.
To set up the show to do just that, follow these steps:
1.
On the Slide Show tab, click Set Up Slide Show. The Set Up Show dialog box opens.
2.
Mark the Loop Continuously Until ‘Esc’ check box. See Figure 21-13. Notice that the
Loop Continuously until Esc check box is set permanently to On whenever Browsed at
a Kiosk is selected.
3.
In the Advance Slides area, make sure the Using Timings, if Present option is selected.
4.
Click OK.
597

Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
FIGURE 21-13
Tell PowerPoint that this show should loop continuously.
Cross-Reference
Timings refers to transition timings, which you learned about in Chapter 18, in the section ‘‘Assigning Tran-
sitions to Slides.’’ Self-running presentations are good candidates for recorded voice-over narration, which
you learned how to set up in Chapter 16. ■
Recording Narration and Timings
When creating a self-running presentation, you may want to record some voice-over narration
to accompany all or some of the slides. That way when people watch the presentation, they will
hear your voice, as if they had been watching and listening to you in person.
To record narration, you will need a microphone that attaches to your computer, and your com-
puter must have a microphone jack to plug it into.
In PowerPoint 2010 you can record not only narration, but also animation and transition timings
and laser pointer movements. Together all these recorded extras make the presentation ﬁle you
distribute imitate more closely a live show.
Note
The Laser Pointer option is also new in PowerPoint 2010. To use it during Slide Show view, hold down
the Ctrl key and click the mouse. To change the pointer’s color, choose Slide Show ➪Set Up Show (see
Figure 21-13) and select a color from the Laser Pointer drop-down palette. ■
598

Chapter 21: Designing User-Interactive or Self-Running Presentations
Setting Up the Microphone
The ﬁrst time you record narration, you will probably need to conﬁgure your microphone to
make sure the volume level is set appropriately. The exact steps depend on the Windows version
you have; this book provides the step for Windows 7.
First, make sure the microphone is enabled. To do that:
1.
Choose Start ➪Control Panel.
2.
Click Hardware and Sound.
3.
Click Manage Audio Devices. The Sound dialog box opens.
4.
Click the Recording tab. A list of available microphones appears here. (You might have
only one.) See Figure 21-14.
FIGURE 21-14
Select the microphone you want to use, and make it the default device.
Note
If you don’t see Hardware and Sound as a category in the Control Panel, you are probably not in Category
view. On the upper left part of the Control Panel window, click Category view. ■
599

Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
5.
If you have more than one microphone listed, make sure the one you want to use is set
as the Default Device. (Right-click it and choose Set as Default Device. If it is already the
default, that command doesn’t appear.)
6.
Select the microphone and then click Conﬁgure. The Speech Recognition section of the
Control Panel opens.
7.
Click Set Up Microphone. The Microphone Setup Wizard runs, as shown in Figure 21-15.
FIGURE 21-15
Work through the wizard to set up your microphone.
8.
Follow the prompts to complete your microphone setup. The exact steps depend on the
microphone type you chose (in Figure 21-15).
Recording the Presentation
When you record the presentation, you are recording several things at once: narration, transition
and animation timing, and laser pointer movements.
You can do all your recording in a single pass, but if you ﬂub the narration for a slide, keep
going and don’t start over, because you can go back and re-record the narration for a particular
slide later.
600

Chapter 21: Designing User-Interactive or Self-Running Presentations
Follow these steps to record the presentation:
1.
Plug the microphone into your Mic port on your computer, and test it to make sure it is
working.
2.
Choose Slide Show ➪Record Slide Show. (Click the top part of the button, not the arrow
beneath it.) The Record Slide Show dialog box appears. It contains two check boxes:
 Slide and animation timings
 Narrations and laser pointer
3.
Leave both check marks selected (to record all of those things) and click Start Recording
to begin the recording.
The presentation opens in Slide Show view, with a Rehearse Timings ﬂoating toolbar in
the upper-left corner, as shown in Figure 21-16.
FIGURE 21-16
Record both narration and timings in a single pass.
Repeat (use to re-
record current slide)
Pause Recording
4.
Speak into the microphone to narrate the ﬁrst slide. When you are ready to move to the
next slide, click the mouse.
If you make a mistake on a slide, you can click the Repeat button (see Figure 21-16) to
start that slide over. Alternatively, you can just go on to the next slide; you can re-record
the narration for individual slides later.
5.
Move slide-by-slide through the presentation until you have recorded all the narration.
When you reach the last slide, the presentation switches to Slide Sorter view. Under each
slide is information about what was recorded, as shown in Figure 21-17.
 Star indicates there is a transition or animation effect.
 Time shows the total amount of time that slide will remain onscreen.
 Speaker indicates that there is recorded narration for that slide.
Re-Recording Narration for Certain Slides
It’s very hard to get all the narration recorded correctly in a single try! Most people have to go
back and re-record the narration for at least one slide. To re-record narration for only part of the
presentation, follow these steps:
1.
In Normal view, select the slide you want to re-record.
2.
Choose Slide Show ➪Record Slide Show ➪Start Recording from Current Slide.
601

Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
3.
Click Start Recording.
4.
Record the narration for that slide.
5.
Continue on to other slides by clicking through the presentation normally, or press Esc to
abort recording other slides.
FIGURE 21-17
Recorded data appears below each slide.

Removing Narration
You can remove the narration either from individual slides or from the entire presentation:
 To remove narration from a single slide, select it and then choose Slide Show ➪Record
Slide Show ➪Clear ➪Clear Narration on Current Slide.
 To remove narration from all slides, choose Slide Show ➪Record Slide Show ➪Clear ➪
Clear Narrations on All Slides.
You can also delete the speaker icon from the lower-right corner of a slide to remove
its narration.
Using Kiosk Mode
A kiosk is a self-serve booth or workstation where people can view something without supervi-
sion. You have probably seen information kiosks at malls, for example, where users can click or
touch buttons onscreen to get information.
When providing a computer to operate unattended to the public, one major concern is that some
prankster will come along and tamper with the system. You will learn about some ways to thwart
that kind of tampering in the next section, ‘‘Setting Up a Secure System,’’ but ﬁrst let’s look at
one really basic thing you can do: Enable Kiosk mode.
602

Chapter 21: Designing User-Interactive or Self-Running Presentations
When Kiosk mode is enabled, keyboard navigation is not possible (except for pressing Esc to
exit Slide Show view), so users must employ the action buttons and hyperlinks on the slides for
navigation. If you place a presentation in Kiosk mode and then hide the keyboard, users will
only be able to view the content to which you have linked.
To enable Kiosk mode, follow these steps:
1.
On the Slide Show tab, click Set Up Slide Show. The Set Up Show dialog box opens
(see Figure 21-18).
2.
In the Show Type area, click Browsed at a Kiosk (Full Screen).
3.
Click OK.
FIGURE 21-18
Set up the slide show for Kiosk mode.
Setting Up a Secure System
Security is a deﬁnite concern in self-running presentations. Any time you leave a computer
unattended with the public, you run the risk of tampering and theft. At the very least, some
guru geek will come along and experiment with your PC to see what you’ve got and whether
he or she can do anything clever with it. At the worst, your entire computer setup could
disappear entirely.
There are two levels of security involved in unattended presentation situations:
 The security of the physical hardware
 The security that the presentation will continue to run
603

Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
Securing Your Hardware
For the most foolproof hardware security, get it out of sight. Hide everything except the monitor
in a locked drawer, cabinet, or panel of the kiosk you are using, if possible. If you are at a trade
show or convention where you don’t have the luxury of a lockable system, at least put everything
except the monitor under a table, and try to make sure that someone is attending the booth at
all times.
Caution
Don’t drape running computers with cloth or any other material that inhibits the airﬂow around them;
doing so increases the risk of overheating. ■
In an unattended setting, the best way to protect your monitor from walking off is to place it
behind a Plexiglas panel where nobody can touch it. Without such a barrier, you run the risk of
some jokester turning off its power or turning down its contrast, and anyone who knows some-
thing about computers could walk right up and disconnect it and carry it away.
You can also buy various locking cables at computer stores and ofﬁce supply centers. These
cables lock down computer equipment to prevent it from being removed. They include
steel cables with padlocks, metal locking brackets, and electronically controlled magnetic locks.
Making Sure the Presentation Continues to Run
I admit that I am guilty of disrupting other people’s presentations. When I walk up to an unat-
tended computer in a store, the ﬁrst thing I do is abort whatever program is running and restart
the system to check out its diagnostics and ﬁnd out what kind of computer it is. It’s a geek
thing, but all geeks do it.
You will doubtless encounter such geeks wherever you set up your presentation, but especially
at trade shows and conventions. (We geeks love trade shows and conventions.) Your mission is
to prevent them from stopping your presentation.
The best way to prevent someone from tinkering with your presentation is to get the input
devices out of sight. Hide the CPU (the main box of the computer), the keyboard, and the
mouse. If the PC uses USB for keyboard and mouse, you can safely disconnect them while
the computer is running; with older-style keyboard and mouse connectors, you can’t, because
an error message appears when you do so that interferes with the show. If you must keep the
keyboard or mouse connected, don’t cover them with anything that might restrict the airﬂow, or
you might end up with an overheated PC. You can also set up the following security measures
in your presentation ﬁle:
 On the Slide Show tab, click Set Up Slide Show and make sure you have chosen Browsed
at a Kiosk. This disables the ability to advance the presentation on mouse click while the
slide show is running. The only way to stop the show will be to use the keyboard. This
works best for self-running shows where the slides advance automatically.
604

Chapter 21: Designing User-Interactive or Self-Running Presentations
Tip
If you make the keyboard available for user navigation, the Esc key will also be available for stopping the
program. A utility is available that disables the Esc key at www.mvps.org/skp/noesc.htm. ■
 Show the presentation using the PowerPoint Viewer program rather than PowerPoint itself.
That way nobody can access PowerPoint and create a new presentation to show. For fur-
ther security, remove the PowerPoint application completely from the PC on which the
presentation is showing. The PowerPoint Viewer does not come with PowerPoint 2010,
but can be downloaded for free. Go to http://office.microsoft.com and search
for PowerPoint 2007 Viewer. (A 2010 version of the Viewer is in development, and may
already be released by the time you read this.)
 Set a startup password for your PC so that if people manage to reboot it, they won’t get into
your PC to tamper with its settings. This is usually set through the BIOS setup program. If
you can’t do that, set a Windows startup password for each of the user accounts. (Do that
through the User Accounts in the Control Panel in Windows.)
 Assign a password to a PowerPoint ﬁle, as you learned in Chapter 3, to prevent it from
being opened, modiﬁed, or both. Although this will not prevent a running presentation
from being stopped, it will at least prevent it from being altered or deleted. However, if it
is already open, hackers will have full access to it, and if you set it to have a password only
for modiﬁcations, a hacker could save it under a different name, make changes, and then
run the changed version.
Summary
In this chapter, you learned the ins and outs of preparing a presentation that users can run
interactively or that can run unattended without user interaction. You learned how to create
action buttons, and how to set up kiosk mode and to create a secure presentation system that
can be left unattended. You can probably think of some uses for such shows, and even more
may occur to you later. In the next chapter, you learn how to prepare a presentation — either a
user-interactive one or a self-running one — for mass distribution on CD or over the Web.

W
hen preparing a presentation that you will send out into the
world, whether through e-mail, on CD, or on the Web, you
never know what will happen to it or how people will end up
viewing or even changing it. This can be a little unnerving!
In this chapter, you will learn how to protect your privacy by removing per-
sonal information from a PowerPoint ﬁle. You will also learn how to ensure
that the presentation contains nothing that will be incompatible with an
earlier version of PowerPoint. You will also learn how to distribute a pre-
sentation on CD or DVD, or as a video clip on a Web page or attached to an
e-mail message.
Working with File Properties
The properties of a ﬁle include ﬁxed attributes such as its creation date and
size, as well as properties that you can edit, such as the author name, key-
words, subject, and comments. Some of these variable properties are also
referred to as metadata — literally, data about data.
PowerPoint automatically saves some properties for you, such as the author
name, and provides opportunities for you to save additional properties.
Properties can be helpful when you are searching for a certain ﬁle or
maintaining a presentation library, as discussed in Chapter 23. However,
when you are distributing a presentation widely, you might prefer to remove
some or all of its properties to preserve your privacy.

To add or change a ﬁle’s properties, open the File menu. On the right side
of the Info tab, click Properties. On the menu that appears, choose Show
Document Panel.
607

Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
You can then add, delete, or change the properties in the Document Properties, as shown in
Figure 22-1. To close the Document Panel, click the X in its upper-right corner.
FIGURE 22-1
Use the Document Properties to assign or change document metadata.
The properties that you can ﬁnd in the Document Properties include:
 Author: Filled in automatically from the username that you speciﬁed when you installed
Ofﬁce.
 Title: By default, the title is the ﬁrst line of the document.
 Subject, Keywords, Category, and Status: By default, these ﬁelds are empty, but you
can specify your own information and settings.
Note
The author’s name is automatically added to each ﬁle that you create in PowerPoint, based on the username
that you speciﬁed when you installed Ofﬁce. To change this name, choose File ➪Options, click General,
and then change the entry in the User Name text box. ■
You can also display a Properties dialog box for the ﬁle, in which you can set advanced proper-
ties. To do this, click the down arrow next to Document Properties on the Document Properties
panel (Figure 22-1), and on the menu that opens, click Advanced Properties. Alternatively, you
can open the File menu again, and once again click Properties on the right side of the Info tab.
On the menu that appears, choose Show Advanced Properties.
The Properties dialog box is the same dialog box that you would see if you right-clicked the ﬁle
and then clicked Properties from outside of PowerPoint (that is, from Windows Explorer or any
ﬁle management window). This dialog box contains the following tabs:
 General: Uneditable data about the ﬁle, such as its type, location, size, and operating sys-
tem attributes — for example, read-only and hidden.
 Summary: A continuation of the Document Properties window, with additional properties
that you can specify or change, as shown in Figure 22-2.
 Statistics: Another page of uneditable data, this one relating to statistical analysis of the
presentation, such as number of slides, number of words, number of revisions, and total
editing time.
 Contents: Still more uneditable data. This data includes the fonts that are used, the theme,
and the titles of the slides.
 Custom: A tab where you can set some of the less-common properties for the ﬁle.
608

Chapter 22: Preparing a Presentation for Mass Distribution
FIGURE 22-2
The Summary tab of the Properties dialog box contains additional property ﬁelds.
You can deﬁne custom properties in the Custom tab. Custom properties are special-purpose
ﬁelds that you can add when you need them. To set a custom property, follow these steps:
1.
In the Custom tab, click the property from the Name list that you want to use.
2.
Open the Type drop-down list and select the type of data that it should hold. The default
is Text, which accepts any input.
3.
In the Value ﬁeld, type the desired value for this property.
4.
Click Add to add the property, type, and value to the Properties list, as shown in
Figure 22-3.
5.
Repeat steps 1 to 4 to add more custom properties, if needed; then click OK.
Removing Personal Information from a File
Before you distribute a PowerPoint ﬁle, you might want to remove some of the properties from
it that contain sensitive information. For example, if you have entered conﬁdential information
about a client in the Comments property, then you may not want the client or others to see it.
If you can remember all of the properties that you set for the ﬁle, then you can go back in and
remove them manually, as you learned in the preceding section. However, it is much easier to
use the Document Inspector feature in PowerPoint to remove personal information from the ﬁle.
Follow these steps:
1.
Choose File ➪Check for Issues ➪Inspect Document. The Document Inspector dialog
box opens, as shown in Figure 22-4.
609

FIGURE 22-3
Set a custom property in the Custom tab.
FIGURE 22-4
Inspect the presentation for information that you might want to remove.
610

Chapter 22: Preparing a Presentation for Mass Distribution
2.
Select or deselect the check boxes for the various types of information that you want to
look for. The personal information contained in properties falls under the Document
Properties and Personal Information category.
3.
Click Inspect.
4.
Review the inspection results. Categories in which items have been found display their
ﬁndings; categories in which no items have been found appear with check marks, as
shown in Figure 22-5.
FIGURE 22-5
View the inspection results.
5.
For each category that you want to clear, click Remove All.
6.
When you are ﬁnished, click Reinspect to check the document again, or click Close to end
the process.
Caution
Be careful that you don’t remove hidden objects you want to keep, or strip all the speaker notes out of a
presentation unintentionally. One way to ensure that you don’t do this is to perform the inspection on a
copy of the presentation, not the original. ■
611

Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
Checking for Compatibility and Usability
Before you send your presentation off to a remote audience, think about what their needs might
be. Do they have an earlier version of PowerPoint than you do? Do some of them have disabil-
ities that might make it difﬁcult for them to view your presentation? In the following sections,
you’ll learn about some features that can help you make your presentation more accessible to a
wider audience without very much extra work on your part.
Assessing Prior-Version Compatibility
If you plan to share your presentation with people who have earlier versions of PowerPoint,
you need to send it to them in a format that they can display and edit. The ‘‘display’’ part is
actually easier than the ‘‘edit’’ part because, generally speaking, when you convert a PowerPoint
2007/2010 ﬁle to 2003 format, it retains most of its original appearance, from a Slide Show View
perspective. However, editing some of the content in the presentation is a different matter. When
a 2007/2010-only object, such as a SmartArt diagram or chart, is saved in 97–2003 format,
PowerPoint converts it to a graphic. It looks the same as it always did, but you cannot edit the
object in an earlier version as the type of content that it actually is.
If you plan to share a presentation ﬁle with someone who will need to edit it, it is a good idea
to run the Compatibility Checker to ﬁnd out exactly which parts of the presentation may cause a
problem. To run the Compatibility Checker, follow these steps:
1.
Choose File ➪Check for Issues ➪Check Compatibility. The Microsoft PowerPoint
Compatibility Checker dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 22-6.
FIGURE 22-6
Find out about potential problems that may occur when sharing the ﬁle in 97–2003 format.
2.
Read the summary information that appears. If you do not understand one of the mes-
sages, click its Help link to open a Help document that explains it.
612

Chapter 22: Preparing a Presentation for Mass Distribution
3.
(Optional) To specify whether this check runs automatically when you save in
PowerPoint 97–2003 format, select or deselect the Check Compatibility When Saving
in PowerPoint 97–2003 Formats check box.
4.
Click OK.
Note
Embedded video in a presentation will play in PowerPoint 2007, even though 2007 does not support
inserting and modifying embedded video. Embedded video will not play in PowerPoint 2003. If you save
a presentation containing embedded video in PowerPoint 97–2003 format, the video clips are saved
as pictures. ■
Checking Accessibility
Accessibility refers to the ease with which someone with a disability is able to navigate and use
your data ﬁles. For example, if someone has a visual impairment, how easy will it be for them to
read your fonts? If someone cannot hear, will they miss out on important points in your presen-
tation that are audio only?
To check accessibility, follow these steps:
1.
Choose File ➪Check for Issues ➪Check Accessibility. The Accessibility Checker pane
appears, as shown in Figure 22-7.
FIGURE 22-7
Find out about potential problems that may occur when people
with disabilities view your presentation.

613

Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
2.
Click one of the problems found, and view the suggestion at the bottom of the pane.
Implement the suggestion if desired by following its steps.
3.
Repeat step 2 for each problem found.
Compressing Media
A presentation that contains large video and sound ﬁles can take up a lot of disk space. If you
have plenty of room on the disk you will be using to transport the presentation — great. But if
you will be distributing the presentation in a situation where size is limited, such as via e-mail
attachment, you might want to consider compressing the media.
Compressing media decreases its quality so that it takes up less space. Sounds may sound less
crisp, and videos may lose sharpness in both picture and sound. It’s a trade-off, therefore,
between size and quality. Each situation will be different in determining what the appropriate
balance is.
To compress media, follow these steps:
1.
Choose File ➪Compress Media. (If that command doesn’t appear on the Info tab, you
don’t have any compressible media in your presentation.)
2.
Choose a quality level: Presentation Quality, Internet Quality, or Low Quality. See
Figure 22-8.
FIGURE 22-8
Choose a quality level appropriate for the distribution method you will use.
614

Chapter 22: Preparing a Presentation for Mass Distribution
3.
A Compress Media dialog box appears showing the compression progress. Wait until the
process is complete.
4.
Click Close.
Limiting User Access to a Presentation
There are many ways of locking down a presentation, either partially or totally, so that others are
limited in what they can do with it. The following sections explain some of those methods.
Finalizing a Presentation
When the presentation is completely ﬁnished, you may want to mark it as ﬁnalized.
Finalizing a presentation doesn’t provide any ‘‘security,’’ per se, because it is easy to override.
However, it prevents users from inadvertently making additional changes to it, and so it gives
you some measure of protection against unexpected modiﬁcations that can distort your mes-
sage. It can also serve as a warning; if a ﬁnalized presentation has been changed, you can tell by
checking to see if its Finalized status is still enabled.
To mark a presentation as ﬁnal, follow these steps:
1.
Choose File ➪Protect Presentation ➪Mark as Final. A message appears that the presenta-
tion will be marked as ﬁnal and then saved.
2.
Click OK. A message appears, explaining that the presentation has been marked as ﬁnal,
and that editing has been turned off for it, as shown in Figure 22-9.
FIGURE 22-9
This message appears after you mark a document as ﬁnal.
615

Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
When you mark a document as ﬁnal, an icon appears in the status bar to indicate that it is ﬁnal,
and the presentation becomes uneditable. If you change your mind about the presentation and
need to edit it, you can easily turn off this attribute and edit it again. Just choose File ➪Protect
Presentation ➪Mark as Final again to toggle off the Finalized status.
Encrypting a File with a Password
You can prevent unauthorized access to a PowerPoint ﬁle by assigning a password to it. Without
the password, nobody can open the ﬁle. To assign a password, follow these steps:
1.
Choose File ➪Protect Presentation ➪Encrypt with Password. The Encrypt Document
dialog box opens.
2.
Type a password in the Password text box and click OK.
3.
A Conﬁrm Password dialog box appears. Retype the same password that you typed in
step 2 and click OK.
When anyone attempts to open the ﬁle in the future, a password prompt will appear. They must
enter the password and click OK to continue.
To remove a password, returning the document to its original unencrypted status, follow these
steps:
1.
Choose File ➪Protect Presentation ➪Encrypt Document. The Encrypt Document dialog
box opens.
2.
Delete the contents of the Password text box.
3.
Click OK.
Caution
Notice that you do not have to know the password to remove it, if the ﬁle is already open. Do not
leave encrypted presentations open on your computer when you step away from your desk if security is
an issue. ■
Restricting Permissions
In addition to denying access outright, you can also restrict the permissions for a presentation,
so that people may view it without being able to perform actions such as editing or printing.
Setting Up Information Rights Management
Using the Restrict Permission feature requires sign-up for the Information Rights Management
(IRM) program, from Microsoft. This is a free program, but you have to provide some personal
data. The ﬁrst time you use the feature, you will be prompted through the sign-up process, as in
Figure 22-10. You will need to sign up for a Windows Live ID if you do not already have one.
616

Chapter 22: Preparing a Presentation for Mass Distribution
FIGURE 22-10
This screen appears if you have not yet set up IRM on your PC.
Restricting Access to the Presentation
To begin restricting access to the presentation, follow these steps:
1.
Choose File ➪Protect Presentation ➪Restrict Permission by People ➪Restricted Access.
The Select User dialog box appears.
2.
Select your name and click OK. (It appears there because you previously conﬁgured your
computer for IRM, as in the preceding section.) The Permission dialog box opens.
3.
Mark the Restrict Permission to this Presentation check box.
4.
Enter speciﬁc people’s e-mail addresses (the addresses associated with their Windows
Live IDs) into the Read and/or Change boxes. People in the Read box will be able to read
but not edit the presentation; people in the Change box will have editing privileges. See
Figure 22-11.
5.
Click More Options. A different version of the Permission dialog box opens, as shown in
Figure 22-12.
6.
Select a user from the list, and then mark or clear check boxes for speciﬁc permissions he
or she should have. Repeat for each user.

Chapter 22: Preparing a Presentation for Mass Distribution
7.
Click OK.
Caution: You may want to keep an unrestricted copy of your presentation, in case some-
thing happens to Microsoft’s IRM servers.
Removing Restrictions
To remove restrictions on access, do the following:
1.
Choose File ➪Protect Presentation ➪Restrict Permission by People ➪Unrestricted
Access.
2.
A conﬁrmation box appears. Click Yes.
Publishing a Presentation on a CD or DVD
Often the computer that you use to create a presentation is not the same one that you use to
show it, especially if it is a desktop computer. This is an issue whether you are showing the
presentation ‘‘live,’’ distributing it as a self-running presentation through e-mail or the Web, or
creating a kiosk. As a result, the issue of transferring ﬁles from one computer to another is a
very common concern.
One way to transfer a PowerPoint presentation to another computer is simply to copy the
PowerPoint ﬁle using a ﬂash drive, writeable CD or DVD, network, or other medium. However,
this method is imperfect because it assumes that the other computer has PowerPoint (or the
PowerPoint Viewer), as well as all of the necessary fonts, sounds, graphics, videos (if any are
linked), music ﬁles, and other elements that are needed for every part of the show. This can be
a dangerous assumption.
A better way to transfer the presentation is to use the Package for CD feature in PowerPoint.
This feature reads all of the linked ﬁles and associated objects, and ensures that they are trans-
ferred along with the main presentation. You can create a CD or DVD that you can then copy
and mass-distribute to a wide audience, or you can send the package to any folder on any drive
and then compress, or ZIP, the folder and send it to others through e-mail.
Note
Zipping consists of creating a compressed archive ﬁle with a .zip extension. You do this by selecting ﬁles in
Windows Explorer, right-clicking the selection, and choosing Send To ➪Compressed (zipped) Folder. ■
Caution
Packaged versions of presentations do not include comments, revisions, or ink annotations. If you want a
version that includes these items, then you need to manually copy the ﬁles to the CD or DVD. ■
If you have a CD or DVD drive that writes to blank discs, copying the presentation to a CD or
DVD is an attractive choice. This produces a self-running disc that contains the presentation ﬁle,
619

Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
any linked ﬁles that you need for the show, and an HML ﬁle that provides a link to download
the PowerPoint Viewer if needed.
You can copy many presentation ﬁles to a single CD or DVD, not just the currently active pre-
sentation. The only limit is the capacity of the disc. An easy-to-use HTML menu page enables
users to choose which presentation to view.
Note
The CDs and DVDs referred to in this section contain data ﬁles, not the type of DVD movies you could put
in a DVD player hooked up to your TV. See the section ‘‘Creating a Presentation DVD’’ later in this chapter
if you want a disc that will play on a home theater system. ■
To package the presentation on a CD or DVD — assuming that you have a CD or DVD drive
that writes — follow these steps:
1.
Place a blank disc in your writeable CD or DVD drive.
2.
Open the presentation in PowerPoint to review it and make sure that it is exactly the way
you want it. CD-R, DVD+R, and DVD-R discs are not rewriteable, and so if you make
a mistake, you will have wasted a disc. For this reason, it is often better to package to a
folder and then burn these ﬁles to a CD after testing.
3.
Choose File ➪Save & Send ➪Package Presentation for CD ➪Package for CD. The
Package for CD dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 22-13.
FIGURE 22-13
You can use the Package for CD feature to place all of the necessary
ﬁles for the presentation on a CD, or in another location.
4.
Type a name for the CD; this name is similar to a volume label for the disc.
5.
(Optional) You can add more ﬁles to the disc layout. See the section ‘‘Including Multiple
Presentations’’ later in this chapter, for more details.
6.
(Optional) You can set other options, as shown in the section ‘‘Setting Copy Options’’ later
in this chapter.
620

Chapter 22: Preparing a Presentation for Mass Distribution
7.
Click Copy to CD.
8.
A message appears asking whether you want to package linked ﬁles. Click Yes.
9.
The CD drive writes the ﬁles to the CD or DVD. It may take several minutes, depending
on the size of the ﬁles, the speed of your computer, and the writing speed of the
CD drive.
10.
A message appears when the ﬁles are successfully written to the disc, asking whether you
want to copy the same ﬁles to another disc. Click Yes or No. If you choose No, then click
Close to close the Package for CD dialog box.
11.
Test your disc, as explained in the section ‘‘Using a Packaged CD’’ later in this chapter.
Copying to Other Locations
If you do not have a CD or DVD writer, then you cannot directly write to a CD as shown in the
preceding section. Instead, you need to package the presentation to a folder on a drive that can
be accessed by a computer with a CD or DVD burner. You can then create the CD using either a
third-party disc-burning program or the writing software in Windows.
Note
If you are burning a CD using a third-party application, you should include on that CD only the contents of
the folder in which you packaged the presentation, not the folder itself. ■
To change the package location from the CD to another location, in the Package for CD dia-
log box, click the Copy to Folder button. A Copy to Folder dialog box appears, as shown in
Figure 22-14. Type a name for the new folder to be created, and type a path for this folder in
the Location text box. When you click OK, PowerPoint automatically packages the presentation
to this location.
FIGURE 22-14
You can package the presentation ﬁles to another location.
Caution
When you use the Copy to Folder feature to specify a location, PowerPoint immediately copies the presen-
tation there; it does not wait for you to click OK in the Package for CD dialog box. Therefore, if you need
to add ﬁles or set options, as described in the following sections, you should do these things ﬁrst. ■
621

Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
Including Multiple Presentations
By default, PowerPoint includes the active presentation on the CD, but you can also add other
presentations, up to the capacity of the disc. For example, if you have several versions of the
same presentation for different audiences, you can place all of them on a single CD.
As you prepare to copy using the Package for CD dialog box, click the Add Files button. An Add
Files dialog box opens. Select the additional ﬁles that you want to include by holding down the
Ctrl key and selecting the ﬁles you want. Then click Open to return to the Package for CD dialog
box. The list of ﬁles appears, as shown in Figure 22-15, with extra controls.
FIGURE 22-15
You can select multiple presentations to include on the CD, and set the order in which they
should play.
The order in which the presentations are listed in the dialog box is the order that they will
appear on the HTML-based menu system that is created on the disc. Rearrange the list by click-
ing the up- or down-arrow buttons to the left of the list, and use the Remove button to remove
any ﬁles that you do not need. You can then continue packaging the presentation.
Setting Copy Options
From the Package for CD dialog box, you can click the Options button to display the Options
dialog box, as shown in Figure 22-16. This dialog box contains the following options:
 Support Files: In the Include These Files section of the dialog box, you can use the check
boxes to include linked ﬁles and/or embedded TrueType fonts. Linked ﬁles are any ﬁles,
such as sounds or movies, that are not embedded in the main presentation ﬁle. You would
generally want to include these ﬁles. Embedded TrueType fonts are font ﬁles that are
needed to display the presentation. If the computer on which the presentation will play
does not have the fonts that are used in the presentation, it will try to substitute fonts, and
the presentation may not look exactly the same. Embedding fonts usually takes up only a
little space and can save you the inconvenience of missing a font.
 Security and Privacy: You can assign passwords to open and modify the presentations.
To do this, you enter passwords in the Password to Open Each Presentation and Password
to Modify Each Presentation text boxes, as shown in Figure 22-16.
622

Chapter 22: Preparing a Presentation for Mass Distribution
FIGURE 22-16
You can set options for copying your presentations to disc.
Caution
These passwords apply to all presentations on the CD or DVD, and so you cannot set passwords individu-
ally through this interface. If you need individual passwords, you should use the File ➪Save As ➪Tools ➪
General command instead and specify passwords for each ﬁle. ■
Caution
Passwords can be stripped out of Ofﬁce 2007 and 2010 ﬁles by someone who knows how to modify the
XML code, so setting a password for a PowerPoint ﬁle does not provide strong protection. ■
Using a Packaged CD
When a user inserts your packaged CD or DVD in his computer, a PresentationPackage.html ﬁle
automatically opens in the default Web browser. This page contains a link to each presentation
on the CD, along with a button for downloading the PowerPoint Viewer. Users who do not have
PowerPoint installed and do not already have the Viewer will need this to see the presentations.
See Figure 22-17.
FIGURE 22-17

Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
Converting a Presentation to a Video File
New in PowerPoint 2010, you can now output your presentation to a Windows Media Video
(WMV) video clip. This clip will play in almost any digital video player software, such as Win-
dows Media Player, and can be distributed via e-mail, on disk, or on a Web site.
To save a presentation as a video, follow these steps:
1.
Be sure that you have ﬁnalized your presentation, including all text changes, animation,
and narration.
2.
Choose File ➪Save & Send ➪Create a Video. Options appear to conﬁgure the video set-
tings, as shown in Figure 22-18.
FIGURE 22-18
Choose the video clip dimensions and the timing between slides.
3.
Click Computer & HD Displays, opening a menu of sizes. Then click the one that is most
appropriate for your distribution method. (If you are going to distribute on computer,
leave it at the default setting.)
624

Chapter 22: Preparing a Presentation for Mass Distribution
4.
The default is to Use Recorded Timings and Narrations. If you leave that selected,
PowerPoint will use them for any slides that have them; for any slides that do not have
timing set to automatically advance them, the default timing will be used.
5.
In the Seconds to Spend on Each Slide box, enter the number of seconds to use for the
default timing.
6.
Click Create Video. The Save As dialog box opens.
7.
Type a name for the video clip in the File Name box.
8.
Click Save.
9.
Wait while the video is created. A progress bar shows on the status bar in PowerPoint.
The presentation will run and be recorded in real-time, so it takes as long to record as
the presentation would take to be shown. (You can’t watch it as it’s recording; it happens
behind-the-scenes.)
Making a Movie DVD of a Presentation
If you have access to Windows DVD Maker (which comes with some versions of Windows), you
can use it to turn your presentation video (made in the preceding section) into a DVD that peo-
ple with ordinary non-computer DVD players can watch on their TV sets. (People can watch
them on their computers too, if the computers have DVD movie players installed.)
Note
Windows DVD Maker is included in Windows Vista Home Premium, Windows Vista Ultimate and
in Windows 7 Home Premium, Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Enterprise, and Windows 7 Ultimate
editions. ■
The following are the steps for Windows DVD Maker. You can use any DVD creation software
you like, but you’ll need to consult the Help system in that program for the steps to take.
Here are the steps for Windows DVD Maker:
1.
Choose Start ➪All Programs ➪Windows DVD Maker.
2.
Click Choose Photos and Videos. (This step may not be necessary; it depends on whether
you have turned off the Welcome screen or not.)
3.
Click Add Items. The Add Items to DVD dialog box opens.
4.
Select the video you made of your PowerPoint presentation. (See the preceding section.)
5.
Click Add.
6.
Click Next.
7.
(Optional) Change any options as desired in the application.
8.
Click Burn, and follow the prompts to complete the process.
625

Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
Broadcasting a Slide Show
Presentation broadcasting enables you to show your presentation in real-time via a network. This
makes it possible for people to attend a live show who cannot be there in person. It uses the
PowerPoint Broadcast Service, a free service that Microsoft makes available to PowerPoint users.
You need a Windows Live ID, which is also free.
Before it’s time to broadcast your presentation ‘‘for real,’’ you will probably want to do a practice
run to make sure you understand the broadcasting feature.
Follow these steps:
1.
Choose File ➪Save & Send ➪Broadcast Slide Show ➪Broadcast Slide Show. The
Broadcast Slide Show dialog box opens.
2.
Click Start Broadcast. You are connected to the broadcast server. (You may be prompted
for your Windows Live ID; sign in if prompted.)
3.
A link appears for participants to use to see the broadcast; copy this link to the Clipboard
(click Copy Link, or select it and press Ctrl+C) and then paste it into an e-mail, instant
message, or other medium through which you want to share it with others. You can click
Send in E-Mail to automatically start a new e-mail containing the link.
4.
Click Start Slide Show. The show begins in Slide Show view on your PC.
5.
Show the presentation as you would normally. When you are ﬁnished, Normal view reap-
pears.
6.
Click End Broadcast in the information bar that appears at the top of the window. The
broadcast is terminated.
As you are broadcasting, a Broadcasting tab appears in Normal view. (You can return to Normal
view at any time to work with it.) There you’ll ﬁnd the following options:
 Resolution: You can choose the resolution at which to show the slides. You might want
a smaller resolution than the default if some people in the audience will be viewing on
low-resolution displays. 800 x 600 is a good choice in most cases.
 Show On: If you have more than one monitor, you can choose which one will show the
presentation on your local PC.
 Use Presenter View: If you have more than one monitor, you can choose to use Presenter
View on one of them by marking this check box.
 Send Invitations: Use this command to reopen the dialog box containing the link to the
presentation URL, in case you need to send it to anyone else.
Working with the PowerPoint Viewer
The PowerPoint Viewer is a utility that shows PowerPoint presentations but cannot edit them. It
is similar to being permanently in Slide Show view. If the computer on which you will show the
presentation does not have PowerPoint installed, you will need the PowerPoint Viewer to view
the presentation.
626

Chapter 22: Preparing a Presentation for Mass Distribution
Downloading the PowerPoint Viewer
When you package a presentation on CD, the resulting disc includes a PresentationPackage.html
page, which opens automatically when the disc is inserted. On this page is a link to download
the PowerPoint Viewer from the Microsoft Web site. Click the link and then follow the prompts.
You don’t have to do this on a PC that already has PowerPoint installed on it, but you may
want to anyway, just so you can understand the Viewer’s interface that you’ll be asking your
audience to use.
Playing a Presentation with the PowerPoint Viewer
When you insert a presentation CD on a system that has either PowerPoint or the PowerPoint
Viewer installed, all you have to do is select the presentation’s link on the CD’s navigation page;
it opens in whichever of those programs you have.
You can also manually start up the PowerPoint Viewer and then manually load a presentation
ﬁle. Here’s how to do that:
1.
Choose File ➪All Programs ➪Microsoft Ofﬁce PowerPoint Viewer 2007. (The ﬁrst time
you run it, you have to click Accept to accept the license agreement.) A Microsoft Ofﬁce
PowerPoint Viewer window opens, which is very much like the Open dialog box in
PowerPoint.
2.
Select the presentation you want to view. (Navigate to the CD if needed.)
3.
Click Open.
Summary
In this chapter, you learned how to prepare a presentation for mass distribution through
CD, e-mail, or the Internet, and how to prepare a presentation for these distribution methods
by removing personal information and setting properties. You also learned how to save a
presentation as a video or a self-running CD, and to make a movie DVD of the presentation.

I
n many organizations, creating an important presentation is a collabo-
rative project, with several people providing input on a draft. There are
several ways to share a draft presentation with others; you can post a
presentation to a server, distribute one via e-mail, or post a draft on a docu-
ment management server. You can also create a slide library on a SharePoint
server or on a shared drive (such as on your company’s network) and make
individual slides available for reuse.
In this chapter, you’ll learn how to use PowerPoint’s collaborative tools, such
as comments, and how to share and distribute presentations and individual
slides in a variety of ways.
Working with Comments
Comments are like sticky notes that you can attach to various spots in a
presentation, just as you would attach notes to a paper copy. With com-
ments, multiple reviewers can offer suggestions without changing the actual
presentation.
Adding Comments
As you review a presentation, you can insert comments pertaining to a slide
as a whole or to an individual object on that slide. To add a comment, fol-
low these steps:
1.
Display the slide on which you want to place the comment. If you
want to attach the comment to a speciﬁc object, select it.
2.
On the Review tab, click New Comment. A new comment appears. If
you did not choose a speciﬁc object in step 1, the comment is placed
in the top-left corner of the slide.
629

Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
3.
Type the comment into the box provided, as shown in Figure 23-1.
4.
Click away from the comment box to close it.
A small box with your initials and the comment number remain visible on the slide.
To view the comment at any time, click the box containing your initials. To edit the comment,
double-click that box, or click it once and then click Edit Comment on the Review tab.
FIGURE 23-1
Type a comment in the box.
Note
Comments are numbered in the order you add them to your presentation, not the slide order. If you add a
comment to a slide earlier in your presentation, the numbers for comments later in the presentation do not
change. Comments that you add to notes are considered to have been added to the slide itself. ■
The only places you can’t add comments are to the slide masters and layouts. If you want to
mark something up for a master or layout, you need to build a slide from that master or layout,
and then add the comment.
Printing Comments
To print comments, choose File ➪Print and then click Full Page Slides, which displays a menu.
At the bottom of that menu, make sure that the Print Comments and Ink Markup check box is
marked, as shown in Figure 23-2. The comments print on a separate page.
Reviewing and Deleting Comments
After everyone has had a chance to comment on a draft presentation, you will want to review
those comments, and probably delete some or all of them.
630

Chapter 23: Sharing and Collaborating
FIGURE 23-2
Make sure the Print Comments and Ink Markup option is selected to see the comments in print.
Tip
You do not have to delete the comments to hide them. Instead, you can click the Show Markup button on
the Review tab to toggle the comments on/off. Comments do not show in Slide Show view, though. ■
To move from one comment to the next in the presentation, use the Previous and Next but-
tons on the Review tab. The comments appear open (so that you can read them) but they are
uneditable. To edit a comment, double-click it.
To delete a comment, do any of the following:
 To delete an individual comment, select its box and press the Delete key or click Delete on
the Review tab.
 To delete all of the comments on the current slide, click the down arrow below the Delete
button on the Review tab and click Delete All Markup on the Current Slide.
 To delete all of the comments in the entire presentation, click the down arrow beneath the
Delete button and click Delete All Markup in This Presentation.
631

Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
Comparing and Merging Presentations
New in PowerPoint 2010, you can compare two versions of the same presentation and see the
differences between them marked as revisions. You can then accept or reject each revision. This
is very helpful when multiple people are making changes to separate copies of a presentation
and then someone has to go back through all the copies and merge all the changes into a single
cohesive copy.
To use this feature, ﬁrst ensure that you have two PowerPoint ﬁles that contain essentially the
same presentation (but with some changes made to one copy). Let’s call them presentation A
and presentation B for the sake of this discussion. Decide which one you want to be the original
and which one you want to be the revision. Open the original one in PowerPoint, and then do
the following:
1.
Choose Review ➪Compare. The Choose File to Merge with Current Presentation dialog
box opens.
2.
Select the other version of the presentation and click Merge. The Revisions pane opens,
and shows the ﬁrst change in the presentation, as shown in Figure 23-3.
FIGURE 23-3
See the revisions made to the current slide.
632

Chapter 23: Sharing and Collaborating
Each of the little icons on the slide in Figure 23-3 represents one of the changes listed in
the Revisions pane. You can point at one of those icons to see a pop-up explaining the
change.
Each change can be individually accepted. To accept a change, click it (in the Revisions pane)
and then choose Review ➪Accept (on the Ribbon). (Click the face of the Accept button, not the
arrow beneath it.)
The Reject button works only after a change has been accepted; To reject the change, accept it
and then choose Review ➪Reject.
To accept all the changes on the current slide, click the arrow under the Accept button to display
its menu, and then choose Accept All Changes to the Current Slide. You can do the same thing
with the Reject button to reject all changes to the current slide.
To accept all the changes to the entire presentation, click that same arrow and choose Accept All
Changes to the Presentation. Again, you can do the same thing with the Reject button to reject
all changes to the presentation.
Use the Previous and Next buttons on the Review tab to move between changes. When you are
ﬁnished, choose Review ➪End Review. Any unaccepted changes will be discarded, so do not
end the review until you are ﬁnished reviewing each change.
Sharing Your Presentation File on a LAN
If your PC is on a network, you can share a presentation ﬁle with others by placing it in a
location that other network users can access. You can save it to a centrally accessible network
drive, such as a ﬁle server, or you can make a folder on your own hard disk network-
accessible.
Saving to a Network Drive
To save to a network drive that others also have access to, navigate to that location in the Save
As dialog box. In Windows 7 or Windows Vista, start by choosing Network in the navigation
pane at the left; in Windows XP, use the My Network Places shortcut in the Places bar.
Sharing a Folder on the Network
You can also make your own hard disk’s folders available for others to access on your network.
The process of doing that depends on your Windows version, and if you have Windows 7, it
also depends on whether or not you are using a HomeGroup (a special type of peer-to-peer
workgroup speciﬁcally for Windows 7 computers). Consult the following section that matches
your Windows version and situation.
633

Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
Folder Sharing in Windows 7 with a Homegroup
A Homegroup is a small network for situations where there is no ﬁle server, like in a home. If all
the PCs in your network use Windows 7, you can use a Homegroup to share ﬁles, folders, and
printers.
If you have a Homegroup set up, follow these steps to share a folder on it:
1.
Open a Computer window and locate the folder you want to share.
2.
Right-click the folder and choose one of these (see Figure 23-4):
 Share With ➪Homegroup (Read)
 Share With ➪Homegroup (Read/Write) depending on whether you want others to be
able to change your ﬁles or not.
FIGURE 23-4
Share with the Homegroup.
Everyone in your Homegroup will have the same rights to the folder. If you want to specify that
only certain people have certain rights, see the following section.
Folder Sharing in Windows 7 without a Homegroup
If you don’t use a Homegroup, follow these steps in Windows 7 to share the folder with all other
users who have network access to your hard disk:
1.
Open a Computer window and locate the folder you want to share.
2.
Right-click the folder and choose Share With ➪Speciﬁc People. The File Sharing dialog
box opens, as shown in Figure 23-5.
634

Chapter 23: Sharing and Collaborating
FIGURE 23-5
Share the folder with everyone by adding the Everyone group to the sharing list.
3.
Do any of the following:
 To share with a particular user who has a user account and password, enter that user’s
name and click Add.
 To share with everyone, type Everyone and click Add, as shown in Figure 23-5.
4.
If you want to give the user(s) that you just added Read/Write access, click Read on the
row just added (for example, the Everyone row) and choose Read/Write from the menu
that appears. See Figure 23-6.
5.
Click Share.
6.
Click Done.
Folder Sharing in Windows Vista
If you have Windows Vista, the sharing process is similar to that of Windows 7 without a
Homegroup. Follow these steps:
1.
From any ﬁle management window, right-click the folder or drive to be shared and
choose Share.
2.
Do any of the following:
 To share with a particular user who has a user account and password, enter that user’s
name and click Add.
 To share with everyone, type Everyone and click Add, as shown in Figure 23-7.
635

Chapter 23: Sharing and Collaborating
3.
The default permission level is Reader, which offers read-only access. To grant write access
(so that users can change the presentation), click the down arrow next to the current per-
mission level and click Co-Owner. See Figure 23-8.
FIGURE 23-8
You can allow others to make changes to the presentation ﬁle by setting the permission level for
the Everyone group (or for a speciﬁc user) to Co-Owner.
Choosing Co-owner
enables others to
change the files.
4.
Click the Share button to begin sharing with everyone.
Folder Sharing in Windows XP
In Windows XP, sharing a folder location is simpler. Follow these steps:
1.
From any ﬁle management window, right-click the folder or drive to be shared and choose
Sharing and Security.
2.
On the Sharing tab, mark the Share this folder on the network check box. See
Figure 23-9.
3.
(Optional) To allow others to make changes, mark the Allow network users to change my
ﬁles check box.
4.
Click OK.
Caution
When you are editing a presentation stored on a network drive, save it to your hard disk ﬁrst, and then edit
the copy there. Working with an open copy from the network drive can generate a lot of trafﬁc across the
network and could cause your document to have problems later. ■
637

Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
FIGURE 23-9
In Windows XP, you can grant read-only or write permission to the folder.
Sending a Presentation via E-Mail
You can e-mail a presentation ﬁle to others directly from within PowerPoint using your default
e-mail program, such as Outlook, Windows Mail, or Outlook Express. Recipients get the presen-
tation as an e-mail attachment, which they can then open in their own copies of PowerPoint.
To e-mail a presentation from within PowerPoint, follow these steps:
1.
From an open presentation, choose File ➪Save & Send ➪Send Using E-mail ➪Send
as Attachment. A new e-mail message opens in your default e-mail application with the
presentation set as an attachment as shown in Figure 23-10.
2.
Type or select the e-mail addresses for the recipients. The exact procedure depends on the
e-mail application you are using.
3.
The default Subject is the PowerPoint ﬁle’s name; change it if desired.
4.
If desired, in the body section of the e-mail, type a note telling the recipients what you
have attached and what you want them to do with the presentation.
5.
Click Send.
638

Chapter 23: Sharing and Collaborating
FIGURE 23-10
PowerPoint helps you e-mail presentations easily.
Sharing a Presentation with Windows Live
Windows Live (also called SkyDrive) is a free online repository where you can save ﬁles that you
want to make available — either to yourself or to others — via a Web interface, from anywhere
that Internet access is available. This is a great new feature because it eliminates the need to carry
around a disk or ﬂash drive with your presentation on it. Just log into the Internet and there
it is!
To save to Windows Live, choose File ➪Save & Send ➪Save to Web. The ﬁrst time you may
need to follow some prompts to set up your folders; you’ll need a Windows Live ID too, and
prompts will help you set that up if needed.
After signing up for the service, choose File ➪Save & Send ➪Save to Web ➪Sign In to sign
in with your Windows Live ID. Figure 23-11 shows the log-in screen. Mark the Remember my
credentials check box if you want Windows to remember this login so you won’t have to sign in
every time.
After you sign in, the Windows Live interface provides buttons for saving to a Public location
(which anyone with whom you share the link can access) and My Documents (which is for your
own use only). Click the button for the desired location. See Figure 23-12. You can also click
New which has a folder icon, to create other folders than those two default ones.

Caution
If you save into the Public folder, the ﬁles are not only available to everyone, but sometimes actively
‘‘marketed’’ to your network of friends in Windows Live. Depending on your settings, your Windows Live
friends may receive notiﬁcations that you have shared ﬁles, along with invitations to view them. ■
640

Chapter 23: Sharing and Collaborating
After selecting the location you want, click the Save As button (in Figure 23-12). A Save As dia-
log box opens that is similar to the normal one, but has your Windows Live location pre-entered.
(Don’t change the location.) Enter the ﬁlename and type as you normally would and click Save.
Then later, when you want to retrieve your presentation from Windows Live, do the following:
1.
Choose File ➪Save & Send ➪Save to Web, and then click the Sign In link.
Icons for your Windows Live folders appear.
2.
Click the Windows Live text hyperlink above the folder icons. A Web page appears
showing your Windows Live (SkyDrive) workspace.
Double-click the icon for the folder you want if it appears in the Recent folders area, as
shown in Figure 23-13. Or, if it doesn’t appear there, click All folders to browse for it.
FIGURE 23-13
Browse your Windows Live content from a Web interface.
3.
When you see the presentation ﬁle you want to open, click it to open its page. Then do
any of the following:
 Click View to open it in an online PowerPoint viewer; then click Open in PowerPoint
to open it in PowerPoint itself.
641

Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
 Click Edit to open it in an online PowerPoint Web-based application. (It’s a simpliﬁed
version of PowerPoint. You can then optionally click Open in PowerPoint to open it in
PowerPoint itself.)
 Click Download to download the ﬁle to your computer. Then click Save to save it to
your hard disk, or Open to open it in PowerPoint.
Creating a SharePoint Slide Library
Often people who work at the same company can beneﬁt from sharing slides with one another.
For example, a product manager might have slides that describe his product, and a sales or mar-
keting person in the company could save a great deal of time by copying such slides instead of
recreating them from scratch. However, it can be time-consuming to wade through large presen-
tations to ﬁnd a single slide that could be of beneﬁt.
A slide library is a specialized type of document library that stores individual slides rather than
entire presentations. A slide library enables users to publish individual slides that they think
might be of interest to others in their organization. For example, with a slide library, product
managers could post two or three slides about their products, and an executive or Salesperson
could easily browse these and choose the ones needed for a presentation to a particular client.
Caution
If a slide contains links to other content, such as videos or sounds, that linked content is not included in the
slide library. ■
You can check out slides from a slide library and attach an approval process and tasks to them.
In addition, you can tag each slide in several ways, and search the slide libraries for just the
slides you need.
Caution
Slide libraries aren’t available in SharePoint Foundation 2010. You must have at least a SharePoint Server
2010 standard edition installation or better. If you are not sure what license level of SharePoint you own,
check with your SharePoint administrator. ■
You cannot build a Slide Library in every kind of site. By default, only Team sites, Document
Workspaces, Blogs, Group Work Sites, Meeting Workspaces, Document Centers, Records Cen-
ters, Business Intelligence Centers, My Sites, Personalization Sites, Enterprise Search Centers, and
Publishing Sites can create Slide Libraries. If you cannot create a Slide Library you might need
to activate the Slide Library feature on your SharePoint site. The Slide Library is a hidden feature
that can only be activated from the command line on a server using the STSADM command. To
activate the Slide Library feature use the following command line:
stsadm -o activatefeature -name SlideLibrary -url
˝
http://Site Url˝
642

Chapter 23: Sharing and Collaborating
Creating a Slide Library
Before you can create a slide library on your site, your SharePoint administrator must give you
the Manage Lists permission. By default, this permission is granted to users with either the
Design or Full Control permission levels. You must build the slide library from the SharePoint
Web-based interface before you can save slides to it. You cannot build a Slide Library from
within PowerPoint. You can create a local slide library that’s not on a SharePoint server. You
then publish the slides to that folder like a SharePoint slide library (as explained in the next
section).
Follow these steps to create a slide library:
1.
In your browser, navigate to your SharePoint site.
2.
Click the Site Actions button and select the More Options menu item. If you don’t have a
More options selection, you don’t have permissions to create a slide library.
3.
In the panel on the left side of the page, select to Filter by Library.
4.
In the middle panel of the page, select Slide Library. Click the Create button on the right
side of the page. The New page opens.
5.
Fill in a name and description for your slide library.
6.
If you want to keep multiple versions of your slides change the Slide Version History from
No to Yes.
Note
Creating a versioned library allows you to track when slides are changed, who changed them, and what was
changed. In addition, it allows you to keep the old versions of the slides in your library in case you need to
refer to them again. It takes more disk space on the server, but it can save you some hassles later when you
need to look at the old version of a slide. ■
7.
Click Create.
When you return to the home page of your site, you see your new slide library in the Quick-
launch navigation on the left side of the home page. To access it, click the slide library name.
You can also access the library by selecting the View All Site Content link on the Site Actions
menu. Your slide library will show under the Document Libraries section of the All Site
Content page
Now that you have a slide library, it is time to put slides into it. You can add slides from either
PowerPoint or the Web interface.
Placing Slides into a Slide Library from PowerPoint
If the presentation is already open in PowerPoint, it’s a natural next step to publish slides directly
from within PowerPoint to the slide library. This process also works to publish slides to a local
slide library folder (not on a SharePoint server). You or your co-workers, who have access to the
drive, can then re-use slides.
643

Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
To store slides in a Slide Library from within PowerPoint, follow these steps:
1.
Open your presentation and choose File ➪Share ➪Publish Slides ➪Publish Slides. The
Publish Slides dialog box opens as shown in Figure 23-14.
FIGURE 23-14
Publish slides to a slide library from within PowerPoint.
2.
Mark the check box for each slide that you want to publish, or click the Select All button
to add all of the slides to the library.
Can’t see all of the slides? Use the scroll bar on the right to move down through the slides.
3.
(Optional) Change the ﬁlename and/or description for a slide if desired. The File Name
and Description column text is editable; just click in it and type.
4.
Type the path to your slide library in the Publish To ﬁeld. The easiest way to get the path
to your slide library is to copy it from your browser. Select the beginning of the path.
(Don’t select from the /Forms part on.)
5.
Click the Publish button to publish the slides to the library. (You may be prompted for a
username and password for the server.)
As the slides are prepared for the library, you see status updates in the green status bar,
found at the bottom of your presentation, which grows as each slide publishes. When
PowerPoint ﬁnishes publishing the slides, it returns you to the regular interface.
6.
To see the published slides, return to the browser window and refresh the display (press
the F5 key).
644

Chapter 23: Sharing and Collaborating
Placing Slides into a Slide Library from the SharePoint
Web Interface
You can place slides in a slide library directly from the SharePoint site if you prefer. This method
opens PowerPoint, so you must have PowerPoint installed on the PC to do this.
To publish slides starting from the Web interface, follow these steps:
1.
View your slide library in a browser window.
2.
From the Upload drop-down menu, select Publish Slides. Your view switches to
PowerPoint. If it wasn’t opened, it will open, and a Browse dialog box appears.
3.
Browse to the presentation you want to add to your slide library, select it, and
click Open.
From here, the process is the same as it was in PowerPoint. Select the slides, make any changes
to the ﬁles or the descriptions, and then click publish. When PowerPoint ﬁnishes publishing, it
remains open but no presentations are shown.
Once you have published slides to a library, the library shows up in the Publish To drop-down
list on the Publish Slides dialog box. The most recently used library will be selected in the
Publish To ﬁeld.
Working with Slide Properties in a Library
Adding values for the slide properties of each slide in your library helps you ﬁnd the slides
you need more easily. As long as you are diligent about keeping the slide properties up-to-
date, you will ﬁnd that they are an easy way to sort, organize, and ﬁnd just the slides you need.
You can even add custom properties to the slide library to store your own categories of infor-
mation about the slides. For example, you might want to add a property to store the date when
the slides were last used in a presentation. Additional properties can be added by creating new
columns just like you would in any SharePoint document library, but that is beyond the scope
of this book. Please ask your SharePoint administrator how to create new library columns.
Setting Properties for a Single Slide
Slide properties can be set by focusing on an individual slide or for multiple slides in a Datasheet
view. To work with the properties of individual slides use the following steps:
1.
In the Slide Library, hover your mouse over the slide name, so that a dropdown arrow
appears to the right of the slide name and click the arrow to open a context menu.
2.
Choose Edit Properties from the context menu. A properties dialog box for that slide
will appear.
3.
Edit any of the properties that you would like to change.
4.
Click Save to save your changes.
645

Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
Setting Properties for Multiple Slides at Once
You may want to change properties on more than one slide at a time. You can easily do this by
using the Datasheet view, as in the following steps:
1.
From the Actions dropdown menu in the Slide Library, click Edit in Datasheet. The
Datasheet view appears. The datasheet view may not appear if you are running a 64 bit
version or the Home edition of Ofﬁce because a required Active-X control will be missing
from your installation.
2.
Double Click the cell in the Presentation column for the ﬁrst slide in the list and type the
name you want to assign to all the slides in the presentation
3.
Click any other cell in the list to commit the change you have made to the Presentation
property for the ﬁrst slide.
4.
Click the Presentation cell for the ﬁrst slide and drag in the Presentation column to select
the ﬁeld for the slide that you just set and for the other slides in the group.
5.
Right-click the selected cells and select Fill ➪Fill Down to ﬁll that value into the cells
below it.
6.
Click any other cell in the list to commit the changes you have made to the Presentation
property for the group of slides you selected.
Pulling Slides from the Library to PowerPoint
Once you have slides in your library, you will work with them primarily from within
PowerPoint. You can quickly pull individual slides into presentations using the following steps:
1.
Open the presentation into which you want to insert one or more slides.
2.
On the Home tab in the Ribbon, click the down arrow under the New Slides button and
select Reuse Slides.
3.
In the task pane that appears to the right, select or type the URL of your Slide Library in
the Insert slide from the dropdown list. If you paste the URL from your browser, remove
everything after the slide library name. You can also use the path of a ﬁle folder where you
have published slides.
4.
Click the arrow button to the right of the dropdown list to open your Slide Library. A
thumbnail list of slides will appear in the task pane.
Tip
To best see all of the slides, you might want to widen and/or undock the task pane. To undock it, click the blue
bar at the top of the task pane and drag it toward the middle of the screen. Drag the edge of the task pane to
widen it. ■
5.
(Optional) To keep the source formatting for the slide(s), mark the Keep Source
Formatting check box. Otherwise, the content of the slides inserted will adjust to the
destination presentation’s master slide settings.
646

Chapter 23: Sharing and Collaborating
6.
(Optional) Mark the check box for Tell Me When the Slide Changes. This ensures that if
someone else changes this slide and checks it into the library, you will be notiﬁed.
7.
Click a slide to add it to the presentation. Repeat for each slide you want to add.
Tip
If your library is very large and you want to search for slides that match a certain criteria, type criteria in the
Search box. This works only if your server supports Search. You can also change how the slides are grouped, to
ﬁnd speciﬁc slides, using the dropdown above the slides. ■
8.
Close the task pane.
Summary
In this chapter, you learned how to share both your presentations and your slides with other
users. You learned how to make comments to a presentation, and how to compare and combine
changes made by multiple users. You learned about sharing full presentation ﬁles using a LAN
drive, e-mail, Windows Live, and a basic SharePoint slide library. In the next chapter, you will

lthough PowerPoint works great right out-of-the-box, it can work
even better for you with a few tweaks. You can change program
defaults and customize the Quick Access Toolbar and Ribbon to
make PowerPoint your own.
Setting Program Defaults
PowerPoint contains a large assortment of customizable program settings.
Some of these settings make purely cosmetic changes to the interface,
whereas others enable or disable timesaving or safety features.
You can access most options by selecting File ➪Options and working in the
PowerPoint Options dialog box. Click a category in the PowerPoint Options
dialog box along the left side, and then set the options that you want.
Table 24-1 lists all of the options, divided by category (or most of them,
anyway; depending on the language, you may have a few extra options or be
missing a few).
Conﬁguring the Trust Center
The Trust Center is a separate dialog box from the main PowerPoint options;
it contains categories for controlling the permissions that users, programs,
and Internet sites have, to access your computer through PowerPoint. After
clicking the Trust Center category in the PowerPoint Options dialog box,
you can click the Trust Center Settings button to access it.

Setting Up Trusted Locations
A trusted location is a location that you verify to be threat-free. When a presentation ﬁle is stored
in a trusted location, PowerPoint allows macros to run without the usual safeguards (discussed
later in this Appendix). To allow free access to your macros in a presentation ﬁle, you should
store it in a trusted location.
The following folders are trusted by default:
 Program Files\Microsoft Ofﬁce\Document Themes 14
 Program Files\Microsoft Ofﬁce\Templates
 Users\username\Application Data\Microsoft\Addins (Windows XP only)
 Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Addins (Windows Vista and 7 only)
 Users\username\Application Data\Microsoft\Templates (Windows XP only)
 Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates (Windows Vista and 7 only)
You can also add more trusted locations. For example, you may want to trust a folder in
which you store your presentation ﬁles for a certain client.
654

Chapter 24: Customizing PowerPoint
To add a trusted location, follow these steps:
1.
Choose File ➪Options.
2.
Click Trust Center, and click the Trust Center Settings button.
3.
Click Trusted Locations. A list of currently trusted locations appears, as shown in
Figure 24-1.
4.
Click Add New Location.
5.
Click the Browse button, browse to the location you want, and then click OK.
6.
(Optional) If you want, you can select the Subfolders of This Location Are Also Trusted
check box.
7.
Click OK.
FIGURE 24-1
You can set up new trusted locations in the Trust Center dialog box.
Figure 24-1 shows other settings and buttons that you can also select:
 Allow Trusted Locations on my network: Enables you to add trusted locations that
exist other than on your local computer.
655

Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
 Disable all Trusted Locations: This setting does just what its name says. You will learn
more about trusted publishers later in this chapter.
 Remove: Removes a trusted location from the list. (There is no conﬁrmation; it is removed
immediately.)
 Modify: Opens the Trusted Location dialog box for a location, so that you can change its
path or options.
Working with Trusted Publishers
Another way to trust a macro is to verify that it comes from a trusted publisher. The Macro Set-
tings (covered in a later section) enable you to specify what should happen when a macro from
a trusted publisher wants to run outside of a trusted location.
When you open a presentation that includes one or more signed macros, PowerPoint prompts
you, asking whether or not you want to trust macros from that signer. Information about the
signer’s certiﬁcate appears, including the name, the issuing authority, and the valid dates. If you
choose Yes, then this signer is added to your Trusted Publishers list. If you have not yet added a
signer to the Trusted Publishers list, then the list will be blank in the Trust Center dialog box.
If you have a trusted publisher on your list, you can select it and then click View to view its
information, or click Remove to remove it from the Trusted Publishers list.
Trusted Document and Protected View Settings
When you open a presentation that is not from a trusted location or trusted publisher, it opens
in an uneditable mode; you must click Enable Content on the information bar that appears
across the top of the window to trust that document (see Figure 24-2), or choose File ➪Info
➪Enable Editing.
FIGURE 24-2
You can set up new trusted locations in the Trust Center dialog box.
The Trust Center has several settings for managing the process of trusting a document (or not).
First, in the Trusted Documents category, you can set these options:
 Allow documents on a network to be trusted: If you clear this check box, documents
that originate from a source other than your own computer will not be editable.
656

Chapter 24: Customizing PowerPoint
 Disable Trusted Documents: If you mark this check box, it completedly disables the
ability to trust any documents, whether on a network or your own PC.
In the Protected View category, you can then ﬁne-tune the criteria for a document being
protected:
 Enable Protected View for ﬁles originating from the Internet: This includes presenta-
tions you download from Web sites.
 Enable Protected View for ﬁles located in potentially unsafe locations: This includes
presentations stored on your local hard disk but not in locations marked as Trusted (see
Setting Up Trusted Locations).
 Enable Protected View for Outlook attachments: This includes any presentations that
you have received as e-mail attachments in Outlook.
 Enable Data Execution Prevention mode: An extra level of protection against malicious
code.
Add-Ins
You will learn about managing add-ins later in this chapter; they extend PowerPoint’s function-
ality by integrating mini-programs written by third-party individuals or companies not afﬁliated
with Microsoft. Add-ins can often dramatically extend the capabilities of an application by adding
new tabs on the Ribbon, new buttons, and more. Because they connect with the application at a
fairly low level, they can be devastating if they contain viruses. (It is not common for add-ins to
contain viruses, but you never know what could happen.)
In the Add-Ins section of the Trust Center, you can specify the criteria for add-ins being able
to run:
 Require Application add-ins to be signed by Trusted Publisher: Prevents unsigned
add-ins from being installed. Trusted publishers are deﬁned and conﬁgured in the Trusted
Publishers section, discussed earlier in this chapter.
 Disable notiﬁcation for unsigned add-ins: Prevents a warning from appearing when
an add-in is disabled because it is not signed. This is applicable only if the above option is
selected.
 Disable all Application add-ins: Prevents all add-ins from running, regardless of the
signed or unsigned status.
ActiveX Settings
ActiveX controls are somewhat like add-ins or macros; they are more commonly used on Web
pages, but sometimes PowerPoint ﬁles (or other Ofﬁce ﬁles) contain them as well. They extend
the functionality of the program in some way.
657

Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
In the ActiveX Settings for all Ofﬁce Applications section, you can choose a level of permission
for ActiveX controls, ranging from disabling all of them to enabling all of them. See Figure 24-3.
FIGURE 24-3
Specify what level of permission ActiveX controls should have.
Macro Settings
Macro settings apply only to macros that are stored in presentations that are not in trusted loca-
tions. These settings determine whether or not the macro should run, and whether you should
receive notiﬁcation, as shown in Figure 24-4.
FIGURE 24-4
You can specify what should happen when a presentation outside a trusted location tries to run a
macro.
Message Bar
By default, when content is blocked, a message bar appears between the Ribbon and the pre-
sentation to let you know what has happened. You can enable or disable the appearance of this
message bar.
658

Chapter 24: Customizing PowerPoint
File Block Settings
In this area of the Trust Center, you can specify that certain ﬁle types be prevented from being
opened or saved via PowerPoint. If you place a check mark in the Open column for a certain ﬁle
type, PowerPoint either prevents it from opening at all, or opens it in Protected view, depend-
ing on the Open behavior for selected ﬁle types setting (at the bottom of the dialog box). If you
place a check mark in the Save column, PowerPoint will prevent the ﬁle from being saved. See
Figure 24-5.
FIGURE 24-5
You can block certain ﬁle types from being saved or opened, or force them to be opened in
Protected View.
Privacy Options
It is usually safe to connect to the Internet to download content such as clip art and templates,
and to send feedback to Microsoft about errors and usage. However, some people are concerned
about security, and prefer to control their computer’s connection to outside sources such as the
659

Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
Internet. (Yes, I know, just because you are paranoid does not mean that someone is not out
to get you.) In the Privacy Options category, you can ﬁnd a set of check boxes where you can
decide what connectivity to allow.
Customizing the Ribbon
You can customize any part of the Ribbon in PowerPoint 2010, which is a big improvement from
PowerPoint 2007. You can even create your own new tabs, making it possible to consolidate the
commands you use most often on a single tab for greater efﬁciency.
Minimizing the Ribbon
If you aren’t using the Ribbon at the moment, you can hide it to get extra space on the screen to
see more text at once. There are several ways to do this:
 Right-click any button on either the Ribbon or the Quick Access Toolbar and choose Min-
imize Ribbon.
 Click the up-pointing arrow above the Ribbon on the far right.
 Press Ctrl+F1.
To redisplay it again, do any of the following:
 Right-click any button on the Quick Access Toolbar and choose Minimize Ribbon to toggle
the option off.
 Click the down-pointing arrow in the upper-right corner of the PowerPoint window.
 Press Ctrl+F1.
Displaying or Hiding Ribbon Tabs
If there are certain tabs you never use, you might want to hide them. (You can always change
your mind later and redisplay them.)
To choose which tabs display, follow these steps:
1.
Right-click any button on the Ribbon and choose Customize the Ribbon. The PowerPoint
Options dialog box opens with the Customize Ribbon tab displayed.
2.
Mark or clear the check boxes as needed for each Ribbon tab listed in the right pane. See
Figure 24-6.
3.
Click OK.
660

Chapter 24: Customizing PowerPoint
Caution
Some of the tabs listed in Figure 24-6 are not displayed all the time. For example, the Slide Master tab
appears only when you are working in Slide Master view. If you disable one of these tabs, and then perform
an action that would normally make that tab appear, it won’t appear. This can be perplexing to someone
else using your computer who doesn’t know you’ve hidden it, or even to yourself if you forgot you did. ■
FIGURE 24-6
You can turn certain tabs on or off.
Clear the check box
for any tab you
want to hide
Creating or Deleting a Tab or a Custom Group
You can add any command to any tab, as long as it is in a custom group (that is, a user-created
group). Therefore you have to create the custom group ﬁrst, before you can start customizing an
existing tab. If desired, you can create a whole new tab ﬁrst, and then create your custom groups
on that new tab.
Creating a Custom Tab
To create your own tab, follow these steps:
1.
Right-click any button on the Ribbon and choose Customize the Ribbon. The PowerPoint
Options dialog box opens with the Customize Ribbon tab displayed.
661

Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
2.
On the Main Tabs list (right side of dialog box), click the existing tab that the new one
should appear after (that is, to the right of).
3.
Click New Tab. A new tab appears on the list called New Tab (Custom). By default, it has
one group in it: New Group (Custom). See Figure 24-7.
4.
Click the new tab, and click the Rename button.
5.
In the Rename dialog box, type a new name for the tab and click OK.
6.
Click the new group within that new tab, and rename it the same way.
7.
Click OK to close the dialog box, or leave it open for more editing.
FIGURE 24-7
When you create a custom tab, a custom group is automatically created in it.
New tab
Creating a Custom Group
Here’s how to create a custom group:
1.
If the PowerPoint Options dialog box is not already open, right-click any button on the
Ribbon and choose Customize the Ribbon.
2.
Click the tab on which you want to create the new group.
3.
Click New Group. A new group is added to that tab, with the name New Group (Custom).
662

Chapter 24: Customizing PowerPoint
All custom groups have the same name by default; PowerPoint does not number them or
give them sequential names.
4.
(Optional) Rename the group:
a. Click Rename.
b. Type a new name for the group.
c. Click an icon for the group. (This icon will appear if the group is collapsed because of
inadequate window width to display it.) See Figure 24-8.
d. Click OK.
5.
Click OK to close the dialog box, or leave it open for more editing.
FIGURE 24-8
When you rename a group, you can also optionally change its icon.
Adding or Removing Commands
You can’t remove the standard commands on any of the built-in tabs; only the groups and com-
mands you have placed yourself can be modiﬁed.
Before you add a command to the Ribbon, consider whether it might be better to add it to the
Quick Access Toolbar instead (covered later in this chapter). The Quick Access Toolbar is always
available, regardless of which tab is displayed. This can save you a step in executing the com-
mand because you never have to change tabs to get to it.
Adding a Command
To add a command, follow these steps:
1.
Select the custom group to which you want to add the command. (Remember, you can’t
add commands to built-in groups.)
663

Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
2.
On the list at the left, select the command to add.
You may wish to narrow down the list of commands by making a selection from the
drop-down list ﬁrst. For example, you could choose Commands Not on the Ribbon to
exclude commands that are already on other tabs.
3.
Click the Add button. The command appears under the group name on the left side of the
window.
4.
Click OK to close the dialog box, or leave it open for more editing.
Removing a Command
To remove a command:
1.
Right-click the command you want to remove.
2.
Click Remove.
Alternately, you can click the Remove button to the left of the tabs list.
The command is removed from the custom group, but is still available on the list on the left, so
that you can add it later to some other group or tab.
Renaming or Reordering Tabs
You can change the entire look of the Ribbon by renaming and/or reordering its tabs.
Any tab can be renamed, even the built-in ones. Just right-click it and choose Rename, or click
the Rename button, and then type the new name. PowerPoint does not check whether each
name is unique, so you can name them all the same thing if you like. (That wouldn’t be very
useful, though.)
To move a tab or group, right-click it and then click Move Up or Move Down, or use the Move
Up or Move Down buttons.
Resetting Customizations
It’s easy to get carried away with customizing PowerPoint and end up with an interface you
barely recognize. If this happens, reset the Ribbon to its original state and start over.
To reset only one tab, do the following:
1.
If the PowerPoint Options dialog box is not already open, right-click any button on the
Ribbon and choose Customize Ribbon.
2.
Click the Reset button. A menu opens.
3.
Click Reset Only Selected Ribbon Tab.
4.
Click OK to close the dialog box, or leave it open for further editing.
664

Chapter 24: Customizing PowerPoint
To reset all customization, including any custom shortcut keys and the Quick Access Toolbar, do
the following:
1.
If the PowerPoint Options dialog box is not already open, right-click any button on the
Ribbon and choose Customize Ribbon.
2.
Click the Reset button. A menu opens.
3.
Click Reset All Customizations.
4.
Click OK to close the dialog box, or leave it open for further editing.
Importing and Exporting Customization Settings
After you get the Ribbon and other customizations just the way you like them, what happens if
you need to switch to a different computer? The good news is, you don’t have to re-customize
everything; you can export your customization settings to a ﬁle. Then you can transfer that ﬁle
to the other PC and import the customization settings there.
Exporting Customization
To export your customization settings, follow these steps:
1.
If the PowerPoint Options dialog box is not already open, right-click any button on the
Ribbon and choose Customize Ribbon.
2.
Click the Import/Export button. A menu opens.
3.
Click Export All Customizations. The File Save dialog box opens.
4.
(Optional) Change the ﬁlename and location if desired.
5.
Click Save.
6.
Click OK to close the PowerPoint Options dialog box.
Importing Customization
User interface conﬁguration ﬁles like the one you just saved in the preceding section can be
imported into PowerPoint 2010 on any other PC. Importing will wipe out any customization
settings on that PC, so make sure there are no customizations that you can’t reproduce that you
want to keep before doing this.
Here’s how:
1.
If the PowerPoint Options dialog box is not already open, right-click any button on the
Ribbon and choose Customize Ribbon.
2.
Click the Import/Export button. A menu opens.
3.
Click Import Customization File.
4.
Select the customization ﬁle and click Open.
665

Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
5.
A conﬁrmation box appears; click Yes.
6.
Click OK to close the PowerPoint Options dialog box.
Customizing the Quick Access Toolbar
The Quick Access Toolbar, or QAT, is the row of buttons above the File button, in the upper-left
corner of the PowerPoint window. It contains a few buttons by default, such as Save, Undo and
Redo, and you can add others to it. For example, I use Format Painter a lot, but every time I
need it, I don’t want to have to click the Home tab. By adding Format Painter to the QAT, I
make it available all of the time, without having to remember which tab it is on.
Adding Common Commands
PowerPoint maintains a short list of popular commands that you can quickly turn on or off on
the QAT. To do so, click the down arrow at the right end of the QAT and then select a com-
mand from the menu to toggle it on or off. See Figure 24-9.
FIGURE 24-9
Certain commands can be toggled on or off on the QAT via its menu.
Adding Already-Available Commands to the QAT
If the command is already available on a tab or menu, then adding it to the QAT is easy. Just
right-click it and choose Add to Quick Access Toolbar. You can use this method to combine all
666

Chapter 24: Customizing PowerPoint
of your most-used commands and buttons in a single location, so that you do not have to switch
among the tabs as frequently.
However, in order to use this method, the command already has to be available somewhere
within PowerPoint’s Ribbon or Ofﬁce menu. As a result, you cannot use this method to add
capabilities to PowerPoint that it does not already have by default.
Removing Commands from the QAT
To remove a command from the QAT, right-click it on the QAT and choose Remove from
Quick Access Toolbar. If you want to add it again later, you can use the method in the
preceding section if the command exists on a tab or menu. You can use the method in the
following section if it does not, or if you cannot seem to ﬁnd it on any of the tabs or menus.
Adding Other Commands to the QAT
Besides the standard set of commands, PowerPoint also contains a secret list of extra commands
and capabilities. Most of these are old features from previous versions of PowerPoint that
Microsoft is phasing out, or for which there was no room on the Ribbon. For example, the
Shape Combine, Shape Intersect, Shape Subtract, and Shape Union commands help build
complex drawings by combining shapes, and are not available on the Ribbon by default.
To add a command to the QAT, follow these steps:
1.
Right-click the QAT and choose Customize Quick Access Toolbar.
2.
Open the Customize Quick Access Toolbar drop-down list (on the right), and choose
For All Documents, or choose a particular presentation name from the list. You can only
customize for either one presentation or for all presentations.
3.
Open the Choose Commands From drop-down list and select a category. There are cate-
gories for every tab, as well as some extra ones at the top of the list:
 Macros: Any macros stored in the current presentation or template appear here.
 Commands Not in the Ribbon: The collection of commands that do not have Ribbon
or Ofﬁce menu equivalents; this is where you will ﬁnd the hidden goodies.
 All Commands: A complete list of all commands; use this list when you think a com-
mand is already available on a tab but you do not know which one.
4.
Select a command from the list, and click the Add>> button to move it to the Customize
Quick Access Toolbar list, as shown in Figure 24-10.
5.
Add any other commands that you want.
6.
(Optional) Perform any of the following tasks, if necessary:
 To reset the QAT, click Reset.
 To modify a macro after adding it to the QAT, select it and click Modify.
667

Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
 To change the order in which buttons appear on the QAT, select a button and click the
Up- or Down-arrow button to the right of the listing.
7.
Click OK to accept the changes.
FIGURE 24-10
You can add commands to the Quick Access Toolbar.
Managing Add-Ins
Add-ins are extra features that you can install for PowerPoint that extend its capabilities in some
way. You can add, remove, or temporarily enable/disable the various add-ins in PowerPoint to
control how it behaves.
One of the most powerful types of add-ins is a Component Object Model (COM) add-in. COM
add-ins are supplemental programs that extend PowerPoint’s capabilities by adding custom com-
mands or features. COM add-ins can come from Microsoft or from third-party sources. They
usually have a .dll or .exe extension and are written in a programming language such as Visual
Basic or C++. For example, if you have Adobe Acrobat installed on your system, you might
have PDF Maker add-ins that help you create PDF ﬁles from Ofﬁce content.
668

Chapter 24: Customizing PowerPoint
To view installed add-ins, follow these steps:
1.
Choose File ➪Options.
2.
Click Add-Ins. A list of installed add-ins appears (see Figure 24-11).
FIGURE 24-11
See a list of installed add-ins here.
An installed add-in can be either enabled or disabled. Having the option of disabling an add-in
rather than removing it entirely is handy because it allows you to turn one off temporarily
without losing it. Disabling add-ins is also helpful for troubleshooting. If you are not sure
what add-in is causing PowerPoint to crash, you can disable them all and then enable them
one-at-a-time until you ﬁnd the problem.
To disable or remove an add-in, you need to know what type it is, because the steps are different
for the various types. To determine a type, look in the Type column.
Based on the type, open the Manage drop-down list at the bottom of the dialog box and select
the desired add-in type. Then click Go to open a dialog box interface speciﬁcally for that type of
add-in.
669

Enabling/Disabling COM Add-Ins
Choose COM Add-ins in the Manage drop-down list and click Go to display the COM Add-Ins
dialog box. It lists the available COM add-ins; you can select one and click Remove, or you can
change its load behavior. You can also click Add to add more COM add-ins, although most COM
add-ins come with their own setup programs that do that part for you.
Enabling/Disabling Smart Tags
Choose Actions in the Manage drop-down list and click Go to display the AutoCorrect dialog
box with the Smart Tags controls. From here you can enable or disable individual Smart Tags,
such as Measurement Converter, Date, and Financial Symbols.

Adding Sound

to a Presentation
IN THIS LAB
Applying custom animations
Assigning transitions to slides
Adding a musical soundtrack
from a ﬁle
I
n an ideal world, you’d have great video equipment to create live-action
movies for your audiences, but that’s not always the case. Often you’re
stuck with a bunch of static images, and you need to make them as
lively and animated as possible within the conﬁnes of PowerPoint.
In this lab, you animate a presentation for Spice Meadow Shelties, a small
kennel that breeds purebred Shetland Sheepdogs. The graphics and text are
already in place. Your job is to apply animations and transitions to make the
presentation more interesting and appealing.
Lab 2A: Fading Text and Graphics
In and Out
In this lab session, you add some text to a slide. You then animate it and
the photos so that the ﬁrst set fades in and out, and then the other set fades
in. Even though the text and pictures seem to overlap in Normal view, they
appear at different times in Slide Show view so there is no conﬂict.
Level of difﬁculty: Moderate
Time to complete: 15 to 30 minutes
1.
Open the ﬁle Lab2A.pptx from the Labs folder (from the CD
accompanying the book) and save it as MyLab2A.pptx.

Creating a navigation bar
Creating a graphical navigation
system
W
hen you create user-interactive presentations that contain many
slides, it is considered courteous to provide your audience with
a navigation system so that they can browse through the pre-
sentation without having to view every single slide. Menu systems can be as
simple or as complex as you like and can be integrated into the slide design.
The Scenario
In this project lab, you learn how to create a navigation system in a presen-
tation that is designed to teach computer technicians about safety issues for
working on PCs. You modify the presentation’s layout and design to make
room for a menu system, and then you create navigational hyperlinks on the
Slide Master.
Lab 3A: Making Room for
a Navigation Bar
In this lab session, you start with a plain-looking presentation and modify its
Slide Master to make room for a menu system on the left side of the slide.
This lab session includes some cleanup work on a ‘‘messy’’ PowerPoint ﬁle
that is missing a layout needed for some of the slides. This session simulates
the type of cleanup situations you might run into in everyday work on older
presentation ﬁles.

Creating a Classroom
Game
IN THIS LAB
Creating a game board
Creating question and answer
slides
Linking up the game board
P
owerPoint’s ability to hyperlink between slides and hide slides until
they are needed makes it a natural choice for creating multiple-choice
quizzes and games. You can create a slide with a question on it, and
then create hidden slides for each of the possible answers. Then depending
on which answer the user clicks, a different hidden slide appears indicating
whether the answer was right or wrong.
The Scenario
In this project lab, you learn how to create a simple game to use in a
classroom setting that tests students’ understanding of the informational
presentation you worked with in Lab 3.

T
his appendix provides you with information on the contents of
the CD that accompanies this book. For the latest and greatest
information, please refer to the ReadMe ﬁle located at the root
of the CD.
Files on This CD
The CD-ROM included with Microsoft Ofﬁce PowerPoint 2010 Bible contains
more than 500 PowerPoint templates and backgrounds that you can use
to design your own PowerPoint presentations. In addition, the author has
included important ﬁles that you will need to perform the Project Labs.
Templates and Backgrounds
If you aren’t familiar with how to choose a background or template for
your presentation, be sure to read Chapter 5 before attempting to use the
CD-ROM.
These templates were provided for your use by several of the best-known pro-
fessional design ﬁrms and PowerPoint MVPs. They have additional templates
available either for sale or free download from their Web sites. The designers
who supplied the templates and backgrounds for this book are:

Some of the templates and backgrounds are single slide ﬁles. Others contain many slides in one
ﬁle with pre-built designs for many different slides types (tables, charts, text, and so on) all using
the same look.
If you somehow don’t ﬁnd templates or backgrounds you like on the CD and want to have more
to choose from, these template and background sites would be excellent places to start. And if
you do ﬁnd templates you like from one of the suppliers on this CD, be sure to reward their
good work by considering a purchase of other templates from them when you have future tem-
plate needs.
The CD-ROM is organized with a directory for each vendor and their templates are within that.
Some of the vendor directories are further divided into subdirectories by category or for each
template, and some include licensing and ReadMe ﬁles you should read before using their tem-
plates. To use any of them, navigate to the CD-ROM drive and select the template or background
you like using the methods described in Chapters 3 and 5. You can also copy the ﬁles from the
CD-ROM to your local hard drive and use them from there.
Note
The PresentationPro templates are not unzipped. To see previews of their ﬁles, please look in the
PresentationPro subdirectory and open the samples.html ﬁle, which provides links to their zipped templates
