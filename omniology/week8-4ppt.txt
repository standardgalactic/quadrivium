Regulation of Estrogen and  
Progesterone Receptors 
Estrogen increases the number of estrogen receptors 
Estrogen increases the number of progesterone receptors 
 
Progesterone reduces the number of estrogen receptors 

Oral Contraceptives 
Birth Control Pills 
 
Enovid introduced in the early 1960’s 
 
 mostly progesterone with a little estrogen 
 
  
(originally the estrogen was a  
 
  
contaminant) 
 
1980’s 
 
started making pills with much smaller doses of 
synthetic progesterone and estrogen 
 
(10-20 fold lower) 
 
Actions – prevent ovulation 
 
alter mucous in cervix so sperm can’t enter uterus, 
other changes in uterus and oviduct 

Key Concepts 
During the follicular phase, estrogen from the chosen follicle 
in the ovary causes the uterus to be in the proliferative phase. 
 
During the luteal phase, estrogen and progesterone from the 
corpus luteum of the ovary causes the uterus to be in the 
secretory phase so that it is prepared for implantation of an 
embryo. 
 
During pregnancy, hCG from the embryo maintains the corpus 
luteum for the 1st three months. After the 1st trimester the 
corpus luteum degenerates and the placenta produces 
estrogen and progesterone instead of the corpus luteum. 
 
Oral contraceptives act on the H-P axis to reduce LH and FSH  
release.
