Preface
Project management has evolved from a management philosophy restricted to a 
few functional areas and regarded as something nice to have to an enterprise pro-
ject management system affecting every functional unit of the company. Simply 
stated, project management has evolved into a business process rather than merely 
a project management process. More and more companies are now regarding pro-
ject management as being mandatory for the survival of the firm. Organizations 
that were opponents of project management are now advocates. Management edu-
cators of the past, who preached that project management could not work and 
would be just another fad, are now staunch supporters. Project management is 
here to stay. Colleges and universities are now offering undergraduate and gradu-
ate degrees in project management.
This book is addressed not only to those undergraduate and graduate students 
who wish to improve upon their project management skills but also to those func-
tional managers and upper-level executives who serve as project sponsors and 
must provide continuous support for projects. During the past several years, man-
agement’s knowledge and understanding of project management has matured to 
the point where almost every company is using project management in one form 
or another. These companies have come to the realization that project manage-
ment and productivity are related, and that we are now managing our business as 
though it is a series of projects. Project management coursework is now consum-
ing more of training budgets than ever before.
General reference is provided in the text to engineers. However, the reader 
should not consider project management as strictly engineering-related. The 
engineering examples are the result of the fact that project management first 
appeared in the engineering disciplines, and we should be willing to learn from 
their mistakes. Project management now resides in every profession, including

information systems, healthcare, consulting, pharmaceutical, banks, and govern-
ment agencies.
The text can be used for both undergraduate and graduate courses in business, 
information systems, and engineering. The structure of the text is based upon my 
belief that project management is much more behavioral than quantitative since 
projects are managed by people rather than tools. The first seven chapters are 
part of the basic core of knowledge necessary to understand project management, 
specifically topics related to PMI’s “Talent Triangle.” Chapters 8 through 10 deal 
with the support functions and describe factors for predicting success and man-
agement support. It may seem strange that ten chapters on organizational behavior 
and structuring are needed prior to the “hard-core” chapters of planning, schedul-
ing, and controlling. These first ten chapters are needed to understand the cultural 
environment for all projects and systems. These chapters are necessary for the 
reader to understand the difficulties in achieving cross-functional cooperation on 
projects where team members are working on multiple projects concurrently and 
why the people involved, all of whom may have different backgrounds, cannot 
simply be forged into a cohesive work unit without friction. Chapters 11 through 
20 are more of the quantitative chapters on planning, scheduling, cost control, 
estimating, contracting (and procurement), and quality. Chapter 21 focuses on 
some of the more advanced topics.

The twelfth edition text, the PMBOK® Guide and the book of cases are ideal 
as self-study tools for the Project Management Institute’s PMP® Certification 
Exam. Because of this, there are tables of cross references at the end of each chap-
ter in the textbook detailing the sections from the book of cases and the Guide to 
the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide) that apply to that

chapter’s content. The left-hand margin of the pages in the text has side bars that 
identify the cross-listing of the material on that page to the appropriate section(s) 
of the PMBOK® Guide. At the end of most of the chapters is a section on study 
tips for the PMP® exam.
This textbook is currently used in the college market, in the reference mar-
ket, and for studying for the PMP® Certification Exam. Therefore, to satisfy the 
needs of all markets, a compromise had to be reached on how much of the text 
would be aligned to the PMBOK® Guide and how much new material would be 
included without doubling the size of the text. Some colleges and universities 
use the textbook to teach project management fundamentals without reference 
to the PMBOK® Guide. The text does not contain all of the material neces-
sary to support each section or process in the PMBOK® Guide. Therefore, to 
study for the PMP® Certification Exam, the PMBOK® Guide must also be used 
together with this text. The text covers material for almost all of the PMBOK® 
Guide knowledge areas but not necessarily in the depth that appears in the 
PMBOK® Guide.
An instructor’s manual is available only to college and university faculty 
members by contacting your local Wiley sales representative or by visiting the 
Wiley website at www.wiley.com/kerzner. Access to the instructor’s material and 
supporting material can be provided only through John Wiley & Sons Publishers, 
not the author.
One-, two-, and three-day seminars on project management and the PMP® 
Certification Training using the text are offered by contacting Lori Milhaven, 
Executive Vice President, the International Institute for Learning, at 800-325-
1533, extension 5121 (e-mail address: lori.milhaven@iil.com).
The problems and case studies at the ends of the chapters cover a variety of 
industries. Almost all of the case studies are real-world situations taken from my 
consulting practice or from research. Feedback from my colleagues who are using 
the text has provided me with fruitful criticism, most of which has been incorpo-
rated into the twelfth edition.
The majority of the articles on project management that have become classics 
have been referenced in the textbook throughout the first eleven chapters. These 
articles were the basis for many of the modern developments in project manage-
ment and are therefore identified throughout the text.
Many colleagues provided valuable criticism. In particular, I am indebted 
to those industrial/government training managers whose dedication and commit-
ment to quality project management education and training have led to valuable 
changes in this and previous editions. In particular, I wish to thank Frank Saladis, 
PMP, for his constructive comments, recommendations, and assistance with the 
mapping of the text to the PMBOK® Guide as well as recommended changes to 
many of the chapters. I am indebted to Dr. Edmund Conrow, PMP, for more than a 
decade of assistance with the preparation of the risk management chapters in all of 
my texts. I am also indebted to Dr. Rene Rendon for his review and recommenda-
tions for changes to the chapter on Contract Management.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
In the United States, the roots of project management date back to the Department of Defense (DOD) and 
heavy construction companies during the 1960s. Early use of project management focused on the comple-
tion of unique, or sometimes repetitive, projects with a heavy focus on compliance to budgets and sched-
ules. To maintain standardization and control in the way that projects were managed, DOD established 
policies and procedures for gate reviews and the way that status should be reported.
In the early years, project management was seen as a part-time job rather than as a career path position. 
In many companies, project management existed in only a small portion of the business, which made it dif-
ficult for some projects to get total company support.
Executives began realizing the complexities of resource control and effective project staffing. In addi-
tion, the rapid rate of change in both technology and the marketplace had created enormous strains on 
existing organizational forms. The traditional structure, which was highly bureaucratic, showed that it 
could not respond rapidly enough to a changing environment. Thus, the traditional structure was replaced 
by project management, or other temporary management structures, that were highly organic and could 
respond very rapidly as situations developed inside and outside the company. The organic nature of project 
management practices today allow project managers to customize the project management tools and pro-
cesses to adapt to a variety of different environments.
The acceptance of project management was not easy. Many executives were not willing to accept 
change and were inflexible when it came to adapting to a different environment and flexible organizational 
structures. The project management approach required a departure from the traditional business organiza-
tional form, which was basically vertical and which emphasized a strong superior–subordinate relationship. 
Many executives had very strong beliefs as to how a company should be run and refused to recognize or 
admit that project management could benefit their company.

Overview 
Unfavorable economic conditions forced executives to reconsider the value that project management 
could bring to a firm. Some of the unfavorable conditions included the recessions of the late 1970s and early 
1990s, the housing crisis that began in 2008, the European economy downturn in 2013 and 2014, and the 
world economic slowdown in 2015. These unfavorable conditions emphasized the need for better control 
of existing resources, the creation of a portfolio of projects that would maximize the value brought to the 
firm, and a higher percentage of project successes. It soon became apparent that project management could 
satisfy all of these needs and that project management is a necessity in both bad and good economic condi-
tions. Today, the concept behind project management is being applied in such diverse industries and organi-
zations as defense, construction, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, banking, hospitals, accounting, advertising, 
law, state and local governments, and the United Nations.
Almost all of today’s executives are convinced that project management can and does work well. Pro-
ject management is now being applied to all facets of a business rather than just parts of the business. Pro-
jects are now being aligned with corporate or strategic objectives. Simply stated, “Why work on a project 
that is not aligned to strategic objectives with the goal of creating business value?” In some companies such 
as IBM, Microsoft, and Hewlett-Packard, project management is recognized as a strategic competency nec-
essary for the survival of the firm. This recognition of the importance of project management today perme-
ates almost all industries and companies of all sizes.
1.1 UNDERSTANDING PROJECT MANAGEMENT
In order to understand project management, one must begin with the 
definition of a project. A project can be considered to be any series of 
activities and tasks that:
●
●
Have a specific objective, with a focus on the creation of 
business value, to be completed within certain specifications
●
●
Have defined start and end dates
●
●
Have funding limits (if applicable)
●
●
Consume human and nonhuman resources (i.e., money, people, equipment)
●
●
Are multifunctional (i.e., cut across several functional lines)
The result or outcome of the project can be unique or repetitive, and must be achieved 
within a finite period of time. Because companies have very limited resources, care must 
be taken that the right mix of projects is approved. Given this, another outcome of a project 
is that it provides business value to the company as opposed to being a “pet” project for the 
personal whims of one person.
Project management is the application of knowledge, skills, and tools necessary to 
achieve the project’s requirements. The knowledge, skills, and tools are usually grouped 
into activities or processes. PMI’s PMBOK ® Guide identifies five process groups. Some of 
the activities within these groups include:
●
●
Project initiation
●
●
Selection of the best project given resource limits
●
●
Recognizing the benefits of the project

●

Successful project management can then be defined as achieving a continuous stream of 
project objectives within time, within cost, at the desired performance/technology level, while 
utilizing the assigned resources effectively and efficiently, and having the results accepted by the 
customer and/or stakeholders. Because each project is inherently different and each customer 
can have different requirements, the activities included within the process groups may change 
from project to project. The PMBOK ® Guide identifies industry-accepted activity regarded as 
best practices for each process group and these best practices can be structured to create a 
project management methodology that can be applied and customized to a variety of projects.
The potential benefits from effective project management are:
●
●
Clear identification of functional responsibilities to ensure that all activities are 
accounted for, regardless of personnel turnover
●
●
Minimizing the need for continuous reporting
●
●
Identification of time limits for scheduling
●
●
Identification of a methodology for trade-off analysis
●
●
Measurement of accomplishment against plans
●
●
Early identification of problems so that corrective action may follow
●
●
Improved estimating capability for future planning
●
●
Knowing when objectives cannot be met or will be exceeded
Unfortunately, the benefits cannot be achieved without overcoming obstacles such as 
project complexity, customer’s special requirements and scope changes, organizational 
restructuring, project risks, changes in technology, and forward planning and pricing.

Overview 
Project management is designed to make better use of existing resources by getting 
work to flow horizontally as well as vertically within the company. This approach does not 
really destroy the vertical, bureaucratic flow of work but simply requires that line organi-
zations talk to one another horizontally so that horizontal and vertical work flow will be 
accomplished more smoothly throughout the organization and in a concurrent manner. The 
vertical flow of work is still the responsibility of the line managers. The horizontal flow of 
work is the responsibility of the project managers, and their primary effort is to communi-
cate and coordinate activities horizontally between the line organizations.
Figure 1–1 shows how many companies are structured. There 
are always “class or prestige” gaps between various levels of man-
agement. There are also functional gaps between working units of 
the organization. If we superimpose the management gaps on top of 
the functional gaps, we find that companies are made up of small operational islands that 
refuse to communicate with one another for fear that giving up information may strengthen 
their opponents. The project manager’s responsibility is to get these islands to communi-
cate crossfunctionally toward common goals and objectives.
The project manager may require a difference set of skills when working with each of 
the islands. The PMBOK ® Guide identifies a talent triangle composed of technical project 
management, leadership and strategic and business management skills. In today’s environ-
ment, strategic and business management skills are getting more attention because project 
managers are seen as managing part of a business rather than merely a project and, as such, 
are expected to make both project and business decisions.
The following is an overview definition of project management:
Project management is the planning, organizing, directing, and controlling of company 
resources for a relatively short-term objective that has been established to complete specific 
goals and objectives. Furthermore, project management utilizes the systems approach to 
management by having functional personnel (the vertical hierarchy) assigned to a specific 
project (the horizontal hierarchy).

The preceding definition requires further comment. Classical 
management is usually considered to have five functions or principles:
●
●
Planning
●
●
Organizing
●
●
Staffing
●
●
Controlling
●
●
Directing
You will notice that, in the definition, the staffing function has been omitted. This 
was intentional because the project manager does not staff the project. Staffing is a line 
responsibility. The project manager has the right to request specific resources, but the final 
decision as to what resources will be committed rests with the line managers.
We should also comment on what is meant by a “relatively” short-term project. Not 
all industries have the same definition for a short-term project. In engineering, the pro-
ject might be for six months or two years; in construction, three to five years; in nuclear 
components, ten years; and in insurance, two weeks. Long-term projects, which consume 
resources full-time, are usually set up as a separate division (if large enough) or simply as 
a line organization.
Figure 1–2 is a pictorial representation of traditional project management the way 
it was understood in the past. The objective of the figure is to show that project manage-
ment is designed to manage or control company resources on a given activity, within time, 
within cost, and within performance. Time, cost, and performance were considered as the

Overview 
only constraints on the project. If the project is to be accomplished for an outside customer, 
then the project had a fourth constraint: good customer relations. Customers can be inter-
nal or external to the parent organization. The reader should immediately realize that it is 
possible to manage a project within time, cost, and performance and then also alienate the 
customer to such a degree that no further business will be forthcoming. Executives often 
select project managers based on who the customer is and what kind of customer relations 
will be necessary.
Projects exist to produce deliverables. The person ultimately assigned as the project 
manager may very well be assigned based upon the size, nature, and scope of the delivera-
bles. Deliverables are outputs, or the end result of either the completion of the project or 
the end of a life-cycle phase of the project. Deliverables are measurable, tangible outputs 
and can take such form as:
●
●
Hardware Deliverables: These are hardware items, such as a table, a prototype, 
or a piece of equipment.
●
●
Software Deliverables: These items are similar to hardware deliverables but 
are usually paper products, such as reports, studies, handouts, or documentation. 
Some companies do not differentiate between hardware and software deliverables.
●
●
Interim Deliverables: These items can be either hardware or software delivera-
bles and progressively evolve as the project proceeds. An example is a series of 
interim reports leading up to the final report.
1.2 DEFINING PROJECT SUCCESS
In the previous section, we defined project success as the completion of 
an activity within the constraints of time, cost, and performance. This was 
the definition used for the past thirty to forty years or so. More recently, 
the definition of project success has been modified to include completion:
●
●
Within the allocated time period
●
●
Within the budgeted cost
●
●
At the proper performance or specification level
●
●
With acceptance by the customer/user
●
●
With minimum or mutually agreed upon scope changes
●
●
Without disturbing the main work flow of the organization
●
●
Without changing the corporate culture
The last three elements require further explanation. Very few projects are completed 
within the original scope of the project. Scope changes are inevitable and have the potential 
to destroy not only the morale on a project, but the entire project. Scope changes must be 
held to a minimum and those that are required must be approved by both the project man-
ager and the customer/user.
Project managers must be willing to manage (and make concessions/trade-offs, if nec-
essary) such that the company’s main work flow is not altered. Most project managers

Trade-Offs and Competing Constraints

view themselves as self-employed entrepreneurs after project go-ahead and would like 
to divorce their project from the operations of the parent organization. This is not always 
possible. The project manager must be willing to manage within the guidelines, policies, 
procedures, rules, and directives of the parent organization.
All corporations have corporate cultures, and even though each project may be 
inherently different, the project manager should not expect his assigned personnel to 
deviate from cultural norms. If the company has a standard of openness and honesty 
when dealing with customers, then this cultural value should remain in place for all pro-
jects, regardless of who the customer/user is or how strong the project manager’s desire 
for success is.
Excellence in project management is defined as a continuous stream of successfully 
managed projects. Any project can be driven to success through formal authority and strong 
executive meddling. But in order for a continuous stream of successful projects to occur, 
there must exist a strong corporate commitment to project management, and this commit-
ment must be visible.
1.3 TRADE-OFFS AND COMPETING CONSTRAINTS
Although many projects are completed successfully, at least in the eyes of the stakehold-
ers, the final criteria from which success is measured may be different from the initial 
criteria because of trade-offs. Trade-offs are situations where one aspect of a project may 
be sacrificed to gain an advantage with another aspect. As an example, additional time 
and money may be needed to make further improvements in the quality of the project’s 
deliverables.
The first triangle shown in Figure 1–2 is referred to as the triple constraints on a pro-
ject, namely time, cost, and performance, where performance can be scope, quality, or 
technology. These are considered to be the primary constraints and are often considered to 
be the criteria for a project against which success is measured.
Today, we realize that there can be multiple constraints on a project and, rather than 
use the terminology of the triple constraints, we focus our attention on competing con-
straints. Sometimes the constraints are referred to as primary and secondary constraints. 
There may be secondary factors such as risk, customer relations, image, and reputation that 
may cause us to deviate from our original success criteria of time, cost, and performance. 
These changes can occur any time during the life of a project and can then cause trade-offs 
in the triple constraints, thus requiring that changes be made to the success criteria. In an 
ideal situation, we would perform trade-offs on any or all of the competing constraints such 
that acceptable success criteria would still be met.
As an example, let’s assume that a project was initiated using the success criteria of 
the triple constraints as shown in Figure 1–3. For simplicity’s sake, a triangle was used 
for the competing constraints in Figure 1–3. However, there can be significantly more 
than three competing constraints in which some geometric shape other than a triangle 
might work best. Partway through the project, the environment changes, a new senior 
management team is brought in with their own agenda, or a corporate crisis occurs such 

8
Overview 
that the credibility of the corporation is at stake. In such a case, the competing con-
straints shown on the right in Figure 1–3 can be more important than the original triple 
constraints.
Secondary factors are also considered to be constraints and may be more important 
than the primary constraints. For example, years ago, in Disneyland and Disneyworld, the 
project managers designing and building the attractions at the theme parks had six con-
straints: time, cost, scope, safety, aesthetic value, and quality.
At Disney, the last three constraints of safety, aesthetic value, and quality were consid-
ered locked-in constraints that could not be altered during trade-offs. All trade-offs were 
made on time, cost, and scope. Some constraints simply cannot change while others may 
have flexibility.
Not all constraints are equal in importance. For example, in the initiation phase of a 
project, scope may be the critical factor and all trade-offs are made on time and cost. Dur-
ing the execution phase of the project, time and cost may become more important and then 
trade-offs will be made on scope. A more detailed discussion of trade-offs can be found in 
Chapter 16.
When managing a project according to the triple constraints of time, cost, and scope, 
we perform a juggling act and often find a way to meet all three constraints, each of which 
usually carries an equal degree of importance. When the number of constraints increases 
to five or six constraints, it may be difficult, if not impossible, to meet all of the constraints 
and a prioritization of constraints may be necessary.
The prioritization of constraints can change over the life of the project based upon the 
needs of the project manager, the client, and the stakeholders. Changing the priorities of the 
constraints can lead to scope changes and play havoc with the requirements and baselines. 
There must be a valid reason for changing the prioritization of the constraints after project 
go-ahead.

1.4 THE ENTRY-LEVEL PROJECT MANAGER
Too often, people desire a project management position without fully understanding what 
the job entails. Some people believe that they will be given a vast amount of authority, they 
will make any and all decisions on the project, they will have control of a small empire of 
workers which they personally hired, and they will interface with executives within and 
outside of their firm.
In reality, project management may be a lot different than some believe. Most project 
managers have very little real authority. The real authority may rest with the project spon-
sor and functional management. Some people argue that project management is actually 
leadership without authority.
Project managers may not have any say in staffing the project and may not even be 
able to fire poorly performing workers. Project staff is most commonly provided by the 
functional managers and only the functional managers can remove the workers. Projects 
managers may have no input into the wage and salary program for the employees assigned 
to the project. Employees assigned to the project may be working on several other projects 
at the same time, and the project manager may not be able to get these employees to satisfy 
his/her project’s requirements in a timely manner. Project managers may not be allowed 
to communicate with personnel external to the company. This may be done by the internal 
project sponsor.
Today’s project managers are expected to have at least a cursory understanding of the 
company’s business model as well as the company’s business processes that support pro-
ject management. Project managers are now expected to make both project- and business-
related decisions when necessary.
Some people believe that project managers make any and all decisions on a project. 
This is certainly not true. In today’s high-technology environments, project managers can-
not be experts in all areas. Their expertise may not be in any of the knowledge areas of the 
project. This is quite common when a project manager is asked to manage a technology-
based project, as discussed in Section 1.5. They must therefore rely upon the governance 
committee and team members for support in project decision making.
The project manager may have no say or input on the imposed constraints or boundary 
conditions for the project. These factors may have been made by the client or the sales force 
during competitive bidding activities and the project manager is told that he/she must live 
with these conditions. It is not uncommon for the sales force to agree to unrealistic budgets 
and schedules just to win a contract and then tell the project manager, “This is all the time 
and money we could get from the client. Live with it.”
Finally, the new project manager cannot take for granted that he or she fully under-
stands the role of the participants. Because each project will be different, the roles of 
the players and the accompanying interface can change. This is discussed in Sections 
1.6–1.10.
The characteristics of a project can change from company to company. It is important 
for the newly appointed or entry-level project managers to have a good understanding of 
what the job entails before accepting the position.

Overview 
1.5 THE TALENT TRIANGLE
Each project is inherently different, thus possibly mandating a different 
set of competencies. PMI has introduced the Talent Triangle that repre-
sents the high-level skill set that global organizations consider impor-
tant for project management practitioners. The Talent Triangle includes:
●
●
Technical Project Management
●
●
Leadership
●
●
Strategic and Business Management
The components of the three skill areas can change between project, program, and 
portfolio management activities. Technical project management and leadership have 
been discussed briefly in this chapter and will be discussed in more depth throughout 
the book.
Strategic and business management is relatively new for many project managers. 
In some companies, the responsibility for strategic and business decisions rests solely 
with the project sponsor. In these situations, the project manager’s primary role is to 
produce a deliverable and most often a technical deliverable. How the deliverable will 
be used and whether or not it provided value to the firm is determined by the project 
sponsor.
In today’s world, project managers must be strategic and business oriented. Project 
managers today are managing more than just a project. They view themselves as managing 
part of a business rather than just a project and thus are expected to make both project 
technical and business decisions. The tools that the project manager uses, specifically the 
project management methodologies, are embedded with business processes rather than 
merely pure project management processes.
The words “business value” could become the most important words in the project 
manager’s vocabulary. The outcome of a project is no longer just a deliverable; rather, 
it is now focusing more on the creation of sustainable business value. Project success is 
now the creation of sustainable business value rather than merely meeting certain imposed 
constraints. All through this chapter we focused on the importance of value, and this trend 
is expected to increase.
1.6 TECHNOLOGY-BASED PROJECTS
Technology-based projects are often considered the most diffi-
cult projects to manage, especially for entry-level project manag-
ers. There is a high degree of complexity, innovation is required, 
the risks are most often greater than with traditional projects, and the solution requires 
experimentation, iterative approaches, and creativity. According to Hans Thamhain,1

Technology-Based Projects
11
In our highly connected world, most project managers must deal with technology. They 
must function in a business environment that uses technology for competitive advantage, 
and their projects are heavily steeped in technology. Virtually every segment of industry 
and government tries to leverage technology to improve effectiveness, value, and speed. 
Traditional linear work processes and top-down controls are no longer sufficient but are 
gradually being replaced by alternative organizational designs and new, more agile man-
agement techniques and business processes, such as concurrent engineering, design-build, 
stage-gate, and user-centered design. These techniques offer more sophisticated capabilities 
for cross-functional integration, resource mobility, effectiveness, and market responsive-
ness, but they also require more sophisticated skills to effectively deal with a broad spec-
trum of contemporary challenges, both technically and socially, including higher levels of 
conflict, change, risks, uncertainty, and a shifting attention from functional efficiency to 
process integration effectiveness, emphasizing organizational interfaces, human factors, 
and the overall business process. Taken together, technology-intensive projects can be 
characterized as follows:
●
●
Value creation by applying technology
●
●
Strong need for innovation and creativity
●
●
High task complexities, risk, and uncertainties
●
●
Resource constraints and tight end-date-driven schedules despite tough performance 
requirements
●
●
Highly educated and skilled personnel, broad skill spectrum
●
●
Specific technical job knowledge and competency
●
●
Need for sophisticated people skills, ability to work across different organizational cultures 
and values, and to deal with organizational conflict, power, and politics
●
●
Complex project organizations and cross-functional linkages
●
●
Complex business processes and stakeholder communities
●
●
Technology used as a tool for managing projects
●
●
Replacement of labor with technology
●
●
Advanced infrastructure
●
●
High front-end expenditures early in the project life cycle
●
●
Low short-term profitability in spite of large capital investment
●
●
Fast-changing markets, technology, and regulations
●
●
Intense global competition, open markets, and low barriers to entry
●
●
Short product life cycles that affect time to market
●
●
Need for quick market response
●
●
Complex decision-making processes
●
●
Many alliances, joint ventures, and partnerships
1.7 THE PROJECT MANAGER–LINE MANAGER INTERFACE
We have stated that the project manager must control company resources 
within time, cost, and performance. Most companies have six resources:
●
●
Money
●
●
Employees
PMBOK ® Guide, 6th Edition

Information/technology
Actually, the project manager does not control any of these resources directly, except 
perhaps money (i.e., the project budget).2 Resources are controlled by the line manag-
ers, functional managers, or, as they are often called, resources managers. Project manag-
ers must, therefore, negotiate with line managers for all project resources. When we say 
that project managers control project resources, we really mean that they control those 
resources (which are temporarily loaned to them) through line managers.
Today, we have a new breed of project manager. Years ago, virtually all project managers 
were engineers with advanced degrees. These people had a command of technology rather 
than merely an understanding of technology. If the line manager believed that the project 
manager did in fact possess a command of technology, then the line manager would allow the 
assigned functional employees to take direction from the project manager. The result was that 
project managers were expected to manage people.
Most project managers today have an understanding of technology rather than a 
command of technology. As a result, the accountability for the success of the project 
is now viewed as shared accountability between the project manager and all affected 
line managers. With shared accountability, the line managers must now have a good 
understanding of project management, which is why more line managers are becoming 
PMP® credential holders. Project managers are now expected to focus more so on man-
aging the project’s deliverables rather than providing technical direction to the project 
team. Management of the assigned resources is more often than not a line function.
Another important fact is that project managers are treated as though they are managing 
part of a business rather than simply a project, and thus are expected to make sound business 
decisions as well as project decisions. Project managers must understand business principles. 
In the future, project managers may be expected to become externally certified by PMI and 
internally certified by their company on the organization’s business processes.
In recent years, the rapid acceleration of technology has forced the project manager to 
become more business oriented.
It should become obvious at this point that successful project management is strongly 
dependent on:
●
●
A good daily working relationship between the project manager and those line 
managers who directly assign resources to projects
●
●
The ability of functional employees to report vertically to line managers at the 
same time that they report horizontally to one or more project managers
These two items become critical. In the first item, functional employees who are 
assigned to a project manager still take technical direction from their line managers. Second, 
2.  Here we are assuming that the line manager and project manager are not the same individual. However, the 
terms line manager and functional manager are used interchangeably throughout the text.

Defining The Project Manager’s Role
13
employees who report to multiple managers will always favor the manager who controls 
their purse strings. Thus, most project managers appear always to be at the mercy of the line 
managers.
If we take a close look at project management, the project manager actually works 
for the line managers, not vice versa. Many executives do not realize this. They have a 
tendency to put a halo around the head of the project manager and give him a bonus at 
project completion when, in fact, the credit should be shared with the line managers, who 
are continually pressured to make better use of their resources while meeting the project’s 
constraints. The project manager is simply the agent through whom this is accomplished. 
So why do some companies glorify the project management position?
When the project management–line management relationship begins to deteriorate, 
the project almost always suffers. Executives must promote a good working relationship 
between line and project management. One of the most common ways of destroying this 
relationship is by asking, “Who contributes to profits—the line or project manager?” Pro-
ject managers feel that they control all project profits because they control the budget. The 
line managers, on the other hand, argue that they must staff with appropriately budgeted-
for personnel, supply the resources at the desired time, and supervise performance. Actu-
ally, both the vertical and horizontal lines contribute to profits. These types of conflicts can 
destroy the entire project management system.
Effective project management requires an understanding of quantitative tools and 
techniques, organizational structures, and organizational behavior.
Most people understand the quantitative tools for planning, scheduling, and control-
ling work. It is imperative that project managers understand totally the operations of each 
line organization. In addition, project managers must understand their own job description, 
especially where their authority begins and ends.
Organizational behavior is important because the functional employees at the interface 
position find themselves reporting to more than one boss—a line manager and one project 
manager for each project they are assigned to. Executives must provide proper training so 
functional employees can report effectively to multiple managers.
1.8 DEFINING THE PROJECT MANAGER’S ROLE
The project manager is responsible for coordinating and integrating 
activities across multiple functional lines. The integration activities 
performed by the project manager include:
●
●
Integrating the activities necessary to develop a project plan
●
●
Integrating the activities necessary to execute the plan
●
●
Integrating the activities necessary to make changes to the plan
These integrative responsibilities are shown in Figure 1–4, where the project man-
ager must convert the inputs (i.e., resources) into outputs of products, services, and ulti-
mately profits. In order to do this, the project manager needs strong communicative and

Overview 
interpersonal skills, must become familiar with the operations of each line organization, 
and must have knowledge of the technology being used.
An executive with a computer manufacturer stated that his com-
pany was looking externally for project managers. When asked if he 
expected candidates to have a command of computer technology, the 
executive remarked, “You give me an individual who has good com-
municative skills and interpersonal skills, and I’ll give that individual a job. I can teach 
people the technology and give them technical experts to assist them in decision making. 
But I cannot teach somebody how to work with people.”
The project manager’s job is not an easy one. Project managers may have increasing 
responsibility, but very little authority. This lack of authority can force them to “negotiate” 
with upper-level management as well as functional management for control of company 
resources. They may often be treated as outsiders by the formal organization.
In the project environment, everything seems to revolve about the project manager.
Although the project organization is a specialized, task-oriented entity, it cannot exist 
apart from the traditional structure of the organization. The project manager, therefore, 
must walk the fence between the two organizations. The term interface management is 
often used for this role, which can be described as managing relationships:
●
●
Within the project team
●
●
Between the project team and the functional organizations
●
●
Between the project team and senior management
●
●
Between the project team and the customer’s organization, whether an internal or 
external organization
The project manager is actually a general manager and gets to know the total opera-
tion of the company. In fact, project managers get to know more about the total operation 
of a company than most executives. That is why project management is often used as a 
training ground to prepare future general managers who will be capable of filling top 
management positions.

Defining The Functional Manager’s Role
15
1.9 DEFINING THE FUNCTIONAL MANAGER’S ROLE
Assuming that the project and functional managers are not the same 
person, we can identify a specific role for the functional manager. 
There are three elements to this role:
●
●
The functional manager has the responsibility to define how 
the task will be done and where the task will be done (i.e., 
the technical criteria).
●
●
The functional manager has the responsibility to provide sufficient resources to accom-
plish the objective within the project’s constraints (i.e., who will get the job done).
●
●
The functional manager has the responsibility for the deliverable.
In other words, once the project manager identifies the requirements for the project (i.e., 
what work has to be done and the constraints), it becomes the line manager’s responsibility to 
identify the technical criteria. Except perhaps in R&D efforts, the line manager should be the 
recognized technical expert. If the line manager believes that certain technical portions of the 
project manager’s requirements are unsound, then the line manager has the right, by virtue of 
his expertise, to take exception and plead his case to a higher authority.
In Section 1.1 we stated that all resources (including personnel) are controlled by the line 
manager. The project manager has the right to request specific staff, but the final appointments 
rest with line managers. It helps if project managers understand the line manager’s problems:
●
●
Unlimited work requests (especially during competitive bidding)
●
●
Predetermined deadlines
●
●
All requests having a high priority
●
●
Limited number of resources
●
●
Limited availability of resources
●
●
Unscheduled changes in the project plan
●
●
Unpredicted lack of progress
●
●
Unplanned absence of resources
●
●
Unplanned breakdown of resources
●
●
Unplanned loss of resources
●
●
Unplanned turnover of personnel
Only in a very few industries will the line manager be able to identify to the project 
manager in advance exactly what resources will be available when the project is scheduled 
to begin. It is not important for the project manager to have the best available resources. 
Functional managers should not commit to certain people’s availability. Rather, the func-
tional manager should commit to achieving his portion of the deliverables within time, 
cost, and performance even if he has to use average or below-average personnel. If the pro-
ject manager is unhappy with the assigned functional resources, then the project manager 
should closely track that portion of the project. Only if and when the project manager is 
convinced by the evidence that the assigned resources are unacceptable should he confront 
the line manager and demand better resources.

Overview 
The fact that a project manager is assigned does not relieve the line manager of his 
functional responsibility to perform. If a functional manager assigns resources such that the 
constraints are not met, then both the project and functional managers will be blamed. Some 
companies are even considering evaluating line managers for merit increases and promotion 
based on how often they have lived up to their commitments to the project managers.

2.4.4 Organizational Structure Types
Therefore, it is extremely valuable to everyone concerned to have all project commit-
ments made visible to all.
Project management is designed to have shared authority and responsibility between the 
project and line managers. Project managers plan, monitor, and control the project, whereas 
functional managers perform the work. Table 1–1 shows this shared responsibility. The one 
exception to Table 1–1 occurs when the project and line managers are the same person. This 
situation, which happens more often than not, creates a conflict of interest. If a line manager 
has to assign resources to six projects, one of which is under his direct control, he might save 
the best resources for his project. In this case, his project will be a success at the expense of 
all of the other projects.
The exact relationship between project and line managers is of paramount importance in 
project management where multiple-boss reporting prevails. Table 1–2 shows that the relation-
ship between project and line managers is not always in balance and 
thus, of course, has a bearing on who exerts more influence over the 
assigned functional employees.

Working with Executives
17
1.10 DEFINING THE FUNCTIONAL EMPLOYEE’S ROLE
Once the line managers commit to the deliverables, it is the responsibility of the assigned 
functional employees to achieve the functional deliverables.
In most organizations, the assigned employees report on a “solid” line to their func-
tional manager, even though they may be working on several projects simultaneously. The 
employees are usually a “dotted” line to the project but solid to their function. This places 
the employees in the often awkward position of reporting to multiple individuals. This situ-
ation is further complicated when the project manager has more technical knowledge than 
the line manager. This occurs during R&D projects.
The functional employee is expected to accomplish the following activities when 
assigned to projects:
●
●
Accept responsibility for accomplishing the assigned deliverables within the pro-
ject’s constraints
●
●
Complete the work at the earliest possible time
●
●
Periodically inform both the project and line manager of the project’s status
●
●
Bring problems to the surface quickly for resolution
●
●
Share information with the rest of the project team
1.11 DEFINING THE EXECUTIVE’S ROLE
In a project environment there are new expectations of and for the 
executives, as well as a new interfacing role.3 Executives are expected 
to interface a project as follows:
●
●
In project planning and objective setting
●
●
In conflict resolution
●
●
In priority setting
●
●
As project sponsor4
Executives are expected to interface with projects very closely at project initiation and 
planning, but to remain at a distance during execution unless needed for priority setting and 
conflict resolution. One reason why executives “meddle” during project execution is that 
they are not getting accurate information from the project manager about project status. 
If project managers provide executives with meaningful status reports, then the so-called 
meddling may be reduced or even eliminated.
1.12 WORKING WITH EXECUTIVES
Success in project management is like a three-legged stool. The first leg is the project man-
ager, the second leg is the line manager, and the third leg is senior management. If any of 
the three legs fail, the stool will topple.

18
Overview 
The critical node in project management is the project manager–line manager inter-
face. At this interface, the project and line managers must view each other as equals and 
be willing to share authority, responsibility, and accountability. In excellently managed 
companies, project managers do not negotiate for resources but simply ask for the line 
manager’s commitment to executing his portion of the work within time, cost, and perfor-
mance. Therefore, it should not matter who the line manager assigns as long as the line 
manager lives up to his commitments.
Since the project and line managers are “equals,” senior management involvement is nec-
essary to provide advice and guidance to the project manager, as well as to provide encourage-
ment to the line managers to keep their promises. When executives act in this capacity, they 
assume the role of project sponsors, as shown in Figure 1–5,5 which also shows that sponsorship 
need not always be at the executive levels. The exact person appointed as the project sponsor 
is based on the dollar value of the project, the priority of the project, and who the customer is.
The ultimate objective of the project sponsor is to provide behind-the-scenes assistance 
to project personnel for projects both “internal” to the company, as well as “external,” as 
shown in Figure 1–5. Projects can still be successful without this commitment and support, 
as long as all work flows smoothly. But in time of crisis, having a 
“big brother” available as a possible sounding board will surely help.
When an executive is required to act as a project sponsor, then 
the executive has the responsibility to make effective and timely 
project decisions. To accomplish this, the executive needs timely,

accurate, and complete data for such decisions. Keeping management informed serves this 
purpose, while the all-too-common practice of “stonewalling” prevents an executive from 
making effective project decisions.
It is not necessary for project sponsorship to remain exclusively at the executive levels. 
As companies mature in their understanding and implementation of project management, 
project sponsorship may be pushed down to middle-level management. Committee spon-
sorship is also possible.
1.13 COMMITTEE SPONSORSHIP/GOVERNANCE
All projects have the potential of getting into trouble but, in general, project management 
can work well as long as the project’s requirements do not impose severe pressure upon the 
project manager and a project sponsor exists as an ally to assist the project manager when 
trouble does appear.
Project problems requiring executive-level support may not be able to be resolved, at least 
easily and in a timely manner, by a single project sponsor. These problems can be resolved 
using effective project governance. Project governance is actually a framework by which 
decisions are made. Governance relates to decisions that define expectations, accountability, 
responsibility, the granting of power, or verifying performance. Governance relates to consist-
ent management, cohesive policies, and processes and decision-making rights for a given area 
of responsibility. Governance enables efficient and effective decision making to take place.
Every project can have different governance even if each project uses the same enter-
prise project management methodology. The governance function can operate as a separate 
process or as part of project management leadership. Governance is designed not to replace 
project decision making but to prevent undesirable decisions from being made.
Historically, governance was provided by a single project sponsor. Today, governance is 
a committee and can include representatives from each stakeholder’s organization. Table 1–3

Dispersed locally

the project’s complexity.

Overview 
shows various governance approaches based upon the type of project team. The member-
ship of the committee can change from project to project and industry to industry. The 
membership may also vary based upon the number of stakeholders and whether the pro-
ject is for an internal or external client. On long-term projects, membership can change 
throughout the project.
Governance on projects and programs sometimes fails because people confuse project 
governance with corporate governance. The result is that members of the committee are not 
sure what their role should be. Some of the major differences include:
●
●
Alignment: Corporate governance focuses on how well the portfolio of projects is 
aligned to and satisfies overall business objectives. Project governance focuses on 
ways to keep a project on track.
●
●
Direction: Corporate governance provides strategic direction with a focus on how 
project success will satisfy corporate objectives. Project governance is more oper-
ation direction with decisions based upon the predefined parameters on project 
scope, time, cost, and functionality.
●
●
Dashboards: Corporate governance dashboards are based upon financial, market-
ing, and sales metrics. Project governance dashboards have operations metrics on 
time, cost, scope, quality, action items, risks, and deliverables.
●
●
Membership: Corporate governance committees are composed of the seniormost 
levels of management. Project government membership may include some mem-
bership from middle management.
Another reason why failure may occur is when members of the project or program 
governance group do not understand project or program management. This can lead to 
micromanagement by the governance committee. There is always the question of what 
decisions must be made by the governance committee and what decisions the project man-
ager can make. In general, the project manager should have the authority for decisions 
related to actions necessary to maintain the baselines. Governance committees must have 
the authority to approve scope changes above a certain dollar value and to make decisions 
necessary to align the project to corporate objectives and strategy.
1.14 THE PROJECT MANAGER AS THE PLANNING AGENT
The major responsibility of the project manager is planning. If pro-
ject planning is performed correctly, then it is conceivable that the 
project manager will work himself out of a job because the project 
can run itself. This rarely happens, however. Few projects are ever completed without some 
conflict or trade-offs for the project manager to resolve.
In most cases, the project manager provides overall or summary definitions of the 
work to be accomplished, but the line managers (the true experts) do the detailed plan-
ning. Although project managers cannot control or assign line resources, they must 
make sure that the resources are adequate and scheduled to satisfy the needs of the 
PMBOK ® Guide, 6th Edition
Chapter 9 Project Resource Management

project, not vice versa. As the architect of the project plan, the project manager must 
provide:
●
●
Complete task definitions
●
●
Resource requirement definitions (possibly skill levels)
●
●
Major timetable milestones
●
●
Definition of end-item quality and reliability requirements
●
●
The basis for performance measurement
●
●
Definition of project success
These factors, if properly established, result in:
●
●
Assurance that functional units will understand their total responsibilities toward 
achieving project needs
●
●
Assurance that problems resulting from scheduling and allocation of critical 
resources are known beforehand
●
●
Early identification of problems that may jeopardize successful project completion 
so that effective corrective action and replanning can be taken to prevent or resolve 
the problems
Project managers are responsible for project administration and, therefore, must have the 
right to establish their own policies, procedures, rules, guidelines, and directives—provided 
these policies, guidelines, and so on conform to overall company policy. Companies with 
mature project management structures usually have rather loose company guidelines, so 
project managers have some degree of flexibility in how to control their projects.
Establishing project administrative requirements is part of project planning. Execu-
tives must either work with the project managers at project initiation or act as resources 
later. Improper project administrative planning can create a situation that requires:

A continuous revision and/or establishment of company and/or project policies, 
procedures, and directives
●
●
A continuous shifting in organizational responsibility and possible unnecessary 
restructuring
●
●
A need for staff to acquire new knowledge and skills
If these situations occur simultaneously on several projects, there can be confusion 
throughout the organization.
1.15 PROJECT CHAMPIONS
Corporations encourage employees to think up new ideas that, if approved by the corporation, 
will generate monetary and nonmonetary rewards for the idea generator. One such reward 
is naming the individual the “project champion.” Unfortunately, the project champion often 
becomes the project manager, and, although the idea was technically sound, the project fails.

22
Overview 
Table 1–4 provides a comparison between project managers and project champions. It 
shows that the project champions may become so attached to the technical side of the pro-
ject that they become derelict in their administrative responsibilities. Perhaps the project 
champion might function best as a project engineer rather than the project manager.
This comparison does not mean that technically oriented project managers-champions 
will fail. Rather, it implies that the selection of the “proper” project manager should be 
based on all facets of the project.
1.16 PROJECT-DRIVEN VERSUS NON–PROJECT-DRIVEN ORGANIZATIONS
On the micro level, virtually all organizations are either market-
ing-, engineering-, or manufacturing-driven. But on the macro level, 
organizations are either project- or non–project-driven. The PMBOK ® 
Guide uses the terms project-based and non–project-based, whereas in this text the terms 
project-driven and non–project-driven or operational-driven are used. In a project-driven 
organization, such as construction or aerospace, all work is characterized through projects, 
with each project as a separate cost center having its own profit-and-loss statement. The 
total profit to the corporation is simply the summation of the profits on all projects. In a 
project-driven organization, everything centers on the projects.
In the non–project-driven organization, such as low-technology manufacturing, profit 
and loss are measured on vertical or functional lines. In this type of organization, projects 
exist merely to support the product lines or functional lines. Priority resources are assigned 
to the revenue-producing functional line activities rather than the projects. Project manage-
ment in a non–project-driven organization is generally more difficult for these reasons:
●
●
Projects may be few and far between.
●
●
Not all projects have the same project management requirements, and therefore 
they cannot be managed identically. This difficulty results from poor understanding 
of project management and a reluctance of companies to invest in proper training.
●
●
Executives do not have sufficient time to manage projects themselves, yet refuse 
to delegate authority.

Project Managers
Project Champions
• Prefer to work in groups

responsibilities
• Committed to the corporation
• Seek to achieve the objective
• Are willing to take risks
• Seek what is possible
• Think in terms of short time spans
• Manage people
• Are committed to and pursue material values
• Prefer working individually
• Committed to technology
• Committed to the profession
• Seek to exceed the objective
• Are unwilling to take risks; try to test everything
• Seek perfection
• Think in terms of long time spans
• Manage things
• Are committed to and pursue intellectual values

Project-Driven versus Non–Project-Driven Organizations
23
●
●
Projects tend to be delayed because approvals most often follow the vertical chain 
of command. As a result, project work stays too long in functional departments.
●
●
Because project staffing is on a “local” basis, only a portion of the organization 
understands project management and sees the system in action.
●
●
There is heavy dependence on subcontractors and outside agencies for project 
management expertise.
Non–project-driven organizations may also have a steady stream of projects, all of 
which are usually designed to enhance manufacturing operations. Some projects may be 
customer-requested, such as:
●
●
The introduction of statistical dimensioning concepts to improve process control
●
●
The introduction of process changes to enhance the final product
●
●
The introduction of process change concepts to enhance product reliability
If these changes are not identified as specific projects, the result can be:
●
●
Poorly defined responsibility areas within the organization
●
●
Poor communications, both internal and external to the organization
●
●
Slow implementation
●
●
A lack of a cost-tracking system for implementation
●
●
Poorly defined performance criteria

organizations but is most common in non–project-driven organizations. On the surface, all

Overview 
we see is a lack of authority for the project manager. But beneath the surface we see the 
causes: there is excessive meddling due to lack of understanding of project management, 
which, in turn, resulted from an inability to recognize the need for proper training.
1.17 MARKETING IN THE PROJECT-DRIVEN ORGANIZATION
Getting new projects is the lifeblood of any project-oriented business. 
The practices of the project-oriented company are, however, substan-
tially different from those of traditional product businesses and require 
highly specialized and disciplined team efforts among marketing, tech-
nical, and operating personnel, plus significant customer involvement. Projects are different 
from products in many respects, especially marketing. Marketing projects requires the ability 
to identify, pursue, and capture one-of-a-kind business opportunities, and is characterized by:
●
●
A systematic effort: A systematic approach is usually required to develop a new 
program lead into an actual contract. The project acquisition effort is often highly 
integrated with ongoing programs and involves key personnel from both the poten-
tial customer and the performing organization.
●
●
Custom design: While traditional businesses provide standard products and ser-
vices for a variety of applications and customers, projects are custom-designed 
items designed to fit specific requirements of a single-customer community.
●
●
Project life cycle: Project-oriented businesses have a well-defined beginning 
and end and are not self-perpetuating. Business must be generated on a pro-
ject-by-project basis rather than by creating demand for a standard product or  
service.
●
●
Marketing phase: Long lead times often exist between the product definition, start-
up, and completion phases of a project.
●
●
Risks: There are risks, especially in the research, design, and production of pro-
grams. The program manager not only has to integrate the multidisciplinary tasks 
and project elements within budget and schedule constraints, but also has to man-
age inventions and technology while working with a variety of technically ori-
ented prima donnas.
●
●
The technical capability to perform: Technical ability is critical to the successful 
pursuit and acquisition of a new project.
In spite of the risks and problems, profits on projects are usually very low in compari-
son with commercial business practices. One may wonder why companies pursue project 
businesses. Clearly, there are many reasons why projects are good business:
●
●
Although immediate profits (as a percentage of sales) are usually small, the return 
on capital investment is often very attractive. Progress payment practices keep 
inventories and receivables to a minimum and enable companies to undertake pro-
jects many times larger in value than the assets of the total company.
PMBOK ® Guide, 6th Edition
1.2.3.6 Organizational Project Manage-
ment (OPM) and Strategies

Classification of Projects
25
●
●
Once a contract has been secured and is being managed properly, the project may 
be of relatively low financial risk to the company. The company has little addi-
tional selling expenditure and has a predictable market over the life cycle of the 
project.
●
●
Project business must be viewed from a broader perspective than motivation for 
immediate profits. Projects provide an opportunity to develop the company’s tech-
nical capabilities and build an experience base for future business growth.
●
●
Winning one large project often provides attractive growth potential, such as (1) 
growth with the project via additions and changes; (2) follow-on work; (3) spare 
parts, maintenance, and training; and (4) being able to compete effectively in the 
next project phase, such as nurturing a study program into a development contract 
and finally a production contract.
Customers come in various forms and sizes. For small and medium businesses par-
ticularly, it is a challenge to compete for contracts from large industrial or governmental 
organizations. Although the contract to a firm may be relatively small, it is often subcon-
tracted via a larger organization. Selling to such a diversified heterogeneous customer is a 
marketing challenge that requires a highly sophisticated and disciplined approach.
The first step in a new business development effort is to define the market to be pur-
sued. The market segment for a new program opportunity is normally in an area of relevant 
past experience, technical capability, and customer involvement. Good marketers in the 
program business have to think as product line managers. They have to understand all 
dimensions of the business and be able to define and pursue market objectives that are 
consistent with the capabilities of their organizations.
Program businesses operate in an opportunity-driven market. It is a common mistake, 
however, to believe that these markets are unpredictable and unmanageable. Market plan-
ning and strategizing is important. New project opportunities develop over periods of time, 
sometimes years for larger projects. These developments must be properly tracked and 
cultivated to form the bases for management actions such as (1) bid decisions, (2) resource 
commitment, (3) technical readiness, and (4) effective customer liaison.
1.18 CLASSIFICATION OF PROJECTS
The principles of project management can be applied to any type of project and to any 
industry. However, the relative degree of importance of these principles can vary from 
project to project and industry to industry. Table 1–5 shows a brief comparison of certain 
industries/projects.
For those industries that are project-driven, such as aerospace and large construc-
tion, the high dollar value of the projects mandates a much more rigorous project man-
agement approach. For non–project-driven industries, projects may be managed more 
informally than formally, especially if no immediate profit is involved. Informal project 
management is similar to formal project management but paperwork requirements are 
kept at a minimum.

26
Overview 
1.19 LOCATION OF THE PROJECT MANAGER
The success of project management could easily depend on the location of the project man-
ager within the organization. Two questions must be answered:
●
●
What salary should the project manager earn?
●
●
To whom should the project manager report?
Figure 1–7 shows a typical organizational hierarchy. Ideally, the project manager 
should be at the same pay grade as the individuals with whom he must negotiate on a daily 
basis. A project manager earning substantially more or less money than the line manager 
will usually create conflict. The ultimate reporting location of the project manager (and 
perhaps his salary) is heavily dependent on whether the organization is project- or non–
project-driven, and whether the project manager is responsible for profit or loss.
Project managers can end up reporting both high and low in an organization during the 
life cycle of the project. During the planning phase of the project, the project manager may 
report high, whereas during implementation, he may report low. Likewise, the positioning 
of the project manager may be dependent on the risk of the project, the size of the project, 
or the customer.
Finally, it should be noted that even if the project manager reports low, he should 
still have the right to interface with top executives during project planning, although there 
may be two or more reporting levels between the project manager and executives. At the

Differing Views of Project Management
27
opposite end of the spectrum, the project manager should have the right to go directly into 
the depths of the organization instead of having to follow the chain of command downward, 
especially during planning.
1.20 DIFFERING VIEWS OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT
Many companies, especially those with project-driven organizations, have differing views 
of project management. Some people view project management as an excellent means to 
achieving objectives, while others view it as a threat. In project-driven organizations, there 
are three career paths that lead to executive management:
●
●
Through project management
●
●
Through project engineering
●
●
Through line management

28
Overview 
A project engineer is often a person who performs project management coordination 
and integration activities for primarily engineering activities and may be restricted to just 
engineering work. There may also be manufacturing engineers that handle only that portion 
of the project that is in manufacturing.
In project-driven organizations, the fast-track position is in project management, 
whereas in a non–project-driven organization, it would be line management. Even though 
line managers support the project management approach, they resent the project manager 
because of his promotions and top-level visibility. In one construction company, a depart-
ment manager was told that he had no chance for promotion above his present department 
manager position unless he went into project management or project engineering where he 
could get to know the operation of the whole company. A second construction company 
requires that individuals aspiring to become a department manager first spend a “tour of 
duty” as an assistant project manager or project engineer.
Executives may dislike project managers because more authority and control must be 
delegated. However, once executives realize that it is a sound business practice, it becomes 
important.
1.21 PUBLIC-SECTOR PROJECT MANAGEMENT
For several decades, public-sector projects were managed by contractors whose primary 
objective was a profit motive. Many times, contractors would make trade-offs and accom-
panying decisions just to support the profit motive. At the end of the project, the contractor 
would provide the public-sector agency with a deliverable, but the contractor would walk 
away with the project management best practices and lessons learned.
Today, public-sector agencies are requesting the contractor to share with them all pro-
ject management intellectual property accumulated during the course of the project. Also, 
more agencies are becoming experienced in project management to the point where the 
projects are managed with internal personnel rather than contractors.
As more and more government agencies adopt the project management approach, we 
discover that public-sector projects can be more complex than private-sector projects and 
more difficult to manage.
THE CHALLENGES OF PUBLIC-SECTOR PROJECT MANAGEMENT 
Private-sector project managers like to assume that their work is more demanding than 
projects in the public sector. They assume that their projects are more complex, subject 
to tougher management oversight, and mandated to move at faster speeds. Although 
private-sector projects can be tough, in many cases, it is easier to accomplish results in 
the private sector than in the public sector.

Public-sector Project Management
29
Public-sector projects can be more difficult than many private-sector projects 
because they:
●
●
Operate in an environment of often-conflicting goals and outcome
●
●
Involve many layers of stakeholders with varied interests
●
●
Must placate political interests and operate under media scrutiny
●
●
Are allowed little tolerance for failure
●
●
Operate in organizations that often have a difficult time identifying outcome 
measures and missions
●
●
Are required to be performed under constraints imposed by administrative 
rules and often-cumbersome policies and processes that can delay projects and 
consume project resources
●
●
Require the cooperation and performance of agencies outside of the project 
team for purchasing, hiring, and other functions
●
●
Must make do with existing staff resources more often than private-sector 
projects because of civil-service protections and hiring systems
●
●
Are performed in organizations that may not be comfortable or used to directed 
action and project success
●
●
Are performed in an environment that may include political adversaries
If these challenges were not tough enough, because of their ability to push the 
burden of paying for projects to future generations, public-sector projects have a reach 
deep into the future.1 That introduces the challenges of serving the needs of stakeholders 
who are not yet “at the table” and whose interests might be difficult to identify. Some 
also cite the relative lack of project management maturity in public organizations as a 
challenge of public-sector projects.
In addition to these complications, public projects are often more complex than 
those in the private sector. For some projects, the outcome can be defined at the be-
ginning of the project. Construction projects are one example. For other projects, the 
desired outcome can only be defined as the project progresses. Examples of those are 
organizational change projects and complex information technology projects. Although 
the first type of project can be difficult and require detailed planning and implementa-
tion, the second type, those whose outcomes are determined over the course of the pro-
ject, are regarded as more challenging. They require more interaction with stakeholders 
and more openness to factors outside of the control of the project team.
Because of the multiple stakeholders involved in public-sector projects, the types 
of projects the public sector engages in, and the difficulty of identifying measurable 
outcomes in the public sector, more public-sector projects are likely to be of the latter 
variety and more difficult. As a result of the distinguishing characteristics of public-
sector organizations, public-sector projects require the management not only of the pro-
ject team but of an entire community. Little is accomplished in the public sector by lone 
individuals or even by teams working in isolation. Instead, public-sector projects engage 
1.  Project Management Institute, Government Extension to the PMBOK® Guide Third Edition, 2006, p. 15.

30
Overview 
broad groups of stakeholders who not only have a stake in the project but also have a 
voice and an opportunity to influence outcomes. In public-sector projects, even though 
the project manager may be ultimately accountable, governance of the project and credit 
for successes must be shared.
The good news for public-sector project managers is that the community of stake-
holders, which may seem to be a burden, can also be an opportunity and a source of 
resources and support. Many of those stakeholders stand ready to provide help to the 
project manager as he or she attempts to navigate the constraints affecting the project. 
Others can be enlisted to support the project, and their authority can make the difference 
between project success and failure.
THE COMING STORM
In addition to the existing challenges of public-sector projects listed previously, some 
factors will place soon more stress on public-sector organizations and demand even 
more emphasis on solid project management. Some of the emerging challenges for 
public-sector organizations will include:
●
●
Modest or stagnant economic growth
●
●
Globalization and the loss of the industrial revenue base and, increasingly, the 
service-sector revenue base
●
●
A decline in real wages and pressures for tax reform
●
●
Private-sector practices that pass the corporate safety net back to individuals, 
who may then look to government for such essential security mechanisms as 
health coverage
●
●
Difficulty in passing on the need for government revenue to taxpayers and a 
general loss of confidence in government
●
●
Structural limitations on revenue generation, such as Proposition 13 and 
property tax indexing
●
●
The redirection of scarce public revenues to homeland security and defense 
without the imposition of war taxes
●
●
The erosion of public-sector income as entitlement programs drain revenues in 
response to an aging population
●
●
An age imbalance, with fewer workers in the workforce to support an expanding 
number of retirees and children
●
●
Longer life expectancy, which further burdens entitlement and health programs
●
●
Increasing costs of health care well beyond the level of inflation
●
●
Long-delayed investments in our national infrastructure, including roads, 
bridges and water systems
In combination, these factors constitute a looming storm that will require us to 
question our assumptions about government operations and services. Doing far more 

International Project Management
31
with much less will require new thinking about how government performs its work. It 
will require more innovation than the development of new services. It will take radical 
rethinking of what government does and how it goes about getting it done.
WHY DO PUBLIC-SECTOR PROJECTS FAIL?
Public-sector projects can fail for a set of reasons related to the unique character of 
public-sector projects. In that regard, they:
●
●
Run afoul of political processes
●
●
Lack the necessary resources because of requirements to use existing staff 
rather than to contract for the right expertise
●
●
Are constrained by civil-service rules that limit assignment of activities to 
project staff
●
●
Lose budget authorization
●
●
Lose support at the change of administration due to electoral cycles
●
●
Are overwhelmed by administrative rules and required processes for purchasing 
and hiring
●
●
Fail to satisfy oversight agencies
●
●
Adopt overly conservative approaches due to the contentious nature of the 
project environment
●
●
Are victimized by suboptimal vendors who have been selected by purchasing 
processes that are overly focused on costs or that can be influenced by factors 
that are not relevant to performance
●
●
Are compromised by the bias of public-sector managers and staff toward 
compliance over performance
●
●
Fail to identify project goals given the wide array of project stakeholders in the 
public sector and the challenges of identifying public-sector goals and metrics 
for success

1.22 INTERNATIONAL PROJECT MANAGEMENT
As the world marketplace begins to accept project management and recognizes the need 
for experienced project managers, more opportunities have become available for people 
aspiring to become project managers. The need is there and growing. According to Thomas 
Grisham:6

32
Overview 
International business and project management practice have converged in the last 10 years. 
Organizations are tending toward hiring multitalented people who are self-motivated, intel-
ligent, and willing to take responsibility. Some of the reasons are:
●
●
The need for leaner and flatter organizations to reduce cost
●
●
The need for leadership skills throughout the organizational food chain from top to 
bottom—lead one day, follow the next, and be comfortable personally in either role
●
●
The need for knowledge workers throughout the organization
●
●
Globalization and the need to improve quality while reducing cost
●
●
Kaizen to keep quality high while reducing cost
●
●
Diversity
Years ago, companies had three pay grades for project managers; junior project managers, 
project managers, and senior project managers. Today, we are adding in a fourth pay grade, 
namely global project managers. Unfortunately, there may be additional skills needed to be a 
global project manager. Some of the additional skills include managing virtual teams, under-
standing global cultural differences, working in an environment where politics can dictate 
many of the decisions, and working under committee governance rather than a single sponsor.
1.23 CONCURRENT ENGINEERING: A PROJECT MANAGEMENT APPROACH
In the past decade, organizations have become more aware of the fact that America’s most 
formidable weapon is its manufacturing ability, and yet more and more work seems to be 
departing for Southeast Asia and the Far East. If America and other countries are to remain 
competitive, then survival may depend on the manufacturing of a quality product and a 
rapid introduction into the marketplace. Today, companies are under tremendous pressure 
to rapidly introduce new products because product life cycles are becoming shorter. As a 
result, organizations no longer have the luxury of performing work in series.
Concurrent or simultaneous engineering is an attempt to accomplish work in parallel rather 
than in series. This requires that marketing, R&D, engineering, and production are all actively 
involved in the early project phases and making plans even before the product design has been 
finalized. This concept of current engineering will accelerate product development, but it does 
come with serious and potentially costly risks, the largest one being the cost of rework.
Almost everyone agrees that the best way to reduce or minimize risks is for the organi-
zation to plan better. Since project management is one of the best methodologies to foster 
better planning, it is little wonder that more organizations are accepting project manage-
ment as a way of life.
1.24 ADDED VALUE
People often wonder what project managers do with their time once the project plan is cre-
ated. While it is true that they monitor and control the work being performed, they also look 
for ways to add value to the project. Added value can be defined as incremental improvements 

Studying Tips for the PMI® Project Management Certification Exam
33
to the deliverable of a project such that performance is improved or a significant business 
advantage is obtained, and the client is willing to pay for this difference. Looking for added-
value opportunities that benefit the client is a good approach whereas looking for “fictitious” 
added-value opportunities just to increase the cost of the project is bad.
In certain projects, such as in new product development in the pharmaceutical indus-
try, project managers must be aware of opportunities. According to Trevor Brown and Ste-
phen Allport:7
The critical issues facing companies which understand the importance of building cus-
tomer value into new products is how to incorporate this into the development process and 
invest appropriately to fully understand the opportunity. In practice, project teams have 
more opportunity than is generally realized to add, enhance, or diminish value in each of 
the four perspectives . . . corporate, prescriber, payer and patient. The tools at the project 
teams’ disposal to enhance customer value include challenging and improving established 
processes, adopting a value-directed approach to the management of development projects, 
and taking advantage of tried and tested methodologies for understanding product value.
Project managers generally do not take enough time in evaluating opportunities. In 
such a case, either the scope change is disapproved or the scope change is allowed and sud-
denly the project is at risk when additional information is discovered. Opportunities must 
be fully understood.

WILLIAMS MACHINE TOOL COMPANY
For 85 years, the Williams Machine Tool Company had provided high-quality products to its 
clients, becoming the third largest U.S.-based machine tool company by 1990. The company 
was highly profitable and had an extremely low employee turnover rate. Pay and benefits were 
excellent.
Between 1980 and 1990, the company’s profits soared to record levels. The company’s suc-
cess was due to one product line of standard manufacturing machine tools. Williams spent most 
of its time and effort looking for ways to improve its bread-and-butter product line rather than 
to develop new products. The product line was so successful that companies were willing to 
modify their production lines around these machine tools rather than asking Williams for major 
modifications to the machine tools.
By 1990, Williams Company was extremely complacent, expecting this phenomenal suc-
cess with one product line to continue for 20 to 25 more years. The recession of the early 1990s 
forced management to realign their thinking. Cutbacks in production had decreased the demand 
for the standard machine tools. More and more customers were asking for either major modifi-
cations to the standard machine tools or a completely new product design.
The marketplace was changing and senior management recognized that a new strategic 
focus was necessary. However, lower-level management and the work force, especially engi-
neering, were strongly resisting a change. The employees, many of them with over 20 years of 
employment at Williams Company, refused to recognize the need for this change in the belief 
that the glory days of yore would return at the end of the recession.
By 1995, the recession had been over for at least two years yet Williams Company had no 
new product lines. Revenue was down, sales for the standard product (with and without modifica-
tions) were decreasing, and the employees were still resisting change. Layoffs were imminent.
In 1996, the company was sold to Crock Engineering. Crock had an experienced ma-
chine tool division of its own and understood the machine tool business. Williams Company 
was allowed to operate as a separate entity from 1995 to 1996. By 1996, red ink had ap-
peared on the Williams Company balance sheet. Crock replaced all of the Williams senior 
managers with its own personnel. Crock then announced to all employees that Williams 
would become a specialty machine tool manufacturer and that the “good old days” would 
never return. Customer demand for specialty products had increased threefold in just the last 
twelve months alone. Crock made it clear that employees who would not support this new 
direction would be replaced.
The new senior management at Williams Company recognized that 85 years of traditional 
management had come to an end for a company now committed to specialty products. The com-
pany culture was about to change, spearheaded by project management, concurrent engineering, 
and total quality management.

Overview 
Senior management’s commitment to product management was apparent by the time and 
money spent in educating the employees. Unfortunately, the seasoned 20-year-plus veterans 
still would not support the new culture. Recognizing the problems, management provided 
continuous and visible support for project management in addition to hiring a project man-
agement consultant to work with the people. The consultant worked with Williams from 1996 
to 2001.
From 1996 to 2001, the Williams Division of Crock Engineering experienced losses in 24 
consecutive quarters. The quarter ending March 31, 2002, was the first profitable quarter in over 
six years. Much of the credit was given to the performance and maturity of the project manage-
ment system. In May 2002, the Williams Division was sold. More than 80% of the employees 
lost their jobs when the company was relocated over 1,500 miles away.

2.0 INTRODUCTION
The growth and acceptance of project management has changed 
­significantly over the past forty years, and these changes are expected 
to continue well into the twenty-first century, especially in the area of 
global project management.
The growth of project management can be traced through topics 
such as roles and responsibilities, organizational structures, delega-
tion of authority and decision making, and especially corporate profitability. Twenty years ago, companies 
had the choice of whether or not to accept the project management approach. Today, some companies fool-
ishly think that they still have the choice. Nothing could be further from the truth. The survival of the firm 
may very well rest upon how well project management is implemented, and how quickly.
2.1 THE EVOLUTION OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT: 1945–2017
During the 1940s, line managers used the concept of over-the-fence management to man-
age projects. Each line manager, wearing the hat of a project manager, would perform 
the work necessitated by their line organization, and when completed, would throw the 
“ball” over the fence in hopes that someone would catch it. Once the ball was thrown over 
the fence, the line managers would wash their hands of any responsibility for the project 
because the ball was no longer in their yard. If a project failed, blame was placed on which-
ever line manager had the ball at that time.

Project Management Growth: Concepts and Definitions 
The problem with over-the-fence management was that the customer had no single 
contact point for questions. The filtering of information wasted precious time for both the 
customer and the contractor. Customers who wanted firsthand information had to seek out 
the manager in possession of the ball. For small projects, this was easy. But as projects 
grew in size and complexity, this became more difficult.
The Cold War arms race made it clear that the traditional use of over-the-fence man-
agement would not be acceptable to the Department of Defense (DoD). The government 
wanted a single point of contact, namely, a project manager who had total accountability 
through all project phases. The use of project management was then mandated for some 
of the smaller weapon systems such as jet fighters and tanks. NASA mandated the use of 
project management for all activities related to the space program.
By the late 1950s and early 1960s, the aerospace and defense industries were using 
project management on virtually all projects, and they were pressuring their suppliers to 
use it as well. Project management was growing, but at a relatively slow rate except for 
aerospace and defense.
Because of the vast number of contractors and subcontractors, the government 
needed standardization, especially in the planning process and the reporting of informa-
tion. The government established a life-cycle planning and control model and a cost 
monitoring system, and created a group of project management auditors to make sure 
that the government’s money was being spent as planned. These practices were to be 
used on all government programs above a certain dollar value. Private industry viewed 
these practices as an over-management cost and saw no practical value in project 
management.
The growth of project management has come about more through necessity than 
through desire. Its slow growth can be attributed mainly to lack of acceptance of the new 
management techniques necessary for its successful implementation. An inherent fear of 
the unknown acted as a deterrent for managers.
Other than aerospace, defense, and construction, the majority of the companies in the 
1960s maintained an informal method for managing projects. In informal project manage-
ment, just as the words imply, the projects were handled on an informal basis whereby 
the authority of the project manager was minimized. Most projects were handled by func-
tional managers and stayed in one or two functional lines, and formal communications 
were either unnecessary or handled informally because of the good working relationships 
between line managers. Many organizations today, such as low-technology manufacturing, 
have line managers who have been working side by side for ten or more years. In such 
situations, informal project management may be effective on capital equipment or facility 
development projects.
By 1970 and again during the early 1980s, more companies departed from informal 
project management and restructured to formalize the project management process, mainly 
because the size and complexity of their activities had grown to a point where they were 
unmanageable within the current structure.
By 1970, the environment began to change rapidly. Companies in aerospace, defense, 
and construction pioneered the implementation of project management, and other industries 
soon followed, some with great reluctance. NASA and the DOD “forced” subcontractors 
into accepting project management.

The Evolution of Project Management: 1945–2017
41
By the 1990s, companies had begun to realize that implementing project management 
was a necessity, not a choice. The issue was not how to implement project management, 
but how fast it could be done.
Table 2–1 shows the typical life-cycle phases that an organization goes through to 
implement project management. There are seven driving forces that lead executives to rec-
ognize the need for project management:
●
●
Capital projects
●
●
Customer expectations
●
●
Competitiveness
●
●
Executive understanding
●
●
New project development
●
●
Efficiency and effectiveness
●
●
The need for business growth
Manufacturing companies are driven to project management because of large capital 
projects or a multitude of simultaneous projects. Executives soon realize the impact on 
cash flow and that slippages in the schedule could end up idling workers.
Companies that sell products or services, including installation, to their clients must 
have good project management practices. These companies are usually non–project-driven 
but function as though they were project-driven. These companies now sell solutions to 
their customers rather than products. It is almost impossible to sell complete solutions to 
customers without having superior project management practices because what you are 
actually selling is your project management expertise.
The speed by which companies reach some degree of maturity in project management 
is most often based upon how important they perceive the driving forces to be. Non–project-
driven and hybrid organizations move quickly to maturity if increased internal efficiencies 
and effectiveness are needed. Competitiveness is the slowest path because these types of 
organizations do not recognize that project management affects their competitive position

directly. For project-driven organizations, the path is reversed. Competitiveness is the name 
of the game and the vehicle used is project management.
By the 1990s, companies finally began to recognize the benefits of project manage-
ment. Table 2–2 shows the some of the benefits of project management and how our view 
of project management has changed.
In 2008, we saw the beginning of the housing market crunch in the United States and 
other nations. From 2008 to 2016, many companies saw a slowdown in company’s growth. 
Some companies recognized that the benefits of using project management could help them 
develop strategic partnerships, alliances, and joint ventures, thus providing growth oppor-
tunities. But now, in addition to the traditional project management competencies, project 
managers would need to understand how culture, politics, and religion affect decision 
making in their partner’s environment. In the future, a knowledge of culture, politics, and 
religion may be necessary to become a global project manager.
Recognizing that the organization can benefit from the implementation of project man-
agement is just the starting point. The question now becomes, “How long will it take us 
to achieve these benefits?” This can be partially answered from Figure 2–1. In the begin-
ning of the implementation process, there will be added expenses to develop the project 
management methodology and establish the support systems for planning, scheduling, 
and control. Eventually, the cost will level off and become pegged. The question mark in

2.2 RESISTANCE TO CHANGE

answer is shown in Figure 2–2. Historically, project management resided only in the pro-

Project Management Growth: Concepts and Definitions 
responsibility for profit and loss, which virtually forced companies to treat project manage-
ment as a profession. Project managers were viewed as managing part of a business rather 
than just performing as a project manager.
In the non–project-driven sectors of the marketplace, corporate survival was based 
upon products and services, rather than upon a continuous stream of projects. Profitability 
was identified through marketing and sales, with very few projects having an identifiable 
P&L. As a result, project management in these firms was never viewed as a profession.
In reality, most firms that believed that they were non–project-driven were actually 
hybrids. Hybrid organizations are typically non–project-driven firms with one or two divi-
sions that are project-driven. Historically, hybrids have functioned as though they were 
non–project-driven, as shown in Figure 2–2, but today they are functioning like project-
driven firms. Why the change? Management has come to the realization that they can most 
effectively run their organization on a “management by project” basis, and thereby achieve 
the benefits of both a project management organization and a traditional organization. The 
rapid growth and acceptance of project management during the last ten years has taken 
place in the non–project-driven/hybrid sectors. Now, project management is being pro-
moted by marketing, engineering, and production, rather than only by the project-driven 
departments (see Figure 2–3).
A second factor contributing to the acceptance of project management was the econ-
omy, specifically the recessions of 1979–1983 and 1989–1993. This can be seen from  
Table 2–3. By the end of the recession of 1979–1983, companies recognized the benefits of

using project management but were reluctant to see it implemented. Companies returned 
to the “status quo” of traditional management. There were no allies or alternative manage-
ment techniques that were promoting the use of project management.
The recession of 1989–1993 finally saw the growth of project management in the 
non–project-driven sector. This recession was characterized by layoffs in the white ­collar/
management ranks. Allies for project management were appearing and emphasis was being 
placed upon long-term solutions to problems. Project management was here to stay.
As project management continues to grow and mature, it will have more allies. In 
the twenty-first century, emerging world nations will come to recognize the benefits and 
importance of project management. Worldwide standards for project management will be 
established that may very well include requirements related to culture, politics, and reli-
gious aspects.
Even though project management has been in existence for more than fifty years, there 
are still different views and misconceptions about what it really is. Textbooks on operations 
research or management science still have chapters entitled “Project Management” that 
discuss only PERT scheduling techniques. A textbook on organizational design recognized 
project management as simply another organizational form.
All companies sooner or later understand the basics of project management. But com-
panies that have achieved excellence in project management have done so through success-
ful implementation and execution of processes and methodologies.
2.3 SYSTEMS, PROGRAMS, AND PROJECTS: A DEFINITION
In the preceding sections the word “systems” has been used rather loosely. The exact 
­definition of a system depends on the users, environment, and ultimate goal. Business 
practitioners define a system as:
A group of elements, either human or nonhuman, that is organized and arranged in such 
a way that the elements can act as a whole toward achieving some common goal or 
objective.
Systems are collections of interacting subsystems that, if properly organized, can 
provide a synergistic output. Systems are characterized by their boundaries or interface 
conditions. For example, if the business firm system were completely isolated from the 
environmental system, then a closed system would exist, in which case management would 
have complete control over all system components. If the business system reacts with the 
environment, then the system is referred to as open. All social systems, for example, are 
categorized as open systems. Open systems must have permeable boundaries.
If a system is significantly dependent on other systems for its survival, then it is an 
extended system. Not all open systems are extended systems. Extended systems are ever-
changing and can impose great hardships on individuals who desire to work in a regi-
mented atmosphere.
Military and government organizations were the first to attempt to define the bounda-
ries of systems, programs, and projects.

46
Project Management Growth: Concepts and Definitions 
Programs can be construed as the necessary first-level elements 
of a system. Additionally, they can be regarded as subsystems. How-
ever, programs are generally defined as time-phased efforts, whereas 
systems exist on a continuous basis.
Projects are also time-phased efforts (much shorter than programs) and are the first 
level of breakdown of a program. As shown in Table 2–4, the government sector tends 
to run efforts as programs, headed up by a program manager who hopes that their pro-
gram will receive government funding year after year. Today, the majority of the indus-
trial sector uses both project and program managers. Throughout this text, I have used 
the terms project and program management as being the same because they are generally 
regulated by the same policies, procedures, and guidelines. In general, as will be discussed 
in Chapter 11, projects are often considered to be the first level of subdivision of a program, 
and programs are often longer in duration than projects. However, there are many other 
significant differences, such as:
●
●
Projects may have a single objective, whereas programs may have multiple objects 
with a heavy orientation toward business rather than technical objectives.
●
●
The length of programs often makes them more susceptible to changing environ-
mental conditions, politics, the economy, business strategy, and interest rates.
●
●
The possibility for changing economic conditions may play havoc with pricing out 
long-term programs based upon estimates on forward pricing rates.
●
●
Functional managers are often reluctant to give up their best workers that are in 
high demand by committing them to a single program that will run for years.
●
●
Program governance is conducted by a committee rather than by a single indi-
vidual, and the membership may change over the life of the program.
●
●
Program funding may be on a yearly basis and changes in planned funding are 
based upon existing need, which may change from year to year, and economic 
conditions.
●
●
Scope changes may occur more frequently and have a greater impact on the project.
●
●
Rebaselining and replanning will occur more frequently.
●
●
Based upon the program’s length, succession planning may be necessary for work-
ers with critical skills.
●
●
The loss of some workers over the length of the program may be expected because 
of changing positions, better opportunities in another company, and retirements.
●
●
Workers may not believe that a long-term assignment on just one program is an 
opportunity for career advancement.

Product versus Project Management: A Definition
47
PMI has certification programs for both project and program managers and does dif-
ferentiate between the two. There are textbooks written that are dedicated entirely to pro-
gram management.
Once a group of tasks is selected and considered to be a project, the next step is to 
define the kinds of project units. There are four categories of projects:
●
●
Individual projects: These are short-duration projects normally assigned to a 
single individual who may be acting as both a project manager and a functional 
manager.
●
●
Staff projects: These are projects that can be accomplished by one organiza-
tional unit, say a department. A staff or task force is developed from each section 
involved. This works best if only one functional unit is involved.
●
●
Special projects: Often special projects occur that require certain primary func-
tions and/or authority to be assigned temporarily to other individuals or units. 
This works best for short-duration projects. Long-term projects can lead to severe 
conflicts under this arrangement.
●
●
Matrix or aggregate projects: These require input from a large number of func-
tional units and usually control vast resources.
Project management may now be defined as the process of achieving project objectives 
through the traditional organizational structure and over the specialties of the individuals 
concerned. Project management is applicable for any ad hoc (unique, one-time, one-of-a-
kind) undertaking concerned with a specific end objective. In order to complete a task, a 
project manager must:
●
●
Set objectives
●
●
Establish plans
●
●
Organize resources
●
●
Provide staffing
●
●
Set up controls
●
●
Issue directives
●
●
Motivate personnel
●
●
Apply innovation for alternative actions
●
●
Remain flexible
The type of project will often dictate which of these functions a project manager will 
be required to perform.
2.4 PRODUCT VERSUS PROJECT MANAGEMENT: A DEFINITION
Some people mistakenly argue that there is no major difference 
between a project and a program other than the time duration. Project 
managers focus on the end date of their project from the day they are

assigned as project manager. Program managers usually have a much longer time frame 
than project managers and never want to see their program come to an end. In the early 
years of project management with the DOD serving as the primary customer, aerospace 
and defense project managers were called program managers because the intent was to get 
follow-on government contracts each year.
But what about the definition of product management or product line management? 
Product managers function very much  like program managers. The product manager wants 
his or her product to be as long-lived as possible and as profitable as possible. Even when 
the demand for the product diminishes, the product manager will always look for spin-offs 
to keep a product alive.
There is also a difference between project and product scope:
●
●
Project scope defines the work that must be accomplished to produce a deliverable 
with specified features or functions. The deliverable can be a product, service, or 
other result.
●
●
Product scope defines the features or functions that characterize the deliverable.
There is a relationship between project and product management. When the project 
is in the R&D phase, a project manager is involved. Once the product is developed and 
introduced into the marketplace, the product manager takes control. In some situations, the 
project manager can become the product manager. Product and project management can, 
and do, exist concurrently within companies.
Product management can operate horizontally as well as vertically. When a prod-
uct is shown horizontally on the organizational chart, the implication is that the prod-
uct line is not big enough to control its own resources full-time and therefore shares 
key functional resources. If the product line were large enough to control its own 
resources full-time, it would be shown as a separate division or a vertical line on the 
organization chart.
Based upon the nature of the project, the project manager (or project engineer) 
can report to a marketing-type person. The reason is that technically oriented project 
leaders get too involved with the technical details of the project and lose sight of when 
and how to “kill” a project. Remember, most technical leaders have been trained in 
an academic rather than a business environment. Their commitment to success often 
does not take into account such important parameters as return on investment, profit-
ability, competition, and marketability. This is one of the reasons why some project 
plans and project business cases identify an “exit criteria” that states under what cir-
cumstances the project should be cancelled or possibly redirected toward a different 
business outcome.
To alleviate these problems, project managers and project engineers, especially 
on R&D-type projects, are now reporting to marketing so that marketing input will 
be included in all R&D decisions because of the high costs incurred during R&D. 
Executives must exercise caution with regard to this structure in which both product 
and project managers report to the marketing function. The marketing executive could 
become the focal point of the entire organization, with the capability of building a very 
large empire.

Maturity and Excellence: A Definition
49
2.5 MATURITY AND EXCELLENCE: A DEFINITION
Some people contend that maturity and excellence in project management are the same. 
Unfortunately, this is not the case. Consider the following definition:
Maturity in project management is the implementation of a standard methodology and 
accompanying processes such that there exists a high likelihood of repeated successes.
This definition is supported by the life-cycle phases shown in Table 2–1. Maturity 
implies that the proper foundation of tools, techniques, processes, and even culture, 
exists. When projects come to an end, there is usually a debriefing with senior man-
agement to discuss how well the methodology was used and to recommend changes. 
This debriefing looks at “key performance indicators,” which are shared learning 
topics, and allows the organization to maximize what it does right and to correct what 
it did wrong.
The definition of excellence can be stated as:
Organizations excellent in project management are those that create the environment in 
which there exists a continuous stream of successfully managed projects and where suc-
cess is measured by what is in the best interest of both the company and the project (i.e., 
customer).
Excellence goes well beyond maturity. You must have maturity to achieve excellence. 
Figure 2–4 shows that once the organization completes the first four life-cycle phases in 
Table 2–1, it may take two years or more to reach some initial levels of maturity. Excel-
lence, if achievable at all, may take an additional five years or more.

Figure 2–4 also brings out another important fact. During maturity, more successes 
than failures occur. During excellence, we obtain a continuous stream of successful pro-
jects. Yet, even after having achieved excellence, there will still be some failures.

It is unrealistic to believe that all projects will be completed successfully. Some people 
contend that the only true project failures are the ones from which nothing is learned. Fail-
ure can be viewed as success if the failure is identified early enough so that the resources 
can be reassigned to other, more opportune activities.
2.6 INFORMAL PROJECT MANAGEMENT: A DEFINITION
Companies today are managing projects more informally than before. Informal project 
management does have some degree of formality but emphasizes managing the project 
with a minimum amount of paperwork. Furthermore, informal project management is 
based upon guidelines rather than the policies and procedures that are the basis for formal 
project management. This was shown previously to be a characteristic of a good project 
management methodology. Informal project management mandates effective communica-
tions, effective cooperation, effective teamwork, and trust.
These four elements are absolutely essential for effective informal project man-
agement. Figure 2–5 shows the evolution of project documentation over the years. 
Executives who always make the right decision are not making enough decisions. 
Likewise, organizations in which all projects are completed successfully are not 
taking enough risks and are not working on enough projects.

As companies become mature in project management, emphasis is on guidelines and 
checklists. Figure 2–6 shows the critical issues as project management matures toward 
more informality.
As a final note, not all companies have the luxury of using informal project manage-
ment. Customers often have a strong voice in whether formal or informal project manage-
ment will be used. Dashboard reporting of project status accompanied by some degree 
of project management maturity has more companies leaning toward informal project 
management.

Project Management Growth: Concepts and Definitions 
2.7 THE MANY FACES OF SUCCESS
Historically, the definition of success has been meeting the custom-
er’s expectations regardless of whether the customer is internal or 
external. Success also includes getting the job done within the con-
straints of time, cost, and quality. Using this standard definition, success is defined as a 
point on the time, cost, quality/performance grid. But how many projects, especially those 
requiring innovation, are accomplished at this point?
Very few projects are ever completed without trade-offs or scope changes on time, 
cost, and quality. Therefore, success could still occur without exactly hitting this singular 
point. In this regard, success could be defined as a cube, such as seen in Figure 2–7. The 
singular point of time, cost, and quality would be a point within the cube, constituting the 
convergence of the critical success factors (CSFs) for the project.
Another factor to consider is that there may exist both primary and secondary defini-
tions of success, as shown in Table 2–5. The primary definitions of success are seen through 
the eyes of the customer. The secondary definitions of success are usually internal benefits. 
If achieving 86 percent of the specification is acceptable to the customer and follow-on 
work is received, then the original project might very well be considered a success.
The definition of success can also vary according to who the stakeholder is. For exam-
ple, each of the following can have his or her own definition of success on a project:
●
●
Consumers: safety in its use
●
●
Employees: guaranteed employment
●
●
Management: bonuses
●
●
Stockholders: profitability
●
●
Government agencies: compliance with federal regulations

The Many Faces of Success

It is possible for a project management methodology to identify primary and second-
ary success factors (Table 2.5). This could provide guidance to a project manager for the 
development of a risk management plan and for deciding which risks are worth taking and 
which are not.
As stated in Section 1.0, projects are now being aligned to business goals and objec-
tives. This applies to programs as well as projects. In addition to the alignment, the output of 
projects and programs are now expected to create sustainable business value. All of this has 
forced us to rethink our definitions of projects, programs, and how we will measure success. 
Table 2–6 shows how some of the definitions will most likely change in the future. The tradi-
tional definitions are still applicable today, but there is a need, at least in the author’s opinion, 
to include business and value components. Consuming resources on projects and programs 
that are not intended to create sustainable business value may not be a good business decision.
Customers and contractors must come to an agreement on the definition of success. A 
project manager was managing a large project for a government agency. The project man-
ager asked one of the vice presidents in his company, “What’s our company’s definition of 
success on the project for this government agency?” The vice president responded, “Meet-
ing the profit margins we stated in our proposal.” The project manager then responded, “Do 
you think the government agency has the same definition of project success as we do?” The 
conversation then ended.
When the customer and the contractor are working toward different definitions of suc-
cess, decision making becomes suboptimal and each party makes decisions in their own 
best interest. In an ideal situation, the customer and the contractor will establish a mutually 
agreed upon definition of success that both parties can live with.
While it is possible that no such agreement can be reached, a good starting point is to 
view the project through the eyes of the other party. As stated by Rachel Alt-Simmons:1
All too often, we take an inside-out perspective. What this means is that we see a cus-
tomer’s journey from how we engage with them as a company, not how they engage with

us as a consumer. A helpful tool in identifying how customers engage with us is by creat-
ing a customer journey map. The journey map helps identify all paths customers take in 
achieving their goal from start to finish. By looking at your organization through your 
customers’ eyes, you can begin to better understand the challenges that a customer faces in 
doing business with your organization. The team sees the customer outside or product or 
functional silos and helps link pieces of a customer process across the organization. Often, 
teams find out that potential solutions for problems that they’re identifying extend outside 
of their functional realm—and that’s okay!
2.8 THE MANY FACES OF FAILURE
Previously we stated that success might be a cube rather than a point. If we stay within 
the cube but miss the point, is that a failure? Probably not! The true definition of failure is 
when the final results are not what were expected, even though the original expectations 
may or may not have been reasonable. Sometimes customers and even internal executives 
set performance targets that are totally unrealistic in hopes of achieving 80–90 percent. For 
simplicity’s sake, let us define failure as unmet expectations.
With unmeetable expectations, failure is virtually assured since we have defined fail-
ure as unmet expectations. This is called a planning failure and is the difference between 
what was planned and what was, in fact, achieved. The second component of failure is poor 
performance or actual failure. This is the difference between what was achievable and what 
was actually accomplished.
Perceived failure is the net sum of actual failure and planning failure. Figures 2–8 and 
2–9 illustrate the components of perceived failure. In Figure 2–8, project management has 
planned a level of accomplishment (C) lower than what is achievable given project circum-
stances and resources (D). This is a classic underplanning situation. Actual accomplish-
ment (B), however, was less than planned.
A slightly different case is illustrated in Figure 2–9. Here, we have planned to accom-
plish more than is achievable. Planning failure is again assured even if no actual failure 
Section 2.8 is adapted from Robert D. Gilbreath, Winning at Project Management. (New York: John Wiley & 
Sons, 1986), pp. 2–6.

occurs. In both of these situations (overplanning and underplanning), the actual failure is 
the same, but the perceived failure can vary considerably.
Today, most project management practitioners focus on the planning failure term. If 
this term can be compressed or even eliminated, then the magnitude of the actual failure, 
should it occur, would be diminished. A good project management methodology helps to 
reduce this term. We now believe that the existence of this term is largely due to the project 
manager’s inability to perform effective risk management. In the 1980s, the failure of a 
project was believed to be largely a quantitative failure due to:

During the 1990s, the view of failure changed from being quantitatively oriented to 
qualitatively oriented. A failure in the 1990s was largely attributed to:
●
●
Poor morale
●
●
Poor motivation
●
●
Poor human relations
●
●
Poor productivity
●
●
No employee commitment
●
●
No functional commitment
●
●
Delays in problem solving
●
●
Too many unresolved policy issues
●
●
Conflicting priorities between executives, line managers, and project managers
Although these quantitative and qualitative approaches still hold true to some degree, 
today we believe that the major component of planning failure is inappropriate or inad-
equate risk management, or having a project management methodology that does not pro-
vide any guidance for risk management.
Sometimes, the risk management component of failure is not readily identified. For 
example, look at Figure 2–10. The actual performance delivered by the contractor was 
significantly less than the customer’s expectations. Is the difference due to poor techni-
cal ability or a combination of technical inability and poor risk management? Today we 
believe that it is a combination.
When a project is completed, companies perform a lessons-learned review. Some-
times lessons learned are inappropriately labeled and the true reason for the risk event is 
not known. Figure 2–11 illustrates the relationship between the marketing personnel and 
technical personnel when undertaking a project to develop a new product. If the project is

completed with actual performance being less than customer expectations, is it because 
of poor risk management by the technical assessment and forecasting personnel or poor 
marketing risk assessment? The relationship between marketing and technical risk man-
agement is not always clear.
Figure 2–11 also shows that opportunities for trade-offs diminish as we get further 
downstream on the project. There are numerous opportunities for trade-offs prior to estab-
lishing the final objectives for the project. In other words, if the project fails, it may be 
because of the timing when the risks were analyzed.
2.9 CAUSES OF PROJECT FAILURE
There are numerous causes of project failure, whether a partial or complete failure, and 
most failures are a result of more than one cause. Some cause may directly or indirectly 
lead to other causes. For example, business case failure can lead to planning and execu-
tion failure. For simplicity sake, project failures can be broken down into the following 
categories:
Planning/execution failures:
●
●
Business case deterioration
●
●
Business case requirements changed significantly over the life of the project
●
●
Technical obsolescence has occurred
●
●
Technologically unrealistic requirements
●
●
Lack of a clear vision

2.10 DEGREES OF SUCCESS AND FAILURE
Projects get terminated for one of two basic reasons; project success or project failure. Pro-
ject success is considered as a natural cause for termination and is achieved when we meet 
the success criteria established at the onset of the project. Project failure is often the result 
of unnatural causes such as a sudden change in the business base, loss of critical resources, 
or inability to meet certain critical constraints. Previously we listed the numerous reasons 
why a project can get terminated. Canceling a project is a critical business decision and 
can have a serious impact on people, processes, materials, and money within the company. 
Depending on when it’s canceled, it can also impact customer and partner relationships.
In an ideal situation, the business case for a project would contain a section identifying 
the criteria for success and also for termination. Identifying a cancellation criteria is impor-
tant because too many times a project that should be cancelled on just linger on and wastes 
precious resources that could be assigned to other more value-driven projects.
There are degrees of project success and failure. For example, a project can come in 
two weeks late and still be considered as a success. A project over budget by $100,000 can 
also be considered as a success if the end results provide value to the client and the client 
accepts the deliverables. Projects can also be partial successes and partial failures. One 
possible way of classifying project results can be:
●
●
Complete success: The project met the success criteria, value was created and all 
constraints were adhered to.

60
Project Management Growth: Concepts and Definitions 
●
●
Partial success: The project met the success criteria, the client accepted the deliverables 
and value was created, although one or more of the success constraints were not met.
●
●
Partial failure: The project was not completed as expected and may have been 
canceled early on in the life cycle. However, knowledge and/or intellectual property 
was created that may be used on future projects.
●
●
Complete failure: The project was abandoned and nothing was learned from the project.
In the future, we can expect to have more than three constraints on our projects. It is 
important to understand that it may not be possible to meet all of the competing constraints 
and therefore partial success may become the norm.
2.11 THE STAGE-GATE PROCESS
When companies recognize the need to begin developing processes 
for project management, the starting point is normally the stage-gate 
process. The stage-gate process was created because the traditional 
organizational structure was designed primarily for top-down, cen-
tralized management, control, and communications, all of which were no longer practical 
for organizations that use project management and horizontal work flow. The stage-gate 
process eventually evolved into life-cycle phases.
Just as the words imply, the process is composed of stages and gates. Stages are groups 
of activities that can be performed either in series or parallel based upon the magnitude of 
the risks the project team can endure. The stages are managed by crossfunctional teams. 
The gates are structured decision points at the end of each stage. Good project manage-
ment processes usually have no more than six gates. With more than six gates, the project 
team focuses too much attention on preparing for the gate reviews rather than on the actual 
management of the project.
Project management is used to manage the stages between the gates, and it can shorten 
the time between the gates. This is a critical success factor if the stage-gate process is to 
be used for the development and launch of new products. A good corporate methodology 
for project management will provide checklists, forms, and guidelines to make sure that 
critical steps are not omitted.
Checklists for gate reviews are critical. Without these checklists, project managers can 
waste hours preparing gate review reports. Good checklists focus on answering these questions:
●
●
Where are we today (i.e., time and cost)?
●
●
Where will we end up (i.e., time and cost)?
●
●
What are the present and future risks?
●
●
What assistance is needed from management?
Project managers are never allowed to function as their own gatekeepers. The gate-
keepers are either individuals (i.e., sponsors) or groups of individuals designated by sen-
ior management and empowered to enforce the structured decision-making process. The 
PMBOK® Guide, 6th Edition
1.2.4.1 Project and Development Life 
Cycles

Project Life Cycles
61
gatekeepers are authorized to evaluate the performance to date against predetermined cri-
teria and to provide the project team with additional business and technical information.
Gatekeepers must be willing to make decisions. The four most common decisions are:
●
●
Proceed to the next gate based upon the original objectives
●
●
Proceed to the next gate based upon revised objectives
●
●
Delay making a gate decision until further information is obtained
●
●
Cancel the project
Sponsors must also have the courage to terminate a project. The purpose of the gates 
is not only to obtain authorization to proceed, but to identify failure early enough so that 
resources will not be wasted but will be assigned to more promising activities.
The three major benefits of the stage-gate process are:
●
●
Providing structure to project management
●
●
Providing possible standardization in planning, scheduling, and control (i.e., 
forms, checklists, and guidelines)
●
●
Allowing for a structured decision-making process
Companies embark upon the stage-gate process with good intentions, but there are 
pitfalls that may disrupt the process. These include:
●
●
Assigning gatekeepers and not empowering them to make decisions
●
●
Assigning gatekeepers who are afraid to terminate a project
●
●
Denying the project team access to critical information
●
●
Allowing the project team to focus more on the gates than on the stages
It should be recognized that the stage-gate process is neither an end result nor a self-
sufficient methodology. Instead, it is just one of several processes that provide structure to 
the overall project management methodology.
Today, the stage-gate process appears to have been replaced by life-cycle phases. 
Although there is some truth in this, the stage-gate process is making a comeback. Since 
the stage-gate process focuses on decision making more than life-cycle phases, the stage-
gate process is being used as an internal, decision-making tool within each of the life-cycle 
phases. The advantage is that, while life-cycle phases are the same for every project, the 
stage-gate process can be custom-designed for each project to facilitate decision making 
and risk management. The stage-gate process is now an integral part of project manage-
ment, whereas previously it was used primarily for new product development efforts.
2.12 PROJECT LIFE CYCLES
Every program, project, or product has certain phases of develop-
ment known as life-cycle phases. A clear understanding of these 
phases permits managers and executives to better control resources 
PMBOK ® Guide, 6th Edition
1.2.4.2 Project Phase

62
Project Management Growth: Concepts and Definitions 
to achieve goals. During the past few years, there has been at least partial agreement about 
the life-cycle phases of a product. They include:
●
●
Research and development
●
●
Market introduction
●
●
Growth
●
●
Maturity
●
●
Deterioration
●
●
Death
Today, there is no agreement among industries, or even companies within the same 
industry, about the life-cycle phases of a project. This is understandable because of the 
complex nature and diversity of projects.
The theoretical definitions of the life-cycle phases of a system can be applied to a 
project. These phases include:
●
●
Conceptual
●
●
Planning
●
●
Testing
●
●
Implementation
●
●
Closure
The first phase, the conceptual phase, includes the preliminary evaluation of an idea. 
Most important in this phase is a preliminary analysis of risk and the resulting impact on the 
time, cost, and performance requirements, together with the potential impact on company 
resources. The conceptual phase also includes a “first cut” at the feasibility of the effort.
The second phase is the planning phase. It is mainly a refinement of the elements in the 
conceptual phase and requires a firm identification of the resources required and the estab-
lishment of realistic time, cost, and performance parameters. This phase also includes the 
initial preparation of documentation necessary to support the system. For a project based 
on competitive bidding, the conceptual phase would include the decision of whether to bid, 
and the planning phase would include the development of the total bid package (i.e., time, 
schedule, cost, and performance).
Because of the amount of estimating involved, analyzing system costs during the con-
ceptual and planning phases is not an easy task. As shown in Figure 2–12, most project or 
system costs can be broken down into operating (recurring) and implementation (nonrecur-
ring) categories. Implementation costs include one-time expenses such as construction of a 
new facility, purchasing computer hardware, or detailed planning. Operating costs include 
recurring expenses such as human resources. The operating costs may be reduced as shown 
in Figure 2–12 if personnel perform at a higher position on the learning curve. The identifi-
cation of a learning curve position is vitally important during the planning phase when firm 
cost positions must be established. Of course, it is not always possible to know what indi-
viduals will be available or how soon they will perform at a higher learning curve position.
Once the approximate total cost of the project is determined, a cost-benefit analysis 
should be conducted (see Figure 2–13) to determine if the estimated value of the informa-
tion obtained from the system exceeds the cost of obtaining the information. This analysis

is often included as part of a feasibility study. There are several situations, such as in 
competitive bidding, where the feasibility study is actually the conceptual and definition 
phases. Because of the costs that can be incurred during these two phases, top-management 
approval is almost always necessary before the initiation of such a feasibility study.

The third phase—testing—is predominantly a testing and final standardization effort 
so that operations can begin. Almost all documentation must be completed in this phase.
The fourth phase is the implementation phase, which integrates the project’s product 
or services into the existing organization. If the project was developed for establishment of 
a marketable product, then this phase could include the product life-cycle phases of market 
introduction, growth, maturity, and a portion of deterioration.
The final phase is closure and includes the reallocation of resources. Consider a com-
pany that sells products to consumers. As one product begins the deterioration and death 
phases of its life cycle (i.e., the divestment phase of a system), new products or projects 
must be established. Such a company would, therefore, require a continuous stream of 
projects to survive, as shown in Figure 2–14. As projects A and B begin their decline, new 
efforts (project C) must be developed for resource reallocation. In the ideal situation, these 
new projects will be established at such a rate that total revenue will increase and company 
growth will be clearly visible.
The closure phase evaluates the efforts of the total system and serves as input to the 
conceptual phases for new projects and systems. This final phase also has an impact on 
other ongoing projects with regard to identifying priorities.
Table 2–7 identifies the various life-cycle phases that are commonly used in different 
industries. However, even in mature project management industries such as construction, 
one could survey ten different construction companies and find ten different definitions for 
the life-cycle phases.

Gate Review Meetings (Project Closure)
65
Not all projects can be simply transposed into life-cycle phases (e.g., R&D). It might 
be possible (even in the same company) for different definitions of life-cycle phases to 
exist because of schedule length, complexity, or just the difficulty of managing the phases.
Top management is responsible for the periodic review of major projects. This should 
be accomplished, at a minimum, at the completion of each life-cycle phase.
2.13 GATE REVIEW MEETINGS (PROJECT CLOSURE)
Gate review meetings are a form of project closure. Gate review 
meetings could result in the closure of a life-cycle phase or the clo-
sure of the entire project. Gate review meetings must be planned for, 
and this includes the gathering, analysis, and dissemination of pertinent information. This 
can be done effectively with the use of forms, templates, and checklists.
There are two forms of closure pertinent to gate review meetings: contractual closure 
and administrative closure. Contractual closure precedes administrative closure.
Contractual closure is the verification and signoff that all deliverables required for this 
phase have been completed and all action items have been fulfilled. Contractual closure is 
the responsibility of both the project manager and the contract administrator.
Administrative closure is the updating of all pertinent records required for both the 
customer and the contractor. Customers are particularly interested in documentation on 
any as-built or as-installed changes or deviations from the specifications. Also required is 
an archived trail of all scope changes agreed to during the life of the project. Contractors 
are interested in archived data that include project records, minutes, memos, newsletters, 
change management documentation, project acceptance documentation, and the history of 
audits for lessons learned and continuous improvement.
A subset of administrative closure is financial closure, which is the closing out of all 
charge numbers for the work completed. Even though contractual closure may have taken 
place, there may still exist open charge numbers for the repair of defects or to complete 
archived paperwork. Closure must be planned for, and this includes setting up a timetable 
and budget. Table 2–8 shows the activities for each type of closure.

2.14 ENGAGEMENT PROJECT MANAGEMENT
Companies have traditionally viewed each customer as a one-time opportunity, and after 
this customer’s needs were met, emphasis was placed upon finding other customers. This 
is acceptable as long as there exists a potentially large customer base. Today, project-
driven organizations, namely those that survive on the income from a continuous stream 
of customer-funded projects, are implementing the “engagement project management” 
(EPM) approach. With engagement project management, each potential new customer is 
approached where the contractor is soliciting a long-term relationship with the customer 
rather than a one-time opportunity. With this approach, contractors are selling not only 
deliverables and complete solutions to the client’s business needs but also a willingness to 
make changes to the way that they manage their projects in order to receive future contracts 
from this client.
To maintain this level of customer satisfaction and hopefully a long-term relation-
ship, customers are requested to provide input on how the contractor’s project management 
methodology can be better utilized in the future. Some companies have added into their 
methodology a life-cycle phase entitled “Customer Satisfaction Management.” This life-
cycle phase takes place after administrative closure is completed. The phase involves a 
meeting between the client and the contractor, and in attendance are the project managers 
from each organization, the sponsors, selected team members and functional managers, 
and the sales force. The question that needs to be addressed by the contractor is, “What can 
we do better on the next project we perform for you?”

Project Management Methodologies: A Definition
67
How much freedom should a client be given in making recommendations for changes 
to a contractor’s EPM system? How much say should a customer have in how a contrac-
tor manages projects? What happens if this allows customers to begin telling contractors 
how to do their job? Obviously there are risks to be considered for this level of customer 
satisfaction.
If the project manager is expected to manage several projects for this client, then the 
project manager must understand the nature of the client’s business and the environment 
in which the client does business. This is essential in order to identify and mitigate the 
risks associated with these projects. Some companies maintain an engagement manager 
and a project manager for each client. The engagement manager functions like an account 
executive for that client and may provide the project manager with the needed business 
information.
2.15 PROJECT MANAGEMENT METHODOLOGIES:  
A DEFINITION
Achieving project management excellence, or maturity, is more likely with a repetitive 
process that can be used on each and every project. This repetitive process is referred to as 
the project management methodology.
If possible, companies should maintain and support a single methodology for project 
management. Good methodologies integrate other processes into the project management 
methodology, as shown in Figure 2–15. Companies have all five of these processes inte-
grated into their project management methodology.
In the coming years, companies can be expected to integrate more of their business 
processes in the project management methodology. This is shown in Figure 2–16. Manag-
ing off of a single methodology lowers cost, reduces resource requirements for support, 
minimizes paperwork, and eliminates duplicated efforts.

Project Management Growth: Concepts and Definitions 
The characteristics of a good methodology based upon integrated processes include:
●
●
A recommended level of detail
●
●
Use of templates
●
●
Standardized planning, scheduling, and cost control techniques
●
●
Standardized reporting format for both in-house and customer use
●
●
Flexibility for application to all projects
●
●
Flexibility for rapid improvements
●
●
Easy for the customer to understand and follow
●
●
Readily accepted and used throughout the entire company
●
●
Use of standardized life-cycle phases (which can overlap) and end of phase 
reviews (Section 2.15)
●
●
Based upon guidelines rather than policies and procedures (Section 2.6)
●
●
Based upon a good work ethic
Methodologies do not manage projects; people do. It is the corporate culture that exe-
cutes the methodology. Senior management must create a corporate culture that supports 
project management and demonstrates faith in the methodology. If this is done success-
fully, then the following benefits can be expected:
●
●
Faster “time to market” through better control of the project’s scope
●
●
Lower overall project risk
●
●
Better decision-making process
●
●
Greater customer satisfaction, which leads to increased business
●
●
More time available for value-added efforts, rather than internal politics and inter-
nal competition

From Enterprise Project Management Methodologies to Frameworks
69
2.16 FROM ENTERPRISE PROJECT MANAGEMENT METHODOLOGIES TO 
FRAMEWORKS
When the products, services, or customers have similar requirements that are reason-
ably well defined and do not require significant customization or numerous scope 
changes, companies develop often inflexible methodologies to provide some degree 
of consistency in the way that projects are managed. These types of methodologies 
are often based on rigid policies and procedures with limited flexibility but can be 
successful especially on large, complex, long-term projects. These “rigid” approaches 
are commonly called waterfall approaches, where work is done sequentially and can 
be easily represented by Gantt charts. The waterfall approach begins with well-defined 
requirements from which we must determine the budget and schedule to produce the 
deliverables. This approach thrives on often massive and costly documentation require-
ments. The approval of scope changes can be slow because rapid customer involvement 
may not be possible.
For some types of projects, for example in software development, the waterfall approach 
may not work well because the requirements may not be fully understood at the beginning 
of a project. We may not have a clear picture of the approach/solution we must take to 
create the deliverables. We may need some degree of experimentation which could lead to 
a significant number of scope changes. Customer involvement must occur throughout the 
project in order to address changes quickly, which mandates collaborative involvement by 
all participants, including stakeholders. In this case, we may start out with a fixed budget 
and schedule, and then have to decide how much work can be done within the time and 
cost constraints. The requirements can evolve over the life of the project. For these types 
of projects, a more flexible or agile approach is needed. The agile project management 
methodology will be discussed in more depth in Section 8.11.
As companies become reasonably mature in project management and recognize the 
need for a more agile approach on some projects, the policies and procedures are replaced 
by forms, guidelines, templates, and checklists. This provides more flexibility for the pro-
ject manager in how to apply the methodology to satisfy a specific customer’s require-
ments. This leads to a more informal or agile approach to project management.
Today, most projects are managed with an approach that is neither extremely agile 
nor extremely rigid; it is an in between approach with some degree of flexibility and more 
informal than formal. Because the amount of flexibility can change for each project, this 
approach is sometimes called a framework. A framework is a basic conceptual structure 
that is used to address an issue, such as a project. It includes a set of assumptions, con-
cepts, templates, values, and processes that provide the project manager with a means for 
viewing what is needed to satisfy a customer’s requirements. A framework is a skeleton 
support structure for building the project’s deliverables. Frameworks work well as long as 
the project’s requirements do not impose severe pressure upon the project manager. Unfor-
tunately, in today’s chaotic environment, this pressure exists and appears to be increasing. 
Project managers need framework methodologies to have the freedom to meet the cus-
tomer’s needs.

Project Management Growth: Concepts and Definitions 
2.17 METHODOLOGIES CAN FAIL
Most companies today seem to recognize the need for one or more project management 
methodologies but either create the wrong methodologies or misuse the methodologies that 
have been created. It may not be possible to create a single enterprise-wide methodology 
that can be applied to each and every project. Some companies have been successful doing 
this, but there are still many companies that successfully maintain more than one methodol-
ogy. Unless the project manager is capable of tailoring the enterprise project management 
methodology to his or her needs, perhaps by using a framework approach, more than one 
methodology may be necessary.
There are several reasons why good intentions often go astray. At the executive levels, 
methodologies can fail if the executives have a poor understanding of what a methodology 
is and believe that a methodology is:
●
●
A quick fix
●
●
A silver bullet
●
●
A temporary solution
●
●
A cookbook approach for project success2
At the working levels, methodologies can also fail if they:
●
●
Are abstract and high level
●
●
Contain insufficient narratives to support these methodologies
●
●
Are not functional or do not address crucial areas
●
●
Ignore the industry standards and best practices
●
●
Look impressive but lack real integration into the business
●
●
Use nonstandard project conventions and terminology
●
●
Compete for similar resources without addressing this problem
●
●
Don’t have any performance metrics
●
●
Take too long to complete because of bureaucracy and administration3
Other reasons why methodologies can lead to project failure include:
●
●
The methodology must be followed exactly even if the assumptions and environ-
mental input factors have changed.
●
●
The methodology focuses on linear thinking.
●
●
The methodology does not allow for out-of-the-box thinking.
●
●
The methodology does not allow for value-added changes that are not part of the 
original requirements.
●
●
The methodology does not fit the type of project.
●
●
The methodology uses nonstandard terminology.
●
●
The methodology is too abstract (rushing to design it).

●
●
The methodology development team neglects to consider bottlenecks and con-
cerns of the user community.
●
●
The methodology is too detailed.
●
●
The methodology takes too long to use.
●
●
The methodology is too complex for the market, clients, and stakeholders to 
understand.
●
●
The methodology does not have sufficient or correct metrics.
2.18 ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE MANAGEMENT AND  
CORPORATE CULTURES
It has often been said that the most difficult projects to manage are 
those that involve the management of change. Figure 2–17 shows the 
four basic inputs needed to develop a project management methodol-
ogy. Each has a “human” side that may require that people change.
Successful development and implementation of a project management methodology 
requires:
●
●
Identification of the most common reasons for change in project management
●
●
Identification of the ways to overcome the resistance to change
●
●
Application of the principles of organizational change management to ensure that 
the desired project management environment will be created and sustained
For simplicity’s sake, resistance can be classified as professional resistance and personal 
resistance to change. Professional resistance occurs when each functional unit as a whole 
feels threatened by project management. This is shown in Figure 2–18. Examples include:
●
●
Sales: The sales staff’s resistance to change arises from fear that project manage-
ment will take credit for corporate profits, thus reducing the year-end bonuses for

the sales force. Sales personnel fear that project managers may become involved 
in the sales effort, thus diminishing the power of the sales force.
●
●
Marketing: Marketing people fear that project managers will end up working so 
closely with customers that project managers may eventually be given some of the 
marketing and sales functions. This fear is not without merit because customers 
often want to communicate with the personnel managing the project rather than 
those who may disappear after the sale is closed.
●
●
Finance (and Accounting): These departments fear that project management will 
require the development of a project accounting system (such as earned value 
measurement) that will increase the workload in accounting and finance, and that 
they will have to perform accounting both horizontally (i.e., in projects) and verti-
cally (i.e., in line groups).
●
●
Procurement: The fear in this group is that a project procurement system will 
be implemented in parallel with the corporate procurement system, and that the 
project managers will perform their own procurement, thus bypassing the procure-
ment department.
●
●
Human Resources Management: The HR department may fear that a project man-
agement career path ladder will be created, requiring new training programs. This 
will increase their workloads.
●
●
Manufacturing: Little resistance is found here because, although the manufac-
turing segment is not project-driven, there are numerous capital installation and 
maintenance projects which will have required the use of project management.
●
●
Engineering, R&D, and Information Technology: These departments are almost 
entirely project-driven with very little resistance to project management.

Getting the support of and partnership with functional management can usually over-
come the functional resistance. However, the individual resistance is usually more complex 
and more difficult to overcome. Individual resistance can stem from:
●
●
Potential changes in work habits
●
●
Potential changes in the social groups
●
●
Embedded fears
●
●
Potential changes in the wage and salary administration program
Tables 2–2 through 2–12 show the causes of resistance and possible solutions. Work-
ers tend to seek constancy and often fear that new initiatives will push them outside their 
comfort zones. Most workers are already pressed for time in their current jobs and fear that 
new programs will require more time and energy.
 Table 2–9.  Resistance: Work Habits
Cause of Resistance
Ways to Overcome
• New guidelines/processes
• Need to share “power” information

• Create new comfort zones at an acceptable pace
• Identify tangible/intangible individual benefits

74
Project Management Growth: Concepts and Definitions 
Some companies feel compelled to continually undertake new initiatives, and people 
may become skeptical of these programs, especially if previous initiatives have not been 
successful. The worst case scenario is when employees are asked to undertake new initia-
tives, procedures, and processes that they do not understand.
It is imperative that we understand resistance to change. If individuals are happy 
with their current environment, there will be resistance to change. But what if people are 
unhappy? There will still be resistance to change unless (1) people believe that the change 
is possible, and (2) people believe that they will somehow benefit from the change.
Management is the architect of the change process and must develop the appropriate 
strategies so the organization can change. This is done best by developing a shared under-
standing with employees by doing the following:
●
●
Explaining the reasons for the change and soliciting feedback
●
●
Explaining the desired outcomes and rationale
●
●
Championing the change process
●
●
Empowering the appropriate individuals to institutionalize the changes
●
●
Investing in training necessary to support the changes
For most companies, the change management process will follow the pattern shown 
in Figure 2–19. Employees initially refuse to admit the need for change. As management 
begins pursuing the change, the support for the change diminishes and pockets of resist-
ance crop up. Continuous support for the change by management encourages employees

to explore the potential opportunities that will result from the change about to take place. 
Unfortunately, this exploration often causes additional negative information to surface, thus 
reinforcing the resistance to change. As pressure by management increases, and employees 
begin to recognize the benefits of the proposed change, support begins to grow.
The ideal purpose of change management is to create a superior culture. There are 
different types of project management cultures based upon the nature of the business, the 
amount of trust and cooperation, and the competitive environment. Typical types of cul-
tures include:
●
●
Cooperative cultures: These are based upon trust and effective communications, 
internally and externally.
●
●
Noncooperative cultures: In these cultures, mistrust prevails. Employees worry 
more about themselves and their personal interests than what’s best for the team, 
company, or customer.
●
●
Competitive cultures: These cultures force project teams to compete with one 
another for valuable corporate resources. In these cultures, project managers often 
demand that the employees demonstrate more loyalty to the project than to their 
line managers. This can be disastrous when employees are working on many pro-
jects at the same time.
●
●
Isolated cultures: These occur when a large organization allows functional units to 
develop their own project management cultures and can result in a culture-within-
a-culture environment.
●
●
Fragmented cultures: These occur when part of the team is geographically separated 
from the rest of the team. Fragmented cultures also occur on multinational projects, 
where the home office or corporate team may have a strong culture for project man-
agement but the foreign team has no sustainable project management culture.
Some of the facets for an effective project management culture are shown in Figure 2–20.

Figure 2–20.  Facets of a project management culture.

76
Project Management Growth: Concepts and Definitions 
The critical facets of a good culture are teamwork, trust communications, and coopera-
tion. Some project management practitioners argue that communications and cooperation 
are the essential ingredients for teamwork and trust. In companies with excellent cultures, 
teamwork is exhibited by:
●
●
Employees and managers sharing ideas with each other and establishing high lev-
els of innovation and creativity in work groups
●
●
Employees and managers trusting each other and demonstrating loyalty to each 
other and the company
●
●
Employees and managers being committed to the work they do and the promises 
they make
●
●
Employees and managers sharing information freely
●
●
Employees and managers consistently being open and honest with each other
When teamwork exists, trust usually follows, and this includes trust among the work-
ers within the company and trust in dealing with clients. When trust occurs between the 
buyer and the seller, both parties eventually benefit, as shown in Table 2–13.
2.19 BENEFITS HARVESTING AND CULTURAL CHANGE
On some projects, the true benefits and resulting value are not 
obtained until sometime after the project is over. An example might 
be the development of a new software program where the benefits are 
not achieved until the software program is implemented and being used. This is often called 
the “go live” stage of a project. The “go live” stage is often called benefits harvesting stages 
which is the actual realization of the benefits and accompanying value. Harvesting may 
necessitate the implementation of an organizational change management plan that may 
remove people from their comfort zone. Full benefit realization may face resistance from 
managers, workers, customers, suppliers, and partners. There may be an inherent fear that 
change will be accompanied by loss of promotion prospects, less authority and responsibil-
ity, and possible loss of respect from peers.

●

●
Providing additional or new management support

2.20 AGILE AND ADAPTIVE PROJECT MANAGEMENT CULTURES
One of the reasons why agile project management has been success-
ful is because executive are now placing more trust in the hands of the 
project managers to make the correct project and business decisions. 
Years ago, project management methodologies were created based 
upon rigid policies and procedures with the mistaken belief that only 
through project management standardization on every project can we get repeatable project 
success. Tailoring the project management methodology to a particular project or client 
was rarely allowed.
Agile project management practices have demonstrated that project management tai-
loring can work. Most methodologies today are made of forms, guidelines, templates, and 
checklists. The project manager then selects what is appropriate for a particular client and 
creates a flexible methodology or framework that can be unique for each client. We live in 
a world of adaptive environments. This is particularly important for external clients that 
would prefer that the framework be adapted to their business model and way of doing busi-
ness rather than how your parent company does business. Framework success can lead to 
repeat business.
2.21 PROJECT MANAGEMENT  
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We believe today that we are managing our business by projects. As 
such, project managers are expected to make business decisions as 
well as project decisions. Throughout the life of a project, there is a 
significant amount of data that must be collected including informa-
tion related to the project business case, project benefits realization 
plan, project charter, and project plan.
When a project comes to an end, the focus is now on captur-
ing lessons learned and best practices. We must capture not only

project-related best practices, but business best practices as well. But as we capture busi-
ness best practices, we begin replacing the project management best practices library with 
a knowledge repository that includes both project management and business-related best 
practices. This is shown in Figure 2–21.
Another reason for the growth in intellectual property is because of the benchmark-
ing activities that companies are performing, most likely using the project management 
office. Figure 2–22 shows typical benchmarking activities and the types of information 
being sought.

Systems Thinking
79
The growth in knowledge repositories and cloud computing has provided companies 
with the opportunities for data warehouses. According to Melik:
Many organizations use diverse applications and information systems, each having its 
own database. The data from disparate systems can be merged into one single database 
(centralized data) in a process known as data warehousing. For example, a company could 
use a customer relations management (CRM) solution from Vendor A, a project manage-
ment system from Vendor B, and an enterprise resource planning (ERP) or accounting 
system from Vendor C; data warehousing would be used to aggregate the data from these 
three sources. Business intelligence and reporting tools are then used to perform detailed 
analysis on all of the data. Data warehouse reports are usually not real time, since the data 
aggregation takes time to complete and is typically scheduled for once per week, month, 
or even quarter.4
2.22 SYSTEMS THINKING
Ultimately, all decisions and policies are made on the basis of judgments; there is no other 
way, and there never will be. In the end, analysis is but an aid to the judgment and intuition 
of the decision maker. These principles hold true for project management as well as for 
systems management.
The systems approach may be defined as a logical and disciplined process of problem 
solving. The word process indicates an active ongoing system that is fed by input from its 
parts. The systems approach:
●
●
Forces review of the relationship of the various subsystems
●
●
Is a dynamic process that integrates all activities into a meaningful total system
●
●
Systematically assembles and matches the parts of the system into a unified 
whole
●
●
Seeks an optimal solution or strategy in solving a problem
The systems approach to problem-solving has phases of development similar to tradi-
tional life-cycle phases. These phases are defined as follows:
●
●
Translation: Terminology, problem objective, and criteria and constraints are 
defined and accepted by all participants.
●
●
Analysis: All possible approaches to or alternatives to the solution of the problem 
are stated.
●
●
Trade-off: Selection criteria and constraints are applied to the alternatives to meet 
the objective.
●
●
Synthesis: The best solution in reaching the objective of the system is the result of 
the combination of analysis and trade-off phases.
4.  Rudolf Melik, The Rise of the Project Workforce (Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons, 2007), p. 238.

80
Project Management Growth: Concepts and Definitions 
Other terms essential to the systems approach are:
●
●
Objective: The function of the system or the strategy that must be achieved
●
●
Requirement: A partial need to satisfy the objective
●
●
Alternative: One of the selected ways to implement and satisfy a requirement
●
●
Selection criteria: Performance factors used in evaluating the alternatives to select 
a preferable alternative
●
●
Constraint: An absolute factor that describes conditions that the alternatives must 
meet
A common error by potential decision makers (those dissatisfied individuals with 
authority to act) who base their thinking solely on subjective experience, judgment, and 
intuition is that they fail to recognize the existence of alternatives. Subjective thinking is 
inhibited or affected by personal bias.
Objective thinking, on the other hand, is a fundamental characteristic of the systems 
approach and is exhibited or characterized by emphasis on the tendency to view events, 
phenomena, and ideas as external and apart from self-consciousness. Objective thinking 
is unprejudiced.
The systems analysis process, as shown in Figure 2–23, begins with systematic exami-
nation and comparison of those alternative actions that are related to the accomplishment of 
the desired objective. The alternatives are then compared on the basis of the resource costs 
and the associated benefits. The loop is then completed using feedback to determine how 
compatible each alternative is with the objectives of the organization.
The above analysis can be arranged in steps:
●
●
Input data to mental process
●
●
Analyze data
●
●
Predict outcomes
●
●
Evaluate outcomes and compare alternatives
●
●
Choose the best alternative
●
●
Take action
●
●
Measure results and compare them with predictions
The systems approach is most effective if individuals can be trained to be ready with 
alternative actions that directly tie in with the prediction of outcomes. The basic tool is the 
outcome array, which represents the matrix of all possible circumstances. This outcome 
array can be developed only if the decision maker thinks in terms of the wide scope of 
possible outcomes. Outcome descriptions force the decision maker to spell out clearly just 
what he is trying to achieve (i.e., his objectives).
Systems thinking is vital for the success of a project. Project management systems 
urgently need new ways of strategically viewing, questioning, and analyzing project needs

CREATING A METHODOLOGY
case study
John Compton, the president of the company, expressed his feelings quite 
bluntly at the executive staff meeting:
We are no longer competitive in the marketplace. Almost all of the Requests for Proposal 
(RFP) that we want to bid on have a requirement that we must identify in the proposal the pro-
ject management methodology we will use on the contract should we be awarded the contract. 
We have no project management methodology. We have just a few templates we use based upon 
the PMBOK ® Guide. All of our competitors have methodologies, but not us.
I have been asking for a methodology to be developed for more than a year now, and all I 
get are excuses. Some of you are obviously afraid that you might lose power and authority once 
the methodology is up and running. That may be true, but losing some power and authority is 
obviously better than losing your job. In six months I want to see a methodology in use on all 
projects or I will handle the situation myself. I simply cannot believe that my executive staff is 
afraid to develop a project management methodology.
Background
The executive staff knew this day was inevitable; they had to take the 
initiative in the implementation of a project management methodology. 
Last year, a consultant was brought in to conduct a morning three-hour session on the ben-
efits of project management and the value of an enterprise project management methodology 
(EPM). As part of the session, the consultant explained that the time needed to develop and 
implement an EPM system can be shortened if the company has a project management office 
(PMO) in place to take the lead role. The consultant also explained that whichever executive

87
gets control of the PMO may become more powerful than other executives because he or she 
now controls all of the project management intellectual property. The executive staff fully 
understood the implication of this and therefore became reluctant to visibly support project 
management until they could see how their organization would be affected. In the meantime, 
project management suffered.
Reluctantly, a PMO was formed reporting to the chief information officer. The PMO com-
prised a handful of experienced project managers who could hopefully take the lead in the de-
velopment of a methodology. The PMO concluded that there were five steps that had to be done 
initially. After the five steps were done, the executive committee would receive a final briefing 
on what had been accomplished. The final briefing would be in addition to the monthly updates 
and progress reports. The PMO believed that getting executive support and sign-offs in a timely 
manner would be difficult.
The first step that needed to be done was the establishment of the number of life-cycle 
phases. Some people interviewed wanted ten to twelve life-cycle phases. That meant that there 
would be ten to twelve gate review meetings and the project managers would spend a great deal 
of time preparing paperwork for the gate review meetings rather than managing the project. The 
decision was then made to have no more than six life-cycle phases.
The second step was to decide whether the methodology should be designed around rigid 
policies and procedures or go the more informal route of using forms, guidelines, checklists, 
and templates. The PMO felt that project managers needed some degree of freedom in dealing 
with clients and therefore the more informal approach would work best. Also, clients were ask-
ing to have the methodology designed around the client’s business needs and the more informal 
approach would provide the flexibility to do this.
The third step was to see what could be salvaged from the existing templates and check-
lists. The company had a few templates and checklists but not all of the project managers used 
them. The decision was made to develop a standardized set of documents in accordance with 
the information in the PMBOK® Guide. The project managers could then select whatever forms, 
guidelines, templates, and checklists were appropriate for a particular project and client.
The fourth step would be to develop a means for capturing best practices using the EPM 
system. Clients were now requiring in their RFP that best practices on a project must be cap-
tured and shared with the client prior to the closeout of the project. Most of the people in the 
PMO believed that this could be done using forms or checklists at the final project debriefing 
meeting.
The fifth step involved education and training. The project managers and functional organi-
zations that would staff the projects would need to be trained in the use of the new methodology. 
The PMO believed that a one-day training program would suffice and the functional organiza-
tions could easily release their people for a one-day training session.
QUESTIONS
1.	 What can you determine about the corporate culture from the fact that they waited this long 
to consider the development of an EPM system?
2.	 Can a PMO accelerate the implementation process?
3.	 Is it acceptable for the PMO to report to the chief information officer or to someone else?
4.	 Why is it best to have six or fewer life-cycle phases in an EPM system?
5.	 Is it best to design an EPM system around flexible or inflexible elements? Generally, when 
first developing an EPM system, do companies prefer to use formality or informality in the 
design?
6.	 Should an EPM system have the capability of capturing best practices?

3.0 INTRODUCTION
During the past fifty years there has been a so-called hidden revo-
lution in the introduction and development of new organizational 
structures. Management has come to realize that organizations must 
be dynamic in nature; that is, they must be capable of rapid restruc-
turing should environmental conditions so dictate. These environ-
mental factors evolved from the increasing competitiveness of the 
market, changes in technology, and a requirement for better control 
of resources for multiproduct firms.
Much has been written about how to identify and interpret those signs that indicate that a new 
organizational form may be necessary. Some signs include underutilization of talent, frequent inabil-
ity to meet the constraints and the lack of a cooperative culture.
Unfortunately, many companies do not realize the necessity for organizational change until it is too 
late. Management looks externally (i.e., to the environment) rather than internally for solutions to problems. 
A typical example would be that new product costs are rising while the product life cycle may be decreas-
ing. Should emphasis be placed on lowering costs or developing new products?
If we assume that an organizational system is composed of both human and nonhuman resources, then 
we must analyze the sociotechnical subsystem whenever organizational changes are being considered. The 
social system is represented by the organization’s personnel and their group behavior. The technical system 
includes the technology, materials, and machines necessary to perform the required tasks.
Behaviorists contend that there is no one best structure to meet the challenges of tomorrow’s organi-
zations. The structure used, however, must be one that optimizes company performance by achieving a 
balance between the social and the technical requirements.

Organizational Structures 
Even the simplest type of organizational change can induce major conflicts. The creation of a new 
position, the need for better planning, the lengthening or shortening of the span of control, the need for 
additional technology (knowledge), and centralization or decentralization can result in major changes in the 
sociotechnical subsystem.
Organizational restructuring is a compromise between the traditional (classical) and the behavioral 
schools of thought; management must consider the needs of individuals as well as the needs of the company. 
Is the organization structured to manage people or to manage work?
There is a wide variety of organizational forms for restructuring management. The exact method 
depends on the people in the organization, the company’s product lines, and management’s philosophy. A 
poorly restructured organization can sever communication channels that may have taken months or years to 
cultivate; cause a restructuring of the informal organization, thus creating new power, status, and political 
positions; and eliminate job satisfaction and motivational factors to such a degree that complete discontent 
results.
In the sections that follow, a variety of organizational forms will be presented. Obviously, it is an 
impossible task to describe all possible organizational structures. Each form describes how the project 
management organization evolved from the classical theories of management. Advantages and disadvan-
tages are listed for technology and social systems.
The answers to these questions are not easy. For the most part, they are a matter of the judgment exer-
cised by organizational and behavioral managers.
3.1 ORGANIZATIONAL WORK FLOW
Organizations are continually restructured to meet the demands imposed by the environ-
ment. Restructuring can change the role of individuals in the formal and the informal 
organization. Many researchers believe that the greatest usefulness of behaviorists lies in 
their ability to help the informal organization adapt to changes and resolve the resulting 
conflicts. Unfortunately, behaviorists cannot be totally effective unless they have input into 
the formal organization as well. Whatever organizational form is finally selected, formal 
channels must be developed so that each individual has a clear description of the authority, 
responsibility, and accountability necessary for the work to proceed.
In the discussion of organizational structures, the following definitions will be used:
●
●
Authority is the power granted to individuals (possibly by their position) so that 
they can make final decisions.
●
●
Responsibility is the obligation incurred by individuals in their roles in the formal 
organization to effectively perform assignments.
●
●
Accountability is being answerable for the satisfactory completion of a specific 
assignment. (Accountability = authority + responsibility)
Authority and responsibility can be delegated to lower levels in the organization, 
whereas accountability usually rests with the individual. Yet many executives refuse 
to delegate and argue that an individual can have total accountability just through 
responsibility.

Traditional (Classical) Organization
91
Even with these clearly definable divisions of authority, responsibility, and account-
ability, establishing good relationships between project and functional managers can take 
a great deal of time, especially during the conversion from a traditional to a project organi-
zational form. Trust is the key to success here.
3.2 TRADITIONAL (CLASSICAL) ORGANIZATION
The traditional management structure has survived for more than two centuries. However, 
recent business developments, such as the rapid rate of change in technology and increased 
stockholder demands, have created strains on existing organizational forms. Fifty years 
ago companies could survive with only one or two product lines. The classical manage-
ment organization, as shown in Figure 3–1, was satisfactory for control, and conflicts were 
minimal.1
However, with the passing of time, companies found that survival depended on mul-
tiple product lines (i.e., diversification) and vigorous integration of technology into the 
existing organization. As organizations grew and matured, managers found that company 
activities were not being integrated effectively, and that new conflicts were arising in the 
well-established formal and informal channels. Managers began searching for more inno-
vative organizational forms that would alleviate these problems.
1.  Many authors refer to classical organizations as pure functional organizations. This can be seen from  
Figure 3–1. Also note that the department level is below the division level. In some organizations these titles are 
reversed.

Organizational Structures 
Before a valid comparison can be made with the newer forms, the advantages and 
disadvantages of the traditional structure must be shown. Table 3–1 lists the advantages 
of the traditional organization. As seen in Figure 3–1, the general manager has all of the 
functional entities necessary to perform R&D or develop and manufacture a product. All 
activities are performed within the functional groups and are headed by a department (or, in 
some cases, a division) head. Each department maintains a strong concentration of techni-
cal expertise. Since all projects must flow through the functional departments, each project 
can benefit from the most advanced technology, thus making this organizational form well 
suited to mass production. Functional managers can hire a wide variety of specialists and 
provide them with easily definable paths for career progression.
The functional managers maintain absolute control over the budget. They establish 
their own budgets, on approval from above, and specify requirements for additional person-
nel. Because the functional manager has manpower flexibility and a broad base from which 
to work, most projects are normally completed within cost.
Both the formal and informal organizations are well established, and levels of author-
ity and responsibility are clearly defined. Because each person reports to only one indi-
vidual, communication channels are well structured.
Yet, for each advantage, there is almost always a corresponding disadvantage  
(see Table 3–2). The majority of these disadvantages are related to the absence of a strong 
Table 3–1.  Advantages of the Traditional (Classical) Organization
• Easier budgeting and cost control are possible.
• Better technical control is possible.
•• Specialists can be grouped to share knowledge and responsibility.
•• Personnel can be used on many different projects.
•• All projects will benefit from the most advanced technology (better utilization of scarce personnel).
• Flexibility in the use of manpower.
• A broad manpower base to work with.
• Continuity in the functional disciplines; policies, procedures, and lines of responsibility are easily defined 
and understandable
• Admits mass production activities within established specifications.
• Good control over personnel, since each employee has one and only one person to report to.
• Communication channels are vertical and well established.
• Quick reaction capability exists, but may be dependent upon the priorities of the functional managers.
Table 3–2.  Disadvantages of the Traditional (Classical Organization)
• No one individual is directly responsible for the total project (i.e., no formal authority; committee solutions).
• Does not provide the project-oriented emphasis necessary to accomplish the project tasks.
• Coordination becomes complex, and additional lead time is required for approval of decisions.
• Decisions normally favor the strongest functional groups.
• No customer focal point.
• Response to customer needs is slow.
• Difficulty in pinpointing responsibility; this is the result of little or no direct project reporting, very little 
project-oriented planning, and no project authority.
• Motivation and innovation are decreased.
• Ideas tend to be functionally oriented with little regard for ongoing projects.

Pure Product (Projectized) Organization

central authority or individual responsible for the total project. As a result, integration 
of activities that cross functional lines becomes difficult, and top-level executives must 
get involved with the daily routine. Conflicts occur as each functional group struggles for 
power. Ideas may remain functionally oriented with very little regard for ongoing projects, 
and the decision-making process will be slow and tedious.
Because there is no customer focal point, all communications must be channeled 
through upper-level management. Upper-level managers then act in a customer-relations 
capacity and refer all complex problems down through the vertical chain of command to 
the functional managers. The response to the customer’s needs therefore becomes a slow 
and aggravating process.
Projects have a tendency to fall behind schedule in the classical organizational struc-
ture. Incredibly large lead times are required. Functional managers attend to those tasks 
that provide better benefits to themselves and their subordinates first.
With the growth of project management in the late 1960s, executives began to realize 
that many of the problems were the result of weaknesses in the traditional structure.

As the traditional organizational structure began to evolve and develop with varying 
degrees of success, the need for project management structures were conceived. The pure 
product organization, as shown in Figure 3–2, develops as a division within a division.

Organizational Structures 
As long as there exists a continuous flow of projects, work is stable and conflicts are at 
a ­minimum. The major advantage of this organizational flow is that one individual, the 
program manager, maintains complete line authority over the entire project. Not only 
does he assign work, but he also conducts merit reviews. Because each individual reports 
to only one person, strong communication channels develop that result in a very rapid 
reaction time.
In pure product organizations, long lead times became a thing of the past. Trade-off 
studies could be conducted as fast as time would permit without the need to look at the 
impact on other projects (unless, of course, identical facilities or equipment were required). 
Functional managers were able to maintain qualified staffs for new product development 
without sharing personnel with other programs and projects.
The responsibilities attributed to the project manager were entirely new. First, his 
authority was now granted by the vice president and general manager. The program man-
ager handled all conflicts, both those within his organization and those involving other 
projects. Interface management was conducted at the program manager level. Upper-level 
management was now able to spend more time on executive decision making than on con-
flict arbitration.
The major disadvantage with the pure project form is the cost of maintaining the 
organization. There is no chance for sharing an individual with another project in order to 
reduce costs. Personnel are usually attached to these projects long after they are needed 
because once an employee is given up, the project manager might not be able to get 
him back. Motivating personnel becomes a problem. At project completion, functional 
personnel do not “have a home” to return to. Many organizations place these individu-
als into an overhead labor pool from which selection can be made during new project 
development. People remaining in the labor pool may be laid off. As each project comes 
to a close, people become uneasy and often strive to prove their worth to the company by 
overachieving, a condition that is only temporary. It is very difficult for management to 
convince key functional personnel that they do, in fact, have career opportunities in this 
type of organization.
In pure functional (traditional) structures, technologies are well developed, but pro-
ject schedules often fall behind. In the pure project structure, the fast reaction time keeps 
activities on schedule, but technology suffers because without strong functional groups, 
which maintain interactive technical communication, the company’s outlook for meeting 
the competition may be severely hampered. The engineering department for one project 
might not communicate with its counterpart on other projects, resulting in duplication of 
efforts.
The last major disadvantage of this organizational form lies in the control of facili-
ties and equipment. The most frequent conflict occurs when two projects require use 
of the same piece of equipment or facilities at the same time. Upper-level management 
must then assign priorities to these projects. This is normally accomplished by defining 
certain projects as strategic, tactical, or operational—the same definitions usually given 
to plans.
Table 3–3 summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of this organizational 
form.

Matrix Organizational Form
95
3.4 MATRIX ORGANIZATIONAL FORM
The matrix organizational form is an attempt to combine the advan-
tages of the pure functional structure and the product organizational 
structure. This form is ideally suited for “project-driven” compa-
nies. Figure 3–3 shows a typical matrix structure. Each project manager reports directly 
to the vice president and general manager. Since each project represents a potential profit 
center, the power and authority used by the project manager come directly from the 
general manager. The project manager has total responsibility and accountability for 
project success. The functional departments, on the other hand, have functional respon-
sibility to maintain technical excellence on the project. Each functional unit is headed 
by a department manager whose prime responsibility is to ensure that a unified technical 
base is maintained and that all available information can be exchanged for each project. 
Department managers must also keep their people aware of the latest technical accom-
plishments in the industry.
Project management is a “coordinative” function, whereas matrix management is 
a collaborative function division of project management. In the coordinative or project 
organization, work is generally assigned to specific people or units who “do their own 
thing.” In the collaborative or matrix organization, information sharing may be mandatory, 
and several people may be required for the same piece of work. In a project organization,

2.4.4 Organizational Structure Types
Table 3–3.  Advantages and Disadvantages of the Product  
Organizational Form
Advantages
• Provides complete line authority over the project (i.e., strong control through a single project authority).
• Participants work directly for the project manager. Unprofitable product lines are easily identified and can be 
eliminated.
• Strong communications channels.
• Staffs can maintain expertise on a given project without sharing key personnel.
• Very rapid reaction time is provided.
• Personnel demonstrate loyalty to the project; better morale with product identification.
• A focal point develops for out-of-company customer relations.
• Flexibility in determining time (schedule), cost, and performance trade-offs.
• Interface management becomes easier as unit size is decreased.
• Upper-level management maintains more free time for executive decision making.
Disadvantages
• Cost of maintaining this form in a multiproduct company would be prohibitive due to duplication of effort, 
facilities, and personnel; inefficient usage.
• A tendency to retain personnel on a project long after they are needed. Upper-level management must 
balance workloads as projects start up and are phased out.
• Technology suffers because, without strong functional groups, outlook of the future to improve company’s 
capabilities for new programs would be hampered (i.e., no perpetuation of technology).
• Control of functional (i.e., organizational) specialists requires top-level coordination.
• Lack of opportunities for technical interchange between projects.
• Lack of career continuity and opportunities for project personnel.

96
Organizational Structures 
authority for decision making and direction rests with the project leader, whereas in a 
matrix it rests with the team.
Certain ground rules exist for matrix development:
●
●
Participants are full time on the project; this ensures a degree of loyalty.
●
●
Horizontal as well as vertical channels must exist for making commitments.
●
●
There must be quick and effective methods for conflict resolution.
●
●
There must be good communication channels and free access between managers.
●
●
All managers must have input into the planning process.
●
●
Both horizontally and vertically oriented managers must be willing to negotiate 
for resources.
●
●
The horizontal line must be permitted to operate as a separate entity except for 
administrative purposes.
The basis for the matrix approach is an attempt to create synergism through shared respon-
sibility between project and functional management. Yet this is easier said than done. No two 
working environments are the same, and, therefore, no two companies will have the same matrix 
design. The following questions must be answered before a matrix structure can be successful:
●
●
If each functional unit is responsible for one aspect of a project, and other parts 
are conducted elsewhere (possibly subcontracted to other companies), how can a 
synergistic environment be created?
●
●
Who decides which element of a project is most important?
●
●
How can a functional unit (operating in a vertical structure) answer questions 
and achieve project goals and objectives that are compatible with other projects?

The answers to these questions depend on mutual understanding between the pro-
ject and functional managers. Since both individuals maintain some degree of author-
ity, responsibility, and accountability on each project, they must continuously negotiate. 
Unfortunately, the program manager might only consider what is best for his project (dis-
regarding all others), whereas the functional manager might consider his organization more 
important than each project.
In order to get the job done, project managers need organizational status and author-
ity. A corporate executive contends that the organization chart shown in Figure 3–6 can 
be modified to show that the project managers have adequate organizational authority by 
placing the department manager boxes at the tip of the functional responsibility arrow-
heads. With this approach, the project managers appear to be higher in the organization 
than their departmental counterparts but are actually equal in status. Executives who  
prefer this method must exercise caution because the line and project managers may not 
feel that there is still a balance of power.
Problem solving in this environment is fragmented and diffused. The project manager 
acts as a unifying agent for project control of resources and technology. He must maintain 
open channels of communication to prevent suboptimization of individual projects.
In many situations, functional managers have the power to make a project manager 
look good, if they can be motivated to think about what is best for the project. Unfortu-
nately, this is not always accomplished. As stated by Mantell:2
There exists an inevitable tendency for hierarchically arrayed units to seek solutions and 
to identify problems in terms of scope of duties of particular units rather than looking 
beyond them. This phenomenon exists without regard for the competence of the executive 
concerned. It comes about because of authority delegation and functionalism.
The project environment and functional environment cannot be separated; they must 
interact. The location of the project and functional unit interface is the focal point for all 
activities.
The functional manager controls departmental resources (i.e., people). This poses a 
problem because, although the project manager maintains the maximum control (through 
the line managers) over all resources including cost and personnel, the functional manager 
must provide staff for the project’s requirements. It is therefore inevitable that conflicts 
occur between functional and project managers.
The matrix structure provides us with the best of two worlds: the traditional structure 
and the matrix structure. The advantages of the matrix structure eliminate almost all of the 
disadvantages of the traditional structure. The word “matrix” often brings fear to the hearts 
of executives because it implies radical change, or at least they think that it does. If we take 
a close look at Figure 3–3, we can see that the traditional structure is still there. The matrix 
is simply horizontal lines superimposed over the traditional structure. The horizontal lines 
will come and go as projects start up and terminate, but the traditional structure will remain.
Table 3–4 summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of this.

Table 3–4.  Advantages and Disadvantages of a Pure Matrix  
Organizational Form
Advantages 
• The project manager maintains maximum project control (through the line managers) over all resources, 
including cost and personnel.
• Policies and procedures can be set up independently for each project, provided that they do not contradict 
company policies and procedures.
• The project manager has the authority to commit company resources, provided that scheduling does not 
cause conflicts with other projects.
• Rapid responses are possible to changes, conflict resolution, and project needs (as technology or schedule).
• The functional organizations exist primarily as support for the project.
• Each person has a “home” after project completion. People are susceptible to motivation and end-item 
identification. Each person can be shown a career path.
• Because key people can be shared, the program cost is minimized. People can work on a variety of problems; 
that is, better people control is possible.
• A strong technical base can be developed, and much more time can be devoted to complex problem solving. 
Knowledge is available for all projects on an equal basis.
• Conflicts are minimal, and those requiring hierarchical referrals are more easily resolved.
• There is a better balance among time, cost, and performance.
• Rapid development of specialists and generalists occurs.
• Authority and responsibility are shared.
• Stress is distributed among the team (and the functional managers).
Disadvantages
• Multidimensional information flow.
• Multidimensional work flow.
• Dual reporting.
• Continuously changing priorities.
• Management goals different from project goals.
• Potential for continuous conflict and conflict resolution.
• Difficulty in monitoring and control.
• Company-wide, the organizational structure is not cost-effective because more people than necessary are 
required, primarily administrative.
• Each project organization operates independently. Care must be taken that duplication of efforts does not occur.
• More effort and time are needed initially to define policies and procedures, compared to traditional form.
• Functional managers may be biased according to their own set of priorities.
• Balance of power between functional and project organizations must be watched.
• Balance of time, cost, and performance must be monitored.
• Although rapid response time is possible for individual problem resolution, the reaction time can become quite slow.
• Employees and managers are more susceptible to role ambiguity than in traditional form.
• Conflicts and their resolution may be a continuous process (possibly requiring support of an organizational 
development specialist).
• People do not feel that they have any control over their own destiny when continuously reporting to multiple 
managers.
We should note that with proper executive-level planning and control, all of the disadvan-
tages can be eliminated. This is the only organizational form where such control is possible. 
But companies must resist creating more positions in executive management than are actually 
necessary as this will drive up overhead rates. However, there is a point where the matrix will 
become mature and fewer people will be required at the top levels of management.

3.5 MODIFICATION OF MATRIX STRUCTURES
The matrix can take many forms, but there are basically three common varieties. Each type 
represents a different degree of authority attributed to the program manager and indirectly 
identifies the relative size of the company. As an example, in the matrix of Figure 3–3, all 
program managers report directly to the general manager. This type of arrangement works 
best for small companies that have few projects and assumes that the general manager has 
sufficient time to coordinate activities between his project managers. In this type of arrange-
ment, all conflicts between projects are referred to the general manager for resolution.
As companies grow in size and the number of projects, the general manager will find 
it increasingly difficult to act as the focal point for all projects. A new position must be cre-
ated, that of director of programs, or manager of programs or projects, who is responsible 
for all program management. See Figure 3–4.
Finally, we must discuss the characteristics of a project engineer. In Figure 3–5, 
most people would place the project manager to the right of center with stronger human

skills than technical skills, and the project engineer to the left of center with stronger 
technical skills than human skills. How far from the center point will the project man-
ager and project engineer be? Today, many companies are merging project management 
and project engineering into one position. This can be seen in Table 3–5. The project 
manager and project engineer have similar functions above the line but different ones 
below the line.3
The main reason for separating project management from project engineering is so 
that the project engineer will remain “solid” to the director of engineering in order to have 
the full authority to give technical direction to engineering.

3.6 THE STRONG, WEAK, OR BALANCED MATRIX
Matrix structures can be strong, weak, or balanced. The strength of 
the matrix is based upon who has more influence over the daily per-
formance of the workers: project manager or line managers. If the 
project manager has more influence over the worker, then the matrix 
structure functions as a strong matrix as seen through the eyes of the 
project manager. If the line manager has more influence than does the project manager, 
then the organization functions as a weak matrix as seen by the project manager.
The most common differentiator between a strong and weak matrix is where the com-
mand of technology resides: project manager or line managers. If the project manager has 
a command of technology and is recognized by the line managers and the workers as being 
a technical expert, then the line managers will allow the workers to take technical direction 
from the project manager. This will result in a strong matrix structure. Workers will seek 
solutions to their problems from the project manager first and the line managers second. 
The reverse is true for a weak matrix. Project managers in a strong matrix generally possess 
more authority than in a weak matrix.
When a company desires a strong matrix, the project manager is generally promoted 
from within the organization and may have had assignments in several line functions 
throughout the organization. In a weak matrix, the company may hire from outside the 
organization but should at least require that the person selected understand the technology 
and the industry.
3.7 PROJECT MANAGEMENT OFFICES
In project-driven companies, the creation of a project management 
division is readily accepted as a necessity to conduct business. 
Organizational restructuring can quite often occur based on environ-
mental changes and customer needs. In non–project-driven organiza-
tions, employees are less tolerant of organizational change. Power, 
authority, and turf become important. The implementation of a separate division for project 
management is extremely difficult. Resistance can become so strong that the entire project 
management process can suffer.
Over the past two decades, non–project-driven as well as project-driven companies 
have created project management offices (PMOs) which previously were called centers 
for project management expertise. These PMOs are not necessarily formal line organiza-
tions, but may function more as informal committees whose membership may come from 
each functional unit of the company. This is dependent upon the size of the company. The 
assignment to the PMO can be part-time or full-time; it may be for only six months to a 
year; and it may or may not require the individual to manage projects.
As companies begin to recognize the favorable effect that project management has on 
profitability, emphasis is placed upon achieving professionalism in project management 
using the project office concept. The concept of a PMO could very well be the most important

project management activity in this decade. With this recognition of importance comes 
­strategic planning for both project management and the project office. Maturity and excel-
lence in project management do not occur simply by using project management over a pro-
longed period of time. Rather, it comes through strategic planning for project management.
Usually, the PMO has as its charter:
●
●
To develop and update a methodology for project management. The methodology 
usually advocates informal or flexible project management and treated as a frame-
work rather than as a methodology.
●
●
To act as a facilitator or trainer in conducting project management training programs.
●
●
To provide project management assistance to any employee who is currently manag-
ing projects and requires support in planning, scheduling, and controlling projects.
●
●
To develop or maintain files on “lessons learned” and to see that this information 
is made available to all project managers.

PMOs have become commonplace in the corporate hierarchy. Although the majority of 
activities assigned to the PMO had not changed, there was now a new mission for the PMO:
●
●
The PO now has the responsibility for maintaining all intellectual property related 
to project management and to actively support corporate strategic planning.

Selecting the Organizational Form
103
The PO was now servicing the corporation, especially the strategic planning activities 
for project management, rather than focusing on a specific customer. The PO was trans-
formed into a corporate center for control of project management intellectual property. 
This was a necessity as the magnitude of project management information grew almost 
exponentially throughout the organization.
All of the benefits of using a PMO are either directly or indirectly related to pro-
ject management intellectual property. To maintain the project management intellectual 
property, the PMO must maintain the vehicles for capturing the data and then dissemi-
nating the data to the various stakeholders. These vehicles include the company pro-
ject management intranet, project websites, project databases, and project management 
information systems. Since much of this information is necessary for both project man-
agement and corporate strategic planning, then there must exist strategic planning for 
the PMO.
3.8 SELECTING THE ORGANIZATIONAL FORM
Project management has matured as an outgrowth of the need to 
develop and produce complex and/or large projects in the shortest 
possible time, within anticipated cost, with required reliability and 
performance, and (when applicable) to realize a profit. Granted that 
organizations have become so complex that traditional organizational 
structures and relationships no longer allow for effective management, how can executives 
determine which organizational form is best, especially since some projects last for only a 
few weeks or months while others may take years?
To answer this question, we must first determine whether the necessary characteristics 
exist to warrant a project management organizational form. Generally speaking, the project 
management approach can be effectively applied to a onetime undertaking that is4:
●
●
Definable in terms of a specific goal
●
●
Infrequent, unique, or unfamiliar to the present organization
●
●
Complex with respect to interdependence of detailed tasks
●
●
Critical to the company
Once a group of tasks is selected and considered to be a project, the next step is to 
define the kinds of projects, described in Section 2.3. These include individual, staff, spe-
cial, and matrix or aggregate projects.
Unfortunately, many companies do not have a clear definition of what a project is. As 
a result, large project teams are often constructed for small projects when they could be 
handled more quickly and effectively by some other structural form. All structural forms 
have their advantages and disadvantages, but the project management approach appears to 
be the best possible alternative.

Organizational Structures 
The basic factors that influence the selection of a project organizational form are:
●
●
Typical project size
●
●
Typical project length
●
●
Span of control
●
●
Typical project cost
●
●
Experience with project management organization
●
●
Philosophy and visibility of upper-level management
●
●
Project location
●
●
Available resources
●
●
Unique aspects of the project
This last item requires further comment. Project management (especially with a matrix) 
usually works best for the control of human resources and thus may be more applicable 
to labor-intensive projects rather than capital-intensive projects. Labor-intensive organiza-
tions have formal project management, whereas capital-intensive organizations may use 
informal project management.
Four fundamental parameters must be analyzed when considering implementation of 
a project organizational form:
●
●
Integrating devices
●
●
Authority structure
●
●
Influence distribution
●
●
Information system
Project management is a means of integrating all company efforts, especially research 
and development, by selecting an appropriate organizational form. This can be accom-
plished formally or informally.
Informal integration works best if, and only if, effective collaboration can be achieved 
between conflicting units. Without any clearly defined authority, the role of the integrator 
is simply to act as an exchange medium across the interface of two functional units. As the 
size of the organization increases, formal integration positions must exist, especially in 
situations where intense conflict can occur (e.g., research and development).
Not all organizations need a pure matrix structure to achieve this integration. Many 
problems can be solved simply through the chain of command, depending on the size of 
the organization and the nature of the project. The organization needed to achieve project 
control can vary in size from one person to several thousand people. The organizational 
structure needed for effective project control is governed by the desires of top management 
and project circumstances.
Top management must decide on the authority structure that will control the integration 
mechanism. The authority structure can range from pure functional authority (traditional 
management), to product authority (product management), and finally to dual authority 
(matrix management). From a management point of view, organizational forms are often 
selected based on how much authority top management wishes to delegate or surrender.
Integration of activities across functional boundaries can also be accomplished by 
influence. Influence includes such factors as participation in budget planning and approval, 

Selecting the Organizational Form
105
design changes, location and size of offices, salaries, and so on. Influence can also cut 
administrative red tape and develop a much more unified informal organization.
Information systems also play an important role. They are designed to get the right 
information to the right person at the right time in a cost-effective manner. Organizational 
functions must facilitate the flow of information through the management network.
Galbraith has described additional factors that can influence organizational selection. 
These factors are5:
●
●
Diversity of product lines
●
●
Rate of change of the product lines
●
●
Interdependencies among subunits
●
●
Level of technology
●
●
Presence of economies of scale
●
●
Organizational size
A diversity of project lines requires both top-level and functional managers to main-
tain knowledge in all areas. A diversity is needed because the rate of change in customer 
demands will necessitate changes in the product lines. Diversity makes it more difficult for 
managers to make realistic estimates concerning resource allocations and the control of 
time, cost, schedules, and technology. The systems approach to management requires suf-
ficient information and alternatives to be available so that effective trade-offs can be estab-
lished. For diversity in a high-technology environment, the organizational choice might, in 
fact, be a trade-off between the flow of work and the flow of information. Diversity tends 
toward strong product authority and control.
Many functional organizations consider themselves companies within a company and 
pride themselves on their independence. This attitude poses a severe problem in trying to 
develop a synergistic atmosphere. Successful project management requires that functional 
units recognize the interdependence that must exist in order for technology to be shared 
and schedule dates to be met. Interdependency is also required in order to develop strong 
communication channels and coordination.
The use of new technologies poses a serious problem in that technical expertise must 
be established in all specialties, including engineering, production, material control, and 
safety. Maintaining technical expertise works best in strong functional disciplines, pro-
vided the information is not purchased outside the organization. The main problem, how-
ever, is how to communicate this expertise across functional lines. Independent R&D 
units can be established, as opposed to integrating R&D into each functional department’s 
routine efforts. Organizational control requirements are much more difficult in high-
technology industries with ongoing research and development than with pure production 
groups.
Economies of scale and size can also affect organizational selection. The economies 
of scale are most often controlled by the amount of physical resources that a company has 
available. The larger the economies of scale, the more the organization tends to favor pure 
functional management.

1971, pp. 29–40. Copyright © 1971 by the Board of Trustees at Indiana University.

106
Organizational Structures 
The size of the organization is important in that it can limit the amount of technical 
expertise in the economies of scale. While size may have little effect on the organizational 
structure, it does have a severe impact on the economies of scale. Small companies, for 
example, cannot maintain large specialist staffs and, therefore, incur a larger cost for lost 
specialization and lost economies of scale.
The way in which companies operate their project organization is bound to affect 
the organization, both during the operation of the project and after the project has been 
completed and personnel have been disbanded. The overall effects on the company must 
be looked at from a personnel and cost control standpoint. This will be accomplished, in 
depth, in later chapters. Although project management is growing, the creation of a project 
organization does not necessarily ensure that an assigned objective will be accomplished 
successfully. Furthermore, weaknesses can develop in the areas of maintaining capability 
and structural changes.
Although the project organization is a specialized, task-oriented entity, it seldom, if 
ever, exists apart from the traditional structure of the organization. All project management 
structures overlap the traditional structure. Furthermore, companies can have more than 
one project organizational form in existence at one time. A major steel product, for exam-
ple, has a matrix structure for R&D and a product structure elsewhere.
Accepting a project management structure is a giant step from which there may be no 
return. The company may have to create more management positions without changing 
the total employment levels. In addition, incorporation of a project organization is almost 
always accompanied by the upgrading of jobs. In any event, management must realize that 
whichever project management structure is selected, a dynamic state of equilibrium will 
be necessary.
3.9 STRATEGIC BUSINESS UNIT (SBU) PROJECT MANAGEMENT
During the past several years, large companies have restructured into strategic business 
units (SBUs). An SBU is a grouping of functional units that have the responsibility for 
profit (or loss) of part of the organization’s core businesses. Figure 3–6 shows how one of 
the automotive suppliers restructured into three SBUs; one each for Ford, Chrysler, and 
General Motors. Each strategic business unit is large enough to maintain its own project 
and program managers. The executive in charge of the strategic business unit may act as  
the sponsor for all the program and project managers with the SBU. The major benefit of 
these types of project management SBUs is that it allows the SBU to work more closely 
with the customer. It is a customer-focused organizational structure.
It is possible for some resources to be shared across several SBUs. Manufactur-
ing plants can end up supporting more than one SBU. Also, corporate may provide the 
resources for cost accounting, human resource management, and training.
A more recent organizational structure, and a more complex one, is shown in  
Figure 3–7. In this structure, each SBU may end up using the same platform (i.e., power-
train, chassis, and other underneath components). The platform managers are responsible 
for the design and enhancements of each platform, whereas the SBU program managers

must adapt this platform to a new model car. This type of matrix is multidimensional inas-
much as each SBU could already have an internal matrix. Also, each manufacturing plant 
could be located outside of the continental United States, making this structure a multina-
tional, multidimensional matrix.
3.10 TRANSITIONAL MANAGEMENT
Organizational redesign is occurring at a rapid rate because of shorter product life cycles, 
rapidly changing environments, accelerated development of sophisticated information 
­systems, and increased marketplace competitiveness. Because of these factors, more 
­companies are considering project management organizations as a solution.

Organizational Structures 
Why have some companies been able to implement this change in a short period of 
time while other companies require years? The answer is that successful implementation 
requires good transitional management.
Transitional management is the art and science of managing the conversion period 
from one organizational design to another. Transitional management necessitates an under-
standing of the new goals, objectives, roles, expectations, and employees’ fears.
A survey was conducted of executives, managers, and employees in thirty-eight com-
panies that had implemented matrix management. Almost all executives felt that the great-
est success could be achieved through proper training and education, both during and after 
transition. In addition to training, executives stated that the following fifteen challenges 
must be accounted for during transition:
●
●
Transfer of power. Some line managers will find it extremely difficult to accept 
someone else managing their projects, whereas some project managers will find it 
difficult to give orders to workers who belong to someone else.
●
●
Trust. The secret to a successful transition without formal executive authority will 
be trust between line managers, between project managers, and between project 
and line managers. It takes time for trust to develop. Senior management should 
encourage it throughout the transition life cycle.
●
●
Policies and procedures. The establishment of well-accepted policies and pro-
cedures is a slow and tedious process. Trying to establish rigid policies and 
procedures at project initiation will lead to difficulties.
●
●
Hierarchical consideration. During transition, every attempt should be made to mini-
mize hierarchical considerations that could affect successful organizational maturity.
●
●
Priority scheduling. Priorities should be established only when needed, not on a con-
tinual basis. If priority shifting is continual, confusion and disenchantment will occur.
●
●
Personnel problems. During transition there will be personnel problems brought 
on by moving to new locations, status changes, and new informal organizations. 
These problems should be addressed on a continual basis.
●
●
Communications. During transition, new channels of communications should be 
built but not at the expense of old ones. Transition phases should show employees 
that communication can be multidirectional, for example, a project manager talk-
ing directly to functional employees.
●
●
Project manager acceptance. Resistance to the project manager position can be con-
trolled through proper training. People tend to resist what they do not understand.
●
●
Competition. Although some competition is healthy within an organization, it can 
be detrimental during transition. Competition should not be encouraged at the 
expense of the total organization.
●
●
Tools. It is common practice for each line organization to establish its own tools 
and techniques. During transition, no attempt should be made to force the line 
organizations to depart from their current practices. Rather, it is better for the pro-
ject managers to develop tools and techniques that can be integrated with those in 
the functional groups.
●
●
Contradicting demands. During transition and after maturity, contradicting 
demands will be a way of life. When they first occur during transition, they should 
be handled in a “working atmosphere” rather than a crisis mode.

Seven Fallacies That Delay Project Management Maturity
109
●
●
Reporting. If any type of standardization is to be developed, it should be for pro-
ject status reporting, regardless of the size of the project.
●
●
Teamwork. Systematic planning with strong functional input will produce team-
work. Using planning groups during transition will not obtain the necessary func-
tional and project commitments.
●
●
Theory X–Theory Y. During transition, functional employees may soon find themselves 
managed under either Theory X or Theory Y approaches. People must realize (through 
training) that this is a way of life in project management, especially during crises.
●
●
Overmanagement costs. A mistake often made by executives is thinking that pro-
jects can be managed with fewer resources. This usually leads to disaster because 
undermanagement costs may be an order of magnitude greater than overmanage-
ment costs when problems arise.
Transition to a project-driven matrix organization is not easy. Managers and profes-
sionals contemplating such a move should know:
●
●
Proper planning and organization of the transition on a life-cycle basis will facili-
tate a successful change.
●
●
Training of the executives, line managers, and employees in project management 
knowledge, skills, and attitudes is critical to a successful transition and probably 
will shorten the transition time.
●
●
Employee involvement and acceptance may be the single most important function 
during transition.
●
●
The strongest driving force of success during transition is a demonstration of com-
mitment to and involvement in project management by senior executives.
●
●
Organizational behavior becomes important during transition.
●
●
Commitments made by senior executives prior to transition must be preserved dur-
ing and following transition.
●
●
Major concessions by senior management will come slowly.
●
●
Schedule or performance compromises are not acceptable during transition; cost 
overruns may be acceptable.
●
●
Conflict among participants increases during transition.
●
●
If project managers are willing to manage with only implied authority during tran-
sition, then the total transition time may be drastically reduced.
●
●
It is not clear how long transition will take.
Making the transition from a classical or product organization to a project-driven 
organization is not easy. With proper understanding, training, demonstrated commitment, 
and patience, the transition will have a good chance for success.
3.11 SEVEN FALLACIES THAT DELAY PROJECT  
MANAGEMENT MATURITY
All too often, companies embark upon a journey to implement project management only 
to discover that the path they thought was clear and straightforward is actually filled with 
obstacles and fallacies. Without sufficient understanding of the looming roadblocks and 

110
Organizational Structures 
how to overcome them, an organization may never reach a high level of project man-
agement maturity. Their competitors, on the other hand, may require only a few years 
to implement an organization-wide strategy that predictably and consistently delivers 
successful projects.
One key obstacle to project management maturity is that implementation activities are 
often spearheaded by people in positions of authority within an organization. These people 
often have a poor understanding of project management yet are unwilling to attend training 
programs, even short ones, to capture a basic understanding of what is required to success-
fully bring project management implementation to maturity. A second key obstacle is that 
these same people often make implementation decisions based upon personal interests or 
hidden agendas. Both obstacles cause project management implementation to suffer.
The fallacies affecting the maturity of a project management implementation do not 
necessarily prevent project management from occurring. Instead, these mistaken beliefs 
elongate the implementation time frame and create significant frustration in the project 
management ranks. The seven most common fallacies are explained below.
Fallacy 1: Our ultimate goal is to implement project management. Wrong goal! 
The ultimate goal must be the progressive development of project management systems 
and processes that consistently and predictably result in a continuous stream of successful 
projects. A successful implementation occurs in the shortest amount of time and causes no 
disruption to the existing work flow. Anyone can purchase a software package and imple-
ment project management piecemeal. But effective project management systems and pro-
cesses do not necessarily result. And successfully completing one or two projects does not 
mean that only successfully managed projects will continue.
Fallacy 2: We need to establish a mandatory number of forms, templates, guide-
lines, and checklists by a certain point in time. Wrong criteria! Project management 
maturity can be evaluated only by establishing time-based levels of maturity and by using 
assessment instruments for measurement. While it is true that forms, guidelines, templates, 
and checklists are necessities, maximizing their number or putting them in place does not 
equal project management maturity. Many project management practitioners believe that 
project management maturity can be accelerated if the focus is on the development of an 
organization-wide project management methodology that everyone buys into and supports.
Methodologies should be designed to streamline the way the organization handles 
projects. For example, when a project is completed, the team should be debriefed to capture 
lessons learned and best practices. The debriefing session often uncovers ways to minimize 
or combine processes and improve efficiency and effectiveness without increasing costs.
Fallacy 3: We need to purchase project management software to accelerate the 
maturity process. Wrong approach! Purchasing software just for the sake of having it is 
a bad idea. Too often, decision makers purchase project management software based upon 
the “bells and whistles” that are packaged with it, believing that a larger project manage-
ment software package can accelerate maturity.
The goal of software selection must be the benefits to the project and the organization, 
such as cost reductions through efficiency, effectiveness, standardization, and consistency. A 
$500 software package can, more often than not, reduce project costs just as effectively as a 
$200,000 package. What is unfortunate is that the people who order the software focus more on 
the number of packaged features than on how much money will be saved by using the software.

Fallacy 4: We need to implement project management in small steps with a small 
breakthrough project that everyone can track. Wrong method! This works if time is not 
a constraint. The best bet is to use a large project as the breakthrough project. A success-
fully managed large project implies that the same processes can work on small projects, 
whereas the reverse is not necessarily true.
On small breakthrough projects, some people will always argue against the implementa-
tion of project management and find numerous examples why it will not work. Using a large 
project generally comes with less resistance, especially if project execution proceeds smoothly.
Fallacy 5: We need to track and broadcast the results of the breakthrough pro-
ject. Wrong course of action! Expounding a project’s success benefits only that project 
rather than the entire company. Illuminating how project management caused a project to 
succeed benefits the entire organization. People then understand that project management 
can be used on a multitude of projects.
Fallacy 6: We need executive support. Almost true! We need visible executive sup-
port. People can easily differentiate between genuine support and lip service. Executives 
must walk the talk. They must hold meetings to demonstrate their support of project man-
agement and attend various project team meetings. They must maintain an open-door pol-
icy for problems that occur during project management implementation.
Fallacy 7: We need a project management course so our workers can become Pro-
ject Management Professionals (PMPs). Getting closer! What is really needed is lifelong 
education in project management. Becoming a PMP® is just the starting point. There is life 
beyond the PMBOK® Guide. Continuous organization-wide project management education 
is the fastest way to accelerate maturity in project management.
Needless to say, significantly more fallacies than discussed here are out there waiting 
to block your project management implementation and delay its maturity. What is critical 
is that your organization implements project management through a well-thought-out plan 
that receives organization-wide buy-in and support. Fallacies create unnecessary delays. 
Identifying and overcoming faulty thinking can help fast-track your organization’s project 
management maturity.

Organizing and Staffing 
the Project Office and Team
4.0 INTRODUCTION
Successful project management, regardless of the organizational 
structure, is only as good as the individuals and leaders who are 
managing the key functions. Project management is not a one-person 
operation; it requires a group of individuals dedicated to the achieve-
ment of a specific goal. Project management includes:
●
●
A project manager
●
●
Assistant project managers if necessary
●
●
A project (home) office
●
●
A project team
Large projects may require a project office (PO) for the management of a single project. The PO 
should not be confused with the PMO discussed in Chapter 3. Generally, project office personnel are 
assigned full-time to the project and work out of the project office, whereas the project team members 
work out of the functional units and may spend only a small percentage of their time on the project. Nor-
mally, project office personnel report directly to the project manager, but they may still be solid to their 
line function just for administrative control. A project office usually is not required on small projects, 
and sometimes the project can be accomplished by just one person who may fill all of the project office 
positions.
Before the staffing function begins, five basic questions are usually considered:
1.	 What are the requirements for an individual to become a successful project manager?
2.	 Who should be a member of the project team?

Organizing and Staffing the Project Office and Team 
3.	 Who should be a member of the project office?
4.	 What problems can occur during recruiting activities?
5.	 What can happen downstream to cause the loss of key team members?
On the surface, these questions may not seem especially complex. But when we apply them to a project 
environment (which is by definition a “temporary” situation), where a constant stream of projects is neces-
sary for corporate growth, the staffing problems become complex, especially if the organization is under-
staffed or lacks workers with the necessary skills.
4.1 THE STAFFING ENVIRONMENT
To understand the problems that occur during staffing, we must first 
investigate the characteristics of project management, including 
the project environment, the project management process, and the 
project manager.
Two major kinds of problems are related to the project environment: personnel perfor-
mance problems and personnel policy problems. Performance is difficult for many individ-
uals in the project environment because it represents a change in the way of doing business. 
Individuals, regardless of how competent they are, find it difficult to adapt continually to a 
changing situation in which they report to multiple managers.
On the other hand, many individuals thrive on temporary assignments because it gives 
them a “chance for glory.” Unfortunately, some employees might consider the chance for 
glory more important than the project. For example, an employee may pay no attention to 
the instructions of the project manager and instead perform the task his own way. In this 
situation, the employee wants only to be recognized as an achiever and really does not care 
if the project is a success or failure, as long as he still has a functional home to return to 
where he will be identified as an achiever with good ideas.
The second major performance problem lies in the project–functional interface, where 
an individual suddenly finds himself reporting to two bosses, the functional manager and 
the project manager. If the functional manager and the project manager are in agreement 
about the work to be accomplished, then performance may not be hampered. But if con-
flicting directions are received, then the individual may let his performance suffer because 
of his compromising position. In this case, the employee will “bend” in the direction of the 
manager who controls his purse strings.
Personnel policy problems can create havoc in an organization, especially if the “grass 
is greener” in a project environment than in the functional environment. Functional organi-
zations normally specify grades and salaries for employees. Project offices, on the other 
hand, have no such requirements and can promote and pay according to achievement. 
Bonuses are also easier to obtain in the project office but may create conflict and jealousy 
between the horizontal and vertical elements.
Because each project is different, the project management process allows each project 
to have its own policies, procedures, rules, and standards, provided they fall within broad 
PMBOK ® Guide, 6th Edition
9.1 Plan Resource Management

Selecting the Project Manager: An Executive Decision
117
company guidelines. Each project must be recognized as a project by top management so 
that the project manager has the delegated authority necessary to enforce the policies, pro-
cedures, rules, and standards.
Project management is successful only if the project manager and his team are 
totally dedicated to the successful completion of the project. This requires each team 
member of the project team and office to have a good understanding of the project 
requirements.
Ultimately, the person with the greatest influence during the staffing phase is the 
project manager. The personal attributes and abilities of project managers will either 
attract or deter highly desirable individuals. Project managers must exhibit honesty and 
integrity to foster an atmosphere of trust. They should not make impossible promises, 
such as immediate promotions for everyone if a follow-on contract is received. Also, on 
temporarily assigned activities, such as a project, managers cannot wait for personnel to 
iron out their own problems because time, cost, and performance requirements will not 
be satisfied.
Project managers should have both business management and technical exper-
tise. They must understand the fundamental principles of management, especially 
those involving the rapid development of temporary communication channels. Project 
managers must understand the technical implications of a problem, since they are 
ultimately responsible for all decision making. However, many good technically ori-
ented managers have failed because they have become too involved with the technical 
side of the project rather than the management side. There are strong arguments for 
having a project manager who has more than just an understanding of the necessary 
technology.
Because a project has a relatively short time duration, decision making must be rapid 
and effective. Managers must be alert and quick in their ability to perceive “red flags” that 
can eventually lead to serious problems. They must demonstrate their versatility and tough-
ness in order to keep subordinates dedicated to goal accomplishment. Executives must 
realize that the project manager’s objectives during staffing are to:
●
●
Acquire the best available assets and try to improve them
●
●
Provide a good working environment for all personnel
●
●
Make sure that all resources are applied effectively and efficiently so that all con-
straints are met, if possible
4.2 SELECTING THE PROJECT MANAGER: AN EXECUTIVE DECISION
Probably the most difficult decision facing upper-level management 
is the selection of project managers. Some managers work best on 
long-duration projects where decision making can be slow; others 
may thrive on short duration projects that can result in a constant-
pressure environment.

118
Organizing and Staffing the Project Office and Team 
The selection process for project managers is not easy. Five basic questions must 
be considered:
1.	 What are the internal and external sources?
2.	 How do we select?
3.	 How do we provide career development in project management?
4.	 How can we develop project management skills in a reasonable time frame?
5.	 How do we evaluate project management performance?
Project management cannot succeed unless a good project manager is at the controls. 
It is far more likely project managers will succeed if it is obvious to the subordinates the 
general manager has appointed them. Usually, a brief memo to the line managers will suf-
fice. The major responsibilities of the project manager include:
●
●
To produce the end-item with the available resources and within the constraints of 
time, cost, and performance/technology
●
●
To meet contractual profit objectives
●
●
To make all required decisions whether they be for alternatives or termination
●
●
To act as the customer (external) and upper-level and functional management 
(internal) communications focal point
●
●
To “negotiate” with all functional disciplines for accomplishment of the necessary 
work packages within the constraints of time, cost, and performance/technology
●
●
To resolve all conflicts
In order for project managers to fulfill their responsibilities successfully, they are con-
stantly required to demonstrate their skills in interface, resource, and planning and control 
management. These implicit responsibilities are:
●
●
Interface Management
●
●
Product interfaces
●
●
Performance of parts or subsections
●
●
Physical connection of parts or subsections
●
●
Project interfaces

Finding the person with the right qualifications is not an easy task because the selec-
tion of project managers is based more on personal characteristics than on the job descrip-
tion. Russell Archibald defines a broader range of desired personal characteristics1:
●
●
Flexibility and adaptability
●
●
Preference for significant initiative and leadership
●
●
Aggressiveness, confidence, persuasiveness, verbal fluency
●
●
Ambition, activity, forcefulness
●
●
Effectiveness as a communicator and integrator
●
●
Broad scope of personal interests
●
●
Poise, enthusiasm, imagination, spontaneity
●
●
Able to balance technical solutions with time, cost, and human factors
●
●
Well organized and disciplined
●
●
A generalist rather than a specialist
●
●
Able and willing to devote most of his time to planning and controlling
●
●
Able to identify problems
●
●
Willing to make decisions
●
●
Able to maintain proper balance in the use of time
The best project managers are willing and able to identify their own shortcomings and 
know when to ask for help.
So far we have discussed the personal characteristics of the project manager. There are 
also job-related questions to consider, such as:
●
●
Are feasibility and economic analyses necessary?
●
●
Is complex technical expertise required? If so, is it within the individual’s capabilities?
●
●
If the individual is lacking expertise, will there be sufficient backup strength in the 
line organizations?
●
●
Is this the company’s or the individual’s first exposure to this type of project and/
or client? If so, what are the risks to be considered?
●
●
What is the priority for this project, and what are the risks?
●
●
With whom must the project manager interface, both inside and outside the 
organization?

While there may sometimes be some degree of commonality about the leadership 
qualities that every project manager should possess, industry and company requirements 
play a dominant role. According to Anthony Walker2:
These qualities can be split into characteristics and skills. Project manager’s 
characteristics will in many cases determine how they will deploy their skills. Examples 
of the characteristics which help to form good leaders in construction project manage-
ment are:
●
●
Integrity
●
●
Preferred leadership style (tending towards democratic)
●
●

4.3 SKILL REQUIREMENTS FOR PROJECT AND PROGRAM MANAGERS
To get results, the project manager must relate to (1) the people to 
be managed, (2) the task to be done, (3) the tools available, (4) the 
organizational structure, and (5) the organizational environment, 
including the customer community.
With an understanding of the interaction of corporate organiza-
tion and behavior elements, the manager can build an environment 
conducive to the working team’s needs. In addition, the project manager must understand 
the culture and value system of the organization he is working with. Effective project 
management is directly related to proficiency in the following ten skills:
  1.	 Team building
  2.	 Leadership
  3.	 Conflict resolution
  4.	 Technical expertise
  5.	 Planning
  6.	 Organization
  7.	 Entrepreneurship
  8.	 Administration
  9.	 Management support
10.	 Resource allocation
The days of the manager who gets by with technical expertise alone or pure adminis-
trative skills are gone.

1.2.3.2 Program Management
Building the project team is one of the prime responsibilities of the 
project manager. Team building involves a whole spectrum of man-
agement skills required to identify, commit, and integrate the various 
task groups from the traditional functional organization into a single project manage-
ment system.
Team-Building Skills

122
Organizing and Staffing the Project Office and Team 
To be effective, the project manager must provide an atmosphere conducive to team-
work. A climate with the following characteristics must be nurtured:
●
●
Team members committed to the project
●
●
Good interpersonal relations and team spirit
●
●
The necessary expertise and resources
●
●
Clearly defined goals and project objectives
●
●
Involved and supportive top management
●
●
Good project leadership
●
●
Open communication among team members and support organizations
●
●
A low degree of detrimental interpersonal and intergroup conflict
Three major considerations are involved in all of the above factors: (1) effective com-
munications, (2) sincere interest in the professional growth of team members, and (3) 
commitment to the project.
A prerequisite for project success is the project manager’s ability to 
lead the team within a relatively unstructured environment. It involves 
dealing effectively with managers and supporting personnel across functional lines and the 
ability to collect and filter relevant data for decision making in a dynamic environment. 
It involves the ability to integrate individual demands, requirements, and limitations into 
decisions and to resolve intergroup conflicts.
As with a general manager, quality leadership depends heavily on the project manag-
er’s personal experience and credibility within the organization. An effective management 
style might be characterized this way:
●
●
Clear project leadership and direction
●
●
Assistance in problem solving
●
●
Facilitating the integration of new members into the team
●
●
Ability to handle interpersonal conflict
●
●
Facilitating group decisions
●
●
Capability to plan and elicit commitments
●
●
Ability to communicate clearly
●
●
Presentation of the team to higher management
●
●
Ability to balance technical solutions against economic and human factors
The personal traits desirable and supportive of the above skills are:
●
●
Project management experience
●
●
Flexibility and change orientation
●
●
Innovative thinking
●
●
Initiative and enthusiasm
●
●
Charisma and persuasiveness
●
●
Organization and discipline
Leadership Skills

Conflict is fundamental to complex task management. Understanding 
the determinants of conflicts is important to the project manager’s abil-
ity to deal with conflicts effectively. When conflict becomes dysfunctional, it often results 
in poor project decision making, lengthy delays over issues, and a disruption of the team’s 
efforts, all negative influences to project performance. However, conflict can be beneficial 
when it produces involvement and new information and enhances the competitive spirit.
To successfully resolve conflict and improve overall project performance, project man-
agers must:
●
●
Understand interaction of the organizational and behavioral elements in order 
to build an environment conducive to their team’s motivational needs. This will 
enhance active participation and minimize unproductive conflict.
●
●
Communicate effectively with all organizational levels regarding both project 
objectives and decisions. Regularly scheduled status review meetings can be an 
important communication vehicle.
●
●
Recognize the determinants of conflict and their timing in the project life cycle. 
Effective project planning, contingency planning, securing of commitments, and 
involving top management can help to avoid or minimize many conflicts before 
they impede project performance.
Conflict Resolution Skills
The project manager rarely has all the technical, administrative, and 
marketing expertise needed to direct the project single-handedly. It is 
essential, however, for the project manager to understand the technology, the markets, and 
the environment of the business. Without this understanding, the consequences of local 
decisions on the total project, the potential growth ramifications, and relationships to other 
business opportunities cannot be foreseen by the manager. Further technical expertise is 
necessary to evaluate technical concepts and solutions, to communicate effectively in tech-
nical terms with the project team, and to assess risks and make trade-offs between cost, 
schedule, and technical issues. Frequently, the project begins with an exploratory phase 
leading into a proposal. This is normally an excellent testing ground for the future project 
manager. It also allows top management to judge the new candidate’s capacity for manag-
ing the technological innovations and integration of solutions.
Technical Skills
Planning skills are helpful for any undertaking; they are absolutely 
essential for the successful management of large complex projects. The 
project plan is the road map that defines how to get from the start to the final results. Project 
planning is an ongoing activity at all organizational levels. However, the preparation of a 
project summary plan, prior to project start, is the responsibility of the project manager. 
Effective project planning requires particular skills far beyond writing a document with 
schedules and budgets. It requires communication and information processing skills to 
define the actual resource requirements and administrative support necessary. It requires 
the ability to negotiate the necessary resources and commitments from key personnel in 
various support organizations with little or no formal authority.
In addition, the project manager must assure that the plan remains a viable docu-
ment. Changes in project scope and depth are inevitable. The plan should reflect necessary 
Planning Skills
Skill Requirements for Project and Program Managers
123

124
Organizing and Staffing the Project Office and Team 
changes through formal revisions and should be the guiding document throughout the life 
cycle of the project. An obsolete or irrelevant plan is useless.
Finally, project managers need to be aware that planning can be overdone. If not con-
trolled, planning can become an end in itself and a poor substitute for innovative work. It 
is the responsibility of the project manager to build flexibility into the plan and police it 
against misuse.
The project manager must be a social architect; that is, he must under-
stand how the organization works and how to work with the organiza-
tion. Organizational skills are particularly important during project formation and start-up 
when the project manager is integrating people from many different disciplines into an 
effective work team. It requires defining the reporting relationships, responsibilities, lines 
of control, and information needs. A good project plan and a task matrix are useful organi-
zational tools. In addition, the organizational effort is facilitated by clearly defined project 
objectives, open communication channels, good project leadership, and senior manage-
ment support.
Organizational Skills
The project manager also needs a general management perspective. For 
example, economic considerations affect the organization’s financial 
performance, but objectives often are much broader than profits. Customer satisfaction, 
future growth, cultivation of related market activities, and minimum organizational disrup-
tions of other projects might be equally important goals. The effective project manager is 
concerned with all these issues. Entrepreneurial skills are developed through actual experi-
ence. However, formal MBA-type training, special seminars, and cross-functional training 
projects can help to develop the entrepreneurial skills needed by project managers.
Entrepreneurial Skills
Administrative skills are essential. The project manager must be expe-
rienced in planning, staffing, budgeting, scheduling, and other control 
techniques. In dealing with technical personnel, the problem is seldom to make people 
understand administrative techniques such as budgeting and scheduling, but to impress on 
them that costs and schedules are just as important as elegant technical solutions.
Some helpful tools for the manager in the administration of his project include: 
(1) the meeting, (2) the report, (3) the review, and (4) the budget and schedule controls. 
­Project managers must be thoroughly familiar with these available tools and know how to 
use them effectively.
Administrative Skills
The project manager is surrounded by a myriad of organizations 
that Building Skills either support him or control his activities. An 
understanding of these interfaces is important to project managers as it enhances their 
ability to build favorable relationships with senior management. Project organizations 
are shared-power systems with personnel of many diverse interests and “ways of doing 
things.” Only a strong leader backed by senior management can prevent the development 
of unfavorable biases.
Management Support

Special Cases in Project Manager Selection
125
Four key variables influence the project manager’s ability to create favorable relation-
ships with senior management: (1) his ongoing credibility, (2) the visibility of his project, 
(3) the priority of his project relative to other organizational undertakings, and (4) his own 
accessibility.
A project organization has many bosses. Functional lines often shield 
support organizations from direct financial control by the project office. 
Once a task has been authorized, it is often impossible to control the personnel assign-
ments, priorities, and indirect manpower costs. In addition, profit accountability is difficult 
owing to the interdependencies of various support departments and the often changing 
work scope and contents.
Effective and detailed project planning may facilitate commitment and reinforce con-
trol. Part of the plan is the “Statement of Work,” which establishes a basis for resource 
allocation. It is also important to work out specific agreements with all key contributors 
and their superiors on the tasks to be performed and the associated budgets and schedules. 
Measurable milestones are not only important for hardware components, but also for the 
“invisible” project components such as systems and software tasks.
4.4 SPECIAL CASES IN PROJECT MANAGER SELECTION
Thus far we have assumed that the project is large enough for a full-time project manager 
to be appointed. This is not always the case. There are four major problem areas in staffing 
projects:
●
●
Part-time versus full-time assignments
●
●
Several projects assigned to one project manager
●
●
Projects assigned to functional managers
●
●
The project manager role retained by the general manager
The first problem is generally related to the size of the project. If the project is small 
(in time duration or cost), a part-time project manager may be selected. Many executives 
have fallen into the trap of letting line personnel act as part-time project managers while 
still performing line functions. If the employee has a conflict between what is best for the 
project and what is best for his line organization, the project will suffer. It is only natural 
that the employee will favor the place the salary increases come from.
It is a common practice for one project manager to control several projects, especially 
if they are either related, similar, small in size and may not justify a full time project man-
ager. Problems come about when the projects have drastically different priorities. The low-
priority efforts will be neglected.
If the project is a high-technology effort that requires specialization and can be per-
formed by one department, then it is not unusual for the line manager to take on a dual 
role and act as project manager as well. This can be difficult to do, especially if the project 
Resource Allocation Skills

126
Organizing and Staffing the Project Office and Team 
manager is required to establish the priorities for the work under his supervision. The line 
manager may keep the best resources for the project, regardless of the priority. Then that 
project will be a success at the expense of every other project he must supply resources to.
Probably the worst situation is that in which an executive fills the role of project man-
ager for a particular effort. The executive may not have the time necessary for total dedi-
cation to the achievement of the project. He cannot make effective decisions as a project 
manager while still discharging normal duties. Additionally, the executive may hoard the 
best resources for his project.
4.5 TODAY’S PROJECT MANAGERS
The skills needed to be an effective, twenty-first-century project manager have changed 
from those needed during the 1980s. As project management began to grow and mature, 
the project manager was converted from a technical manager to a business manager. The 
primary skills needed to be an effective project manager in the twenty-first century are:
●
●
Knowledge of the business
●
●
Risk management
●
●
Integration skills
The critical skill is risk management. However, to perform risk management effec-
tively, a sound knowledge of the business is required. Figure 4–1 shows the changes in 
project management skills needed between 1985 and 2016.
As projects become larger, the complexities of integration management become more 
pronounced. Figure 4–2 illustrates the importance of integration management. In 1985, pro-
ject managers spent most of their time planning and replanning with their team. This was 
necessary because the project manager was the technical expert. Today, the project man-
ager’s efforts are heavily oriented toward integration of the function plans into a total project

4.6 DUTIES AND JOB DESCRIPTIONS
Since projects, environments, and organizations differ from company 
to company as well as project to project, it is not unusual for compa-
nies to struggle to provide reasonable job descriptions of the project 
manager and associated personnel.
Because of the potential overlapping nature of job descriptions in a project manage-
ment environment, some companies try to define responsibilities for each project manage-
ment position, as shown in Table 4–1.

4.7 THE ORGANIZATIONAL STAFFING PROCESS
Staffing the project organization can become a long and tedious 
effort, especially on large and complex engineering projects. Three 
major questions must be answered:
●
●
What people resources are required?
●
●
Where will the people come from?
●
●
What type of project organizational structure will be best?
To determine the people resources required, the types of individuals (possibly job 
descriptions) must be decided on, as well as how many individuals from each job category 
are necessary and when these individuals will be needed. Other factors to be considered 
include the cost of the resources, their availability over the duration of the project, their 
skill level, training needs and your previous experience working with them. The organi-
zational staffing process time can be reduced if a resource management plan is created to 
address these three questions.
Consider the following situation: As a project manager, you have an activity that 
requires three separate tasks, all performed within the same line organization. The line 
manager promises you the best available resources right now for the first task but cannot

make any commitments beyond that. The line manager may have only below-average 
workers available for the second and third tasks. However, the line manager is willing to 
make a deal with you. He can give you an employee who can do the work but will only 
give an average performance. If you accept the average employee, the line manager will 
guarantee that the employee will be available to you for all three tasks. How important is 
continuity to you? There is no clearly definable answer to this question. Some people will 
always want the best resources and are willing to fight for them, whereas others prefer 
continuity and dislike seeing new people coming and going.
Mutual trust between project and line managers is crucial, especially during staffing 
sessions. Once a project manager has developed a good working relationship with employ-
ees, the project manager would like to keep those individuals assigned to his activities. 
There is nothing wrong with a project manager requesting the same administrative and/or 
technical staff as before. Line managers realize this and usually agree to it.
There must also be mutual trust between the project managers themselves. Project 
managers must work as a team, recognize each other’s needs, and be willing to make deci-
sions that are in the best interest of the company.
Once the resources are defined as in the resource management plan, the next question 
must be whether staffing will be from within the existing organization or from outside 
sources, such as new hires or consultants. Outside consultants are advisable if, and only if, 
internal manpower resources are being fully utilized on other projects, or if the company 
does not possess the required project skills. The answer to this question will indicate which 
organizational form is best for achievement of the objectives. The form might be a virtual 
team, matrix, product, or staff project management structure.
Selecting the project manager is the beginning of the organizational staffing process. 
The next step, selecting the project office personnel and team members, can be a time-
consuming chore. The project office consists of personnel who are usually assigned as 
full-time members of the project. The evaluation process should include active project 
team members, functional team members available for promotion or transfer, and outside 
applicants.
Upon completion of the evaluation process, the project manager meets with upper-
level management. This coordination is required to assure that:
●
●
All assignments fall within current policies on rank, salary, and promotion.
●
●
The individuals selected can work well with both the project manager (formal 
reporting) and upper-level management (informal reporting).
●
●
The individuals selected have good working relationships with the functional 
­personnel.
Good project office personnel usually have experience with several types of projects 
and are self-disciplined.
If the resources needed are currently assigned on other projects, then a meeting is 
held between the project manager, upper-level management, and the project manager on 
whose project the requested individuals are currently assigned. Project managers are very 
reluctant to give up qualified personnel to other projects, but unfortunately, this procedure 
is a way of life in a project environment. Upper-level management attends these meetings 

130
Organizing and Staffing the Project Office and Team 
to show all negotiating parties that top management is concerned with maintaining the best 
possible mix of individuals from available resources and to help resolve staffing conflicts. 
Staffing from within is a negotiation process in which upper-level management establishes 
the ground rules and priorities.
Figure 4–3 shows the typical staffing pattern as a function of time. Staff is provided 
from functional areas or from workers being released from other projects. People should 
be brought on board as needed, but most project managers would like to get their project 
staffed quickly for fear of losing the workers to another project. In an ideal situation the 
workers would be released from the project as early as possible for work on other projects. 
But as seen by the low slope in Figure 4–3, project managers tend to release workers at a 
much slower rate than bringing them on board because they want to be absolutely sure that 
the workers are no longer needed.
Thus far we have discussed staffing the project on the assumption that the workers are 
performing as expected. Unfortunately, there are situations in which employees must be 
terminated from the project because of:
●
●
Nonacceptance of rules, policies, and procedures
●
●
Nonacceptance of established formal authority
●
●
Professionalism being more important to them than company loyalty
●
●
Focusing on technical aspects at the expense of the budget and schedule
●
●
Incompetence
There are three possible solutions for working with incompetent personnel. First, 
the project manager can provide an on-the-spot appraisal of the employee. This includes 
identification of weaknesses, corrective action to be taken, and threat of punishment if

the situation continues. A second solution is reassignment of the employee to less critical 
activities. This solution is usually not preferred by project managers. The third and most 
frequent solution is the removal of the employee.
Although project managers can get project office people (who report to the project 
manager) removed directly, the removal of a line employee is an indirect process and must 
be accomplished through the line manager. The removal of the line employee should be 
made to look like a transfer; otherwise, the project manager will be branded as an individual 
who fires people.
4.8 THE PROJECT OFFICE
The project team is a combination of the project office and functional 
employees, as shown in Figure 4–4. Although the figure identifies the 
project office personnel as assistant project managers, some employ-
ees may not have any such title. The advantage of such a title is that it 
entitles the employee to speak directly to the customer. The title is important because when 
the assistant project manager speaks to the customer, he represents the company, whereas 
the functional employee represents himself.
The project office is an organization developed to support the project manager in car-
rying out his duties. Project office personnel must have the same dedication toward the 
project as the project manager and must have good working relationships with both the 
project and functional managers. The responsibilities of the project office include:
●
●
Acting as the focal point of information for both in-house control and customer 
reporting
●
●
Controlling time, cost, and performance to adhere to contractual requirements

●
●
Ensuring that all work required is documented and distributed to all key personnel
●
●
Ensuring that all work performed is both authorized and funded by contractual 
documentation
The major responsibility of the project manager and the project office personnel is 
the integration of work across the functional lines of the organization. Functional units, 
such as engineering, R&D, and manufacturing, together with extra-company subcontrac-
tors, must work toward the same specifications, designs, and even objectives. The lack of 
proper integration of these functional units is the most common cause of project failure. 
The team members must be dedicated to all activities required for project success, not just 
their own functional responsibilities. The problems resulting from lack of integration can 
best be solved by full-time membership and participation of project office personnel. Not 
all team members are part of the project office. Functional representatives, performing at 
the interface position, also act as integrators but at a closer position to where the work is 
finally accomplished (i.e., the line organization).
One of the biggest challenges facing project managers is determining the size of the 
project office. The optimal size is determined by a trade-off between the maximum number 
of members necessary to assure compliance with requirements and the maximum num-
ber for keeping the total administrative costs under control. Membership is determined 
by factors such as project size, internal support requirements, type of project (e.g., R&D, 
qualification, production), level of technical competency required, and customer support 
requirements. Membership size is also influenced by how strategic management views 
the project to be. There is a tendency to enlarge project offices if the project is considered 
strategic, especially if follow-on work is possible.
On large projects, and even on some smaller efforts, it is often impossible to achieve 
project success without permanently assigned personnel. The four major activities of the 
project office, shown below, indicate the need for using full-time people:
●
●
Integration of activities
●
●
In-house and out-of-house communication
●
●
Scheduling with risk and uncertainty
●
●
Effective control
These four activities require continuous monitoring by trained project personnel. The 
training of good project office members may take weeks or even months, and can extend 
beyond the time allocated for a project.
Many executives have a misconception concerning the makeup and usefulness of 
the project office. People who work in the project office should be individuals whose 
first concern is project management, not the enhancement of their technical expertise. 
It is almost impossible for individuals to perform for any extended period of time in 
the project office without becoming cross-trained in a second or third project office 
function. For example, the project manager for cost could acquire enough expertise 
eventually to act as the assistant to the assistant project manager for procurement. This 
technique of project office cross-training is an excellent mechanism for creating good 
project managers.

The Project Organizational Chart
133
4.9 THE FUNCTIONAL TEAM
The project team consists of the project manager, the project office 
(whose members may or may not report directly to the project man-
ager), and the functional or interface members (who must report hori-
zontally as well as vertically for information flow). Functional team 
members are often shown on organizational charts as project office 
team members. This is normally done to satisfy customer requirements.
Upper-level management can have an input into the selection process for functional 
team members but should not take an active role unless the project and functional managers 
cannot agree. Functional management must be represented at all staffing meetings because 
functional staffing is directly dependent on project requirements and because:
●
●
Functional managers generally have more expertise and can identify high-risk areas.
●
●
Functional managers must develop a positive attitude toward project success. This is 
best achieved by inviting their participation in the early activities of the planning phase.
●
●
Functional team members are not always full-time. They can be full-time or part-
time for either the duration of the project or only specific phases.
The selection process for both the functional team member and the project office must 
include evaluation of any special requirements. The most common special requirements 
develop from:
●
●
Changes in technical specifications
●
●
Special customer requests
●
●
Organizational restructuring because of deviations from existing policies
●
●
Compatibility with the customer’s project office
A typical project office may include between ten and thirty members, whereas the 
total project team may be in excess of a hundred people, causing information to be shared 
slowly. For large projects, it is desirable to have a full-time functional representative from 
each major division or department assigned permanently to the project, and perhaps even 
to the project office. Both the project manager and team members must understand fully 
the responsibilities and functions of each team member so that total integration can be 
achieved rapidly and effectively.
When employees are attached to a project, the project manager must identify the “star” 
employees. These are the employees who are vital for the success of the project and who 
can either make or break the project manager. Most of the time, star employees are found 
in the line organization, not the project office.
4.10 THE PROJECT ORGANIZATIONAL CHART
One of the first requirements of the project start-up phase is to develop the organizational 
chart for the project and determine its relationship to the parent organizational structure. 
Figure 4–5 shows, in abbreviated form, the six major programs at Dalton Corporation. It is

more common to see organization charts like Figure 4–5 represent programs, but they can 
be used for projects as well. Our concern is with the Midas Program. Although the Midas 
Program may have the lowest priority of the six programs, it is placed at the top, and in 
boldface, to give the impression that it is the top priority. This type of representation usu-
ally makes the client or customer feel that his program is important to the contractor.
The employees shown in Figure 4–5 may be part-time or full-time, depending upon the 
project’s requirements. Perturbations on Figure 4–5 might include one employee’s name 
identified on two or more vertical positions (e.g., the project engineer on two projects) or the 
same name in two horizontal boxes (e.g., for a small project, the same person could be the 
project manager and project engineer). Remember, this type of chart is for the customer’s 
benefit and may not show the true “dotted/solid” reporting relationships in the company.
The next step is to show the program office structure, as illustrated in Figure 4–6. Note 
that the chief of operations and the chief engineer have dual reporting responsibility; they

report directly to the program manager and indirectly to the directors. Again, this may be 
just for the customer’s benefit, with the real reporting structure being reversed. Beneath 
the chief engineer, there are three positions. Although these positions appear as solid lines, 
they might actually be dotted lines. For example, Ed White might be working only part-
time on the Midas Program but is still shown on the chart as a permanent program office 
member. Jean Flood, under contracts, might be spending only ten hours per week on the 
Midas Program.
If the function of two positions on the organizational chart takes place at different 
times, then both positions may be shown as manned by the same person. For example, Ed 
White may have his name under both engineering design and engineering testing if the two 
activities are far enough apart that he can perform them independently.
The people shown in the project office organizational chart, whether full-time or part-
time, may not be physically sitting in the project office. For full-time, long-term assign-
ments, as in construction projects, the employees may be physically sitting side by side, 
whereas for part-time assignments, it may be imperative for them to sit in their functional 
group. Remember, these types of charts may simply be eyewash for the customer.
Most customers realize that the top-quality personnel may be shared with other pro-
grams and projects. Project manning charts, such as the one shown in Figure 4–7, can be 
used for this purpose. These manning charts are also helpful in preparing the management 
volume of proposals to show the customer that key personnel will be readily available on 
his project.

4.11 SELECTING THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT IMPLEMENTATION TEAM
The implementation of project management within an organiza-
tion requires strong executive support and an implementation team 
that is dedicated to making project management work. Selecting the 
wrong team players can either lengthen the implementation process 
or reduce employee morale. Some employees may play destructive 
roles on a project team. These roles, which undermine project management implementa-
tion, are shown in Figure 4–8 and described below:
●

The aggressor
●
●
Criticizes everybody and everything on project management

4.12 MISTAKES MADE BY INEXPERIENCED PROJECT MANAGERS
We are all prone to making mistakes as a project manager or team member. Project man-
agers are not infallible. The list below shows twenty of the most common mistakes that 
young or inexperienced project managers make. Obviously, there are more than twenty 
mistakes, and many of these may be unique to specific industries. However, the list is a 
good starting point for understanding why many project managers get into trouble because 
of their own doing.3
●
●
Believing that excessive detail is needed to be an effective leader
●
●
Pretending to know more than you actually do, thus alienating the true subject 
matter experts
●
●
Trying to impress people by preparing an ambitious schedule that line managers 
may find difficulty in supporting
●
●
Having an overreliance on repeatable processes that lack flexibility
●
●
Ignoring problems in the belief that they will go away
●
●
Failing to share accountability for success and failure with functional managers
●
●
Gold-plating the deliverables by adding in unnecessary functionality
●
●
Failing to understand what stakeholders and sponsors want to hear
●
●
Not fully understanding requirements
●
●
Refusing to ask for help
●
●
Ignoring problems that are the responsibility of the project manager to resolve
●
●
Believing in saviors and miracles rather than effective leadership
●
●
Trying to motivate by making promises that cannot be kept
●
●
Failing to see dependencies between your project and other company projects
●
●
Refusing to tell the client that they are wrong
●
●
Continuously reminding everyone who’s the boss
●
●
Failing to understand the effects on the project resulting from internal and external 
politics

His [project manager’s] staff should be qualified to provide personal administrative and

he will have to do with whomever will be available later. What should Paul do? Do you have to 
make any assumptions in order to defend your answer?

5.0 INTRODUCTION
The project manager measures his success by how well he can 
negotiate with both upper-level and functional management for the 
resources necessary to achieve the project objective. Moreover, the 
project manager may have a great deal of delegated authority but very 
little power. Hence, the managerial skills he requires for successful 
performance may be drastically different from those of his functional 
management counterparts.
The difficult aspect of the project management environment is that individuals at the project–functional 
interface must report to two bosses. Functional managers and project managers, by virtue of their different 
authority levels and responsibilities, treat their people in different fashions depending on their “manage-
ment school” philosophies. This imposes hardships on both the project managers and functional repre-
sentatives. The project manager must motivate functional representatives toward project dedication on the 
horizontal line, often with little regard for the employee. After all, the employee might be assigned for 
a very short-term effort, whereas the end-item is the most important objective. The functional manager, 
however, expresses more concern for the individual needs of the employee.
Modern practitioners still tend to identify management responsibilities and skills in terms of the prin-
ciples and functions developed in the early management schools, namely:

Management Functions 
Although these management functions have generally been applied to traditional management struc-
tures, they have recently been redefined for temporary management positions. Their fundamental meanings 
remain the same, but the applications are different.
5.1 CONTROLLING
Controlling is a three-step process of measuring progress toward an objective, evaluating 
what remains to be done, and taking the necessary corrective action to achieve or exceed 
the objectives. These three steps—measuring, evaluating, and correcting—are defined as 
follows:
1.	 Measuring: determining through formal and informal reports the degree to which pro-
gress toward objectives is being made
2.	 Evaluating: determining cause of and possible ways to act on significant deviations 
from planned performance
3.	 Correcting: taking control action to correct an unfavorable trend or to take advantage of 
an unusually favorable trend
The project manager is responsible for ensuring the accomplishment of group and 
organizational goals and objectives. To effect this, he or she must have a thorough know­
ledge of standards and cost-control policies and procedures so that a comparison is possible 
between operating results and preestablished standards. The project manager must then 
take the necessary corrective actions. Later chapters provide a more in-depth analysis of 
control, especially the cost control function.
In Chapter 1, we stated that project managers must understand organizational behavior 
in order to be effective and must have strong interpersonal skills. This is especially impor-
tant during the controlling function. Line managers may have the luxury of time to build 
up relationships with each of their workers. But for a project manager time is a constraint, 
and it is not always easy to predict how well or how poorly an individual will interact with 
a group, especially if the project manager has never worked with this employee previously. 
Understanding the physiological and social behavior of how people perform in a group 
cannot happen overnight.
5.2 DIRECTING
Directing is the implementing and carrying out (through others) of those approved plans 
that are necessary to achieve or exceed objectives. Directing involves such steps as:
●
●
Staffing: seeing that a qualified person is selected for each position
●
●
Training: teaching individuals and groups how to fulfill their duties and respon-
sibilities

Directing
147
●
●
Supervising: giving others day-to-day instruction, guidance, and discipline as 
required so that they can fulfill their duties and responsibilities
●
●
Delegating: assigning work, responsibility, and authority so others can make max-
imum utilization of their abilities
●
●
Motivating: encouraging others to perform by fulfilling or appealing to their needs
●
●
Counseling: holding private discussions with another about how he might do bet-
ter work, solve a personal problem, or realize his ambitions
●
●
Coordinating: seeing that activities are carried out in relation to their importance 
and with a minimum of conflict
Directing subordinates is not an easy task because of both the short time duration of 
the project and the fact that employees might still be assigned to a functional manager 
while temporarily assigned to your effort. The luxury of getting to “know” one’s subordi-
nates may not be possible in a project environment.
Project managers must be decisive and move forward rapidly whenever directives are 
necessary. It is better to decide an issue and be 10 percent wrong than it is to wait for the last 
10 percent of a problem’s input and cause a schedule delay and improper use of resources. 
Directives are most effective when the KISS (keep it simple, stupid) rule is applied. Direc-
tives should be written with one simple and clear objective so that subordinates can work 
effectively and get things done right the first time. Orders must be issued in a manner that 
expects immediate compliance. Whether people will obey an order depends mainly on the 
amount of respect they have for you. Therefore, never issue an order that you cannot enforce. 
Oral orders and directives should be disguised as suggestions or requests. The requestor 
should ask the receiver to repeat the oral orders so that there is no misunderstanding.
Motivating employees so that they feel secure on the job is not easy, especially since 
a project has a finite lifetime. Specific methods for producing security in a project environ-
ment include:
●
●
Letting people know why they are where they are
●
●
Making individuals feel that they belong where they are
●
●
Placing individuals in positions for which they are properly trained
●
●
Letting employees know how their efforts fit into the big picture
Since project managers cannot motivate by promising material gains, they must appeal 
to each person’s pride. The guidelines for proper motivation are:
●
●
Adopt a positive attitude
●
●
Do not criticize management
●
●
Do not make promises that cannot be kept
●
●
Circulate customer reports
●
●
Give each person the attention he or she requires
There are several ways of motivating project personnel. Some effective ways include:
●
●
Giving assignments that provide challenges
●
●
Clearly defining performance expectations

5.3 PROJECT AUTHORITY
Project management structures create a web of relationships that can 
cause chaos in the delegation of authority and the internal authority 
structure. Four questions must be considered in describing project 
authority:
●
●
What is project authority?
●
●
What is power, and how is it achieved?
●
●
How much project authority should be granted to the project manager?
●
●
Who settles project authority interface problems?
One form of the project manager’s authority can be defined as the legal or rightful 
power to command, act, or direct the activities of others. Authority can be delegated from 
one’s superiors. Power, on the other hand, is granted to an individual by his subordinates and 
is a measure of their respect for him. A manager’s authority is a combination of his power 
and influence such that subordinates, peers, and associates willingly accept his judgment.
In the traditional structure, the power spectrum is realized through the hierarchy, whereas in 
the project structure, power comes from credibility, expertise, or being a sound decision maker.
Authority is the key to the project management process. The project manager must 
manage across functional and organizational lines by bringing together activities required 
to accomplish the objectives of a specific project. Project authority provides the way of 
thinking required to unify all organizational activities toward accomplishment of the pro-
ject regardless of where they are located. The project manager who fails to build and main-
tain his alliances will soon find opposition or indifference to his project requirements.
The amount of authority granted to the project manager varies according to project 
size, management philosophy, and management interpretation of potential conflicts with 
functional managers.
Generally speaking, a project manager should have more authority than his responsi-
bility calls for, the exact amount of authority usually depending on the amount of risk that 
the project manager must take. The greater the risk, the greater the amount of authority. 
A good project manager knows where his authority ends and does not hold an employee 
responsible for duties that he (the project manager) does not have the authority to enforce. 
Some projects are directed by project managers who have only monitoring authority. These 
project managers are referred to as influence project managers.
Failure to establish authority relationships can result in:

Poor communication channels

Antagonism, especially from the informal organization
●
●
Poor working relationships with superiors, subordinates, peers, and associates
●
●
Surprises for the customer
The following are the most common sources of power and authority problems in a 
project environment:
●
●
Poorly documented or no formal authority
●
●
Power and authority perceived incorrectly
●
●
Dual accountability of personnel
●
●
Two bosses (who often disagree)
●
●
The project organization encouraging individualism
●
●
Subordinate relations stronger than peer or superior relationships
●
●
Shifting of personnel loyalties from vertical to horizontal lines
●
●
Group decision making based on the strongest group
●
●
Ability to influence or administer rewards and punishment
●
●
Sharing resources among several projects
The project manager does not have unilateral authority in the project effort. He fre-
quently negotiates with the functional manager. The project manager has the authority to 
determine the “when” and “what” of the project activities, whereas the functional man-
ager has the authority to determine “how the support will be given.” The project manager 
accomplishes his objectives by working with personnel who are largely professional. For 
professional personnel, project leadership must include explaining the rationale of the effort 
as well as the more obvious functions of planning, organizing, directing, and controlling.
Certain ground rules exist for authority control through negotiations:
●
●
Negotiations should take place at the lowest level of interaction.
●
●
Definition of the problem must be the first priority:
●
●
The issue
●
●
The impact
●
●
The alternative
●
●
The recommendations
●
●
Higher-level authority should be used if, and only if, agreement cannot be reached.
The critical stage of any project is planning. This includes more than just planning 
the activities to be accomplished; it also includes the planning and establishment of the 
authority relationships that must exist for the duration of the project. Because the project 
management environment is an ever-changing one, each project establishes its own policies 
and procedures, a situation that can ultimately result in a variety of authority relationships. 
It is therefore possible for functional personnel to have different responsibilities on differ-
ent projects, even if the tasks are the same.
During the planning phase the project team develops a responsibility assignment 
matrix (RAM) that contains such elements as:
●
●
General management responsibility
●
●
Operations management responsibility

The responsibility matrix is often referred to as a linear responsibility chart (LRC) or 
responsibility assignment matrix (RAM). Linear responsibility charts identify the participants, 
and to what degree an activity will be performed or a decision will be made. The LRC attempts 
to clarify the authority relationships that can exist when functional units share common work.
Figure 5–1 shows a typical linear responsibility chart. The rows, which indicate the 
activities, responsibilities, or functions required, can be all of the tasks in the work break-
down structure. The columns identify either positions, titles, or the people themselves. If the 
chart will be given to an outside customer, then only the titles should appear, or the customer 
will call the employees directly without going through the project manager. The symbols 
indicate the degrees of authority or responsibility existing between the rows and columns.

Project Authority
151
Several key factors affect the delegation of authority and responsibility, both from 
upper-level management to project management and from project management to func-
tional management. These key factors include:
●
●
The maturity of the project management function
●
●
The size, nature, and business base of the company
●
●
The size and nature of the project
●
●
The life cycle of the project
●
●
The capabilities of management at all levels
Once agreement has been reached as to the project manager’s authority and responsi-
bility, the results must be documented to clearly delineate his role in regard to:
●
●
His focal position
●
●
Conflict between the project manager and functional managers
●
●
Influence to cut across functional and organizational lines
●
●
Participation in major management and technical decisions
●
●
Collaboration in staffing the project
●
●
Control over allocation and expenditure of funds
●
●
Selection of subcontractors
●
●
Rights in resolving conflicts
●
●
Voice in maintaining integrity of the project team
●
●
Establishment of project plans
●
●
Providing a cost-effective information system for control
●
●
Providing leadership in preparing operational requirements
●
●
Maintaining prime customer liaison and contact
●
●
Promoting technological and managerial improvements
●
●
Establishment of project organization for the duration
●
●
Cutting red tape
Perhaps the best way to document the project manager’s authority is through the 
project charter, which is one of the three methods, shown in Figure 5–2, by which pro-
ject managers attain authority. Documenting the project manager’s authority is necessary 
because:
●
●
All interfacing must be kept as simple as possible.
●
●
The project manager must have the authority to “force” functional managers to 
depart from existing standards and possibly incur risk.
●
●
The project manager must gain authority over those elements of a program that 
are not under his control. This is normally achieved by earning the respect of the 
individuals concerned.
●
●
The project manager should not attempt to fully describe the exact authority and 
responsibilities of his project office personnel or team members. Instead, he should 
encourage problem solving rather than role definition.

5.4 INTERPERSONAL INFLUENCES
There exist a variety of relationships (although they are not always 
clearly definable) between power and authority. These relationships 
are usually measured by “relative” decision power as a function of 
the authority structure and are strongly dependent on the project 
organizational form.
Project managers are generally known for having a lot of delegated authority but very 
little formal power. They must, therefore, get jobs done through the use of interpersonal 
influences. There are five such interpersonal influences:
●
●
Legitimate power: the ability to gain support because project personnel perceive 
the project manager as being officially empowered to issue orders
●
●
Reward power: the ability to gain support because project personnel perceive the 
project manager as capable of directly or indirectly dispensing valued organiza-
tional rewards (i.e., salary, promotion, bonus, future work assignments)
●
●
Penalty power: the ability to gain support because the project personnel perceive 
the project manager as capable of directly or indirectly dispensing penalties that 
they wish to avoid; usually derives from the same source as reward power, with 
one being a necessary condition for the other
●
●
Expert power: the ability to gain support because personnel perceive the project 
manager as possessing special knowledge or expertise (that functional personnel 
consider as important)
●
●
Referent power: the ability to gain support because project personnel feel person-
ally attracted to the project manager or his project
Expert and referent power are examples of personal power that comes from the per-
sonal qualities or characteristics to which team members are attracted. Legitimate, reward, 
and penalty power are often referred to as examples of position power, which is directly 
related to one’s position within the organization. Line managers generally possess a great

amount of position power. But in a project environment, position power may be difficult to 
achieve. According to Magenau and Pinto1:
Within the arena of project management, the whole issue of position power becomes more 
problematic. Project managers in many organizations operate outside the standard functional 
hierarchy. While that position allows them a certain freedom of action without direct oversight, 
it has some important concomitant disadvantages, particularly as they pertain to positional 
power. First, because cross-functional relationships between the project man-ager and other 
functional departments can be ill-defined, project managers discover rather quickly that they 
have little or no legitimate power to simply force their decisions through the organizational 
system. Functional departments usually do not have to recognize the rights of the project man-
agers to interfere with functional responsibilities; consequently, novice project managers hop-
ing to rely on positional power to implement their projects are quickly disabused.
As a second problem with the use of positional power, in many organizations, project 
managers have minimal authority to reward team members who, because they are temporary 
subordinates, maintain direct ties and loyalties to their functional departments. In fact, project 
managers may not even have the opportunity to complete a performance evaluation on these 
temporary team members. Likewise, for similar reasons, project managers may have minimal 
authority to punish inappropriate behavior. Therefore, they may discover that they have the abil-
ity to neither offer the carrot nor threaten the stick. As a result, in addition to positional power, 
it is often necessary that effective project managers seek to develop their personal power bases.
Like relative power, interpersonal influences can be identified with various project 
organizational forms as to their relative value. This is shown in Figure 5–3.

Management Functions 
For any temporary management structure to be effective, there must exist a rational 
balance of power between functional and project management. Unfortunately, a balance of 
equal power is often impossible to obtain because each project is inherently different from 
others, and the project managers possess different leadership abilities.
Regardless of how much authority and power a project manager develops over the 
course of the project, the ultimate factor in his ability to get the job done is usually his 
leadership style. Developing bonds of trust, friendship, and respect with the functional 
workers can promote success.
5.5 BARRIERS TO PROJECT TEAM DEVELOPMENT
Most people within project-driven and non–project-driven organizations 
have differing views of project management. These differing views can 
create severe barriers to successful project management operations.
The understanding of barriers to project team building can help in developing an envi-
ronment conducive to effective teamwork. The following barriers are typical for many 
project environments.
Differing outlooks, priorities, and interests. A major barrier exists when team mem-
bers have professional objectives and interests that are different from the project objectives. 
These problems are compounded when the team relies on support organizations that have 
different interests and priorities.
Role conflicts. Team development efforts are thwarted when role conflicts exist among 
the team members, such as ambiguity over who does what within the project team and in 
external support groups.
Project objectives/outcomes not clear. Unclear project objectives frequently lead to 
conflict, ambiguities, and power struggles. It becomes difficult, if not impossible, to define 
roles and responsibilities clearly.
Dynamic project environments. Many projects operate in a continual state of change. 
For example, senior management may keep changing the project scope, objectives, and 
resource base. In other situations, regulatory changes or client demands can drastically 
affect the internal operations of a project team.
Competition over team leadership. This barrier most likely occurs in the early phases 
of a project or if the project runs into severe problems. Obviously, such cases of leadership 
challenge can result in barriers to team building. Frequently, these challenges are covert 
challenges to the project leader’s ability.
Lack of team definition and structure. Many senior managers complain that teamwork 
is severely impaired because it lacks clearly defined task responsibilities and reporting 
structures. A common pattern is that a support department is charged with a task but no 
one leader is clearly delegated the responsibility. As a consequence, some personnel are 
working on the project but are not entirely clear on the extent of their responsibilities. In 
other cases, problems result when a project is supported by several departments without 
interdisciplinary coordination.
Team personnel selection. This barrier develops when personnel feel unfairly treated 
or threatened during the staffing of a project. In some cases, project personnel are assigned

Barriers to Project Team Development
155
to a team by functional managers, and the project manager has little or no input into the 
selection process. This can impede team development efforts, especially when the project 
leader is given available personnel versus the best, hand-picked team members. The assign-
ment of “available personnel” can result in several problems (e.g., low motivation levels, 
discontent, and uncommitted team members). The more power the project leader has over 
the selection of his team members, and the more negotiated agreement there is over the 
assigned task, the more likely it is that team-building efforts will be fruitful.
Credibility of project leader. Team-building efforts are hampered when the project 
leader suffers from poor credibility within the team or from other managers. In such cases, 
team members are often reluctant to make a commitment to the project or the leader. Cred-
ibility problems may come from poor managerial skills, poor technical judgments, or lack 
of experience relevant to the project.
Lack of team member commitment. Lack of commitment can have several sources. 
Team members having professional interests elsewhere, the feeling of insecurity that is 
associated with projects, the unclear nature of the rewards that may be forthcoming upon 
successful completion, and intense interpersonal conflicts within the team can all lead to 
lack of commitment.
Lack of team member commitment may result from suspicious attitudes existing 
between the project leader and a functional support manager, or between two team mem-
bers from two warring functional departments. Finally, low commitment levels are likely 
to occur when a “star” on a team “demands” too much effort from other team members or 
too much attention from the team leader. It’s a motivation killer.
Communication problems. Not surprisingly, poor communication is a major enemy to 
effective team development. Poor communication exists on four major levels: problems of 
communication among team members, between the project leader and the team members, 
between the project team and top management, and between the project leaders and the 
client. Often the problem is caused by team members simply not keeping others informed 
on key project developments. Yet the “whys” of poor communication patterns are far more 
difficult to determine. The problem can result from low motivation levels, poor morale, or 
carelessness. It was also discovered that poor communication patterns between the team 
and support groups result in severe team-building problems, as does poor communication 
with the client. Poor communication practices often lead to unclear objectives and poor 
project control, coordination, and work flow.
Lack of senior management support. If senior management support and commitment 
is unclear and subject to waxing and waning over the project life cycle, it can result in an 
uneasy feeling among team members and lead to low levels of enthusiasm and project com-
mitment. Two other common problems are that senior management often does not help set 
the right environment for the project team at the outset, nor do they give the team timely 
feedback on their performance and activities during the life of the project.
Project managers who are successfully performing their role not only recognize these bar-
riers but also know when in the project life cycle they are most likely to occur. Moreover, these 
managers take preventive actions and usually foster a work environment that is conducive to 
effective teamwork. The effective team builder is usually a social architect who understands 
the interaction of organizational and behavior variables and can foster a climate of active 
participation and minimal conflict. This requires carefully developed skills in leadership,

Management Functions 
administration, organization, and technical expertise on the project. However, besides the 
delicately balanced management skills, the project manager’s sensitivity to the basic issues 
underlying each barrier can help to increase success in developing an effective project team. 
Specific suggestions for managing team building barriers are advanced in Table 5–1.
Table 5–1.  BARRIERS TO EFFECTIVE TEAM BUILDING AND SUGGESTED HANDLING APPROACHES
Barrier
Suggestions for Effectively Managing Barriers (How to Minimize or Eliminate Barriers)
Differing outlooks, 
priorities, interests, 
and judgments of team 
members
Make effort early in the project life cycle to discover these conflicting differences. Fully explain the 
scope of the project and the rewards that may be forthcoming on successful project completion. 
Sell “team” concept and explain responsibilities. Try to blend individual interests with the overall 
project objectives.
Role conflicts
As early in a project as feasible, ask team members where they see themselves fitting into the project. 
Determine how the overall project can best be divided into subsystems and subtasks (e.g., the work 
breakdown structure). Assign/negotiate roles. Conduct regular status review meetings to keep team 
informed on progress and watch for unanticipated role conflicts over the project’s life.
Project objectives/
outcomes not clear
Assure that all parties understand the overall and interdisciplinary project objectives. Clear and 
frequent communication with senior management and the client becomes critically important. 
Status review meetings can be used for feedback. Finally, a proper team name can help to reinforce 
the project objectives.
Dynamic project 
environments
The major challenge is to stabilize external influences. First, key project personnel must work out an 
agreement on the principal project direction and “sell” this direction to the total team. Also educate 
senior management and the customer on the detrimental consequences of unwarranted change. It 
is critically important to forecast the “environment” within which the project will be developed. 
Develop contingency plans.
Competition over team 
leadership
Senior management must help establish the project manager’s leadership role. On the other hand, 
the project manager needs to fulfill the leadership expectations of team members. Clear role and 
responsibility definition often minimizes competition over leadership.
Lack of team definition 
and structure
Project leaders need to sell the team concept to senior management as well as to their team members. 
Regular meetings with the team will reinforce the team notion as will clearly defined tasks, roles, 
and responsibilities. Also, visibility in memos and other forms of written media as well as senior 
management and client participation can unify the team.
Project personnel selection
Attempt to negotiate the project assignments with potential team members. Clearly discuss with 
potential team members the importance of the project, their role in it, what rewards might result on 
completion, and the general “rules of the road” of project management. Finally, if team members 
remain uninterested in the project, then replacement should be considered.
Credibility of project 
leader
Credibility of the project leader among team members is crucial. It grows with the image of a sound 
decision maker in both general management and relevant technical expertise. Credibility can be 
enhanced by the project leader’s relationship to other key managers who support the team’s efforts.
Lack of team member 
commitment
Try to determine lack of team member commitment early in the life of the project and attempt to 
change possible negative views toward the project. Often, insecurity is a major reason for the lack 
of commitment; try to determine why insecurity exists, then work on reducing the team members’ 
fears. Conflicts with other team members may be another reason for lack of commitment. It is 
important for the project leader to intervene and mediate the conflict quickly. Finally, if a team 
member’s professional interests lie elsewhere, the project leader should examine ways to satisfy 
part of the team member’s interests or consider replacement.
Communication problems
The project leader should devote considerable time communicating with individual team members 
about their needs and concerns. In addition, the leader should provide a vehicle for timely sessions 
to encourage communications among the individual team contributors. Tools for enhancing 
communications are status meetings, reviews, schedules, reporting system, and colocation. 
Similarly, the project leader should establish regular and thorough communications with the client 
and senior management. Emphasis is placed on written and oral communications with key issues 
and agreements in writing.

Suggestions for Handling the Newly Formed Team
157
5.6 SUGGESTIONS FOR HANDLING THE NEWLY FORMED TEAM
A major problem faced by many project leaders is managing the anxiety that usually devel-
ops when a new team is formed. The anxiety experienced by team members is normal and 
predictable, but is a barrier to getting the team quickly focused on the task.
This anxiety may come from several sources. For example, if the team members have 
never worked with the project leader, they may be concerned about his leadership style. Some 
team members may be concerned about the nature of the project and whether it will match 
their professional interests and capabilities, or help or hinder their career aspirations. Further, 
team members can be highly anxious about life-style/work-style disruptions. As one project 
manager remarked, “Moving a team member’s desk from one side of the room to the other 
can sometimes be just about as traumatic as moving someone from Chicago to Manila.”
Another common concern among newly formed teams is whether there will be an 
equitable distribution of the workload among team members and whether each member is 
capable of pulling his own weight. In some newly formed teams, members not only must 
do their own work, but also must train other team members. Within reason this is bearable, 
but when it becomes excessive, anxiety increases.
Certain steps taken early in the life of a team can minimize these problems. First, the 
project leader must talk with each team member one-to-one about the following:
  1.	 What the objectives are for the project.
  2.	 Who will be involved and why.
  3.	 The importance of the project to the overall organization or work unit.
  4.	 Why the team member was selected and assigned to the project and what role that 
person will perform.
  5.	 What rewards might be forthcoming if the project is successfully completed.
  6.	 What problems and constraints are likely to be encountered.
  7.	 The rules of the road that will be followed in managing the project (e.g., regular status 
review meetings).
  8.	 What suggestions the team member has for achieving success.
  9.	 What the professional interests of the team member are.
10.	 What challenge the project will present to individual members and the entire team.
11.	 Why the team concept is so important to project management success and how it 
should work.
Lack of senior 
management support
Senior management support is an absolute necessity for dealing effectively with interface groups 
and proper resource commitment. Therefore, a major goal for project leaders is to maintain the 
continued interest and commitment of senior management in their projects. We suggest that 
senior management become an integral part of project reviews. Equally important, it is critical 
for senior management to provide the proper environment for the project to function effectively. 
Here the project leader needs to tell management at the onset of the program what resources are 
needed. The project manager’s relationship with senior management and ability to develop senior 
management support is critically affected by his own credibility and the visibility and priority of 
his project.

158
Management Functions 
Dealing with these anxieties and helping team members feel that they are an integral 
part of the team can yield rich dividends. First, team members are more likely to openly 
share their ideas and approaches. Second, it is more likely that the team will be able to 
develop effective decision-making processes. Third, the team is likely to develop more 
effective project control procedures, including those traditionally used to monitor project 
performance (PERT/CPM, networking, work breakdown structures, etc.) and those in 
which team members give feedback to each other regarding performance.
5.7 TEAM BUILDING AS AN ONGOING PROCESS
While proper attention to team building is critical during early phases of a project, it is a 
never-ending process. The project manager is continually monitoring team functioning and 
performance to see what corrective action may be needed to prevent or correct various team 
problems. Several barometers (summarized in Table 5–2) provide good clues of potential 
team dysfunction. First, noticeable changes in performance levels for the team and/or for 
individual team members should always be investigated. Such changes can be symptomatic 
of more serious problems (e.g., conflict, lack of work integration, communication prob-
lems, and unclear objectives). Second, the project leader and team members must be aware 
of the changing energy levels of team members. These changes, too, may signal more seri-
ous problems or that the team is tired and stressed. Sometimes changing the work pace or 
taking time off can reenergize team members. Third, verbal and nonverbal clues from team 
members may be a source of information on team functioning. It is important to hear the 
needs and concerns of team members (verbal clues) and to observe how they act in carry-
ing out their responsibilities (nonverbal clues). Finally, detrimental behavior of one team 
member toward another can be a signal that a problem within the team warrants attention.

Leadership In A Project Environment
159
Project leaders should hold regular meetings to evaluate overall team performance and 
deal with team functioning problems. The focus of these meetings can be directed toward 
“what we are doing well as a team” and “what areas need our team’s attention.” This 
approach often brings positive surprises in that the total team is informed of progress in 
diverse project areas (e.g., a breakthrough in technology development, a subsystem sched-
ule met ahead of the original target, or a positive change in the client’s behavior toward the 
project). After the positive issues have been discussed the review session should focus on 
actual or potential problem areas. The meeting leader should ask each team member for 
his observations and then open the discussion to ascertain how significant the problems 
really are. Assumptions should, of course, be separated from the facts of each situation. 
Next, assignments should be agreed on for best handling these problems. Finally, a plan for 
problem follow-up should be developed. The process should result in better overall perfor-
mance and promote a feeling of team participation and high morale.
5.8 LEADERSHIP IN A PROJECT ENVIRONMENT
Leadership can be defined as a style of behavior designed to integrate 
both the organizational requirements and one’s personal interests into 
the pursuit of some objective. All managers have some sort of leader-
ship responsibility. If time permits, successful leadership techniques and practices can be 
developed.
Leadership is composed of several complex elements, the three most common being:
●
●
The person leading
●
●
The people being led
●
●
The situation (i.e., the project environment)
Project managers are often selected or not selected because of their leadership styles. 
The most common reason for not selecting an individual is his inability to balance the tech-
nical and managerial project functions.
There have been several surveys to determine what leadership techniques are best. The 
following are the results of a survey by Richard Hodgetts.2 The results of the survey are still 
applicable for many project management environments.
●
●
Human relations–oriented leadership techniques
●
●
“The project manager must make all the team members feel that their efforts 
are important and have a direct effect on the outcome of the program.”
●
●
“The project manager must educate the team concerning what is to be done 
and how important its role is.”
●
●
“Provide credit to project participants.”

●
“Project members must be given recognition and prestige of appointment.”
●
●
“Make the team members feel and believe that they play a vital part in the 
success (or failure) of the team.”
●
●
“By working extremely closely with my team I believe that one can win a 
project loyalty while to a large extent minimizing the frequency of authority-
gap problems.”
●
●
“I believe that a great motivation can be created just by knowing the people 
in a personal sense. I know many of the line people better than their own 
supervisor does. In addition, I try to make them understand that they are an 
indispensable part of the team.”
●
●
“I would consider the most important technique in overcoming the authority 
gap to be understanding as much as possible the needs of the individuals with 
whom you are dealing and over whom you have no direct authority.”
●
●
Formal authority–oriented leadership techniques
●
●
“Point out how great the loss will be if cooperation is not forthcoming.”
●
●
“Put all authority in functional statements.”
●
●
“Apply pressure beginning with a tactful approach and minimum application 
warranted by the situation and then increasing it.”
●
●
“Threaten to precipitate high-level intervention and do it if necessary.”
●
●
“Convince the members that what is good for the company is good for them.”
●
●
“Place authority on full-time assigned people in the operating division to get 
the necessity work done.”
●
●
“Maintain control over expenditures.”
●
●
“Utilize implicit threat of going to general management for resolution.”
●
●
“It is most important that the team members recognize that the project man-
ager has the charter to direct the project.”
5.9 VALUE-BASED PROJECT LEADERSHIP
The importance of value has had a significant impact on the lead-
ership style of today’s project managers. Historically, project man-
agement leadership was perceived as the inevitable conflict between 
individual values and organizational values. Today, companies are looking for ways to get 
employees to align their personal values with the organization’s values. In doing so, com-
panies have created cultures that support project management and many of the cultures are 
driven by a change in perceived values.
Table 5–3, adapted from Hultman and Gellerman, shows how our concept of value 
has changed over the years.3 If you look closely at the items in Table 5–3, you can see 
that the changing values affect more than just individual versus organization values. 
Instead, it is more likely to be a conflict of four groups, namely the project manager,

Management Functions 
There are several reasons why the role of the project manager and the accompanying 
leadership style has changed. Some reasons are:
●
●
We are now managing our business as though it is a series of projects.
●
●
Project management is now viewed as a full-time profession.
●
●
Project managers are now viewed as both business managers and project managers 
and are expected to make decisions in both areas.
●
●
The value of a project is measured more so in business terms rather than solely 
technical terms.
●
●
Project management is now being applied to parts of the business that traditionally 
haven’t used project management.
The nontraditional types of projects have made it clear why traditional project man-
agement must change. Here are areas that necessitate changes:
●
●
New projects have become:
●
●
Highly complex and with greater acceptance of risks that may not be fully 
understood during project approval
●
●
More uncertain in the outcomes of the projects and with no guarantee of value 
at the end
●
●
Pressed for speed-to-market irrespective of the risks
●
●
The statement of work (SOW) is:
●
●
Not always well defined, especially on long-term projects
●
●
Based upon possibly flawed, irrational, or unrealistic assumptions
●
●
Inconsiderate of unknown and rapidly changing economic and environmental 
conditions
●
●
Based upon a stationary rather than moving target for final value
●
●
The management cost and control systems [enterprise project management meth-
odologies (EPM)] focus on:
●
●
An ideal situation (as in the PMBOK ® Guide)
●
●
Theories rather than the understanding of the workflow
●
●
Inflexible processes
●
●
Periodically reporting time at completion and cost at completion but not value 
(or benefits) at completion
●
●
Project continuation rather than canceling projects with limited or no value
Over the years, small steps have been taken to plan for the use of project management 
on nontraditional projects. This included:
●
●
Project managers are provided with more business knowledge and are allowed to 
provide an input during the project selection process.
●
●
Because of the above item, project managers are brought on board the project at 
the beginning of the initiation phase rather than the end of the initiation phase.
●
●
Projects managers now seem to have more of an understanding of technology 
rather than a command of technology.

5.10 TRANSFORMATIONAL PROJECT  
MANAGEMENT LEADERSHIP
There have been numerous books written on effective project man-
agement leadership. Most books seem to favor situational leadership 
where the leadership style that the project manager selects is based 
upon the size and nature of the project, the importance of the deliverables, the skill level of 
the project team members, the project manager’s previous experience working with these 
team members, and the risks associated with the project. Historically, project managers 
perceived themselves as being paid to produce deliverables rather than managing people. 
Team leadership was important to some degree as long as what was expected in the way 
of employee performance and behavior was consistent with the desires of the employee’s 
functional manager that conducted the employee’s performance review. In the past, project 
managers were expected to provide leadership in a manner that improves the employee’s 
performance and skills, and allows the employee to grow while working on project teams. 
Today, project managers are being asked to function as managers of organizational change 
on selected projects. Organizational change requires that people change. This mandates 
that project managers possess a set of skills that may be different than what was appropriate 
for managing projects. This approach is now being called transformational project manage-
ment leadership.
There are specific situations where transformational leadership must be used and 
employees must be removed from their previous comfort zones. As an example, not all pro-
jects come to an end once the deliverables are created. Consider a multinational company 
that establishes an IT project to create a new, high-security company-wide email system. 
Once the software is developed, the project is ready to “go live.” Historically, the person 
acting as the project manager to develop the software moves on to another project at “go 
live,” and the responsibility for implementation goes to the functional managers or some-
one else. Today, companies are asking the project manager to remain on board the project 
and act as the change agent for full, corporate-wide implementation of the change-over 
to the new system. In these situations, the project manager must adopt a transformational 
leadership style.
Transformational project management is heavily focused upon the people side of the 
change and is a method for managing the resistance to the change, whether the change is 
in processes, technology, acquisitions, targets, or organizational restructuring. People need 
to understand the change and buy into it. Imposing change upon people is an invitation for 
prolonged resistance especially if people see their job threatened. Transformational pro-
jects can remove people from their comfort zones.
5.11 ORGANIZATIONAL IMPACT
In most companies, whether or not project-oriented, the impact of management emphasis 
on the organization is well known. In the project environment there also exists a definite 
impact due to leadership emphasis. The leadership emphasis is best seen by employee

Management Functions 
contributions, organizational order, employee performance, and the project manager’s 
­performance:
●
●
Contributions from People
●
●
A good project manager encourages active cooperation and responsible par-
ticipation. The result is that both good and bad information is contributed 
freely.
●
●
A poor project manager maintains an atmosphere of passive resistance with 
only responsive participation. This results in information being withheld.
●
●
Organizational Order
●
●
A good project manager develops policy and encourages acceptance. A low 
price is paid for contributions.
●
●
A poor project manager goes beyond policies and attempts to develop proce-
dures and measurements. A high price is normally paid for contributions.
●
●
Employee Performance
●
●
A good project manager keeps people informed and satisfied (if possible) 
by aligning motives with objectives. Positive thinking and cooperation are 
encouraged. A good project manager is willing to give more responsibility to 
those willing to accept it.
●
●
A poor project manager keeps people uninformed, frustrated, defensive, and 
negative. Motives are aligned with incentives rather than objectives. The poor 
project manager develops a “stay out of trouble” atmosphere.
●
●
Performance of the Project Manager
●
●
A good project manager assumes that employee misunderstandings can and 
will occur, and therefore blames himself. A good project manager constantly 
attempts to improve and be more communicative. He relies heavily on moral 
persuasion.
●
●
A poor project manager assumes that employees are unwilling to cooperate 
and therefore blames subordinates. The poor project manager demands more 
through authoritarian attitudes and relies heavily on material incentives.
Management emphasis also impacts the organization. The following four categories 
show this management emphasis resulting for both good and poor project management:
●
●
Management Problem Solving
●
●
A good project manager performs his own problem solving at the level for 
which he is responsible through delegation of problem-solving responsibilities.
●
●
A poor project manager will do subordinate problem solving in known areas. 
For areas that he does not know, he requires that his approval be given prior to 
idea implementation.
●
●
Organizational Order
●
●
A good project manager develops, maintains, and uses a single integrated 
management system in which authority and responsibility are delegated to 
the subordinates. In addition, he knows that occasional slippages and overruns 
will occur, and simply tries to minimize their effect.

Employee–Manager Problems
165
●
●
A poor project manager delegates as little authority and responsibility as possi-
ble, and runs the risk of continual slippages and overruns. A poor project man-
ager maintains two management information systems: one informal system for 
himself and one formal (eyewash) system simply to impress his superiors.
●
●
Performance of People
●
●
A good project manager finds that subordinates willingly accept responsibility, 
are decisive in their attitude toward the project, and are satisfied.
●
●
A poor project manager finds that his or her subordinates are reluctant to 
accept responsibility, are indecisive in their actions, and seem frustrated.
●
●
Performance of the Project Manager
●
●
A good project manager assumes that his key people can “run the show.” He 
exhibits confidence in those individuals working in areas in which he has no 
expertise, and exhibits patience with people working in areas where he has a 
familiarity. A good project manager is never too busy to help his people solve 
personal or professional problems.
●
●
A poor project manager considers himself indispensable, is overcautious with 
work performed in unfamiliar areas, and becomes overly interested in work he 
knows. A poor project manager is always tied up in meetings.
5.12 EMPLOYEE–MANAGER PROBLEMS
The two major problem areas in the project environment are the 
“who has what authority and responsibility” question, and the result-
ing conflicts associated with the individual at the project–functional 
interface. Almost all project problems in some way or another involve these two major 
areas. Other problem areas found in the project environment include:
●
●
The pyramidal structure
●
●
Superior–subordinate relationships
●
●
Departmentalization
●
●
Scalar chain of command
●
●
Organizational chain of command
●
●
Power and authority
●
●
Planning goals and objectives
●
●
Decision making
●
●
Reward and punishment
●
●
Span of control
The two most common employee problems involve the assignment and resulting eval-
uation processes.
On the manager level, the two most common problems involve personal values and 
conflicts. Personal values are often attributed to the “changing of the guard.” New manag-
ers have a different sense of values from that of the older, more experienced managers.
PMBOK ® Guide, 6th Edition
3.4.4.1 Dealing with People

166
Management Functions 
Previously, we defined one of the attributes of a project manager as liking risks. Unfor-
tunately, the amount of risk that today’s managers are willing to accept varies not only 
with their personal values but also with the impact of current economic conditions and 
top management philosophies. If top management views a specific project as vital for the 
growth of the company, then the project manager may be directed to assume virtually no 
risks during the execution of the project. In this case the project manager may attempt to 
pass all responsibility to higher or lower management claiming that “his hands are tied.”
The amount of risk that managers will accept also varies with age and experience. Older, 
more experienced managers tend to take few risks, whereas the younger, more aggressive 
managers may adopt a risk-lover policy in hopes of achieving a name for themselves.
Conflicts exist at the project–functional interface regardless of how hard we attempt 
to structure the work.
Major conflicts can also arise during problem resolution sessions because the time con-
straints imposed on the project often prevent both parties from taking a logical approach. 
One of the major causes of prolonged problem solving is a lack of pertinent information. 
The following information should be reported by the project manager4:
●
●
The problem
●
●
The cause
●
●
The expected impact on schedule, budget, profit, or other pertinent area
●
●
The action taken or recommended and the results expected of that action
●
●
What top management can do to help
5.13 GENERAL MANAGEMENT PITFALLS
The project environment offers numerous opportunities for project managers and team 
members to get into trouble. Common types of management pitfalls are:
●
●
Lack of self-control (knowing oneself): Knowing oneself, especially one’s capa-
bilities, strengths, and weaknesses, is the first step toward successful project man-
agement. Too often, managers will assume that they are jacks-of-all-trades, will 
“bite off more than they can chew,” and then find that insufficient time exists for 
training additional personnel.
●
●
Activity traps: Activity traps result when the means become the end, rather than 
the means to achieve the end. The most common activity traps are team meetings, 
customer–technical interchange meetings, and the development of special sched-
ules and charts that cannot be used for customer reporting but are used to inform 
upper-level management of project status. Sign-off documents are another activity 
trap, and managers must evaluate whether all this paperwork is worth the effort.
●
●
Managing versus doing: There often exists a very fine line between managing 
and doing. As an example, consider a project manager who was asked by one of 
4.   Russell D. Archibald, Managing High-Technology Programs and Projects (New York: John Wiley & Sons, 
1976), p. 230.

Time Management Pitfalls

his technical people to make a telephone call to assist him in solving a problem. 
Simply making the phone call is doing work that should be done by the project 
team members or even the functional manager. However, if the person being called 
requires that someone in absolute authority be included in the conversation, then 
this can be considered managing instead of doing. There are several other cases 
where one must become a doer in order to be an effective manager and command 
the loyalty and respect of subordinates.
●
●
People versus task skills: Another major pitfall is the decision to utilize either 
people skills or task skills. Is it better to utilize subordinates with whom you can 
obtain a good working relationship or to employ highly skilled people simply to 
get the job done? Obviously, the project manager would like nothing better than to 
have the best of both worlds, but this is not always possible.
●
●
Ineffective communications.
●
●
Time management: It is often said that a good project manager must be willing to 
work sixty to eighty hours a week to get the job done. This might be true if he is 
continually fighting fires or if budgeting constraints prevent employing additional 
staff. The major reason, however, is the result of ineffective time management. 
Prime examples might include the continuous flow of paperwork, unnecessary 
meetings, unnecessary phone calls, and acting as a tour guide for visitors.
●
●
Management bottlenecks.
5.14 TIME MANAGEMENT PITFALLS
Managing projects within time, cost, and performance is easier said than done. The project 
management environment is extremely turbulent and is composed of numerous meetings, 
report writing, conflict resolution, continuous planning and replanning, communications 
with the customer, and crisis management. Ideally, the effective project manager is a man-
ager, not a doer, but in the “real world,” project managers often compromise their time by 
doing both, a fact that makes effective project management leadership difficult.
Disciplined time management is one of the keys to effective project management. It is 
often said that if the project manager cannot control his own time, then he will control noth-
ing else on the project. For most people, time is a resource that, when lost or misplaced, is 
gone forever. For a project manager, however, time is more of a constraint, and effective 
time management principles must be employed to make it a resource. Experienced person-
nel soon learn to delegate tasks and to employ effective time management principles. The 
following questions should help managers identify problem areas:
●
●
Do you have trouble completing work within the allocated deadlines?
●
●
How many interruptions are there each day?
Section 5.13 is adapted from David Cleland and Harold Kerzner, Engineering Team Management (Melbourne, 
Florida: Krieger, 1986), Chapter 8.

168
Management Functions
●
●
Do you have a procedure for handling interruptions?
●
●
If you need a large block of uninterrupted time, is it available? With or without 
overtime?
●
●
How do you handle drop-in visitors and phone calls?
●
●
How is incoming mail handled?
●
●
Do you have established procedures for routine work?
●
●
Are you accomplishing more or less than you were three months ago? Six months 
ago?
●
●
How difficult is it for you to say no?
●
●
How do you approach detail work?
●
●
Do you perform work that should be handled by your subordinates?
●
●
Do you have sufficient time each day for personal interests?
●
●
Do you still think about your job when away from the office?
●
●
Do you make a list of things to do? If yes, is the list prioritized?
●
●
Does your schedule have some degree of flexibility?
The project manager who can deal with these questions has a greater opportunity to 
convert time from a constraint to a resource.
The most challenging problem facing the project manager is his ina-
bility to say no. Consider the situation in which an employee comes 
into your office with a problem. The employee may be sincere when 
he says that he simply wants your advice but, more often than not, 
the employee wants to take the monkey off of his back and put it onto 
yours. The employee’s problem is now your problem.
To handle such situations, first screen out the problems with 
which you do not wish to get involved. Second, if the situation does necessitate your 
involvement, then you must make sure that when the employee leaves your office, he real-
izes that the problem is still his, not yours. Third, if you find that the problem will require 
your continued attention, remind the employee that all future decisions will be joint deci-
sions and that the problem will still be on the employee’s shoulders. Once employees real-
ize that they cannot put their problems on your shoulders, they learn how to make their 
own decisions.
There are numerous time robbers in the project management environment. These 
include:

●
●

●
●

●

●
●

To be effective, the project manager must establish time management rules and then 
ask himself four questions:
●
●
What am I doing that I don’t have to do at all?
●
●
What am I doing that can be done better by someone else?
●
●
What am I doing that could be done as well by someone else?
●
●
Am I establishing the right priorities for my activities?
STRESS AND BURNOUT
The factors that serve to make any occupation especially stressful are 
responsibility without the authority or ability to exert control, a neces-
sity for perfection, the pressure of deadlines, role ambiguity, role con-
flict, role overload, the crossing of organizational boundaries, responsibility for the actions 
of subordinates, and the necessity to keep up with the information explosions or techno-
logical breakthroughs. Project managers have all of these factors in their jobs.
A project manager has his resources controlled by line management, yet the respon-
sibilities of bringing a project to completion by a prescribed deadline are his. A project 
manager may be told to increase the work output, while the work force is simultaneously 
being cut. Project managers are expected to get work out on schedule, but are often not 
permitted to pay overtime.
Project managers are subject to stress due to several different facets of their jobs. This 
can manifest itself in a variety of ways, such as:
●
●
Being tired
●
●
Feeling depressed
●
●
Being physically and emotionally exhausted
●
●
Burned out
●
●
Being unhappy
●
●
Feeling trapped
●
●
Feeling worthless
●
●
Feeling resentful and disillusioned about people
●
●
Feeling hopeless
●
●
Feeling rejected
●
●
Feeling anxious
Stress is not always negative, however. Without certain amounts of stress, reports 
would never get written or distributed, deadlines would never be met, and no one 
would even get to work on time. In a project environment, with continually changing 
requirements, impossible deadlines, and each project being considered as a unique 
entity in itself, we must ask, “How much prolonged stress can a project manager han-
dle comfortably?”

Human Behavior Education
171
The stresses of project management may seem excessive for whatever rewards the 
position may offer. However, the project manager who is aware of the stresses inherent in 
the job and knows stress management techniques can face this challenge objectively and 
make it a rewarding experience.
5.15 MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES
Although project managers have the authority and responsibility to establish project poli-
cies and procedures, they must fall within the general guidelines established by top man-
agement. Table 5–4 identifies sample top-management guidelines. Guidelines can also be 
established for planning, scheduling, controlling, and communications.
5.16 HUMAN BEHAVIOR EDUCATION
If there is a weakness in some of the project management education programs, it lies in 
the area of human behavior education. The potential problem is that there is an abundance 
of courses on planning, scheduling, and cost control but not very many courses on behav-
ioral sciences that are directly applicable to a project management environment. All too 
often, lectures on human behavior focus upon application of the theories and principles 
based upon a superior (project manager) to subordinate (team member) relationship. This 
approach fails because:
●
●
Team members can be at a higher pay grade than the project manager.
●
●
The project manager most often has little overall authority.
●
●
The project manager most often has little formal reward power.
●
●
Team members may be working on multiple projects at the same time.
●
●
Team members may receive conflicting instructions from the project managers 
and their line manager.
●
●
Because of the project’s duration, the project manager may not have the time nec-
essary to adequately know the people on the team on a personal basis.
●
●
The project manager may not have any authority to have people assigned to the 
project team or removed.
Topics that managers and executives believe should be covered in more depth in the 
behavioral courses include:
●
●
Conflict management with all levels of personnel
●
●
Facilitation management
●
●
Counseling skills
●
●
Mentorship skills
●
●
Negotiation skills
●
●
Communication skills with all stakeholders
●
●
Presentation skills

Program Manager
Functional Manager
Relationship
The program manager is responsible for overall 
program direction, control, and coordination; 
and is the principal contact with the program 
management of the customer.
The functional organization managers are 
responsible for supporting the program 
manager in the performance of the contract(s) 
and in accordance with the terms of the 
contract(s) and are accountable to their 
cognizant managers for the total performance.
The program manager determines what will be done: 
he obtains, through the assigned program team 
members, the assistance and concurrence of the 
functional support organizations in determining the 
definitive requirements and objectives of the program.
To achieve the program objectives, the program 
manager utilizes the services of the functional 
organizations in accordance with the prescribed 
division policies and procedures affecting the 
functional organizations.
The functional organizations determine how the work 
will be done.
The program manager establishes program and 
technical policy as defined by management policy.
The functional support organizations perform 
all work within their functional areas for all 
programs within the cost, schedule, quality, 
and specifications established by contract 
for the program so as to assist the program 
manager in achieving the program objectives.
The program manager operates within prescribed 
division policies and procedures except where 
requirements of a particular program necessitate 
deviations or modifications as approved by 
the general manager. The functional support 
organizations provide strong, aggressive support to 
the program managers.
The program manager is responsible for the progress 
being made as well as the effectiveness of the 
total program.
Integrates research, development, production, 
procurement, quality assurance, product support, 
test, and financial and contractual aspects.
The functional support organization management 
seeks out or initiates innovations, methods, 
improvements, or other means that will enable 
that function to better schedule commitments, 
reduce cost, improve quality, or otherwise 
render exemplary performance as approved by 
the program manager.
Approves detailed performance specifications, 
pertinent physical characteristics, and functional 
design criteria to meet the program's development 
or operational requirements.
The program manager relies on the functional support 
program team members for carrying out specific 
program assignments.
Program managers and the functional support program 
team members are jointly responsible for ensuring 
that unresolved conflicts between requirements levied 
on functional organizations by different program 
managers are brought to the attention of management.

representative to the program team.
Functional organization managers do not request decisions 
of a program manager that are not within the program 
manager’s delineated authority and responsibility and 
that do not affect the requirements of the program.
Program decision authority rests with the program 
manager for all matters relating to his assigned 
program, consistent with division policy and the 
responsibilities assigned by the general manager.
Functional organizations do not make program 
decisions that are the responsibility of the program 
manager.
Joint participation in problem solution is essential 
to providing satisfactory decisions that fulfill 
overall program and company objectives, and is 
accomplished by the program manager and the 
assigned program team members. In arriving at 
program decisions, the program manager obtains the 
assistance and concurrence of cognizant functional 
support managers, through the cognizant program 
team member, since they are held accountable 
for their support of each program and for overall 
division functional performance.

The problem may emanate from the limited number of textbooks on human behavior 
applications directly applicable to the project management environment. One of the best 
books in the marketplace was written by Steven Flannes and Ginger Levin.5 The book 
stresses application of project management education by providing numerous examples 
from the authors’ project management experience.

PROBLEMS
5–1 	 A project manager finds that he does not have direct reward power over salaries, bonuses, 
work assignments, or project funding for members of the project team with whom he interfaces. 
Does this mean that he is totally deficient in reward power? Explain your answer.
5–2	 For each of the remarks made below, what types of interpersonal influences could exist?
a.	 “I’ve had good working relations with department X. They like me and I like them. I 
can usually push through anything ahead of schedule.”
b.	 A research scientist was temporarily promoted to project management for an advanced 
state-of-the-art effort. He was overheard making the following remark to a team mem-
ber: “I know it’s contrary to department policy, but the test must be conducted accord-
ing to these criteria or else the results will be meaningless.”
5–3	 Do you agree or disagree that scientists and engineers are likely to be more creative if 
they feel that they have sufficient freedom in their work? Can this condition backfire?
5–4	 Should the amount of risk and uncertainty in the project have a direct bearing on how 
much authority is granted to a project manager?
5–5	 Some projects are directed by project managers who have only monitoring authority. 
These individuals are referred to as influence project managers. What kind of projects would be 
under their control? What organizational structure might be best for this?
5–6	 What kind of working relationships would result if the project manager had more reward 
power than the functional managers?
5–7	 What is the correct way for a project manager to invite line managers to attend team 
meetings?
5–8	 How do you handle a project manager or project engineer who continually tries to “bite 
off more than he can chew”? If he were effective at doing this, at least temporarily, would your 
answer change?
5–9	 Manpower requirements indicate that a specific functional pool will increase sharply 
from eight to seventeen people over the next two weeks and then drop back to eight people. 
Should you question this?
5–10	 Below are several sources from which legal authority can be derived. State whether each 
source provides the project manager with sufficient authority from which he can effectively 
manage the project.
a.	 The project or organizational charter
b.	 The project manager’s position in the organization
c.	 The job description and specifications for project managers

178
Management Functions 
d.	 Policy documents
e.	 The project manager’s “executive” rank
f.	 Dollar value of the contract
g.	 Control of funds
5–11	 Below are three broad statements describing the functions of management. For each 
statement, are we referring to upper-level management, project management, or functional man-
agement?
a.	 Acquire the best available assets and try to improve them.
b.	 Provide a good working environment for all personnel.
c.	 Make sure that all resources are applied effectively and efficiently such that all con-
straints are met, if possible.
5–12	 Is it possible for a product manager to have the same degree of tunnel vision that a project 
manager has? If so, under what circumstances?
5–13	 Are there situations in which a project manager can wait for long-term changes instead of 
an immediate response to actions?
5–14	 Should a project manager encourage the flow of problems to him? If yes, should he be 
selective in which ones to resolve?
5–15	 If all projects are different, should there exist a uniform company policies and procedures 
manual?
5–16	 Should time robbers be added to direct labor standards for pricing out work?
5–17	 Is it possible for a project manager to improve his time management skills by knowing the 
“energy cycle” of his people? Can this energy cycle be a function of the hour of the day, day of 
the week, or whether overtime is required?
THE TROPHY PROJECT
The ill-fated Trophy Project was in trouble right from the start. Reichart, who had been an assis-
tant project manager, was involved with the project from its conception. When the Trophy Pro-
ject was accepted by the company, Reichart was assigned as the project manager. The program 
schedules started to slip from day one, and expenditures were excessive. Reichart found that 
the functional managers were charging direct labor time to his project but working on their own 
“pet” projects. When Reichart complained of this, he was told not to meddle in the functional 
manager’s allocation of resources and budgeted expenditures. After approximately six months, 
Reichart was requested to make a progress report directly to corporate and division staffs.
Reichart took this opportunity to bare his soul. The report substantiated that the project 
was forecasted to be one complete year behind schedule. Reichart’s staff, as supplied by the 
line managers, was inadequate to stay at the required pace, let alone make up any time that had 
already been lost. The estimated cost at completion at this interval showed a cost overrun of at

179
least 20 percent. This was Reichart’s first opportunity to tell his story to people who were in a 
position to correct the situation. The result of Reichart’s frank, candid evaluation of the Trophy 
Project was very predictable. Nonbelievers finally saw the light, and the line managers realized 
that they had a role to play in the completion of the project. Most of the problems were now 
out in the open and could be corrected by providing adequate staffing and resources. Corporate 
staff ordered immediate remedial action and staff support to provide Reichart a chance to bail 
out his program.
The results were not at all what Reichart had expected. He no longer reported to the project 
office; he now reported directly to the operations manager. Corporate staff’s interest in the pro-
ject became very intense, requiring a 7:00 A.M. meeting every Monday morning for complete 
review of the project status and plans for recovery. Reichart found himself spending more time 
preparing paperwork, reports, and projections for his Monday morning meetings than he did 
administering the Trophy Project. The main concern of corporate was to get the project back on 
schedule. Reichart spent many hours preparing the recovery plan and establishing manpower 
requirements to bring the program back onto the original schedule.
Group staff, in order to closely track the progress of the Trophy Project, assigned an as-
sistant program manager. The assistant program manager determined that a sure cure for the 
Trophy Project would be to computerize the various problems and track the progress through 
a very complex computer program. Corporate provided Reichart with twelve additional staff 
members to work on the computer program. In the meantime, nothing changed. The functional 
managers still did not provide adequate staff for recovery, assuming that the additional man-
power Reichart had received from corporate would accomplish that task.
After approximately $50,000 was spent on the computer program to track the problems, it 
was found that the program objectives could not be handled by the computer. Reichart discussed 
this problem with a computer supplier and found that $15,000 more was required for program-
ming and additional storage capacity. It would take two months for installation of the additional 
storage capacity and the completion of the programming. At this point, the decision was made 
to abandon the computer program.
Reichart was now a year and a half into the program with no prototype units completed. 
The program was still nine months behind schedule with the overrun projected at 40 percent of 
budget. The customer had been receiving his reports on a timely basis and was well aware of the 
fact that the Trophy Project was behind schedule. Reichart had spent a great deal of time with 
the customer explaining the problems and the plan for recovery. Another problem that Reichart 
had to contend with was that the vendors who were supplying components for the project were 
also running behind schedule.
One Sunday morning, while Reichart was in his office putting together a report for the cli-
ent, a corporate vice president came into his office. “Reichart,” he said, “in any project I look 
at the top sheet of paper and the man whose name appears at the top of the sheet is the one I 
hold responsible. For this project your name appears at the top of the sheet. If you cannot bail 
this thing out, you are in serious trouble in this corporation.” Reichart did not know which way 
to turn or what to say. He had no control over the functional managers who were creating the 
problems, but he was the person who was being held responsible.
After another three months the customer, becoming impatient, realized that the Trophy 
Project was in serious trouble and requested that the division general manager and his entire 
staff visit the customer’s plant to give a progress and “get well” report within a week. The divi-
sion general manager called Reichart into his office and said, “Reichart, go visit our customer. 
Take three or four functional line people with you and try to placate him with whatever you feel 
is necessary.” Reichart and four functional line people visited the customer and gave a four-
and-a-half-hour presentation defining the problems and the progress to that point. The customer 

180
Management Functions 
was very polite and even commented that it was an excellent presentation, but the content was 
totally unacceptable. The program was still six to eight months late, and the customer demanded 
progress reports on a weekly basis. The customer made arrangements to assign a representa-
tive in Reichart’s department to be “on-site” at the project on a daily basis and to interface with 
Reichart and his staff as required. After this turn of events, the program became very hectic.
The customer representative demanded constant updates and problem identification and 
then became involved in attempting to solve these problems. This involvement created many 
changes in the program and the product in order to eliminate some of the problems. Reichart had 
trouble with the customer and did not agree with the changes in the program. He expressed his 
disagreement vocally when, in many cases, the customer felt the changes were at no cost. This 
caused a deterioration of the relationship between client and producer.
One morning Reichart was called into the division general manager’s office and introduced 
to Mr. “Red” Baron. Reichart was told to turn over the reins of the Trophy Project to Red 
immediately. “Reichart, you will be temporarily reassigned to some other division within the 
corporation. I suggest you start looking outside the company for another job.” Reichart looked 
at Red and asked, “Who did this? Who shot me down?”
Red was program manager on the Trophy Project for approximately six months, after 
which, by mutual agreement, he was replaced by a third project manager. The customer reas-
signed his local program manager to another project. With the new team the Trophy Project was 
finally completed one year behind schedule and at a 40 percent cost overrun.
QUESTIONS
1.	 Why did the project get into trouble?
2.	 What mistakes did Reichart make?
3.	 What could Reichart have done differently?
4.	 Did Reichart have support from a project sponsor?
MCROY AEROSPACE
McRoy Aerospace was a highly profitable company building cargo planes and refueling tankers 
for the armed forces. It had been doing this for more than fifty years and was highly success-
ful. But because of a downturn in the government’s spending on these types of planes, McRoy 
decided to enter the commercial aviation aircraft business, specifically wide-body planes that 
would seat up to 400 passengers, and compete head on with Boeing and Airbus Industries.
During the design phase, McRoy found that the majority of the commercial airlines would 
consider purchasing its plane provided that the costs were lower than the other aircraft manu-
facturers. While the actual purchase price of the plane was a consideration for the buyers, the 
greater interest was in the life-cycle cost of maintaining the operational readiness of the aircraft, 
specifically the maintenance costs.
Operations and support costs were a considerable expense and maintenance require-
ments were regulated by the government for safety reasons. The airlines make money when 
the planes are in the air rather than sitting in a maintenance hangar. Each maintenance depot 
maintained an inventory of spare parts so that, if a part did not function properly, the part 
could be removed and replaced with a new part. The damaged part would be sent to the manu-
facturer for repairs or replacement. Inventory costs could be significant but were considered 
a necessary expense to keep the planes flying.

One of the issues facing McRoy was the mechanisms for the eight doors on the aircraft. 
Each pair of doors had their own mechanisms, which appeared to be restricted by their loca-
tion in the plane. If McRoy could come up with a single design mechanism for all four pairs of 
doors, it would significantly lower the inventory costs for the airlines as well as the necessity to 
train mechanics on one set of mechanisms rather than four. On the cargo planes and refueling 
tankers, each pair of doors had a unique mechanism. For commercial aircrafts, finding one de-
sign for all doors would be challenging.
Mark Wilson, one of the department managers at McRoy’s design center, assigned Jack, 
the best person he could think of to work on this extremely challenging project. If anyone could 
accomplish it, it was Jack. If Jack could not do it, Mark sincerely believed it could not be done.
The successful completion of this project would be seen as a value-added opportunity for 
McRoy’s customers and could make a tremendous difference from a cost and efficiency stand-
point. McRoy would be seen as an industry leader in life-cycle costing, and this could make the 
difference in getting buyers to purchase commercial planes from McRoy Aerospace.
The project was to design an opening/closing mechanism that was the same for all of the 
doors. Until now, each door could have a different set of open/close mechanisms, which made 
the design, manufacturing, maintenance, and installation processes more complex, cumber-
some, and costly.
Without a doubt, Jack was the best—and probably the only—person to make this happen 
even though the equipment engineers and designers all agreed that it could not be done. Mark 
put all of his cards on the table when he presented the challenge to Jack. He told him whole-
heartedly that his only hope was for Jack to take on this project and explore it from every pos-
sible, out-of-the-box angle he could think of. But Jack said right off the bat that this might not 
be possible. Mark was not happy hearing Jack say this right away, but he knew Jack would do 
his best.
Jack spent two months looking at the problem and simply could not come up with the solu-
tion needed. Jack decided to inform Mark that a solution was not possible. Both Jack and Mark 
were disappointed that a solution could not be found.
“I know you’re the best, Jack,” stated Mark. “I can’t imagine anyone else even coming 
close to solving this critical problem. I know you put forth your best effort and the problem was 
just too much of a challenge. Thanks for trying. But if I had to choose one of your coworkers 
to take another look at this project, who might have even half a chance of making it happen? 
Who would you suggest? I just want to make sure that we have left no stone unturned,” he said 
rather glumly.
Mark’s words caught Jack by surprise. Jack thought for a moment and you could practi-
cally see the wheels turning in his mind. Was Jack thinking about who could take this project 
on and waste more time trying to find a solution? No, Jack’s wheels were turning on the subject 
of the challenging problem itself. A glimmer of an idea whisked through his brain and he said, 
“Can you give me a few days to think about some things, Mark?” he asked pensively.
Mark had to keep the little glimmer of a smile from erupting full force on his face. “Sure, 
Jack,” he said. “Like I said before, if anyone can do it, it’s you. Take all the time you need.” A few 
weeks later, the problem was solved and Jack’s reputation rose to even higher heights than before.
QUESTIONS
1.	 Was Mark correct in what he said to get Jack to continue investigating the problem?
2.	 Should Mark just have given up on the idea rather than what he said to Jack?
3.	 Should Mark have assigned this to someone else rather than giving Jack a second chance, 
and if so, how might Jack have reacted?

THE POOR WORKER
Paula, the project manager, was reasonably happy the way that work was progressing on 
the project. The only issue was the work being done by Frank. Paula knew from the start of 
the project that Frank was a mediocre employee and often regarded as a troublemaker. The 
tasks that Frank was expected to perform were not overly complex and the line manager as-
sured Paula during the staffing function that Frank could do the job. The line manager also 
informed Paula that Frank demonstrated behavioral issues on other projects and sometimes 
had to be removed from the project. Frank was a chronic complainer and found fault with 
everything and everybody. But the line manager also assured Paula that Frank’s attitude was 
changing and that the line manager would get actively involved if any of these issues began 
to surface on Paula’s project. Reluctantly, Paula agreed to allow Frank to be assigned to her 
project.
Unfortunately, Frank’s work on the project was not being performed according to Paula’s 
standards. Paula had told Frank on more than one occasion what she expected from him, but 
Frank persisted in doing his own thing. Paula was now convinced that the situation was getting 
worse. Frank’s work packages were coming in late and sometimes over budget. Frank continu-
ously criticized Paula’s performance as a project manager and Frank’s attitude was beginning to 
affect the performance of some of the other team members. Frank was lowering the morale of 
the team. It was obvious that Paula had to take some action.
QUESTIONS
1.	 What options are available to Paula?
2.	 If Paula decides to try to handle the situation first by herself rather than approach the line 
manager, what should Paula do and in what order?
3.	 If all of Paula’s attempts fail to change the worker’s attitude and the line refuses to remove 
the worker, what options are available to Paula?
4.	 What rights, if any, does Paula have with regard to wage and salary administration regarding 
this employee?

THE PRIMA DONNA
Ben was placed in charge of a one-year project. Several of the work packages had to be 
­accomplished by the Mechanical Engineering Department and required three people to be as-
signed full time for the duration of the project. When the project was originally proposed, the 
­Mechanical Engineering Department manager estimated that he would assign three of his grade 

7 employees to do the job. Unfortunately, the start date of the project was delayed by three 
months and the department manager was forced to assign the resources he planned to use on 
another project. The resources that would be available for Ben’s project at the new starting date 
were two grade 6s and a grade 9.
The department manager assured Ben that these three employees could adequately perform 
the required work and that Ben would have these three employees full-time for the duration of 
the project. Furthermore, if any problems occurred, the department manager made it clear to 
Ben that he personally would get involved to make sure that the work packages and deliverables 
were completed correctly.
Ben did not know any of the three employees personally. But since a grade 9 was con-
sidered a senior subject matter expert pay grade, Ben made the grade 9 the lead engineer 
representing his department on Ben’s project. It was common practice for the senior-most 
person assigned from each department to act as the lead and even as an assistant project man-
ager. The lead was often allowed to interface with the customers at information exchange 
meetings.
By the end of the first month of the project, work was progressing as planned. Although 
most of the team seemed happy to be assigned to the project and team morale was high, the two 
grade 6 team members in the Mechanical Engineering Department were disenchanted with the 
project. Ben interviewed the two grade 6 employees to see why they were somewhat unhappy. 
One of the two employees stated:
The grade 9 wants to do everything himself. He simply does not trust us. Every time we 
use certain equations to come up with a solution, he must review everything we did in 
microscopic detail. He has to approve everything. The only time he does not micromanage 
us is when we have to make copies of reports. We do not feel that we are part of the team.
Ben was unsure how to handle the situation. Resources are assigned by the department 
managers and usually cannot be removed from a project without the permission of the de-
partment managers. Ben met with the mechanical engineering department manager, who 
stated:
The grade 9 that I assigned is probably the best worker in my department. Unfortunately, 
he’s a prima donna. He trusts nobody else’s numbers or equations other than his own. 
Whenever co-workers perform work, he feels obligated to review everything that they have 
done. Whenever possible, I try to assign him to one-person activities so that he will not 
have to interface with anyone. But I have no other one-person assignments right now, 
which is why I assigned him to your project. I was hoping he would change his ways and 
work as a real team member with the two grade 6 workers, but I guess not. Don’t worry 
about it. The work will get done, and get done right. We’ll just have to allow the two grade 
6 employees to be unhappy for a little while.
Ben understood what the department manager said but was not happy about the situ-
ation. Forcing the grade 9 to be removed could result in the assignment of someone with 
lesser capabilities, and this could impact the quality of the deliverables from the Mechanical 
Engineering Department. Leaving the grade 9 in place for the duration of the project would 
alienate the two grade 6 employees and their frustration and morale issues could infect other 
team members.

THE RELUCTANT WORKERS
Tim Aston had changed employers three months ago. His new position was project manager. 
At first, he had had stars in his eyes about becoming the best project manager that his company 
had ever seen. Now, he wasn’t sure if project management was worth the effort. He made an 
appointment to see Phil Davies, director of project management.
Tim Aston: “Phil, I’m a little unhappy about the way things are going. I just can’t seem 
to motivate my people. Every day, at 4:30 P.M., all of my people clean off their desks and 
go home. I’ve had people walk out of late afternoon team meetings because they were 
afraid that they’d miss their car pool. I have to schedule morning team meetings.”
Phil Davies: “Look, Tim. You’re going to have to realize that in a project environment, 
people think that they come first and that the project is second. This is a way of life in our 
organizational form.”
Tim Aston: “I’ve continually asked my people to come to me if they have problems. 
I find that the people do not think that they need help and, therefore, do not want it. I just 
can’t get my people to communicate more.”
Phil Davies: “The average age of our employees is about forty-six. Most of our people 
have been here for twenty years. They’re set in their ways. You’re the first person that we’ve 
hired in the past three years. Some of our people may just resent seeing a thirty-year-old 
project manager.”
Tim Aston: “I found one guy in the accounting department who has an excellent head 
on his shoulders. He’s very interested in project management. I asked his boss if he’d 
release him for a position in project management, and his boss just laughed at me, saying 
something to the effect that as long as that guy is doing a good job for him, he’ll never be 
released for an assignment elsewhere in the company. His boss seems more worried about 
his personal empire than he does in what’s best for the company.
“We had a test scheduled for last week. The customer’s top management was planning on 
flying in for firsthand observations. Two of my people said that they had programmed vacation 
days coming, and that they would not change, under any conditions. One guy was going fish-
ing and the other guy was planning to spend a few days working with fatherless children in our 
community. Surely, these guys could change their plans for the test.”
Phil Davies: “Many of our people have social responsibilities and outside interests. We 
encourage social responsibilities and only hope that the outside interests do not interfere with 
their jobs.
“There’s one thing you should understand about our people. With an average age of forty-
six, many of our people are at the top of their pay grades and have no place to go. They must 
look elsewhere for interests. These are the people you have to work with and motivate. Perhaps 
you should do some reading on human behavior.”

LEADERSHIP EFFECTIVENESS (B)
Your company has just won a contract for an outside customer. The con-
tract is for one year, broken down as follows: R&D, six months; proto-
type testing, one month; manufacturing, five months. In addition to the 
risks involved in the R&D stage, both your management and the cus-
tomer have stated that there will be absolutely no trade-offs on time, cost, 
or performance.
When you prepared the proposal six months ago, you planned and 
budgeted for a full-time staff of five people, in addition to the functional 
support personnel. Unfortunately, due to limited resources, your staff 
(i.e., the project office) will be as follows:
Tom: An excellent engineer, somewhat of a prima donna, but has worked very well with 
you on previous projects. You specifically requested Tom and were fortunate to have him as-
signed, although your project is not regarded as a high priority. Tom is recognized as both a 
technical leader and expert, and is considered perhaps the best engineer in the company. Tom 
will be full-time for the duration of the project.
Bob: Started with the company a little over a year ago, and may be a little “wet behind the 
ears.” His line manager has great expectations for him in the future but, for the time being, wants 
you to give him on-the-job-training as a project office team member. Bob will be full-time on 
your project.

Management Functions 
Carol: She has been with the company for twenty years and does an acceptable job. She has 
never worked on your projects before. She is full-time on the project.
George: He has been with the company for six years, but has never worked on any of your 
projects. His superior tells you that he will be only half-time on your project until he finishes 
a crash job on another project. He should be available for full-time work in a month or two. 
George is regarded as an outstanding employee.
Management informs you that there is nobody else available to fill the fifth position. You’ll 
have to spread the increased workload over the other members. Obviously, the customer may 
not be too happy about this.
In each situation that follows, circle the best answer. The grading system will be provided 
later. Remember: These staff individuals are “dotted” to you and “solid” to their line manager, 
although they are in your project office.
Situation 1: The project office team members have been told to report to you this morning. They 
have all received your memo concerning the time and place of the kickoff meeting. However, 
they have not been provided any specific details concerning the project except that the project 
will be at least one year in duration. For your company, this is regarded as a long-term project. 
A good strategy for the meeting would be:
	
A.	 The team must already be self-motivated or else they would not have been assigned. 
Simply welcome them and assign homework.
	
B.	 Motivate the employees by showing them how they will benefit: esteem, pride, and self-
actualization. Minimize discussion on specifics.
	
C.	 Explain the project and ask them for their input. Try to get them to identify alternatives 
and encourage group decision making.
	
D.	 Identify the technical details of the project: the requirements, performance standards, 
and expectations.
Situation 2: You give the team members a copy of the winning proposal and a “confidential” 
memo describing the assumptions and constraints you considered in developing the proposal. 
You tell your team to review the material and be prepared to perform detailed planning at the 
meeting you have scheduled for the following Monday. During Monday’s planning meeting, 
you find that Tom (who has worked with you before) has established a take-charge role and has 
done some of the planning that should have been the responsibility of other team members. You 
should:
	
A.	 Do nothing. This may be a beneficial situation. However, you may wish to ask if the 
other project office members wish to review Tom’s planning.
	
B.	 Ask each team member individually how he or she feels about Tom’s role. If they 
complain, have a talk with Tom.
	
C.	 Ask each team member to develop his or her own schedules and then compare results.
	
D.	 Talk to Tom privately about the long-term effects of his behavior.
Situation 3: Your team appears to be having trouble laying out realistic schedules that will 
satisfy the customer’s milestones. They keep asking you pertinent questions and seem to be 
making the right decisions, but with difficulty.
	
A.	 Do nothing. If the team is good, they will eventually work out the problem.
	
B.	 Encourage the team to continue but give some ideas as to possible alternatives. Let them 
solve the problem.

	
C.	 Become actively involved and help the team solve the problem. Supervise the planning 
until completion.
	
D.	 Take charge yourself and solve the problem for the team. You may have to provide 
continuous direction.
Situation 4: Your team has taken an optimistic approach to the schedule. The functional manag-
ers have reviewed the schedules and have sent your team strong memos stating that there is no 
way that they can support your schedules. Your team’s morale appears to be very low. Your team 
expected the schedules to be returned for additional iterations and trade-offs, but not with such 
harsh words from the line managers. You should:
	
A.	 Take no action. This is common to these types of projects and the team must learn to 
cope.
	
B.	 Call a special team meeting to discuss the morale problem and ask the team for 
recommendations. Try to work out the problem.
	
C.	 Meet with each team member individually to reinforce his or her behavior and 
performance. Let members know how many other times this has occurred and been 
resolved through trade-offs and additional iterations. State your availability to provide 
advice and support.
	
D.	 Take charge and look for ways to improve morale by changing the schedules.
Situation 5: The functional departments have begun working, but are still criticizing the sched-
ules. Your team is extremely unhappy with some of the employees assigned out of one function-
al department. Your team feels that these employees are not qualified to perform the required 
work. You should:
	
A.	 Do nothing until you are absolutely sure (with evidence) that the assigned personnel 
cannot perform as needed.
	
B.	 Sympathize with your team and encourage them to live with this situation until an 
alternative is found.
	
C.	 Assess the potential risks with the team and ask for their input and suggestions. Try to 
develop contingency plans if the problem is as serious as the team indicates.
	
D.	 Approach the functional manager and express your concern. Ask to have different 
employees assigned.
Situation 6: Bob’s performance as a project office team member has begun to deteriorate. You are 
not sure whether he simply lacks the skills, cannot endure the pressure, or cannot assume part of 
the additional work that resulted from the fifth position in the project being vacant. You should:
	
A.	 Do nothing. The problem may be temporary and you cannot be sure that there is a 
measurable impact on the project.
	
B.	 Have a personal discussion with Bob, seek out the cause, and ask him for a solution.
	
C.	 Call a team meeting and discuss how productivity and performance are decreasing. Ask 
the team for recommendations and hope Bob gets the message.
	
D.	 Interview the other team members and see if they can explain Bob’s actions lately. Ask 
the other members to assist you by talking to Bob.
Situation 7: George, who is half-time on your project, has just submitted for your approval his 
quarterly progress report for your project. After your signature has been attained, the report is 
Case Studies
191

192
Management Functions 
sent to senior management and the customer. The report is marginally acceptable and not at 
all what you would have expected from George. George apologizes to you for the report and 
blames it on his other project, which is in its last two weeks. You should:
	
A.	 Sympathize with George and ask him to rewrite the report.
	
B.	 Tell George that the report is totally unacceptable and will reflect on his ability as a 
project office team member.
	
C.	 Ask the team to assist George in redoing the report since a bad report reflects on 
everyone.
	
D.	 Ask one of the other team members to rewrite the report for George.
Situation 8: You have completed the R&D stage of your project and are entering phase II: pro-
totype testing. You are entering month seven of the twelve-month project. Unfortunately, the 
results of phase I R&D indicate that you were too optimistic in your estimating for phase II and 
a schedule slippage of at least two weeks is highly probable. The customer may not be happy. 
You should:
	
A.	 Do nothing. These problems occur and have a way of working themselves out. The end 
date of the project can still be met.
	
B.	 Call a team meeting to discuss the morale problem resulting from the slippage. If morale 
is improved, the slippage may be overcome.
	
C.	 Call a team meeting and seek ways of improving productivity for phase II. Hopefully, 
the team will come up with alternatives.
	
D.	 This is a crisis and you must exert strong leadership. You should take control and assist 
your team in identifying alternatives.
Situation 9: Your rescheduling efforts have been successful. The functional managers have giv-
en you adequate support and you are back on schedule. You should:
	
A.	 Do nothing. Your team has matured and is doing what they are paid to do.
	
B.	 Try to provide some sort of monetary or nonmonetary reward for your team (e.g., 
management-granted time off or a dinner team meeting).
	
C.	 Provide positive feedback/reinforcement for the team and search for ideas for shortening 
phase III.
	
D.	 Obviously, your strong leadership has been effective. Continue this role for the phase III 
schedule.
Situation 10: You are now at the end of the seventh month and everything is proceeding as 
planned. Motivation appears high. You should:
	
A.	 Leave well enough alone.
	
B.	 Look for better ways to improve the functioning of the team. Talk to them and make 
them feel important.
	
C.	 Call a team meeting and review the remaining schedules for the project. Look for 
contingency plans.
	
D.	 Make sure the team is still focusing on the goals and objectives of the project.
Situation 11: The customer unofficially informs you that his company has a problem and may 
have to change the design specifications before production actually begins. This would be a 

catastrophe for your project. The customer wants a meeting at your plant within the next seven 
days. This will be the customer’s first visit to your plant. All previous meetings were informal 
and at the customer’s facilities, with just you and the customer. This meeting will be formal. To 
prepare for the meeting, you should:
	
A.	 Make sure the schedules are updated and assume a passive role since the customer has 
not officially informed you of his problem.
	
B.	 Ask the team to improve productivity before the customer’s meeting. This should please 
the customer.
	
C.	 Call an immediate team meeting and ask the team to prepare an agenda and identify the 
items to be discussed.
	
D.	 Assign specific responsibilities to each team member for preparation of handout material 
for the meeting.
Situation 12: Your team is obviously not happy with the results of the customer interface meet-
ing because the customer has asked for a change in design specifications. The manufacturing 
plans and manufacturing schedules must be developed anew. You should:
	
A.	 Do nothing. The team is already highly motivated and will take charge as before.
	
B.	 Reemphasize the team spirit and encourage your people to proceed. Tell them that 
nothing is impossible for a good team.
	
C.	 Roll up your shirt sleeves and help the team identify alternatives. Some degree of 
guidance is necessary.
	
D.	 Provide strong leadership and close supervision. Your team will have to rely on you for 
assistance.
Situation 13: You are now in the ninth month. While your replanning is going on (as a result 
of changes in the specifications), the customer calls and asks for an assessment of the risks in 
canceling this project right away and starting another one. You should:
	
A.	 Wait for a formal request. Perhaps you can delay long enough for the project to finish.
	
B.	 Tell the team that their excellent performance may result in a follow-on contract.
	
C.	 Call a team meeting to assess the risks and look for alternatives.
	
D.	 Accept strong leadership for this and with minimum, if any, team involvement.
Situation 14: One of the functional managers has asked for your evaluation of all of his func-
tional employees currently working on your project (excluding project office personnel). Your 
project office personnel appear to be working more closely with the functional employees than 
you are. You should:
	
A.	 Return the request to the functional manager since this is not part of your job description.
	
B.	 Talk to each team member individually, telling them how important their input is, and 
ask for their evaluations.
	
C.	 As a team, evaluate each of the functional team members, and try to come to some sort 
of agreement.
	
D.	 Do not burden your team with this request. You can do it yourself.
Situation 15: You are in the tenth month of the project. Carol informs you that she has the oppor-
tunity to be the project leader for an effort starting in two weeks. She has been with the company 
Case Studies
193

194
Management Functions 
for twenty years and this is her first opportunity as a project leader. She wants to know if she can 
be released from your project. You should:
	
A.	 Let Carol go. You do not want to stand in the way of her career advancement.
	
B.	 Ask the team to meet in private and conduct a vote. Tell Carol you will abide by the 
team vote.
	
C.	 Discuss the problem with the team since they must assume the extra workload, if 
necessary. Ask for their input into meeting the constraints.
	
D.	 Counsel her and explain how important it is for her to remain. You are already 
shorthanded.
Situation 16: Your team informs you that one of the functional manufacturing managers has 
built up a brick wall around his department and all information requests must flow through him. 
The brick wall has been in existence for two years. Your team members are having trouble with 
status reporting, but always get the information after catering to the functional manager. You 
should:
	
A.	 Do nothing. This is obviously the way the line manager wants to run his department. 
Your team is getting the information they need.
	
B.	 Ask the team members to use their behavioral skills in obtaining the information.
	
C.	 Call a team meeting to discuss alternative ways of obtaining the information.
	
D.	 Assume strong leadership and exert your authority by calling the line manager and 
asking for the information.
Situation 17: The executives have given you a new person to replace Carol for the last two 
months of the project. Neither you nor your team have worked with this man before. You 
should:
	
A.	 Do nothing. Carol obviously filled him in on what he should be doing and what is 
involved in the project.
	
B.	 Counsel the new man individually, bring him up to speed, and assign him Carol’s 
work.
	
C.	 Call a meeting and ask each member to explain his or her role on the project to the new 
man.
	
D.	 Ask each team member to talk to this man as soon as possible and help him come on 
board. Request that individual conversations be used.
Situation 18: One of your team members wants to take a late-afternoon course at the local col-
lege. Unfortunately, this course may conflict with his workload. You should:
	
A.	 Postpone your decision. Ask the employee to wait until the course is offered again.
	
B.	 Review the request with the team member and discuss the impact on his performance.
	
C.	 Discuss the request with the team and ask for the team’s approval. The team may have 
to cover for this employee’s workload.
	
D.	 Discuss this individually with each team member to make sure that the task requirements 
will still be adhered to.
Situation 19: Your functional employees have used the wrong materials in making a production 
run test. The cost to your project was significant, but absorbed in a small “cushion” that you 

saved for emergencies such as this. Your team members tell you that the test will be rerun with-
out any slippage of the schedule. You should:
	
A.	 Do nothing. Your team seems to have the situation well under control.
	
B.	 Interview the employees that created this problem and stress the importance of 
productivity and following instructions.
	
C.	 Ask your team to develop contingency plans for this situation should it happen 
again.
	
D.	 Assume a strong leadership role for the rerun test to let people know your concern.
Situation 20: All good projects must come to an end, usually with a final report. Your project has 
a requirement for a final report. This final report may very well become the basis for follow-on 
work. You should:
	
A.	 Do nothing. Your team has things under control and knows that a final report is 
needed.
	
B.	 Tell your team that they have done a wonderful job and there is only one more task to 
do.
	
C.	 Ask your team to meet and provide an outline for the final report.
	
D.	 You must provide some degree of leadership for the final report, at least the structure. 
The final report could easily reflect on your ability as a manager.

6.0 INTRODUCTION
Effective project communications ensure that we get the right infor-
mation to the right person at the right time and in a cost-effective 
manner. Proper communication is vital to the success of a project. 
Typical definitions of effective communication include:
●
●
An exchange of information
●
●
An act or instance of transmitting information
●
●
A verbal or written message
●
●
A technique for expressing ideas effectively
●
●
A process by which meanings are exchanged between individuals through a common system of symbols
In the previous chapter, we could argue that most of the leadership and management pitfalls are directly 
or indirectly attributed to a communications failure. Some people argue that the most important skill a pro-
ject manager can possess is the ability to communicate effectively to everyone.
6.1 MODELING THE COMMUNICATIONS ENVIRONMENT
The communications environment can be regarded as a network of channels. Most chan-
nels are two-way channels. The number of two-way channels, N, can be calculated from 
the formula
N
X X
=
−

Communications Management 
In this formula, X represents the number of people communicating with each other. 
For example, if four people are communicating (i.e., X = 4), then there are six two-way 
channels.
Sometimes it does not matter whether we have a few or many channels of communica-
tion. Breakdowns can occur. When a breakdown in communications occurs, disaster may 
follow, as Figure 6–1 demonstrates.
Figures 6–2 and 6–3 show typical communications patterns. Some people consider 
Figure 6–2 “politically incorrect” because project managers should not be identified as 
talking “down” to people. Most project managers communicate laterally, whereas line 
managers communicate vertically downward to subordinates. Sometimes it is politically 
incorrect to use the word “subordinates” because these people may be a higher pay grade 
than the project manager.
Figure 6–3 shows typical communications patterns between customers and contrac-
tors. The informal channels of communication, especially the employee to employee rela-
tion, can be troublesome if these people agree to scope modifications that are not called 
out contractually.
Figure 6–4 shows the complete communication model. The screens or barriers are 
from one’s perception, personality, attitudes, emotions, and prejudices.

Perception barriers occur because individuals can view the 
same message in different ways. Factors influencing percep-
tion include the individual’s level of education and region of 
experience.
●
●
Perception problems can be minimized by using words that 
have precise meaning.
●
●
Personality and interests, such as the likes and dislikes of individuals, affect com-
munications. People tend to listen carefully to topics of interest but turn a deaf ear 
to unfamiliar or boring topics.
●
●
Attitudes, emotions, and prejudices warp our sense of interpretation. Individuals 
who are fearful or have strong love or hate emotions will tend to protect them-
selves by distorting the communication process. Strong emotions rob individuals 
of their ability to comprehend.
Typical barriers that affect the encoding process include:
●
●
Communication goals
●
●
Communication skills
●
●
Frame of reference
●
●
Sender credibility
●
●

●

●
Hearing activity
●
●
Reading skills
●
●
Visual activity
●
●
Tactile sensitivity
●
●
Olfactory sensitivity
●

The communications environment is controlled by both the internal and external 
forces, which can act either individually or collectively. These forces can either assist or 
restrict the attainment of project objectives.
Typical internal factors include:
●
●
Power games
●
●
Withholding information
●
●
Management by memo
●
●
Reactive emotional behavior
●

The communications environment is also affected by:
●
●
Logistics/geographic separation
●
●
Personal contact requirements
●
●
Group meetings
●
●
Telephone
●
●
Correspondence (frequency and quantity)
Noise tends to distort or destroy the information within the message. Noise results 
from our own personality screens, which dictate the way we present the message, and 
perception screens, which may cause us to “perceive” what we thought was said. Noise 
therefore can cause ambiguity:
●
●
Ambiguity causes us to hear what we want to hear.
●
●
Ambiguity causes us to hear what the group wants.
●
●
Ambiguity causes us to relate to past experiences without being discriminatory.
6.2 THE PROJECT MANAGER AS A COMMUNICATOR
In a project environment, a project manager may very well spend 90 percent or more of his 
or her time communicating. Typical functional applications include:
●
●
Providing project direction, including decision making, authorizing work, direct-
ing activities, negotiating, and reporting (including briefings)
●
●
Attending meetings
●
●
Overall project management
●
●
Marketing and selling
●
●
Public relations
●
●
Records management, including minutes, memos/letters/newsletters, reports, 
specifications, and contract documents
Because of the time spent in a communications mode, the project manager may very 
well have as his or her responsibility the process of communications management. Com-
munications management is the formal or informal process of conducting or supervis-
ing the exchange of information either upward, downward, laterally, or diagonally. There 
appears to be a direct correlation between the project manager’s ability to manage the com-
munications process and project performance.
The communications process is more than simply conveying a message; it is also a 
source for control. Proper communications let the employees in on the act because employ-
ees need to know and understand. Communication must convey both information and moti-
vation. The problem, therefore, is how to communicate. Below are six simple steps:
●
●
Think through what you wish to accomplish.
●
●
Determine the way you will communicate.

The Project Manager as a Communicator
209
●
●
Appeal to the interest of those affected.
●
●
Give feedback on ways others communicate to you.
●
●
Get feedback on what you communicate.
●
●
Test the effectiveness of your communication by relying on others to carry out 
your instructions.
Knowing how to communicate does not guarantee that a clear message will be generated. 
There are techniques that can be used to improve communications. These techniques include:
●
●
Obtaining feedback, possibly in more than one form
●
●
Establishing multiple communications channels
●
●
Using face-to-face communications if possible
●
●
Determining how sensitive the receiver is to your communications
●
●
Being aware of symbolic meaning such as expressions on people’s faces
●
●
Communicating at the proper time
●
●
Reinforcing words with actions
●
●
Using a simple language
●
●
Using redundancy (i.e., saying it two different ways) whenever possible
With every effort to communicate there are always barriers. The barriers include:
●
●
Receiver hearing what he wants to hear. This results from people doing the same 
job so long that they no longer listen.
●
●
Sender and receiver having different perceptions. This is vitally important in inter-
preting contractual requirements, statements of work, and proposal information 
requests.
●
●
Receiver evaluating the source before accepting the communications.
●
●
Receiver ignoring conflicting information and doing as he pleases.
●
●
Words meaning different things to different people.
●
●
Communicators ignoring nonverbal cues.
●
●
Receiver being emotionally upset.
The scalar chain of command can also become a barrier with regard to in-house commu-
nications. The project manager must have the authority to go to the general manager or coun-
terpart to communicate effectively. Otherwise, filters can develop and distort the final message.
Three important conclusions can be drawn about communica-
tions techniques and barriers:
●
●
Don’t assume that the message you sent will be received in 
the form you sent it.
●
●
The swiftest and most effective communications take place 
among people with common points of view. The manager 
who fosters good relationships with his associates will have 
little difficulty in communicating with them.
●
●
Communications must be established early in the project.
PMBOK ® Guide, 6th Edition
Chapter 10 Project Communications 
Management

210
Communications Management 
In a project environment, communications are often filtered. There are several reasons 
for the filtering of upward communications:
●
●
Unpleasantness for the sender
●
●
Receiver cannot obtain information from any other source
●
●
To embarrass a superior
●
●
Lack of mobility or status for the sender
●
●
Insecurity
●
●
Mistrust
Communication is also listening. Good project managers must be willing to listen to their 
employees, both professionally and personally. The advantages of listening properly are that:
●
●
Subordinates know you are sincerely interested.
●
●
You obtain feedback.
●
●
Employee acceptance is fostered.
The successful manager must be willing to listen to an individual’s story from 
beginning to end, without interruptions, and to see the problem through the eyes of the 
subordinate. Finally, before making a decision, the manager should 
ask the subordinate for his or her solutions to the problem.
The project manager’s communication skills and personality 
screen often dictates the communication style. Typical communica-
tion styles include:
●
●
Authoritarian: gives expectations and specific guidance
●
●
Promotional: cultivates team spirit
●
●
Facilitating: gives guidance as required, noninterfering
●
●
Conciliatory: friendly and agreeable, builds compatible team
●
●
Judicial: uses sound judgment
●
●
Ethical: honest, fair, by the book
●
●
Secretive: not open or outgoing (to project detriment)
●
●
Disruptive: breaks apart unity of group, agitator
●
●
Intimidating: “tough guy,” can lower morale
●
●
Combative: eager to fight or be disagreeable
Team meetings are often used to exchange valuable and neces-
sary information. The following are general guides for conducting 
more effective meetings:
●
●
Start on time. If you wait for people, you reward tardy behavior.
●
●
Develop agenda “objectives.” Generate a list and proceed; 
avoid getting hung up on the order of topics.
●
●
Conduct one piece of business at a time.
●
●
Allow each member to contribute in his own way. Support, 
challenge, and counter; view differences as helpful; dig for 
reasons or views.

●
●
Silence does not always mean agreement. Seek opinions.
●
●
Be ready to confront the verbal member: “Okay, we’ve heard from Mike on this 
matter; now how about some other views?”
●
●
Test for readiness to make a decision.
●
●

Many times, company policies and procedures can be established for the development 
of communications channels. Table 6–1 illustrates such communications guidelines.
Table 6–1.  Communications Policy
Program Manager
Functional Manager
Relationship
The program manager 
utilizes existing authorized 
communications media to the 
maximum extent rather than 
create new ones.
Communications up, down, and laterally 
are essential elements to the success of 
programs in a multiprogram organization, 
and to the morale and motivation of 
supporting functional organizations. 
In principle, communication from the 
program manager should be channeled 
through the program team member to 
functional managers.
Approves program plans, 
subdivided work description, 
and/or work authorizations, 
and schedules defining specific 
program requirements.
Assures his organization’s compliance with all 
such program direction received.
Program definition must be within the 
scope of the contract as expressed in 
the program plan and work breakdown 
structure.
Signs correspondence that 
provides program direction to 
functional organizations. Signs 
correspondence addressed to 
the customer that pertains to the 
program except that which has 
been expressly assigned by the 
general manager, the function 
organizations, or higher 
management in accordance 
with division policy.
Assures his organization’s compliance with all 
such program direction received. Functional 
manager provides the program manager with 
copies of all “Program” correspondence 
released by his organization that may affect 
program performance. Ensures that the 
program manager is aware of correspondence 
with unusual content, on an exception basis, 
through the cognizant program team member 
or directly if such action is warranted by the 
gravity of the situation.
In the program manager’s absence, the 
signature authority is transferred upward 
to his reporting superior unless an acting 
program manager has been designated. 
Signature authority for correspondence 
will be consistent with established 
division policy.
Reports program results and 
accomplishments to the 
customer and to the general 
manager, keeping them 
informed of significant 
problems and events.
Participates in program reviews, being aware 
of and prepared in matters related to his 
functional specialty. Keeps his line or staff 
management and cognizant program team 
member informed of significant problems 
and events relating to any program in which 
his personnel are involved.
Status reporting is the responsibility of 
functional specialists. The program 
manager utilizes the specialist 
organizations. The specialists retain their 
own channels to the general manager 
but must keep the program manager 
informed.

6.3 PROJECT REVIEW MEETINGS
Project review meetings are necessary to show that progress is being 
made on a project. There are three types of review meetings:
●
●
Project team review meetings: Most projects have weekly, 
bimonthly, or monthly meetings in order to keep the project 
manager and his team informed about the project’s status. 
These meetings are flexible and should be called only if they 
will benefit the team.
●
●
Executive management review meetings: Executive management has the right to 
require monthly status review meetings. However, if the project manager believes 
that other meeting dates are better (because they occur at a point where progress 
can be identified), then he or she should request them
●
●
Customer project review meetings: Customer review meetings are often the most 
critical and most inflexibly scheduled. Project managers must allow time to pre-
pare handouts and literature well in advance of the meeting.
6.4 PROJECT MANAGEMENT BOTTLENECKS
Poor communications can easily produce communications bottlenecks. The most common 
bottleneck occurs when all communications between the customer and the parent organiza-
tion must flow through the project office. Requiring that all information pass through the 
project office may be necessary but slows reaction times. Regardless of the qualifications 
of the project office members, the client always fears that the information he receives will 
be “filtered” prior to disclosure.
Customers not only like firsthand information, but also prefer that their technical spe-
cialists be able to communicate directly with the parent organization’s technical specialists. 
Many project managers dislike this arrangement, because they fear that the technical special-
ists may say or do something contrary to project strategy or thinking. These fears can be 
allayed by telling the customer that this situation will be permitted if, and only if, the cus-
tomer realizes that the remarks made by the technical specialists do not, in any way, shape, 
or form, reflect the position of the project office or company.
For long-duration projects the customer may require that the contractor have an estab-
lished customer representative office in the contractor’s facilities. The idea behind this 
is sound in that all information to the customer must flow through the customer’s pro-
ject office at the contractor’s facility. This creates a problem in that it attempts to sever 
direct communications channels between the customer and contractor project managers. 
The result is the establishment of a local project office to satisfy contractual requirements, 
while actual communications go from customer to contractor as though the local project 
office did not exist. This creates an antagonistic local customer project office.
Another bottleneck occurs when the customer’s project manager considers himself to 
be in a higher position than the contractor’s project manager and, therefore, seeks some 
higher authority with which to communicate. Project managers who seek status can often

jeopardize the success of the project by creating rigid communications channels. Almost 
always, there will exist a minimum of two paths for communications flow to and from the 
customer, which can cause confusion. Figure 6–5 identifies why communications bottle-
necks such as these occur.
6.5 ACTIVE LISTENING
Part of good communication skills is effective or active listening. Improper listening can 
result in miscommunication, numerous and costly mistakes, having to repeat work, sched-
ule delays, and the creation of a poor working environment. The result of poor listening is 
often more team meetings than originally thought and an abundance of action items. This 
can happen in any of the domain areas of the PMBOK ® Guide.
Active listening involves more than just listening to the words that the speaker says. It 
also involves reading body language. Sometimes, the person’s body language provides the 
listener with a much more accurate understanding of the intent of the message.
All elements of communication, including active listening, may be affected by bar-
riers that can impede the flow of conversation. Such barriers include distractions, trigger 
words, poor choice of vocabulary, and limited attention span. Listening barriers may be 
psychological (e.g., emotions) or physical (e.g., noise and visual distraction). Cultural dif-
ferences, including speakers’ accents, vocabulary, and misunderstandings due to cultural 
assumptions, often obstruct the listening process. Frequently, the listener’s personal inter-
pretations, attitudes, biases, and prejudices lead to ineffective communication.
Sometimes the barriers to active listening are created by the speaker. This can occur 
when the speaker continuously changes subjects, uses words and expressions that con-
fuse the listener, distracts the listener with improper or unnecessary body language, and 
neglects to solicit feedback as to whether the listener truly understood the message.

Typical active listening barriers created by the speaker include:
●
●
Creating a communications environment where excessive note-taking is required 
such that the listener never gets to digest the material or see the body language
●
●
Allowing constant interruptions to take place, which can lead to conflicts and argu-
ments or allowing the interruptions to get the actual subject of the communications 
way off track
●
●
Allowing people to cut you off, change subjects, and/or defend their positions
●
●
Allowing competitive interruptions
●
●
Speaking in an environment where there may be excessive noise or distractions
●
●
Talking without pauses or talking too fast
●
●
Neglecting to paraphrase or summarize critical points
●
●
Failing to solicit feedback by asking the right questions
●
●
Answering questions with responses that are slightly off
Typical active listening barriers created by the listener include:
●
●
Looking at distractions rather than focusing on the speaker
●
●
Letting your mind wander and looking off in the distance rather than staying focused
●
●
Failing to ask for clarification of information that you do not understand
●
●
Multitasking; doing some task, such as reading, while the speaker is presenting 
his or her message
●
●
Not trying to see the information through the eyes of the speaker
●
●
Allowing your emotions to cloud your thinking and listening
●
●
Being anxious for your turn to speak
●
●
Being anxious for the meeting to be over
Some techniques for active listening effectiveness might include:
●
●
Always face the speaker.
●
●
Maintain eye contact.
●
●
Look at the speaker’s body language.
●
●
Minimize distractions, whether internal or external.
●
●
Focus on what the speaker is saying without evaluating the message or defending 
your position.
●
●
Keep an open mind on what is being discussed and try to empathize with the 
speaker even if you disagree.
6.6 COMMUNICATION TRAPS
Projects are run by communications. The work is defined by the com-
munications tool known as the work breakdown structure. Actually, 
this is the easy part of communications, where everything is well 
defined. Unfortunately, project managers cannot document every-
thing they wish to say or relate to other people, regardless of the 
PMBOK ® Guide, 6th Edition

level in the company. The worst possible situation occurs when an outside customer loses 
faith in the contractor. When a situation of mistrust prevails, the logical sequence of events 
would be:
●
●
More documentation
●
●
More interchange meetings
●
●
Customer representation on your site
In each of these situations, the project manager becomes severely overloaded with 
work. This situation can also occur in-house when a line manager begins to mistrust a pro-
ject manager, or vice versa. There may suddenly appear an exponential increase in the flow 
of paperwork, and everyone is writing “protection” memos.
Communication traps occur most frequently with customer–contractor relationships 
but also occur between the project office and line managers.

Do not interrupt the speaker even though you have a different position.
6.7 PROJECT PROBLEM SOLVING
When we have problems and make decisions in our personal lives, we usually adopt a 
“let’s live with it” attitude. If the decision is wrong, we may try to change the decision. 
But in a project environment, changing a decision is more complicated and there may be 
a significant cost associated with the change. Some project decisions are irreversible. But 
there’s one thing we know for sure in a business environment: anybody who always makes 
the right decision probably isn’t making enough decisions. Expecting always to make the 
right decision is wishful thinking.
Problem solving and decision making go hand in hand. Problem solving involves 
understanding the problem, gathering the facts, and developing alternatives. Decisions 
are made when we select the appropriate alternative. There is a strong argument that deci-
sion making is also needed and used as part of identifying the problem and developing 
alternatives.
Today, there seems to be an abundance of information available to everyone. We all 
seem to suffer from information overload thanks to advances in information system tech-
nologies. Our main problem is being able to discern what information is critical to under-
stand the problem. For simplicity’s sake, information can be broken down into primary 
and secondary information. Primary information is information that is readily available to 
us. This is information that we can directly access from our desktop or laptop. Informa-
tion that is company sensitive or considered as proprietary information may be password 
protected but still accessible. Secondary information is information that must be collected 
from someone else.
Even with information overload, project managers generally do not have all of the 
information they need to solve a problem and make a timely decision. This is largely due 

216
Communications Management 
to the complexity of our projects as well as the complexity of the problems that need to be 
resolved. We generally rely upon a problem-solving team to provide us with the secondary 
information. The secondary information is often more critical for decision making than the 
primary information. Many times the secondary information is controlled by the subject 
matter experts, and they must tell us what information is directly pertinent to this problem.
Constraints play havoc with both the problem-solving and the decision-making pro-
cesses. The time constraint probably has the greatest impact on decision making. Time is 
not a luxury. The decision may have to be made even though the project manager has only 
partial information and may not fully comprehend the problem. Making decisions with 
complete information is usually not a luxury that the project team will possess. And to 
make matters worse, we often have little knowledge on what the impact of the decisions 
will be.
To understand problem solving, we must first understand what is meant 
by a problem. A problem is a deviation between an actual and desired 
situation. It is an obstacle, impediment, difficulty, or challenge, or any situation that invites 
resolution, the resolution of which is recognized as a solution or contribution toward a 
known purpose or goal. The problem could be to add something that is currently absent 
but desired, to remove something that is potentially bad, or to correct something that is not 
performing as expected. Therefore, problems can be formulated in a positive or negative 
manner. Problems are formulated in a positive manner if the problem is to determine how 
to take advantage of an opportunity.
We tend to identify alternatives as being good or bad choices. If the decision maker has 
all of the alternatives labeled as good or bad, then the job of the decision maker or project 
manager would be easy. Unfortunately, a problem implies that there exists doubt or uncer-
tainty or else a problem would not exist. This uncertainty can happen on all projects and 
therefore makes it difficult to classify all alternatives as only good or bad.
Problems imply that some alternatives exist. Problems that have no alternatives are 
called open problems. Not all problems can be solved or should be solved. There are pro-
jects that may need to be created to solve problems that require compliance to government 
regulations. For these projects, which are almost always very costly, all of the alternatives 
are often considered poor choices. When forced to comply, we select the best of the worst. 
But more often than not, we leave them as open problems until the very last minute, hoping 
the problem will be forgotten or will disappear.
Companies encourage all project team members to bring forth all problems quickly. 
The quicker the problem is exposed, the more time is available for finding a solution, the 
more alternatives are usually available, and the greater the number of resources that can 
assist in the solution. Unfortunately, some people simply may not want to identify the prob-
lem with the hope that they can resolve it by themselves before anyone finds out about it. 
This is true for people who may have been involved in creating the problem.
In such cases, people try to solve the problem by themselves, in secret, before anyone 
finds out about the problem. In reality, the problem is often hard to hide. Sometimes the 
entire problem-solving team is in collusion in hiding the problem. Unfortunately, problem-
solving sessions clearly identify that a problem exists and this alone could make it difficult 
to hide a problem. It is easier for one person to try to solve a problem secretly than for 
Identifying the Problem

an entire team to do so. There are several reasons for the team wanting the problem to be 
resolved quietly:
●
●
The client and/or the stakeholders may overreact to the problem and dictate the 
solution.
●
●
The client and/or stakeholders may overreact to the problem and remove financial 
support.
●
●
The client may cancel the project.
●
●
Problem resolution requires the discussion of proprietary or classified information.
●
●
Open identification of the problem may cause people to be fired.
●
●
Open identification of the problem may cause damage to your company’s image 
and reputation.
●
●
Open identification of the problem can result in potential lawsuits.
●
●
The cause of the problem is unknown.
●
●
The problem can be resolved quickly without any impact on the competing con-
straints and the deliverables.
Numerous techniques are available for data gathering about a problem. 
The selection of the technique is based upon the information being 
sought out, the timing of the information, who will provide the information, the criticality 
of the information, and the type of decisions that the information must support. Each tech-
nique comes with strengths and weaknesses. Some data-gathering techniques can be done 
quickly. Table 6–2 illustrates some of the most commonly used techniques.1
Using just one technique may not suffice. For the most part, data-gathering techniques 
are time consuming. It may be necessary to use several techniques in order to capture all of 
the required data. Effective data gathering requires an understanding of what questions to 
ask. While it is true that the questions will be predicated upon the type of problem, typical 
questions might include:
●
●
Are there any other resources or subject matter experts that can help us with this 
problem?
●
●
How many problems do we have?
●
●
Are there hidden problems that are below the surface?
●
●
What is the extent of the problem?
●
●
Is the problem getting worse, getting better, or remaining stable?
●
●
Did this problem exist previously?
●
●
Can the problem be quantified?
●
●
Can we determine the severity of the problem?
●
●
What physical evidence exists to identify the problem?
●
●
Who identified the problem?
●
●
To whom was it first reported?
●
●
Is there an action plan to collect additional information?
●
●
Do we have the right team members addressing this problem?

We generally believe that most problems are real and need to be resolved. But that is 
not always the case. Some problems are created because of the personalities of the indi-
viduals involved. Some people create problems unnecessarily as long as they can somehow 
benefit, perhaps by being the only person capable of solving the problem.
Problems are not resolved in a vacuum. Meetings are needed and the 
hard part is to determine who should attend. If people are not involved 
in the problem or the problem is unrelated to the work they do, then having them attend 
these meetings may be a waste of their time. This holds true for some of the team members 
as well. As an example, if the problem is with procurement, then it may not be necessary 
for the drafting personnel to be in attendance.
For simplicity’s sake, we shall consider just two types of meetings: problem solving and 
decision making. The purpose of the problem-solving meeting is to obtain a clear under-
standing of the problem, collect the necessary data, and develop a list of workable alterna-
tives accompanies by recommendations. More than one meeting will probably be required.
Sending out an agenda is important. The agenda should include a problem statement 
that clearly explains why the meeting is being called. If people know about the problem in 
advance, they will have a chance to think about the problem and bring the necessary infor-
mation, thus reducing some of the time needed for data gathering. It is also possible that 
the information gathered will identify that the real problem is quite different from what was 
considered to be the problem at first.
It is essential that subject matter experts familiar with the problem be in attendance. 
These subject matter experts may not be part of the original project team but may be 
brought in just to resolve this problem. The subject matter experts may also be contractors 
hired to assist with the problem. The people brought in for the identification of the problem 
and data gathering usually remain for the development of the alternatives. But there are 
situations where additional people may participate just for the evaluation of alternatives.
The decision-making meeting can be different from the problem-solving meeting. In 
general, all of the participants who were involved in the problem-solving meeting will most 
likely be in attendance in the decision-making meeting, but there may be a significant num-
ber of other participants. Project team members should have the ability to resolve problems, 
but not all of the team members have the authority to make decisions for their functional 
units. It is normally a good idea at the initiation of the project for the project manager to 
determine which team members possess this authority and which do not. Team members 
who do not possess decision-making authority will still be allowed to attend the decision-
making sessions but may need to be accompanied by their respective functional managers 
when decisions are required and voting takes place.
Stakeholder attendance is virtually mandatory at the decision-making meetings. The 
people making the decisions must have the authority to commit resources to the solution of 
the problem. The commitment could involve additional funding or the assignment of sub-
ject matter experts and higher-pay-grade employees. Project managers are responsible for 
the implementation of the solution. Therefore, the project manager must have the authority 
to obtain the resources needed for a timely solution to the problem.
Team meetings that involve problem solving and decision making often get peo-
ple to act in an irrational manner, especially if the outcome of the meeting can have a

negative impact on them personally. This is particularly true for people who are closely 
identified with the cause of the problem. You may also be inviting people you have never 
worked with previously, and you have no idea how they will react to the problem or the 
solution.
A major part of problem solving and ultimately the decision making 
involves the identification and analysis of a finite set of alternatives 
described in terms of some evaluative criteria. These criteria may be benefit or cost in 
nature or the criteria could simply be the adherence to the cost, schedule, and scope base-
lines of the project. Then the problem might be to rank these alternatives in terms of how 
attractive they are to the decision maker(s) when all the criteria are considered simultane-
ously. Another goal might be to just find the best alternative or to determine the relative 
total priority of each alternative.
The number of alternatives is often limited by the constraints imposed upon the pro-
ject. For example, if the schedule is exceeding the baseline schedule, then the project man-
ager may have five alternatives: overtime, performing some work in parallel rather than in 
series, adding more resources to the project, outsourcing some of the work to a lower cost 
supplier, or reducing the scope of the project. Each alternative will be accompanied by 
advantages and disadvantages. If the goal is to lower the costs, then there may be only one 
viable alternative, namely reducing the scope.
There are several variables that must be considered when identifying and selecting 
alternatives. The variables are usually project-specific and based upon the size, nature, and 
complexity of the problem. However, we can identify a list of core variables that usually 
apply to the identification and evaluation of most alternatives:
●
●
Cost: There is a cost associated with each alternative. This includes not only the 
cost of implementing the alternative but also the financial impact on the remaining 
work on the project.
●
●
Schedule: Implementing an alternative takes time. If the implementation time is 
too long or cannot be done in parallel with the other project work, then there may 
be a significant impact on the end date of the project.
●
●
Quality: Care must be taken that the speed to resolve a problem does not result in 
a degradation of quality in the project’s deliverables.
●
●
Resources: Implementing a solution requires resources. The problem is that the 
people needed with the necessary skills may not be available.
●
●
Feasibility: Some alternatives may seem plausible on paper but may be unfeasible 
when needed to be implemented. Feasibility or complexity of the alternative must 
be considered. Otherwise, you could make the problem worse.
●
●
Risks: Some alternatives expose the company to increased risks. These may 
be future risks (or even opportunities) that will appear well after the project is 
completed.
We must also look at the features that make up the alternatives. Many times there are 
several features that can be included in each of the alternatives and we may have a choice 
Alternatives

on whether to include these features. Part of understanding the boundary conditions is to 
know the importance of each feature. The features can be classified as:
●
●
Must have: Any alternative that does not include this feature should be discarded.
●
●
Should have: These are features that in most situations should be included in the 
alternatives that are being considered. Failure to consider these could result in a deg-
radation of performance. Some of these features may be omitted if including them 
results in unfavorable consequences when trying to satisfy the competing constraints.
●
●
Might have: These are usually add-ons to enhance performance but not neces-
sarily part of the project’s requirements. These are nice-to-have items but not a 
necessity when deciding upon a final solution. Might-have features are often char-
acterized as bells and whistles that are part of gold-plating efforts.
After looking at the variables and evaluating all of the alternatives, the conclusion may 
be that none of the alternatives are acceptable. In this case, the project manager may be 
forced to select the “best of the worst.”
It is possible that after evaluating the alternatives the best approach might 
just be a combination of alternatives. This is referred to as a hybrid alter-
native. Alternative A might be a high risk but a low cost of implementation. Alternative B 
might be a low risk but a high cost of implementation. By combining alternatives A and B, 
we may be able to come up with a hybrid alternative with an acceptable cost and risk factor.
Sometimes, creativity is needed to develop alternatives. Not all people are creative 
even if they are at the top of their pay grade. People can do the same repetitive task for so 
long that they are considered subject matter experts. They can rise to the top of their pay 
grade based upon experience and years of service. But that alone does not mean that they 
have creativity skills. Most people think that they are creative when, in fact, they are not. 
Companies also do not often provide their workers training in creative thinking.
In a project environment, creativity is the ability to use one’s imagination to come up 
with new and original ideas or things to meet requirements and/or solve problems. People 
are assigned to project teams based upon experience. It is impossible for the project man-
ager, and sometimes even the functional managers, to know whether these people have the 
creativity skills needed to solve problems that can arise during a project. Unless you have 
worked with these people previously, it is difficult to know if they have imagination, 
inspiration, ingenuity, inventiveness, vision, and resourcefulness, all common characteristics 
of creativity.
Creativity
Creativity is the ability to think up ideas to produce something new 
through imaginative skills, whether a new solution to a problem or a 
new method or device. Innovation is the ability to solve the problem by converting the idea 
into reality, whether it is a product, service, or any form of deliverable for the client. Inno-
vation goes beyond creative thinking. Creativity and innovation do not necessarily go hand 
in hand. Any problem-solving team can come up with creative solutions that cannot be 
implemented. Any engineering team can design a product (or a modification to a product) 
that manufacturing cannot build.
Innovation

Communications Management 
Innovation is more than simply turning an idea into reality. It is a process that creates 
value. Clients are paying for something of value. Whatever solution is arrived at must be 
recognized by the client as possessing value. The best of all possibilities is when the real 
value can be somehow shared between the client’s needs and your company’s strategy. The 
final alternative selected might increase or decrease the value of the end deliverables, as seen 
by the client, but there must always be some recognizable value in the solution selected.
Because of constraints and limitations, some solutions to a problem may necessitate 
a reduction in value compared to the original requirements of the project. This is referred 
to as negative innovation. In such cases, innovation for a solution that reduces value can 
have a negative or destructive effect upon the team. People could see negative innovation 
as damage to their reputation and career.
If the innovation risks are too great, the project team may recommend some form of 
open innovation. Open innovation is a partnership with those outside your company by 
sharing the risks and rewards of the outcome. Many companies have creative ideas for solv-
ing problems but lack the innovative talent to implement a solution. Partnerships and joint 
ventures may be the final solution.
There are four types of innovation. Each type comes with advantages:
●
●
Add-ons, enhancements, product/quality improvements, and cost reduction 
efforts: This type of innovation may be able to be accomplished quickly and with 
the existing resources in the company. The intent is to solve a problem and add 
incremental value to the end result.
●
●
Radical breakthrough in technology: This type of innovation has risks. You may 
not be able to determine when the breakthrough will be made and the accompany-
ing cost. Even if the breakthrough can be made, there is no guarantee that the client 
will receive added value from this solution. If the breakthrough cannot be made, 
the client may still be happy with the partial solution. This type of innovation may 
require the skills of only one or two people.
●
●
New family members: This is the creation of new products and may require a 
technological breakthrough.
●
●
Totally complex system or platform (next-generation projects): This is the 
solution with the greatest risk. If the complex system cannot be developed, then 
the project will probably be considered a total loss. A large number of highly tal-
ented resources are needed for this form of innovation.
Sometimes, we start out projects with the best of intentions and later 
discover that some problem has occurred that could result in the can-
cellation of the project. Rather than cancel the project outright, the solution might be to 
downsize the project and readjust our innovation attempts. Factors that can lead to a read-
justment in innovation include:
●
●
The market for the deliverable has shrunk.
●
●
The deliverable will be overpriced and demand will not be there.
●
●
The technical breakthrough cannot be achieved in a timely manner.
●
●
There is a loss of faith and enthusiasm by the team and they no longer believe this 
solution is workable.
Downsizing

Brainstorming
223
●
●
There is possible loss of interest by top management and the client.
●
●
There are insurmountable technical obstacles.
●
●
There is a significant decrease in the likelihood of success.
If these factors exist, then it is entirely possible that another alternative must be selected 
in order to salvage the project. As long as the client is willing to accept a possible reduction 
in final value, the project may be allowed to continue.
6.8 BRAINSTORMING
Throughout the life of any project, the team will be tested on their ability to find the best 
possible solution to a problem within the imposed limitations and boundaries. This could 
occur in the planning phase of the project where we must come up with the best possible 
plan or it could happen in any later phases where problems arise and the best solution must 
be found. These are situations where brainstorming techniques may not be appropriate. 
Most people seem to have heard about brainstorming but very few have been part of brain-
storming teams. Although we normally discuss brainstorming as a means for identifying 
alternative solutions to a problem, brainstorming can also be used for root-cause identifica-
tion of the problem.
There are four basic rules in brainstorming. These rules are intended to stimulate idea 
generation and increase overall creativity of the group while minimizing the inhibitions 
people may have about working in groups.
●
●
Focus on quantity: This rule focuses on the maximization of possible ideas, both 
good and bad. The assumption made is that the greater the number of ideas, the 
greater the chance of finding the optimal solution to a problem.
●
●
Withhold criticism: In brainstorming, criticism of ideas creates conflict and 
wastes valuable time needed to generate the maximum number of ideas. When 
people see ideas being criticized, they tend to withhold their own ideas to 
avoid being criticized. Criticism should take place but after the brainstorm-
ing session is completed. Typical brainstorming sessions last about an hour 
or less.
●
●
Welcome unusual ideas: All ideas should be encouraged, whether good or bad. 
People must be encouraged to think “outside the box,” and this may generate new 
perspectives and a new way of thinking. Sometimes, what appears as a radical 
solution initially may be the best possible solution in the end.
●
●
Combine and improve ideas: The best possible solution may be a combination 
of ideas. New ideas should be encouraged from the combination of ideas already 
presented.
The process of conducting a brainstorming session includes the following:
The process
●
●
Participants who have ideas but were unable to present them are encouraged to 
write down the ideas and present them later.

224
Communications Management 
●
●
The idea collector should number the ideas, so that the chairperson can use the 
number to encourage an idea generation goal, for example: We have 14 ideas now, 
let’s get it to 20!
●
●
The idea collector should repeat the idea in the words he or she has written verba-
tim to confirm that it expresses the meaning intended by the originator.
●
●
When many participants are having ideas, the one with the most associated idea 
should have priority. This is to encourage elaboration on previous ideas.
●
●
During a brainstorming session, managers and other superiors may be discouraged 
from attending, since it may inhibit and reduce the effect of the four basic rules, 
especially the generation of unusual ideas.
Evaluation
Brainstorming is not just about generating ideas for others to evaluate and select. Usu-
ally the group itself will, in its final stage, evaluate the ideas and select one as the solu-
tion to the problem proposed to the group.
●
●
The solution should not require resources or skills the members of the group do 
not have or cannot acquire.
●
●
If acquiring additional resources or skills is necessary, that needs to be the first 
part of the solution.
●
●
There must be a way to measure progress and success.
●
●
The steps to carry out the solution must be clear to all and amenable to being 
assigned to the members so that each will have an important role.
●
●
There must be a common decision-making process to enable a coordinated effort 
to proceed and to reassign tasks as the project unfolds.
●
●
There should be evaluations at milestones to decide whether the group is on track 
toward a final solution.
●
●
There should be incentives to participation so that participants maintain their 
efforts.
6.9 PREDICTING THE OUTCOME OF A DECISION
Problem solving and decision making require the project manager to predict how those 
impacted by the decision will react to the alternative selected. Soliciting feedback prior 
to the implementation of the solution seems nice to do, but the real impact of the decision 
may not be known until after full implementation of the solution. As an example, as part 
of developing a new product, marketing informs the project manager that the competition 
has just come out with a similar product, and marketing believes that we must add in some 
additional features into the product we are developing. The project team adds a significant 
number of “bells and whistles,” to the point where the product’s selling price is higher 
than that of the competition and the payback period is now elongated. When the product 
is eventually launched, the consumers do not believe that the added features are worth the 
additional cost.

Predicting the Outcome of a Decision
225
It is not always possible to evaluate or predict the impact of a decision when making a 
choice among alternatives. But soliciting feedback prior to full implementation is helpful.
A useful tool for assisting in the selection of alternatives is a consequence table, as 
shown in Table 6–3. For each alternative, the consequences are measured against a variety 
of factors such as each of the competing constraints. For example, an alternative could have 
a favorable consequence on quality but an unfavorable consequence on time and cost. Most 
consequence tables have the impacts identified quantitatively rather than qualitatively. Risk 
is also a factor that is considered, but the impact on risk is usually defined qualitatively 
rather than quantitatively.
If there are three alternatives and five constraints, then there may be fifteen rows 
in the consequence table. Once all fifteen consequences are identified, they are ranked. 
They may be ranked according to either favorable or unfavorable consequences. If none 
of the consequences is acceptable, then it may be necessary to perform trade-offs on the 
alternatives.
This could become an iterative process until an agreed-upon alternative is found. The 
table could be prepared quantitatively or qualitatively. With a quantitative table, weighting 
factors can be used for the relative importance of each of the competing constraints.
The people preparing the table are the people who make up the project team rather 
than possible outsiders that were brought in as subject matter experts for a particular prob-
lem. Project team members know the estimating techniques as well as the tools that are part 
of the organization process assets that can be used for determining impacts.
It is nice to have several possible alternatives for the solution to a problem.
Unfortunately, the alternative that is finally selected must be implemented, and that 
can create additional problems. One of the ways to analyze the impact is to create an impact 
implementation matrix, as shown in Figure 6–6. Each alternative considered could have a 
high or low impact on the project. Likewise, the implementation of each alternative could 
be easy or hard.
Each alternative is identified in its appropriate quadrant. The most obvious choice 
would be the alternatives that have a low impact and are easy to implement. But in reality, 
we often do not find very many alternatives in this quadrant.

Communications Management 
6.10 FACILITATION
A good facilitator helps people understand their common objectives and assists them in 
planning to achieve these objectives but without taking a particular position in the discus-
sion. This may be difficult for a project manager to do. Some people identify a facilitator as:
●
●
An enabler
●
●
Someone who helps people communicate and work together
●
●
A person who adds structure and process to decision making and problem solving
●
●
A person who creates synergy in the decision-making process
●
●
A person who can get everyone to do their best thinking
●
●
Someone who can tap into each person’s creative potential
The facilitator will not lead the group toward the answer that he or she thinks is best 
even if they possess an opinion on the subject matter. The facilitator does not evaluate 
ideas. The facilitator’s role is to make it easier for the group to arrive at its own answer, 
decision, solution, or deliverable. The facilitator sometimes acts as a resource for the group 
in the area of data analysis tools and problem-solving techniques. The facilitator must 
be comfortable with team-building techniques and group processes in order to assist the 
group in performing tasks and maintaining roles essential to team building. The facilitator 
intervenes to help the group stay focused and build cohesiveness, getting the job done with 
excellence, while developing the final product.
To keep the meeting on track, the facilitator must remain aware of the agenda, the 
time, and the flow of work. Facilitation skills are used to ensure total participation. Facili-
tators observe group development, noting both task and maintenance roles, and encourage 
group members to perform them. Facilitators handle inappropriate participant behaviors 
with skill and sensitivity.

Facilitation
227
The basic skills of a facilitator are about following good meeting practices: timekeep-
ing, following an agreed-upon agenda, and keeping a clear record. Facilitators also need a 
variety of crossover skills that include active listening skills, the ability to paraphrase, draw 
people into the discussion, balance participation, and make space for more reticent group 
members. It is critical to the facilitator’s role to have the knowledge and skill to be able to 
intervene in a way that adds to the group’s creativity rather than taking away from it.
Some of the readily apparent skills of good facilitators include:
●
●
Knowing how to deal with difficult people
●
●
Knowing how to minimize or prevent gamesmanship during meetings
●
●
Knowing when and how to use intervention effectively
●
●
Knowing the importance of a good environment for the meeting
●
●
Being able to identify when participants are becoming, lazy, bored, or frustrated
●
●
Being able to protect team members from attack
Good facilitators are able to see not only the obvious but also what else is happening 
that may not be quite apparent to the rest of the people in the meeting. In other words, 
facilitators must be experts in identifying negative dynamics or actions by people who can 
disrupt the intent of the meeting.
The facilitator is the protector of the processes used in group dynamics, more specifi-
cally as they relate to the project’s crossover skills requirements. The facilitator’s toolkit 
is a set of techniques, knowledge, and experience that they apply to protect the process the 
group is working through. The function of facilitation is to keep a meeting focused and 
moving and to ensure even participation. The facilitator makes sure these things occur, 
either by doing it or by monitoring the group and intervening as needed. The facilitator is 
the keeper of the task and doesn’t influence the content or product of the group. The facili-
tator pays attention to the way the group works—the process. The facilitator helps to create 
the process, adjust it, keep it heading in the right direction, and most importantly keep the 
people attached to it.
More projects today are being managed with virtual project teams. The people occupy 
positions within and outside of organizations. They reside throughout the hierarchy and 
they come from different functional areas. When they are assigned as part of the team, they 
bring with them, in addition to their knowledge, their backgrounds, beliefs, organizational 
culture, technical jargon, and personal behaviors. The facilitator may never see them all 
face to face, yet they may be part of the meeting. Understanding cultural diversity is essen-
tial. This may include:
●
●
Understanding that each person learns differently
●
●
Having tolerance for ambiguity and recognizing the need to explain things perhaps 
more than once
●
●
Demonstrating a sense of humility when needed
●
●
Understanding cultural differences
●
●
Demonstrating patience
●
●
Demonstrating interpersonal sensitivity
●
●
Possessing a sense of humor

228
Communications Management 
There are risks when the project manager assumes the role of the facilitator. The pro-
ject manager may try to lead the discussion toward the answer that the project manager 
wants. This is dangerous if the project manager acts as the facilitator and has preconceived 
expectations. Good facilitators do not have preconceived expectations or an axe to grind. 
Another problem might occur if people are afraid to contribute ideas because the project 
manager is leading the discussion and acting as the facilitator. The situation becomes more 
complicated if the project manager has wage and salary responsibilities for people in the 
meeting when acting as the facilitator.
Unfortunately, project budgets do not always allow for the cost of a facilitator when-
ever a meeting is needed. Project managers must learn facilitation skills to be effective. 
The project management office may have people assigned with facilitation skills and these 
people may be able to provide some support to various project teams.

COMMUNICATION FAILURES
Background
Herb had been with the company for more than eight years and had worked 
on various R&D and product enhancement projects for external clients. He 
had a Ph.D. in engineering and had developed a reputation as a subject matter expert. Because of 
his specialized skills, he worked by himself most of the time and interfaced with the various pro-
ject teams only during project team meetings. All of that was about to change. Herb’s company 
had just won a two-year contract from one of its best customers. The first year of the contract 
would be R&D and the second year would be manufacturing. The company made the decision 
that the best person qualified to be the project manager was Herb because of his knowledge of 
R&D and manufacturing. Unfortunately, Herb had never taken any courses in project manage-
ment, and because of his limited involvement with previous project teams, there were risks in 
assigning him as the project manager. But management believed he could do the job.

232
Communications Management 
Herb’s team consisted of fourteen people, most of whom would be full-time 
for at least the first year of the project. The four people who Herb would be 
interfacing with on a daily basis were Alice, Bob, Betty, and Frank.
●
●
Alice was a seasoned veteran who worked with Herb in R&D. Alice had been with the 
company longer than Herb and would coordinate the efforts of the R&D personnel.
●
●
Bob also had been with the company longer than Herb and had spent his career in 
engineering. Bob would coordinate the engineering efforts and drafting.
●
●
Betty was relatively new to the company. She would be responsible for all reports, 
records management, and procurements.
●
●
Frank, a five-year employee with the company, was a manufacturing engineer. 
Unlike Alice, Bob, and Betty, Frank would be part-time on the project until it was 
time to prepare the manufacturing plans.
For the first two months of the program, work seemed to be progressing as planned. Every-
one understood their role on the project and there were no critical issues.
The team is formed
Herb held weekly teams meetings every Friday from 2:00 to 3:00 p.m.
Unfortunately, the next team meeting would fall on Friday the 13th, and 
that bothered Herb because he was somewhat superstitious. He was considering canceling the 
team meeting just for that week but decided against it.
At 9:00 a.m. on Friday the 13th, Herb met with his project sponsor as he always did in the 
past. Two days before, Herb casually talked to his sponsor in the hallway and the sponsor told 
Herb that on Friday the sponsor would like to discuss the cash flow projections for the next six 
months and have a discussion on ways to reduce some of the expenditures. The sponsor had 
seen some expenditures that bothered him. As soon as Herb entered the sponsor’s office, the 
sponsor said:
It looks like you have no report with you. I specifically recall asking you for a report on the 
cash flow projections.
Herb was somewhat displeased over this. He specifically recalled that this was to be a 
discussion only and no report was requested. But Herb knew that “rank has its privileges” and 
questioning the sponsor’s communication skills would be wrong. Obviously, this was not a good 
start to Friday the 13th.
At 10:00 a.m., Alice came into Herb’s office and he could see from the expression on her 
face that she was somewhat distraught. Alice then spoke:
Herb, last Monday I told you that the company was considering me for promotion and the 
announcements would be made this morning. Well, I did not get promoted. How come you 
never wrote a letter of recommendation for me?
Herb remembered the conversation vividly. Alice did say that she was being considered for 
promotion but never asked him to write a letter of recommendation. Did Alice expect Herb to 
read between the lines and try to figure out what she really meant?
Friday the 13th

Herb expressed his sincere apologies for what happened. Unfortunately, this did not make 
Alice feel any better as she stormed out of Herb’s office. Obviously, Herb’s day was getting 
worse and it was Friday the 13th.
No sooner had Alice exited the doorway to Herb’s office when Bob entered. Herb could tell 
that Bob had a problem. Bob then stated:
In one of our team meetings last month, you stated that you had personally contacted 
some of my engineering technicians and told them to perform this week’s tests at 70°F, 
90°F, and 110°F. You and I know that the specifications called for testing at 60°F, 80°F, 
and 100°F. That’s the way it was always done and you were asking them to perform the 
tests at different intervals than the specifications called for.
Well, it seems that the engineering technicians forgot the conversation you had with 
them and did the tests according to the specification criteria. I assumed that you had 
followed up your conversation with them with a memo, but that was not the case. It 
seems that they forgot.
When dealing with my engineering technicians, the standard rule is, “If it’s not in 
writing, then it hasn’t been said.” From now on, I would recommend that you let me 
provide the direction to my engineering technicians. My responsibility is engineering 
and all requests of my engineering personnel should go through me.
Yes, Friday the 13th had become a very bad day for Herb. What else could go wrong, 
Herb thought. It was now 11:30 a.m. and almost time for lunch. Herb was considering locking 
his office door so that nobody could find him and then disconnecting his phone. But in walked 
Betty and Frank, and once again he could tell by the expressions on their faces that they had a 
problem. Frank spoke first:
I just received confirmation from procurement that they purchased certain materials that 
we will need when we begin manufacturing. We are a year away from beginning manu-
facturing and, if the final design changes in the slightest, we will be stuck with costly raw 
materials that cannot be used. Also, my manufacturing budget did not have the cash flow 
for early procurement. I should be involved in all procurement decisions involving manu-
facturing. I might have been able to get it cheaper that Betty did. So, how was this decision 
made without me?
Before Herb could say anything, Betty spoke up:
Last month, Herb, you asked me to look into the cost of procuring these materials. I found 
a great price at one of the vendors and made the decision to purchase them. I thought that 
this was what you wanted me to do. This is how we did it in the last company I worked for.
Herb then remarked:
I just wanted you to determine what the cost would be, not to make the final procurement 
decision, which is not your responsibility.
Friday the 13th was becoming possibly the worst day in Herb’s life. Herb decided not to 
take any further chances. As soon as Betty and Frank left, Herb immediately sent out emails 
to all of the team members canceling the team meeting scheduled for 2:00 to 3:00 p.m. that 
afternoon.

THE TEAM MEETING
Every project team has team meetings. The hard part is deciding when 
during the day to have the team meeting.
Background
Vince had been a “morning person” ever since graduating from col-
lege. He enjoyed getting up early. He knew his own energy cycle and 
the fact that he was obviously more productive in the morning than in 
the afternoon.
Vince would come into work at 6:00 a.m., 2 hours before the normal work force would 
show up. Between 6:00 a.m. and noon, Vince would keep his office door closed and often 
would not answer the phone. This prevented people from robbing Vince of his most productive 
time. Vince considered time robbers such as unnecessary phone calls lethal to the success of 
the project. This gave Vince 6 hours of productive time each day to do the necessary project 
work. After lunch, Vince would open his office door and anyone could then talk with him.
Know Your Energy Cycle
Vince’s energy cycle worked well, at least for Vince. But Vince had 
just become the project manager on a large project. Vince knew that 
he might have to sacrifice some of his precious morning time for team 
meetings. It was customary for each project team to have a weekly team meeting, and most 
project team meetings seemed to be held in the morning. Initially, Vince decided to go against 
tradition and hold team meetings between 2:00 and 3:00 p.m. This would allow Vince to keep 
his precious morning time for his own productive work. Vince was somewhat disturbed when 
there was very little discussion on some of the critical issues and it appeared that people were 
looking at their watches. Finally, Vince understood the problem. A large portion of Vince’s 
team members were manufacturing personnel that started work as early as 5:00 a.m. The 
manufacturing personnel were ready to go home at 2:00 p.m. and were tired.
The following week Vince changed the team meeting time to 11:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. 
It was evident to Vince that he had to sacrifice some of his morning time. But once again, 
during the team meetings there really wasn’t very much discussion about some of the critical 
issues on the project and the manufacturing personnel were looking at their watches. Vince 
was disappointed and, as he exited the conference room, one of the manufacturing personnel 
commented to Vince, “Don’t you know that the manufacturing people usually go to lunch 
around 11:00 a.m.?”
A Tough Decision

Vince came up with a plan for the next team meeting. He sent out emails to all of the team 
members stating that the team meeting would be at 11:00 a.m. to noon as before but the project 
would pick up the cost for providing lunch in the form of pizzas and salads. Much to Vince’s 
surprise, this worked well. The atmosphere in the team meeting improved significantly. There 
were meaningful discussions and decisions were being made instead of creating action items 
for future team meetings. It suddenly became an informal rather than a formal team meeting.
While Vince’s project could certainly incur the cost of pizzas, salads, and soft drinks for 
team meetings, this might set a bad precedent if this were to happen at each team meeting. 
At the next team meeting, the team decided that it would be nice if this could happen once 
or twice a month. For the other team meetings, it was decided to leave the time for the team 
meetings the same at 11:00 a.m. to noon, but they would be “brown bag” team meetings where 
the team members would bring their lunches and the project would provide only the soft drinks 
and perhaps some cookies or brownies.
QUESTIONS
1.	 How should a project manager determine when (i.e., time of day) to hold a team meeting? 
What factors should be considered?
2.	 What mistakes did Vince make initially?
3.	 If you were an executive in this company, would you allow Vince to continue doing this?

7.0 INTRODUCTION
In discussing the project environment, we have purposely avoided 
discussion of what may be its single most important characteristic: 
conflicts. Opponents of project management assert that the major rea-
son why many companies avoid changeover to a project management 
organizational structure is either fear or an inability to handle the resulting conflicts. Conflicts are a way 
of life in a project structure and can generally occur at any level in the organization, usually as a result of 
conflicting objectives.
The project manager has often been described as a conflict manager. In many organizations the project 
manager continually fights fires and crises evolving from conflicts, and delegates the day-to-day responsi-
bility of running the project to the project team members. Although this is not the best situation, it cannot 
always be prevented, especially after organizational restructuring or the initiation of projects requiring new 
resources. The ability to handle conflicts requires an understanding of why they occur. Asking and answer-
ing these four questions may help handle and prevent conflicts.
What are the project objectives and are they in conflict with other projects?

Conflicts 
7.1 THE CONFLICT ENVIRONMENT
In the project environment, conflicts are inevitable. Conflicts occur because people on the 
project team may have different values, interests, feelings, and goals. Project managers that 
cannot resolve these conflicts in a timely manner are doomed to failure. Some conflicts can 
be resolved quickly while other conflicts may take much longer to resolve. In general, the 
fewer the number of people involved in the conflict, the less time is needed to resolve the 
issues. Determining the amount of time needed to resolve an issue is difficult. Resolving 
conflicts with direct reportees is easier than resolving conflicts with those team members 
that are still attached administratively to other functional managers.
There are several causes of conflicts. First, project managers have historically been 
brought on board the project after the business case has been prepared. As a result, the busi-
ness case, schedule, cost, assumptions, and other constraints are imposed upon the project 
team. All of this happens well before a detailed project plan is prepared. Once the project 
plan is finally prepared, it is often the case that the deliverables cannot be achieved in a 
timely manner within the imposed requirements and constraints.
Second, companies often approve projects without any consideration being given to 
capacity planning and whether or not qualified resources will be available once the project 
begins. This is particularly true for companies that survive on competitive bidding. These 
companies may have no idea how many contracts they will win, if any. The result is usually 
a shortage of qualified resources.
Third, projects are often approved and added to the queue without knowing when the 
project will begin. High-level schedules are established from a go-ahead date rather than a 
calendar date and, once again, with little regard for available or qualified resources. Once 
the project officially begins, the qualifications or work habits of the assigned project team 
members may not fit the needs of the project. And, as expected, you are then told that these 
are the only resources that are available.
Fourth, your project must be accomplished without disrupting the ongoing business of 
your company and other projects being performed. If your project has a low priority, then you 
must expect that your most critical resources may be temporarily removed to put out fires else-
where in the company. These conflicts are highly probable in non–project-driven companies.
Fifth, the type of organizational structure can create conflicts. As an example, line 
managers that perform in a matrix structure are under tremendous pressure to staff a mul-
titude of projects possibly at the same time. A delay on one project could result is a late 
release of personnel needed to staff new projects about to begin.
Here, we described five common causes of conflicts that can occur as the project 
begins. There are also numerous other conflicts that can occur during project execution. 
Ginger Levin provides a good discussion of the types of conflicts that can exist in each life-
cycle phase as well as ways to handle them.1
Good project managers understand that conflicts will happen and try to plan for their 
resolution.

7.2 TYPES OF CONFLICTS
It is impossible to develop a list of all of the different types of conflicts that can exist on 
each and every project. All projects differ in size, scope, and complexity. The most com-
mon types of conflicts involve:

Staffing resources
●
●
Equipment and facilities
●
●
Capital expenditures
●
●
Costs
●
●
Technical opinions and trade-offs
●
●

Personality clashes
Each of these conflicts can vary in relative intensity over the life cycle of a project. 
However, project managers believe that the most frequently occurring conflicts are over 
schedules but the potentially damaging conflicts can occur over personality clashes. The 
relative intensity can vary as a function of:
●
●
Getting closer to project constraints
●
●
Having only two constraints instead of three (i.e., time and performance, but not cost)
●
●
The project life cycle itself
●
●
The person with whom the conflict occurs
Sometimes conflict is “meaningful” and produces beneficial results. These meaningful 
conflicts should be permitted to continue as long as project constraints are not violated and 
beneficial results are being received. An example of this is two technical specialists arguing 
that each has a better way of solving a problem, and each trying to find additional support-
ing data for his hypothesis.
Conflicts can occur with anyone and over anything. Some people contend that person-
ality conflicts are the most difficult to resolve.
Ideally, the project manager should report to someone high enough up to get timely 
assistance in resolving conflicts. Unfortunately, this is easier said than done. Therefore, 
project managers must plan for conflict resolution. As examples of this:
●
●
The project manager might wish to concede on a low-intensity conflict if he knows 
that a high-intensity conflict is expected to occur at a later point in the project.

Jones Construction Company has recently won a $120 million effort for a local 
company. The effort includes three separate construction projects, all beginning 
at the same time. Two of the projects are twenty-four months in duration, and the 
third is thirty-six months. Each project has its own project manager. When resource 
conflicts occur between the projects, the customer is usually called in.

Richard is a department manager who must supply resources to four different 
projects. Although each project has an established priority, the project managers 
continually argue that departmental resources are not being allocated effectively. 
Richard now holds a monthly meeting with all four of the project managers and 
lets them determine how the resources should be allocated.
Many executives feel that the best way of resolving conflicts is by establishing priori-
ties. This may be true as long as priorities are not continually shifted around.
The most common factors influencing the establishment of project priorities include:
●
●
The technical risks in development
●
●
The risks that the company will incur, financially or competitively
●
●
The nearness of the delivery date and the urgency
●
●
The penalties that can accompany late delivery dates
●
●
The expected savings, profit increase, and return on investment
●
●
The amount of influence that the customer possesses, possibly due to the size of 
the project
●
●
The impact on other projects or product lines
●
●
The impact on affiliated organizations
The ultimate responsibility for establishing priorities rests with top-level management. 
Yet even with priority establishment, conflicts still develop.
7.3 CONFLICT RESOLUTION
Although each project within the company may be inherently differ-
ent, the company may wish to have the resulting conflicts resolved in 
the same manner. The four most common methods are:
1.	 The development of company-wide conflict resolution policies and procedures. Many 
companies have attempted to develop company-wide policies and procedures for con-
flict resolution, but this method is often doomed to failure because each project and 
conflict is different. Furthermore, project managers, by virtue of their individuality, and 
sometimes differing amounts of authority and responsibility, prefer to resolve conflicts 
in their own fashion.
2.	 The establishment of project conflict resolution procedures during the early planning 
activities. One method that is often very effective is to “plan” for conflicts during the 
planning activities. This can be accomplished through the use of linear responsibility 
charts. Planning for conflict resolution is similar to the first method except that each 
project manager can develop his or her own policies, rules, and procedures.
3.	 The use of hierarchical referral. In theory, this appears as the best method because 
neither the project manager nor the functional manager will dominate. Under this ar-
rangement, the project and functional managers agree that for a proper balance to exist

The Management of Conflicts
241
their common superior must resolve the conflict to protect the company’s best interest. 
Unfortunately, this is not realistic because the common superior cannot be expected to 
continually resolve lower-level conflicts, and it gives the impression that the functional 
and project managers cannot resolve their own problems.
4.	 The requirement of direct contact. This is direct contact in which conflicting parties meet 
face to face and resolve their disagreement. Unfortunately, this method does not always 
work and, if continually stressed, can result in conditions where individuals will either 
suppress the identification of problems or develop new ones during confrontation.
Many conflicts can be either reduced or eliminated by constant communication of the 
project objectives to the team members. This continual repetition may prevent individuals 
from going too far in the wrong direction.
7.4 THE MANAGEMENT OF CONFLICTS
Good project managers realize that conflicts are inevitable, but that 
good procedures or techniques can help resolve them. Once a conflict 
occurs, the project manager must:
●
●
Study the problem and collect all available information
●
●
Develop a situational approach or methodology
●
●
Set the appropriate atmosphere or climate
If a confrontation meeting is necessary between conflicting parties, then the project 
manager should be aware of the logical steps and sequence of events that should be taken. 
These include:
●
●
Setting the climate: establishing a willingness to participate
●
●
Analyzing the images: how do you see yourself and others, and how do they see you?
●
●
Collecting the information: getting feelings out in the open
●
●
Defining the problem: defining and clarifying all positions
●
●
Sharing the information: making the information available to all
●
●
Setting the appropriate priorities: developing working sessions for setting priori-
ties and timetables
●
●
Organizing the group: forming cross-functional problem-solving groups
●
●
Problem-solving: obtaining cross-functional involvement, securing commitments, 
and setting the priorities and timetable
●
●
Developing the action plan: getting commitment
●
●
Implementing the work: taking action on the plan
●
●
Following up: obtaining feedback on the implementation for the action plan

242
Conflicts 
The project manager or team leader should also understand conflict minimization pro-
cedures. These include:
●
●
Pausing and thinking before reacting
●
●
Building trust
●
●
Trying to understand the conflict motives
●
●
Keeping the meeting under control
●
●
Listening to all involved parties
●
●
Maintaining a give-and-take attitude
●
●
Educating others tactfully on your views
●
●
Being willing to say when you were wrong
●
●
Not acting as a superman and leveling the discussion only once in a while
Thus, the effective manager, in conflict problem-solving situations:
●
●
Knows the organization
●
●
Listens with understanding rather than evaluation
●
●
Clarifies the nature of the conflict
●
●
Understands the feelings of others
●
●
Suggests the procedures for resolving differences
●
●
Maintains relationships with disputing parties
●
●
Facilitates the communications process
●
●
Seeks resolutions
7.5 CONFLICT RESOLUTION MODES
The management of conflicts places the project manager in the 
precarious situation of having to select a conflict resolution mode 
(previously defined in Section 7.3). Based upon the situation, the 
type of conflict, and whom the conflict is with, any of these modes 
could be justified.
PMBOK® Guide, 6th Edition
9.5.2.1 Interpersonal and Team Skills
Confronting (or Collaborating)
With this approach, the conflicting parties meet face to face and try to 
work through their disagreements. This approach should focus more 
on solving the problem and less on being combative. This approach is collaboration and 
integration where both parties need to win. This method should be used:
●
●
When you and the conflicting party can both get at least what you wanted and 
maybe more
●
●
To reduce cost
●
●
To create a common power base
●
●
To attack a common foe
●
●
When skills are complementary

Conflict Resolution Modes
243
●
●
When there is enough time
●
●
When there is trust
●
●
When you have confidence in the other person’s ability
●
●
When the ultimate objective is to learn
Compromising
To compromise is to bargain or to search for solutions so both par-
ties leave with some degree of satisfaction. Compromising is often the 
result of confrontation. Some people argue that compromise is a “give-and-take” approach, 
which leads to a “win-win” position. Others argue that compromise is a “lose-lose” posi-
tion, since neither party gets everything he/she wants or needs. Compromise should be 
used:
●
●
When both parties need to be winners
●
●
When you can’t win
●
●
When others are as strong as you are
●
●
When you haven’t time to win
●
●
To maintain your relationship with your opponent
●
●
When you are not sure you are right
●
●
When you get nothing if you don’t
●
●
When stakes are moderate
●
●
To avoid giving the impression of “fighting”
Smoothing (or  
Accommodating)
Smoothing is an attempt to reduce the emotions that exist in a conflict. 
This is accomplished by emphasizing areas of agreement and deem-
phasizing areas of disagreement. An example of smoothing would be 
to tell someone, “We have agreed on three of the five points and there is no reason why we 
cannot agree on the last two points.” Smoothing does not necessarily resolve a conflict, but 
tries to convince both parties to remain at the bargaining table because a solution is pos-
sible. In smoothing, one may sacrifice one’s own goals in order to satisfy the needs of the 
other party. Smoothing should be used:
●
●
To reach an overarching goal
●
●
To create obligation for a trade-off at a later date
●
●
When the stakes are low
●
●
When liability is limited
●
●
To maintain harmony
●
●
When any solution will be adequate
●
●
To create goodwill (be magnanimous)
●
●
When you’ll lose anyway
●
●
To gain time
Forcing (or Competing,  
Being Assertive)
This is what happens when one party tries to impose the solution on Being 
Uncooperative, the other party. Conflict resolution works best when reso-
lution is achieved at the lowest possible levels. The higher up the conflict 

244
Conflicts 
goes, the greater the tendency for the conflict to be forced, with the result being a “win-lose” 
situation in which one party wins at the expense of the other. Forcing should be used:
●
●
When you are right
●
●
When a do-or-die situation exists
●
●
When stakes are high
●
●
When important principles are at stake
●
●
When you are stronger (never start a battle you can’t win)
●
●
To gain status or to gain power
●
●
In short-term, one-shot deals
●
●
When the relationship is unimportant
●
●
When it’s understood that a game is being played
●
●
When a quick decision must be made
Avoiding (or Withdrawing)
Avoidance is often regarded as a temporary solution to a problem. The 
problem and the resulting conflict can come up again and again. Some 
people view avoiding as cowardice and an unwillingness to be responsive to a situation. 
Avoiding should be used:
●
●
When you can’t win
●
●
When the stakes are low
●
●
When the stakes are high, but you are not ready yet
●
●
To gain time
●
●
To unnerve your opponent
●
●
To preserve neutrality or reputation
●
●
When you think the problem will go away
●
●
When you win by delay
7.6 UNDERSTANDING SUPERIOR, SUBORDINATE,  
AND FUNCTIONAL CONFLICTS
In order for the project manager to be effective, he must understand 
how to work with the various employees who interface with the pro-
ject. These employees include upper-level management, subordinate 
project team members, and functional personnel. Quite often, the project manager must 
demonstrate an ability for continuous adaptability by creating a different working environ-
ment with each group of employees. The need for this was shown in the previous section by 
the fact that the relative intensity of conflicts can vary in the life cycle of a project.
The type and intensity of conflicts can also vary with the type of employee, as shown in 
Figure 7–1. Both conflict causes and sources are rated according to relative conflict intensity.

Understanding Superior, Subordinate, and Functional Conflicts
245
The specific resolution mode a project manager will use might easily depend on whom 
the conflict is with, as shown in Figure 7–2. The data in Figure 7–2 do not necessarily 
show the modes that project managers would prefer, but rather identify the modes that will 
increase or decrease the potential conflict intensity. For example, although project manag-
ers consider, in general, that withdrawal is their least favorite mode, it can be used quite 
effectively with functional managers. In dealing with superiors, project managers would 
rather be ready for an immediate compromise than for face-to-face confrontation that could 
favor upper-level management.
Figure 7–3 identifies the various influence styles that project managers find effective 
in helping to reduce potential conflicts. Penalty power, authority, and expertise are consid-
ered as strongly unfavorable associations with respect to low conflicts. As expected, work 
challenge and promotions (if the project manager has the authority) are strongly favorable.

PROBLEMS
7–1	
Is it possible to establish formal organizational procedures (either at the project level or 
company-wide) for the resolution of conflicts? If a procedure is established, what can go wrong?
7–2	 If a situation occurs that can develop into meaningful conflict, should the project man-
ager let the conflict continue as long as it produces beneficial contributions, or should he try to 
resolve it as soon as possible?
7–3	 For each part below there are two statements; one represents the traditional view and the 
other the project organizational view. Identify each one.
A.	 Conflict should be avoided; conflict is part of change and is therefore inevitable.
B.	 Conflict is the result of troublemakers and egoists; conflict is determined by the struc-
ture of the system and the relationship among components.
C.	 Conflict may be beneficial; conflict is bad.
7–4	 Would you agree or disagree with the statement that “Conflict resolution through collabo-
ration needs trust; people must rely on one another”?
7–5	 Determine the best conflict resolution mode for each of the following situations:
a.	 Two of your functional team members appear to have personality clashes and almost 
always assume opposite points of view during decision making.
b.	 R&D quality control and manufacturing operations quality control continually argue 
as to who should perform testing on an R&D project. R&D postulates that it’s their 
project, and manufacturing argues that it will eventually go into production and that 
they wish to be involved as early as possible.
c.	 Two functional department managers continually argue as to who should perform a 
certain test. You know that this situation exists, and that the department managers are 
trying to work it out themselves, often with great pain. However, you are not sure that 
they will be able to resolve the problem themselves.
7–6	 One of the most common conflicts in an organization occurs with raw materials and 
finished goods. Why would finance/accounting, marketing/sales, and manufacturing have disa-
greements?
7–7	 Explain how the relative intensity of a conflict can vary as a function of:
A.	 Getting closer to the actual constraints
B.	 Having only two constraints instead of three (i.e., time and performance, but not cost)
C.	 The project life cycle
D.	 The person with whom the conflict occurs
FACILITIES SCHEDULING AT MAYER MANUFACTURING
Eddie Turner was elated with the good news that he was being promoted to section supervisor 
in charge of scheduling all activities in the new engineering research laboratory. The new labo-
ratory was a necessity for Mayer Manufacturing. The engineering, manufacturing, and quality 
case Studies

control directorates were all in desperate need of a new testing facility. Upper-level manage-
ment felt that this new facility would alleviate many of the problems that previously existed.
The new organizational structure (as shown in the illustration) required a change in policy 
over use of the laboratory. The new section supervisor, on approval from his department man-
ager, would have full authority for establishing priorities for the use of the new facility. The 
new policy change was a necessity because upper-level management felt that there would be 
inevitable conflict between manufacturing, engineering, and quality control.
After one month of operations, Eddie Turner was finding his job impossible, so Eddie has 
a meeting with Gary Whitehead, his department manager.
Eddie: “I’m having a hell of a time trying to satisfy all of the department managers. If I give 
engineering prime-time use of the facility, then quality control and manufacturing say that I’m 
playing favorites. Imagine that! Even my own people say that I’m playing favorites with other 
directorates. I just can’t satisfy everyone.”
Gary: “Well, Eddie, you know that this problem comes with the job. You’ll get the job done.”
Eddie: “The problem is that I’m a section supervisor and have to work with department 
managers. These department managers look down on me like I’m their servant. If I were a 
department manager, then they’d show me some respect. What I’m really trying to say is that I 
would like you to send out the weekly memos to these department managers telling them of the 
new priorities. They wouldn’t argue with you like they do with me. I can supply you with all the 
necessary information. All you’ll have to do is to sign your name.”
Gary: “Determining the priorities and scheduling the facilities is your job, not mine. This 
is a new position and I want you to handle it. I know you can because I selected you. I do not 
intend to interfere.”
During the next two weeks, the conflicts got progressively worse. Eddie felt that he was un-
able to cope with the situation by himself. The department managers did not respect the author-
ity delegated to him by his superiors. For the next two weeks, Eddie sent memos to Gary in the 
early part of the week asking whether Gary agreed with the priority list. There was no response 
to the two memos. Eddie then met with Gary to discuss the deteriorating situation.
Eddie: “Gary, I’ve sent you two memos to see if I’m doing anything wrong in establishing 
the weekly priorities and schedules. Did you get my memos?”
Gary: “Yes, I received your memos. But as I told you before, I have enough problems to 
worry about without doing your job for you. If you can’t handle the work let me know and I’ll 
find someone who can.”

Eddie returned to his desk and contemplated his situation. Finally, he made a decision.
Next week he was going to put a signature block under his for Gary to sign, with carbon 
copies for all division managers. “Now, let’s see what happens,” remarked Eddie.
QUESTIONS
1.	 What was Eddie’s problem?
2.	 Did Eddie create the problem himself or did others create it for him?
3.	 Was there a failure of project sponsorship or is this the way it typically works in companies?
4.	 Were there better solutions to the conflict, and if so, what are they?
TELESTAR INTERNATIONAL*
On November 15, 2008, the Department of Energy Resources awarded Telestar a $475,000 con-
tract for the developing and testing of two waste treatment plants. Telestar had spent the better 
part of the last two years developing waste treatment technology under its own R&D activities. 
This new contract would give Telestar the opportunity to “break into a new field”—that of waste 
treatment.
The contract was negotiated at a firm-fixed price. Any cost overruns would have to be 
incurred by Telestar. The original bid was priced out at $847,000. Telestar’s management, how-
ever, wanted to win this one. The decision was made that Telestar would “buy in” at $475,000 
so that they could at least get their foot into the new marketplace.
The original estimate of $847,000 was very “rough” because Telestar did not have any 
good man-hour standards, in the area of waste treatment, on which to base their man-hour 
projections. Corporate management was willing to spend up to $400,000 of their own funds in 
order to compensate the bid of $475,000.
By February 15, 2009, costs were increasing to such a point where overrun would be oc-
curring well ahead of schedule. Anticipated costs to completion were now $943,000. The pro-
ject manager decided to stop all activities in certain functional departments, one of which was 
structural analysis. The manager of the structural analysis department strongly opposed the 
closing out of the work order prior to the testing of the first plant’s high-pressure pneumatic and 
electrical systems.
Structures Manager: “You’re running a risk if you close out this work order. How will you 
know if the hardware can withstand the stresses that will be imposed during the test? After all, 
the test is scheduled for next month and I can probably finish the analysis by then.”
Project Manager: “I understand your concern, but I cannot risk a cost overrun. My boss 
expects me to do the work within cost. The plant design is similar to one that we have tested 
before, without any structural problems being detected. On this basis I consider your analysis 
unnecessary.”
Structures Manager: “Just because two plants are similar does not mean that they will be 
identical in performance. There can be major structural deficiencies.”
Project Manager: “I guess the risk is mine.”
Structures Manager: “Yes, but I get concerned when a failure can reflect on the integrity 
of my department. You know, we’re performing on schedule and within the time and money 
budgeted. You’re setting a bad example by cutting off our budget without any real justification.”
Project Manager: “I understand your concern, but we must pull out all the stops when 
overrun costs are inevitable.”
* Revised, 2015.

Structures Manager: “There’s no question in my mind that this analysis should be com-
pleted. However, I’m not going to complete it on my overhead budget. I’ll reassign my people 
tomorrow. Incidentally, you had better be careful; my people are not very happy to work for 
a project that can be canceled immediately. I may have trouble getting volunteers next time.”
Project Manager: “Well, I’m sure you’ll be able to adequately handle any future work. I’ll 
report to my boss that I have issued a work stoppage order to your department.”
During the next month’s test, the plant exploded. Post analysis indicated that the failure 
was due to a structural deficiency.
QUESTIONS
1.	 Who is at fault?
2.	 Should the structures manager have been dedicated enough to continue the work on his 
own?
3.	 Can a functional manager, who considers his organization as strictly support, still be 
dedicated to total project success?
HANDLING CONFLICT IN PROJECT MANAGEMENT
The next several pages contain a six-part case study in conflict management. Read the instructions 
in Appendix A carefully on how to keep score and use the boxes in the table on page 252 as the 
worksheet for recording your choice and the group’s choice; after the case study has been com-
pleted, your instructor will provide you with the proper grading system for recording your scores.
Part 1: Facing the Conflict
As part of his first official duties, the new department manager informs 
you by memo that he has changed his input and output requirements for 
the MIS project (on which you are the project manager) because of several 
complaints by his departmental employees. This is contradictory to the project plan that you de-
veloped with the previous manager and are currently working toward. The department manager 
states that he has already discussed this with the vice president and general manager, a man to 
whom both of you report, and feels that the former department manager made a poor decision 
and did not get sufficient input from the employees who would be using the system as to the best 
system specifications. You telephone him and try to convince him to hold off on his request for 
change until a later time, but he refuses.
Changing the input–output requirements at this point in time will require a major revision 
and will set back total system implementation by three weeks. This will also affect other depart-
ment managers who expect to see this system operational according to the original schedule. 
You can explain this to your superiors, but the increased project costs will be hard to absorb. The 
potential cost overrun might be difficult to explain at a later date.
At this point you are somewhat unhappy with yourself at having been on the search com-
mittee that found this department manager and especially at having recommended him for this 
position. You know that something must be done, and the following are your alternatives:
A.	 You can remind the department manager that you were on the search committee that 
recommended him and then ask him to return the favor, since he “owes you one.”
B.	 You can tell the department manager that you will form a new search committee to 
replace him if he doesn’t change his position.

C.	 You can take a tranquilizer and then ask your people to try to perform the additional 
work within the original time and cost constraints.
D.	 You can go to the vice president and general manager and request that the former re-
quirements be adhered to, at least temporarily.
E.	 You can send a memo to the department manager explaining your problem and asking 
him to help you find a solution.
F.	 You can tell the department manager that your people cannot handle the request and his 
people will have to find alternate ways of solving their problems.
G.	 You can send a memo to the department manager requesting an appointment, at his 
earliest convenience, to help you resolve your problem.
H.	 You can go to the department manager’s office later that afternoon and continue the 
discussion further.
I.	 You can send the department manager a memo telling him that you have decided to use 
the old requirements but will honor his request at a later time.

Although other alternatives exist, assume that these are the only ones open to you at the 
moment. Without discussing the answer with your group, record the letter representing your 
choice in the appropriate space on line 1 of the worksheet under “Personal.”
As soon as all of your group have finished, discuss the problem as a group and determine 
that alternative that the group considers to be best. Record this answer on line 1 of the worksheet 
under “Group.” Allow ten minutes for this part.
Never having worked with this department manager before, you try to pre-
dict what his reactions will be when confronted with the problem. Obvi-
ously, he can react in a variety of ways:
A.	 He can accept your solution in its entirety without asking any questions.
B.	 He can discuss some sort of justification in order to defend his position.
C.	 He can become extremely annoyed with having to discuss the problem again and dem-
onstrate hostility.
Part 2: Understanding  
Emotions

D.	He can demonstrate a willingness to cooperate with you in resolving the problem.
E.	He can avoid making any decision at this time by withdrawing from the discussion.

manager. You tell him that you will have a problem trying to honor his 
request. He tells you that he is too busy with his own problems of restructuring his depart-
ment and that your schedule and cost problems are of no concern to him at this time. You 
storm out of his office, leaving him with the impression that his actions and remarks are not 
in the best interest of either the project or the company. The department manager’s actions 
do not, of course, appear to be those of a dedicated manager. He should be more concerned

about what’s in the best interest of the company. As you contemplate the situation, you 
wonder if you could have received a better response from him had you approached him dif-
ferently. In other words, what is your best approach to opening up communications between 
you and the department manager? From the list of alternatives shown below, and working 
alone, select the alternative that best represents how you would handle this situation. When 
all members of the group have selected their personal choices, repeat the process and make 
a group choice. Record your personal and group choices on line 3 of the worksheet. Allow 
ten minutes for this part.
A.	 Comply with the request and document all results so that you will be able to defend 
yourself at a later date in order to show that the department manager should be held 
accountable.
B.	 Immediately send him a memo reiterating your position and tell him that at a later time 
you will reconsider his new requirements. Tell him that time is of utmost importance, 
and you need an immediate response if he is displeased.
C.	 Send him a memo stating that you are holding him accountable for all cost overruns 
and schedule delays.
D.	 Send him a memo stating you are considering his request and that you plan to see him 
again at a later date to discuss changing the requirements.
E.	 See him as soon as possible. Tell him that he need not apologize for his remarks 
and actions, and that you have reconsidered your position and wish to discuss it 
with him.
F.	 Delay talking to him for a few days in hopes that he will cool off sufficiently and then 
see him in hopes that you can reopen the discussions.
G.	 Wait a day or so for everyone to cool off and then try to see him through an appoint-
ment; apologize for losing your temper, and ask him if he would like to help you 
resolve the problem.
Part 4: Conflict  
Resolution Modes
Having never worked with this manager before, you are unsure about 
which conflict resolution mode would work best. You decide to wait a 
few days and then set up an appointment with the department manager 
without stating what subject matter will be discussed. You then try to determine what con-
flict resolution mode appears to be dominant based on the opening remarks of the depart-
ment manager. Neglecting the fact that your conversation with the department manager 
might already be considered as confrontation, for each statement shown below, select the 
conflict resolution mode that the department manager appears to prefer. After each mem-
ber of the group has recorded his personal choices in the table below, determine the group 
choices. Numerical values will be attached to your answers at a later time. Allow ten min-

F.	 You can try to build up friendships and off-work relationships with these people and 
rely on referent power.

8.1 PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT
A good project manager will make it immediately clear to all new 
functional employees that, if they perform well in the project, then 
he or she (the project manager) will inform the functional manager of 
their progress and achievements.

This assumes that the functional manager is not providing close supervision over the 
functional employees and is, instead, passing on some of the responsibility to the project 
manager—a common situation in project management organization structures.
Many good projects, as well as project management structures, have failed because of 
the inability of the system to evaluate properly the functional employee’s performance. In 
a project management structure, there are basically six ways that a functional employee can 
be evaluated on a project:
●
●
The project manager prepares a written, confidential evaluation and gives it to 
the functional manager. The functional manager will evaluate the validity of the 
project manager’s comments and prepare his or her own evaluation. Only the line 
manager’s evaluation is shown to the employee. The use of confidential forms is 
not preferred because it may be contrary to government regulations and it does not 
provide the feedback necessary for an employee to improve.
●
●
The project manager prepares a nonconfidential evaluation and gives it to the 
functional manager. The functional manager prepares his or her own evaluation 
form and shows both evaluations to the functional employee. This is the technique 
preferred by most project and functional managers. However, there are several 
major difficulties with this technique. If the functional employee is an average or 
below-average worker, and if this employee is still to be assigned to that project 
after his or her evaluation, then the project manager might rate the employee as 
above average simply to prevent any sabotage or bad feelings downstream. In this 
situation, the functional manager might want a confidential evaluation instead, 
knowing that the functional employee will see both evaluation forms. Functional 
employees tend to blame the project manager if they receive a below-average 
merit pay increase, but give credit to the functional manager if the increase is 
above average. The best bet here is for the project manager periodically to tell 
the functional employees how well they are doing, and to give them an honest 
appraisal. Several companies that use this technique allow the project manager 
to show the form to the line manager first (to avoid conflict later) and then show 
it to the employee.
●
●
The project manager provides the functional manager with an oral evaluation of 
the employee’s performance. Although this technique is commonly used, most 
functional managers prefer documentation on employee progress. Again, lack of 
feedback may prevent the employee from improving.
●
●
The functional manager makes the entire evaluation without any input from the 
project manager. In order for this technique to be effective, the functional man-
ager must have sufficient time to supervise each subordinate’s performance on a 
continual basis. Unfortunately, most functional managers do not have this luxury 
because of their broad span of control and must therefore rely heavily on the pro-
ject manager’s input.
●
●
The project manager makes the entire evaluation for the functional manager. This 
technique can work if the functional employee spends 100 percent of his time 
on one project, or if he is physically located at a remote site where he cannot be 
observed by his functional manager.

Performance Measurement
259
●
●
All project and functional managers jointly evaluate all project functional employ-
ees at the same time. This technique should be limited to small companies with 
fewer than fifty or so employees; otherwise the evaluation process might be time-
consuming for key personnel. A bad evaluation will be known by everyone.
Figure 8–1 represents, in a humorous way, how project personnel perceive the evalua-
tion form. Unfortunately, the evaluation process is very serious and can easily have a severe 
impact on an individual’s career path with the company even though the final evaluation 
rests with the functional manager.
Figure 8–2 shows a simple type of evaluation form on which the project manager iden-
tifies the best description of the employee’s performance. This type of form is generally 
used whenever the employee is up for evaluation.
Figure 8–3 shows another typical form that can be used to evaluate an employee. 
In each category, the employee is rated on a subjective scale. In order to minimize time 
and paperwork, it is also possible to have a single evaluation form at project termination 
for evaluation of all employees. This is shown in Figure 8–4. All employees are rated in 
each category on a scale of 1 to 5. Totals are obtained to provide a relative comparison of 
employees.
Obviously, evaluation forms such as that shown in Figure 8–4 have severe limita-
tions, as a one-to-one comparison of all project functional personnel is of little value if the

employees are from different departments. How can a project engineer be compared to a 
cost accountant?
Even though the project manager fills out an evaluation form, there is no guarantee 
that the functional manager will believe the project manager’s evaluation. There are always 
situations in which the project and functional managers disagree as to either quality or 
direction of work.
Another problem may exist in the situation where the project manager is a “generalist,” 
say at a grade-7 level, and requests that the functional manager assign his best employee 
to the project. The functional manager agrees to the request and assigns his best employee, 
a grade-10 specialist. One solution to this problem is to have the project manager evaluate 
the expert only in certain categories such as communications, work habits, and problem 
solving, but not in the area of his technical expertise.
As a final note, it is sometimes argued that functional employees should have some 
sort of indirect input into a project manager’s evaluation. This raises rather interesting 
questions as to how far we can go with the indirect evaluation procedure.

Special Topics 
From a top-management perspective, the indirect evaluation process brings with it 
several headaches. Wage and salary administrators readily accept the necessity for using 
different evaluation forms for white-collar and blue-collar workers. But now, we have a 
situation in which there can be more than one type of evaluation system for white-collar 
workers alone. Those employees who work in project-driven functional departments will 
be evaluated directly and indirectly, but based on formal procedures. Employees who 
charge their time to overhead accounts and non–project-driven departments might simply 
be evaluated by a single, direct evaluation procedure.
Many wage and salary administrators contend that they cannot live with a white-collar 
evaluation system and therefore have tried to combine the direct and indirect evaluation 
forms into one, as shown in Figure 8–5. Some administrators have even gone so far as to 
adopt a single form company-wide, regardless of whether an individual is a white- or blue-
collar worker.
8.2 FINANCIAL COMPENSATION AND REWARDS
Proper financial compensation and rewards are important to the 
morale and motivation of people in any organization. However, 
there are several issues that often make it necessary to treat com-
pensation practices of project personnel separately from the rest of 
the organization:
●
●
Job classification and job descriptions for project personnel are usually not com-
patible with those existing for other professional jobs. It is often difficult to pick 
an existing classification and adapt it to project personnel. Without proper adjust-
ment, the small amount of formal authority of the project and the small number of 
direct reports may distort the position level of project personnel in spite of their 
broad range of business responsibilities.
●
●
Dual accountability and dual reporting relationships of project personnel raise the 
question of who should assess performance and control the rewards.
●
●
Bases for financial rewards are often difficult to establish, quantify, and adminis-
ter. The criteria for “doing a good job” are difficult to quantify.
●
●
Special compensations for overtime, extensive travel, or living away from home 
should be considered in addition to bonus pay for preestablished results. Bonus 
pay is a particularly difficult and delicate issue because often many people contrib-
ute to the results of such incentives. Discretionary bonus practices can be demoral-
izing to the project team.
Some specific guidelines are provided here to help managers establish compensation 
systems for their project organizations. The foundations of these compensation practices 
are based on four systems: (1) job classification, (2) base pay, (3) performance appraisals, 
and (4) merit increases.

Table 8–1.  Sample Job Description
Job Description: Lead Project
Engineer of Processor Development
Overall Responsibility
Responsible for directing the technical development of the new Central Processor including managing the 
technical personnel assigned to this development. The Lead Project Engineer has dual responsibility: (1) to his/
her functional superior for the technical implementation and engineering quality and (2) to the project manager 
for managing the development within the established budget and schedule.
Specific Duties and Responsibilities
1. Provide necessary program direction for planning, organizing, developing, and integrating the engineering 
effort, including establishing the specific objectives, schedules, and budgets for the processor subsystem.
2. Provide technical leadership for analyzing and establishing requirements, preliminary designing, designing, 
prototyping, and testing of the processor subsystem.
3. Divide the work into discrete and clearly definable tasks. Assign tasks to technical personnel within the Lead 
Engineer’s area of responsibility and other organizational units.
4. Define, negotiate, and allocate budgets and schedules according to the specific tasks and overall program 
requirements.
5. Measure and control cost, schedule, and technical performance against program plan.
6. Report deviations from program plan to program office.
7. Replan trade-off and redirect the development effort in case of contingencies such as to best utilize the 
available resources toward the overall program objectives.
8. Plan, maintain, and utilize engineering facilities to meet the long-range program requirements.
Qualifications
1. Strong technical background in state-of-the-art central processor development.
2. Prior task management experience with proven record for effective cost and schedule control of 
multidisciplinary technology-based task in excess of SIM.
3. Personal skills to lead, direct, and motivate senior engineering personnel.
4. Excellent communication skills, both orally and in writing.
1.  In most organizations the title of task manager indicates responsibility for managing the technical content of a 
project subsystem within a functional unit, having dual accountabilities to the functional superior and the project 
office.
Every effort should be made to fit the new classifications for project 
personnel into the existing standard classification that has already been 
established for the organization.
The first step is to define job titles for various project personnel and their corresponding 
responsibilities. Titles are noteworthy because they imply certain responsibilities, position 
power, organizational status, and pay level. Furthermore, titles may indicate certain func-
tional responsibilities, as does, for example, the title of task manager.1 Therefore, titles should 
be carefully selected and each of them should be supported by a formal job description.
The job description provides the basic charter for the job and the individual in charge 
of it. A good job description is brief and concise, not exceeding one page. Typically, it is 
broken down into three sections: (1) overall responsibilities, (2) specific duties, and (3) 
qualifications. A sample job description is given in Table 8–1.
Job Classifications and Job 
Descriptions

Financial Compensation and Rewards
265
After the job descriptions have been developed, one can delineate pay 
classes consistent with the responsibilities and accountabilities for busi-
ness results. If left to the personnel specialist, these pay scales may slip toward the lower end 
of an equitable compensation. This is understandable because, on the surface, project posi-
tions look less senior than their functional counterparts, as formal authority over resources 
and direct reports is often less necessary for project positions than for traditional functional 
positions. The impact of such a skewed compensation system is that the project organization 
will attract less qualified personnel and may be seen as an inferior career path.
Many companies that have struggled with this problem have solved it by (1) working 
out compensation schemes as a team of senior managers and personnel specialists, and  
(2) applying criteria of responsibility and business/profit accountability to setting pay scales 
for project personnel in accord with other jobs in their organization. Managers who are hir-
ing can choose a salary from the established range based on their judgment of actual position 
responsibilities, the candidate’s qualifications, the available budget, and other considerations.
Base-Pay Classifications 
and Incentives
Performance Appraisals
Traditionally, the purpose of the performance appraisal is to:
●
●
Assess the employee’s work performance, preferably against preestablished objec-
tives
●
●
Provide a justification for salary actions
●
●
Establish new goals and objectives for the next review period
●
●
Identify and deal with work-related problems
●
●
Serve as a basis for career discussions
In reality, however, the first two objectives are in conflict. As a result, traditional per-
formance appraisals essentially become a salary discussion with the objective to justify 
subsequent managerial actions. In addition, discussions dominated by salary actions are 
usually not conducive to future goal setting, problem solving, or career planning.
In order to get around this dilemma, many companies have separated the salary dis-
cussion from the other parts of the performance appraisal. Moreover, successful manag-
ers have carefully considered the complex issues involved and have built a performance 
appraisal system solidly based on content, measurability, and source of information.
The first challenge is in content, that is, to decide “what to review” and “how to meas-
ure performance.” Modern management practices try to individualize accountability as 
much as possible. Furthermore, subsequent incentive or merit increases are tied to profit 
performance. Although most companies apply these principles to their project organiza-
tions, they do it with a great deal of skepticism. Practices are often modified to assure 
balance and equity for jointly performed responsibilities. A similar dilemma exists in the 
area of profit accountability. Acknowledging the realities, organizations are measuring per-
formance of their project managers, in at least two areas:
●

Managerial performance as measured by overall project management effective-
ness, organization, direction and leadership, and team performance
The first area applies only if the project manager is indeed responsible for business 
results such as contractual performance or new business acquisitions. Many project 
managers work with company-internal sponsors, for example, on a company-internal 
new product development or a feasibility study. In these cases, producing the results 
within agreed-on schedule and budget constraints becomes the primary measure of 
performance. The second area is clearly more difficult to assess. Moreover, if handled 
improperly, it will lead to manipulation and game playing. Table 8–2 provides some spe-
cific measures of project management performance. Whether the sponsor is company- 
internal or external, project managers are usually being assessed on how long it took 
to organize the team, whether the project is moving along according to agreed-on 
schedules and budgets, and how closely they meet the global goals and objectives set 
by their superiors.
On the other side of the project organization, resource managers or project person-
nel are being assessed primarily on their ability to direct the implementation of a specific 
project subsystem:
●
●
Technical implementation as measured against requirements, quality, schedules, 
and cost targets
●
●
Team performance as measured by ability to staff, build an effective task group, 
interface with other groups, and integrate among various functions

Table 8–2.  Performance Measures for Project  
Managers (Continued)
Specific performance measures are shown in Table 8–3. In addition, the actual project 
performance of both project managers and their resource personnel should be assessed on 
the conditions under which it was achieved: the degree of task difficulty, complexity, size, 
changes, and general business conditions.
Finally, one needs to decide who is to perform the performance appraisal and to 
make the salary adjustment. Where dual accountabilities are involved, good practices 
call for inputs from both bosses. Such a situation could exist for project managers who 
report functionally to one superior but are also accountable for specific business results 
to another person. While dual accountability of project managers is an exception for most 
organizations, it is common for project resource personnel who are responsible to their 
functional superior for the quality of the work and to their project manager for meeting the

requirements within budget and schedule. Moreover, resource personnel may be shared 
among many projects. Only the functional or resource manager can judge overall perfor-
mance of resource personnel.
Merit Increases, Bonuses, and 
Incentive Plans
Under inflationary conditions, pay adjustments seldom keep up with 
cost-of-living increases. To deal with this salary compression and to 
give incentive for management performance, many companies have 
introduced bonus structures. The problem is that standard plans for 
merit increases and bonuses are based on individual accountability 
while project personnel work in teams with shared accountabilities, 
responsibilities, and controls. It is usually very difficult to credit project success or failure 
to a single individual or a small group.
Most managers with these dilemmas have turned to the traditional remedy of the per-
formance appraisal. If done well, the appraisal should provide particular measures of job 
performance that assess the level and magnitude at which the individual has contributed 
to the success of the project, including the managerial performance and team performance 
components. Therefore, a properly designed and executed performance appraisal that 
includes input from all accountable management elements, and the basic agreement of the 
employee with the conclusions, is a sound basis for future salary reviews.
Project team incentives are important because team members expect appropriate 
rewards and recognition for work well done. These incentive plans usually have some 
combination of these basic measures:
●
●
Project Milestones: Hit a milestone, on budget and on time, and all team members 
earn a defined amount. Although sound in theory, there are inherent problems in 
tying financial incentives to hitting milestones. Milestones often change for good 
reason (technological advances, market shifts, other developments) and you don’t 
want the team and management to get into a negotiation on slipping dates to trig-
ger the incentive. Unless milestones are set in stone and reaching them is simply 
a function of the team doing its normal, everyday job, it’s generally best to use 
recognition-after-the-fact celebration of reaching milestones—rather than tying 
financial incentives to it.
●
●
Rewards need not always be time-based, such that when the team hits a milestone 
by a certain date it earns a reward. If, for example, a product development team 
debugs a new piece of software on time, that’s not necessarily a reason to reward it. 
But if it discovers and solves an unsuspected problem or writes better code before 
a delivery date, rewards are due.
●
●
Project Completion: All team members earn a defined amount when they complete 
the project on budget and on time (or to the team champion’s quality standards).
●
●
Value Added: This award is a function of the value added by a project, and depends 
largely on the ability of the organization to create and track objective measures. 
Examples include reduced turnaround time on customer requests, improved cycle 
times for product development, cost savings due to new process efficiencies, or 
incremental profit or market share created by the product or service developed or 
implemented by the project team.

8.3 EFFECTIVE PROJECT MANAGEMENT IN THE SMALL  
BUSINESS ORGANIZATION
Here, we are discussing project management in both small companies and small organi-
zations within a larger corporation. In small organizations, major differences from large 
companies must be accounted for:
●
●In small companies, the project manager has to wear multiple hats and may have 
to act as a project manager and line manager at the same time. Large companies may 
have the luxury of a single full-time project manager for the duration of a project. Smaller 
companies may not be able to afford a full-time project manager and therefore may 
require that functional managers wear two hats. This poses a problem in that the func-
tional managers may be more dedicated to their own functional unit than to the project, 
and the project may suffer. There is also the risk that when the line manager also acts as 
project manager, the line manager may keep the best resources for his own project. The 
line manager’s project may be a success at the expense of all the other projects that he 
must supply resources for.
In the ideal situation, the project manager works horizontally and has project dedica-
tion, whereas the line manager works vertically and has functional (or company) dedica-
tion. If the working relationship between the project and functional managers is a good 
one, then decisions will be made in a manner that is in the best interest of both the project 
and the company. Unfortunately, this may be difficult to accomplish in small companies 
when an individual wears multiple hats.
●
●In a small company, the project manager handles multiple projects, perhaps 
each with a different priority. In large companies, project managers normally handle 
only one project at a time. Handling multiple projects becomes a serious problem 
if the priorities are not close together. For this reason, many small companies avoid 
the establishment of priorities for fear that the lower-priority activities will never be 
accomplished.
●
●In a small company, the project manager has limited resources. In a large com-
pany, if the project manager is unhappy with resources that are provided, he may have 
the luxury of returning to the functional manager to either demand or negotiate for 
other resources. In a small organization, the resources assigned may be simply the only 
resources available.
●
●In a small company, project managers must generally have a better understand-
ing of interpersonal skills than in a larger company. This is a necessity because a project 
manager in the small company has limited resources and must provide the best motivation 
that he can.
●
●In the smaller company, the project manager generally has shorter lines of com-
munications. In small organizations project managers almost always report to a top-level 
executive, whereas in larger organizations the project managers can report to any level of 
management. Small companies tend to have fewer levels of management.
●
●Small companies do not have a project office. Large companies, especially in 
aerospace or construction, can easily support a project office of twenty to thirty people, 
whereas in the smaller company the project manager may have to be the entire project 

Mega Projects
271
office. This implies that the project manager in a small company may be required to have 
more general and specific information about all company activities, policies, and proce-
dures than his counterparts in the larger companies.
●
●In a small company, there may be a much greater risk to the total company with 
the failure of as little as one project. Large companies may be able to afford the loss of 
a multimillion-dollar program, whereas the smaller company may be in serious financial 
trouble. Thus many smaller companies avoid bidding on projects that would necessitate 
hiring additional resources or giving up some of its smaller accounts.
●
●In a small company, there might be tighter monetary controls but with less sophisti-
cated control techniques. Because the smaller company incurs greater risk with the failure 
(or cost overrun) of as little as one project, costs are generally controlled much more tightly 
and more frequently than in larger companies. However, smaller companies generally rely 
on manual or partially computerized systems, whereas larger organizations rely heavily on 
sophisticated software packages.
●
●In a small company, there is usually more upper-level management interference. 
This is expected because in the small company there is a much greater risk with the fail-
ure of a single project. In addition, executives in smaller companies “meddle” more than 
executives in larger companies, and quite often delegate as little as possible to project 
managers.
●
●Evaluation procedures for individuals are usually easier in a smaller company. 
This holds true because the project manager gets to know the people better, and, as stated 
above, there exists a greater need for interpersonal skills on the horizontal line in a smaller 
company.
●
●In a smaller company, project estimating is usually more precise and based on 
either history or standards. This type of planning process is usually manual as opposed 
to computerized. In addition, functional managers in a small company usually feel obli-
gated to live up to their commitments, whereas in larger companies, much more lip ser-
vice is given.
8.4 MEGA PROJECTS
Mega projects may have a different set of rules and guidelines from those of smaller pro-
jects. For example, in large projects:
●
●
Vast numbers of people may be required, often for short or intense periods of time.
●
●
Continuous organizational restructuring may be necessary as each project goes 
through a different life-cycle phase.
●
●
The matrix and project organizational form may be used interchangeably.
The following elements are critical for success.
●
●
Training in project management
●
●
Rules and procedures clearly defined

23.	 Systems methodology complexity
24.	 Environmental impact
25.	 Collaborative contracting, integration 
and partnering
Many companies dream of winning mega project contracts only to find disaster rather 
than a pot of gold. Perhaps the most common difficulty in managing mega projects stems 
mainly from resource restraints:
●
●
Lack of available on-site workers (or local labor forces)
●
●
Lack of skilled workers
●
●
Lack of properly trained on-site supervision
●
●
Lack of raw materials
As a result of such problems, the company immediately assigns its best employees to 
the mega project, thus creating severe risks for the smaller projects, many of which could 
lead to substantial follow-on business. Overtime is usually required, on a prolonged basis, 
and this results in lower efficiency and unhappy employees.
As the project schedule slips, management hires additional home-office personnel to 
support the project. By the time that the project is finished, the total organization is over-
staffed, many smaller customers have taken their business elsewhere, and the company

273
finds itself in the position of needing another mega project in order to survive and support 
the existing staff.
Mega projects are not always as glorious as people think they are. Organizational 
stability, accompanied by a moderate growth rate, may be more important than quantum 
steps to mega projects. The lesson here is that mega projects should be left to those com-
panies that have the facilities, expertise, resources, and management know-how to handle 
the situation.
8.5 MORALITY, ETHICS, AND THE CORPORATE CULTURE
Companies that promote morality and ethics in business usually 
have an easier time developing a cooperative culture than those 
that encourage unethical or immoral behavior. The adversity gener-
ated by unethical acts can be either internally or externally driven. 
Internally driven adversity occurs when employees or managers 
in your own company ask you to take action that may be in the 
best interest of your company but violates your own moral and ethical beliefs. Typical 
examples might include:
You are asked to lie to the customer in a proposal in order to win the contract.
You are asked to withhold bad news from your own management.
You are asked to withhold bad news from the customer.
You are instructed to ship a potentially defective unit to the customer in order to main-
tain production quotas.
You are ordered to violate ethical accounting practices to make your numbers “look 
good” for senior management.
You are asked to cover up acts of embezzlement or use the wrong charge numbers.
You are asked to violate the confidence of a private personal decision by a team member.
External adversity occurs when your customers ask you to take action that may be in 
the customer’s best interest (and possibly your company’s best interest), but once again 
violates your personal moral and ethical beliefs. Typical examples might include:
You are asked to hide or destroy information that could be damaging to the customer 
during legal action against your customer.
You are asked to lie to consumers to help maintain your customer’s public image.
You are asked to release unreliable information that would be damaging to one of your 
customer’s competitors.
The customer’s project manager asks you to lie in your proposal so that he/she will 
have an easier time in approving contract award.

Special Topics 
Project managers are often placed in positions where an action must be taken for the 
best interest of the company and its customers, and yet the same action could be upsetting 
to the workers. Consider the following example as a positive way to handle this:
A project had a delivery date where a specific number of completed units had to be 
on the firm’s biggest customer’s receiving dock by January 5. This customer represented 
30% of the firm’s sales and 33% of its profits. Because of product development problems 
and slippages, the project could not be completed early. The employees, many of whom 
were exempt, were informed that they would be expected to work 12-hour days, includ-
ing Christmas and New Year’s, to maintain the schedule. The project manager worked the 
same hours as his manufacturing team and was visible to all. The company allowed family 
members to visit the workers during the lunch and dinner hours during this period. After 
delivery was accomplished, the project manager arranged for all of the team members to 
receive two weeks of paid time off. At completion of the project, the team members were 
volunteering to work again for this project manager.
The project manager realized that asking his team to work these days might be viewed 
as immoral. Yet, because he also worked, his behavior reinforced the importance of meet-
ing the schedule. The project manager’s actions actually strengthened the cooperative 
nature of the culture within the firm.
Not all changes are in the best interest of both the company and the workers. Some-
times change is needed simply to survive, and this could force employees to depart from 
their comfort zones. The employees might even view the change as immoral. Consider the 
following example:
Because of a recession, a machine tool company switched from a non–project-driven 
to a project-driven company. Management recognized the change and tried to convince 
employees that customers now wanted specialty products rather than standard products, 
and that the survival of the firm might be at stake. The company hired a project manage-
ment consulting company to help bring in project management since the business was now 
project-driven. The employees vigorously resisted both the change and the training with 
the mistaken belief that, once the recession ended, the customers would once again want 
the standard, off-the-shelf products and that project management was a waste of time. The 
company is no longer in business and, as the employees walked out of the plant for the last 
time, they blamed project management for the loss of employment.
Some companies develop “standard practice manuals,” which describe in detail what 
is meant by ethical conduct in dealing with customers and suppliers. Yet, even with the 
existence of these manuals, well-meaning individuals may create unintended consequences 
that wreak havoc. Consider the following example:
The executive project sponsor on a government-funded R&D project decided to 
“massage” the raw data to make the numbers look better before presenting the data to a 
customer. When the customer realized what had happened, their relationship, which had 
been based upon trust and open communications, became based upon mistrust and for-
mal documentation. The entire project team suffered because of the self-serving conduct 
of one executive.
Sometimes, project managers find themselves in situations where the outcome most 
likely will be a win-lose position rather than a win-win situation. Consider the following 
three situations:

Professional Responsibilities
275
An assistant project manager, Mary, had the opportunity to be promoted and manage a 
new large project that was about to begin. She needed her manager’s permission to accept 
the new assignment, but if she left, her manager would have to perform her work in addi-
tion to his own for at least three months. The project manager refused to release her, and the 
project manager developed a reputation of preventing people from being promoted while 
working on his projects.
In the first month of a twelve-month project, the project manager realized that the end 
date was optimistic, but he purposely withheld information from the customer in hopes 
that a miracle would occur. Ten months later, the project manager was still withholding 
information, waiting for the miracle. In the eleventh month, the customer was told the truth. 
People then labeled the project manager as an individual who would rather lie than tell the 
truth because it was easier.
To maintain the customer’s schedule, the project manager demanded that employees 
work excessive overtime, knowing that this often led to more mistakes. The company fired 
a tired worker who inadvertently withdrew the wrong raw materials from inventory, result-
ing in a $55,000 manufacturing mistake.
In all three situations, the project manager believed that his decision was in the best 
interest of the company at that time. Yet the final result in each case was that the project 
manager was labeled unethical or immoral.
It is often said that “money is the root of all evil.” Sometimes companies believe that 
recognizing the achievements of an individual through a financial reward system is appro-
priate without considering the impact on the culture. Consider the following example:
At the end of a highly successful project, the project manager was promoted, and given 
a $5,000 bonus and a paid vacation. The team members who were key to the project’s suc-
cess, and who earned minimum wage, went to a fast food restaurant to celebrate their con-
tribution to the firm and their support of each other. The project manager celebrated alone.
The company failed to recognize that project management is a team effort. The work-
ers viewed management’s reward policy as immoral and unethical because the project man-
ager was successful due to the efforts of the entire team.
Moral and ethical conduct by project managers, project sponsors, and line managers 
can improve the corporate culture. Likewise, poor decisions can destroy a culture, often in 
much less time than it took for the culture to be developed.
8.6 PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES
Professional responsibilities for project managers have become 
increa­singly important because of the unfavorable publicity on some 
of the dealings of corporate America. These have been with us for 
some time, especially in dealing with government agencies. Profes-
sional responsibilities for a project manager are both broad-based and 
encompassing.
Professional responsibilities cover two major areas: our responsibilities to the profes-
sion of project management and our responsibilities to the customers and the public.
PMBOK® Guide, 6th Edition
Professional Responsibilities; The 
PMP® Code of Conduct
1.1.3 Code of Ethics and Professional 
Conduct

276
Special Topics 
In 2010, PMI released the finding of the latest version of the Role Delineation Study 
(RDS). In addition, PMI updated its Code of Professional Conduct and renamed it the Code 
of Ethics and Professional Conduct. PMI has also eliminated the Professional Responsibility 
Domain Area from the PMP® exam and included the professional responsibility questions 
in the other domain areas where appropriate.
The PMI® Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct applies to everyone working in a 
project environment, not merely the project manager. Therefore, the code emphasizes that 
PMP credential holders must function as “role models” and exhibit characteristics such as 
honesty, integrity, and ethical behavior. The code guides members of the project management 
profession on how to handle ethical issues as well as providing customers and stakeholders 
with some degree of assuredness that project personnel will make the right decisions.
The Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct is divided into four sections:
●
●
Responsibility: This includes taking ownership for the decisions we make, or fail-
ure to make decisions, as well as the consequences, whether they are good or bad.
●
●
Respect: This includes the way we regard ourselves as well as the resources pro-
vided to us.
●
●
Fairness: This focuses on the way we make decisions. Decisions should be made 
in an impartial and objective manner and be free from conflicts of interest, favorit-
ism, and prejudices.
●
●
Honesty: This states that we should act in a truthful manner.
Each of the four sections includes both aspirational standards and mandatory stand-
ards. An aspirational standard is an agreed-upon, repeatable way of doing something. It 
can be a published document designed to be used consistently as a general rule, guideline, 
or definition. Aspirational standards are often a summary of good and best practices rather 
than general practices. Although we tend to say that abiding by aspirational standards is not 
optional, the aspirational standards are actually designed for voluntary use in the way that 
they are acted upon and may not impose any regulations. However, laws and regulations 
may refer to certain aspirational standards and make compliance with them compulsory.
There are numerous situations that can create problems for project managers in deal-
ing with professional responsibilities expectations. These situations include:
●
●
Maintaining professional integrity
●
●
Adhering to ethical standards
●
●
Recognizing diversity
●
●
Avoiding/reporting conflicts of interest
●
●
Not making project decisions for personal gains

●
●

●
●

●
●

Several of these topics are explained below.
Conflict of Interest
A conflict of interest is a situation where the individual is placed in a 
compromising position where the individual can gain personally based 
upon the decisions made. This is also referred to as personal enrichment. There are numer-
ous situations where a project manager is placed in such a position. Examples include:
●
●
Insider knowledge that the stock will be going up or down
●
●
Being asked to improperly allow employees to use charge numbers on your project 
even though they are not working on your project
●
●
Receiving or giving inappropriate (by dollar value) gifts
●
●
Receiving unjustified compensation or kickbacks
●
●
Providing the customer with false information just to keep the project alive
Project managers are expected to abide by the PMI® Code of Professional Conduct, 
which makes it clear that project managers should conduct themselves in an ethical man-
ner. Unjust compensation or gains not only are frowned upon but are unacceptable. Unless 
these conflict-of-interest situations are understood, the legitimate interests of both the cus-
tomer and the company may not be forthcoming.
Inappropriate Connections
Not all stakeholders are equal in their ability to influence the decisions 
made by the project manager. Some stakeholders can provide inappro-
priate influence/compensation, such as:
●
●
A loan with a very low interest rate
●
●
Ability to purchase a product/service at a price that may appear equivalent to a gift
●
●
Ability to receive free gifts such as airline tickets, tickets to athletic events, free 
meals and entertainment, or even cash
Another form of inappropriate connections can occur with family or friends. These 
individuals may provide you with information or influence by which you could gain per-
sonally in a business situation. Examples of affiliation connections might be:
●
●
Receiving insider information
●
●
Receiving privileged information
●
●
Opening doors that you could not open by yourself, at least without some difficulty

278
Special Topics 
Today, all companies have rules concerning the acceptance of gifts and 
their disclosure. While it may be customary in some countries to give 
or accept gifts, the standard rule is usually to avoid all gifts. Some companies may stipulate 
limits on when gifts are permitted and the appropriateness of the gift. The gifts might be 
cash, free meals, or other such items.
Acceptance of Gifts
Responsibility to Your Company 
(and Stakeholders)
Companies today, more than ever before, are under pressure to main-
tain ethical practices with customers and suppliers. This could be 
interpreted as a company code of ethics that stipulates the professional behavior expected 
from the project manager and the team members. This applies specifically to the actions 
of both the project manager as well as the team members. Some companies even go so far 
as to develop “standard practice manuals” on how to act in a professional manner. Typical 
sections of such manuals might be:
●
●
Truthful representation of all information
●
●
Full disclosure of all information
●
●
Protection of company-proprietary information
●
●
Responsibility to report violations
●
●
Full compliance with groups auditing violations
●
●
Full disclosure, and in a timely manner, of all conflicts of interest
●
●
Ensure that all of the team members abide by the above items
8.7 INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL PARTNERSHIPS
A partnership is a group of two or more individuals working together to achieve a common 
objective. In project management, maintaining excellent, working relations with internal 
partners is essential. Internally, the critical relationship is between the project and line 
manager.
In the early days of project management, the selection of the individual to serve as the 
project manager was most often dependent upon who possessed the greatest command of 
technology. The result was a very poor working relationship between the project and line 
manager.
As the magnitude and technical complexity of the projects grew, it became obvious 
that the project managers could not maintain a command of technology in all aspects of 
the project.
As the partnership between the project and line managers developed, management 
recognized that partnerships worked best on a peer-to-peer basis. Project and line man-
agers began to view each other as equals and share in the authority, responsibility, and 
accountability needed to ensure project success. Good project management methodologies 
emphasize the cooperative working relationship that must exist between the project and 
line managers.

Training and Education
279
Project management methodologies also emphasize the work-
ing relationships with external organizations such as suppliers. 
Outsourcing has become a major trend because it allows compa-
nies to bring their products and services to the market faster and 
often at a more competitive price. Therefore, external partnerships 
can be beneficial for both the suppliers and the customers. If pro­
perly managed, they can provide significant long-term benefits to 
both the customer and supplier.
8.8 TRAINING AND EDUCATION
Given that most companies use the same basic tools as part of their methodology, what 
makes one company better than another? The answer lies in the execution of the method-
ology. Training and education can accelerate not only the project management maturity 
process but also the ability to execute the methodology.
Actual learning takes place in three areas, as shown in Figure 8–6: on-the-job expe-
rience, education, and knowledge transfer. Ideal project management knowledge would 
be obtained by allowing each employee to be educated on the results of the company’s 
lessons-learned studies, including risk management, benchmarking, and continuous 
improvement efforts. Unfortunately, this is rarely done and ideal learning is hardly 
ever reached. To make matters worse, actual learning is less than most people believe 
because of lost knowledge. This lost knowledge is shown in Figure 8–7 and will occur 
even in companies that maintain low employee turnover ratios. These two figures also 
illustrate the importance of maintaining the same personnel on the project for the dura-
tion of the effort.
Companies often find themselves in a position of having to provide a key initiative for 
a multitude of people, or simply specialized training to a program team about to embark

upon a new long-term effort. In such cases, specialized training is required, with targeted 
goals and results that are specifically planned for. The elements common to training on a 
key initiative or practice include3:
●
●
A front-end analysis of the program team’s needs and training requirements
●
●
Involvement of the program teams in key decisions
●
●
Customized training to meet program team’s specific needs
●
●
Targeted training for the implementation of specific practices
●
●
Improved training outcomes, including better course depth, timeliness, and reach
The front-end analysis is used to determine the needs and requirements of the program 
office implementing the practice. The analysis is also used to identify and address barriers 
each program office faces when implementing new practices. According to the director of 
the benchmarking forum for the American Society of Training and Development, this type of 
analysis is crucial for an organization to be able to institute performance-improving measures. 
Using information from the front-end analysis, the training organizations customize the train-
ing to ensure that it directly assists program teams in implementing new practices. To ensure 
that the training will address the needs of the program teams, the training organizations involve 
the staff in making important training decisions. Program staff help decide the amount of train-
ing to be provided for certain job descriptions, course objectives, and depth of course cover-
age. Companies doing this believe their training approach, which includes program staff, has 
resulted in the right amount of course depth, timeliness, and coverage of personnel.

Integrated Product/Project Teams
281
8.9 INTEGRATED PRODUCT/PROJECT TEAMS
In recent years, there has been an effort to substantially improve the 
formation and makeup of teams required to develop a new product 
or implement a new practice. These teams have membership from 
across the management and through the entire organization and are 
called integrated product/project teams (IPTs).
The IPT consists of a sponsor, program manager, and the core 
team. For the most part, members of the core team are assigned full-time to the team but 
may not be on the team for the duration of the entire project.
The skills needed to be a member of the core team include:
●
●
Self-starter ability
●
●
Work without supervision
●
●
Good communication skills
●
●
Cooperative
●
●
Technical understanding
●
●
Willing to learn backup skills
●
●
Able to perform feasibility studies and cost/benefit analyses
●
●
Able to perform or assist in market research studies
●
●
Able to evaluate asset utilization
●
●
Decision maker
●
●
Knowledgeable in risk management
●
●
Understand the need for continuous validation
Each IPT is given a project charter that identifies the project’s mission and identifies 
the assigned project manager. However, unlike traditional charters, the IPT charter can also 
identify the key members of the IPT by name or job responsibility.
Unlike traditional project teams, the IPT thrives on sharing information across the 
team and collective decision making. IPTs eventually develop their own culture and, as 
such, can function in either a formal or informal capacity. Since the concept of an IPT is 
well suited to large, long-term projects, it is no wonder that the Department of Defense 
has been researching best practices for an IPT.4 The government looked at four projects, in 
both the public and private sectors, which were highly successful using the IPT approach 
and four government projects that had less than acceptable results. The successful IPT 
projects are shown in Table 8–4. The unsuccessful IPT projects are shown in Table 8–5. 
In analyzing the data, the government came up with the results shown in Figure 8–8. Each 
vertical line in Figure 8–8 is a situation where the IPT must go outside of its own domain 
to seek information and approvals. Each time this happens, it is referred to as a “hit.” The

government research indicated that the greater the number of hits, the more likely it is that 
the time, cost, and performance constraints will not be achieved. The research confirmed 
that if the IPT has the knowledge necessary to make decisions, and also has the authority 
to make the decisions, then the desired performance would be achieved. Hits will delay 
decisions and cause schedule slippages.
8.10 VIRTUAL PROJECT TEAMS
Historically, project management was a face-to-face environment 
where team meetings involved all players convening together in one 
room. The team itself may even be co-located. Today, because of the 
size and complexity of projects, it is rare to find all team members located under one roof. 
Other possible characteristics of a virtual team are shown in Table 8–6.
Duarte and Snyder define seven types of virtual teams.5 These are shown in Table 8–7. 
Culture and technology can have a major impact on the performance of virtual teams. 
Duarte and Snyder have identified some of these relationships in Table 8–8.

Special Topics 
The importance of culture cannot be understated. Duarte and Snyder identify four 
important points to remember concerning the impact of culture on virtual teams:6
1.	 There are national cultures, organizational cultures, functional cultures, and team cultures. 
They can be sources of competitive advantages for virtual teams that know how to use 
cultural differences to create synergy. Team leaders and members who understand and are 
sensitive to cultural differences can create more robust outcomes than can members of ho-
mogeneous teams with members who think and act alike. Cultural differences can create 
distinctive advantages for teams if they are understood and used in positive ways.
2.	 The most important aspect of understanding and working with cultural differences is to cre-
ate a team culture in which problems can be surfaced and differences can he discussed in a 
productive, respectful manner.
3.	 It is essential to distinguish between problems that result from cultural differences and prob-
lems that are performance based.
4.	 Business practices and business ethics vary in different parts of the world. Virtual teams 
need to clearly articulate approaches to these that every member understands and abides by.
8.11 MANAGING INNOVATION PROJECTS
Table 8–8.  Technology and Culture
Cultural Factor
Technological Considerations
Power distance
Members from high-power-distance cultures may participate more freely with 
technologies that are asynchronous and allow anonymous input. These cultures 
sometimes use technology to indicate status differences between team members.
Uncertainty avoidance
People from cultures with high uncertainty avoidance may be slower adopters 
of technology. They may also prefer technology that is able to produce more 
permanent records of discussions and decisions.
Individualism–
collectivism
Members from highly collectivistic cultures may prefer face-to-face interactions.
Masculinity–
femininity
People from cultures with more “feminine” orientations are more prone to use 
technology in a nurturing way, especially during team startups.
Context
People from high-content cultures may prefer more information-rich technologies, 
as well as those that offer opportunities for the feeling of social presence. They 
may resist using technologies with low social presence to communicate with 
people they have never met. People from low-context cultures may prefer more 
asynchronous communications.

Understanding Innovation
Innovation is generally regarded as a new way of doing something. The 
new way of doing something should be substantially different from the 
way it was done before rather than a small incremental change such as 
with continuous improvement activities. The ultimate goal of innovation is to create hopefully 
long-lasting additional value for the company, the users, and the deliverable itself. Innovation 
can be viewed as the conversion of an idea into cash or a cash equivalent. While the goal of 
6.  See Duarte and Snyder, p. 70, note 11.

Managing Innovation Projects
285
successful innovation is to add value, the effect can be negative or even destructive if it results 
in poor team morale, an unfavorable cultural change, or a radical departure from existing ways 
of doing work. The failure of an innovation project can lead to demoralizing the organization 
and causing talented people to be risk avoiders in the future rather than risk takers.
Not all project managers are capable of managing projects involving innovation. Char-
acteristics of innovation projects include an understanding that:
●
●
Specific innovation tools and decision-making techniques may be necessary.
●
●
It may be impossible to prepare a detailed schedule showing when innovation will 
actually occur.
●
●
It may be impossible to determine a realistic budget for innovation.
●
●
Innovation may not be possible and there comes a time when one must simply 
“give up.”
●
●
The deliverable from the innovation project may not need extra “bells and whis-
tles” that would make it too costly to users.
Failure is an inevitable part of many innovation projects. The greater the degree of inno-
vation desired, the greater the need for effective risk management practices to be in place. 
Without effective risk management, it may be impossible within a reasonable time period to 
“pull the plug” on a project that is a cash drain and with no likelihood of achieving success.
Standard project management methodologies do not necessarily lend themselves to 
projects requiring innovation. Frameworks may be more appropriate. Methodologies work 
well when there exists a well-defined statement of work and reasonable estimates. Sched-
ules and WBS development are normally based upon rolling wave or progressive planning 
since it is unlikely that we can develop a detailed plan and schedule for the entire project.
Project Selection
Your company has a list of twenty projects that they would like to 
accomplish, and each project may or may not require some different 
degree of innovation. If current funding will support only a few pro-
jects, then how does a company decide which of the twenty projects to work on first? This 
is the project selection and prioritization process. Project selection is a necessity for all 
projects but usually more difficult to perform if some degree of innovation is required. 
Predicting the degree of complexity is difficult. Based upon the company’s financial health, 
the company may select projects not requiring innovation but have a high expectation of 
generating short-term cash flow. Project selection decisions are not made in a vacuum. The 
decision is usually related to other factors such as funding limitations, timing of the fund-
ing, criticality of the project and its alignment with the strategic plan, timing of cash flow 
expected from the completed project, fit with other projects in the portfolio, availability or 
the required resources, and, perhaps most important, the availability of qualified project 
managers and team members. The selection of an innovation project could be based upon 
the completion of other projects that would release resources needed for the new project. 
Also, the project selected may be constrained by the completion date such that resources 
must be released to other activities. In any event, some form of selection process is needed, 
and this may very well involve the PMO. What is unfortunate is that project managers are 
generally brought on board after the selection has been made, therefore having very little 
to say in the selection process.

286
Special Topics 
Project selection decision makers frequently have much less informa-
tion to evaluate possible innovation projects than they would wish, 
especially if they do not consult the project manager. Uncertainties 
often surround the success likelihood of a project and market response, the ultimate market 
value of the project, its total cost to completion, and the probability of success and/or a 
technical breakthrough. This lack of an adequate information base often leads to another 
difficulty: the lack of a systematic approach to project selection and evaluation. Consensus 
criteria and methods for assessing each candidate project against these criteria are essential 
for rational decision making. Though most organizations have established organizational 
goals and objectives, these are usually not detailed enough to be used as criteria for project 
selection decision making. However, they are an essential starting point.
Project selection and evaluation decisions are often confounded by several behavioral 
and organizational factors. Departmental loyalties, conflicts in desires, differences in per-
spectives, and an unwillingness to openly share information can stymie the project selec-
tion and evaluation process. Adding to these, the uncertainties of innovation and possibly 
a lack of understanding of the complexities of the innovation project can make decision 
making riskier than for projects where innovation may be unnecessary. Much project evalu-
ation data and information are necessarily subjective in nature. Thus, the willingness of the 
parties to openly share and put trust in each other’s opinions becomes an important factor.
The risk-taking climate or culture of an organization can also have a decisive bear-
ing on the project selection process as well as creating additional problems for the project 
manager during project execution. If the climate is risk averse, then high-risk projects 
requiring innovation may never surface. Attitudes within the organization toward ideas 
and the volume of ideas being generated will influence the quality of the projects selected. 
In general, the greater the number of creative ideas generated, the greater the chances of 
selecting projects that will yield the greatest value.
Project Selection Obstacles
Identification of Projects
Because the number of potential ideas can be large, some sort of 
classification system is needed. There are three common methods of 
classification. The first method is to place the projects into two major 
categories such as survival and growth. The sources and types of funds for these two cat-
egories can and will be different. The second method comes from typical R&D strategic 
planning models. Using this approach, projects to develop new products or services are 
classified as either offensive or defensive projects. Offensive projects are designed to cap-
ture new markets or expand market share within existing markets. Offensive projects man-
date the continuous development of new products and services predicated upon innovation. 
Defensive projects are designed to extend the life of existing products or services. This 
could include add-ons or enhancements geared toward keeping present customers or find-
ing new customers for one’s existing products or services. Defensive projects are usually 
easier to manage than offensive projects and have a higher probability of success. Some 
other methods for classifying projects are:
●
●
Radical technical breakthrough projects
●
●
Next-generation projects

Agile Project Management

●
●
New family members
●
●
Add-ons and enhancement projects
Radical technological breakthrough projects are the most difficult to manage because of 
the need for possibly extensive innovation. These innovation projects, if successful, can lead to 
profits that are many times larger than the original development costs. Unsuccessful innovation 
projects can lead to equally dramatic losses, which is one of the reasons why senior manage-
ment must exercise due caution in approving innovation projects. Care must be taken to iden-
tify and screen out inferior candidate projects before committing significant resources to them.
There is no question that innovation projects are the most costly and most difficult to 
manage. Some companies mistakenly believe that the solution is to minimize or limit the 
total number of ideas for new projects or to limit the number of ideas in each category. This 
could be a costly mistake for long-term growth.
8.12 AGILE PROJECT MANAGEMENT
When companies first get involved in project management, there is a tendency to focus 
on a formalized project management approach structured around a project management 
methodology that contains rigid policies and procedures as to how project work must take 
place. Deviations from the plan were discouraged because there was an inherent fear at the 
executive levels that there might be a loss of control without formalized processes.
As companies become reasonably mature in project management, there is a tendency to 
go from formal to informal project management, minimize the need for excessive documen-
tation (possibly even hoping for paperless project management), and trust that the project 
team will make the right decisions. In order to support the existence of the more informal 
approach to project management, techniques such as agile project management have sur-
faced. There are several forms of agile project management. Most of these forms are designed 
to alleviate some of the problems with traditional project management, as seen in Table 8–9.

Table 8–9.  Comparison of Traditional versus Agile Project Management

288
Special Topics 
While agile project management practices may eventually replace traditional project 
management practices, there is the fear that implementation failure may occur. Therefore, 
it may be difficult to go directly to agile project management without first having some 
form of traditional project management in place.
While the benefits of agile are quite apparent, there is a risk that the benefits may not 
be achieved if the company rushing into an adoption of an agile approach without having 
at least a cursory understanding of project management. Companies that are experienced in 
project management practices seem to have an easier time implementing agile and achiev-
ing the benefits. Precautions must be taken because, while traditional project management 
knowledge is necessary to develop project management skills in general, the same knowl-
edge may not be directly applicable in an agile environment. Charles Cobb states:7
Agile is causing us to broaden our vision of what project management is, and this will 
have a dramatic impact on the potential roles that a project manager can play in an agile 
project. The image of a project manager is typically very heavily focused on a plan-driven 
approach.
All of these things are good things for a traditional project manager to know, but 
many of them become irrelevant in an agile environment, which calls for a very differ-
ent approach. In an agile environment, you may not have enough information upfront to 
develop detailed project plans and work breakdown structures, and it may be very difficult, 
if not impossible, to predict how all of the project activities will be organized in advance 
in terms of PERT [networking] charts and Gantt charts. Agile calls for a much more fluid 
and dynamic approach that is optimized around dealing with a much more unpredictable 
and uncertain environment.
That doesn’t mean that the typical plan-driven approach to project management is obso-
lete and no longer useful, but it certainly should not be the only way to run a project. The 
challenge for project managers is going beyond a traditional, plan-driven approach and 
learning a much broader range of project management practices in a wider range of envi-
ronments with potentially much higher levels of uncertainty. It is much more of a multidi-
mensional and adaptive approach to project management.

this chapter:
 1.	 You have been sent on a business trip to visit one of the companies bidding on a contract to 
be awarded by your company. You are there to determine the validity of the information in 
its proposal. They take you to dinner one evening at a very expensive restaurant. When the 
bill comes, you should:
A.	 Thank them for their generosity and let them pay the bill.
B.	 Thank them for their generosity and tell them that you prefer to pay for your own meal.
C.	 Offer to pay for the meal for everyone and put it on your company’s credit card.
D.	 Offer to pay the bill, put it on your company’s credit card, and make the appropriate ad-
justment in the company’s bid price to cover the cost of the meals.
2.	 You are preparing a proposal in response to a request for proposal (RFP) from a poten-
tially important client. The salesperson in your company working on the proposal tells 
you to “lie” in the proposal to improve the company’s chance of winning the contract. You 
should:
A.	 Do as you are told.
B.	 Refuse to work on the proposal.
C.	 Report the matter to your superior, the project sponsor, or the corporate legal group.
D.	 Resign from the company.

290

3.	 You are preparing for a customer interface meeting and your project sponsor asks you to lie 
to the customer about certain test results. You should:
A.	 Do as you are told.
B.	 Refuse to work on the project from this point forth.
C.	 Report the matter to either your superior or the corporate legal group for advice.
D.	 Resign from the company.
4.	 One of the project managers in your company approaches you with a request to use some of 
the charge numbers from your project (which is currently running under budget) for work on 
their project (which is currently running over budget). Your contract is a cost-reimbursable 
contract for a client external to your company. You should:
A.	 Do as you are requested.
B.	 Refuse to do this unless the project manager allows you to use his charge numbers 
later on.
C.	 Report the matter to your superior, the project sponsor, or the corporate legal group.
D.	 Ask the project manager to resign from the company.
5.	 You have submitted a proposal to a client as part of a competitive bidding effort. One of the 
people evaluating your bid informs you that it is customary to send them some gifts in order 
to have a better chance of winning the contract. You should:
A.	 Send them some gifts.
B.	 Do not send any gifts and see what happens.
C.	 Report the matter to your superior, the project sponsor, or the corporate legal group for 
advice.
D.	 Withdraw the proposal.
6.	 You just discovered that the company where your brother-in-law is employed has submitted 
a proposal to your company. Your brother-in-law has asked you to do everything possible to 
make sure that his company will win the contract because his job may be in jeopardy. You 
should:
A.	 Do what your brother-in-law requests.
B.	 Refuse to look into the matter and pretend it never happened.
C.	 Report the conflict of interest to your superior, the project sponsor, or the corporate legal 
group.
D.	 Hire an attorney for advice.
7.	 As part of a proposal evaluation team, you have discovered that the contract will be awarded 
to Alpha Company and that a formal announcement will be made in two days. The price of 
Alpha Company’s stock may just skyrocket because of this contract award. You should:
A.	 Purchase as much Alpha Company stock as you can within the next two days.
B.	 Tell family members to purchase the stock.
C.	 Tell employees in the company to purchase the stock.
D.	 Do nothing about stock purchases until after the formal announcement has been made.
8.	 Your company has decided to cancel a contract with Beta Company. Only a handful of em-

A.	 Accept as long as you complete the audit within two days.
B.	 Accept but take vacation time for fishing and gambling.
C.	 Accept their invitation but at a later time so that it does not interfere with the audit.
D.	 Gracefully decline their invitation.
	10.	 You have been assigned as the project manager for a large project in the Pacific Rim. This 
is a very important project for both your company and the client. In your first meeting with 
the client, you are presented with a very expensive gift for yourself and another expensive 
gift for your spouse. You were told by your company that this is considered an acceptable 
custom when doing work in this country. You should:
A.	 Gracefully accept both gifts.
B.	 Gracefully accept both gifts but report only your gift to your company.
C.	 Gracefully accept both gifts and report both gifts to your company.
D.	 Gracefully refuse both gifts.
	11.	 Your company is looking at the purchase of some property for a new plant. You are part of 
the committee making the final decision. You discover that the owner of a local auto deal-
ership from whom you purchase family cars owns one of the properties. The owner of the 
dealership tells you in confidence that he will give you a new model car to use for free for 
up to three years if your company purchases his property for the new plant. You should:
A.	 Say thank you and accept the offer.
B.	 Remove yourself from the committee for conflict of interest.
C.	 Report the matter to your superior, the project sponsor, or the corporate legal group for 
advice.
D.	 Accept the offer as long as the car is in your spouse’s name.
	12.	 Your company has embarked upon a large project (with you as project manager) and as an 
output from the project there will be some toxic waste as residue from the manufacturing

toxic waste and no environmental danger exists. This information on toxic waste has not been 
made available to the general public as yet, and the general public does not appear to know 
about this waste problem. During an interview with local newspaper personnel you are dis-
cussing the new project and the question of environmental concerns comes up. You should:
A.	 Say there are no problems with environmental concerns.
B.	 Say that you have not looked at the environmental issues problems as yet.
C.	 Say nothing and ask for the next question.
D.	 Be truthful and reply as delicately as possible.

	13.	 As a project manager, you establish a project policy that you, in advance of the meeting, 
review all handouts presented to your external customer during project status review meet-
ings. While reviewing the handouts, you notice that one slide contains company confidential 
information. Presenting this information to the customer would certainly enhance good 
will. You should:
A.	 Present the information to the customer.
B.	 Remove the confidential information immediately.
C.	 Discuss the possible violation with senior management and the legal department before 
taking any action.
D.	 First discuss the situation with the team member that created the slide and then discuss the 
possible violation with senior management and the legal department before taking any action.
	14.	 You are managing a project for an external client. Your company developed a new testing 
procedure to validate certain properties of a product and the new testing procedure was 
developed entirely with internal funds. Your company owns all of the intellectual property 
rights associated with the new test. The workers who developed the new test used one of the 
components developed for your current customer as part of the experimental process. The 
results using the new test showed that the component would actually exceed the customer’s 
expectations. You should:
A.	 Show the results to the customer but do not discuss the fact that it came from the new 
test procedure.
B.	 Do not show the results of the new test procedure since the customer’s specifications call 
for use of the old test procedures.
C.	 First change the customer’s specifications and then show the customer the results.
D.	 Discuss the release of this information with your legal department and senior manage-
ment before taking any action.
	15.	 Using the same scenario as in the previous question, assume that the new test procedure that 
is expected to be more accurate than the old test procedure indicates that performance will 
not meet customer specifications, whereas the old test indicates that customer specifications 
will be barely met. You should:
A.	 Present the old test results to the customer showing that specification requirements will 
be met.
B.	 Show both sets of test results and explain that the new procedure is unproven technology.
C.	 First change the customer’s specifications and then show the customer the results.
D.	 Discuss the release of this information with your legal department and senior manage-
ment before taking any action.
	16.	 Your customer has demanded to see the “raw data” test results from last week’s testing. Usu-
ally the test results are not released to customers until after the company reaches a conclusion 
on the meaning of the test results. Your customer has heard through the grapevine that the 
testing showed poor results. Management has left the entire decision up to you. You should:
A.	 Show the results and explain that it is simply raw data and that your company’s interpre-
tation of the results will be forthcoming.
B.	 Withhold the information until after the results are verified.
C.	 Stall for time even if it means lying to the customer.
D.	 Explain to the customer your company’s policy of not releasing raw data.

	17.	 One of your team members plays golf with your external customer’s project manager. You 
discover that the employee has been feeding the customer company-sensitive information. 
You should:
A.	 Inform the customer that project information from anyone other than the project man-
ager is not official until released by the project manager.
B.	 Change the contractual terms and conditions and release the information.
C.	 Remove the employee from your project team.
D.	 Explain to the employee the ramifications of his actions and that he still represents the 
company when not at work; then report this as a violation.
	18.	 Your company has a policy that all company-sensitive material must be stored in locked 
filing cabinets at the end of each day. One of your employees has received several notices 
from the security office for violating this policy. You should:
A.	 Reprimand the employee.
B.	 Remove the employee from your project.
C.	 Ask the Human Resources Group to have the employee terminated.
D.	 Counsel the employee as well as other team members on the importance of confidential-
ity and the possible consequences for violations.
	19.	 You have just received last month’s earned-value information that must be shown to the 
customer in the monthly status review meeting. Last month’s data showed unfavorable vari-
ances that exceeded the permissible threshold limits on time and cost variances. This was 
the result of a prolonged power outage in the manufacturing area. Your manufacturing engi-
neer tells you that this is not a problem and next month you will be right on target on time 
and cost as you have been in the last five months. You should:
A.	 Provide the data to the customer and be truthful in the explanation of the variances.
B.	 Adjust the variances so that they fall within the threshold limits since this problem will 
correct itself next month.
C.	 Do not report any variances this month.
D.	 Expand the threshold limits on the acceptable variances but do not tell the customer.
	20.	 You are working in a foreign country where it is customary for a customer to present gifts to 
the contractor’s project manager throughout the project as a way of showing appreciation. 
Declining the gifts would be perceived by the customer as an insult. Your company has a 
policy on how to report gifts received. The best way to handle this situation would be to:
A.	 Refuse all gifts.
B.	 Send the customer a copy of our company’s policy on accepting gifts.
C.	 Accept the gifts and report the gifts according to policy.
D.	 Report all gifts even though the policy says that some gifts need not be reported.
	21.	 You are interviewing a candidate to fill a project management position in your company. On 
her resume, she states that she is a PMP® credential holder. One of your workers who knows 
the candidate informs you that she is not a PMP® credential holder yet but is planning to 
take the test next month and certainly expects to pass. You should:
A.	 Wait until she passes the exam before interviewing her.
B.	 Interview her and ask her why she lied.

	22.	 You are managing a multinational project from your office in Chicago. Half of your project 
team are from a foreign country but are living in Chicago while working on your project. 
These people inform you that two days during next week are national religious holidays in 
their country and they will be observing the holiday by not coming into work. You should:
A.	 Respect their beliefs and say nothing.
B.	 Force them to work because they are in the United States where their holiday is not 
celebrated.
C.	 Tell them that they must work noncompensated overtime when they return to work in 
order to make up the lost time.
D.	 Remove them from the project team if possible.
	23.	 PMI® informs you that one of your team members who took the PMP® exam last week and 
passed may have had the answers to the questions in advance provided to him by some of 
your other team members who are also PMP® credential holders and were tutoring him. 
PMI is asking for your support in the investigation. You should:
A.	 Assist PMI in the investigation of the violation.
B.	 Call in the employee for interrogation and counseling.
C.	 Call in the other team members for interrogation and counseling.
D.	 Tell PMI® that it is their problem, not your problem.
	24.	 One of your team members has been with you for the past year since her graduation from 
college. The team member informs you that she is now a PMP® credential holder and shows 
you her certificate from PMI acknowledging this. You wonder how she was qualified to take 
the exam since she had no prior work experience prior to joining your company one year 
ago. You should:
A.	 Report this to PMI as a possible violation.
B.	 Call in the employee for counseling.
C.	 Ask the employee to surrender her PMP credentials.
D.	 Do nothing.
	25.	 Four companies have responded to your RFP. Each proposal has a different technical so-
lution to your problem and each proposal states that the information in the proposal is 
company-proprietary knowledge and not to be shared with anyone. After evaluation of the 
proposals, you discover that the best technical approach is from the highest bidder. You are 
unhappy about this. You decide to show the proposal from the highest bidder to the lowest 
bidder to see if the lowest bidder can provide the same technical solution but at a lower cost. 
This situation is:
A.	 Acceptable since once the proposals are submitted to your company, you have unlimited 
access to the intellectual property in the proposals
B.	 Acceptable since all companies do this
C.	 Acceptable as long as you inform the high bidder that you are showing their proposal to 
the lowest bidder
D.	 Unacceptable and is a violation of the Code of Professional Conduct

 IS IT FRAUD?
Background
Paul was a project management consultant and often helped the Judge Ad-
vocate General’s Office (JAG) by acting as an expert witness in lawsuits 
filed by the U.S. government against defense contractors. While most lawsuits were based upon 
unacceptable performance by the contractors, this lawsuit was different; it was based upon sup-
posedly superior performance.

Special Topics 
Paul sat in the office of Army colonel Jensen listening to the colonel’s 
description of the history behind this contract. Colonel Jensen stated:
“We have been working with the Welton Company for almost ten years. This contract was 
one of several contracts we have had with them over the years. It was a one-year contract to 
produce 1,500 units for the Department of the Navy. Welton told us during contract negotiations 
that they needed two quarters to develop their manufacturing plans and conduct procurement. 
They would then ship the Navy 750 units at the end of the third quarter and the remaining 750 
units at the end of the fourth quarter. On some other contracts, manufacturing planning and 
procurement was done in less than one quarter.
“On other contracts similar to this one, the Navy would negotiate a firm-fixed-price con-
tract because the risk to both the buyer and seller was quite low. The government’s proposal 
statement of work also stated that this would be a firm-fixed-price contract. But during final 
contract negotiations, Welton became adamant in wanting this contract to be an incentive-type 
contract with a bonus for coming in under budget and/or ahead of schedule.
“We were somewhat perplexed about why they wanted an incentive contract. Current eco-
nomic conditions in the United States were poor during the time we did the bidding and compa-
nies like Welton were struggling to get government contracts and keep their people employed. 
Under these conditions, we believed that they would want to take as long as possible to finish 
the contract just to keep their people working.
“Their request for an incentive contract made no sense to us, but we reluctantly agreed to 
it. We often change the type of contract based upon special circumstances. We issued a fixed-
price-incentive-fee contract with a special incentive clause for a large bonus should they finish 
the work early and ship all 1,500 units to the Navy. The target cost for the contract, including 
$10 million in procurement, was $35 million with a sharing ratio of 90%–10% and a profit tar-
get of $4 million. The point of total assumption was at a contract price of $43.5 million.
“Welton claimed that they finished their procurement and manufacturing plans in the first 
quarter of the year. They shipped the Navy 750 units at the end of the second quarter and the 
remaining 750 units at the end of the third quarter. According to their invoices, which we au-
dited, they spent $30 million in labor in the first nine months of the contract and $10 million in 
procurement. The government issued them checks totaling $49.5 million. That included $43.5 
million plus the incentive bonus of $6 million for early delivery of the units.
“The JAG office believes that Welton took advantage of the Department of the Navy when 
they demanded and received a fixed-price-incentive-fee contract. We want you to look over their 
proposal and what they did on the contract and see if anything looks suspicious.”
Meeting with Colonel Jensen
Consultant’s Audit
The first thing that Paul did was to review the final costs on the contract.
Labor:
$30,000.000
Material:
$10,000,000
$40,000,000
Cost overrun:
$5,000,000
Welton’s cost:
$500,000
Final profit:
$3,500,000

Welton completed the contract exactly at the contract price ceiling, also the point of total as-
sumption, of $43.5 million.
The cost overrun of $5 million was entirely in labor. Welton originally expected to do 
the job in twelve months for $25 million in labor. That amounted to an average monthly labor 
expenditure of $2,083,333. But Welton actually spent $30 million in labor over nine months, 
which amounted to an average monthly labor cost of $3,333,333. Welton was spending about 
$1.25 million more per month than planned for during the first nine months. Welton explained 
that part of the labor overrun was due to overtime and using more people than anticipated.
It was pretty clear in Paul’s mind what Welton had done. Welton overspent the labor by $5 
million and only $500,000 of the overrun was paid by Welton because of the sharing ratio. In 
addition, Welton received a $6 million bonus for early delivery. Simply stated, Welton received 
$6 million for a $500,000 investment.
Paul knew that believing this to be true was one thing, but being able to prove this in court 
would require more supporting information. Paul’s next step was to read the proposal that Wel-
ton submitted. On the bottom of the first page of the proposal was a paragraph entitled “Truth of 
Negotiations” which stated that everything in the proposal was the truth. The letter was signed 
by a senior officer at Welton. Paul then began reading the management section of the proposal. 
In the management section, Welton bragged about previous contracts almost identical to this 
one with the Department of the Navy and other government organizations. Welton also stated 
that most of the people used on this contract had worked on the previous contracts. Paul found 
other statements in the proposal that implied that the manufacturing plans for this contract were 
similar to those of other contracts and Paul now wondered why two quarters were needed to 
develop the manufacturing plans for this project. Paul was now convinced that something was 
wrong.
QUESTIONS
1.	 What information does Paul have to support his belief that something is wrong?
2.	 Knowing that you are not an attorney, does it appear from a project management perspective 
that sufficient information exists for a possible lawsuit to recover all or part of the incentive 
bonus for early delivery?
3.	 How do you think this case study ended? (It is a factual case and the author was the 
consultant.)

9.0 INTRODUCTION
Project management cannot succeed unless the project manager is willing to employ the systems approach 
to project management by analyzing those variables that lead to success and failure. This chapter briefly 
discusses the dos and don’ts of project management and provides a “skeleton” checklist of the key success 
variables. The following five topics are included:

9.1 PREDICTING PROJECT SUCCESS
One of the most difficult tasks is predicting whether the project will 
be successful. Most goal-oriented managers look only at the time, 
cost, and performance parameters. If an out-of-tolerance condition 
exists, then additional analysis is required to identify the cause of the problem. Looking 
only at time, cost, and performance might identify immediate contributions to profits, but 
will not identify whether the project itself was managed correctly. This takes on paramount 
importance if the survival of the organization is based on a steady stream of successfully 
managed projects. Once or twice a project manager might be able to force a project to suc-
cess. After a while, however, either the effect of the big bat will become tolerable, or people 
will avoid working on his projects.

The Variables for Success 
Project success is often measured by the “actions” of three groups: the project man-
ager and team, the parent organization, and the customer’s organization. There are certain 
actions that the project manager and team can take in order to stimulate project success. 
These actions include:
●
●
Insist on the right to select key project team members.
●
●
Select key team members with proven track records in their fields.
●
●
Develop commitment and a sense of mission from the outset.
●
●
Seek sufficient authority and organizational form that supports project management.
●
●
Coordinate and maintain a good relationship with the client, parent, and team.
●
●
Seek to enhance the public’s image of the project.
●
●
Have key team members assist in decision making and problem solving.
●
●
Develop realistic cost, schedule, and performance estimates and goals.
●
●
Have backup strategies in anticipation of potential problems.
●
●
Provide a team structure that is appropriate, yet flexible and flat.
●
●
Go beyond formal authority to maximize influence over people and key decisions.
●
●
Employ a workable set of project planning and control tools.
●
●
Avoid overreliance on one type of control tool.
●
●
Stress the importance of meeting cost, schedule, and performance goals.
●
●
Give priority to achieving the mission or function of the end item.
●
●
Keep changes under control.
●
●
Seek to find ways of assuring job security for effective project team members.
In Chapter 4 we stated that a project cannot be successful unless it is recognized as 
a project and has the support of top-level management. Top-level management must be 
willing to commit company resources and provide the necessary administrative support so 
that the project easily adapts to the company’s day-to-day routine of doing business. Fur-
thermore, the parent organization must develop an atmosphere conducive to good working 
relationships between the project manager, parent organization, and client organization.
With regard to the parent and client organizations, there exist a number of variables that 
can be used to evaluate parent organization support. These variables are included in Table 9–1.
Table 9–1.  Variables to Parent and Client Organizations Support
Parent Organization Variables
Client Organization Variables
• A willingness to coordinate efforts
• A willingness to maintain structural flexibility
• A willingness to adapt to change
• Effective strategic planning
• Rapport maintenance
• Proper emphasis on past experience
• External buffering
• Prompt and accurate communications
• Enthusiastic support
• Identification to all concerned parties that the 
project does, in fact, contribute to parent capabilities
• A willingness to coordinate efforts
• Rapport maintenance
• Establishment of reasonable and specific goals and 
criteria
• Well-established procedures for changes
• Prompt and accurate communications
• Commitment of client resources
• Minimization of red tape
• Providing sufficient authority to the client contact 
(especially for decision making)

Predicting Project Success
301
The mere identification and existence of these variables do not guarantee project suc-
cess. Instead, they imply that there exists a good foundation with which to work so that if 
the project manager and team, and the parent and client organizations, take the appropriate 
actions, project success is likely.
Within the parent organization, the following actions must be taken:
●
●
Select at an early point, a project manager with a proven track record of technical 
skills, human skills, and administrative skills (not necessarily in that order) to lead 
the project team.
●
●
Develop clear and workable guidelines for the project manager.
●
●
Delegate sufficient authority to the project manager, and let him make important 
decisions in conjunction with key team members.
●
●
Demonstrate enthusiasm for and commitment to the project and team.
●
●
Develop and maintain short and informal lines of communication.
●
●
Avoid excessive pressure on the project manager to win contracts.
●
●
Avoid arbitrarily slashing or ballooning the project team’s cost estimate.
●
●
Avoid “buy-ins.”
●
●
Develop close, not meddling, working relationships with the principal client con-
tact and project manager.
Both the parent organization and the project team must employ proper managerial tech-
niques to ensure that judicious and adequate, but not excessive, use of planning, control-
ling, and communications systems can be made. These proper management techniques must 
also include preconditioning, such as clearly established specifications and designs, realistic 
schedules, realistic cost estimates, avoidance of “buy-ins,” and avoidance of overoptimism.
The client organization can have a great deal of influence on project success by mini-
mizing team meetings, making rapid responses to requests for information, and simply 
letting the contractor “do his thing” without any interference.
With the client organization variables stated in Table 9–1 as the basic foundation, it 
should be possible for the project management team to:
●
●
Encourage openness and honesty from the start from all participants.
●
●
Create an atmosphere that encourages healthy competition, but not cutthroat situ-
ations or “liars’” contests.
●
●
Plan for adequate funding to complete the entire project.
●
●
Develop clear understandings of the relative importance of cost, schedule, and 
technical performance goals.
●
●
Develop short and informal lines of communication and a flat organizational structure.
●
●
Delegate sufficient authority to the principal client contact, and allow prompt 
approval or rejection of important project decisions.
●
●
Reject “buy-ins.”
●
●
Make prompt decisions regarding contract award or go-ahead.
●
●
Develop close, not meddling, working relationships with project participants.
●
●
Avoid arm’s-length relationships.
●
●
Avoid excessive reporting schemes.
●
●
Make prompt decisions regarding changes.

302
The Variables for Success 
By combining the relevant actions of the project team, parent organization, and client 
organization, we can identify the fundamental lessons for management. These include:
●
●
When starting off in project management, plan to go all the way.
●
●
Recognize authority conflicts—resolve.
●
●
Recognize change impact—be a change agent.
●
●
Match the right people with the right jobs.
●
●
No system is better than the people who implement it.
●
●
Allow adequate time and effort for laying out the project groundwork and defining work:
●
●
Work breakdown structure
●
●
Network planning
●
●
Ensure that work packages are the proper size:
●
●
Manageable, with organizational accountability
●
●
Realistic in terms of effort and time
●
●
Establish and use planning and control systems as the focal point of project 
implementation:
●
●
Know where you’re going.
●
●
Know when you’ve gotten there.
●
●
Be sure information flow is realistic:
●
●
Information is the basis for problem solving and decision making.
●
●
Communication “pitfalls” are the greatest contributor to project difficulties.
●
●
Be willing to replan—do so:
●
●
The best-laid plans can often go astray.
●
●
Change is inevitable.
●
●
Tie together responsibility, performance, and rewards:
●
●
Management by objectives
●
●
Key to motivation and productivity
●
●
Long before the project ends, plan for its end:
●
●
Disposition of personnel
●
●
Disposal of material and other resources
●
●
Transfer of knowledge
●
●
Closing out work orders
●
●
Customer/contractor financial payments and reporting
9.2 PROJECT MANAGEMENT EFFECTIVENESS
Project managers interact continually with upper-level management, 
perhaps more so than with functional managers. Not only the suc-
cess of the project, but even the career path of the project manager 
can depend on the working relationships and expectations estab-
lished with upper-level management. There are four key variables in

Expectations
303
­measuring the effectiveness of dealing with upper-level management. These variables are 
credibility, priority, accessibility, and visibility:
●
●
Credibility
●
●
Credibility comes from being a sound decision maker.
●
●
It is normally based on experience in a variety of assignments.
●
●
It is refueled by the manager and the status of his project.
●
●
Making success visible to others increases credibility.
●
●
To be believable, emphasize facts rather than opinions.
●
●
Give credit to others; they may return this favor.
●
●
Priority
●
●
Sell the specific importance of the project to the objectives of the total organization.
●
●
Stress the competitive aspect, if relevant.
●
●
Stress changes for success.
●
●
Secure testimonial support from others—functional departments, other man-
agers, customers, independent sources.
●
●
Emphasize “spin-offs” that may result from projects.
●
●
Anticipate “priority problems.”
●
●
Sell priority on a one-to-one basis.
●
●
Accessibility
●
●
Accessibility involves the ability to communicate directly with top management.
●
●
Show that your proposals are good for the total organization, not just the project.
●
●
Weigh the facts carefully; explain the pros and cons.
●
●
Be logical and polished in your presentations.
●
●
Become personally known by members of top management.
●
●
Create a desire in the “customer” for your abilities and your project.
●
●
Make curiosity work for you.
●
●
Visibility
●
●
Be aware of the amount of visibility you really need.
●
●
Make a good impact when presenting the project to top management.
●
●
Adopt a contrasting style of management when feasible and possible.
●
●
Use team members to help regulate the visibility you need.
●
●
Conduct timely “informational” meetings with those who count.
●
●
Use available publicity media.
9.3 EXPECTATIONS
In the project management environment, the project managers, team 
members, and upper-level managers each have expectations of what 
their relationships should be with the other parties. To illustrate this, 
top management expects project managers to:
●
●
Assume total accountability for the success or failure to provide results
●
●
Provide effective reports and information

Management

The Variables for Success 
●
●
Provide minimum organizational disruption during the execution of a project
●
●
Present recommendations, not just alternatives
●
●
Have the capacity to handle most interpersonal problems
●
●
Demonstrate a self-starting capacity
●
●
Demonstrate growth with each assignment
At first glance, it may appear that these qualities are expected of all managers, not 
necessarily project managers. But this is not true. The first four items are different. The line 
managers are not accountable for total project success, just for that portion performed by 
their line organization. Line managers can be promoted on their technical ability, not nec-
essarily on their ability to write effective reports. Line managers cannot disrupt an entire 
organization, but the project manager can. Line managers do not necessarily have to make 
decisions, just provide alternatives and recommendations.
Just as top management has expectations of project managers, project managers have 
certain expectations of top management. Project management expects top management to:
●
●
Provide clearly defined decision channels
●
●
Take actions on requests
●
●
Facilitate interfacing with support departments
●
●
Assist in conflict resolution
●
●
Provide sufficient resources/charter
●
●
Provide sufficient strategic/long-range information
●
●
Provide feedback
●
●
Give advice and stage-setting support
●
●
Define expectations clearly
●
●
Provide protection from political infighting
●
●
Provide the opportunity for personal and professional growth
The project team also has expectations of their leader, the project manager. The project 
team expects the project manager to:
●
●
Assist in the problem-solving process by coming up with ideas
●
●
Provide proper direction and leadership
●
●
Provide a relaxed environment
●
●
Interact informally with team members
●
●
Stimulate the group process
●
●
Facilitate adoption of new members
●
●
Reduce conflicts
●
●
Defend the team against outside pressure
●
●
Resist changes
●
●
Act as the group spokesperson
●
●
Provide representation with higher management
In order to provide high task efficiency and productivity, a project team should have 
certain traits and characteristics. A project manager expects the project team to:
●
●
Demonstrate membership self-development
●
●
Demonstrate the potential for innovative and creative behavior

Lessons Learned
305
●
●
Communicate effectively
●
●
Be committed to the project
●
●
Demonstrate the capacity for conflict resolution
●
●
Be results oriented
●
●
Be change oriented
●
●
Interface effectively and with high morale
Team members want, in general, to fill certain primary needs. The project manager 
should understand these needs before demanding that the team live up to his expectations. 
Members of the project team need:
●
●
A sense of belonging
●
●
Interest in the work itself
●
●
Respect for the work being done
●
●
Protection from political infighting
●
●
Job security and job continuity
●
●
Potential for career growth
Project managers must remember that team members may not always be able to 
­verbalize these needs, but they exist nevertheless.
9.4 LESSONS LEARNED
Lessons can be learned from each and every project, even if the project is a failure. But 
many companies do not document lessons learned because employees are reluctant to sign 
their names to documents that indicate they made mistakes. Thus employees end up repeat-
ing the mistakes that others have made.
Today, there is increasing emphasis on documenting lessons learned. Boeing main-
tains diaries of lessons learned on each airplane project. Another company conducts a post-
implementation meeting where the team is required to prepare a three- to five-page case 
study documenting the successes and failures on the project. The case studies are then used 
by the training department in preparing individuals to become future project managers. 
Some companies even mandate that project managers keep project notebooks documenting 
all decisions as well as a project file with all project correspondence. On large projects, this 
may be impractical.
Most companies seem to prefer post-implementation meetings and case study docu-
mentation. The problem is when to hold the post-implementation meeting. One company 
uses project management for new product development and production. When the first 
production run is complete, the company holds a post-implementation meeting to discuss 
what was learned. Approximately six months later, the company conducts a second post-
implementation meeting to discuss customer reaction to the product. There have been situ-
ations where the reaction of the customer indicated that what the company thought they 
did right turned out to be a wrong decision. A follow-up case study is now prepared during 
the second meeting.

The Variables for Success 
9.5 UNDERSTANDING BEST PRACTICES
One of the benefits of understanding the variables of success is that it 
provides you with a means for capturing and retaining best practices. 
Unfortunately this is easier said than done. There are multiple defini-
tions of a best practice, such as:
●
●
Something that works
●
●
Something that works well
●
●
Something that works well on a repetitive basis
●
●
Something that leads to a competitive advantage
●
●
Something that can be identified in a proposal to generate business
Ultimately, best practices are those actions or activities undertaken by the company or 
individuals that lead to a sustained competitive advantage in project management.
It has only been in recent years that the importance of best practices has been recog-
nized. In the early years of project management, there were misconceptions concerning 
project management.
As project management evolved, best practices became important. Best practices can 
be learned from both successes and failures. In the early years of project management, 
private industry focused on learning best practices from successes. The government, how-
ever, focused on learning about best practices from failures. When the government finally 
focused on learning from successes, the knowledge on best practices came from their rela-
tionships with both their prime contractors and the subcontractors. Some of the best prac-
tices that emerged included:
●
●
Use of life-cycle phases
●
●
Standardization and consistency
●
●
Use of templates for planning, scheduling, control, and risk
●
●
Providing military personnel in project management positions with extended tours 
of duty at the same location
●
●
Use of integrated project teams (IPTs)
●
●
Control of contractor-generated scope changes
●
●
Use of earned-value measurement (discussed in Chapter 14)
There are several questions that must be addressed before an activity 
is recognized as a best practice. Three frequently asked questions are:
●
●
Who determines that an activity is a best practice?
●
●
How do you properly evaluate what you think is best practice to validate that in 
fact it is a true best practice?
●
●
How do you get executives to recognize that best practices are true value-added 
activities and should be championed by executive management?

Critical Questions

Understanding Best Practices
307
Some organizations have committees that report to senior management that have as 
their primary function the evaluation of potential best practices. Other organizations use 
the PMO to perform this work.
There is a difference between lessons learned and best practices. Lessons learned can 
be favorable or unfavorable, whereas best practices are usually favorable outcomes.
Evaluating whether or not something is a best practice is not time-consuming, but it is 
complex. Simply believing that an action is a best practice does not mean that it is a best 
practice, but rather a proven practice. PMOs are currently developing templates and criteria 
for determining whether an activity may qualify as a best practice. Some items that might 
be included in the template are:
●
●
Is it a measurable metric?
●
●
Does it identify measurable efficiency?
●
●
Does it identify measurable effectiveness?
●
●
Does it add value to the company?
●
●
Does it add value to the customers?
●
●
Is it transferable to other projects?
●
●
Does it have the potential for longevity?
●
●
Is it applicable to multiple users?
●
●
Does it differentiate us from our competitors?
●
●
Will the best practice require governance?
●
●
Will the best practice require employee training?
●
●
Is the best practice company proprietary knowledge?
One company had two unique characteristics in its best practices template:
●
●
Helps to avoid failure
●
●
In a crisis, helps to resolve a critical situation
Executives must realize that these best practices are, in fact, intellectual property to 
benefit the entire organization. If the best practice can be quantified, then it is usually easier 
to convince senior management.
For more than a decade, companies have become fascinated with the 
expression “best practices.” But now, after a decade or more of use, we 
are beginning to scrutinize the term and perhaps better expressions exist.
A best practice begins with an idea that there is a technique, process, method, or activ-
ity that can be more effective at delivering an outcome than any other approach and pro-
vides us with the desired outcome with fewer problems and unforeseen complications. As 
a result, we end up with the most efficient and effective way of accomplishing a task based 
upon a repeatable process that has been proven over time for a large number of people and/
or projects.
But once this idea has been proven to be effective, we normally integrate the best prac-
tice into our processes so that it becomes a standard way of doing business. Therefore, after 
Best Practices versus Proven 
Practices

308
The Variables for Success 
acceptance and proven use of the idea, the better expression possibly should be a “proven 
practice” rather than a best practice.
This is just one argument why best practice may be just a buzzword and should be 
replaced by proven practice.
Another argument is that the identification of a best practice may lead some to believe 
that we were performing some activities incorrectly in the past, and that may not have been 
the case. This may simply be a more efficient and effective way of achieving a deliverable. 
Another issue is that some people believe that best practices imply that there is one and 
only one way of accomplishing a task. This also may be a faulty interpretation.
Perhaps in the future the expression best practices will be replaced by proven prac-
tices. However, for the remainder of this text, we will refer to the expression as best prac-
tices, but the reader must understand that other terms may be more appropriate.
Best practices can be discovered anywhere within or outside an organi-
zation. Figure 9–1 shows various levels of best practices. The bottom 
level is the professional standards level, which would include professional standards as 
defined by PMI. The professional standards level contains the greatest number of best practices, 
but they are general rather than specific and have a low level of complexity.
The industry standards level identifies best practices related to performance within the 
industry. For example, the automotive industry has established standards and best practices 
specific to the auto industry.
As we progress to the individual best practices in Figure 9–1, the complexity of the 
best practices goes from general to very specific applications and, as expected, the quantity 
of best practices is less. An example of a best practice at each level might be (from general 
to specific):
●
●
Professional standards: Preparation and use of a risk management plan, including 
templates, guidelines, forms, and checklists for risk management.
●
●
Industry-specific: The risk management plan includes industry best practices such 
as the best way to transition from engineering to manufacturing.

●
●
Company-specific: The risk management plan identifies the roles and interactions 
of engineering, manufacturing, and quality assurance groups during transition.
●
●
Project-specific: The risk management plan identifies the roles and interactions of 
affected groups as they relate to a specific product/service for a customer.
●
●
Individual: The risk management plan identifies the roles and interactions of 
affected groups based upon their personal tolerance for risk, possibly through the 
use of a responsibility assignment matrix prepared by the project manager.
Best practices can be extremely useful during strategic planning activities. As shown 
in Figure 9–2, the bottom two levels may be more useful for project strategy formulation 
whereas the top three levels are more appropriate for the execution of a strategy.
There are several common beliefs concerning best practices. A partial 
list includes:
●
●
Because best practices can be interrelated, the identification of one best practice 
can lead to the discovery of another best practice, especially in the same category 
or level of best practices.
●
●
Because of the dependencies that can exist between best practices, it is often easier 
to identify categories of best practices rather than individual best practices.
●
●
Best practices may not be transferable. What works well for one company may not 
work for another company.
●
●
Even though some best practices seem simplistic and common sense in most com-
panies, the constant reminder and use of these best practices lead to excellence and 
customer satisfaction.
●
●
Best practices are not limited exclusively to companies in good financial health.
Companies can have the greatest intentions when implementing best practices and yet 
detrimental results can occur. Table 9–2 identifies some possible expectations and the det-
rimental results that can occur. The poor results could have been the result of poor expecta-
tions or not fully understanding the possible ramifications after implementation.

The Variables for Success 
There are other reasons why best practices can fail or provide unsatisfactory results. 
These include:
●
●
Lack of stability, clarity, or understanding of the best practice
●
●
Failure to use best practices correctly
●
●
Identifying a best practice that lacks rigor
●
●
Identifying a best practice based upon erroneous judgment
With the premise that project management knowledge and best practices 
are intellectual property, how does a company retain this information? 
The solution is usually the creation of a best practices library. Figure 9–3 shows the three 
levels of best practices that seem most appropriate for storage in a best practices library.
Figure 9–4 shows the process of creating a best practices library. The bottom level is 
the discovery and understanding of what is or is not a “potential” best practice. The sources 
for potential best practices can originate anywhere within the organization.
The next level is the evaluation level to confirm that it is a best practice. The evalua-
tion process can be done by the PMO or a committee but should have involvement by the 
senior levels of management. The evaluation process is very difficult because a one-time 
positive occurrence may not reflect a best practice. There must exist established criteria for 
the evaluation of a best practice.
Once it is agreed upon that a best practice exists, it must be classified and stored in 
some retrieval system such as a company intranet best practices library.

Figure 9–1 shows the levels of best practices, but the classification system for storage 
purposes can be significantly different. Figure 9–5 shows a typical classification system for 
a best practices library.
Another critical problem is best practices overload. One company started up a best 
practices library and, after a few years, had amassed hundreds of what were considered to 
be best practices. Nobody bothered to reevaluate whether all of these were still best prac-
tices. After reevaluation had taken place, it was determined that less than one-third of these 
were still regarded as best practices. Some were no longer best practices, others needed to 
be updated, and others had to be replaced with newer best practices.

RADIANCE INTERNATIONAL
case study
Background
Radiance International (RI) had spent more than half a decade becoming a 
global leader in managing pollution, hazard, and environmental protection 
projects for its worldwide clients. It maintained ten offices across the world with approximately 
150 people in each office. Its projects ranged from a few hundred thousand dollars to a few mil-
lion dollars and lasted from six months to two years. When the downturn in corporate spending 
began in 2008, RI saw its growth stagnate. Line managers who previously spent most of their 
time interfacing with various project teams were now spending the preponderance of their time 
writing reports and memos trying to justify their position in case downsizing occurred. Project 
teams were asked to generate additional information that the line managers needed to justify 
their existence. This took a toll on the project teams and forced team members to do “busy 
work” that was sometimes unrelated to their project responsibilities.

Management decided to reorganize the company primarily because of the 
maturity level of project management. Over the years, project management 
had matured to the point where senior management explicitly trusted the project managers to 
make both project-based and business-based decisions without continuous guidance from sen-
ior management or line management. The role of line management was simply to staff projects 
and then “get out of the way.” Some line managers remained involved in some of the projects 
but actually did more harm than good with their interference. Executive sponsorship was also 
very weak because the project managers were trusted to make the right decisions.
The decision was made to eliminate all line management and go to the concept of pool 
management. One of the line managers was designated as the pool manager and administrative-
ly responsible for the 150 employees that were now assigned to the pool. Some of the previous 
line managers were let go while others became project managers or subject matter experts with-
in the pool. Line managers that remained with the company were not asked to take a cut in pay.
In the center of the pool were the project managers. Whenever a new project came into 
the company, senior management and the pool manager would decide which project manager 
would be assigned to head up the new project. The project manager would then have the author-
ity to talk to anyone in the pool who had the expertise needed on the project. If the person stated 
that he or she was available to work on the project, the project manager would provide that 
person with a charge number authorizing budgets and schedules for his or her work packages. 
If the person overran the budget or elongated the schedule unnecessarily, the project manag-
ers would not ask this person to work on his or her project again. Pool workers who ran out of 
charge numbers or were not being used by the project managers were then terminated from the 
company. Project managers would fill out a performance review form on each worker at the 
end of the project and forward it to the pool manager. The pool manager would make the final 
decision concerning wage and salary administration but relied heavily upon the inputs from the 
project managers.
The culture fostered effective teamwork, communication, cooperation, and trust. When-
ever a problem occurred on a project, the project manager would stand up in the middle 
of the pool and state his or her crisis, and 150 people would rush to the aid of the project 
manager asking what they could do to help. The organization prided itself on effective group 
thinking and group solutions to complex projects. The system worked so well that sponsor-
ship was virtually eliminated. Once a week or even longer, a sponsor would walk into the 
office of a project manager and ask, “Are there any issues I need to know about?” If the 
project manager responds “No,” then the sponsor would say, “I’ll talk to you in a week or 
two again” and then leave.
Reorganization Plan
After two years, the concept of pool management was working better than 
expected. Projects were coming in ahead of schedule and under budget. 
Teamwork abounded throughout the organization and morale was at an all-time high in every 
RI location. Everyone embraced the new culture and nobody was terminated from the company 
after the first year of the reorganization. Business was booming even though the economy was 
weak. There was no question that RI’s approach to pool management had worked, and worked 
well! By the middle of the third year, RI’s success story appeared in business journals around 
the world. While all of the notoriety was favorable and brought in more business, RI became a 
takeover target by large construction companies that saw the acquisition of RI as an opportu-
nity. By the end of the third year, RI was acquired by a large construction firm. The construc-
tion company believed in strong line management with a span of control of approximately ten

employees per supervisor. The pool management concept at RI was eliminated; several line 
management positions were created in each RI location and staffed with employees from the 
construction company. Within a year, several employees left the company.
QUESTIONS
1.	 Is it a good idea to remove all of the line management slots?
2.	 If pool management does not work, can line management slots then be reinstated?

10.0 INTRODUCTION
In any project management environment, project managers must con-
tinually interface with executives during both the planning and exe-
cution stages. Unless the project manager understands the executive’s 
role and thought process, a poor working relationship will develop. 
In order to understand the executive–project interface, two topics are 
discussed:
●
●
The project sponsor
●
●
The in-house representatives
10.1 THE PROJECT SPONSOR
For more than two decades, the traditional role of senior manage-
ment, as far as projects were concerned, has been to function as pro-
ject sponsors.
The project sponsor usually comes from the executive levels 
and has the primary responsibility of maintaining executive–client contact. The sponsor 
ensures that the correct information from the contractor’s organization is reaching execu-
tives in the customer’s organization, that there is no filtering of information from the con-
tractor to the customer, and that someone at the executive levels is making sure that the 
customer’s money is being spent wisely. The project sponsor will normally transmit cost 
and deliverables information to the customer, whereas schedule and performance status 
data come from the project manager.

In addition to executive–client contact, the sponsor also provides guidance on:
●
●
Objective setting
●
●
Priority setting
●
●
Project organizational structure
●
●
Project policies and procedures
●
●
Project master planning
●
●

●

●

●
●
Conflict resolution
Sponsor-Project Interface
The role of the project sponsor takes on different dimensions based 
on the life-cycle phase the project is in. During the planning/initiation 
phase of a project, the sponsor normally functions in an active role, which includes such 
activities as:
●
●
Assisting the project manager in establishing the correct objectives for the project
●
●
Providing the project manager with information on the environmental/political 
factors that could influence the project’s execution
●
●
Establishing the priority for the project (either individually or through consultation 
with other executives) and informing the project manager of the established prior-
ity and the reason for the priority
●
●
Providing guidance for the establishment of policies and procedures by which to 
govern the project
●
●
Functioning as the executive–client contact point
During the initiation or kickoff phase of a project, the project sponsor must be actively 
involved in setting objectives and priorities. It is absolutely mandatory that the executives 
establish the priorities in both business and technical terms.
During the execution phase of the project, the role of the executive sponsor is more 
passive than active. The sponsor will provide assistance to the project manager on an as-
needed basis except for routine status briefings.
During the execution stage of a project, the sponsor must be selective in the problems 
that he or she wishes to help resolve. Trying to get involved in every problem will not only 
result in severe micromanagement, but will undermine the project manager’s ability to get 
the job done.
The role of the sponsor is similar to that of a referee. Table 10–1 shows the work-
ing relationship between the project manager and the line managers in both mature and 
immature organizations. When conflicts or problems exist in the project–line interface and 
cannot be resolved at that level, the sponsor might find it necessary to step in and provide 
assistance. Table 10–2 shows the mature and immature ways that a sponsor interfaces with 
the project.

• There is visible, ongoing support.
• Executive encourages bringing problems upstairs.
• Executive is committed to sponsorship (and ownership).
• Executive support exists on a continuous basis.
• Executive encourages business decisions to be made.
• Sponsorship assignment procedures are visible.
• Executives seek what is possible.
• Executive recognizes the importance of a charter.
• Executive takes responsibility for charter preparation.
• Executive understands the content of a charter.
• Executives trust that performance is taking place.
It should be understood that the sponsor exists for everyone on the 
project, including the line managers and their employees. Project spon-
sors must maintain open-door policies, even though maintaining an open-door policy can 
have detrimental effects. First, employees may flood the sponsor with trivial items. Second, 
employees may feel that they can bypass levels of management and converse directly with 
the sponsor. The moral here is that employees, including the project manager, must be 
encouraged to be careful about how many times and under what circumstances they “go 
to the well.”
In addition to his/her normal functional job, the sponsor must be available to provide 
as-needed assistance to the projects. Sponsorship can become a time-consuming effort, 
especially if problems occur. Therefore, executives are limited as to how many projects 
they can sponsor effectively at the same time.
If an executive has to function as a sponsor on several problems at once, problems can 
occur such as:
●
●
Slow decision making, resulting in problem-solving delays
●
●
Policy issues that remain unresolved and impact decisions
●
●
Inability to prioritize projects when necessary
Sponsor Function

320
Working with Executives 
As an organization matures in project management, executives begin to trust middle- 
and lower-level management to function as sponsors. There are several reasons for 
supporting this:
●
●
Executives do not have time to function as sponsors on each and every project.
●
●
Not all projects require sponsorship from the executive levels.
●
●
Middle management is closer to where the work is being performed.
●
●
Middle management is in a better position to provide advice on certain risks.
●
●
Project personnel have easier access to middle management.
Sometimes executives in large diversified corporations are extremely busy with strate-
gic planning activities and simply do not have the time to properly function as a sponsor. In 
such cases, sponsorship falls one level below senior management.
Figure 10–1 shows the major functions of a project sponsor. At the onset of a project, 
a senior committee meets to decide whether a given project should be deemed as priority

or nonpriority. If the project is critical or strategic, then the committee may assign a senior 
manager as the sponsor, perhaps even a member of the committee. It is common practice 
for steering committee executives to function as sponsors for the projects that the steering 
committee oversees.
For projects that are routine, maintenance, or noncritical, a sponsor could be assigned 
from the middle-management levels. This generates an atmosphere of management buy-in 
at the critical middle levels.
Not all projects need a project sponsor. Sponsorship is generally needed on those pro-
jects that require a multitude of resources or a large amount of integration between func-
tional lines or that have the potential for disruptive conflicts or the need for strong customer 
communications. Quite often customers wish to make sure that the contractor’s project 
manager is spending funds prudently. Customers therefore like it when an executive spon-
sor supervises the project manager’s funding allocation.
It is common practice for companies that are heavily involved in competitive bidding 
to identify in their proposal not only the resume of the project manager, but the resume of 
the executive project sponsor as well. This may give the bidder a competitive advantage, 
all other things being equal, because customers believe they have a direct path of com-
munications to executive management. One such contractor identified the functions of the 
executive project sponsor as follows:
●
●
Major participation in sales effort and contract negotiations
●
●
Establishes and maintains top-level client relationships
●
●
Assists project manager in getting the project underway (planning, procedures, 
staffing, etc.)
●
●
Maintains current knowledge of major project activities (receives copies of major 
correspondence and reports, attends major client and project review meetings, vis-
its project regularly, etc.)
●
●
Handles major contractual matters
●
●
Interprets company policy for the project manager
●
●
Assists project manager in identifying and solving major problems
●
●
Keeps general management and company management advised of major problems
Historically, the role of the sponsor was almost exclusively interfacing 
with just the project manager. This was particularly true for small- to 
medium-size projects. Today, we are working on projects that are highly complex, requir-
ing the sponsor to interface with the entire project team. As such, new responsibilities are 
being added in to the role of the sponsor. Some of these are:
●
●
Maintaining close contact with the entire team throughout the project
●
●
Preparing and endorsing the project’s charter
●
●
Making sure that the project manager has the appropriate authority for the deci-
sions that must be made throughout the project
●
●
Making sure that the project has the appropriate priority
●
●
Explaining the reasons for the priority to the project team

Consider a project that is broken down into two life-cycle phases: plan-
ning and execution. For short-duration projects, say two years or less, 
it is advisable for the project sponsor to be the same individual for the entire project. For 
long-term projects of five years or so, it is possible to have a different project sponsor for 
each life-cycle phase, but preferably from the same level of management. The sponsor does 
not have to come from the same line organization as the one where the majority of the work 
will be taking place. Some companies even go so far as demanding that the sponsor come 
from a line organization that has no vested interest in the project.
The project sponsor is actually a “big brother” or advisor for the project manager. 
Under no circumstances should the project sponsor try to function as the project manager. 
The project sponsor should assist the project manager in solving those problems that the 
project manager cannot resolve by himself.
Multiple Project Sponsors

In some industries, such as construction, the project sponsor is identi-
fied in the proposal, and thus everyone knows who it is. Unfortunately, 
there are situations where the project sponsor is “hidden,” and the project manager may 
not realize who it is, or know if the customer realizes who it is. This concept of invisible 
sponsorship occurs most frequently at the executive level and is referred to as absentee 
sponsorship.
There are several ways that invisible sponsorship can occur. The first is when the man-
ager who is appointed as a sponsor refuses to act as a sponsor for fear that poor decisions or 
an unsuccessful project could have a negative impact on his or her career. The second type 
results when an executive really does not understand either sponsorship or project manage-
ment and simply provides lip service to the sponsorship function. The third way involves 
an executive who is already overburdened and simply does not have the time to perform 
meaningfully as a sponsor. The fourth way occurs when the project manager refuses to 
keep the sponsor informed and involved. The sponsor may believe that everything is flow-
ing smoothly and that he is not needed.
Some people contend that the best way for the project manager to work with an invis-
ible sponsor is for the project manager to make a decision and then send a memo to the 
sponsor stating, “This is the decision that I have made and, unless I hear from you in the 
next 48 hours, I will assume that you agree with my decision.”
The opposite extreme is the sponsor who micromanages. One way for the project man-
ager to handle this situation is to bury the sponsor with work in hopes that he will let go.
Unfortunately this could end up reinforcing the sponsor’s belief that what he is doing 
is correct. The better alternative for handling a micromanaging sponsor is to ask for role 
clarification. The project manager should try working with the sponsor to define the roles 
of project manager and project sponsor more clearly.
The invisible sponsor and the overbearing sponsor are not as detrimental as the “can’t-
say-no” sponsor. When a sponsor continuously says “yes” to the customer, everyone in the 
contractor’s organization eventually suffers.
Sometimes the existence of a sponsor can do more harm than good, especially if the 
sponsor focuses on the wrong objectives around which to make decisions.
It’s necessary to have a sponsor who understands project management rather than one 
who simply assists in decision making. The goals and objectives of the sponsor must be 
aligned with the goals and objectives of the project, and they must be realistic. If sponsor-
ship is to exist at the executive levels, the sponsor must be visible and constantly informed 
concerning the project status.
Invisible Sponsors
When dealing with external stakeholders on global projects, there are 
significant unknowns that can influence the direction of the project. It 
may not be easy to identify the stakeholders. To make matters worse, global projects are 
implemented in complex environments that are highly impacted by sociopolitical factors. 
Some of the critical factors when dealing with global stakeholders include:
●
●
Not all of the stakeholders are easily identifiable.
●
●
There are significantly more stakeholders than on non-nonglobal projects.
●
●
Global stakeholders are more likely to change over the duration of the project.

●
●
There may be hidden stakeholders higher up in the organizational hierarchy than 
the project’s visible global stakeholders.
●
●
Not all of the issues facing the stakeholders are easy identified.
●
●
Solutions to problems on the project may need to be resolved higher up than the 
global stakeholders.
●
●
Not all issues with global stakeholders can be resolved the same way we resolve 
issues with nonglobal stakeholders.
●
●
Global stakeholders may have more hidden agendas than with nonglobal stake-
holders.
●
●
Conflicts with global stakeholders may need to be approached with a different set 
of conflict resolution modes than we use on traditional projects.
Aaltonen and Sivonen have written a paper discussing conflict resolution modes for 
dealing with stakeholder pressure on global projects. In their paper, they discuss five con-
flict resolution strategies:1
●
●
Adaptation strategy: obeying stakeholder rules, policies and procedures
●
●
Compromising strategy: negotiation and dialogue
●
●
Avoidance strategy: loosening attachments to the stakeholders
●
●
Dismissal strategy: ignoring their demands
●
●
Influence strategy: shaping proactively the demands of the stakeholders
Emerging market global stakeholders can respond differently to issues than global 
stakeholders in other markets. It is of critical importance to understand the operating and 
cultural environment in which the global stakeholders reside.
For years companies have assigned a single individual as the sponsor 
for a project. The risk was that the sponsor would show favoritism to 
his line group and suboptimal decision making would occur. Recently, companies have 
begun looking at sponsorship by committee to correct this.
Committee sponsorship is common in those organizations committed to concurrent engi-
neering and shortening product development time. Committees are composed of middle man-
agers from marketing, R&D, and operations. The idea is that the committee will be able to 
make decisions in the best interest of the company more easily than a single individual could.
Committee sponsorship also has its limitations. At the executive levels, it is almost 
impossible to find time when senior managers can convene. For a company with a large 
number of projects, committee sponsorship may not be a viable approach.
In time of crisis, project managers may need immediate access to their sponsors. If 
the sponsor is a committee, then how does the project manager get the committee to con-
vene quickly? Also, individual project sponsors may be more dedicated than committees. 
Committee sponsorship has been shown to work well if one, and only one, member of the 
committee acts as the prime sponsor for a given project.
Committee Sponsorship

tional Journal of Project Management, 27 (2009) 131–141.

During status reporting, a project manager can wave either a red, yel-
low, or green flag. This is known as the “traffic light” reporting system. 
For each element in the status report, the project manager will illuminate one of three lights 
according to the following criteria:
●
●
Green light: Work is progressing as planned. Sponsor involvement is not 
necessary.
●
●
Yellow light: A potential problem may exist. The sponsor is informed but no action 
by the sponsor is necessary at this time.
●
●
Red light: A problem exists that may affect time, cost, scope, or quality. Sponsor 
involvement is necessary.
Yellow flags are warnings that should be resolved at the middle levels of management 
or lower.
If the project manager waves a red flag, then the sponsor will probably wish to be 
actively involved. Red flag problems can affect the time, cost, or performance constraints 
of the project and an immediate decision must be made. The main function of the sponsor 
is to assist in making the best possible decision in a timely fashion.
Both project sponsors and project managers should not encourage employees to come 
to them with problems unless the employees also bring alternatives and recommendations. 
Usually, employees will solve most of their own problems once they prepare alternatives 
and recommendations.
Good corporate cultures encourage people to bring problems to the surface quickly 
for resolution. The quicker the potential problem is identified, the more opportunities are 
available for resolution.
Some companies use more than three colors to indicate project status. One company 
also has an orange light for activities that are still being performed after the target mile-
stone date.
When to Seek Help
As project management matures, executives decentralize project spon-
sorship to middle- and lower-level management. Senior management 
then takes on new roles such as:
●
●
Establishing a Center for Excellence in project management
●
●
Establishing a project office or centralized project management function
●
●
Creating a project management career path
●
●
Creating a mentorship program for newly appointed project managers
●
●
Creating an organization committed to benchmarking best practices in project 
management in other organizations
●
●
Providing strategic information for risk management
Because of the pressure placed upon the project manager for schedule compression, 
risk management could very well become the single most critical skill for project manag-
ers. Executives will find it necessary to provide project management with strategic business 
intelligence, assist in risk identification, and evaluate or prioritize risk-handling options.

Executive
The Project Sponsor

One of the questions facing senior management in the assigning of 
a project sponsor is whether or not the sponsor should have a vested 
interest in the project or be an impartial outsider. Table 10–3 shows the pros and cons of 
this. Sponsors who do not have a vested interest in the project seem to function more as exit 
champions than project sponsors.
Active versus Passive 
Involvement
Table 10–3.  Vested Interest or Not?
Vested Interest
Impartial
• Finance the fund-starved project
• Keep project alive
• Maximum protection from obstacles
• Fend off internal enemies
• Actively involved
• Involved in personnel assignments
• Provide no funding and limited support
• Let project die
• Limited protection from obstacles
• Avoid politics and enemies
• Go through motions
• Partial involvement in assignment
Technically oriented team members are motivated not only by 
meeting specifications, but also by exceeding them. Unfortunately, 
exceeding specifications can be quite costly. Project managers 
must monitor scope creep and develop plans for controlling 
scope changes. But what if it is the project manager who initiates  
scope creep? The project sponsor must meet periodically with the project manager to 
review the scope baseline changes or unauthorized changes may occur and significant 
cost increases will result.
Managing Scope Creep
Executive champions are needed for those activities that require the 
implementation of change, such as a new corporate methodology for 
project management. Executive champions “drive” the implementation of project manage-
ment down into the organization and accelerate its acceptance because their involvement 
implies executive-level support and interest.
The Executive Champion
Simply because an executive is placed on a project governance com-
mittee is no guarantee that the correct decisions will be made. Execu-
tives are prone to making mistakes just like everyone else. Even though it is a thin line 
between governance failures and project failures, poor decisions by a governance commit-
tee can be more costly than poor decisions made by a project manager.
Some of the reasons why projects fail because of governance issues include:
●
●
Lessons learned on projects or previous governance committee assignments are 
not captured or known by the governance committee
●
●
Refusal to listen to the concerns of the project manager
●
●
Making political rather than project decisions
●
●
Making decisions for a given project without understanding the impact on other 
projects
●
●

●
●
Refusing to pull the plug on a failing project
●
●

●
●
Not validating the business case
As the need for governance committees increases, we run the risk that the people that 
serve on these committees may not fully understand project management. The result may 
be decisions that appear in the best interest of the project but at the same time can have 
a detrimental effect on project management. An example is a significant change in scope 
that could mandate that many of the existing resources be replaced with people that have 
a different skill set.
10.2 HANDLING DISAGREEMENTS WITH THE SPONSOR
What if the project manager believes that the sponsor has made the wrong decision? Should 
the project manager have a recourse for action in such a situation?
There are several reasons why disagreements between the project manager and project 
sponsor occur. First, the project sponsors may not have sufficient technical knowledge 
or information to evaluate the risks of any potential decision. Second, sponsors may be 
heavily burdened with other activities and unable to devote sufficient time to sponsorship. 
Third, some companies prefer to assign sponsors who have no vested interest in the project 
in hopes of getting impartial decision making. Finally, sponsorship may be pushed down 
to a middle-management level where the assigned sponsor may not have all of the business 
knowledge necessary to make the best decisions.
Project managers are expected to challenge the project’s assumptions continuously. 
This could lead to trade-offs. It could also lead to disagreements and conflicts between the 
project manager and the project sponsor. In such cases, the conflict will be brought to the 
executive steering committee for resolution. Sponsors must understand that their decisions 
as a sponsor can and should be challenged by the project manager.
Recognizing that these conflicts can exist, companies are instituting executive steering 
committees or executive policy board committees to quickly resolve these disputes. Few 
conflicts ever make it to the executive steering committee, but those that do are usually 
severe and may expose the company to unwanted risks.
A common conflict that may end up at the executive steering committee level happens 
when one party wants to cancel the project and the second party wants to continue.
10.3 THE COLLECTIVE BELIEF
Some projects, especially very long-term projects, often mandate that a collective belief 
exist. The collective belief is a fervent, and perhaps blind, desire to achieve that can perme-
ate the entire team, the project sponsor, and even the most senior levels of management. 
The collective belief can make a rational organization act in an irrational manner. This is 
particularly true if the project sponsor spearheads the collective belief.

328
Working with Executives 
When a collective belief exists, people are selected based upon their support for the 
collective belief. Nonbelievers are pressured into supporting the collective belief and team 
members are not allowed to challenge the results. As the collective belief grows, both advo-
cates and nonbelievers are trampled. The pressure of the collective belief can outweigh the 
reality of the results.
There are several characteristics of the collective belief, which is why some large, 
high-technology projects are often difficult to kill:
●
●
Inability or refusal to recognize failure
●
●
Refusing to see the warning signs
●
●
Seeing only what you want to see
●
●
Fearful of exposing mistakes
●
●
Viewing bad news as a personal failure
●
●
Viewing failure as a sign of weakness
●
●
Viewing failure as damage to one’s career
●
●
Viewing failure as damage to one’s reputation
10.4 THE EXIT CHAMPION
Project sponsors and project champions do everything possible to make their project suc-
cessful. But what if the project champions, as well as the project team, have blind faith in 
the success of the project? What happens if the strongly held convictions and the collective 
belief disregard the early warning signs of imminent danger? What happens if the collec-
tive belief drowns out dissent?
In such cases, an exit champion must be assigned. The exit champion sometimes 
needs to have some direct involvement in the project in order to have credibility, but direct 
involvement is not always a necessity. Exit champions must be willing to put their reputa-
tion on the line and possibly face the likelihood of being cast out from the project team.
The larger the project and the greater the financial risk to the firm, the higher up the 
exit champion should reside. If the project champion just happens to be the CEO, then 
someone on the board of directors or even the entire board of directors should assume the 
role of the exit champion. Unfortunately, there are situations where the collective belief 
permeates the entire board of directors. In this case, the collective belief can force the board 
of directors to shirk their responsibility for oversight.
Large projects incur large cost overruns and schedule slippages. Making the decision 
to cancel such a project, once it has started, is very difficult.
The longer the project, the greater the necessity for the exit champions and project 
sponsors to make sure that the business plan has “exit ramps” such that the project can be 
terminated before massive resources are committed and consumed. Unfortunately, when a 
collective belief exists, exit ramps are purposefully omitted from the project and business 
plans. Another reason for having exit champions is so that the project closure process can 
occur as quickly as possible. As projects approach their completion, team members often 
have apprehension about their next assignment and try to stretch out the existing project 

Stakeholder Relations Management
329
until they are ready to leave. In this case, the role of the exit champion is to accelerate the 
closure process without impacting the integrity of the project.
Some organizations use members of a portfolio review board to function as exit cham-
pions. Portfolio review boards have the final say in project selection. They also have the 
final say as to whether or not a project should be terminated. Usually, one member of the 
board functions as the exit champion and makes the final presentation to the remainder of 
the board.
10.5 THE IN-HOUSE REPRESENTATIVES
On high-risk, high-priority projects or during periods of mistrust, customers may wish to 
place in-house representatives in the contractor’s plant. These representatives, if treated 
properly, are like additional project office personnel who are not supported by your budget. 
They are invaluable resources for reading rough drafts of reports and making recommenda-
tions as to how their company may wish to see the report organized.
In-house representatives are normally not situated in or near the contractor’s project 
office because of the project manager’s need for some degree of privacy. The exception 
would be in the design phase of a construction project, where it is imperative to design 
what the customer wants and to obtain quick decisions and approvals.
Most in-house representatives know where their authority begins and ends. Some com-
panies demand that in-house representatives have a project office escort when touring the 
plant, talking to functional employees, or simply observing the testing and manufacturing 
of components.
It is possible to have a disruptive in-house representative removed from the com-
pany. This usually requires strong support from the project sponsor in the contractor’s 
shop. The important point here is that executives and project sponsors must maintain 
proper contact with and control over the in-house representatives, perhaps more so than 
the project manager.
10.6 STAKEHOLDER RELATIONS MANAGEMENT
As projects become larger and more complex, the role of the sponsor 
is undertaken by a governance committee where the project sponsor 
is just one member of the committee. The relationship between the 
sponsor and the other stakeholders becomes critical.
Stakeholders are, in one way or another, individuals, companies, or organizations that 
may be affected by the outcome of the project or the way in which the project is managed. 
Stakeholders may be either directly or indirectly involved throughout the project or may 
function simply as observers. Stakeholders can shift from a passive role to becoming an

Sons and IIL, 2010), Chapter 10.

Chapter 13 Project Stakeholder 
­Management

330
Working with Executives 
active member of the team and participate in critical decisions. Active stakeholders basi-
cally function as sponsors.
On small or traditional projects, project managers generally interface with just the 
project sponsor as the primary stakeholder, and the sponsor usually is assigned from the 
organization that funds the project. This is true for both internal and external projects. But 
the larger the project, the greater the number of stakeholders with which you must inter-
face. The situation becomes even more potentially problematic if you have a large number 
of stakeholders, geographically dispersed, all at different levels of management in their 
respective hierarchy, each with a different level of authority, and language and cultural dif-
ferences. Trying to interface with all of these people on a regular basis and make decisions, 
especially on a large, complex project is very time-consuming.
One of the complexities of stakeholder relations management is figur-
ing out how to do all of this without sacrificing your company’s long-
term mission or vision. Also, your company may have long-term objectives in mind for this 
project, and those objectives may not necessarily be aligned to the project’s objectives or 
each stakeholder’s objectives. Lining up all the stakeholders in a row and getting them uni-
formly to agree to all decisions is more wishful thinking than reality. You may discover that 
it is impossible to get all the stakeholders to agree, and you must simply hope to placate as 
many as possible at a given point in time.
Stakeholder relations management cannot work effectively without commitments 
from all of the stakeholders. Obtaining these commitments can be difficult if the stakehold-
ers cannot see what’s in it for them at the completion of the project, namely the value that 
they expect or other personal interests. The problem is that what one stakeholder perceives 
as value may be perceived to have a different value by another stakeholder. For example, 
one stakeholder could view the project as a symbol of prestige. Another stakeholder could 
perceive the value as simply keeping their people employed. A third stakeholder could 
see value in the final deliverables of the project and the inherent quality in it. And a fourth 
stakeholder could see the project as an opportunity for future work with particular clients.
Another form of agreement involves developing a consensus on how stakeholders will 
interact with each other. It may be necessary for certain stakeholders to interact with one 
another and support one another with regard to sharing resources, providing financial sup-
port in a timely manner, and the sharing of intellectual property. While all stakeholders 
recognize the necessity for these agreements, they can be impacted by politics, economic 
conditions, and other enterprise environmental factors that may be beyond the control of 
the project manager. Certain countries may not be willing to work with other countries 
because of culture, religion, views on human rights, and other such factors.
For the project manager, obtaining these agreements right at the beginning of the pro-
ject is essential. Some project managers are fortunate in being able to do this while others 
are not.
It is important to realize that not all of the stakeholders may want the project to be suc-
cessful. This will happen if stakeholders believe that, at the completion of the project, they 
may lose power, authority, hierarchical positions in their company, or in a worse case even 
lose their job. Sometimes these stakeholders will either remain silent or even be supporters 
of the project until the end date approaches. If the project is regarded as unsuccessful, these 
Commitments

stakeholders may respond by saying, “I told you so.” If it appears that the project may be a 
success, these stakeholders may suddenly transform from supporters or the silent majority 
to adversaries.
It is very difficult to identify stakeholders with hidden agendas. These people can hide 
their true feelings and be reluctant to share information. There are often no telltale or early 
warning signs that indicate their true belief in the project. However, if the stakeholders are 
reluctant to approve scope changes, provide additional investment, or assign highly quali-
fied resources, this could be an indication that they may have lost confidence in the project.
Not all stakeholders understand project management. Not all stake-
holders understand the role of a project sponsor. And not all stakehold-
ers understand how to interface with a project or the project manager even though they may 
readily accept and support the project and its mission. Simply stated, the majority of the 
stakeholders are never trained in how to function properly as a stakeholder. Unfortunately, 
this cannot be detected early on but may become apparent as the project progresses.
Some stakeholders may be under the impression that they are merely observers and 
need not participate in decision making or authorization of scope changes. For some stake-
holders who desire to be just observers, this could be a rude awakening. Some will accept 
the new role while others will not. Those that do not accept the new role usually are fearful 
that participating in a decision that turns out to be wrong can be the end of their political 
career.
Some stakeholders view their role as that of micromanagers, often usurping the author-
ity of the project manager by making decisions that they may not necessarily be authorized 
to make, at least not alone. Stakeholders that attempt to micromanage can do significantly 
more harm to the project than stakeholders that remain as observers.
It may be a good idea for the project manager to prepare a list of expectations that he or 
she has of the stakeholders. This is essential even though stakeholders support the existence 
of the project. Role clarification for stakeholders should be accomplished early on the same 
way that the project manager provides role clarification for the team members at the initial 
kickoff meeting for the project.
The present view of stakeholder relations management has changed as 
a result of the implementation of “engagement project management” 
practices. In the past, whenever a sale was made to the client, the salesperson would then 
move on to find a new client. Salespeople viewed themselves as providers of products and/
or services. Today, salespeople view themselves as the provider of business solutions. In 
other words, salespeople now tell the client that we can provide you with a solution to all 
of your business needs and what we want in exchange is to be treated as a strategic business 
partner. This benefits both the buyer and seller because:
●
●
Not all companies (buyers) have the ability to manage complexity.
●
●
Solution providers must learn while managing the project.
●
●
Solution providers can bring years of history to the table.
●
●
Solution providers have a greater understanding of cultural change, the ability to 
work within almost any culture, and an understanding of virtual teams.

Therefore, as a solution provider, the project manager focuses heavily on the future 
and a long-term partnership agreement with the client and the stakeholders. This focus is 
heavily oriented toward value rather than near-term profitability.
Stakeholder relations management begins with stakeholder identifica-
tion. This is easier said than done, especially if the project is multi-
national. Stakeholders can exist at any level of management. Corporate stakeholders are 
often easier to identify than political or government stakeholders. Each stakeholder is an 
essential piece of the project puzzle. Stakeholders must work together and usually interact 
with the project through the governance process. Therefore it is essential to know which 
stakeholders will participate in governance and which will not.
As part of stakeholder identification, the project manager must know whether he or she 
has the authority or perceived status to interface with the stakeholders. Some stakeholders 
perceive themselves as higher stature than the project manager and, in this case, the project 
sponsor may be the person to maintain interactions.
There are several ways in which stakeholders can be identified. More than one way 
can be used on projects:
●
●
Groups: This could include financial institutions, creditors, regulatory agencies, 
and the like.
●
●
Individuals: This could be by name or title, such as the CIO, COO, CEO, or just 
the name of the contact person in the stakeholder’s organization.
●
●
Contribution: This could be according to financial contributor, resource contribu-
tor, or technology contributor.
●
●
Other factors: This could be according to the authority to make decisions or other 
such factors.
It is important to understand that not all stakeholders have the same expectations of 
a project. Some stakeholders may want the project to succeed at any cost, whereas other 
stakeholders may prefer to see the project fail even though they openly seem to support 
it. Some stakeholders view success as the completion of the project regardless of the cost 
overruns, whereas others may define success in financial terms only. Some stakeholders 
are heavily oriented toward the value they expect to see in the project, and this is the only 
definition of success for them. The true value may not be seen until months after the pro-
ject has been completed. Some stakeholders may view the project as their opportunity for 
public notice and increased stature and therefore want to be actively involved. Others may 
prefer a more passive involvement.
Stakeholder Identification
On large, complex projects with a multitude of stakeholders, it may be 
impossible for the project manager to properly cater to all of the stake-
holders. Therefore, the project manager must know who the most influential stakeholders are 
and who can provide the greatest support on the project. Typical questions to ask might include:
●
●
Who are powerful and who are not?
●
●
Who will have or require direct or indirect involvement?
●
●
Who has the power to kill the project?
Stakeholder Analysis

●
●
What is the urgency of the deliverables?
●
●
Who may require more or less information than others?
Not all stakeholders are equal in influence, power, or authority to make decisions in a 
timely manner. It is imperative for the project manager to know who sits on the top of the 
list as having these capabilities.
Finally, it is important to remember that stakeholders can change over the life of a 
project, especially if it is a long-term project. Also, the importance of certain stakeholders 
can change over the life of a project and in each life-cycle phase. The stakeholder list is 
therefore an organic document subject to change.
Stakeholder mapping is most frequently displayed on a grid comparing their power 
and their level of interest. This is shown in Figure 10–2. The four cells can be defined as:
●
●
Manage closely: These are high-power, interested people who can make or break 
your project. You must put forth the greatest effort to satisfy them. Be aware that 
there are factors that can cause them to change quadrants rapidly.
●
●
Keep satisfied: These are high-power, less interested people who can also make 
or break your project. You must put forth some effort to satisfy them but not with 
excessive detail that can lead to boredom and total disinterest. They may not get 
involved until the end of the project approaches.
●
●
Keep informed: These are people with limited power but who are keenly interested 
in the project. They can function as an early-warning system of approaching prob-
lems and may be technically astute to assist with some technical issues. These are 
the stakeholders who often provide hidden opportunities.
●
●
Monitor only: These are people with limited power who may not be interested in 
the project unless a disaster occurs. Provide them with some information but not 
with too much detail such that they will become disinterested or bored.

Working with Executives 
Stakeholder engagement is when you physically meet with the stake-
holders and determine their needs and expectations. As part of this, 
you must:
●
●
Understand them and their expectations
●
●
Understand their needs
●
●
Value their opinions
●
●
Find ways to win their support on a continuous basis
●
●
Identify any stakeholder problems early on that can influence the project
Even though stakeholder engagement follows stakeholder identification, it is often 
through stakeholder engagement that we determine which stakeholders are supporters, 
advocates, neutral, or opponents. This may also be viewed as the first step in building a 
trusting relationship between the project manager and the stakeholders.
As part of stakeholder engagements, it is necessary for the project man-
ager to understand each stakeholder’s interests. One of the ways to 
accomplish this is to ask the stakeholders (usually the key stakeholders) what information 
they would like to see in performance reports. This information will help identify the key 
performance indicators (KPI) needed to service this stakeholder.
Each stakeholder may have a different set of KPI interests. It then becomes a costly 
endeavor for the project manager to maintain multiple KPI tracking and reporting flows, 
but it is a necessity for successful stakeholder relations management. Getting all of the 
stakeholders to agree on a uniform set of KPI reports and dashboards may be almost 
impossible.
There must be an agreement on what information is needed for each stakeholder, when 
the information is needed, and in what format the information will be presented. Some 
stakeholders may want a daily or weekly information flow whereas others may be happy 
with monthly data. For the most part, the information will be provided via the Internet.
The need for effective stakeholder communications is clear:
●
●
Communicating with stakeholders on a regular basis is a necessity.
●
●
By knowing the stakeholders, you may be able to anticipate their actions.
●
●
Effective stakeholder communications builds trust.
●
●
Virtual teams thrive on effective stakeholder communications.
●
●
Although we classify stakeholders by groups or organizations, we still communi-
cate with people.
●
●
Ineffective stakeholder communications can cause a supporter to become a blocker.
There are three additional critical factors that must be considered for successful stake 
holder relations management:
●
●
Effective stakeholder relations management takes time. It may be necessary 
to share this responsibility with the sponsor, executives, and members of the 
project team.

●
●
Based upon the number of stakeholders, it may not be possible to address their 
concerns face-to-face. You must maximize your ability to communicate via the 
Internet. This is also important when managing virtual teams.
●
●
Regardless of the number of stakeholders, documentation on the working relation-
ships with the stakeholders must be archived. This is critical for success on future 
projects.
Effective stakeholder relations management can be the difference between an out-
standing success and a terrible failure. Successful stakeholder relations management can 
result in binding agreements. The resulting benefits may be:
●
●
Better decision making and in a more timely manner
●
●
Better control of scope changes; prevention of unnecessary changes
●
●
Follow-on work from stakeholders
●
●
End-user satisfaction and loyalty
●
●
Minimize the impact that politics can have on your project
Sometimes, regardless of how hard we try, we will fail at stakeholder relations man-
agement. Typical reasons include:
●
●
Inviting stakeholders to participate too early, thus encouraging scope changes and 
costly delays
●
●
Inviting stakeholders to participate too late such that their views cannot be consid-
ered without costly delays
●
●
Inviting the wrong stakeholders to participate in critical decisions, thus leading to 
unnecessary changes and criticism by key stakeholders
●
●
Key stakeholders becoming disinterested in the project
●
●
Key stakeholders becoming impatient with the lack of progress
●
●
Allowing the key stakeholders to believe that their contributions are meaningless
●
●
Managing the project with an unethical leadership style or interfacing with the 
stakeholders in an unethical manner
10.7 PROJECT PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT
One of the downside risks of even good project management prac-
tices is that project decision making is often suboptimized whereby 
decisions can be made for what is in the best interest of one project 
rather than what is in the best interest of the portfolio of projects. Some of the shortcomings 
that companies face include:
●
●
Intense competition for critical resources
●
●
Lack of a prioritization system
●
●
Even if a prioritization system exists, having too many scope changes that result 
in significant project rework
PMBOK® Guide, 6th Edition
1.2.3.3 Portfolio Management

336
Working with Executives 
●
●
Inability to align projects to business strategies
●
●
Unable to recognize the benefits and value of projects as part of the project 
approval process
●
●
Working on too many non-value-added projects
To alleviate these problems, companies are now embarking upon project portfolio 
management practices. A portfolio is a grouping of projects and programs, usually those 
that are considered strategic in nature, and may be necessary for the survival of the firm. 
The portfolio can be limited to the ten or twelve most critical projects whereas there could 
be hundreds of other projects being worked on at the same time.  There can be several dif-
ferent portfolios of projects in the same company.
Portfolio management is the centralization of the management of the processes, meth-
ods, and technologies used by the project managers to make sure that the value of the 
portfolio is maximized and that the projects are aligned to strategic business objectives. 
The portfolio governance committee is made up of sponsors and stakeholders whose func-
tion is to determine if a business opportunity exists, select the right projects to take advan-
tage of this opportunity, prioritize the projects if necessary, and determine the optimal mix 
of resources both human and nonhuman based upon existing resource capacity, financial 
controls, scope change control, and portfolio risk management. Project managers who are 
managing portfolio projects usually report to the portfolio governance committee as well 
as any other sponsors who may be needed for this project.
On a macro level, portfolio governance committees are expected to make informed 
decisions in order to answer the following three critical questions related to the entire 
portfolio:
●
●
Are we doing the right projects?
●
●
Are we doing the right projects the right way?
●
●
Are we doing enough of the right projects?
On a micro or individual project level, the portfolio governance committee’s respon-
sibilities are to:
●
●
Verify that value is being created
●
●
Know the risks and how risks are being mitigated
●
●
Know when to intervene
●
●
Know when to pull the plug on poorly performing projects
●
●
Predict future corporate performance
●
●
Confirm that the projects are still aligned to strategic objectives
●
●
Perform resource reoptimization if necessary
●
●
Know when to reprioritize projects if necessary
Based upon the information provided, the governance committee must then periodi-
cally assess:
●
●
Do we have any weak investments that need to be canceled or replaced?
●
●
Must any of the programs and/or projects be consolidated?

Politics
337
●
●
Must any of the projects be accelerated or decelerated?
●
●
How well are we aligned to strategic objectives?
●
●
Does the portfolio have to be rebalanced?
For the governance committee to make informed decisions, they need evidence based 
upon metrics other than time, cost, and scope. Traditionally, these were the three primary 
reported metrics. But today, because of competing constraints, project managers may have 
to report ten to twelve metrics, and many of them are business-oriented metrics rather than 
traditional metrics. As stated in Chapter 1, today’s project managers are becoming more 
business-oriented.
10.8 POLITICS
Every young and/or inexperienced project manager embarks upon 
their first project with “stars in their eyes” thinking this will be 
a great achievement for them. Then, often without warning, the 
reality of project politics, external politics, or both sets in and the 
delusions of grandeur are replaced by “What have I gotten myself into?” It is natural 
for people to make decisions based upon what’s in it for them. As an example, politics 
can occur when:
●
●
Trying to define the project’s requirements and disagreements exist among all of 
the stakeholders
●
●
Creating the statement of work
●
●
Negotiating for resources that must service multiple projects
●
●
Having to prepare a schedule around the preferences of the team members
●
●
Having conflicts over priorities
●
●
Trying to explain the reasons for unfavorable variances
The list could go on and on. Politics will occur and project sponsors are limited in 
how far they can go to insulate the team from politics. Sponsors are often the first line of 
defense to protect the project from external influences. Politics can exist in any life-cycle 
phase of a project. For politics to occur, all you need are two or more people or a group 
of people.
Most people believe that politics on projects are bad. That’s not necessarily true. 
Politics can be good or bad or at least lead to positive or negative project outcomes. 
Asking your sponsor to exert his or her political influence in helping you get the qualified 
resources you need or a high priority for your project could certainly lead to a positive 
outcome.
Unfavorable outcomes occur when people play politics for more power, author-
ity, control, or advancement opportunities. These types of political games can make a 
project disruptive or dysfunctional. These types of bad politics occur more frequently

Things Done

than good politics. If these bad political games are not controlled, the result can be 
win–lose positions during conflicts and decision making. The overall result can be low 
team morale.

Background
THE PRIORITIZATION OF PROJECTS
The directorates of Engineering, Marketing, Manufacturing, and R&D all 
had projects that they were working on and each directorate established its 
own priorities for the projects. The problem was that the employees were 
working on multiple projects and had to deal with competing priorities.
Lynx Manufacturing was a low-cost producer of cables and wires. The 
industry itself was considered as a low-technology industry and some of 
its products had been manufactured the same way for decades. There were 
some projects to improve the manufacturing processes, but they were few and far between.
Each of the four directorates, namely Engineering, Marketing, Manufacturing, and R&D, 
had projects, but the projects were generally quite small and used resources from only its own 
directorate.
By the turn of the century, manufacturing technologies began to grow and Lynx had to pre-
pare for the technology revolution that was about to impact its business. Each directorate began 
preparing lists of projects that it would need to work on, and some of the lists contained as many 
as 200 projects. These projects were more complex than projects worked on previously and pro-
ject team members from all directorates were assigned on either a full-time or part-time basis.
Each directorate’s chief officer would establish the priorities for the projects originating in 
his or her directorate even though the projects required resources from other directorates. This 
created significant staffing issues and numerous conflicts:
●
●
Each directorate would hoard its best project resources even though some projects 
outside of the directorate were deemed more important to the overall success of 
the company.
●
●
Each directorate would put out fires by using people that were assigned to projects 
outside of its directorate rather than using people that were working on internal 
projects.
●
●
Each directorate seemed to have little concern about any projects done in other 
directorates.
●
●
Project priorities within each directorate could change on a daily basis because of 
the personal whims of the chief of that directorate.
Prioritization Issues

The only costs and schedules that were important were those related to projects that origi-
nated within the directorate.
Senior management at the corporate level refused to get involved in the resolution of con-
flicts between directorates.
The working relationships between the directorates deteriorated to the point where senior 
management reluctantly agreed to step in. The total number of projects that the four directorates 
wanted to complete over the next few years exceeded 350, most of which required a team with 
members coming from more than one division.
QUESTIONS
1.	 Why is it necessary for senior management to step in rather than let the chiefs of the 
directorates handle the conflicts?
2.	 What should the senior management team do to resolve the problem?
3.	 Let’s assume that the decision was to create a list that included all of the projects from the 
four directorates. How many of the projects on the list should have a priority number or 
priority code?
4.	 Can the directorate chiefs assign the priority or must it be done with the involvement of 
senior management?
5.	 How often should the list of prioritized projects be reviewed and who should be in attendance 
at the review meetings?
6.	 Suppose that some of the directorate chiefs refuse to assign resources according to the 
prioritized list and still remain focused on their own pet projects. How should this issue now 
be resolved?
THE IRRESPONSIBLE SPONSORS
Case Studies
341
Two executives in this company each funded a “pet” project that had little 
chance of success. Despite repeated requests by the project managers to 
cancel the projects, the sponsors decided to throw away good money after 
bad money. The sponsors then had to find a way to prevent their embarrassment from such a 
blunder from becoming apparent to all.
Background
Two vice presidents came up with ideas for pet projects and funded the 
projects internally using money from their functional areas. Both projects 
had budgets close to $2 million and schedules of approximately one year. These were somewhat 
high-risk projects because they both required that a similar technical breakthrough be made. 
There was no guarantee that the technical breakthrough could be made at all. And even if the 
technical breakthrough could be made, both executives estimated that the shelf life of the products 
would be about one year before becoming obsolete but that they could easily recover their R&D 
costs.
These two projects were considered pet projects because they were established at the per-
sonal request of two senior managers and without any real business case. Had these two projects 
been required to go through the formal process of portfolio selection of projects, neither project 
would have been approved. The budgets for these projects were way out of line for the value that 
the company would receive, and the return on investment would be below minimum levels even 
Story Line

342
Working with Executives 
if the technical breakthrough could be made. Personnel from the project management office 
(PMO), which are actively involved in the portfolio selection of projects, also stated that they 
would never recommend approval of a project where the end result would have a shelf life of 
one year or less. Simply stated, these projects existed for the self-satisfaction of the two execu-
tives and to get them prestige with their colleagues.
Nevertheless, both executives found money for their projects and were willing to let the 
projects go forward without the standard approval process. Both executives were able to get an 
experienced project manager from their group to manage their pet project.
SELLING EXECUTIVES ON PROJECT MANAGEMENT
At the first gate review meeting, both project managers stood up and rec-
ommended that their projects be canceled and the resources be assigned to 
other more promising projects. They both stated that the technical breakthrough needed could 
not be made in a timely manner. Under normal conditions, both of these project managers 
should have received medals for bravery in standing up and recommending that their projects 
be canceled. This certainly appeared as a recommendation in the best interest of the company.
But neither executive was willing to give up that easily. Canceling both projects would be 
humiliating for the two executives who were sponsoring these projects. Instead, both executives 
stated that the projects were to continue until the next gate review meeting, at which time a deci-
sion would be made for possible cancellation of both projects.
At the second gate review meeting, both project managers once again recommended that 
their projects be canceled. And, as before, both executives asserted that the projects should con-
tinue to the next gate review meeting before a decision would be made.
As luck would have it, the necessary technical breakthrough was finally made, but six 
months late. That meant that the window of opportunity to sell the products and recover the R&D 
costs would be six months rather than one year. Unfortunately, the thinking in the marketplace 
was that these products would be obsolete in six months and no sales occurred of either product.
Both executives had to find a way to save face and avoid the humiliation of having to admit 
that they squandered a few million dollars on two useless R&D projects.
This could very well impact their year-end bonuses.
QUESTIONS
1.	 Is it customary for companies to allow executives to have pet or secret projects that do not 
follow the normal project approval process?
2.	 Who got promoted and who got fired? In other words, how did the executives save face?
Gate Review Meetings
The executives at Levon Corporation watched as their revenue stream 
­diminished and refused to listen to their own employees who were argu-
ing that project management implementation was necessary for growth. 
Finally, the executives agreed to listen to a presentation by a project 
management consultant.
Background
Levon Corporation had been reasonably successful for almost twenty years 
as an electronics component manufacturer. The company was a hybrid be-
tween project-driven and non-project-driven businesses. A large portion

Reluctantly, the executives agreed to hire a project management consult-
ant. The consultant was asked to identify the gaps between Levon and the 
rest of the industry and to show how project management could benefit the 
company. The consultant was also asked to identify the responsibilities of senior management 
once project management is implemented.
After a few weeks of research, the consultant was ready to make his presentation before 
the senior staff. The first slide that the consultant presented was Exhibit 10–1, which showed 
that Levon’s revenue stream was not as good as they thought. Levon was certainly lagging the 
industry average and distance between Levon and the industry leader was getting larger.

of its business came from development of customized products for government agencies and 
private-sector companies around the world.
The customized or project-driven portion of the business was beginning to erode. Even 
though Levon’s reputation was good, the majority of these contracts were awarded through com-
petitive bidding. Every customer’s request for proposal asked for a section on the contractor’s 
project management capability. Levon had no real project management capability. Since most of 
the contracts were awarded on points rather than going to the lowest bidder, Levon was constant-
ly downgraded in the evaluation of the proposals because of no project management capability.
The sales and marketing personnel continuously expressed their concerns to senior man-
agement, but the concerns fell upon deaf ears. Management was afraid that their support of 
project management could result in a shift in the balance of power in the company. Also, what-
ever executive ended up with control of the project management function could become more 
powerful than the other executives.
The consultant then showed Exhibit 10–2. The consultant had developed a project man-
agement maturity factor based upon such elements as time, cost, meeting scope, ability to 
handle risks, providing quality products, and customer interfacing and reporting. Using the 

344

project management maturity factor, the consultant showed that Levon’s understanding and 
use of project management were lagging behind the industry trend.

The consultant then showed Exhibit 10–3, which clearly illustrated that, unless Levon takes 
decisive action to improve its project management capability, the gap will certainly increase. 
The executives seemed to understand this but the consultant could still see their apprehension 
in supporting project management.
QUESTIONS
1.	 Why were the executives opposed to listening to their own employees but were willing to 
listen to a consultant?
2.	 Was the consultant correct in beginning the presentation by showing the gap between Levon 
and the rest of the industry?
3.	 Why did the executives still seem apprehensive even after the consultant’s presentation?
4.	 What should the consultant say next to get the executives to understand and support project 
management?

11.0 INTRODUCTION
The most important responsibilities of a project manager are often 
recognized as planning, integrating, and executing plans. Almost all 
projects, because of their relatively short duration and often prior-
itized control of resources, require formal, detailed planning. The 
integration of the planning activities is necessary because each functional unit may develop its own plan-
ning documentation with little regard for other functional units. 
Planning, in general, can best be described as the function of selecting the enterprise objectives and 
establishing the policies, procedures, and programs necessary for achieving them. Planning in a project envi-
ronment may be described as establishing a predetermined course of action within a forecasted environment. 
The project’s requirements set the major milestones. If line managers cannot commit because the milestones 
are perceived as unrealistic, the project manager may have to develop alternatives, one of which may be to 
move the milestones. Upper-level management must become involved in the selection of alternatives.
The project manager is the key to successful project planning. It is desirable that the project man-
ager be involved from project conception through execution. Project planning must be systematic, flexible 
enough to handle unique activities, disciplined through reviews and controls, and capable of accepting 
multifunctional inputs. Successful project managers realize that project planning is an iterative process and 
must be performed throughout the life of the project.
One of the objectives of project planning is to completely define all 
work required (possibly through the development of a documented 
project plan) so that it will be readily identifiable to each project 
participant. This is a necessity in a project environment because:
●
●
If the task is well understood prior to being performed, much of the work can be preplanned.
●
●
If the task is not understood, then during the actual task execution more knowledge is gained, 
which in turn leads to changes in resource allocations, schedules, and priorities.

The more uncertain the task, the greater the amount of information that must be processed in order 
to ensure effective performance.
These considerations are important in a project environment because each project can be different from 
the others, requiring a variety of different resources, but having to be performed under time, cost, and per-
formance constraints with little margin for error.
11.1 BUSINESS CASE
Projects usually begin with the development of a business case for 
the project. This occurs most often well before the actual scope of the 
project is defined. A business case is a document that provides the rea-
soning why a project should be initiated. Historically, business cases 
were small documents or presentations and the decision to initiate the 
project was based upon the rank of the person making the request. 
Today, business cases are well-structured written documents that support a specific business 
need. Each business case should describe the boundaries to the project in sufficient detail 
such that the decision makers can determine that the expected business value and benefits 
exceed the cost of performing the project.
The business case must contain both quantifiable and unquantifiable information that 
justifies the investment in the project. Typical information that is part of a business case 
includes:
●
●
The business need: This identifies the gap that currently exists and the need for 
the investment.
●
●
The opportunity options: This identifies how the project is linked to strategic busi-
ness objectives.
●
●
The benefit realization plan: This identifies the value/benefits (rather than products 
or deliverables) that can be obtained whether they are cost savings, additional 
profits, or opportunities.
●
●
Assumptions made: This identifies all of the assumptions that are made to justify 
the project.
●
●
High-level objectives: This identifies the high-level or strategic objectives for the 
project.
●
●
Recommendation for evaluation: This identifies what techniques should be used 
for evaluation such as a benefit-to-cost ratio, cash flow considerations, strategic 
options, opportunity costs, return on investment, net present value, and risks.
●
●
Project metrics: This identifies the financial and nonfinancial metrics that will be 
used to track the performance of the project.
●
●
Exit strategies: This identifies the cancellation criteria to be used to cancel the 
project if necessary.
●
●
Project risks: This helps the decision makers evaluate the project by listing briefly 
the business, legal, technical, and other risks of the project.

●
●
Project complexity: This identifies how complex the project might be, perhaps 
even from a risk perspective, if the organization can manage the complexity, and if 
it can be done with existing technology.
●
●
Resources needed: This identifies the human and nonhuman resources needed.
●
●
Timing: This identifies the major milestones for the project.
●
●
Legal requirements: This identifies and legal requirements that must be followed.
The above information is used not only to approve the project, but also to be able to 
prioritize it with all of the other projects in the queue.
Templates can be established for most of the items in the business case. Sometimes, 
the benefits realization is a separate document rather than being included as part of the 
business case. A template for a benefits realization plan might include the following:
●
●
A description of the benefits
●
●
Identification of each benefit as tangible or intangible
●
●
Identification of the recipient of each benefit
●
●
How the benefits will be realized
●
●
How the benefits will be measured
●
●
The realization date for each benefit
●
●
The handover activities to another group that may be responsible for converting 
the project’s deliverables into benefits realization
Decision makers must understand that, over the life cycle of a project, circumstances 
can change requiring modification of the requirements, shifting of priorities, and redefini-
tion of the desired outcomes. It is entirely possible that the business case and benefits reali-
zation plan can change to a point where the outcome of the project provides detrimental 
results and the project should be cancelled or backlogged for consideration at a later time. 
Some of the factors that can induce changes in the business case or benefits realization plan 
include:
●
●
Changes in business owner or executive leadership: Over the life of a project, there 
can be a change in leadership. Executives that originally crafted the project may 
have passed it along to others who either have a tough time understanding the ben-
efits, are unwilling to provide the same level of commitment, or see other projects 
as providing more important benefits.
●
●
Changes in assumptions: Based upon the length of the project, the assumptions 
can and most likely will change, especially those related to enterprise environ­
mental factors. Tracking metrics must be established to make sure that the original 
or changing assumptions are still aligned with the expected benefits.
●
●
Changes in constraints: Changes in market conditions (i.e., markets served and 
consumer behavior) or risks can induce changes in the constraints. Companies 
may approve scope changes to take advantage of additional opportunities or reduce 
funding based upon cash flow restrictions. Metrics must also track for changes in 
the constraints.

348
Planning 
●
●
Changes in resource availability: The availability or loss of resources with the nec-
essary critical skills is always an issue and can impact benefits if a breakthrough in 
technology is needed to achieve the benefits or to find a better technical approach 
with less risk.
One of the axioms of project management is that the earlier the project manager is 
assigned, the better the plan and the greater the commitment to the project. There is a trend 
today for bringing the project manager on board enough to participate in business case 
development.
There are valid arguments for assigning the project manager after the business case is 
developed:
●
●
The project manager may have limited knowledge and not be able to contribute to 
the project at this time.
●
●
The project might not be approved and/or funded, and it would be an added cost to 
have the project manager on board this early.
●
●
The project might not be defined well enough at this early stage to determine the 
best person to be assigned as the project manager.
While these arguments seem to have merit, there is a more serious issue in that the 
project manager ultimately assigned may not fully understand the assumptions, constraints, 
and alternatives considered during the business case development. This could lead to a 
less than optimal development of a project plan. It is wishful thinking to believe that the 
business case development effort, which may have been prepared by someone completely 
separated from the execution of the project, contains all of the necessary assumptions, 
alternatives, and constraints.
Business case development often results in a highly optimistic approach with little 
regard for the schedule and/or the budget. Pressure is then placed upon the project manager 
to accept unrealistic arguments and assumptions made during business case development. 
If the project fails to meet business case expectations, then the blame may be placed upon 
the project manager.
11.2 VALIDATING THE ASSUMPTIONS
Planning begins with an understanding of the requirements, constraints, 
and assumptions. Project planning is based upon the expectation that 
future results can be extrapolated from past experiences. If experience 
is lacking or if extrapolation will generate misleading information, 
then assumptions must be made to predict future outcomes.
Quite often, the assumptions included in the project’s business 
case are made by marketing and sales personnel and then approved by senior management 
as part of the project selection and approval process. The expectations for the final results 
are based upon the assumptions made.

Validating The Assumptions
349
Why is it that, more often than not, the final results of a project do not satisfy senior 
management’s expectations? At the beginning of a project, it is impossible to ensure that 
the benefits expected by senior management will be realized at project completion. While 
project length is a critical factor, the real culprit is changing assumptions. Sometimes, we 
have assumption “blind spots” where we fail to recognize that some of our conventional or 
often used assumptions are no longer valid.
Assumptions can be made for items that are or are not under the direct control of the 
project team but can influence the outcome of the project. Assumptions made by the project 
manager are often surrounding the enterprise environment factors and the organizational 
process assets.
●
●
Enterprise Environmental Factors: These are assumptions about external environ-
mental conditions that can affect the success of the project, such as interest rates, 
market conditions, changing customer demands and requirements, customer involve-
ment, changes in technology, political climate, and even government policies.
●
●
Organizational Process Assets: These are assumptions about present and future 
company assets that can impact the success of the project, such as the capability of 
your project management methodology, the project management information sys-
tem, forms, templates, guidelines, checklists, the ability to capture and use lessons 
learned data and best practices, resource availability, and skill level.
At the onset of the project, all assumptions must be challenged to 
verify their validity. As the project progresses, the assumptions must 
be tracked and validated. If the assumptions change or are no longer 
valid, then perhaps the project should be redirected or even canceled. 
Unfortunately, many project managers do not track the validity of the assumptions and end 
up completing a project within time and cost, but the project does not add business value 
to the company or the client.
It may be impossible to make assumptions with any degree of accuracy. However, this 
should not prevent risk management from taking place on the assumptions and contingency 
plans established if the assumptions are proven to be false.
PMBOK® Guide, 6th Edition
2.3 Organizational Process Assets
2.2 Enterprise Environmental Factors
Types of Assumptions
There are several types of assumptions. The two most common catego-
ries are explicit and implicit assumptions, and critical and noncritical 
assumptions. Critical and noncritical assumptions are also referred to as 
primary and secondary assumptions. These two categories of assumptions 
are not mutually exclusive.
Explicit assumptions may be quantified and are expressed without any 
ambiguity. Implicit assumptions may be hidden and may go undetected. 
Explicit instructions often contain hidden implicit assumptions. As an exam-
ple, we could make an explicit assumption that five people will be needed full 
time to complete the project. Hidden is the implicit assumption that the peo-
ple assigned will be available full time and possess the necessary skills. Seri-
ous consequences can occur if the implicit assumptions are proven to be false.

350
Planning 
Critical assumptions are those assumptions that can cause significant damage to a 
project if even small changes take place. Critical assumptions must be tracked closely, 
whereas noncritical assumptions may not be tracked and may not require any action as 
long as they do not become critical assumptions. Project managers must develop a plan for 
how they will measure, track, and report the critical assumptions. Measurement implies 
that the assumptions can be quantified. Since assumptions predict future outcomes, testing 
and measurement may not be able to be made until well into the future or unless some risk 
triggers appear. Sensitivity analysis may be required to determine the risk triggers.
In Agile fixed-price contracts, the project manager and the customer work together to 
identify the assumptions. An agreement must be reached on the critical assumptions espe-
cially with regard to business value, risks and costs. An understanding must also be reached 
on what changes to the critical assumptions may trigger the need for scope changes. This 
requires that the project manager and the customer remain in close collaboration through-
out the life of the project.
There are some assumptions that project managers may never see or even know about. 
These are referred to as strategic assumptions and are retained by decision makers when 
approving a project or selecting a portfolio of projects. These types of assumptions may 
contain company proprietary information that executives do not want the project team to 
know about.
Documenting Assumptions
Assumptions must be documented at project initiation using the project 
charter as a possible means. Throughout the project, the project man-
ager must revalidate and challenge the assumptions. Changing assumptions may mandate 
that the project be terminated or redirected toward a different set of objectives.
A project management plan is based upon the assumptions described in the project 
charter. But there may be additional assumptions made by the team that are inputs to the 
project management plan. One of the primary reasons why companies use a project charter 
is that project managers were most often brought on board well after the project selection 
process and approval process were completed. As a result, project managers needed to 
know what assumptions were considered.
Enterprise Environmental Factors: These are assumptions about the external envi-
ronmental conditions that can affect the success of the project, such as interest rates, mar-
ket conditions, changing customer demands and requirements, changes in technology, and 
even government policies.
Organizational Process Assets: These are assumptions about present or future com-
pany assets that can impact the success of the project such as the capability of your enter-
prise project management methodology, the project management information system, 
forms, templates, guidelines, checklists, and ability to capture and use lessons learned data 
and best practices.
Documenting assumptions is necessary in order to track the changes. Examples of 
assumptions that are likely to change over the duration of a project, especially on a long-
term project, might be that:
●
●
The cost of borrowing money and financing the project will remain fixed.
●
●
The procurement costs will not increase.

●
●
The breakthrough in technology will take place as scheduled.
●
●
The resources with the necessary skills will be available when needed.
●
●
The marketplace will readily accept the product.
●
●
Our competitors will not catch up to us.
●
●
The risks are low and can be easily mitigated.
●
●
The political environment in the host country will not change.
The problem with having faulty assumptions is that they can lead to faulty conclusions, 
bad results, and unhappy customers. The best defense against poor assumptions is good 
preparation at project initiation, including the development of risk mitigation strategies. One 
possible way to do this is with a validation checklist, as shown in Table 11–1.
11.3 VALIDATING THE OBJECTIVES
When project managers are assigned to a project and review the busi-
ness case, they look first at the assumptions and objectives for the 
project. A project’s objectives, which are usually high-level objec-
tives, provide an aim or desired end of action. Project managers must then prepare the 
interim objectives to satisfy the high-level objectives.
Objectives are described in specific terms, are measureable, and are attainable and 
action-oriented, realistic, and bound by time. Clearly written and well-understood objec-
tives are essential so that the project team will know when the project is over. Unfortunately 
the objectives are usually imposed upon the project manager, rather than having the project 
manager assigned early enough so as to participate in the establishment of the objectives.
Clearly written objectives follow the SMART rule: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, 
Realistic or relevant, Tangible or time bound.
Project managers may not be able to establish the objectives themselves without some 
assistance from perhaps the project sponsor. Most project managers may be able to estab-
lish the technical components of the objectives but must rely heavily upon the project spon-
sor for the business components.

Planning 
If the project manager believes that the requirements are unrealistic, then he may con-
sider scaling back the scope of the objectives. While other techniques are available for scal-
ing back the objectives, scope reduction is often the first attempt. According to Eric Verzuh:
If the goals of the project will take too long to accomplish or cost too much, the first step 
is to scale down the objectives—the product scope. The result of this alternative will be 
to reduce the functionality of the end product. Perhaps an aircraft will carry less weight, a 
software product will have fewer features, or a building will have fewer square feet or less 
expensive wood paneling. (Remember the difference between product scope and project 
scope; product scope describes the functionality and performance of the product; project 
scope is all of the work required to deliver the product scope.
Positive. This will save the project while saving both time and money.
Negative. When a product’s functionality is reduced, its value is reduced. If the airplane 
won’t carry as much weight, will the customers still want it? If a software product 
has fewer features, will it stand up to competition? A smaller office building with 
less expensive wood paneling may not attract high-enough rents to justify the project.
Best application. The key to reducing a product’s scope without reducing its value is to 
reevaluate the true requirements for the business case. Many a product has been over 
budget because it was overbuilt. Quality has best been defined as “conformance to 
requirements.” Therefore, reducing product scope so that the requirements are met 
more accurately actually improves the value of the product, because it is produced 
more quickly and for a lower cost.1
11.4 GENERAL PLANNING
Planning is determining what needs to be done, by whom, and by 
when, in order to fulfill one’s assigned responsibility. There are nine 
major components of the planning phase:
1.	 Objective: a goal, target, or quota to be achieved by a certain time
2.	 Program: the strategy to be followed and major actions to be taken in order to achieve 
or exceed objectives
3.	 Schedule: a plan showing when individual or group activities or accomplishments will 
be started and/or completed
4.	 Budget: planned expenditures required to achieve or exceed objectives
5.	 Forecast: a projection of what will happen by a certain time
6.	 Organization: design of the number and kinds of positions, along with corresponding 
duties and responsibilities, required to achieve or exceed objectives
7.	 Policy: a general guide for decision making and individual actions
8.	 Procedure: a detailed method for carrying out a policy
9.	 Standard: a level of individual or group performance defined as adequate or acceptable

General Planning
353
An item that has become important in recent years is documenting assumptions that go 
into the objectives or the project/subsidiary plans. Assumptions are items that are believed 
to be true, real, or certain. They are not grounded in fact and carry some element of risk. 
As projects progress, even for short-term projects, assumptions can change because of 
the economy, technological advances, or market conditions. These changes can invalidate 
original assumptions or require that new assumptions be made. These changes could also 
mandate that projects be canceled. Companies are now validating assumptions during gate 
review meetings.
Several of these factors require additional comment. Forecasting what will happen 
may not be easy, especially if predictions of environmental reactions are required. Fore-
casting is customarily defined as either strategic, tactical, or operational. Strategic forecast-
ing is generally for five years or more, tactical can be for one to five years, and operational 
is the here and now of six months to one year. Although most projects are operational, they 
can be considered as strategic, especially if spin-offs or follow-up work is promising. Fore-
casting also requires an understanding of strengths and weaknesses in:
●
●
The competitive situation
●
●
Marketing
●
●
Research and development
●
●
Production
●
●
Financing
●
●
Personnel
●
●
The management structure
If project forecasting is strictly operational, then these factors may be clearly defin-
able. However, if strategic or long-range forecasting is necessary, then the future economic 
outlook can vary, say, from year to year, and forecasting must be revisited at regular inter-
vals because the goals and objectives can change.
The last three factors—policies, procedures, and standards—can vary from project to 
project because of their uniqueness. Each project manager can establish project policies, 
provided that they fall within the broad limits set forth by top management.
Project policies must often conform closely to company policies, and are usually simi-
lar in nature from project to project. Procedures, on the other hand, can be drastically 
different from project to project, even if the same activity is performed. For example, the 
signing off of manufacturing plans may require different signatures on two selected pro-
jects even though the same end-item is being produced.
Planning varies at each level of the organization. At the individual level, planning 
is required so that cognitive simulation can be established before irrevocable actions are 
taken. At the working group or functional level, planning must include:
●
●
Agreement on purpose
●
●
Assignment and acceptance of individual responsibilities
●
●
Coordination of work activities
●
●
Increased commitment to group goals
●
●
Lateral communications

At the organizational or project level, standards must include:

●
●
Assignment and acceptance of group responsibilities
●
●
Increased motivation and commitment to organizational goals
●
●
Vertical and lateral communications
●

The logic of planning requires answers to several questions at various stages in order 
for the alternatives and constraints to be fully understood. A list of questions would include:
●
●
Prepare environmental analysis
●
●
Where are we? How and why did we get here?
●
●
Set objectives
●
●
Is this where we want to be? Where would we like to be? In a year? In five years?
●
●
List alternative strategies
●
●
Where will we go if we continue as before? Is that where we want to go? How 
could we get to where we want to go?
●
●
List threats and opportunities
●
●
What might prevent us from getting there? What might help us to get there?
●
●
Prepare forecasts
●
●
Where are we capable of going? What do we need to take us where we want 
to go?
●
●
Select strategy portfolio
●
●
What is the best course for us to take? What are the potential benefits? What 
are the risks?
●
●
Prepare action programs
●
●
What do we need to do? When do we need to do it? How will we do it? Who 
will do it?
●
●
Monitor and control
●
●
Are we on course? If not, why? What do we need to do to be on course? Can 
we do it?
One of the most difficult activities in the project environment is to keep the planning 
on target. The following procedures can assist project managers during planning activities:
●
●
Let functional managers do their own planning. Too often operators are operators, 
planners are planners, and never the twain shall meet.
●
●
Establish goals before you plan. Otherwise short-term thinking takes over.
●
●
Set goals for the planners. This will guard against the nonessentials and places 
your effort where there is payoff.
●
●
Stay flexible. Use people-to-people contact, and stress fast response.
●
●
Keep a balanced outlook. Don’t overreact; position yourself for an upturn.
●
●
Welcome top-management participation. Top management has the capability to 
make or break a plan, and may well be the single most important variable.

Life-Cycle Phases
355
●
●
Beware of future spending plans. This may eliminate the tendency to underestimate.
●
●
Test the assumptions behind the forecasts. This is necessary because professionals 
are generally too optimistic. Do not depend solely on one set of data.
●
●
Don’t focus on today’s problems. Try to get away from crisis management and 
firefighting.
●
●
Reward those who dispel illusions. Do not “kill the messenger”; in other words, 
project participants should not be wary of relaying bad news. Reward the first to 
come forth with bad news.
Finally, effective total program planning cannot be accomplished unless all of the 
necessary information becomes available at project initiation. These information require-
ments are:
●
●
The statement of work (SOW) (Section 11.10)
●
●
The project specifications (Section 11.11)
●
●
The milestone schedule (Section 11.6 and 11.12)
●
●
The work breakdown structure (WBS) (Section 11.13)
11.5 LIFE-CYCLE PHASES
Project planning takes place at two levels. The first level is the cor-
porate cultural approach; the second is the individual’s approach. 
The corporate cultural approach breaks the project down into life-
cycle phases. The life-cycle phase approach is not an attempt to put 
handcuffs on the project manager but to provide a methodology for 
uniformity in project planning. Many companies, including government agencies, prepare 
checklists of activities that should be considered in each phase. These checklists are for 
consistency in planning. The project manager can still exercise his own planning initiatives 
within each phase.
Another benefit of life-cycle phases is control. At the end of each phase there is a 
meeting of the project manager, sponsor, senior management, and even the customer, to 
assess the accomplishments of this life-cycle phase and to get approval for the next phase. 
These meetings are often called critical design reviews, “on-off ramps,” and “gates.” In 
some companies, these meetings are used to firm up budgets and schedules for the follow-
on phases. In addition to monetary and schedule considerations, life-cycle phases can be 
used for staffing deployment and equipment/facility utilization. Some companies go so far 
as to prepare project management policy and procedure manuals where all information is 
subdivided according to life-cycle phasing. They include:
●
●
Proceed with the next phase based on an approved funding level
●
●
Proceed to the next phase but with a new or modified set of objectives
●
●
Postpone approval to proceed based on a need for additional information
●
●

In addition to scope freeze milestones, there can also be design freeze 
milestones. Even if the scope is well defined and agreed to, there may 
be several different designs to meet the scope. Sometimes, the best design may require that 
the scope be changed and the scope freeze milestone must be moved out.
A design freeze milestone is a point in a project where no further changes to the design 
of the product came be made without incurring a financial risk especially if the design must 
then go to manufacturing. The decision point for the freeze usually occurs at the end of a 
specific life-cycle phase. There are several types of freezes, and they can occur in just about 
any type of project. However, they are most common in new product development (NPD) 
projects.
Scope freeze milestones are locations in the project’s timeline where 
the scope is frozen and further scope changes will not be allowed. In 
traditional project management, we often do not use scope freeze milestones because it is 
assumed that the scope is well-defined at project initiation. But on other projects, especially 
in IT, the project may begin based upon just an idea and the project’s scope must evolve 
as the project is being implemented. This is quite common with techniques such as Agile 
and Scrum.
According to Melik:
There will be resistance to scope freeze; if it is too early, you may have an unhappy cus-
tomer, too late and the project will be over budget or late. Striking the right balance between 
the customer’s needs and your ability to deliver on time and on budget is a judgment call; 
timing varies from project to project, but the scope should always be frozen before a [sig-
nificant] financial commitment is made.
What if the scope baseline cannot be agreed to? One of the following approaches may 
be helpful:
●
●
Work more with the customer until scope freeze is achieved.
●
●
Agree to work in phases; proceed with partial project execution, clarify and agree to 
the rest of the scope during the course of the project. Pilot, prototype, or fit-to-business-
analysis mini-projects are helpful.
●
●
Structure the project with many predetermined milestones and phases of short dura-
tion; such a project is far more likely to remain aligned with its ultimate objectives.2
11.6 LIFE-CYCLE MILESTONES
When we discuss life-cycle phases, it is generally understood that there are “go” or “no 
go” milestones at the end of each life-cycle phase. These milestones are used to determine 
if the project should be continued, and if so, should there be any changes to the funding 
or requirements? But there are also other interim milestones that support the end-of-phase 
milestones or appear within certain life-cycle phases.

Scope Freeze Milestones
Design Freeze Milestones

Project managers often neglect to include in the life-cycle phases 
timeline milestones and the accompanying time durations for customer 
approvals of the project’s schedule baseline with the mistaken belief that the approval pro-
cess will happen quickly. The approval process in the project manager’s parent company 
may be known with some reasonable degree of certainly, but the same cannot be said for 
the client’s approval process. Factors that can impact the speed by which the approvals take 
place can include:
●
●
How many people are involved in the approval process
●
●
Whether any of the people are new to the project
●
●
When all of the necessary participants can find a mutually agreed upon time to meet
●

Simply adding a milestone to a schedule that says “customer approval” does not solve 
the problem. Project managers must find out how long their customers need to make a 
decision, and it may be better to indicate customer approval as an activity rather than as a 
milestone.
In NPD projects, we normally have a both a specification freeze and a design freeze. 
The specification dictates the set of requirements upon which the final design must be 
made. Following a specification freeze, we have a design freeze whereby the final design is 
handed over to manufacturing. The design freeze may be necessary for timely procurement 
of long lead items such as parts and tooling that are necessary for the final product to be 
manufactured. The timing of the design freeze is often dictated by the lead times and may 
be beyond the control of the company. Failing to meet design freeze points has a signifi-
cantly greater impact on manufacturing than engineering design.
Design freezes have the additional benefit of controlling downstream scope changes. 
However, even though design changes can be costly, they are often necessary for safety 
reasons, to protect the firm against possible product liability lawsuits, and to satisfy a cus-
tomer’s specific needs.
Changes to a product after the product’s design is handed over to manufacturing can 
be costly. As a rule, we generally state that the cost of a change in any life-cycle phase after 
the design freeze is ten times the cost of performing the change in the previous life-cycle 
phase. If a mistake is made prior to the design freeze point, the correction could have been 
made for $100. But if the mistake is not detected until the manufacturing stage, then the 
correction cost could be $1000. The same mistake, if detected after the customer receives 
the product, could cost $10,000 to correct a $100 planning mistake or a $1000 manufactur-
ing mistake. While the rule of ten may seem a little exaggerated, it does show the trend in 
correcting costs downstream.

11.7 KICKOFF MEETINGS
The typical launch of a project begins with a kickoff meeting involv-
ing the major players responsible for planning, including the project 
manager, assistant project managers for certain areas of knowl-
edge, subject matter experts (SME), and functional leads. A typical 
sequence is shown in Figure 11–1.
There can be multiple kickoff meetings based upon the size, com-
plexity, and time requirements for the project. The major players are usually authorized by 
their functional areas to make decisions concerning timing, costs, and resource requirements.
Some of the items discussed in the initial kickoff meeting include:
●
●
Wage and salary administration, if applicable
●
●
Letting the employees know that their boss will be informed as to how well or how 
poorly they perform
●
●
Initial discussion of the scope of the project including both the technical objective 
and the business objective
●

The participants’ roles and responsibilities
For a small or short-term project, estimates on cost and duration may be established 
in the kickoff meeting. In this case, there may be little need to establish a cost estimating 
schedule. But where the estimating cycle is expected to take several weeks, and where 
inputs will be required from various organizations and/or disciplines, an essential tool is 
an estimating schedule. In this case, there may be a need for a prekickoff meeting simply 
to determine the estimates. The minimum key milestones in a cost estimating schedule are 
(1) a “kickoff” meeting, (2) a “review of ground rules” meeting, (3) “resources input and 
review” meeting, and (4) summary meetings and presentations. Descriptions of these meet-
ings and their approximate places in the estimating cycle follow.3
●
●
The Prekickoff Meeting: The very first formal milestone in an estimate schedule 
is the estimate kickoff meeting. This is a meeting of all the individuals who are 
expected to have an input to the cost estimate. Sufficient time should be allowed in 
the kickoff meeting to describe all project ground rules, constraints, and assump-
tions; to hand out technical specifications, drawings, schedules, and work element 
descriptions and resource estimating forms; and to discuss these items and answer 
any questions that might arise. This kickoff meeting may be 6 weeks to 3 months 
prior to the estimate completion date to allow sufficient time for the overall esti-
mating process.
●
●
The Review of Ground Rules Meeting: Several days after the estimate kickoff 
meeting, when the participants have had the opportunity to study the material, a 
review of ground rules meeting should be conducted. In this meeting the estimate 
manager answers questions regarding the conduct of the cost estimate, assump-
tions, ground rules, and estimating assignments.
●
●
The Resources Input and Review Meeting: Several weeks after the kickoff and 
review of ground rules meetings, each team member that has a resources (man-
hour and/or materials) input is asked to present his or her input before the entire 
estimating team. Thus starts one of the most valuable parts of the estimating pro-
cess: the interaction of team members to reduce duplications, overlaps, and omis-
sions in resource data. The estimator of each discipline area has the opportunity 
to justify and explain the rationale for his estimates in view of his peers, an activity 
that tends to iron out inconsistencies, overstatements, and incompatibilities in 
resources estimates.
●
●
Summary Meetings and Presentations: Once the resources inputs have been 
collected, adjusted, and “priced,” the cost estimate is presented to the estimating 
team as a “dry run” for the final presentation to the company’s management or 
to the requesting organization. This dry run can produce visibility into further 
inconsistencies or errors that have crept into the estimate during the process of 
consolidation and reconciliation.

11.8 UNDERSTANDING PARTICIPANTS’ ROLES
Companies that have histories of successful plans also have employees who fully under-
stand their roles in the planning process. Good up-front planning may not eliminate the 
need for changes, but may reduce the number of changes required. The responsibilities of 
the major players are as follows:
●
●
Project manager will define:
●
●
Goals and objectives
●
●
Major milestones
●
●
Requirements
●
●
Ground rules and assumptions
●
●
Time, cost, and performance constraints
●
●
Operating procedures
●
●
Administrative policy
●
●
Reporting requirements
●
●
Line manager will define:
●
●
Detailed task descriptions to implement objectives, requirements, and mile-
stones
●
●
Detailed schedules and manpower allocations to support budget and schedule
●
●
Identification of areas of risk, uncertainty, and conflict
●
●
Senior management (project sponsor) will:
●
●
Act as the negotiator for disagreements between project and line management
●
●
Provide clarification of critical issues
●
●
Provide communication link with customer’s senior management
●
●
Successful planning requires that project, line, and senior management are in 
agreement with the plan.
11.9 ESTABLISHING PROJECT OBJECTIVES
Successful project management, whether in response to an in-house 
project or a customer request, must utilize effective planning tech-
niques. The first step, as stated previously, is understanding the pro-
ject objectives. These goals may be to develop expertise in a given 
area, to become competitive, to modify an existing facility for later use, or simply to keep 
key personnel employed.
The objectives are generally not independent; they are all interrelated, both implicitly 
and explicitly. Many times it is not possible to satisfy all objectives. At this point, manage-
ment must prioritize the objectives as to which are strategic and which are not. Typical 
problems with developing both high level and interim objectives include:
●
●
Project objectives/goals are not agreeable to all parties.
●
●
Project objectives are too rigid to accommodate changing priorities.
PMBOK® Guide, 6th Edition
Chapter 5 Project Scope Management
5.3 Define Scope

The Statement of Work
361
●
●
Insufficient time exists to define objectives well.
●
●
Objectives are not adequately quantified.
●
●
Objectives are not documented well enough.
●
●
Efforts of client and project personnel are not coordinated.
●
●
Personnel turnover is high.
Once the objectives are clearly defined, four questions must be considered:
●
●
What are the major elements of the work required to satisfy the objectives, and 
how are these elements interrelated?
●
●
Which functional divisions will assume responsibility for accomplishment of 
these objectives and the major-element work requirements?
●
●
Are the required corporate and organizational resources available?
●
●
What are the information flow requirements for the project?
11.10 THE STATEMENT OF WORK
Planning generally addresses four elements related to scope:
●	
Scope: Scope is the summation of all deliverables required as part 
of the project. This includes all products, services, and results.
●	 Project Scope: This is the work that must be completed to achieve 
the final scope of the project, namely the products, services, and 
end results.
●
●
Scope statement: This is a document that provides the basis for making future 
decisions such as scope changes. The intended use of the document is to make 
sure that all stakeholders have a common knowledge of the project scope. Included 
in this document are the objectives, description of the deliverables, end result or 
product, and justification for the project. The scope statement addresses seven 
questions: who, what, when, why, where, how, and how many. This document 
validates the project scope against the statement of work provided by the customer.
●
●
Statement of work: This is a narrative description of the end results to be provided 
under the contract. For the remainder of this section, we will focus our attention 
on the statement of work.
The statement of work (SOW) is a narrative description of the work required for the 
project and the end results to be provided under the contract. The complexity of the SOW 
is determined by the desires of top management, the customer, and/or the user groups. For 
projects internal to the company, the SOW is prepared by the project office with input from 
the user groups because the project office is usually composed of personnel with writing 
skills.
For projects external to the organization, as in competitive bidding, the contractor 
may have to prepare the SOW for the customer because the customer may not have people

362
Planning 
trained in SOW preparation. In this case, as before, the contractor would submit the SOW 
to the customer for approval. It is also quite common for the project manager to rewrite a 
customer’s SOW so that the contractor’s line managers can price out the effort.
In a competitive bidding environment, there are two SOWs—the SOW used in the 
proposal and a contract statement of work (CSOW). There might also be a proposal WBS 
and a contract work breakdown structure (CWBS). Special care must be taken by contract 
and negotiation teams to discover all discrepancies between the SOW/WBS and CSOW/
CWBS, or additional costs may be incurred. A good (or winning) proposal is no guarantee 
that the customer or contractor understands the SOW. For large projects, fact-finding is 
usually required before final negotiations because it is essential that both the customer and 
the contractor understand and agree on the SOW, what work is required, what work is pro-
posed, the factual basis for the costs, and other related elements. In addition, it is imperative 
that there be agreement between the final CSOW and CWBS.
SOW preparation is not as easy as it sounds. Misinterpretations of the SOW can result 
in losses of hundreds of millions of dollars. Common causes of misinterpretation are:
●
●
Mixing tasks, specifications, approvals, and special instructions
●
●
Using imprecise language (“nearly,” “optimum,” “approximately,” etc.)
●
●
No pattern, structure, or chronological order
●
●
Wide variation in size of tasks
●
●
Wide variation in how to describe details of the work
●
●
Failing to get third-party review
Misinterpretations of the statement of work can and will occur no matter how careful 
everyone has been. The best way to control such misinterpretations is with a good defini-
tion of the requirements up front, if possible.
SOW preparation manuals typically contain guides for editors and writers:4
●
●
Every SOW that exceeds two pages in length should have a table of contents con-
forming to the CWBS coding structure. There should rarely be items in the SOW 
that are not shown on the CWBS.
●
●
Clear and precise task descriptions are essential as they will be read and interpreted 
by persons of varied background. A good SOW states precisely the product or 
service desired. The clarity of the SOW will affect administration of the contract.
●
●
Every effort must be made to avoid ambiguity.
●
●
Remember that any provision that takes control of the work away from the con-
tractor, even temporarily, may result in relieving the contractor of responsibility.
●
●
In specifying requirements, use active rather than passive terminology.
●
●
Limit abbreviations to those in common usage. Provide a list of all pertinent abbre-
viations and acronyms at the beginning of the SOW.
●
●
Any division of responsibilities between the contractor, other agencies, etc., should 
be included and delineated.

Project Specifications
363
●
●
Include procedures. When immediate decisions cannot be made, it may be pos-
sible to include a procedure for making them.
●
●
Do not overspecify. The ideal situation may be to specify results required or end-
items to be delivered and let the contractor propose his best method.
●
●
Describe requirements in sufficient detail to assure clarity, not only for legal 
reasons, but for practical application. It is easy to overlook many details. It is 
equally easy to be repetitious. Beware of doing either.
●
●
Avoid incorporating extraneous material and requirements. They may add unnec-
essary cost.
●
●
Screen out unnecessary data requirements, and specify only what is essential and 
when.
●
●
Do not repeat detailed requirements or specifications that are already spelled out 
in applicable documents. Instead, incorporate them by reference.
11.11 PROJECT SPECIFICATIONS
An abbreviated specification list as shown in Table 11–2 is separately 
identified or called out as part of the statement of work. Specifica-
tions are used for man-hour, equipment, and material estimates. 
Small changes in a specification can cause large cost overruns.

Planning 
Another reason for identifying the specifications is to make sure that there are no 
surprises for the customer downstream. The specifications should be the most current revi-
sion. It is not uncommon for a customer to hire outside agencies to evaluate the technical 
proposal and to make sure that the proper specifications are being used.
Specifications are, in fact, standards for pricing out a proposal. If specifications do 
not exist or are not necessary, then work standards should be included in the proposal. 
The work standards can also appear in the cost volume of the proposal. Labor justifica-
tion backup sheets may or may not be included in the proposal, depending on RFP/RFQ 
(request for quotation) requirements.
11.12 DATA ITEM MILESTONE SCHEDULES
Typical project milestone schedules contain such information as:
●	 Project start date
●	 Project end date
●
●
Other major milestones (such as discussed in Section 11.6)
●
●
Data items (deliverables or reports)
Project start and end dates, if known, must be included. Other major milestones, such 
as review meetings, prototype available, procurement, testing, and so on, should also be 
identified. The last topic, data items, is often overlooked. There are two good reasons 
for preparing a separate schedule for data items. First, the separate schedule will indi-
cate to line managers that personnel with writing skills may have to be assigned. Second, 
data items require direct-labor man-hours for writing, typing, editing, retyping, proofing, 
graphic arts, and reproduction. Many companies identify on the data item schedules the 
approximate number of pages per data item, and each data item is priced out at a cost per 
page, say $1,000/page. Pricing out data items separately often induces customers to require 
fewer reports.
The steps required to prepare a report, after the initial discovery work or collection of 
information, include:
●
●
Organizing the report
●
●
Writing
●
●
Typing
●
●
Editing
●
●
Retyping
●
●
Proofing
●
●
Graphic arts
●
●
Submittal for approvals
●
●
Reproduction and distribution
Typically, 6–8 hours of work are required per page. At a burdened hourly rate of $150/
hour, it is easy for the cost of documentation to become exorbitant.

Chapter 6 Project Schedule Management

Work Breakdown Structure
365
11.13 WORK BREAKDOWN STRUCTURE
In planning a project, the project manager must structure the work 
into small elements that are:
●	 Manageable, in that specific authority and responsibility can be 
assigned
●
●
Independent, or with minimum interfacing with and dependence on other ongoing 
elements
●
●
Integratable so that the total package can be seen
●
●
Measurable in terms of progress
A work breakdown structure (WBS) is a product-oriented family tree subdivision of 
the hardware, services, and data required to produce the end product. The WBS is struc-
tured in accordance with the way the work will be performed and reflects the way in which 
project costs and data will be summarized and eventually reported. Preparation of the WBS 
also considers other areas that require structured data, such as scheduling, configuration 
management, contract funding, and technical performance parameters. The WBS is the 
single most important element because it provides a common framework from which:
●
●
The total program can be described as a summation of subdivided elements.
●
●
Planning can be performed.
●
●
Costs and budgets can be established.
●
●
Time, cost, and performance can be tracked.
●
●
Objectives can be linked to company resources in a logical manner.
●
●
Schedules and status-reporting procedures can be established.
●
●
Network construction and control planning can be initiated.
●
●
The responsibility assignments for each element can be established.
The work breakdown structure acts as a vehicle for breaking the work down into 
smaller elements, thus providing a greater probability that every major and minor activ-
ity will be accounted for. Although a variety of work breakdown structures exist, the most 
common is the six-level indented structure shown below:

Level 1 is the total program and is composed of a set of projects. The summation of 
the activities and costs associated with each project must equal the total program. Each

PlAnnIng
project (level 2), however, can be broken down into tasks (level 3), where the summa-
tion of all tasks equals the summation of all projects, which, in turn, comprises the total 
program. The reason for this subdivision of effort is simply ease of control. Program 
management therefore becomes synonymous with the integration of activities, and the 
project manager acts as the integrator, using the work breakdown structure as the com-
mon framework. 
 Careful consideration must be given to the design and development of the WBS. From 
Figure  11–2 , the work breakdown structure can be used to provide the basis for:

Work Breakdown Structure
367
The upper three levels of the WBS are normally specified by the customer (if part of an 
RFP/RFQ) as the summary levels for reporting purposes. The lower levels are generated by 
the contractor for in-house control. Each level serves a vital purpose: Level 1 is generally 
used for the authorization and release of all work, budgets are prepared at level 2, and sched-
ules are prepared at level 3. Certain characteristics can now be generalized for these levels:
●
●
The top three levels of the WBS reflect integrated efforts and should not be related 
to one specific department. Effort required by departments or sections should be 
defined in subtasks and work packages.
●
●
The summation of all elements in one level must be the sum of all work in the next 
lower level.
●
●
Each element of work should be assigned to one and only one level of effort. For 
example, the construction of the foundation of a house should be included in one 
project (or task), not extended over two or three. (At level 5, the work packages 
should be identifiable and homogeneous.)
●
●
The level at which the project is managed is generally called the work package 
level. Actually, the work package can exist at any level below level one.
●
●
The WBS must be accompanied by a description of the scope of effort required, or 
else only those individuals who issue the WBS will have a complete understand-
ing of what work has to be accomplished. It is common practice to reproduce the 
customer’s statement of work as the description for the WBS.
●
●
It is often the best policy for the project manager, regardless of his technical exper-
tise, to allow all of the line managers to assess the risks in the SOW. After all, the 
line managers are usually the recognized experts in the organization.
Project managers normally manage at the top three levels of the WBS and prefer to 
provide status reports to management at these levels also.
The work package is the critical level for managing a work breakdown structure, as 
shown in Figure 11–3. However, it is possible that the actual management of the work 
packages is supervised and performed by the line managers with status reporting provided 
to the project manager at higher levels of the WBS.
Work packages are natural subdivisions of cost accounts and constitute the basic build-
ing blocks used by the contractor in planning, controlling, and measuring contract perfor-
mance. A work package is simply a low-level task or job assignment. It describes the work 
to be accomplished by a specific performing organization or a group of cost centers and 
serves as a vehicle for monitoring and reporting progress of work. Work package descrip-
tions must permit cost account managers and work package supervisors to understand and 
clearly distinguish one work package effort from another.
In setting up the work breakdown structure, tasks should:
●
●
Have clearly defined start and end dates
●
●
Be usable as a communications tool in which results can be compared with 
expectations
●
●
Be estimated on a “total” time duration, not when the task must start or end
●
●
Be structured so that a minimum of project office control and documentation 
(i.e., forms) is necessary

For large projects, planning will be time phased at the work package level of the WBS. 
The work package has the following characteristics:
●
●
Represents units of work at the level where the work is performed
●
●
Clearly distinguishes one work package from all others assigned to a single func-
tional group
●
●
Contains clearly defined start and end dates that are representative of physical 
accomplishment (This is accomplished after scheduling has been completed.)
●
●
Specifies a budget in terms of dollars, man-hours, or other measurable units
●
●
Limits the work to be performed to relatively short periods of time to minimize the 
work-in-process effort
Table 11-3 shows a simple work breakdown structure with the associated number-
ing system following the work breakdown. The first number represents the total pro-
gram (in this case, it is represented by 01), the second number represents the project, 
and the third number identifies the task. Therefore, number 01–03–00 represents project 3 
of program 01, whereas 01–03–02 represents task 2 of project 3. This type of number-
ing system is not standard; each company may have its own system, depending on how 
costs are to be controlled.
The preparation of the work breakdown structure is not easy. The WBS is a com-
munications tool, providing detailed information to different levels of management. If it 
does not contain enough levels, then the integration of activities may prove difficult. If 
too many levels exist, then unproductive time will be made to have the same number of 
levels for all projects, tasks, and so on. Each major work element should be considered 
by itself. Remember, the WBS establishes the number of required networks for cost 
control.

11.14 WBS DECOMPOSITION PROBLEMS
There is a common misconception that WBS decomposition is an easy task to perform. In 
the development of the WBS, the top three levels or management levels are usually roll-
up levels. Preparing templates at these levels is becoming common practice. However, at 
levels 4–6 of the WBS, templates may not be appropriate. There are reasons for this.
●
●
Breaking the work down to extremely small and detailed work packages may 
require the creation of hundreds or even thousands of cost accounts and charge 
numbers. This could increase the management, control, and reporting costs of 
these small packages to a point where the costs exceed the benefits.
●
●
Breaking the work down to small work packages can provide accurate cost control 
if, and only if, the line managers can determine the costs at this level of detail. 
Line managers must be given the right to tell project managers that costs cannot 
be determined at the requested level of detail.
●
●
The work breakdown structure is the basis for scheduling techniques such as the 
Arrow Diagramming Method and the Precedence Diagramming Method. At low 
levels of the WBS, the interdependencies between activities can become so com-
plex that meaningful networks cannot be constructed.
From a cost control point of view, cost analysis down to the fifth level is advantageous. 
However, it should be noted that the cost required to prepare cost analysis data to each 
lower level may increase exponentially, especially if the customer requires data to be pre-
sented in a specified format that is not part of the company’s standard operating procedures. 
The level-5 work packages are normally for in-house control only. Some companies bill 
customers separately for each level of cost reporting below level 3.
Once the WBS is established and the program is “kicked off,” it becomes a very costly 
procedure to either add or delete activities, or change levels of reporting because of cost 
control. Many companies do not give careful forethought to the importance of a properly 
developed WBS, and ultimately they risk cost control problems downstream. One impor-
tant use of the WBS is that it serves as a cost control standard for any future activities that 
may follow on or may just be similar.
Quite often work breakdown structures accompanying customer RFPs contain much 
more scope of effort, as specified by the statement of work, than the existing funding will 
support. This is done intentionally by the customer in hopes that a contractor may be will-
ing to “buy in.” If the contractor’s price exceeds the customer’s funding limitations, then 
the scope of effort must be reduced by eliminating activities from the WBS. By developing 
a separate project for administrative and indirect support activities, the customer can easily 
modify his costs by eliminating the direct support activities of the canceled effort.
There are also checklists that can be used in the preparation of 
the WBS:5
●
●
Develop a preliminary WBS to not lower than the top three levels for solicitation 
purposes (or lower if deemed necessary for some special reason).

●
●
Ensure that the contractor is required to extend the preliminary WBS in response 
to the solicitation, to identify and structure all contractor work to be compatible 
with his organization and management system.
●
●
Following negotiations, the CWBS included in the contract should not normally 
extend lower than the third level.
●
●
Ensure that the negotiated CWBS structure is compatible with reporting 
requirements.
●
●
Ensure that the negotiated CWBS is compatible with the contractor’s organization 
and management system.
●
●
Review the CWBS elements to ensure correlation with:
●
●
The specification tree
●
●
Contract line items
●
●
End-items of the contract
●
●
Data items required
●
●
Work statement tasks
●
●
Configuration management requirements
●
●
Define CWBS elements down to the level where such definitions are meaningful 
and necessary for management purposes (WBS dictionary).
●
●
Specify reporting requirements for selected CWBS elements if variations from 
standard reporting requirements are desired.
●
●
Ensure that the CWBS covers measurable effort, level of effort, apportioned effort, 
and subcontracts, if applicable.
●
●
Ensure that the total costs at a particular level will equal the sum of the costs of the 
constituent elements at the next lower level.
On simple projects, the WBS can be constructed as a “tree diagram” or according to the 
logic flow. In Figure 11–4, the tree diagram can follow the work or even the organizational

structure of the company (i.e., division, department, section, unit). The second method is 
to create a logic flow (see Figure 12.21) and cluster certain elements to represent tasks and 
projects. In the tree method, lower-level functional units may be assigned to one, and only 
one, work element, whereas in the logic flow method the lower-level functional units may 
serve several WBS elements.
The table below shows the three most common methods for structuring the WBS:

The flow method breaks the work down into systems and major subsystems. This 
method is well suited for projects less than two years in length. For longer projects, we use 
the life-cycle method, which is similar to the flow method. The organization method is used 
for projects that may be repetitive or require very little integration between functional units.
11.15 WORK BREAKDOWN STRUCTURE DICTIONARY
Work breakdown structures are actually numbering systems such as 
the last column in Table 11–3. Wording is often added into the WBS 
to provide clarity. As an example, project management software treats 
the WBS as a numbering system but may ask you for a description of the work package and 
the name or initials of the person responsible for that work package.
Perhaps the best way to understand the meaning and intent of each work package is 
to use a WBS dictionary. For each element in the WBS, the dictionary provides a brief 
description of each element, the name of the person or cost center responsible for that ele-
ment such as in a responsibility assignment matrix, the element’s milestones, and the final 
deliverable. The WBS dictionary can also identify the cost associated with that element, the 
charge number to be used, and the required resources by name or skill level. The dictionary 
can also provide a detailed technical description of each element and cross-listing to other 
WBS elements, quality requirements, and contractual documentation. The WBS dictionary 
is also cross-listed to the project’s work authorization form to be discussed in Chapter 15.
The WBS and the WBS dictionary can be used to support the scope verification 
process. Norman, Brotherton, and Fried state:6

Project Selection
373
During project execution, validation of the deliverables can be accomplished by referenc-
ing the deliverables as they have been described in the WBS and WBS Dictionary. Since 
the WBS and WBS Dictionary both describe project deliverables, including acceptance and 
completion criteria, these then become the reference points for validation and acceptance of 
the completed deliverables. The WBS and WBS Dictionary often are used additionally as 
a baseline for monitoring and measuring “wants” and “needs” versus the agreed upon pro-
ject scope. This ensures that the project does not attempt to deliver outcomes that are not 
included in the requirements. The WBS and WBS Dictionary help ensure the project team 
does attempt to deliver outcomes or quality that exceed the boundaries of the requirements 
while they also contain and control scope creep.
The WBS and WBS Dictionary help support communications between the project man-
ager, project team, sponsor(s) and stakeholders regarding the content and completion cri-
teria for the project deliverables. Without first developing the WBS, frequently the criteria 
for deliverable acceptance and completion are ill-defined, leading to misunderstanding and 
disagreement about the completion of specific project outcomes.
As work proceeds on the project, the WBS can be used as a checklist to determine what 
deliverables have and have not been completed or accepted. When communicated via the 
status report and other vehicles in the project’s Communications Plan, this helps ensure that 
all project stakeholders clearly understand the current state of the project.
At the end of the project, Scope Verification supports the transition of the project to 
ongoing operations as well as closure of any open contracts or subcontracts. Here again 
the WBS is used as the basis for verification and as a key input to the contract and project 
closure processes.
11.16 PROJECT SELECTION
A prime responsibility of senior management (and possibly project sponsors) is the selec-
tion of projects. Most organizations have an established selection criteria, which can be 
subjective, objective, quantitative, qualitative, or simply a seat-of-the-pants guess. In any 
event, there should be a valid reason for selecting the project.
From a financial perspective, project selection is basically a two-part process. First, 
the organization will conduct a feasibility study to determine whether the project can be 
done. The second part is to perform a benefit-to-cost analysis to see whether the company 
should do it.
The purpose of the feasibility study is to validate that the project meets feasibility of 
cost, technological, safety, marketability, and ease of execution requirements. The com-
pany may use outside consultants or subject matter experts (SMEs) to assist in both fea-
sibility studies and benefit-to-cost analyses. A project manager may not be assigned until 
after the feasibility study is completed.
As part of the feasibility process during project selection, senior management often 
solicits input from SMEs and lower-level managers through rating models. The rating mod-
els normally identify the business and/or technical criteria against which the ratings will be 
made. Figure 11–5 shows a scaling model for a single project. Figure 11–6 shows a check-
list rating system to evaluate three projects at once. Figure 11–7 shows a scoring model for 
multiple projects using weighted averages.

If the project is deemed feasible and a good fit with the strategic plan, 
then the project is prioritized for development along with other projects. 
Once feasibility is determined, a benefit-to-cost analysis is performed to 
validate that the project will, if executed correctly, provide the required financial and nonfinan-
cial benefits. Benefit-to-cost analyses require significantly more information to be scrutinized 
than is usually available during a feasibility study. This can be an expensive proposition.
Estimating benefits and costs in a timely manner is very difficult. Benefits are often 
defined as:
●
●
Tangible benefits for which dollars may be reasonably quantified and measured.
●
●
Intangible benefits that may be quantified in units other than dollars or may be 
identified and described subjectively.
Costs are significantly more difficult to quantify. The minimum costs that must be 
determined are those that specifically are used for comparison to the benefits. These include:
●
●
The current operating costs or the cost of operating in today’s circumstances.
●
●
Future period costs that are expected and can be planned for.
●
●
Intangible costs that may be difficult to quantify. These costs are often omitted if 
quantification would contribute little to the decision-making process.

Planning 
There must be careful documentation of all known constraints and assumptions that 
were made in developing the costs and the benefits. Unrealistic or unrecognized assump-
tions are often the cause of unrealistic benefits. The go or no-go decision to continue with 
a project could very well rest upon the validity of the assumptions.
Table 11–4 shows the major differences between feasibility studies and benefit-to-cost 
analyses.
Today, the project manager may end up participating in the project selection process. 
In Chapter 1, we discussed the new breed of project manager, namely a person that has 
excellent business skills as well as project management skills. These business skills now

allow us to bring the project manager on board the project at the beginning of the initiation 
phase rather than at the end of the initiation phase because the project manager can now

11.17 THE ROLE OF THE EXECUTIVE IN PLANNING
Executives are responsible for selecting the project manager, and the person chosen should 
have planning expertise. Not all technical specialists are good planners. Likewise, some 
people who are excellent in execution have minimal planning skills. Executives must make

Planning 
sure that whoever is assigned as the project manager has both planning and execution 
skills. In addition, executives must take an active role during project planning activities 
especially if they also function as project sponsors.8
Executives must not arbitrarily set unrealistic milestones and then “force” line man-
agers to fulfill them. Both project and line managers should try to adhere to unrealistic 
milestones, but if a line manager says he cannot, executives should comply because the line 
manager is supposedly the expert.
Executives should interface with project and line personnel during the planning stage 
in order to define the requirements and establish reasonable deadlines. Executives must 
realize that creating an unreasonable deadline may require the reestablishment of priorities, 
and, of course, changing priorities can push milestones backward.
11.18 MANAGEMENT COST AND CONTROL SYSTEM
On long-term projects, phasing can be overdone, resulting in extra costs and delays. To 
prevent this, many project-driven companies resort to other types of systems, such as a 
management cost and control system (MCCS). No program or project can be efficiently 
organized and managed without some form of management cost and control system. 
­Figure 11–8 shows the five phases of a management cost and control system. The first 
phase constitutes the planning cycle, and the next four phases identify the operating cycle.
Figure 11–9 shows the activities included in the planning cycle. The work breakdown 
structure serves as the initial control from which all planning emanates. The WBS acts as a 
vital artery for communications and operations in all phases. A comprehensive analysis of 
management cost and control systems is presented in Chapter 15.
8.   Although this section is called “The Role of the Executive in Planning,” it also applies to line management 
if project sponsorship is pushed down to the middle-management level or lower. This is quite common in highly 
mature project management organizations where senior management has sufficient faith in line management’s 
ability to serve as project sponsors.

379
11.19 WORK PLANNING AUTHORIZATION
After receipt of a contract, some form of authorization is needed 
before work can begin, even in the planning stage. Both work author-
ization and work planning authorization are used to release funds, 
but for different purposes. Work planning authorization releases 
funds (primarily for functional management) so that scheduling, costs, budgets, and all 
other types of plans can be prepared prior to the release of operational cycle funds, which 
hereafter shall be referred to simply as work authorization. Both forms of authorization 
require the same paperwork. In many companies this work authorization is identified as 
a subdivided work description (SWD), which is a narrative description of the effort to be 
performed by the cost center (division-level minimum).
The SWD is one of the key elements in the planning of a program, as shown in 
Figure 11–9. Contract control and administration releases the contract funds by issuing 
a SWD, which sets forth general contractual requirements and authorizes program man-
agement to proceed. Program management issues the SWD to set forth the contractual 
guidelines and requirements for the functional units. The SWD specifies how the work will 
be performed, which functional organizations will be involved, and who has what specific 
responsibilities, and authorizes the utilization of resources within a given time period.

380
Planning 
The subdivided work description package is used by the operating organizations to 
further subdivide the effort defined by the WBS into small segments or work packages.
Many people contend that if the data in the work authorization document are different 
from what was originally defined in the proposal, the project is in trouble right at the start. This 
may not be the case, because most projects are priced out assuming “unlimited” resources, 
whereas the hours and dollars in the work authorization document are based upon “limited” 
resources. This situation is common for companies that thrive on competitive bidding.
11.20 WHY DO PLANS FAIL?
No matter how hard we try, planning is not perfect, and sometimes plans fail. Typical rea-
sons include:
●
●
Corporate goals are not understood at the lower organizational levels.
●
●
Plans encompass too much in too little time.
●
●
Financial estimates are poor.
●
●
Plans are based on insufficient data.
●
●
No attempt is being made to systematize the planning process.
●
●
Planning is performed by a planning group.
●
●
No one knows the ultimate objective.
●
●
No one knows the staffing requirements.
●
●
No one knows the major milestone dates, including written reports.
●
●
Project estimates are best guesses, and are not based on standards or history.
●
●
Not enough time has been given for proper estimating.
●
●
No one has bothered to see if there will be personnel available with the necessary 
skills.
●
●
People are not working toward the same specifications.
●
●
People are consistently shuffled in and out of the project with little regard for 
schedule.
Why do these situations occur? If corporate goals are not understood, it is because 
corporate executives have been negligent in providing the necessary strategic information 
and feedback. If a plan fails because of extreme optimism, then the responsibility lies with 
both the project and line managers for not assessing risk. Project managers should ask the 
line managers if the estimates are optimistic or pessimistic, and expect an honest answer. 
Erroneous financial estimates are the responsibility of the line manager. If the project fails 
because of a poor definition of the requirements, then the project manager is totally at fault.
Sometimes project plans fail because simple details are forgotten or overlooked. 
Examples of this might be:
●
●
Neglecting to tell a line manager early enough that the prototype is not ready and 
that rescheduling is necessary.
●
●
Neglecting to see if the line manager can still provide additional employees for the 
next two weeks because it was possible to do so six months ago.

Handling Project Phaseouts And Transfers
381
11.21 STOPPING PROJECTS
There are always situations in which projects have to be stopped. 
Nine reasons for stopping are:
●
●
Final achievement of the objectives
●
●
Poor initial planning and market prognosis
●
●
A better alternative is found
●
●
A change in the company interest and strategy
●
●
Allocated time is exceeded
●
●
Budgeted costs are exceeded
●
●
Key people leave the organization
●
●
Personal whims of management
●
●
Problem too complex for the resources available
Today most of the reasons why projects are not completed on time and within cost are 
behavioral rather than quantitative. They include:
●
●
Poor morale
●
●
Poor human relations
●
●
Poor labor productivity
●
●
No commitment by those involved in the project
The last item appears to be the cause of the first three items in many situations.
Once the reasons for cancellation are defined, the next problem concerns how to stop 
the project. Some of the ways are:
●
●
Orderly planned termination
●
●
The “hatchet” (withdrawal of funds and removal of personnel)
●
●
Reassignment of people to higher priority tasks
●
●
Redirection of efforts toward different objectives
●
●
Burying it or letting it die on the vine (i.e., not taking any official action)
11.22 HANDLING PROJECT PHASEOUTS AND TRANSFERS
By definition, projects (and even life-cycle phases) have an end point. 
Closing out is a very important phase in the project life cycle, which 
should follow particular disciplines and procedures with the objective of:
●
●
Effectively bringing the project to closure according to agreed-on contractual 
requirements
●
●
Preparing for the transition of the project into the next operational phase, such as 
from production to field installation, field operation, or training

●
●
Identifying and pursuing follow-on business
Although most project managers are completely cognizant of the necessity for proper 
planning for project start-up, many project managers neglect planning for project termina-
tion. Planning for project termination includes:
●
●
Transferring responsibility
●
●
Completion of project records
●
●

●

●
●

●
●

●
●

●
●
Preparing for financial payments
Project success or failure often depends on management’s ability to handle personnel 
issues properly during this final phase.
Given business realities, it is difficult to transfer project personnel under ideal condi-
tions. The following suggestions may increase organizational effectiveness and minimize 
personal stress when closing out a project:
●
●
Carefully plan the project closeout on the part of both project and functional 
managers. Use a checklist to prepare the plan.
●
●
Establish a simple project closeout procedure that identifies the major steps and 
responsibilities.
●
●
Treat the closeout phase like any other project, with clearly delineated tasks, 
agreed-on responsibilities, schedules, budgets, and deliverable items or results.
●
●
Understand the interaction of behavioral and organizational elements in order to 
build an environment conducive to teamwork during this final project phase.
●
●
Emphasize the overall goals, applications, and utilities of the project as well as its 
business impact.
●
●
Secure top-management involvement and support.
●
●
Be aware of conflict, fatigue, shifting priorities, and technical or logistic problems. 
Try to identify and deal with these problems when they start to develop. Communi-
cating progress through regularly scheduled status meetings is the key to managing 
these problems.

Detailed Schedules and Charts
383
●
●
Keep project personnel informed of upcoming job opportunities. Resource man-
agers should discuss and negotiate new assignments with personnel and involve 
people already in the next project.
●
●
Be aware of rumors. If a reorganization or layoff is inevitable, the situation should 
be described in a professional manner or people will assume the worst.
●
●
Assign a contract administrator dedicated to company-oriented projects. He will 
protect your financial position and business interests by following through on 
customer sign-offs and final payment.
11.23 DETAILED SCHEDULES AND CHARTS
The scheduling of activities is the first major requirement of the program office after 
program go-ahead. The program office normally assumes full responsibility for activity 
scheduling if the activity is not too complex.
Activity scheduling is probably the single most important tool for determining how 
company resources should be integrated. Activity schedules are invaluable for projecting 
time-phased resource utilization requirements, providing a basis for visually tracking per-
formance and estimating costs. The schedules serve as master plans from which both the 
customer and management have an up-to-date picture of operations.
Certain guidelines should be followed in the preparation of schedules, regardless of 
the projected use or complexity:
●
●
All major events and dates must be clearly identified. If a statement of work is 
supplied by the customer, those dates shown on the accompanying schedules must 
be included. If for any reason the customer’s milestone dates cannot be met, the 
customer should be notified immediately.
●
●
The exact sequence of work should be defined through a network in which inter-
relationships between events can be identified.
●
●
Schedules should be directly relatable to the work breakdown structure. If the 
WBS is developed according to a specific sequence of work, then it becomes an 
easy task to identify work sequences in schedules using the same numbering sys-
tem as in the WBS. The minimum requirement should be to show where and when 
all tasks start and finish.
●
●
All schedules must identify the time constraints and, if possible, should identify 
those resources required for each event.
Although these four guidelines relate to schedule preparation, they do not define how 
complex the schedules should be. Before preparing schedules, three questions should be 
considered:
●
●
How many events or activities should each network have?
●
●
How much of a detailed technical breakdown should be included?
●
●
Who is the intended audience for this schedule?

384
Planning 
Most organizations develop multiple schedules: summary schedules for management 
and planners and detailed schedules for the doers and lower-level control. The detailed 
schedules may be strictly for interdepartmental activities. Program management must 
approve all schedules down through the first three levels of the work breakdown structure. 
For lower-level schedules (i.e., detailed interdepartmental), program management may or 
may not request a sign of approval.
One of the most difficult problems to identify in schedules is a hedge position. A 
hedge position is a situation in which the contractor may not be able to meet a customer’s 
milestone date without incurring a risk, or may not be able to meet activity requirements 
following a milestone date because of contractual requirements.
Detailed schedules are prepared for almost every activity. It is the responsibility of the 
program office to marry all of the detailed schedules into one master schedule to verify that 
all activities can be completed as planned. The preparation sequence for schedules (and 
also for program plans) is shown in Figure 11–10. The program office submits a request 
for detailed schedules to the functional managers and the functional managers prepare 
summary schedules, detailed schedules, and, if time permits, interdepartmental schedules. 
Each functional manager then reviews his schedules with the program office. The program 
office, together with the functional program team members, integrates all of the plans and 
schedules and verifies that all contractual dates can be met.
Before the schedules are finalized, rough drafts of each schedule and plan should be 
reviewed with the customer. This procedure accomplishes the following:
●
●
Verifies that nothing has fallen through the cracks
●
●
Prevents immediate revisions to a published document and can prevent embarrass-
ing moments
●
●
Minimizes production costs by reducing the number of early revisions
●
●
Shows customers early in the program that you welcome their help and input into 
the planning phase

Master Production Scheduling

After the document is finalized, it should be distributed to all program office person-
nel, functional team members, functional management, and the customer. In addition to 
the detailed schedules, the program office, with input provided by functional management, 
must develop organization charts. The charts show who has responsibility for each activ-
ity and display the formal (and often the informal) lines of communication. The program 
office may also establish linear responsibility charts (LRCs). In spite of the best attempts 
by management, many functions in an organization may overlap between functional units. 
Also, management might wish to have the responsibility for a certain activity given to a 
functional unit that normally would not have that responsibility. This is a common occur-
rence on short-duration programs where management desires to cut costs and red tape.
Project personnel should keep in mind why the schedule was developed. The primary 
objective is usually to coordinate activities to complete the project with the:
●
●
Best time
●
●
Least cost
●
●
Least risk
There are also secondary objectives of scheduling:
●
●
Studying alternatives
●
●
Developing an optimal schedule
●
●
Using resources effectively
●
●
Communicating
●
●
Refining the estimating criteria
●
●
Obtaining good project control
●
●
Providing for easy revisions
Large projects, especially long-term efforts, may require a “war room.” All of the walls 
are covered with large schedules, perhaps printed on blueprint paper, and each wall could 
have numerous sliding panels. The schedules and charts on each wall could be updated on 
a daily basis. The room would be used for customer briefings, team meetings, and any other 
activities related specifically to this project.
11.24 MASTER PRODUCTION SCHEDULING
A master production schedule is a statement of what will be made, how many units will 
be made, and when they will be made.9 It is a production plan, not a sales plan. The MPS 
considers the total demand on a plant’s resources, including finished product sales, spare 
(repair) part needs, and inter-plant needs. The MPS must also consider the capacity of the 
plant and the requirements imposed on vendors. Provisions are made in the overall plan 
for each manufacturing facility’s operation. All planning for materials, manpower, plant, 
equipment, and financing for the facility is driven by the master production schedule.
9.   The master production schedule is being discussed here because of its importance in the planning cycle. The 
MPS cannot be fully utilized without effective inventory control procedures.

386
Planning 
Objectives of master production scheduling are:
●
●
To provide top management with a means to authorize and control manpower 
levels, inventory investment, and cash flow
●
●
To coordinate marketing, manufacturing, engineering, and finance activities by a 
common performance objective
●
●
To reconcile marketing and manufacturing needs
●
●
To provide an overall measure of performance
●
●
To provide data for material and capacity planning
The development of a master production schedule is a very important step in a planning 
cycle. Master production schedules directly tie together personnel, materials, equipment, and 
facilities, as shown in Figure 11–11. Master production schedules also identify key dates to 
the customer, should he wish to visit the contractor during specific operational periods.
11.25 PROJECT PLAN
A project plan is fundamental to the success of any project. For large and 
often complex projects, customers may require a project plan that docu-
ments all activities within the program. The project plan then serves as a 
management guideline for the lifetime of the project and may be revised 
as often as once a month, depending on the circumstances and the type of 
project (i.e., research and development projects require more revisions to the project plan than 
manufacturing or construction projects). The project plan provides the following framework:
●
●
Eliminates conflicts between functional managers
●
●
Eliminates conflicts between functional management and program management
●
●
Provides a standard communications tool throughout the lifetime of the project (It 
should be geared to the work breakdown structure)
●
●
Provides verification that the contractor understands the customer’s objectives and 
requirements
●
●
Provides a means for identifying inconsistencies in the planning phase
●
●
Provides a means for early identification of problem areas and risks so that no 
surprises occur downstream
●
●
Contains all of the schedules needed for progress analysis and reporting

Project Plan
387
Development of a project plan can be time-consuming and costly. All levels of the 
organization participate. The upper levels provide summary information, and the lower lev-
els provide the details. The project plan, like activity schedules, does not preclude depart-
ments from developing their own plans.
The project plan must identify how the company resources will be integrated. The pro-
cess is similar to the sequence of events for schedule preparation, shown in Figure 11–10. 
Since the project plan must explain the events in Figure 11–10, additional iterations are 
required, which can cause changes in a project. This can be seen in Figure 11–12.

Planning 
The project plan is a standard from which performance can be measured by the cus-
tomer and the project and functional managers. The plan serves as a cookbook by answer-
ing these questions for all personnel identified with the project:
●
●
What will be accomplished?
●
●
How will it be accomplished?
●
●
Where will it be accomplished?
●
●
When will it be accomplished?
●
●
Why will it be accomplished?
The answers to these questions force both the contractor and the customer to take a 
hard look at:
●
●
Project requirements
●
●
Project management
●
●
Project schedules
●
●
Facility requirements
●
●
Logistic support
●
●
Financial support
●
●
Manpower and organization
The project plan is more than just a set of instructions. It is an attempt to eliminate 
crisis by preventing anything from “falling through the cracks.” The plan is documented 
and approved by both the customer and the contractor to determine what data, if any, 
are missing and the probable resulting effect. As the project matures, the project plan 
is revised to account for new or missing data. The most common reasons for revising a 
plan are:
●
●
“Crashing” activities to meet end dates
●
●
Trade-off decisions involving manpower, scheduling, and performance
●
●
Adjusting and leveling manpower requests
The makeup of the project plan may vary from contractor to contractor. Most project 
plans can be subdivided into four main sections: introduction, summary, and conclusions, 
management, and technical. The complexity of the information is usually up to the discre-
tion of the contractor, provided that customer requirements, as may be specified in the 
statement of work, are satisfied.
The introductory section contains the definition of the project and the major parts 
involved. If the project follows another, or is an outgrowth of similar activities, this 
is indicated, together with a brief summary of the background and history behind the 
project.
The summary and conclusion chapter is usually the second section in the project 
plan so that upper-level customer management can have a complete overview of the pro-
ject without having to search through the technical information. This section identifies 

the targets and objectives of the project and includes the necessary “lip service” on 
how successful the project will be and how all problems can be overcome. This section 
must also include the project master schedule showing how all projects and activities 
are related.
The management section of the project plan contains procedures, charts, and schedules 
as follows:
●
●
The assignment of key personnel to the project is indicated. This usually refers 
only to the project office personnel and team members, since under normal opera-
tions these will be the only individuals interfacing with customers.
●
●
Manpower, planning, and training are discussed to assure customers that qualified 
people will be available from the functional units.
●
●
A linear responsibility chart might also be included to identify to customers the 
authority relationships that will exist in the program.
Situations exist in which the management section may be omitted from the proposal. 
For a follow-up program, the customer may not require this section if management’s posi-
tions are unchanged. Management sections are also not required if the management infor-
mation was previously provided in the proposal or if the customer and contractor have 
continuous business dealings.
The technical section may include as much as 75 to 90 percent of the program plan, 
especially if the effort includes research and development, and may require constant updat-
ing as the project matures. The following items can be included as part of the technical 
section:
●
●
A detailed breakdown of the charts and schedules used in the project master sched-
ule, possibly including schedule/cost estimates.
●
●
A listing of the testing to be accomplished for each activity. (It is best to include 
the exact testing matrices.)
●
●
Procedures for accomplishment of the testing. This might also include a descrip-
tion of the key elements in the operations or manufacturing plans, as well as a 
listing of the facility and logistic requirements.
●
●
Identification of materials and material specifications. (This might also include 
system specifications.)
●
●
An attempt to identify the risks associated with specific technical requirements 
(not commonly included). This assessment tends to scare management person-
nel who are unfamiliar with the technical procedures, so it should be omitted if 
possible.
The project plan, as used here, contains a description of all phases of the project. For 
many projects, especially large ones, detailed planning is required for all major events and 
activities. Table 11–5 identifies the type of individual plans that may be required in place 
of a (total) project plan. These are often called subsidiary plans.
Project Plan

Planning 
The project plan, once agreed on by the contractor and customer, is then used to provide 
project direction. This is shown in Figure 11–13. If the project plan is written clearly, then 
any functional manager or supervisor should be able to identify what is expected of him. The 
project plan should be distributed to each member of the project team, all functional manag-
ers and supervisors interfacing with the project, and all key functional personnel.

The Project Charter
391
One final note need be mentioned concerning the legality of the project plan. The pro-
ject plan may be specified contractually to satisfy certain requirements as identified in the 
customer’s statement of work. The contractor retains the right to decide how to accomplish 
this, unless, of course, this is also identified in the SOW.
11.26 THE PROJECT CHARTER
The original concept behind the project charter was to document the 
project manager’s authority and responsibility, especially for projects 
implemented away from the home office. Today, the project charter 
is more of an internal legal document identifying to the line managers and their personnel 
the project manager’s authority and responsibility and the management- and/or customer-
approved scope of the project.
Theoretically, the sponsor prepares the charter and affixes his/her signature, but in 
reality, the project manager may prepare it for the sponsor’s signature. At a minimum, the 
charter should include:
●
●
Identification of the project manager and his/her authority to apply resources to 
the project
●
●
The business purpose that the project was undertaken to address, including all 
assumptions and constraints
●
●
Summary of the conditions defining the project
●
●
Description of the project
●
●
Objectives and constraints on the project
●
●
Project scope (inclusions and exclusions)
●
●
Key stakeholders and their roles
●
●
Risks
●
●
Involvement by certain stakeholders
The charter is a “legal” agreement between the project manager and the company. 
Some companies supplement the charter with a “contract” that functions as an agreement 
between the project and the line organizations.
Some companies have converted the charter into a highly detailed document containing:
●
●
The scope baseline/scope statement
●
●
Scope and objectives of the project (SOW)
●
●
Specifications
●
●
WBS (template levels)
●
●
Timing
●
●
Spending plan (S-curve)
●
●

●
●

●
●

When the project charter contains a scope baseline and management plan, the project 
charter may function as the project plan. This is not really an effective use of the charter, 
but it may be acceptable on certain types of projects for internal customers.
11.27 PROJECT BASELINES
Executives and clients expect project managers to effectively monitor 
and control projects. As part of monitoring and control, project man-
agers must prepare progress, status, and forecast reports that clearly 
articulate the performance of the project. But to measure perfor-
mance, one needs a reference point or baseline from which measure-
ments can be made. The necessity for a baseline is clear:
●
●
Without a baseline, performance cannot be measured.
●
●
If performance cannot be measured, it cannot be managed.
●
●
Performance that can be measured gets watched.
●
●
What gets watched gets done.
For a project to be able to be controlled, it must be organized as a closed system. The 
closed system is defined as the project management plan. This requires that baselines be 
established for scope, quality, time, and cost at a minimum. Without such baselines, a 
project is considered out of control and it may be impossible to track what has changed 
without knowing where you started.
The project management plan usually contains component plans which describe the 
baselines:
●
●
Scope management plan: describes the scope baseline which includes the scope 
statement, WBS and WBS dictionary
●
●
Schedule management plan: describes the steps for planning, monitoring and con-
trolling the schedule
●
●
Quality management plan: describes the activities needed to achieve the quality 
objectives
●
●
Cost management plan: describes the steps for estimating and controlling the costs
There can be other baselines and plans that are included in the project management 
plan.

Performance Measurement 
Baseline
The reference point for measuring performance is the performance 
measurement baseline (PMB). It serves as the metric benchmark 
against which performance is measured in terms of time, cost, and scope. It is also used as 
the basis for business value tracking.

Project Baselines
393
The principal reasons for establishing, approving, controlling, and documenting the 
PMB are to:
●
●
Ensure achievement of project objectives
●
●
Manage and monitor progress during project execution
●
●
Ensure accurate information on the accomplishment of the deliverables and 
requirements
●
●
Establish performance measurement criteria
The PMB is finalized at the end of the planning phase once the requirements have been 
defined, the initial costs have been developed and approved, and the schedule has been set. 
Once established, the PMB serves as the benchmark from which to measure and gauge 
the project’s progress. The baseline is used to measure how actual progress compares to 
planned performance. Performance measurement may be meaningless without an accurate 
baseline as a starting point. Unfortunately, project managers tend to create baselines based 
upon just those elements of work they feel are important and this may or may not be in full 
alignment with customer requirements. The baseline is what the project manager plans to 
do, not necessarily what the customer has asked for.
Rebaselining
Projects undergo scope changes for a variety of reasons, including:
●	 Customer requested changes or add-ons
●	 Team requested changes or add-ons
●	 Poor initial understanding or interpretation of customer  
requirements
●
●
Poorly defined performance or flawed baseline
●
●
Unfavorable variances that cannot be corrected
When changes to the baseline are requested, we go through a change control board 
(CCB) made up of stakeholders from both the customer’s and contractor’s organizations. 
At this change control board meeting, the following questions are addressed:
●
●
The cost of the change
●
●
The impact on the schedule
●
●
The impact on other competing constraints
●
●
The value added for the client
●
●
Any additional risks
●
●
The potential impact on other projects
If the CCB approves the change, then the very first document to be updated is the per-
formance baseline. Once rebaselining occurs, the new baseline is redefined as the original 
or previous baseline plus the approved changes. Records of all changes are maintained in 
archives to show how the plan changed over time. It is important to remember that projects 
seldom run exactly according to plan and traceability of changes is essential.
PMBOK® Guide, 6th Edition
5.6 Control Scope

394
Planning 
Developing the PMB
The following steps show a logical approach to creating a PMB:
●
●
Review the project’s business case and accompanying constraints and assump-
tions: This is a necessity in order to understand the business boundary of the PMB.
●
●
Establish a requirements baseline: This comes from a review of the customer’s 
requirements and the contractual statement of work (CSOW). The requirements 
baseline is what the project manager plans to achieve and may contain inclusions 
and exclusions from the customer’s original requirements documentation. This 
establishes the technical boundary for the PMB and feeds into the project’s scope 
statement.
●
●
Convert the requirements baseline into a WBS: Decompose the work into work 
packages. Each work package should have measurable milestones such that 
accomplishment of deliverables and performance can be measured. Create a WBS 
dictionary. The scope baseline can now be defined as the scope statement plus the 
WBS plus the WBS dictionary.
●
●
Arrange the work packages into a logical network of activities: This then becomes 
the schedule baseline.
●
●
Price out the time-phased schedule, including both direct and indirect costs: This 
then becomes the distributed budget. If the project is multiyear, then work for the 
following years may not be broken down into work packages yet, even though a 
budget has been established for each year. This is called an undistributed budget. 
The summation of the distributed and undistributed budgets make up the cost 
baseline for the project.
●
●
The cost baseline does not include the management reserve: The cost baseline is 
based upon distributed and undistributed budgets you plan on spending over the 
life of the project. The management reserve is money you hopefully do not plan 
on spending.
●
●
Finalize the PMB: The PMB is the summation of the scope, schedule, and cost 
baselines.
●
●
Prepare a requirements traceability matrix (RTM): The RTM links the projects 
requirements to the WBS and the PMB and is used to verify project requirements 
are being met.
●
●
Identify the key metrics or key performance indicators (KPIs): These metrics are 
what will be monitored to determine performance and accomplishment of deliv-
erables and requirements.
These baselines are a necessity for change/version control. Without these baselines, 
status and the measurement of progress may become meaningless. And if measurement 
cannot be determined with some degree of accuracy, then no objective information may be 
found and it may be impossible to determine the true value of what has been accomplished.
While the baseline serves as an excellent reference point, projects can still become 
derailed, resulting in continuous changes to the PMB. Typical causes include:
●
●
Failing to administer the work orders correctly
●
●
Failing to control the budget

In addition to the scope baseline, also known as the technical baseline, 
the cost baseline, and the schedule baseline, there can be other base-
lines based upon the firm’s business practices and the type of industry. A brief list of these 
might include:
●
●
Functional baseline: System and/or functional requirements such as specifica-
tions, contracts, etc.
●
●
Allocated baseline: State of the work products once requirements are approved
●
●
Developmental baseline: State of work and products during development
●
●
Product baseline: Functional and physical characteristics of the project
●
●
Resources baseline: Number and quality of the resources over the project’s ­duration
●
●
Fixed baseline: A baseline that remains fixed for the lifetime of the project
●
●
Revisable baseline: A baseline that is allowed to vary over the life of the project
●
●
Project-specific baseline: A baseline designed for one and only one project
●
●
Multiproject baseline: A baseline that can be applied to a number of similar projects
11.28 VERIFICATION AND VALIDATION
The terms verification and validation (V&V) are often used in con-
junction with the PMB. Verification is sometimes seen as a quality 
control process that is used to evaluate whether or not a product, ser-
vice, or system complies with regulations, specifications, or condi-
tions imposed at the start of a development phase. Verification can 
occur in development, scale-up, or production. This is often an inter-
nally performed assessment process.
Verification is actually the acceptance of the deliverables, whereas quality control 
refers to the correctness of the deliverables. Sometimes, verification and quality control 
can be done in parallel, but it is more common for quality control to come first.
Validation is the quality assurance process of establishing evidence or assurance that a 
product, service, or system will accomplish its intended requirements. This often involves 
meeting acceptance criteria or fitness for purpose. When providing a list of the project’s 
requirements, stakeholders and clients may provide product acceptance criteria, which state 
the criteria and processes for accepting completed deliverables. The acceptance criteria can 
include information on:
●
●
Target dates
●
●
Functionality
Verification and Validation
395
●
●
Having a project management information system that does not provide meaning-
ful data
●
●
Poor understanding and use of the earned-value measurement system

●
●
Constant replanning and baseline fluctuations
●
●
Unnecessary or unwanted changes by management

It is sometimes said that verification can be expressed by the query “Are you building 
the thing right?” and validation by “Are you building the right thing?” “Building the right 
thing” refers back to the user’s needs, while “building it right” checks that the specifica-
tions are correctly implemented by the system (see Table 11.6). In some contexts, it is 
required to have written requirements for both as well as formal procedures or protocols 
for determining compliance.
Verification does not necessarily detect incorrect input specifications. Therefore, 
verification and validation must be performed to ensure that the system or deliverable is 
operational. At the completion of verification and validation, we often obtain a certificate 
or written guarantee that the system, component, or deliverable complies with its specified 
requirements and is acceptable for operation use.
11.29 MANAGEMENT CONTROL
Because the planning phase provides the fundamental guidelines for 
the remainder of the project, careful management control must be 
established.
In addition, since planning is an ongoing activity for a variety of different programs, 
management guidelines must be established on a company-wide basis in order to achieve 
unity and coherence.
All functional organizations and individuals working directly or indirectly on a 
program are responsible for identifying, to the project manager, scheduling and plan-
ning problems that require corrective action during both the planning cycle and the

operating cycle. The program manager bears the ultimate and final responsibility for 
identifying requirements for corrective actions. Management policies and directives 
are written specifically to assist the program manager in defining the requirements. 
Without clear definitions during the planning phase, many projects run off in a variety 
of directions.
11.30 CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT
A critical tool employed by a project manager is configuration man-
agement or configuration change control. As projects progress down-
stream through the various life-cycle phases, the cost of engineering 
changes can grow boundlessly. It is not uncommon for companies to bid on proposals at 
40 percent below their own cost hoping to make up the difference downstream with engi-
neering changes. It is also quite common for executives to “encourage” project managers 
to seek out engineering changes because of their profitability.
Configuration management is a control technique, through an orderly process, for for-
mal review and approval of configuration changes. If properly implemented, configuration 
management provides
●
●
Appropriate levels of review and approval for changes
●
●
Focal points for those seeking to make changes
●
●
A single point of input to contracting representatives in the customer’s and con-
tractor’s office for approved changes
At a minimum, the configuration control committee should include representation 
from the customer, contractor, and line group initiating the change. Discussions should 
answer the following questions:
●
●
What is the cost of the change?
●
●
Do the changes improve quality?
●
●
Is the additional cost for this quality justifiable?
●
●
Is the change necessary?
●
●
Is there an impact on the delivery date?
Changes cost money. Therefore, it is imperative that configuration management be 
implemented correctly. The following steps can enhance the implementation process:
●
●
Define the starting point or “baseline” configuration
●
●
Define the “classes” of changes
●
●
Define the necessary controls or limitations on both the customer and contractor
●
●
Identify policies and procedures, such as board chairman, voters/alternatives, 
meeting time, agenda, approval forums, step-by-step processes, and expedition 
processes in case of emergencies

Effective configuration control pleases both customer and contractor. Overall benefits 
include:
●
●
Better communication among staff
●
●
Better communication with the customer
●
●
Better technical intelligence
●
●
Reduced confusion for changes
●
●
Screening of frivolous changes
●
●
Providing a paper trail
As a final note, it must be understood that configuration control, as used here, is not a 
replacement for design review meetings or customer interface meetings. These meetings 
are still an integral part of all projects.
11.31 ENTERPRISE PROJECT MANAGEMENT METHODOLOGIES
Enterprise project management methodologies can enhance the project planning process as 
well as provide some degree of standardization and consistency.
Companies have come to the realization that enterprise project management method-
ologies work best if the methodology is based upon templates rather than rigid policies and 
procedures. The International Institute for Learning has created a Unified Project Man-
agement Methodology (UPMM™) with templates categorized according to the PMBOK® 
Guide Areas of Knowledge.10 Table 11–7 identifies the types of templates based on the 
different areas of a project.

11.32 PROJECT AUDITS
The necessity for a structured independent review of various parts of a business, including 
projects, has taken on a more important role. Part of this can be attributed to the Sarbanes–
Oxley law compliance requirements. These independent reviews are audits that focus on 
either discovery or decision making. The audits can be scheduled or random and can be 
performed by in-house personnel or external examiners.
Some common audit types include:
●
●
Performance audits: Used to appraise the progress and performance of a given 
project. The project manager, project sponsor, or an executive steering committee 
can conduct this audit.
●
●
Compliance audits: Usually performed by the project management office (PMO) 
to validate that the project is using the project management methodology properly. 
Usually the PMO has the authority to perform the audit but may not have the 
authority to enforce compliance.
●
●
Quality audits: Ensure that the planned project quality is being met and that all 
laws and regulations are being followed. The quality assurance group performs 
this audit.
●
●
Exit audits: Usually for projects that are in trouble and may need to be terminated. 
Personnel external to the project, such as an exit champion or an executive steering 
committee, conduct the audits.

400
Planning 
●
●
Best practices audits: Conducted at the end of each life-cycle phase or at the end of 
the project. Project managers may not be the best individuals to perform the audit. 
Professional facilitators trained in conducting best practices reviews are used.

11–3	 The project start-up phase is complete, and you are now ready to finalize the operational 
plan. Below are six steps that are often part of the finalization procedure. Place them in the ap-
propriate order.
	
1.	 Draw diagrams for each individual WBS element.
	
2.	 Establish the work breakdown structure and identify the reporting elements and levels.
	
3.	 Create a coarse (arrow-diagram) network and decide on the WBS.
	
4.	 Refine the diagram by combining all logic into one plan. Then decide on the work 
assignments.
	
5.	 If necessary, try to condense the diagram as much as possible without losing clarity.
	
6.	 Integrate diagrams at each level until only one exists. Then begin integration into 
higher WBS levels until the desired plan is achieved.
11–4	 Below are seven factors that must be considered before finalizing a schedule. Explain 
how a base case schedule can change as a result of each of these:
●
●
Introduction or acceptance of the product in the marketplace
●
●
Present or planned manpower availability
●
●
Economic constraints of the project
●
●
Degree of technical difficulty
●
●
Manpower availability
●
●
Availability of personnel training
●
●
Priority of the project

11–6	 “Expecting trouble.” Good project managers know what type of trouble can occur at the 
various stages in the development of a project. The activities in the numbered list below indicate 
the various stages of a project. The lettered list that follows identifies major problems. For each 
project stage, select and list all of those problems that are applicable.

a.	 Engineering does not request 
manufacturing input for end-item 
producibility.
b.	 The work breakdown structure is

c.	 Customer does not fully realize 
the impact that a technical change 
will have upon cost and schedule.
d.	 Time and cost constraints are not 
compatible with the state of the art.
e.	 The project–functional interface 
definition is poor.
f.	 Improper systems integration has 
created conflicts and a communi-
cations breakdown.

not realize that they were respon-
sible for certain risks.
h.	 The impact of design changes is 
not systematically evaluated.
11–7	 Table 11.8 identifies twenty-six steps in project planning and control. Below is a descrip-
tion of each of the twenty-six steps. Using this information, fill in columns 1 and 2 (column 2 is 
a group response). After your instructor provides you with column 3, fill in the remainder of the 
table.
	 1.	 Develop the linear responsibility chart. This chart identifies the work breakdown 
structure and assigns specific authority/responsibility to various individuals as groups 
in order to be sure that all WBS elements are accounted for. The linear responsibility 
chart can be prepared with either the titles or names of individuals. ­Assume that this 

406
Planning 
is prepared after you negotiate for qualified personnel, so that you know either the 
names or capabilities of those individuals who will be assigned.
	 2.	 Negotiate for qualified functional personnel. Once the work is decided on, the pro-
ject manager tries to identify the qualifications for the desired personnel. This then 
becomes the basis for the negotiation process.
	 3.	 Develop specifications. This is one of the four documents needed to initially define 
the requirements of the project. Assume that these are either performance or material 
specifications, and are provided to you at the initial planning stage by either the cus-
tomer or the user.
	 4.	 Determine the means for measuring progress. Before the project plan is finalized 
and project execution can begin, the project manager must identify the means for 
measuring progress; specifically, what is meant by an out-of-tolerance condition and 
what are the tolerances/variances/thresholds for each WBS base case element?
	 5.	 Prepare the final report. This is the final report to be prepared at the termination of 
the project.
	 6.	 Authorize departments to begin work. This step authorizes departments to begin 
the actual execution of the project, not the planning. This step occurs generally 
after the project plan has been established, finalized, and perhaps even approved 
by the customer or user group. This is the initiation of the work orders for project 
implementation.
	 7.	 Develop the work breakdown structure. This is one of the four documents required 
for project definition in the early project planning stage. Assume that WBS is con-
structed using a bottom-up approach. In other words, the WBS is constructed from 
the logic network (arrow diagram) and checkpoints which will eventually become 
the basis for the PERT/CPM charts (see Activity 25).
	 8.	 Close out functional work orders. This is where the project manager tries to prevent 
excessive charging to his project by closing out the functional work orders (i.e., 
Activity 6) as work terminates. This includes canceling all work orders except those 
needed to administer the termination of the project and the preparation of the final 
report.
	 9.	 Develop scope statement and set objectives. This is the statement of work and is one 
of the four documents needed in order to identify the requirements of the project. 
Usually, the WBS is the structuring of the statement of work.
10.	 Develop gross schedule. This is the summary or milestone schedule needed at pro-
ject initiation in order to define the four requirements documents for the project. The 
gross schedule includes start and end dates (if known), other major milestones, and 
data items.
11.	 Develop priorities for each project element. After the base case is identified and 
alternative courses of action are considered (i.e., contingency planning), the project 
team performs a sensitivity analysis for each element of the WBS. This may require 
assigning priorities for each WBS element, and the highest priorities may not neces-
sarily be assigned to elements on the critical path.
12.	 Develop alternative courses of action. Once the base case is known and detailed 
courses of action (i.e., detailed scheduling) are prepared, project managers conduct 
“what if” games to develop possible contingency plans.

13.	 Develop PERT network. This is the finalization of the PERT/CPM network and be-
comes the basis from which detailed scheduling will be performed. The logic for the 
PERT network can be conducted earlier in the planning cycle (see Activity 25), but 
the finalization of the network, together with the time durations, are usually based on 
who has been (or will be) assigned, and the resulting authority/responsibility of the 
individual. In other words, the activity time duration is a function not only of the per-
formance standard, but also of the individual’s expertise and authority/ responsibility.
14.	 Develop detailed schedules. These are the detailed project schedules, and are con-
structed from the PERT/CPM chart and the capabilities of the assigned individuals.
15.	 Establish functional personnel qualifications. Once senior management reviews the 
base case costs and approves the project, the project manager begins the task of 
conversion from rough to detail planning. This includes identification of the required 
resources, and then the respective qualifications.
16.	 Coordinate ongoing activities. These are the ongoing activities for project execution, 
not project planning. These are the activities that were authorized to begin in Activity 6.
17.	 Determine resource requirements. After senior management approves the estimated 
base case costs obtained during rough planning, detailed planning begins by deter-
mining the resource requirements, including human resources.
18.	 Measure progress. As the project team coordinates ongoing activities during project 
execution, the team monitors progress and prepares status reports.
19.	 Decide on a basic course of action. Once the project manager obtains the rough cost 
estimates for each WBS element, the project manager puts together all of the pieces 
and determines the basic course of action.
20.	 Establish costs for each WBS element. After deciding on the base case, the project 
manager establishes the base case cost for each WBS element in order to prepare for 
the senior management pricing review meeting. These costs are usually the same as 
those that were provided by the line managers.
21.	 Review WBS costs with each functional manager. Each functional manager is provid-
ed with the WBS and told to determine his role and price out his functional involve-
ment. The project manager then reviews the WBS costs to make sure that everything 
was accounted for and without duplication of effort.
22.	 Establish a project plan. This is the final step in detail planning. Following this step, 
project execution begins. (Disregard the situation where project plan development 
can be run concurrently with project execution.)
23.	 Establish cost variances for the base case elements. Once the priorities are known 
for each base case element, the project manager establishes the allowable cost vari-
ances that will be used as a means for measuring progress. Cost reporting is mini-
mum as long as the actual costs remain within these allowable variances.
24.	 Price out the WBS. This is where the project manager provides each functional man-
ager with the WBS for initial activity pricing.
25.	 Establish logic network with checkpoints. This is the bottom-up approach that is of-
ten used as the basis for developing both the WBS and later the PERT/CPM network.
26.	 Review base case costs with director. Here the project manager takes the somewhat 
rough costs obtained during the WBS functional pricing and review and seeks man-
agement’s approval to begin detail planning.

12.0 INTRODUCTION
Management is continually seeking new and better control techniques 
to cope with the complexities, masses of data, and tight deadlines 
that are characteristic of highly competitive industries. Managers 
also want better methods for presenting technical and cost data to 
customers.
Scheduling techniques help achieve these goals. The most com-
mon techniques are: 
●	 Gantt or bar charts
●	 Milestone charts
●	 Line of balance1
●	 Networks
●
●
Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT)
●
●
Arrow Diagram Method (ADM) (Sometimes called the Critical Path Method [CPM])2
●
●
Precedence Diagram Method (PDM)

1.  Line of balance is more applicable to manufacturing operations for production line activities. However, it can be used for project 
management activities where a finite number of deliverables must be produced in a given time period. The reader need only refer to 
the multitude of texts on production management for more information on this technique.
2.  The text uses the term CPM instead of ADM. The reader should understand that they are interchangeable.

Network Scheduling Techniques 
Advantages of network scheduling techniques include:
●
●
They form the basis for all planning and predicting and help management decide how to use its 
resources to achieve time and cost goals.
●
●
They provide visibility and enable management to control “one-of-a-kind” ­programs.
●
●
They help management evaluate alternatives by answering such questions as how time delays will 
influence project completion, where slack exists between elements, and what elements are crucial 
to meet the completion date.
●
●
They provide a basis for obtaining facts for decision making.
●
●
They utilize a so-called time network analysis as the basic method to determine manpower, mate-
rial, and capital requirements, as well as to provide a means for checking progress.
●
●
They provide the basic structure for reporting information.
●
●
They reveal interdependencies of activities.
●
●
They facilitate “what if” exercises.
●
●
They identify the longest path or critical paths.
●
●
They aid in scheduling risk analysis.
PERT was originally developed in 1958 and 1959 to meet the needs of the “age of massive engi-
neering.” Since that time, PERT has spread rapidly throughout almost all industries. At about the 
same time, the DuPont Company initiated a similar technique known as the critical path method 
(CPM), which also has spread widely, and is particularly concentrated in the construction and process 
­industries.
In the early 1960s, the basic requirements of PERT/time were as follows:
●
●
All of the individual tasks to complete a program must be clear enough to be put down in a network, 
which comprises events and activities; that is, follow the work breakdown structure.
●
●
Events and activities must be sequenced on the network under a highly logical set of ground rules 
that allow the determination of critical and subcritical paths. Networks may have more than one 
hundred events, but not fewer than ten.
●
●
Time estimates must be made for each activity on a three-way basis. Optimistic, most likely, 
and pessimistic elapsed-time figures are estimated by the person(s) most familiar with the 
activity.
●
●
Critical path and slack times are computed. The critical path is that sequence of activities and 
events whose accomplishment will require the greatest time.
A big advantage of PERT lies in its extensive planning. Network development and critical path analysis 
reveal interdependencies and problems that are not obvious with other planning methods. PERT therefore 
determines where the greatest effort should be made to keep a project on schedule.
The second advantage of PERT is that one can determine the probability of meeting deadlines by devel-
opment of alternative plans. If the decision maker is statistically sophisticated, he can examine the standard 
deviations and the probability of accomplishment data. If there exists a minimum of uncertainty, one may 
use the single-time approach, of course, while retaining the advantage of network analysis.

Network Fundamentals
411
A third advantage is the ability to evaluate the effect of changes in the program. For example, PERT can 
evaluate the effect of a contemplated shift of resources from the less critical activities to the activities identi-
fied as probable bottlenecks. PERT can also evaluate the effect of a deviation in the actual time required for 
an activity from what had been predicted.
Finally, PERT allows a large amount of sophisticated data to be presented in a well-organized diagram 
from which contractors and customers can make joint decisions.
PERT, unfortunately, is not without disadvantages. The complexity of PERT adds to implementa-
tion problems. There exist more data requirements for a PERT-organized reporting system than for most 
others. PERT, therefore, becomes expensive to maintain and is utilized most often on large, complex 
programs.
Many companies have taken a hard look at the usefulness of PERT on small projects. The result has 
been the development of PERT/LOB procedures, which can do the following:
●
●
Cut project costs and time
●
●
Coordinate and expedite planning
●
●
Eliminate idle time
●
●
Provide better scheduling and control of subcontractor activities
●
●
Develop better troubleshooting procedures
●
●
Cut the time required for routine decisions, but allow more time for decision making
Even with these advantages, many companies should ask whether they actually need PERT because 
incorporating it may be difficult and costly, even with canned software packages. Criticism of PERT 
includes:
●
●
Time and labor intensive
●
●
Decision-making ability reduced
●
●
Lacks functional ownership in estimates

12.1 NETWORK FUNDAMENTALS
The major discrepancy with Gantt, milestone, or bubble charts is the 
inability to show the interdependencies between events and activities. 
These interdependencies must be identified so that a master plan can 
be developed that provides an up-to-date picture of operations at all 
times.
Interdependencies are shown through the construction of networks. Network analysis 
can provide valuable information for planning, integration of plans, time studies, scheduling,

and resource management. The primary purpose of network planning is to eliminate the 
need for crisis management by providing a pictorial representation of the total program. 
The following management information can be obtained from such a representation:
●
●
Interdependencies of activities
●
●
Project completion time
●
●
Impact of late starts
●
●
Impact of early starts
●
●
Trade-offs between resources and time
●
●

●
●

●

Networks are composed of events and activities. The following terms are helpful in 
understanding networks:
●
●
Event: Equivalent to a milestone indicating when an activity starts or finishes.
●
●
Activity: The element of work that must be accomplished.
●
●
Duration: The total time required to complete the activity.
●
●
Effort: The amount of work that is actually performed within the duration. For 
example, the duration of an activity could be one month but the effort could be just 
a two-week period within the duration.
●
●
Critical path: This is the longest path through the network and determines the 
duration of the project. It is also the shortest amount of time necessary to accom-
plish the project.
Figure 12–1 shows the standard nomenclature for PERT networks. The circles repre-
sent events, and arrows represent activities. The numbers in the circles signify the specific 
events or accomplishments. The number over the arrow specifies the time needed (hours, 
days, months), to go from event 6 to event 3. The events need not be numbered in any spe-
cific order. However, event 6 must take place before event 3 can be completed (or begun). 
In Figure 12–2A, event 26 must take place prior to events 7, 18, and 31. In Figure 12–2B, 
the opposite holds true, and events 7, 18, and 31 must take place prior to event 26. Figure 
12–2B is similar to “and gates” used in logic diagrams.3
In this chapter’s introduction we have summarized the advantages and disadvantages 
of Gantt and milestone charts. These charts, however, can be used to develop the PERT 
network, as shown in Figure 12–3. The bar chart in Figure 12–3A can be converted to the 
milestone chart in Figure 12–3B. By then defining the relationship between the events on 
different bars in the milestone chart, we can construct the PERT chart in Figure 12–3C.
PERT is basically a management planning and control tool. It can be considered as a 
road map for a particular program or project in which all of the major elements (events)

adapted from logic flow nomenclature.

have been completely identified, together with their corresponding interrelations.4 PERT 
charts are often constructed from back to front because, for many projects, the end date is 
fixed and the contractor has front-end flexibility.
One of the purposes of constructing the PERT chart is to deter-
mine how much time is needed to complete the project. PERT, there-
fore, uses time as a common denominator to analyze those elements 
that directly influence the success of the project, namely, time, cost,

and performance. The construction of the network requires two inputs. First, do events rep-
resent the start or the completion of an activity? Event completions are generally preferred. 
The next step is to define the sequence of events, as shown in Table 12–1, which relates 
each event to its immediate predecessor. Large projects can easily be converted into PERT 
networks once the following questions are answered:
●
●
What job immediately precedes this job?
●
●
What job immediately follows this job?
●
●
What jobs can be run concurrently?
Figure 12–4 shows a typical PERT network. The bold line in Figure 12–4 represents 
the critical path, which is established by the longest time span through the total system of

events. The critical path is composed of events 1–2–3–5–6–7–8–9. The critical path is vital 
for successful control of the project because it tells management two things:
●
●
Because there is no slack time in any of the events on this path, any slippage will 
cause a corresponding slippage in the end date of the program unless this slippage 
can be recovered during any of the downstream events (on the critical path).

Because the events on this path are the most critical for the success of the project, 
management must take a hard look at these events in order to improve the total 
program.
Using PERT we can now identify the earliest possible dates on which we can expect 
an event to occur, or an activity to start or end. There is nothing overly mysterious about 
this type of calculation, but without a network analysis the information might be hard 
to obtain.
PERT charts can be managed from either the events or the activities. For levels 1–3 
of the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), the project manager’s prime concerns are the 
milestones, and therefore, the events are of prime importance. For levels 4–6 of the WBS, 
the project manager’s concerns are the activities.
The principles that we have discussed thus far also apply to CPM. The nomenclature 
is the same and both techniques are often referred to as arrow diagramming methods, or 
activity-on-arrow networks. The differences between PERT and CPM are:
●   PERT uses three time estimates (optimistic, most likely, and pes-
simistic as shown in Section 12.7) to derive an expected time. 
CPM uses one time estimate that represents the normal time (i.e., 
better estimate accuracy with CPM).
●
●
PERT is probabilistic in nature, based on a beta distribution for each activity time 
and a normal distribution for expected time duration (see Section 12.7). This 
allows us to calculate the “risk” in completing a project. CPM is based on a single 
time estimate and is deterministic in nature.
●
●
Both PERT and CPM permit the use of dummy activities in order to develop the 
logic.
●
●
PERT is used for R&D projects where the risks in calculating time durations have 
a high variability. CPM is used for construction projects that are resource depend-
ent and based on accurate time estimates.
●
●
PERT is used on those projects, such as R&D, where percent complete is almost 
impossible to determine except at completed milestones. CPM is used for those 
projects, such as construction, where percent complete can be determined with 
reasonable accuracy and customer billing can be accomplished based on percent 
complete.
12.2 GRAPHICAL EVALUATION AND REVIEW TECHNIQUE (GERT)
Graphical evaluation and review techniques are similar to PERT 
but have the distinct advantages of allowing for looping, branching, 
and multiple project end results. With PERT one cannot easily 
show that if a test fails, we may have to repeat the test several 
times. With PERT, we cannot show that, based upon the results of a test, we can select 
one of several different branches to continue the project. These problems are easily 
overcome using GERT.

12.3 DEPENDENCIES
There are three basic types of interrelationships or dependencies:
●   Mandatory dependencies (i.e., hard logic): These are dependen-
cies that cannot change, such as erecting the walls of a house 
before putting up the roof.
●
●
Discretionary dependencies (i.e., soft logic): These are dependencies that may be 
at the discretion of the project manager or may simply change from project to 
project. As an example, one does not need to complete the entire bill of materials 
prior to beginning procurement.
●
●
External dependencies: These are dependencies that may be beyond the control of 
the project manager such as having contractors sit on your critical path.
Sometimes, it is impossible to draw network dependencies without including dummy 
activities. Dummy activities are artificial activities, represented by a dotted line, and do not con-
sume resources or require time. They are added into the network simply to complete the logic.
In Figure 12–5, activity C is preceded by activity B only. Now, let’s assume that there 
exists an activity D that is preceded by both activities A and B. Without drawing a dummy 
activity (i.e., the dashed line), there is no way to show that activity D is preceded by both 
activities A and B. Using two dummy activities, one from activity A to activity D and 
another one from activity B to activity D, could also accomplish this representation. Soft-
ware programs insert the minimum number of dummy activities, and the direction of the 
arrowhead is important. In Figure 12–5, the arrowhead must be pointed upward.
12.4 SLACK TIME
Since there exists only one path through the network that is the longest, 
the other paths must be either equal in length to or shorter than that path.
Therefore, there must exist events and activities that can be com-
pleted before the time when they are actually needed. The time differ-
ential between the scheduled completion date and the required date to meet critical path is 
referred to as the slack time.5 In Figure 12–4, event 4 is not on the critical path. To go from

5.  There are special situations where the critical path may include some slack. These cases are not considered here.

418
Network Scheduling Techniques 
event 2 to event 5 on the critical path requires seven weeks taking the route 2–3–5. If route 
2–4–5 is taken, only four weeks are required. Therefore, event 4, which requires two weeks 
for completion, should begin anywhere from zero to three weeks after event 2 is complete. 
During these three weeks, management might find another use for the resources of people, 
money, equipment, and facilities required to complete event 4.
The critical path is vital for resource scheduling and allocation because the project 
manager, with coordination from the functional manager, can reschedule those events not 
on the critical path for accomplishment during other time periods when maximum utili-
zation of resources can be achieved, provided that the critical path time is not extended. 
This type of rescheduling through the use of slack times provides for a better balance of 
resources throughout the company, and may possibly reduce project costs by eliminating 
idle or waiting time.
Slack can be defined as the difference between the latest allowable date and the earliest 
expected date based on the nomenclature below:
TE = the earliest time (date) on which an event can be expected to take place
TL = the latest date on which an event can take place without extending the completion 
date of the project
Slack time = TL – TE
The calculation for slack time is performed for each event in the network, as shown in 
Figure 12–6, by identifying the earliest expected date and the latest starting date. For event 
1, TL – TE = 0. Event 1 serves as the reference point for the network and could just as eas-
ily have been defined as a calendar date. As before, the critical path is represented as a bold 
line. The events on the critical path have no slack (i.e., TL = TE) and provide the boundaries 
for the noncritical path events. Since event 2 is critical, TL = TE = 3 + 7 = 10 for event =. 
Event 6 terminates the critical path with a completion time of fifteen weeks.
The earliest time for event 3, which is not on the critical path, would be two weeks 
(TE = 0 + 2 = 2), assuming that it started as early as possible. The latest allowable date is

obtained by subtracting the time required to complete the activity from events 3 to 5 from 
the latest starting date of event 5. Therefore, TL (for event 3) = 10 – 5 = 5 weeks. Event 3 
can now occur anywhere between weeks 2 and 5 without interfering with the scheduled 
completion date of the project. This same procedure can be applied to event 4, in which 
case TE = 6 and TL = 9.
Figure 12–6 contains a simple PERT network, and therefore the calculation of slack 
time is not too difficult. For complex networks containing multiple paths, the earliest start-
ing dates must be found by proceeding from start to finish through the network, while the 
latest allowable starting date must be calculated by working backward from finish to start. 
The importance of knowing exactly where the slack exists cannot be overstated. Proper use 
of slack time permits better technical performance.
Because of these slack times, PERT networks are often not plotted with a time scale. Plan-
ning requirements, however, can require that PERT charts be reconstructed with time scales, 
in which case a decision must be made as to whether we wish early or late time requirements 
for slack variables. This is shown in Figure 12–7 for comparison with total program costs and 
manpower planning. Early time requirements for slack variables are utilized in this figure.

The earliest times and late times can be combined to determine the probability of suc-
cessfully meeting the schedule. A sample of the required information is shown in Table 
12–2. The earliest and latest times are considered as random variables. The original sched-
ule refers to the schedule for event occurrences that were established at the beginning of the 
project. The last column in Table 12–2 gives the probability that the earliest time will not 
be greater than the original schedule time for this event. The exact method for determining 
this probability, as well as the variances, is described in Section 12.5.
In the example shown in Figure 12–6, the earliest and latest times were calculated for 
each event. Some people prefer to calculate the earliest and latest times for each activity 
instead. Also, the earliest and latest times were identified simply as the time or date when

an event can be expected to take place. To make full use of the capabilities of PERT/CPM, 
we could identify four values:
●
●
The earliest time when an activity can start (ES)
●
●
The earliest time when an activity can finish (EF)
●
●
The latest time when an activity can start (LS)
●
●
The latest time when an activity can finish (LF)
Figure 12–8 shows the earliest and latest times identified on the activity.
To calculate the earliest starting times, we must make a forward pass through the net-
work (i.e., left to right). The earliest starting time of a successor activity is the latest of the 
earliest finish dates of the predecessors. The earliest finishing time is the total of the earliest 
starting time and the activity duration.
To calculate the latest times, we must make a backward pass through the network by cal-
culating the latest finish time. Since the activity time is known, the latest starting time can be

calculated by subtracting the activity time from the latest finishing time. The latest finishing 
time for an activity entering a node is the earliest starting time of the activities exiting the node. 
Figure 12–9 shows the earliest and latest starting and finishing times for a typical network.
The identification of slack time can function as an early warning system for the pro-
ject manager. As an example, if the total slack time available begins to decrease from one 
reporting period to the next, that could indicate that work is taking longer than anticipated 
or that more highly skilled labor is needed. A new critical path could be forming.
Looking at the earliest and latest start and finish times can identify slack. In Situation 
a, the slack is easily identified as four work units, where the work units can be expressed in 
hours, days, weeks, or even months. In Situation b, the slack is negative five units of work. 
This is referred to as negative slack or negative float.
What can cause the slack to be negative? Look at Figure 12–10. When performing a 
forward pass through a network, we work from left to right beginning at the customer’s 
starting milestone (position 1). The backward pass, however, begins at the customer’s end 
date milestone (position 2), not (as is often taught) where the forward pass ends. If the for-
ward pass ends at position 3, which is before the customer’s end date, it is possible to have 
slack on the critical path. This slack is often called reserve time and may be added to other 
activities or filled with activities such as report writing so that the forward pass will extend 
to the customer’s completion date.
Negative slack usually occurs when the forward pass extends beyond the customer’s end 
date, as shown by position 4 in the figure. However, the backward pass is still measured from 
the customer’s completion date, thus creating negative slack. This is most likely to result when:
●
●
The original plan was highly optimistic, but unrealistic
●
●
The customer’s end date was unrealistic
●
●
One or more activities slipped during project execution
●
●
The assigned resources did not possess the correct skill levels
●
●
The required resources would not be available until a later date
In any event, negative slack is an early warning indicator that corrective action is 
needed to maintain the customer’s end date.

Network Replanning
423
At this point, it is important to understand the physical meaning of slack. Slack meas-
ures how early or how late an event can start or finish. In Figure 12–6, the circles repre-
sented events and the slack was measured on the events. Most networks today, however, 
focus on the activity rather than the event, as shown in Figure 12–9. When slack is calcu-
lated on the activity, it is usually referred to as float rather than slack, but most project man-
agers use the terms interchangeably. For activity C in Figure 12–9, the float is eight units. 
If the float in an activity is zero, then it is a critical path activity, such as seen in activity F. 
If the slack in an event is zero, then the event is a critical path event.
Another term is maximum float. The equation for maximum float is:
Maximum float = latest finish – earliest start – duration
For activity H in Figure 12–9, the maximum float is six units.
12.5 NETWORK REPLANNING
Once constructed, the PERT/CPM charts provide the framework from 
which detailed planning can be initiated and costs can be controlled 
and tracked. Many iterations, however, are normally made during the 
planning phase before the PERT/CPM chart is finished. Figure 12–11 
shows this iteration process. The slack times form the basis from which additional itera-
tions, or network replanning, can be performed. Network replanning is performed either at 
the conception of the program in order to reduce the length of the critical path, or during 
the program, should the unexpected occur. If all were to go according to schedule, then the 
original PERT/CPM chart would be unchanged for the duration of the project. But, how 
many programs or projects follow an exact schedule from start to finish?
Suppose that activities 1–2 and 1–3 in Figure 12–6 require manpower from the same 
functional unit. Upon inquiry by the project manager, the functional manager asserts that 
he can reduce activity 1–2 by one week if he shifts resources from activity 1–3 to activity 
1–2. Should this happen, however, activity 1–3 will increase in length by one week. Recon-
structing the PERT/CPM network as shown in Figure 12–12, the length of the critical path 
is reduced by one week, and the corresponding slack events are likewise changed.
There are two network replanning techniques based almost entirely upon resources: 
resource leveling and resource allocation.
●
●
Resource leveling is an attempt to eliminate the manpower peaks 
and valleys by smoothing out the period-to-period resource 
requirements. The ideal situation is to do this without changing 
the end date. However, in reality, the end date moves out and 
additional costs are incurred.
●
●
Resource allocation (also called resource-limited planning) is an attempt to find 
the shortest possible critical path based upon the available or fixed resources. The 
problem with this approach is that the employees may not be qualified technically 
to perform on more than one activity in a network.

Resource leveling attempts to minimize the fluctuations in the day-to-day resources 
throughout the life of the project. Leveling efforts tend to elongate the project and drive up 
the cost. However, there are some projects, such as in construction, where resource leveling 
can in fact save money. According to Saleh Mubarak,
Leveling may also be necessary for an expensive piece of equipment such as a crane (which 
may cost money not only in rental expenses but also in mobilization, setup, operation, 
maintenance and demobilization). Say, for example, two activities require a tower crane 
at the same time. If you can delay the start of one activity (the more critical) until the 
other (the less critical) has finished, you will re-assign the tower crane, or any other major 
resource, to the other activity. By doing this, you will have reduced the maximum demand 
of tower cranes at any time to only one, which will save expenses.6
Some resources may be shared among projects. The question is which resources and 
how much should be shared. For small projects in a relative close vicinity, for example, 
some staff (project manager, safety manager, quality manager, secretary, etc.) and equip-
ment can be shared. A project manager must make decisions when the situation looks like 
a borderline case. For instance, whether it would be more efficient to have someone travel 
between two jobs versus hiring another person, even though that person would not be fully 
occupied of the time. The same argument holds for equipment. In general, convenience and 
simple economics are mostly the driving criteria in making such decisions. However, other 
issues may be considered, such as short- and long-term need; future market expectations; 
staff morale, fatigue and satisfaction; relationships with stakeholders; the possibly of a need 
suddenly occurring, and so forth. Keep in mind that transferring resources from one project 
to another permanently is frequently normally done, and it is not considered sharing.
Staff members who do not have to be present at the job site every day can be spread out, 
either by dividing their day between two or more jobs or by assigning certain entire days 
to different jobs. Certain high-paid staff, such as safety officers, schedulers and project 
control managers, who need to spend only one day every week or every two weeks at the 
job site, may even fly hundreds of miles between jobs. With the advancement of telecom-
munications tools (phones, Internet, video-conferencing, etc.) many functions can now be 
performed from a remote location.7
Unfortunately, not all PERT/CPM networks permit such easy rescheduling of 
resources. Project managers should make every attempt to reallocate resources to reduce 
the critical path, provided that the slack was not intentionally planned as a safety valve.
Transferring resources from slack paths to more critical paths is only one method for 
reducing expected project time. Several other methods are available:
●
●
Elimination of some parts of the project
●
●

Under the ideal situation, the project start and end dates are fixed, and performance 
within this time scale must be completed within the guidelines described by the statement 
of work. Should the scope of effort have to be reduced in order to meet other requirements, 
the contractor incurs a serious risk that the project may be canceled, or meeting performance 
expectations may no longer be possible.
Adding resources is not always possible. If the activities requiring these added 
resources also call for certain expertise, then the contractor may not have qualified or expe-
rienced employees, and may avoid the risk. The contractor might still reject this idea, even 
if time and money were available for training new employees, because on project termina-
tion he might not have any other projects for these additional people. However, if the pro-
ject is the construction of a new facility, then the labor-union pool may be able to provide 
additional experienced manpower.
Parallelization of activities can be regarded as accepting a risk by assuming that a 
certain event can begin in parallel with a second event that would normally be in sequence 
with it. This is shown in Figure 12–13. One of the biggest headaches at the beginning of

any project is the purchasing of tooling and raw materials. As shown in Figure 12–13, four 
weeks can be saved by sending out purchase orders after contract negotiations are com-
pleted, but before the one-month waiting period necessary to sign the contract. Here the 
contractor incurs a risk. Should the effort be canceled or the statement of work change prior 
to the signing of the contract, the customer incurs the cost of the termination expenses from 
the vendors. This risk is normally overcome by the issuance of a long-lead procurement 
letter immediately following contract negotiations.
There are two other types of risk that are common. In the first situation, engineering 
has not yet finished the prototype, and manufacturing must order the tooling in order to 
keep the end date fixed. In this case, engineering may finally design the prototype to fit the 
tooling. In the second situation, the subcontractor finds it difficult to perform according to 
the original blueprints. In order to save time, the customer may allow the contractor to work 
without blueprints, and the blueprints are then changed to represent the as-built end-item.
Because of the complexities of large programs, network replanning becomes an 
almost impossible task when analyzed on total program activities. It is often better to have 
each department or division develop its own PERT/CPM networks, on approval by the 
project office, and based on the work breakdown structure. The individual PERT charts 
are then integrated into one master chart to identify total program critical paths, as shown 
in Figure 12–14.
Segmented PERT charts can also be used when a number of con-
tractors work on the same program. Each contractor (or subcontrac-
tor) develops his own PERT chart. It then becomes the responsibility

total program requirements can be met.
12.6 ESTIMATING ACTIVITY TIME
Determining the elapsed time between events requires that responsi-
ble functional managers evaluate the situation and submit their best 
estimates.
The calculations for critical paths and slack times in the previous 
sections were based on these best estimates.
In this ideal situation, the functional manager would have at his disposal a large vol-
ume of historical data from which to make his estimates. Obviously, the more historical 
data available, the more reliable the estimate. Many programs, however, include events 
and activities that are nonrepetitive. In this case, the functional managers must submit their 
estimates using three possible completion assumptions:
●
●
Optimistic completion time: This time assumes that everything 
will go according to plan and with minimal difficulties. This 
should occur approximately 1 percent of the time.
●
●
Pessimistic completion time: This time assumes that everything will not go accord-
ing to plan and maximum difficulties will develop. This should also occur approxi-
mately 1 percent of the time.
●
●
Most likely completion time: This is the time that, in the mind of the functional man-
ager, would most often occur should this effort be reported over and over again.8
Before these three times can be combined into a single expression for expected time, 
two assumptions must be made. The first assumption is that the standard deviation, s, is 
one-sixth of the time requirement range. This assumption stems from probability theory, 
where the end points of a curve are three standard deviations from the mean. The second 
assumption requires that the probability distribution of time required for an activity be 
expressible as a beta distribution.
The expected time between events can be found from the ­expression:
t

e =

Where
te = expected time
a = most optimistic time
b = most pessimistic time
m = most likely time.

are exceptions where the program or project office would do their own estimating.

Estimating Total Project Time

As an example, if a = 3, b = 7, and m = 5 weeks, then the expected time, te, would be 
5 weeks. This value for te would then be used as the activity time between two events in 
the construction of a PERT chart. This method for obtaining best estimates contains a large 
degree of uncertainty. If we change the variable times to a = 2, b = 12, and m = 4 weeks, 
then te will still be 5 weeks. The latter case, however, has a much higher degree of uncer-
tainty because of the wider spread between the optimistic and pessimistic times. Care must 
be taken in the evaluation of risks in the expected times.
12.7 ESTIMATING TOTAL PROJECT TIME
In order to calculate the probability of completing the project on 
time, the standard deviations of each activity must be known. This 
can be found from the expression:
σte
b
a
=
−
6
where σte is the standard deviation of the expected time, te. Another useful expression is the 
variance, υ, which is the square of the standard deviation. The variance is primarily useful 
for comparison to the expected values. However, the standard deviation can be used just 
as easily, except that we must identify whether it is a one, two, or three sigma limit devia-
tion. Figure 12–15 shows the critical path of Figure 12–6, together with the corresponding 
values from which the expected times were calculated, as well as the standard deviations. 
The total path standard deviation is calculated by the square root of the sum of the squares 
of the activity standard deviations using the following expression:

that there is a 68 percent chance of completing the project within one standard deviation, a 
95 percent chance within two standard deviations, and a 99.73 percent chance within three 
standard deviations.
This type of analysis can be used to measure the risks in the estimates, the risks in 
completing each activity, and the risks in completing the entire project. In other words, the 
standard deviation, σ, serves as a measurement of the risk. This analysis, however, assumes 
that normal distribution applies, which is not always the case.
As an example of measuring risk, consider a network that has only three activities on 
the critical path as shown below (all times in weeks):

From the above table, the length of the critical path is 15 weeks. Since the variance 
(i.e., σ2) is 1.0, then σpath, which is the square root of the variance, must be 1 week.
We can now calculate the probability of completing the project within certain time 
limits:
●
●
The probability of getting the job done within 16 weeks is 50% + (1/2) × (68%), 
or 84%.
●
●
Within 17 weeks, we have 50% + (1/2) × (95%), or 97.5%.
●
●
Within 14 weeks, we have 50% – (1/2) × (68%), or 16%.
●
●
Within 13 weeks, we have 50% – (1/2) × (95%), or 2.5%.
12.8 TOTAL PERT/CPM PLANNING
Before we continue, it is necessary to discuss the methodology for preparing PERT sched-
ules. PERT scheduling is a six-step process. Steps one and two begin with the project man-
ager laying out a list of activities to be performed and then placing these activities in order 
of precedence, thus identifying the interrelationships. These charts drawn by the project 
manager are called either logic charts, arrow diagrams, work flow, or simply networks. The 
arrow diagrams will look like Figure 12–6 with two exceptions: The activity time is not 
identified, and neither is the critical path.
Step three is reviewing the arrow diagrams with the line managers (i.e., the true 
experts) in order to obtain their assurance that neither too many nor too few activities are 
identified, and that the interrelationships are correct.
In step four the functional manager converts the arrow diagram to a PERT chart by 
identifying the time duration for each activity. It should be noted here that the time estimates 

Total PERT/CPM Planning
431
that the line managers provide are based on the assumption of unlimited resources because 
the calendar dates have not yet been defined.
Step five is the first iteration on the critical path. It is here that the project manager 
looks at the critical calendar dates in the definition of the project’s requirements. If the 
critical path does not satisfy the calendar requirements, then the project manager must try 
to shorten the critical path using methods explained in Section 12.3 or by asking the line 
managers to take the “fat” out of their estimates.
Step six is often the most overlooked step. Here the project manager places calendar 
dates on each event in the PERT chart, thus converting from planning under unlimited 
resources to planning with limited resources. Even though the line manager has given you 
a time estimate, there is no guarantee that the correct resources will be available when 
needed. That is why this step is crucial. If the line manager cannot commit to the calen-
dar dates, then replanning will be necessary. Most companies that survive on competitive 
bidding lay out proposal schedules based on unlimited resources. After contract award, 
the schedules are analyzed again because the company now has limited resources. After 
all, how can a company bid on three contracts simultaneously and put a detailed schedule 
into each proposal if it is not sure how many contracts, if any, it will win? For this reason 
customers require that formal project plans and schedules be provided thirty to ninety days 
after contract award.
Finally, PERT replanning should be an ongoing function during project execution. 
The best project managers continually try to assess what can go wrong and perform 
perturbation analysis on the schedule. (This should be obvious because the constraints 
and objectives of the project can change during execution.) Primary objectives on a 
schedule are:
●
●
Best time
●
●
Least cost
●
●
Least risk
Secondary objectives include:
●
●
Studying alternatives
●
●
Optimum schedules
●
●
Effective use of resources
●
●
Communications
●
●
Refinement of the estimating process
●
●
Ease of project control
●
●
Ease of time or cost revisions
Obviously, these objectives are limited by such constraints as:
●
●
Calendar completion
●
●
Cash or cash flow restrictions
●
●
Limited resources
●
●
Management approvals

12.9 CRASH TIMES
In the preceding sections, no distinction was made between PERT and 
CPM. The basic difference between PERT and CPM lies in the ability 
to calculate percent complete. PERT is used in R&D or just devel-
opment activities, where a percent-complete determination is almost impossible. Therefore, 
PERT is event oriented rather than activity oriented. In PERT, funding is normally provided 
for each milestone (i.e., event) achieved because incremental funding along the activity line 
has to be based on percent complete. CPM, on the other hand, is activity oriented because, 
in activities such as construction, percent complete along the activity line can be determined. 
CPM can be used as an arrow diagram network without PERT. The difference between the 
two methods lies in the environments in which they evolved and how they are applied.
The CPM (activity-type network) has been widely used in the process industries, in 
construction, and in single-project industrial activities. Common problems include no place 
to store early arrivals of raw materials and project delays for late arrivals.
Using strictly the CPM approach, project managers can consider the cost of speeding 
up, or crashing, certain phases of a project. In order to accomplish this, it is necessary to 
calculate a crashing cost per unit time as well as the normal expected time for each activity. 
CPM charts, which are closely related to PERT charts, allow visual representation of the 
effects of crashing. There are these requirements:
●
●
For a CPM chart, the emphasis is on activities, not events. Therefore, the PERT chart 
should be redrawn with each circle representing an activity rather than an event.
●
●
In CPM, both time and cost of each activity are considered.9
●
●
Only those activities on the critical path are considered, starting with the activities 
for which the crashing cost per unit time is the lowest.
Figure 12–16 shows a CPM network with the corresponding crash time for all activi-
ties on and off the critical path. The activities are represented by circles and include an 
activity identification number and the estimated time. The costs expressed in the figure are 
usually direct costs only.
To determine crashing costs we begin with the lowest weekly crashing cost, activity A, 
at $2,000 per week. Although activity C has a lower crashing cost, it is not on the critical 
path. Only critical path activities are considered for crashing. Activity A will be the first 
to be crashed for a maximum of two weeks at $2,000 per week. The next activity to be 
considered would be F at $3,000 per week for a maximum of three weeks. These crashing 
costs are additional expenses above the normal estimates.
A word of caution concerning the selection and order of the activities that are to crash: 
There is a good possibility that as each activity is crashed, a new critical path will be devel-
oped. This new path may or may not include those elements that were bypassed because 
they were not on the original critical path.
Returning to Figure 12–16 (and assuming that no new critical paths are developed), 
activities A, F, E, and B would be crashed in that order. The crashing cost would then be an 
9.  Although PERT considers mainly time, modifications through PERT/cost analysis can be made to consider 
the cost factors.

increase of $37,500 from the base of $120,000 to $157,500. The corresponding time would 
then be reduced from twenty-three weeks to fifteen weeks. This is shown in Figure 12–17 
to illustrate how a trade-off between time and cost can be obtained. Also shown in Figure 
12–17 is the increased cost of crashing elements not on the critical path. Crashing these 
elements would result in a cost increase of $7,500 without reducing the total project time. 
There is also the possibility that this figure will represent unrealistic conditions because 
sufficient resources are not or cannot be made available for the crashing period.
The purpose behind balancing time and cost is to avoid wasting resources. If the direct 
and indirect costs can be accurately obtained, then a region of feasible budgets can be 
found, bounded by the early start (crash) and late-start (or normal) activities. This is shown 
in Figure 12–18.
Since the direct and indirect costs are not necessarily expressible as linear functions, 
time–cost trade-off relationships are made by searching for the lowest possible total cost 
(i.e., direct and indirect) that likewise satisfies the region of feasible budgets. This method 
is shown in Figure 12–19.
Like PERT, CPM also contains the concept of slack time, the maximum amount of 
time that a job may be delayed beyond its early start without delaying the project comple-
tion time. Figure 12–20 shows a typical representation of slack time using a CPM chart. 
In addition, the figure shows how target activity costs can be identified. Figure 12–20 can 
be modified to include normal and crash times as well as normal and crash costs. In this 
case, the cost box in the figure would contain two numbers: The first number would be the 
normal cost, and the second would be the crash cost. These numbers might also appear as 
running totals.

12.10 PERT/CPM PROBLEM AREAS
PERT/CPM models are not without their disadvantages and problems. Even the largest 
organizations with years of experience in using PERT and CPM have the same ongoing 
problems as newer or smaller companies.
Many companies have a difficult time incorporating PERT systems because PERT 
is end-item oriented. Many upper-level managers feel that the adoption of PERT/CPM 
removes a good part of their power and ability to make decisions. This is particularly 
evident in companies that have been forced to accept PERT/CPM as part of contractual 
requirements.
In PERT systems, there are planners and doers. In most organizations PERT planning 
is performed by the program office and functional management. Yet once the network is 
constructed, the planners and managers become observers and rely on the doers to accom-
plish the job within time and cost limitations. Management must convince the doers that 
they have an obligation to the successful completion of the established PERT/CPM plans.
PERT networks are based on the assumption that all activities start as soon as possi-
ble. This assumes that qualified personnel and equipment are available. Regardless of how 
well we plan, there are almost always differences in performance times from what would 
normally be acceptable. For the selected model, time and cost should be well-considered 
estimates, not spur-of-the-moment decisions.
Cost control problems arise when the project cost and control system is not com-
patible with company policies. Project-oriented costs may be meshed with non-PERT-
controlled jobs in order to develop the annual budget. This becomes a difficult chore for 
cost reporting, especially when each project may have its own method for analyzing and 
controlling costs.
12.11 ALTERNATIVE PERT/CPM MODELS
Because of the many advantages of PERT/time, numerous industries have found applica-
tions for this form of network. A partial list of these advantages includes capabilities for:
●
●
Trade-off studies for resource control
●
●
Providing contingency planning in the early stages of the project
●
●
Visually tracking up-to-date performance
●
●
Demonstrating integrated planning
●
●
Providing visibility down through the lowest levels of the work breakdown structure
●
●
Providing a regimented structure for control purposes to ensure compliance with 
the work breakdown structure and the statement of work
●
●
Increasing functional members’ ability to relate to the total program, thus provid-
ing participants with a sense of belonging
Even with these advantages, in many situations PERT/time has proved ineffective in 
controlling resources within the parameters of time, cost, and performance. With these 

Precedence Networks
437
factors in mind, companies began reconstructing PERT/time into PERT/cost and PERT/
performance models.
PERT/cost is an extension of PERT/time and attempts to overcome the problems asso-
ciated with the use of the most optimistic and most pessimistic time for estimating comple-
tion. PERT/cost can be regarded as a cost accounting network model based on the work 
breakdown structure and capable of being subdivided down to the lowest elements, or work 
packages. The advantages of PERT/cost are that it:
●
●
Contains all the features of PERT/time
●
●
Permits cost control at any WBS level
The primary reason for the development of PERT/cost was so that project managers 
could identify critical schedule slippages and cost overruns in time to correct them.
12.12 PRECEDENCE NETWORKS
Project management can provide answers to such questions as:
●
●
How will the project be affected by limited resources?
●
●
How will the project be affected by a change in the requirements?
●
●
What is the cash flow for the project (and for each WBS element)?
●
●
What is the impact of overtime?
●
●
What additional resources are needed to meet the constraints of the project?
●
●
How will a change in the priority of a certain WBS element affect the total project?
The more sophisticated packages can provide answers to schedule and cost based on:
●
●
Adverse weather conditions
●
●
Weekend activities
●
●
Unleveled manpower requirements
●
●
Variable crew size
●
●
Splitting of activities
●
●
Assignment of unused resources
Regardless of the sophistication of computer systems, printers 
and plotters prefer to draw straight lines rather than circles. Most 
software systems today use precedence networks, as shown in 
­Figure 12–21, which attempt to show interrelationships on bar charts. 
In Figure 12–21, task 1 and task 2 are related because of the solid line between them. Task 
3 and task 4 can begin when task 2 is half finished. (This cannot be shown easily on PERT 
without splitting activities.) The dotted lines indicate slack. The critical path can be identi-
fied by putting an asterisk (*) beside the critical elements, or by putting the critical connec-
tions in a different color or boldface.

The more sophisticated software packages display precedence networks in the format 
shown in. In each of these figures, work is accomplished during the activity. This is some-
times referred to as the activity-on-node method. The arrow represents the relationship or 
constraint between activities.
Figure 12–22A illustrates a finish-to-start constraint. In this figure, activity 2 can start 
no earlier than the completion of activity 1. All PERT charts are finish-to-start constraints. 
Figure 12–23B illustrates a start-to-start constraint. Activity 2 cannot start prior to the start 
of activity 1. Figure 12–22C illustrates a finish-to-finish constraint. In this figure, activity 2 
cannot finish until activity 1 finishes. Figure 12–22D illustrates a start-to-finish constraint.
An example might be that you must start studying for an exam some time prior to the 
completion of the exam. This is the least common type of precedence chart. Figure 12–22E 
illustrates a percent complete constraint. In this figure, the last 20 percent of activity 2 can-
not be started until 50 percent of activity 1 has been completed.10
Figure 12–23 shows the typical information that appears in each 
of the activity boxes shown in Figure 12–22. The box identified as 
“responsibility cost center” could also have been identified as the 
name, initials, or badge number of the person responsible for this 
activity.

12.13 LAG
The time period between the early start or finish of one activity and 
the early start or finish of another activity in the sequential chain is 
called lag. Lag is most commonly used in conjunction with prec-
edence networks. Figure 12–24 shows five different ways to identify 
lag on the constraints.

The Myths of Schedule Compression
441
Slack is measured within activities, whereas lag is measured between activities. As an 
example, look at Figure 12–24A. Suppose that activity A ends at the end of the first week 
of March. Since it is a finish-to-start precedence chart, one would expect the start of activity 
B to be the beginning of the second week in March. But if activity B cannot start until the 
beginning of the third week of March, that would indicate a week of lag between activity A 
and activity B even though both activities can have slack within the activity. The lag may 
be the result of resource constraints.
Another common term is lead. Again looking at Figure 12–24A, suppose that activity 
A actually finishes on March 15 but the precedence chart shows activity B is scheduled to 
start on March 8, seven days prior to the completion of activity A. In this case, L 527, a neg-
ative value, indicating that the start of activity B leads the completion of activity A by seven 
days. To illustrate how this can happen, consider the following example: The line manager 
responsible for activity B promised you that his resources would be available on March 
16, the day after activity A was scheduled to end. The line manager then informs you that 
these resources will be available on March 8, and if you do not pick them up on your charge 
number at that time, they may be assigned elsewhere and not be available on the 16th. Most 
project managers would take the resources on the 8th and find some work for them to do 
even though logic says that the work cannot begin until after activity A has finished.
12.14 SCHEDULING PROBLEMS
Every scheduling technique has advantages and disadvantages. Some scheduling problems 
are the result of organizational indecisiveness, such as having a project sponsor that refuses 
to provide the project manager guidance on whether the schedule should be based upon a 
least time, least cost, or least risk scheduling objective. As a result, precious time is wasted 
in having to redo the schedules.
However, there are some scheduling problems that can impact all scheduling tech-
niques. These include:
●
●
Using unrealistic estimates for effort and duration
●
●
Inability to handle employee workload imbalances
●
●
Having to share critical resources across several projects
●
●
Overcommitted resources
●
●
Continuous readjustments to the WBS primarily from scope changes
●
●
Unforeseen bottlenecks
12.15 THE MYTHS OF SCHEDULE COMPRESSION
Simply because schedule compression techniques may exist does not mean that they will 
work. There is a tendency for managers to be aggressively positive in their thinking at the 
onset of a project, believing that compression techniques can be applied effectively.

442
Network Scheduling Techniques 
There are five common techniques for schedule compression, and each technique has 
significant limitations that may make this technique more of a myth than reality. This is 
shown in Table 12–3.
12.16 PROJECT MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE
While it is clear that even the most sophisticated software package 
is not a substitute for competent project leadership—and by itself 
does not identify or correct any task-related problems—it can be 
a terrific aid to the project manager in tracking the many interre-
lated variables and tasks that come into play with a project. Specific examples of these 
capabilities are:
●
●
Project data summary: expenditure, timing, and activity
●
●
Project management and business graphics capabilities
●
●
Data management and reporting capabilities
●
●
Critical path analysis
●
●
Customized and standard reporting formats
●
●
Multiproject tracking
●
●
Subnetworking
●
●
Impact analysis (what if . . .)
●
●
Early warning systems
●
●
On-line analysis of recovering alternatives
●
●
Graphical presentation of cost, time, and activity data
●
●
Resource planning and analysis
Table 12–3.  Myths and Realities of Schedule Compression
Compression Technique
Myth
Reality
Use of overtime
Work will progress at the 
same rate on overtime.
The rate of progress is less on overtime; 
more mistakes may occur; and prolonged 
overtime may lead to burnout.
Adding more resources (i.e., 
crashing)
The performance rate will 
increase due to the added 
resources.
It takes time to find the resources; it takes time 
to get them up to speed; the resources used 
for the training must come from the existing 
resources.
Reducing scope (i.e., needed, 
reducing functionality)
The customer always 
requests more work than 
actually needed.
The customer needs all of the tasks agreed to 
in the statement of work.
Outsourcing
Numerous qualified 
suppliers exist.
The quality of the suppliers’ work can damage 
your reputation; the supplier may go out of 
business; and the supplier may have limited 
concern for your scheduled dates.
Doing series work in parallel
An activity can start before 
the previous activity has 
finished.
The risks increase and rework becomes 
expensive because it may involve multiple 
activities.

6.3.2.4 Project Management 
Information System 

Project management software capabilities and features vary a great 
deal. However, the variation is more in the depth and sophistication of 
the features, such as storage, display, analysis, interoperability, and user friendliness, rather 
than in the type of features offered, which are very similar for most software programs. 
Most packages offer the following features:
1.	 Planning, tracking, and monitoring. These features provide for planning and tracking 
the projects’ tasks, resources, and costs. The data format for describing the project to 
the computer is usually based on standard network typologies such as the CPM, PERT, 
or Precedence Diagram Method (PDM). Task elements, with their estimated start and 
finish times, their assigned resources, and actual cost data, can be entered and updated 
as the project progresses. The software provides an analysis of the data and documents 
the technical and financial status of the project against its schedule and original plan. 
Usually, the software also provides impact assessments of plan deviations and resource 
and schedule projections. Many systems also provide resource leveling, a feature that 
averages out available resources to determine task duration and generates a leveled 
schedule for comparison.
2.	 Reports. Project reporting is usually achieved via a menu-driven report writer system 
that allows the user to request several standard reports in a standard format. The user 
can also modify these reports or create new ones. Reporting capabilities include:
●
●
Budgeted cost for work scheduled (BCWS) or planned value of 
work (PV)
●
●
Budgeted cost for work performed (BCWP) or earned value of 
work (EV)
●
●
Actual versus planned expenditure
●
●
Earned value analysis
●
●
Cost and schedule performance indices
●
●
Cash-flow
●
●
Critical path analysis
●
●
Change order
●
●
Standard government reports (DoD, DoE, NASA), formatted for the performance 
monitoring system (PMS)
In addition, many software packages feature a user-oriented, free-format report writer 
for styled project reporting.
3.	 Project calendar. This feature allows the user to establish work weeks based on actual 
workdays. Hence, the user can specify nonwork periods such as weekends, holidays, 
and vacations. It is available in detail or in a summary format and is automatically the 
basis for all resource scheduling.

4.	 What-if analysis. Some software is designed to make what-if analyses easy. A sepa-
rate, duplicate project database is established and the desired changes are entered. A 
comparative analysis is performed and displays the new against the old project plan in 
tabular or graphical form for fast and easy management review and analysis.
5.	 Multiproject analysis. Some of the more sophisticated packages feature a single, com-
prehensive database that facilitates cross-project analysis and reporting. Cost and 
schedule modules share common files that allow integration among projects and mini-
mize problems of data inconsistencies and redundancies.

6.6.2.1 Control Schedule Tools and 
Techniques 
Reporting
In Chapter 11, we defined the steps involved in establishing a formal 
program plan with detailed schedules to manage the total program. 
Any plan, schedule, drawing, or specification that will be read by 
more than one person must be expressed in a language understood 
by all recipients.
The ideal situation is to construct charts and schedules in suit-
able Bar Charts notation that can be used for both in-house control 
and out-of-house customer status reporting. Unfortunately, this is 
easier said than done.
All schedules and charts should consider time, cost, and perfor-
mance and their relationship to corporate resources.
Information to ensure proper project evaluation is usually obtained through four 
methods:
●
●
Firsthand observation
●
●
Oral and written reports
●
●
Review and technical interchange meetings
●
●
Graphical displays
Firsthand observations are an excellent tool for obtaining unfiltered information, but 
they may not be possible on large projects. Although oral and written reports are a way of 
life, they often contain either too much or not enough detail, and significant information 
may be disguised. Review and technical interchange meetings provide face-to-face com-
munications and can result in immediate agreement on problem definitions or solutions, 
such as changing a schedule. The difficulty is in the selection of attendees from the cus-
tomer’s and the contractor’s organizations. Good graphical displays make the information 
easy to identify and are the prime means for tracking cost, schedule, and performance. 
Proper graphical displays can result in:
●
●
Cutting project costs and reducing the time scale
●
●
Coordinating and expediting planning
●
●
Eliminating idle time
●
●
Obtaining better scheduling and control of subcontractor activities
●
●
Developing better troubleshooting procedures
●
●
Cutting time for routine decisions, but allowing more time for decision making

Some executives prefer to micromanage projects, whereas other executives 
are fearful of making a decision because, if they were to make the wrong 
decision, it could impact their career. In this case study, the president of the company assigned 
one of the vice presidents to act as the project sponsor on a project designed to build tooling for 
a client. The sponsor, however, was reluctant to make any decisions.
Moreland Company was well-respected as a tooling design-and-build 
company. Moreland was project-driven because all of its income came 
from projects. Moreland was also reasonably mature in project management. When the previ-
ous VP for engineering retired, Moreland hired an executive from a manufacturing company 
to replace him. The new VP for engineering, Al Zink, had excellent engineering knowledge 
about tooling but had worked for companies that were not project-driven. Al had very little 
knowledge about project management and had never functioned as a project sponsor. Because 
of Al’s lack of experience as a sponsor, the president decided that Al should “get his feet wet” 
as quickly as possible and assigned him as the project sponsor on a medium-sized project. 
The project manager on this project was Fred Cutler. Fred was an engineer with more than 
twenty years of experience in tooling design and manufacturing. Fred reported directly to Al 
Zink administratively.
Fred’s Dilemma: Fred understood the situation; he would have to train Al Zink on how to 
function as a project sponsor. This was a new experience for Fred because subordinates usually 
do not train senior personnel on how to do their job. Would Al Zink be receptive? Fred explained 
the role of the sponsor and how there are certain project documents that require the signatures 
of both the project manager and the project sponsor. Everything seemed to be going well until 
Fred informed Al that the project sponsor is the person that the president eventually holds ac-
countable for the success or failure of the project. Fred could tell that Al was quite upset over 
this statement.
Al realized that the failure of a project where he was the sponsor could damage his reputa-
tion and career. Al was now uncomfortable about having to act as a sponsor but knew that he 
might eventually be assigned as a sponsor on other projects. Al also knew that this project was 
somewhat of a high risk. If Al could function as an invisible sponsor, he could avoid making 
any critical decisions.
In the first meeting between Fred and Al where Al was the sponsor, Al asked Fred for a 
copy of the schedule for the project. Fred responded:
I’m working on the schedule right now. I cannot finish the schedule until you tell me 
whether you want me to lay out the schedule based upon best time, least cost, or least risk.
Al stated that he would think about it and get back to Fred as soon as possible.
During the middle of the next week, Fred and Al met in the company’s cafeteria. Al asked 
Fred again, “How is the schedule coming along?” and Fred responded as before:
I cannot finish the schedule until you tell me whether you want me to lay out the schedule 
based upon best time, least cost, or least risk.

Al was furious, turned around, and walked away from Fred. Fred was now getting nervous 
about how upset Al was and began worrying if Al might remove him as the project manager. But 
Fred decided to hold his ground and get Al to make a decision.
At the weekly sponsor meeting between Fred and Al, once again Al asked the same ques-
tion, and once again Fred gave the same response as before. Al now became quite angry and 
yelled out:
Just give me a least time schedule.
Fred had gotten Al to make his first decision. Fred finalized his schedule and had it on Al’s 
desk two days later awaiting Al’s signature. Once again, Al procrastinated and refused to sign 
off on the schedule. Al believed that, if he delayed making the decision, Fred would take the 
initiative and begin working on the schedule without Al’s signature.
Fred kept sending emails to Al asking when he intended to sign off on the schedule or, if 
something was not correct, what changes needed to be made. As expected, Al did not respond. 
Fred then decided that he had to pressure Al one way or another into making timely decisions 
as the project sponsor. Fred then sent an email to Al that stated:
I sent you the project schedule last week. If the schedule is not signed by this Friday, there 
could be an impact on the end date of the project. If I do not hear from you, one way or 
another, by this Friday, I will assume you approve the schedule and I can begin implemen-
tation.
The president’s email address was also included in the CC location on the email. The next 
morning, Fred found the schedule on his desk, signed by Al Zink.
QUESTIONS
1.	 Why do some executives refuse to function as project sponsors?
2.	 Can an executive be “forced” to function as a sponsor?
3.	 Is it right for the sponsor to be the ultimate person responsible for the success or failure of 
the project?
4.	 Were Al Zink’s actions that of someone trying to be an invisible sponsor?
5.	 Did Fred Cutler act appropriately in trying to get Al Zink to act as a sponsor?
6.	 What is your best guess as to what happened to the working relationship between Al Zink 
and Fred Cutler?

Pricing and Estimating
13.0 INTRODUCTION
With the complexities involved, it is not surprising that many business 
managers consider pricing an art. Having information on customer 
cost budgets and competitive pricing would certainly help.
However, the reality is that whatever information is available to 
one bidder is generally available to the others. A disciplined approach helps in developing all the input for 
a rational pricing recommendation. A side benefit of using a disciplined management process is that it leads 
to the documentation of the many factors and assumptions involved at a later time. These can be compared 
and analyzed, contributing to the learning experiences that make up the managerial skills needed for effec-
tive business decisions. Estimates are not blind luck. They are well-thought-out decisions based on either 
the best available information, some type of cost estimating relationship, or some type of cost model. Cost 
estimating relationships (CERs) are generally the output of cost models. Typical CERs might be:
●
●Mathematical equations based on regression analysis
●
●Cost–quantity relationships such as learning curves
●
●Cost–cost relationships
●
●Cost–noncost relationships based on physical characteristics, technical parameters, or performance 
characteristics
13.1 GLOBAL PRICING STRATEGIES
Specific pricing strategies must be developed for each individual situation. Frequently, 
however, one of two situations prevails when one is pursuing project acquisitions competi-
tively. First, the new business opportunity may be a one-of-a-kind project with little or no

follow-on potential, a situation classified as type I acquisition. Second, the new business 
opportunity may be an entry point to a larger follow-on or repeat business, or may represent 
a planned penetration into a new market. This acquisition is classified as type II.
Clearly, in each case, we have specific but different business objectives. The objec-
tive for type I acquisition is to win the project and execute it profitably and satisfactorily 
according to contractual agreements. The type II objective is often to win the project and 
perform well, thereby gaining a foothold in a new market segment or a new customer com-
munity in place of making a profit. Accordingly, each acquisition type has its own, unique 
pricing strategy, as summarized in Table 13–1.
Comparing the two pricing strategies for the two global situations (as shown in  
Table 13–1) reveals a great deal of similarity for the first five points. The fundamental dif-
ference is that for a profitable new business acquisition the bid price is determined accord-
ing to actual cost, whereas in a “must-win” situation the price is determined by the market 
forces. It should be emphasized that one of the most crucial inputs in the pricing decision 
is the cost estimate of the proposed baseline. The design of this baseline to the minimum 
requirements should be started early, in accordance with well-defined ground rules, cost 
models, and established cost targets. Too often the baseline design is performed in parallel

cost credibility.

with the proposal development. At the proposal stage it is too late to review and fine-tune 
the baseline for minimum cost. Also, such a late start does not allow much of an option for 
a final bid decision. Even if the price appears outside the competitive range, it makes little 
sense to terminate the proposal development. As all the resources have been sent anyway, 
one might just as well submit a bid in spite of the remote chance of winning.
Clearly, effective pricing begins a long time before proposal development. It starts 
with preliminary customer requirements, well-understood subtasks, and a top-down esti-
mate with should-cost targets. This allows the functional organization to design a base-
line to meet the customer requirements and cost targets, and gives management the time 
to review and redirect the design before the proposal is submitted. Furthermore, it gives 
management an early opportunity to assess the chances of winning during the acquisition 
cycle, at a point when additional resources can be allocated or the acquisition effort can be 
terminated before too many resources are committed to a hopeless effort.
The final pricing review session should be an integration and review of information 
already well known in its basic context. The process and management tools outlined here 
should help to provide the framework and discipline for deriving pricing decisions in an 
orderly and effective way.
13.2 TYPES OF ESTIMATES
Any company or corporation that wants to remain profitable must con-
tinuously improve its estimating and pricing methodologies. While it 
is true that some companies have been successful without good cost 
estimating pricing, very few remain successful without them.
Good estimating requires that information be collected prior to 
the initiation of the estimating process. Typical information includes:
●
●
Recent experience in similar work
●
●
Professional and reference material
●
●
Market and industry surveys
●
●
Knowledge of the operations and processes
●
●
Estimating software and databases if available
●
●
Interviews with subject matter experts
Projects can range from a feasibility study, through modification of existing facilities, 
to complete design, procurement, and construction of a large complex. Whatever the project 
may be, whether large or small, the estimate and type of information desired may differ 
radically. To save time, companies usually start with a parametric estimate, an analogy esti-
mate, or expert judgment. A parametric estimate is based upon statistical data. An analogy 
estimate compares the features of a completed project to the features of the new project and 
adjusts the costs based upon the change in the degree of difficulty. Expert judgment comes 
from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge because of previous work on these 
types of projects.

Pricing and Estimating 
The first type of estimate is an order-of-magnitude analysis, which is made without 
any detailed engineering data. The order-of-magnitude analysis may have an accuracy of 
±35 percent within the scope of the project. This type of estimate may use past experience 
(not necessarily similar), scale factors, parametric curves, or capacity estimates (i.e., $/# of 
product or $/kW electricity).
Order-of-magnitude estimates are top-down estimates usually applied to level 1 of the 
WBS, and in some industries, use of parametric estimates is included. A parametric estimate 
is based upon statistical data. For example, assume that you live in a Chicago suburb and 
wish to build the home of your dreams. You contact a construction contractor who informs 
you that the parametric or statistical cost for a home in this suburb is $120 per square foot. 
In Los Angeles, the cost may be $350 per square foot.
Next, there is the approximate estimate (or top-down estimate), which is also made 
without detailed engineering data, and may be accurate to ±15 percent. This type of esti-
mate is prorated from previous projects that are similar in scope and capacity, and may 
be titled as estimating by analogy, parametric curves, rule of thumb, and indexed cost of 
similar activities adjusted for capacity and technology. In such a case, the estimator may 
say that this activity is 50 percent more difficult than a previous (i.e., reference) activity and 
requires 50 percent more time, man-hours, dollars, materials, and so on.
The definitive estimate, or grassroots buildup estimate, or bottom-up estimate is pre-
pared from well-defined engineering data including (as a minimum) vendor quotes, fairly 
complete plans, specifications, unit prices, and estimate to complete. The definitive estimate, 
also referred to as detailed estimating, has an accuracy of ±5 percent.
Another method for estimating is the use of learning curves. Learning curves are 
graphical representations of repetitive functions in which continuous operations will lead 
to a reduction in time, resources, and money. The theory behind learning curves is usually 
applied to manufacturing operations.
Each company may have a unique approach to estimating. However, for normal pro-
ject management practices, Table 13–2 would suffice as a starting point.
Many companies try to standardize their estimating procedures by developing an  
estimating manual. The estimating manual is then used to price out the effort, perhaps as 
much as 90 percent. Estimating manuals usually give better estimates than industrial engi-
neering standards because they include groups of tasks and take into consideration such 
items as downtime, cleanup time, lunch, and breaks. Table 13–3 shows the table of contents 
for a construction estimating manual.

Estimating manuals, as the name implies, provide estimates. The question, of course, 
is “How good are the estimates?” Most estimating manuals provide accuracy limitations 
by defining the type of estimates. Using Table 13–3, we can create Tables 13–4, 13–5, 
and 13–6, which illustrate the use of the estimating manual.
Not all companies can use estimating manuals. Estimating manuals work best for 
repetitive tasks or similar tasks that can use a previous estimate adjusted by a degree-of-
difficulty factor. Activities such as R&D do not lend themselves to the use of estimating 
manuals other than for benchmark, repetitive laboratory tests. Proposal managers must 
carefully consider whether the estimating manual is a viable approach. The literature 
abounds with examples of companies that have spent millions trying to develop estimating 
manuals for situations that just do not lend themselves to the approach.

During competitive bidding, it is important that the type of estimate be consistent with 
the customer’s requirements. For in-house projects, the type of estimate can vary over the 
life cycle of a project:
●
●
Conceptual stage: Venture guidance or feasibility studies for the evaluation of 
future work. This estimating is often based on minimum-scope information.
●
●
Planning stage: Estimating for authorization of partial or full funds. These esti-
mates are based on preliminary design and scope.
●
●
Main stage: Estimating for detailed work.
●
●
Termination stage: Reestimation for major scope changes or variances beyond the 
authorization range.
13.3 PRICING PROCESS
This activity schedules the development of the work breakdown structure and provides 
management with two of the three operational tools necessary for the control of a system 
or project. The development of these two tools is normally the responsibility of the project 
office with input from the functional units.
The integration of the functional unit into the project environment or system occurs 
through the pricing-out of the work breakdown structure. The total project costs obtained 
by pricing out the activities over the scheduled period of performance provide manage-
ment with the third tool necessary to successfully manage the project. During the pricing

Pricing and Estimating 
activities, the functional units have the option of consulting project management about 
possible changes in the activity schedules and work breakdown structure.
The work breakdown structure and activity schedules are priced out through the lowest 
pricing units of the company. It is the responsibility of these pricing units, whether they be sec-
tions, departments, or divisions, to provide accurate and meaningful cost data (based on his-
torical standards, if possible). All information is priced out at the lowest level of performance 
required, which, from the assumption of Chapter 11, will be the task level. Costing information 
is rolled up to the project level and then one step further to the total program level.
Under ideal conditions, the work required (i.e., man-hours) to complete a given task 
can be based on historical standards. Unfortunately, for many industries, projects and pro-
grams are so diversified that realistic comparison between previous activities may not be 
possible. The costing information obtained from each pricing unit, whether or not it is 
based on historical standards, should be regarded only as an estimate. How can a company 
predict the salary structure three years from now? What will be the cost of raw materials 
two years from now? Will the business base (and therefore overhead rates) change over the 
duration of the project? The final response to these questions shows that costing data are 
explicitly related to an environment that cannot be predicted with any high degree of cer-
tainty. The systems approach to management, however, provides for a more rapid response 
to the environment than less structured approaches permit.
Once the cost data are assembled, they must be analyzed for their potential impact on 
the company resources of people, money, equipment, and facilities. It is only through a 
total project cost analysis that resource allocations can be analyzed. The resource alloca-
tion analysis is performed at all levels of management, ranging from the section supervi-
sor to the vice president and general manager. For most projects, the chief executive must 
approve final cost data and the allocation of resources.
Proper analysis of the total project costs can provide management (both project and 
corporate) with a strategic planning model for integration of the current project with other 
projects in order to obtain a total corporate strategy. Meaningful planning and pricing mod-
els include analyses for monthly manloading schedules per department, monthly costs per 
department, monthly and yearly total project costs, monthly material expenditures, and 
total project cash-flow and man-hour requirements per month.
Previously we identified several of the problems that occur at the nodes where the 
horizontal hierarchy of project management interfaces with the vertical hierarchy of func-
tional management. The pricing-out of the work breakdown structure provides the basis 
for effective and open communication between functional and project management where 
both parties have one common goal. This is shown in Figure 13–1. After the pricing effort 
is completed, and the project is initiated, the work breakdown structure still forms the basis 
of a communications tool by documenting the performance agreed on in the pricing effort, 
as well as establishing the criteria against which performance costs will be measured.
13.4 ORGANIZATIONAL INPUT REQUIREMENTS
Once the work breakdown structure and activity schedules are established, the project man-
ager calls a meeting for all organizations that will submit pricing information. It is impera-
tive that all pricing or labor-costing representatives be present for the first meeting. During 

Organizational Input Requirements
461
this “kickoff” meeting, the work breakdown structure is described in depth so that each 
pricing unit manager will know exactly what his responsibilities are during the project. The 
kickoff meeting also resolves the struggle for power among functional managers whose 
responsibilities may be similar. Unfortunately, one meeting is not always sufficient to clar-
ify all problems. Follow-up or status meetings are held, normally with only those parties 
concerned with the problems that have arisen. Some companies prefer to have all members 
attend the status meetings so that all personnel will be familiar with the total effort and 
the associated problems. The advantage of not having all project-related personnel attend 
is that time is of the essence when pricing out activities. Many functional divisions carry 
this policy one step further by having a divisional representative together with possibly key 
department managers or section supervisors as the only attendees at the kickoff meeting. 
The divisional representative then assumes all responsibility for assuring that all costing 
data are submitted on time. This arrangement may be beneficial in that the project office 
need contact only one individual in the division to learn of the activity status, but it may 
become a bottleneck if the representative fails to maintain proper communication between 
the functional units and the project office, or if the individual simply is unfamiliar with the 
pricing requirements of the work breakdown structure.
During proposal activities, time may be extremely important. There are many situa-
tions in which a request for proposal (RFP) requires that all responders submit their bids by 
a specific date. Under a proposal environment, the activities of the project office, as well as 
those of the functional units, are under a schedule set forth by the proposal manager. The 
proposal manager’s schedule has very little, if any, flexibility and is normally under tight 
time constraints so that the proposal may be typed, edited, and published prior to the date 
of submittal. In this case, the RFP will indirectly define how much time the pricing units 
have to identify and justify labor costs.

The justification of the labor costs may take longer than the original cost estimates, 
especially if historical standards are not available. Many proposals often require that 
comprehensive labor justification be submitted. Other proposals, especially those that 
request an almost immediate response, may permit vendors to submit labor justification 
at a later date.
In the final analysis, it is the responsibility of the lowest pricing unit supervisors to 
maintain adequate standards, so that an almost immediate response can be given to a pric-
ing request from a project office.
13.5 LABOR DISTRIBUTIONS
The functional units supply their input to the project office in the form of man-hours, as 
shown in Figure 13–2. The input may be accompanied by labor justification, if required. 
The man-hours are submitted for each task, assuming that the task is the lowest pricing 
element, and are time-phased per month. The man-hours per month per task are converted 
to dollars after multiplication by the appropriate labor rates. The labor rates are generally 
known with certainty over a twelve-month period, but from then on are only estimates. 
How can a company predict salary structures five years hence? If the company under­
estimates the salary structure, increased costs and decreased profits will occur. If the salary 
structure is overestimated, the company may not be competitive; if the project is govern-
ment funded, then the salary structure becomes an item under contract negotiations.

Overhead Rates
463
The development of the labor rates to be used in the projection is based on historical 
costs in business base hours and dollars for the most recent month or quarter. Average 
hourly rates are determined for each labor unit by direct effort within the operations 
at the department level. The rates are only averages, and include both the highest-paid 
employees and lowest-paid employees, together with the department manager and 
the clerical support.1 These base rates are then escalated as a percentage factor based on 
past experience, budget as approved by management, and the local outlook and similar 
industries. If the company has a predominant aerospace or defense industry business 
base, then these salaries are negotiated with local government agencies prior to submittal 
for proposals.
The labor hours submitted by the functional units are often overestimated for fear 
that management will “massage” and reduce the labor hours while attempting to maintain 
the same scope of effort. Many times management is forced to reduce man-hours either 
because of insufficient funding or just to remain competitive in the environment.
The reduction of man-hours often causes heated discussions between the functional 
and project managers. Project managers tend to think in terms of the best interests of the 
project, whereas functional managers lean toward maintaining their present staff.
The most common solution to this conflict rests with the project manager. If the pro-
ject manager selects members for the project team who are knowledgeable in man-hour 
standards for each of the departments, then an atmosphere of trust can develop between the 
project office and the functional department so that man-hours can be reduced in a manner 
that represents the best interests of the company. This is one of the reasons why project 
team members are often promoted from within the functional ranks.
The man-hours submitted by the functional units provide the basis for total project cost 
analysis and project cost control.
13.6 OVERHEAD RATES
The ability to control project costs involves more than tracking 
labor dollars and labor hours; overhead dollars, one of the biggest 
headaches, must also be tracked. Although most projects have an 
assistant project manager for cost whose responsibilities include monthly overhead rate 
analysis, the project manager can drastically increase the success of his program by insist-
ing that each program team member understand overhead rates. For example, if overhead 
rates apply only to the first forty hours of work, then, depending on the overhead rate, 
program dollars can be saved by performing work on overtime where the increased salary 
is at a lower burden.
1.   Problems can occur if the salaries of the people assigned to the project exceed the department averages. Meth-
ods to alleviate this problem are discussed later. Also, in many companies department managers are included in 
the overhead rate structure, not in direct labor, and therefore their salaries are not included as part of the depart-
ment average.
PMBOK® Guide, 6th Edition
7.2.1 Estimate Costs Inputs

464
Pricing and Estimating 
Regardless of whether one analyzes a project or a system, all costs must have associ-
ated overhead rates. Unfortunately, many project managers and systems managers consider 
overhead rates as a magic number pulled out of the air. The preparation and assignment of 
overheads to each of the functional divisions is a science. Although the total dollar pool 
for overhead rates is relatively constant, management retains the option of deciding how to 
distribute the overhead among the functional divisions. A company that supports its R&D 
staff through competitive bidding projects may wish to keep the R&D overhead rate as 
low as possible. Care must be taken, however, that other divisions do not absorb additional 
costs so that the company no longer remains competitive on those manufactured products 
that may be its bread and butter.
The development of the overhead rates is a function of three separate elements: 
direct labor rates, direct business base projections, and projection of overhead expenses. 
Direct labor rates have already been discussed. The direct business base projection 
involves the determination of the anticipated direct labor hours and dollars along with 
the necessary direct materials and other direct costs required to perform and complete 
the project efforts included in the business base. Those items utilized in the business base 
projection include all contracted projects as well as the proposed or anticipated efforts. 
The foundation for determination of the business base required for each project can be 
one or more of the following:
●
●
Actual costs to date and estimates to completion
●
●
Proposal data
●
●
Marketing intelligence
●
●
Management goals
●
●
Past performance and trends
The projection of the overhead expenses is made by an analysis of each of the ele-
ments that constitute the overhead expense. A partial listing of those items is shown in 
Table 13–7. Projection of expenses within the individual elements is then made based on 
one or more of the following:
●
●
Historical direct/indirect labor ratios
●
●
Regression and correlation analysis
●
●
Manpower requirements and turnover rates
●
●
Changes in public laws
●
●
Anticipated changes in company benefits
●
●
Fixed costs in relation to capital asset requirements
●
●
Changes in business base
●
●
Bid and proposal (B&P) budgets to win more business
●
●
Internal research and development (IR&D) budgets
For many industries, such as aerospace and defense, the federal government funds 
a large percentage of the B&P and IR&D activities. This federal funding is a necessity 
since many companies could not otherwise be competitive within the industry. The federal 

Materials/Support Costs
465
government employs this technique to stimulate research and competition. Therefore, B&P 
and IR&D are included in the above list.
The prime factor in the control of overhead costs is the annual budget. This budget, 
which is the result of goals and objectives established by the chief executive officer, is 
reviewed and approved at all levels of management. It is established at department level, 
and the department manager has direct responsibility for identifying and controlling costs 
against the approved plan.
The departmental budgets are summarized, in detail, for higher levels of management. 
This summarization permits management, at these higher organizational levels, to be aware 
of the authorized indirect budget in their area of responsibility.
Reports are published monthly indicating current month and year-to-date budget, 
actuals, and variances. These reports are published for each level of management, and an 
analysis is made by the budget department through coordination and review with manage-
ment. Each directorate’s total organization is then reviewed with the budget analyst who 
is assigned the overhead cost responsibility. A joint meeting is held with the directors and 
the vice president and general manager, at which time overhead performance is reviewed.
13.7 MATERIALS/SUPPORT COSTS
The salary structure, overhead structure, and labor hours fulfill three 
of four major pricing input requirements. The fourth major input is 
the cost for materials and support. Six subtopics are included under 
materials/support: materials, purchased parts, subcontracts, freight, travel, and other. 
Freight and travel can be handled in one of two ways, both normally dependent on the size 
of the project. For small-dollar-volume projects, estimates are made for travel and freight. 
For large-dollar-volume projects, travel is normally expressed as between 3 and 5 percent

of the direct labor costs, and freight is likewise between 3 and 5 percent of all costs for 
material, purchased parts, and subcontracts. The category labeled “other support costs” 
may include such topics as special consultants.
Determination of the material costs is very time-consuming, more so than cost deter-
mination for labor hours. Material costs are submitted via a bill of materials that includes 
all vendors from whom purchases will be made, projected costs throughout the project, 
scrap factors, and shelf lifetime for those products that may be perishable.
Upon release of the work statement, work breakdown structure, and subdivided work 
description, the end-item bill of materials and manufacturing plans are prepared as shown in 
Figure 13–3. End-item materials are those items identified as an integral part of the produc-
tion end-item. Support materials consist of those materials required by engineering and oper-
ations to support the manufacture of end-items, and are identified on the manufacturing plan.
A procurement plan/purchase requisition is prepared as soon as possible after contract 
negotiations (using a methodology as shown in Figure 13–4). This plan is used to monitor 
material acquisitions, forecast inventory levels, and identify material price variances.
Manufacturing plans prepared upon release of the subdivided work descriptions are 
used to prepare tool lists for manufacturing, quality assurance, and engineering. From these 
plans a special tooling breakdown is prepared by tool engineering, which defines those 
tools to be procured and the material requirements of tools to be fabricated in-house. These 
items are priced by cost element for input on the planning charts.
The materials/support costs are submitted by month for each month of the project. 
If long-lead funding of materials is anticipated, then they should be assigned to the first 
month of the project. In addition, an escalation factor for costs of materials/support items 
must be applied to all materials/support costs. Some vendors may provide fixed prices over 
time periods in excess of a twelve-month period. As an example, vendor Z may quote a 
firm-fixed price of $130.50 per unit for 650 units to be delivered over the next eighteen 
months if the order is placed within sixty days. There are additional factors that influence 
the cost of materials.
13.8 PRICING OUT THE WORK
Using logical pricing techniques will help in obtaining detailed estimates. The following 
thirteen steps provide a logical sequence to help a company control its limited resources. 
These steps may vary from company to company.
Step 1: Provide a complete definition of the work requirements.
Step 2: Establish a logic network with checkpoints.
Step 3: Develop the work breakdown structure.
Step 4: Price out the work breakdown structure.
Step 5: Review WBS costs with each functional manager.
Step 6: Decide on the basic course of action.

Step 7: Establish reasonable costs for each WBS element.
Step 8: Review the base case costs with upper-level management.
Step 9: Negotiate with functional managers for qualified personnel.
Step 10: Develop the linear responsibility chart.
Step 11: Develop the final detailed schedules.
Step 12: Establish pricing cost summary reports.
Step 13: Document the result in a project plan.
Although the pricing of a project is an iterative process, the project manager must still 
develop cost summary reports at each iteration point so that key project decisions can be 
made during the planning. Detailed pricing summaries are needed at least twice: in prepara-
tion for the pricing review meeting with management and at pricing termination. At all other 
times it is possible that “simple cosmetic surgery” can be performed on previous cost sum-
maries, such as perturbations in escalation factors and procurement cost of raw materials. 
The list below shows the typical pricing reports:
●
●
A detailed cost breakdown for each WBS element. If the work is priced out at the 
task level, then there should be a cost summary sheet for each task, as well as 
­rollup sheets to the top level of the WBS.
●
●
A total project manpower curve for each department. These manpower curves 
show how each department has contracted with the project office to supply func-
tional resources. If the departmental manpower curves contain several “peaks and 
valleys,” then the project manager may have to alter some of his schedules to 
obtain some degree of manpower smoothing. Functional managers always prefer 
manpower-smoothed resource allocations.

Smoothing Out Department Man-Hours

●
●
A monthly equivalent manpower cost summary. This table normally shows the 
fully burdened cost for the average departmental employee carried out over the 
entire period of project performance. If project costs have to be reduced, the pro-
ject manager performs a parametric study between this table and the manpower 
curve tables.
●
●
A yearly cost distribution table. This table is broken down by WBS element and 
shows the yearly (or quarterly) costs that will be required. This table, in essence, 
is a project cash-flow summary per activity.
●
●
A functional cost and hour summary. This table provides top management with 
an overall description of how many hours and dollars will be spent by each major 
functional unit, such as a division. Top management would use this as part of the 
forward planning process to make sure that there are sufficient resources available 
for all projects. This also includes indirect hours and dollars.
●
●
A monthly labor hour and dollar expenditure forecast. This table can be combined 
with the yearly cost distribution, except that it is broken down by month, not activ-
ity or department. In addition, this table normally includes manpower termination 
liability information for premature cancellation of the project by outside customers.
●
●
A raw material and expenditure forecast. This shows the cash flow for raw materi-
als based on vendor lead times, payment schedules, commitments, and termination 
liability.
●
●
Total project termination liability per month. This table shows the customer the 
monthly costs for the entire project. This is the customer’s cash flow, not the con-
tractor’s. The difference is that each monthly cost contains the termination liability 
for man-hours and dollars, on labor and raw materials. This table is actually the 
monthly costs attributed to premature project termination.
These tables are used by project managers as the basis for project cost control and by 
upper-level executives for selecting, approving, and prioritizing projects.
13.9 SMOOTHING OUT DEPARTMENT MAN-HOURS
The dotted curve in Figure 13–5 indicates projected manpower requirements for a given 
department as a result of a typical project manloading schedule. Department manag-
ers, however, attempt to smooth out the manpower curve as shown by the solid line in  
Figure 13–5. Smoothing out the manpower requirements benefits department manag-
ers by eliminating fractional man-hours per day. The project manager must understand 
that if departments are permitted to eliminate peaks, valleys, and small-step functions in 
manpower planning, small project and task man-hour (and cost) variances can occur, but 
should not, in general, affect the total project cost significantly.
Two important questions to ask are whether the department has sufficient person-
nel available to fulfill manpower requirements and what is the rate at which the func-
tional departments can staff the project? Figure 13–6 indicates the types of problems 
that can occur. Curve A shows the manpower requirements for a given department after 

470
Pricing and Estimating 
time-smoothing. Curve B represents the modification to the time-phase curve to account 
for reasonable project manning and demanning rates. The difference between these two 
curves (i.e., the shaded area) therefore reflects the amount of money the contractor may 
have to forfeit owing to manning and demanning activities. This problem can be partially 
overcome by increasing the manpower levels after time-smoothing (see curve C) such that 
the difference between curves B and C equals the amount of money that would be forfeited 
from curves A and B. Of course, project management would have to be able to justify this 
increase in average manpower requirements, especially if the adjustments are made in a 
period of higher salaries and overhead rates.

The Pricing Review Procedure
471
13.10 THE PRICING REVIEW PROCEDURE
The ability to project, analyze, and control problem costs requires coordination of pricing 
information and cooperation between the functional units and upper-level management. 
A typical company policy for cost analysis and review is shown in Figure 13–7. Corpo-
rate management may be required to initiate or authorize activities, if corporate/company 
resources are or may be strained by the project, if capital expenditures are required for new 
facilities or equipment, or simply if corporate approval is required for all projects in excess 
of a certain dollar amount.

Pricing and Estimating 
Upper-level management, upon approval by the chief executive officer of the company, 
approves and authorizes the initiation of the project or program. The actual performance 
activities, however, do not begin until the director of project management selects a project 
manager and authorizes either the bid and proposal budget (if the project is competitive) or 
project planning funds.
The newly appointed project manager then selects this project’s team. Team members, 
who are also members of the project office, may come from other projects, in which case 
the project manager may have to negotiate with other project managers and upper-level 
management to obtain these individuals. The members of the project office are normally 
support-type individuals. In order to obtain team members representing the functional 
departments, the project manager must negotiate directly with the functional managers. 
Functional team members may not be selected or assigned to the project until the actual 
work is contracted for. Many proposals, however, require that all functional team members 
be identified, in which case selection must be made during the proposal stage of a project.
The first responsibility of the project office (not necessarily including functional team 
members) is the development of the activity schedules and the work breakdown structure. 
The project office then provides work authorization for the functional units to price out the 
activities. The functional units then submit the labor hours, material costs, and justification, 
if required, to the pricing team member. The pricing team member is normally attached to 
the project office until the final costs are established, and becomes part of the negotiating 
team if the project is competitive.
Once the base case is formulated, the pricing team member, together with the other 
project office team members, performs perturbation analyses. These analyses are designed 
as systems approaches to problem-solving where alternatives are developed in order to 
respond to management’s questions during the final review.
The base case, with the perturbation analysis costs, is then reviewed with upper-level 
management in order to formulate a company position for the project and to take a hard 
look at the allocation of resources required for the project. The company position may be 
to cut costs, authorize work, or submit a bid. Corporate approval may be required if the 
company’s chief executive officer has a ceiling on the amount he can authorize.
If labor costs must be cut, the project manager must negotiate with the functional man-
agers as to the size and method for the cost reductions. Otherwise, this step would simply 
entail authorization for the functional managers to begin the activities.
Figure 13–7 represents the system approach to determining total program costs. This 
procedure normally creates a synergistic environment, provides open channels of commu-
nication between all levels of management, and ensures agreement among all individuals 
as to program costs.
13.11 SYSTEMS PRICING
The systems approach to pricing out the activity schedules and the work breakdown struc-
ture provide a means for obtaining unity within the company. The flow of information 
readily admits the participation of all members of the organization in the project, even if 
on a part-time basis. Functional managers obtain a better understanding of how their labor 

Systems Pricing
473
fits into the total project and how their activities interface with those of other departments. 
For the first time, functional managers can accurately foresee how their activity can lead 
to corporate profits.
The project pricing model (sometimes called a strategic project planning model) 
acts as a management information system, forming the basis for the systems approach to 
resource control, as shown in Figure 13–8. The summary sheets from the strategic pricing 
model help management select programs that will best utilize resources. The strategic pric-
ing model also provides management with an invaluable tool for performing perturbation 
analysis on the base case costs and an opportunity for design and evaluation of contingency 
plans, if necessary.

13.12 DEVELOPING THE SUPPORTING/BACKUP COSTS
Not all cost proposals require backup support, but for those that do, 
the backup support should be developed along with the pricing. The 
itemized prices should be compatible with the supporting data. 
Government pricing requirements are a special case.
Most supporting data come from external (subcontractor or outside vendor) quotes. 
Internal data must be based on historical data, and these historical data must be updated 
continually as each new project is completed. The supporting data should be traceable by 
itemized charge numbers.
Customers may wish to audit the cost proposal. In this case, the starting point might 
be the supporting data. It is not uncommon on sole-source proposals to have the supporting 
data audited before the final cost proposal is submitted to the customer.
Not all cost proposals require supporting data; the determining factor is usually the 
type of contract. On a fixed-price effort, the customer may not have the right to audit your 
books. However, for a cost-reimbursable package, your costs are an open book, and the 
customer usually compares your exact costs to those of the backup support.
Most companies usually have a choice of more than one estimate to be used for backup 
support. In deciding which estimate to use, consideration must be given to the possibility 
of follow-on work:
●
●
If your actual costs grossly exceed your backup support estimates, you may lose 
credibility for follow-on work.
●
●
If your actual costs are less than the backup costs, you must use the new actual 
costs on follow-on efforts.
The moral here is that backup support costs provide future credibility. If you have 
well documented, “livable” cost estimates, then you may wish to include them in the cost 
proposal even if they are not required.
Since both direct and indirect costs may be negotiated separately as part of a con-
tract, supporting data, such as those in Tables 13–8 through 13–10 and Figure 13–9, may 
be necessary to justify any costs that may differ from company (or customer-approved) 
standards.
13.13 THE LOW-BIDDER DILEMMA
There is little argument about the importance of the price tag to the 
proposal. The question is, what price will win the job? The decision 
process that leads to the final price of your proposal is highly com-
plex with many uncertainties. Yet proposal managers, driven by the desire to win the job, 
may think that a very low-priced proposal will help. But winning is only the beginning.

Special Problems
477
Companies have short- and long-range objectives on profit, market penetration, new prod-
uct development, and so on. These objectives may be incompatible with or irrelevant to a 
low-price strategy. For example:
●
●
A suspiciously low price, particularly on cost-plus type proposals, might be per-
ceived by the customer as unrealistic, thus affecting the bidder’s cost credibility or 
even the technical ability to perform.
●
●
The bid price may be unnecessarily low, relative to the competition and customer 
budget, thus eroding profits.
●
●
The price may be irrelevant to the bid objective, such as entering a new market. 
Therefore, the contractor has to sell the proposal in a credible way, e.g., using cost 
sharing.
●
●
Low pricing without market information is meaningless. The price level is always 
relative to (1) the competitive prices, (2) the customer budget, and (3) the bidder’s 
cost estimate.
●
●
The bid proposal and its price may cover only part of the total project. The ability 
to win phase II or follow-on business depends on phase I performance and phase 
II price.
●
●
The financial objectives of the customer may be more complex than just finding 
the lowest bidder. They may include cost objectives for total system life-cycle cost 
(LCC), for design to unit production cost (DTUPC), or for specific logistic support 
items. Presenting sound approaches for attaining these system cost–performance 
parameters and targets may be just as important as, if not more important than, a 
low bid for the system’s development.
The lowest bidder is certainly not an automatic winner. Both commercial and gov-
ernmental customers are increasingly concerned about cost realism and the ability to 
perform under contract. A compliant, sound, technical and management proposal, based 
on past experience with realistic, well-documented cost figures, is often chosen over the 
lowest bidder, who may project a risky image regarding technical performance, cost, or 
schedule.
13.14 SPECIAL PROBLEMS
There are always special problems that, if overlooked, can have a severe impact on the 
pricing effort. As an example, pricing must include an understanding of cost control—
specifically, how costs are billed back to the project. There are three possible situations:
●
●
Work is priced out at the department average, and all work performed is charged 
to the project at the department average salary, regardless of who accomplished 
the work. This technique is obviously the easiest, but encourages project manag-
ers to fight for the highest salary resources, since only average wages are billed to 
the project.

478
Pricing and Estimating 
●
●
Work is priced out at the department average, but all work performed is billed back 
to the project at the actual salary of those employees who perform the work. This 
method can create a severe headache for the project manager if he tries to use only 
the best employees on his project. If these employees are earning substantially 
more money than the department average, then a cost overrun will occur unless the 
employees can perform the work in less time. Some companies are forced to use 
this method by government agencies and have estimating problems when the pro-
ject that has to be priced out is of a short duration where only the higher-salaried 
employees can be used. In such a situation it is common to “inflate” the direct 
labor hours to compensate for the added costs.
●
●
The work is priced out at the actual salary of those employees who will perform 
the work, and the cost is billed back the same way. This method is the ideal situa-
tion as long as the people can be identified during the pricing effort.
Some companies use a combination of all three methods. In this case, the project office 
is priced out using the third method (because these people are identified early), whereas the 
functional employees are priced out using the first or second method.
13.15 ESTIMATING PITFALLS
Several pitfalls can impede the pricing function. Probably the most 
serious pitfall, and the one that is usually beyond the control of the 
project manager, is the “buy-in” decision, which is based on the 
assumption that there will be “bail-out” changes or follow-on contracts later. These changes 
and/or contracts may be for spare parts, maintenance, maintenance manuals, equipment 
surveillance, optional equipment, optional services, and scrap factors. Other types of esti-
mating pitfalls include:
●
●
Misinterpretation of the statement of work
●
●
Omissions or improperly defined scope
●
●
Poorly defined or overly optimistic schedule
●
●
Inaccurate work breakdown structure
●
●
Applying improper skill levels to tasks
●
●
Failure to account for risks
●
●
Failure to understand or account for cost escalation and inflation
●
●
Failure to use the correct estimating technique
●
●
Failure to use forward pricing rates for overhead, general and administrative, and 
indirect costs
Unfortunately, many of these pitfalls do not become evident until detected by the cost 
control system, well into the project.
PMBOK® Guide, 6th Edition
7.2.1 Estimate Costs Inputs

Estimating High-Risk Projects
479
13.16 ESTIMATING HIGH-RISK PROJECTS
Whether a project is high-risk or low-risk depends on the validity 
of the historical estimate. Construction companies have well-defined 
historical standards, which lowers their risk, whereas many R&D and 
MIS projects are high risk. Typical accuracies for each level of the 
WBS are shown in Table 13–11.
A common technique used to estimate high-risk projects is the “rolling wave” or 
“­moving window” approach. This is shown in Figure 13–10 for a high-risk R&D project. 
The project lasts for twelve months. In part A, the R&D effort to be accomplished for the 
first six months is well defined and can be estimated to level 5 of the WBS. However, the 
effort for the latter six months is based on the results of the first six months and can be 
estimated at level 2 only, thus incurring a high risk. Now consider part B, which shows a 
six-month moving window. At the end of the first month, in order to maintain a six-month 
moving window (at level 5 of the WBS), the estimate for month seven must be improved 
from a level-2 to a level-5 estimate. Likewise, in parts C and D, we see the effects of com-
pleting the second and third months.
There are two key points to be considered in utilizing this technique. First, the length 
of the moving window can vary from project to project, and usually increases in length 
as you approach downstream life-cycle phases. Second, this technique works best when 
upper-level management understands how the technique works. All too often senior man-
agement hears only one budget and schedule number during project approval and might not 
realize that at least half of the project might be time/cost accurate to only 50–60 percent. 
Simply stated, when using this technique, the word “rough” is not synonymous with the 
word “detailed.”

13.17 PROJECT RISKS
Project plans are “living documents” and are therefore subject to 
change. Changes are needed in order to prevent or rectify unfortunate 
situations. These unfortunate situations can be called project risks.
Risk refers to those dangerous activities or factors that, if they occur, will increase the 
probability that the project’s goals of time, cost, and performance will not be met. Many 
risks can be anticipated and controlled. Furthermore, risk management must be an integral 
part of project management throughout the entire life cycle of the project.
Some common risks include:
●
●
Poorly defined requirements
●
●
Lack of qualified resources
●
●
Lack of management support
●
●
Poor estimating
●
●
Inexperienced project manager
Risk identification is an art. It requires the project manager to probe, penetrate, and 
analyze all data. Tools that can be used by the project manager include:
●
●
Decision support systems
●
●
Expected value measures
●
●
Trend analysis/projections
●
●
Independent reviews and audits

The Disaster of Applying the 10 Percent Solution to Project Estimates 
483
Figures 13–11 and 13–12 identify the process of risk evaluation on capital projects. 
In all three exhibits, it is easily seen that the attempt is to quantify the risks, possibly by 
developing a contingency fund.
13.18 THE DISASTER OF APPLYING THE 10 PERCENT  
SOLUTION TO PROJECT ESTIMATES
Economic crunches can and do create chaos in all organizations. For the project manager, 
the worst situation is when senior management arbitrarily employs “the 10 percent solu-
tion,” which is a budgetary reduction of 10 percent for each and every project, especially 
those that have already begun. The 10 percent solution is used to “create” funds for addi-
tional activities for which budgets are nonexistent. The 10 percent solution very rarely 
succeeds. For the most part, the result is simply havoc, resulting in schedule slippages, a 
degradation of quality and performance, and eventual budgetary increases rather than the 
expected decreases.
Most projects are initiated through an executive committee, governing committee, or 
screening committee. The two main functions of these committees are to select the pro-
jects to be undertaken and to prioritize the efforts. Budgetary considerations may also be 
included, as they pertain to project selection. The real budgets, however, are established 
from the middle-management levels and sent upstairs for approvals.
Although the role of executive committee is often ill-defined with regard to budget­
ing, the real problem is that the committee does not realize the impact of adopting the 
10 percent solution. If the project budget is an honest one, then a reduction in budget 
must be accompanied by a trade-off in either time or performance. It is often said that 
90 percent of the budget generates the first 10 percent of the desired service or quality 
levels, and that the remaining 10 percent of the budget will produce the remaining 90 
percent of the target requirements. If this is true, then a 10 percent reduction in budget 
must be accompanied by a loss of performance much greater than the target reduction 
in cost.
It is true that some projects have “padded” estimates, and the budgetary reduction will 
force out the padding. Most project managers, however, provide realistic estimates and 
schedules with marginal padding. Likewise, a trade-off between time and cost is unlikely 
to help, since increasing the duration of the project will increase the cost.
However, there are two viable alternatives. The first is to use the 10 percent solu-
tion, but only on selected projects and after an “impact study” has been conducted, so 
that the executive committee understands the impact on the time, cost, and performance 
constraints. The second choice, which is by far the better one, is for the executive commit-
tee to cancel or descope selected projects. Since it is impossible to reduce budget without 
reducing scope, canceling a project or simply delaying it until the next fiscal year is a viable 
choice. After all, why should all projects have to suffer?
Terminating one or two projects within the queue allows existing resources to be used 
more effectively, more productively, and with higher organizational morale. However, it 
does require strong leadership at the executive committee level for the participants to termi-
nate a project rather than to “pass the buck” to the bottom of the organization with the 

484
Pricing and Estimating 
10 percent solution. Executive committees often function best if the committee is responsi-
ble for project selection, prioritization, and tracking, with the middle managers responsible 
for budgeting.
13.19 LIFE-CYCLE COSTING (LCC)
For years, many R&D organizations have operated in a vacuum 
where technical decisions made during R&D were based entirely 
on the R&D portion of the plan, with little regard for what happens 
after production begins. Today, industrial firms are adopting the life-
cycle costing approach that has been developed and used by military organizations. Simply 
stated, LCC requires that decisions made during the R&D process be evaluated against the 
total life-cycle cost of the system. As an example, the R&D group has two possible design 
configurations for a new product. Both design configurations will require the same budget 
for R&D and the same costs for manufacturing. However, the maintenance and support 
costs may be substantially greater for one of the products. If these downstream costs are 
not considered in the R&D phase, large unanticipated expenses may result at a point where 
no alternatives exist.
Life-cycle costs are the total cost to the organization for the ownership and acquisi-
tion of the product over its full life. This includes the cost of R&D, production, operation, 
support, and, where applicable, disposal. A typical breakdown description might include:
●
●
R&D costs: The cost of feasibility studies; cost-benefit analyses; system analy-
ses; detail design and development; fabrication, assembly, and test of engineering 
models; initial product evaluation; and associated documentation.
●
●
Production cost: The cost of fabrication, assembly, and testing of production 
models; operation and maintenance of the production capability; and associated 
internal logistic support requirements, including test and support equipment devel-
opment, spare/repair parts provisioning, technical data development, training, and 
entry of items into inventory.
●
●
Construction cost: The cost of new manufacturing facilities or upgrading existing 
structures to accommodate production and operation of support requirements.
●
●
Operation and maintenance cost: The cost of sustaining operational personnel and 
maintenance support; spare/repair parts and related inventories; test and support 
equipment maintenance; transportation and handling; facilities, modifications, and 
technical data changes; and so on.
●
●
Product retirement and phaseout cost (also called disposal cost): The cost of phas-
ing the product out of inventory due to obsolescence or wearout, and subsequent 
equipment item recycling and reclamation as appropriate.
Life-cycle cost analysis is the systematic analytical process of evaluating various alter-
native courses of action early on in a project, with the objective of choosing the best way to 
employ scarce resources. Life-cycle cost is employed in the evaluation of alternative design

Life-Cycle Costing (LCC)

configurations, alternative manufacturing methods, alternative support schemes, and so 
on. This process includes defining the problem (what information is needed), defining the 
requirements of the cost model being used, collecting historical data–cost relationships, 
and developing estimate and test results.
Successful application of LCC will provide downstream resource impact visibility, 
provide life-cycle cost management, influence R&D decision-making, and support down-
stream strategic budgeting.
There are also several limitations to life-cycle cost analyses. They include:
●
●
The assumption that the product, as known, has a finite life-cycle
●
●
A high cost to perform, which may not be appropriate for low-cost/low-volume 
production
●
●
A high sensitivity to changing requirements
Life-cycle costing requires that early estimates be made. The estimating method 
selected is based on the problem context (i.e., decisions to be made, required accuracy, 
complexity of the product, and the development status of the product) and the operational 
considerations (i.e., market introduction date, time available for analysis, and available 
resources).
The estimating methods available can be classified as follows:
●
●
Informal estimating methods
●
●
Judgment based on experience
●
●
Analogy
●
●
SWAG method
●
●
ROM method
●
●
Rule-of-thumb method
●
●
Formal estimating methods
●
●
Detailed (from industrial engineering standards)
●
●
Parametric
Table 13–12 shows the advantages/disadvantages of each method.
Life-cycle cost analysis is an integral part of strategic planning since today’s decision 
will affect tomorrow’s actions. Yet there are common errors made during life-cycle cost 
analyses:
●
●
Loss or omission of data
●
●
Lack of systematic structure
●
●
Misinterpretation of data
●
●
Wrong or misused techniques
●
●
A concentration on insignificant facts

Failure to check work

13.20 LOGISTICS SUPPORT
There is a class of projects called “material” projects where the deliverable may require 
maintenance, service, and support after development. This support will continue through-
out the life cycle of the deliverable. Providing service to these deliverables is referred to as 
logistics support.
The two key parameters used to evaluate the performance of material systems are sup-
portability and readiness. Supportability is the ability to maintain or acquire the necessary

human and nonhuman resources to support the system. Readiness is a measure of how 
good we are at keeping the system performing as planned and how quickly we can make 
repairs during a shutdown. Clearly, proper planning during the design stage of a project can 
reduce supportability requirements, increase operational readiness, and minimize or lower 
logistics support costs.
The ten elements of logistics support are:
	 1.	 Maintenance planning: The process conducted to evolve and establish maintenance con-
cepts and requirements for the lifetime of a materiel system.
	 2.	 Manpower and personnel: The identification and acquisition of personnel with the skills 
and grades required to operate and support a material system over its lifetime.
	 3.	 Supply support: All management actions, procedures, and techniques used to determine 
requirements to acquire, catalog, receive, store, transfer, issue, and dispose of secondary 
items. This includes provisioning for initial support as well as replenishment supply sup-
port.
	 4.	 Support equipment: All equipment (mobile or fixed) required to support the operation and 
maintenance of a materiel system. This includes associated multiuse end-items; ground-
handling and maintenance equipment; tools, metrology, and calibration equipment; and 
test and automatic test equipment. It includes the acquisition of logistics support for the 
support and test equipment itself.
	 5.	 Technical data: Recorded information regardless of form or character (such as manuals and 
drawings) of a scientific or technical nature. Computer programs and related software are 
not technical data; documentation of computer programs and related software are. Also 
other information related to contract administration.
	 6.	 Training and training support: The processes, procedures, techniques, training devices, and 
equipment used to train personnel to operate and support a materiel system. This includes 
individual and crew training; new equipment training; initial, formal, and on-the-job train-
ing; and logistic support planning for training equipment and training device acquisitions 
and installations.
	 7.	 Computer resource support: The facilities, hardware, software, documentation, man-
power, and personnel needed to operate and support embedded computer ­systems.
	 8.	 Facilities: The permanent or semipermanent real property assets required to support the 
materiel system. Facilities management includes conducting studies to define types of fa-
cilities or facility improvement, locations, space needs, environment requirements, and 
equipment.
	 9.	 Packaging, handling, storage, and transportation: The resources, processes, procedures, 
design considerations, and methods to ensure that all system, equipment, and support items 
are preserved, packaged, handled, and transported properly. This includes environmental 
considerations and equipment preservation requirements for short- and long-term storage 
and transportability.
	10.	 Design interface: The relationship of logistics-related design parameters to readiness and 
support resource requirements. These logistics-related design parameters are expressed in 
operational terms rather than as inherent values and specifically relate to system readiness 
objectives and support costs of the material system.

13.21 ECONOMIC PROJECT SELECTION CRITERIA:  
CAPITAL BUDGETING
Project managers are often called upon to be active participants during 
the benefit-to-cost analysis of project selection. It is highly unlikely 
that companies will approve a project where the costs exceed the ben-
efits. Benefits can be measured in either financial or nonfinancial terms.
The process of identifying the financial benefits is called capital budgeting, which may 
be defined as the decision-making process by which organizations evaluate projects that 
include the purchase of major fixed assets such as buildings, machinery, and equipment. 
Sophisticated capital budgeting techniques take into consideration depreciation schedules, 
tax information, and cash flow. Since only the principles of capital budgeting will be dis-
cussed in this text, we will restrict ourselves to the following topics:
●
●
Payback Period
●
●
Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)
●
●
Net Present Value (NPV)
●
●
Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
13.22 PAYBACK PERIOD
The payback period is the exact length of time needed for a firm 
to recover its initial investment as calculated from cash inflows. 
Payback period is the least precise of all capital budgeting methods 
because the calculations are in dollars and not adjusted for the time value of money. Table 
13–13 shows the cash flow stream for Project A.
From Table 13–13, Project A will last for exactly five years with the cash inflows 
shown. The payback period will be exactly four years. If the cash inflow in Year 4 were 
$6,000 instead of $5,000, then the payback period would be three years and 10 months.
The problem with the payback method is that $5,000 received in Year 4 is not worth 
$5,000 today. This unsophisticated approach mandates that the payback method be used as 
a supplemental tool to accompany other methods.

The Time Value of Money and Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) 
489
13.23 THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY AND DISCOUNTED  
CASH FLOW (DCF)
Everyone knows that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar a year 
from now. The reason for this is because of the time value of money. To 
illustrate the time value of money, let us look at the following equation:
FV
PV
=
+
(
)
1
k n  
where FV = Future value of an investment
	
PV = Present value
k = Investment interest rate  (or cost of capital)
	
n = Number of years 
Using this formula, we can see that an investment of $1,000 today (PV) invested at 
10% (k) for one year (n) will give us a future value of $1,100. If the investment is for two 
years, then the future value would be worth $1,210.
Now, let us look at the formula from a different perspective. If an investment yields 
$1,000 a year from now, then how much is it worth today if the cost of money is 10%? To 
solve the problem, we must discount future values to the present for comparison purposes. 
This is referred to as discounted cash flows (DCF).
The previous equation can be written as: FV
PV=
FV
1(
)
+ k n
Using the data given: $1,000
PV=
1 000
1
0 1 1
$ ,
(
. )
$
+
= 909
Therefore, $1,000 a year from now is worth only $909 today. If the interest rate, k, is 
known to be 10%, then you should not invest more than $909 to get the $1,000 return a 
year from now. However, if you could purchase this investment for $875, your interest rate 
would be more than 10%.
Discounting cash flows to the present for comparison purposes is a viable way to assess 
the value of an investment. As an example, you have a choice between two investments. 
Investment A will generate $100,000 two years from now and investment B will generate 
$110,000 three years from now. If the cost of capital is 15%, which investment is better?
Using the formula for discounted cash flow, we find that:
PV

B

This implies that a return of $100,000 in two years is worth more to the firm than a 
$110,000 return three years from now.

where FV is the future value of the cash inflows, II represents the initial investment, 
and k is the discount rate equal to the firm’s cost of capital. Table 13–14 calculates the NPV 
for the data provided previously in Table 13–13 using a discount rate of 10%.
This indicates that the cash inflows discounted to the present will not recover the ini-
tial investment. This, in fact, is a bad investment to consider. Previously, we stated that the 
cash flow stream yielded a payback period of four years. However, using discounted cash 
flow, the actual payback is greater than five years, assuming that there will be cash inflow 
in years 6 and 7.
If in Table 13–14 the initial investment was $5,000, then the net present value would 
be $3,722. The decision-making criteria using NPV are as follows:
●
●
If the NPV is greater than or equal to zero dollars, accept the project.
●
●
If the NPV is less than zero dollars, reject the project.
A positive value of NPV indicates that the firm will earn a return equal to or greater 
than its cost of capital.
13.25 INTERNAL RATE OF RETURN (IRR)
The internal rate of return (IRR) is perhaps the most sophisticated 
capital budgeting technique and also more difficult to calculate than 
NPV. The internal rate of return is the discount rate where the present

The solution to problems involving IRR is basically a trial-and-error solution. Table 
13–15 shows that with the cash inflows provided, and with a $5,000 initial investment, an 
IRR of 10% yielded a value of $3,722 for NPV. Therefore, as a second guess, we should 
try a value greater than 10% for IRR to generate a zero value for NPV. Table 13–15 shows 
the final calculation.
The table implies that the cash inflows are equivalent to a 31% return on investment. 
Therefore, if the cost of capital were 10%, this would be an excellent investment. Also, this 
project is “probably” superior to other projects with a lower value for IRR.
13.26 COMPARING IRR, NPV, AND PAYBACK
For most projects, both IRR and NPV will generate the same accept-
reject decision. However, there are differences that can exist in the 
underlying assumptions that can cause the projects to be ranked dif-
ferently. The major problem is the differences in the magnitude and timing of the cash 
inflows. NPV assumes that the cash inflows are reinvested at the cost of capital, whereas 
IRR assumes reinvestment at the project’s IRR. NPV tends to be a more conservative 
approach.
The timing of the cash flows is also important. Early year cash inflows tend to be at a 
lower cost of capital and are more predictable than later year cash inflows. Because of the 
downstream uncertainty, companies prefer larger cash inflows in the early years rather than 
the later years.
Magnitude and timing are extremely important in the selection of capital projects. 
Consider Table 13–16.

If the company has sufficient funds for one and only one project, the natural assump-
tion would be to select Project D with a 35% IRR. Unfortunately, companies shy away 
from long-term payback periods because of the relative uncertainties of the cash inflows 
after Year 1.
13.27 RISK ANALYSIS
Suppose you have a choice between two projects, both of which 
require the same initial investment, have identical net present values, 
and require the same yearly cash inflows to break even. If the cash 
inflow of the first investment has a probability of occurrence of 95% 
and that of the second investment is 70%, then risk analysis would indicate that the first 
investment is better.
Risk analysis refers to the chance that the selection of this project will prove to be 
unacceptable. In capital budgeting, risk analysis is almost entirely based upon how well 
we can predict cash inflows since the initial investment is usually known with some degree 
of certainty. The inflows, of course, are based upon sales projections, taxes, cost of raw 
materials, labor rates, and general economic conditions.
Sensitivity analysis is a simple way of assessing risk. A common approach is to esti-
mate NPV based upon an optimistic (best case) approach, most likely (expected) approach, 
and pessimistic (worst case) approach. This can be illustrated using Table 13–17. Both Pro-
jects A and B require the same initial investment of $10,000, with a cost of capital of 10%, 
and with expected five-year annual cash inflows of $5,000/year. The range for Project A’s 
NPV is substantially less than that of Project B, thus implying that Project A is less risky. A 
risk lover might select Project B because of the potential reward of $27,908, whereas a risk 
avoider would select Project A, which offers perhaps no chance for loss.
13.28 CAPITAL RATIONING
Capital rationing is the process of selecting the best group of pro-
jects such that the highest overall net present value will result with-
out exceeding the total budget available. An assumption with capital

Capital Rationing

rationing is that the projects under consideration are mutually exclusive. There are two 
approaches often considered for capital rationing.
The internal rate of return approach plots the IRRs in descending order against the 
cumulative dollar investment. The resulting figure is often called an investment opportunity 
schedule. As an example, suppose a company has $300,000 committed for projects and 
must select from the projects identified in Table 13–18. Furthermore, assume that the cost 
of capital is 10%.
Figure 13–13 shows the investment opportunity schedule. Project G should not be con-
sidered because the IRR is less than the firm’s cost of capital, but we should select Projects, 
A, B, and C, which will consume $280,000 out of a total budget of $300,000. This allows 
us to have the three largest IRRs.
The problem with the IRR approach is that it does not guarantee that the projects with 
the largest IRRs will maximize the total dollar returns. The reason is that not all of the 
funds have been consumed.

A better approach is the net present value method. In this method, the projects are 
again ranked according to their IRRs, but the combination of projects selected will be 
based upon the highest net present value. As an example, the selection of Projects A, B, 
and C from Table 13–18 requires an initial investment of $280,000 with resulting dis-
counted cash flows of $446,000. The net present value of Projects A, B, and C is, therefore, 
$166,000. This assumes that unused portions of the original budget of $300,000 do not gain 
or lose money. However, if we now select Projects A, B, and D, we will invest $300,000 
with a net present value of $170,000 ($470,000 less $300,000). Selection of Projects A, B, 
and D will, therefore, maximize net present value.
13.29 PROJECT FINANCING
Project financing involves the establishment of a legally independent project company, 
usually for large-scale investments (LSI) and long term where the providers of funds are 
repaid out of cash flow and earnings, and where the assets of the unit (and only the unit) 
are used as collateral for the loans. Debt repayment would come from the project company 
only rather than from any other entity. A risk with project financing is that the capital assets 
may have a limited life. The potential limited life constraint often makes it difficult to get 
lenders to agree to long-term financial arrangements.
Another critical issue with project financing especially for high-technology projects is 
that the projects are generally long term. It may be nearly eight to ten years before service 
will begin, and in terms of technology, eight years can be an eternity. Project financing is 
often considered a “bet on the future.” And if the project were to fail, the company could 
be worth nothing after liquidation.

until the job is half over?
13–2	 With reference to Figure 13.7, under what conditions could each of the following situa-
tions occur:
a.	 Project manager and project office determine labor hours by pricing out the work break-
down structure without coordination with functional management.
b.	 Upper-level management determines the price of a bid without forming a project office 
or consulting functional management.
c.	 Perturbations on the base case are not performed.
d.	 The chief executive officer selects the project manager without consulting his directors.
e.	 Upper-level management does not wish to have a cost review meeting prior to submittal 
of a bid.
13–3	 How can upper-level management use the functional cost and hour summary to de-
termine manpower planning for the entire company? How would you expect management to 
react if the functional cost and hour summary indicated a shortage or an abundance of trained 
personnel?

13–4	 Two contractors decide to enter into a joint venture on a project. What difficulties can 
occur if the contractors have decided on who does what work, but changes may take place if 
problems occur? What happens if one contractor has higher salary levels and overhead rates?
13–5	 The Jones Manufacturing Company is competing for a production contract that requires 
that work begin in January 2016. The cost package for the proposal must be submitted by July 
2015. The business base, and therefore the overhead rates, are uncertain because Jones has the 
possibility of winning another contract, to be announced in September 2015. How can the im-
pact of the announcement be included in the proposal? How would you handle a situation where 
another contract may not be renewed after January 2016 (i.e., assume that the announcement 
would not be made until March)?
13–6	 During initial pricing activities, one of the functional managers discovers that the work 
breakdown structure requires costing data at a level that is not normally made, and will undoubt-
edly incur additional costs. How should you, as a project manager, respond to this situation? 
What are your alternatives?
13–7	 Should the project manager give the final manpower loading curves to the functional 
managers? If so, at what point in time?
13–8	 Should a project manager be appointed in the bidding stage of a project? If so, what 
authority should he have, and who is responsible for winning the contract?

a.	 Contingency planning and estimating
b.	 Using historical databases
c.	 Usefulness of computer estimating
d.	 Usefulness of performance factors to account for inefficiencies and uncertainties. 
THE ESTIMATING PROBLEM
Barbara just received the good news: She was assigned as the project manager for a project that 
her company won as part of competitive bidding. Whenever a request for proposal (RFP) comes 
into Barbara’s company, a committee composed mainly of senior managers reviews the RFP. If 
the decision is made to bid on the job, the RFP is turned over to the Proposal Department. Part 
of the Proposal Department is an estimating group that is responsible for estimating all work. If 
the estimating group has no previous history concerning some of the deliverables or work pack-
ages and is unsure about the time and cost for the work, the estimating team will then ask the 
functional managers for assistance with estimating.
Project managers like Barbara do not often participate in the bidding process. Usually, 
their first knowledge about the project comes after the contract is awarded to their company 
and they are assigned as the project manager. Some project managers are highly optimistic and 
trust the estimates that were submitted in the bid implicitly unless, of course, a significant span 
of time has elapsed between the date of submittal of the proposal and the final contract award 
date. Barbara, however, is somewhat pessimistic. She believes that accepting the estimates as 
they were submitted in the proposal is like playing Russian roulette. As such, Barbara prefers 
to review the estimates.
case study

500
Pricing and Estimating 
One of the most critical work packages in the project was estimated at twelve weeks using 
one grade 7 employee full time. Barbara had performed this task on previous projects and it 
required one person full time for fourteen weeks. Barbara asked the estimating group how they 
arrived at this estimate. The estimating group responded that they used the three-point estimate 
where the optimistic time was four weeks, the most likely time was thirteen weeks, and the pes-
simistic time was sixteen weeks.
Barbara believed that the three-point estimate was way off of the mark. The only way that 
this work package could ever be completed in four weeks would be for a very small project 
nowhere near the complexity of Barbara’s project. Therefore, the estimating group was not 
considering any complexity factors when using the three-point estimate. Had the estimating 
group used the triangular distribution where each of the three estimates had an equal likelihood 
of occurrence, the final estimate would have been thirteen weeks. This was closer to the fourteen 
weeks that Barbara thought the work package would take. While a difference of 1 week seems 
small, it could have a serious impact on Barbara’s project and incur penalties for late delivery.
Barbara was now still confused and decided to talk to Peter, the employee who was as-
signed to do this task. Barbara had worked with Peter on previous projects. Peter was a grade  
9 employee and considered to be an expert in this work package. As part of the discussions with 
Barbara, Peter made the following comments:
I have seen estimating data bases that include this type of work package and they all estimate 
the work package at about 14 weeks. I do not understand why our estimating group prefers 
to use the three point estimate.
“Does the typical data base account for project complexity when considering the ­estimates?” 
asked Barbara. Peter responded:
Some data bases have techniques for considering complexity, but mostly they just assume 
an average complexity level. When complexity is important, as it is in our project, analogy 
estimating would be better. Using analogy estimating and comparing the complexity of the 
work package on this project to the similar works packages I have completed, I would say 
that 16–17 weeks is closer to reality, and let’s hope I do not get removed from the project 
to put out a fire somewhere else in the company. That would be terrible. It is impossible 
for me to get it done in 12 weeks. And adding more people to this work package will not 
shorten the schedule. It may even make it worse.
Barbara then asked Peter one more question:
Peter, you are a grade 9 and considered as the subject matter expert. If a grade 7 had been 
assigned, as the estimating group had said, how long would it have taken the grade 7 to do 
the job?
“Probably about 20 weeks or so,” responded Peter.
QUESTIONS
1.	 How many different estimating techniques were discussed in the case?
2.	 If each estimate is different, how does a project manager decide that one estimate is better 
than another?
3.	 If you were the project manager, which estimate would you use?

14.0 INTRODUCTION 
Cost control is important to all companies, regardless of size. Small 
companies generally have tighter monetary controls because the 
­failure of even one project can put the company at risk, but they have 
less sophisticated control techniques. Large companies may have the 
luxury to spread project losses over several projects, whereas the small 
company may have few projects.
Many people have a poor understanding of cost control yet it is crucial to long-term success. Cost 
control is not only “monitoring” costs and recording data, but also analyzing the data in order to take cor-
rective action before it is too late. It should be performed by all personnel who incur costs, not merely the 
project office.
Cost control implies good cost management, which must include:
●
●
Cost estimating
●
●
Cost accounting
●
●
Project cash flow
●
●
Company cash flow
●
●
Direct labor costing
●
●
Overhead rate costing
●
●
Other tactics, such as incentives, penalties, and profit-sharing
Cost control is actually a subsystem of the management cost and control system (MCCS) rather than 
a complete system per se. This is shown in Figure 14–1, where the MCCS is represented as a two-cycle 
process: a planning cycle and an operating cycle. The operating cycle is what is commonly referred to as the

Cost Control 
cost control system. Failure of a cost control system to accurately describe the true status of a project does 
not necessarily imply that the cost control system is at fault. Any cost control system is only as good as the 
original plan against which performance will be measured. Therefore, the designing of a planning system 
must take into account the cost control system. For this reason, it is common for the planning cycle to be 
referred to as planning and control, whereas the operating cycle is referred to as cost (or cost monitoring 
and collection) and control.
The planning and control system must help management project the status toward objective comple-
tion. Its purpose is to establish policies, procedures, and techniques that can be used in the day-to-day man-
agement and control of projects and programs. It must, therefore, provide information that:
●
●
Gives a picture of true work progress
●
●
Will relate cost and schedule performance
●
●
Identifies potential problems with respect to their sources.
●
●
Provides information to project managers with a practical level of summarization
●
●
Demonstrates that the milestones are valid, timely, and auditable
The planning and control system, in addition to being a tool by which objectives can be defined (i.e., 
hierarchy of objectives and organization accountability), exists as a tool to develop planning, measure pro-
gress, and control change. As a tool for planning, the system must be able to:
●
●
Plan and schedule work
●
●
Identify those indicators that will be used for measurement
●
●
Establish direct labor budgets
●
●
Establish overhead budgets
●
●
Identify management reserve
The project budget that results from the planning cycle of the MCCS must be reasonable, attainable, 
and based on contractually negotiated costs and the statement of work. The basis for the budget is either 
historical cost, best estimates, or industrial engineering standards. The budget must be based upon an 
acceptable level of accuracy in the estimates. The budget must identify planned manpower requirements, 
contract-allocated funds, and management reserve. All of this information becomes the basis for the cost 
management plan which describes how cost are planned, structured, and controlled over the life of the 
project.

Establishing budgets requires that the planner fully understand the meaning of standards. There are 
two categories of standards. Performance results standards are quantitative measurements and include such 
items as quality of work, quantity of work, cost of work, and time-to-complete. Process standards are 
qualitative, including personnel, functional, and physical factors relationships. Standards are advantageous 
in that they provide a means for unity, a basis for effective control, and an incentive for others. The disad-
vantage of standards is that performance is often frozen, and employees are quite often unable to adjust to 
the differences.
As a tool for measuring progress and controlling change, the systems must be able to:
●
●
Measure resources consumed
●
●
Measure status and accomplishments
●
●
Compare measurements to projections and standards
●
●
Provide the basis for diagnosis and replanning
For MCCS to be effective, both the scheduling and budgeting systems must be disciplined and formal 
in order to prevent inadvertent or arbitrary budget or schedule changes. This does not mean that the baseline 
budget and schedule, once established, is static or inflexible. Rather, it means that changes must be con-
trolled and result only from deliberate management actions.
Disciplined use of MCCS is designed to put pressure on the project manager to perform exceptionally 
good project planning so that changes will be minimized. As an example, government subcontractors may 
not:
●
●
Make retroactive changes to budgets or costs for work that has been completed
●
●
Rebudget work-in-progress activities
●
●
Transfer work or budget independently of each other
●
●
Reopen closed work packages
14.1 UNDERSTANDING CONTROL
Effective management of a program during the operating cycle 
requires that a well-organized cost and control system be designed, 
developed, and implemented so that immediate feedback can be 
obtained, whereby the up-to-date usage or resources can be com-
pared to target objectives established during the planning cycle. The requirements for an 
effective control system (for both cost and schedule/performance) should include1:
●
●
Thorough planning of the work to be performed to complete the project
●
●
Good estimating of time, labor, and costs
●
●
Clear communication of the scope of required tasks
●
●
A disciplined budget and authorization of expenditures
●
●
Timely accounting of physical progress and cost expenditures

504
Cost Control 
●
●
Periodic reestimation of time and cost to complete remaining work
●
●
Frequent, periodic comparison of actual progress and expenditures to schedules 
and budgets, both at the time of comparison and at project completion
Management must compare the time, cost, and performance of the program to the 
budgeted time, cost, and performance, not independently but in an integrated manner. 
Being within one’s budget at the proper time serves no useful purpose if performance is 
only 75 percent. Likewise, having a production line turn out exactly 200 items, as planned, 
loses its significance if a 50 percent cost overrun is incurred. All three resource parameters 
(time, cost, and performance) must be analyzed as a group, or else we might “win the bat-
tle but lose the war.” The use of the expression “management cost and control system” is 
vague in that the implication is that only costs are controlled. This is not true—an effective 
control system monitors schedule and performance as well as costs by setting budgets, 
measuring expenditures against budgets and identifying variances, assuring that the expen-
ditures are proper, and taking corrective action when required.
The WBS is the total project broken down into successively lower levels until the 
desired control levels are established. The work breakdown structure therefore serves as 
the tool from which performance can be subdivided into objectives and subobjectives. As 
work progresses, the WBS provides the framework on which costs, time, and schedule/
performance can be compared against the budget for each level of the WBS.
The first purpose of control therefore becomes a verification process accomplished by 
the comparison of actual performance to date with the predetermined plans and standards 
set forth in the planning phase. The comparison serves to verify that:
●
●
The objectives have been successfully translated into performance standards.
●
●
The performance standards are, in fact, a reliable representation of program activi-
ties and events.
●
●
Meaningful budgets have been established such that actual versus planned com-
parisons can be made.
In other words, the comparison verifies that the correct standards were selected, and 
that they are properly used.
The second purpose of control is decision-making. Three useful reports are required 
by management in order to make effective and timely decisions:
●
●
The project plan, schedule, and budget prepared during the planning phase
●
●
A detailed comparison between resources expended to date and those predetermined. 
This includes an estimate of the work remaining and the impact on activity completion.
●
●
A projection of resources to be expended through program completion
These reports, supplied to the managers and the doers, provide three useful results:
●
●
Feedback to management, the planners, and the doers
●
●
Identification of any major deviations from the current program plan, schedule, 
or budget

Understanding Control
505
●
●
The opportunity to initiate contingency planning early enough that cost, perfor-
mance, and time requirements can undergo corrected action without loss of resources
These reports provide management with the opportunity to minimize downstream 
changes by making proper corrections here and now. As shown in Figures 14–2 and 14–3, 
cost reductions are more available in the early project phases, but are reduced as we go 
further into the project life-cycle phases. Figure 14–3 identifies the people that most likely 
have the greatest influence on possibly initiating changes to a project. Downstream the cost 
of changes could easily exceed the original cost of the project. This is an example of the 
“iceberg” syndrome, where problems become evident too late in the project to be solved 
easily, resulting in a very high cost to correct them.

14.2 THE OPERATING CYCLE
The MCCS takes on paramount importance during the operating cycle of the project. The 
operating cycle is composed of four phases:
●
●
Work authorization and release (phase II)
●
●
Cost data collection and reporting (phase III)
●
●
Cost analysis (phase IV)
●
●
Reporting: customer and management (phase V)
These four phases, when combined with the planning cycle (phase I), constitute a 
closed system network that forms the basis for the management cost and control system.
After planning is completed and a contract is received, phase II is authorized via a 
work description document. The work description, or project work authorization form, is a 
contract that contains the narrative description, organization, and time frame for each WBS 
level. This multipurpose form is used to release the contract, authorize planning, record 
detail description of the work outlined in the work breakdown structure, and release work 
to the functional departments.
Contract services may require a work description form to release the contract. The 
contractual work description form sets forth general contractual requirements and author-
izes program management to proceed.
Program management may then issue a subdivided work description form to the func-
tional units so that work can begin. The subdivided work description specifies how contractual 
requirements are to be accomplished, the functional organizations involved, and their specific 
responsibilities, and authorizes the expenditure of resources within a particular time frame.
The work control center assigns a work order number to the subdivided work description 
form, if no additional instructions are required, and releases the document to the performing 
organizations. If additional instructions are required, the work control center can prepare a 
more detailed work-release document (shop traveler, tool order, work order release), assign 
the applicable work order number, and release it to the performing organization.
A work order number is required for all in-house direct and indirect charging. The work 
order number also serves as a cross-reference number for automatic assignment of the inden-
tured work breakdown structure number to labor and material data records in the computer.
Small companies can avoid this additional paperwork cost by going directly from an 
awarded contract to a single work order, which may be the only work order needed for the 
entire contract.
14.3 COST ACCOUNT CODES
Since project managers control resources through the line managers 
rather than directly, project managers end up controlling direct labor 
costs by opening and closing work orders. Work orders define the 
charge numbers for each cost account. By definition, a cost account

Cost Account Codes

is an identified level at a natural intersection point of the work breakdown structure and 
the organizational breakdown structure (OBS) at which functional responsibility for the 
work is assigned, and actual direct labor, material, and other direct costs are compared with 
actual work performed for management control purposes.
Cost accounts are the focal point of the MCCS and may comprise several work pack-
ages, as shown in Figure 14–4. Work packages are detailed short-span job or material items 
identified for the accomplishment of required work. Costs need not be reported at the work 
package level but can be rolled up to higher levels in the WBS. This referred to as cost 
aggregation.
To illustrate how the work packages are used, consider the cost account code break-
down shown in Figure 14–5 and the work authorization form shown in Figure 14–6. The 
work authorization form specifically identifies the cost centers that are “open” for this 
charge number, the man-hours available for each cost center, and the operational time 
period for the charge number. Because the exact dates of operation are completely defined, 
the charge number can be assigned perhaps as much as a year in advance of the work-begin 
date. This can be shown pictorially, as in Figure 14–7.
If a cost center needs additional time or additional man-hours, 
then a cost account change notice form must be initiated, usually 
by the requesting cost center, and approved by the project office. 
Figure 14–8 shows a typical cost account change notice form.
Cost data collection and reporting constitute the second phase 
of the operating cycle of the MCCS (and phase III in the overall 
MCCS). Actual cost (ACWP) and the budgeted cost for work performed (BCWP) for each 
contract or in-house project are accumulated in detailed cost accounts by cost center and 
cost element, and reported in accordance with the flow charts shown in Figure 14–9. These 
detailed elements, for both actual costs incurred and the budgeted cost for work performed, 
are usually made available monthly for all levels of the work breakdown structure. In addi-
tion, weekly supplemental direct labor reports can be printed showing the actual labor 
charge incurred, and can be compared to the predicted efforts.
Most weekly labor reports provide current month subtotals and previous month totals. 
Although these also appear on the detailed monthly report, they are included in the weekly 
report for a quick-and-dirty comparison. Year-to-date totals are usually not on the weekly 
report unless the users request them for an immediate comparison to the estimate at com-
pletion (EAC) and the work order release.
Weekly labor output is a vital tool for members of the program office in that these 
reports can indicate trends in cost and performance in sufficient time for contingency plans 
to be established and implemented. If these reports are not available, then cost and labor 
overruns would not be apparent until the following month when the detailed monthly labor, 
cost, and materials output was obtained.
Work order releases are used to authorize certain cost centers to begin charging their 
time to a specific cost reporting element. Work orders specify hours, not dollars. The hours 
indicate the “targets” that the program office would like to have the department shoot for. 
If the program office wished to be more specific and “compel” the departments to live 
within these hours, then the budgeted cost for work scheduled (BCWS) should be changed 
to reflect the reduced hours.

Four categories of cost data are normally accumulated:
●
●
Labor
●
●
Material
●
●
Other direct charges
●
●
Overhead
Project managers can maintain reasonable control over labor, 
material, and other direct charges. Overhead costs, on the other hand, 
are calculated yearly or monthly and applied retroactively to all 
applicable programs. Management reserves are often used to coun-
terbalance the effects of adverse changes in overhead rates. Gener-
ally, management reserves are used for known-unknowns such as 
uncertainties in estimating.
14.4 BUDGETS
The project budget, which is the final result of the planning cycle of the MCCS, must 
be reasonable, attainable, and based on contractually negotiated costs and the statement 
of work. The basis for the budget is either historical cost, best estimates, or industrial 
engineering standards. The budget must identify planned manpower requirements, contract 
allocated funds, and management reserve.

All budgets must be traceable through the budget “log,” which includes:
●
●
Distributed budget
●
●
Management reserve
●
●
Undistributed budget
●
●
Contract changes
The distributed or normal performance budget is the time-phased budget that is 
released through cost accounts and work packages. Management reserve is generally the 
dollar amount established for categories of unforeseen problems and contingencies result-
ing in special out-of-scope work to the performers.
The management reserve should be established based upon the project’s risks. Some 
project may require no management reserve at all, whereas others may necessitate a reserve 
of 15 percent.
There is always the question of who should get to keep any unused management 
reserve at the end of the project. If the project is under a firm-fixed price contract, then the 
management reserve becomes extra profit for the performing organization. If the contract 
is a cost reimbursable type, all or part of the unused management reserve may have to be 
returned to the customer.
Although the management reserve may appear as a line item in the work breakdown 
structure, it is neither part of the distributed budget nor part of the cost baseline. Budgets 
are established on the assumption that they will be spent, whereas management reserve is 
money that you try not to spend. It would be inappropriate to consider the management 
reserve as an undistributed budget.
In addition to the “normal” performance budget and the management reserve budget, 
there are two other budgets:
●
●
Undistributed budget, which is that budget associated with contract changes where 
time constraints prevent the necessary planning to incorporate the change into the 
performance budget. (This effort may be time-constrained.)
●
●
Unallocated budget, which represents a logical grouping of contract tasks that 
have not yet been identified and/or authorized.
14.5 THE EARNED VALUE MEASUREMENT SYSTEM (EVMS)
In the early years of project management, it became evident that project managers were 
having difficulty determining project status. Some people believed that status could be 
determined only by a mystical approach, such as a fortune teller.
The critical question was whether project managers were managing costs or just mon-
itoring costs. The government wanted costs to be managed rather than just monitored, 
accounted for, or reported. This need resulted in the creation of the EVMS.
The basis for the EVMS, which some consider to be a component of the MCCS, is 
the determination of earned value. Earned value is a management technique that relates 
resource planning to schedules and technical performance requirements. Earned value 

Variance and Earned Value
513
management (EVM) is a systematic process that uses earned value as the primary tool for 
integrating cost, schedule, technical performance management, and risk management.
Without using the EVMS, determining status can be difficult. Consider the following:
●
●
The project
●
●
A total budget of $1.2 million
●
●
A 12-month effort
●
●
Produce 10 deliverables
●
●
Reported status
●
●
Time elapsed: 6 months
●
●
Money spent to date: $700,000
●
●
Deliverables produced: 4 complete, 2 partial
What is the real status of the project? How far along is the project: 40, 50, 60 percent, 
etc.? Another problem was how to accurately relate cost to performance. If you spent 20 
percent of the budget, does that imply that you are 20 percent complete? If you are 30 per-
cent complete, then have you spent 30 percent of the budget?
The EVMS provides the following benefits:
●
●
Accurate display of project status
●
●
Early and accurate identification of trends
●
●
Early and accurate identification of problems
●
●
Basis for course corrections
The EVMS can answer the following questions:
●
●
What is the true status of the project?
●
●
What are the problems?
●
●
What can be done to fix the problems?
●
●
What is the impact of each problem?
●
●
What are the present and future risks?
The EVMS emphasizes prevention over cures by identifying and resolving problems 
early. The EVMS is an early warning system allowing for early identification of trends and 
variances from the plan. The EVMS provides an early warning system, thus allowing the 
project manager sufficient time to make course corrections in small increments. It is usu-
ally easier to correct small variances as opposed to large variances. Therefore, the EVMS 
should be used continuously throughout the project in order to detect the variances while 
they are small and possibly easy to correct. Large variances are more difficult to correct 
and run the risk that the cost to correct the large variance may displease management to the 
point where the project may be canceled.
14.6 VARIANCE AND EARNED VALUE
A variance is defined as any schedule, technical performance, or cost deviation from a 
specific plan. Variances must be tracked and reported. They should be mitigated through 
corrective actions and not eliminated through a baseline change unless there is a good 

514
Cost Control 
reason. Variances are used by all levels of management to verify the budgeting system and 
the scheduling system. The budgeting and scheduling system variance must be compared 
because:
●
●
The cost variance compares deviations only from the budget and does not provide 
a measure of comparison between work scheduled and work accomplished.
●
●
The scheduling variance provides a comparison between planned and actual per-
formance but does not include costs.
There are two primary methods of measurement:
●
●
Measurable efforts: Discrete increments of work with a definable schedule for 
accomplishment, whose completion produces tangible results.
●
●
Level of effort: Work that does not lend itself to subdivision into discrete scheduled 
increments of work, such as project support and project control.
Calculating Variances
Variances are used on both types of measurement. In order to calculate 
variances, we must define the three basic variances for budgeting and 
actual costs for work scheduled and performed:
●	 Budgeted cost for work scheduled (BCWS) is the budgeted 
amount of cost for work scheduled to be accomplished plus the 
amount or level of effort or apportioned effort scheduled to be 
accomplished in a given time period.
●
●
Budget cost for work performed (BCWP) is the budgeted amount 
of cost for completed work, plus budgeted for level of effort or 
apportioned effort activity completed within a given time period. 
This is sometimes referred to as “earned value.”
●
●
Actual cost for work performed (ACWP) is the amount reported as actually 
expended in completing the work accomplished within a given time period.
Note:	 The Project Management Institute has changed the nomenclature in their new version of 
the PMBOK® Guide, whereby BCWS is now PV, BCWP is now EV, and ACWP is now AC. 
However, the majority of heavy users of these acronyms, specifically government contrac-
tors, still use the old acronyms. Until the PMI acronyms are accepted across all industries, 
we will continue to focus on the most commonly used acronyms.
BCWS represents the time-phased budget plan against which performance is meas-
ured. For the total contract, BCWS is normally the negotiated contract plus the estimated 
cost of authorized but unpriced work (less any management reserve). It is time-phased by 
the assignment of budgets to scheduled increments of work. For any given time period, 
BCWS is determined at the cost account level by totaling budgets for all work packages, 
plus the budget for the portion of in-process work (open work packages), plus the budget 
for level of effort and apportioned effort.

Variance and Earned Value
515
A contractor must utilize anticipated learning when developing the time-phased 
BCWS. Any recognized method used to apply learning is usually acceptable as long as the 
BCWS is established to represent as closely as possible the expected actual cost (ACWP) 
that will be charged to the cost account/work package.
These costs can then be applied to any level of the work breakdown structure (i.e., 
program, project, task, subtask, work package) for work that is completed, in-program, or 
anticipated. Using these definitions, the following variance definitions are obtained:
●
●
Cost variance (CV) calculation:
CV=BCWP
ACWP
−
A negative variance indicates a cost-overrun condition.
●
●
Schedule variance (SV) calculation:
SV=BCWP
BCWS
−
A negative variance indicates a behind-schedule condition.
In the analysis of both cost and schedule, costs are used as the lowest common denom-
inator. In other words, the schedule variance is given as a function of cost. To alleviate this 
problem, the variances are usually converted to percentages:
Cost variance%(CVP)
CV
BCWP
=
Schedulevariance%(SVP)
SV
BCWS
=
The schedule variance may be represented by hours, days, weeks, or even dollars.
As an example, consider a project that is scheduled to spend $100K for each of the 
first four weeks of the project. The actual expenditures at the end of week four are $325K. 
Therefore, BCWS 5 $400K and ACWP 5 $325K. From these two parameters alone, there 
are several possible explanations as to project status. However, if BCWP is now known, say 
$300K, then the project is behind schedule and overrunning costs.
It is important to understand the physical meaning of CV and SV. Consider the fol-
lowing example:
●
●
BCWS = $1000
●
●
BCWP = $800
●
●
ACWP = $700
In this example, CV = $800 – $700 = +$100. Because CV is a positive value, it indi-
cates that physical progress was accomplished at a lower cost than the forecasted cost. 
This is a favorable situation. Had CV been negative, it would have indicated that physical 
progress was accomplished at a greater cost than what was forecasted. If CV 50, then the 
physical accomplishment was as budgeted.

516
Cost Control 
Although CV is measured in hours or dollars, it is actually a measurement of the effi-
ciency with which physical progress was accomplished compared with the plan. To correct 
a negative cost variance, emphasis should be placed upon the productivity rate (i.e., burn 
rate) at which work is being performed.
Returning to the above example, SV = $800 –$1000 = –$200. In this example, the 
schedule variance is a negative value, indicating that physical progress is being accom-
plished at a slower rate than planned. This is an unfavorable condition. If the schedule 
variance were positive, this would indicate physical progress being accomplished at a faster 
rate than planned. If SV = 0, physical progress is being accomplished as planned.
The schedule variance, SV, measures the timeliness of the physical progress compared 
to the plan whereas the cost variance, CV, measures the efficiency. To correct a negative 
schedule variance, emphasis should be placed upon improving the speed by which work is 
being performed.
The CV relates to the real cost. However, the problem with SV is how it relates to the 
real schedule. The schedule variance is determined from cost account or work package 
financial numbers and does not necessarily relate to the real schedule. The schedule vari-
ance does not distinguish between critical path and non–critical path work packages. The 
schedule variance by itself does not measure time. A negative schedule variance indicates 
a behind-schedule condition but does not mean that the critical path has slipped. On the 
contrary, the real schedule (i.e., precedence networks or the arrow diagramming networks) 
could indicate that the project will be ahead of schedule. A detailed analysis of the real 
schedule is still required irrespective of the value for the schedule variance.
Variance Controls
Variances are almost always identified as critical items and are reported 
to all organizational levels. Critical variances are established for each 
level of the organization in accordance with management policies.
Not all companies have a uniform methodology for variance thresholds. Permitted 
variances may be dependent on such factors as:
●
●
Life-cycle phase
●
●
Length of life-cycle phase
●
●
Length of project
●
●
Type of estimate
●
●
Accuracy of estimate
Variance controls may be different from program to program. Table 14–1 identifies 
sample variance criteria for program X.
For many programs and projects, variances are permitted to change over the duration 
of the program. For strict manufacturing programs (product management), variances may 
be fixed over the program time span using criteria like those in Table 14–1. For programs 
that include research and development, larger deviations may be permitted during the ear-
lier phases than during the later phases. Figure 14–10 shows time-phased cost variances for 
a program requiring research and development, qualification, and production phases. Since 
the risk should decrease as time goes on, the variance boundaries are reduced. The variance 
envelope in such a case may be dependent on the type of estimate.

Variance and Earned Value
517
By using both cost and schedule variance, we can develop an integrated cost/schedule 
reporting system that provides the basis for variance analysis by measuring cost perfor-
mance in relation to work accomplished. This system ensures that both cost budgeting and 
performance scheduling are constructed on the same database.

*Thresholds are usually tighter within company reporting system than required external to government. Thresholds for external 
reporting are usually adjusted during various phases of program (% lower at end).

In addition to calculating the cost and schedule variances in terms 
of dollars or percentages, we also want to know how efficiently the 
work has been accomplished. The formulas used to calculate the per-
formance efficiency as a percentage of EV are:

If the CPI and SPI = 1.0, we have perfect cost and schedule performance. If CPI and 
SPI are less than 1.0, physical progress is being accomplished at a greater cost or slower 
rate than forecasted. This is unfavorable. If CPI and SPI are greater than 1.0, physical pro-
gress is being accomplished at less cost or a faster rate than planned, which is favorable. 
Similar to CV, CPI measures the efficiency by which the physical progress was accom-
plished compared to the plan or baseline. For an unfavorable value of CPI or SPI, emphasis 
should be placed upon improving the productivity by which work was being performed or 
the timeliness of the physical progress.
SPI and CPI are expressed as ratios compared to the performance factor of 1.0 
whereas CV and SV are expressed in dollars or hours. One historic reason for this is 
that SPI and CPI can be used to show performance for a specified time period or trends 
over a long time horizon without disclosing actual company sensitive numbers. This 
makes SPI and CPI valuable tools for customer status reporting without disclosing 
hard numbers.
Trend Analysis and Reporting
The cost and schedule performance index is most often used for 
trend analysis as shown in Figure 14–11. Companies use either three-
month, four-month, or six-month moving averages to predict trends. Trend analysis 
provides an early warning system and allows managers to take corrective action. Unfor-
tunately, its use may be restricted to long-term projects because of the time needed to 
correct the situation.
Figure 14–12 shows an integrated cost/schedule system. The figure identifies a 
performance slippage to date because the actual performance is less than the sched-
uled performance. This might not be a bad situation if the costs are proportionately 
underrun. However, from the upper portion of Figure 14–12, we find that costs are 
overrun (actual costs are greater than the target cost), thus adding to the severity of the 
­situation.
Also shown in Figure 14–12 is the management reserve. Management reserves cover 
unforeseen events within a defined project scope, but are not used for unlikely major 
events or changes in scope. These changes are funded separately, perhaps through man-
agement-established contingency funds. Actually, there is a difference between manage-
ment reserves (which come from project budgets) and contingency funds (which come 
from external sources) although most people do not differentiate. It is a natural tendency 
for a functional manager (and some project managers) to substantially inflate estimates to 
protect the particular organization and provide a certain amount of cushion. Furthermore, 
if the inflated budget is approved, managers will undoubtedly use all of the allocated funds, 
including reserves.
The line indicated as actual cost in Figure 14–12 shows a cost overrun compared to 
the budget. However, costs are still within the contractual requirement if we consider the 
management reserve. Therefore, things may not be as bad as they seem.

variance analysis reports, as shown in Figure 14–13, are required. Required signatures may 
include:
●
●
The functional employees responsible for the work
●
●
The functional managers responsible for the work
●
●
The cost accountant and/or the assistant project manager for cost control
●
●
The project manager, work breakdown structure element manager, or someone 
with signature authority from the project office
For variance analysis, the goal of the cost account manager (whether project officer 
or functional employee) is to take action that will correct the problem within the original 
budget or justify a new estimate.
Five questions must be addressed during variance analysis:
●
●
What is the problem causing the variance?
●
●
What is the impact on time, cost, and performance?
●
●
What is the impact on other efforts, if any?
●
●
What corrective action is planned or under way?
●
●
What are the expected results of the corrective action?
One of the key parameters used in variance analysis is the “earned value” concept, 
which is the same as BCWP. Earned value is a forecasting variable used to predict whether 
the project will finish over or under the budget.

Variance and Earned Value
521
The major difficulty encountered in the determination of BCWP is the evaluation of 
in-process work (work packages that have been started but have not been completed at the 
time of cutoff for the report). The use of short-span work packages or establishment of dis-
crete value milestones within work packages will significantly reduce the work-in-process 
evaluation problem, and procedures used will vary depending on work package length. For 
example, some contractors prefer to take no BCWP credit for a short-term work package 
until it is completed, while others take credit for 50 percent of the work package budget 
when it starts and the remaining 50 percent at completion. Some contractors use formulas 
that approximate the time-phasing of the effort, others use earned standards, while still oth-
ers prefer to make physical assessments of the work completed to determine the applicable 
budget earned. For longer work packages, many contractors use discrete milestones with 
preestablished budget or progress values to measure work performed.
The difficulty in performing variance analysis is the calculation of BCWP because one 
must predict the percent complete. The simplest formula for calculating BCWP is:
BCWP = (% complete)

Most people calculate “percent complete” based upon task durations. However, a more 
accurate representation would be to calculate “percent work complete.” However, this

requires a schedule that is resource loaded. To eliminate this problem, many companies use 
standard dollar expenditures for the project, regardless of percent complete. For example, 
we could say that 10 percent of the costs are to be “booked” for each 10 percent of the time 
interval. Another technique, and perhaps the most common, is the 50/50 rule:
Half of the budget for each element is recorded at the time that the work is scheduled to 
begin, and the other half at the time that the work is scheduled to be completed. For a 
project with a large number of elements, the amount of distortion from such a procedure is 
minimal. (Figures 14–14 and 14–15 illustrate this technique.)
One advantage of using the 50/50 rule is that it eliminates the necessity for the con-
tinuous determination of the percent complete. However, if percent complete can be deter-
mined, then percent complete can be plotted against time expended, as shown in Figure 
14–16.
There are techniques available other than the 50/50 rule:
●
●
0/100: Usually limited to work packages (activities) of small duration (i.e., less 
than one month). No value is earned until the activity is complete.
●
●
Milestone: This is used for long work packages with associated interim mile-
stones, or a functional group of activities with a milestone established at identified

budget is assigned to the milestone rather than the work packages.
●
●
Percent complete: Usually invoked for long-duration work packages (i.e., three 
months or more) where milestones cannot be identified. The value earned would 
be the reported percent of the budget.

Equivalent units: Used for multiple similar-unit work packages, where earnings 
are on completed units, rather than labor.

Level of effort: This method is based on the passage of time, often used for supervi-
sion and management work packages. The value earned is based on time expended 
over total scheduled time. It is measured in terms of resources consumed over a 
given period of time and does not result in a final product.
●
●
Apportioned effort: A rarely used technique, for special related work pack-
ages. As an example, a production work package might have an apportioned 
inspection work package of 20 percent. There are only a few applications of 
this technique. Many people will try to use this for supervision, which is not a 
valid application. This technique is used for effort that is not readily divisible 
into short-span work packages but that is in proportion to some other measured 
effort.

Estimate at Completion (EAC)
The estimate at completion (EAC) is the best estimate of the total 
cost at the completion of the project. The EAC is a periodic evalua-
tion of the project status, usually on a monthly basis or until a signifi-
cant change has been identified. It is usually the responsibility of the 
performing organization to prepare the EAC.
The calculation of a new EAC and subsequent revision does not 
imply that corrective action has been taken. Consider a three-month task that is 99 percent 
complete and was budgeted to spend $400K (BCWS). The actual costs to date (ACWP) 
are $395K. Using the 50/50 rule, BCWP is $200K. The estimated cost-to-complete (EAC) 
ratio is $395K/$200K, which implies that we are heading for a 100 percent cost overrun. 
Obviously, this is not the case.

Using the data in Table 14–2, we can calculate the estimate at completion (EAC) by 
the expression where BAC is the value of BCWS at completion.
EAC=(ACWP/BCWP) BAC=BAC/CIP
=(360/340) 579,000
=$613,059
×
×
The discussion of what value to use for BAC is argumentative. In the above calcula-
tion, we used burdened direct labor dollars. Some people prefer to use nonburdened labor 
with the argument that the project manager controls only direct labor hours and dollars. 
Also, the calculation for EAC did not include material costs or general and administra-
tive costs.
The above calculation of EAC implies that we are overrunning labor costs by 6.38 percent 
and that the final burdened labor cost will exceed the budgeted burdened labor cost by $34,059. 
For a more precise calculation of EAC we would need to include material cost (assumed at 
$70,000) and G&A. This would give us a final cost, excluding profit, of $751,365, which is 
an overrun of $37,365. The resulting profit would be $86,000 less $37,365, or $48,635. The 
final analysis is that work is being accomplished almost on schedule except for subtask 4 and 
subtask 6, but costs are being overrun.

Cost Overruns
The question that remains is, “Where is the cost overrun occurring?” 
To answer this question, we must analyze the cost summary sheet for 
project Z, task 3. Table 14–2 represents a hypothetical case for the cost elements of project 

526
Cost Control 
Z, task 3. From Table 14–2 we see that negative (overrun) variances exist for labor dollars, 
overhead dollars, and material costs. Because labor overhead is measured as a percentage 
of direct labor dollars, the problem appears to be in the direct labor dollars.
From the contractual column in Table 14–2 the project was estimated at $27.86 per 
hour direct labor ($241,000/8650 hours), but actuals to date are $150,000/4652 hours, or 
$32.24 per hour. Therefore, higher-salaried people than anticipated are being employed. 
This salary increase is partially offset by the fact that there exists a positive variance of 
409 direct labor hours, indicating that these higher-salaried employees are performing at 
a more favorable position than expected on the learning curve. Since the milestones (from 
Figure 14–15) appear to be on target, work is progressing as planned, except for subtask 4.
The labor overhead rate has not changed. The contractual, BCWS, and BCWP over-
head rates were estimated at 140 percent. The actuals, obtained from month-end reports, 
indicate that the true overhead rate is as predicted.
The following conclusions can be drawn:
●
●
Work is being performed as planned (almost on schedule, although at a more 
favorable position on the learning curve), except for subtask 4, which is giving us 
a schedule delay.
●
●
Direct labor costs are increasing through the use of higher-salaried employees.
●
●
Overhead rates are as anticipated.
●
●
Direct labor hours must be reduced even further to compensate for increased costs, 
or profits will be drastically reduced.
This type of analysis could have been carried out to one more level by identifying 
exactly which departments were using the more expensive employees. This step should 
probably be completed anyway to see if lower-paid employees are available and can work 
at the required position on the learning curve. Had the labor costs been a result of increased 
labor hours, this step would have definitely been necessary to identify the reason for the 
overrun in-house. Perhaps poor estimating was the cause.
In Table 14–2, there also appears a positive variance in materials. This likewise should 
undergo further analysis. The cause may be the result of improperly identified hardware, 
material escalation costs increasing beyond what was planned, increased scrap factors, or 
a change in subcontractors.
It should be obvious from this analysis that a detailed investigation into the cause of 
variances appears to be the best method for identifying causes. The concept of earned value, 
although a crude estimate, identifies trends concerning the status of specific WBS elements.
EAC Formulas
There are several formulas that can be used to calculate EAC. Using the 
data shown below, we can illustrate how each of three different formulas 
can give a different result. Assume that your project consists of these three activities only.

Advantages and disadvantages exist for each formula. Formula I assumes that the burn 
rate (i.e., ACWP/BCWP) will be the same for the remainder of the project. This is the 
­easiest formula to use. The burn rate is updated each reporting period.
Formula II assumes that all work packages not yet opened will be completed at the 
planned cost. However, it is possible for planned cost to be revised based upon history from 
completed work packages.
Formula III assumes that all remaining work is independent of the burn rate incurred 
thus far. This may be unrealistic unless all remaining work can be reestimated if necessary.
Organization-Level Analysis
Each critical variance identified on the organizational MCCS reports 
may require the completion of MCCS variance analysis procedures 
by the supervisor of the cost center involved. Analyzing both the work breakdown and 
organizational structure, the supervisor systematically concentrates his efforts on cost and 
schedule problems appearing within his organization.
Analysis begins at the lowest organizational level by the supervisor involved. Criti-
cal variances are noted at the cost account on the MCCS report. If a schedule variance is 
involved and the subtask consists of a number of work packages, the supervisor may refer 
to a separate report that breaks down each cost account into the various work packages that 
are ahead or behind schedule. The supervisor can then analyze the variance on the basis 
of the work package involved and determine with the aid of supporting organizations the 
cause of the variance, the corrective action that can be taken, or the possible effect on asso-
ciated or future planned effort.
Cost variances involving labor are analyzed by the supervisor on the basis of the per-
formance of his organization in accomplishing the work assigned, within the budgeted 
man-hours and planned labor rate. The cause of any variance to this performance is deter-
mined, and corrective action is then implemented.

528
Cost Control 
The program team member may receive a team critical variance 
report that lists variances in his organization at the lowest level of the 
work breakdown structure at the division cost center level by cost element. Upon request 
of the program manager, analyses of variances contributing to the variances on the team 
critical variance report are summarized by the responsible program team member and 
reviewed with the program manager. The preparation of status reports, whether they be 
for internal management or for the customer, should, at a minimum, answer two funda-
mental ­questions:
●
●
Where are we today (with respect to time and cost)?
●
●
Where will we end up (with respect to time and cost)?
The information necessary to answer these questions can be obtained from the follow-
ing formulas:
●
●
Where are we today?
●
●
Cost variances (in dollars/hours and percent complete)
●
●
Schedule variances (in dollars/hours and percent complete)

●

●
Where will we end up?
●
●

●
●

●
●
SPI (trend analysis)
●
●
CPI (trend analysis)
Since SPI and CPI are used for trend analyses, we can use CPI and SPI to forecast 
the expected final cost and the expected end date of the project. We can express the cost at 
completion, EAC, as:
EAC= BAC
CPI
Cost variances on non-labor efforts are analyzed by the supervisor with the aid of the 
program team member and other supporting organizations.
All material variance analyses are normally initiated by cost accounting as a ser-
vice to the using organization. These variance analyses are completed, including cause 
and corrective action, to the extent that can be explained by cost accounting. They are 
then sent to the using organization, which reviews the analyses and completes those 
resulting from schedule performance or usage. If a variance is recognized as a change 
in the material acquisition price, this information is supplied by cost accounting to the 
responsible organization and a change to the estimate-to-complete is initiated by the 
using organization.
The supervisor should forward copies of each completed MCCS variance analysis/
EAC change form to his higher-level manager and the program team member.
Program Team Analysis

The Cost Baseline
529
The time at completion uses SPI for the forecast and can be expressed as:
New project length= Original project length
SPI
Care must be taken with the use of SPI to calculate the new project length because a 
favorable value for SPI (i.e., .1.0) could be the result of work packages that are not on the 
critical path.
Once EAC and the new project length are calculated, we can calculate the variance 
at completion (VAC) and the estimated cost to complete (ETC) using the following two 
formulas:
VAC = BAC
EAC
and
ETC = EAC
ACWP
−
−
Percent complete and percent money spent can be obtained from the following for-
mulas:
Percent complete = BCWP
BAC
Percent money spent = ACWP
BAC
Another formula that appears to be important today is the to-complete performance 
index. This shows the cost performance that is necessary to complete a component of work. 
The formula is:
TCPI = (BAC 
 EV)/(BAC 
 AC)
−
−
The program manager uses this information to review the program status with upper-
level management. This review is normally on a monthly basis on large projects. In addi-
tion, the results of these analyses are used to explain variances in the contractually required 
reports to the customer.
After the analyses of the variances have been made, reports must be developed for both 
the customer and in-house (upper-level) management.
14.7 THE COST BASELINE
Once the project is initiated, the project team establishes the cost 
or financial baseline against which status will be reported and vari-
ances will be measured. Figure 14–17 represents a cost baseline. 
Each block represents a cost account or work package element. The 
summation of all of the cost accounts or work packages would then equal the time-phased

budget. Each work package would then be described through the work authorization form 
for that work package.
The cost baseline in Figure 14–17 is just part of the cost breakdown. An illustration of 
a cost breakdown appears in Figure 14–18.
There are certain distinguishing features of Figure 14–18:

The cost baseline is the summation of the time-phased budget (i.e., the distributed 
budget) and the undistributed budget. This will equal the released, planned budget 
at completion (BAC).
●
●
The contractual cost to complete the project is the summation of the cost baseline 
and the management reserve, assuming that a management reserve exists.
●
●
The contract price is the contract cost plus the profit, if any.
14.8 JUSTIFYING THE COSTS
Project pricing is often based upon best guesses rather than concrete estimates. This is 
particularly true for companies that survive on competitive bidding and where the prepara-
tion cost of a bid may vary between $50,000 and $500,000. If the probability of winning a 
bid is low, then the company may spend the minimum amount of time and cost during bid 
preparation.
Table 14–3 shows a typical project pricing summary where each functional area or 
division can have its own overhead rate. In this summary, the overhead rate for engineering 
is 110 percent, whereas the manufacturing overhead rate is 200 percent. If this company 
is a subsidiary of a larger company, then a corporate general and administrative (G&A) 
cost may be included. If the project is for an external customer, then a profit margin will 
be included.
Once the project pricing summary is completed, the costs must be justified before 
executive committee. Every company has its own evaluation criteria cost summary approval 
process.
Typical elements that must be justified or supported by hard data include:
Labor Rates: For estimating purposes, department averages or skill set weighted aver-
ages can be used. This is sometimes called the blended rate. The best-case scenario would

be estimating from the actual salary or skill set of the workers to be assigned. This may be 
impossible during competitive bidding because we do not know who will be available or 
who will be assigned assuming the contract is received. Also, if the project is a multiyear 
effort, we may need forward pricing rates, which are the predicted, full burdened salaries 
anticipated in the next few years. This is illustrated in Table 14–4.
●
●
Overtime: If resources are scarce and the company has no intention of hiring addi-
tional resources, then some of the work must be accomplished on overtime. This 
could increase the cost of the project and an allowance must be made for possible 
mistakes made during this period of excessive overtime.
●
●
Scrap factors: If the project includes procurement of raw materials, then some 
scrap factor allowance may be necessary. This calculation may be impacted by 
the skill set of the resources assigned and using the materials, previous experience 
using these materials, and experience on these types of projects.
●
●
Risks: Risk analysis may be based upon the quality of the estimates and experi-
ence of those who made the estimates. Other risks considered include the com-
pany’s ability to achieve the anticipated benefits or the designated profits and, if a 
disaster occurs, the company’s exposure and liability for lawsuits.
●
●
Hidden costs: These costs, such as travel, shipping and postage, capital costs, 
and meeting attendance, can erode all of the profitability expected on a project. 
Another potentially hidden cost is the yearly or monthly workload availability. A 
typical calculation appears in Table 14–5. If we use Table 14–5 and all of the work-
ers are long-term employees, then there may be less than 1840 hours available per 
year to account for vacations, sick leave, etc.
14.9 THE COST OVERRUN DILEMMA
The lifeblood of most organizations is a continuous stream of new products or services. 
Because of the word “new,” historical data may be at a minimum and cost overruns are 
expected. Figure 14–19 shows a typical range of overruns.

The Cost Overrun Dilemma
533
Rough order-of-magnitude (ROM) estimates are often made from “soft” data, which 
can result in a wide range of overruns, and are used in the initiation phase of a project. As 
we go from soft data to hard data and enter the planning phase of a project, the accuracy of 
the estimates improves and the range of the overruns narrows.
When overruns occur, the project manager looks for ways of reducing costs. The sim-
plest way is to reduce scope. This begins with a search for items that are easy to cut. The 
items that are easiest to cut are those items that were poorly understood during the estimat-
ing process and were therefore underestimated. Typical items that are cut or reduced in 
magnitude include project management supervision, line management supervision, process 
controls, quality assurance, and testing.

Cost Control 
If the easy-to-cut items do not provide sufficient cost reductions, then a desperate 
search begins among the hard-to-cut items. Hard-to-cut items include direct labor hours, 
materials, equipment, facilities, and other items.
If the cost reductions are unacceptable to management, then management must decide 
whether or not to pull the plug and cancel the project.
14.10 RECORDING MATERIAL COSTS USING EARNED VALUE MEASUREMENT
Recording direct labor costs usually presents no problem since labor costs are normally 
recorded as the labor is accomplished. Therefore, recorded and reported labor will be the 
same. Material costs, on the other hand, may be recorded at various times. Material costs 
can be recorded as commitments, expenditures, accruals, and applied costs. All provide 
useful information and are important for control purposes.
Because of the choices available for material cost analysis, material costs should 
be reported separately from the standard labor hour/labor dollar earned value report. 
For example, cost variances associated with the procurement of material may be deter-
mined at the time that the purchase orders are negotiated and placed with the ven-
dors since this information provides the earliest visibility of potential cost variance 
problems. Significant variances in the anticipated and actual costs of materials can 
have a serious effect on the total contract cost and should be reflected promptly in the 
estimated cost at completion (EAC) and explained in the narrative part of the project 
status report.
Separating labor from material costs is essential. Consider the following example: 
You are budgeted to spend $1,000,000 in burdened labor and $600,000 in material. 
At the end of the first month of your project, the following information is available 
to you:
Labor:
ACQP = $90,000
BCWP = $100,000
BAC = $1,000,000
Material:
AWCP = $450,000
BCWP = $400,000
BAC = $600,000
For simplicity’s sake, let us use the following formula for EAC:
EAC = (ACWP/BCWP) 
BAC
×
Therefore,
EAC (labor)
= $900,000
EAC (material
= $675,000

Material Variances: Price and Usage
535
If we add together both EACs, the estimated cost at completion will be $1,575,000, 
which is $25,000 below the planned budget. If the costs are combined before we calculate 
EAC, then
EAC = [($450,000 + $90,000)/$500,000] 
 ($1,600,000) = $1,
×
728,000
which is a $128,000 overrun. Therefore, it is usually best to separate material from 
labor in status reporting. Another major problem is how to account for the costs of material 
placed on order, which does not reflect the cost of work completed and is not normally used 
in status reporting. For performance measurement purposes, it is desirable that material 
costs be recorded at the time that the materials are received, paid for, or used rather than as 
of the time that they are ordered. Therefore, the actual costs reported for materials should 
be derived in accordance with established procedures, and normally will be recorded for 
earned value measurement purposes at or after time of material receipt. In addition, costs 
should always be recorded on the same basis as budgets are prepared in order to make 
comparisons between budgeted and actual costs meaningful. For example, material should 
not be budgeted on the basis of when it is used and then have its costs collected/reported 
on the basis of when it is received.
14.11 MATERIAL VARIANCES: PRICE AND USAGE
When the actual material costs exceed a material budget, there are normally two causes:
●
●
The articles purchased cost more than was planned, called a “price variance.”
●
●
More articles were consumed than were planned, called a “usage variance.”
Price variances (PV) occur when the budgeted price value (BCWS) of the material was 
different than what was actually experienced (ACWP). This condition can arise for a host 
of reasons: poor initial estimates, inflation, different materials used than were planned, too 
little money available to budget, and so on.
The formula for price variance (PV) is:
PV = (Budgeted price 
 Actual price) 
 (Actual quantity)
−
×
Price variance is the difference between the budgeted cost for the bill of materials and 
the price paid for the bill of materials. By contrast, usage variances (UV) occur when a 
greater quantity of materials is consumed than were planned. The formula for usage vari-
ance (UV) is:
UV = (Budgeted quantity 
 Actual quantity)

Cost Control 
Normally, usage variances are the resulting costs of materials used over and above the 
quantity called for in the bill of materials.
Consider the following example: The project manager establishes a material budget of 
100 units (which includes 10 units for scrap factor) at a price of $150 per unit. Therefore, 
the material budget was set at $15,000. At the end of the short project, material actuals 
(ACWP) came in at $15,950, which was $950 over budget. What happened?
Applying the formulas defined previously,

The analysis indicates that your purchase price was less than you anticipated, thus gen-
erating a cost savings. However, you used 10 units more than planned for, thus generating 
an unfavorable usage variance. Further investigation indicated that your line manager had 
increased the scrap factor from 10 to 20 units.
14.12 SUMMARY VARIANCES
Summary variances can be calculated for both labor and material. Consider the information 
shown below:

14.13 STATUS REPORTING
There are four types of performance reports that are generally printed 
out from the earned value measurement system:
●
●
Progress reports: These reports indicate the physical progress to date, namely, 
BCWS, BCWP, and ACWP. The report might also include information on mate-
rial procurement, delivery, and usage, but most companies have separate reports 
on materials.
●
●
Status reports: These reports identify where we are today and use the information 
from the performance reports to calculate SV and CV.
●
●
Projection reports: These reports calculate EAC, ETC, SPI, and CPI as well as 
any other forward-looking projections. These reports emphasize where we will 
end up.
●
●
Exception reports: These reports identify exceptions, problems, or situations that 
exceed the threshold limits on such items as variances, cash flow, resources assigned, 
and other such topics.
Reporting procedures for variance analysis should be as brief as possible. The reason 
for this is simple: the shorter and more concise the report, the faster that feedback can be 
generated and responses developed. Time is critical if rescheduling must be accomplished 
with limited resources.
This by no means implies that all variances require corrective action. There are four 
major responses to a variance report:
●
●
Ignoring it
●
●
Functional modification
●
●
Replanning
●
●
System redesign
Permissible variances exist for all levels of the organization. If the variance is within 
these permitted deviations, then there will be no response, and the variance may be ignored. 
In some situations where the variance is marginal (or even within limits), corrective action 
may be required. This would normally occur at the functional level and might simply 
involve using another test procedure or possibly considering some alternative not deline-
ated in the program plan.
If major variances occur, then either replanning or system redesign must take place.

PROBLEMS
14–1  Do cost overruns just happen, or are they caused?
14–2  What impact would there be on BCWS, BCWP, ACWP, and cost and schedule variances 
as a result of the:
	A.	 Early start of an activity on a PERT chart?
	B.	 Late start of an activity on a PERT chart?
14–3  Alpha Company has implemented a plan whereby functional managers will be held to-
tally responsible for all cost overruns against their (the functional managers’) original estimates. 
Furthermore, all cost overruns must come out of the functional managers’ budgets, whether they 

be overhead or otherwise, not the project budget. What are the advantages and disadvantages 
of this approach?
14–4  What would be the result if all project managers decided to withhold a management  
reserve? What criteria should be used for determining when a management reserve is necessary?
14–5  Consider a situation in which several tasks may be for one to two years rather than the 
200 hours normally used in the work-package level of the WBS.
A.	 How will this affect cost control?
B.	 Can we still use the 50-50 rule?
C.	 How frequently should costs be updated?

should be assigned?
THE BATHTUB PERIOD
The award of the Scott contract on January 3, 2010, left Park Industries elated. The Scott Pro-
ject, if managed correctly, offered tremendous opportunities for follow-on work over the next 
several years. Park’s management considered the Scott Project as strategic in nature.
The Scott Project was a ten-month endeavor to develop a new product for Scott Corpora-
tion. Scott informed Park Industries that sole-source production contracts would follow, for at 
least five years, assuming that the initial R&D effort proved satisfactory. All follow-on contracts 
were to be negotiated on a year-to-year basis.
Jerry Dunlap was selected as project manager. Although he was young and eager, he under-
stood the importance of the effort for future growth of the company. Dunlap was given some of 
the best employees to fill out his project office as part of Park’s matrix organization. The Scott 
Project maintained a project office of seven full-time people, including Dunlap, throughout the 
duration of the project. In addition, eight people from the functional department were selected 
for representation as functional project team members, four full-time and four half-time.
Although the workload fluctuated, the manpower level for the project office and team 
members was constant for the duration of the project at 2,080 hours per month. The company 
assumed that each hour worked incurred a cost of $120.00 per person, fully burdened.
At the end of June, with four months remaining on the project, Scott Corporation informed 
Park Industries that, owing to a projected cash flow problem, follow-on work would not be 
awarded until the first week in March (2011). This posed a tremendous problem for Jerry 
­Dunlap because he did not wish to break up the project office. If he permitted his key people 
to be assigned to other projects, there would be no guarantee that he could get them back at the 
beginning of the follow-on work. Good project office personnel are always in demand.
case studIES

Jerry estimated that he needed $240,000 per month during the “bathtub” period to ­support 
and maintain his key people. Fortunately, the bathtub period fell over Christmas and New Year’s, 
a time when the plant would be shut down for seventeen days. Between the vacation days that his 
key employees would be taking, and the small special projects that his people could be temporarily 
assigned to on other programs, Jerry revised his estimate to $200,000 for the entire bathtub period.
At the weekly team meeting, Jerry told the program team members that they would have to 
“tighten their belts” in order to establish a management reserve of $200,000. The project team 
understood the necessity for this action and began rescheduling and replanning until a manage-
ment reserve of this size could be realized. Because the contract was firm-fixed-price, all sched-
ules for administrative support (i.e., project office and project team members) were extended 
through February 28 on the supposition that this additional time was needed for final cost data 
accountability and program report documentation.
Jerry informed his boss, Frank Howard, the division head for project management, as to 
the problems with the bathtub period. Frank was the intermediary between Jerry and the general 
manager. Frank agreed with Jerry’s approach to the problem and requested to be kept informed.
On September 15, Frank told Jerry that he wanted to “book” the management reserve of 
$200,000 as excess profit since it would influence his (Frank’s) Christmas bonus. Frank and 
Jerry argued for a while, with Frank constantly saying, “Don’t worry! You’ll get your key peo-
ple back. I’ll see to that. But I want those uncommitted funds recorded as profit and the program 
closed out by November 1.”
Jerry was furious with Frank’s lack of interest in maintaining the current organizational 
membership.
QUESTIONS
a.	 Should Jerry go to the general manager?
b.	 Should the key people be supported on overhead?
c.	 If this were a cost-plus program, would you consider approaching the customer with your 
problem in hopes of relief?
d.	 If you were the customer of this cost-plus program, what would your response be for 
additional funds for the bathtub period, assuming cost overrun?
e.	 Would your previous answer change if the program had the money available as a result of 
an underrun?
f.	
How do you prevent this situation from recurring on all yearly follow-on contracts?

FRANKLIN ELECTRONICS
In October 2013 Franklin Electronics won an 18-month labor-intensive product development 
contract awarded by Spokane Industries. The award was a cost reimbursable contract with a 
cost target of $2.66 million and a fixed fee of 6.75 percent of the target. This contract would 
be Franklin’s first attempt at using formal project management, including a newly developed 
project management methodology.
Franklin had won several previous contracts from Spokane Industries, but they were 
all fixed-price contracts with no requirement to use formal project management with 
earned value reporting. The terms and conditions of this contract included the following 
key points:
●
●
Project management (formalized) was to be used.
●
●
Earned value cost schedule reporting was a requirement.

546
Cost Control 
●
●
The first earned value report was due at the end of the second month’s effort and 
monthly thereafter.
●
●
There would be two technical interchange meetings, one at the end of the sixth month 
and another at the end of the twelfth month.
Earned value reporting was new to Franklin Electronics. In order to respond to the original 
request for proposal (RFP), a consultant was hired to conduct a four-hour seminar on earned 
value management. In attendance were the project manager who was assigned to the Spokane 
RFP and would manage the contract after contract award, the entire cost accounting department, 
and two line managers. The cost accounting group was not happy about having to learn earned 
value management techniques, but they reluctantly agreed in order to bid on the Spokane RFP. 
On previous projects with Spokane Industries, monthly interchange meetings were held. On this 
contract, it seemed that Spokane Industries believed that fewer interchange meeting would be 
necessary because the information necessary could just as easily be obtained through the earned 
value status reports. Spokane appeared to have tremendous faith in the ability of the earned 
value measurement system to provide meaningful information. In the past, Spokane had never 
mentioned that it was considering the possible implementation of an earned value measurement 
system as a requirement on all future contracts.
Franklin Electronics won the contact by being the lowest bidder. During the planning phase, 
a work breakdown structure was developed containing forty-five work packages of which only 
four work packages would be occurring during the first four months of the project.
Franklin Electronics designed a very simple status report for the project. The table below 
contains the financial data provided to Spokane at the end of the third month.

A week after sending the status report to Spokane Industries, Franklin’s project manager was 
asked to attend an emergency meeting requested by Spokane’s vice president for engineering, who 
was functioning as the project sponsor. The vice president was threatening to cancel the project be-
cause of poor performance. At the meeting, the vice president commented, “Over the past month 
the cost variance overrun has increased by 78 percent from $14,000 to $25,000, and the schedule 
variance slippage has increased by 45 percent from $31,000 to $45,000. At these rates, we are eas-
ily looking at a 500 percent cost overrun and a schedule slippage of at least one year. We cannot 
afford to let this project continue at this lackluster performance rate. If we cannot develop a plan 
to control time and cost any better than we have in the past three months, then I will just cancel the 
contract now, and we will find another contractor who can perform.”
QUESTIONS
1.	 Are the vice president’s comments about cost and schedule variance correct? What 
information did the vice president fail to analyze?

2.	 What additional information should have been included in the status report?
3.	 Does Franklin Electronics understand earned value measurement? If not, then what went 
wrong?
4.	 Does Spokane Industries understand project management?

15.0 INTRODUCTION
For more than 50 years, relatively project management has been in use but perhaps not on a worldwide or 
company-wide basis. What differentiated companies in the early years was whether or not they used project 
management, not how well they used it. Today, almost every company uses project management and the 
differentiation is whether they are simply good at project management or whether they truly excel at project 
management. The difference between using project management and being good at project management 
is relatively small and most companies can become good at project management in a relatively short time 
period, especially if they have executive-level support and good metrics.
Time and cost has traditionally been the only two primary metrics used to measure and report project 
performance. Everyone knew decades ago that time and cost alone could not accurately show project per-
formance, but these were to two easiest metrics to track and report. Today, advances in measurement tech-
niques and available performance tracking software have given companies the opportunity to look at new 
metrics such as benefits expected, value created, safety, risk, customer satisfaction, image, reputation and 
many others. Executives, sponsors and project managers are now able to make informed decisions based 
upon evidence rather than merely guesses about the health of the projects.
15.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS
A project management information system (PMIS) contains all of the essential and sup-
porting information for project approval, initiation, planning, scheduling, execution, moni-
toring and control, and closure. While an earned-value measurement system (EVMS) is 
a critical component of the PMIS, today’s PMIS contains significantly more metrics than 
just time and cost. The PMIS can provide significant benefits if designed properly, such as:
●
●
Satisfying the information needs for the various stakeholders in a timely manner
●
●
Providing the correct Information for informed decision making

●
●
Having the correct amount of information, rather than too much or too little
●
●
Lowering the cost of collecting the right information
●
●
Providing information on how the project interacts with various initiatives that are 
part of the ongoing business
●
●
Providing information on how one project interacts with other projects being sup-
ported by line managers
●
●
Providing value to the company
A good PMIS can prevent projects from failing because of the derailment in project 
communications. PMIS also makes it easy for team members and functional managers to 
input the information necessary for effective status reporting.
15.2 ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING
For several decades, PMISs were seen as report generators providing information on time, 
cost, and what work was left to do on the project. Time and cost were the two primary 
metrics that were tracked. Today, that has changed.
Companies have come to the realization that everything they do in their company can 
be considered as a project. We are managing our business by projects. Therefore, decision-
makers have a need for information on both business as well as project management pro-
cesses, and the two are now related. Also, we are now looking at significantly more metrics 
than just time and cost.
Information is the key to effective decision making. Companies have developed enterprise 
resource planning (ERP) systems which are enterprise-wide information systems designed to 
coordinate all the resources, information, and tasks needed to complete various business and 
project processes. ERP supports supply chain management, finance and accounting, human 
resource management, and project management. PMIS is now part of ERP systems.
One of the most important reasons for integrating PMIS and ERP is capacity planning. 
Functional managers must supply resources to both projects and ongoing business activi-
ties. ERP systems are invaluable in this regard. Capacity planning is an essential activity in 
the portfolio selection of projects. As an example, the ERP system states that a given func-
tional department has fifteen employees available for work assignments and ten of these 
workers are committed to ongoing work. The ERP system then relays information to the 
PMIS stating that the remaining five employees are available for project work assignments. 
The information can also contain the pay grade of the available workers in case specific 
skill levels must be available for the selection of certain projects.
15.3 PROJECT METRICS
Metrics keep stakeholders informed as to the status of the project. Stakeholders must be 
confident that the correct metrics are being used and that the measurement portrays a clear 
and truthful representation of the status. At the beginning of a project, the project manager 

Project Metrics
551
and the appropriate stakeholders must come to an agreement on which metrics to use and 
how measurements will be made. We are now using more metrics than just time and cost. 
This is partially due to the growth in PMIS and ERP technology as well as stakeholders 
now possessing a greater understanding about project management.
Today, part of the project manager’s new role is to understand what the critical metrics 
are that need to be identified and managed for the project to be viewed as a success by all 
of the stakeholders. Project managers have come to the realization that defining project-
specific metrics and key performance indicators are joint ventures between the project 
manager, client, and stakeholders. Getting stakeholders to agree on the metrics is difficult, 
but it must be done as early as possible in the project.
Unlike financial metrics, project-based metrics can change during each life-cycle 
phase as well as from project to project. Therefore, the establishment and measurement of 
metrics may be an expensive necessity to validate the critical success factors (CSFs) and 
maintain customer satisfaction. Many people believe that the future will be metric-driven 
project management.
Understanding Metrics
Although most companies use some type of metrics for measurement, 
they seem to have a poor understanding of what constitutes a metric, 
at least for use in project management. You cannot effectively manage a project without 
having metrics and accompanying measurement capable of providing you with complete 
or almost complete information. Therefore, the simplest definition of a metric is something 
that is measured. Consider the following:
●
●
If it cannot be measured, then it cannot be managed.
●
●
What gets measured gets done.
●
●
You never really understand anything fully unless it can be measured.
●
●
Without good metrics, you make seat-of-the-pants decisions that are just guesses 
rather than decisions based upon evidence and facts.
Metrics can be measured and recorded as numbers, percentages, dollars, counts, rat-
ings (good, bad, or neutral), or qualitatively versus quantitatively. If you cannot offer a 
stakeholder something that can be measured, then how can you promise that their expec-
tations will be met? You cannot control what you cannot measure. Good metrics lead to 
proactive project management rather than reactive project management if the metrics are 
timely and informative.
For years, measurement itself was not well understood. We avoided metrics manage-
ment because we did not understand it. But authors such as Douglas Hubbard have helped 
to resolve the problem:1
●
●
It has been measured before.
●
●
You have far more data than you think.

Hoboken, NJ, 2014), p. 59.

552
Metrics 
●
●
You need far less data than you think.
●
●
Useful, new observations are more accessible than you think.
Over the years, numerous benefits have surfaced from the use of metrics management. 
Some benefits of using metrics are:
●
●
Metrics tell us if we are hitting the targets/milestones, getting better, or getting 
worse.
●
●
Metrics allow you to catch mistakes before they lead to other mistakes; early iden-
tification of issues.
●
●
Good metrics lead to informed decision making, whereas poor or inaccurate met-
rics lead to bad management decisions.
●
●
Good metrics can assess performance accurately.
●
●
Metrics allow for proactive management in a timely manner.
●
●
Metrics improve future estimating.
●
●
Metrics improve performance for the future.
●
●
Metrics make it easier to validate baselines and maintain the baselines with mini-
mal disruptions.
●
●
Metrics can more accurately assess success and failure.
●
●
Metrics can improve client satisfaction.
●
●
Metrics are a means of assessing the project’s health.
●
●
Metrics track the ability to meet the project’s critical success factors.
●
●
Good metrics allow the definition of project success to be made in terms of factors 
other than the traditional triple constraints.
While metrics are most frequently used to validate the health of a project, they can 
also be used to discover best practices in the processes. Capturing best practices and les-
sons learned are necessities for long-term continuous improvement. Without effective use 
of metrics, companies could spend years trying to achieve sustained improvements. In this 
regard, metrics are a necessity because:
●
●
Project approvals are often based upon insufficient information and poor estimating.
●
●
Project approvals are based upon unrealistic return on investment (ROI), net pre-
sent value (NPV), and payback period calculations.
●
●
Project approvals are often based upon a best-case scenario.
●
●
The true time and cost requirements may be either hidden or not fully understood 
during the project approval process.
Metrics require a need or purpose, a target, baseline, or reference point, a means of 
measurement, a means of interpretation, and a reporting structure. Even with good metrics, 
metrics management can fail. The most common causes of failure are:
●
●
Poor governance, especially by stakeholders
●
●
Slow decision-making processes
●
●
Overly optimistic project plans

●
●
Trying to accomplish too much in too little time
●
●
Poor project management practices and/or methodology
●
●
Poor understanding of how the metrics will be used
During the past few years, one of the drivers for effective metrics management has 
been the growth in complex projects. The larger and more complex the project is, the 
greater the difficulty in measuring and determining success. Therefore, the larger and more 
complex the project is, the greater the need for metrics.
Identifying Metrics
Unlike business environments, which are long term, project environ-
ments are much shorter and therefore more susceptible to changing 
metrics. In a project environment, metrics can change from project to project, during each 
life-cycle phase, and at any time because of:
●
●
The way the company defines value internally
●
●
The way the customer and the contractor jointly define success and value at project 
initiation
●
●
The way the customer and contractor come to an agreement at project initiation as 
to what metrics should be used on a given project
●
●
New or updated versions of tracking software
●
●
Improvements to the enterprise project management methodology and accompa-
nying project management information system
●
●
Changes in the enterprise environmental factors
●
●
Changes in the project’s business case assumptions
Metrics can be classified. As an example, below are seven types of metrics or metric 
indicators that could appear in a metrics library:
●
●
Quantitative metrics (planning dollars or hours as a percentage of total labor)
●
●
Practical metrics (improved efficiencies)
●
●
Directional metrics (risk ratings getting better or worse)
●
●
Actionable metrics (affect change as the number of unstaffed hours)
●
●
Financial metrics (profit margins, ROI, etc.)
●
●
Milestone metrics (number of work packages on time)
●
●
End result or success metrics (customer satisfaction)
Finding a compromise on the correct number of metrics is not easy, but we must deter-
mine how many metrics are needed for a particular project.
●
●
With too many metrics:
●
●
Metric management steals time from other work.
●
●
We end up providing too much information to stakeholders such that they can-
not determine what information is critical.
●
●
We end up providing information that has limited value.
Project Metrics
553

554
Metrics 
●
●
With too few metrics:
●
●
Not enough critical information is provided.
●
●
Informed decision making becomes difficult.
There are certain ground rules we can establish as part of the metric selection process:
●
●
Make sure that the metrics are worth collecting.
●
●
Make sure that we use what we collect.
●
●
Make sure that the metrics are informative.
●
●
Train the team in the use and value of metrics.
Selecting metrics is a lot easier when you have competent baselines from which to 
make measurements. It is very difficult or even impossible to use metrics management 
effectively when the baselines undergo continuous transformation. For work that has not 
been planned yet, benchmarks and standards can be used instead of baselines.
Metrics by themselves are just numbers or trends resulting from measurements. Met-
rics have no real value unless they can be properly interpreted by the stakeholders or sub-
ject matter experts and a corrective plan, if necessary, can be developed. It is important 
to know who will benefit from each metric. The level of importance can vary from stake-
holder to stakeholder.
There are several questions that can be addressed during metric selection:
●
●
How knowledgeable are the stakeholders in project management?
●
●
How knowledgeable are the stakeholders in metrics management?
●
●
Do we have the necessary organizational process assets for metric measurements?
●
●
Will the baselines and standards undergo transformations during the project?
There are two additional factors that must be considered when selecting metrics. First, 
there is a cost involved in performing the measurements and, based upon the frequency of 
the measurements, the costs can be quite large. Second, we must recognize that metrics 
needed to be updated. Metrics are like best practices; they age and may no longer provide 
the value or information that was expected. There are several reasons therefore for periodi-
cally reviewing the metrics:
●
●
Customers may desire real-time reporting rather than periodic reporting, thus 
making some metrics inappropriate.
●
●
The cost and complexity of the measurement may make a metric inappropriate 
for use.
●
●
The metric does not fit well with the organizational process assets available for an 
accurate measurement.
●
●
Project funding limits may restrict the number of metrics that can be used.
In reviewing the metrics, there are three possible outcomes:
●
●
Update the metric.
●
●
Leave the metric as is but possibly put it on hold.
●
●
Retire the metric from use.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIS)
555
Finally, metrics should be determined after the project is selected and approval is 
obtained. Selecting a project based upon available or easy-to-use metrics often results in 
either the selection of the wrong project or metrics that provide useless data.
15.4 KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS (KPIs)
Part of the project manager’s role is to understand what the critical metrics are that need 
to be identified, measured, reported, and managed such that the project will be viewed as 
a success by all of the stakeholders, if possible. The term “metric” is generic whereas a 
“KPI” is specific. KPIs serve as early warning signs that, if an unfavorable condition exists 
and is not addressed, the results could be poor. KPIs and metrics can be displayed in dash-
boards, scorecards, and reports.
Defining the correct metrics or KPIs is a joint venture between the project manager, 
client, and stakeholders and is necessary in order to get stakeholder agreement. One of the 
keys to a successful project is the effective and timely management of information. This 
includes the KPIs. KPIs give us information for making informed decisions by reducing 
uncertainty.
Getting stakeholder agreement on the KPIs is difficult. If you provide the stakeholders 
with fifty metrics to select from, they will somehow justify the need for all fifty of them. 
If you show them one hundred metrics, they will find a reason why all one hundred should 
be reported. The hard part is to select from the metrics library those critical metrics which 
can function as KPIs.
For years, metrics and KPIs were used primarily as part of business intelligence tech-
niques. When applied to projects, KPIs answer the question, “What is really important for 
different stakeholders to monitor on the project?” In business, once a KPI is established, it 
becomes difficult to change as enterprise environmental factors change for fear that histori-
cal comparison data will be lost. But benchmarking industry KPIs is still possible because 
the KPIs are long term. In project management, because of the uniqueness of projects, 
benchmarking is more complex because of the relatively short life span of the KPIs.
Need for KPIs
KPIs are high-level snapshots of how a project is progressing toward 
predefined targets. Some people confuse a KPI with leading indicators. 
A leading indicator is actually a KPI that measures how the work you are doing now will 
affect the future. KPIs can be treated as indicators but not necessarily leading indicators.
While some metrics may appear as leading indicators, care must be taken as to how 
they are interpreted. The misinterpretation of a metric or the mistaken belief that a metric 
is a leading indicator can lead to faulty conclusions.
KPIs are critical components of all earned-value measurement systems. Terms such 
as cost variance, schedule variance, schedule performance index, cost performance index, 
and time/cost at completion are actually KPIs if used correctly but not always referred to 
as such. The need for these KPIs is simple: What gets measured gets done! If the goal of a 
performance measurement system is to improve efficiency and effectiveness, then the KPI 
must reflect controllable factors. There is no point in measuring an activity if the users can-
not change the outcome.

556
Metrics 
Typical KPIs that project managers may use include:
●
●
Percent of work packages adhering to the schedule
●
●
Percent of work packages adhering to the budget
●
●
Number of assigned resources versus planned resources
●
●
Percent of actual versus planned baselines completed to date
●
●
Percent of actual versus planned best practices used
●
●
Project complexity factor
●
●
Time to achieve value
●
●
Customer satisfaction ratings
●
●
Number of critical assumptions made
●
●
Percent of critical assumptions that have changed
●
●
Number of cost revisions
●
●
Number of schedule revisions
●
●
Number of scope change review meetings
●
●
Number of critical constraints
●
●
Percent of work packages with a critical risk designation
●
●
Net operating margins
●
●
Grade levels of assigned resources versus planned resources
Project managers must explain to the stakeholders the differences between metrics and 
KPIs and why only the KPIs should be reported on dashboards. As an example, metrics 
focus on the completion of work packages, achievement of milestones, and accomplish-
ment of performance objectives. KPIs focus on future outcomes and this is the information 
stakeholders need for decision making. Neither metrics nor KPIs can truly predict that 
the project will be successful, but KPIs provide more accurate information on what might 
happen in the future if the existing trends continue. Both metrics and KPIs provide useful 
information, but neither can tell you what action to take or whether a distressed project can 
be recovered.
Once the stakeholders understand the need for correct KPIs, other questions must be 
discussed, including:
●
●
How many KPIs are needed?
●
●
How often should they be measured?
●
●
What should be measured?
●
●
How complex will the KPI become?
●
●
Who will be accountable for the KPI (i.e., the KPI owner)?
●
●
Will the KPI serve as a benchmark?
We stated previously that what gets measured gets done, and it is through measurement 
that a true understanding of the information is obtained. If the goal of a metric measure-
ment system is to improve efficiency and effectiveness, then the KPI must reflect control-
lable factors. There is no point in measuring an activity or a KPI if the users cannot change 
the outcome. Such KPIs would not be acceptable to stakeholders.

Although most companies use metrics and perform measurement, they 
seem to have a poor understanding of what constitutes a KPI for pro-
jects and how they should be used. Some general principles include:
●
●
KPIs are agreed to beforehand and reflect the CSFs on the project.
●
●
KPIs indicate how much progress has been made toward the achievement of the 
project’s targets, goals, and objectives.
●
●
KPIs are not performance targets.
●
●
The ultimate purpose of a KPI is the measurement of items directly relevant to 
performance and to provide information on controllable factors appropriate for 
decision making such that it will lead to positive outcomes.
●
●
Good KPIs drive change but do not prescribe a course of action. They indicate how 
close you are to a target but do not tell you what must be done to correct deviations 
from the target.
●
●
KPIs assist in the establishment of objectives to be targeted with the ultimate pur-
pose of either adding value to the project or achieving the prescribed value.
Some people argue that the high-level purposes of a KPI are to encourage effective 
measurement. In this regard, the three high-level purposes are:
●
●
Measurements that lead to motivation of the team
●
●
Measurements that lead to compliance with use of organizational process assets 
and alignment to business objectives
●
●
Measurements that lead to performance improvements and the capturing of les-
sons learned and best practices
Using the KPIs
Anatomy of a KPI
Some metrics, such as project profitability, can tell us if things look 
good or bad but do not necessarily provide meaningful information on 
what we must do to improve performance. Therefore, a typical KPI must do more than just 
function as a metric. If we dissect the KPIs we will see the following:
●
●
KEY = a major contributor to the success or failure of the project. A KPI metric is 
therefore only “key” when it can make or break the project.
●
●
PERFORMANCE = a metric that can be measured, quantified, adjusted, and con-
trolled. The metric must be controllable to improve performance.
●
●
INDICATOR = reasonable representation of present and future performance.
A KPI is part of a measurable objective. Defining and selecting the KPIs are much 
easier if you define the CSFs first. KPIs should not be confused with CSFs. CSFs are things 
that must be in place to achieve an objective. A KPI is not a CSF but may provide a leading 
indication that the CSF can be met.
Selecting the right KPIs and the right number of KPIs will:
●
●
Allow for better decision making
●
●
Improve performance on the project
●
●
Help identify problem areas faster
●
●
Improve customer–contractor–stakeholder relations
Key Performance Indicators (KPIS)

558
Metrics 
David Parmenter2 defines three categories of metrics:
●
●
Results Indicators (RIs): what have we accomplished?
●
●
Performance Indicators (PIs): what must we do to increase or meet performance?
●
●
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): what are the critical performance indicators 
that can drastically increase performance or accomplishment of the objectives?
The number of KPIs can vary from project to project and may be impacted by the 
number of stakeholders. Some people select the number of KPIs based upon the Pareto 
principle, which states that 20 percent of the total indicators will impact 80 percent of the 
project. David Parmenter states that the 10/80/10 rule is usually applied when selecting the 
number of KPIs3:
●
●
RIs: 10
●
●
PIs: 80
●
●
KPIs: 10
Typically, between six and ten KPIs are standard. Factors influencing the number of 
KPIs include:
●
●
The number of information systems that the project manager uses (i.e., one, two, 
or three)
●
●
The number of stakeholders and their reporting requirements
●
●
The ability to measure the information
●
●
The organizational process assets available to collect the information
●
●
The cost of measurement and collection
●
●
Dashboard reporting limitations

KPI Characteristics
The literature abounds with articles defining the characteristics of met-
rics and KPIs. All too often, authors use the “SMART” rule as a means 
of identifying the characteristics:
●
●
S = Specific: clear and focused toward performance targets or a business purpose
●
●
M = Measurable: can be expressed quantitatively
●
●
A = Attainable: the targets are reasonable and achievable
●
●
R = Realistic or relevant: the KPI is directly pertinent to the work done on the 
project
●
●
T = Time-based: the KPI is measurable within a given time period
The SMART rule was originally developed for establishing meaningful objectives for 
projects and later adapted to the identification of metrics and KPIs. While the use of the 
SMART rule does have some merit, its applicability to KPIs is questionable.

The most important attribute of a KPI may be that it is actionable. If the trend of the 
metric is unfavorable, then the users should know what action is necessary to correct the 
unfavorable trend. The user must be able to control the outcome. This is a weakness when 
using the SMART rule to select KPIs.
Wayne Eckerson has developed a more sophisticated set of characteristics for KPIs. 
The list is more appropriate for business-oriented KPIs than project-oriented KPIs  
but can be adapted for project management usage. Table 15–1 shows Eckerson’s twelve 
characteristics.4
Business or financial metrics are usually the results of many factors, and it therefore 
may be difficult to isolate what must be done to implement change. For project-oriented 
KPIs, the following six characteristics may very well be sufficient:
●
●
Predictive: able to predict the future of this trend
●
●
Measurable: can be expressed quantitatively
●
●
Actionable: triggers changes that may be necessary for corrective action
●
●
Relevant: the KPI is directly related to the success or failure of the project
Table 15–1.  Twelve Characteristic of Effective KPIs
Aligned
KPIs are always aligned with corporate strategy and objectives.
Owned
Every KPI is “owned” by an individual or group on the business side who is 
accountable for its outcome.
Predictive
KPIs measure drivers of business value. Thus, they are “leading” indicators 
of performance desired by the organization.
Actionable
PIs are populated with timely, actionable data so users can intervene to 
improve performance before it is too late.
Few in number
KPIs should focus users on a few high-value tasks, not scatter their attention 
and energy on too many things.
Easy to understand
KPIs should be straightforward and easy to understand, not based on 
complex indexes that users do not know how to influence directly.
Balanced and linked
KPIs should balance and reinforce each other, not undermine each other and 
suboptimize processes.
Trigger changes
The act of measuring a KPI should trigger a chain reaction of positive 
changes in the organization, especially when it is monitored by the CEO.
Standardized
KPIs are based on standard definitions, rules, and calculations so they can be 
integrated across dashboards throughout the organization.
Context driven
KPIs put performance in context by applying targets and thresholds to 
performance so users can gauge their progress over time.
Reinforced with incentives
Organizations can magnify the impact of KPIs by attaching compensation 
or incentives to them. However, they should do this cautiously, applying 
incentives only to well-understood and stable KPIs.
Relevant
KPIs gradually lose their impact over time, so they must be periodically 
reviewed and refreshed.

Metrics 
●
●
Automated: reporting minimizes the chance of human error
●
●
Few in number: only what is necessary
Sometimes KPIs are categorized according to what they are intended to indicate, simi-
lar to the metrics categories discussed in the previous section:
●
●
Quantitative KPIs: numerical values
●
●
Practical KPIs: interfacing with company processes
●
●
Directional KPIs: getting better or worse
●
●
Actionable KPIs: effect change
●
●
Financial KPIs: performance measurements
Another means of classification might be leading or lagging indicators or KPIs:
●
●
Lagging KPIs measure past performance.
●
●
Leading KPIs measure drivers for future performance.
Most dashboards have a compromise of both leading and lagging metrics.
KPI Failures
There are several reasons why the use of KPIs often fails on projects. 
Some of the reasons are:
●
●
People believe that the tracking of a KPI ends at the first line manager level.
●
●
The actions needed to regulate unfavorable indications are beyond the control of 
the employees doing the monitoring or tracking.
●
●
The KPIs are not related to the actions or work of the employees doing the 
monitoring.
●
●
The rate of change of the KPIs is too slow, thus making them unsuitable for man-
aging the daily work of the employees.
●
●
Actions needed to correct unfavorable KPIs take too long.
●
●
Measurement of the KPIs does not provide enough meaning or data to make them 
useful.
●
●
The company identifies too many KPIs to the point where confusion reigns among 
the people doing the measurements.
Years ago, the only metrics that some companies used were those identified as part of 
the earned-value measurement system. The metrics generally focused only on time and cost 
and neglected metrics related to business success as opposed to project success. Thus, the 
measurement metrics were the same on each project and the same for each life-cycle phase. 
Today, metrics can change from phase to phase and from project to project. The hard part 
is obviously deciding upon which metrics to use. Care must be taken that whatever metrics 
are established does not end up comparing apples and oranges. Fortunately, there are several 
good books in the marketplace that can assist in identifying proper or meaningful metrics.5
5.  Three books that provide examples of metric identification are P. F. Rad and G. Levin, Metrics for Project 
Management (Vienna, VA: Management Concepts, 2006); M. Schnapper and S. Rollins, Value-Based Metric for 
Improving Results (Fort Lauderdale, FL: J. Ross Publishing, 2006); and D. W. Hubbard, How to Measure Any-
thing, 3rd ed. (Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons, 2014).

Value-Based Metrics
561
15.5 VALUE-BASED METRICS
For years, customers and contractors have been working toward different definitions of 
project success. The project manager’s definition of success was profitability and tracked 
through financial metrics. The customer’s definition of success was usually the quality of 
the deliverables. Unfortunately, quality was measured at the closure of the project because 
it was difficult to track throughout the project. Yet quality was often considered the only 
measurement of success.
Today, clients and stakeholders appear to be more interested in the value they will 
receive at the end of the project. If you were to ask ten people, including project person-
nel, the meaning of value, you would probably get ten different answers. Likewise, if you 
were to ask which CSF has the greatest impact on value, you would get different answers. 
Each answer would be related to the individual’s work environment and industry. Today, 
companies seem to have more of an interest in value than quality. This does not mean that 
we are giving up on quality. Quality is part of value. Some people believe that value is simply 
quality divided by the cost of obtaining that quality. In other words, the less you pay for 
obtaining the customer’s desired level of quality, the greater the value to the customer.
The problem with this argument is that we assume that quality is the only attribute of 
value that is important to the client and therefore we need to determine better ways of measur-
ing and predicting just quality. Unfortunately, there are other attributes of value and many of 
these other attributes are equally as difficult to measure and predict. Customers can have many 
attributes that they consider as value, but not all of the value attributes are equal in importance.
Unlike the use of quality as the solitary parameter, value allows a company to better 
measure the degree to which the project will satisfy its objectives. Quality can be regarded 
as an attribute of value along with other attributes. Today, everyone has quality and produces 
quality in some form. This is necessary for survival. But what differentiates one company from 
another are the other attributes, components, or factors used to define value. Some of these 
attributes might include price, timing, image, reputation, customer service, and sustainability.
In today’s world, customers make decisions to hire a contractor based upon the value 
they expect to receive and the price they must pay to receive this value. Actually it is more 
of a “perceived” value that may be based upon trade-offs on the attributes of the client’s 
definition of value. The client may perceive the value of your project to be used internally 
in their company or pass it on to their customers through their customer value management 
program. If your organization does not or cannot offer recognized value to your clients and 
stakeholders, then you will not be able to extract value (i.e., loyalty) from them in return. 
Over time, they will defect to other contractors.
As a project manager, you must establish metrics so that the client and the stakehold-
ers can track the value that you will be creating. Measuring and reporting customer value 
throughout the project is now a competitive necessity. If it is done correctly, it will build 
emotional bonds with your clients.
For years, the principles of value management have been applied to engineering and 
manufacturing activities, but only recently have the same principles been applied to project 
management. According to Venkataraman and Pinto:6

John Wiley & Sons, 2008), pp.164–165.

Metrics 
Value can be added to projects in several ways. These include providing greater levels of 
client satisfaction, maintaining acceptable levels of satisfaction while lowering resource 
expenditures, or some combination of the two. It is also possible to improve value by 
simultaneously increasing satisfaction and resources, provided that satisfaction increases 
more than the resources used to achieve it.
When managing projects for value, five fundamental concepts must be embraced:
Concept #1: Projects derive their value from the benefits the organization accrues by 
achieving its stated goals
Concept #2: Project can be viewed as investments made by management
Concept #3: Project investors and sponsors tolerate risk
Concept #4: Project value is related to investment and risks
Concept #5: Value is a balance among the three key project elements: performance, 
resource usage, and risk
Traditionally, business plans have identified the benefits and resulting value expected 
from the project. The business plans were usually prepared by a business analyst (BA), 
and all of this was done prior to the project manager being assigned and brought on board 
the project. Unfortunately, once the project kicked off, the metrics being monitored and 
reported generally focused on time and cost rather than the value that the customer was 
or would be receiving. Value-based metrics were not reported because we simply did not 
know how to perform the measurements.
Today, we can define a project as a collection of value scheduled for realization. The 
role of the BA and the PM are now coming together. As stated by Robert Wisocki:7
Meeting time and cost constraints has very little to do with project success. Project success 
is measured in terms of business value expected compared to business value delivered. 
Both the PM and the BA should be making every effort to maximize business value for the 
time and cost invested. This puts the goals of the PM and the BA in alignment.
We can now define project success as the ability to achieve the desired value within the 
competing constraints imposed upon the project.
Today, with the growth of measurement management techniques, value-based met-
rics are a necessity for determining project success and are being considered as critical 
KPIs to be monitored and reported to the client. One contractor reports to their client 
on a monthly basis the amount of time left before the client will achieve the value that 
is expected, and the date may be beyond the end date of the project. However, many of 
the value-based metrics are still considered as a measurement challenge, as shown in 
Table 15–2.
Not all metrics are value-based metrics, and the metrics can change from project to 
project as well as in each life-cycle phase. Time and cost can be treated as value-based met-
rics if coming in under budget can increase profitability and coming in ahead of schedule 
allows us to enter the marketplace sooner to generate revenue.
7.  R. K. Wysocki, The Business Analyst/Project Manager (Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons, 2011), p. 2. The 
author provided an excellent discussion of the relationship between the PM and the BA.

Even with the best possible metrics, measuring value can be difficult. Some values are 
easy to measure while others are more difficult. The easy values to measure are often called 
soft or tangible values whereas the hard values are often considered as intangible values. 
Table 15–3 illustrates some of the easy and hard value metrics to measure. Table 15–4 
shows some of the problems associated with measuring both hard and soft value metrics.

Metrics 
The intangible elements or metrics are now considered by some to be 
more important than the tangible elements. This appears to be happen-
ing on IT projects where executives are giving significantly more attention to intangible 
value metrics. The critical issue with intangible value metrics is not necessarily in the 
end result, but in the way that the intangibles were calculated.8 Tangible values are usu-
ally expressed quantitatively, whereas intangible values are expressed through a qualitative 
assessment.
There are three schools of thought for value measurement:
●
●
School 1: The only thing that is important is ROI.
●
●
School 2: ROI can never be calculated effectively; only the intangibles are  
important.
●
●
School 3: If you cannot measure it, then it does not matter.
The three schools of thought appear to be an all-or-nothing approach, where value is 
either 100 percent quantitative or 100 percent qualitative. The best approach is most likely 
a compromise between a quantitative and qualitative assessment of value.
The timing of value measurement is absolutely critical. During the life cycle of a pro-
ject, it may be necessary to switch back and forth from qualitative to quantitative assess-
ment and, as stated previously, the actual metrics or KPIs can change as well. Certain 
critical questions must be addressed:
●
●
When or how far along the project life cycle can we establish concrete metrics, 
assuming it can be done at all?
●
●
Can value be simply perceived and therefore no value metrics are required?
●
●
Even if we have value metrics, are they concrete enough to reasonably predict 
actual value?
●
●
Will we be forced to use value-driven project management on all projects or are 
there some projects where this approach is not necessary?
●
●
Well-defined versus ill-defined
●
●
Strategic versus tactical
●
●
Internal versus external
●
●
Can we develop a criterion for when to use value-driven project management, or 
should we use it on all projects but at a lower intensity level?
For some projects, assessing value at project closure may be difficult. We must estab-
lish a time frame for how long we are willing to wait to measure the value or benefits from 
a project. This is particularly important if the actual value cannot be identified until some-
time after the project has been completed. Therefore, it may not be possible to appraise the 
success of a project at closure if the true economic values cannot be realized until sometime 
in the future.
Value Measurement
8.  For additional information on the complexities of measuring intangibles, see J. J. Phillips, T. W. Bothell, and 
G. L. Snead, The Project Management Scorecard (Butterworth Heinemann, An Imprint of Elsevier, Oxford, UK, 
2002), Chapter 10. The authors emphasize that the true impact on a business must be measured in business units.

Some practitioners of value measurement question whether value measurement is bet-
ter using boundary boxes instead of life-cycle phases. For value-driven projects, the poten-
tial problems with life-cycle phases include:
●
●
Metrics can change between phases and even during a phase.
●
●
Inability to account for changes in the enterprise environmental factors.
●
●
Focus may be on the value at the end of the phase rather than the value at the end 
of the project.
●
●
Team members may get frustrated not being able to quantitatively calculate value.
Boundary boxes, as show in Figure 15–1, have some degree of similarity to statistical 
process control charts. We establish a performance target for the value metric. The goal is 
to stay between 6 and 10 percent of the optimal value. If we are greater than 10 percent 
above the optimal value, we are exceeding the expected value. If we are below 10 percent 
of the target value, performance is poor. If we are greater than 20 percent below the target 
value, urgent attention is needed.
Projects that focus heavily upon value-based metrics must undergo value health checks 
to confirm that the project will make a contribution of value to the company. Value metrics, 
such as KPIs, indicate the current value. What is also needed is an extrapolation of the 
present into the future. Using traditional project management combined with the traditional 
enterprise project management methodology we can calculate the time at completion and 
the cost at completion. These are common terms that are part of earned-value measurement 
systems. But as stated previously, being on time and within budget is no guarantee that the 
perceived value will be there at project completion.
Therefore, instead of using an enterprise project management methodology which 
focuses on earned-value measurement, we may need to create a value management meth-
odology (VMM) which stresses the value variables. With VMM, time to complete and 
cost to complete are still used, but we introduce a new term entitled value (or benefits) at 
completion. Determination of value at completion must be done periodically throughout

the project. However, periodic reevaluation of benefits and value at completion may be 
difficult because:
●
●
There may be no reexamination process.
●
●
Management is not committed and believes that the reexamination process is 
unreal.
●
●
Management is overoptimistic and complacent with existing performance.
●
●
Management is blinded by unusually high profits on other projects (misinterpreta-
tion).
●
●
Management believes that the past is an indication of the future.
An assessment of value at completion can tell us if value trade-offs are necessary. 
Reasons for value trade-offs include:
●
●
Changes in the enterprise environmental factors
●
●
Changes in the assumptions
●
●
Better approaches have been found, possibly with less risk
●
●
Availability of highly skilled labor
●
●
A breakthrough in technology
Traditional tools and techniques may not work well on value-driven projects. The crea-
tion of a VMM may be necessary to achieve the desired results. A VMM can include the 
features of EVMSs and enterprise project management systems (EPMs), but additional 
variables must be included for the capturing, measurement, and reporting of value.
15.6 DASHBOARDS AND SCORECARDS
In our attempt to go to paperless project management, emphasis is being given to visual 
displays such as dashboards and scorecards. Executives and customers desire a visual dis-
play of the most critical project performance information in the least amount of space. Sim-
ple dashboard techniques, such as traffic light reporting, can convey critical performance 
information. As an example,
●
●
Red traffic light: A problem exists which may affect time, cost, quality, or scope. 
Sponsorship involvement is necessary.
●
●
Yellow or amber light: This is a caution. A potential problem may exist, perhaps in 
the future if not monitored. The sponsor is informed but no action by the sponsor 
is necessary at this time.
●
●
Green light: Work is progressing as planned. No involvement by the sponsor is 
necessary.
While a traffic light dashboard with just three colors is most common, some compa-
nies use many more colors. The IT group of a retailer had an eight-color dashboard for IT 

Dashboards and Scorecards

projects. Amber meant that the targeted end date had passed and the project was still not 
complete. Purple meant that this work package was undergoing a scope change that could 
have an impact on the triple constraint.
Some people confuse dashboards with scorecards, but there is a difference. According 
to Eckerson:9
●
●
Dashboards are visual display mechanisms used in an operationally oriented 
performance measurement system that measure performance against targets and 
thresholds using right-time data.
●
●
Scorecards are visual displays used in a strategically oriented performance meas-
urement system that chart progress towards achieving strategic goals and objec-
tives by comparing performance against targets and thresholds.
Both dashboards and scorecards are visual display mechanisms within a performance 
measurement system that convey critical information. The primary difference between 
dashboards and scorecards is that dashboards monitor operational processes such as those 
used in project management, whereas scorecards chart the progress of tactical goals. 
Table 15–5 and the description following it show how Eckerson compares the features of 
dashboards and scorecards.10
Dashboards. Dashboards are more like automobile dashboards. They let operational spe-
cialists and their supervisors monitor events generated by key business processes. But 
unlike automobiles, most business dashboards do not display events in “real time” as they 
occur; they display them in “right time” as users need to view them. This could be every 
second, minute, hour, day, week, or month depending on the business process, its volatility, 
and how critical it is to the business. However, most elements on a dashboard are updated 
on an intra-day basis, with latency measured in either minutes or hours.
Dashboards often display performance visually, using charts or simple graphs, such 
as gauges and meters. However, dashboard graphs are often updated in place, causing the 
graph to “flicker” or change dynamically. Ironically, people who monitor operational pro-
cesses often find the visual glitz distracting and prefer to view the data in its original form, 
as numbers or text, perhaps accompanied by visual graphs.
9.  See Eckerson, Performance Dashboards, pp. 293, 295. Chapter 12 provides an excellent approach to designing 
dashboard screens.

Scorecards. Scorecards, on the other hand, look more like performance charts used to 
track progress toward achieving goals. Scorecards usually display monthly snapshots of 
summarized data for business executives who track strategic and long-term objectives, or 
daily and weekly snapshots of data for managers who need to chart the progress of their 
group of project toward achieving goals. In both cases, the data are fairly summarized so 
users can view their performance status at a glance.
Like dashboards, scorecards also make use of charts and visual graphs to indicate 
performance state, trends, and variance against goals. The higher up the users are in the 
organization, the more they prefer to see performance encoded visually. However, most 
scorecards also contain (or should contain) a great deal of textual commentary that inter-
prets performance results, describes action taken, and forecasts future results.
Summary. In the end, it does not really matter whether you use the term dashboard or 
scorecard as long as the tool helps to focus users and organizations on what really matters. 
Both dashboards and scorecards need to display critical performance information on a 
single screen so users can monitor results at a glance.
Although the terms are used interchangeably, most project managers prefer to use 
dashboards and/or dashboard reporting. Eckerson defines three types of dashboards as 
shown in Table 15–6 and the description that follows:11
Operational dashboards monitor core operational processes and are used primarily by 
frontline workers and their supervisors who deal directly with customers or manage the 
creation or delivery of organizational products and services. Operational dashboards pri-
marily deliver detailed information that is only lightly summarized. For example, an online 
Web merchant may track transactions at the product level rather than the customer level. 
In addition, most metrics in an operational dashboard are updated on an intra-day basis, 
ranging from minutes to hours depending on the application. As a result, operational dash-
boards emphasize monitoring more than analysis and management.
Tactical dashboards track departmental processes and projects that are of interest to a 
segment of the organization or a limited group of people. Managers and business analysts 
use tactical dashboards to compare performance of their areas or projects, to budget plans, 
forecasts, or last period’s results. For example, a project to reduce the number of errors in a 
customer database might use a tactical dashboard to display, monitor and analyze progress

during the previous 12 months toward achieving 99.9 percent defect-free customer data 
by 2007.
Strategic dashboards monitor the execution of strategic objectives and are frequently 
implemented using a Balanced Scorecard approach, although Total Quality Management, 
Six Sigma, and other methodologies are used as well. The goal of a strategic dashboard is 
to align the organization around strategic objectives and get every group marching in the 
same direction. To do this, organizations roll out customized scorecards to every group in 
the organization and sometimes to every individual as well. These “cascading” scorecards, 
which are usually updated weekly or monthly, give executives a powerful tool to commu-
nicate strategy, gain visibility into operations, and identify the key drivers of performance 
and business value. Strategic dashboards emphasize management more than monitoring 
and analysis.
There are three critical steps that must be considered when using dashboards: (1) the 
target audience for the dashboard, (2) the type of dashboard to be used, and (3) the fre-
quency in which the data will be updated. In some companies, there is a fourth step that 
includes security of the intellectual property on the dashboard. Some project dashboards 
focus on the key performance indicators that are part of earned-value measurement. These 
dashboards may need to be updated daily or weekly. Dashboards related to the financial 
health of the company may be updated weekly or quarterly.
15.7 BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE
Corporations have been using the concept of business intelligence (BI) for more than two 
decades. In recent years, business intelligence applications have been replaced by strategic 
intelligence (SI) applications. Both applications are designed around the monitoring and 
surveillance of business metrics. According to Corine Cohen:12
The general surveillance field covers notions of watch, scanning, intelligence, competitive 
intelligence, vigilance, business intelligence, economic intelligence, economic and strate-
gic intelligence, etc. . . .
SI is defined here as a formalized process of research, collection, information process-
ing and distribution of knowledge useful to strategic management. Besides its information 
function, the main goals of SI are to anticipate environmental threats and opportunities 
(anticipatory function), help in strategic decision making and improve competitiveness 
and performance of the organization. It requires an organizational network structure, and 
human technical and financial resources.
A distinction must therefore be made between Strategic Watch and SI. SI goes beyond 
Strategic Watch with its proactivity and its deeper involvement in the strategic decision 
process. Watch can (must) indicate the impacts of a detected event for example. However, 
it becomes intelligence when it produces recommendations and provides instructions to the 
recipient (all the more so when it implements them).
12.  C. Cohen, Business Intelligence (Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons and ISTE Ltd Publishers, 2009), p. xiii.

570
Metrics 
BI and SI applications have taught us that the way we try to monitor and control projects 
must change. In a project management environment, BI would be represented by metrics and 
SI would be represented by key performance indicators (KPIs). Key performance indicators 
are the “strategic” metrics that provide us with the critical information for informed deci-
sion making. BI metrics are simply monitoring metrics whereas SI metrics, or KPIs, provide 
information on the future rather than just the present and indicate changes that may be nec-
essary. Since project managers today and in the future will become more business-oriented 
managers, the relationship between metrics and BI and SI will become more important.

16.0 INTRODUCTION
Successful project management is both an art and a science and attempts to control corporate resources 
within the constraints of time, cost, and performance. Most projects are unique, one-of-kind activities for 
which there may not have been reasonable standards for forward planning. As a result, the project manager 
may find it extremely difficult to stay within the time–cost–performance triangle of Figure 16–1. Even 
though today we focus on competing constraints, the trade-offs in this section will focus heavily upon just 
time, cost, and performance.
The time–cost–performance triangle is the “magic combination” that is continuously pursued by the 
project manager throughout the life cycle of the project. If the project were to flow smoothly, according to 
plan, there might not be a need for trade-off analysis. Unfortunately, this rarely happens. The situation will 
become even more complex as we add in more constraints and metrics. But for simplicity’s sake, only time, 
cost, and performance will be considered in this chapter.
Trade-offs are illustrated in Figure 16–2, where the Ds represent deviations from the original estimates. 
The time and cost deviations are normally overruns, whereas the performance error will be an underrun. 
No two projects are exactly alike, and trade-off analysis will be an ongoing effort throughout the life of the 
project, continuously influenced by both the internal and the external environment. Experienced project 
managers have predetermined trade-offs in reserve, recognizing that trade-offs are part of a continuous 
thought process.
Trade-offs are always based on the constraints of the project. Table 16–1 illustrates the types of con-
straints commonly imposed. Situations A and B are the typical trade-offs encountered in project manage-
ment. For example, situation A-3 portrays most research and development projects. The performance of 
an R&D project is usually well defined, and it is cost and time that may be allowed to go beyond budget 
and schedule. The determination of what to sacrifice is based on the available alternatives. If there are

no alternatives to the product being developed and the potential usage is great, then cost and time are the 
trade-offs.
Most capital equipment projects would fall into situation A-1 or B-2, where time is of the essence. 
The sooner the piece of equipment gets into production, the sooner the return of investment can be real-
ized. Often there are performance constraints that determine the profit potential of the project. If the project 
potential is determined to be great, cost will be the slippage factor, as in situation B-2.
Non–process-type equipment, such as air pollution control equipment, usually develops a scenario 
around situation B-3. Performance is fixed by the Environmental Protection Agency. The deadline for com-
pliance can be delayed through litigation, but if the lawsuits fail, most firms then try to comply with the least 
expensive equipment that will meet the minimum requirements.
The professional consulting firm operates primarily under situation B-1. In situation C, the trade-off 
analysis will be completed based on the selection criteria and constraints. If everything is fixed (C-1), there 
is no room for any outcome other than total success, and if everything is variable (C-2), there are no con-
straints and thus no trade-off.
Many factors go into the decision to sacrifice either time, cost, or performance. It should be noted, 
however, that it is not always possible to sacrifice one of these items without affecting the others. For 
example, reducing the time could have a serious impact on performance and cost (especially if overtime 
is required).
There are several factors, such as those shown in Figure 16–3, that tend to “force” trade-offs. Poorly 
written documents (e.g., statements of work, contracts, and specifications) are almost always inward 
forces for conflict in which the project manager tends to look for performance relief. In many projects, 
the initial sale and negotiation, as well as the specification writing, are done by highly technical people 
who are driven to create a monument rather than meet the operational needs of the customer. When the 
operating forces dominate outward from the project to the customer, project managers may tend to seek 
cost relief.

Trade-Off Analysis in a Project Environment 
16.1 METHODOLOGY FOR TRADE-OFF ANALYSIS
Any process for managing time, cost, and performance trade-offs 
should emphasize the systems approach to management by recog-
nizing that even the smallest change in a project or system could 
easily affect all of the Planning Process Group Triangle organiza-
tion’s systems. A typical systems model is shown in Figure 16–4. 
Because of this, it is often better to develop a process for decision-making/trade-off 
analysis rather than to maintain hard-and-fast rules on trade-offs. The following six steps 
may help:
1.	 Recognizing and understanding the basis for project conflicts
2.	 Reviewing the project objectives
3.	 Analyzing the project environment and status
4.	 Identifying the alternative courses of action
5.	 Analyzing and selecting the best alternative
6.	 Revising the project plan

Step 1: Recognizing Project Conflicts
The first step in any decision-making process must be recog-
nition and understanding of the conflict. Most projects have 
management cost and control systems that compare actual versus planned results, scru-
tinize the results through variance analyses, and provide status reports so that corrective 
action can be taken to resolve the problems. Project managers must carefully evaluate

information about project problems because it may not always be what it appears to be. 
Typical questions to ask are:
●
●
Is the information pertinent?
●
●
Is the information current?
●
●
Are the data complete?
●
●
Who has determined that this situation exists?
●
●
How does he know this information is correct?
●
●
If this information is true, what are the implications for the project?
The reason for this first step is to understand the cause of the conflict and the need for 
trade-offs. Most causes can be categorized as human errors or failures, uncertain problems, 
and totally unexpected problems, as shown below:
●
●
Human errors/failures
●
●
Impossible schedule commitments
●
●
Poor control of design changes
●
●
Poor project cost accounting
●
●
Machine failures
●
●

●
●
Failure to receive a critical input
●
●
Failure to receive anticipated approvals
●
●
Uncertain problems

●

Step 2: Reviewing Objectives
The second step in the decision-making process is a complete review of 
the project objectives as seen by the various participants in the projects, 
ranging from top management to project team members. These objectives and/or priorities 
were originally set after considering many environmental factors, some of which may have 
changed over the lifetime of the project.
The nature of these objectives will usually determine the degree of rigidity that has 
been established between time, cost, and performance. This may require reviewing project 
documentation, including:
●
●
Project objectives
●
●
Project integration into sponsor’s objectives and strategic plan
●
●
Statement of work
●
●
Schedule, cost, and performance specifications
●
●
Resources consumed and projected
Step 3: Analyzing Project Status
The third step is the analysis of the project environment and status, 
including a detailed measurement of the actual time, cost, and per-
formance results with the original or revised project plan. This step should not turn into a 
“witch hunt” but should focus on project results, problems, and roadblocks. Factors such 
as financial risk, potential follow-up contracts, the status of other projects, and relative 
competitive positions are just a few of the environmental factors that should be reviewed. 
Some companies have established policies toward trade-off analysis, such as “never com-
promise performance.” Even these policies, however, have been known to change when 
environmental factors add to the financial risk of the company. The following topics may 
be applicable under step 3:
●
●
Discuss the project with the project management office to:
●
●
Determine relative priorities for time, cost, and performance
●
●
Determine impact on firm’s profitability and strategic plan
●
●
Get a management assessment (even a hunch as to what the problems are)

●
●
If the project is a contract with an outside customer, meet with the customer’s pro-
ject manager to assess his views relative to project status and assess the customer’s 
priorities for time, cost, and performance.
●
●
Meet with the functional managers to determine their views on the problem and 
to gain an insight regarding their commitment to a successful project. Where does 
this project sit in their priority list?
●
●
Review in detail the status of each project work package. Obtain a clear and 
detailed appraisal by the responsible project office personnel as to:
●
●
Time to complete
●
●
Cost to complete
●
●
Work to complete
●
●
Review past data to assess credibility of cost and schedule information in the pre-
vious step.
The project manager may have sufficient background to quickly assess the signifi-
cance of a particular variance and the probable impact of that variance on project team 
performance. Knowledge of the project requirements (possibly gained with the assistance 
of the project sponsor) will usually help a project manager determine whether corrective 
action must be taken at all, or whether the project should simply be permitted to continue as 
originally conceived.
Whether or not immediate action is required, a quick analysis of why a potential prob-
lem has developed is in order. Obviously, it will not help to “cure the symptoms” if the “dis-
ease” itself is not remedied. The project manager must remain objective in such problem 
identification, since he himself is a key member of the project team and may be personally 
responsible for problems that are occurring. Suspect areas typically include:
●
●
Inadequate planning: Either planning was not done in sufficient detail or controls 
were not established to determine that the project is proceeding according to the 
approved plan.
●
●
Scope changes: Cost and schedule overruns are the normal result of scope changes 
that are permitted without formal incorporation in the project plan or increase in 
the resources authorized for the project.
●
●
Poor performance: Because of the high level of interdependencies that exist within 
any project team structure, unacceptable performance by one individual may 
quickly undermine the performance of the entire team.
●
●
Excess performance: Frequently an overzealous team member will unintention-
ally distort the planned balance between cost, schedule, and performance on the 
project.
●
●
Environmental restraints—particularly on projects involving “third-party approvals” 
or dependent on outside resources: Changes, delays, or nonperformance by parties 
outside the project team may have an adverse impact on the team performance.
Some projects appear to be out of tolerance when, in fact, they are not. For example, 
some construction projects are so front-loaded with costs that there appears to be a major 
discrepancy when one actually does not exist. The front-end loading of cost was planned for.

Trade-Off Analysis in a Project Environment 
The fourth step in the project trade-off process is to list alternative 
courses of action. This step usually means brainstorming the possible 
methods of completing the project by compromising some combination of time, cost, or 
performance. Hopefully, this step will refine these possible alternatives into the three or 
four most likely scenarios for project completion. At this point, some intuitive decision 
making may be required to keep the list of alternatives at a manageable level.
In order fully to identify the alternatives, the project manager must have specific 
answers to key questions involving time, cost, and performance:
●
●
Time
●   Is a time delay acceptable to the customer?
●   Will the time delay change the completion date for other pro-
jects and other customers?
●
●
What is the cause for the time delay?
●
●
Can resources be recommitted to meet the new schedule?
●
●
What will be the cost for the new schedule?
●
●
Will the increased time give us added improvement?
●
●
Will an extension of this project cause delays on other projects in the cus-
tomer’s house?
●
●
What will the customer’s response be?
●
●
Will the increased time change our learning curve?
●
●
Will this hurt our company’s ability to procure future contracts?
●
●
Cost
●
●
What is causing the cost overrun?
●
●
What can be done to reduce the remaining costs?
●
●
Will the customer accept an additional charge?
●
●
Should we absorb the extra cost?
●
●
Can we renegotiate the time or performance standards to stay within cost?
●
●
Are the budgeted costs for the remainder of the project accurate?
●
●
Will there be any net value gains for the increased funding?
●
●
Is this the only way to satisfy performance?
●
●
Will this hurt our company’s ability to procure future contracts?
●
●
Is this the only way to maintain the schedule?
●
●
Performance
●
●
Can the original specifications be met?
●
●
If not, at what cost can we guarantee compliance?
●
●
Are the specifications negotiable?
●
●
What are the advantages to the company and customer for specification changes?
●
●
What are the disadvantages to the company and customer for performance 
changes?
●
●
Are we increasing or decreasing performance?
●
●
Will the customer accept a change?
●
●
Will there be a product or employee liability incurred?
●
●
Will the change in specifications cause a redistribution of project resources?
●
●
Will this change hurt our company’s ability to procure future contracts?
Step 4: Analyzing Alternatives
PMBOK® Guide, 6th Edition
1.2.4.5 Monitoring and Controlling 
Process Group

Once the answers to these questions are obtained, it is often best to plot the results 
graphically. Graphical methods have been used during the past two decades to determine 
crashing costs for shortening the length of a project. To use the graphical techniques, we 
must decide on which of the three parameters to hold fixed.
Situation 1: Performance Is Held Constant (to Specifications): With performance 
fixed, cost can be expressed as a function of time. Sample curves appear in Figures 16–5 
and 16–6. In Figure 16–5, the circled X indicates the target cost and target time. Unfortu-
nately, the cost to complete the project at the target time is higher than the budgeted cost. 
It may be possible to add resources and work overtime so that the time target can be met. 
Depending upon the way that overtime is burdened, it may be possible to find a minimum 
point in the curve where further delays will cause the total cost to escalate.
Curve A in Figure 16–6 shows the case where “time is money,” and any additional time 
will increase the cost to complete. Factors such as management support time will always 
increase the cost to complete. There are, however, some situations where the increased 
costs occur in plateaus. This is shown in curve B of Figure 16–6. This could result from 
having to wait for temperature conditioning of a component before additional work can be 
completed, or simply waiting for nonscheduled resources to be available. In the latter case, 
the trade-off decision points may be at the end of each plateau.
With performance fixed, there are four methods available for constructing and analyz-
ing the time–cost curves:
●
●
Additional resources may be required. This will usually drive up the cost very fast. 
Assuming that the resources are available, cost control problems can occur as a 
result of adding resources after initial project budgeting.
●
●
The scope of work may be redefined and some work deleted without changing 
the project performance requirements. Performance standards may have been set

too high, or the probability of success demanded of the project team may have 
been simply unrealistic. Reductions in cost and improvements in schedules would 
typically result from relaxing performance specifications, provided that the lower 
quality level will still meet the requirements of the customer.
●
●
Available resources may be shifted in order to balance project costs or to speed up 
activities that are on the “critical” path work element that is trailing. This process 
of replanning shifts elements from noncritical to critical activities.
●
●
Given a schedule problem, a change in the logic diagram may be needed to move 
from the current position to the desired position. Such a change could easily result 
in the replanning and reallocation of resources. An example of this would be to 
convert from “serial” to “parallel” work efforts. This is often risky.
Trade-offs with fixed performance levels must take into account the dependence of the 
firm on the customer, priority of the project within the firm, and potential for future busi-
ness. A basic assumption here is that the firm may never sacrifice its reputation by deliver-
ing a product that doesn’t perform to the specifications. The exception might be a change 
that would enhance performance and pull the project back on schedule. This is always 
worth investigating before entering into time–cost trade-offs.
Time and cost are interrelated in a labor-intensive project. As delivery slips, costs usu-
ally rise. Slipping delivery schedules and minimizing cost growth are usually the recom-
mended alternative for projects in which the dependence of the firm on the customer, the 
priority of the project within the firm’s stream of projects, and the future business potential 
in terms of sales represent a low- to medium-risk. Even in some high-risk situations, the 
contractor may have to absorb the additional cost. This decision is often based on estimat-
ing the future projects from this customer so that the loss is amortized against future busi-
ness. Not all projects are financial successes.

Sometimes projects may have fixed time and costs, leaving only the performance vari-
able for trade-offs. However, as shown in the following scenario, the eventual outcome may 
be to modify the “fixed” cost constraint.
Situation 2: Cost Is Fixed: With cost fixed, performance will vary as a function of 
time, as shown in Figure 16–7. The decision of whether to adhere to the target schedule data 
is usually determined by the level of performance. In curve A, performance may increase 
rapidly to the 90 percent level at the beginning of the project. A 10 percent increase in time 
may give a 20 percent increase in performance. After a certain point, a 10 percent increase 
in time may give only a 1 percent increase in performance. The company may not wish to 
risk the additional time necessary to attain the 100 percent performance level if it is pos-
sible to do so. In curve C, the additional time must be sacrificed because it is unlikely that 
the customer will be happy with a 30 to 40 percent performance level. Curve B is the most 
difficult curve to analyze unless the customer has specified exactly which level of perfor-
mance will be acceptable.
If cost is fixed, then it is imperative that the project have a carefully worded and under-
stood contract with clear specifications as to the required level of performance and very 
clear statements of inclusion and exclusion. Careful attention to costs incurred because 
of customer changes or additional requirements can help reduce the possibility of a cost 
overrun. Experience in contracting ensures that costs that may be overlooked by the inex-
perienced project manager are included, thus minimizing the need for such trade-offs 
downstream. Common, overlooked items that can drive up costs include:
●
●
Excessive detailed reporting
●
●
Unnecessary documentation
●
●
Excessive tracking documentation for time, cost, and performance

Wrong type of contract for this type of project
Often with a fixed-cost constraint, the first item that is sacrificed is performance. But 
such an approach can contain hidden disasters over the life of a project if the sacrificed per-
formance turns out to have been essential to meeting some unspecified requirement such 
as long-term maintenance. In the long run, a degraded performance can actually increase 
costs rather than decrease them. Therefore, the project manager should be sure he has a 
good understanding of the real costs associated with trade-offs in performance.
Situation 3: Time Is Fixed: Figure 16–8 identifies the situation in which time is fixed 
and cost varies with performance. Figure 16–8 is similar to Figure 16–7 in that the rate 
of change of performance with cost is the controlling factor. If performance is at the 90 
percent level with the target cost, then the contractor may request performance relief. This 
is shown in curve A. However, if the actual situation reflects curve B or C, additional costs 
must be incurred with the same considerations of situation 1—namely, how important is 
the customer and what emphasis should be placed on his follow-on business? Completing 
the project on schedule can be extremely important in certain cases. For example, if an air-
craft pump is not delivered when the engine is ready for shipment, it can hold up the engine 
manufacturer, the airframe manufacturer, and ultimately the customer. All three can incur 
substantial losses due to the delay of a single component. Moreover, customers who are 
unable to perform and who incur large unanticipated costs tend to have long memories. An 
irate vice president in the customer’s shop can kill further contracts out of all proportion to

the real failure to deliver on time. Sometimes, even though time is supposedly fixed, there 
may be latitude without inconvenience to the customer. This could come about because 
the entire program (of which your project is just one subcontract) is behind schedule, and 
the customer is not ready for your particular project. Another aspect of the time factor is 
that “early warning” of a time overrun can often mitigate the damage to the customer and 
greatly increase his favorable response. Careful planning and tracking, close coordination 
with all functions involved, and realistic dealing with time schedules before and during 
the project can ensure early notification to the customer and the possible negotiation of a 
trade-off of time and dollars or even technical performance. The last thing that a customer 
wants is to have a favorable progress report right up to the end of scheduled time and then 
to be surprised with a serious schedule overrun.
When time is fixed, the customer may find that he has some flexibility in determining 
how to arrive at the desired performance level. As shown in Figure 16–9, the contractor 
may be willing to accept additional costs to maximize employee safety.
Situation 4: No Constraints Are Fixed: Another common situation is that in which 
neither time, cost, nor performance is fixed. The best method for graphically showing the 
trade-off relationships is to develop parametric curves as in Figure 16–10. Cost and time 
trade-offs can now be analyzed for various levels of performance. The curves can also be 
redrawn for various cost levels (i.e., 100, 120, 150 percent of target cost) and schedule 
levels.
Another method for showing a family of curves is illustrated in Figure 16–11. Here, 
the contractor may have several different cost paths for achieving the desired time and 
performance constraints. The final path selected depends on the size of the risk that the 
contractor wishes to take.

Trade-offs can also be necessary at any point during the life cycle of a project. Figure 
16–12 identifies how the relative importance of the constraints of time, cost, and perfor-
mance can change over the life cycle of the project. At project initiation, costs may not 
have accrued to a point where they are important. On the other hand, project performance 
may become even more important than the schedule. At this point, additional performance 
can be “bought.” As the project nears termination, the relative importance of the cost 

constraint may increase drastically, especially if project profits are the company’s major 
source of revenue. Likewise, it is probable that the impact of performance and schedule 
will be lower.

Step 5: Selecting an Alternative
Once the alternative courses of action are determined, step 5 in the 
methodology is employed in order to analyze and select the feasi-
ble alternatives. Analyzing the alternatives should include the preparation of the revised 
project objectives for cost, performance, and time, along with an analysis of the required 
resources, general schedules, and revised project plans necessary to support each scenario. 
It is then the function of top management in conjunction with the project and functional 
managers to choose the solution that minimizes the overall impact to the company. This 
impact need not be measured just in short-term financial results, but should include long-
term strategic and market considerations.
The following tasks can be included in this step:
●
●
Prepare a formal project update report including alternative work scopes, sched-
ules, and costs to achieve.
●
●
Minimum cost overrun
●
●
Conformance to project objectives
●
●
Minimum schedule overrun
●
●
Construct a decision tree including costs, work objectives, and schedules, and an 
estimate of the probability of success for each condition leading to the decision 
point.
●
●
Present to internal and external project management the several alternatives along 
with an estimate of success probability.
●
●
With management’s agreement, select the appropriate completion strategy, and 
begin implementation. This assumes that management does not insist on an impos-
sible task.

The last item requires further clarification. Many companies use a checklist to 
establish the criteria for alternative evaluation as well as for assessment of poten-
tial future problems. The following questions may be part of such a checklist:
●
●
Will other projects be affected?
●
●
Will rework be required in previous tasks?
●
●
Are repair and/or maintenance made more difficult?
●
●
Will additional tasks be required in the future?
●
●
How will project personnel react?
●
●
What is the effect on the project life cycle?
●
●
Will project flexibility be reduced?
●
●
What is the effect on key employees?
●
●
What is the effect on the customer(s)?
The probability of occurrence and severity should be assessed for all potential future 
problems. If there is a high probability that the problem will recur and be severe, a plan 
should be developed to reduce this probability. Internal restrictions, such as manpower, 
materials, machines, money, management, time, policies, quality, and changing require-
ments, can cause problems throughout the life cycle of a project. External restrictions of 
capital, completion dates, and liability also limit project flexibility.
One of the best methods for comparing the alternatives is to list them and then rank 
them in order of perceived importance relative to certain factors such as customer, potential 
follow-on business, cost deficit, and loss of goodwill. This is shown in Table 16–2. In the 
table each of the objectives is weighted according to some method established by manage-
ment. The percentages represent the degree of satisfactory completion for each alternative. 
This type of analysis, often referred to as decision making under risk, is commonly taught 
in operations research and management science coursework. Weighting factors are often 
used to assist in the decision-making process. Unfortunately, this can add mass confusion 
to the already confused process.
Table 16–3 shows that some companies perform trade-off analysis by equating all 
alternatives to a lowest common denominator—dollars. Although this conversion can be 
very difficult, it does ensure that we are comparing “apples to apples.” All resources such 
as capital equipment can be expressed in terms of dollars. Difficulties arise in assigning

The corrective actions defined above can be used for time, cost, and performance. 
However, there are specific alternatives for each area. Assuming that a PERT/CPM analy-
sis was done initially to schedule the project, then the following options are available for 
schedule manipulation:
●
●
Prioritize all tasks and see the effect on the critical path of eliminating low-priority 
efforts.
●
●
Use resource leveling.
●
●
Carry the work breakdown structure to one more level, and reassess the time esti-
mates for each task.
Performance trade-offs can be obtained as follows:
●
●
Excessive or tight specifications that are not critical to the project may be eased. 
(Many times standard specifications such as mil-specs are used without regard for 
their necessity.)
●
●
Requirements for testing can be altered to accommodate automation (such as 
accelerated life testing) to minimize costs.
Methodology for Trade-Off Analysis
591

592
Trade-Off Analysis in a Project Environment 
●
●
Set an absolute minimum acceptable performance requirement below which you 
will not pursue the project. This gives a bound at the low end of performance that 
can’t be crossed in choosing between trade-off alternatives.
●
●
Give up only those performance requirements that have little or no bearing on the 
overall project goals (including implied goals) and their achievement. This may 
require the project manager to itemize and prioritize major and minor objectives.
●
●
Consider absorbing tasks with dedicated project office personnel. This is a 
resource trade-off that can be effective when the tasks to be performed require in-
depth knowledge of the project. An example would be the use of dedicated project 
personnel to perform information gathering on rehabilitation-type projects. The 
improved performance of these people in the design and testing phases due to their 
strong background can save considerable time and effort.
The most promising areas for cost analysis include:
●
●
Incremental costing (using sensitivity analysis)
●
●
Reallocation of resources
●
●
Material substitution where lower-cost materials are utilized without changing 
project specifications
Depending on the magnitude of the problem, the timeliness of its identification, and 
the potential impact on the project results, it may be that no actions exist that will bring the 
project in on time, within budget, and at an acceptable level of performance. The following 
viable alternatives usually remain:
●
●
A renegotiation of project performance criteria could be attempted with the project 
sponsor. Such action would be based on a pragmatic view of the acceptability of 
the probable outcome. Personal convenience of the project manager is not a fac-
tor. Professional and legal liability for the project manager, project team, or parent 
organization may be very real concerns.
●
●
If renegotiation is not considered a viable alternative, or if it is rejected, the only 
remaining option is to “stop loss” in completing the project. Such planning should 
involve both line and project management, since the parent organization is at this 
point seeking to defend itself. Options include:
●
●
Completing the project on schedule, to the minimum quality level required 
by the project sponsor. This results in cost overruns (financial loss) but should 
produce a reasonably satisfied project sponsor. (Project sponsors are not really 
comfortable when they know a project team is operating in a “stop-loss” mode!)
●
●
Controlling costs and performance, but permitting the schedule to slide. The degree 
of unhappiness this generates with the project sponsor will be determined by the 
specific situation. Risks include loss of future work or consequential damages.
●
●
Maintaining schedule and cost performance by allowing quality to slip. The 
high-risk approach has a low probability of achieving total success and a high 
probability of achieving total failure. Quality work done on the project will be 
lost if the final results are below minimum standards.

Contracts: Their Influence on Projects
593
●
●
Seeking to achieve desired costs, schedule, and performance results in the 
light of impossible circumstances. This approach “hopes” that the inevitable 
won’t happen, and offers the opportunity to fail simultaneously in all areas. 
Criminal liability could become an issue.
●
●
Project cancellation, in an effort to limit exposure beyond that already encoun-
tered. This approach might terminate the career of a project manager but could 
enhance the career of the staff counsel!
Step 6: Replanning the Project
The sixth and final step in the methodology of the management 
of project trade-offs is to obtain management approval and replan 
the project. The project manager usually identifies the alternatives and prepares his rec-
ommendation. He then submits his recommendation to top management for approval. 
Top-management involvement is necessary because the project manager may try to make 
corrective action in a vacuum. Top management normally makes decisions based on the 
following:
●
●
The firm’s policies on quality, integrity, and image
●
●
The ability to develop a long-term client relationship
●
●
Type of project (R&D, modernization, new product)
●
●
Size and complexity of the project
●
●
Other projects underway or planned
●
●
Company’s cash flow
●
●
Bottom line—ROI
●
●
Competitive risks
●
●
Technical risks
●
●
Impact on affiliated organizations
After choosing a new course of action from the list of alternatives, management and 
especially the project team must focus on achieving the revised objectives. This may 
require a detailed replanning of the project, including new schedules, PERT charts, work 
breakdown structures, and other key benchmarks. The entire management team (i.e., top 
management, functional managers, and project managers) must all be committed to achiev-
ing the revised project plan.
16.2 CONTRACTS: THEIR INFLUENCE ON PROJECTS
The final decision on whether to trade off cost, time, or performance 
can vary depending on the type of contract. Table 16–4 identifies 
seven common types of contracts and the order in which trade-offs 
will be made.
The firm-fixed-price (FFP) contract. Time, cost, and perfor-
mance are all specified within the contract, and are the contractor’s responsibility. Because 
all constraints are equally important with respect to this type of contract, the sequence of

resources sacrificed is the same as for the project-driven organization shown previously in 
Table 16–1.
The fixed-price-incentive-fee (FPIF) contract: Cost is measured to determine the 
incentive fee, and thus is the last constraint to be considered for trade-off. Because perfor-
mance is usually more important than schedule for project completion, time is considered 
the first constraint for trade-off, and performance is the second.
The cost-plus-incentive-fee (CPIF) contract: The costs are reimbursed and measured 
for determination of the incentive fee. Thus cost is the last constraint to be considered for 
trade-off. As with the FPIF contract, performance is usually more important than schedule 
for project completion, and so the sequence is the same as for the FPIF contract.
The cost-plus-award-fee (CPAF) contract: The costs are reimbursed to the contractor, 
but the award fee is based on performance by the contractor. Thus cost would be the first 
constraint to be considered for trade-off, and performance would be the last constraint to 
be considered.
The cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) contract: Costs are reimbursed to the contractor. Thus, 
cost would be the first constraint to be considered for trade-off. Although there are no 
incentives for efficiency in time or performance, there may be penalties for bad perfor-
mance. Thus time is the second constraint to be considered for trade-off, and performance 
is the third.
16.3 INDUSTRY TRADE-OFF PREFERENCES
Table 16–5 identifies twenty-one industries that were surveyed on their preferential pro-
cess for trade-offs. Obviously, there are variables that affect each decision. The data in the 
table reflect the interviewees’ general responses, neglecting external considerations, which 
might have altered the order of preference.
Table 16–6 shows the relative grouping of Table 16–5 into four categories: project-
driven, non–project-driven, nonprofit, and banks.
In all projects in the banking industry, whether regulated or nonregulated, cost is the first 
resource to be sacrificed. The major reason for this trade-off is that banks in general do not 
have a quantitative estimation of what actual costs they incur in providing a given service.

One example of this phenomenon is that a number of commercial banks heavily emphasize 
the use of Functional Cost Analysis, a publication of the Federal Reserve, for pricing their 
services. This publication is a summary of data received from member banks, of which the 
user is one. This results in questionable output because of inaccuracies of the input.

596
Trade-Off Analysis in a Project Environment 
In cases where federal regulations prescribe time constraints, cost is the only resource 
of consideration, since performance standards are also delineated by regulatory bodies.
In nonregulated banking projects, the next resource to be sacrificed depends on the 
competitive environment. When other competitors have developed a new service or prod-
uct that a particular bank does not yet offer, then the resource of time will be less critical 
than the performance criteria.
In some banking projects, the time factor is extremely important. A number of projects 
depend on federal laws. The date that a specific law goes into effect sets the deadline for 
the project.
Generally, in a nonprofit organization, performance is the first resource that will be 
compromised. The United Way, free clinics, March of Dimes, American Cancer Society, 
and Goodwill are among the many nonprofit agencies that serve community needs. They 
derive their income from donations and/or federal grants, and this funding mechanism 
places a major constraint on their operations. Cost overruns are prohibited by the very 
nature of the organization. Inexperienced staff and time constraints result in poor customer 
service.
The non–project-driven organization is structured along the lines of the traditional 
vertical hierarchy. Functional managers in areas such as marketing, engineering, account-
ing, and sales are involved in planning, organizing, staffing, and controlling their functional 
areas. Many projects that materialize, specifically in a manufacturing concern, are a result 
of a need to improve a product or process and can be initiated by customer request, com-
petitive climate, or internal operations. The first resource to be sacrificed in the non–pro-
ject-driven organization is time, followed by performance and cost, respectively. In most 
manufacturing concerns, budgetary constraints outweigh performance criteria.
In a non–project-driven organization, new projects will take a back seat to the day-
to-day operations of the functional departments. The organizational funds are allocated 
to individual departments rather than to the project itself. When functional managers are 
required to maintain a certain productivity level in addition to supporting projects, their 
main emphasis will be on operations at the expense of project development. When it 
becomes necessary for the firm to curtail costs, special projects will be deleted in order to 
maintain corporate profit margins.
Resource trade-offs in a project-driven organization depend on the life-cycle phase 
of a given project. During the conceptual, definition, and production phases and into the 
operational phase of the project, the trade-off priorities are cost first, then time, and finally 
performance. In these early planning phases the project is being designed to meet certain 
performance and time standards. At this point the cost estimates are based on the figures 
supplied to the project manager by the functional managers.
During the operational phase the cost factor increases in importance over time and 
performance, both of which begin to decrease. In this phase the organization attempts to 
recover its investment in the project and therefore emphasizes cost control. The perfor-
mance standards may have been compromised, and the project may be behind schedule, but 
management will analyze the cost figures to judge the success of the project.
The project-driven organization is unique in that the resource trade-offs may vary in 
priority, depending on the specific project. Research and development projects may have a 
fixed performance level, whereas construction projects normally are constrained by a date 
of completion.

16.4 PROJECT MANAGER’S CONTROL OF TRADE-OFFS
It is obvious from the above discussion that a project manager does have options to control 
a project during its execution. Project managers must be willing to control minor trade-offs 
as well as major ones. However, the availability of specific options is a function of the 
particular project environment.
In this chapter we discussed trade-offs solely on the triple constraint. In reality, the 
trade-off problem is much more complicated because today we have competing constraints, 
including such topics as quality, image, risk, reputation, goodwill, and legal liability.
Probably the greatest contribution a project manager makes to a project team organiza-
tion is stability in adverse conditions. Interpersonal relationships have a great deal to do 
with the alternatives available and their probability of success since team performance will 
be required. Through a combination of management skill and sensitivity, project managers 
can make the trade-offs, encourage the team members, and reassure the project sponsor in 
order to produce a satisfactory project.

17.0 INTRODUCTION
In the early days of project management on many commercial pro-
grams, the majority of project decisions heavily favored cost and 
schedule. This favoritism occurred because we knew more about cost 
and scheduling than we did about technical risks. Technology forecasting was very rarely performed other 
than by extrapolating past technical knowledge into the present. 
Today, the state of the art of technology forecasting is being pushed to the limits on many projects. For 
projects with a duration of less than one year, we normally assume that the environment is known and stable, 
particularly the technological environment. For projects over a year or so in length, technology forecasting 
must be considered. Computer technology doubles in performance about every two years. Engineering tech-
nology is said to double every three or so years. Given such rapid change, plus the inherent need to balance 
cost, technical performance, and schedule, how can a project manager accurately define and plan the scope 
of a three- or four-year project without expecting somewhat uncertain engineering changes resulting from 
technology improvements? With likely changing and uncertain engineering, technology, and production 
environments, what are the risks?
We read in the newspaper about cost overruns and schedule slips on a wide variety of medium- to 
large-scale development projects. Several concerns within the control of the buyer, seller, and/or major

stakeholders can lead to cost growth and schedule slippage on development projects. These causes include 
but are not limited to:1
●
●
Starting a project with a budget and/or schedule that is inadequate for the desired level of technical 
performance (or proxies such as integration complexity)
●
●
Starting a project before adequate requirements flowdown and verification have occurred and/or 
before adequate resources have been committed
●
●
Having an overall development process (or key parts of that process) that favors one or more vari-
ables over others (e.g., technical performance over cost and schedule)
●
●
Establishing a design that is near the feasible limit of achievable technical performance at a given 
point in time
●
●
Making major project design decisions before the relationship between cost, technical perfor-
mance, schedule, and risk is understood
These five causes will contribute to uncertainty in forecasting technology and the associated design 
needed to meet technical performance requirements. And the inability to accurately forecast technology and 
the associated design will contribute to a project’s technical risk and can also lead to cost and/or schedule risk.
Today, the competition for technical achievement has become fierce. Companies have gone through 
life-cycle phases of centralizing all activities, especially management functions, but are decentralizing tech-
nical expertise. By the mid-1980s, many companies recognized the need to integrate technical risks with 
cost and schedule risks and other activities (e.g., quality). Risk management processes were developed and 
implemented where risk information was made available to key decision makers.
The risk management process, however, should be designed to do more than just identify potential 
risks. The process must also include a formal planning activity, analysis to estimate the probability and 
predict the impact on the project of identified risks, a risk response strategy for selected risks, and the ability 
to monitor and control the progress in reducing these selected risks to the desired level.
A project, by definition, is a temporary endeavor used to create something that we have not done previ-
ously and will not do again in the future. Because of this uniqueness, we have developed a “live-with-it” 
attitude on risk and attribute it as part of doing business. If risk management is set up as a continuous, 
disciplined process of planning, identifying, analyzing, developing risk responses, and monitoring and con-
trolling, then the system will easily supplement other processes such as planning, budgeting, cost control, 
quality, and scheduling. Surprises that become problems will be diminished because the emphasis will now 
be on proactive rather than reactive management.
Risk management can be justified on almost all projects. The level of implementation can vary from project 
to project, depending on such factors as size, type of project, who the customer is, contractual requirements, 
relationship to the corporate strategic plan, and corporate culture. Risk management is particularly important 
when the overall stakes are high and/or a great deal of uncertainty exists. In the past, we treated risk as “let’s live 
with it.” Today, risk management is a key part of overall project management, and should be a conscious input to 
decision making. It forces us to focus on the future where uncertainty exists and develop suitable plans of action 
to prevent potential issues from becoming problems and adversely impacting the project.

Definition of Risk
601
17.1 DEFINITION OF RISK
Risk is a measure of the probability and consequence of not achiev-
ing a defined project goal. Most people agree that risk involves the 
notion of uncertainty. Can the specified aircraft range be achieved? 
Can the computer be produced within budgeted cost? Can the new product launch date be 
met? A probability measure can be used for such questions; for example, the probability of 
not meeting the new product introduction date is 0.15. However, when risk is considered, 
the consequences (impact) or damage associated with the event occurring must also be 
included.
Goal A, with a probability of occurrence of only 0.05, may present a much more 
serious (risky) situation than goal B, with a probability of occurrence of 0.20, if the 
consequences of not meeting goal A are, in this case, more than four times more 
severe than the inability to meet goal B. Risk is not always easy to evaluate, since 
the probability of occurrence and the consequence of occurrence are usually not 
directly measurable parameters and must be estimated by judgment, statistical, or 
other ­procedures.
Risk has two primary components for a given event:
●
●
A probability of occurrence of that event
●
●
Impact (or consequence) of the event occurring (amount at stake)
Figure 17–1 shows the components of risk.

Risk Management 
Conceptually, the risk for each event can be defined as a function of probability and 
consequence (impact); that is,
Risk
(probability, consequence)
= f
In general, as either the probability or consequence increases, so does the risk. Both 
the probability and consequence must be considered in risk management. Risk constitutes 
a lack of knowledge of future events. Typically, future events (or outcomes) that are favora-
ble are called opportunities, whereas unfavorable events are called risks.
Another aspect of risk is its cause or, more specifically, the root cause(s). Ide-
ally the root cause is known when examining a risk. However, since risks are related 
to future events, the root cause(s) may not be known and in some cases will never be 
known.
Something, or the lack of something, can induce a risky situation. We denote this 
source of danger as the hazard. Certain hazards can be overcome to a great extent by know-
ing them and taking action to overcome them. For example, a large hole in a road is a much 
greater danger to a driver who is unaware of it than to one who travels the road frequently 
and knows enough to slow down and go around the hole. This leads to the second repre-
sentation of risk:
Risk = f (hazard, safeguard)
Risk increases with hazard but decreases with safeguard. The implication of this equa-
tion is that good project management should be structured to identify hazards and to allow 
safeguards to be developed to overcome them. If suitable safeguards are available, then the 
risk can be reduced to an acceptable level.
Finally, there is often confusion regarding the nature of risks, issues, and problems 
within the context of project management. All three items are partially related through the 
consequence (C) dimension but different in either the probability (P) dimension or time 
frame. A summary of risk, issue, problem, and opportunity with regards to probability, 
consequence, and time frame is given in Table 17–1.
Both issues and problems have a probability of occurrence equal to one—they will 
occur, while a risk may not occur (P < 1) However, an issue will occur in the future while

Tolerance for Risk

a problem occurs in the present. The probability dimension for an opportunity is unclear 
because there is no equivalent differentiation as in the probability dimension for risk, issue, 
and problem. Moreover, it is not possible to define the consequence dimension in a unique 
manner since an opportunity may represent, according to three simple definitions, a posi-
tive outcome, a less negative outcome, and an outcome that is better than expected. Finally, 
the time frame associated with an opportunity is also unclear as it may be now or in the 
future. As evident from the above discussion, while precise definitions have been devel-
oped for risk, issue, and problem, precise definitions cannot be defined for opportunities 
that have universal applicability. Hence, risk and opportunity are not the mirror images or 
dual of each other in terms of either definitions or the utility associated with potential gains 
and losses.
17.2 TOLERANCE FOR RISK
There is no single textbook answer on how to manage risk—one size 
does not fit all projects or circumstances. The project manager must 
rely upon sound judgment and the use of the appropriate tools in 
dealing with risk. The ultimate decision on how to deal with risk is 
based in part upon the project manager’s tolerance for risk, along with contractual require-
ments, stakeholder preferences, and so on.
The three commonly used classifications of tolerance for risk appear in Figure 17–2: 
the risk averter or avoider, the neutral risk taker, and the risk taker or seeker. The Y axis in 
Figure 17–2 represents utility (U), which can be defined as the amount of satisfaction or 
pleasure that the individual receives from a payoff. The X axis in this case is the amount of 
money ($) at stake (but can also potentially represent technical performance or schedule). 
Curves of this type can represent the project manager or other key decision makers’ toler-
ance for risk.
With the risk averter, utility rises at a decreasing rate. In other words, when more 
money is at stake, the project manager’s satisfaction diminishes. With a risk-neutral posi-
tion, utility rises at a constant rate. (Note: A risk-neutral position is a specific course 
of action, and not the average of risk averter and risk taker positions, as is sometimes

erroneously claimed.) With the risk taker, the project manager’s satisfaction increases at an 
increasing rate when more money is at stake. A risk averter prefers a more certain outcome 
and will demand a premium to accept risk. A risk taker prefers the more uncertain outcome 
and may be willing to pay a penalty to take a risk. While the project manager’s or other key 
decision makers’ tolerance for risk may vary with time, different representations of this 
tolerance (e.g., risk averter and risk taker) should not exist at the same time else inconsist-
ent decisions may be made.
17.3 DEFINITION OF RISK MANAGEMENT
Risk management is the act or practice of dealing with risk. It includes 
planning for risk, identifying risks, analyzing risks, developing risk 
response strategies, and monitoring and controlling risks to deter-
mine how they have changed.
Risk management is not a separate project office activity assigned to a risk manage-
ment department, but rather is one aspect of sound project management. Risk management 
should be closely coupled with key project processes, including but not limited to overall 
project management, systems engineering, configuration management, cost, design/engi-
neering, earned value, manufacturing, quality, schedule, scope, and test. (Project manage-
ment and systems engineering are typically the two top-level project processes. While risk 
management can be linked to either of these processes, it is typically associated with pro-
ject management.)
Proper risk management is proactive rather than reactive and positive rather than negative 
and seeks to increase the probability of project success. As an example, an item in a network 
(e.g., router) requires that a new technology be developed. The schedule indicates six months 
for this development, but project engineers think that nine months is much more likely. If the 
project manager is proactive, he or she might develop a risk response plan to address potential 
risks right now. If the project manager is reactive (e.g., a “problem solver”), then he or she 
may do nothing until the problem actually occurs. At that time the project manager must react 
rapidly to the crisis and may have lost valuable time during which contingencies could have 
been developed and at least some possible solutions may have been foreclosed. (The result-
ing cost, technical performance, schedule, and risk design solution space will also have likely 
shrunk considerably versus when the project was initiated.) Hence, proper risk management 
will attempt to reduce the probability of an event occurring and/or the magnitude of its impact 
as well as increase the probability of project success.
17.4 CERTAINTY, RISK, AND UNCERTAINTY
Decision making falls into three categories: certainty, risk, and uncer-
tainty. (Decision making, including but not limited to payoff matri-
ces, expected [monetary] value, and decision trees, can be loosely 
linked with quantitative risk analysis, discussed in Section 17–10.) Decision making under

certainty is the easiest case to work with. With certainty, we assume that all of the necessary 
information is available to assist us in making the right decision, and we can predict the 
outcome with a high level of confidence.
Decision Making under 
Certainty
Decision making under certainty implies that we know with 100 per-
cent accuracy what the states of nature will be and what the expected 
payoffs will be for each state of nature. Mathematically, this can be shown with payoff 
matrices. To construct a payoff matrix, we must identify (or select) the states of nature 
over which we have no control. We then select our own action to be taken for each of the 
states of nature. Our actions are called strategies. The elements in the payoff table are the 
outcomes for each strategy. A payoff matrix based on decision making under certainty has 
two controlling features:
●
●
Regardless of which state of nature exists, there will be one strategy that will 
produce larger gains or smaller losses than any other strategy for all the states of 
nature.
●
●
There are no probabilities assigned to each state of nature. (It could also be stated 
that each state of nature has an equal likelihood of occurring.)
Consider a company wishing to invest $50 million to develop a new product. The com-
pany decides that the states of nature will be either a strong market demand, an even market 
demand, or a low market demand. The states of nature shall be represented as N1 5 a strong 
(up) market, N2 5 an even market, and N3 5 a low market demand. The company also has 
narrowed its choices to one of three ways to develop the product: either A, B, or C. There 
also exists a strategy, S4, not to develop the product at all, in which case there would be nei-
ther profit nor loss. We shall assume that the decision is made to develop the product. The 
payoff matrix for this example is shown in Table 17–2. Looking for the controlling features 
in Table 17–2, we see that regardless of how the market reacts, strategy S3 will always yield 
larger profits than the other two strategies. The project manager will therefore always select 
strategy S3 in developing the new product. Strategy S3 is the best option to take.
Table 17–2 can also be represented in subscript notation. Let Pi,j be the elements of the 
matrix, where P represents profit. The subscript i is the row (strategy), and j is the column 
(state of nature). For example, P2,3 = profit from choosing strategy 2 with N3 state of nature 
occurring. It should be noted that there is no restriction that the matrix be square, but at 
a minimum it will be a rectangle (i.e., the number of states of nature need not equal the 
number of possible strategies).

Risk Management 
In most cases, there usually does not exist one strategy that dominates 
for all states of nature. In a realistic situation, higher profits are usu-
ally accompanied by higher risks and therefore higher probable losses. 
When there does not exist a dominant strategy, a probability must be assigned to the occur-
rence of each state of nature. Risk can be viewed as outcomes (i.e., states of nature) that 
can be described within established confidence limits (i.e., probability distributions). These 
probability distributions should ideally be either estimated or defined from experimental 
data. Consider Table 17–3, in which the payoffs for strategies 1 and 3 of Table 17–2 are 
interchanged for the state of nature N3.
From Table 17–3, it is obvious that there does not exist one dominant strategy. When 
this occurs, probabilities must be assigned to the possibility of each state of nature occur-
ring. The best choice of strategy is therefore the strategy with the largest expected value, 
where the expected value is the summation of the payoff times and the probability of occur-
rence of the payoff for each state of nature. In mathematical formulation,

where Ei is the expected payoff for strategy i, Pi,j is the payoff element, and pj is the 
probability of each state of nature occurring. The expected value for strategy S1 is 
therefore
Repeating the procedure for strategies 2 and 3, we find that E2 = 55 and E3 = 20. 
Therefore, based on the expected value, the project manager should always select 
strategy S1. If two strategies of equal value occur, the decision should include other 
potential considerations (e.g., frequency of occurrence, resource availability, time to 
impact). (Note: Expected value calculations require that a risk-neutral utility relation-
ship exists. If the decision maker is not risk-neutral, such calculations may or may not 
be useful, and the results should be evaluated to see how they are affected by differ-
ences in risk tolerance.)
To quantify potential payoffs, we must identify the strategy we are willing to take, 
the expected outcome (element of the payoff table), and the probability that the outcome 
will occur. In the previous example, we should accept the risk associated with strategy S1, 
since it gives us the greatest expected value (all else held constant). If the expected value is

positive, then this strategy should be considered. If the expected value is negative, then this 
strategy should be proactively managed if it is chosen.
An important factor in decision making under risk is the assigning of the probabili-
ties for each of the states of nature. If the probabilities are erroneously assigned, different 
expected values will result, thus giving us a different perception of the best strategy to take. 
Suppose in Table 17–3 that the assigned probabilities of the three states of nature are 0.6, 
0.2, and 0.2. The respective expected values are

In this case, the project manager would always choose strategy S3 (all else held 
­constant).
The difference between risk and uncertainty is that under risk there 
are assigned specific probabilities and under uncertainty meaningful 
assignments of specific probabilities are not possible. As with decision making under risk, 
uncertainty also implies that there may exist no single dominant strategy. The decision 
maker, however, does have four basic criteria at his or her disposal from which to make a 
management decision. The use of each criterion will depend on the type of project as well 
as the project manager’s tolerance to risk.
The first criterion is the Hurwicz criterion, often referred to as the maximax crite-
rion. Under the Hurwicz criterion, the decision maker is always optimistic and attempts to 
maximize profits by a go-for-broke strategy. This result can be seen from the example in 
Table 17–3. The maximax criterion says that the decision maker will always choose strategy 
S3 because the maximum profit is 100. However, if the state of nature were N3, then strategy 
S3 would result in a maximum loss instead of a maximum gain. The use of the maximax crite-
rion must then be based on how big a risk can be undertaken and how much one can afford to 
lose. A large corporation with strong assets may use the Hurwicz criterion, whereas the small 
private company might be more interested in minimizing the possible losses.
A small company may be more apt to use the Wald, or maximin, criterion, where the 
decision maker is concerned with how much he or she can afford to lose. In this criterion, 
a pessimistic rather than optimistic position is taken with the viewpoint of minimizing the 
maximum loss.
For the Wald criterion, we consider only the minimum payoffs. The minimum payoffs 
in Table 17–3 are 40, 50, and –50 for strategies S1, S2, and S3, respectively. The project 
manager who wishes to minimize his or her maximum loss will always select strategy S2 in 
this case. If all three minimum payoffs were negative, the project manager would select the 
smallest loss if these were the only options available. Depending on a company’s financial 
position, there are situations where the project would not be undertaken if all three mini-
mum payoffs were negative.
The third criterion is the Savage, or minimax, criterion. Under this criterion, we assume 
that the project manager is a sore loser. To minimize the regrets of the sore loser, the project 
manager attempts to minimize the maximum regret, that is, the minimax criterion.
Decision Making  
under Uncertainty

608
Risk Management 
The first step in the Savage criterion is to set up a regret table by subtracting all ele-
ments in each column from the largest element. Applying this approach to Table 17–3, we 
obtain Table 17–4.
The regrets are obtained for each column by subtracting each element in a given col-
umn from the largest column element. The maximum regret is the largest regret for each 
strategy, that is, in each row. In other words, if the project manager selects strategy S1 or 
S2, he or she will only be sorry for a loss of 50. However, depending on the state of nature, 
a selection of strategy S3 may result in a regret of 140. The Savage criterion would select 
either strategy S1 or S2 in this example.
The fourth criterion is the Laplace criterion. The Laplace criterion is an attempt to trans-
form decision making under uncertainty to decision making under risk. Recall that the differ-
ence between risk and uncertainty is knowledge of the probability of occurrence of each state 
of nature. The Laplace criterion makes an a priori assumption based on Bayesian statistics, 
that if the probabilities of each state of nature are not known, then we can assume that each 
state of nature has an equal likelihood of occurrence. The procedure then follows decision 
making under risk, where the strategy with the maximum expected value is selected. Using 
the Laplace criterion applied to Table 17–3, and thus assuming that P1 = P2 = P3 = 1/3 we 
obtain Table 17–5. The Laplace criterion would select strategy S1 in this example.
The important conclusion to be drawn from decision making under uncertainty is the 
risk that the project manager wishes to incur. For the four criteria presented, we have shown 
that any strategy can be chosen depending on how much money we can afford to lose and 
what risks we are willing to take.

Decision Trees
The concept of expected value can also be combined with “probability” 
or “decision” trees to identify and quantify the potential risks. Another 
common term is the impact analysis diagram. Decision trees are used when a decision 
can be viewed not as a single, isolated occurrence, but rather as a sequence of several 

Certainty, Risk, and Uncertainty

­interrelated decisions. In this case, the decision maker makes an entire series of decisions 
simultaneously. (Again, a risk-neutral utility relationship is assumed.)
Figure 17–3 shows a decision tree. The probability at the end of each branch (furthest 
to the right) is obtained by multiplying the branch probabilities together.
For more sophisticated problems, the process of constructing a decision tree can 
be complicated. Decision trees contain decision points, usually represented by a box or 
square, where the decision maker must select one of several available alternatives. Chance 
points, designated by a circle, indicate that a chance event is expected at this point. (A key 
assumption required for decision trees is a risk-neutral position, discussed in Section 17–2. 
Note that the expected value computed in decision trees is not the average outcome, it is 
the risk-neutral outcome.)
The following three steps are needed to construct a tree diagram:
●
●
Build a logic tree, usually from left to right, including all decision points and 
chance points.
●
●
Put the probabilities of the states of nature on the branches, thus forming a prob-
ability tree.
●
●
Finally, add the conditional payoffs, thus completing the decision tree.
Consider the following problem. You have the chance to make or buy certain widg-
ets for resale. If you make the widgets yourself, you must purchase a new machine for 
$35,000. If demand is good, which is expected 70 percent of the time, an $80,000 profit 
will occur on the sale of the widgets. With poor market conditions, $30,000 in profits will 
occur, not including the cost of the machine. If we subcontract out the work, our contract 
administration costs will be $5,000. If the market is good, profits will be $50,000; for a

poor market, profits will be $15,000. Figure 17–4 shows the tree diagram for this problem. 
In this case, the expected value of the strategy that subcontracts out the work is $4,500 
greater than the expected value for the strategy that manufactures the widgets. Hence, we 
should select the strategy that subcontracts out the widgets.
17.5 RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS
It is important that a risk management strategy be established early 
in a project and that risk be continually addressed throughout the 
project life cycle. Risk management includes several related actions, 
including risk: planning, identification, analysis, response (handling), and monitoring and 
control.
●
●
Plan risk management is the process of developing and documenting an organized, 
comprehensive, and interactive strategy and methods for identifying and analyzing 
risks, developing risk response plans, and monitoring and controlling how risks 
have changed.
●
●
Identify risks is the process of examining the program areas and each critical tech-
nical process to identify and document the associated risk.
●
●
Perform risk analysis is the process of examining each identified risk to estimate 
the probability and the impact(s) on the project. It includes both qualitative risk 
analysis and quantitative risk analysis.
●
●
Plan risk response is the process that identifies, evaluates, selects, and implements 
one or more strategies in order to reduce risk to an acceptable level given pro-
gram constraints and objectives. This includes the specifics on what should be 
done, when it should be accomplished, who is responsible, and associated cost 
and schedule. A risk or opportunity response strategy is composed of an option 
and implementation approach. Response options for risks include acceptance, 
avoidance, mitigation (also known as control), and transfer. Response options for

opportunities include acceptance, enhance, exploit, and share. The most desirable 
response option is selected, and a specific implementation approach is then devel-
oped for this option. Finally, resources are allocated to the risk response plan (e.g., 
budget, personnel, equipment, facilities) and the response plan is implemented.
●
●
Monitor and control risks is the process that systematically tracks and evaluates the 
performance of risk response actions against established metrics throughout the acqui-
sition process and provides inputs to updating risk response strategies, as appropriate.
17.6 PLAN RISK MANAGEMENT
Plan for risk management (risk planning) is the detailed formula-
tion of a program of action for the management of risk. It is the 
process to:
●
●
Develop and document an organized, comprehensive, and interactive risk manage-
ment strategy
●
●
Determine the methods to be used to execute a program’s risk management ­strategy
●
●
Plan for adequate resources
Risk planning is iterative and includes the entire risk management process, with activi-
ties to identify, analyze, respond to, and monitor and control risks. Important outputs of the 
risk planning process are the risk management plan (RMP) and risk management training. 
(Note: The RMP is an output of risk planning, and not the risk planning process itself.)
Risk planning develops a risk management strategy, which includes both the process 
and implementation approach for the project. Each of these two considerations is of pri-
mary importance for achieving effective risk management. However, it is generally far 
easier to improve a deficient process than remedy a problematic project environment that 
is unsupportive or hostile towards risk management. Early efforts should establish the pur-
pose and objective, assign responsibilities for specific areas, identify additional technical 
expertise needed, describe the assessment process and areas to consider, define a risk rating 
approach, delineate procedures for consideration of response strategies, establish monitor-
ing and control metrics (where possible), and define the reporting, documentation, and 
communication needs.
The RMP is the risk-related roadmap that tells the project team how to get from where 
the program is today to where the project manager wants it to be in the future. The key to 
writing a good RMP is to provide the necessary information so the program team knows 
the objectives; goals; tools and techniques; reporting, documentation, and communication; 
organizational roles and responsibilities; and behavioral climate to achieving effective risk 
management. The RMP should include appropriate definitions, ground rules, and assump-
tions associated with performing risk management on the project, candidate risk catego-
ries, suitable risk identification and analysis methodologies, a suitable risk management 
organizational implementation, and suitable documentation (e.g., templates or links to an 
online tool/database) for risk management activities. The RMP should never include results

11.2.3.1 Risk Register

612
Risk Management 
(e.g., risk analysis scores) because these results may frequently change, thus necessitating 
updates to the RMP. Instead, risk-related results should be included in separate risk docu-
ments (e.g., risk register, which contains the details of the individual risks that have been 
identified and its updates) to avoid unnecessary updates to the RMP.
Since the RMP is a roadmap, it may be specific in some areas, such as the assignment 
of responsibilities for project personnel and definitions, and general in other areas to allow 
users to choose the most efficient way to proceed. For example, a description of techniques 
that suggests several methods to perform a risk identification is appropriate, since every 
technique will have advantages and disadvantages depending on the situation.
Another important aspect of risk planning is providing risk management training to 
project personnel. This training should be tailored to various groups within the project as 
necessary, and a different emphasis may exist for decision makers versus working-level 
personnel and technical versus nontechnical personnel.
17.7 RISK IDENTIFICATION
The second step in risk management is to identify risks. This may result 
from a survey of the project, customer, and users for potential concerns.
Some degree of risk always exists in the project, such as in tech-
nical, test, logistics, production, engineering, and other areas. Project risks include busi-
ness, contract relationship, cost, funding, management, political, and schedule risks. (Cost 
and schedule risks are often so fundamental to a project that they may be treated as stand-
alone risk categories.) The understanding of risks evolves over time, and new risks may 
appear as the program transitions from examining concepts to evaluating designs, to build-
ing prototypes and/or models, and finally production of the selected design. Consequently, 
risk identification must continue through all project phases.
Project risks should be examined and dissected to a level of detail that permits an 
evaluator to understand the significance of the risk and its causes and when possible to 
potentially examine the root cause(s).
Some risks can be categorized according to life-cycle phases, as shown in Figure 17–5. 
In the early life-cycle phases, the total project risk is high in part because of the lack 
of information which may preclude comprehensive and accurate risk identification and 
because risk response plans have yet to be developed and implemented. In the later life-
cycle phases, financial risk is generally substantial both because of investments made (such 
as cost) and because of foreclosed options (opportunity cost).
It is important that all project personnel are involved with risk identification. Desig-
nating a small subset of people to perform risk identification almost always diminishes the 
results from both a technical (number of valid identified risks) and behavioral perspective 
(sends the “wrong message” to other project personnel) and can lead to decreased risk 
management effectiveness. This defective risk identification practice should be avoided 
whenever possible. (Note: This is different than occasionally having outside personnel 
brought into the project to assist in independently identifying candidate risks, which may 
prove beneficial in challenging projects.)

17.8 RISK ANALYSIS
Risk analysis is a systematic process to estimate the level of risk for 
identified and approved risks. This involves estimating the prob-
ability of occurrence and consequence of occurrence and converting 
the results to a corresponding risk level. The approach used depends 
upon the data available and requirements levied on the project. The 
most common form of qualitative approach is the use of probability-of-occurrence and 
consequence-­of-occurrence scales together with a risk (mapping) matrix to convert the ­values

to risk levels. Quantitative approaches include but are not limited to expected value [also 
known as expected (monetary) value for cost-based calculations], decision tree analysis (with 
branches specified by specific probabilities and/or distributions), payoff matrices, and mode-
ling and simulation. Of key importance is the use of an approved, structured, repeatable meth-
odology rather than a subjective approach that may yield uncertain and/or inaccurate results.
Risk analysis begins with a detailed evaluation of the risks that have been identified 
and approved by decision makers for further evaluation. The objective is to gather enough 
information about the risks to estimate the probability of occurrence and consequence of 
occurrence and convert the resulting values to a corresponding risk level. (Note: It is impor-
tant that only approved risks be analyzed to prevent resources from being expended on 
items that may not actually be risks.)
Risk analyses are often based on detailed information that may come from a variety of 
techniques including but not limited to:
●
●
Analysis of plans and related documents
●
●
Comparisons with similar systems
●
●
Data from engineering or other models
●
●
Experience and interviewing
●
●
Modeling and simulation
●
●
Relevant lessons-learned studies
●
●
Results from tests and prototype development
●
●
Sensitivity analysis of alternatives and inputs
●
●
Specialist and expert judgments
After performing a risk analysis it is often necessary to convert the results into risk 
levels. When a quantitative risk analysis methodology is used, the results can be grouped 
by existing cost risk, schedule risk, or technical risk boundaries that have specifically been 
tailored to the program or by performing a (statistical) cluster analysis on the results.
When a qualitative risk analysis is performed, risk ratings can be used as an indica-
tion of the potential importance of risks on a program. They are typically a measure of the 
probability of occurrence and the consequences of occurrence and are often expressed as 
low, medium, and high (or possibly low, medium low, medium, medium high, and high). A 
representative (“strawman”) set of risk rating definitions follows:
●
●
High risk: Substantial impact on cost, technical performance, or schedule. Sub-
stantial action required to alleviate the item. High-priority management attention 
is required.
●
●
Medium risk: Some impact on cost, technical performance, or schedule. Special 
action may be required to alleviate the item. Additional management attention may 
be needed.
●
●
Low risk: Minimal impact on cost, technical performance, or schedule. Normal 
management oversight is sufficient.
A number of different outputs are possible for both qualitative and/or quantitative risk 
analyses. These include but are not limited to (1) an overall project risk ranking, (2) a list of

prioritized risks, (3) probability of exceeding project cost and/or schedule, (4) probability 
of not achieving project performance requirements, (5) decision analysis results, (6) failure 
modes and effects (reliability), (7) fault paths (reliability), and (8) probability of failure 
(reliability).
17.9 QUALITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS
A commonly used qualitative risk analysis methodology involves 
risk scales (templates) for estimating probability of occurrence and 
consequence of occurrence, coupled with a risk mapping matrix. The 
risk is evaluated using expert opinion against all relevant probability-of-occurrence scales 
as well as the three consequence-of-occurrence scales (cost, technical performance, and 
schedule) and the results are then transferred onto a risk mapping matrix to convert these 
values to a corresponding risk level. The risk is included in a prioritized list based upon the 
risk level as well as other considerations (e.g., frequency of occurrence, the time to impact, 
and interrelationships with other risks).
Several different classes of risk scales exist.2 The first type of scale is a nominal scale. 
Nominal scales have coefficients with no mathematical meaning, and the values are gener-
ally placeholders (e.g., freeway numbers). Nominal scales are not used in risk analyses.
The second type of scale is an interval scale. Interval scales, such as Fahrenheit and 
Celsius temperature, are cardinal in nature. However, the scales have no meaningful zero 
point, and ratios between similar scales are not equivalent. Interval scales are not com-
monly used in risk analyses.
The third type of scale is an ordinal scale. Ordinal scales have levels that are only 
rank-ordered—they have no cardinal meaning because the true scale interval values are 
unknown. There is no probabilistic or mathematical justification to perform math opera-
tions (e.g., addition, multiplication, averaging) on results obtained from ordinal-scale val-
ues, and any such results may have large errors. For example, relatively simple examples 
have been developed that contain errors of 600 percent or more when comparing actual 
versus assumed ordinal-scale coefficients.3 These scales may be used to represent different 
aspects of the probability of occurrence (e.g., technology, design, manufacturing) and con-
sequence of occurrence (e.g., cost, schedule, and technical). Ordinal scales are commonly 
used in risk analyses. Such scales and a corresponding risk mapping matrix can be a helpful 
methodology for estimating risk. However, for the reasons discussed above great care must 
be taken in using this approach.
The fourth type of scale is a calibrated ordinal scale. Calibrated ordinal scales are 
ordinal scales whose scale-level coefficients are estimated by evaluating an additive utility 
function (or similar approach). These estimated cardinal coefficients replace the ordinal 
placeholder values. Limited mathematical operations are possible that yield valid results.

Risk Management 
However, the values are often relative rather than absolute and the zero point may not 
be meaningful. Calibrated ordinal scales are not commonly used in risk analysis, in part 
because of the difficulty in accurately estimating the associated coefficients.
The fifth type of scale is a ratio scale. Ratio scales, such as Kelvin and Rankine tem-
perature, have cardinal coefficients, indicate absolute position and importance, and the zero 
point is meaningful. In addition, intervals between scales are consistent, and ratio values 
between scales are meaningful. Mathematical operations can be performed on ratio scales 
and yield valid results. Although ratio scales are the ideal scales for use in risk analyses, 
they rarely exist or are used.
The sixth type of scale is based on subjective estimates assigned to different prob-
ability statements (e.g., high), termed here “estimative probability.” Estimative probability 
scales can either be ordinal (more common) or cardinal (less common) in nature depending 
upon the source of the underlying data and the structure of the scale. In the worst case the 
probability estimates are point estimates or ranges developed by the scale’s author with 
no rigorous basis to substantiate the values. In the best case the probability estimates are 
derived from a statistical analysis of survey data from a substantial number of respondents 
and include point estimates and ranges around the estimate for each probability statement. 
Estimative probability scales are sometimes used in risk analyses. However, this type of 
scale should never be the first choice when performing a risk analysis because different 
people may assign different probability values to the same subjective word (e.g., high). 
This can lead to nontrivial errors in both the estimated probability value and the resulting 
risk level.
A risk mapping matrix is typically used to convert ordinal probability of occurrence 
and consequence of occurrence scale values to a corresponding risk level. While there is 
no preset size for such a matrix, its dimensions must be less than or equal to the number 
of scale levels used in both the probability and consequence dimensions. With five-level 
probability-of-occurrence and consequence-of- occurrence scales this corresponds to a 
5 × 5 or smaller matrix. As previously mentioned, risk and opportunity are not the mirror 
images or dual of each other. Hence, it is incorrect to simply assume that a decision maker 
will have a neutral position towards both risks and opportunities, then claim that a mirror 
image mapping matrix (sometimes called a “butterfly matrix”) can be used to illustrate the 
level of risks and opportunities.
17.10 QUANTITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS
Several methodologies are commonly used in quantitative risk analy-
ses. These include but are not limited to payoff matrices, decision 
analysis (typically decision trees), expected value, and a Monte Carlo 
process. If the potential probabilities of the states of nature can be 
represented by a point value, as in Figures 17–3 and 17–4, then the decision tree approach 
(which relies on expected value calculations assuming risk-neutral participants) is often 
appropriate. On the other hand, if the states of nature cannot be represented by one or more 
point values, then probability distributions should be used instead. A common ­methodology

Analysis

617
that incorporates a model structure and probability distributions is a Monte Carlo process 
(commonly called a Monte Carlo simulation).
Two keys to producing accurate quantitative risk analysis results include developing 
an accurate model structure and incorporating accurate probability information. In project 
risk management there is often insufficient attention paid to each of these items, and the 
outcome can be inaccurate results. The model structure should be carefully developed and 
validated before any output is used for decision-making purposes. While this is easy to do 
for simple decision trees (e.g., those in Figures 17–3 and 17–4), it can be much more com-
plex when scores or hundreds of branches and potential outcomes are involved.
Quantitative risk analysis outputs can be used in a variety of ways, including but not 
limited to developing (1) prioritized risk lists (similar to that for calibrated ordinal scales), 
(2) probabilistic cost estimates at completion per project phase and probabilistic schedule 
estimates for key milestones to help the project manager allocate reserves accordingly, 
(3) probabilistic estimates of meeting desired technical performance parameters (e.g., mis-
sile accuracy) and validating technical performance of key components (e.g., real-time 
integrated circuit operation), and (4) estimates of the probability of meeting cost, techni-
cal performance, and schedule objectives (e.g., determining the probability of achieving 
the planned estimate at completion, a key schedule milestone, or key technical perfor-
mance characteristics.) Trends versus time can also be developed from the above outputs 
by repeating the quantitative risk analyses during the course of the project phase. (Note, 
however, that the actual trend information will often be masked by uncertainties in the 
analysis that should reduce as a function of time [holding all else constant]).
The Monte Carlo process, as applied to risk management, is an attempt 
to create a series of probability distributions for potential risks, ran-
domly sample these distributions, and then transform these numbers into useful informa-
tion that reflects quantification of the associated cost, technical performance, or schedule 
risks. While often used in technical applications (e.g., integrated circuit performance, 
structural response to an earthquake), Monte Carlo simulations have also been used to 
estimate risk in the design of service centers; time to complete key milestones in a project; 
the cost of developing, fabricating, and maintaining an item; inventory management; and 
thousands of other applications.
A summary of the steps used in performing a Monte Carlo simulation for cost and 
schedule follows. (Technical performance simulations can have a widely varying model 
structure and hence may not fit into the outline below.) Although the details of implement-
ing the Monte Carlo simulation will vary between applications, many cases use a procedure 
similar to this:
1.	 Develop and validate a suitable cost or schedule deterministic model without risk and/
or uncertainty.
2.	 Develop the reference point estimate (e.g., cost or schedule duration) for each WBS ele-
ment or activity contained within the model.
3.	 Check and recheck the model logic (cost and schedule) and constraints (schedule), as 
incorrect model logic and constraints are surprisingly common and will lead to er-
roneous simulation results. For example, the percentage of time spent validating the 
Monte Carlo Process

618
Risk Management 
deterministic schedule logic and constraints should increase with the number of tasks 
present. For schedules with several thousand tasks more than half of the time should be 
spent validating the schedule and less than half the time spent obtaining the probability 
distributions and interpreting the output.
4.	 Identify the lowest WBS or activity level for which probability distributions will be 
constructed. The level selected will depend on the program phase—often lower levels 
as the project matures.
5.	 Identify which WBS elements or activities contain estimating uncertainty and/or risk. 
(For example, technical risk can be present in some cost estimate WBS elements and 
schedule activities.)
6.	 Develop suitable probability distributions for each WBS element or activity with es-
timating uncertainty and/or risk. For cost risk analyses cost estimating uncertainty, 
schedule risk, and technical risk should be considered as separate distributions. For 
schedule risk analyses schedule estimating uncertainty, technical risk, and possibly cost 
risk should be considered as separate distributions. With some tools (e.g., some project 
scheduling software) only a single probability distribution can be used for a given WBS 
element or activity. In such cases expert judgement will be needed to develop a single 
probability distribution from multiple data samples.
7.	 Aggregate the WBS element or activity probability distributions functions using a Mon-
te Carlo simulation. When performed for cost, the results of this step will typically be 
a WBS level 1 probabilistic cost estimate at completion at the desired probability level 
and a cumulative distribution function (CDF) of cost versus probability. These outputs 
are then analyzed to determine the level of cost risk and to identify the specific cost 
drivers. When performed for schedule, the results of this step will be CDFs of schedule 
finish dates (and possibly durations) for selected tasks. These outputs are then analyzed 
to determine the level of schedule risk at the desired probability level and to identify the 
specific schedule drivers.
8.	 Sensitivity and scenario analyses should also be considered for cost and schedule risk 
analyses. However, they should be performed on the probabilistic (simulation) model, 
not the deterministic model. If the deterministic model is used, probabilistic considera-
tions will not be taken into consideration. For cost risk analysis the sensitivity analysis 
identifies which elements with probability distributions affect the results (e.g., total 
program cost, cost by program phase) the most. For schedule risk analyses the percent 
of time a task is on the probabilistic critical path (e.g., criticality, critical index) coupled 
with the influence the probability distribution associated with that task has on the speci-
fied output (sensitivity, usually derived from correlation or regression) is of consider-
able value since neither type of information can be obtained from a deterministic analy-
sis. Furthermore, the product of the criticality times sensitivity yields cruciality, which 
is a measure of the sensitivity times the percent of time the task is on the probabilistic 
critical path.
Note: It should be recognized that the quality of Monte Carlo simulation results are 
only as good as the structure of the model, the quality of the reference point estimates, 
the selection of probability distributions used in the simulation, and how the simulation is 
implemented.

Plan Risk Response
619
17.11 PLAN RISK RESPONSE
Planning risk responses (risk handling) includes specific methods and 
techniques to deal with known risks and opportunities, identifies who 
is responsible for the risk or opportunity, and provides an estimate of 
the resources associated with handling the risk or opportunity, if any. 
It involves planning and execution with the objective of reducing risks to an acceptable 
level and exploiting potential opportunities. There are several factors that can influence our 
response to a risk or opportunity, including but not limited to:
●
●
Amount and quality of information on the event or situation that caused the risk 
(descriptive uncertainty)
●
●
Amount and quality of information on the magnitude of the damage (measurement 
uncertainty)
●
●
Personal benefit to the project manager for accepting the risk or opportunity (vol-
untary risk or opportunity)
●
●
Risk or opportunity forced upon the project manager (involuntary risk or ­opportunity)
●
●
The existence of cost-effective alternatives (equitable risks or opportunities)
●
●
The existence of high-cost alternatives or possibly lack of options (inequitable 
risks or opportunities)
●
●
Length of exposure to the risk or time available for the opportunity
Risk response planning must be compatible with the RMP and any additional guidance the 
project manager provides. A critical part of risk response planning involves refining and selecting 
the most appropriate response option(s) and specific implementation approach(es) for 
selected risks (often those with medium or higher risk levels) and opportunities. The selected 
risk response option coupled with the specific implementation approach is known as the risk 
response (handling) strategy, which is documented in the risk response (handling) plan. The 
procedure to develop a risk response strategy is straightforward. First, the most desirable risk 
response option (of acceptance, avoidance, control [mitigation], and transfer for risks, and 
acceptance, enhance, exploit, and share for opportunities) is selected based upon cost, perfor-
mance, schedule, and risk trade studies, then the best implementation approach is chosen for 
the selected option. In cases where one or more backup strategies may be warranted (e.g., high 
risks), the above procedure is repeated. (While the selected option for a backup strategy may 
be the same as for the primary strategy, the implementation approach will always be 
different; otherwise, the primary and backup strategy would be identical.) Similarly, contingent 
responses can be developed for risks and opportunities where action is taken only if certain 
predefined conditions occur. Finally, handling strategies can be developed using a hybrid of 
up to all four risk or opportunity options coupled with a suitable implementation approach.
Personnel that evaluate candidate risk response strategies may use the following crite-
ria as a starting point for evaluation:
●
●
Can the strategy be feasibly implemented and still meet the user’s needs?
●
●
What is the expected effectiveness of the response strategy in reducing program 
risk to an acceptable level?

Risk Management 
●
●
Is the strategy affordable in terms of dollars and other resources (e.g., use of criti-
cal materials, personnel, and test facilities and equipment)?
●
●
Is time available to develop and implement the strategy, and what effect does that 
have on the overall program schedule?
●
●
What effect does the strategy have on the system’s technical performance?
A summary of risk response options for risks and opportunities is given in Table 17–6. 
For risks this includes acceptance, avoidance, mitigation (control), and transfer while for 
opportunities this includes acceptance, enhance, exploit, and share. In addition, contingent 
responses are possible for both risks and opportunities.
A brief discussion of the four response options for risks follows:
●
●
Acceptance (i.e., retention): The project manager says, “I know the risk exists and 
am aware of the possible consequences. I am willing to wait and see what happens. 
I accept the risk should it occur and have allocated sufficient budget, schedule, and 
other resources to deal with it.”
●
●
Avoidance: The project manager says, “I will not accept this design because of the 
potentially unfavorable results. I will change either the design to preclude the risk 
or the requirements that lead to the risk.”
●
●
Control (e.g., mitigation): The project manager says, “I will take the necessary 
measures required to actively mitigate this risk. I will do what is expected.”
●
●
Transfer: The project manager says, “I will share this risk with others through 
insurance or a warranty or transfer the entire risk to them. I may also consider

partitioning the risk across hardware and/or software interfaces or using other 
approaches that share the risk.”
A brief discussion of the four response options for opportunities follows:
●
●
Acceptance (i.e., retention): The project manager says, “I know an opportunity 
exists and am aware of the possible benefits. I am willing to wait and see what 
happens. I will accept the opportunity should it occur.”
●
●
Enhance: The project manager says, “This is an opportunity. What can we do to 
increase the probability of occurrence of the opportunity, such as by using more 
aggressive advertising?”
●
●
Exploit: The project manager says, “This is an opportunity. How can we make the 
most of it? Will assigning more talented resources allow us to get to the market-
place quicker?”
●
●
Share: The project manager says, “This is an opportunity but we cannot maxi-
mize the benefits alone. We should consider sharing the opportunity with a 
partner.”
Finally, while risks and the responses developed to address them may identify potential 
opportunities, pursuing opportunities will often lead to unanticipated risks. This outcome 
is rarely if ever discussed by opportunity proponents, yet it can lead to adverse program 
impacts if the resulting unexpected risks occur.
17.12 MONITOR AND CONTROL RISKS
The monitoring and control process systematically tracks and evalu-
ates the effectiveness of risk response actions against established 
metrics.4 Monitoring results should also be fed back to the prior risk 
management process steps and may also provide a basis for developing additional risk 
response strategies or updating existing risk response strategies and reanalyzing known 
risks. In some cases monitoring results may also be used to identify new facets of an 
existing risk (or new risks) and revise some aspects of risk planning. The key to the risk 
monitoring and control process is to establish a cost, technical performance, and schedule 
management indicator system that the project manager and other key personnel use to 
evaluate the status of the project. The indicator system should be designed to provide early 
warning of potential problems to allow management actions.
Risk monitoring and control is not a problem-solving technique, but rather a proac-
tive technique to obtain objective information on the progress to date in reducing risks to

Risk Management 
acceptable levels. Some techniques suitable for risk monitoring and control that can be 
used in a program-wide indicator system include:
●
●
Earned Value (EV). This uses standard cost/schedule data to evaluate a program’s 
cost performance (and provide an indicator of schedule performance) in an inte-
grated fashion. As such, it provides a basis to determine if risk response actions are 
achieving their forecasted results.
●
●
Program Metrics. These are formal, periodic performance assessments of the 
selected development processes, evaluating how well the development process is 
achieving its objective. This technique can be used to monitor corrective actions 
that emerged from an assessment of critical program processes.
●
●
Schedule Performance Monitoring. This is the use of program schedule data to 
evaluate how well the program is progressing to completion.
●
●
Technical Performance Measurement (TPM). TPM is a product design assess-
ment which estimates, through engineering analysis and tests, the values of essen-
tial technical performance parameters of the current design as effected by risk 
response actions.
The indicator system and periodic reassessments of program risk should provide the 
program with the means to incorporate risk management into the overall project manage-
ment structure. Finally, a well-defined test and evaluation program is often a key element in 
monitoring the performance of selected risk response strategies and updating risk analyses, 
and identifying candidate risks.
17.13 SOME IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS
While it is important to emphasize a comprehensive, structured risk management process, 
it is equally important that that suitable organizational and behavioral considerations exist 
so that the process will be properly implemented. While no single set of guidelines will 
suffice, because implementation considerations vary on a project-by-project basis, it is 
important that risk management roles and responsibilities be defined in the RMP and car-
ried out in the program. For example, you need to decide (in advance) within the project:
●
●
Which group of managers have responsibility for risk management decision 
­making?
●
●
Which group “owns” and maintains the risk management process?
●
●
Which group or individual is responsible for risk management training and assist-
ing others in risk management implementation?
●
●
Who identifies candidate risks? (Everyone should!)
●
●
How are focal points (sometimes termed “owners”) assigned for a particular 
approved risk?
●
●
How are risk analyses performed and approved?
●
●
How are risk response plans developed and approved, including the necessary 
resources for their implementation?

The Use of Lessons Learned
623
●
●
How are data for risk monitoring metrics collected?
●
●
How are independent risk reviews performed to ensure that project risks are prop-
erly identified, analyzed, handled, and monitored?
This is but a brief list of some organizational considerations for implementing risk 
management, which will vary depending upon the size of the project, organizational cul-
ture, degree that effective risk management is already practiced within the organization, 
contractual requirements, and so on. Likewise, while behavioral considerations for effec-
tive risk management will also vary on a project-by-project basis, a few key characteristics 
should apply for all projects.
Risk management must be implemented in both a “top-down” and “bottom-up” man-
ner within the project. The project manager and other decision makers should both use risk 
management principles in decision making and support and encourage all others within the 
project to perform risk management. The project manager should generally not be the risk 
manager (except perhaps on very small projects). However, top-level management must 
both encourage and foster a positive risk management atmosphere within the project. In 
addition, they must actively participate in risk management activities and use risk manage-
ment principles in decision making. Without such active support other project personnel 
will often view risk management as unimportant, and there may be insufficient encour-
agement to create or maintain a culture within the project to embrace risk management. 
Similarly, while it is important for key decision makers within the project to, for example, 
not “shoot the messenger” for reporting risks, eliminating this behavior does not in and of 
itself create a positive environment for performing effective risk management because, as 
mentioned above, a positive atmosphere that is conducive to performing risk management 
(e.g., identifying risks) needs to be in place.
Working-level personnel are generally quick to decide whether or not decision makers 
are committed to risk management, and if the appearance is perceived as lip service, then 
ineffective risk management will almost certainly exist. But working-level personnel must 
also be actively engaged for risk management to be effective, whereby risk management 
principles are assimilated as part of their job function.
A key behavioral goal associated with risk management is not to turn every person on 
the project into a “risk manager” but instead make them sensitive to risk management prin-
ciples and to apply these principles as part of their job. Accomplishing this is often difficult 
but nevertheless important in order to achieve effective risk management.
17.14 THE USE OF LESSONS LEARNED
Risks that are analyzed to be medium or higher must be handled to the extent assets allow 
to reduce their potential to adversely affect the program. All levels of management must be 
sensitive to hidden “traps” that may induce a false sense of security. If properly interpreted, 
these signals really indicate a developing problem in a known area of risk. Each trap is usu-
ally accompanied by several “warning signs” that show an approaching problem and the 
probability of failing to treat the problem at its inception.

624
Risk Management 
The ability to turn traps into advantages suggests that much of the technical risk in a pro-
gram can be actively handled via the risk response avoidance, control, and/or transfer option, 
not merely watched and resolved after a problem occurs. In some instances it may pay to 
watch and wait. If the probability that a certain problem will arise is low or if the cost exceeds 
the benefits of “fixing” the problem before it happens, risk assumption may be advisable. 
Effective risk management makes selection of the risk assumption option a conscious deci-
sion rather than an oversight and may trigger an appropriate addition to the risk “watch list.”
“Best practices” acknowledges that all of the traps have not been identified for each 
risk. The traps are intended to be suggestive, and other potential concerns should be exam-
ined as they arise. It is also important to recognize that sources and types of risk evolve over 
time. Risks may take a long time to occur on a given project. Attention must be properly 
focused to examine risks and lessons learned.
Lessons learned should be documented so that future project managers can learn from 
past mistakes. Experience is an excellent teacher in risk management. Yet, no matter how 
hard we try, risks will occur and projects may suffer.
17.15 DEPENDENCIES BETWEEN RISKS
If project managers had unlimited funding, they could generally iden-
tify a multitude of risk events, both significant and insignificant. With 
a large number of possible risk events, it is impossible to address 
each and every situation, and thus it may be necessary to prioritize risks.
Assume that the project manager categorizes the risks according to the project’s time, 
cost, and performance constraints as illustrated in Figure 17–11. According to the figure, 
the project manager should focus his efforts on reducing the schedule-related risks. How-
ever, it must be recognized that even if schedule has the highest priority, you may also have 
to start work on cost and technical performance-related issues at the same time, but the 
schedule-related issues may have the greatest resources applied.
The prioritization of risks could be established by either the project manager or the 
project sponsor, or even by the customer. The prioritization of risks can also be industry 
specific, or even country specific, as shown in Figure 17–12. It is highly unlikely that 
any project management methodology would dictate the prioritization of risks. A well-
thought-out risk analysis methodology does dictate, or at least reveal, the priority of risks, 
but then project management input may change the resulting priority. It is simply impos-
sible to develop standardization in this area such that the application could be uniformly 
applied to each and every project.
The prioritization of risks for an individual project is a good starting point and 
could work well if most risks were not interrelated. We know from trade-off analy-
sis that changes to a schedule may induce changes in cost and/or performance. The 
changes may not occur in both dimensions because this depends on the objective func-
tions and market constraints of the buyer and seller. Therefore, even though schedules 
have the highest priority in Figure 17–6, risk response to the schedule risk events may 
cause immediate evaluation of the technical performance risk events. Yes, risks are 
interrelated.

The interdependencies between risks can also be seen from Table 17–7. The first 
column identifies certain actions that the project manager can take in pursuit of the pos-
sible benefits listed in column 2. Each of these possible benefits, in turn, can cause addi-
tional risks, as shown in column 3. In other words, risk mitigation strategies that are 
designed to take advantage of a possible benefit could create another risk event that is 
more severe. As an example, working overtime could save you $15,000 by compressing 
the schedule. But if the employees make more mistakes on overtime, retesting may be 
required, additional materials may need to be purchased, and a schedule slippage could

to save $15,000?
To answer this question, we can use the concept of expected value, assuming we 
can determine the probabilities associated with mistakes being made and the cost 
of the mistakes. Without any knowledge of these probabilities, the actions taken to 
achieve the possible benefits would be dependent upon the project manager’s toler-
ance for risk.
Most project management professionals seem to agree that the most serious risks, 
and the ones about which we seem to know the least, are the technical risks. The 
worst situation is to have multiple technical risks that interact in an unpredictable or 
unknown manner.
Although project management methodologies provide a framework for risk man-
agement and the development of a risk management plan, it is highly unlikely that any 
methodology would be sophisticated enough to account for the identification of technical 
dependency risks. The time and cost associated with the identification, analysis, and han-
dling of technical risk dependencies could severely tax the project financially.
As companies become successful in project management, risk management evolves 
into a structured process that is performed continuously throughout the life cycle of the 
project. The four most common factors supporting the need for continuous risk manage-
ment are how long the project lasts, how much money is at stake, the degree of developmen-
tal maturity, and the interdependencies between the different risks. For example, consider 
Boeing’s aircraft projects where designing and delivering a new plane might require ten 
years and a financial investment of more than $5 billion.
Table 17–8 shows the characteristics of risks at Boeing. The table does not mean to 
imply that risks are mutually exclusive of one another. New technologies can appease cus-
tomers, but production risks increase because the learning curve is lengthened with new 
technology compared to accepted technology. The learning curve can be lengthened fur-
ther when features are custom-designed for individual customers. In addition, the loss of 
suppliers over the life of a plane can affect the level of technical and production risk. The 
relationships among these risks require the use of a risk management matrix and continu-
ous risk assessment.

subcontractors without impacting 
cost, schedule, quality, or safety
•	Close working relationships with 
subcontractors
•	A structured change management process
•	Lessons learned from other new airplane 
programs
•	Use of learning curves
Another critical interdependency is the relationship between change management 
and risk management, both of which are part of the singular project management meth-
odology. Each risk management strategy can result in changes that generate additional 
risks. Risks and changes go hand in hand, which is one of the reasons companies usu-
ally integrate risk management and change management into a singular methodology. 
Table 17–9 shows the relationship between managed and unmanaged changes. If changes 
are unmanaged, then more time and money are needed to perform risk management, 
which often takes on the appearance and behavior of crisis management. And what 
makes the situation even worse is that higher-salaried employees and additional time are 
required to assess the additional risks resulting from unmanaged 
changes. Managed changes, on the other hand, allow for a lower-
cost risk management plan to be developed.

Risk Management 
Project management methodologies, no matter how good, cannot accurately define 
the dependencies between risks. It is usually the responsibility of the project team to make 
these determinations.
17.16 THE IMPACT OF RISK HANDLING MEASURES
Most project management methodologies include risk management, 
which can be used to:
●
●
Create an understanding of the potential risks and their effects
●
●
Provide an early warning system when the risk event is imminent
●
●
Provide clear guidance on how to manage and contain the risk event, if possible
●
●
Restore the system/process after the risk event occurs
●
●
Provide a means for escape and rescue should all attempts fail
Some guidance in risk management is necessary because each stakeholder could have 
a different tolerance for risk. Risk and safety system policies, procedures, and guidelines 
exist primarily for the lower three levels in Figure 17–8. The customer’s tolerance for risk 
could be significantly greater or less than the company’s tolerance. Also, based upon the 
project’s requirements, any given project could be willing to accept significantly more or 
less risk than the organizational procedures normally allow.
The project management methodology may very well dictate the magnitude of the risk 
handling measures to be undertaken. The risk handling measures for risk assumption may 
be significantly more complex than measures for avoidance. Figure 17–15 shows the extent 
of the risk handling strategy versus the magnitude of the risks. As the magnitude of the risk 
increases, an overreaction may occur that places undue pressure on the risk management 
process and the project management methodology. The cost of maintaining these risk han-
dling measures should not overly burden the project. Excessive risk management proce-
dures may require that the project manager spend more time and money than appropriate.

The Impact of Risk Handling Measures
629
If an organization goes overboard in its investment in risk management, the results 
can be devastating, as shown in Figure 17–10. Overinvestment in risk management could 
lead to financial disaster if the project’s risk events do not call for substantial measures or 
expenses. However, underinvestment in risk management for a project with numerous and 
complex risk events could lead to heavy losses and damages, possibly leading to project 
failure. Some sort of parity position is needed.
Determining the proper amount of risk control measures is not easy. This can be seen 
from Figure 17–11, which illustrates the impact on the schedule constraint. If too few risk 
handling measures are in place, or if there simply is no risk handling plan, the result may 
be an elongated schedule due to ineffective risk handling measures. If excessive risk han-
dling measures are in place, such as too many filters and gates, the schedule can likewise

be elongated because the workers are spending too much time on contingency planning. 
The same can be said for a risk management process with excessive risk reporting, docu-
mentation, and risk management meetings (i.e., too many gates). This results in very slow 
progress. A proper balance is needed.
Similarly, investing in risk management is not a guarantee that losses and damages will 
be prevented. Figure 17–12 illustrates perfect planning for risk management. The organiza-
tion prepares a primary and possibly secondary risk handling plan for each potential haz-
ard. Unfortunately, real-world planning is often imperfect, as shown in Figure 17–13, and 
some losses and damages may still occur, even for known risk issues.

17.17 RISK AND CONCURRENT ENGINEERING
Most companies desire to get to the marketplace in a timely manner 
because the rewards for being the first-to-market can be huge in both 
profitability and market share. Getting to the marketplace quickly 
often entails using concurrent engineering, or overlapping activities. The critical question 
is, “How much overlapping can we incur before we get diminishing returns?”
The risks involved with overlapping activities are shown in Figure 17–14. Overlapping 
activities can lead to schedule compression and lower costs. However, too much overlap-
ping can lead to excessive rework and unanticipated problems that can generate significant 
schedule slippages and cost overruns. Finding the optimal overlapping point that increases 
benefits while decreasing rework is difficult.
Although there may exist numerous reasons for the rework, two common problems 
are:
●
●
Combining new technology development and product development technology
●
●
An insufficient test and evaluation program
To illustrate why these problems occur, consider a situation where the sales and 
marketing force promises the marketplace a new product with advanced technology that 
hasn’t yet been developed. To compress the schedule, the product development team 
begins designing the product without knowing whether or not (and when) the technology 
can be developed. Production teams are asked to develop manufacturing plans without 
having any drawings. This results in massive changes when the product final reaches 
production.

Risk Management 
There are three questions that need to be continuously addressed:
●
●
Can the new technology be developed?
●
●
Can we demonstrate the new technology within the product?
●
●
Can the product then be manufactured within the time, cost, and performance (i.e., 
reliability) constraints?
Simultaneous development of technologies and products has become commonplace. 
To decrease the risks of rework, there should be a demonstration that the technology can 
work as expected. Leading firms that use concurrent engineering do not include a new 
technology in a product until the technology reaches a prescribed level of maturity. They 
have disciplined processes that match requirements with technological capability before 
product development is launched. These companies have learned the hard lesson of not 
committing to new products that outstrip their technological know-how. These practices 
stem from their recognition that resolving technology problems after product development 
begins can result in a tenfold cost increase; resolving these problems in production could 
increase costs by a hundredfold.
Some commonly accepted practices to reduce risks include:
●
●
Flexibility in both the resources provided and the product’s performance require-
ments to allow for uncertainties of technical progress
●
●
Disciplined paths for technology to be included in products, with strong gatekeep-
ers to decide when to allow it into a product development program
●
●
High standards for judging the maturity of the technology

●
●
The imposition of strict product development cycle times
●
●
Rules concerning how much innovation can be accepted on a product before the 
next generation must be launched (these rules are sometimes referred to as tech-
nology readiness levels)
Collectively, these factors create a healthy environment for developing technology and 
making good decisions on what to include in a product.
Overlapping activities can be very risky if problems are discovered late in the cycle. 
One common mistake is to begin manufacturing before a sufficient quantity of engineering 
drawings is available for review. This normally is the responsibility of systems integration 
personnel. Systems integration should conclude with a critical design review of engineer-
ing drawings and confirmation that the system’s design will meet requirements—a key 
knowledge point. It should also result in firm cost and schedule targets and a final set of 
requirements for the current version of the product. Decision makers should insist on a 
mature design, supported with complete engineering drawings, before proceeding to even 
limited production. Having such knowledge at this point greatly contributes to product suc-
cess and decreases costly rework.

17–2  A telecommunications firm believes that the majority of its income over the next ten years 
will come from organizations outside of the United States. More specifically, the income will come 
from third world nations that may have very little understanding or experience in project manage-
ment. The company prepared Figure 17–15. What causes the increasing risks in Figure 17–15?
17–3  Figure 17–16 shows a probability-impact (or risk mapping) matrix that is frequently 
used as part of the risk analysis prioritization process. Here, ordinal probability-of-occurrence 
and consequence-of-occurrence risk scales are used (5, 4, 3, 2, 1 correspond to E, D, C, B, A 
since the actual scale coefficients are unknown). In this figure, L represents a low risk, which 
would generally be a risk acceptable to the project manager. The letter M represents a moder-
ate risk, which will likely require a risk response. The letter H represents a high risk, which 
will need one or more risk responses. What are the advantages of using a high–­moderate–low 
(or red– yellow–green) risk designation as opposed to assigning quantitative numbers to each 
cell and risk level (e.g., 5 x 5 = 25 to 1 x 1 = 1)?

TELOXY ENGINEERING (B)
Your manufacturing team informs you that they have found a way to increase the size of the 
manufacturing run from 10,000 to 18,000 units in increments of 2000 units. However, the setup 
cost will be $150,000 rather than $100,000 for all production runs greater than 10,000 units and 
defects will cost the same $120 for removal and repair.
QUESTIONS
1.	 Calculate the economic feasibility of make or buy.
2.	 Should the probability of defects change if we produce 18,000 units as opposed to 10,000 units?
3.	 Would your answer to question 1 change if Teloxy management believes that follow-on 
contracts will be forthcoming? What would happen if the probability of defects changes to 15 
percent, 25 percent, 40 percent, 15 percent, and 5 percent due to learning-curve efficiencies?
TELOXY ENGINEERING (A)
Teloxy Engineering has received a one-time contract to design and build 10,000 units of a 
new product. During the proposal process, management felt that the new product could be 
designed and manufactured at a low cost. One of the ingredients necessary to build the product 
was a small component that could be purchased for $60 in the marketplace, including quantity 
discounts. Accordingly, management budgeted $650,000 for the purchasing and handling of 
10,000 components plus scrap.
During the design stage, your engineering team informs you that the final design will re-
quire a somewhat higher-grade component that sells for $72 with quantity discounts. The new 
price is substantially higher than you had budgeted for. This will create a cost overrun.
You meet with your manufacturing team to see if they can manufacture the component at 
a cheaper price than buying it from the outside. Your manufacturing team informs you that they 
can produce a maximum of 10,000 units, just enough to fulfill your contract. The setup cost will 
be $100,000 and the raw material cost is $40 per component. Since Teloxy has never manufac-
tured this product before, manufacturing expects the following defects:
Percent defective

All defective parts must be removed and repaired at a cost of $120 per part.
QUESTIONS
1.	 Using expected value, is it economically better to make or buy the component?
2.	 Strategically thinking, why might management opt for other than the most economical 
choice?

THE RISK MANAGEMENT DEPARTMENT
In 1946, shortly after the end of World War II, Cooper Manufacturing 
Company was created. The company manufactured small appliances for 
the home. By 2010, Cooper Manufacturing had more than thirty manufacturing plants, all located  
in the United States. The business now included both small and large household appliances. 
Almost all of its growth came from acquisitions that were paid for out of cash flow and borrow-
ing from the financial markets.
Cooper’s strategic plan called for global expansion beginning in 2003. With this in mind 
and with large financial reserves, Cooper planned on acquiring five to six companies a year. 
This would be in addition to whatever domestic acquisitions were also available. Almost all of 
the acquisitions were manufacturing companies that produced products related to the household 
marketplace. However, some of the acquisitions included air conditioning and furnace compa-
nies as well as home security systems.
Background
Risk Management Department During the 1980s, when Cooper Manufacturing began its rapid acquisi-
tion approach, it established a Risk Management Department. The Risk 
Management Department reported to the chief financial officer (CFO) and was considered to be 
part of the financial discipline of the company. The overall objective of the Risk Management 
Department was to coordinate the protection of the company’s assets. The primary means by 
which this was done was through the implementation of loss prevention programs. The depart-
ment worked very closely with other internal departments such as Environmental Health and 
Safety. Outside consultants were brought in as necessary to support these activities.
One method employed by the company to ensure the entire company’s cooperation and in-
volvement in the risk management process was to hold each manufacturing division responsible 
for any specific losses up to a designated self-insured retention level. If there was a significant 
loss, the division must absorb the loss and its impact on the division’s bottom-line profit margin. 
This directly involved the division in both loss prevention and claims management. When a 
claim did occur, the Risk Management Department maintained regular contact with the divi-
sion’s personnel to establish protocol on the claim and cash reserves and ultimate disposition.
As part of risk management, the company purchased insurance above the designated re-
tention levels. The insurance premiums were allocated to each division. The premiums were 
calculated based upon sales volume and claims loss history, with the most significant percentage 
being allocated against claims loss history.
Risk management was considered an integral part of the due diligence process for acquisi-
tions and divestitures. It began at the onset of the process rather than at the end and resulted in 
a written report and presentation to the senior levels of management.
A New Risk Materializes
The original intent of the Risk Management Department was to protect the 
company’s assets, especially from claims and lawsuits. The department 
focused heavily upon financial and business risks with often little regard for human assets. All 
of this was about to change.
The majority of Cooper’s manufacturing processes were labor-intensive assembly line 
processes. Although Cooper modernized the plants with new equipment to support the as-
sembly lines with hope of speeding up the work, the processes were still heavily labor 
intensive.

Risk Management 
Ergonomics includes the fundamentals for the flexible workplace vari-
ability and compatibility with desk components that flex from individual 
work activities to team settings. Workstations provide supportive ergonomics for task-intensive 
environments. Outside the discipline, the term “ergonomics” is generally used to refer to physi-
cal ergonomics as it relates to the workplace (as in, e.g., ergonomic chairs and keyboards). Er-
gonomics in the workplace has to do largely with the safety of employees, both long and short 
term. Ergonomics can help reduce costs by improving safety. This would decrease the money 
paid out in workers’ compensation. For example, over five million workers sustain overexten-
sion injuries per year. Through ergonomics, workplaces can be designed so that workers do not 
have to overextend themselves and the manufacturing industry could save billions in workers’ 
compensation. Workplaces may either take the reactive or proactive approach when applying 
ergonomics practices. Reactive ergonomics is when something needs to be fixed and corrective 
action is taken. Proactive ergonomics is the process of seeking areas that could be improved and 
fixing the issues before they become a large problem. Problems may be fixed through equipment 
design, task design, or environmental design. Equipment design changes the actual, physical de-
vices used by people. Task design changes what people do with the equipment. Environmental 
design changes the environment in which people work but not the physical equipment they use.
QUESTIONS
1.	 Was the original intent of creating the Risk Management Department correct in that it was 
designed to protect corporate assets? In other words, was this really risk management?
2.	 Are the new responsibilities of the department, specifically ergonomics, a valid interpretation 
of risk management?
3.	 Can the lowering of health care costs and workers’ compensation costs be considered as a 
project?
4.	 How successful do you think Cooper was in lowering costs?

18.0 INTRODUCTION
Competitive bidding has become an integral part of the project man-
agement responsibility in many industries. A multitude of estimating 
techniques are available in such fields as construction, aerospace, and 
defense to assist project managers in arriving at a competitive bid. If the final bid is too high, the company 
may not be competitive. If the bid is too low, the company may have to incur the cost of the overrun out of 
its own pocket. For a small firm, this overrun could lead to financial disaster. 
Perhaps the most difficult projects to estimate are those that involve the development and manufactur-
ing of a large quantity of units. As an example, a company is asked to bid on the development and manu-
facture of 15,000 components. The company is able to develop a cost for the manufacture of its first unit, 
but what will be the cost for the 10th, 100th, 1,000th, or 10,000th unit? Obviously, the production cost of 
each successive unit should be less than the previous unit, but by how much? Fortunately there exist highly 
accurate estimating techniques referred to as “learning” or “experience” curves.
18.1 GENERAL THEORY
Experience curves are based on the old adage that practice makes perfect. A product can 
always be manufactured better and in a shorter time period not only the second time, but 
each succeeding time. This concept is highly applicable to labor-intensive projects, such 
as those in manufacturing where labor forecasting has been a tedious and time-consuming 
effort.
It wasn’t until the 1960s that the true implications of experience curves became evi-
dent. Personnel from the Boston Consulting Group showed that each time cumulative pro-
duction doubled, the total manufacturing time and cost fell by a constant and predictable

amount. Furthermore, the Boston Consulting Group showed that this effect extended to a 
variety of industries such as chemicals, metals, and electronic components.
Today’s executives often measure the profitability of a corporation as a function of 
market share. As market share increases, profitability will increase, more because of lower 
production costs than increased margins. This is the experience curve effect. Large mar-
ket shares allow companies to build large manufacturing plants so that the fixed capital 
costs are spread over more units, thus lowering the unit cost. This increase in efficiency 
is referred to as economies of scale and may be the main reason why large manufacturing 
organizations may be more efficient than smaller ones.
Capital equipment costs follow the rule of six-tenths power of capacity. As an exam-
ple, consider a plant that has the capacity of producing 35,000 units each year. The plant’s 
construction cost was $10 million. If the company wishes to build a new plant with a capac-
ity of 70,000 units, what will the construction cost be?

Solving for $ new, we find that the new plant will cost approximately $15 million, or 
one and one-half times the cost of the old plant. (For a more accurate determination, the 
costs must be adjusted for inflation.)
18.2 THE LEARNING CURVE CONCEPT
Learning curves stipulate that manufacturing man-hours (specifically direct labor) will 
decline each time a company doubles its output. Typically, learning curves produce a cost 
and time savings of 10 to 30 percent each time a company’s experience at producing a 
product doubles. As an example, consider the data shown in Table 18–1, which represents 
a company operating on a 75 percent learning curve. The time for the second unit is 75 
percent of the time of the first unit. The time for the fortieth unit is 75 percent of the time 
for the twentieth unit. The time for the 800th unit is 75 percent of the time for the 400th 
unit. Likewise, we can forecast the time for the 1,000th unit as being 75 percent of the time 
for the 500th unit. In this example, the time decreased by a fixed amount of 25 percent. 
Theoretically, this decrease could occur indefinitely.
In Table 18–1, we could have replaced the man-hours per production unit with the cost 
per production unit. It is more common to use man-hours because exact costs are either 
not always known or not publicly disclosed by the firm. Also, the use of costs implies the 
added complexity of considering escalation factors on salary, cost of living adjustments, 
and possibly the time value of money. For projects under a year or two, costs are often used 
instead of man-hours.
These types of costs are often referred to as value-added costs, and can also appear in 
the form of lower freight and procurement costs through bulk quantities. The value-added 
costs are actually cost savings for both the customer and contractor.

The Learning Curve Concept
645
The learning curve was adapted from the historical observation that individuals per-
forming repetitive tasks exhibit an improvement in performance as the task is repeated a 
number of times. Empirical studies of this phenomenon yielded three conclusions on which 
the current theory and practice are based:
●
●
The time required to perform a task decreases as the task is repeated.
●
●
The amount of improvement decreases as more units are produced.
●
●
The rate of improvement has sufficient consistency to allow its use as a prediction tool.
The consistency in improvement has been found to exist in the form of a constant 
percentage reduction in time required over successive doubled quantities of units produced.
It’s important to recognize the significance of using the learning curve for manu-
facturing projects. Consider a project where 75 percent of the total direct labor is in 
assembly (such as aircraft assembly) and the remaining 25 percent is machine work. 
With direct labor, learning improvements are possible, whereas with machine work, 
output may be restricted due to the performance of the machine. In the above example, 
with 75 percent direct labor and 25 percent machine work, a company may find itself 
performing on an 80 percent learning curve. But, if the direct labor were 25 percent and 
the machine work were 75 percent, then the company may find itself on a 90 percent 
learning curve.

18.3 GRAPHIC REPRESENTATION
Figure 18–1 shows the learning curve plotted from the data in Table 18–1. The horizon-
tal axis represents the total number of units produced. The vertical axis represents the 
total labor hours (or cost) for each unit. The labor-hour graph in Figure 18–1 represents a 
hyperbola when drawn on an ordinary rectangular coordinates graph. The curve shows that 
the difference or amount of labor-hour reduction is not consistent. Rather, it declines by a 
continuously diminishing amount as the quantities are doubled. But the rate of change or 
decline has been found to be a constant percentage of the prior cost, because the decline in 
the base figure is proportionate to the decline in the amount of change. To illustrate this, we 
can use the data in Table 18–1, which was used to construct Figure 18–1. In doubling pro-
duction from the first to the second unit, a reduction of 203 hours occurs. In doubling from 
100 to 200 units, a reduction of 30 hours occurs. However in both cases, the percentage 
decrease was 25 percent. Again, in going from 400 to 800 units, a 25 percent reduction of 
17 hours results. We can therefore conclude that, as more units are produced, the rate of 
change remains constant but the magnitude of the change diminishes.
When the data from Figure 18–1 are plotted on logarithmic graph, the result is a 
straight line, which represents the learning curve as shown in Figure 18–2.
There are two fundamental models of the learning curve in general use; the unit curve 
and the cumulative average curve. Both are shown in Figure 18–2. The unit curve focuses 
on the hours or cost involved in specific units of production. The theory can be stated as fol-
lows: As the total quantity of units produced doubles, the cost per unit decreases by some 
constant percentage. The constant percentage by which the costs of doubled quantities 
decrease is called the rate of learning.

Key Words Associated with Learning Curves
647
The “slope” of the learning curve is related to the rate of learning. It is the difference 
between 100 percent and the rate of learning. For example, if the hours between doubled 
quantities are reduced by 20 percent (rate of learning), it would be described as a curve 
with an 80 percent slope.
To plot a straight line, one must know either two points or one point and the slope of 
the line. Generally speaking, the latter is more common. The question is whether the com-
pany knows the man-hours for the first unit or uses a projected number of man-hours for a 
target or standard unit to be used for pricing purposes.
The cumulative average curve in Figure 18–2 can be obtained from columns 1 and 3 
in Table 18–1. Dividing column 3 by column 1, we find that the average hours for the first 
100 units is 196 hours. For 200 units, the average is 149 hours. This becomes important in 
determining the cost for a manufacturing project.
18.4 KEY WORDS ASSOCIATED WITH LEARNING CURVES
Understanding a few key phrases will help in utilizing learning curve theory:
●
●
Slope of the curve: A percentage figure that represents the steepness (constant rate 
of improvement) of the curve. Using the unit curve theory, this percentage repre-
sents the value (e.g., hours or cost) at a doubled production quantity in relation to 
the previous quantity. For example, with an experience curve having 80 percent 
slope, the value of unit two is 80 percent of the value of unit one, the value of unit 
four is 80 percent of the value at unit two, the value at unit 1,000 is 80 percent of 
the value of unit 500, and so on.

●
●
Unit one: The first unit of product actually completed during a production run. 
This is not to be confused with a unit produced in any reproduction phase of the 
overall acquisition program.
●
●
Cumulative average hours: The average hours expended per unit for all units pro-
duced through any given unit. When illustrated on a graph by a line drawn through 
each successive unit, the values form a cumulative average curve.
●
●
Unit hours: The total direct labor hours expended to complete any specific unit. 
When a line is drawn on a graph through the values for each successive unit, the 
values form a unit curve.
●
●
Cumulative total hours: The total hours expended for all units produced through 
any given unit. The data plotted on a graph with each point connected by a line 
form a cumulative total curve.

cumulative average from the following formula:

where

Sometimes companies do not know the time for the first unit. Instead, they assume a 
target unit and accompanying target man-hours. As an example, consider a company that 
assumes that the standard for performance will be the 100th unit, which is targeted for 120 
man-hours, and performs on a 75 percent learning curve. Solving for T1 we have:

From Table 18–1, the cumulative average for the 250th unit is 34,170 man-hours 
divided by 250, or 137 hours. We must remember that the above expression is merely an 
approximation. Significant errors can occur using this expression for fewer than 100 units. 
For large values of X, the error becomes insignificant.
It is possible to use the learning curve equation to develop Table 18–2, which shows 
typical cost reductions due to increased experience. Suppose that the production level is 
quadrupled and you are performing on an 80 percent learning curve. Using Table 18–2, the 
costs will be reduced by 36 percent.
18.6 SOURCES OF EXPERIENCE
There are several factors that contribute to the learning curve phenomenon. None of the 
factors performs entirely independently, but are interrelated through a complex network. 
However, for simplicity’s sake, these factors will be sorted out for discussion purposes.

650
Learning Curves 
●
●
Labor efficiency: This is the most common factor, which says that we learn more 
each time we repeat a task. As we learn, the time and cost of performing the task 
should diminish. As the employee learns the task, less managerial supervision is 
required, waste and inefficiency can be reduced or even eliminated, and productiv-
ity will increase.
Unfortunately, labor efficiency does not occur automatically. Personnel management 
policies in the area of workforce stability and worker compensation are of vital impor-
tance. As workers mature and become more efficient, it becomes increasingly important 
to maintain this pool of skilled labor. Loss of a contract or interruption between contracts 
could force employees to seek employment elsewhere. In certain industries, like aerospace 
and defense, engineers are often regarded as migratory workers moving from contract to 
contract and company to company.
Upturns and downturns in the economy can have a serious impact on maintaining 
experience curves. During downturns in the economy, people work more slowly, trying to 
preserve their jobs. Eventually the company is forced into a position of having to reassign 
people to other activities or to lay people off. During upturns in the economy, massive 
training programs may be needed in order to accelerate the rate of learning.
If an employee is expected to get the job done in a shorter period of time, then the 
employee expects to be adequately compensated. Wage incentives can produce either a 
positive or negative effect based on how they are applied. Learning curves and productivity 
can become a bargaining tool by labor as it negotiates for greater pay.
Fixed compensation plans generally do not motivate workers to produce more. If an 
employee is expected to produce more at a lower cost, then the employee expects to receive 
part of the cost savings as either added compensation or fringe benefits.
The learning effect goes beyond the labor directly involved in manufacturing. Mainte-
nance personnel, supervisors, and persons in other line and staff manufacturing positions

also increase their productivity, as do people in marketing, sales, administration, and other 
functions.
●
●
Work specialization and methods improvements:1 Specialization increases worker 
proficiency at a given task. Consider what happens when two workers, who for-
merly did both parts of a two-stage operation, each specialize in a single stage. 
Each worker now handles twice as many items and accumulates experience twice 
as fast on the more specialized task. Redesign of work operations (methods) can 
also result in greater efficiency.
●
●
New production processes: Process innovations and improvements can be an 
important source of cost reductions, especially in capital-intensive industries. 
The low-labor-content semiconductor industry, for instance, achieves experience 
curves at 70 percent to 80 percent from improved production technology by devot-
ing a large percentage of its research and development to process improvements. 
Similar process improvements have been observed in refineries, nuclear power 
plants, and steel mills, to mention a few.
●
●
Getting better performance from production equipment: When first designed, a piece 
of production equipment may have a conservatively rated output. Experience may 
reveal innovative ways of increasing its output. For instance, capacity of a fluid cata-
lytic cracking unit typically “grows” by about 50 percent over a ten-year period.2
●
●
Changes in the resource mix: As experience accumulates, a producer can often 
incorporate different or less expensive resources in the operation. For instance, 
less skilled workers can replace skilled workers or automation can replace labor.
●
●
Product standardization: Standardization allows the replication of tasks necessary 
for worker learning. Even when flexibility and/or a wider product line are important 
marketing considerations, standardization can be achieved by modularization. For 
example, by making just a few types of engines, transmissions, chassis, seats, body 
styles, and so on, an auto manufacturer can achieve experience effects due to special-
ization in each part. These in turn can be assembled into a wide variety of models.
●
●
Product redesign: As experience is gained with a product, both the manufac-
turer and customers gain a clear understanding of its performance requirements. 
This understanding allows the product to be redesigned to conserve material, 
allow greater efficiency in manufacture, and substitute less costly materials and 
resources, while at the same time improving performance on relevant dimensions.
●
●
Incentives and disincentives: Compensation plans and other sources of experience 
can be both incentives and disincentives. Incentives can change the slope of the 
learning curve, as shown in Figure 18–3. This is referred to as a “toe-down” learn-
ing curve where a more favorable learning process can occur. In Figure 18–4, we 
have a “toe-up,” or “scallop,” learning curve, which is the result of disincentives. 
After the toe-up occurs, the learning curve may have a new slope that was not as 
favorable as the original slope.

Developing Slope Measures
653
Worker dissatisfaction can also create a leveling off of the learning curve, as shown 
in Figure 18–5. This leveling off can also occur as a result of inefficiencies due to closing 
out of a production line or transferring workers to other activities at the end of a contract.
18.7 DEVELOPING SLOPE MEASURES
Research by the Stanford Research Institute revealed that many different slopes were expe-
rienced by different manufacturers, sometimes on similar manufacturing programs. In fact, 
manufacturing data collected from the World War II aircraft manufacturing industry had 
slopes ranging from 69.7 percent to almost 100 percent. These slopes averaged 80 percent, 
giving rise to an industry average curve of 80 percent. Other research has developed meas-
ures for other industries, such as 95.6 percent for a sample of 162 electronics programs. 
Unfortunately, this industry average curve is frequently misapplied by practitioners, who 
use it as a standard or norm. When estimating slopes without the benefit of data from the 
plant of the manufacturer, it is better to use learning curve slopes from similar items at the 
manufacturer’s plant rather than the industry average.
The analyst needs to know the slope of the learning curve for a number of reasons. 
One is to facilitate communication, because it is part of the language of the learning curve 
theory. The steeper the slope (lower the percent), the more rapidly the resource require-
ments (hours) will decline as production increases. Accordingly, the slope of the learning 
curve is usually an issue in production contract negotiation. The slope of the learning curve

is also needed to project follow-on costs, using either learning tables or a computer. Also, a 
given slope may be established as a standard based on reliable historical experience. Learn-
ing curves developed from actual experience on current production can then be compared 
against this standard slope to determine whether the improvement on a particular contract 
is or is not reasonable.
18.8 UNIT COSTS AND USE OF MIDPOINTS
The use of the learning curve is dependent on the methods of recording costs that com-
panies employ. An accounting or statistical record system must be devised by a company 
so that data are available for learning curve purposes. Otherwise, it may be impossible to 
construct a learning curve. Costs, such as labor hours per unit or dollars per unit, must be 
identified with the unit of product. It is preferable to use labor hours rather than dollars, 
because the latter contain an additional variable—the effect of inflation or deflation (both 
wage-rate and material cost changes)—that the former does not contain. In any event, the 
record system must have definite cutoff points for such costs permitting identification of 
the costs with the units involved. Most companies use a lot-release system, whereby costs 
are accumulated on a job order in which the number of units completed are specified and 
the costs are cut off at the completion of the number of units. In this case, however, the 
costs are usually equated with equivalent units rather than actual units. Because the job 
order system is commonly used, the unit cost is not the actual cost per unit in the lot. This 
means that when lots are plotted on graph paper, the unit value corresponding with the 
average cost value must be found.
18.9 SELECTION OF LEARNING CURVES
Existing experience curves, by definition, reflect past experience. Trend lines are developed 
from accumulated data plotted on logarithmic paper (preferably) and “smoothed out” to 
portray the curve. The type of curve may represent one of several concepts. The data may 
have been accumulated by product, process, department, or by other functional or organi-
zational segregations, depending on the needs of the user. But whichever experience curve 
concept or method of data accumulation is selected for use, based on suitability to the 
experience pattern, the data should be applied consistently in order to render meaningful 
information to management. Consistency in curve concept and data accumulation cannot 
be overemphasized, because existing experience curves play a major role in determining 
the project experience curve for a new item or product.
When selecting the proper curve for a new production item when only one point of 
data is available and the slope is unknown, the following, in decreasing order of magnitude, 
should be considered.
●
●
Similarity between the new item and an item or items previously produced.
●
●
Physical comparisons
●
●
Addition or deletion of processes and components

Follow-on Orders
655
●
●
Differences in material, if any
●
●
Effect of engineering changes in items previously produced
●
●
Duration of time since a similar item was produced
●
●
Condition of tooling and equipment
●
●
Personnel turnover
●
●
Changes in working conditions or morale
●
●
Other comparable factors between similar items
●
●
Delivery schedules
●
●
Availability of material and components
●
●
Personnel turnover during production cycle of item previously produced
●
●
Comparison of actual production data with previously extrapolated or theo-
retical curves to identify deviations
It is feasible to assign weights to these factors as well as to any other factors that are of 
a comparable nature in an attempt to quantify differences between items. These factors are 
again historical in nature and only comparison of several existing curves and their actuals 
would reveal the importance of these factors.
If at least two points of data are available, the slope of the curve may be determined. 
Naturally the distance between these two points must be considered when evaluating the 
reliability of the slope. The availability of additional points of data will enhance the reli-
ability of the curve. Regardless of the number of points and the assumed reliability of 
the slope, comparisons with similar items are considered the most desirable approach and 
should be made whenever possible.
A value for unit one may be arrived at either by accumulation of data or statistical 
derivation. When production is underway, available data can be readily plotted, and the 
curve may be extrapolated to a desired unit. However, if production has yet to be started, 
actual unit-one data would not be available, and a theoretical unit-one value would have to 
be developed. This may be accomplished in one of three ways:
●
●
A statistically derived relationship between the preproduction unit hours and first 
unit hours can be applied to the actual hours from the preproduction phase.
●
●
A cost estimating relationship (CER) for first-unit cost based on physical or per-
formance parameters can be used to develop a first-unit cost estimate.
●
●
The slope and the point at which the curve and the labor standard value converge 
are known. In this case, a unit-one value can be determined. This is accomplished 
by dividing the labor standard by the appropriate unit value.
18.10 FOLLOW-ON ORDERS
Once the initial experience curve has been developed for either the initial order or produc-
tion run, the values through the last unit on the cumulative average and unit curves can be 
determined. Follow-on orders and continuations of production runs, which are considered 
extensions of the original orders or runs, are plotted as extensions on the appropriate curve.

Learning Curves 
However, the cumulative average value through the final point of the extended curve is not 
the cumulative average for the follow-on portion of that curve. It is the cumulative average 
for both portions of the curve, assuming no break in production. Thus estimating the cost 
for the follow-on effort only requires evaluation of the differences between cumulative 
average costs for the initial run and the follow-on. Likewise, the last-unit value for both 
portions of the unit curve would represent the last-unit value for the combined curve.
18.11 MANUFACTURING BREAKS
The manufacturing break is the time lapse between the completion of an order or manu-
facturing run of certain units of equipment and the commencement of a follow-on order or 
restart of a manufacturing run for identical units. This time lapse disrupts the continuous 
flow of manufacturing and constitutes a definite cost impact. The time lapse under discus-
sion here pertains to significant periods of time (weeks and months), as opposed to the 
minutes or hours for personnel allowances, machine delays, power failures, and the like.
It is logical to assume that because the experience curve has a time-cost relationship, a 
break will affect both time and cost. Therefore, the length of the break becomes as signifi-
cant as the length of the initial order or manufacturing run. Because the break is quantifi-
able, the remaining factor to be determined is the cost of this lapse in manufacturing (that 
is, the additional cost incurred over and above that which would have been incurred had 
either the initial order or the run continued through the duration of the follow-on order or 
the restarted run).
When a manufacturer relies on experience curves as management information tools, 
it can be assumed that the necessary, accurate data for determining the initial curves have 
been accumulated, recorded, and properly validated. Therefore, if the manufacturer has 
experienced breaks, the experience curve data for the orders (lots) or runs involved should 
be available in such form that appropriate curves can be developed.
18.12 LEARNING CURVE LIMITATIONS
There are limitations to the use of learning curves, and care must be taken to avoid errone-
ous conclusions. Typical limitations include:
●
●
The learning curve does not continue forever. The percentage decline in hours/
dollars diminishes over time.
●
●
The learning curve knowledge gained on one product may not be extendable to 
other products unless there exist shared experiences.
●
●
Cost data may not be readily available in order to construct a meaningful learning 
curve. Other problems can occur if overhead costs are included with the direct 
labor cost, or if the accounting codes cannot separate work packages sufficiently in 
order to identify those elements that truly demonstrate experience effects.

Competitive Weapon
657
●
●
Quantity discounts can distort the costs and the perceived benefits of learning 
curves.
●
●
Inflation must be expressed in constant dollars. Otherwise, the gains realized from 
experience may be neutralized.
●
●
Learning curves are most useful on long-term horizons (i.e., years). On short-term 
horizons, benefits perceived may not be the result of learning curves.
●
●
External influences, such as limitations on materials, patents, or even government 
regulations, can restrict the benefits of learning curves.
●
●
Constant annual production (i.e., no growth) may have a limiting experience effect 
after a few years.
18.13 COMPETITIVE WEAPON
Learning curves are a strong competitive weapon, especially in developing a pricing strat-
egy. The actual pricing strategy depends on the product life-cycle stage, the firm’s market 
position, the competitor’s available resources and market position, the time horizon, and 
the firm’s financial position.
From a project management perspective, learning curve pricing can be a competitive 
weapon. As an example, consider a company that is burdened at $60/hour and is bidding on 
a job to produce 500 units. Let us assume that the data in Table 18–1 apply. For 500 units 
of production, the cumulative total hours are 51,704, giving us an average rate of 103.4 
hours per unit. The cost for the job would be 51,704 hours 3 $60/hour, or $3,102,240. If the 
target profit is 10 percent, then the final bid should be $3,412,464. This includes a profit 
of $310,224.
Even though a 10 percent profit is projected, the actual profit may be substantially 
less. Each product is priced out an average of 103.4 hours/unit. The first unit, however, 
will require 812 hours. The company will lose 708.6 hours 3 $60/hour, or $42,516, on the 
first unit produced. The 100th unit will require 120 hours, giving us a loss of $996 (i.e., 
[120 hours 2 103.4 hours] 3 $60/hour). Profit will begin when the 150th unit is produced, 
because the hours required to produce the 150th unit are less than the average hour per unit 
of 103.4.
Simply stated, the first 150 units are a drain on cash flow. The cash-flow drain may 
require the company to “borrow” money to finance operations until the 150th unit is pro-
duced, thus lowering the target profit.

PROBLEMS
18–1  When a learning curve is plotted on a rectangular coordinates graph, the curve appears 
to level off. But when the curve is plotted on a logarithmic graph, it appears that the improve-
ments can go on forever. How do you account for the difference? Can the improvements occur 
indefinitely? If not, what factors could limit continuous improvement?
18–2  A company is performing on an 85 percent learning curve. If the first unit requires 620 
hours, how much time will be required for the 300th unit?
18–3  A company working on a 75 percent learning curve has decided that the production 
standard should be 85 hours of production for the 100th unit. How much time should be re-
quired for the first unit? If the first unit requires more hours than you anticipated, does this mean 
that the learning curve is wrong?
18–4  A company has just received a contract for 700 units of a certain product. The pricing 
department has predicted that the first unit should require 2,250 hours. The pricing department 
believes that a 75 percent learning curve is justified. If the actual learning curve is 77 percent, 
how much money has the company lost? Assume that a fully burdened hour is $65. What per-
centage error in total hours results from a 2 percent increase in learning curve percentage?
18–5  If the first unit of production requires 1,200 hours and the 150th unit requires 315 hours, 
then what learning curve is the company performing at?
18–6  A company has decided to bid on a follow-on contract for 500 units of a product. The 
company has already produced 2,000 units on a 75 percent learning curve. The 2000th unit re-
quires 80 hours of production time. If a fully burdened hour is $80 and the company wishes to 
generate a 12 percent profit, how much should be bid?
18–7  Referring to question 18–6, how many units of the follow-on contract must be produced 
before a profit is realized?
18–8  A manufacturing company wishes to enter a new market. By the end of next year, the 
market leader will have produced 16,000 units on an 80 percent learning curve, and the year-end 
price is expected to be $475/unit. Your manufacturing personnel tell you that the first unit will 
require $7,150 to produce and, with the new technology you have developed, you should be able 
to perform at a 75 percent learning curve. How many units must you produce and sell over the 
next year in order to compete with the leader at $475/unit at year end? Is your answer realistic, 
and what assumptions have you made?
18–9  Rylon Corporation is an assembler of electrical components. The company estimates 
that for the next year, the demand will be 800 units. The company is performing on an 80 
percent learning curve. The company is considering purchasing some assembly machinery 
to accelerate the assembly time. Most assembly activities are 85–90 percent labor intensive. 

660
Learning Curves 
­However, with the new machinery, the assembly activities will be only 25–45 percent labor 
intensive. If the company purchases and installs the new equipment, it will occur after the 200th 
unit is produced. Therefore, the remaining 600 units will be produced with the new equipment. 
The 200th unit will require 620 hours of assembly. However, the 201st unit will require only 400 
hours of assembly but on a 90 percent learning curve.
A.	 Will the new machine shorten product assembly time for all 800 units and, if so, by how 
many hours?
B.	 If the company is burdened by $70 per hour, and the new equipment is depreciated over 
five years, what is the most money that the company should pay for the new equipment? 
What assumptions have you made?

19.0 INTRODUCTION
In general, companies provide services or products based on the 
requirements set forth in invitations for competitive bids issued by 
the client or the results of direct contract negotiations with the cli-
ent. One of the most important factors in preparing a proposal and 
estimating the cost and profit of a project is the type of contract expected. The confidence by which a bid is 
prepared is usually dependent on how much of a risk the contractor will incur through the contract. Certain 
types of contracts provide relief for the contractor since onerous risks1 exist. The cost must therefore con-
sider how well the contract type covers certain high- and low-risk areas. 
Prospective clients are always concerned when, during a competitive bidding process, one bid is much 
lower than the others. The client may question the validity of the bid and whether the contract can be 
achieved for the low bid. In cases such as this, the client usually imposes incentive and penalty clauses in 
the contract for self-protection.
Because of the risk factor, competitors must negotiate not only for the target cost figures but also for 
the type of contract involved since risk protection is the predominant influential factor. The size and experi-
ence of the client’s own staff, urgency of completion, availability of qualified contractors, and other factors 
must be carefully evaluated. The advantages and disadvantages of all basic contractual arrangements must 
be recognized to select the optimum arrangement for a particular project.

Contract Management 
19.1 PROCUREMENT
Procurement can be defined as the acquisition of goods or services. 
Procurement (and contracting) is a process that involves two parties 
with different objectives who interact on a given market segment. 
Good procurement practices can increase corporate profitability by 
taking advantage of quantity discounts, minimizing cash flow prob-
lems, and seeking out high-quality suppliers. Because procurement 
contributes to profitability, procurement is often centralized, which results in standardized 
practices and lower paperwork costs.
All procurement strategies are frameworks by which an organization attains its objec-
tives. There are two basic procurement strategies:
●
●
Corporate Procurement Strategy: The relationship of specific procurement 
actions to the corporate strategy. An example of this would be centralized procure-
ment.
●
●
Project Procurement Strategy: The relationship of specific procurement actions 
to the operating environment of the project. An example of this would be when the 
project manager is allowed to perform sole source procurement without necessar-
ily involving the centralized procurement group, such as purchasing one ounce of 
a special chemical for an R&D project.
Project procurement strategies can differ from corporate procurement strategies 
because of constraints, availability of critical resources, and specific customer require-
ments. Corporate strategies might promote purchasing small quantities from several quali-
fied vendors, whereas project strategies may dictate sole source procurement.
Procurement planning usually involves the selection of one of the following as the 
primary objective:
●
●
Procure all goods/services from a single source.
●
●
Procure all goods/services from multiple sources.
●
●
Procure only a small portion of the goods/services.
●
●
Procure none of the goods/services.
Another critical factor is the environment in which procurement 
must take place. There are two environments: macro and micro. The 
macro environment includes the general external variables that can 
influence how and when we do procurement. The PMBOK® Guide 
refers to this as “Enterprise Environmental Factors.” These include recessions, inflation, 
cost of borrowing money, whether a buyer or seller’s market exists, and unemployment. As 
an example, a foreign corporation had undertaken a large project that involved the hiring 
of several contractors. Because of the country’s high unemployment rate, the decision was 
made to use only domestic suppliers/contractors and to give first preference to contractors 
in cities where unemployment was the greatest, even though there were other more quali-
fied suppliers/contractors.

Procurement
663
The microenvironment is the internal procurement processes of the firm, especially the 
policies and procedures imposed by the firm, project, or client in the way that procurement 
will take place. This includes the procurement/contracting system, which contains four 
processes according to the PMBOK® Guide, Sixth Edition:
●
●
Plan Procurements
●
●
Conduct Procurements
●
●
Administer Procurements
●
●
Close Procurements
It is important to understand that, in certain environments such as major projects 
for the Department of Defense (DoD), the contracting process is used as the vehicle for 
transitioning the project from one life-cycle phase to the next. For example, a contract can 
be awarded for the design, development, and testing of an advanced jet aircraft engine. The 
contract is completed when the aircraft engine testing is completed. If the decision is made 
at the phase gate review to proceed to aircraft engine production, the contracting process 
will be reinitiated for the new effort. Thus, the above four PMBOK® Guide processes would 
be repeated for each life-cycle phase. As the project progresses from one phase to the next, 
and additional project knowledge is acquired through each completed phase, the level of 
uncertainty (and risk) is reduced. The reduction in project risk allows the use of lower-
risk contracts throughout the project life cycle. During higher-risk project phases such as 
conceptual, development, and testing, cost-type contracts are traditionally used. During the 
lower-risk project phases such as production and sustainment, fixed-priced contracts are 
typically used.
It is also important to note that the above four PMBOK® Guide processes focus only 
on the buyer’s side of contract management.
Contract management is defined as “art and science of managing a contractual agree-
ment throughout the contracting process.”2 Since contracts involve at least two parties—the 
buyer and the seller (contractor)—contract management processes are performed by both 
the buyer and seller. The seller’s contract management processes, which correspond to the 
buyer’s processes, consist of the following activities3:
●
●
Presales Activity: The process of identifying prospective and current customers, 
determining customer’s needs and plans, and evaluating the competitive environment.
●
●
Bid/No Bid Decision Making: The process of evaluating the buyer’s solicitation, 
assessing the competitive environment and risks against the opportunities of a 
potential business deal, and then deciding whether to proceed.
●
●
Bid/Proposal Preparation: The process of developing offers in response to a 
buyer’s solicitation or based on perceived buyer needs, for the purpose of persuad-
ing the buyer to enter into a contract.

VA: National Contract Management Association, 2005), p. 270.
3 See note 2.

664
Contract Management 
●
●
Contract Negotiation and Formation: The process of reaching a common 
understanding of the nature of the project and negotiating the contract terms 
and conditions for the purpose of developing a set of shared expectations and 
understandings.
●
●
Contract Administration: The process of ensuring that each party’s performance 
meets contractual requirements.
●
●
Contract Closeout: The process of verifying that all administrative matters are 
concluded on a contract that is otherwise physically complete. This involves com-
pleting and settling the contract, including resolving any open items.
As can be seen from the previous discussion, the last two phases of the seller’s contract 
management processes are identical to the buyer’s contract management processes. This is 
because the buyer and seller are both performing the same contract management activities 
and working off of the same contract document.
19.2 PLAN PROCUREMENTS
The first step in the procurement process is the planning for purchases 
and acquisitions, specifically the development of a procurement plan 
that states what to procure, when, and how. This process includes the 
following:
●
●
Defining the need for the project
●
●
Development of the procurement statement of work, specifications, and work 
breakdown structure
●
●
Preparing a WBS dictionary, if necessary
●
●
Performing a make or buy analysis
●
●
Laying out the major milestones and the timing/schedule
●
●
Determining if long lead procurement is necessary
●
●
Cost estimating, including life-cycle costing
●
●
Determining whether qualified sellers exist
●
●
Identifying the source selection criteria
●
●
Preparing a listing of possible project/procurement risks (i.e., a risk register)
●
●
Developing a procurement plan
●
●
Obtaining authorization and approval to proceed
There could be separate and different statements of work for each 
product to be procured. The statement of work (SOW) is a narrative 
description of the work to be accomplished and/or the resources to be 
supplied. The identification of resources to be supplied has taken on 
paramount importance during the last 10 years or so. During the 1970s and 1980s, small 
companies were bidding on megajobs only to subcontract out more than 99 percent of all of 
the work. Lawsuits were abundant and the solution was to put clauses in the SOW requiring

Work

that the contractor identify the names and resumes of the talented internal resources that 
would be committed to the project, including the percentage of their time on the project. In 
addition to SOWs, organizations also use statements of objectives (SOOs) for projects that 
are designed as “performance-based” effort. Performance-based projects are now the prefer-
ence in the federal government. SOOs are used when the procuring organization wants to 
leverage the advanced technologies, capabilities, and expertise of the potential contractors in 
the marketplace. Instead of using a SOW, which describes in specific detail to the contractor 
what work needs to be performed and how it should be performed, the SOO only describes 
the end objectives of the project (what are the project’s end objectives). In response to a 
solicitation containing a SOO, the potential contractors develop and propose their own SOW 
that provides the detailed specifics on how they intend to perform the work. The source 
selection process entails comparing the various contractor-developed SOWs, each contrac-
tor applying its own unique technologies, capabilities, and expertise to the project effort. 
The proposal evaluation process includes making trade-offs between differing levels of pro-
posed performance (as reflected in the contractor SOW), as well as proposed price.
Specifications are written, pictorial, or graphic information that describe, define, or 
specify the services or items to be procured. There are three types of specifications:
●
●
Design Specifications: These detail what is to be done in terms of physical charac-
teristics. The risk of performance is on the buyer.
●
●
Performance Specifications: These specify measurable capabilities the end prod-
uct must achieve in terms of operational characteristics. The risk of performance 
is on the contractor.
●
●
Functional Specifications: This is when the seller describes the end use of the item 
to stimulate competition among commercial items, at a lower overall cost. This is 
a subset of the performance specification, and the risk of performance is on the 
contractor.
There are always options in the way the end item can be obtained. 
Feasible procurement alternatives include make or buy, lease or buy, 
buy or rent, and lease or rent. Buying domestic or international is also 
of critical importance, especially to the United Auto Workers Union. 
Factors involving the make or buy analysis are:
●
●
The make decision
●
●
Less costly (but not always!)
●
●
Easy integration of operations
●
●
Utilize existing capacity that is idle
●
●
Maintain direct control
●
●
Maintain design/production secrecy
●
●
Avoid unreliable supplier base
●
●
Stabilize existing workforce
●
●
The buy decision
●
●
Less costly (but not always!)
●
●
Utilize skills of suppliers

The lease or rent decision is usually a financial endeavor. Leases are usually longer 
term than renting. Consider the following example. A company is willing to rent you a 
piece of equipment at a cost of $100 per day. You can lease the equipment for $60 per day 
plus a one-time cost of $5,000. What is the breakeven point, in days, where leasing and 
renting are the same?

Therefore, if the firm wishes to use this equipment for more than 125 days, it would be

Procurement planning must address the risks on the contract as well as the risks 
with procurement. Some companies have project management manuals with sections 
that specifically address procurement risks using templates. As an example, the follow-
ing is a partial list of procurement risks as identified in the ABB Project Management 
Manual:4
●
●
Contract and agreements (penalty/liquidated damages, specifications open to mis-
interpretation, vague wording, permits/licenses, paperwork requirements)
●
●
Responsibility and liability (force majeure, liability limits for each party, unclear 
scope limitations)
●
●
Financial (letters of credit, payment plans, inflation, currency exchange, bonds)
●
●
Political (political stability, changes in legislation, import/export restrictions, arbi-
tration laws)
●
●
Warranty (nonstandard requirements, repairs)
●
●
Schedule (unrealistic delivery time, work by others not finished on time, approval 
process, limitations on available resources)
●
●
Technical and technology (nonstandard solutions, quality assurance regulations, 
inspections, customer acceptance criteria)
●
●
Resources (availability, skill levels, local versus external)

Conducting the Procurements
667
The procurement plan will address the following questions:
●
●
How much procurement will be necessary?
●
●
Will they be standard or specialized procurement activities?
●
●
Will we make some of the products or purchase all of them?
●
●
Will there be qualified suppliers?
●
●
Will we need to prequalify some of the suppliers?
●
●
Will we use open bidding or bidding from a preferred supplier list?
●
●
How will we manage multiple suppliers?
●
●
Are there items that require long lead procurement?
●
●
What type of contract will be used, considering the contractual risks?
●
●
Will we need different contract types for multiple suppliers?
●
●
What evaluation criteria will be used to score the proposals?
19.3 CONDUCTING THE PROCUREMENTS
Once the requirements are identified and a procurement plan has 
been prepared, a requisition form for each item to be procured is sent 
to procurement to begin the procurement or requisition process. The 
process of conducting the procurements includes:
●
●
Evaluating/confirming specifications (are they current?)
●
●
Confirming qualified sources
●
●
Reviewing past performance of sources
●
●
Reviewing of team or partnership agreements
●
●
Producing the solicitation package
The solicitation package is prepared during the procurements planning process but uti-
lized during the next process, conduct procurements. In most situations, the same solicita-
tion package for each deliverable must be sent to each possible supplier so that the playing 
field is level. A typical solicitation package would include:
●
●
Bid documents (usually standardized)
●
●
Listing of qualified vendors (expected to bid)
●
●
Proposal evaluation criteria (source selection criteria)
●
●
Bidder conferences
●
●
How change requests will be managed
●
●
Supplier payment plan
Standardized bid documents usually include standard forms for compliance with EEO, 
affirmative action, OSHA/EPA, minority hiring, and so on. A listing of qualified vendors 
appears in order to drive down the cost. Quite often, one vendor will not bid on the job 
because it knows that it cannot submit a lower bid than one of the other vendors. The cost 
of bidding on a job is an expensive process.
PMBOK® Guide, 6th Edition
12.2 Conduct Procurements

668
Contract Management 
The solicitation package also describes the manner in which 
solicitation questions will be addressed, namely bidder conferences. 
Bidder conferences are used so that no single bidder has more knowl-
edge than others. If a potential bidder has a question concerning the solicitation package, 
then it must wait for the bidders’ conference to ask the question so that all bidders will be 
privileged to the same information. This is particularly important in government contracting. 
There may be several bidders’ conferences between solicitation and award. Project manage-
ment may or may not be involved in the bidders’ conferences, either from the customer’s 
side or the contractor’s side. Some companies do not use bidder conferences and allow bid-
ders to send in questions. However, the answer to each question is provided to all bidders.
The solicitation package usually provides bidders with information on how the bids 
will be evaluated. Contracts are not necessarily awarded to the lowest bidders. Some pro-
posal evaluation scoring models assign points in regard to each of the following, and the 
company with the greatest number of points may be awarded the contract:
●
●
Understanding of the requirements
●
●
Overall bid price
●
●
Technical superiority
●
●
Management capability
●
●
Previous performance (or references)
●
●
Financial strength (ability to stay in business)
●
●
Intellectual property rights
●
●
Production capacity (based upon existing contracts and potential new contracts)
Bidder conferences are also held as part of debriefing sessions whereby the bidders 
are informed as to why they did not win the contract. Under some circumstances, bidders 
who feel that their bid or proposal was not evaluated correctly can submit a “bid protest,” 
which may require a detailed reappraisal of their bid. The bid protest is not necessarily a 
complaint that the wrong company won the contract, but rather a complaint that their pro-
posal was not evaluated correctly.
19.4 CONDUCT PROCUREMENTS: REQUEST SELLER RESPONSES
Selection of the acquisition method is the critical element to request 
seller responses. There are three common methods for acquisition:
●
●
Advertising
●	 Negotiation
●	 Small purchases (i.e., office supplies)
Advertising is when a company goes out for sealed bids. There are no negotiations.
Competitive market forces determine the price and the award goes to the lowest bidder. 
Negotiation is when the price is determined through a bargaining process. In such a situa-
tion, the customer may go out for one of the following:
●
●
Request for information (RFI)

Invitation for bids (IFB)
The RFP is the most costly endeavor for the seller. Large proposals may contain 
separate volumes for cost, technical performance, management history, quality, facili-
ties, subcontractor management, and others. Bidders may be hesitant to spend large 
sums of money bidding on a contract unless the bidder believes that they have a high 
probability of winning the contract or will be reimbursed by the buyer for all bidding 
costs.
Using the IFB process, only selected companies are allowed to bid. Either all or part of 
the companies on the buyer’s preferred contractor list may be allowed to bid.
In government agencies, IFBs are used in sealed bidding procurements. In government 
sealed bid procurements, the competing offerors submit priced bids in response to IFBs. 
These IFBs contain all of the necessary technical documents, specifications, and drawings 
needed for a bidder to develop a priced offer. Thus, in sealed bid procurement, there are 
no discussions or negotiations, and the contract is always awarded to the lowest acceptable 
offer using a firm fixed-priced contract.
19.5 CONDUCT PROCUREMENTS: SELECT SELLERS
Part of source selection process includes the application of the evalu-
ation criteria to the contractor’s proposals. The evaluation criteria 
reflect the selected contract award strategy, which is typically either 
a price-based award strategy or best-value award strategy. The priced-based award strat-
egy is used when the contract will be awarded to the lowest-priced, technically accept-
able proposal. The best-value award strategy is used when the contract may be awarded to 
either the lowest-priced, technically acceptable offer or a higher-priced proposal offering a 
higher level of performance. During a best-value source selection, the procuring organiza-
tion conducts trade-offs among price, performance, and other nonprice factors to select the 
proposal that offers the overall best value to the buyer.
While several criteria can be used, the most common are time, cost, expected manage-
ment team of the project (i.e., quality of assigned resources), and previous performance 
history. As an example, assume that 100 points maximum can be given to each of the four 
criteria. The seller that is selected would have the greatest number of total points out of 
400 points. Weighing factors can also be applied to each of the four criteria. As an exam-
ple, previous performance may be worth 200 points, thus giving 500 points as a maximum. 
Therefore, the lowest-price supplier may be downgraded significantly because of past 
performance and not receive the contract.
Selecting the appropriate seller is not necessarily left exclusively to the evaluation cri-
teria. A negotiation process can be part of the selection process because the buyer may like 
several of the ideas among the many bidders and then may try to have the preferred seller 
take on added work at no additional cost to the buyer. The negotiation process also includes 
inclusion and exclusions. The negotiation process can be competitive or noncompetitive. 
Noncompetitive processes are called sole-source procurement.

On large contracts, the negotiation process goes well beyond negotiation of the bottom 
line. Separate negotiations can be made on:
●
●
Final price of the contract
●
●
Profit margins
●
●
Type of contract
●
●
Length of the contract
●
●
Timing for each of the deliverables
●
●
Quantity of deliverables
●
●
Quality of the deliverables
●
●
Payment schedule
●
●
Assignment of critical personnel
●
●
Ownership of the intellectual property
●
●
Warrantees
●
●
Cancellation and termination liability fees and conditions
●
●
Number and frequency of reports
●
●
Number, frequency, and location of customer-contractor interface meetings
Vendor relations are critical during contract negotiations. The integrity of the relation-
ship and previous history can shorten the negotiation process. The three major factors of 
negotiations are:
●
●
Compromise ability
●
●
Adaptability
●
●
Good faith
Negotiations should be planned for. A typical list of activities would include:
●
●
Develop objectives (i.e., min-max positions)
●
●
Evaluate your opponent
●
●
Define your strategy and tactics
●
●
Gather the facts
●
●
Perform a complete price/cost analysis
●
●
Arrange “hygiene” factors
If you are the buyer, what is the maximum you will be willing to pay? If you are the 
seller, what is the minimum you are willing to accept? You must determine what moti-
vates your opponent. Is your opponent interested in profitability, keeping people employed, 
developing a new technology, or using your name as a reference? This knowledge could 
certainly affect your strategy and tactics.
Hygiene factors include where the negotiations will take place. In a restaurant? Hotel? 
Office? Square table or round table? Morning or afternoon? Who faces the windows and 
who faces the walls?
There should be a postnegotiation critique in order to review what was learned. The 
first type of postnegotiation critique is internal to your firm. The second type of postnego-
tiation critique is with all of the losing bidders to explain why they did not win the contract.

Once negotiations are completed, each selected seller will receive a signed contract. 
Unfortunately there are several types of contracts. The negotiation process also includes 
the selection of the type of contract, and the final type of contract may be different than 
what was identified in the solicitation package.
Conclusion:  The objective of the conduct procurements process is to negotiate a 
contract type and price that will result in reasonable contractor risk and provide the 
contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economic performance.
There are some basic contractual terms that should be understood before looking at the 
various contracts. These include:
●
●
Agent: The person or group of people officially authorized to make decisions and 
represent their firm. This includes signing the contract.
●
●
Arbitration: The settling of a dispute by a third party who renders a decision. The 
third party is not a court of law, and the decision may or may not be legally binding.
●
●
Breach of Contract: To violate a law by an act or omission or to break a legal 
obligation.
●
●
Contract: An agreement entered into by two or more parties and the agreement 
can be enforced in a court of law.
●
●
Executed Contract: A contract that has been completed by all concerned parties.
●
●
Force Majeure Clause: A provision in a contract that excuses the parties involved 
from any liability or contractual obligations because of acts of God, wars, terror-
ism, or other such events.
●
●
Good Faith: Honesty and fair dealings between all parties involved in the contract.
●
●
Infringement: A violation of someone’s legally recognized right.
●
●
Liquidated Damages: An amount specified in a contract that stipulates the rea-
sonable estimation of damages that will occur as a result of a breach of contract.
●
●
Negligence: The failure to exercise one’s activity in such a manner that a reason-
able person would do in a similar situation.
●
●
Noncompete Clause: A covenant providing restrictions on starting up a compet-
ing business or working for a competitor within a specified time period.
●
●
Nondisclosure Clause: A covenant providing restrictions on certain proprietary 
information such that it cannot be disclosed without written permission.
●
●
Nonconformance: Performance of work in such a manner that it does not con-
form to contractual specifications or requirements.
●
●
Penalty Clause: An agreement or covenant, identified in financial terms, for 
failure to perform.
●
●
Privity of Contract: The relationship that exists between the buyer and seller of 
a contract.
●
●
Termination or Termination Liability: An agreement between the buyer and 
seller as to how much money the seller will receive should the project be termi-
nated prior to the scheduled completion date and without all of the contractual 
deliverable being completed.

●
●
Truth in Negotiations: This clause in the contract states that both the buyer and 
seller have been truthful in the information provided during contract negotiations.
●
●
Waiver: An intentional relinquishment of a legal right.
●
●
Warranty: A promise, either verbal or written, that certain facts are true as 
represented.
There are certain basic elements of most contracts:
●
●
Mutual Agreement: There must be an offer and acceptance.
●
●
Consideration: There must be a down payment.
●
●
Contract Capability: The contract is binding only if the contractor has the capa-
bility to perform the work.
●
●
Legal Purpose: The contract must be for a legal purpose.
●
●
Form Provided by Law: The contract must reflect the contractor’s legal obliga-
tion, or lack of obligation, to deliver end products.
The two most common contract forms are completion contracts 
and term contracts.
●	 Completion Contract: The contractor is required to deliver 
a definitive end product. Upon delivery and formal accept-
ance by the customer, the contract is considered complete, 
and final payment can be made.
●
●
Term Contract: The contract is required to deliver a specific “level of effort,” not 
an end product. The effort is expressed in woman/man-days (months or years) over 
a specific period of time using specified personnel skill levels and facilities. When 
the contracted effort is performed, the contractor is under no further obligation. 
Final payment is made, irrespective of what is actually accomplished technically.
The final contract is usually referred to as a definitive contract, which follows normal 
contracting procedures such as the negotiation of all contractual terms, condition cost, and 
schedule prior to initiation of performance. Unfortunately, negotiating the contract and 
preparing it for signatures may require months of preparation. If the customer needs the 
work to begin immediately or if long-lead procurement is necessary, then the customer may 
provide the contractor with a letter contract or letter of intent. The letter contract is a pre-
liminary written instrument authorizing the contractor to begin immediately the manufac-
ture of supplies or the performance of services. The final contract price may be negotiated 
after performance begins, but the contractor may not exceed the “not to exceed” face value 
of the contract. The definitive contract must still be negotiated.
The type of contract selected is based upon the following:
●
●
Overall degree of cost and schedule risk
●
●
Type and complexity of requirement (technical risk)
●
●
Extent of price competition
●
●
Cost/price analysis

19.6 TYPES OF CONTRACTS
Before analyzing the various types of contracts, one should be famil-
iar with the terminology found in them.
●
●
The target cost or estimated cost is the level of cost that the contractor will most 
likely obtain under normal performance conditions. The target cost serves as a 
basis for measuring the true cost at the end of production or development. The tar-
get cost may vary for different types of contracts even though the contract objec-
tives are the same. The target cost is the most important variable affecting research 
and development.
●
●
Target or expected profit is the profit value that is negotiated for, and set forth, in 
the contract. The expected profit is usually the largest portion of the total profit.
●
●
Profit ceiling and profit floor are the maximum and minimum values, respectively, 
of the total profit. These quantities are often included in contract negotiations.
●
●
Price ceiling or ceiling price is the amount of money for which the government is 
responsible. It is usually measured as a given percentage of the target cost, and is 
generally greater than the target cost.
●
●
Maximum and minimum fees are percentages of the target cost and establish the 
outside limits of the contractor’s profit.
●
●
The sharing arrangement or formula gives the cost responsibility of the cus-
tomer to the cost responsibility of the contractor for each dollar spent. Whether 
that dollar is an overrun or an underrun dollar, the sharing arrangement has the 
same impact on the contractor. This sharing arrangement may vary depending on 
whether the contractor is operating above or below target costs. The production 
point is usually that level of production above which the sharing arrangement 
commences.
●
●
Point of total assumption is the point (cost or price) where the contractor assumes 
all liability for additional costs.
Because no single form of contract agreement fits every situation or project, com-
panies normally perform work in the United States under a wide variety of contractual 
arrangements, such as:
●
●
Cost-plus percentage fee
●
●
Cost-plus fixed fee
●
●
Cost-plus guaranteed maximum
●
●
Cost-plus guaranteed maximum and shared savings

At one end of the range is the cost-plus, a fixed-fee type of contract where the com-
pany’s profit, rather than price, is fixed and the company’s responsibility, except for its own 
negligence, is minimal. At the other end of the range is the lump sum or turnkey type of 
contract under which the company has assumed full responsibility, in the form of profit or 
losses, for timely performance and for all costs under or over the fixed contract price. In 
between are various types of contracts, such as the guaranteed maximum, incentive types 
of contracts, and the bonus-penalty type of contract. These contracts provide for varying 
degrees of cost responsibility and profit depending on the level of performance. Contracts 
that cover the furnishing of consulting services are generally on a per diem basis at one end 
of the range and on a fixed-price basis at the other end of the range.
There are generally five types of contracts to consider: fixed-price (FP), cost-plus-
fixed-fee (CPFF) or cost-plus-percentage-fee (CPPF), guaranteed maximum-shared 
savings (GMSS), fixed-price-incentive-fee (FPIF), and cost-plus-incentive-fee (CPIF) con-
tracts. Each type is discussed separately.
●
●
Under a fixed-price or lump-sum contract, the contractor must carefully estimate 
the target cost. The contractor is required to perform the work at the negotiated 
contract value. If the estimated target cost was low, the total profit is reduced and 
may even vanish. The contractor may not be able to underbid the competitors if the 
expected cost is overestimated. Thus the contractor assumes a large risk.
This contract provides maximum protection to the owner for the ultimate cost 
of the project, but has the disadvantage of requiring a long period for preparation 
and adjudications of bids. Also, there is the possibility that, because of a lack of 
knowledge of local conditions, all contractors may necessarily include an exces-
sive amount of contingency. This form of contract should never be considered by 
the owner unless, at the time bid invitations are issued, the building requirements 
are known exactly. Changes requested by the owner after award of a contract on a 
lump sum basis lead to troublesome and sometimes costly extras.
●
●
Traditionally, the cost-plus-fixed-fee contract has been employed when it was 
believed that accurate pricing could not be achieved any other way. In the CPFF 
contract, the cost may vary but the fee remains firm. Because, in a cost-plus con-
tract, the contractor agrees only to use his best efforts to perform the work, good 

performance and poor performance are, in effect, rewarded equally. The total dol-
lar profit tends to produce low rates of return, reflecting the small amount of risk 
that the contractor assumes. The fixed fee is usually a small percentage of the total 
or true cost. The cost-plus contract requires that the company books be audited.
With this form of contract the engineering-construction contractor bids a fixed 
dollar fee or profit for the services to be supplied by the contractor, with engineer-
ing, materials, and field labor costs to be reimbursed at actual cost. This form of 
bid can be prepared quickly at a minimal expense to contractor and is a simple bid 
for the owner to evaluate. Additionally, it has the advantage of establishing incen-
tive to the contractor for quick completion of the job.
If it is a cost-plus-percentage-fee contract, it provides maximum flexibility to 
the owner and permits owner and contractor to work together cooperatively on all 
technical, commercial, and financial problems. However, it does not provide finan-
cial assurance of ultimate cost. Higher building cost may result, although not nec-
essarily so, because of lack of financial incentive to the contractor compared with 
other forms. The only meaningful incentive that is evident today is the increased 
competition and prospects for follow-on contracts.
●
●
Under the guaranteed maximum-share savings contract, the contractor is paid a 
fixed fee for his profit and reimbursed for the actual cost of engineering, materials, 
construction labor, and all other job costs, but only up to the ceiling figure estab-
lished as the “guaranteed maximum.” Savings below the guaranteed maximum are 
shared between owner and contractor, whereas contractor assumes the responsibil-
ity for any overrun beyond the guaranteed maximum price.
This contract form essentially combines the advantages as well as a few of the 
disadvantages of both lump sum and cost-plus contracts. This is the best form for a 
negotiated contract because it establishes a maximum price at the earliest possible 
date and protects the owner against being overcharged, even though the contract 
is awarded without competitive tenders. The guaranteed maximum-share savings 
contract is unique in that the owner and contractor share the financial risk and both 
have a real incentive to complete the project at lowest possible cost.
●
●
Fixed-price-incentive-fee contracts are the same as fixed-price contracts except 
that they have a provision for adjustment of the total profit by a formula that 
depends on the final total cost at completion of the project and that has been agreed 
to in advance by both the owner and the contractor. To use this type of contract, the 
project or contract requirements must be firmly established. This contract provides 
an incentive to the contractor to reduce costs and therefore increase profit. Both the 
owner and contractor share in the risk and savings.
●
●
Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts are the same as cost-plus contracts except that 
they have a provision for adjustment of the fee as determined by a formula that 
compares the total project costs to the target cost. This formula is agreed to in 
advance by both the owner and contractor. This contract is usually used for long-
duration or R&D-type projects. The company places more risk on the contractor 
and forces him to plan ahead carefully and strive to keep costs down. Incentive 
contracts are covered in greater detail in Section 19.7.
●
●
Another type of contract incentives are award fees. Whereas incentive fees are 
objectively determined, that is, based on objective calculations comparing actual

cost to target costs, actual delivery to target delivery, or actual performance to 
target performance, award fees are more subjectively determined. Award fees are 
used when it is not feasible or effective to determine objective contract incentives. 
Award fees are earned when the contractor meets higher (over and above the basic 
requirements of the contract) levels of performance, quality, timeliness, or respon-
siveness in performing the contract effort. Award fee contracts include an award 
fee plan that explains the award fee evaluation criteria for any given time period 
(typically one year), as well as the total dollar amount of the award fee pool. Typi-
cally a contract award fee evaluation board convenes at the end of each award fee 
period to evaluate the contractor’s performance in relation to the award fee criteria 
established in the award fee plan. The award fee determination official, either the 
project manager or a level above the project manager, makes the actual determina-
tion on the amount of award fee earned by the contractor for that specific period. 
Award fee provisions can be part of cost or fixed-priced contracts.
For major services contracts, award term incentives are used as incentives 
for the contractor to achieve higher levels of performance, quality, timeliness, or 
responsiveness in performing the services contract effort. Award term is similar 
to award fee, but instead of awarding the successful contractor additional dollars 
(fee), the contractor earns additional time (contract performance periods) on the 
service contract. Thus, instead of ending the final contract period of performance, 
and then having to recompete for the follow-on contract, the successful contractor 
is awarded with time extensions (additional periods of performance) to the con-
tract performance period.
Other types of contracts that are not used frequently include:
●
●
The fixed-price incentive successive targets contract is an infrequently used con-
tract type. It has been used in the past in acquiring systems with very long lead 
time requirements where follow-on production contracts must be awarded before 
design or even production confirmation costs have been confirmed. Pricing data 
for the follow-on contract is inconclusive. This type of contract can be used in lieu 
of a letter contract or cost-plus arrangement.
●
●
The fixed-price with redetermination contract can be either prospective or retro-
active. The prospective type allows for future negotiations of two or more firm, 
fixed-price contracts at prearranged times. This is often used when future costs and 
pricing are expected to change significantly. The retroactive FPR contract allows 
for adjusting contract price after performance has been completed.
●
●
Cost (CR) and cost-sharing (CS) contracts have limited use. Cost contracts have 
a “no fee” feature that has limited use except for nonprofit educational institu-
tions conducting research. Cost-sharing contracts are used for basic and applied 
research where the contractor is expected to benefit from the R&D by transferring 
knowledge to other parts of the business for commercial gain and to improve the 
contractor’s competitive position.

Contract Management 
The type of contract that is acceptable to the client and the company is determined by 
the circumstances of each individual project and the prevailing economic and competitive 
conditions. Generally, when work is hard to find, clients insist on fixed-price bids. This 
type of proposal is usually a burden to the contractor because of the proposal costs involved 
(about 1 percent of the total installed cost of the project), and the higher risk involved in the 
execution of the project on such a basis.
When there is an upsurge in business, clients are unable to insist on fixed-price 
bids and more work is awarded on a cost-plus basis. In fact, where a special capacity 
position exists, or where time is a factor, the client occasionally negotiates a cost-plus 
contract with only one contractor. Another technique is to award a project on a cost-
plus basis with the understanding that the contract will be converted at a later date, 
when the scope has been better defined and unknowns identified, to another form, 
such as a lump sum for services. This approach is appealing to both the client and the 
contractor.
19.7 INCENTIVE CONTRACTS
To alleviate some of the previously mentioned problem areas, clients, 
especially the government, have been placing incentive objectives 
into their contracts. The fixed-price-incentive-fee (FPIF) contract is 
an example of this. The essence of the incentive contract is that it offers a contractor more 
profit if costs are reduced or performance is improved and less profit if costs are raised or 
if performance goals are not met. Cost incentives take the form of a sharing formula gen-
erally expressed as a ratio. For example, if a 90/10 formula were negotiated, the govern-
ment would pay for 90 cents and the contractor 10 cents for every dollar above the target 
cost. Thus it benefits both the contractor and the government to reduce costs, because the 
contractor must consider that 10 percent of every dollar must be spent by the company. 
Expected profits can thus be increased by making maximum use of the contractor’s mana-
gerial skills.
In the FPIF contract, the contractor agrees to perform a service at a given fixed cost. 
If the total cost is less than the target cost, then the contractor has made a profit according 
to the incentive-fee formula. If the total cost exceeds the target cost, then the contractor 
loses money.
Consider the following example, which appears in Figure 19–1. The contractor has 
a target cost and target profit. However, there is a price ceiling of $11,500, which is the 
maximum price that the contractor will be paid. If the contractor performs the work below 
the target cost of $10,000, then additional profit will be made. For example, by perform-
ing the work for $9,000, the contractor will receive a profit of $1,150, which is the target 
profit of $850 plus $300 for 30% of the underrun. The contractor will receive a total price 
of $10,150.
If the cost exceeds the target cost, then the contractor must pay 30 percent of the over-
run out of the contractor’s profits. However, the fixed-price-incentive-fee (FPIF) contract

Contract Type versus Risk
679
has a point of total assumption. In this example, the point of total assumption is the point 
where all additional costs are burdened by the contractor. From Figure 19–1, the point of 
total assumption is when the cost reaches $10,928. At this point, the final price of $11,500 
is reached. If the cost continues to increase, then all profits may disappear and the contractor 
may be forced to pay the majority of the overrun.
When the contract is completed, the contractor submits a statement of costs incurred 
in the performance of the contract. The costs are audited to determine allowability and 
questionable charges are removed. This determines the negotiated cost. The negotiated cost 
is then subtracted from the target cost. This number is then multiplied by the sharing ratio. 
If the number is positive, it is added to the target profit. If it is negative, it is subtracted. 
The new number, the final profit, is then added to the negotiated cost to determine the final 
price. The final price never exceeds the price ceiling.
Figure 19–2 shows a typical cost-plus-incentive-fee (CPIF) contract. In this contract, 
the contractor is reimbursed 100% of the costs. However, there is a maximum fee (i.e., 
profit) of $1,350 and a minimum fee of $300. The final allowable profit will vary between 
the minimum and maximum fee. Because there appears more financial risk for the cus-
tomer in a CPIF contract, the target fee is usually less than in an FPIF contract, and the 
contractor’s portion of the sharing ratio is smaller.

19.8 CONTRACT TYPE VERSUS RISK
The amount of profit on a contract is most frequently based upon how 
the risks are to be shared between the contractor and the customer. 
For example, on a firm-fixed-price contract, the contractor absorbs 
100 percent of the risks (especially financial) and expects to receive a 
larger profit than on other types of contracts. On cost, cost-plus, and cost-sharing contracts, 
the customer absorbs up to 100 percent of the risks and expects the contractor to work for 
a lower than expected profit margin or perhaps no profit at all.
All other types of contracts may have a risk sharing formula between the customer and 
the contractor. Figure 19–3 shows the relative degree of risk between the customer and the 
contractor for a variety of contracts.
19.9 CONTRACT ADMINISTRATION
The contract administrator is responsible for compliance by the seller 
to the buyer’s contractual terms and conditions and to make sure that 
the final product is fit for use. Contract administrators can shut down 
a manufacturing plant by allowing the seller to make late deliveries.

Contract Administration
681
Although a contract administrator is a member of the project team for project reporting 
purposes (dotted line reporting), the contract administrator can report to a line function 
such as corporate legal and may even be an attorney. The functions of the corporate admin-
istrator include:
●
●
Change management
●
●
Specification interpretation
●
●
Adherence to quality requirements
●
●
Inspections and audits
●
●
Warranties
●
●
Performance reporting
●
●
Records management
●
●
Contractor (seller) management
●
●
Contractor (seller) performance report card
●
●
Documenting seller’s performance (for future source selection teams)
●
●
Production surveillance
●
●
Approval of waivers
●
●
Breach of contract
●
●
Claims administration
●
●
Resolution of disputes
●
●
Payment schedules
●
●
Project termination
●
●
Project closure
The larger the contract, the greater the need for the contract administrator to resolve 
ambiguity in the contract. Sometimes, large contracts that are prepared by teams of attor-
neys contain an order of precedence clause. The order of precedence specifies that any 
inconsistency in the solicitation of the contract shall be resolved in a given order of 
procedure.

Contract Management 
Perhaps the majority of the contract administrator’s time is spent handling changes. 
The following definitions describe the types of changes:
●
●
Administrative change: A unilateral contractual change, in writing, that does not 
affect the substantive rights of the parties (i.e., a change in the paying office or the 
appropriation funding).
●
●
Change order: A written order, signed by the contracting officer, directing the 
contractor to make a change.
●
●
Contract modification: Any written change in the terms of the contract.
●
●
Undefinitized contractual action: Any contractual action that authorizes the com-
mencement of work prior to the establishment of a final definitive price.
●
●
Supplemental agreement: A contract modification that is accompanied by the 
mutual action of both parties.
●
●
Constructive change: Any effective change to the contract caused by the actions 
or inaction of personnel in authority, or by circumstances that cause a contractor 
to perform work differently than required by written contract. The contractor may 
file a claim for equitable adjustment in the contract.
Based on the type of contract, terms, and conditions, the customer may have the right 
to terminate a contract for convenience at any time. However, the customer must compen-
sate the contractor for his preparations and for any completed and accepted work relating 
to the terminated part of the contract.
The following are reasons for termination for convenience of the customer:
●
●
Elimination of the requirement
●
●
Technological advances in the state-of-the-art
●
●
Budgetary changes
●
●
Related requirements and/or procurements
●
●
Anticipating profits not allowed
The following are reasons for termination for default due to contractor’s actions:
●
●
Contractor fails to make delivery on scheduled date.
●
●
Contractor fails to make progress so as to endanger performance of the contract 
and its terms.
●
●
Contractor fails to perform any other provisions of the contract.
If a contract is terminated due to default, then the contractor may not be entitled to 
compensation of work in progress but not yet accepted by the customer. The customer may 
even be entitled to repayment from the contractor of any advances or progress payments 
applicable to such work. Also, the contractor may be liable for any excess reprocurement 
costs. However, contractors can seek relief through negotiations, a Board of Contracts 
Appeals, or Claims Court.

Contract Closure
683
The contract administrator is responsible for performance control. This includes 
inspection, acceptance, and breach of contract/default. If the goods/services do not comply 
with the contract, then the contract administrator has the right to:
●
●
Reject the entire shipment
●
●
Accept the entire shipment (barring latent defects)
●
●
Accept part of the shipment
In government contracts, the government has the right to have the goods repaired with 
the costs charged back to the supplier or fix the goods themselves and charge the cost of 
repairs to the supplier. If the goods are then acceptable to the government, then the govern-
ment may reduce the contract amount by an appropriate amount to reflect the reduced value 
of the contract.
Project managers often do financial closeout once the goods are shipped to the customer. 
This poses a problem if the goods must be repaired. Billing the cost of repairs against a finan-
cially closed out project is called back-charging. Most companies do not perform financial 
closeout until at least 90 days after delivery of goods.
19.10 CONTRACT CLOSURE
The contract administrator is responsible for verification that all of 
the work performed and deliverables produced are acceptable to the 
buyer. Contractual closure is then followed up with administrative 
closure, which includes:
●
●
Documented verification that the output was accepted by the buyer
●
●
Debriefing the seller on their overall performance
●
●
Documenting seller’s performance (documentation will be used in future source 
selections when evaluating contractor’s past performance)
●
●
Identifying room for improvement on future contracts
●
●
Archiving all necessary project documentation
●
●
Performing a lessons-learned review
●
●
Identifying best practices
The seller also performs administrative closure once contractual closure is recognized. 
For the seller, an important subset of administrative closure is financial closure, which is 
the closing out of all open charge numbers. If financial closure occurs before contractual 
closure, then the project manager runs the risk that the charge numbers may have to be 
reopened to account for the cost of repairs or defects. Back-charging can be a monumental 
headache for the project manager, especially if the accounting group identified the unused 
money in the code of accounts as excess profits.

19.11 USING A CHECKLIST
To assist a company in evaluating inquiries and preparing proposals and contracts, a 
checklist of contract considerations and provisions can be helpful in the evaluation 
of each proposal and form of contract to ensure that appropriate safeguards are incor-
porated. This checklist is also used for sales letters and brochures that may promise 
or represent a commercial commitment. Its primary purpose is to remind users of the 
legal and commercial factors that should be considered in preparing proposals and 
contracts. Table 19–2 shows the typical major headings that would be considered in 
a checklist. A key word concept also provides an excellent checklist of the key issues 
to be considered. It will be useful as a reminder in preparation for contractor-client 
agreement discussions.
19.12 PROPOSAL-CONTRACTUAL INTERACTION
It is critical during the proposal preparation stage that contract terms 
and conditions be reviewed and approved before submission of a pro-
posal to the client. The contracts (legal) representative is responsible 
for the preparation of the contract portion of the proposal. Generally, 
contracts with the legal department are handled through or in coordination with the pro-
posal group. The contract representative determines or assists with the following:
●
●
Type of contract
●
●
Required terms and conditions
●
●
Any special requirements

The sales department, through the proposal group, has the final responsibility for the 
content and outcome of all proposals and contracts that it handles. However, there are 
certain aspects that should be reviewed with others who can offer guidance, advice, and 
assistance to facilitate the effort. In general, contract agreements should be reviewed by the 
following departments:
●
●
Proposal
●
●
Legal
●
●
Insurance
●
●
Tax
●
●
Project management
●
●
Engineering
●
●
Estimating
●
●
Construction (if required)
●
●
Purchasing (if required)
Responsibility for collecting and editing contract comments rests with the proposal 
manager. In preparing contract comments, consideration should be given to comments 
previously submitted to the client for the same form of agreement, and also previous 
agreements signed with the client.
Contract comments should be reviewed for their substance and ultimate risk to the 
company. It must be recognized that in most instances, the client is not willing to make 
a large number of revisions to his proposed form of agreement. The burden of proof that 
a contract change is required rests with the company; therefore, each comment submitted 
must have a good case behind it.
Proposals should send all bid documents, including the client’s form of contract, or 
equivalent information, along with the proposal outline or instructions to the legal depart-
ment upon receipt of documents from the client. The instructions or outline should indicate 
the assignment of responsibility and include background information on matters that are 
pertinent to sales strategy or specific problems such as guarantees, previous experience 
with client, and so on.
Proposals should discuss briefly with the legal department what is planned by way of 
the project, the sales effort, and commercial considerations. If there is a kickoff meeting, 
a representative of the legal department should attend if it is appropriate. The legal depart-
ment should make a preliminary review of the documents before any such discussion or 
meeting.
Normal practice is to validate proposals for a period of thirty to sixty days following 
date of submission. Validation of proposals for periods in excess of this period may be 
required by special circumstances and should be done only with management’s concur-
rence. Occasionally, it is desirable to validate a bid for fewer than thirty days. The validity 

686
Contract Management 
period is especially important on lump sum bids. On such bids, the validity period must 
be consistent with validity times of quotations received for major equipment items. If 
these are not consistent, additional escalation on equipment and materials may have to be 
included in the lump sum price, and the company’s competitive position could thereby be 
jeopardized.
One area that is critical to the development of a good contract is the definition of the 
scope of work covered by the contract. This is of particular importance to the proposal 
manager, who is responsible for having the proper people prepared for the scope of work 
description. What is prepared during proposal production most likely governs the contract 
preparation and eventually becomes part of that contract. The degree to which the project 
scope of work must be described in a contract depends on the pricing mechanism and con-
tract form used.
An inadequate or unrealistic description of the work to be undertaken or evaluation of 
the project requirements marks the beginning of an unhappy contract experience.

TO BID OR NOT TO BID
CASE STUDIES
Marvin was the president and chief executive officer (CEO) of his com-
pany. The decision of whether or not to bid on a job above a certain dollar 
value rested entirely upon his shoulders. In the past, his company would bid on all jobs that 
were a good fit with his company’s strategic objectives and the company’s win-to-loss ratio was 
excellent. But to bid on this job would be difficult. The client was requesting certain information 
in the request for proposal (RFP) that Marvin did not want to release. If Marvin did not comply 
with the requirements of the RFP, his company’s bid would be considered nonresponsive.
Background
Bidding Process
Marvin’s company was highly successful at winning contracts through 
competitive bidding. The company was project-driven and all of the rev-
enue that came into the company came through winning contracts. Almost all of the clients 
provided the company with long-term contracts as well as follow-on contracts. Almost all of 
the contracts were firm-fixed-price contracts. Business was certainly good, at least up until now. 
Marvin established a policy whereby 5 percent of sales would be used for responding to RFPs. 
This was referred to as a bid-and-proposal (B&P) budget. The cost for bidding on contracts was 
quite high and clients knew that requiring the company to spend a great deal of money bidding 
on a job might force a no-bid on the job. That could eventually hurt the industry by reducing 
the number of bidders in the marketplace. Marvin’s company used parametric and analogy 
estimating on all contracts. This allowed Marvin’s people to estimate the work at level 1 or 
level 2 of the work breakdown structure (WBS). From a financial perspective, this was the most 
cost-effective way to bid on a project knowing full well that there were risks with the accuracy 
of the estimates at these levels of the WBS. But over the years continuous improvements to the 
company’s estimating process reduced much of the uncertainty in the estimates.
New RFP
One of Marvin’s most important clients announced it would be going out 
for bids for a potential ten-year contract. This contract was larger than any 
other contract that Marvin’s company had ever received and could provide an excellent cash 
flow stream for ten years or even longer. Winning the contract was essential. Because most of 
the previous contracts were firm-fixed-price, only summary-level pricing at the top two levels of 
the WBS was provided in the proposal. That was usually sufficient for the company’s clients to 

evaluate the cost portion of the bid. The RFP was finally released. For this project, the contract 
type would be cost-reimbursable. A WBS created by the client was included in the RFP, and the 
WBS was broken down into five levels. Each bidder had to provide pricing information for each 
work package in the WBS. By doing this, the client could compare the cost of each work pack-
age from each bidder. The client would then be comparing apples and apples from each bidder 
rather than apples and oranges. To make matters worse, each bidder had to agree to use the WBS 
created by the client during project execution and to report costs according to the WBS.
Marvin saw the risks right away. If Marvin decided to bid on the job, the company would 
be releasing its detailed cost structure to the client. All costs would then be clearly exposed to 
the client. If Marvin were to bid on this project, releasing the detailed cost information could 
have a serious impact on future bids even if the contracts in the future were firm-fixed-price.
Marvin convened a team composed of his senior officers. During the discussions that fol-
lowed, the team identified the pros and cons of bidding on the job:
Pros:
●
●
A lucrative ten-year (or longer) contract
●
●
The ability to have the client treat Marvin’s company as a strategic partner rather than 
just a supplier
●
●
Possibly lower profit margins on this and other future contracts but greater overall 
profits and earnings per share because of the larger business base
●
●
Establishment of a workable standard for winning more large contracts
Cons:
●
●
Release of the company’s cost structure
●
●
Risk that competitors will see the cost structure and hire away some of the company’s 
talented people by offering them more pay
●
●
Inability to compete on price and having entire cost structure exposed could be a 
limiting factor on future bids
●
●
If the company does not bid on this job, the company could be removed from the 
client’s bidder list
●
●
Clients must force Marvin’s company to accept lower profit margins
Marvin then asked the team, “Should we bid on the job?”
QUESTIONS
1.	 What other factors should Marvin and his team consider?
2.	 Should they bid on the job?
THE MANAGEMENT RESERVE
Background
A project sponsor forces the project management to include a management 
reserve in the cost of a project. However, the project sponsor intends to use 
the management reserve for his own “pet” project and this creates prob-
lems for the project manager.
Case Studies
693
Sole-Source Contract
The Structural Engineering Department at Avcon, Inc. made a break-
through in the development of a high-quality, low-weight composite 
material. Avcon believed that the new material could be manufactured inexpensively and 

694
Contract Management 
Avcon’s clients would benefit by lowering their manufacturing and shipping costs.
News of the breakthrough spread through the industry. Avcon was asked by one of its 
most important clients to submit an unsolicited proposal for design, development, and testing 
of products for the client using the new material. Jane would be the project manager. She had 
worked with the client previously as the project manager on several other projects that were 
considered successes.
Meeting with Tim
Because of the relative newness of the technology, both Avcon and the 
client understood that this could not be a firm-fixed-price contract. They ultimately agreed to a 
cost-plus-incentive-fee contract type. However, the target costs still had to be determined. Jane 
worked with all of the functional managers to determine what their efforts would be on this con-
tract. The only unknown was the time and cost needed for structural testing. Structural testing 
would be done by the Structural Engineering Department, which was responsible for making 
the technical breakthrough. Tim was head of the Structural Engineering Department. Jane set up 
a meeting to discuss the cost of testing on this project. During the meeting, Tim replied:
A full test matrix will cost about $100,000. I believe that we should price out the full test 
matrix and also include a management reserve of at least $100,000 should anything go 
wrong.
Jane was a little perplexed about adding in a management reserve. Tim was usually right on 
the money on his estimates and Jane knew from previous experience that a full test matrix might 
not be needed. But Tim was the subject matter expert and Jane reluctantly agreed to include in 
the contract a management reserve of $100,000. As Jane was about to exit Tim’s office, Tim 
remarked:
Jane, I had requested to be your project sponsor on this effort and management has given 
me the okay. You and I will be working together on this effort. As such, I would like to see 
all of the cost figures before submitting the final bid to the client.
Reviewing Cost Figures
Jane had worked with Tim before but not in a situation where Tim would 
be the project sponsor. However, it was common on some contracts that 
lower and middle levels of management would assume the sponsorship role rather than having 
all sponsorship at the top of the organization. Jane met with Tim and showed him the following 
information, which would appear in the proposal:
●
●
Sharing ratio: 90–10%
●
●
Contract cost target: $800,000
●
●
Contract profit target: $50,000
●
●
Management reserve: $100,000
●
●
Profit ceiling: $70,000
●
●
Profit floor: $35,000
Tim looked at the numbers and Jane could see that he was somewhat unhappy. Tim then 
stated:
Jane, I do not want to identify to the client that we have a management reserve. Let’s place 
the management reserve in with the $800,000 and change the target cost to $900,000. I 

know that the cost baseline should not include the management reserve, but in this case I 
believe it is necessary to do so.
Jane knew that the cost baseline of a project does not include the management reserve, but 
there was nothing she could do; Tim was the sponsor and had the final say. Jane simply could 
not understand why Tim was trying to hide the management reserve.
Case Studies
695
Execution Begins
Tim instructed Jane to include in the structural test matrix work package 
the entire management reserve of $100,000. Jane knew from previous ex-
perience that a full test matrix was not required and that the typical cost of this work package 
should be between $75,000 and $90,000. Establishing a work package of $200,000 meant that 
Tim had complete control over the management reserve and how it would be used.
Jane was now convinced that Tim had a hidden agenda. Unsure what to do next, Jane 
contacted a colleague in the Project Management Office. The colleague informed Jane that Tim 
had tried unsuccessfully to get some of his pet projects included in the portfolio of projects, but 
management refused to include any of Tim’s projects in the budget for the portfolio.
It was now clear what Tim was asking Jane to be part of and why Tim had requested to 
be the project sponsor. Tim was forcing Jane to violate PMI’s Code of Ethics and Professional 
Conduct.
QUESTIONS
1.	 Why did Tim want to add in a management reserve?
2.	 Why did Tim want to become the project sponsor?
3.	 Are Tim’s actions a violation of the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct?
4.	 If Jane follows Tim instructions, is Jane also in violation of the Code of Ethics and 
Professional Conduct?
5.	 What are Jane’s options if she decides not to follow Tim’s instructions?

20.0 INTRODUCTION
During the past twenty years, there has been a revolution in quality. 
Improvements have occurred not only in product quality, but also 
in leadership quality and project management quality. The changing 
views of quality appear in Table 20–1.
Unfortunately, it often takes an economic disaster, recession, or downturn in a firm’s business base to 
get management to recognize the need for improved quality. Economic disasters provide some companies 
with the opportunity to become aggressive competitors in new markets. As an example, many high-tech 
engineering companies never fully recognized the need for shortening product development time and the 
relationship between project management, total quality management, and concurrent engineering until they 
saw their market share diminish. 
The push for higher levels of quality appears to be customer driven. Customers are now demanding:
●
●
Higher performance requirements
●
●
Faster product development
●
●
Higher technology levels
●
●
Materials and processes pushed to the limit
●
●
Lower contractor profit margins
●
●
Fewer defects/rejects
One of the critical factors that can affect quality is market expectations. The variables that affect market 
expectations include:
●
●
Salability: the balance between quality and cost
●
●
Produceability: the ability to produce the product with available technology and workers, and at 
an acceptable cost

●
●
Social acceptability: the degree of conflict between the product or process and the values of society 
(i.e., safety, environment)
●
●
Operability: the degree to which a product can be operated safely
●
●
Availability: the probability that the product, when used under given conditions, will perform sat-
isfactorily when called upon
●
●
Reliability: the probability of the product performing without failure under given conditions and 
for a set period of time
●
●
Maintainability: the ability of the product to be retained in or restored to a performance level when 
prescribed maintenance is performed
Customer demands are now being handled using total quality management (TQM). Total quality man-
agement is an ever-improving system for integrating various organizational elements into the design, devel-
opment, and manufacturing efforts, providing cost-effective products or services that are fully acceptable to 
the ultimate customer. Externally, TQM is customer oriented and provides for more meaningful customer 
satisfaction. Internally, TQM reduces production line bottlenecks and operating costs, thus enhancing prod-
uct quality while improving organizational morale.
20.1 DEFINITION OF QUALITY
Mature organizations readily admit that they cannot accurately define 
quality. The reason is that quality is defined by the customer. The 
Kodak definition of quality is those products and services that are 
perceived to meet or exceed the needs and expectations of the cus-
tomer at a cost that represents out-standing value. The ISO 9000 definition is “the totality 
of feature and characteristics of a product or service that bears on its ability to satisfy stated 
or implied needs.” Terms such as fitness for use, customer satisfaction, and zero defects are 
goals rather than definitions.
Table 20-1.  Changing Views of Quality
Past
Present
• Quality is the responsibility of blue-collar workers and direct 
labor employees working on the floor.
• Quality defects should be hidden from the customers (and 
possibly management).
• Quality problems lead to blame, faulty justification, and 
excuses.
• Corrections-to-quality problems should be accomplished  
with minimum documentation.
• Increased quality will increase project costs.
• Quality is internally focused.
• Quality will not occur without close supervision of people.
• Quality occurs during project execution
• Quality is everyone’s responsibility, including 
white-collar workers, the indirect labor force, and the 
overhead staff.
• Defects should be highlighted and brought to the 
surface for corrective action.
• Quality problems lead to cooperative solutions.
• Documentation is essential for “lessons learned” so 
that mistakes are not repeated.
• Improved quality saves money and increases business.
• Quality is customer focused.
• People want to produce quality products.
• Quality occurs at project initiation and must be 
planned for within the project

Introduction

The Quality Movement
699
Most organizations view quality more as a process than a product. To be more specific, 
it is a continuously improving process where lessons learned are used to enhance future 
products and services in order to:
●
●
Retain existing customers
●
●
Win back lost customers
●
●
Win new customers
Therefore, companies are developing quality improvement processes. Figure 20–1 
shows the five quality principles that support Kodak’s quality policy. Figure 20–2 shows 
a more detailed quality improvement process. These two figures seem to illustrate that 
organizations are placing more emphasis on the quality process than on the quality product 
and, therefore, are actively pursuing quality improvements through a continuous cycle.
20.2 THE QUALITY MOVEMENT
During the past hundred years, the views of quality have changed dra-
matically. Prior to World War I, quality was viewed predominantly as 
inspection, sorting out the good items from the bad. Emphasis was 
on problem identification. Following World War I and up to the early 
1950s, emphasis was still on sorting good items from bad. However, quality control princi-
ples were now emerging in the form of:
●
●
Statistical and mathematical techniques
●
●
Sampling tables
●
●
Process control charts

Quality Management 
From the early 1950s to the late 1960s, quality control evolved into quality assurance, 
with its emphasis on problem avoidance rather than problem detection. Additional quality 
assurance principles emerged, such as:
●
●
The cost of quality
●
●
Zero-defect programs
●
●
Reliability engineering
●
●
Total quality control
Today, emphasis is being placed on strategic quality management, including such top-
ics as:
●
●
Quality is defined by the customer.
●
●
Quality is linked with profitability on both the market and cost sides.

The Quality Movement

●
●
Quality has become a competitive weapon.
●
●
Quality is now an integral part of the strategic planning process.
●
●
Quality requires an organization-wide commitment.
Although many experts have contributed to the success of the quality movement, the 
three most influential contributors are W. Edwards Deming, Joseph M. Juran, and Phillip 
B. Crosby. Dr. Deming pioneered the use of statistics and sampling methods from 1927 
to 1940 at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. During these early years, Dr. Deming was 
influenced by Dr. Shewhart, and later applied Shewhart’s Plan/Do/Check/Act cycle to cler-
ical tasks. Figure 20–3 shows the Deming Cycle for Improvement.
Deming believed that the reason companies were not producing quality products was 
that management was preoccupied with “today” rather than the future. Deming postulated 
that 85 percent of all quality problems required management to take the initiative and 
change the process. Only 15 percent of the quality problems could be controlled by the 
workers on the floor. As an example, the workers on the floor were not at fault because of 
the poor quality of raw materials that resulted from management’s decision to seek out the 
lowest-cost suppliers. Management needed to change the purchasing policies and proce-
dures and develop long-term relationships with vendors.
Processes had to be placed under statistical analysis and control to demonstrate the 
repeatability of quality. Furthermore, the ultimate goals should be a continuous refinement 
of the processes rather than quotas. Statistical process control charts (SPCs) allowed for the 
identification of common cause and special (assignable) cause variations. Common cause 
variations are inherent in any process. They include poor lots of raw material, poor product 
design, unsuitable work conditions, and equipment that cannot meet the design tolerances. 
These common causes are beyond the control of the workers on the floor and therefore, for 
improvement to occur, actions by management are necessary.
Special or assignable causes include lack of knowledge by workers, worker mistakes, 
or workers not paying attention during production. Special causes can be identified by 
Figure 20-3.  The Deming Cycle for Improvement.

workers on the shop floor and corrected, but management still needs to change the manu-
facturing process to reduce common cause variability.
Deming contended that workers simply cannot do their best. They had to be shown 
what constitutes acceptable quality and that continuous improvement is not only possible, 
but necessary. For this to be accomplished, workers had to be trained in the use of statistical 
process control charts. Realizing that even training required management’s approval, Dem-
ing’s lectures became more and more focused toward management and what they must do.
Dr. Juran began conducting quality control courses in Japan in 1954, four years after Dr. 
Deming. Dr. Juran developed his 10 Steps to Quality Improvement (see Table 20–2), as well 
as the Juran Trilogy: Quality Improvement, Quality Planning, and Quality Control. Juran 
stressed that the manufacturer’s view of quality is adherence to specifications but the cus-
tomer’s view of quality is “fitness for use.” Juran defined five attributes of “fitness for use.”
●
●
Quality of design: There may be many grades of quality
●
●
Quality of conformance: Provide the proper training; products that maintain speci-
fication tolerances; motivation

Quality Management Concepts
703
●
●
Availability: reliability (i.e., frequency of repairs) and maintainability (i.e., speed 
or ease of repair)
●
●
Safety: The potential hazards of product use
●
●
Field use: This refers to the way the product will be used by the customer
Dr. Juran also stressed the cost of quality (Section 20.3) and the legal implications of 
quality. The legal aspects of quality include:
●
●
Criminal liability
●
●
Civil liability
●
●
Appropriate corporate actions
●
●
Warranties
Juran believes that the contractor’s view of quality is conformance to specification, 
whereas the customer’s view of quality is fitness for use when delivered and value. Juran 
also admits that there can exist many grades of quality. The characteristics of quality can 
be defined as:
●
●
Structural (length, frequency)
●
●
Sensory (taste, beauty, appeal)
●
●
Time-oriented (reliability, maintainability)
●
●
Commercial (warrantee)
●
●
Ethical (courtesy, honesty)
The third major contributor to quality was Phillip B. Crosby. Crosby developed his 14 
Steps to Quality Improvement (see Table 20–2) and his Four Absolutes of Quality:
●
●
Quality means conformance to requirements.
●
●
Quality comes from prevention.
●
●
Quality means that the performance standard is “zero defects.”
●
●
Quality is measured by the cost of nonconformance.
Crosby found that the cost of not doing things right the first time could be appreci-
able. In manufacturing, the price of nonconformance averages 40 percent of operating 
costs.
20.3 QUALITY MANAGEMENT CONCEPTS
The project manager has the ultimate responsibility for quality man-
agement on the project. Quality management has equal priority with 
cost and Chapter 8 Introduction schedule management. However, the 
direct measurement of quality may be the responsibility of the quality 
assurance department or the assistant project manager for quality. For 
PMBOK® Guide, 6th Edition
Chapter 8 Project Procurement Man-
agement Introduction
8.1.1 Plan Quality Management Inputs

704
Quality Management 
a labor-intensive project, management support (i.e., the project office) is typically 12–15 
percent of the total labor dollars of the project. Approximately 3–5 percent can be attrib-
uted to quality management. Therefore, as much as 20–30 percent of all the labor in the 
project office could easily be attributed to quality management.
From a project manager’s perspective, there are six quality management concepts that 
should exist to support each and every project:
1.	 Quality policy
2.	 Quality objectives
3.	 Quality assurance
4.	 Quality control
5.	 Quality audit
6.	 Quality program plan
Ideally, these six concepts should be embedded within the corporate culture.
Quality Policy
The quality policy is a document that is typically created by quality 
experts and fully supported by top management. The policy should 
state the quality objectives, the level of quality acceptable to the organization, and the 
responsibility of the organization’s members for executing the policy and ensuring quality. 
A quality policy would also include statements by top management pledging its support to 
the policy. The quality policy is instrumental in creating the organization’s reputation and 
quality image.
Many organizations successfully complete a good quality policy but immediately sub-
marine the good intentions of the policy by delegating the implementation of the policy to 
lower-level managers. The implementation of the quality policy is the responsibility of top 
management. Top management must “walk the walk” as well as “talk the talk.” Employees 
will soon see through the ruse of a quality policy that is delegated to middle managers 
while top executives move onto “more crucial matters that really impact the bottom line.”
A good quality policy will:
●
●
Be a statement of principles stating what, not how
●
●
Promote consistency throughout the organization and across projects
●
●
Provide an explanation to outsiders of how the organization views quality
●
●
Provide specific guidelines for important quality matters
●
●
Provide provisions for changing/updating the policy
Quality Objectives
Quality objectives are a part of an organization’s quality policy and 
consist of specific objectives and the time frame for completing them. 
The quality objectives must be selected carefully. Selecting objectives that are not naturally 
possible can cause frustration and disillusionment. Examples of acceptable quality objec-
tives might be: to train all members of the organization on the quality policy and objec-
tives before the end of the current fiscal year, to set up baseline measurements of specific 

Quality Management Concepts
705
processes by the end of the current quarter, to define the responsibility and authority for 
meeting the organization’s quality objectives down to each member of the organization by 
the end of the current fiscal year, and the like. Good quality objectives should:
●
●
Be obtainable
●
●
Define specific goals
●
●
Be understandable
●
●
State specific deadlines
Quality Assurance
PMBOK® Guide, 6th Edition
8.2 Manage Quality
Quality assurance is the collective term for the formal activities 
and managerial processes that attempt to ensure that products and 
services meet the required quality level. Quality assurance also 
includes efforts external to these processes that provide informa-
tion for improving the internal processes. It is the quality assurance 
function that attempts to ensure that the project scope, cost, and time functions are fully 
integrated.
The Project Management Institute Guide to the Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide) 
refers to quality assurance as the management section of quality management. This is the 
area where the project manager can have the greatest impact on the quality of his project. The 
project manager needs to establish the administrative processes and procedures necessary 
to ensure and, often, prove that the scope statement conforms to the actual requirements of 
the customer. The project manager must work with his team to determine which processes 
they will use to ensure that all stakeholders have confidence that the quality activities will 
be properly performed. All relevant legal and regulatory requirements must also be met.
●
●
A good quality assurance system will:
●
●
Identify objectives and standards
●
●
Be multifunctional and prevention oriented
●
●
Plan for collection and use of data in a cycle of continuous improvement
●
●
Plan for the establishment and maintenance of performance measures
●
●
Include quality audits
Quality Control
Quality control is a collective term for activities and techniques, within 
the process, that are intended to create specific quality characteristics. 
Such activities include continually monitoring processes, identifying and eliminating prob-
lem causes, use of statistical process control to reduce the variability and to increase the 
efficiency of processes. Quality control certifies that the organization’s quality objectives 
are being met.
The PMBOK® Guide refers to quality control as the technical aspect of quality manage-
ment. Project team members who have specific technical expertise on the various aspects 
of the project play an active role in quality control. They set up the technical processes 
and procedures that ensure that each step of the project provides a quality output from 
design and development through implementation and maintenance. Each step’s output 

706
Quality Management 
must conform to the overall quality standards and quality plans, thus ensuring that quality 
is achieved.
A good quality control system will:
●
●
Select what to control
●
●
Set standards that provide the basis for decisions regarding possible corrective 
action
●
●
Establish the measurement methods used
●
●
Compare the actual results to the quality standards
●
●
Act to bring nonconforming processes and material back to the standard based on 
the information collected
●
●
Monitor and calibrate measuring devices
●
●
Include detailed documentation for all processes
Quality Audit
PMBOK® Guide, 6th Edition
8.2.2.5 Quality Audit
A quality audit is an independent evaluation performed by qualified 
personnel that ensures that the project is conforming to the project’s 
quality requirements and is following the established quality proce-
dures and policies.
A good quality audit will ensure that:
●
●
The planned quality for the project will be met.
●
●
The products are safe and fit for use.
●
●
All pertinent laws and regulations are followed.
●
●
Data collection and distribution systems are accurate and adequate.
●
●
Proper corrective action is taken when required.
●
●
Improvement opportunities are identified.
Quality Plan
The quality plan is created by the project manager and project team 
members by breaking down the project objectives into a work break-
down structure. Using a treelike diagramming technique, the project 
activities are broken down into lower-level activities until specific 
quality actions can be identified. The project manager then ensures 
that these actions are documented and implemented in the sequence 
that will meet the customer’s requirements and expectations. This enables the project man-
ager to assure the customer that he has a road map to delivering a quality product or service 
and therefore will satisfy the customer’s needs.
A good quality plan will:
●
●
Identify all of the organization’s external and internal customers
●
●

The Cost of Quality
707
20.4 THE COST OF QUALITY
To verify that a product or service meets the customer’s require-
ments requires the measurement of the costs of quality. For simplic-
ity’s sake, the costs can be classified as “the cost of conformance” 
and “the cost of nonconformance.” Conformance costs include items 
such as training, indoctrination, verification, validation, testing, maintenance, calibration, 
and audits. Nonconforming costs include items such as scrap, rework, warranty repairs, 
product recalls, and complaint handling.
Trying to save a few project dollars by reducing conformance costs could prove disas-
trous. For example, an American company won a contract as a supplier of Japanese parts. 
The initial contract called for the delivery of 10,000 parts. During inspection and testing at 
the customer’s (i.e., Japanese) facility, two rejects were discovered. The Japanese returned 
all 10,000 components to the American supplier, stating that this batch was not acceptable. 
In this example, the nonconformance cost could easily be an order of magnitude greater 
than the conformance cost. The moral is clear: Build it right the first time.
Another common method to classify costs includes the following:
●
●
Prevention costs are the up-front costs oriented toward the satisfaction of cus-
tomer’s requirements with the first and all succeeding units of product produced 
without defects. Included in this are typically such costs as design review, training, 
quality planning, surveys of vendors, suppliers, and subcontractors, process stud-
ies, and related preventive activities.
●
●
Appraisal costs are costs associated with evaluation of product or process to ascer-
tain how well all of the requirements of the customer have been met. Included in 
this are typically such costs as inspection of product, lab test, vendor control, in-
process testing, and internal–external design reviews.
●
●
Internal failure costs are those costs associated with the failure of the processes to 
make products acceptable to the customer, before leaving the control of the organi-
zation. Included in this area are scrap, rework, repair, downtime, defect evaluation, 
evaluation of scrap, and corrective actions for these internal failures.
●
●
External failure costs are those costs associated with the determination by the cus-
tomer that his requirements have not been satisfied. Included are customer returns 
and allowances, evaluation of customer complaints, inspection at the customer, 
and customer visits to resolve quality complaints and necessary corrective action.
Figure 20–4 shows the expected results of the total quality management system on 
quality costs. Prevention costs are expected to actually rise as more time is spent in pre-
vention activities throughout the organization. As processes improve over the long run, 
appraisal costs will go down as the need to inspect in quality decreases. The biggest savings 
will come from the internal failure areas of rework, scrap, reengineering, redo, and so on. 
The additional time spent in up-front design and development will really pay off here. And, 
finally, the external costs will also come down as processes yield first-time quality on a reg-
ular basis. The improvements will continue to affect the company on a long-term basis in 
both improved quality and lower costs. Also, as project management matures, there should 
be further decreases in the cost of both maintaining quality and developing products.

Figure 20–4 shows that prevention costs can increase. This is not always the case. 
Prevention costs actually decrease without sacrificing the purpose of prevention if we can 
identify and eliminate the costs associated with waste, such as waste due to

●
●

●
●
Improper utilization of facilities
●
●
Excessive expenses that do not necessarily contribute to the project (i.e., unneces-
sary meetings, travel, lodgings, etc.)
Another important aspect of Figure 20–4 is that 50 percent or more of the total cost 
of quality can be attributed to the internal and external failure costs. Complete elimination 
of failures may seem like an ideal solution but may not be cost-effective. As an example, 
see Figure 20–5. There are assumptions in the development of this figure. First, the cost of 
failure (i.e., nonconformance) approaches zero as defects become fewer and fewer. Second, 
the conformance costs of appraisal and prevention approach infinity as defects become 
fewer and fewer.
If the ultimate goal of a quality program is to continuously improve quality, then from 
a financial standpoint, quality improvement may not be advisable if the positive economic

return becomes negative. Juran argued that as long as the per-unit cost for prevention and 
appraisal were less expensive than nonconformance costs, resources should be assigned 
to prevention and appraisal. But when prevention and appraisal costs begin to increase the 
per-unit cost of quality, then the policy should be to maintain quality. The implication here 
is that zero defects may not be a practical solution since the total cost of quality would not 
be minimized.
Figure 20–4 shows that the external failure costs are much lower than the internal 
failure costs. This indicates that most of the failures are being discovered before they leave 
the functional areas or plants.
20.5 THE SEVEN QUALITY CONTROL TOOLS
Over the years, statistical methods have become prevalent through-
out business, industry, and science. With the availability of advanced, 
automated systems that collect, tabulate, and analyze data, the practi-
cal application of these quantitative methods continues to grow.

More important than the quantitative methods themselves is their impact on the basic 
philosophy of business. The statistical point of view takes decision making out of the sub-
jective autocratic decision-making arena by providing the basis for objective decisions 
based on quantifiable facts. This change provides some very specific benefits:
●
●
Improved process information
●
●
Better communication
●
●
Discussion based on facts
●
●
Consensus for action
●
●
Information for process changes
Statistical process control (SPC) takes advantage of the natural characteristics of any 
process. All business activities can be described as specific processes with known toler-
ances and measurable variances. The measurement of these variances and the resulting 
information provide the basis for continuous process improvement. The tools presented 
here provide both a graphical and measured representation of process data. The systematic 
application of these tools empowers business people to control products and processes to 
become world-class competitors.
The basic tools of statistical process control are data figures, Pareto analysis, cause-
and-effect analysis, trend analysis, histograms, scatter diagrams, and process control 
charts. These basic tools provide for the efficient collection of data, identification of 
patterns in the data, and measurement of variability. Figure 20–6 shows the relationships 
among these seven tools and their use for the identification and analysis of improvement 
opportunities. We will review these tools and discuss their implementation and applica-
tions.

Data Tables
Data tables, or data arrays, provide a systematic method for collecting 
and displaying data. In most cases, data tables are forms designed for 
the purpose of collecting specific data. These tables are used most frequently where data 
are available from automated media. They provide a consistent, effective, and economical 
approach to gathering data, organizing them for analysis, and displaying them for prelimi-
nary review. Data tables sometimes take the form of manual check sheets where automated 
data are not necessary or available. Data figures and check sheets should be designed to 
minimize the need for complicated entries. Simple-to-understand, straightforward tables 
are a key to successful data gathering.
Figure 20–7 is an example of an attribute (pass/fail) data figure for the correctness 
of invoices. From this simple check sheet, several data points become apparent. The total 
number of defects is 34. The highest number of defects is from supplier A, and the most 
frequent defect is incorrect test documentation. We can subject these data to further analy-
sis by using Pareto analysis, control charts, and other statistical tools.

Cause-and-Effect Analysis
After identifying a problem, it is necessary to determine its cause. 
The cause-and-effect relationship is at times obscure. A considerable 
amount of analysis often is required to determine the specific cause or causes of the prob-
lem. Cause-and-effect analysis uses diagramming techniques to identify the relationship 
between an effect and its causes. Cause-and-effect diagrams are also known as fishbone 
diagrams. Figure 20–8 demonstrates the basic fishbone diagram. Six steps are used to per-
form a cause-and-effect analysis.
Step 1. Identify the problem. This step often involves the use of other statistical process 
control tools, such as Pareto analysis, histograms, and control charts, as well as 
brainstorming. The result is a clear, concise problem statement.
Step 2. Select interdisciplinary brainstorming team. The team is selected based on 
the technical, analytical, and management knowledge required to determine the 
causes of the problem.
The Seven Quality Control Tools

Step 3. Draw problem box and prime arrow. The problem contains the problem state-
ment being evaluated for cause and effect. The prime arrow functions as the foun-
dation for their major categories.
Step 4. Specify major categories. Identify the major categories contributing to the 
problem stated in the problem box. The six basic categories for the primary caus-
es of the problems are most frequently personnel, method, materials, machinery, 
measurements, and environment, as shown in Figure 20–8. Other categories may 
be specified, based on the needs of the analysis.
Step 5. Identify defect causes. When you have identified the major causes contribut-
ing to the problem, you can determine the causes related to each of the major 
categories. There are three approaches to this analysis: the random method, the 
systematic method, and the process analysis method.
Random method. List all six major causes contributing to the problem at the same 
time. Identify the possible causes related to each of the categories, as shown in 
Figure 20–9.

Systematic method. Focus your analysis on one major category at a time, in descend-
ing order of importance. Move to the next most important category only after 
completing the most important one. This process is diagrammed in Figure 20–10.
Process analysis method. Identify each sequential step in the process and perform 
cause-and-effect analysis for each step, one at a time. Figure 20–11 represents 
this approach.
Step 6. Identify corrective action. Based on (1) the cause-and-effect analysis of the 
problem and (2) the determination of causes contributing to each major category, 
identify corrective action. The corrective action analysis is performed in the same 
manner as the cause-and-effect analysis. The cause-and-effect diagram is simply 
reversed so that the problem box becomes the corrective action box. Figure 20–12 
displays the method for identifying corrective action.

Histogram
A histogram is a graphical representation of data as a frequency distri-
bution. This tool is valuable in evaluating both attribute (pass/fail) and 
variable (measurement) data. Histograms offer a quick look at the data at a single point 
in time; they do not display variance or trends over time. A histogram displays how the 
cumulative data look today. It is useful in understanding the relative frequencies (percent-

Pareto Analysis
PMBOK® Guide, 6th Edition
8.3.2 Control Quality—Tools and 
Techniques
A Pareto diagram is a special type of histogram that helps us to identify 
and prioritize problem areas. The construction of a Pareto diagram may 
involve data collected from data figures, maintenance data, repair 
data, parts scrap rates, or other sources. By identifying types of non-
conformity from any of these data sources, the Pareto diagram directs 
attention to the most frequently occurring element.
There are three uses and types of Pareto analysis. The basic Pareto analysis identi-
fies the vital few contributors that account for most quality problems in any system. The 
comparative Pareto analysis focuses on any number of program options or actions. The 
weighted Pareto analysis gives a measure of significance to factors that may not appear 
significant at first—such additional factors as cost, time, and criticality.
The basic Pareto analysis chart provides an evaluation of the most frequent occur-
rences for any given data set. By applying the Pareto analysis steps to the material receipt 

and inspection process described in Figure 20–14, we can produce the basic Pareto analy-
sis demonstrated in Figure 20–15. This basic Pareto analysis quantifies and graphs the 
frequency of occurrence for material receipt and inspection and further identifies the most 
significant, based on frequency.
A review of this basic Pareto analysis for frequency of occurrences indicates that sup-
plier A is experiencing the most rejections with 38 percent of all the failures. Pareto analy-
sis diagrams are also used to determine the effect of corrective action, or to analyze the 
difference between two or more processes and methods. Figure 20–16 displays the use of 
this Pareto method to assess the difference in defects after corrective action.
Another pictorial representation of process control data is the scatter plot or scatter 
diagram. A scatter diagram organizes data using two variables: an independent variable

and a dependent variable. These data are then recorded on a simple graph with X and 
Y coordinates showing the relationship between the variables. Figure 20–17 displays the 
relationship between two of the data elements from solder qualification test scores. The 
independent variable, experience in months, is listed on the X axis. The dependent variable 
is the score, which is recorded on the Y axis.
These relationships fall into several categories, as shown in Figure 20–18. In the first 
scatter plot there is no correlation—the data points are widely scattered with no apparent 
pattern. The second scatter plot shows a curvilinear correlation demonstrated by the U 
shape of the graph. The third scatter plot has a negative correlation, as indicated by the 
downward slope. The final scatter plot has a positive correlation with an upward slope.
From Figure 20–17 we can see that the scatter plot for solder certification testing 
is somewhat curvilinear. The least and the most experienced employees scored highest, 
whereas those with an intermediate level of experience did relatively poorly. The next tool, 
trend analysis, will help clarify and quantify these relationships.

Trend analysis is a statistical method for determining the equation that 
best fits the data in a scatter plot. Trend analysis quantifies the rela-
tionships of the data, determines the equation, and measures the fit of 
the equation to the data. This method is also known as curve fitting 
or least squares.
Trend analysis can determine optimal operating conditions by 
providing an equation that describes the relationship between the dependent (output) and 
independent (input) variables. An example is the data set concerning experience and scores 
on the solder certification test (see Figure 20–19).

The equation of the regression line, or trend line, provides a clear and understandable 
measure of the change caused in the output variable by every incremental change of the 
input or independent variable. Using this principle, we can predict the effect of changes in 
the process.
One of the most important contributions that can be made by trend analysis is forecast-
ing. Forecasting enables us to predict what is likely to occur in the future. Based on the 
regression line we can forecast what will happen as the independent variable attains values 
beyond the existing data.
Control Charts
The use of control charts focuses on the prevention of defects, rather 
than their detection and rejection. In business, government, and indus-
try, economy and efficiency are always best served by prevention. It 
costs much more to produce an unsatisfactory product or service than 
it does to produce a satisfactory one. There are many costs associated 
with producing unsatisfactory goods and services. These costs are in 
labor, materials, facilities, and the loss of customers.
The cost of producing a proper product can be reduced significantly by the application 
of statistical process control charts.
Control Charts and the Normal Distribution
The construction, use, and interpretation of control charts is based on the normal statisti-
cal distribution as indicated in Figure 20–20. The centerline of the control chart repre-
sents the average or mean of the data (X ). The upper and lower control limits (UCL and 
LCL, respectively) represent this mean plus and minus three standard deviations of the 
data (X
s
± 3 ). Either the lowercase s or the Greek letter σ (sigma) represents the standard 
deviation for control charts.

The normal distribution and its relationship to control charts is represented on the right 
of the figure. The normal distribution can be described entirely by its mean and standard 
deviation. The normal distribution is a bell-shaped curve (sometimes called the Gaussian 
distribution) that is symmetrical about the mean, slopes downward on both sides to infin-
ity, and theoretically has an infinite range. In the normal distribution 99.73 percent of all 
measurements lie within X  + 3s and X  – 3s; this is why the limits on control charts are 
called three-sigma limits.
Companies like Motorola have embarked upon a six-sigma limit rather than a three-
sigma limit. The benefit is shown in Table 20–3. With a six-sigma limit, only two defects 
per billion are allowed. Maintaining a six-sigma limit can be extremely expensive unless 
the cost can be spread out over, say, 1 billion units produced.
Control chart analysis determines whether the inherent process variability and the 
process average are at stable levels, whether one or both are out of statistical control (not 
stable), or whether appropriate action needs to be taken. Another purpose of using con-
trol charts is to distinguish between the inherent, random variability of a process and the 
variability attributed to an assignable cause. The sources of random variability are often 
referred to as common causes. These are the sources that cannot be changed readily, with-
out significant restructuring of the process. Special cause variability, by contrast, is subject 
to correction within the process under process control.
●
●
Common cause variability or variation: This source of random variation is always 
present in any process. It is that part of the variability inherent in the process itself. 
The cause of this variation can be corrected only by a management decision to 
change the basic process.
●
●
Special cause variability or variation: This variation can be controlled at the local 
or operational level. Special causes are indicated by a point on the control chart that 
is beyond the control limit or by a persistent trend approaching the control limit.
Control Chart Types
Just as there are two types of data, continuous and discrete, there are 
two types of control charts: variable charts for use with continuous 
data and attribute charts for use with discrete data. Each type of con-
trol chart can be used with specific types of data. Table 20–4 provides 
a brief overview of the types of control charts and their applications.

Variables Charts. Control charts for variables are powerful tools that we can use when 
measurements from a process are variable. Examples of variable data are the diameter of a 
bearing, electrical output, or the torque on a fastener.
As shown in Table 20–4, X and R charts are used to measure control processes whose 
characteristics are continuous variables such as weight, length, ohms, time, or volume. The 
p and np charts are used to measure and control processes displaying attribute characteris-
tics in a sample. We use p charts when the number of failures is expressed as a fraction, or 
np charts when the failures are expressed as a number. The c and u charts are used to meas-
ure the number or portion of defects in a single item. The c control chart is applied when 
the sample size or area is fixed, and the u chart when the sample size or area is not fixed.
Attribute Charts. Although control charts are most often thought of in terms of varia-
bles, there are also versions for attributes. Attribute data have only two values (conforming/
nonconforming, pass/fail, go/no-go, present/absent), but they can still be counted, recorded, 
and analyzed. Some examples are: the presence of a required label, the installation of all 
required fasteners, the presence of solder drips, or the continuity of an electrical circuit. We 
also use attribute charts for characteristics that are measurable, if the results are recorded 
in a simple yes/no fashion, such as the conformance of a shaft diameter when measured 
on a go/no-go gauge, or the acceptability of threshold margins to a visual or gauge check.
It is possible to use control charts for operations in which attributes are the basis for 
inspection, in a manner similar to that for variables but with certain differences. If we deal 
with the fraction rejected out of a sample, the type of control chart used is called a p chart. 
If we deal with the actual number rejected, the control chart is called an np chart. If articles 
can have more than one nonconformity, and all are counted for subgroups of fixed size, the 
control chart is called a c chart. Finally, if the number of nonconformities per unit is the 
quantity of interest, the control chart is called a u chart.
The power of control charts (Shewhart techniques) lies in their ability to determine 
if the cause of variation is a special cause that can be affected at the process level, or a 
common cause that requires a change at the management level. The information from the 
control chart can then be used to direct the efforts of engineers, technicians, and managers 
to achieve preventive or corrective action.
The use of statistical control charts is aimed at studying specific ongoing processes 
in order to keep them in satisfactory control. By contrast, downstream inspection aims to

identify defects. In other words, control charts focus on prevention of defects rather than 
detection and rejection. It seems reasonable, and it has been confirmed in practice, that 
economy and efficiency are better served by prevention rather than detection.
Control Chart Interpretation
There are many possibilities for interpreting various kinds of patterns 
and shifts on control charts. If properly interpreted, a control chart 
can tell us much more than whether the process is in or out of con-
trol. Experience and training can help extract clues regarding process 
behavior. Statistical guidance is invaluable, but an intimate knowledge of the process being 
studied is vital in bringing about improvements. A control chart can tell us when to look for 
trouble, but it cannot by itself tell us where to look, or what cause will be found. Actually, 
in many cases, one of the greatest benefits from a control chart is that it tells when to leave 
a process alone. Sometimes the variability is increased unnecessarily when an operator 
keeps trying to make small corrections, rather than letting the natural range of variability 
stabilize.
20.6 ACCEPTANCE SAMPLING
Acceptance sampling is a statistical process of evaluating a portion 
of a lot for the purpose of accepting or rejecting the entire lot. It is 
an attempt to monitor the quality of the incoming product or material 
after the completion of production.
The alternatives to developing a sampling plan would be 100% inspection and 0% 
inspection. The costs associated with 100% are prohibitive, and the risks associated with 
0% inspection are likewise large. Therefore, some sort of compromise is needed. The three 
most commonly used sampling plans are:
●
●
Single sampling: This is the acceptance or rejection of a lot based upon one sam-
pling run.
●
●
Double sampling: A small sample size is tested. If the results are not conclusive, 
then a second sample is tested.
●
●
Multiple sampling: This process requires the sampling of several small lots.
Regardless of what type of sampling plan is chosen, sampling errors can occur. A ship-
ment of good-quality items can be rejected if a large portion of defective units are selected 
at random. Likewise, a bad-quality shipment can be accepted if the tested sample contains 
a disproportionately large number of quality items. The two major risks are:
●
●
Producer’s risk: This is called the α (alpha) risk or type I error. This is the risk to 
the producer that a good lot will be rejected.
●
●
Consumer’s risk: This is called the β (beta) risk or type II error. This is the con-
sumer’s risk of accepting a bad lot.

Quality Management 
Six Sigma is a quality initiative that was born at Motorola in the 1980s. 
The primary focus of the Six Sigma process improvement methodol-
ogy, also known as DMAIC, is to reduce defects that are defined by the customer of the 
process. This customer can be internal or external. It is whoever is in receipt of the process 
output. Defects are removed by careful examination from a Six Sigma team made up of 
cross-functional positions having different lines of sight into the process. The team follows 
the rigor of the methodology of define, measure, analyze, improve, and control (DMAIC) 
to determine the root cause(s) of the defects. The team uses data and appropriate numeri-
cal and graphical analysis tools to raise awareness of process variables generating defects. 
Data collection and analysis is at the core of Six Sigma. “Extinction by instinct” is the 
phrase often used to describe intuitive decision making and performance analysis. It has 
been known to generate rework, frustration, and ineffective solutions. Six Sigma prescribes 
disciplined gathering and analysis of data to effectively identify solutions.
Lean manufacturing is another aspect of process improvement derived mostly from 
the Toyota Production System (TPS). The primary focus of lean is to remove waste and 
improve process efficiency. Lean is often linked with Six Sigma because both empha-
size the importance of minimal process variation. Lean primarily consists of a set of tools 
When a lot is tested for quality, we can look at either “attribute” or “variable” quality 
data. Attribute quality data are either quantitative or qualitative data for which the product 
or service is designed and built. Variable quality data are quantitative, continuous meas-
urement processes to either accept or reject the lot. The exact measurement can be either 
destructive or nondestructive testing.
20.7 IMPLEMENTING SIX SIGMA
Six Sigma is a business initiative first espoused by Motorola in the 
early 1990s. Recent Six Sigma success stories, primarily from the 
likes of General Electric, Sony, AlliedSignal, and Motorola, have 
captured the attention of Wall Street and have propagated the use of 
this business strategy. The Six Sigma strategy involves the use of statistical tools within a 
structured methodology for gaining the knowledge needed to create products and services 
better, faster, and less expensively than the competition. The repeated, disciplined applica-
tion of the master strategy on project after project, where the projects are selected based on 
key business issues, is what drives dollars to the bottom line, resulting in increased profit 
margins and impressive return on investment from the Six Sigma training. The Six Sigma 
initiative has typically contributed an average of six figures per project to the bottom line. 
Ultimately, Six Sigma, if deployed properly, will infuse intellectual capital into a company 
and produce unprecedented knowledge gains that translate directly into bottom line results

Lean Six Sigma and DMAIC

Quality Leadership

designed to assist in the identification and steady elimination of waste (muda), allowing 
for the improvement of quality as well as cycle time and cost reduction. To solve the prob-
lem of waste, lean manufacturing utilizes several tools. These include accelerated DMAIC 
projects known as kaizen events, cause-and-effect analysis using “five whys,” and error 
proofing with a technique known as poka-yoke.
Kaizen Events. The source of the word kaizen is Japanese: kai (take apart) and zen 
(make good). This is an action-oriented approach to process improvement. Team members 
devote 3–5 consecutive days to quickly work through the DMAIC methodology in a work-
shop fashion.
Five Whys. This technique is used to move past symptoms of problems and drill down to 
the root causes. With every answer comes a new question until you’ve gotten to the bottom 
of the problem. Five is a rule of thumb. Sometimes you’ll only need three questions, other 
times it might take seven. The goal is to identify the root cause of process defects and waste.
Poka-Yoke. The source of this technique is Japanese: yokeru (to avoid) and poka (inad-
vertent errors). There are three main principles of poka-yoke. (1) Make wrong actions more 
difficult. (2) Make mistakes obvious to the person so that the mistake can be corrected. 
(3) Detect errors so that downstream consequences can be prevented by stopping the flow 
or other corrective action. The philosophy behind this technique is that it’s good to do things 
right the first time, but it is even better to make it impossible to do it wrong the first time.
When Six Sigma and lean manufacturing are integrated, the project team utilizes the 
project management methodology to lead them through the lean Six Sigma toolbox and 
make dramatic improvements to business processes. The overall goal is to reduce defects 
that impact the internal and external customer and eliminate waste that impact the cycle 
times and costs.
20.8 QUALITY LEADERSHIP
Consider for a moment the following seven items:
●
●
Teamwork
●
●
Strategic integration
●
●
Continuous improvement
●
●
Respect for people
●
●
Customer focus
●
●
Management-by-fact
●
●
Structured problem solving
Some people contend that these seven items are the principles of project management 
when, in fact, they are the seven principles of the total quality management program at 
Sprint. Project management and TQM have close similarity in leadership and team-based 
decision making.

Quality Management 
Quality leadership emphasizes results by working on methods. In this type of manage-
ment, every work process is studied and constantly improved so that the final product or 
service not only meets but exceeds customer expectations. The principles of quality leader-
ship are customer focus, obsession with quality, effective work structure, control yet free-
dom (e.g., management in control of employees yet freedom given to employees), unity of 
purpose, process defect identification, teamwork, and education and training. These princi-
ples are more conducive to long-term thinking, correctly directed efforts, and a keen regard 
for the customer’s interest.
To give quality leadership, the historical hierarchical management structure needs to 
be changed to a structure that has a more unified purpose using project teams. A single per-
son can make a big difference in an organization. However, one person rarely has enough 
knowledge or experience to understand everything within a process. Major gains in both 
quality and productivity can often result when a team of people pool their skills, talents, 
and knowledge.
Teams need to have a systematic plan to improve the process that creates mistakes/
defects, breakdowns/delays, inefficiencies, and variation. For a given work environment, 
management needs to create an atmosphere that supports team effort in all aspects of busi-
ness. In some organizations, management may need to create a process that describes hier-
archical relationships between teams, the flow of directives, how directives are transformed 
into action and improvements, and the degree of autonomy and responsibility of the teams. 
The change to quality leadership can be very difficult. It requires dedication and patience 
to transform an entire organization.
20.9 RESPONSIBILITY FOR QUALITY
Everyone in an organization plays an important role in quality management. In order for 
an organization to become a quality organization, all levels must actively participate, and, 
according to Dr. Edwards Deming, the key to successful implementation of quality starts 
at the top.
Top management must drive fear from the workplace and create an environment where 
cross-functional cooperation can flourish. The ultimate responsibility for quality in the 
organization lies in the hands of upper management. It is only with their enthusiastic and 
unwavering support that quality can thrive in an organization.
The project manager is ultimately responsible for the quality of the project. This is true 
for the same reason the president of the company is ultimately responsible for quality in 
a corporation. The project manager selects the procedures and policies for the project and 
therefore controls the quality. The project manager must create an environment that fosters 
trust and cooperation among the team members. The project manager must also support the 
identification and reporting of problems by team members and avoid at all costs a “shoot 
the messenger” mentality.
The project team members must be trained to identify problems, recommend solu-
tions, and implement the solutions. They must also have the authority to limit further pro-
cessing when a process is outside of specified limits. In other words, they must be able to 

Total Quality Management (TQM)
725
halt any activity that is outside of the quality limits set for the project and work toward a 
resolution of the problem at any point in the project.
20.10 QUALITY CIRCLES
Quality circles are small groups of employees who meet frequently to help resolve com-
pany quality problems and provide recommendations to management. Quality circles were 
initially developed in Japan and have achieved some degree of success in the United States.
The employees involved in quality circles meet frequently either at someone’s home 
or at the plant before the shift begins. The group identifies problems, analyzes data, rec-
ommends solutions, and carries out management-approved changes. The success of 
quality circles is heavily based upon management’s willingness to listen to employee 
­recommendations.
The key elements of quality circles include:
●
●
They give a team effort.
●
●
They are completely voluntary.
●
●
Employees are trained in group dynamics, motivation, communications, and prob-
lem solving.
●
●
Members rely upon each other for help.
●
●
Management support is active but as needed.
●
●
Creativity is encouraged.
●
●
Management listens to recommendations.
The benefits of quality circles include:
●
●
Improved quality of products and services
●
●
Better organizational communications
●
●
Improved worker performance
●
●
Improved morale
20.11 TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT (TQM)
There is no explicit definition of total quality management. Some 
people define it as providing the customer with quality products at 
the right time and at the right place. Others define it as meeting or 
exceeding customer requirements. Internally, TQM can be defined as less variability in the 
quality of the product and less waste.
Section 20.11 has been adapted from C. Carl Pegels, Total Quality Management (Danvers, MA: Boyd & Fraser, 
1995), pp. 4–27.

21.0 INTRODUCTION
As more industries accept project management as a way of life, the change in project management practices 
has taken place at an astounding rate. But what is even more important is the fact that these companies are 
sharing their accomplishments with other companies during benchmarking activities. Eight recent interest 
areas are included in this chapter:
●
●
The project management maturity model (PMMM)
●
●
Developing effective procedural documentation

21.1 THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT MATURITY MODEL (PMMM)
All companies desire excellence in project management. Unfortunately, not all companies 
recognize that the time frame can be shortened by performing strategic planning for project 
management. The simple use of project management, even for an extended period of time, 
does not lead to excellence. Instead, it can result in repetitive mistakes and, what’s worse, 
learning from your own mistakes rather than from the mistakes of others.
Strategic planning for project management is unlike other forms of strategic planning 
in that it is most often performed at the middle-management level, rather than by executive 
21

management. Executive management is still involved, mostly in a supporting role, and 
provides funding together with employee release time for the effort. Executive involvement 
will be necessary to make sure that whatever is recommended by middle management will 
not result in unwanted changes to the corporate culture.
Organizations tend to perform strategic planning for new products and services by lay-
ing out a well-thought-out plan and then executing the plan with the precision of a surgeon. 
Unfortunately, strategic planning for project management, if performed at all, is done on 
a trial-by-fire basis. However, there are models that can be used to assist corporations in 
­performing strategic planning for project management and achieving maturity and excel-
lence in a reasonable period of time.
The foundation for achieving excellence in project management can best be described 
as the project management maturity model (PMMM), which is composed of five levels, as 
shown in Figure 21–1. Each of the five levels represents a different degree of maturity in 
project management.
●
●
Level 1—Common Language: In this level, the organization recognizes the impor-
tance of project management and the need for a good understanding of the basic 
knowledge on project management, along with the accompanying language/­
terminology.

The Project Management Maturity Model (PMMM)
735
●
●
Level 2—Common Processes: In this level, the organization recognizes that com-
mon processes need to be defined and developed such that successes on one pro-
ject can be repeated on other projects. Also included in this level is the recognition 
that project management principles can be applied to and support other method-
ologies employed by the company.
●
●
Level 3—Singular Methodology: In this level, the organization recognizes the 
synergistic effect of combining all corporate methodologies into a singular 
methodology, the center of which is project management. The synergistic effects 
also make process control easier with a single methodology than with multiple 
methodologies.
●
●
Level 4—Benchmarking: This level contains the recognition that process improve-
ment is necessary to maintain a competitive advantage. Benchmarking must be 
performed on a continuous basis. The company must decide whom to benchmark 
and what to benchmark.
●
●
Level 5—Continuous Improvement: In this level, the organization evaluates the 
information obtained through benchmarking and must then decide whether or not 
this information will enhance the singular methodology.
When we talk about levels of maturity (and even life-cycle phases), there exists a 
common misbelief that all work must be accomplished sequentially (i.e., in series). This 
is not necessarily true. Certain levels can and do overlap. The magnitude of the overlap 
is based upon the amount of risk the organization is willing to tolerate. For example, a 
company can begin the development of project management checklists to support the 
methodology while it is still providing project management training for the workforce. A 
company can create a center for excellence in project management before benchmarking 
is undertaken.
Although overlapping does occur, the order in which the phases are completed cannot 
change. For example, even though Level 1 and Level 2 can overlap, Level 1 must still be 
completed before Level 2 can be completed. Overlapping of several of the levels can take 
place, as shown in Figure 21–2.
●
●
Overlap of Level 1 and Level 2: This overlap will occur because the organization 
can begin the development of project management processes either while refine-
ments are being made to the common language or during training.
●
●
Overlap of Level 3 and Level 4: This overlap occurs because, while the organiza-
tion is developing a singular methodology, plans are being made as to the process 
for improving the methodology.
●
●
Overlap of Level 4 and Level 5: As the organization becomes more and more 
committed to benchmarking and continuous improvement, the speed by which 
the organization wants changes to be made can cause these two levels to have 
significant overlap. The feedback from Level 5 back to Level 4 and Level 3, 
as shown in Figure 21–3, implies that these three levels form a continuous 
improvement cycle, and it may even be possible for all three of these levels to 
overlap.

Level 2 and Level 3 generally do not overlap. It may be possible to begin some of the 
Level 3 work before Level 2 is completed, but this is highly unlikely. Once a company is 
committed to a singular methodology, work on other methodologies generally terminates. 
Also, companies can create a Center for Excellence in project management early in the 
life-cycle process, but will not receive the full benefits until later on.
Risks can be assigned to each level of the PMMM. For simplicity’s sake, the risks can 
be labeled as low, medium, and high. The level of risk is most frequently associated with the 
impact on the corporate culture. The following definitions can be assigned to these three risks:
●
●
Low Risk: Virtually no impact upon the corporate culture, or the corporate culture 
is dynamic and readily accepts change.
●
●
Medium Risk: The organization recognizes that change is necessary but may be 
unaware of the impact of the change. Multiple-boss reporting would be an example 
of a medium risk.
●
●
High Risk: High risks occur when the organization recognizes that the changes 
resulting from the implementation of project management will cause a change 
in the corporate culture. Examples include the creation of project management 
methodologies, policies, and procedures, as well as decentralization of authority 
and decision making.
Level 3 has the highest risk and degree of difficulty for the organization. This is shown 
in Figure 21–4. Once an organization is committed to Level 3, the time and effort needed 
to achieve the higher levels of maturity have a low degree of difficulty. Achieving Level 3, 
however, may require a major shift in the corporate culture.
These types of maturity models will become more common in the future, with generic 
models being customized for individual companies. These models will assist management 
in performing strategic planning for excellence in project management.
21.2 DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE PROCEDURAL DOCUMENTATION
Good procedural documentation will accelerate the project management maturity process, 
foster support at all levels of management, and greatly improve project communications. 
The type of procedural documentation selected is heavily biased on whether we wish to 

738
Modern Developments in Project Management 
Even though procedural documents can provide all these benefits, 
management is often reluctant to implement or fully support a formal 
project management system. Management concerns often center around four issues: over-
head burden, start-up delays, stifled creativity, and reduced self-forcing control. First, the 
introduction of more organizational formality via policies, procedures, and forms might 
cost money, and additional funding may be needed to support and maintain the system. 
Second, the system is seen as causing start-up delays by requiring additional project defi-
nition before implementation can start. Third and fourth, the system is often perceived as 
stifling creativity and shifting project control from the responsible individual to an imper-
sonal process. The comment of one project manager may be typical: “My support person-
nel feel that we spend too much time planning a project up front; it creates a very rigid 
environment that stifles innovation. The only purpose seems to be establishing a basis for 
controls against outdated measures and for punishment rather than help in case of a con-
tingency.” This comment illustrates the potential misuse of formal project management 
systems to establish unrealistic controls and penalties for deviations from the program plan 
rather than to help to find solutions.
manage formally or informally, but it should show how to conduct project-oriented activi-
ties and how to communicate in such a multidimensional environment. The project man-
agement policies, procedures, forms, and guidelines can provide some of these tools for 
delineating the process, as well as a format for collecting, processing, and communicating 
project-related data in an orderly, standardized format. Project planning and tracking, 
however, involve more than just the generation of paperwork. They require the participa-
tion of the entire project team, including support departments, subcontractors, and top 
management, and this involvement fosters unity. Procedural documents help to:
●
●
Provide guidelines and uniformity
●
●
Encourage useful, but minimum, documentation
●
●
Communicate information clearly and effectively
●
●
Standardize data formats
●
●
Unify project teams
●
●
Provide a basis for analysis
●
●
Ensure document agreements for future reference
●
●
Refuel commitments
●
●
Minimize paperwork
●
●
Minimize conflict and confusion
●
●
Delineate work packages
●
●
Bring new team members on board
●
●
Build an experience track and method for future projects
Done properly, the process of project planning must involve both the performing and 
the customer organizations. This leads to visibility of the project at various organizational 
levels, and stimulates interest in the project and the desire for success.
The Challenges

Few companies have introduced project management procedures 
with ease. Most have experienced problems ranging from skepticism 
to sabotage of the procedural system. Many use incremental approaches to develop and 
implement their project management methodology. Doing this, however, is a multifaceted 
challenge to management. The problem is seldom one of understanding the techniques 
involved, such as budgeting and scheduling, but rather is a problem of involving the project 
team in the process, getting their input, support, and commitment, and establishing a sup-
portive environment.
The procedural guidelines and forms of an established project management methodol-
ogy can be especially useful during the project planning/definition phase. Not only does 
project management methodology help to delineate and communicate the four major sets 
of variables for organizing and managing the project—(1) tasks, (2) timing, (3) resources, 
and (4) responsibilities—it also helps to define measurable milestones, as well as report 
and review requirements. This provides project personnel the ability to measure project 
status and performance and supplies the crucial inputs for controlling the project toward 
the desired results.
Developing an effective project management methodology takes more than just a set of 
policies and procedures. It requires the integration of these guidelines and standards into the 
culture and value system of the organization. Management must lead the overall efforts and 
foster an environment conducive to teamwork. The greater the team spirit, trust, commitment, 
and quality of information exchange among team members, the more likely the team will be 
to develop effective decision-making processes, make individual and group commitments, 
focus on problem-solving, and operate in a self-forcing, self-correcting control mode.
Developing Effective Procedural Documentation
739
How to Make It Work
Established Practices
Although project managers may have the right to establish their own 
policies and procedures, many companies design project control forms 
that can be used uniformly on all projects. Project control forms serve two vital purposes 
by establishing a common framework from which:
●
●
The project manager will communicate with executives, functional managers, 
functional employees, and clients.
●
●
Executives and the project manager can make meaningful decisions concerning 
the allocation of resources.
Some large companies with mature project management structures maintain a separate 
functional unit for forms control. This is quite common in aerospace and defense, but is 
also becoming common practice in other industries and in some smaller companies.
Large companies with a multitude of different projects do not have the luxury of con-
trolling projects with three or four forms. There are different forms for planning, schedul-
ing, controlling, authorizing work, and so on. It is not uncommon for companies to have 
20 to 30 different forms, each dependent upon the type of project, length of project, dollar 
value, type of customer reporting, and other such arguments. Project managers are often 
allowed to set up their own administration for the project, which can lead to long-term 
damage if they each design their own forms for project control.

740
Modern Developments in Project Management 
The best method for limiting the number of forms appears to be the task force concept, 
where both managers and doers have the opportunity to provide input. This may appear to 
be a waste of time and money, but in the long run provides large benefits.
To be effective, the following ground rules can be used:
●
●
Task forces should include managers as well as doers.
●
●
Task force members must be willing to accept criticism from other peers, superiors, 
and especially subordinates who must “live” with these forms.
●
●
Upper-level management should maintain a rather passive (or monitoring) involvement.
●
●
A minimum of signature approvals should be required for each form.
●
●
Forms should be designed so that they can be updated periodically.
●
●
Functional managers and project managers must be dedicated and committed to 
the use of the forms.

Categorizing the Broad 
Spectrum of Documents
The dynamic nature of project management and its multifunctional 
involvement create a need for a multitude of procedural documents to 
guide a project through the various phases and stages of integration.
Especially for larger organizations, the challenge is not only to provide management 
guidelines for each project activity, but also to provide a coherent procedural framework 
within which project leaders from all disciplines can work and communicate with each 
other. Specifically, each policy or procedure must be consistent with and accommodating to 
the various other functions that interface with the project over its life cycle. This complex-
ity of intricate relations is illustrated in Figure 21–5.

Project Management Methodologies
741
One simple and effective way of categorizing the broad spectrum of procedural docu-
ments is by utilizing the work breakdown concept, as shown in Figure 21–6. Accordingly, 
the principal procedural categories are defined along the principal project life-cycle phases. 
Each category is then subdivided into (1) general management guidelines, (2) policies, (3) 
procedures, (4) forms, and (5) checklists. If necessary, the same concept can be carried 
forward one additional step to develop policies, procedures, forms, and checklists for the 
various project and functional sublevels of operation. Although this might be needed for 
very large programs, an effort should be made to minimize “layering” of policies and pro-
cedures to avoid new problems and costs. For most projects, a single document covers all 
levels of project operations.

As We Mature . . .
As companies become more mature in executing the project manage-
ment methodology, project management policies, and project man-
agement levels, procedures are disregarded and replaced with guidelines, forms, and 
checklists. More flexibility is provided the project manager. Unfortunately, this takes time 
because executives must have faith in the ability of the project management methodology 
to work without the rigid controls provided by policies and procedures. Yet all companies 
seem to go through the evolutionary stages of policies and procedures before they get to 
guidelines, forms, and checklists.
21.3 PROJECT MANAGEMENT METHODOLOGIES
The ultimate purpose of any project management system is to increase the likelihood that 
your organization will have a continuous stream of successfully managed projects. The 
best way to achieve this goal is with good project management methodologies that are 

742
Modern Developments in Project Management 
based upon guidelines and forms rather than policies and procedures. Methodologies must 
have enough flexibility that they can be adapted easily to each and every project.
Methodologies should be designed to support the corporate culture, not vice versa. 
It is a fatal mistake to purchase a canned methodology package that mandates that you 
change your corporate culture to support it. If the methodology does not support the cul-
ture, it will not be accepted. What converts any methodology into a world-class methodol-
ogy is its adaptability to the corporate culture. There is no reason why companies cannot 
develop their own methodology. Companies such as Hewlett-Packard, Johnson Controls, 
and Motorola are regarded as having world-class methodologies for project manage-
ment and, in each case, the methodology was developed internally. Developing your own 
methodology internally to guarantee a fit with the corporate culture usually provides a 
much greater return on investment than purchasing canned packages that require massive 
changes.
21.4 CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT
All too often complacency dictates the decision-making process. This is particularly 
true of organizations that have reached some degree of excellence in project manage-
ment, become complacent, and then realize too late that they have lost their competitive 
advantage. This occurs when organizations fail to recognize the importance of continuous 
improvement.
Figure 21–7 illustrates why there is a need for continuous improvement. As companies 
begin to mature in project management and reach some degree of excellence, they achieve 
a sustained competitive advantage. The sustained competitive advantage might very well 
be the single most important strategic objective of the firm. The firm will then begin the 
exploitation of its sustained competitive advantage.

Unfortunately, the competition is not sitting by idly watching you exploit your sus-
tained competitive advantage. As the competition begins to counterattack, you may lose a 
large portion, if not all, of your sustained competitive advantage. To remain effective and 
competitive, the organization must recognize the need for continuous improvement, as 
shown in Figure 21–8. Continuous improvement allows a firm to maintain its competitive 
advantage even when the competitors counterattack.
21.5 CAPACITY PLANNING
As companies become excellent in project management, the benefits of performing more 
work in less time and with fewer resources becomes readily apparent. The question, of 
course, is how much more work can the organization take on? Companies are now strug-
gling to develop capacity planning models to see how much new work can be undertaken 
within the existing human and nonhuman constraints.
Figure 21–9 illustrates the classical way that companies perform capacity planning. 
The approach outlined in this figure holds true for both project- and non–project-driven 
organizations. The “planning horizon” line indicates the point in time for capacity plan-
ning. The “proposals” line indicates the manpower needed for approved internal projects 
or a percentage (perhaps as much as 100 percent) for all work expected through competi-
tive bidding. The combination of this line and the “manpower requirements” line, when 
compared against the current staffing, provides us with an indication of capacity. This 
technique can be effective if performed early enough such that training time is allowed for 
future manpower shortages.
The limitation to this process for capacity planning is that only human resources are 
considered. A more realistic method would be to use the method shown in Figure 21–10, 
which can also be applied to both project-driven and non–project-driven organizations. 
From Figure 21–10, projects are selected based upon such factors as strategic fit, profit-
ability, who the customer is, and corporate benefits. The objectives for the projects selected

are then defined in both business and technical terms, because there can be both business 
and technical capacity constraints.
The next step is a critical difference between average companies and excellent com-
panies. Capacity constraints are identified from the summation of the schedules and plans. 
In excellent companies, project managers meet with sponsors to determine the objective of 
the plan, which is different than the objective of the project. Is the objective of the plan to 
achieve the project’s objective with the least cost, least time, or least risk? Typically, only 
one of these applies, whereas immature organizations believe that all three can be achieved 
on every project. This, of course, is unrealistic.
The final box in Figure 21–10 is now the determination of the capacity limitations. 
Previously, we considered only human resource capacity constraints. Now we realize that

the critical path of a project can be constrained not only by time but also by available man-
power, facilities, cash flow, and even existing technology. It is possible to have multiple 
critical paths on a project other than those identified by time. Each of these critical paths 
provides a different dimension to the capacity planning models, and each of these con-
straints can lead us to a different capacity limitation. As an example, manpower might limit 
us to taking on only four additional projects. Based upon available facilities, however, we 
might only be able to undertake two more projects, and based upon available technology, 
we might be able to undertake only one new project.
21.6 COMPETENCY MODELS
In the twenty-first century, companies are replacing job descriptions with competency 
models. Job descriptions for project management tend to emphasize the deliverables and 
expectations from the project manager, whereas competency models emphasize the spe-
cific skills needed to achieve the deliverables.
Figure 21–11 shows the competency model for Eli Lilly. Project managers are expected 
to have competencies in three broad areas1:
●
●
Scientific/technical skills
●
●
Leadership skills
●
●
Process skills
For each of the three broad areas, there are subdivisions or grade levels. A primary 
advantage of a competency model is that it allows the training department to develop cus-
tomized project management training programs to satisfy the skill requirements. Without 
competency models, most training programs are generic rather than customized.
1.  A detailed description of the Eli Lilly competency model and the Ericsson competency model can be found in 
Harold Kerzner, Applied Project Management (New York: John Wiley & Sons, 1999), pp. 266–283.

SKILLS

746
Modern Developments in Project Management 
Competency models focus on specialized skills in order to assist the project manager 
in making more efficient use of his or her time. Figure 21–12, although argumentative, 
shows that with specialized competency training, project managers can increase their time 
effectiveness by reducing time robbers and rework.
Competency models make it easier for companies to develop a complete project man-
agement curriculum, rather than a singular course. This is shown in Figure 21–13.
As companies mature in project management and develop a company-wide core com-
petency model, an internal, custom-designed curriculum will be developed. Companies, espe-
cially large ones, will find it necessary to maintain a course architecture specialist on their staff.

Managing Multiple Projects
747
21.7 MANAGING MULTIPLE PROJECTS
As organizations mature in project management, there is a tendency toward having one 
person manage multiple projects. The initial impetus may come either from the company 
sponsoring the projects or from project managers themselves. There are several factors 
supporting the managing of multiple projects. First, the cost of maintaining a full-time pro-
ject manager on all projects may be prohibitive. The magnitude and risks of each individual 
project dictate whether a full-time or part-time assignment is necessary. Assigning a project 
manager full-time on an activity that does not require it is an overmanagement cost. Over-
management of projects was considered an acceptable practice in the early days of project 
management because we had little knowledge on how to handle risk management. Today, 
methods for risk management exist.
Second, line managers are now sharing accountability with project managers for the suc-
cessful completion of the project. Project managers are now managing at the template levels 
of the WBS with the line managers accepting accountability for the work packages at the 
detailed WBS levels. Project managers now spend more of their time integrating work rather 
than planning and scheduling functional activities. With the line manager accepting more 
accountability, time may be available for the project manager to manage multiple projects.
Third, senior management has come to the realization that they must provide high-
quality training for their project managers if they are to reap the benefits of managing mul-
tiple projects. Senior managers must also change the way that they function as sponsors. 
There are six major areas where the corporation as a whole may have to change in order for 
the managing of multiple projects to succeed.
●
●
Prioritization: If a project prioritization system is in effect, it must be used cor-
rectly such that employee credibility in the system is realized. One risk is that the 
project manager, having multiple projects to manage, may favor those projects 
having the highest priorities. It is possible that no prioritization system may be the 
best solution. Not every project needs to be prioritized, and prioritization can be a 
time-consuming effort.
●
●
Scope Changes: Managing multiple projects is almost impossible if the sponsors/ 
customers are allowed to make continuous scope changes. When using multiple 
projects management, it must be understood that the majority of the scope changes 
may have to be performed through enhancement projects rather than through a 
continuous scope change effort. A major scope change on one project could limit 
the project manager’s available time to service other projects. Also, continuous 
scope changes will almost always be accompanied by reprioritization of projects, 
a further detriment to the management of multiple projects.
●
●
Capacity Planning: Organizations that support the management of multiple pro-
jects generally have a tight control on resource scheduling. As a result, the organi-
zation must have knowledge of capacity planning, theory of constraints, resource 
leveling, and resource limited planning.
●
●
Project Methodology: Methodologies for project management range from rigid poli-
cies and procedures to more informal guidelines and checklists. When managing 
multiple projects, the project manager must be granted some degree of freedom. 

748
Modern Developments in Project Management 
This necessitates guidelines, checklists, and forms. Formal project management 
practices create excessive paperwork requirements, thus minimizing the opportuni-
ties to manage multiple projects. The project size is also critical.
●
●
Project Initiation: Managing multiple projects has been going on for almost 40 
years. One thing that we have learned is that it can work well as long as the pro-
jects are in relatively different life-cycle phases because the demands on the pro-
ject manager’s time are different for each life-cycle phase.
●
●
Organizational Structures: If the project manager is to manage multiple projects, 
then it is highly unlikely that the project manager will be a technical expert in all 
areas of all projects. Assuming that the accountability is shared with the line man-
agers, the organization will most likely adopt a weak matrix structure.
21.8 THE BUSINESS OF SCOPE CHANGES
Very few projects are ever completed according to the original plan. 
The changes to the plan result from either increased knowledge, a 
need for competitiveness, or changing customer/consumer tastes. 
Once the changes are made, there is almost always an accompanying increase in the budget 
and/or elongation of the schedule.
The process for recommending and approving scope changes can vary based upon 
whether the client is internal or external to the organization. Scope changes for external 
clients have long been viewed as a source of added profitability on projects. Years ago, it 
was common practice on some Department of Defense contracts to underbid the original 
contract during competitive bidding to assure the award of the contract and then push 
through large quantities of lucrative scope changes.
External customers were rarely informed of gaps in their statements of work that could 
lead to scope charges. And even if the statement of work was clearly written, it was often 
intentionally misinterpreted for the benefit of seeking out scope changes whether or not the 
scope changes were actually needed. For some companies, scope changes were the prime 
source of corporate profitability. During competitive bidding, executives would ask the bid-
ding team two critical questions before submitting a bid: (1) What is our cost of doing the 
work we are committing to? and (2) How much additional work can we push through in 
scope changes once the contract is awarded to us? Often, the answer to the second question 
determined the magnitude of the bid.
To make matters even worse, in the early years of project management the Department 
of Defense requested that the contractors’ project managers have a command of technology 
rather than an understanding of technology. Engineers with advanced degrees were assigned 
as project managers, and their objective was often to exceed rather than merely meet specifi-
cations. This resulted in additional scope changes and often increased the risks in the project. 
Another problem that surfaced was the downstream effect of upstream scope changes 
on large projects involving multiple contractors. When contractors work sequentially, as 
PMBOK® Guide, 6th Edition
5.6 Control Scope
PMBOK is a registered mark of the Project Management Institute, Inc.

Using scope changes as a source of revenue has been an acceptable 
practice for projects funded by customers external to the organization. 
But for internal customers, there are numerous other reasons for scope changes, as shown 
in Figure 21–16. For projects that are internal, scope changes must be targeted, and this is 
the weakest link because it requires business knowledge as well as technical knowledge. As 
an example, scope changes should not be implemented at the expense of risking exposure 
to product liability lawsuits or safety issues. Likewise, costly scope changes exclusively for 
the sake of enhancing image or reputation should be avoided. Also, scope changes should 
not be implemented if the payback period for the product is drastically extended in order to 
recover the costs of the scope changes.
The Business of Scope Changes
749
shown in Figure 21–14, a scope change in an upstream contractor might not have a serious 
impact on downstream contractors. Contractor B usually needs the output from contrac-
tor A to begin work. If contractor A initiates a scope change, the impact on contractor B 
may be minimal. If there were an impact on contractor B, the customer would incur the 
added costs. But if the contractors are performing work partially or completely in parallel, 
as shown in Figure 21–15, the downstream effect can be devastating. A relatively simple 
decision by an upstream contractor to change over to higher-grade or lower-grade raw 
materials can cause major changes in the project plans and scope baselines of downstream 
contractors.

Modern Developments in Project Management 
It is understood that the further into the project’s life-cycle phases, the 
more costly the scope changes. As we progress through the life-cycle 
phases, more variables are introduced into the system such that the financial impact of a 
small scope change can be quite large because of the cost involved with reversing previous 
decisions. Scope changes in production are more costly than scope changes in technology 
development.
For the development of new products, it may take as many as sixty ideas to develop one 
successful new product. Each idea may undergo numerous scope changes before the idea is 
officially abandoned. Any scope changes made after capital expenditures are incurred can 
have a significant impact on total cost and schedule.
Another critical factor involving timing is whether the scope changes are radical scope 
changes. Radical scope changes require either a breakthrough in technology or the design 
of an entirely new platform. As an example, a competitor launches a new product that may 
cause the marketplace to view your product as being obsolete. In order to remain competi-
tive, you may need to consider radical scope changes to remain competitive or to outdo the 
competition. Radical scope changes focus more so on creativity than execution. Radical 
scope changes may require a breakthrough in technology accompanied by the consumption 
of vast resources.
Another timing issue is whether the scope change should be done incrementally or 
clustered together and approved as enhancement projects. Incremental scope changes are 
often referred to as scope creep. These incremental changes can be done quickly and at a 
relatively low cost. However, if there are a significant number of incremental scope changes, 
such as in the case of perpetual scope creep, the project’s schedule can be elongated.
Today, project managers are expected to make sound business decisions rather than 
merely project or technical decisions. But it wasn’t that long ago when companies were 
nonbelievers that project management could benefit the business as a whole. Companies 
are slowly coming to the realization that they are managing their business by projects. 
Project managers are now expected to make sound business decisions rather than merely 
project decisions, and this includes the decision on scope changes.

Timing of Scope Changes

There must be a valid business purpose for a scope change. This 
includes the following factors at a minimum:
●
●
An assessment of the customers’ needs and the added value that the scope change 
will provide
●
●
An assessment of the market needs including the time required to make the scope 
change, the payback period, return on investment, and whether the final product 
selling price will be overpriced for the market
●
●
An assessment on the impact on the length of the product life cycle
●
●
An assessment on the competition’s ability to imitate the scope change
●
●
Is there a product liability associated with the scope change and can it impact our 
image?
Scope changes can be for existing products or for new products. Support for existing 
products is usually a defensive scope change designed to penetrate new markets with exist-
ing products. Support for new products is usually an offensive scope change designed to 
provide new products/services to existing customers as well as seeking out new markets.
There are three things that most project managers know will happen 
with almost certainty: death, taxes, and scope creep. Scope creep is 
the continuous enhancement of the project’s requirements as the project’s deliverables are 
being developed. Scope creep is viewed as the growth in the project’s scope. The larger and 
more complex the project, the greater the chances of significant scope creep.
Although scope creep can occur in any project in any industry, it is most frequently 
associated with information systems development projects. Scope changes can occur dur-
ing any project life-cycle phase. Scope changes occur because it is the nature of humans not 
to be able to completely describe the project or the plan to execute the project at the start. 
This is particularly true on large, complex projects. As a result, we gain more knowledge as 
the project progresses, and this leads to creeping scope and scope changes.
Scope creep is a natural occurrence for project managers. We must accept the fact that 
this will happen. Some people believe that there are magical charms, potions, and rituals 
that can prevent scope creep. This is certainly not true. Perhaps the best we can do is to 
establish processes, such as configuration management systems, or change control boards 
to get some control over scope creep. However, these processes are designed not so much 
to prevent scope creep but rather to prevent unwanted scope changes from taking place.
Therefore, we can argue that scope creep is not just allowing the scope to change but 
an indication of how well we manage changes to the scope. If all of the parties agree that 
a scope change is needed, then perhaps we can argue that the scope simply changed rather 
than creeped. Some people view scope creep as a scope change not approved by the spon-
sor or the change control board.
Scope creep is often viewed as being detrimental to the success of a project because 
it increases the cost and elongates the schedule. While this is true, scope creep can also 
produce favorable results such as add-ons that give your product a competitive advantage. 
Scope creep can also please the customer if the scope changes are seen as additional value 
for the final deliverable.

Some scope change requests are the result of wishful thinking or 
the personal whims of management and not necessarily based upon 
sound business judgment. In such cases, the scope changes may need 
to be canceled. Typical rationalization for termination or not approving a scope change 
includes:
●
●
The cost of the scope change is excessive and the final cost of the deliverable may 
make us noncompetitive.
●
●
The return on investment may occur too late.
●
●
The competition is too stiff and not worth the risks.
●
●
There are insurmountable obstacles and technical complexity.
●
●
There are legal and regulatory uncertainties.
●
●
The scope change may violate the company’s policy on nondisclosure, secrecy, 
and confidentiality agreements.
21.9 END-OF-PHASE REVIEW MEETINGS
For more than 20 years, end-of-phase review meetings were simply an opportunity for 
executives to “rubber stamp” the project to continue. As only good news was presented 
the meetings were used to give the executives some degree of comfort concerning project 
status.
Today, end-of-phase review meetings take on a different dimension. First and fore-
most, executives are no longer afraid to cancel projects, especially if the objectives have 
changed, if the objectives are unreachable, or if the resources can be used on other activities 
that have a greater likelihood of success. Executives now spend more time assessing the 
risks in the future rather than focusing on accomplishments in the past.
Since project managers are now becoming more business-oriented rather than techni-
cally oriented, the project managers are expected to present information on business risks, 
reassessment of the benefit-to-cost ratio, and any business decisions that could affect the 
ultimate objectives. Simply stated, the end-of-phase review meetings now focus more on 
business decisions, rather than on technical decisions.

HONICKER CORPORATION
case studIES
Background
Honicker Corporation was well-recognized as a high-quality manufacturer 
of dashboards for automobiles and trucks. Although it serviced mainly U.S. 
automotive and truck manufacturers, the opportunity to expand to a worldwide supplier was 
quite apparent. Its reputation was well-known worldwide, but it was plagued for years with ultra­
conservative senior management leadership that prevented growth into the international marketplace.
When the new management team came on board in 2009, the conservatism disappeared. 
Honicker was cash rich, had large borrowing power and lines of credit with financial institutions, 
and received an AA-quality rating on its small amount of corporate debt. Rather than expand 
by building manufacturing facilities in various countries, Honicker decided to go the fast route 
by acquiring four companies around the world: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta Companies.
Each of the four acquired companies serviced mainly its own geographical areas. The sen-
ior management team in each of the four companies knew the culture in their geographic areas 
and had a good reputation with their clients and local stakeholders. The decision was made by 
Honicker to leave each company’s senior management teams intact provided that the necessary 
changes, as established by corporate, could be implemented.
Honicker wanted each company to have the manufacturing capability to supply parts to 
any Honicker client worldwide. But doing this was easier said than done. Honicker had an 
enterprise project management methodology (EPM) that worked well. Honicker understood 
project management and so did the majority of Honicker’s clients and stakeholders in the United 
States. Honicker recognized that the biggest challenge would be to get all of the divisions at the 
same level of project management maturity and using the same corporate-wide EPM system or 
a modified version of it. It was expected that each of the four acquired companies might want 
some changes to be made.
The four acquired divisions were all at different levels of project management maturity. 
Alpha did have an EPM system and believed that its approach to project management was 
superior to the one that Honicker was using. Beta Company was just beginning to learn project 
management but did not have any formal EPM system, although it did have a few project man-
agement templates that were being used for status reporting to its customers. Gamma and Delta 
Companies were clueless about project management.
To make matters worse, laws in each of the countries where the acquired companies were 
located created other stakeholders that had to be serviced, and all of these stakeholders were 
at different levels of project management maturity. In some countries government stakeholders 
were actively involved because of employment procurement laws, whereas in other countries 
government stakeholders were passive participants unless health, safety, or environmental laws 
were broken.
It would certainly be a formidable task developing an EPM system that would satisfy all of 
the newly acquired companies, their clients, and their stakeholders.
Establishing the Team
Honicker knew that there would be significant challenges in getting a pro-
ject management agreement in a short amount of time. Honicker also knew 
that there is never an acquisition of equals; there is always a “landlord” and “tenants,” and 
Honicker is the landlord. But acting as a landlord and exerting influence in the process could  

754
Modern Developments in Project Management 
alienate some of the acquired companies and do more harm than good. Honicker’s approach 
was to treat this as a project, and each company, along with its clients and local stakeholders, 
would be treated as project stakeholders. Using stakeholder relations management practices 
would be essential to getting an agreement on the project management approach.
Honicker requested that each company assign three people to the project management im-
plementation team that would be headed up by Honicker personnel. The ideal team member, as 
suggested by Honicker, would have some knowledge and/or experience in project management 
and be authorized by their senior levels of management to make decisions for their company. 
The representatives should also understand the stakeholder needs from their clients and local 
stakeholders. Honicker wanted an understanding to be reached as early as possible that each 
company would agree to use the methodology that was finally decided upon by the team.
Senior management in each of the four companies sent a letter of understanding to Hon-
icker promising to assign the most qualified personnel and agreeing to use the methodology 
that was agreed upon. Each stated that their company understood the importance of this project.
The first part of the project would be to come to an agreement on the methodology. The 
second part of the project would be to invite clients and stakeholders to see the methodology 
and provide feedback. This was essential since the clients and stakeholders would eventually be 
interfacing with the methodology.
Honicker had hoped that the team could come to an agreement on a com-
panywide EPM system within six months. But after the kickoff meeting 
was over, Honicker realized that it would probably be two years before an agreement would be 
reached on the EPM system. Several issues became apparent at the first meeting:
●
●
Each company had different time requirements for the project.
●
●
Each company saw the importance of the project differently.
●
●
Each company had its own culture and wanted to be sure that the final design was a good 
fit with that culture.
●
●
Each company saw the status and power of the project manager differently.
●
●
Despite the letters of understanding, two of the companies, Gamma and Delta, did not 
understand their role and relationship with Honicker on this project.
●
●
Alpha wanted to micromanage the project, believing that everyone should use its 
methodology.
Senior management at Honicker asked the Honicker representatives at the kickoff meeting 
to prepare a confidential memo on their opinion of the first meeting with the team. The Honicker 
personnel prepared a memo including the following comments:
●
●
Not all of the representatives at the meeting openly expressed their true feelings about the 
project.
●
●
It was quite apparent that some of the companies would like to see the project fail.
●
●
Some of the companies were afraid that the implementation of the new EPM system would 
result in a shift in power and authority.
●
●
Some people were afraid that the new EPM system would show that fewer resources 
were needed in the functional organization, thus causing a downsizing of personnel and 
a reduction in bonuses that were currently based upon headcount in functional groups.
●
●
Some seemed apprehensive that the implementation of the new system would cause a 
change in the company’s culture and working relationships with their clients.
●
●
Some seemed afraid of learning a new system and being pressured into using it.
Kickoff Meeting

It was obvious that this would be no easy task. Honicker had to get to know all companies 
better and understand their needs and expectations. Honicker management had to show them 
that their opinion was of value and find ways to win their support.
QUESTIONS
  1.	 What are Honicker’s options now?
  2.	 What would you recommend that Honicker do first?
  3.	 What if, after all attempts, Gamma and Delta companies refuse to come on board?
  4.	 What if Alpha Company is adamant that its approach is best and refuses to budge?
  5.	 What if Gamma and Delta Companies argue that their clients and stakeholders have not 
readily accepted the project management approach and they wish to be left alone with 
regard to dealing with their clients?
  6.	 Under what conditions would Honicker decide to back away and let each company do its 
own thing?
  7.	 How easy or difficult is it to get several companies geographically dispersed to agree to the 
same culture and methodology?
  8.	 If all four companies were willing to cooperate with one another, how long do you think it 
would take for an agreement on and acceptance to use the new EPM system?
  9.	 Which stakeholders may be powerful and which are not?
10.	 Which stakeholder(s) may have the power to kill this project?
11.	 What can Honicker do to win their support?
12.	 If Honicker cannot win their support, then how should Honicker manage the opposition?
13.	 What if all four companies agree to the project management methodology and then some of 
the client stakeholders show a lack of support for use of the methodology?

KEMKO MANUFACTURING
Background
Kemko Manufacturing was a fifty-year-old company that had a reputa-
tion for the manufacturing of high-quality household appliances. Kemko’s 
growth was rapid during the 1990s. The company grew by acquiring other companies. Kemko 
now had more than twenty-five manufacturing plants throughout the United States, Europe, 
and Asia. Originally, each manufacturing plant that was acquired wanted to maintain its own 
culture and quite often was allowed to remain autonomous from corporate at Kemko provided 
that work was progressing as planned. But as Kemko began acquiring more companies, growing 
pains made it almost impossible to allow each plant to remain autonomous. Each company had 
its own way of handling raw material procurement and inventory control. All purchase requests 
above a certain dollar value had to be approved by corporate. At corporate, there was often 
confusion over the information in all of the forms since each plant had its own documentation 
for procurement. Corporate was afraid that, unless it established a standardized procurement 
and inventory control system across all of the plants, cash flow problems and loss of corporate 
control over inventory could take its toll in the near future.
Project Is Initiated
Because of the importance of the project, senior management asked Janet 
Adams, director of information technology (IT), to take control of the 
project personally. Janet had more than thirty years of experience in IT and fully understood 
how scope creep can create havoc on a large project.

756
Modern Developments in Project Management 
Janet selected her team from IT and set up an initial kickoff date for the project. In addition 
to the mandatory presence of all of her team members, she also demanded that each manufac-
turing plant assign at least one representative and that all of the plant representatives must be in 
attendance as well at the kickoff meeting. At the kickoff meeting, Janet spoke:
I asked all of you here because I want you to have a clear understanding of how I intend 
to manage this project. Our executives have given us a timetable for this project and 
my greatest fear is “scope creep.” Scope creep is the growth of or enhancements to the 
project’s scope as the project is being developed. On many of our other projects, scope 
creep has elongated the project and driven up the cost. I know that scope creep isn’t 
always evil, and that it can happen in any life cycle phase.
The reason why I have asked all of the plant representatives to attend this meeting is 
because of the dangers of scope creep. Scope creep has many causes, but it is generally 
the failure of effective upfront planning. When scope creep exists, people generally 
argue that it is a natural occurrence and we must accept the fact that it will happen. 
That’s unacceptable to me!
There will be no scope changes on this project, and I really mean it when I say 
this. The plant representatives must meet on their own and provide us with a detailed 
requirements package. I will not allow the project to officially begin until we have a 
detailed listing of the requirements. My team will provide you with some guidance, as 
needed, in preparing the requirements.
No scope changes will be allowed once the project begins. I know that there may be 
some requests for scope changes, but all requests will be bundled together and worked 
upon later as an enhancement project. This project will be implemented according to the 
original set of requirements. If I were to allow scope changes to occur, this project would 
run forever. I know some of you do not like this, but this is the way it will be on this project.
There was dead silence in the room. Janet could tell from the expressions on the faces of 
the plant representatives that they were displeased with her comments. Some of the plants were 
under the impression that the IT group was supposed to prepare the requirements package. Now, 
Janet had transferred the responsibility to them, the user group, and they were not happy. Janet 
made it clear that user involvement would be essential for the preparation of the requirements.
After a few minutes of silence, the plant representatives said that they were willing to do 
this and it would be done correctly. Many of the representatives understood user requirements 
documentation. They would work together and come to an agreement on the requirements. Janet 
again stated that her team would support the plant representatives but that the burden of respon-
sibility would rest solely upon the plants. The plants would get what they asked for and nothing 
more. Therefore, they must be quite clear up front in their requirements.
While Janet was lecturing to the plant representatives, the IT portion of the team was just 
sitting back smiling. Their job was about to become easier, or at least they thought so. Janet then 
addressed the IT portion of the team:
Now I want to address the IT personnel. The reason why we are all in attendance at this 
meeting is because I want the plant representatives to hear what I have to say to the IT team. 
In the past, the IT teams have not been without some blame for scope creep and schedule 
elongation. So, here are my comments for the IT personnel:
●
●
It is the IT team’s responsibility to make sure that they understand the requirement as 
prepared by the plant representatives. Do not come back to me later telling me that you did 

not understand the requirements because they were poorly defined. I am going to ask every 
IT team member to sign a document stating that they have read over the requirement and 
fully understand them.
●
●
Perfectionism is not necessary. All I want you to do is to get the job done.
●
●
In the past we have been plagued with “featuritis,” where many of you have added in your 
own “bells and whistles” unnecessarily. If that happens on this project, I will personally 
view this as a failure by you and it will reflect in your next performance review.
●
●
Sometimes, people believe that a project like this will advance their career, especially if 
they look for perfection and bells and whistles. Trust me when I tell you this can have the 
opposite effect.
●
●
Back door politics will not be allowed. If any of the plant representatives come to you 
looking for ways to sneak in scope changes, I want to know about it. And if you make the 
changes without my permission, you may not be working for me much longer.
●
●
I, and only I, have signature authority for scope changes.
●
●
This project will be executed using detailed planning rather than rolling wave or progressive 
planning. We should be able to do this once we have clearly defined requirements.
Now, are there any questions from anyone?
The battle lines were now drawn. Some believed that it was Janet against the team, but 
most understood Janet’s need to do this. However, whether it could work this way was still 
questionable.
QUESTIONS
1.	 Was Janet correct in the comments she made to the plant representatives?
2.	 Was Janet correct in the comments she made to the IT team members?
3.	 Is it always better on IT projects to make changes using enhancement projects or should we 
allow changes to be made as we go along?
4.	 What is your best guess on what happened?

APPENDIX A
Solution to Leadership Exercise
Situation 1
A.	 This technique may work if you have proven leadership credentials. Since three of these 
people have not worked for you before, some action is necessary.
B.	 The team should already be somewhat motivated and reinforcement will help. Team build-
ing must begin by showing employees how they will benefit. This is usually the best ap-
proach on long-term projects. (5 points)
C.	 This is the best approach if the employees already understand the project. In this case, how-
ever, you may be expecting too much out of the employees this soon. (3 points)
D.	 This approach is too strong at this time, since emphasis should be on team building. On 
long-term projects, people should be given the opportunity to know one another first. 
(2 points)
Situation 2
A.	 Do nothing. Don’t overreact. This may improve productivity without damaging morale. See 
the impact on the team first. If the other members accept Tom as the informal leader, because 
he has worked for you previously, the results can be very favorable. (5 points)
B.	 This may cause the team to believe that a problem exists when, in fact, it does not.
C.	 This is duplication of effort and may reflect on your ability as a leader. Productivity may be 
impaired. (2 points)
D.	 This is a hasty decision and may cause Tom to overreact and become less productive. 
(3 points)

760
Solution to Leadership Exercise 
Situation 3
A.	 You may be burdening the team by allowing them to struggle. Motivation may be affected 
and frustration will result. (1 point)
B.	 Team members expect the project manager to be supportive and to have ideas. This will 
reinforce your relationship with the team. (5 points)
C.	 This approach is reasonable as long as your involvement is minimal. You must allow the 
team to evolve without expecting continuous guidance. (4 points)
D.	 This action is premature and can prevent future creativity. The team may allow you to do it all.
Situation 4
A.	 If, in fact, the problem does exist, action must be taken. These types of problems do not go 
away by themselves.
B.	 This will escalate the problem and may make it worse. It could demonstrate your support for 
good relations with your team, but could also backfire. (1 point)
C.	 Private meetings should allow you to reassess the situation and strengthen employee rela-
tions on a one-on-one basis. You should be able to assess the magnitude of the problem. 
(5 points)
D.	 This is a hasty decision. Changing the team’s schedules may worsen the morale problem. 
This situation requires replanning, not a strong hand. (2 points)
Situation 5
A.	 Crisis management does not work in project management. Why delay until a crisis occurs 
and then waste time having to replan?
B.	 This situation may require your immediate attention. Sympathizing with your team may not 
help if they are looking toward you for leadership. (2 points)
C.	 This is the proper balance: participative management and contingency planning. This bal-
ance is crucial for these situations. (5 points)
D.	 This may seriously escalate the problem unless you have evidence that performance is sub-
standard. (1 point)
Situation 6
A.	 Problems should be uncovered and brought to the surface for solution. It is true that this 
problem may go away, or that Bob simply does not recognize that his performance is sub-
standard.
B.	 Immediate feedback is best. Bob must know your assessment of his performance. This 
shows your interest in helping him improve. (5 points)

Situation 10
761
C.	 This is not a team problem. Why ask the team to do your work? Direct contact is best.
D.	 As above, this is your problem, not that of the team. You may wish to ask for their input, but 
do not ask them to perform your job.
Situation 7
A.	 George must be hurting to finish the other project. George probably needs a little more time 
to develop a quality report. Let him do it. (5 points)
B.	 Threatening George may not be the best situation because he already understands the prob-
lem. Motivation by threatening normally is not good. (3 points)
C.	 The other team members should not be burdened with this unless it is a team effort.
D.	 As above, this burden should not be placed on other team members unless, of course, they 
volunteer.
Situation 8
A.	 Doing nothing in time of crisis is the worst decision that can be made. This may frustrate the 
team to a point where everything that you have built up may be destroyed.
B.	 The problem is the schedule slippage, not morale. In this case, it is unlikely that they are 
related.
C.	 Group decision making can work but may be difficult under tight time constraints. Produc-
tivity may not be related to the schedule slippage. (3 points)
D.	 This is the time when the team looks to you for strong leadership. No matter how good the 
team is, they may not be able to solve all of the problems. (5 points)
Situation 9
A.	 A pat on the back will not hurt. People need to know when they are doing well.
B.	 Positive reinforcement is a good idea, but perhaps not through monetary rewards. (3 points)
C.	 You have given the team positive reinforcement and have returned authority/responsibility 
to them for phase III. (5 points)
D.	 Your team has demonstrated the ability to handle authority and responsibility except for this 
crisis. Dominant leadership is not necessary on a continuous basis.
Situation 10
A.	 The best approach. All is well. (5 points)
B.	 Why disturb a good working relationship and a healthy working environment? Your efforts 
may be counterproductive.

762
Solution to Leadership Exercise 
C.	 If the team members have done their job, they have already looked for contingencies. Why 
make them feel that you still want to be in control? However, if they have not reviewed the 
phase III schedule, this step may be necessary. (3 points)
D.	 Why disturb the team? You may convince them that something is wrong or about to 
happen.
Situation 11
A.	 You cannot assume a passive role when the customer identifies a problem. You must 
be prepared to help. The customer’s problems usually end up being your problems. 
(3 points)
B.	 The customer is not coming into your company to discuss productivity.
C.	 This places a tremendous burden on the team, especially since it is the first meeting. They 
need guidance.
D.	 Customer information exchange meetings are your responsibility and should not be del-
egated. You are the focal point of information. This requires strong leadership, especially 
during a crisis. (5 points)
Situation 12
A.	 A passive role by you may leave the team with the impression that there is no urgency.
B.	 Team members are motivated and have control of the project. They should be able to handle 
this by themselves. Positive reinforcement will help. (5 points)
C.	 This approach might work but could be counterproductive if employees feel that you ques-
tion their abilities. (4 points)
D.	 Do not exert strong leadership when the team has already shown its ability to make good 
group decisions.
Situation 13
A.	 This is the worst approach and may cause the loss of both the existing and follow-on 
work.
B.	 This may result in overconfidence and could be disastrous if a follow-on effort does not 
­occur.
C.	 This could be very demoralizing for the team, because members may view the existing pro-
gram as about to be canceled. (3 points)
D.	 This should be entirely the responsibility of the project manager. There are situations where 
information may have to be withheld, at least temporarily. (5 points)

Situation 17
763
Situation 14
A.	 This is an ideal way to destroy the project-functional interface.
B.	 This consumes a lot of time, since each team member may have a different opinion. 
(3 points)
C.	 This is the best approach, since the team may know the functional personnel better than you 
do. (5 points)
D.	 It is highly unlikely that you can accomplish this.
Situation 15
A.	 This is the easiest solution, but the most dangerous if it burdens the rest of the team with 
extra work. (3 points)
B.	 The decision should be yours, not your team’s. You are avoiding your responsibility.
C.	 Consulting with the team will gain support for your decision. It is highly likely that the team 
will want Carol to have this chance. (5 points)
D.	 This could cause a demoralizing environment on the project. If Carol becomes irritable, so 
could other team members.
Situation 16
A.	 This is the best choice. You are at the mercy of the line manager. He may ease up some if not 
disturbed. (5 points)
B.	 This is fruitless. They have obviously tried this already and were unsuccessful. Asking them 
to do it again could be frustrating. Remember, the brick wall has been there for two years 
already. (3 points)
C.	 This will probably be a wasted meeting. Brick walls are generally not permeable.
D.	 This will thicken the brick wall and may cause your team’s relationship with the line man-
ager to deteriorate. This should be used as a last resort only if status information cannot be 
found any other way. (2 points)
Situation 17
A.	 This is a poor assumption. Carol may not have talked to him or may simply have given him 
her side of the project.
B.	 The new man is still isolated from the other team members. You may be creating two project 
teams. (3 points)

764
Solution to Leadership Exercise 
C.	 This may make the new man feel uncomfortable and that the project is regimented through 
meetings. (2 points)
D.	 New members feel more comfortable one on one, rather than having a team gang up on 
them. Briefings should be made by the team, since project termination and phaseout will be 
a team effort. (5 points)
Situation 18
A.	 This demonstrates your lack of concern for the growth of your employees. This is a poor 
choice.
B.	 This is a personal decision between you and the employee. As long as his performance will 
not be affected, he should be allowed to attend. (5 points)
C.	 This is not necessarily a problem open for discussion. You may wish to informally seek the 
team’s opinion. (2 points)
D.	 This approach is reasonable but may cause other team members to feel that you are showing 
favoritism and simply want their consensus.
Situation 19
A.	 This is the best choice. Your employees are in total control. Do nothing. You must assume 
that the employees have already received feedback. (5 points)
B.	 The employees have probably been counseled already by your team and their own functional 
manager. Your efforts can only alienate them. (1 point)
C.	 Your team already has the situation under control. Asking them for contingency plans at this 
point may have a detrimental effect. They may have already developed contingency plans. 
(2 points)
D.	 A strong leadership role now may alienate your team.
Situation 20
A.	 A poor choice. You, the project manager, are totally accountable for all information provided 
to the customer.
B.	 Positive reinforcement may be beneficial, but does nothing to guarantee the quality of the 
report. Your people may get overcreative and provide superfluous information.
C.	 Soliciting their input has some merit, but the responsibility here is actually yours. (3 points)
D.	 Some degree of leadership is needed for all reports. Project teams tend to become diffused 
during report writing unless guided. (5 points)

APPENDIX B
Solutions to the Project Management  
Conflict Exercise
Part One: Facing the Conflict
After reading the answers that follow, record your score on line 1 of the worksheet on  
page 288.
A.	 Although many project managers and functional managers negotiate by “returning” favors, 
this custom is not highly recommended. The department manager might feel some degree 
of indebtedness at first, but will surely become defensive in follow-on projects in which you 
are involved, and might even get the idea that this will be the only way that he will be able 
to deal with you in the future. If this was your choice, allow one point on line 1.
B.	 Threats can only lead to disaster. This is a surefire way of ending a potentially good arrange-
ment before it starts. Allow no points if you selected this as your solution.
C.	 If you say nothing, then you accept full responsibility and accountability for the schedule 
delay and increased costs. You have done nothing to open communications with the depart-
ment manager. This could lead into additional conflicts on future projects. Enter two points 
on line 1 if this was your choice.
D.	 Requesting upper-level management to step in at this point can only complicate the situa-
tion. Executives prefer to step in only as a last resort. Upper-level management will prob-
ably ask to talk to the department manager first. Allow two points on line 1 if this was your 
choice.
E.	 Although he might become defensive upon receiving your memo, it will become difficult 
for him to avoid your request for help. The question, of course, is when he will give you this 
help. Allow eight points on line 1 if you made this choice.
F.	 Trying to force your solution on the department manager will severely threaten him and 
provide the basis for additional conflict. Good project managers will always try to predict 
emotional reactions to whatever decisions they might be forced to make. For this choice, 
allow two points on line 1 of the worksheet.

Solutions to the Project Management Conflict Exercise  
G.	 Making an appointment for a later point in time will give both parties a chance to cool off 
and think out the situation further. He will probably find it difficult to refuse your request for 
help and will be forced to think about it between now and the appointment. Allow ten points 
for this choice.
H.	 An immediate discussion will tend to open communications or keep communication open. 
This will be advantageous. However, it can also be a disadvantage if emotions are running 
high and sufficient time has not been given to the selection of alternatives. Allow six points 
on line 1 if this was your choice.
I.	 Forcing the solution your way will obviously alienate the department manager. The fact that 
you do intend to honor his request at a later time might give him some relief especially if 
he understands your problem and the potential impact of his decision on other departments. 
Allow three points on line 1 for this choice.
Part Two: Understanding Emotions
Using the scoring table shown on page 767, determine your total score. Record your total 
in the appropriate box on line 2 of the worksheet on page 288. There are no “absolutely” 
correct answers to this problem, merely what appears to be the “most” right.
Part Three: Establishing Communications
A.	 Although your explanations may be acceptable and accountability for excess costs may be 
blamed on the department manager, you have not made any attempt to open communica-
tions with the department manager. Further conflicts appear inevitable. If this was your 
choice, allow a score of zero on line 3 of the worksheet.
B.	 You are offering the department manager no choice but to elevate the conflict. He probably 
has not had any time to think about changing his requirements and it is extremely doubtful 
that he will give in to you since you have now backed him into a corner. Allow zero points 
on line 3 of the worksheet.
C.	 Threatening him may get him to change his mind, but will certainly create deteriorating 
working relationships both on this project and any others that will require that you interface 
with his department. Allow zero points if this was your choice.
D.	 Sending him a memo requesting a meeting at a later date will give him and you a chance to 
cool down but might not improve your bargaining position. The department manager might 
now have plenty of time to reassure himself that he was right because you probably aren’t 
under such a terrible time constraint as you led him to believe if you can wait several days 
to see him again. Allow four points on line 3 of the worksheet if this was your choice.
E.	 You’re heading in the right direction trying to open communications. Unfortunately, you 
may further aggravate him by telling him that he lost his cool and should have apologized 
to you when all along you may have been the one who lost your cool. Expressing regret as 
part of your opening remarks would benefit the situation. Allow six points on line 3 of the 
worksheet.

Part Five: Understanding Your Choices
767 	
F.	 Postponing the problem cannot help you. The department manager might consider the prob-
lem resolved because he hasn’t heard from you. The confrontation should not be postponed. 
Your choice has merit in that you are attempting to open up a channel for communications. 
Allow four points on line 3 if this was your choice.
G.	 Expressing regret and seeking immediate resolution is the best approach. Hopefully, the 
department manager will now understand the importance of this conflict and the need for 
urgency. Allow ten points on line 3 of the worksheet.

B.	 Accepting the new requirements would be an easy way out if you are willing to explain the 
increased costs and schedule delays to the other participants. This would certainly please 
the department manager, and might even give him the impression that he has a power posi-
tion and can always resolve problems in this fashion. Allow four points on line 5 of your

D.	 Asking other managers to plead your case for you is not a good situation. Hopefully upper-
level management will solicit their opinions when deciding on how to resolve the conflict. 
Enter six points on line 5 if this was your choice, and hope that the functional managers do 
not threaten him by ganging up on him.
Part Six: Interpersonal Influences
A.	 Threatening the employees with penalty power will probably have no effect at all because 
your conflict is with the department manager, who at this time probably could care less 
about your evaluation of his people. Allow zero points on line 6 of the worksheet if you 
selected this choice.
B.	 Offering rewards will probably induce people toward your way of thinking provided that 
they feel that you can keep your promises. Promotions and increased responsibilities are 
functional responsibilities, not those of a project manager. Performance evaluation might be 
effective if the department manager values your judgment. In this situation it is doubtful that 
he will. Allow no points for this answer and record the results on line 6 of the worksheet.
C.	 Expert power, once established, is an effective means of obtaining functional respect provid-
ed that it is used for a relatively short period of time. For long-term efforts, expert power can 
easily create conflicts between project and functional managers. In this situation, although 
relatively short term, the department manager probably will not consider you as an expert, 
and this might carry on down to his functional subordinates. Allow six points on line 6 of the 
worksheet if this was your choice.

Part Six: Interpersonal Influences
769 	
D.	 Work challenge is the best means of obtaining support and in many situations can over-
come personality clashes and disagreements. Unfortunately, the problem occurred because 
of complaints by the functional personnel and it is therefore unlikely that work challenge 
would be effective here. Allow eight points on line 6 of the worksheet if this was your 
choice.
E.	 People who work in a project environment should respect the project manager because of 
the authority delegated to him from the upper levels of management. But this does not mean 
that they will follow his directions. When in doubt, employees tend to follow the direction 
of the person who signs their evaluation form, namely, the department manager. However, 
the project manager has the formal authority to “force” the line manager to adhere to the 
original project plan. This should be done only as a last resort, and here, it looks as though 
it may be the only alternative. Allow ten points if this was your answer and record the result 
on line 6 of the worksheet.
F.	 Referent power cannot be achieved overnight. Furthermore, if the department manager feels 
that you are trying to compete with him for the friendship of his subordinates, additional 
conflicts can result. Allow two points on line 6 of the worksheet if this was your choice.

DEFINING A PROJECT
Background
Dorale Products was undergoing favorable growing pains. Business was good. New prod-
uct development was viewed as the driving force for the company’s future growth. The 
company was now spending significantly more money for new product development, 
yet the number of new products reaching the market place was significantly less than in 
prior years. Also, some of the products reaching the marketplace were taking longer than 
expected to recover their R&D costs, while others became obsolete too quickly.
Management recognized that some sort of structured decision-making process had to 
be put in place whereby management could either cancel a project early before massive 
resources were committed or redirect efforts to different objectives. David Mathews was 
assigned as the project manager in charge of developing a new product development (pro-
ject management) methodology for Dorale Products. 
David understood the benefits of a project management methodology, especially as 
a structured decision-making process. It would serve as a template or a repetitive process 
such that project success could be incurred over and over again. The methodology would 
contain sections for project scope definition, planning, scheduling, and monitoring and 
control. There would also be a section on the role of the project manager, line managers, 
and executive sponsors.
To make the project management methodology easy to use and adaptable to all projects, 
the methodology would be constructed using forms, guidelines, templates, and checklists

rather than the more rigid policies and procedures. This would certainly lower the cost of 
using the methodology and make it easier to adapt to a multitude of projects. The project 
managers could then decide whether to implement the methodology on an informal basis 
or on a more formal basis.
The first draft of the new methodology was completed and ready for review by the 
vice president (VP) of operations, who had been assigned as the project sponsor. After a 
review of the methodology, a meeting was held between the sponsor and the project man-
ager (PM).
The Meeting
VP:	
“I have read over the methodology. Is it your expectation that the methodology 
should be used on every project?”
PM:	
“We could probably justify using the methodology on every project. This would 
give us a really good structured decision-making process.”
VP:	
“Using the methodology is costly and perhaps not all projects should require the 
use of the methodology. I can rationalize the use of the methodology on a $500,000 
project. But what if the project is only $25,000 or $50,000? What if the project is 
30 days in length rather than our usual 6- to 12-month effort?”
PM:	
“I guess we need to define the threshold limits on when project management 
should be used.”
VP:	
“I have a concern that we should define not only when to use project management 
but also what a project is. If an activity remains entirely in one functional area, is 
it still a project according to your definition? Should we also define a threshold 
limit on how many functional departments must be involved before we define an 
activity as a project?”
PM:	
“I’ll go back to the drawing board and get back to you in a week or so.”
Questions
1.	 What is a reasonable definition of a project?
2.	 Is every activity a project or should there be a minimum number of functional boundaries 
that need to be crossed? If so, how many boundaries?
3.	 How do we determine when project management should be used and when an activity can 
be handled effectively by one functional group without the use of project management?
4.	 Do all projects need project management?
5.	 Since the use of a formal project management methodology requires time and money, what 
should be “reasonable” threshold limits for its use?

product development, the vice president of operations believed that other applications for 
the methodology would be possible. A meeting was held between the project manager 
responsible for the development of the methodology and the vice president of operations.
The Meeting
VP:	
“The company has invested significant time and money in the development of this 
methodology. It would be a shame if the methodology could not be applied else-
where in the organization. As an example, there has to be commonality between 
new product development and information systems projects. Can we use this 
methodology, or part of it, for both new product development and information 
systems development?”
PM:	
“I’m not sure we can do that. The requirements for information systems projects 
are different, as are the life-cycle phases. A common project management method-
ology would have to be highly generic to be applicable to all types of projects.”
VP:	
“Are you telling me that we will need to invest more time and more money to 
develop a family of methodologies?”
PM:	
“The methodology we’ve developed can be applied to all of our activities except 
information technology efforts. All of our projects are similar, or in the same 
domain group, except for IT. The IT people may require their own methodology, 
and I can understand their rationale for wanting it this way.”
VP:	
“I assume from your comments that our existing methodology applies equally as 
well to programs as it does to projects. After all, isn’t a program just a continuation 
of a project?”
PM:	
“I did not consider applying our methodology to programs as well as projects. Let 
me think about this, and I will get back to you.”
Questions
1.	 Does it seem practical to have both a project management methodology and a systems de-
velopment methodology in use concurrently?
2.	 What is the definition of a program? How does it differ from the definition of a project?
3.	 Does the project management methodology apply equally well to programs as it does to

VP:	
“Have we restricted ourselves on what type of projects we can use our 
methodology?”
PM:	
“The answer is both yes and no! Every activity in the company, regardless of the 
functional area, can be regarded as a project. But not all projects require the use of 
the methodology or even project management.”
VP:	
“When we had these conversations months ago at the onset of this development 
process, you convinced me that we were managing our business by projects. Are 
you now changing your mind?”
PM:	
“Not at all. The main skill requirement for our project managers is integration 
management. The greater the integration requirements, the greater the need for 
project management.”
VP:	
“Now I’m really confused. First you tell me that all projects need project manage-
ment, and now you say that not all projects need the use of a methodology. What 
am I missing here?”

PROJECT MANAGEMENT 
PROCESSES
Background
Dorale Products developed a methodology for the management of projects. A vice presi-
dent was assigned as the project sponsor to oversee the development of the project man-
agement methodology. It was now time for the sponsor to introduce the methodology to 
the executive levels of management. The vice president met with his project manager to 
prepare the handouts for the executive committee briefing.
The Meeting
VP:	
“I have looked over the methodology and am concerned that I cannot easily recog-
nize the structure to the methodology. If I cannot identify the structure, then how 
can I effectively make a presentation to other executives?”
PM:	
“Good methodologies should be based upon guidelines, forms, and checklists, 
rather than policies and procedures. We must have this flexibility to adapt the 
methodology to a multitude of projects.”

VP:	
“I agree with you. But there must still be some overall structure to the project 
management process.”
PM:	
“Integration management involves three process areas, namely, the integration of 
the development of the plan, the integration of the execution of the plan, and the 
integration of changes to the plan. Our methodology is broken down into life-
cycle phases, and these three integrative processes are included in each life-cycle 
phase, though not specifically addressed. I have tried to use the principles of the 
PMBOK® Guide.”
VP:	
“Let me look at the methodology again and see if I can relate it to what you’ve 
said.”
Questions
1.	 Is the project manager correct in his definition of the integration management process areas?
2.	 Can it be difficult to identify these process areas in each life-cycle phase? If so, then what 
can we do to make them more visible?
3.	 What should the vice president say in his presentation about the structure of the methodology?

LIFE-CYCLE PHASES
Background
The vice president made his presentation to the other senior officers concerning the meth-
odology. Emphasis was placed upon the ten life-cycle phases. The other executives had 
several questions concerning the use of ten life-cycle phases. The vice president returned 
to the project manager for another meeting.
The Meeting
VP:	
“The other executives have concerns that 10 life-cycle phases are too many. You 
have ten end-of-phase gate reviews which require that most of our executives 
attend. That seems excessive.”
PM:	
“I agree. The more I think about it, the more I believe that ten are too many. I’ll be 
spending most of my time planning for gate review meetings, rather than manag-
ing the project.”
VP:	
“Another concern of our executives was their role or responsibility at the gate 
review meetings. The methodology is unclear in this regard.”
PM:	
“Once again, I must agree with you. We should have an established criterion for 
what constitutes passing the gate reviews.”
Questions
1.	 What are the primary benefits for using life-cycle phases? Are there disadvantages as well?”

Background	
When the executive committee made the final review of the project management methodol-

recommendation was to establish some type of criteria that would identify project success.
The Meeting	 VP:	
“We have a problem with the identification of success on a project. We need more 
clarification.”
PM:	
“I assumed that meeting the deliverables specified by the customer constituted  
success.”
VP:	
“What if we meet only 92 percent of the specification? Is that a success or a fail-
ure? What if we overrun our new product development process but bring in more 
new customers? What if the project basically fails but we develop a good customer 
relationship during that process?”
PM:	
“I understand what you are saying. Perhaps we should identify both primary and 
secondary contributions to success.”
Questions	
1.	 What is the standard definition of success (i.e., primary factors)? How does this relate to 
the triple constraint?
2.	 What would be examples of secondary success factors?
3.	 What would be a reasonable definition of project failure?
4.	 Should these definitions and factors be included in a project management methodology?

ROLE OF THE EXECUTIVE
Background	
Although senior management seemed somewhat pleased with the new methodology, there 
was some concern that the role of senior management was ill-defined. The vice president 

felt that this needed to be addressed quickly so that other executives would understand that 
they have a vital role in the project management process.
The Meeting	 VP:	
“Many of our executives are not knowledgeable in project management and 
need some guidance on how to function as a project sponsor. Without this role 
clarification, some sponsors might be ’invisible’ while others may tend to be too 
actively involved. We need a balance.”
PM:	
“I understand your concerns and agree that some role description is needed. How-
ever, I don’t see how the role description will prevent someone from becoming 
invisible or overbearing.”
VP:	
“That’s true, but we still need a starting point. We may need to teach them how to 
function as a sponsor.”
PM:	
“If the sponsor can change based upon which life-cycle phase we are in, then we 
should delineate the role of the sponsor per phase.”
VP:	
“That is a good point. Let’s also make sure we define the role of the sponsor at the 
gate review meetings.”
Questions	
1.	 What should be the primary role for the sponsor?
2.	 Will the role change based upon life-cycle phases?
3.	 Is it advisable for the sponsor to change based upon the life-cycle phase?
4.	 Will role delineation in the methodology force the sponsor to perform as expected?

ROLE OF LINE MANAGERS
Background	
The project management methodology was finally beginning to take shape. However, even 
though the basic structure of the methodology was in place, there were still gaps that had 
to be filled in. One of these gaps was a well-defined role for the line managers.
The Meeting	 VP:	
“From what I’ve read about project management, it is very difficult at first to get 
line managers to effectively support projects. I want our line managers to become 
fully committed to project management as quickly as possible.”
PM:	
“I agree with you! It’s not good for a line manager to assign people to a project and 
then take no interest in the project at all.”
VP:	
“I believe the line managers have the power to make or break a project. Simply 
stated, we need them to share in the accountability after they assign resources.”
Dorale Products (H)

PM:	
“I’m not exactly sure how to do that. There is no way that I as a project manager 
can force a line manager to share accountability with me for the project’s success 
or failure.”
VP:	
“I know this will be difficult at first, but I believe it can be done. The methodology 
should define the expectations that the executives have on the role of the line man-
agers in each life-cycle phase as well as the working relationships in each phase. 
See if you can get some of our line managers to help you in this regard.”
PM:	
“On most of our projects, the technical direction to the employees is still provided 
by the line managers, even after the employee is assigned. Most of our project 
managers have an understanding of technology, not a command of technology. 
However, we do have some projects where the technical know-how resides with 
the project manager, who must then provide daily technical supervision. How do I 
cover both bases in the design of the methodology?”
VP:	
“It seems to me that in one situation the project manager would be negotiating 
with the line manager for deliverables, and in the second situation the negotiation 
would be for specific people. I’m sure you’ll find a way to incorporate this into the 
methodology.”
Questions	
1.	 Should a methodology also include staffing policies? If so, what would be an example of a 
staffing policy?
2.	 When should a project manager negotiate for people, and when should the project manager 
negotiate for deliverables?
3.	 Should a staffing policy also distinguish between full-time and part-time assignments?
4.	 How should a company handle a situation where the line managers refuse to support project 
management, even though it is defined as part of the methodology?
5.	 Should staffing policies and the role of line management be defined in terms of policies and 
procedures or simply guidelines?

INTERPERSONAL SKILLS FOR PROJECT 
MANAGERS
Background	
With the role of the line manager and senior manager somewhat defined, Dorale believed 
that only individuals with specialized, interpersonal skills would become the best project 
managers. The company contemplated the preparation of a list of “universal” skills neces-
sary to function as a project manager.
The Meeting	 VP:	
“I would like to see a list of desired personal characteristics for project managers 
included in our methodology. Surely this can be done.”

PM:	
“I think we can define knowledge areas more easily than interpersonal skills. It is 
easier for us to decide whether or not the project manager needs a command of 
technology or understanding of technology by looking at the requirements of the 
project. But interpersonal skills are more complicated.”
VP:	
“I don’t understand why. Please explain!”
PM:	
“We appoint project managers to manage deliverables, not people. Our line man-
agers are providing significantly more daily direction to the assigned workers than 
do our project managers.”
VP:	
“Are you telling me that project managers do not require any management skills or 
interpersonal skills while managing a project?”
PM:	
“That’s not really what I’m saying. I just believe that the skills needed to be a pro-
ject manager are probably significantly different than the skills needed to be a line 
manager.”
VP:	
“I agree! See what kind of list you can develop.”
Questions	
1.	 What types of interpersonal skills are needed to be an effective project manager?
2.	 How do the interpersonal skills of a project manager differ from the skills needed to be an 
effective line manager?
3.	 Is your answer to the first two questions dependent upon the fact that in project management 
multiple-boss reporting is required?
4.	 Should the list that you have created be dependent upon whether or not the project manager 
has wage and salary responsibility (or input) for the team members?
5.	 Why is it often difficult for experienced line managers to become full-time project manag-
ers? (Or, in some cases, even part-time project managers?)
6.	 Some project managers have a command of technology while others have an understanding 
of technology. Can this command or understanding of technology influence the interper-
sonal skills needed to be a project manager?
7.	 Can the interpersonal skills requirements change if the project manager focuses on delivera-
bles rather than people?
8.	 Can someone with very strong technical skills also have undesirable project management 
interpersonal skills?

Dorale Products Case Studies 
The Meeting	 VP:	
“We need some sort of direction in our methodology for the staffing of projects. If 
we do not have policies and procedures in this regard, then there is no guarantee 
that the project manager will receive adequate and timely resources.”
PM:	
“I’m not sure I know how to do this. Right now, we are advocating that our project 
managers negotiate with the line managers for deliverables, rather than for people. 
It is then the responsibility of the line manager to provide adequate resources to 
get the job done.”
VP:	
“I agree with you, but we still need direction. Project managers must make it 
clear what the job specifically requires so that the line manager provides the right 
resources. I do not want to get into a conflict situation where the project manager 
blames the line manager for not providing the right resources and the line manager 
blames the project manager for improperly defining the scope.”
PM:	
“That seems more like accepting accountability than staffing.”
VP:	
“Perhaps so, but it is related to staffing. I want the line managers to provide the 
projects with personnel with the qualification levels necessary to meet the budg-
etary limits. We cannot afford to have projects that are loaded with the highest-
salaried workers.”
PM:	
“That’s a good idea. It might also be advisable to have some policy that mandates 
that the project managers release the assigned workers at their earliest convenience 
so that they can be picked up on other projects.”
Questions	
1.	 Is it appropriate for a project management methodology to contain policies and proce-
dures on project staffing?
2.	 Should staffing policies and procedures be directed to project managers, line managers, or both?
3.	 Should project sponsors be involved in decisions affecting project staffing? If so, what spe-
cifically is their involvement and for the staffing of which positions?
4.	 How do you develop a policy that “forces” a project manager to release people to other pro-
jects, assuming they are no longer required on the existing project?
5.	 Is project staffing an “accountability” decision?
6.	 Is it the responsibility of the project manager or line manager to adequately define the skill 
level required to complete a task?
7.	 Should staffing policies be applied to full-time personnel, part-time personnel, or both?

THE PROJECT/PROGRAM OFFICE
Background	
The methodology developed by Dorale focused on relatively small projects with time dura-
tions of less than 18 months. Could the same methodology be used on large projects?

The Meeting	 VP:	
“Most of our projects have manpower requirements of 10–20 people with time 
durations of eighteen months or less. Last week, at the executive committee meet-
ing, we approved several large projects that may run for three years or more and 
require more than forty people full time. How will we manage these projects?”
PM:	
“I assume you are talking about projects that will be managed by a project office 
rather than simply by a project manager.”
VP:	
“On large projects, the project manager is more of a project office manager than 
a project manager. Shouldn’t our methodology also discuss the role of a project 
office and a project office manager?”
Questions	
1.	 What criteria should exist in deciding when to use a project office as opposed to just a 
project manager?
2.	 Are the integration management responsibilities of a project office manager different than 
those of a project manager?
3.	 What is a project office?
4.	 What is the role of a project office manager?
5.	 Can the members of a project office be part-time or must they be full-time?
6.	 If employees are assigned full-time to a project office, can they still report administratively 
to their line managers?
7.	 Can the assigned project office employees be full-time and yet the project manager be 
­part-time?
8.	 Can project staffing policies be defined for a project office or is it more project-specific?

APPENDIX D
Solutions to the Dorale Products Case Studies
CASE STUDY (A)
1.	 A project is a unique activity, with a well-defined objective with constraints, that consumes 
resources, and is generally multifunctional. The project usually provides a unique product 
service or deliverable.
2.	 Generally, there is no minimum number of boundaries that need to be crossed.
3.	 Usually this is based upon the amount of integration required. The greater the amount of 
integration, the greater the need for project management.
4.	 All projects could benefit from the use of project management, but on some very small pro-
jects, project management may not be necessary.
5.	 Reasonable thresholds for the use of the project management methodology are based upon 
dollar value, risk, duration, and number of functional boundaries crossed.
CASE STUDY (B)
1.	 In many companies, one enterprise project methodology may be impractical. There may be 
one methodology for developing a unique product or service, and another one for systems 
development.
2.	 A program is usually longer in duration than a project and is comprised of several projects.
3.	 Project management methodologies apply equally to both programs and projects.

784
Solutions to the Dorale Products Case Studies 
CASE STUDY (C)
1.	 All projects should use the principles of project management but may not need to use the 
project management methodology.
2.	 Projects that do not require the methodology are those that are of short duration, low dollar 
value and stay within one functional department.
3.	 Methodologies are generally required for all projects that necessitate large-scale integra-
tion. However, if the cost associated with the use of the methodology is low, or the meth-
odology is not complex, then it could be argued that the methodology should be used on all 
projects.
4.	 This is a valid argument that the principles of project management should be applied to all 
projects, irrespective of constraints.
CASE STUDY (D)
1.	 The project manager is partially correct in his definition of the integration management 
process. The project manager’s definition is aligned more so with the 2000 PMBOK® Guide 
rather than the 2004 version.
2.	 It can be difficult to identify these processes in each life-cycle phase. However, a good pro-
ject management methodology will solve this problem.
3.	 A good project management methodology is based upon forms, guidelines, templates, and 
checklists, and is applicable to a multitude of projects. The more structure that is added into 
the methodology, the more control one has, but this may lead to the detrimental result of lim-
iting the flexibility that project teams need to have for one methodology that can be adapted 
to a multitude of projects.
CASE STUDY (E)
1.	 The primary benefits are standardization and control of the process. The disadvantage oc-
curs when this is done with policies and procedures rather than forms, guidelines, templates, 
and checklists.
2.	 Most good methodologies have no more than five or six life-cycle phases.
3.	 With too many gate review meetings, the project manager spends most of his/her time man-
aging the gate review meetings rather than managing the project.
4.	 The stakeholders that are in attendance at the gate review meetings determine what informa-
tion should be presented. Templates and checklists can be established for the gate review 
meetings as well as the stages.
5.	 At a minimum, the questions addressed should include: Where are we today? Where will we 
end up? What special problems exist?

CASE STUDY (F)
1.	 The standard definition of success is within time, cost, scope, or quality, and accepted by the 
customer.
2.	 Secondary success factors might include profitability and follow-on work.
3.	 It is more difficult to define failure as opposed to success. People believe that failure is an 
unsatisfied customer. Others believe that failure is a project that, when completed, provided 
no value or learning.
4.	 Absolutely, but they can be modified to fit a particular project or the needs of a particular 
sponsor.
5.	 Lack of flexibility may be the result.
CASE STUDY (G)
1.	 The primary role of the sponsor is to help the PM resolve problems that may be beyond the 
control of the PM.
2.	 The role of the sponsor can and will change based upon the life-cycle phase.
3.	 There are two schools of thought. Some believe that the same person should remain as spon-
sor for the duration of the project, while others believe that the sponsor can change based 
upon the life-cycle phase. There are advantages and disadvantages of both approaches, and 
it is often based upon the type of project and the importance of the customer.
4.	 Not necessarily, but it is a good starting point in explaining to new sponsors their role and 
responsibility.
5.	 Verify that the current phase has been completed correctly and authorize initiation of the 
next phase.
CASE STUDY (H)
1.	 Good methodologies identify staffing policies. As an example, a project manager may 
have the right to identify the skill level desired by the workers, but this may be open for 
­negotiations.
2.	 Project managers that possess a command of technology normally negotiate for people, 
whereas project managers without a command of technology negotiate for deliverables.
3.	 This question is argumentative because it may involve an argument over effort versus dura-
tion. The line manager may carry more weight in this regard than the project manager since 
this may very well be based upon the availability of personnel.
4.	 This is why project sponsors exist; to act as a referee when there are disagreements and to 
make sure that line management support exists.
5.	 Guidelines are always better than policies and procedures, at least in the eyes of the author.

Solutions to the Dorale Products Case Studies 
CASE STUDY (I)
1.	 Core skills include decision making, communications, conflict resolution, negotiations, 
mentorship, facilitation, and leadership without having authority.
2.	 Line management skills often focus on superior-subordinate relationships, whereas PM 
skills focus on team building where the people on the team are not necessarily under the 
control of the PM (and may actually be superior in rank to the PM).
3.	 Multiple-boss report is also a concern because the control and supervision of the worker 
may be spread across several individuals.
4.	 Wage and salary administration is an important factor. If the PM has this responsibility, the 
workers will adapt to the PM because he/she has an influence over their performance review 
and salary. Without this responsibility, the PM may be forced to adapt to the workers rather 
than vice versa.
5.	 Line managers are accustomed to managing with authority whereas project managers are 
not.
6.	 When a PM has a command of technology, he/she may align closer with the skills of a line 
manager rather than a PM.
7.	 PMs usually negotiate for deliverables when they do not have a command of technology and 
this can influence the interpersonal skills needed for a particular project.
8.	 Yes.
9.	 The identification should be in general terms only so that it may be applicable to a multitude 
of projects.
CASE STUDY (J)
1.	 Yes, but in general terms only.
2.	 Both, in order to minimize conflicts.
3.	 Sponsors usually take an active role in selection of the PM, but take a passive role in func-
tional staffing so as not to usurp the authority of their line managers.
4.	 There is no really effective way to do this other than by closing out some of the functional 
charge numbers.
5.	 Yes, if mandated by senior management.
6.	 The PM can request any skill level desired, but the final decision almost always rests with 
the line manager.
7.	 Both.
CASE STUDY (K)
1.	 The size of the project, duration, risk, and importance of the customer.
2.	 They are the same and may even be more detailed.

Case Study (K)
787
3.	 A project management team.
4.	 The role of the PM is to coordinate and integrate the activities of the project management 
team.
5.	 They can be part-time or full-time based upon the needs of the project.
6.	 Yes. An example of this may be the quality specialist assigned to the project.
7.	 Yes.
8.	 Policies can be established to staffing of a project office team, but it may be company spe-
cific or client specific.

There are several ways that one can study for the PMP® Examination. The author rec-
ommends the following approach:
1.	 Read over a specific area of knowledge chapter in the PMBOK® Guide.
2.	 Then, read over the chapter(s) in this text that correspond to that area of knowledge
3.	 Then re-read the area of knowledge in the PMBOK® Guide for a second time. Usually 
things fall into place better after the second reading of the PMBOK® Guide.
4.	 Now it is time to measure what you have learned. Answer the multiple choice ques-
tions at the end of the chapter(s) where the area of knowledge information was found. 
Collect whatever practice questions you can find, such as with the workbook that can 
accompany this text. The more question you answer, the more prepared you will be to 
pass the exam.
Some of the sources mentioned previously for practice questions can dramatically help 
the learning process. For example, the software provided by the International Institute for 
Learning allows the user to:
●
●
Test on all questions in an area of knowledge
●
●
Test on all questions with a domain area, such as project initiation
●
●
Test on all questions related to a specific PMBOK® Guide section such as 
Section 3.2.
PMP is a registered mark of the Project Management Institute.
