Dedication
To my wife, Jan. Thanks for your never-ending encouragement and 
support. Without you, this book would have never been possible. Also, 
thanks to all the student entrepreneurs who contributed to the chap-
ter opening features in the book. Your stories are both insightful and 
inspiring.
—Bruce R. Barringer
To my family: I am so proud of each of you and so blessed by your per-
severance and never-ending love and support. I know that sometimes it 
seems as though “we lose ourselves in work to do and bills to pay and 
that it’s a ride, ride, ride without much cover.” But you are always in my 
heart, a gift for which I remain deeply grateful.
—R. Duane Ireland

Preface
What Is New to This Edition?
This fifth edition is a thorough revision of our book. Each chapter was revised 
to reflect examples of current entrepreneurial firms and the latest thinking 
about entrepreneurship from academic journals and practitioner publications. 
Specifically, the following is new to the fifth edition.
Opening Profile Each chapter begins with a profile of an entrepreneurial 
firm that was started while the founders were in college. A total of 14 of the 15 
Opening Profiles (one for each chapter) are new to this edition. Each profile is 
specific to the chapter’s topic. The profiles are based on personal interviews 
with the student entrepreneurs involved.
Updated Boxed Features The majority of the “What Went Wrong?” 
“Savvy Entrepreneurial Firm,” and “Partnering for Success” features are new 
to this edition. These features not only alert students and readers to contem-
porary  issues facing entrepreneurial firms, but are meant to be helpful to them 
in a practical sense as well. Select features focus on topics such as how to find 
a mentor, how to select a business co-founder, and how to avoid the types of 
mistakes that typify unsuccessful entrepreneurial ventures. The two “You Be 
the VC” features at the end of each chapter have been a staple of the book 
since its inception. A total of 25 of the 30 “You be the VC” features in the fifth 
edition are new.
Barringer/Ireland Business Model Template One of the strongest 
additions to the fifth edition is the inclusion and thorough explanation of 
the Barringer/Ireland Business Model Template. We introduce this template 
to you in Chapter 4. It provides a nicely designed way for students to think 
through and articulate the business model for a proposed or existing firm. The 
template, which is similar in its intent and usefulness to the popular Business 
Model Canvas created by Alexander Osterwalder and Yves Pigneur, contains 
four sections and 11 parts. Chapter 4 fully explains each section and part. An 
enlarged version of the template is included in the Appendix to Chapter 4. It 
can be photocopied and used to assist students in completing business models 
for proposed or existing firms.
New and Updated Cases The majority of end-of-chapter cases are new 
to this edition. Those that were retained have been completely updated. The 
cases were carefully selected to illustrate the principles introduced in their re-
spective chapters. The questions included at the end of each case can be used 
to stimulate classroom discussion or for quizzes or tests.
Updated References The amount of academic research examining en-
trepreneurship-related topics continues to grow. To provide the most recent 
insights from academic journals, we draw upon recent research from jour-
nals such as Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal, Entrepreneurship Theory and 
Practice, Journal of Business Venturing, and Academy of Management Journal. 
Similarly, we relied on the most current articles appearing in business publica-
tions such as The Wall Street Journal and Entrepreneur among others, to pres-
ent you with examples of the actions being taken by today’s entrepreneurs as 
they lead their ventures.

14    PREFACE
Introduction to Entrepreneurship
There is tremendous interest in entrepreneurship on college campuses and 
around the world. One indicator of this interest is the fact that of the approxi-
mately 2,000 colleges and universities in the United States, about two-thirds of 
the total now offer a course in entrepreneurship. As a result, a growing number 
of students are forgoing traditional careers and starting their own businesses. 
Ordinary people across the world are equally interested in launching entrepre-
neurial careers. According to the 2013 Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, in the 
United States a total of 12.7 percent of the adult population is starting a busi-
ness or has started a business in the past three-and-a-half years. There are 
regions of the world where the percentage is even higher. In Brazil, for example, 
17.3 percent of the adult population is starting or has started a business in the 
past three-and-a-half years. The percentage is 24.3 percent in Chile.
The lure of entrepreneurship is the ability to create products and services 
that enhance people’s lives. You’ll see this through the many examples of 
entrepreneurial firms provided in the book. Particularly inspiring are the ex-
amples of businesses started while the founders were still in college. We begin 
each chapter of this book with a profile of a business that was founded while 
the founders were still in college. Several of the end-of-chapter cases are fo-
cused on student-founded businesses as well. The opening profile for Chapter 
3, for example, focuses on LuminAid, a business started by Andrea Sreshta 
and Anna Stork, two students at Columbia University. The three children 
pictured on the front page of Part I are looking at what Sreshta and Stork 
created—solar powered pillows that provide light for people in disaster relief 
situations. What we hope to accomplish via the profiles and cases about busi-
nesses that were started while their founders were still in college is to inspire 
the students who are using the book. Hopefully they’ll look at students like 
Sreshta and Stork and realize that they aren’t too different from them, and 
that they have the capacity to conceive a business idea and launch a success-
ful company too.
Many of the examples of student-inspired businesses provided in the 
book are both instructive and heartwarming. For example, Case 3.2 fo-
cuses on a company named Embrace, which was started by four Stanford 
University students. Embrace makes a product, called the Embrace Baby 
Warmer, which literally saves the lives of premature babies born in remote 
villages in developing countries. It looks like a small sleeping bag and con-
tains a warming element that when turned on emulates the heat provided 
by a more sophisticated incubator in a hospital. No one can read the case 
without being inspired and somewhat awed by what a motivated group of 
college students, surrounded by a supportive university and dedicated fac-
ulty and mentors, were able to accomplish when they set their sights on 
becoming entrepreneurs. A photo of the Embrace Baby Warmer is provided 
in the case. We invite you to go to Case 3.2 now to glance at the Embrace 
Baby Warmer.
There is one caveat to successful entrepreneurship, and it’s a big one. 
People, regardless of age, need a process to follow to successfully navigate the 
entrepreneurial journey. This is where our book offers unique value. The book 
describes entrepreneurship as a four step process, beginning with the deci-
sion to become an entrepreneur and culminating with managing and growing 
a successful firm. There is a lot in between, as you’ll see. Entrepreneurship 
is not easy, which is a sentiment that we express throughout the book. But 
it is doable, as evidenced by the many success stories provided. The process, 
pictured nearby, provides a framework or roadmap of the entrepreneurial pro-
cess that many professors, students, and others that have used the book have 
told us has been particularly helpful to them. In the book, we’re also careful 
to talk about failures as well as successes. Each chapter includes a boxed 

PREFACE    15
feature titled “What Went Wrong?” The feature contains a real-life example 
of something that went wrong with an entrepreneurial firm. Professors have 
commented to us that they appreciate having failure stories as well as suc-
cess stories as teaching tools in their classrooms. At the other extreme, each 
chapter also includes a boxed feature called “Savvy Entrepreneurial Firm.” 
In these features, we describe actions entrepreneurial firms have taken that 
contributed to their success. Complementing these features is a third one that 
is presented in each chapter. Called “Partnering for Success,” these features 
discuss relationships entrepreneurial firms form with various parties (such 
as suppliers and distributors) in order to increase the likelihood of being 
successful.
We sincerely hope that college and university students and their professors 
as well as others who choose to read this book will find it thoughtful, instruc-
tive, helpful, and inspiring. Our goal is to place into your hands—our readers— 
a book with the ability to both inspire and lead you through the steps in the 
entrepreneurial process.
How Is This Book Organized?
As mentioned above, the book is organized around the entrepreneurial process. 
The four parts of the entrepreneurial process are as follows:
Part 1: Decision to Become an Entrepreneur
Part 2: Developing Successful Business Ideas
Part 3: Moving from an Idea to an Entrepreneurial Firm
Part 4: Managing and Growing an Entrepreneurial Firm
The book mirrors this process. It is laid out in four parts and 15 chapters. 
The nearby figure depicts the parts of the process and the chapters that are 
included in each part.
What Are the Unique Aspects of the Book?
While using the book, we think you’ll find several unique features to be par-
ticularly helpful. The following table lays out the most unique features of the 
book followed by an explanation.

16    PREFACE
UniqUe FeatUre oF the Book
explanation
Focus on opportunity  
recognition,  feasibility analysis, 
and the developing of an effective 
business model.
The book opens with strong chapters on the front end 
of the  entrepreneurial process, including opportunity 
recognition,  feasibility analysis, and the development of 
an effective business model. These are activities that must 
be completed early when investigating the merits of a 
business idea.
First Screen (template for 
 completing feasibility analysis).
Chapter 3 (Appendix 3.1) provides a template for 
 completing a feasibility analysis. The template can be 
 copied and used to  complete a feasibility analysis for a 
business idea.
Internet Resource Table.
Chapter 3 (Appendix 3.2) contains a table of Internet 
 resources that can be used in completing a feasibility 
 analysis and in other aspects of investigating the  merits  
of a business idea.
Barringer/Ireland Business  
Model Template.
The Barringer/Ireland Business Model Template is a nicely 
designed template for helping students think through and 
articulate the business model for a proposed or existing 
firm. Each section of the template is fully explained in 
Chapter 4. The template can be easily copied and used by 
those wishing to develop a business model for an entrepre-
neurial venture.
Opening Profiles.
Each chapter starts with a profile of an entrepreneurial firm 
started while the founder of founders were still in college. 
Photos of the entrepreneurs and a Q&A format that allows 
readers to get to know a little about each of the student en-
trepreneurs  personally are included. All 15 opening profiles 
are unique to the fifth edition.
What Went Wrong?  
Boxed Features.
Each chapter contains a boxed feature titled “What Went 
Wrong?” This feature has been a very popular  aspect of 
the book. The features explain the missteps of seemingly 
promising entrepreneurial firms. The purpose is to pro-
vide students a healthy dose of stories about firms that 
either failed or suffered setbacks rather than focus just on 
 success stories. The features are followed by discussion 
questions that allows students to identify the causes of the 
setbacks or failures.
Savvy Entrepreneurial Firm  
Boxed Features.
Each chapter contains a boxed feature titled “Savvy 
Entrepreneurial Firm.” These features illustrate the types 
of business practices that facilitate the success of entrepre-
neurial ventures.
Partnering for Success Boxed  
Features.
Each chapter contains a boxed feature titled “Partnering for 
Success.” We present this feature in each chapter to highlight 
the fact that the ability to partner effectively with other firms 
is becoming an increasingly important attribute for successful 
entrepreneurial ventures.

PREFACE    17
You Be the VC end of chapter  
features
Two features, titled “You be the VC,” are provided at the 
end of each chapter. These features present a “pitch” for 
funding for an emerging entrepreneurial venture. The fea-
tures are designed to stimulate classroom discussion by 
sparking debate on whether a particular venture should 
or shouldn’t receive funding. All of the firms featured are 
real-life entrepreneurial ventures.
End of chapter cases
Two medium-length cases, written by the authors of the 
book, are featured at the end of each chapter. The cases 
are designed to stimulate classroom discussion and illus-
trate the issued discussed in the chapter.

The classic Entrepreneurial Story
Introduction to 
Entrepreneurship
Chapter 1

rowing up in Scotland, Fraser Doherty spent his childhood coming up with 
ideas for new products. Not all his money-making ideas were a success— 
indeed his fledgling egg-selling enterprise ended abruptly when a fox ate all his 
chickens—but he had a hunger to set up a business.
At the age of 14, Doherty gave jam-making a try. He had always 
enjoyed the jam his grandmother made and thought there might be 
an opportunity here. After making a batch and selling it door-to-door, 
he discovered people really liked it, and Doherty’s jam enterprise 
gradually spread into local shops and farmers’ markets. A feature in 
the Edinburgh Evening News brought in even more orders from fur-
ther afield.
After resolving to expand the business, Doherty did some research 
and found that sales of jam had been in decline for the past few de-
cades. Jam had acquired an old-fashioned image and people preferred 
healthier alternatives on their toast.
The solution the young Scottish entrepreneur came up with was 
a jam for the modern world. Doherty’s SuperJam would be made 
using traditional recipes, completely from fruit juice. The jars would 
contain no sugar and no artificial flavorings. He also boldly resolved 
to target supermarkets to sell his products.
Fraser faced a number of challenges. At this point, he was mak-
ing hundreds of jars of jam every week in his parents’ kitchen. Apart 
from the fact his parents were struggling to get in there to cook their 
dinner, the business clearly couldn’t grow any further.
At the age of 17, he was in no position to start a factory and he did not have any 
money to pay a design agency to create a brand either. He also did not have a clue 
how to approach supermarkets. In fact, all he had was a passion about his product 
and a great recipe.
The first supermarket Fraser approached was Waitrose on a “meet the buyer” day. 
Fraser pitched his idea to the senior jam buyer who liked it, but said it had a long way 
to go. He advised Fraser that he had to set up a production facility and create a brand 
before coming back with a well-priced product.
Fraser set off around the United Kingdom trying to convince food manufacturers 
to believe in his 100 percent fruit jam. He told them that he didn’t have any money to 

26    PART 1 | DECISIoN To BEComE AN ENTREPRENEUR
invest, but if they took the long-term view, then they too would reap the benefit. He did 
the same with a string of advertising agencies to persuade them to help him create a 
brand. Eventually, after two years of persistence, Doherty finally convinced a factory 
and an advertising agency to work with him.
SuperJam is exhibited in the National museum of Scotland as an “Iconic Scottish 
Brand” alongside Irn-Bru and Tunnock’s and Baxters, two other brands synony-
mous with Scotland. In 2010, Fraser shared his jam making secrets with the world 
in the SuperJam Cook, following this in 2011 with his autobiography and jam story, 
SuperBusiness. Since 2010, Fraser has been the entrepreneur-in-residence at the 
London metropolitan University where he delivers presentations and lecturers on 
 aspects of entrepreneurship.
Doherty has kept close to his customers throughout SuperJam’s meteoric rise and 
is conscious of the part technology and, in particular, social networks play in his busi-
ness and in retaining a meaningful conversation with his customers.
Against a backdrop of digital social networking, SuperJam Tea Parties are about 
as far removed from the virtual world as you could imagine. The company runs 
these events for elderly people who live alone, primarily in care homes or sheltered 
 accommodation. To date, they have run over 125 events across the UK. The mix of live 
 music, dancing, a heavy dose of scones, and SuperJam attract up to 600 people to 
each event.
From humble beginnings working at his kitchen table to grow his entrepreneur-
ial venture, Fraser now supplies over 2,000 supermarkets around the world with 
SuperJam and has won a variety of awards for the range. Fraser has now scooped 
over 20 prestigious awards, including Bighearted Scotland Business Person of The 
Year (2009), Smarta 100 Award (2010), and Inc magazine 30 under 30 Award (2010). 
He made the finals for “Times Young Power List” (2011), NatWest Enterprise Awards 
Finalist (2012) and Ben & Jerry’s “Join our Core” Finalist (2012).1
I
n this first chapter of your book about the successful launching of an en-
trepreneurial venture or firm, we define entrepreneurship and discuss why 
some people decide to become entrepreneurs. We then look at successful 
entrepreneurs’ characteristics, the common myths surrounding entrepreneur-
ship, the different types of start-up firms, and the changing demographics of 
entrepreneurs in the United States and in nations throughout the world. We 
then examine entrepreneurship’s importance, including the economic and 
social impact of new firms as well as the importance of entrepreneurial firms 
to larger businesses. To close this chapter, we introduce you to the entrepre-
neurial process. This process, which we believe is the foundation for success-

materials to you.

CHAPTER 1 | INTRoDUCTIoN To ENTREPRENEURSHIP    27
introduction to entrepreneurship
There is tremendous interest in entrepreneurship around the world. Although 
this statement may seem bold, there is evidence supporting it, some of which 
is provided by the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM). GEM, which is a 
joint research effort by Babson College, London Business School, Universidad 
del Desarrollo (Santiago, Chile), and Universiti Tun Abdul Razak (Malaysia), 
tracks entrepreneurship in 70 countries, including the United States. Of par-
ticular interest to GEM is early stage entrepreneurial activity, which consists 
of businesses that are just being started and businesses that have been in ex-
istence for less than three and a half years. A sample of the rate of early-stage 
entrepreneurial activity in countries included in the GEM study is shown in 
Table 1.1. While the highest rates of entrepreneurial start-up activities occur 
in low-income countries, where good jobs are not plentiful, the rates are also 
impressive in high-income countries such as Germany (5.0 percent), United 
Kingdom (7.1 percent), and the United States (12.7 percent). What the 12.7 
percent means for the United States is that almost 1 out of every 8 American 
adults is actively engaged in starting a business or is the owner/manager of a 
business that is less than three-and-a-half-years old.2
The GEM study also identifies whether its respondents are starting a new 
business to take advantage of an attractive opportunity or because of necessity 
to earn an income. The majority of people in high-income countries are drawn 
to entrepreneurship to take advantage of attractive opportunities. The reverse is 
true of people in low-income countries, who tend to be drawn to entrepreneur-
ship primarily because of necessity (resulting from a lack of career prospects).3
One criticism of entrepreneurship, which is often repeated in the press, is 
that the majority of new businesses fail. It simply isn’t true. The often used statis-
tic that 9 out of 10 businesses fail in their first few years is an exaggeration. For 
example, evidence indicates that the three-year survival rates for entrepreneurial 
ventures established in Denmark is 53.5 percent, while it is up to 66.9 percent 
in other parts of Europe.4 Historically, survival rates of entrepreneurial firms

launched in the United States have been as high as 50 percent after four years. 
While overall these figures are heartening, the percentage of firms that do fail in 
Europe, the United States, and throughout the world shows that a motivation to 
start and run a business isn’t enough; it must be coupled with a solid business 
idea, good financial management, and effective execution to maximize chances 
for success. In this book, we’ll discuss many examples of entrepreneurial firms 
and the factors separating successful new ventures from unsuccessful ones.
Many people see entrepreneurship as an attractive career path. Think about 
your friends and others you know. In all probability, you are acquainted with 
at least one or two people who want to become an entrepreneur—either now or 
at some point in the future. The number of books dealing with starting one’s 
own business is another indication entrepreneurship is growing in popularity. 
Amazon.com, for example, currently lists over 36,900 books and other items 
dealing with entrepreneurship and over 89,900 books concerned with small 
businesses. The number of books on small business is up from 62,700 just three 
years ago.
What is entrepreneurship and  
Why is it important?
The word entrepreneur derives from the French words entre, meaning “between,” 
and prendre, meaning “to take.” The word was originally used to describe people 
who “take on the risk” between buyers and sellers or who “undertake” a task such 
as starting a new venture.5 Inventors and entrepreneurs differ from each other. An 
inventor creates something new. An entrepreneur assembles and then integrates 
all the resources needed—the money, the people, the business model, the strategy, 
and the risk-bearing ability—to transform the invention into a  viable business.6
Entrepreneurship is defined as the process by which individuals pursue 
opportunities without regard to resources they currently control for the pur-
pose of exploiting future goods and services.7 Others, such as venture capitalist 
Fred Wilson, define it more simply, seeing entrepreneurship as the art of turn-
ing an idea into a business. In essence, an entrepreneur’s behavior finds him or 
her trying to identify opportunities and putting useful ideas into practice.8 The 
tasks called for by this behavior can be accomplished by either an individual or 
a group and typically require creativity, drive, and a willingness to take risks. 
Zach Schau, the cofounder of Pure Fix Cycles, exemplifies all these qualities. 
Zach saw an opportunity to create a new type of bicycle and a new type of bi-
cycling experience for riders, he risked his career by passing up alternatives to 
work on Pure Fix Cycles full time, and he’s now working hard to put Pure Fix 
Cycles in a position to deliver a creative and useful product to its customers.
In this book, we focus on entrepreneurship in the context of an entrepre-
neur or team of entrepreneurs launching a new business. However, ongoing 
firms can also behave entrepreneurially. Typically, established firms with an 
entrepreneurial emphasis are proactive, innovative, and risk-taking. For ex-
ample, Google is widely recognized as a firm in which entrepreneurial behaviors 
are clearly evident. Larry Page, one of Google’s cofounders, is at the heart of 
Google’s entrepreneurial culture. With his ability to persuade and motivate oth-
ers’ imaginations, Page continues to inspire Google’s employees as they develop 
innovative product after innovative product. To consider the penetration Google 
has with some of its innovations, think of how often you and people you know 
use the Google search engine, Gmail, Google Maps, or Google Earth. Google 
is currently working on a bevy of far-reaching innovations, such as Google 
Glasses and self-driving cars. Similarly, studying Facebook or Dropbox’s ability 
to grow and succeed reveals a history of entrepreneurial behavior at multiple 
levels within the firms.9 In addition, many of the firms traded on the NASDAQ, 
Learning Objective

and the characteristics of 
entrepreneurial firms.

CHAPTER 1 | INTRoDUCTIoN To ENTREPRENEURSHIP    29
such as Amgen, Intuit, Apple, and Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, are com-
monly thought of as entrepreneurial firms. The NASDAQ is the largest U.S. 
electronic stock market, with nearly 5,000 companies listed on the exchange.
We want to note here that established firms with an orientation toward 
acting entrepreneurially practice corporate entrepreneurship.10 All firms fall 
along a conceptual continuum that ranges from highly conservative to highly 
entrepreneurial. The position of a firm on this continuum is referred to as its 
entrepreneurial intensity.11 As we mentioned previously, entrepreneurial 
firms are typically proactive innovators and are not averse to taking calculated 
risks. In contrast, conservative firms take more of a “wait and see” posture, are 
less innovative, and are risk averse.
One of the most persuasive indications of entrepreneurship’s importance 
to an individual or to a firm is the degree of effort undertaken to behave in an 
entrepreneurial manner. Firms with higher entrepreneurial intensity regularly 
look for ways to cut bureaucracy. For example, Virgin Group, the large British 
conglomerate, works hard to keep its units small and instill in them an entre-
preneurial spirit. Virgin is one of the most recognized brands in Britain and is 
involved in businesses as diverse as airlines and music. In the following quote, 
Sir Richard Branson, the founder and CEO of Virgin, describes how his com-
pany operates in an entrepreneurial manner:
Convention … dictates that “big is beautiful,” but every time one of our ventures gets 
too big we divide it up into smaller units. I go to the deputy managing director, the 
deputy sales director, and the deputy marketing director and say, “Congratulations. 
You’re now MD [managing director], sales director and marketing director—of a new 
company.” Each time we’ve done this, the people involved haven’t had much more 
work to do, but necessarily they have a greater incentive to perform and a greater 
zeal for their work. The results for us have been terrific. By the time we sold Virgin 
Music, we had as many as 50 subsidiary record companies, and not one of them 
had more than 60 employees.12
Why Do people become entrepreneurs?
The three primary reasons that people become entrepreneurs and start their 
own firms are to be their own boss, pursue their own ideas, and realize finan-
cial rewards.
Be Their Own Boss
The first of these reasons—being one’s own boss—is given most commonly. This 
doesn’t mean, however, that entrepreneurs are difficult to work with or that they 
have trouble accepting authority. Instead, many entrepreneurs want to be their 
own boss because either they have had a long-time ambition to own their own firm 
or because they have become frustrated working in traditional jobs. The type of 
frustration that some entrepreneurs feel working in conventional jobs is exemplified 
by Wendy DeFeudis, the founder of VeryWendy, a company that makes  customized 
social invitations. Commenting on how her experiences working for herself have 
been more satisfying than working for a large firm, DeFeudis remarked:
I always wanted to be my own boss. I felt confined by the corporate structure. I 
found it frustrating and a complete waste of time—a waste to have to sell my ideas 
to multiple people and attend all kinds of internal meetings before moving forward 
with a concept.13
Some entrepreneurs transition from a traditional job to owning their own 
business more gradually, by starting their business part time to begin with. 
While this approach isn’t possible in all situations, by starting a business part

people decide to become 
entrepreneurs.

30    PART 1 | DECISIoN To BEComE AN ENTREPRENEUR
time individuals can gain valuable experience, tuck away the money they earn, 
and find out if they really like the business before deciding to leave their job. In 
some businesses, such as catering or financial planning, it takes time to build 
a client list. Some entrepreneurs will time their departure from their job with 
the point in time where their client list is large enough and profitable enough 
to support a full-time business.14
Pursue Their Own ideas
The second reason people start their own firms is to pursue their own ideas.15 
Some people are naturally alert, and when they recognize ideas for new prod-
ucts or services, they have a desire to see those ideas realized. Corporate en-
trepreneurs who innovate within the context of an existing firm typically have a 
mechanism for their ideas to become known. Established firms, however, often 
resist innovation. When this happens, employees are left with good ideas that 
go unfulfilled.16 Because of their passion and commitment, some employees 
choose to leave the firm employing them in order to start their own business as 
the means to develop their own ideas.
This chain of events can take place in non-corporate settings, too. For exam-
ple, some people, through a hobby, leisure activity, or just everyday life, recognize 
the need for a product or service that is not available in the marketplace. If the 
idea is viable enough to support a business, they commit tremendous time and 
energy to convert the idea into a part-time or full-time firm. In Chapters 2 and 3, 
we focus on how entrepreneurs spot ideas and determine if their ideas represent 
viable business opportunities.
An example of a person who left a job to pursue an idea is Melissa 
Pickering, the founder of iCreate to Educate, a company that is developing 
software apps that allows students to build, express, and share their creativity 
through animated videos. Pickering started her career as a mechanical engi-
neer at Walt Disney Corp., a role that she said is more commnonly referred to 
as an imagineer or a roller coaster engineer. She was struck by the fact that 
even at Dinsey, a place that some may refer to as the ultimate creative group, 
there weren’t many people who were female or close to her own age, and young 
engineers didn’t seem to be seeking out a Disney career. Her attention shifted 
to creativity and kids. Commenting on what happened next, she said:
My hunch was kids are not getting enough hands-on opportunities in the class-
room to express and engage their creativity and problem solving skills. At that point 
I sought to launch an education technology business that would provide kids with 
the tools to create and explore, fostering the natural innovator within.17
iCreate to Eductate is currently building a portfolio of products, which includes 
both an iPhone and an iPad app. All of the firm’s products are centered on help-
ing kids better develop and express their creativity.18
Pursue Financial Rewards
Finally, people start their own firms to pursue financial rewards. This motiva-
tion, however, is typically secondary to the first two and often fails to live up 
to its hype. The average entrepreneur does not make more money than some-
one with a similar amount of responsibility in a traditional job. The financial 
lure of entrepreneurship is its upside potential. People such as Jeff Bezos of 
Amazon.com, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, and Larry Page and Sergey Brin 
of Google made hundreds of millions of dollars building their firms. Money 
is also a unifier. Making a profit and increasing the value of a company is a 
solidifying goal that people can rally around. But money is rarely the primary 

CHAPTER 1 | INTRoDUCTIoN To ENTREPRENEURSHIP    31
motivation behind the launch of an entrepreneurial firm. Some entrepreneurs 
even report that the financial rewards associated with entrepreneurship can 
be bittersweet if they are accompanied by losing control of their firm. For ex-
ample, Sir Richard Branson, after selling Virgin Records, wrote, “I remember 
walking down the street [after the sale was completed]. I was crying. Tears … 
[were] streaming down my face. And there I was holding a check for a billion 
dollars…. If you’d have seen me, you would have thought I was loony. A billion 
dollars.”19 For Branson, it wasn’t just the money—it was the thrill of building 
the business and of seeing the success of his initial idea.
characteristics of successful entrepreneurs
Although many behaviors have been ascribed to entrepreneurs, several are 
common to those who are successful. Those in new ventures and those who 
are already part of an entrepreneurial firm share these qualities, which are 
shown in Figure 1.1 and described in the following section.
Passion for the Business
The number-one characteristic shared by successful entrepreneurs is a 
 passion for their business, whether it is in the context of a new firm or an 
existing business. This passion typically stems from the entrepreneur’s belief 
that the business will positively influence people’s lives. Making a difference 
in people’s lives is also the primary motivator behind many social enterprises, 
which are often started by people who set aside promising careers to pursue 
a social goal. This was the case with John Wood, who founded Room to Read 
and is the author of the book Leaving Microsoft to Change the World. Wood’s 
deep passion to help children in the developing world caused him to start 
cashing in small amounts of Microsoft stock to buy books and build schools, 
even before he left the company. In excerpts from an interview published by 
Forbes magazine, Wood said:
During my travels, I met so many children in the poorest parts of the world, lack-
ing access to school, books, and libraries, that I began cashing in small amounts 
of stocks to help them. Two hundred shares of Microsoft stock was enough to build 
an entire school in rural Nepal.20

Wood eventually left Microsoft to work on Room to Read full time. Since its 
inception in 2000, Room to Read has built 1,450 schools, established 12,522 
libraries, distributed over 10 million children’s books, and funded 13,662 long-
term girls’ schlorships in developing parts of the world.21
Passion is particularly important for both for-profit and not-for-profit en-
trepreneurial organizations because although rewarding, the process of start-
ing a firm or building a social enterprise is demanding. There are five primary 
reasons passion is important, as reflected in Table 1.2. Each of these reasons 
reflects a personal attribute that passion engenders. Removing just one of 
these qualities would make it much more difficult to launch and sustain a suc-
cessful entrepreneurial organization.
A note of caution is in order here: While entrepreneurs should have pas-
sion, they should not wear rose-colored glasses. It would be a mistake to be-
lieve that all one needs is passion and anything is possible. It is important to 
be enthusiastic about a business idea, but it is also important to understand 
its potential flaws and risks. In addition, entrepreneurs should understand 
that the most effective business ideas take hold when their passion is consis-
tent with their skills and is in an area that represents a legitimate business 
opportunity.
To illustrate the importance of passion, as well as other factors that are 
critical in determining a firm’s success or failure, we include a boxed fea-
ture titled “What Went Wrong?” in each chapter. The feature for this chap-
ter shows how Prim, a laundry and pick-up and delivery service, ultimately 
failed in part because its founders were not able to remain passionate about 
their business idea.
Table 1.2  Five primary reasons passion is important for the Launch of a successful 
entrepreneurial Organization
Reason Passion is important
Explanation
1.  The ability to learn and iterate
Founders don’t have all the answers. It takes passion and drive to solicit feedback, 
make necessary changes, and move forward. The changes won’t always be obvious. 
Passion makes the search for the right answers invigorating and fun.
2.  A willingness to work hard  
for an extended period of time
Commonly, entrepreneurs work longer hours than people with traditional jobs. You can 
only do that, on a sustained basis, if you’re passionate about what you’re doing.
3.  Ability to overcome setbacks  
and “no’s”
It’s rare that an entrepreneur doesn’t experience setbacks and hear many “no’s” from 
potential customers, investors, and others while building an entrepreneurial business  
or social enterprise. The energy to continue comes from passion for an idea.
4.  The ability to listen to feedback  
on the limitations of your  
organization and yourself
You’ll meet plenty of people along the way—some with good intentions and some 
 without—who will tell you how to improve your organization and how to improve 
yourself. You have to be willing to listen to the people with good intentions and make 
changes if it helps. You have to be able to brush aside feedback from people with bad 
intentions without letting them get you down.
5.  Perseverance and persistence  
when the going gets tough
Perseverance and persistence come from passion. As an entrepreneur, you’ll have 
down days. Building an entrepreneurial organization is fraught with challenges.  
Passion is what provides an entrepreneur the motivation to get through tough times.

CHAPTER 1 | INTRoDUCTIoN To ENTREPRENEURSHIP    33
p
rim’s idea was to disrupt the laundry industry. A 
growing number of people in the United States are 
using laundry services to wash and fold their clothes. 
The problems with these services is that they are a hassle. 
In most instances customers have to bag their laundry, 
drop them off at the laundry service, and then pick them 
up later. many services have lines at the busiest times of 
the day, which result in drivers having to wait to drop off or 
pick up their laundry.
Prim’s launched in mid-2013, after passing through 
the prestigueous Y-Combiator business accelerator 
program earlier that year. Here’s how Prim’s laundry 
service worked. A customer bagged her/his laundry, 
and then went online to choose a pickup and delivery 
time. The price was $25 for the first bag and $15 for 
each additional bag. The bags would be picked up 
by a driver recruited by a third-party delivery service. 
(Rickshaw was the name of the delivery service in the 
city where Prim started). Everything would be back, 
washed and folded, later that day or early the next day. 
No cash changed hands between the customer and 
the pickup or delivery drivers. Everything was paid for 
through Prim’s website. Prim gained favorable press 
and early momentum. When it closed, it was handling 
1,000 pounds of laundry a day from 40 clients and was 
growing. What went wrong?
Two things went wrong with Prim. First, once Prim 
got your clothes, it went from a innovative disruptor 
to an old-school company. It would take your clothes 
to a laundry service and utilize its wash and fold ser-
vices. Prim negotiated volume discounts with several 
laundry services, but the discounts were verbal and 
were not in writing. What Prim didn’t count on was the 
partnerships going sour. While the laundry services 
were initially receptive to working with Prim, they had 
their own delivery services and eventually saw Prim 
as siphoning off their customers and revenue. During 
its short history, Prim churned through three different 
laundry services.
The second thing that went wrong with Prim was a 
lack of passion and resolve on the part of its founders. 
Faced with the reality that working with local laundry 
services was a fragile business model, Prim’s found-
ers, Yin Yin Wu and Xuwen Cao, had a decision to 
make. Should they build or lease their own laundry 
service? This was a daunting prospect, given the hun-
dreds of thousands of dollars necessary to build and 
staff a high-volume laundry wash and fold facility. Even 
more daunting was the prospect that this step would 
need to be repeated in each new market Prim entered. 
After two months of deliberation, Wu and Cao pulled 
the plug. While they estimated that by constructing 
their own laundry service they could build a profitable 
business in 5 to 10 years, with revenues of $10 million 
to $15 million, it was a direction they simply did not 
want to pursue. Both were computer science students 
in college and had no direct experience in the laundry 
business. In an article published by CNNmoney, Garry 
Tan, a partner with Y-Combinator, reflecting on why Wu 
and Cao closed Prim, said, “They didn’t want to actu-
ally have to wash the laundry—they wanted to be the 
connector.”
Questions for Critical Thinking
 1. Why is passion such a critical part of entrepreneurial 
success? Prim’s founders were apparently passionate 
about building a company but not passionate about 
the laundry business specifically. In what ways is this 
combination problematic?
 2. How could Prim’s co-founders have better anticipted 
that laundry services would eventaully see Prim as 
siphoning off their own business and be reluctant to 
work with them?
 3. Rather than employ its own drivers to pick up and 
 deliver laundry for its customers, Prim relied on the 
use of third-party delivery services. In what ways do 
you think this approach could have limited Prim’s 
growth in other markets?
 4. San Francisco, the city in which Prim launched, has 
several innovative laundry services. These services 
include LaundryLocker, where you drop your clothes 
in a public locker, Sfwash, a delivery service where 
you pay by the pound, and Sudzee, which requires 
special lockable bags. Spend some time studying 
LaundryLocker (https://laundrylocker.com), Sfwash 
(https://sfwash.com), and Sudzee (https://sudzee.
com). Select the service that you think has the most 
potential and explain the rationale for your selection. 
Compare the service to Prim’s approach.

What Went Wrong?
Prim: How a Lack of Passion and Resolve Can Kill a Business

34    PART 1 | DECISIoN To BEComE AN ENTREPRENEUR
Product/customer Focus
A second defining characteristic of successful entrepreneurs is a product/ 
customer focus. This quality is exemplified by Steven Jobs, the late co-founder 
of Apple Inc., who wrote, “The computer is the most remarkable tool we’ve ever 
built … but the most important thing is to get them in the hands of as many 
people as possible.”22 This sentiment underscores an understanding of the two 
most important elements in any business—products and customers. While it’s 
important to think about management, marketing, finance, and the like, none 
of those functions makes any difference if a firm does not have good products 
with the capability to satisfy customers.
This philosophy is affirmed by Alex Algard, the founder of WhitePages.com. 
WhitePages.com started in 1997 to provide consumers a free, accurate, and 
fast online alternative to telephone directory assistance. It is one of the most 
trusted and comprehensive sources for consumers to quickly find relevant, ac-
curate contact information in North America. When asked how he was able to 
grow WhitePages.com from a one person operation in 1997 to the multimillion-
dollar company it is today, Algard’s reply reflected not only his feelings about 
the importance of providing value to both users and customers but also how a 
company measures if the value is being successfully delivered:
The philosopny that we as a company have always stuck to is that everything we 
build has to provide real value to both our users and customers. The best mea-
surement of whether or not we are successful at delivering something valuable is 
if our customers, advertisers in our case, are willing to pay.23
A product/customer focus also involves the diligence to spot product op-
portunities and to see them through to completion. The idea for the Apple 
Macintosh, for example, originated in the early 1980s when Steven Jobs and 
several other Apple employees took a tour of a Xerox research facility. They 
were astounded to see computers that displayed graphical icons and pull-
down menus. The computers also allowed users to navigate desktops using a 
small, wheeled device called a mouse. Jobs decided to use these innovations 
to create the Macintosh, the first user-friendly computer. Throughout the two 
and a half years the Macintosh team developed this new product, it main-
tained an intense product/customer focus, creating a high-quality computer 
that is easy to learn, fun to use, and meets the needs of a wide audience of 
potential users.24
Tenacity Despite Failure
Because entrepreneurs are typically trying something new, the possibility of 
failure exists. In addition, the process of developing a new business is some-
what similar to what a scientist experiences in the laboratory. A chemist, for 
example, typically has to try multiple combinations of chemicals before finding 
an optimal combination that can accomplish a certain objective. In a similar 
fashion, developing a new business idea may require a certain degree of experi-
mentation before a success is attained. Setbacks and failures inevitably occur 
during this process. The litmus test for entrepreneurs is their ability to perse-
vere through setbacks and failures.
An example of the degree of tenacity it sometimes takes to launch a suc-
cessful firm is provided by Jerry Stoppelman and Russel Simmons, the found-
ers of Yelp, the popular online review site. The original idea for Yelp, which 
was founded in 2004, is that when people are looking for a new restaurant, 
dentist, or plumber they normally ask their friends for recommendations. Yelp 
was launched to give people the ability to e-mail a list of their friends and ask 
for a recommendation. The message included a link that allowed the friend 

CHAPTER 1 | INTRoDUCTIoN To ENTREPRENEURSHIP    35
to easily respond. The business plan didn’t work. People started complaining 
that they were getting too many e-mail messages from friends who often didn’t 
have a recommendation to provide. Yelp could have died at this point. Instead, 
Stoppelman and Simmons demonstrated the tenacity it often takes to keep a 
business alive. Curiously, the one aspect of Yelp’s business plan that did work 
was the ability to write your own review—a feature that had been included by 
Stoppelman and Simmons almost as an afterthought. Rather than responding 
to a friend’s request for a recommendation, people seemed to enjoy sharing in-
formation about their favorite restaurant or hair salon without being asked. In 
2005, Yelp pivoted and revised its business plan. The new plan dropped the “e-
mail your friend idea” and focused on providing a platform for people to proac-
tively write reviews of local businesses. Today, Yelp is one of the most popular 
review sites on the Internet.
An additional example of tenacity, which involved all the employees of 
Pandora,25 is provided in the boxed feature titled “Savvy Entrepreneurial 
Firm.” In each chapter, this feature will provide an illustration of the exem-
plary behavior of one or more entrepreneurial firms or will provide an example 
of a tool or technique that well-managed entrepreneurial firms use to improve 
their performance.
Execution intelligence
The ability to fashion a solid idea into a viable business is a key characteristic 
of successful entrepreneurs. Commonly, this ability is thought of as execution 
intelligence.26 In many cases, execution intelligence is the factor that deter-
mines whether a start-up is successful or fails. An ancient Chinese saying 
warns, “To open a business is very easy; to keep it open is very difficult.”
The ability to effectively execute a business idea means developing a 
business model, putting together a new venture team, raising money, estab-
lishing partnerships, managing finances, leading and motivating employees, 
and so on. It also demands the ability to translate thought, creativity, and 
imagination into action and measurable results. As Jeff Bezos, the founder 
of Amazon.com, once said, “Ideas are easy. It’s execution that’s hard.”27 For 
many entrepreneurs, the hardest time is shortly after they launch their firm. 
This reality was expressed by Jodi Gallaer, the founder of a lingerie company, 
who said, “The most challenging part of my job is doing everything for the 
first time.”28
To illustrate solid execution, let’s look at Starbucks. The business idea of 
Howard Schultz, the entrepreneur behind the success of Starbucks, was his 
recognition of the fact that most Americans didn’t have a place to enjoy coffee 
in a comfortable, quiet setting. Seeing a great opportunity to satisfy customers’ 
needs, Schultz attacked the marketplace aggressively to make Starbucks the 
industry leader and to establish a national brand. First, he hired a seasoned 
management team, constructed a world-class roasting facility to supply his 
outlets with premium coffee beans, and focused on building an effective orga-
nizational infrastructure. Then Schultz recruited a management information 
systems expert from McDonald’s to design a point-of-sale system capable of 
tracking consumer purchases across 300 outlets. This decision was crucial to 
the firm’s ability to sustain rapid growth over the next several years. Starbucks 
succeeded because Howard Schultz knew how to execute a business idea.29 
He built a seasoned management team, implemented an effective strategy, and 
used information technology wisely to make his business thrive.30 These fun-
damental aspects of execution excellence should serve Schultz and Starbucks 
when it comes to dealing with the competitive challenges facing the firm in 
2014 and beyond. In mid-2014, over 21,000 Starbucks’ locations had been 
established in 65 countries.

common Myths about entrepreneurs
There are many misconceptions about who entrepreneurs are and what mo-
tivates them to launch firms to develop their ideas. Some misconceptions are 
because of the media covering atypical entrepreneurs, such as a couple of col-
lege students who obtain venture capital to fund a small business that they 
grow into a multimillion-dollar company. Such articles rarely state that these

mon myths regarding 
entrepreneurship.
M
ost everyone is familiar with Pandora, the Internet 
radio station. The service plays music of a certain 
genre based on the artist or type of music the 
user selects. The user then provides positive or negative 
feedback for songs chosen by Pandora, which are taken 
into account when the service selects future songs. 
While listening, users are offered the opportunity to buy 
the songs or albums at online retailers. over 400 differ-
ent musical attributes are considered when selecting the 
next song for a user. The goal is to provide the user the 
precise type of music that s/he wants to hear. Pandora 
has two subscription plans: a free service supported 
by ads and a fee-based service without ads. Pandora 
went public on June 15, 2011, and is now traded on the 
New York Stock Exchange. As of that date, Pandora 
had 800,000 songs from over 80,000 artists in its music 
library and 80 million users. A year later it reported it had 
150 million users.
Impressive, isn’t it? But, as the old saying goes, 
wait until you hear the rest of the story. Pandora was 
founded in 1999 by Tim Westergren, a musician and film 
composer. The company raised $1 million just before the 
Internet bubble burst. At that time, Pandora’s business 
model was to license its technology to other companies. 
The initial investment lasted about a year, which gave 
Westergren and his team enough time to build a proto-
type and have a product to show to potential customers. 
Then the money ran out. Pandora spent the next two 
and a half years essentially broke, earning only enough 
to keep the lights on. What was needed was an addi-
tional investment. Westergren pitched over 300 venture 
capitalists before one finally said yes. Pandora eventu-
ally shifted its business model to offer the Internet radio 
streaming service that it features today. Fast forward to 
the present: Today Pandora has over 250 million regis-
tered users.
So how did Pandora do it? How did it survive two 
and a half years with essentially no money? The an-
swer: Its employees agreed to work for no pay. They 
agreed to a deferred compensation plan, meaning they 
would get paid if and when the company raised money. 
Some used credit cards to survive, some had working 
spouses or significant others, and others worked two 
jobs. Reflecting on this period in Pandora’s history, 
Westergren, who was the first person to go without pay, 
said the employees agreed to the plan for two reasons. 
First, they believed in Pandora and its idea. They also 
believed that Pandora would ultimately raise money 
and become a successful business. Second, the em-
ployees felt a sense of responsibility for one another. If 
one left, the burden would be greater on the others. As 
time went on, Westergren believes, those relationships 
deepened and the employees ultimately stuck it out for 
one another.
When the funding did come through each employee 
was given his/her entire back pay. This is a very unusual 
outcome in the funding world. Usually, new money isn’t 
used to solve old problems, it’s used to build for the future. 
Westergren credits his investors for the outcome. He’s said 
that what the investors were investing in was the tenacity 
of the Pandora team.
Lesson Learned: This is what can be accomplished 
when an entire company demonstrates the tenacity nec-
essary to build a successful entrepreneurial firm.
Questions for Critical Thinking
 1. How do you think Westergren was able to perservere 
through 300 rejections before an investor finally said 
yes to Pandora’s attempts to raise additional money?
 2. If you had been a Pandora employee during the time 
the firm was essentially broke, would you have agreed 
to work for no money? Westergren provided two 
reasons that the employees present at the time were 
willing to work without pay. Would these reasons have 
been good enough for you? Explain your answer.
 3. Think of a time in your life where you showed tenacity 
and the tenacity produced positive outcomes. Briefly 
relate the story and what you learned from the experi-
ence to your classmates.
 4. What lesson or lessons can other entrepreneurial start-
ups learn from Pandora’s story?

CHAPTER 1 | INTRoDUCTIoN To ENTREPRENEURSHIP    37
entrepreneurs are the exception rather than the norm and that their success 
is a result of carefully executing an appropriate plan to commercialize what 
inherently is a solid business idea. Indeed, the success of many of the entre-
preneurs we study in each chapter’s Opening Profile is a result of carefully 
executing the different aspects of the entrepreneurial process. Let’s look at the 
most common myths and the realities about entrepreneurs.
myth 1: Entrepreneurs Are Born, not made
This myth is based on the mistaken belief that some people are genetically 
predisposed to be entrepreneurs. The consensus of many hundreds of stud-
ies on the psychological and sociological makeup of entrepreneurs is that 
entrepreneurs are not genetically different from other people. This evidence 
can be interpreted as meaning that no one is “born” to be an entrepreneur 
and that everyone has the potential to become one. Whether someone does or 
doesn’t is a function of environment, life experiences, and personal choices.31 
However, there are personality traits and characteristics commonly associated 
with entrepreneurs; these are listed in Table 1.3. These traits are developed 
over time and evolve from an individual’s social context. For example, studies 
show that people with parents who were self-employed are more likely to be-
come entrepreneurs.32 After witnessing a father’s or mother’s independence in 
the workplace, an individual is more likely to find independence appealing.33 
Similarly, people who personally know an entrepreneur are more than twice as 
likely to be involved in starting a new firm as those with no entrepreneur ac-
quaintances or role models.34 The positive impact of knowing an entrepreneur 
is explained by the fact that direct observation of other entrepreneurs reduces 
the ambiguity and uncertainty associated with the entrepreneurial process.
myth 2: Entrepreneurs Are Gamblers
A second myth about entrepreneurs is that they are gamblers and take big 
risks. The truth is, entrepreneurs are usually moderate risk takers, as are 
You might describe 
an entrepreneur as an 
 independent thinker, an 
 innovator, or perhaps a 
risk taker. These young 
entrepreneurs are passion-
ate enough to work at a 
hectic pace if that’s what it 
takes to get their company 
up and running.

most people.35 This finding is affirmed by The Hartford’s 2013 Small Business 
Success Study. The study conducted a survey of 2,600 business owners. A total 
of 79 percent of the participants rated themselves as conservative rather than 
risky.36 The idea that entrepreneurs are gamblers originates from two sources. 
First, entrepreneurs typically have jobs that are less structured, and so they 
face a more uncertain set of possibilities than managers or rank-and-file em-
ployees.37 For example, an entrepreneur who starts a social network consulting 
service has a less stable job than one working for a state governmental agency. 
Second, many entrepreneurs have a strong need to achieve and often set chal-
lenging goals, a behavior that is sometimes equated with risk taking.
myth 3: Entrepreneurs Are motivated Primarily  
by money
It is naïve to think that entrepreneurs don’t seek financial rewards. As dis-
cussed previously, however, money is rarely the primary reason entrepreneurs 
start new firms and persevere. The importance and role of money in a start-up 
is put in perspective by Colin Angle, the founder and CEO of iRobot, the maker 
of the popular Roomba robotic vacuum cleaner. Commenting on his company’s 
mission statement, Angle said:
Our, “Build Cool Stuff, Deliver Great Products, Have Fun, Make Money, Change the 
World” (mission statement) kept us (in the early days of the Company) unified with a 
common purpose while gut-wrenching change surrounded us. It reminded us that 
our goal was to have fun and make money. Most importantly, it reminded us that 
our mission was not only to make money, but to change the world in the process.38
Some entrepreneurs warn that the pursuit of money can be distracting. 
Media mogul Ted Turner said, “If you think money is a real big deal … you’ll 
be too scared of losing it to get it.”39 Similarly, Sam Walton, commenting on all 
the media attention that surrounded him after he was named the richest man 
in America by Forbes magazine in 1985, said:
Here’s the thing: money never has meant that much to me, not even in the sense 
of keeping score…. We’re not ashamed of having money, but I just don’t believe 
a big showy lifestyle is appropriate for anywhere, least of all here in Bentonville

where folks work hard for their money. We all know that everyone puts on their 
trousers one leg at a time…. I still can’t believe it was news that I get my hair cut 
at the barbershop. Where else would I get it cut? Why do I drive a pickup truck? 
What am I supposed to haul my dogs around in, a Rolls-Royce?40
myth 4: Entrepreneurs Should Be Young  
and Energetic
Entrepreneurial activity is fairly evenly spread out over age ranges. The age 
distribution of business owners, determined by the Kauffman Foundation 
and LegalZoom 2012 Startup Environment Index, is shown in Table 1.4. 
As shown, the majority of individuals who start companies are in their thir-
ties and forties. Not suprisingly, given this age distribution, the majoity of 
business owners have work experience prior to launching a new venture.41 
Although it is important to be energetic, investors often cite the strength of 
the entrepreneur (or team of entrepreneurs) as their most important criterion 
in the decision to fund new ventures.42 In fact, a sentiment that venture capi-
talists often express is that they would rather fund a strong entrepreneur with 
a mediocre business idea than fund a strong business idea and a mediocre 
entrepreneur. What makes an entrepreneur “strong” in the eyes of an investor 
is experience in the area of the proposed business, skills and abilities that will 
help the business, a solid reputation, a track record of success, and passion 
about the business idea. The first four of these five qualities favor older rather 
than younger entrepreneurs.
myth 5: Entrepreneurs love the Spotlight
Indeed, some entrepreneurs are flamboyant; however, the vast majority of 
them do not attract public attention. In fact, many entrepreneurs, because 
they are working on proprietary products or services, avoid public notice. 
Consider that entrepreneurs are the source of the launch of many of the 5,000 
companies listed on the NASDAQ, and many of these entrepreneurs are still 
actively involved with their firms. But how many of these entrepreneurs can 
you name? Perhaps three or four? Most of us could come up with Jeff Bezos 
of Amazon.com, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, and maybe Larry Page and 
Sergey Brin of Google or Larry Ellison of Oracle. Whether or not they sought 
attention, these are the entrepreneurs who are often in the news. But few of 
us could name the founders of Netflix, Twitter, or DIRECTV, even though we

frequently use these firms’ services. These entrepreneurs, like most, have 
 either avoided attention or been passed over by the popular press. They defy 
the myth that entrepreneurs, more so than other groups in our society, love 
the spotlight.
types of start-Up Firms
As shown in Figure 1.2, there are three types of start-up firms: salary-substitute 
firms, lifestyle firms, and entrepreneurial firms.
Salary-substitute firms are small firms that yield a level of income for 
their owner or owners that is similar to what they would earn when working for 
an employer. Dry cleaners, convenience stores, restaurants, accounting firms, 
retail stores, and hairstyling salons are examples of salary-substitute firms. 
The vast majority of small businesses fit into this category. Salary-substitute 
firms offer common, easily available and not particularly innovative products or 
services to customers.
Lifestyle firms provide their owner or owners the opportunity to pursue 
a particular lifestyle and earn a living while doing so. Lifestyle firms include 
personal trainers, golf and tennis pros, the owners of bed & breakfasts, 
and tour guides. These firms are not innovative, nor do they grow quickly. 
Commonly, lifestyle companies promote a particular sport, hobby, or pastime 
and may employ only the owner or just a handful of people.
Entrepreneurial firms bring new products and services to market. As we 
noted earlier in this chapter, the essence of entrepreneurship is creating value 
and then disseminating that value to customers. In this context, value refers to 
worth, importance, or utility. Entrepreneurial firms bring new products and ser-
vices to market by creating and then seizing opportunities. Dropbox, Facebook, 
and LinkedIn are well-known, highly successful examples of entrepreneurial 
firms. Having recognized an opportunity, the entrepreneurs leading companies 
of this type create products and services that have worth, are important to their 
customers, and provide a measure of usefulness to their customers that they 
wouldn’t have otherwise.
One characteristic of entrepreneurial firms, which will be explored through-
out this book, is that they partner with other firms and organizations, often to 
obtain the boost they need to realize their full potential. In each chapter, look 
for the boxed feature titled “Partnering for Success,” which illustrates how 
entepreneurial firms used partnerships to increase their chances for success. 
This feature in this chapter discusses how entreprenurs and their firms are 
engaging business incubators and accelerators to gain access to mentors, 
partners, investors, and other critical start-up resources.
Next, we describe the newly emerging characteristics of today’s entrepre-
neurs. You may be surprised to learn about the types of individuals who are 
choosing to become entrepreneurs! While reading these characteristics, think 
about people you know who are accurately described by these characteristics. 
Do you think any of these people will choose to become entrepreneurs?

t
he number of start-up incubator and accelerator 
programs in the United States continues to grow. 
These are programs for which entrepreneurs must 
apply. In some cases, the programs require that the en-
trepreneur or team of entrepreneurs surrender a small 
amount of equity for a similarly small amount of seed 
funding. In other cases, the start-ups pay a modest 
amount for participation or rent but do not surrender 
equity in their firms. The greatest advantage of getting 
into one of these programs is the mentorship opportuni-
ties they provide. Start-up incubators and accelerators 
are also fertile places for entrepreneurs to meet potential 
co-founders, business partners, and/or equity investors.
The two most well-known accelerator programs are 
Y-Combinator and Tech Stars. Y-Combinator is located 
in the Silicon Valley. It provides seed stage funding, 
mentorship, and networking opportunities to its partici-
pants in two, three-month sessions per year. Started in 
Boulder, Colorado, TechStars is similar to Y-Combinator 
in that it provides seed stage funding in three-month 
membership programs. TechStars has now expanded 
to Austin, Boston, Chicago, London, New York City, and 
Seattle.
While admission to Y-Combinator and TechStars is 
very competitive and requires a start-up to be physically 
present where Y-Combinator and TechStars is locted, 
there are a growing number of start-up incubators and 
accelerators in most American cities. To illustrate this 
point, the following is a list of the incubator and accel-
erator programs available in Austin, Texas. While Austin 
may offer an above-average number of programs, a little 
digging turns up a surprising number of similar programs 
in medium-sized and large American cities and on col-
lege campuses.
DreamIt Austin: A three-month program that provides 
the entrepreneurs it selects with pre-seed funding (up to 
$25,000), mentoring from seasoned entrepreneurs, access 
to follow-on capital, and work space in a creative, rigorous 
start-up environment.
Capital Factory: offers an accelerator program 
and co-working space and hosts meetups and other 
events for aspiring entrepreneurs. The accelerator pro-
gram matches $50,000 angel investments and then tar-
gets select portfolio companies for $250,000 follow-on 
investments.
Tech Ranch: A for-profit incubator that offers co-
working space along with consulting services and spe-
cialized programs to help entrepreneurs launch their 
ventures. Its flagship programs include Venture Start, 
which is a one-day program, Venture Forth, an 8-week 
bootcamp, and Venture Builder, a 26-week partnership 
between Tech Ranch and business founders to launch 
promising entrepreneurial firms.
TechStars Austin: A three-month accelerator program 
that puts seed money into start-ups in exchange for a 
small amount of equity. TechStars provides participating 
start-ups workspace in a stimulating environment, along 
with access to top-quality mentors.
Incubation Station: An accelerator program focused 
on consumer goods companies. Selected start-ups par-
ticipate in intensive 12- to 14-week mentoring programs 
designed to maximize the potential for success. Provides 
participants access to high-quality mentors and other 
forms of industry-relevant support.
Austin Technology Incubator: The start-up incubator 
at the University of Texas at Austin. It is affiliated with the 
university’s IC2 Institute.
Texas Venture Labs: Supports business start-ups on 
the University of Texas at Austin campus via mentoring, 
team building, market and business plan validation, tech-
nology commercialization, and domain knowledge needed 
to start and grow entrepreneurial ventures.
Longhorn Startup: A semester-long program for un-
dergraduate students on the University of Texas at Austin 
campus. It places students in interdisciplinary teams to 
start real companies. Each semester ends with participat-
ing students pitching to investors at a Demo Day.
SXSW Accelerator: Competition takes place during 
South by Southwest, which is an annual film, music, 
and interactive (technology) conference held in march 
of each year. The judges choose 18 finalists, who give a 
final pitch, and then the winners are chosen.

changing Demographics of entrepreneurs
Over the past 10 years, the demographic makeup of entrepreneurial firms has 
changed in the United States and around the world. Of the 23 million busi-
nesses in the United States,43 women, minorities, seniors, and young people 
own an increasingly larger number of them. This is an exciting development for 
the entrepreneurial sector of the U.S. economy.
Women Entrepreneurs
While men are still more likely to start businesses than women, the number 
of women-owned businesses is increasing. According to a study commis-
sioned by American Express OPEN, there were 8.6 million women-owned 
businesses in the United States in 2013, generating over $1.3 trillion in rev-
enues and employing nearly 7.8 million people. In addition, between 1997 
and 2013, the number of women who owned businesses increased at a rate 
of one-and-a-half times the national average. Particularly impressive is the 
growth in the number of firms owned by women who are minorities. A total of 
33 percent of women-owned firms are now owned by minorities, up from 17 
percent 16 years ago.44
Additional data is available from the 2007 U.S. Census Beureau’s report 
on Women Owned Business (the most recent year the data was collected). 
According to the report, in some industries, women control a significant share 
of the business. For example, women-owned businesses accounted for 52 per-
cent of all businesses in the health care and social assistance sector. The three 
states with the highest number of women-owned businesses in 2007 were 
California, Texas, and New York. There were 141,893 women-owned busi-
nesses earning more than $1 million in 2007.45
The number of groups that support and advocate for women-owned 
businesses continues to increase. An example of these groups is Count Me 
In (www.countmein.org), which is the leading national not-for-profit pro-
vider of resources, business education, and community support for women 
entrepreneurs.46

minority Entrepreneurs
There has been a substantial increase in minority entrepreneurs in the United 
States. The most comperhensive statistics are reported by the Minority Business 
Development Agency (www.mbda.gov). According to the MBDA, between 2002 
and 2007 (the most recent years the data was collected), minority-owned firms 
outpaced the growth of non-minority firms in gross receipts, employment, 
and number of firms. In 2007, there were 5.8 million minority-owned firms. 
Minorities represented 36 percent of the U.S. population in 2010, and will be-
come the majority of the population by 2042.47
In 2007, there were about 1.9 million African American–owned firms in the 
United States. The African American firms with employees had average receipts 
of over $911,000 and average employment of 9 workers. Similarly, in 2007 there 
were 1.5 million Asian American–owned firms. The Asian American firms with 
employees had average receipts of more than $1.1 million and 7 employees. 
Finally, in 2007, there were about 2.3 million Hispanic-owned firms in the United 
States. The Hispanic firms with employees had average receipts of $1.1 million 
and 8 workers.48
Similar to women entrepreneurs, an important factor facilitating the growth of 
minority entrepreneurs is the number of organizations that promote and provide 
assistance. Examples include the Latin Business Association, Black Business 
Association, National Indian Business Association, The National Council of 
Asian American Business Associations, and the Minority Business Development 
Agency, which is part of the United States Department of Commerce.
Senior Entrepreneurs
The number of seniors (those 50 years of age and older) starting businesses is 
substantial and growing. According to the Kauffman Foundation and LegalZoom 
study cited earlier in the chapter, in 2012, 20 percent of new businesses were 
started by people between 50 and 59 years old while another 12.5 percent were 
founded by individuals 60 years old and older.49 This increase is attributed to a 
number of factors, including corporate downsizing, an increasing desire among 
older workers for more personal fulfillment in their lives, and growing worries 
among seniors that they need to earn additional income to pay for future health 
care services and other expenses. Many people in the 50 and older age range 
have substantial business experience, financial resources that they can draw 
upon, and excellent vigor and health, which make them ideal candidates to 
start businesses in many industries. In addition, the steady increase in life ex-
pectancy means that Americans are not only living longer, but are living health-
ier longer, and are likely to remain engaged in either a job or an entrepreneurial 
venture longer in their lives than earlier generations.
Young Entrepreneurs
A desire to pursue an entrepreneurial career is high among young people. 
According to a recent Gallop survey, about 4 in 10 kids in grades 5–12 say they 
plan to start their own business. Interestingly, the percentage is higher among 
girls (46 percent) than boys (40 percent). About 59 percent of students in 
grades 5–12 say their school offers classes in how to start a business. This per-
centage represents a 9 percent jump from 2011 to 2012. About one-third (32 
percent) of young people say their parents or guardians have started a busi-
ness, which provides them a firsthand look at the entrepreneurial lifestyle.50
A number of organizations are involved in spurring interest in entrepreneur-
iship among young people. The Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship (NFTE), 
for example, provides entrepreneurship education programs to young people 

44    PART 1 | DECISIoN To BEComE AN ENTREPRENEUR
from low-income communities. A nonprofit organization called Lemonade Day, 
sponsored in part by Google, is a 14-step process that walks young people from 
a business concept to a business plan and beyond. The idea is to expose young 
people to entrepreneurial concepts by helping them start and operate their own 
business—a lemonade stand. Launched in 2007, Lemonade Day has grown 
from 2,700 kids in Houston, Texas, to more than 200,000 kids in cities across 
the United States. The organization’s goal is to eventually provide this experi-
ence to 1 million kids in 100 cities each year.51
In addition to organizations targeting elementary and middle-aged school 
kids, a growing number of colleges and universities are offering entrepreneur-
ship-focused programs for high school students. Babson College, for example, 
offers a five-week summer program for high school juniors and seniors. The 
program, called the Babson Entrepreneurial Development Experience, allows 
students to work together on new business ideas. The students can earn college 
credit and learn from top-ranked faculty in a challenging college atmosphere.52
On university and college campuses, interest in entrepreneurship education 
is at an all-time high. More than 2,300 colleges and universities in the United 
States offer at least one course in entrepreneurship at the undergraduate or 
graduate level.53 Although the bulk of entrepreneurship education takes place 
within business schools, many other colleges and departments are offering en-
trepreneurship courses as well—including engineering, agriculture, law, hospi-
tality management, and nursing.
A growing number of organizations are popping up that focus on helping 
college student entrepreneurs. These organizations range from the Dorm Room 
Fund, which is a student-run venture fund that invests in student-initiatied 
start-ups, to Startup Weekend, which helps students organize teams and launch 
start-ups in 54 hours. A sample of these organizations is shown in Table 1.5.
the positive effects of entrepreneurship 
and entrepreneurial Firms
Entrepreneurship’s importance to an economy and the society in which it 
resides was expertly articulated in 1934 by Joseph Schumpeter, an Austrian 
economist who did the majority of his work at Harvard University. In his book 
The Theory of Economic Development, Schumpeter argued that entrepreneurs 
develop new products and technologies that over time make current products 
and technologies obsolete. Schumpeter called this process creative destruc-
tion. Because new products and technologies are typically better than those 
they replace and the availability of improved products and technologies in-
creases consumer demand, creative destruction stimulates economic activity. 
The new products and technologies may also increase the productivity of all 
elements of a society.54
The creative destruction process is initiated most effectively by start-up 
ventures that improve on what is currently available. Small firms that prac-
tice this art are often called “innovators” or “agents of change.” The process of 
creative destruction is not limited to new products and technologies; it can in-
clude new pricing strategies (e.g., Netflix in DVDs), new distribution channels 
(such as e-books for books), or new retail formats (such as IKEA in furniture 
and Whole Foods Market in groceries).
Now let’s look more closely at entrepreneurship’s importance.

strength and stability.

innovation  Innovation is the process of creating something new, which 
is central to the entrepreneurial process.55 According to the Small Business 
Administration (SBA) Office of Advocacy, small innovative firms are 16 times 
more productive than large innovative firms in terms of patents per employee. 
Small firms tend to be particularly innovative in certain industries, as measured 
by patent activity. For example, small firms account for more than 32 percent of 
patents in both smart grids and solar energy and 15 percent of patents in bat-
teries and fuel cells.56
Job Creation  According to the SBA, small businesses create a substantial 
number of net new jobs in the United States. Firms with 500 or fewer employ-
ees create 65 percent of new jobs on an annual basis, while firms with 50 or 
fewer employees create 32 percent of new jobs. The only downside of small 
business jobs is that employee pay tends to be less than is the case in larger 
companies. According to the SBA, weekly wages averaged $679 at businesses 
with 5 to 9 employees, $815 at businesses with 50 to 99 employees, and 
$1,000 for firms with over 250 employees.57 Still, small businesses are held in 
high regard in terms of job creation.
Entrepreneurial Firms’ impact on Society
Entrepreneurial firms’ innovations have a dramatic impact on a society. Think 
of all the new products and services that make our lives easier, enhance our 
productivity at work, improve our health, and entertain us. For example, 
Amgen, an entrepreneurial firm that helped pioneer the biotechnology industry, 
has produced a number of drugs that have dramatically improved people’s lives. 
An example is NEUPOGEN, a drug that decreases the incidence of infection in 
cancer patients who are undergoing chemotherapy treatment. In addition to 
improved health care, consider smartphones, social networks, Internet shop-
ping, overnight package delivery, and digital photography. All these products 
are new to this generation, yet it’s hard to imagine our world without them.
However, innovations do create moral and ethical issues with which societies 
are forced to grapple. For example, bar-code scanner technology and the Internet 
have made it easier for companies to track the purchasing behavior of their cus-
tomers, a fact that raises privacy concerns. Similarly, bioengineering has made it 
easier to extend the shelf life of many food products, but some researchers and 
consumers question the long-term health implications of bioengineered foods.
Entrepreneurial Firms’ impact on larger Firms
In addition to the impact that entrepreneurial firms have on economies and 
 societies, they also positively impact the effectiveness of larger firms. For exam-
ple, some entrepreneurial firms are original equipment manufacturers, producing 
parts that go into products that larger firms manufacture and sell. Thus, many 
exciting new products, such as smartphones, digital cameras, and improved pre-
scription drugs, are not solely the result of the efforts of larger companies with 
strong brand names, such as Samsung, Apple, and Johnson & Johnson. They 
were produced with the cutting-edge component parts or research-and-develop-
ment efforts provided by entrepreneurial firms.
The evidence shows that many entrepreneurial firms have built their entire 
business models around producing products and services that increase the 
efficiency or effectiveness of larger firms. For example, an increasing number 
of U.S. firms are competing in foreign markets. These initiatives often require 
firms to employ translators to help them communicate with their foreign coun-
terparts. SpeakLike, a 2008 start-up, has created an online service that pro-
vides real-time translation services for two or more people who speak different 

CHAPTER 1 | INTRoDUCTIoN To ENTREPRENEURSHIP    47
languages. This cost of this service is considerably below what it costs to employ 
human translators. A large percentage of SpeakLike’s customers are large firms. 
Similarly, Box is an entreprenurial start-up that allows clients to store data files 
in the cloud. The majority of Fortune 500 companies are now Box subscribers.
the entrepreneurial process
The entrepreneurial process we discuss in this book consists of four steps:
Step1 Deciding to become an entrepreneur
Step2 Developing successful business ideas
Step3 Moving from an idea to an entrepreneurial firm
Step4 Managing and growing the entrepreneurial firm
Figure 1.3 models the entrepreneurial process you’ll study while reading 
this text. This process is the guide or framework around which we develop this 
book’s contents. The double-headed arrow between the decision to become an 
entrepreneur and the development of successful business ideas indicates that 
sometimes the opportunity to develop an idea prompts a person to become an 
entrepreneur. Each section of Figure 1.3 is explained in the following sections.
Decision to Become an Entrepreneur (chapter 1)
As discussed earlier, people become entrepreneurs to be their own bosses, to 
pursue their own ideas, and to realize financial rewards. Usually, a triggering 
event prompts an individual to become an entrepreneur.58 For example, an 
individual may lose her job and decide that the time is right to start her own 
business. Or a person might receive an inheritance and for the first time in his 
life have the money to start his own company. Lifestyle issues may also trigger 
entrepreneurial careers. For example, a woman may wait until her youngest 
child is in school before she decides to launch her own entrepreneurial venture.
Developing Successful Business ideas  
(chapters 2–6)
Many new businesses fail not because the entrepreneur didn’t work hard but 
because there was no real opportunity to begin with. Developing a success-
ful business idea includes opportunity recognition, feasibility analysis, the 
development of an effective business model, industry analysis, and writing 
a business plan. Chapter 2 takes a scientific look at how entrepreneurs rec-
ognize opportunities and describes how the opportunity recognition process 
typically unfolds. Chapter 3 focuses on feasibility analysis: the way to de-
termine whether an idea represents a viable business opportunity. Chapter 
4 focuses on the important topic of developing an effective business model. 
A firm’s business model is its plan or receipe for how it creates, deliv-
ers, and captures value for its stakeholders. Entrepreneurial firms need to 
have a crystal clear understanding of the issues concerned with creating, 
delivering, and capturing value if they are to be successful. Industry and 
competitor analysis is our concern in Chapter 5. Knowing the industry in 
which a firm will choose to compete is crucial to an entrepreneur’s success. 
In Chapter 6, we describe how to write a business plan. A business plan is 
a written document that describes all the aspects of a business venture in a 
concise manner. It is usually necessary to have a written business plan to 
raise money and attract high-quality business partners. Some entrepreneurs 
Learning Objective

process.

48    PART 1 | DECISIoN To BEComE AN ENTREPRENEUR
are impatient and don’t want to spend the time it takes to write a business 
plan.59 This approach is usually a mistake. Writing a business plan forces an 
entrepreneur to think carefully through all the aspects of a business venture. 
It also helps a new venture establish a set of milestones that can be used to 
guide the early phases of the business rollout.
moving from an idea to an Entrepreneurial Firm 
(chapters 7–10)
The first step in turning an idea into reality is to prepare a proper ethical and 
legal foundation for a firm, including selecting an appropriate form of busi-
ness ownership. These issues are discussed in Chapter 7. Chapter 8 deals 
with the important topic of assessing a new venture’s financial strength and 
viability-. Important information is contained in this chapter about com-
pleting and analyzing both historical and pro forma financial statements. 
Chapter  9 focuses on building a new-venture team. Chapter 10 highlights 
the important task of getting financing or funding and identifies the options a 
firm has for raising money.
managing and Growing an Entrepreneurial Firm 
(chapters 11–15)
Given today’s competitive environment, all firms must be managed and grown 
properly to ensure their ongoing success. This is the final stage of the entre-
preneurial process.

Chapter 11 focuses on the unique marketing issues facing entrepreneurial 
firms, including selecting an appropriate target market, building a brand, and 
the four Ps—product, price, promotion, and place (or distribution). Chapter 12 
examines the important role of intellectual property in the growth of entrepre-
neurial firms. More and more, the value of “know-how” exceeds the value of a 
company’s physical assets. In addition, we will talk about protecting business 
ideas through intellectual property statutes, such as patents, trademarks, 
copyrights, and trade secrets.
Preparing for and evaluting the challenges of growth is the topic of 
Chapter  13. We’ll look at the characteristics and behaviors of successful 
growth firms. In Chapter 14, we’ll study strategies for growth, ranging from 
new product development to mergers and acquisitions. We conclude with 
Chapter 15, which focuses on franchising. Not all franchise organizations are 
entrepreneurial firms, but franchising is a growing component of the entrepre-
neurial landscape. When you finish studying these 15 chapters, you will have 
been exposed to all components of the entrepreneurial process—a process that 
is vital to entrepreneurial success.

Chapter Summary
behaviors as an entrepreneur. The chal-
lenge for entrepreneurs is to carefully 
examine myths and prevent each of them 
from negatively affecting their approach 
to entrepreneurship.
 LO5. There are three types of start-up firms. 
Entrepreneurial firms are the firms that 
bring new products and services to mar-
ket by recognizing and seizing opportu-
nities regardless of the resources they 
currently control. Entrepreneurial firms 
stress innovation, which is not the case 
for salary-substitute and lifestyle firms. 
In the case of a salary-substitue firm, the 
entrepreneur seeks to earn an amount of 
income that is similar or identical to what 
s/he can earn by working as an employee 
for another company. Lifestyle firms are 
ones through which an entrepreneur can 
pursue a desire to experience a certain 
lifestyle (e.g., as a hunting trip guide) and 
earn a sufficient amount of income while 
doing so.
 LO6. The demographic makeup of those launch-
ing entrepreneurial firms is changing in the 
United States and around the world. There 
is growing evidence that an increasing 
number of women, minorities, seniors, and 
young people are becoming actively involved 
in the entrepreneurial process. Evidence 
suggests that each of these groups of entre-
preneurs are capable of  appropriately using 
the entrepreneurial process as a foundation 
for developing a successful entrepreneurial 
venture.
 LO7. There is strong evidence that entrepre-
neurship and the entrepreneurial behavior 
associated with it have significantly posi-
tive impacts on the stability and strength 
of economies throughout the world. The 
areas in which entrepreneurial firms con-
tribute the most are innovation and job 
creation. Entrepreneurial behavior also 
has a dramatic impact on society. It’s easy 
to think of new products and services that 
have helped make our lives easier, that 
have made us more productive at work, 
that have improved our health, and that 
have entertained us in new ways. In addi-
tion, entrepreneurial firms have a positive 
impact on the effectiveness of larger firms. 
There are many entrepreneurial firms that 
have built their entire business models 
 LO1. Entrepreneurship is the process by which 
individuals pursue opportunities without 
regard to resources they currently control. 
A specific application of entrepreneurship 
called corporate entrepreneurship is the 
conceptualization of entrepreneurship at 
the organizational level. Entrepreneurial 
firms are proactive, innovative, and risk 
taking. In contrast, conservative firms take 
a more “wait and see” posture, are less in-
novative, and are risk averse.
 LO2. The three primary reasons that people 
decide to become entrepreneurs and start 
their own firms are as follows: to be their 
own boss, to pursue their own ideas, 
and to realize financial rewards. Of these 
reasons, the desire to be one’s own boss 
or manager is the driving force of most 
individuals’ decision to become an entre-
preneur. While important, the desire to 
reap financial rewards from one’s entre-
preneurial endeavors is secondary to the 
other two reasons people decide to launch 
their own firm.
 LO3. Passion for the business, product/cus-
tomer focus, tenacity despite failure, and 
execution intelligence are the four pri-
mary characteristics of successful entre-
preneurs. Of these four, being passionate 
about the firm the entrepreneur intends 
to launch is the most common character-
istic shared among successful entrepre-
neurs. Commonly, the entrepreneur’s pas-
sion is demonstrated by a belief that her/
his firm will make a difference in people’s 
lives. Always concentrating on the product 
or service as a means of satisfying a cus-
tomer need, being tenancious in pursuing 
an entrepreneurial opportunity, and the 
ability to craft a business idea into a vi-
able business operation are the other key 
characteristics associated with successful 
entrepreneurs.
 LO4. The five most common myths regard-
ing entrepreneurship are that entrepre-
neurs are born, not made; that entrepre-
neurs are gamblers; that entrepreneurs 
are motivated primarily by money; that 
entrepreneurs should be young and en-
ergetic; and that entrepreneurs love the 
spotlight. The issue with myths is that, 
if unchecked, they can affect an individ-
ual’s orientation toward and subsequent

 1-22. After rereading the opening case, identify 
all of the effective or smart moves Zac 
Schau and his co-founders made in the 
early days of building Pure Fix Cycles.
 1-23. You have been invited by a local community 
college to talk to the students on how to de-
velop entrepreneurial skills. However, some 
of your colleagues are against the idea as 
they believe that  entrepreneurial skills can 
only be acquired through life experiences 
and firsthand knowledge. Prepare a speech 
on the key elements of being a successful 
entrepreneur to convince both the students 
and your colleagues.
 1-24. As a business lecturer, Peter has asked 
students in his class to present in groups 
a few business ideas that they are plan-
ning to pursue after their graduation. One 
particular group has caught his  attention. 
Their business idea on developing an 
ecotourism center in their neighborhood 
seems possible and realistic. It might be a 
good opportunity for them to take this to 
the next level. However, when Peter spoke 
to them it became clear that they had 
many misconceptions about being entre-
preneurs and were afraid to pursue this 
as a career. How can Peter ease their fears 
and convince them to follow their dreams?
 1-25. One question that is often asked by 
people thinking about launching an 
entrepreneurial venture is “what should 
first-time entrepreneurs know before they 
launch?” Based on information featured 
in Chapter 1, what should entrepreneurs 
know before they commit to launching 
their firm?
 1-26. A friend came up to you for advice. She 
has been contemplating for some time 
now to start a new venture. She has been 
employed in the corporate sector for the 
past 15 years, and has finally decided to 
pursue her dream of being self-employed 
and start a wellness center with a focus 
on healthy living. However, she is still a 
little confused. She is looking to learn the 
positive effects of entrepreneurship. Help 
her decide why she should undertake this 
process?
 1-27. A group of new students in your entre-
preneurship class was heard arguing that 
 being an entrepreneur positively affects 
the entrepreneur in question only. They 
do not believe that an entrepreneur ben-
efits the society and the nation as well. 
They do not understand that creative 
 destruction stimulates economic activity 
and increases the productivity of all ele-
ments of a society. Explain to them the 
positive effects of entrepreneurship and 
entrepreneurial firms on economies and 
societies.
Application Questions

CHAPTER 1 | INTRoDUCTIoN To ENTREPRENEURSHIP    53
Business idea: Create an online platform that allows 
people to connect with personal trainers via live, interactive 
video, and participate in one-on-one or group training 
sessions.
Pitch: many people are interested in engaging a personal 
trainer, to not only plan and lead their workouts but to 
provide motivation, feedback, and accountability. The 
problem is that people are busy and often don’t have the 
time to meet a personal trainer at a gym when the trainer 
is available. meeting with a personal trainer is even more 
difficult for people who travel frequently, particularly if their 
travel schedule varies from week to week.
Wello was designed to solve this problem. It is an online 
platform that allows anyone with a Web camera and 
Internet access to meet with a personal trainer online to 
conduct a workout. Workouts are available on a one-to-
one basis or in a group setting. You have the same inter-
active, personalized experience but from the comfort of 
your home, office, hotel room, or wherever you work out. 
Wello has personal trainers available that offer sessions 
in yoga, Pilates, aerobics, general training, sports/perfor-
mance, martial arts, and therapy/rehab.
Here’s how Wello works. You go to the firm’s website and 
select the type of training you desire. You then indicate 
the day you’d like the workout, and Wello will provide 
you a list of the trainers that are available that day and 
when they are available. Each trainer has a profile page 
that includes a bio, a list of health and wellness certifica-
tions, a video introduction, and customer reviews. All 
trainers are vetted to check out their certifications and 
references and are also run through trial sessions to 
see how they do in a streaming-video context. A typical 
customer review consists of something like “Donny was 
punctual, very professional, and prepared. During the 
session he challenged me but kept a close eye to make 
sure I wasn’t overdoing it or messing up my form. He 
was motivational without being cheesy. I plan to book 
another session with him soon.” You can also send di-
rect messages to trainers, to ask questions or to see if 
they can schedule a workout at a time other than what 
they have listed as available. once you enroll you have 
your own profile page that keeps track of your workouts 
and your progress over time. one-on-one classes cost 
between $14 and $25 per workout, depending on how 
many workouts you buy at a time. Group classes, which 
can include up to five people, cost between $7 and $12 
per class. Classes last between 30 and 60 minutes. You 
can select the people you include in your group workout 
(five maximum). As a result, you can participate in the 
same workout as friends or family members regardless 
of where they live.
Wello makes money by taking a percentage of every 
transaction that takes place on its site. The company is 
currently focused on fitness but has plans to extend its

Business idea: Create a device that helps coaches, 
athletic trainers, officials, and parents recognize when an 
athlete has received a blow to the head strong enough 
that it may have caused a concussion.
Pitch: Approximately 
135 
million 
Americans 
play 
organized team sports each year. one of the biggest 
fears of sports participants is receiving a blow to the head 
that results in a concussion. A problem with concussions 
is that unlike a ligament tear or a shoulder sprain, a 
concussion is not always apparent or detectable. As 
a result, athletes often receive a blow to the head and 
continue playing without knowing that they are at risk 
for further injury. When a blow to the head is observed 
by a coach or parent, it is also hard to know if it was 
severe enough to cause concern. Sometimes athletes 
will actually downplay the severity of a blow to the head 
because they don’t want to be removed from a game.
The potential impact of sport-related concussions is 
heart-wrenching. The big fear in an athlete continuing 
to play after suffering a concussion is the possibility of 
experiencing second impact syndrome (SIS), which can 
occur if the athlete sustains a second blow. The second 
blow may be relatively minor and can cause rapid brain 
swelling, respiratory failure, permanent brain damage, 
and possible death. Tragically, athletes less than 18 years 
old are the most susceptible to SIS.

54    PART 1 | DECISIoN To BEComE AN ENTREPRENEUR
Brain Sentry was founded to make it easier to detect 
sports-related concussions. The company makes an un-
obtrusive helmet-mounted device that signals an alert 
when an athlete suffers a rapid and potentially danger-
ous acceleration to the head. The sensor is placed at the 
base of the rear of the helmet. In the event of a big accel-
eration to the head, a bright red LED light illuminates and 
blinks every three seconds. once the sensor flashes a red 
light, the player should be taken off the field and exam-
ined for the possibility of a head injury prior to returning 
to play. If the player is cleared to play, the coach or other 
designated adult simply resets the sensor to turn off the 
blinking light. The sensor keeps track of how many times 
it has been activated. If, within 30 days of the first alert, 
a second big impact is detected, the red light will flash 
quickly twice every three seconds. The sensor detects 
approximately 2 percent of the hardest hits, so it does 
not significantly affect the flow of the game. The sensor 
is light (one ounce), fully sealed, and is waterproof. It runs 
on a battery that doesn’t need to be recharged during 
the course of a regular sports season. The Brain Sentry 
monitor costs approximately $50 per helmet. It has to be 
replaced each season.
Brain Sentry is initially targeting football, hockey, and la-
crosse, the three most popular helmeted sports. It is also 
developing sensors for biking, alpine, and other helmeted 
activities. The company has gained some early traction. 
In 2013, the Louisiana State University football team used 
Brain Sentry–equipped helmets during practices and 
scrimmages, and the Arena Football League is reportedly 
adopting Brain Sentry for all its teams. The Brain Sentry 
device was used by the Newcastle, oklahoma, high 
school football team during the 2013 season.

now used for a variety of purposes, they were orginally 
designed for extreme sports enthusiasts, such as surf-
ers and snow skiers, who wanted to shoot videos of 
their activities. About two inches wide, the cameras look 
like tiny gray boxes. Despite their size, they’re packed 
with amazing capabilities. They can be mounted almost 
anywhere and shoot video that was previously impos-
sible to get. If you’ve never seen what a GoPro camera 
can do, set this case aside for a few minutes and go to 
YouTube on your computer or smartphone. Type in the 
search box “Flying eagle point of view #1.” The video 
was shot by a GoPro camera mounted on the back 
of an eagle. You get to see what the eagle sees flying 
through a beautiful mountain canyon. The video has 
been viewed almost 8 million times.
GoPro (technically Woodman Labs) is an enor-
mously successful company. Currently, the firm is gener-
ating over $500 million in annual sales, and its cameras 
have become the gold standard for self-documenting 
extreme sports experiences. But it wasn’t always this 
way. GoPro started with a single entrepreneur, working 
out of his parent’s house, who was passionate about 
a specific idea. It’s a good story—one from which any 
student of entrepreneurship can learn and find take-
aways that they can apply to their own start-up idea.
nick Woodman
GoPro was started by Nick Woodman, who gew up in 
northern California. In high school, he played football 
and baseball before becoming infatuated with surfing. 
For college, he picked the University of California, San 
Diego, because of its proximity to the beach. Woodman 
knew early on that he wanted to be an entrepreneur. 
Before starting GoPro, he had two start-ups, both of 
which failed. The first, a website called EmpowerAll.
com, tried to sell electronic products for no more than 
a $2 markup. It barely got off the ground. The second 
start-up, Funbug, was a game and marketing platform 
that gave users the chance to win cash prizes. It was 
launched in 1999, the height of the dot-com bubble, 
and raised $3.9 million in funding. The company failed 
a year later, never having gained traction.
Woodman was shaken by the failure of Funbug, 
and he decided to take some time off. He traveled to 
Australia and Indonesia to surf, thinking that when he 
returned he would find a normal job. It was in Australia 
that the idea for GoPro first emerged. Woodman had 
brought a makeshift strap that he used to tether a Kodak 
disposable camera to his wrist so he could photograph

himself and others surfing. It didn’t work well. What he 
needed was a strap that was durable enough to take the 
wear and tear of ocean waves, and still be comfortable 
enough to wear. Woodman experimented with differ-
ent strap designs during the trip. When he returned to 
California, he decided to pursue the idea of designing a 
wrist strap for cameras full time. Years later, reflecting on 
the trip, Woodman told Forbes magazine, “I remember 
my parents not being very supportive of it (the trip). But 
if I (hadn’t) followed my passion for surfing … I would 
have never come up with the concept to make a wrist 
camera.”
Protoyping and First Sale
Woodman moved into his parents’ house and started 
building prototypes. He was determined to bootstrap his 
start-up this time, still smarting from losing $3.9 million 
of his investors’ money on Funbug. To support himself, 
he made money traveling up and down the California 
coast selling bead-and-shell belts he bought in Indonesia 
for $2.50 and was able to sell in California for as much 
as $60. Using an improvised set of tools and his mom’s 
sewing machine, he gained confidence that he could 
make a strap that was better than anything currently 
available for tethering a camera to a surfer’s wrist. His 
thinking evolved to selling not only the strap, but a com-
bination of the strap, a camera, and casings (to protect 
the camera from water and other debris). After borrow-
ing money from his parents, he moved to a cottage in 
the redwood forest near Pesadero, California, where he 
worked nonstop testing fabrics, designing marketing ma-
terials, and writing patent applications. Getting the strap 
right wasn’t an easy task. He needed to find the perfect 
tightness and perfect fabric, so it didn’t make you sweat, 
didn’t make you sore, and wouldn’t break down in water. 
He had no expertise in camera design, so knew he’d 
have to license a camera from an existing manufacturer. 
He settled on an inexpensive 35-millimeter model made 
in China. He finally had what he wanted—a camera, cas-
ings, and a durable and comfortable strap. He decided 
to call the combination GoPro.
To test the market for his product, Woodman and 
his roommate and first hire, Neil Dana, hit the trade show 
circuit. The moment start-up founders dream about hap-
pened at the first show, which turned out to be the 2004 
Action Sports Retailer show in San Diego. GoPro got its 
first order for 100 units from a Japanese distributor.
Growth Years
GoPro grossed $350,000 its first year. Woodman and 
Dana visited surf shops across the country trying to 
convince them to carry the product. In 2005, Woodman 
appeared on QVC three times. GoPro slowly built 
momentum. Woodman also didn’t stop innovating. 
Along with surfing, Woodman had an interest in race 
car driving. He treated himself to driving lessons at 
Infineon Raceway in Sonoma, California. on a hunch, he 
strapped a GoPro wrist cam to the car’s roll bar, which is 
in front of the driver. That led to an inspirational moment. 
GoPro would make mounts for its cameras so people 
could point them back at themselves.
Woodman also broadened his vision and started 
attending trade shows in all the action sports and con-
sumer electronics markets. By this time, GoPro was 
manufacturing its own cameras. Although GoPro was 
getting into surf shops and sportings goods stores, it 
hadn’t yet penetrated a major retailer. Woodman started 
engaging executives at REI, an outdoors and sporting 
goods chain. At one point, he was sending them an e-
mail once a month updating them on GoPro’s activities. 
Eventually, GoPro broke into REI and Dick’s Sportings 
Goods. In 2010, GoPro’s big break happened. After

reaching out to Best Buy repeatedly with no luck, Best 
Buy approached GoPro. After beating sales targets in 
several test stores, GoPro’s cameras were placed in all 
Best Buy locations. GoPro also got a little lucky. The 
Flip camera was a big seller for Best Buy, but its appeal 
evaporated when smartphones obtained video capabil-
ity. In 2011, the Flip camera was pulled from Best Buy’s 
shelves. That left a void in Best Buy’s camera line that 
GoPro was able to fill.
As is the case for most start-up ventures, GoPro 
has had some scary moments. In 2007, revenue was in 
the low seven figures and Woodman was concerned. 
He wondered if GoPro would grow beyond its extreme 
sports niche, and considered turning the company 
over to a group of outside investors. The financial crisis 
of 2008 prevented that from happening, and GoPro 
moved on.
The influence of Social media
A fascinating part of the GoPro story is the influ-
ence of social media on the firm’s success. From the 
beginning, extreme sports enthusiasts who bought 
GoPro cameras posted their videos. many went viral 
and posted millions of views. This situation created 
the best possible scenario for GoPro. Its brand was 
being promoted not by the firm itself, but by its us-
ers. Piggybacking on its users’ appetite for stunning 
videos, GoPro sponsored several well-known extreme 
sports athletes, including American skateboarder and 
snowboarder Shaun White. For a fun experience, go 
to YouTube and type in “Shaun White GoPro.” There 
will be several videos. You can see exactly what Shaun 
White sees when he tackles an X Games halfpipe 
or a particularly difficult run, all captured by helmet-
mounted GoPro cameras. GoPro is also a little edgy in 
its sponsorships. When Felix Baumgartner set a sky-
diving record by jumping from the edge of space, he 
wore five GoPro cameras on the way down.
To GoPro’s credit, in part it has made its own luck 
when it comes to social media. Its $300 cameras pro-
duce video that rivals that of professionally created 
content, so it’s fun to shoot and post. For instance, 
Woodman and his team knew that to produce truly sat-
isfying video the sound quality would have to be good. 
Viewers would want to hear, for example, a snowboard 
crunching through snow to get the full impact of a 
thrilling descent. Wind noise rushing into a camera’s 
microphone is a problem in this type of setting and can 
easily drown out everything else. By riding bikes that are 
nearly silent, Woodman and his engineers were able to 
record almost pure wind noise in a natural environment. 
They then developed firmware that isolates the sound 
of wind and eliminates distracting sound from GoPro 
recordings.
As a result of all of this, GoPro says it has over 222 
million views on its YouTube channel and 4.7 million 
likes on Facebook.
The Road Ahead
Not everyone is widely optimistic about GoPro’s future. 
maintaining its momentum may be tough. major brands 
such as Sony, Coleman, and Swann have started sell-
ing sports cameras that are similar to GoPro’s. other 
tech heavyweights, such as Apple and Google, are 
working on wearable devices with video and photo 
capabilities. The wildcard is smartphones, and how 
good their video capabilities will eventually become. If 
a smartphone will eventually be able to do everything 
that a GoPro camera is able to do, that doesn’t project 
a bright future for GoPro, at least in its current form.
GoPro, of course, is aware of these challenges. In 
may 2011, Woodman broke his vow to never take out-
side funding and raised $88 million in a series A round. 
The round involved several venture capital firms, some 
with deep ties in the entertainment and technology 
industries. Woodman says that the momey was raised 
in part to build an experienced board of directors to 
help GoPro navigate the future. As for the money it-
self, Woodman has remained mum about how it will be 
used. That causes one to speculate that GoPro may 
have future generations of products in its pipeline.

CHAPTER 1 | INTRoDUCTIoN To ENTREPRENEURSHIP    57
introduction
It’s a sad yet heartwarming story. In 1998, Stephen 
Heywood, a strong 28-year-old carpenter who was 
building his dream house in California, got the worst 
possible news. He was diagnosed with amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis (ALS), or Lou Gehrig’s disease. His 
brothers, Jamie and Ben, stood by his side as he 
 doggedly fought his disease and pursued a cure. 
Stephen eventually succumbed to ALS, but his coura-
geous journey will always be remembered through an 
autobiographical movie, So Much So Fast, and a book, 
His Brother’s Keeper, by Pulitzer Prize–winning author 
Jonathan Weiner.
Helping Stephen deal with the day-to-day chal-
lenges of his disease and experiencing firsthand the 
decisions that have to be made and the lack of in-
formation that’s often available profoundly changed 
the direction of Jamie and Ben Heywood’s lives. In 
1999, Jamie Haywood launched an organization called 
the ALS Therapy Development Foundation, to help 
Stephen and others fight ALS. Today, it remains well 
funded and staffed and supports a number of research 
efforts. In 2005, Jamie and his brother Ben took an 
additional step and launched PatientsLikeme, a Web-
based company that allows people with life-changing 
diseases to converse with one another, share their ex-
periences, and learn techniques from each other that 
help them better cope with their diseases.
Since its launch, PatientsLikeme has achieved re-
markable success. Any patient with any medical con-
dition can join the site. As a result, the company now 
has hundreds of thousands of patients sharing their 
experiences with respect to over 500 conditions. At 
the heart of PatientsLikeme’s success is a truly unique 
value proposition—a platform that encourages pa-
tients to interact in ways that are very meaningful for 
them. PatientsLikeme is also a bold company, in that 
one of its goals is to change the way that the medi-
cal industry thinks about patients and patient care. 
To facilitate that goal, PatientsLikeme is working with, 
rather than against, the medical industry. In fact, its 
primary revenue driver is to sell aggregated data that it 
collects from its online patient communities to medical 
companies to enable them to factor the “voice of the 
patient” into all aspects of their product decisions.
value Proposition
PatientsLikeme’s value proposition is the opposite of 
what you might expect, in that conventional thinking is 
that a person’s medical information is private and should 
be kept confined to a tight circle of family and health 
care providers. PatientsLikeme advocates that people 
openly share their experiences to help others. It’s inspi-
rational in that most of its members have illnesses that 
consume a great deal of their own time and energy, yet 
are willing to expend time and effort to share information 
to improve the lives of others.
Here’s how it works. Say someone you care about 
has been diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease, a neu-
rological disorder. on PatientsLikeme, that person will 
be able to interact with people who have been  living 
with Parkinson’s disease for 3 years, 5 years, 10 years, 
or more. Your friend or loved one will be able to ask, 
“What’s it like after 3 years? What will I be able to do 
and not do? What’s the scariest part of the disease?” 
Your friend or loved one will also be able to ask the 
number-one question that people with diseases have, 
which is: “Given my status, what’s the best outcome I 
can hope for and how can I get there?” This question 
will be answered by someone who has the disease and 
who truly understands all the emotions and fears rather 
than being answered by a medical professional.
PatientsLikeme’s service is unique in that it not 
only facilitates these types of interactions but also 
collects detailed information from its members about 
the symptoms they’re experiencing, medications 
they’re on, and how their diseases are affecting their 
lives. It then displays this data in aggregate form for 
its members and others to see. It also drills deeper. It 
allows patients to share the experiences they’re hav-
ing with a particular drug, for example, including how 
long they’ve been on the drug, what the side effects 
have been, whether they feel the drug has been ef-
fective, and so forth. This is information that people 
who have just been prescribed a drug are anxious 
to see. members can also interact directly with each 
other regarding their experiences. For example, 
Carbidopa-Levodopa is a drug commonly prescribed 
to Parkinson’s disease patients. Someone named 
“mary o.” may have reported on her profile that “When 
I first started taking Carbidopa-Levodopa it made me

sleepy, but over time my body adjusted and I no longer 
have that side effect.” If you’ve just been prescribed 
Carbidopa-Levodopa, you can send a message to 
mary o. and ask her, “How sleepy did you get? Was it 
so bad you couldn’t go to work? How long did it take 
before your body adjusted? Did you try caffeine? Did 
it help?” mary o. would then respond and answer the 
questions. In addition, as a result of this exchange, you 
and mary o. may start to regularly correspond, and 
mary o. may become for you an important source of 
information and support.
What’s remarkable about PatientsLikeme’s value 
proposition is that the information its members ex-
change and the manner in which it aggregates and 
displays data aren’t available anywhere else. The 
degree to which its members are willing to be trans-
parent about very personal health-related issues is 
also compelling. Along with maintaining its website 
and member communities, PatientsLikeme has also 
become an authoritative voice in the medical commu-
nity. It has published over 30 peer-reviewed research 
studies. In 2013, PatientsLikeme’s vice president for 
advocacy, Sally okun, made a highly visible presenta-
tion at TEDmED about the idea of building a “patient 
lexicon” to make it as easy for patients to talk about 
their conditions and compare notes as it is for doc-
tors. The eight-minute talk titled “Does Anyone in 
Healthcare Want to Be Understood?” is available at 
www.tedmed.com. Simply type “Sally okun” into the 
search bar.
Revenue Driver
Although its services are free to users, PatientsLikeme 
is a for-profit entrepreneurial venture. The company 
makes money by aggregating the information its mem-
bers share and selling it to its partners. Its partners 
include members of the medical community such as 
drug companies, medical-device companies, insurance 
companies, and health care providers. For example, 
the aggregate data of how patients with Parkinson’s 
disease are reacting to a particular medication would 
be of interest to the company that makes that medi-
cation. The sharing of this information then circles 
back and helps patients. For example, if the maker 
of the Parkinson’s drug finds that a large percentage 
of people who take the drug experience fatigue, the 
drug can potentially be tweaked to remedy that issue. 
For patients, not experiencing fatigue as a side effect 
of the drug may not only translate into feeling better, 
but may mean fewer days missed from work or even 
the ability to maintain a job rather than having to quit. 
Because of these types of outcomes, most patients are 
eager to have their personal data included in larger da-
tabases and passed along to companies in the medi-
cal industry. Finally, their experiences and their voices 
become part of the data that medical companies study 
when making decisions about patients and their care. 
PatientsLikeme is very transparent about the fact that 
it sells its patients’ data, and it sees the sharing of 
data as integral to its mission. It does not share or sell 
personally identifiable information without the explicit 
consent of the member.
There are no ads or sponsorships on 
PatientsLikeme’s website. The company’s sole inten-
tion is to align the interests of its members with the 
medical community.
challenges Ahead
PatientsLikeme is expanding its reach. While its site 
originally focused exclusively on life-threatening dis-
eases, it now supports communities that focus on 
issues such as infertility (for both men and women), 
mood conditions (including depression), and hear-
ing loss. Rapid growth is a challenge for all firms, and 
PatientsLikeme is in a rapid-growth phase. In fact, at 
the time this case was written, PatientsLikeme was 
supporting communities for more than 500 conditions.
There are also several worries that surround a 
service such as PatientsLikeme. The company openly 
acknowledges these worries but believes the benefits 
outweigh the risks. one worry is that some employ-
ers may not want to employ people with a high-cost 
or high-risk disease. Again, it’s possible that some 
people may reveal the existence of a disease on their 
PatientsLikeme profiles that may jeopardize current or 
future employment opportunities. Another worry is the 
unknowns about changes to health care policies and 
the overall health care system in the United States as a 
result of the passage of the Affordable Care Act. How 
changes brought about by that act will affect how infor-
mation about patients is distributed and to whom is still 
not entirely clear.
For now, PatientsLikeme is aggressively moving 
forward. The company’s overarching goal, along with 
providing the value it currently provides, is to shift the 
thinking of companies in the medical industry by provid-
ing them access to data they never had before. By bet-
ter knowing the journey that patients are on, the hope is 
that the medical community will increasingly go beyond 
treating their patients’ core diseases and create prod-
ucts that will impact all aspects—physical, social, and 
mental—of their lives.

n mid-2009, AJ Forsythe had a problem. While a student at California-Poly San Luis 
Obispo, he broke his iPhone twice within two days. The first time occurred when he 
was exiting his car. He dropped his iPhone and cracked the screen. That accident 
cost him $200 and an hour’s trip to the Apple store. A few days later 
the same phone broke again, when his roommate casually tossed it 
to him and it hit a ceiling fan. Determined to fix the phone himself this 
time, Forsythe got help from some engineering students and used a 
small screwdriver and dental pick to replace the phone’s shattered 
screen. Incredibly, shortly after these two incidents, Forsythe’s room-
mate broke his iPhone. At that point, Forsythe realized that repairing 
iPhones was a promising idea for pursuing a business opportunity.
To start, Forsythe gave a friend $20 to design a flyer, and began 
putting the flyers up around campus. Within two weeks, he had his 
first customer. Forsythe set up a Facebook page and a Twitter account 
to generate additional awareness and sales, and the business—which 
he named iCracked—started to take shape. Profit margins were good. 
At $75 a phone, Forsythe was making about $40 for less than an 
hour’s work.
From the outset, Forsythe saw iCracked as a business that could 
be replicated on other college campuses. He spent the summer of 
2010 in Dallas, his hometown, pitching the idea to local campuses. 
Forsythe brought on a partner in the fall of 2010, Anthony Martin. The two met through 
a mutual friend. Martin’s best friend in high school was Forsythe’s best friend in college. 
At the time, Martin was running a textbook exchange platform at UC Santa Barbara. 
Martin and Forsythe were both college entrepreneurs and enjoyed talking to each other 
about business. Martin liked the opportunity Forsythe was pursuing, particularly given 
Apple’s growing market share in the smartphone industry. Martin put the first invest-
ment into iCracked to buy inventory and set up a website. The two began putting job 
listings on college campuses across the United States. Within 30 days, they had their 
first website up and 23 repair technicians on college campuses across the country. 
They called their repair technicians “iTechs.” In the nearby photo, Anthony Martin ap-

Since that time, iCracked has continued to expand, and the company now has 
over 500 iTechs spread over most of the United States and eight foreign countries. 
Initially, a customer would be put in touch with an iTech technician, and they agree 
on a place to meet. Starting in late 2013, the service improved, and the iTechs now 
travel directly to the customer. They repair broken screens, LCDs, bad batteries and 
all other small parts problems, as well as water damage for Apple iPhone, iPad, and 
iPod models. As long as the logic board is intact, which it usually is, the repair can 
be made. The repairs typically take between 10 and 30 minutes and cost between 
$70 and $170. They also purchase used iPhone, iPad, and iPod devices. The iTechs 
aren’t full-time employees of iCracked. The firm makes money by selling parts to the 
iTechs and connecting them to customers. iCracked is extremely diligent about who 
becomes an iTech. Every applicant is subject to a five-step interview process and a 
background check. Thousands apply, but only 2 percent of applicants are accepted. 
The firm adds 50-70 new iTechs each month. Over time, iCracked technicians have 
seen all manner of iPhone catastrophes, from pet pigs stomping on them, to iPhones 
being run over by trucks, to phones falling out of the hands of skydivers. Often badly 
damaged, the phones can usually be repaired and restored. Offering insurance on 
iPhones is a new product line iCracked is considering. The insurance is expected 
to cost around $6 a month, with a $20 deductible. For people in areas where iTech 
technicians aren’t yet available, iCracked offers the option of sending the broken 
phone to the company’s headquarters, where it will be fixed and sent back the same 
day. iCracked also continues to sell its do-it-yourself iPhone Screen Repair Kit.
iCracked believes it is just getting started. The company had sales of around 
$2 million in 2012 and $10 million in 2013. It sees additional opportunities in its core 
business and in other areas. In regard to its core business, it’s estimated that within 
the next five years, there will be five billion smartphones in the world. About 30 percent 
of smartphones are damaged and at some point need repairs. iCracked has already 
positioned itself as the world’s largest and most efficient iPhone repair and buyback 
service. It plans to soon extend its service to Android-equipped phones. As a result, 
iCracked is positioned to dramatically increase its revenue in smartphone repairs, buy-
backs, and additional services. Its smartphone insurance service is also expected to 
significantly add to the firm’s sales revenue.
In regard to other areas, in early 2012, Forsythe and Martin were admitted to Y 
Combinator, based on the strength of their company’s early traction. Y Combinator is a 
business accelerator that provides seed money, mentoring and connections to promis-
ing technology startups. The three-month Y Combinator experience challenged Forsythe 
and Martin to see iCracked in a new light and as a much bigger potential opportunity. 
Forsythe and Martin believe their network of iTech technicians is the company’s most 
valuable asset. They foresee the technicians eventually providing repairs, installations, 
and additional service across a variety of industries for a wide range of clientele.
I
n this chapter, we discuss the importance of understanding the difference 
between ideas and opportunities. While ideas are interesting and can intrigue 
us as possibilities, not every idea is in fact the source of an opportunity for an 
entrepreneur to pursue. In addition to describing the differences between ideas 
and opportunities, this chapter also discusses approaches entrepreneurs use 
to spot opportunities, as well as factors or conditions in the external environ-
ment that may result in opportunities. As you will see, too, certain character-
istics seem to be associated with individuals who are adept at spotting viable 
business opportunities.

CHAPTER 2 | RECOgnIzIng OppOrtunities AnD gEnERATIng IDEAS    65
the differences between Opportunities  
and ideas
Essentially, entrepreneurs recognize an opportunity and turn it into a success-
ful business.1 An opportunity is a favorable set of circumstances that creates 
a need for a new product, service, or business. Most entrepreneurial ventures 
are started in one of two ways. Some ventures are externally stimulated. In this 
instance, an entrepreneur decides to launch a firm, searches for and recognizes 
an opportunity, and then starts a business, as Jeff Bezos did when he created 
Amazon.com. In 1994, Bezos quit his lucrative job at a New York City invest-
ment firm and headed for Seattle with a plan to find an attractive opportunity 
and launch an e-commerce company. Other firms are internally stimulated, 
like iCracked. An entrepreneur recognizes a problem or an opportunity gap 
and creates a business to address the problem or fill the identified gap.
Regardless of which of these two ways an entrepreneur starts a new busi-
ness, opportunities are tough to spot. Identifying a product, service, or busi-
ness opportunity that isn’t merely a different version of something already 
available is difficult. A common mistake entrepreneurs make in the oppor-
tunity recognition process is picking a currently available product or service 
that they like or are passionate about and then trying to build a business 
around a slightly better version of it. Although this approach seems sensible, 
such is usually not the case. The key to opportunity recognition is to identify 
a product or service that people need and are willing to buy, not one that an 
entrepreneur wants to make and sell.
As shown in Figure 2.1, an opportunity has four essential qualities: It is 
(1) attractive, (2) timely, (3) durable, and (4) anchored in a product, service, 
or business that creates or adds value for its buyer or end-user. For an en-
trepreneur to capitalize on an opportunity, its window of opportunity must 
be open. The term window of opportunity is a metaphor describing the time 
period in which a firm can realistically enter a new market. Once the mar-
ket for a new product is established, its window of opportunity opens. As the 
market grows, firms enter and try to establish a profitable position. At some 
point, the market matures, and the window of opportunity closes. This is the 
case with Internet search engines. Yahoo, the first search engine, appeared 
in 1995, and the market grew quickly, with the addition of Lycos, Excite, and 
several others. Google entered the market in 1998, sporting advanced search 
technology. Since then, the search engine market has matured, and the win-
dow of opportunity is less prominent. Today, it would be very difficult for a 
new start-up search engine firm to be successful unless it offered compelling

advantages over already established competitors or targeted a niche market in 
an exemplary manner. Bing, Microsoft’s search engine, is gaining ground with 
approximately 18 percent market share (compared to 67 percent for Google), 
but only after Microsoft has exerted an enormous amount of effort in head-to-
head competition with Google.2
It is important to understand that there is a difference between an op-
portunity and an idea. An idea is a thought, an impression, or a notion. An 
idea may or may not meet the criteria of an opportunity. This is a critical point 
because many entrepreneurial ventures fail not because the entrepreneurs 
that launched them didn’t work hard, but rather because there was no real 
opportunity to begin with. Before getting excited about a business idea, it is 
crucial to understand whether the idea fills a need and meets the criteria for 
an opportunity.
three Ways to identify Opportunities
There are three approaches entrepreneurs use to identify an opportunity their 
new venture can choose to pursue (see Figure 2.2). Once an entrepreneur un-
derstands the importance of each approach, s/he will be much more likely to 
look for opportunities and ideas that fit each profile. We discuss the three ap-
proaches in the next three sections.
observing trends
The first approach to identifying opportunities is to observe trends and study 
how they create opportunities for entrepreneurs to pursue. The most impor-
tant trends to follow are economic trends, social trends, technological ad-
vances, and political action and regulatory changes. As an entrepreneur or 
potential entrepreneur, it’s important to remain aware of changes in these 
areas. This sentiment is affirmed by Michael Yang, the founder of Become.com, 
a comparison shopping site, who believes that keen observation skills and a 
willingness to stay on top of changing environmental trends are key attributes 
of successful entrepreneurs:
One of the most important attributes of a good entrepreneur is having a keen 
observation ability. Basically seeing what’s needed in people’s everyday lives and 
coming up with innovative new ideas and services that meet those needs … I al-
ways believe the entrepreneurs that anticipate trends and maintain observations 
of what’s needed … to solve those needs will have a higher chance of succeeding 
in the marketplace.3
When looking at environmental trends to discern new business ideas, there 
are two caveats to keep in mind. First, it’s important to distinguish between 
trends and fads. New businesses typically do not have the resources to ramp up 
fast enough to take advantage of a fad. Second, even though we discuss each 
trend individually, they are interconnected and should be considered simulta-
neously when brainstorming new business ideas. For example, one reason that 
smartphones are so popular is because they benefit from several trends con-
verging at the same time, including an increasingly mobile population (social 
trend), the continual miniaturization of electronics (technological trend), and 
learning ObjeCtive

their ability to help users better manage their money via online banking and 
comparison shopping (economic trend). If any of these trends weren’t present, 
smartphones wouldn’t be as successful as they are and wouldn’t hold as much 
continuing promise to be even more successful in the future.
Figure 2.3 provides a summary of the relationship between the environ-
mental factors just mentioned and identifying opportunity gaps. Next, let’s 
look at how entrepreneurs can study each of these factors to help them spot 
business, product, and service opportunity gaps.

the economy is strong, people have more money to spend and are willing to buy 
discretionary products and services that enhance their lives. In contrast, when 
the economy is weak, not only do people have less money to spend, they are 
typically more reluctant to spend the money they have, fearing the economy 
may become even worse, and that in turn, they might lose their jobs because 
of a weakening economy. Paradoxically, a weak economy provides business 
opportunities for start-ups that help consumers and businesses save money. 
Examples include GasBuddy and GasPriceWatch.com, two companies started 
to help consumers save money on gasoline. A similar example is WaterSmart 
Software, a 2009 start-up. WaterSmart Software sells software to water utili-
ties that makes it easier for their customers to save water and money.
When studying how economic forces affect business opportunities, it is 
important to evaluate who has money to spend and what they spend it on. 
For example, an increase in the number of women in the workforce and their 
related increase in disposable income is largely responsible for the number 
of online retailers and boutique clothing stores targeting professional women 
that have opened the past several years. Similarly, the increased buying power 
of minority populations has resulted in an upswing of ethnic restaurants and 
ethnic supermarkets in the United States. Baby boomers are another potential 
group to examine. These individuals, who were born between 1946 and 1964, 
are retiring in large numbers and will be retiring in even larger numbers over 
the next five years or so. The expectation is that these people will redirect a 
sizeable portion of their assets to products and services that facilitate their 
retirement. This trend will invariably spawn new businesses in many areas, 
largely because baby boomers have greater disposable income relative to previ-
ous generations. For example, baby boomers tend to take pride in their homes 
and lawns. Recent data indicates that baby boomers who own homes are 21 
percent more likely than all American adults to have spent $10,000 or more on 
home improvements.5 Other areas that baby boomers spend heavily on include 
health care, travel, and consumer packaged goods. The high cost of energy, 
coupled with a desire to be socially responsible, has also spawned a growing 
number of startups that are developing products and services that help busi-
ness and consumers become more energy efficient. An example is Nest Labs 
(www.nest.com), a 2010 startup. Nest Labs—which was acquired by Google in 
2014—makes the world’s first learning thermostat. The thermostat, which can 
be used in homes or businesses, learns from your temperature adjustments 
and programs itself to optimize a building’s comfort and energy efficiency.6
An understanding of economic trends also helps identify areas to avoid. 
For example, a decision to launch a company that sells products or services to 
public schools was not a wise one during the recent economic downturn. In the 
United States—and other countries, as well—public schools have been hit hard 
by budget cuts from governmental funding agencies. The cuts have significantly 
reduced the ability of schools to purchase new products and services.
Social Forces  An understanding of the impact of social forces on trends 
and how they affect new product, service, and business ideas is a fundamental 
piece of the opportunity recognition puzzle. Often, the reason that a product or 
service exists has more to do with satisfying a social need than the more trans-
parent need the product fills. The proliferation of fast-food restaurants, for ex-
ample, isn’t primarily because of people’s love of fast food, but rather because 
of the fact that people are busy and often don’t have time to cook their own 
meals. Similarly, social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram 
aren’t popular because they can be used to post information and photos on a 
website. They’re popular because they allow people to connect and communi-
cate with each other, which is a natural human tendency.
Changes in social trends alter how people and businesses behave and how 
they set their priorities. These changes affect how products and services are 

CHAPTER 2 | RECOgnIzIng OppOrtunities AnD gEnERATIng IDEAS    69
built and sold. Here is a sample of the social trends that are currently affecting 
how individuals behave and set their priorities:
■ Aging of the population
■ The increasing diversity of the workforce
■ Increased participation in social networks
■ Growth in the use of mobile devices
■ An increasing focus on health and wellness
■ Emphasis on clean forms of energy, including wind, solar, biofuels, 
and others
■ Continual migration of people from small towns and rural areas to cities
■ Desire for personalization (which creates a need for products and services 
that people can tailor to their own tastes and needs)
Each of these trends is providing the impetus for new business ideas. The 
continual migration of people from small towns and rural areas to cities, for 
example, is creating more congestion in cities. Businesses like Zipcar, a car-
sharing service, and Alta Bicycle Share, a bicycle-sharing service, were started 
in part to address this problem. Similarly, the aging of the population is creat-
ing business opportunities from vision care to home health care to senior dating 
sites. An example is Glaukos, a company that’s developing a new approach for 
treating glaucoma, which is an age-related eye disorder.
The proliferation of smartphones is a social trend that’s opening business 
opportunities for entrepreneurs across the globe. More than 1.75  billion peo-
ple worldwide owned mobile phones in 2014, and that number is expected 
grow to 2.5 billion by 2017. By 2017, nearly 50 percent of mobile phones 
will be smartphones, like the Apple iPhone and Android-equipped devices. 
The proliferation of smartphones will spawn new businesses both in the 
United States and throughout the world. Sometimes social trends converge 
to create a particuarly compelling business idea. For example, CareZone, 
a 2012 startup, was launched by Johathan Schwartz, who was looking for 
ways to better manage the care of five aging parents and in-laws. CareZone 
is an app for smartphones, tablets, or computers that allows those involved 
in a person’s care to share and save information in a secure, online setting. 
CareZone’s potential is bolstered by two societal trends: the aging of the 
population and the growth in the use of smartphone apps and other con-
nected devices.
The increasing interest in social networking sites such as Facebook, 
Twitter, and LinkedIn is a highly visible social trend. A total of 69 percent of 
men and 78 percent of women use one or more social networking sites.7 In 
addition to providing people new ways to communicate and interact with each 
other, social networks also act as platforms for other businesses to build on. 
Zynga, for example, the maker of popular online games like FarmVille and 
Scramble, became popular by making browser-based games that worked as 
application widgets on Facebook. Similarly, entrepreneurs have launched 
businesses for the purpose of starting social networks that cater to specific 
niches. An example is PatientsLikeMe, the subject of Case 1.2, which is a so-
cial networking site for people with serious diseases.
Technological Advances  Advances in technology frequently dovetail 
with economic and social changes to create opportunities. For example, there 
are many overlaps between an increased focus on health and wellness and 
technology. Wearable devices, like the Fitbit Flex and the Jawbone Up, help 
people maintain a healthy lifestyle by monitoring their movements and sleep. 
In fact, ABI Research projects that 90 million wearable computing devices will 

70    PART 2 | DEvELOPIng SUCCESSFUL BUSInESS IDEAS
be shipped in 2014.8 There are a growing number of mobile apps and activity 
trackers that beam the data they collect to their health care providers so they 
can keep tabs on their activities and inform treatments. Insurance companies 
and corporations are increasingly partnering with technology companies like 
RedBrick Health and Audax Health, which establish programs to help encour-
age healthy lifestyles.
Technological advances also provide opportunities to help people perform 
everyday tasks in better or more convenient ways. For example, OpenTable.
com is a website that allows users to make restaurant reservations online and 
now covers most of the United States. If you’re planning a trip to Boston, for 
example, you can access OpenTable.com, select the area of the city you’ll be 
visiting, and view descriptions, reviews, customer ratings, and in most cases 
the menus of the restaurants in the area. You can then make a reservation at 
the restaurant and print a map and the directions to it. The basic tasks that 
OpenTable.com helps people perform have always been done: looking for a 
restaurant, comparing prices and menus, soliciting advice from people who are 
familiar with competing restaurants, and getting directions. What OpenTable.
com does is help people perform these tasks in a more convenient and expedi-
ent manner.
Another aspect of technological advances is that once a technology is cre-
ated, products often emerge to advance it. For example, the creation of the 
Apple iPod, iPhone, iPad, and similar devices has in turned spawned entire 
industries that produce compatible devices. For example, Rokit is a high-end 
mobile accessories company that makes smartphone cases, headphones, 
portable USB device chargers and Bluetooth speakers. Rokit wouldn’t exist 
if it weren’t for the advent of the smartphone industry. Similarly, there are 
a growing number of start-ups working on smartphone apps. An example is 
Ubersense, the subject of the You Be the VC 5.2 feature. Ubersense has made 
a smartphone and tablet app that allows athletes, coaches, and parents to 
shoot video of an athlete’s move or competition, and then analyze the video in 
a variety of ways.
Political Action and regulatory Changes  Political and regulatory 
changes also provide the basis for business ideas. For example, new laws often 
spur start-ups that are launched to take advantage of their specifications. This 
is currently happening as a result of the passage of the Affordable Care Act 
(Obamacare). The combination of new regulations, incentitives for doctors and 
hospitals to shift to electronic records, and the release of mountains of data held 
by the Department of Health and Human Services (on topics such as hospital 
quality and nursing home patient satisfaction), is motivating entrepreneurs to 
launch electronic medical records start-ups, apps to help patients monitor their 
medications, and similar companies.9
On some occassions, entire industries hinge on whether certain govern-
ment regulations evolve in a manner that is favorable to the industry. For ex-
ample, there are several start-ups poised to commercialize the use of drones, 
or Aerial UAV’s. Drones can be used for a number of domestic purposes, such 
as helping farmers determine the optimal level of fertilizer to place on crops 
or helping filmmakers shoot overhead scenes. Amazon.com created quite a bit 
of buzz in late 2013 when it suggested it would like to use drones for package 
delivery. As of spring 2014, the FAA permitted drones to be used for personal 
use, and restricted their use to below 400 feet, within eyesight of the control-
ler and away from airports and populated areas. Drone start-ups, like 3D 
Robotics, are waiting for the FAA to develop more liberal rules and standards 
that will allow drones to be used for expanded purposes.10
Political change also engenders new business and product opportuni-
ties. For example, global political instability and the threat of terrorism have 

CHAPTER 2 | RECOgnIzIng OppOrtunities AnD gEnERATIng IDEAS    71
resulted in many firms becoming more security-conscious. These companies 
need new products and services to protect their physical assets and intel-
lectual property, as well as to protect their customers and employees. The 
backup data storage industry, for example, is expanding because of this new 
trend in the tendency to feel the need for data to be more protected than in 
the past. An example of a start-up in this area is Box.net, which was funded 
by Mark Cuban, the owner of the Dallas Mavericks. Box.net allows its cus-
tomers to store data “offsite” on Box.net servers, and access it via any Internet 
connection.
Table 2.1 offers additional examples of changes in environmental trends 
that provided fertile soil for opportunities and subsequent concepts to take 
advantage of them.
One thing entrepreneurs invarably do when a changing environmen-
tal trend prompts them to think about a business opportunity is to learn 
more about the trend in an effort to shape and mold their idea. The “Savvy 
Entrepreneurial Firm” feature in this chapter focuses on how to learn more 
about specific environmental trends through the effective use of social media.

solving a problem
The second approach to identifying opportunities is to recognize problems 
and find ways to solve them. Problems can be recognized by observing the 
challenges that people encounter in their daily lives and through more simple 
means, such as intuition, serendipity, or chance. There are many problems 
O
ften, as a result of a changing environmental trend, 
individuals have the seeds of a business idea, but 
need to know more about the trend before their 
idea can fully take shape. For example, one environmen-
tal trend, the continual migration of people from small 
towns and rural areas to cities, has resulted in cities 
becoming more congested. To help relieve congestion, 
many large cities are implementing bike-sharing pro-
grams. The programs typically allow a person to pick 
up a bike at Point A and then drop it off at Point B. The 
idea is that if someone has a short commute to work, or 
plans to make a short trip, s/he might opt to ride a bike 
rather than drive their car. The fewer cars there are on 
the street, the less congestion there will be.
Say you had the idea to start a for-profit company to 
manage bike-sharing programs for mid-sized cities. This 
potentially could be a viable idea, given that to date, most 
of the programs are in large cities. A mid-sized city would 
be a city like Tulsa, OK, or Little Rock, AR. You have the 
idea, but you now need to learn as much as you can about 
the migration of people from small towns and rural areas to 
cities, as well as how bike-sharing programs work. You’re 
just in the idea stage here, collecting information and 
looking for insights. Many people try to use social media 
to learn about emerging trends, but go about it in a hap-
hazard manner. Here are some suggestions for effectively 
using social media to study environmental trends and 
business ideas associated with those trends.
■ Facebook groups. Look for Facebook groups 
that pertain to the topics in which you have an 
interest. You can find Facebook groups by simply 
accessing Facebook’s main page and typing the 
appropriate keywords in the search bar. Once 
you start typing for a term like “bike sharing,” 
you’ll see a list of suggestions pop up beneath 
the search bar. You can then look at the groups 
in which you have an interest. Simply “like” the 
groups that you want to follow, and you’ll start 
getting notifications of new posts. Most groups 
will ask you to join (by clicking the join button) if 
you want to post information or make comments 
on others’ posts.
■ LinkedIn groups. LinkedIn also has groups. To 
find a group, simply go to LinkedIn’s homepage, 
and to the left of the search bar, access the 
dropdown menu and select groups. You can 
then search to see if groups exist that match 
your topic. When writing this feature, there 
were several LinkedIn groups on bike-sharing. 
There were also groups that dealt with urban 
congestion. By typing “urban congestion” into 
the search bar, LinkedIn suggested the group 
“Creating Healthy, Liveable Cities,” among 
others. Similar to Facebook, most LinkedIn 
groups will want you to join to participate 
in the discussions.
■ Twitter. You can search for topics on Twitter, 
along with people, businesses, and organiza-
tions. You simply place the hashtag (#) in front 
of the topic. For example, for the business idea 
proposed above, you might want to search for 
the following topics: #bikesharing, #urbancon-
gestion, #urbanqualityoflife, #healthycities, etc. 
Your searches will result in the most current 
tweets of people talking about those topics. 
This is a good way to both consume content on 
a topic in which you are interested and to iden-
tify people or organizations that you might want 
to follow on a consistent basis. Twitter does not 
support groups. Some third-party Twitter tools, 
like Tweetdeck, do allow you to form or join 
groups of Twitter followers that are interested 
in a specific topic.
■ Blogs. To check to see if there is a blog on a topic 
of interest, seach google Blogs at www.google.
com/blogsearch. A quick search identified a blog 
named The Bike-Sharing Blog at www.bike-shar-
ing.blogspot.com. It also identified a website on 
Healthy Cities at www.healthycities.org.
■ Tumblr. Tumblr is a popular microblogging plat-
form and social networking website owned by 
Yahoo. Simply go to Tumblr (www.tumblr.com) 
and type your query into the search bar. You’ll 
see what Tumblr has to offer. You can try many 
different combinations of terms, such as “bike 
sharing,” “healthy cities,” “migrations to cities,” 
etc. You can then periodically view or follow the 
Tumblr microblogs that interest you the most.

that have yet to be solved. Commenting on this issue and how noticing 
problems can lead to recognizing business ideas. Philip Kotler, a marketing 
 expert, said:
Look for problems. People complain about it being hard to sleep through the 
night, get rid of clutter in their homes, find an affordable vacation, trace their 
family origins, get rid of garden weeds, and so on. As the late John Gardner, 
founder of Common Cause, observed: “Every problem is a brilliantly disguised 
opportunity.”11
Consistent with this observation, many companies have been started by 
people who have experienced a problem in their own lives, and then realized 
that the solution to the problem represented a business opportunity. For ex-
ample, in 1991, Jay Sorensen dropped a cup of coffee in his lap because the 
paper cup was too hot. This experience led Sorensen to invent an insulating 
cup sleeve and to start a company to sell it. Since launching his venture, the 
company, Java Jacket, has sold over four billion cup sleeves. Similarly, after 
watching countless women walk home barefoot after a long night in heels, 
New York University finance students Katie Shea and Susie Levitt started a 
company named CitySlips to make easily portable, comfortable shoes. They 
created a pair of flats that fold up to fit into a pocket-size zip pouch, which 
easily fits into most women’s purses. When a woman pops on the shoes, the 
pouch unfurles into a tote bag to carry the high heels. The two began selling 
CitySlips in 2009; today, their product is carried in over 500 stores.12
Advances in technology often result in problems for people who can’t use 
the technology in the way it is sold to the masses. For example, some older 
people find traditional cell phones hard to use: the buttons are small, the 
text is hard to read, and it’s often difficult to hear someone on a cell phone 
in a noisy room. To solve these problems, GreatCall, Inc. is producing a cell 
phone called the Jitterbug, which is designed specifically for older users. The 
Jitterbug features a large keypad that makes dialing easy, powerful speakers 
that deliver clear sound, easy-to-read text, and simple text-messaging capa-
bility. Another company, Firefly Mobile, has created a cell phone designed 
One of the most pressing 
problems facing the United 
States and other countries 
is finding alternatives to 
fossil fuels. A large number 
of entrepreneurial firms 
are being launched to take 
on this challenge. Among 
potential solutions is wind-
generated energy.

specifically for kids and tweens. The phone weighs only 2 ounces, and is de-
signed to fit in a kid’s hand. The phone includes a full-color screen, built-in 
games, built-in parental controls that allow parents to restrict incoming and 
outgoing calls as well as limit or restrict texting, and special speed dials for 
mom and dad.
If you’re having difficulty solving a particular problem, one technique 
that is useful is to find an instance where a similar problem was solved and 
then apply that solution to your problem. For example, Yogitoes, a company 
that makes nonslip rugs for yoga enthusiasts, was started in this man-
ner. Several yoga positions require participants to strike poses where they 
balance their weight on their feet at an angle. In this position, it is easy to 
slip when using a regular yoga mat. The company’s founder, Susan Nicols, 
looked for a yoga mat that would prevent her from slipping, but found that 
no one knew how to make one. So she started looking for an example of a 
product that was designed specifically to prevent it from slipping on a hard 
floor, to study how it functioned. Eventually, she came across a dog bowl 
with rubber nubs on the bottom to prevent it from sliding when a large dog 
ate or drank from it. Using the dog bowl as a model, Nichols found a manu-
facturer who helped her develop a rug with small PVC nubs that prevents 
yoga participants from slipping when they perform yoga moves. Nichols 
started Yogitoes to sell the rugs, patented her solution, and has now been in 
business for more than 10 years.13
Some business ideas are gleaned by recognizing problems that are associ-
ated with emerging trends. For example, SafetyWeb has created a Web-based 
service that helps parents protect their children’s online reputation, privacy, 
and safety. The social trend toward more online activity by children resulted 
in the need for this service. Similarly, the proliferation of smartphones en-
ables people to stay better connected, but results in problems when people 
aren’t able to access electricity to recharge their phones for a period of time. A 
number of companies have solved this problem in innovative ways. Examples 
include BioLite, which is a stove for campers that uses wood to create energy 
to recharge smartphones, and BikeCharge, which is a set of devices that are 
placed near the rear wheels of your bike and on your handlebars that charges 
your smartphone while you ride.
Additional examples of people who launched businesses to solve problems 
are included in Table 2.2.

Finding gaps in the Marketplace
Gaps in the marketplace are the third source of business opportunities. There are 
many examples of products that consumers need or want that aren’t available in 
a particular location or aren’t available at all. Part of the problem is created by 
large retailers, like Wal-Mart and Costco, that compete primarily on price and of-
fer the most popular items targeted toward mainstream consumers. While this 
approach allows the large retailers to achieve economies of scale, it leaves gaps in 
the marketplace. This is the reason that clothing boutiques, specialty shops, and 
e-commerce websites exist. These businesses are willing to carry merchandise 
that doesn’t sell in large enough quantities for Wal-Mart and Costco to carry.
Product gaps in the marketplace represent potentially viable business op-
portunities. For example, Tish Cirovolo realized that there were no guitars on 
the market made specifically for women. To fill this gap, she started Daisy Rock 
guitars, a company that makes guitars just for women. Daisy Rock guitars are 
stylish, come in feminine colors, and incorporate design features that accommo-
date a woman’s smaller hand and build. In a related manner, Southpaw Guitars 
located in Houston, Texas, carries only guitars that are designed and produced 
for left-handed players. Another company that is filling a gap in the market-
place is ModCloth, a firm selling vintage and vintage-inspired clothing for 18- to 
32-year-old women, which is a surprisingly large market. A start-up in a com-
pletely different industry is GreenJob Spider. GreenJob Spider fills a gap in the 
online recruiting industry by supporting a job site for employers and prospective 
employees in “green” industries such as solar, wind, recycling, green buildings, 
and LED lighting.
Additional examples of companies started to fill gaps in the marketplace 
are provided in Table 2.3.
A common way that gaps in the marketplace are recognized is when people 
become frustrated because they can’t find a product or service that they need 
and recognize that other people feel the same way. This scenario played out 
for Lorna Ketler and Barb Wilkins, who became frustrated when they couldn’t 
find stylish “plus-sized” clothing that fit. In response to their frustration, they 
started Bodacious, a store that sells fun and stylish “plus-size” clothing that 
fits. Ketler and Wilkins’s experience illustrates how compelling a business idea 
can be when it strikes just the right chord by filling a gap that deeply resonates 
with a specific clientele. Reflecting on the success of Bodacious, Wilkins said:
It’s so rewarding when you take a risk and it pays off for you and people are tell-
ing you every single day, “I am so glad you are here.” We’ve had people cry in 
our store. It happens a lot. They’re crying because they’re so happy (that they’re

finding clothes that fit). One woman put on a pair of jeans that fit her, and she 
called me an hour later and said, “They still look good, even at home!” Sometimes 
people have a body change that happens, whether they have been ill or had a 
baby, and there’s lots of emotion involved in it. If you can go and buy clothes that 
fit, that helps people feel good about themselves.14
A related technique for generating new business opportunities is to take an 
existing product or service and create a new category by targeting a completely 
different target market. This approach essentially involves creating a gap and 
filling it. An example is PopCap Games, a company that was started to create 
a new category in the electronic games industry called “casual games.” The 
games are casual and relaxing rather than flashy and action-packed, and are 
made for people who want to wind down after a busy day.
One thing that entrepreneurs must remain mindful of in pursuing business 
opportunities, regardless of whether the opportunity results from changing en-
vironmental trends, solving a problem, or finding gaps in the marketplace, is 
that the opportunity must ultimately be fashioned into a successful business. 
The nearby “What Went Wrong?” feature focuses on Everpix, a company that re-
sulted from its founders’ frustration regarding the lack of a good service to store 
and organize photos. Regrettably, the founder spent too much time focused on 
the opportunity at the expenses of the business, as you’ll see in the feature.

I
n 2009, Pierre-Olivier Latour spent some time traveling 
through Asia with a friend. He became frustrated with 
how difficult it was to store and organize all the photos 
he was taking. When he returned to the United States, 
he discussed his frustration with Kevin Quennesson, 
a fellow French engineer. Quennesson had a different 
frustration with photos, noting that the more photos he 
took, the less likely he was to go back and look at them. 
Quennesson saw this likelihood as a paradox. The more 
he documented his life, the less likely he was to enjoy 
what he had created.
Latour and Quennesson saw the combination of their 
frustrations as a problem. There wasn’t a good solution 
on the market to store and organize photos in a manner 
that would encourage people to go back and look at 
them. The two decided to start a business and build a 
prototype of a photo storing and organizing service that 
potentially solved the problem. In June 2011 they met 
Wayne Fan, who was working at a San Francisco firm 
doing interaction and visual design, and brought him in 
as a co-founder. The three spent the next several months 
building a prototype of their service, which they named 
Everpix. The service seamlessly found and uploaded 
photos from your desktop and from online services, then 
organized them to highlight the best ones. The service 
was fast, the design was clean, and it was simple to use.
Everpix raised a total of $1.8 million from angel in-
vestors and continued to work on the product. The first 
version of Everpix 1.0 rolled out in March 2013. A free 
option let you see all your photos from the past year 
or longer if you connected to Everpix’s app. For $4.99 
a month or $49 a year, the service would let you store 
an unlimited amount of photos. One cool feature, called 
Flashbacks, sent users daily email messages of their 
photos from the same day in prior years. The overall 
service got rave reviews, and its users seemed to love 
it. The Everpix app had a 4.5-star average rating (on a 
scale of 1- 5) out of more than 1,000 reviews. It seemed 
as though the founders were solving the problem they 
had set out to solve, with an attractive and solid prod-
uct. Then, in the summer of 2013, Everpix closed. What 
went wrong?
In a nutshell, Everpix’s founders spent too much time 
and energy perfecting their service at the expense of 
building a business. The service wasn’t viral, meaning 
it wasn’t easy for Everpix subscribers to share photos 
with friends and encourage them to become Everpix 
members. The Everpix team realized this was a problem 
and kicked around ways to make the service more viral. 
One idea was to require a subscriber’s friends to create 
an account to download any photos that the subscriber 
shared with them, but the idea was killed as just the type 
of self-serving design choice that the team prided itself 
in avoiding. It also spent almost nothing on advertis-
ing or promotions. It had spent the $1.8 million it raised 
building the service. So at the time when other photo 
apps were attracting millions of users, Everpix had fewer 
than 19,000 sign-ups.
In the weeks prior to closing, Everpix’s founders 
scrambled to raise additional funding. Because they were 
well-connected in the angel investing and venture capital 
world, they got a number of meetings. They were con-
sistently praised on the quality of their product and the 
quality of the team they had assembled, but the business 
was the problem. Investors were getting spooked, in part, 
by the sheer number of apps that were being created and 
the ease with which consumers could switch between 
them. In addition, a number of Everpix’s competitors 
were giving their services away for free, while Everpix’s 
business model relied on paid subscriptions. One by 
one, the investors turned them down. Several overtures 
were made to potential acquirers, but none panned out. 
Eventually, Everpix ran out of money and didn’t have the 
capacity to continue.
Questions for Critical Thinking
 1. In the context of this chapter, make a list of three 
“takeaways” from this feature that you can learn from 
and try to avoid if you set out to solve a problem by 
launching a business.
 2. To what degree is there a difference between pursuing 
an opportunity to solve a problem and building a busi-
ness? In what ways did Everpix fail to do both?
 3. According to the feature, Everpix spent almost nothing 
on advertising and promotions. How large of a role do 
you think that decision played in Everpix’s failure?
 4. venture capitalists are often accused of swinging for 
the fences—in other words, they don’t invest in firms 
that are hitting signals, doubles, or triples. They want 
home runs. In hindsight, do you think Everpix was 
building a business that had the potential to hit singles, 
doubles, or triples, or a business that had the potential 
to be a home run? Explain your answer.

Why a Company that Solved a Problem with a Great Product  
Went Out of Business

78    PART 2 | DEvELOPIng SUCCESSFUL BUSInESS IDEAS
refers to the process of perceiving the possibility of a profitable new business or 
a new product or service. That is, an opportunity cannot be pursued until it’s 
recognized. Now let’s look at some specific characteristics shared by those who 
excel at recognizing an opportunity.
prior experience
Several studies show that prior experience in an industry helps entrepre-
neurs recognize business opportunities. For example, evidence over time 
about the founders of firms appearing on the Inc. 500 list shows that well 
over 40 percent of those studied got the idea for their new businesses while 
working as employees for companies in the same industries.15 This find-
ing is consistent with those reported by scholars studying the relationship 
between industry experience and being able to recognize opportunities.16 
There are several explanations for these findings. By working in an industry, 
an individual may spot a market niche that is underserved. It is also pos-
sible that while working in a particular area, an individual builds a network 
of social contacts in that industry that may provide insights that lead to 
opportunities.17
Although prior experience is important in an industry in most instances, 
there is anecdotal evidence suggesting that people outside an industry can 
sometimes enter it with a new set of eyes, and as a result innovate in ways 
that people with prior experience might find difficult. An example is provided 
by Sam Calagione, the founder of Dogfish Head Craft Brewery, a very success-
ful brewery based in Milton, Delaware. As indicated in the following quote, 
Milton set aside current industry best practices to craft some of his most 
popular products:
In the mid-‘90s, some beer enthusiasts and experts called us heretics for brewing 
beers with ingredients outside of the “traditional” water, yeast, hops, and barley. 
So, I started researching ancient brewing cultures and learned that long ago, 
brewers in every corner of the world made beer with whatever was beautiful and 
natural and grew beneath the ground they lived on. We (Dogfish Brewery) now 
make a whole series of Ancient Ales inspired by historic and molecular evidence 
found in tombs and dig sites.18
cognitive Factors
Opportunity recognition may be an innate skill or a cognitive process.19 There 
are some who think that entrepreneurs have a “sixth sense” that allows them 
to see opportunities that others miss. This sixth sense is called entrepreneur-
ial alertness, which is formally defined as the ability to notice things without 
engaging in deliberate search.20 Most entrepreneurs see themselves in this 
light, believing they are more “alert” than others. Alertness is largely a learned 
skill, and people who have more knowledge of an area tend to be more alert 
to opportunities in that area than others. A computer engineer, for example, 
would be more alert to needs and opportunities within the computer industry 
than a lawyer would be.
The research findings on entrepreneurial alertness are mixed. Some re-
searchers conclude that alertness goes beyond noticing things and involves 
a more purposeful effort. For example, one scholar believes that the crucial 
difference between opportunity finders (i.e., entrepreneurs) and nonfinders 
is their relative assessments of the marketplace.21 In other words, entrepre-
neurs may be better than others at sizing up the marketplace and inferring 
the likely implications.

social networks
The extent and depth of an individual’s social network affects opportunity rec-
ognition.22 People who build a substantial network of social and professional 
contacts will be exposed to more opportunities and ideas than people with 
sparse networks. This exposure can lead to new business starts. Research re-
sults over time consistently suggest that somewhere between 40 percent and 
50 percent of those who start businesses got their ideas through social con-
tacts.23 In a related study, the differences between solo entrepreneurs (those 
who identified their business ideas on their own) and network entrepreneurs 
(those who identified their ideas through social contacts) were examined. The 
researchers found that network entrepreneurs identified significantly more 
opportunities than solo entrepreneurs, but were less likely to describe them-
selves as being particularly alert or creative.24
An important concept that sheds light on the importance of social networks 
to opportunity recognition is the differential impact of strong-tie versus weak-
tie relationships. Relationships with other people are called “ties.” We all have 
ties. Strong-tie relationships are characterized by frequent interaction, such 
as ties between coworkers, friends, and spouses. Weak-tie  relationships 
are characterized by infrequent interaction, like ties between casual acquain-
tances. According to research in this area, it is more likely that an entre-
preneur will get a new business idea through a weak-tie than a strong-tie 
relationship, because strong-tie relationships —which typically form between 
like-minded individuals —tend to reinforce insights and ideas the individuals 
already have.25 Weak-tie relationships, on the other hand, which form between 
casual acquaintances, are not as apt to be between like-minded individuals, so 
one person may say something to another that sparks a completely new idea. 
An example might be an electrician explaining to a restaurant owner how he 
solved a business problem. After hearing the solution, the restaurant owner 
might say, “I would never have heard that solution from someone in my com-
pany or industry. That insight is completely new to me and just might help me 
solve my problem.”
creativity
Creativity is the process of generating a novel or useful idea. Opportunity rec-
ognition may be, at least in part, a creative process. On an anecdotal basis, it 
is easy to see the creativity involved in forming many products, services, and 
businesses. Increasingly, teams of entrepreneurs working within a company 
are sources of creativity for their firm.26
For an individual, the creative process can be broken into five stages, as 
shown in Figure 2.4.27 Let’s examine how these stages relate to the opportunity 
recognition process. In the figure, the horizontal arrows that point from box to 
box suggest that the creative process progresses through five stages. The verti-
cal arrows suggest that if at any stage an individual (such as an entrepreneur) 
gets “stuck” or doesn’t have enough information or insight to continue, the

best choice is to return to the preparation stage—to obtain more knowledge or 
experience before continuing to move forward.
Preparation. Preparation is the background, experience, and knowledge 
that an entrepreneur brings to the opportunity recognition process. Just as 
an athlete must practice to excel, an entrepreneur needs experience to spot 
opportunities. Over time, the results of research suggest that as much as 50 
to 90 percent of start-up ideas emerge from a person’s prior work experience.
Incubation. Incubation is the stage during which a person considers 
an idea or thinks about a problem; it is the “mulling things over” phase. 
Sometimes incubation is a conscious activity, and sometimes it is un-
conscious and occurs while a person is engaged in another activity. One 
writer characterized this phenomenon by saying that “ideas churn around 
below the threshold of consciousness.”
Insight. Insight is the flash of recognition when the solution to a problem 
is seen or an idea is born. It is sometimes called the “eureka” experience. 
In a business context, this is the moment an entrepreneur recognizes an 
opportunity. Sometimes this experience pushes the process forward, and 
sometimes it prompts an individual to return to the preparation stage. 
For example, an entrepreneur may recognize the potential for an oppor-
tunity, but may feel that more knowledge and thought is required before 
pursuing it.
Evaluation. Evaluation is the stage of the creative process during which 
an idea is subjected to scrutiny and analyzed for its viability. Many entre-
preneurs mistakenly skip this step and try to implement an idea before 
they’ve made sure it is viable. Evaluation is a particularly challenging 
stage of the creative process because it requires an entrepreneur to take 
a candid look at the viability of an idea. We discuss how to evaluate the 
feasibility of new business ideas in Chapter 3.
Elaboration. Elaboration is the stage during which the creative idea is 
put into a final form: The details are worked out and the idea is trans-
formed into something of value, such as a new product, service, or busi-
ness concept. In the case of a new business, this is the point at which a 
business plan is written.

the personal characteristics of the entrepreneur because the two facets of op-
portunity recognition are interdependent. For example, an entrepreneur with a 
well-established social network may be in a better position to recognize emerg-
ing technological trends than an entrepreneur with a poorly established social 
network. Or the awareness of an emerging technology trend, such as digitiza-
tion, may prompt an entrepreneur to attend conferences or workshops to learn 
more about the topic, expanding the social network.
techniques for generating ideas
In general, entrepreneurs identify more ideas than opportunities because 
many ideas are typically generated to find the best way to capitalize on an 
opportunity.28 Several techniques can be used to stimulate and facilitate the 
generation of new ideas for products, services, and businesses. Let’s take a 
look at some of them.
Brainstorming
A common way to generate new business ideas is through brainstorming. In 
general, brainstorming is simply the process of generating several ideas about 
a specific topic. The approaches range from a person sitting down with a yellow 
legal pad and jotting down interesting business ideas to formal “brainstorming 
sessions” led by moderators that involve a group of people.
In a formal brainstorming session, the leader of the group asks the par-
ticipants to share their ideas. One person shares an idea, another person 
reacts to it, another person reacts to the reaction, and so on. A flip chart or 
an electronic whiteboard is typically used to record all the ideas. A produc-
tive session is freewheeling and lively. The session is not used for analysis or 
decision making—the ideas generated during a brainstorming session need to 
be filtered and analyzed, but this is done later. We show the four strict rules 
for conducting a formal brainstorming session in Table 2.4. As you’ll see, the 
number one rule for a brainstorming session is that no criticism is allowed, 
including chuckles, raised eyebrows, or facial expressions that express skepti-
cism or doubt. Criticism stymies creativity and inhibits the free flow of ideas.

Some organizations use 
“brainstorming walls” for 
people to jot down ideas. 
By putting ideas on walls, 
people can stand back

simultaneously, and make 
connections that they 
otherwise would not have 
made.

Brainstorming sessions dedicated to generating new business ideas are of-
ten less formal. For example, while creating Proactiv, a popular acne treatment 
product, Dr. Katie Rodan, one of the company’s founders, hosted dinner parties 
at her house and conducted brainstorming sessions with guests. The guests 
included business executives, market researchers, marketing consultants, an 
FDA regulatory attorney, and others. Rodan credits this group with helping her 
and her co-founder brainstorm a number of ideas that helped shape Proactiv 
and move the process of starting the company forward.29 Similarly, Sharelle 
Klaus—the founder of Dry Soda, a company that makes an all-natural soda 
that’s paired with food the way wine is in upscale restaurants—tested her idea 
by first talking to her husband’s colleagues, who were in the food industry, and 
then tapped into the professional network of a friend who owned a bottled water 
company. Through the process, she met a chemist, who was instrumental in 
helping her develop the initial recipes for her beverage. Klaus also went directly 
to restaurant owners and chefs to ask them to sample early versions of her 
product.30 While this approach only loosely fits the definition of brainstorming, 
the spirit is the same. Klaus was bouncing ideas and early prototypes of her 
product off others to get their reactions and generate additional ideas.
An individual’s imagination is the only limiting factor to brainstorming. 
Asking students to complete a bug report is a popular technique that is used 
in classrooms to teach brainstorming. To compile a bug report, students are 
instructed to list 50 to 75 conditions or “things” that “bug” them in their ev-
eryday lives. Asking students to identify a number of conditions or things that 
bug them reduces the likelihood that they will specify only obvious things that 
bug them (e.g., campus parking, dorm food, and untidy roommates). Students 
can also be encouraged to hold focus groups with friends to brainstorm condi-
tions that can be included on their “bug” list.
Focus groups
A focus group is a gathering of 5 to 10 people who are selected because of 
their relationship to the issue being discussed. Focus groups are used for a 
variety of purposes, including the generation of new business ideas.
Focus groups typically involve a group of people who are familiar with a 
topic, are brought together to respond to questions, and shed light on an issue 
through the give-and-take nature of a group discussion. Focus groups usually 
work best as a follow-up to brainstorming, when the general idea for a busi-
ness has been formulated—such as casual electronic games for adults—but 
further refinement of the idea is needed. Usually, focus groups are conducted 
by trained moderators. The moderator’s primary goals are to keep the group 
“focused” and to generate lively discussion. Much of the effectiveness of a

Freewheeling, which is the carefree expression of ideas free from rules or restraints, is encouraged; the more ideas, 
the better. Even crazy or outlandish ideas may lead to a good idea or a solution to a problem.

The session moves quickly, and nothing is permitted to slow down its pace. For example, it is more important to 
capture the essence of an idea than to take the time to write it down neatly.

Leapfrogging is encouraged. This means using one idea as a means of jumping forward quickly to other ideas.

CHAPTER 2 | RECOgnIzIng OppOrtunities AnD gEnERATIng IDEAS    83
focus group session depends on the moderator’s ability to ask questions and 
keep the discussion on track. For example, a retail establishment in which 
coffee is sold, such as Starbucks, might conduct a focus group consisting of 
7 to 10 frequent customers and ask the group, “What is it that you don’t like 
about our coffee shop?” A customer may say, “You sell 1-pound bags of your 
specialty ground coffees for people to brew at home. That’s okay, but I often 
run out of the coffee in just a few days. Sometimes it’s a week before I get back 
to the shop to buy another bag. If you sold 3-pound or 5-pound bags, I’d actu-
ally use more coffee because I wouldn’t run out so often. I guess I could buy 
two or three 1-pound bags at the same time, but that gets a little pricey. I’d 
buy a 3- or 5-pound bag, however, if you’d discount your price a little for larger 
quantities.” The moderator may then ask the group, “How many people here 
would buy 3-pound or 5-pound bags of our coffee if they were available?” If five 
hands shoot up, the coffee shop may have just uncovered an idea for a new 
product line.
A relatively new service called Napkin Labs helps companies funnel follow-
ers from Facebook and other sites into more intimate, more structured online 
communities intended to serve as focus groups. For example, Modify, the sub-
ject of Case 3.1, is a company that creates custom watches. The watches have 
interchangable faces, straps, and sliders and come in two sizes. Modify uses 
Napkin Labs to get people to chime in on what new colors and designs they’d 
like to see, and where they’d like to see the watches sold. Each lab poses a 
challenge, such as “where should our watches be sold?” A dialogue is created 
among the participants. Each participant knows what the other ones are say-
ing and can react to their comments. According to Aaron Schwartz, Modify’s 
founder, one lab showed a surprisingly big interest in seeing his company’s 
watches sold in surf shops. Other online companies, such as UserVoice and 
Get Satisfaction, help firms connect with their users in a similar manner.31
library and internet research
A third approach to generating new business ideas is to conduct library and 
Internet research. A natural tendency is to think that an idea should be chosen, 
and the process of researching the idea should then begin. This approach is too 
linear. Often, the best ideas emerge when the general notion of an idea—like 
creating casual electronic games for adults—is merged with extensive library 
and Internet research, which might provide insights into the best type of casual 
games to create.
Libraries are often an underutilized source of information for generat-
ing business ideas. The best approach to utilizing a library is to discuss your 
general area of interest with a reference librarian, who can point out useful 
resources, such as industry-specific magazines, trade journals, and industry 
reports. Simply browsing through several issues of a trade journal on a topic 
can spark new ideas. Very powerful search engines and databases are also 
available through university and large public libraries, which would cost hun-
dreds or thousands of dollars to access on your own. An example is IBISWorld 
(www.ibisworld.com), a company that publishes market research on all major 
industries and subcategories within industries.
Internet research is also important. If you are starting from scratch, simply 
typing “new business ideas” into Google or Bing will produce links to newspa-
per and magazine articles about the “hottest” and “latest” new business ideas. 
Although these types of articles are general in nature, they represent a start-
ing point if you’re trying to generate new business ideas from scratch. If you 
have a specific idea in mind, a useful technique is to set up a Google “email 
alert” using keywords that pertain to your topic of interest. Google email alerts 
are email updates of the latest Google results including press releases, news 

84    PART 2 | DEvELOPIng SUCCESSFUL BUSInESS IDEAS
articles, and blog posts based on your topic. This technique, which is available 
for free, will feed you a daily stream of news articles and blog postings about 
specific topics. Another approach is to follow business leaders and experts in 
the industries you’re interested in on Twitter. The best way to locate people on 
Twitter you might be interested in following is by typing into the search bar 
relevant keywords preceded by the “#” sign. For example, if you’re interested 
in solar power, type “#solarpower” into the search bar. All the results will be 
people or companies who tweet about solar power topics.
Once an entrepreneur has an idea, it often needs to be shaped and fine-
tuned. One way to do this—in conjunction with the suggestions made previ-
ously—is to enlist a mentor to help. An explanation of how to use a mentor in 
this regard, and where mentors can be found, is described in the “Partnering 
for Success” feature.
other techniques
Firms use a variety of other techniques to generate ideas. Some companies set 
up customer advisory boards that meet regularly to discuss needs, wants, 
and problems that may lead to new ideas. Other companies conduct varying 
forms of anthropological research, such as day-in-the-life research. Intuit, 
the maker of Quicken, Quickbooks, and TurboTax, practices day-in-the life re-
search. The company routinely sends teams of testers to the homes and busi-
nesses of its users to see how its products are working and to seek insights for 
new product ideas.
encouraging the development  
of new ideas
In many firms, idea generation is a haphazard process. However, entrepre-
neurial ventures can take certain concrete steps to build an organization that 
encourages and protects new ideas. Let’s see what these steps are.
establishing a Focal point for ideas
Some firms meet the challenge of encouraging, collecting, and evaluating ideas 
by designating a specific person to screen and track them—for if it’s everybody’s 
job, it may be no one’s responsibility.32 Another approach is to establish an 
idea bank (or vault), which is a physical or digital repository for storing ideas. 
An example of an idea bank would be a password-protected location on a firm’s 
intranet that is available only to qualified employees. It may have a file for 
ideas that are being actively contemplated and a file for inactive ideas. Other 
firms do not have idea banks, but instead encourage employees to keep jour-
nals of their ideas.
encouraging creativity at the Firm level
There is an important distinction between creativity and innovation. As indicated 
in Chapter 1, innovation refers to the successful introduction of new outcomes by 
a firm. In contrast, creativity is the process of generating a novel or useful idea; 
however, creativity does not require implementation of an idea. In other words, 
creativity is the raw material that goes into innovation. A team of employees may 
come up with a hundred legitimate creative ideas for a new product or service, 
but only one may eventually be implemented. Of course, it may take a hundred 
creative ideas to discover the one that ideally satisfies an opportunity.

of raising money for your start-up and you’re a student 
at Oklahoma State University, you might type into the 
search bar “CFO Oklahoma State University.” The results 
will list everyone with a LinkedIn profile who identifies 
themself as the CFO (Chief Financial Officer) of an orga-
nization and is a graduate of Oklahoma State University. 
You can then connect with the person through the pri-
vate email service within LinkedIn. Most people have 
fond memories of their college days. As a result, even 
experienced entrepreneurs and executives are often 
delighted to connect with a student at their alma mater.
The ideal situation is to find a mentor in your own 
community so you can meet face-to-face, whether it’s an 
alumni of your university of someone else. Still, the on-
line options provide a wide range of mentors to choose 
from, which may result in a better match. Online mentor-
ing and counseling relationships are becoming increas-
ingly common. For example, a sizeable percent of all the 
counseling and mentoring done by SCORE counselors is 
now done online.
Similar to any relationship, a business founder should 
be careful and only share private information with a men-
tor once a trusting relationship has been established.
Questions for Critical Thinking
 1. If you were working on fine-tuning a business idea, 
would you check out one of these online options or an 
association in your area that provides mentoring and 
advice for business founders? Why or why not?
 2. To what degree do you believe that having a mentor 
can make the difference between an entrepreneur 
succeeding or failing? In what areas of the entrepre-
neurial process do you believe that mentors are called 
on the most?
 3. Make a list of the organizations in your area that  provide 
mentorship and advice for business founders. Which 
organizations make the most sense to reach out to 
for someone who is still in the opportunity  recognition 
stage of the start-up process?
 4. How do you know what to do with a mentor’s advice? 
If you get advice from several mentors or counselors 
at organizations like SCORE and local Small Business 
Development Centers, how can you best sort through 
the advice and know which advice to take and which 
advice to set aside?

ine-tuning a business idea isn’t easy. While fairly 
course-grained ideas are rather easy to develop, like 
creating a smartphone that’s designed specifically 
for elderly people, fleshing out the details is where expe-
rience helps. This reality puts first-time entrepreneurs at 
a disadvantage. While there are many books and web-
sites about new business ideas, what many first-time 
entrepreneurs find most helpful in the idea generation 
and perfecting stage is to find a mentor to guide them 
through the process.
A mentor is someone who is more experienced than 
you and is willing to be your counselor, confidant, and 
go-to person for advice. There are two ways to find a 
mentor. First, you can work with your network of ac-
quaintances—professors, business owners, coaches—
to determine if there is someone available that you trust, 
has experience helping first-time entrepreneurs, and is 
willing to become your mentor. Many first-time entrepre-
neurs are surprised by the number of talented and ex-
perienced people who are eager to share their expertise 
and enter into a mentoring relationship. The second way 
is to utilize one of the growing numbers of websites and 
organizations that help match business founders with 
people who are willing to become mentors. One website 
is MicroMentor.org, which is a nonprofit that matches 
business founders with mentors. You can go to the site 
and fill out a profile about yourself and your goals, and 
then search profiles of potential mentors who match 
your needs. Once a match is made, the mentoring can 
take place through email, via Web conferencing, over 
the phone, or in person. There is a tab on MicroMentor’s 
website that provides access to “success stories” of 
business founders who have had excellent results us-
ing its service. A number of organizations provide a 
similar service. For example, the national Association 
for Women Business Owners (nAWBO) has over 5,000 
members in 60 chapters across the United States. Some 
chapters sponsor mentorship programs.
Another useful suggestion is to reach out to somone 
in your college or university’s alumni network. Alumni are 
often looking for a way to “give back” to the instutition 
from which they graduated and are frequently willing to 
connect with others as a way of doing so. Alumni often 
serve as judges for college-sponsored pitch or busi-
ness plan competitions, so that’s one way to connect. A 
particularly useful resource is to do an Advanced People 
Search on LinkedIn. You can do this by accessing the 
Advanced People Search function in LinkedIn (www.
linkedin.com/search?trk=advsrch). You type in a title and 
your university. For example, if what you’re looking for is 
a mentor that can help navigate you through the process

An employee may exhibit creativity in a number of ways, including solving 
a problem or taking an opportunity and using it to develop a new product or 
service idea. Although creativity is typically thought of as an individual attri-
bute, it can be encouraged or discouraged at the firm level. The extent to which 
an organization encourages and rewards creativity affects the creative output 
of its employees.33 Table 2.5 provides a list of actions and behaviors that en-

Chapter Summary
technological advances, and political action 
and regulatory changes are the four envi-
ronmental trends that are most instrumen-
tal in creating opportunities. Through the 
second approach, entrepreneurs identify 
problems that they and others encounter 
in various parts of the lives and then go 
about developing a good or service that is 
intended to solve the identified problem. 
Carefully observing people and the actions 
they take is an excellent way to find prob-
lems that, when solved, would create value 
for a customer. Finding gaps in the mar-
ketplace is the third way to spot a business 
opportunity. Typically, the way this works 
is that an entrepreneur recognizes that 
some people are interested in buying more 
 lO1. An idea is a thought, an impression, or a 
notion. An opportunity is an idea that has 
the qualities of being attractive, durable, 
and timely and is anchored in a product 
or service that creates value for its buyers 
or end-users. Not all ideas are opportuni-
ties. Once an opportunity is recognized, 
a window opens, and the market to fill 
the opportunity grows. At some point, the 
market matures and becomes saturated 
with competitors, and the window of op-
portunity closes.
 lO2. Observing trends, solving a problem, 
and finding gaps in the marketplace are 
the three general approaches entrepre-
neurs use to identify a business oppor-
tunity. Economic forces, social forces, 

CHAPTER 2 | RECOgnIzIng OppOrtunities AnD gEnERATIng IDEAS    87
holdings and of Internet sites are a third 
technique. Here, the entrepreneur uses an 
open mind to sort through large amounts 
of information and data to see if s/he can 
identify a problem that could be solved by 
creating an innovative product or service.
 lO5. Entrepreneurs and their firms engage in 
several actions to encourage the devel-
opment and retention of business ideas. 
Creativity is central to a firm’s efforts to 
innovate; as such, firms take actions to 
nurture creativity. More specifically, en-
trepreneurs and their firms encourage 
creativity at the firm level through both 
organizational and individual supervisory 
level facilitators of creativity. Examples of 
organizational level facilitators of creativ-
ity include supporting creativity’s impor-
tance and hiring people with different skills 
and viewpoints than those of current em-
ployees. Examples of individual supervi-
sory level facilitators of creativity include 
listening attentively for the purpose of ac-
knowledging and supporting ideas early in 
their development and protecting people 
who make honest mistakes and commit to 
learning from them. Ideas flowing from the 
exercise of creativity are stored in an idea 
bank, which is a physical or digital resposi-
tory for storing ideas generated throughout 
an entrepreneurial venture.
specialized products, such as guitars that 
are made for left-handed players or scissors 
for people who are dominant left-handers.
 lO3. Over time, research results and observa-
tions of entrepreneurs in action indicate 
that some people are better at recognizing 
opportunities than others. Prior experi-
ence, cognitive factors, social networks, 
and creativity are the main personal char-
acteristics researchers have identified and 
that observation indicates tend to make 
some people better at recognizing busi-
ness opportunities than others.
 lO4. Entrepreneurs use several techniques for 
the purpose of identifying ideas for new 
products and services. Brainstorming is 
one of these. More specifically, brainstorm-
ing is a technique used to quickly generate 
a large number of ideas and solutions to 
problems. One reason to conduct a brain-
storming session is to generate ideas that 
might represent product, service, or busi-
ness opportunities. A focus group, a second

Business idea:  Launch a monthly subscription service 
that delivers healthy snacks to subscribers at their 
doorsteps for a low monthly fee.
pitch:  Snacking is a part of everyday life. As Americans 
become more health conscious, they are continually 
looking for healthier snacks. natureBox provides a 
subscription service where it delivers a box of healthy 
snacks to its subscribers on a monthly basis. The boxes 
come in three sizes: individual, family, and office. The 
individual box contains five snacks, the family box 10 
snacks, and the office box 15 snacks. The boxes contain 
packages of snack items such as dried fruit strips, 
harvest nut mix, cranberry almond bits, and roasted 
kettle kernels. Each package is a natureBox-branded 
product that is formulated in-house by natureBox’s 
nutritional specialists.
With a mission of “Discover a Healthier You,” natureBox’s 
selling proposition is that it provides consumers with 
a variety of healthy snacks without having to go to the 
store, walk the aisles, and read the labels on snack se-
lections to make sure they are nutritious. Since snacks 
are consumed, they need to be regularly replenished, 
which is facilitated by natureBox’s monthly deliveries. 
The company also sells full-sized versions of the snacks 
that it includes in its monthly subscription boxes on its 
website. A customer can customize his or her monthly 
subscription box or let natureBox surprise them. For 
those that allow natureBox to surprise them, the service 
contains an element of anticipation and fun as custom-
ers await their monthly box and then discovers what’s 
inside. All of natureBox’s snacks are sourced from 
local growers and independent food suppliers across 
the United States. Every natureBox snack is guaranteed 
nutritious and is free from high-fructose corn syrup, 
hydrogenated oils, trans fats, and artificial sweeteners, 
flavors, and colors.
While natureBox views the subscription model as a 
powerful form of distribution, it realizes that not all con-
sumers want to subscribe to a product or service. As a 
result, the company’s goal is to build a brand of nutritious 
snack foods that can be sold both within and outside the 
subscription framework. The company’s intentions are to 
continue to sell online. Only 2 percent of all food prod-
ucts are currently sold online. natureBox believes that as 
people become increasingly comfortable conducting the 
majority of their purchases online, that 2 percent number 
will increase and consumers will be drawn to brands that 
sell predominately online and are distinctive and unique, 
such as natureBox’s tasty, nutritious snacks.
natureBox is spreading the word about its subscription 
service and products primarily via social media. It cur-
rently has more than 786,000 Facebook likes and says 
that many of its sales come from pass-alongs and word-
of-mouth referrals.

Business idea:  Create a service that allows motorists 
to find parking spots on a regular basis or for special 
events, and allow parking space owners (both individuals 
and commercial lots) a way of connecting with drivers to 
rent underutilized parking spaces.
pitch:  Finding convenient parking in a city or for a major 
sporting event or concert is a frustration that almost 
every motorist has experienced. Trouble finding parking 
is also a major cause of congestion. Experts estimate 
that 30 percent of urban traffic is caused by motorists 
trying to find parking. At the same time, commercial lots 
and garages often have underutilized parking spaces 
because people can’t find them or mistakenly assume 
they are full. In most cases, there are also homes and 
businesses within a short walking distance from where 
people are looking for parking with spaces that are 
vacant during large portions of the day.
Parking Panda has created a solution for this problem. 
It is a website and app that connects drivers looking 
for parking with commercial lots and individuals who 
have spaces to rent. Here’s how it works. In areas where 
Parking Panda is available (70 cities and counting), driv-
ers that are already on the road can enter their location, 
and Parking Panda will show them the nearest available 
spaces. If you’re planning ahead, you can browse a col-
lection of parking spots based on price and location, and 
reserve one. You can search by neighborhood, restau-
rant, hotel, nightclub, music venue, or stadium. When 
you arrive at your destination, your spot will be available, 
even if the ramp or lot is sold out. You gain admittance

by showing the reservation on your smartphone to the 
attendant. If the lot is gated and does not have an atten-
dant, you gain admittance by using the Parking Panda 
app to scan a code at the entrance, which opens the 
gate. You exit the lot in the same manner. Parking spots 
can be reserved on a one-time basis or can be reserved 
for regular use. Parking Panda collects the fee at the 
time the reservation is made and then reimburses the 
owner of the spot.
Parking Panda makes money by taking a commission on 
each spot that is rented. It negotiates directly with com-
mercial lots and garages. Individuals and businesses that 
have parking spaces available simply upload a picture of 
their spot and set a price. Parking Panda lets the owner 
know when a spot has been rented and handles the pay-
ment. Parking Panda also has arrangements with sports 
leagues such as the national Basketball Association 
(nBA) and the national Hockey Association (nHL) to fa-
cilitate parking for their events.

questions would you ask the firm’s founders before 
making your funding decision? What answers would

introduction
In early 2007, Drew Houston was on a bus from Boston 
to new York City. He was excited because he had four 
hours to work on his laptop. All of a sudden, he had 
a feeling in the pit of his stomach that something was 
wrong. He searched through his pockets and discov-
ered that he had forgotten his USB memory stick. He 
was now stuck on the bus with nothing to work on. 
Frustrated, he immediately starting building technology 
to synch files over the Web. Fast forward to the pres-
ent. Houston’s eventual solution, Dropbox, has over 200 
million users. Dropbox allows users to create a special 
folder on each of their devices. Once a piece of digital 
content is placed in a folder (Word file, Excel file, photo, 
video, etc.), Dropbox automatically syncs it across all 
the users’ devices, permitting the content to be retrieved 
and updated from any device. The content also ap-
pears in a file on Dropbox’s website. And if you make 
a change to a file in one location, that file is updated 
across all devices. Dropbox completely solves the prob-
lem of working on a file on one device, such as an office 
computer, and then not having it available on another 
device, like a laptop at home. You can even invite others 
to view these files, making the sharing of files easy. It’s 
like having a magic pocket that contains all your digital 
content and is always with you, with the ability to share 
the digital content with whomever you want.
Although Dropbox’s service is easy to use, it wasn’t 
easy to build or even easy to explain at the outset. It’s 
a story of two determined entrepreneurs who set out to 
solve a problem, build an elegant solution, and then did 
a lot of things right in executing on their business idea.
Drew houston
The Dropbox story starts when Houston was young. He 
started writing code in his early teens. At 14, he signed up 
to beta test an online game, and began identifying security 
flaws. The company soon hired him as their networking 
programmer, in exchange for equity. Houston worked at 
start-ups through high school and college. By the time he 
got to MIT, most of his time was spent coding. He knew 
that to start businesses, he’d need to know more than just 
coding, so he starting reading business books. He read 
books on finance, management, negotiations, etc.
After graduating from college, Houston took a job 
with a tech firm. The day on the bus from Boston to new 
York City took place about a year into the new job. Four 
months later, he flew to San Francisco to pitch the idea 
for Dropbox to Paul graham of business accelerator Y 
Combinator. graham insisted that Houston have a co-
founder, even to pitch. Houston was soon introduced to 
Arash Ferdowsi, who was a junior engineering student 
at MIT, and the two hit it off. They decided to work on 
Dropbox together. They were soon admitted and went 
through Y Combinator in 2007.
Minimal viable product and solving a problem 
people Didn’t Know they had
After their Y Combinator experience finished, Houston 
and Ferdowsi raised $1.2 million in funding. A challenge 
they faced from the beginning is that they were solving 
a problem that most people didn’t know they had. There 
were ways for people to transfer files from one device to 
another, such as USB memory sticks, e-mailing files to

yourself, and so forth. The idea of a service that would 
sync your files across all your devices didn’t exist, so 
no one knew to ask for it. This reality posed a problem. 
To gain traction, it wouldn’t do any good to buy google 
AdWords, for example, because no one was searching 
for a file syncing service.
To test demand and get feedback on early versions of 
Dropbox, Houston and Ferdowsi opted for a novel solu-
tion. They made two short product videos. The first video, 
which was made just before Y Combinator, appeared on 
Dropbox’s Homepage. It was a simple, 2-minute-and-
17-second stick figure video showing what the service 
did—nothing complicated, just a guy who loses stuff and 
goes on a trip to Africa. The second video was a year 
later. It was a bland, simple three- minute demonstration of 
Dropbox as it was meant to work, targeted at a community 
of technology early adopters. Houston narrated the video. 
It was both informative and playful. If you look closly, you’ll 
notice that the files that Houston is moving around (on the 
video) are full of humorous references that were appreci-
ated by the audience to whom he was talking.
At the time of the videos, Dropbox was available only 
to a small group of beta-users. Houston and Ferdowsi 
were reluctant to release the product to a wider audience 
because it wasn’t completely ready. As noted by Eric 
Riese in a TechCrunch article titled “How DropBox Started 
As a Minimal viable Product,” the videos were  essentially 
the minimal viable product—they provided sufficient detail 
to test whether there was a market for the service. The 
videos did the trick, with the second one driving hundreds 
of thousands of people to Dropbox’s website. Its wait-
ing list for beta users went from 5,000 people to 75,000 
people overnight. Dropbox was off and running.
If you’d like to watch the videos, they are available 
on YouTube. For the first video, go to YouTube and type 
in the search box “Original Dropbox video.” For the 
second video, type in the search box “Dropbox Digg 
video.” (It was originally posted on the website Digg.)
Building a company
In Dropbox’s early days, Houston and Ferdowsi were 
the only employees. They didn’t hire anyone until they 
got their first round of funding. Two years later, long after 
the second video was released, Dropbox had 200,000 
customers, but only nine employees. In 2011, Dropbox 
grossed more than three times per employee than 
google. All of the early hires were engineers. Despite 
Dropbox’s seeming simplicity, it required significant 
technical expertise to build.
Houston and Ferdowsi have always believed in keep-
ing Dropbox lean, which remains a central element in the 
firm’s culture today. The company has raised substantial 
venture capital funding. Dropbox utilizes a freemium busi-
ness model, where users are offered a free account with a 
set storage size and paid subscriptions for accounts with 
more capaticy. Along the way, Houston and Ferdowsi 
have done several clever things to spur Dropbox’s 
growth. The freemium model itself drives user adoption. 
The company also has a referal system to get new user 
sign-ups. A current user could get additional memory for 
free by making a referral. Interestingly, almost 96 percent 
of Dropbox’s users pay nothing. They utilize the free ser-
vice. The 4 percent that do pay represent a large enough 
critial mass of subscribers to fund Dropbox’s opera-
tions and its growth. Dropbox is a private company, so it 
doesn’t reveal its financial results.
compelling nature of service
More than anything else, Dropbox’s success can be at-
tributed to the compelling nature of its service. Early in 
the company’s history, there was a sign in its corporate 
office that said “It simply works!” Here are some specific 
facts and figures about Dropbox’s service that illustrate 
the compelling nature of what it has to offer.
■ Install the Dropbox application, and a Dropbox 
folder appears on your desktop. Anything you 
drag into the folder is uploaded automatically to 
the Dropbox service and is then instantly repli-
cated across all your computers, smartphones, 
and other devices. How cool is that?
■ Dropbox folders are extremely convenient for 
group projects.
■ The service is easy and simple to learn. Most 
people upload and start using the service without 
ever referring to the instructions. The Dropbox 
team knew that with millions of people using its 
service, it had to be simple.
■ It is supported on all platforms. Apple iCloud, 
for example, is a comparable service, but it only 
works for Apple devices. Dropbox has vowed to 
remain neutral and support all platforms.
■ In April 2012, Dropbox announced a new feature 
allowing users to automatically upload (to their 
Dropbox account) photos and videos from cam-
eras, tablets, SD cards, and smartphones.
■ In September 2012, Facebook and Dropbox 
 integrated to allow group users to share files to 
Facebook groups using Dropbox’s cloud-based 
storage system.
the Advent of the smartphone
The advent of the smartphone, including the Apple iPhone 
and Android-equipped devices, has created an interesting 
point of differentiation for Dropbox. Prior to the smart-
phone, Dropbox was a nice to have, but not necessarily a 
have-to-have product. People could still transfer informa-
tion using USB memory sticks. Memory sticks can’t be 
attached to smartphones. Apple allows users to upload the 
data on their smartphones to iCloud, but iCloud is limited 
to Apple devices, as mentioned above. If people want to 
have all the digital content they own, including what’s on 
their smartphone in one place, the clear choice is Dropbox.
challenges Ahead
Despite its impressive success, Dropbox has vexing 
challenges ahead. Some observers feel the long-term 
(continued)

92    PART 2 | DEvELOPIng SUCCESSFUL BUSInESS IDEAS
potential of Dropbox will be determined by how they 
meet these challenges.
There are two primary challenges that Dropbox is 
facing. First, it deals with enormous complexity. Its 200 
million users save one billion files every 24 hours. In addi-
tion, anytime a device manufacturer tweaks the software 
or hardware associated with their device, the Dropbox 
team must remain on top of the change to make sure that 
its service will still work for that device. Second, Dropbox 
is facing an increasing number of competitors. Apple 
iCloud is an example. Dropbox has an edge over iCloud 
because it’s available across platforms, but more chal-
lenging competition may be coming. If google, Apple, or 
Samsung, for example, decided to go head-to-head with 
Dropbox, those companies would have the technological 
chops to give Dropbox a go. Many believe Dropbox is up 
to the challenge. In January 2014, Fast Compay maga-
zine listed Dropbox as the most innovative company in 
America in the category of Productivity.

introduction
Jill is a 26-year-old sales rep for a technology company. 
She lives in a two-bedroom townhouse with her golden 
Retriever Rex. Jill travels about twice a month, and when 
she’s gone, she has three options regarding care for Rex. 
Option #1—She can ask a neighbor to watch him, but 
that’s hit-and-miss, and she hasn’t found anyone she 
can depend on; Option # 2—She can take him to her 
parents’ house, but they live about an hour away; and 
Option #3—She can take Rex to one of the two kennels 
that are close to where Jill lives. There is nothing wrong 
with them, but they are typical kennels. The dogs are 
cooped up most of the day, and a month ago, Rex came 
home from the kennel with a cough he picked up from 
another dog.
Jill loves Rex and has no plans to give him up, but 
every time she travels, it’s a problem to decide what to 
do with Rex.
A Bad experience at a Kennel leads  
to a Business idea
Many people are just like Jill. They either have trouble 
finding suitable arrangements for their dog when they 
travel, or they feel bad when they’re packing for an 
 exciting trip with their dog’s big, sad eyes staring at 
them. The idea for Rover.com—a service that connects 
dog owners with dog sitters—occurred to greg 
gottesman after his yellow Labrador Ruby Tuesday 
had a bad experience at a traditional kennel. To see if 
the idea had legs, gottesman pitched it at a Startup 
Weekend event in Seattle in 2011. Startup Weekends 
are events that are held across the country. Anyone can 
pitch a business idea and get feedback from peers. 
gottesman’s idea received top prize, and six months 
later, he launched Rover.com.
While gottesman may have had a good pitch, a 
little research helps validate the business idea. The dog 
boarding/sitting market is about $6 billion a year. More 
encouraging is that the market could be much larger. 
Many people don’t travel because there is no one they 
can trust to watch their dog(s). In addition, a survey of 
1,000 dog owners by PetCare.com indicated that 80 
percent worry about the care their dogs are getting while 
they’re away, and 66 percent are unhappy with their cur-
rent boarding situation. A total of 70 percent said they 
would travel more if they had a trusted dog sitter. To get 
a sense of just how deeply some people care about their 
pets, a survey of dog owners (commissioned by Rover.
com) found that 76 percent of dog owners self-identify 
themselves as “pet parents,” as opposed to “dog 
owners.” A growing number of people see their dogs 
as “family members” rather than pets. The American 
veterinary Medical Association found that people who

consider their dogs to be family members spend twice 
as much money on them annually ($438 vs. $190) as 
those who view pets as property.
how rover.com Works
Rover.com’s service is run through its website. If you’re 
a dog owner, you simply follow the prompts on the 
website, which asks you to identify your location and 
select the dates you need your dog to be watched. You 
can indicate whether you’d like your dog to be watched 
at your home or the sitter’s household. You’re then 
provided profiles of Rover.com-approved dog sitters in 
the area. The profile includes prices (per night), photos, 
reviews, certifications, and a full description of the sit-
ter. The reviews are particularly helpful. For example, a 
Rover.com customer wrote the following about Jennifer, 
a Rover.com sitter in Central Florida: “I boarded my 
1-year old Beagle with Jennifer for eight nights while 
on a cruise. She took great care of him and e-mailed us 
every night with an update. I highly recommend her and 
will definitely be using her in the future.” Some sitters 
send text and photo updates along with e-mails. Rover 
sitters charge between $25 and $75 per night. In San 
Francisco, Rover.com’s biggest market, there are over 
500 sitters registered on the site.
The profiles also reveal the nature of the sitter. 
Some are professionals who watch dogs on a full-time 
basis. Others are large families with their own dogs. 
Some have rural property with park-like settings. Still, 
others are elderly people who enjoy watching dogs in 
their homes.
If you’d like to become a Rover.com sitter, the web-
site walks you through the application process. You must 
create a profile and must be approved by Rover.com. 
The company says that it approves only 10 percent of the 
sitters who apply. Rover also encourages a “meet-and-
greet” session before a dog owner tries a sitter. This sug-
gestion recommends that the dog owners (with their dog 
in tow) meet the dog sitter at a mutually agreeable time 
and place to talk before they try each other out. The meet-
and-greet can be arranged through Rover.com’s website. 
Rover helps sitters get started by providing them access 
to $20 coupons to provide to new clients. A sitter can get 
up to 250 of the coupons, and Rover pays the bill.
Rover handles client billing. It takes a 15 percent 
commission for its part. Many Rover.com sitters leave 
successful careers to dog-sit full time. While critics 
chuckle when they hear statements like this, Rover.
com can be a serious business. There are now over 
25,000 dog sitters with profiles on Rover.com’s website. 
Top Rover.com sitters earn several thousand dollars a 
month. A Rover sitter can also work as much or as little 
as they want. A sitter’s profile includes a calendar indi-
cating when the sitter is available. The average stay for 
a dog at a sitter’s home is just over four days.
Rover tries to take care of both the dog owner and 
dog sitter by offering additional layers of protection. For

headquarters aimed at the part of the building where 
Rover.com’s employees let their dogs hang out. The 
day this case was written, there were six dogs in-house, 
including Carmel, georgie girl, gus, Charlie, Oscar, and 
another gus. Oscar, for example, is a three-year, one-
month-old Miniature Schnauzer. He was lounging on a 
comfy chair the day the case was written. Rover’s sitters 
are also equipped with some cool technology. The com-
pany’s app allows sitters to send photos of the dogs 
they are watching to their owners while they’re away.
In late 2013, Rover.com introduced Rover Reel, 
which offers Rover customers free videos of their dog’s 
experience during their stay with a Rover.com sitter. 
Sitters simply submit sufficient photos of a dog they’re 
watching, and they will receive a personalized video 
(Rover Reel) of the dog’s stay to share with the owner.
growth plans & venture capital
Rover.com’s potential has garnered plenty of attention. 
In 2013, the company increased its revenue by 800 per-
cent and currently has about 200,000 dog owners listed 
on its site. Incredibly, as of January 2014, the 43-person 
company had raised $25 million in funding from top-
shelf venture capital firms and pet retailer PetCo. The 
numbers in the pet industry are staggering. Americans 
spent $53 billion on their pets in 2012. Currently, there 
are roughly 78 million dogs in the United States (this 
number is an all-time high).
In light of these statistics and what it has learned 
in its three years of existence, Rover.com has a three-
prong growth strategy, as follows:
1. Spread geographically, including in international markets.
2. Provide new services, including dog grooming and dog 
walking.
3. Add other animals, such as cats, horses, and reptiles.
Rover.com’s CEO Aaron Easterly, a passionate dog 
lover, believes the company is only a fraction of the size 
it can become.
Discussion Questions
 2-37. In the United States, what environmental trends 
are supporting the development of Rover.com’s 
business?
 2-38. How might Rover.com use focus groups to gain a 
better understanding of its current and potential 
 customers and their needs?
 2-39. In this chapter, we noted that a true business oppor-
tunity is attractive, durable, timely, and anchored in a 
product or service that creates value for a buyer. To 
what extent does Rover.com’s service satisfy each of 
these criteria?

t 4:53 p.m. on January 12, 2010, Haiti experienced a devastating earthquake. 
The epicenter of the 7.0 magnitude quake was near Leogane, approximately 16 
miles west of Port-au-Prince, Haiti’s capital and largest city. The Haitian govern-
ment later reported that 316,000 people were killed, 300,000 were 
injured, and approximately 1 million were left homeless.
Two weeks later in New York City, Anna Stork and Andrea Sreshta, 
master’s in architecture students at Columbia University, were tasked 
with a project to design solutions for disaster relief aid as part of 
their design studio course. In the nearby photo, Andrea Sreshta is on 
the left and Anna Stork is on the right. Design studio courses within 
Columbia’s architecture school are open ended and without prescrip-
tive assignments, and students are given the freedom to define and 
execute their projects to a large degree. Both Stork and Sreshta were 
deeply affected by the Haiti earthquake, and decided to focus their 
project on redesigning disaster relief aid to better serve people in 
emergency situations. They had read and heard about the danger-
ous conditions in the tent cities erected in Haiti to provide shelter for 
homeless people. It occurred to them that light—something we take 
for granted—is often unavailable in emergency situations. They also 
learned that more broadly, 1.6 billion people across the globe lack ac-
cess to reliable electricity. Many of these people use kerosene lanterns 
to light their homes. This is dangerous, in that kerosene lamps are a 
fire hazard and produce toxic fumes.
The convergence of these two factors led Stork and Sreshta to 
the idea for their project—something they nicknamed the “solar pil-
low.” The idea was to create a simple, affordable source of light that 
could be easily and affordably shipped to disaster locations. As part 
of their research, Stork and Sreshta looked at the small-scale solar products currently 
on the market. There were many, which prompted them to ask the question “Is there a 
need for another product in the mix?” The answer ultimately was yes, largely because 
many of the existing products, while useful, could not be easily and affordably shipped 
to disaster locations. Stork and Sreshta’s solution was an inflatable plastic bag, about 
the size of a small pillow, that had a rectangular pouch in the middle. The pouch con-
tained a solar panel, three LEDs, and a rechargeable battery. When inflated, the bag 
became a diffuser for the LED light. Because the solar pillow was inflatable, it packs 
and ships flat. That provides it an advantage, particularly in a disaster situation. For

every eight flashlights packed in a box, a total of 50 solar pillows could be placed into 
the same container. once set in the sun for a few hours, the solar pillow could produce 
a substantial amount of reliable light.
A second factor that was part of Stork and Sreshta’s thinking is a principle they called 
“here and there.” The same product—the solar pillow—could be used by someone who 
is camping or pursuing any form of outdoor recreation as easily as someone in a disaster 
situation or a developing country using the solar pillow as an alternative to a kerosene 
lantern. That facet of the device provided the solar pillow a more robust market than a 
product designed exclusively for a disaster situation or to be used in developing countries.
The design studio class eventually ended, but Stork and Sreshta couldn’t let go of 
the solar pillow idea. Through the summer and fall of 2010, they entered their idea, now 
called LuminAID, into several business plan competitions. They also shipped 50 early 
prototypes of the device to places like Haiti, ghana, and Nicaragua for feedback and 
advice. They continued to work on the device while finishing school. During that time, 
the initial prototype evolved to reduce the cost, make it more durable, and brighten 
the light. In November 2011, Stork and Sreshta launched an Indiegogo crowdfunding 
campaign titled “LuminAID: An Inflatable Solar Light.” The campaign included a short 
2-minute, 51-second video that explained the device and the entrepreneurs’ passion 
to bring it to market. If you’d like to see the video and hear directly from Stork and 
Sreshta, simply go to Indiegogo.com and type in the search bar “LuminAID.” The goal 
of the Indiegogo campaign was threefold: test interest and demand for the device, raise 
money for the initial product run (assuming sufficient interest existed), and get feedback 
and advice. one thing that is helpful about running an Indiegogo campaign (the same 
is true for Kickstarter) is that anyone can write a comment about the campaign, during 
and after the campaign is concluded. Stork and Sreshta’s campaign generated over 
500 comments, some of which were helpful to them in tweaking the LuminAid device. 
The campaign was a hit, raising $51,829, more than five times the original goal. Stork 
and Sreshta were not only heartened by the overall response, but were pleased to see 
pledges come in from several developing countries. The pledges from the developing 
countries, in particular, affirmed in their minds the potential for their device.
Stork and Sreshta managed a successful production run of the LuminAid device 
and fulfilled their Indiegogo commitments. They used the shipping of the devices as 
another opportunity to obtain feedback. The e-mail they posted on Indiegogo when the 
devices were shipped was addressed to “Dear Friends.” In part, the e-mail said “When 
you receive the light, we would greatly value your feedback. This is our first manufactur-
ing run and your comments will help us to improve the product and develop additional 
products. Please e-mail us at info@luminAIDlab.com with questions or suggestions.” 
After providing instructions on how to use the LuminAID device, the e-mail ended with: 
“We included instructions with each LuminAID. Feel free to email us if you have any 
questions and don’t forget to send us pictures and stories of the LuminAID in use.”
The Indiegogo campaign concluded in late 2012, and the devices were shipped in 
early 2013 to over 25 countries! LuminAID is now moving forward, but at a measured 
pace. Stork is working on LuminAID full time, and at the time this feature was written, 
March 2014, Sreshta was an MBA student at the University of Chicago Booth School 
of Business. Upon graduation, she plans to work on LuminAID full time. The LuminAID 
device is now available via the company’s website, Amazon.com, LLBean, and several 
similar outlets. Stork and Sreshta have and are continuing to establish partnerships 
with relief agencies to utilize the LuminAID solution in disaster situations and in devel-
oping countries.

CHAPTER 3 | FEASIBILITY AnAlysis    99
I
n this chapter, we’ll discuss the importance of feasibility analysis. Conducting 
a well-crafted feasibility analysis, prior to developing a business model, is a 
critical step in discerning the merits of a business idea. The front cover of this 
book, along with the pages that introduce each of the four parts of the book, in-
clude a depiction of three children in a developing country utilizing a LuminAID 
device. Note the sense of wonder on their faces. The devices provide a surprising 
amount of light given their relatively simple design and attractive price-point.
Feasibility analysis
Feasibility analysis is the process of determining if a business idea is viable 
(see Figure 3.1). If a business idea falls short on one or more of the four compo-
nents of feasibility analysis, it should be dropped or rethought, as shown in the 
figure. Many entrepreneurs make the mistake of identifying a business idea and 
then jumping directly to developing a business model (see Chapter 4) to describe 
and gain support for the idea. This sequence often omits or provides little time 
for the important step of testing the feasibility of a business idea.
A mental transition must be made when completing a feasibility analysis 
from thinking of a business idea as just an idea to thinking of it as a business. 
A feasibility analysis is an assessment of a potential business rather than 
strictly a product or service idea. The sequential nature of the steps shown in 
Figure 3.1 cleanly separates the investigative portion of thinking through the 
merits of a business idea from the planning and selling portion of the process. 
Feasibility analysis is investigative in nature and is designed to critique the 
merits of a proposed business. A business plan (see Chapter 6) is more focused 
on planning and selling. The reason it’s important to complete the entire pro-
cess, according to John W. Mullins, the author of the highly regarded book The 
New Business Road Test, is to avoid falling into the “everything about my op-
portunity is wonderful” mode. In Mullins’s view, failure to properly investigate 
the merits of a business idea before developing a business model and a busi-
ness plan is written runs the risk of blinding an entrepreneur to inherent risks 
associated with the potential business and results in too positive of a plan.1
This chapter provides a methodology for conducting a feasibility analysis 
by describing its four key areas: product/service feasibility, industry/target 
market feasibility, organizational feasibility, and financial feasibility. We intro-
duce supplemental material in two appendixes to the chapter. Appendix 3.1 
contains a tool called First Screen, which is a template for completing a feasi-
bility analysis. Appendix 3.2 contains an Internet Resource Table that provides 
information on Internet resources that are helpful in completing First Screen.
An outline for the approach to feasibility analysis we describe in this chapter 
is provided in Table 3.1. Completing a feasibility analysis requires both primary

and secondary research. Primary research is research that is collected by the 
person or persons completing the analysis. It normally includes talking to pro-
spective customers, getting feedback from industry experts, conducting focus 
groups, and administering surveys. Secondary research probes data that is 
already collected. The data generally includes industry studies, Census Bureau 
data, analyst forecasts, and other pertinent information gleaned through li-
brary and Internet research. The Internet Resource Table in Appendix 3.2 is 
useful for conducting secondary research.
It should be emphasized that while a feasibility analysis tests the merits of 
a specific idea, it allows ample opportunity for the idea to be revised, altered, 
and changed as a result of the feedback that is obtained and the analysis that 
is conducted. The key objective behind feasibility analysis is to put an idea 
to the test—by eliciting feedback from potential customers, talking to indus-
try experts, studying industry trends, thinking through the financials, and 
scrutinizing it in other ways. These types of activities not only help determine 
whether an idea is feasible but also help shape and mold the idea.
Now let’s turn our attention to the four areas of feasibility analysis. The 
first area we’ll discuss is product/service feasibility.
product/service Feasibility analysis
Product/service feasibility analysis is an assessment of the overall appeal of 
the product or service being proposed. Although there are many important things 
to consider when launching a new venture, nothing else matters if the product or 
service itself doesn’t sell. There are two components to product/service feasibility 
analysis: product/service desirability and product/service demand.
product/Service desirability
The first component of product/service feasibility is to affirm that the pro-
posed product or service is desirable and serves a need in the marketplace.

CHAPTER 3 | FEASIBILITY AnAlysis    101
You should ask yourself, and others, the following questions to determine the 
basic appeal of the product or service:
■ Does it make sense? Is it reasonable? Is it something real customers 
will buy?
■ Does it take advantage of an environmental trend, solve a problem, or fill 
a gap in the marketplace?
■ Is this a good time to introduce the product or service to the market?
■ Are there any fatal flaws in the product or service’s basic design or concept?
The proper mind-set at the feasibility analysis stage is to get a general 
sense of the answers to these and similar questions, rather than to try to reach 
final conclusions. The best way to achieve this is to “get out of the building” 
and talk to potential customers. This sentiment is the primary mantra of the 
lean startup movement, referred to in more detail in Chapter 6. A tool that is 
particularly useful in soliciting feedback and advice from prospective custom-
ers is to administer a concept test.
Concept Test  A concept test involves showing a preliminary description of 
a product or service idea, called a concept statement, to industry experts and 
prospective customers to solicit their feedback. It is a one-page document that 
normally includes the following:
■ A description of the product or service. This section details the features of 
the product or service; many include a sketch of it as well.
■ The intended target market. This section lists the consumers or busi-
nesses who are expected to buy the product or service.
■ The benefits of the product or service. This section describes the benefits 
of the product or service and includes an account of how the product or 
service adds value and/or solves a problem.
one of the most effective 
techniques for discerning 
the feasibility of a product 
or service idea is to get 
out and talk to prospec-

After the concept statement is developed, it should be shown to at least 20 
people who are familiar with the industry that the firm plans to enter and who 
can provide informed feedback. The temptation to show it to family members 
and friends should be avoided because these people are predisposed to give 
positive feedback. Instead, it should be distributed to people who will provide 
candid and informed feedback and advice.
The concept statement for a fictitious company named New Venture Fitness 
Drinks is provided in Figure 3.2. New Venture Fitness Drinks sells a line of 
nutritious fitness drinks and targets sports enthusiasts. Its strategy is to place 
small restaurants, similar to smoothie restaurants, near large sports complexes. 
It is important to keep a concept statement relatively short (no more than one 
page) to increase the likelihood that it will be read. The concept statement is 
followed by a short buying intentions survey. The information gleaned from the 
survey should be tabulated and carefully read. If time permits, the statement 
can be used in an iterative manner to strengthen the product or service idea. For 
example, you might show the statement to a group of prospective customers, 
receive their feedback, tweak the idea, show it to a second group of customers, 
tweak the idea some more, and so on.
Product
New Venture Fitness Drinks will sell delicious, nutrition-filled, all-natural fitness drinks
to thirsty sports enthusiasts. The drinks will be sold through small storefronts (600 sq.
ft.) that will be the same size as popular smoothie restaurants. The drinks were formulated
by Dr. William Peters, a world-renowned nutritionist, and Dr. Michelle Smith, a sports
medicine specialist, on behalf of New Venture Fitness Drinks and its customers.
Target Market
In the first three years of operation, New Venture Fitness Drinks plans to open three or
four restaurants. They will all be located near large sports complexes that contain soccer
fields and softball diamonds. The target market is sports enthusiasts.
Why New Venture Fitness Drinks?
The industry for sports drinks continues to grow. New Venture Fitness Drinks will introduce
exciting new sports drinks that will be priced between $1.50 and $2.50 per 16-ounce
serving. Energy bars and other over-the-counter sports snacks will also be sold.
Each restaurant will contain comfortable tables and chairs (both inside and outside)
where sports enthusiasts can congregate after a game. The atmosphere will be fun,
cheerful, and uplifting.
Special Feature—No Other Restaurant Does This
As a special feature, New Venture Fitness Drinks will videotape select sporting events
that take place in the sports complexes nearest its restaurants and will replay highlights
of the games on video monitors in their restaurants. The “highlight” film will be a 30-
minute film that will play continuously from the previous day’s sporting events. This
special feature will allow sports enthusiasts, from kids playing soccer to adults in softball
leagues, to drop in and see themselves and their teammates on television.
Management Team
New Venture Fitness Drink is led by its cofounders, Jack Petty and Peggy Wills. Jack has
16 years of experience with a national restaurant chain, and Peggy is a certified public
accountant with seven years of experience at a Big 4 accounting firm.

CHAPTER 3 | FEASIBILITY AnAlysis    103
The problem with not talking to potential customers prior to starting a 
business is that it’s hard to know if a product is sufficiently desirable based 
simply on gut instinct or secondary research. A common reason new busi-
nesses fail is that there isn’t a large enough market for the venture’s product. 
This scenario played out for Matt Cooper, who was a partner in a business 
called Soggy Bottom Canoe and Kayak Rental. It was his first start-up and 
turned out to be, as Cooper put it, an “unmitigated disaster.” Cooper and his 
partner owned 10 acres near a national forest in Mississippi, where they de-
cided to launch a canoe rental business. They invested heavily in finishing out 
the facilities on the property and bought 32 canoes, 16 kayaks, 4 trailers, and 
2 vans. They opened on a July 4th weekend and everything was immaculate. 
The following is what happened, in Cooper’s words:
“In our quest to have the best facilities and equipment, we neglected to speak to 
a single prospective customer. No Boy Scout troops, no church youth groups, no 
fraternities from Southern Mississippi University. As a result, I can count on only 
one hand the number of times, in the seven years that we owned the business, 
that we reached even half of our booking capacity.2
Cooper goes on to admit that he’s learned his lesson. Reflecting on his 
Soggy Bottom Canoe and Kayak Rental experience he said:
“Today, I still fight against the urge to make big investments before we’ve “beta 
tested.” Every time that urge pops up, I picture gleaming new canoes hitched up 
to sad empty passenger vans.”3
Rather than developing a formal concept statement, some entrepreneurs 
conduct their initial product/service feasibility analysis by simply talking 
through their ideas with prospective customers or conducting focus groups 
to solicit feedback. The ideal combination is to do both—distribute a concept 
statement to 20 or more people who can provide informed feedback and engage 
in verbal give-and-take with as many industry experts and prospective custom-
ers as possible. There are also a growing number of online tools that help entre-
preneurs quickly and inexpensively make contact with prospective customers 
and complete other steps in the feasibility analysis process. These tools range 
from services like Quirky, which provides direct feedback on product ideas, to 
3D printing services like Shapeways, which converts CAD drawings of product 
ideas into physical prototypes that you can show to potential customers. We 
provide a sample of the online tools that are available in Table 3.2.

CHAPTER 3 | FEASIBILITY AnAlysis    105
product/Service demand
The second component of product/service feasibility analysis is to determine if 
there is demand for the product or service. Three commonly utilized methods 
for doing this include (1) talking face-to-face with potential customers, (2) utiliz-
ing online tools, such as Google Adwords and landing pages, to assess demand, 
and (3) library, Internet, and gumshoe research.
Talking Face-to-Face with Potential Customers  The only way to know 
if your product or service is what people want is by talking to them. Curiously, 
this often doesn’t happen. One study of 120 business founders revealed that 
more than half fully developed their products without getting feedback from 
potential buyers.4 In hindsight, most viewed it as a mistake. The authors of the 
study quoted one of the participants as saying “You’ll learn more from talking 
to five customers than you will from hours of market research (at a computer).” 
The idea is to gauge customer reaction to the general concept of what you want 
to sell. Entrepreneurs are often surprised to find out that a product idea that 
they think solves a compelling problem gets a lukewarm reception when they 
talk to actual customers.
In some instances, you have to pause and think carefully about who the 
potential customer is. For example, in health care the “customer” is typically 
not the patient who will use the drugs or benefit from a medical procedure. 
Instead the actual customer, or the entity that will be paying the bill, is often 
an insurance company, hospital, or Medicare or Medicaid. You should also 
talk to as many of the relevant players in an industry as possible. Sometimes 
this involves a complex list of people, but it is necessary to fully vet the initial 
feasibility of an idea. For example, say you were thinking about launching an 
innovative new type of home health care service. The service would allow elderly 
people to stay in their homes longer before going into assisted living or a nurs-
ing home, and it would help people remember to take their medicine on time 
and provide other health care monitoring services. Table 3.3 contains a list of 
the categories of people that you might want to talk to as part of your product/
service feasibility analysis. While the list is long, imagine the rich insight that 
you could get on your business idea from people in these categories.
Table 3.3  Categories of people to talk to as part of product/service

106    PART 2 | DEvELoPINg SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS IDEAS
One approach to finding qualified people to talk to about a product or ser-
vice idea or to react to a concept statement is to contact trade associations 
and/or attend industry trade shows. If your product idea is in the digital me-
dia space, for example, you may be able to call the Digital Media Association 
(which is a national trade association devoted primarily to the online audio 
and video industries) and get a list of members who live in your area. Attending 
trade shows in the industry you’re interested in will place you in direct contact 
with numerous people who might be of assistance. A website that provides a 
directory of trade associations is included in the Internet Resource Table in 
Appendix 3.2. Online surveys are also useful to reach a large number of people 
quickly. Services such as SurveyMonkey and AYTM are making it increasingly 
easy to survey specific target markets and receive detailed analytics for a very 
affordable price.
utilizing Online Tools, Such as google adWords and landing Pages, 
to assess Demand  Another common approach to assessing product de-
mand is to use online tools, such as Google AdWords and landing pages. The 
way this works is as follows. Suppose you’ve developed a new type of sunglasses 
for snowboarders and want to assess likely demand. One way of doing this is to 
buy keywords on the Google search page like “snowboarding” and “sunglasses.” 
You can purchase the keywords through Google’s AdWords program. Once you 
buy the keywords, when someone searches for the term “snowboarding” or 
“sunglasses” a link to an ad you’ve prepared will show up either at the top or to 
the right of the organic search results. The text below the link will say something 
such as “Innovative new sunglasses for snowboarders.” If someone clicks on the 
link, they’ll be taken to what online marketers call a landing page. A landing 
page is a single Web page that typically provides direct sales copy, like “click 
here to buy a Hawaiian vacation.” Your landing page, which can be inexpen-
sively produced through a company like LaunchRock (see Table 3.2), will show 
an artist’s depiction of your innovative new sunglasses, provide a brief explana-
tion, and will then say something like “Coming Soon—Please Enter Your E-mail 
Address for Updates.” How often your ad appears will depend on what you 
purchase through Google’s automated AdWord’s keyword auction. Google will 
provide you analytics regarding how many people click on the ad and how many 
follow through and provide their e-mail address. You can also capture the e-mail 
addresses that are provided.
The beauty of using Google AdWords is that the people who click on the 
ad were either searching for the term “snowboarding” or “sunglasses” or they 
wouldn’t have seen the ad. So you’re eliciting responses from a self-selected 
group of potential buyers. The overarching purpose is to get a sense of inter-
est in your product. If, over a three-day period, 10,000 people click on the ad 
and 4,000 provide their e-mail address to you, that might signal a fairly strong 
interest in the product. On the other hand, if only 500 people click on the ad 
and 50 give you their e-mail address, that’s a much less affirming response. 
It’s strictly a judgment call regarding how many clicks represent an encourag-
ing response to your product idea. Normally, utilizing an AdWords and landing 
page campaign wouldn’t be the only thing you’d do to assess demand. You’d 
still want to talk to prospective customers face-to-face, as discussed earlier. 
Running an AdWords and landing page campaign is, however, a practical and 
often surprisingly affordable way to get another data point in regard to assess-
ing demand for a new product or service idea.
library, internet, and gumshoe research  The third way to assess 
demand for a product or service idea is by conducting library, Internet, and 
gumshoe research. While talking to prospective customers is critical, collect-
ing secondary data on an industry is also helpful. For example, Spring Toys 
makes super-safe, environmentally friendly, educational toys for children. 

CHAPTER 3 | FEASIBILITY AnAlysis    107
Sounds like a good idea. But “sounds like a good idea,” as mentioned in previ-
ous sections, isn’t enough. We need feedback from prospective customers and 
industry-related data to make sure. Industry-related data can help us answer 
the following types of questions: What’s the trajectory of the toy industry? 
What do industry experts say are the most important factors that parents con-
sider when they buy their children toys? Is there an “educational toy” segment 
within the larger toy industry? If so, is this segment growing or shrinking? Is 
there a trade association for the makers of educational toys that already has 
statistics about the market demand for educational toys?
The overarching point is that for your particular product or service you 
need archival as well as primary forms of research to assess likely demand. 
Your university or college library is a good place to start, and the Internet is a 
marvelous resource. The Internet Resource Table in Appendix 3.2 provides spe-
cific recommendations of online resources to utilize. For example, IBISWorld, 
which is available for free through most university libraries, provides current 
industry reports on hundreds of industries. Its report on the toy industry, 
which is frequently updated, is titled “Toy, Doll and Game Manufacturing in 
the US (NAICS 33993).” This report would be a good place to start in terms of 
understanding relevant industry trends. More general Internet research is also 
often helpful. Simply typing a query into the Google or Bing search bar such as 
“market demand for educational toys” will often produce helpful articles and 
industry reports.
Simple gumshoe research is also important for gaining a sense of the likely 
demand for a product or service idea. A gumshoe is a detective or an investiga-
tor that scrounges around for information or clues wherever they can be found. 
Don’t be bashful. Ask people what they think about your product or service 
idea. If your idea is to sell educational toys, spend a week volunteering at a day 
care center and watch how children interact with toys. Take the owner of a toy 
store to lunch and discuss your ideas. Spend some time browsing through toy 
stores and observe the types of toys that get the most attention. If you actually 
launch a business, there is simply too much at stake to rely on gut instincts 
and cursory information to assure you that your product or service will sell. 
Collect as much information as you can within reasonable time constraints.
The importance of library, Internet, and gumshoe research doesn’t wane 
once a firm is launched. It’s important to continually assess the strength of 
product or service ideas and learn from users. A colorful example of the value 
of ongoing gumshoe research is provided in the “Savvy Entrepreneurial Firm” 
feature. In this feature, a successful company made a 180-degree turn regard-
ing how to position a particular product simply by watching how customers 
interacted with the product in retail stores.
industry/target Market Feasibility 
analysis
Industry/target market feasibility is an assessment of the overall appeal of 
the industry and the target market for the product or service being proposed. 
There is a distinct difference between a firm’s industry and its target market; 
having a clear understanding of this difference is important. An industry is a 
group of firms producing a similar product or service, such as computers, chil-
dren’s toys, airplanes, or social networks. A firm’s target market is the limited 
portion of the industry that it goes after or to which it wants to appeal. Most 
firms, and certainly entrepreneurial start-ups, typically do not try to service an 
entire industry. Instead, they select or carve out a specific target market and 
try to service that group of customers particularly well. Sprig Toys, for exam-
ple, is not trying to target the entire children’s toy industry. Its target market

ill gross is both a serial entrepreneur and the 
founder of Idealab, an incubator-type organization 
that has launched over 75 companies. He’s also 
an Internet pioneer and the creator of the pay-per-click 
model of Internet advertising. In speaking to groups 
about entrepreneurship and in working with start-ups at 
Idealab, there is a story that gross likes to tell about the 
importance of feasibility analysis and getting close to 
customers. It’s an experience that has shaped his views 
about how important it is to learn from the potential us-
ers of your product.
In the early 1990s gross started a software com-
pany named Knowledge Adventure. It started by mak-
ing educational CD-RoM products for children, such as 
Space Adventure and Dinosaur Adventure. The firm also 
launched a line of products under the JumpStart brand. 
These products help kids with topics they encounter in 
school, such as math and science.
one Christmas, in the early 1990s, gross really 
wanted his company to excel, so he decided to have 
employees spend weekends in places where Knowledge 
Adventure products were sold, to demo the products to 
parents and hopefully boost sales. So the company’s 
65 employees took turns traveling to electronics stores, 
where they would set up booths at the end of aisles to 
demo their firm’s products. Each Monday, following a 
weekend when employees were in stores, the employ-
ees met to talk about their experiences. one interesting 
theme emerged from these meetings. When looking 
at educational software products, parents were often 
confused about whether a particular product was age-
appropriate for their child. They would often look at the 
back of the box (software was sold on CDs in boxes in 
those days), look at their child, look back at the box, 
and appear puzzled about whether the software was a 
good match for their child. Many companies, Knowledge 
Adventure included, would put wide age ranges on their 
products to broaden their appeal. Apparently, this prac-
tice inadvertently caused parents to wonder whether a 
product with a wide age range was really a good match 
for their particular child.
Thinking through what the employees had ob-
served, gross and his team came up with a novel idea. 
What if they produced educational software products 
that were targeted for a specific grade—like one for 
preschoolers, one for kindergarteners, one for first 
grade students, and so forth, to try to avoid confusion 
for parents trying to determine if a product was age-
appropriate for their child. gross remembers that there 
was a big fight in his company over this idea. The sales 
force said, “We can’t convince stores to sell software 
for one age group. They’ll never sell enough product.” 
After listening to all the arguments, gross concluded 
it was worth a try. So Knowledge Adventure created 
JumpStart Pre-School and JumpStart Kindergarten to 
test the concept. The result: The products sold 20 to 
50 times the company’s other products. Parents loved 
it—now they knew exactly what product was right 
for their child. There was even an aspirational qual-
ity to the products. Parents would see a product like 
JumpStart Kindergarten and buy it for their preschool 
child hoping to give them a head start in kindergarten. 
Knowledge Adventure has sold over 20 million copies 
of its grade-specific JumpStart products, and they are 
still for sale today.
What gross likes to emphasize when telling this story 
is that he and his team would have never discovered 
the confusion that parents had in trying to determine if 
particular software products were age-appropriate for 
their children without directly observing them in stores. 
As a result of this experience, gross is now a passionate 
advocate of start-ups directly interacting with potential 
users of their products.
Questions for Critical Thinking
 1. In putting wide age ranges on their products (e.g., 
suitable for ages 4 through 7), do you think that soft-
ware companies prior to the advent of JumpStart’s 
grade-specific products ever thought that the wide 
age range caused parents angst in trying to deter-
mine if a particular product was suitable for their 
child? If your answer is “no,” how could companies 
have missed such a fundamental factor? What is the 
broader implication of this lesson?
 2. Could gross and his team have gleaned the same 
type of insights they gained via directly observing 
parents shopping for educational software for their 
kids through surveys and focus groups? Explain your 
answer.
 3. Design a program for August Smart Lock, the subject 
of the “You Be the vC 3.1” feature, to directly observe 
its customers use its service. How should August 
Smart Lock go about it? What type of insights might 
emerge from this initiative?
 4. How can a start-up that hasn’t already launched ap-
ply the lessons learned from gross’s experience with 
JumpStart and grade-specific software products?

is parents who are willing to pay a premium for super-safe, environmentally 
friendly, educational toys.
There are two components to industry/target market feasibility analysis: 
industry attractiveness and target market attractiveness.
industry Attractiveness
Industries vary in terms of their overall attractiveness.5 In general, the most at-
tractive industries have the characteristics depicted in Table 3.4. The top three 
factors are particularly important. Industries that are young rather than old, 
are early rather than late in their life cycle, and are fragmented rather than con-
centrated are more receptive to new entrants than industries with the opposite 
characteristics. You also want to pick an industry that is structurally  attractive—
meaning start-ups can enter the industry (in various target markets) and com-
pete effectively. Some industries are characterized by such high barriers to entry 
or the presence of one or two dominant players that potential new entrants are 
essentially shut out.
Information  pertaining 
to industry growth rates, 
trends, and future pros-
pects is available via 
 online databases like 
the one accessed here. 
IBISWorld and BizMiner 
are additional databases 
that provide particularly 
helpful information.
Table 3.4  Characteristics of attractive industries
■ Are young rather than old
■ Are early rather than late in their life cycle
■ Are fragmented rather than concentrated
■ Are growing rather than shrinking
■ Are selling products or services that customers “must have” rather than “want to have”
■ Are not crowded
■ Have high rather than low operating margins
■ Are not highly dependent on the historically low price of a key raw material, like gasoline 
or flour, to remain profitable

110    PART 2 | DEvELoPINg SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS IDEAS
Other factors are also important. For example, the degree to which environ-
mental and business trends are moving in favor rather than against the indus-
try are important for the industry’s long-term health and its capacity to spawn 
new target or niche markets. Are changing economic and societal trends helping 
or hurting industry incumbents? Are profit margins increasing or falling? Is in-
novation accelerating or waning? Are input costs going up or down? Are new 
markets for the industry’s staple products opening up or are current markets 
being shut down by competing industries? You can’t cover every facet of an in-
dustry, but you should gain a sense of whether the industry you’re entering is a 
good one or a poor one for start-ups.
Information that addresses each of these issues is available via industry 
reports published by IBISWorld, Mintel, Bizminer, and similar fee-based da-
tabases that are typically free if accessed through a university or large public 
library’s website. These resources are listed in the Internet Resource Table 
in Appendix 3.2. The First Screen, which is the feasibility analysis template 
included in Appendix 3.1, includes a section that draws attention to the most 
important issues to focus on regarding industry attractiveness during the fea-
sibility analysis stage of investigating a business idea.
target Market Attractiveness
We noted previously that a target market is a place within a larger market seg-
ment that represents a narrower group of customers with similar needs. Most 
start-ups simply don’t have the resources needed to participate in a broad mar-
ket, at least initially. Instead, by focusing on a smaller target market, a firm can 
usually avoid head-to-head competition with industry leaders and can focus on 
serving a specialized market very well. It’s also not realistic, in most cases, for a 
start-up to introduce a completely original product idea into a completely new 
market. In most instances, it’s just too expensive to be a pioneer in each area. 
Most successful start-ups either introduce a new product into an existing market 
(like Sprig Toys introducing new toys into the existing toy market) or introduce a 
new market to an existing product (like Wello is introducing Web-based, real-time 
fitness instruction, which is a new market for an existing product offered by per-
sonal trainers, yoga instructors, etc.).
The challenge in identifying an attractive target market is to find a market 
that’s large enough for the proposed business but yet is small enough to avoid 
attracting larger competitors at least until the entrepreneurial venture can get 
off to a successful start. Tommy John, a maker of men’s undershirts, is an 
example of a company that has targeted a market that meets these criteria. 
Tommy John began in 2008 by making custom-fitted men’s undershirts, and 
has now expanded to men’s briefs and men’s socks. The undershirts are sold 
under the brand name Second Skin, based on the idea that they fit so well they 
feel like a “second skin” when worn. Tommy John started by selling through a 
single retailer and eventually persuaded Neiman Marcus to give its undershirts 
a try. Today, Tommy John undershirts are sold in Neiman Marcus stores 
nationwide and are making their way into other retailers as well. Although 
Tommy John operates in the worldwide market for men’s undershirts, it has 
carved out a specialized target or niche market for itself and is gaining momen-
tum. One key to its success is that it has remained laser-focused on a clearly 
defined target market. The number one question the company gets is “when 
will it start producing women’s undergarments?” So far it’s resisted, preferring 
to remain focused on its Second Skin line of men’s undershirts.6
While it’s generally easy to find good information to assess the attractive-
ness of an entire industry, discerning the attractiveness of a small target 
market within an industry is tougher, particularly if the start-up is pioneering 
the target market. Often, under these circumstances, information from more 
than one industry and/or market must be collected and synthesized to make 

CHAPTER 3 | FEASIBILITY AnAlysis    111
an informed judgment. For example, say you were developing new, innovative 
sunglasses for snowboarders, consistent with the illustration provided earlier. 
The question for a product like this is what market to assess? Obviously, a 
combination of markets must be studied, including the market for sunglasses 
and the market for snowboarding. It would be important to not only know how 
well sunglasses are selling but whether the market for snowboarding acces-
sories (and the number of people who participate in snowboarding) is on the 
rise or decline. If the market for sunglasses is on an upward trajectory but the 
market for snowboarding accessories is on a sharp decline, the target market 
you would be pursuing would be much less attractive than if both markets 
were on the rise.
A failure to fully understand both the broad HR/recruitment industry and 
the specific markets it was targeting contributed to the problems encountered 
by Standout Jobs, a company that developed an innovative recruitment portal in 
2008. The Standout Jobs story, which is rich in lessons about the importance of 
feasibility analysis, is included in the nearby “What Went Wrong” feature.
Organizational Feasibility analysis
Organizational feasibility analysis is conducted to determine whether a 
proposed business has sufficient management expertise, organizational com-
petence, and resources to successfully launch.7 There are two primary issues 
to consider in this area: management prowess and resource sufficiency.
Management prowess
A proposed business should evaluate the prowess, or ability, of its initial man-
agement team, whether it is a sole entrepreneur or a larger group.8 This task 
requires the individuals starting the firm to be honest and candid in their self-
assessments. Two of the most important factors in this area are the passion 
that the solo entrepreneur or the management team has for the business idea 
and the extent to which the management team or solo entrepreneur under-
stands the markets in which the firm will participate.9 There are no practical 
substitutes for strengths in these areas.10
A collection of additional factors help define management prowess. Managers 
with extensive professional and social networks have an advantage in that they 
are able to reach out to colleagues and friends to help them plug experience 
or knowledge gaps. In addition, a potential new venture should have an idea 
of the type of new-venture team that it can assemble. A new-venture team is 
the group of founders, key employees, and advisers that either manage or help 
manage a new business in its start-up years. If the founder or founders of a new 
venture have identified several individuals they believe will join the firm after 
it is launched and these individuals are highly capable, that knowledge lends 
credibility to the organizational feasibility of the potential venture. The same ra-
tionale applies for highly capable people a new venture believes would be willing 
to join its board of directors or board of advisers.
One thing that many potential business founders find while assessing 
management prowess is that they may benefit from finding one or more part-
ners to help them launch their business. Tips for finding an appropriate busi-
ness partner are provided in the “Partnering for Success” feature.
resource Sufficiency
The second area of organizational feasibility analysis is to determine whether 
the proposed venture has or is capable of obtaining sufficient resources to 
move forward. The focus in organizational feasibility analysis is on nonfinancial 
learning ObjeCtive

t
he idea for Standout Jobs emerged in 2007, when 
its founders, Ben Yoskovitz, Fred Ngo, and Austin 
Hill, saw an opportunity to revitalize the job recruit-
ment process. At the time, most companies recruited by 
placing static position descriptions on job boards and 
hoping for the best. The idea behind Standout Jobs was 
to create more energy in the recruitment process. To do 
that, Standout Jobs built a customizable recruitment plat-
form, named RECEPTIoN, that enabled companies to 
showcase their culture and team to job candidates. The 
platform was built on social media tools, such as video, 
blogs, and a variety of widgets, to make the recruting 
process dynamic and engaging, and help the company’s 
clients “stand out” from the competition.
Standout Jobs launched at the DEMo conference in 
early 2008. It raised $1.58 million in venture funding and 
picked up some early traction. It also seemed to have 
substantial upside potential. In early 2008, one of its 
initial investors, John Elton, partner with iNovia Capital, 
made the following remarks about Standout Jobs: “We 
believe in the team and Standout Jobs’ market potential 
because they are changing the way companies recruit 
great employees.” Elton went on to observe that at the 
time, the recruitment sector represented about one-
fourth of all online advertising, and that many companies 
were dissatisfied with the results they were getting. 
Standout Jobs, in Elton’s opinion, helped companies ap-
proach online recruiting in a fresh and promising manner.
In 2010, Standout Jobs was sold to Talent Technology, 
another recruitment company. It wasn’t a financial suc-
cess. After the sale, one of Standout Jobs’ founders, Ben 
Yoskovitz, wrote a thoughtful blog post on why Standout 
Jobs essentially failed, and the lessons he took away 
from his Standout Jobs experience. Yoskovitz highlighted 
five reasons, several of which are directly related to the 
need to complete a thorough feasibility analysis before a 
company launches.
First, the company’s timing was bad. The company 
launched in 2008, just before the U.S. economy went 
sour. Most companies weren’t hiring. In fact, Yoskovitz 
said that he got feedback on sales calls like this: “That’s 
a great product, really love it, but we won’t be hiring for 
another 18 months or so. You have anything to help us 
fire people?” obviously, Standout Jobs couldn’t help that 
the economy turned sour, but in retrospect, Yoskovitz 
feels that the company didn’t react fast enough. When 
things weren’t working, he didn’t sound alarm bells, and 
the company continued doing what it was doing.
Second, Yoskovitz believes that prior to launch, 
he didn’t have a strong enough understanding of the 
HR/recuritment market. He indicated that he looked 
at the market and thought he could fix it, only to find 
out that when he was in neck-deep there were a lot 
of issues that he didn’t understand. He did do a lot of 
networking in the industry and brand building among 
industry evangelists. But that can create a false sense 
of success, Yoskovitz now believes. Indusry evangelists 
aren’t necessarily buyers. It’s important to do as much 
homework as possible, he now urges, about an industry 
upfront, before you launch a company.
Third, Yoskovitz feels that his team didn’t get its prod-
uct in the hands of customers fast enough and iterate 
based on their feedback. It’s easier, Yoskovitz learned, to 
build a product to specifications rather than deal with the 
constant tweaking that occurs when soliciting customer 
feedback. In the future, Yoskovitz is committed to build-
ing a minimum viable product (MvP) and getting it into 
the hands of customers as early as possible. He’s also 
committed to soliciting real, hard feedback from them.
Fourth, Yoskovitz learned that you can’t shove a so-
lution down your customers’ throats. In the blog post, 
Yoskovitz said then when Standout Jobs did get its prod-
uct into the hands of customers, the customers weren’t 
using it as actively as the Standout Jobs team had ex-
pected. It boils down to changing behavior. The Standout 
Jobs team underestimated just how hard it is to change 
people’s behavior, even if you think you’re providing them 
a much better solution to problems they face.
Finally, Yoskovitz feels that Standout Jobs raised too 
much money, too early. Looking back, he feels the com-
pany didn’t have the validation needed to justify raising 
the money they did. Raising money also comes with 
strings attached. Because Standout Jobs raised money, 
it quickly built a big product, based on assumptions that 
weren’t tested in the marketplace. Raising money also 
takes time—time that could be spent building and validat-
ing a product. Yoskovitz found that raising money isn’t a 
validation that something works and has a market. It’s a 
validation that someone will write a check.
Questions for Critical Thinking
 1. of the five reasons that Standout Jobs didn’t reach its full 
potential, which reason do you think damaged the compa-
ny’s chances of success the most? Explain your answer.
 2. Describe the difference between Standout Jobs as an 
idea and an actual business. Is it possible for some-
thing to be an exciting idea but a poor business?
 3. Make a list of the categories of people that the found-
ers of Standout Jobs should have talked to prior to 
launching the firm. Based on the experience that the 
company had, what do you think some of the feedback 
would have been? Do you think the founders would 
have received any feedback that might have caused 
them to dramatically change their business idea or 
consider shelving the idea all together?
 4. What can a start-up learn from Standout Jobs’ experi-
ence about the importance of feasibility analysis?

resources. The objective is to identify the most important nonfinancial re-
sources and assess their availability. An example is a start-up that will require 
employees with specialized skills. If a firm launches in a community that does 
not have a labor pool that includes people with the skill sets the firm needs, a 
serious resources sufficiency problem exists.
Another key resource sufficiency issue is the ability to obtain intellectual 
property protection on key aspects of the business. This issue doesn’t apply to 
all start-ups; but, it is critical for companies that have invented a new product 
or are introducing a new business process that adds value to the way a product 
is manufactured or a service is delivered. One quick test a start-up can adminis-
ter is to see if a patent has already been filed for its product or business process 
for a potential partner. generic networking events, like 
Chamber of Commerce mixers, are usually ineffective 
for finding a business partner. Instead, if you’re looking 
for an engineer, contact engineering trade associations 
for leads or attend engineering trade fairs. Social net-
working sites for professionals, such as LinkedIn, can 
be an effective way to make contacts. Most cities have 
startup networking events. There are also websites 
and events specifically designed to help bring people 
together to start companies. Examples include Startup 
Weekend (http://startupweekend.org), Founder2Be 
(www.founder2be.com), and CofoundersLab (www.
cofounderslab.com).
 5. hire a lawyer. When you have identified a potential part-
ner and you’re confident that the first four criteria we’ve 
discussed have been satisfied, you should hire a lawyer 
to sit down with the two (or more) of you to help hammer 
out the details. You should decide what each partner will 
contribute to the business, how the equity in the busi-
ness will be split, what form of business ownership to 
select, what each partner’s role in the company will be, 
and so forth. It’s important to hire someone who’s not 
loyal to any specific partner (even if it’s you). Hire some-
one who is impartial and everyone feels good about.
Questions for Critical Thinking
 1. Think about your personality and work habits. What 
type of person (in terms of personality and work habits) 
do you think you’d work well with and what type of 
person do you think you’d be in constant conflict with?
 2. Do you think it’s a good idea or a bad idea to form a 
business partnership with a close friend? How could 
you go about discerning if a good friend would make a 
good business partner?
 3. Provide some suggestions, other than those men-
tioned in the feature, for places (online or offline) for 
finding a business partner.
 4. Spend some time looking at LinkedIn. How could you 
use LinkedIn to help find a business partner?
O
ne thing that becomes clear to many potential 
business founders while conducting organizational 
feasibility analysis is that they need one or more 
partners to help launch their business. You might be a 
computer programmer who has a great idea for a cook-
ing website, for example, but have no experience in mar-
keting or sales. In this instance, you may need to find a 
partner with marketing and sales experience to success-
fully launch and run the firm. There are five key criteria to 
look for in a business partner. You want to get this right 
because picking the wrong partner or partners can lead 
to a lot of heartaches and business challenges.
 1. know the skills and experiences you need. Make an 
honest assessment of the skills and experience you bring 
to the business and the gaps that remain. Pick someone 
who fills the gaps. For example, if you’re an experienced 
computer programmer you probably don’t want to part-
ner with another experienced computer programmer. 
Pick someone who brings other competencies that you 
need to the venture, such as marketing or finance.
 2. Make sure your personalities and work habits are 
compatible. While you don’t need someone who is just 
like yourself, you do need to be comfortable with the 
person you’ll be in business with. For example, if you’d 
rather work 16 hours a day if that is what it takes to finish 
a project on time, and your partner would rather quit af-
ter 8 hours a day and try to renegotiate the due date for 
the project, that difference in work styles will invariably 
cause conflict. Similarly, if you like to wear a coat and tie 
when meeting with clients and your partner thinks wear-
ing blue jeans is fine, obvious disagreements could arise.
 3. Make sure you and your partner have common 
goals and aspirations. Be sure that you and your 
partner are shooting for the same target. For example, 
if your goal is to build a billion-dollar company but your 
partner would be perfectly satisfied growing the com-
pany to $10 million in sales and then selling out, obvi-
ous problems could ensue.
 4. look in the right places. If you don’t have someone 
already in mind, it’s important to know where to look

idea. Google Patents (www.google.com/patents) is a user-friendly way to search 
for patents. Although it isn’t a substitute for utilizing a patent attorney, this ap-
proach can give a start-up a quick assessment of whether someone has beaten 
them to the punch regarding a particular product or business process idea.
To test resource sufficiency, a firm should list the 6 to 12 most critical 
nonfinancial resources that it will need to move its business idea forward and 
determine if those resources are available. Table 3.5 provides a list of the types 
of nonfinancial resources that are critical to many start-ups’ success.
Financial Feasibility analysis
Financial feasibility analysis is the final component of a comprehensive fea-
sibility analysis. For feasibility analysis, a preliminary financial assessment is 
usually sufficient; indeed, additional rigor at this point is typically not required 
because the specifics of the business will inevitably evolve, making it impractical 
to spend a lot of time early on preparing detailed financial forecasts.
The most important issues to consider at this stage are total start-up cash 
needed, financial performance of similar businesses, and the overall financial 
attractiveness of the proposed venture.
If a proposed new venture moves beyond the feasibility analysis stage, it 
will need to complete pro forma (or projected) financial statements that demon-
strate the firm’s financial viability for the first one to three years of its existence. 
In Chapter 8, we’ll provide you with specific instructions for preparing these 
statements.
total Start-up cash needed
This first issue refers to the total cash needed to prepare the business to make 
its first sale. An actual budget should be prepared that lists all the anticipated 
capital purchases and operating expenses needed to get the business up and 
running. After determining a total figure, an explanation of where the money 
will come from should be provided. Avoid cursory explanations such as “I plan 
to bring investors on board” or “I’ll borrow the money.” Although you may ulti-
mately involve investors or lenders in your business, a more thoughtful account 
is required of how you’ll provide for your initial cash needs. We’ll cover funding 
and financing in Chapter 10.
If the money will come from friends and family or is raised through other 
means, such as credit cards or a home equity line of credit, a reasonable 
plan should be stipulated to repay the money. Showing how a new venture’s

start-up costs will be covered and repaid is an important issue. Many new 
ventures look promising as ongoing concerns but have no way of raising the 
money to get started or are never able to recover from the initial costs involved. 
When projecting start-up expenses, it is better to overestimate rather than 
underestimate the costs involved. Murphy’s Law is prevalent in the start-up 
world—things will go wrong. It is a rare start-up that doesn’t experience some 
unexpected expenses during the start-up phase.
There are worksheets posted online that help entrepreneurs determine 
the start-up costs to launch their respective businesses. Start-up cost work-
sheets are available via SCORE (www.score.org) and the Small Business 
Administration (www.sba.gov).
Financial performance of Similar businesses
The second component of financial feasibility analysis is estimating a proposed 
start-up’s potential financial performance by comparing it to similar, already 
established businesses. Obviously, this effort will result in approximate rather 
than exact numbers. There are several ways of doing this, all of which involve 
a little gumshoe labor.
First, substantial archival data, which offers detailed financial reports on 
thousands of individual firms, is available online. The easiest data to obtain is 
on publicly traded firms through Hoovers or a similar source. These firms are 
typically too large, however, for meaningful comparisons to proposed new ven-
tures. The challenge is to find the financial performance of small, more compa-
rable firms. Samples of websites that are helpful in this regard are provided in 
the Internet Resource table in Appendix 3.2. IBISWorld, BizMiner, and Mintel 
provide data on the average sales and profitability for the firms in the industries 
they track. Reference USA provides revenue estimates for many private firms, 
but fewer libraries subscribe to its service. (This resource is more commonly 
available at large city libraries.) On the expense side, a very useful website is 
BizStats.com, where an entrepreneur can type in the projected revenue of his or 
her firm, by industry classification (not all industries are covered), and receive 
a mock income statement in return that shows the average profitability and 
expense percentages of U.S. businesses in the same category. IBISWorld also 
normally provides a chart of the average expenses (as a percentage of sales) for 
major items such as wages, rent, office and administrative expenses, and utili-
ties for firms in the industries they follow. Another source to help estimate a 
firm’s sales and net profit is BizMiner (www.bizminer.com). BizMiner provides 
a printout of the average sales and profitability for firms in the industries it fol-
lows and provides more detail than similar reports. It is a fee-based site but is 
free if accessed through a university library that subscribes to the service.11
There are additional ways to obtain financial data on smaller firms. If a 
start-up entrepreneur identifies a business that is similar to the one he or she 
wants to start, and the business isn’t likely to be a direct competitor, it’s per-
fectly acceptable to ask the owner or manager of the business to share sales 
and income data. Even if the owner or manager is only willing to talk in general 
terms (e.g., our annual sales are in the $3 million range, and we’re netting 
around 9 percent of sales), that information is certainly better than nothing. 
Simple Internet, ProQuest, and LexisNexis Academic searches are also help-
ful. If you’re interested in the sports apparel industry, simply typing “sports 
apparel industry sales” and “sports apparel industry profitability” will invari-
ably result in links to stories about sports apparel companies that will mention 
their sales and profitability.
Simple observation and legwork is a final way to obtain sales data for similar 
businesses. This approach is suitable in some cases and in others it isn’t. For 
example, if you were proposing to open a new smoothie shop, you could gauge 
the type of sales to expect by estimating the number of people who patronize 

116    PART 2 | DEvELoPINg SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS IDEAS
similar smoothie shops in your area, along with the average purchase per visit. 
A very basic way to do this is to frequent these stores and count the number of 
customers who come in and out of the stores during various times of the day.
overall Financial Attractiveness  
of the proposed venture
A number of other factors are associated with evaluating the financial at-
tractiveness of a proposed venture. These evaluations are based primarily on 
a new venture’s projected sales and rate of return (or profitability), as just 
discussed. At the feasibility analysis stage, the projected return is a judg-
ment call. A more precise estimation can be computed by preparing pro forma 
(or projected) financial statements, including one- to three-year pro forma 
statements of cash flow, income statements, and balance sheets (along with 
accompanying financial ratios). This work can be done if time and circum-
stances allow, but is typically done at the business plan stage rather than the 
feasibility analysis stage of a new venture’s development.
To gain perspective, a start-up’s projected rate of return should be weighed 
against the following factors to assess whether the venture is financially feasible:
■ The amount of capital invested
■ The risks assumed in launching the business
■ The existing alternatives for the money being invested
■ The existing alternatives for the entrepreneur’s time and efforts
As promising as they seem on the surface, some opportunities simply may 
not be worth it financially. For example, it makes no economic sense for a group 
of entrepreneurs to invest $10 million in a capital-intense, risky start-up that 
offers a relatively low return (say around 3 percent) on the capital the entrepre-
neurs are investing. The adequacy of returns also depends on the alternatives 
the individuals involved have. For example, an individual who is thinking about 
leaving a $150,000-per-year job to start a new firm requires a higher rate of re-
turn than the person thinking about leaving a $50,000-per-year job.12
Other factors used to weigh the overall financial attractiveness of a new 
business are listed in Table 3.6.
a Feasibility analysis template

to complete a feasibility analysis. It is called First Screen because a feasibil-
ity analysis is an entrepreneur’s (or a group of entrepreneurs’) initial pass at 
learning ObjeCtive

CHAPTER 3 | FEASIBILITY AnAlysis    117
determining the feasibility of a business idea. If a business idea cuts muster at 
this stage, the next step is to complete a business plan.
The mechanics for filling out the First Screen worksheet are straightfor-
ward. It maps the four areas of feasibility analysis described in the chapter, 
accentuating the most important points in each area. The final section of the 
worksheet, “Overall Potential,” includes a section that allows for suggested revi-
sions to a business idea to improve its potential or feasibility. For example, a 
business might start out planning to manufacture its own product, but through 
the process of completing First Screen, learn that the capital needed to set up 
a manufacturing facility is prohibitive in terms of both the money that would 
need to be raised and the extended time to break even for the business. As a re-
sult, two of five items in Part 5, “Initial Capital Investment” and “Time to Break 
Even,” might be rated “low potential.” This doesn’t need to be the end of the 
story, however. In the column labeled “Suggestions for Improving the Potential,” 
the founders of the business might write, “Consider contract manufacturing 
or outsourcing as an alternative to manufacturing the product ourselves.” The 
value of the First Screen worksheet is that it draws attention to issues such as 
this one and forces the founders to think about alternatives. If this particular 
suggestion is realistic and is determined to be a better way to proceed, a revised 
version of First Screen might rate the two factors referred to previously, “Initial 
Capital Requirements” and “Time to Break Even,” as “high potential” rather 
than “low potential” because of the change in the business concept that was 
made. Business ideas at the feasibility analysis stage should always be seen as 
fluid and subject to change. Little is lost if several versions of First Screen are 
completed for the same business idea; however, there is much more to be lost if 
a start-up gets halfway through writing a business plan and concludes that the 
business isn’t feasible, or actually launches a business without having at least 
most of the kinks worked out.
Although completing First Screen does take some research and analysis, 
it is not meant to be a lengthy process. It is also not meant to be a shot in the 
dark. The best ideas are ones that emerge from analysis that is based on facts 
and good information, rather than speculation and guesses, as emphasized 
throughout the chapter. Appendix 3.2 contains the Internet Resource Table 
that may be particularly helpful in completing a First Screen analysis. It is well 
worth your time to learn how to use these resources—they are rich in terms of 
their content and analysis.
It’s important to be completely candid when completing First Screen for 
your business idea. No business scores “high potential” on every item. There is 
also no definitive way of discerning, after the worksheet is completed, if an idea 
is feasible. First Screen, like the feasibility analysis itself, is meant to convey 
an overall impression or sense of the feasibility of a business idea. Copies of 
the First Screen worksheet, in both MS Word and PDF format, are available at

 lO4. An organizational feasibility analysis is 
conducted to determine whether a pro-
posed business has sufficient management 
expertise, organizational competence, and 
resources to successfully launch its busi-
ness. There are two primary issues to con-
sider in this area: management prowess 
and resource sufficiency. With respect to 
management prowess, the intention is to 
determine the ability of the proposed ven-
ture’s initial management team. In terms 
of analysis, resource sufficiency is con-
cerned with determining if the proposed 
venture would have the resources required 
to compete successfully.
 lO5. A financial feasibility analysis is a pre-
liminary financial analysis of whether a 
business idea is worth pursuing. The most 
important areas to consider are the to-
tal start-up cash needed, financial per-
formance of similar businesses, and the 
overall financial attractiveness of the pro-
posed business.

analysis are product desirability and prod-
uct demand. A concept statement, which 
is a preliminary description of a product 
idea, is developed during this particular 
aspect of the feasibility analysis process 
to see if the proposed product or service 
makes sense to potential customers and if 
it has any fatal flaws that require immedi-
ate attention. Using online tools such as 
Google AdWords and Landing Pages and 
conducing library, Internet, and gumshoe 
research are techniques entrepreneurs 
use to assess the likely demand for a prod-
uct or service.
 lO3. An industry/market feasibility analysis is 
an assessment of the overall appeal of the 
market for the product or service being 
proposed. For feasibility analysis, there 
are two primary issues that a business 
should consider in this area: industry at-
tractiveness and target market attractive-
ness. A target market is a place within a 
larger market segment that represents a 
narrower group of customers with simi-
lar needs. Most start-ups simply don’t 
have the resources needed to partici-
pate in a broad market, at least initially. 
Instead, by focusing on a smaller target

Review Questions
 3-20. Jackson Reed, a friend of yours, just told 
you an interesting story. He was at his 
parents’ house over the weekend. While 
there, his father saw your entrepreneur-
ship book laying to the side of your back-
pack. He looked through the book and 
spent a bit of time studying Chapter 3. 
After doing so, he said to Jackson, “When 
you were growing up, I launched and sold 
three successful businesses and never 
once completed a feasibility analysis. What 
do you think the authors of your text 
would say about that?” What would you 
suggest that Jackson say in response to 
his father’s question?
 3-21. In a recent entrepreneurship class, Steven 
Milton has been assigned by his profes-
sor to conduct a product/service feasibil-
ity analysis. He is to propose a product or 
service that might be useful to students 
on campus. The analysis should include 
an assessment of the overall appeal of the 
product or service being proposed. Steven 
should include the following questions in 
his analysis to determine the appeal of his 
product or service. Does the product/ser-
vice make sense? Does it solve a problem 
or fill a gap in the market? Is it suitable to 
introduce the product/ service right now? 
Are there any flaws? As a friend to Steven, 
help him to propose a suitable product/
service to the intended target market and 
conduct a product/service feasibility anal-
ysis based on his proposal.
 3-22. If you were one of the recipients of New 
Venture Fitness Drink’s concept state-
ment, as presented earlier in the chapter, 
what type of feedback would you have 
given the company about the viability of 
its product idea?

perience in the home security industry, 
is planning to launch a new line of home 
security alarms that she believes would be 
superior to other products in the market.

ness in home cleaning services. List out 
the potential methods of marketing analy-
sis that Marie should conduct for her new

 3-25. If you were interested in opening a 
 musical instruments store near the col-
lege or university you are attending in 
order to sell guitars, drums, and other 
types of musical instruments, what 
 online  resources would you draw on to 
conduct secondary research regarding 
the industry/target market feasibility of 
your business idea?
 3-26. You bumped into your ex-colleague Allen 
Smith at a nearby supermarket. He was 
so glad to meet you and the conversation 
was all about his upcoming business. 
He is in the middle of planning to start 
up a fitness center in your neighbor-
hood. Throughout your conversation with 
him, you noticed that he did not have a 
proper financial feasibility analysis. He 
was blindly pursuing his dreams with 
no proper planning, especially none on 
 financial matters. As a friend, advise him 
on the most critical issues to consider in 
the financial area when completing this 
analysis.
 3-27. In a group of three, prepare a First Screen 
analysis on a proposed business idea. 
You may refer to appendix 3.1 and 3.2 for 
 assistance. Once completed, please share 
with your class if the proposed idea can 
proceed to the next stage, i.e., preparing 
the business plan.
 3-28. What are some of the red flags that would 
suggest that the overall financial attrac-
tiveness of a proposed new venture is 
poor? Which of the red flags you identified 
would suggest that realistically, a proposed 
venture isn’t feasible?
 3-29. A friend of yours just completed a First 
Screen analysis for an e-commerce site 
that she hopes to launch to sell horse 
riding supplies such as saddles, tacks, 
lead ropes, and feed buckets. She’s dis-
appointed because she rated 10 of the 
25 items included in First Screen as hav-
ing either low or moderate potential. After 
thinking about this, your friend says to 
you, “Well that’s that. Good thing I com-
pleted a feasibility analysis. I definitely 
do not want to start the business I was 
thinking about.” Is your friend correct in 
reaching this conclusion? How would you 
advise her to interpret the results of her 
First Screen analysis?

business idea: Develop a safer, simpler, and more 
social way to lock and unlock the front door of a home or 
an apartment.
pitch: Conventional door locks have several downsides. 
First, they require a key that can be lost or misplaced. 
Second, if the owner of a house wants to provide access 
during the middle of the day to someone such as a dog 
walker or housekeeper, it creates a problem. The person 
accessing the house has to be given a key or a key has 
to be hidden somewhere, like under the flower pot near 
the door (which is the first place a burglar would look). 
Finally, if a friend stops by to drop something off and the 
house is locked, s/he may have made a wasted trip.
The August Smart Lock solves all these problems. It is 
an attractive hardware device that retrofits over an exist-
ing single-cylinder deadbolt lock, which is the type of 
lock found on the majority of front doors for homes and 
apartments. The August Smart Lock fits on the interior 
portion of the door. It does not affect the ability to use 
the same key that has always been used to lock and 
unlock the door.
once the August Smart Lock is installed, it allows the 
door to be locked and unlocked via a smartphone app. 
The app allows you to send a virtual key to anyone you 
choose to have access to your home or apartment. Your 
guest then uses their smartphone to gain access to the 
residence without the need to exchange physical keys. 
You can specify the duration that the August virtual key 
is active, and the key can be disabled at any time. For 
example, if someone walks your dog from 1:00 p.m. to 
1:30 p.m. every day, access to the home can be granted 
to that specific person for that time each day.
The August Smart Lock is easy to install. It is com-
pletely self-sufficient, meaning that it does not need 
access to electricity or Wi-Fi, like more complicated 
keyless door lock systems. It literally takes 10 minutes 
to install. The August Smart Lock app is compatible 
with the iPhone and Android-based products, and will 
soon be adding BlackBerry and Windows Phone 8. 
If you lose your phone you can log onto august.com 
and remove access authorization for that device. The 
system is completely safe and will not allow entry for 
people who do not have a virtual or physical key. The 
virtual key function uses the same secure communica-
tions technology used by financial institutions. August 
has additional safety features. For example, for guests 
who are provided a virtual key, August keeps track of 
how many times they enter your home and keeps track 
of the duration of each visit.

business idea: Produce and sell the first wireless 
patient monitoring system, enhancing patient care 
by continuously measuring vital medical data, and 
transmitting the information to health practitioners.
pitch: Monitoring a sick patient can be a delicate 
balancing act. Although they need uninterrupted sleep to 
aid their recovery, medical staff must also regularly check 
vital signs such as temperature and blood pressure. The 
two needs are not always fine bedfellows.
Four entrepreneurial scientists have come up with a solu-
tion: a wireless gadget called SmartSense, which is now 
being used in hospitals in Singapore, Bangkok, Taipei, 
and the Middle East. The 1.2-inch wide SmartSense is 
taped to a patient’s body to continuously measure vital 
signs. Radio frequency technology then transfers the 
data wirelessly via ceiling-mounted transmitters to com-
puters in the nurses’ station.
The inspiration for the idea came out of a coffee break 
conversation between CADI Scientific founder Zenton 
goh and a colleague. The colleague had a sick child and 
said he and his wife were waking the infant every two 
hours through the night to take her temperature. goh 
thought of the idea of an automated wireless sensing 
system to monitor a baby’s body temperature, so that 
both parents and children could enjoy uninterrupted 
sleep. The idea evolved into SmartSense.
Nurses can now dispense with the task of manually 
checking temperatures and blood pressure  every few 
hours, and patients get uninterrupted rest. SmartSense 
also cuts down on any possibility of human error

introduction
Modify Watches was started by Aaron Schwartz and 
gary Coover, shortly after the two received their MBAs 
from UC-Berkeley’s Hass School of Business in 2010. 
While in college, Schwartz started a sustainability busi-
ness called Refill Revolution. He also took a class from 
Steve Blank and Eric Ries—champions of the lean 
start-up movement. The class was called “Customer 
Development in High-Tech Enterprises.” The staple 
concepts underlying the class were “building a minimal 
viable product” and “get out of the building.” Building 
a minimal viable product means that a start-up’s initial 
product should include just enough core features to 
 allow early adopters to provide feedback. The start-up 
can then iterate based on the feedback. “get out of the 
building” refers to the notion that it’s impossible to know 
what customers really want without talking to them.
Blank and Ries’s class impacted Schwartz. He re-
alized that Refill Revolution, which he eventually sold, 
wasn’t built utilizing Blank and Ries’s principles. Instead, 
he and his co-founders built a service based on what 
they thought was right, rather than on what customers 
told them they wanted. Luckily, they found a buyer that 
was able to take advantage of the Refill Revolution plat-
form. The company itself wouldn’t have been successful 
as a stand-alone business.
giving Steve blank and eric ries’s  
philosophy a try
Modify Watches started from a different premise. The 
general idea was to sell affordable watches that have 
interchangeable faces and bands. That approach would 
give customers the ability to switch their watch face 
and band to match their clothing or mood. Rather than 
pushing forward, the firm chose to give Blank and Ries’s 
philosophy a try. They knew the idea rested on a core 
hypothesis: people would buy interchangeable watch 
parts. To test the hypothesis, they went to eBay and 
bought cheap interchangeable watches. They then built 
an inexpensive website, using Weebly.com, that fea-
tured jokes, images of the watch parts, nicknames for 
every single watch-color combination, and “Buy Now” 
buttons. The inexpensive watches were their minimal 
viable product. They just wanted to see how people

in the checks and reduces nurses’ workload. Doctors 
can check on the data on-the-go too via WiFi-
enabled  digital assistants, or on PCs anywhere in the 
hospital.
Another bonus to introducing this system into crowded 
wards is it is now very easy to quickly spot clusters 
of patients developing a fever at the same time. At a 
time of growing incidences of hospital-acquired in-
fections, this is an important early warning signal. 
Since then, consumer versions of SmartSense have 
been produced, such as an Infrared Ear and Forehead 
Thermometer, to allow people to monitor temperature 
and blood pressure at home.

questions would you ask the firm’s founders before 
making your funding decision? What answers would

would buy. The test validated the idea that they could 
sell interchangeable watch faces and brands.
company launch
Modify Watches launched soon afterwards. It didn’t take 
the company long to develop a certain character, which 
was customer focused. They called their customers “The 
ModiFamily.” When people complimented them on their 
products, they referred to their motto, which is “We’re not 
craftsmen, we’re just good listeners.” Not everything went 
swimmingly, though. Coover left Modify in August 2010 
to join a strategy team with Samsung in South Korea. 
Schwartz, like Coover, had planned to resume a full time 
job but decided to commit to Modify full-time. Schwartz, 
like Coover, planned to resume a full-time job but decided 
to commit to Modify on a full-time basis instead. He did 
not take a salary the first year to help the company get 
up and running, and the company was initially run out of 
his apartment. A big break occurred shortly after launch 
when Schwartz was on a cross-country flight. He met a 
business executive on the plane and ended up selling 
him 2,500 watches. That sale earned Schwartz the bless-
ing of his family and advisers to stick with the business. 
Schwartz also started surrounding himself with a talented 
team. He hired Ashil Parag, who he describes as an A+ 
designer. As his tech director he hired a UC-Berkeley stu-
dent named Sean Linehan, whom Schwartz described as 
“as talented as anyone I have ever met.”
The company’s focus on customers wasn’t forced. 
In fact, in an article Schwartz wrote for startup America 
he said that “interacting with customers gives us (the 
Modify Watch team) happiness on a daily basis.” 
Similarly, in an article Schwartz wrote for Forbes, he pro-
vided the following advice for business founders: “Think 
of your customers as family and friends. It sounds silly, 
but when you believe that folks you care about rely on 
your product or service, you will work harder to make 
sure they are treated well.” Schwartz’s actions indicated 
that his sentiments are real. From the beginning, for ex-
ample, whoever does the packing for a Modify Watches 
order includes their business card. The card includes 
the team member’s e-mail address and their cell phone 
number, just in case a customer wants to give them a 
shout. The more Modify’s team members interact with 
customers, Schwartz figures, the better the company will 
be able to design watches that their customers want.
Modify watches
From the get-go, Modify Watches tapped into the cus-
tomization movement. Its line of watches includes mul-
tiple faces and straps, all of which are interchangeable, 
so you can design any style you’d like. To fully appreci-
ate the number of watch faces and bands the company 
offers, pause for a moment and visit its website. The 
watches come in two sizes, big and bigger. They’re 
water resistant and made of stainless steel and plas-
tic. Changing straps is very simple. If you have a large 
enough collection of straps and faces, you can have a 
different daily look on your wrist for some time. The least 
expensive combination of face and strap costs $40 plus 
shipping. The company also has a license with the Major 
League Baseball Player’s Association, so you can get a 
watch face with your favorite baseball team’s logo on it.
Modify has continued to involve customers every 
step of the way, often in very substantive manners. An 
illustrative example is an initiative launched in November 
2011. Modify rolled out crowd-sourcing platform Napkin 
Labs’ (www.napkinlabs.com) brainstorming app to its 
Facebook page. The app allows companies to create vir-
tual, interactive focus groups with its customers. Modify 
ran a competition that asked customers to submit sug-
gestions for co-branding products. An idea to co-brand 
a watch with the Wounded Warrior Project won. Modify 
had to push back the deadline for the competition be-
cause of the large number of submissions it received.
kickstarter
Modify Watches’ current initiative is its Mod-to-order 
campaign. It is an initiative that will allow the company 
to produce individual customized watches for people. 
So if you’d like a watch with your best friend’s image on 
it, Modify Watch will be able to do that for you. To raise 
money for the machinery and staff needed to make in-
dividually customized watches, Modify ran a Kickstarter 
campaign in early 2014. If you’d really like to get a 
sense of what Modify Watches is all about, go to www.
kickstarter.com, type Modify in the search bar, and 
watch the videos that the company made to promote 
the campaign. They are expertly done and fully convey 
Modify Watches’ culture and values. Modify reached 
its goal and received contributions from 790 backers. 
of course, while the outward purpose of the campaign 
was to raise $50,000 to buy equipment and hire people, 
the campaign had another purpose. Harkening back to 
Blank and Ries’s philosophy of launching a minimal via-
ble product, the Kickstarter campaign and its accompa-
nying videos were the minimal viable product for Mod-
to-order. The $54,873 in pledges from 790 backers was 
the validation needed to move the idea forward.
the difference listening to customers Makes
one thing Schwartz likes to emphasize is that listening 
to customers makes a difference. Along with the prac-
tices mentioned above, Modify surveys its fans at least 
quarterly, and its entire team has calls with customers 
every week. In a guest post written on the Tech Cocktail 
blog, Schwartz noted the following substantive changes 
the company has made strictly as a result of listening to 
customers.
■ Business model change. A good share of Modify’s 
business comes from customizing watches for 
brands. The idea to do this came from a google 
employee who contacted Modify and asked if 
they could make a goole Chrome watch. Modify 
said yes, and a new product line was born. It now 
designs branded watches for google, Facebook, 
the Pac 12 conference, and a number of other 
businesses and organizations.
(continued)

124    PART 2 | DEvELoPINg SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS IDEAS
■ The right product improvements. Modify reaches 
out to customers in a variety of ways to ask what 
they want (and don’t want) in their watches. At 
one point, Modify assumed that people would 
want the watches to be water resistant, have a 
stopwatch, and have a backlight. A total of 95 
percent wanted the watches to be water resistant 
while less than 10 percent wanted a stopwatch 
and even fewer wanted a backlight.
■ Adding brand-name licensing. Modify’s fans 
asked early and often for licensed properties like 
Major League Baseball. The company took the 
feedback, and it has been rewarded with signifi-
cant product sales.
■ Design decisions. Before Modify launches a new 
limited-edition watch, it always asks its fans to 
vote on what should be made.

introduction
When Rahul Panicker, Jane Chen, and Linus Liang 
enrolled in Design for Extreme Affordability, a course 
taught in the Design School at Stanford University, little 
did they know that the class would change their lives. 
And little did they know that a short three years later, 
premature babies born in rural India, who often don’t 
survive because of hypothermia, would have a new 
chance at life because of a product they designed.
The Design for Extreme Affordability class draws 
students from across the Stanford campus. The goal 
of the class is to develop solutions for formidable, 
real-world problems. The project Panicker, Chen, and 
Liang were assigned was to develop a low-cost infant 
incubator for use in developing countries. This was a 
topic that the three knew nothing about. They were 
electrical engineering, MBA, and computer science 
students, respectively. To get started, they did some 
simple google searches. They learned that millions 
of permature babies are born annually in developing 
countries. About a million of them die, often within 
24 hours. The biggest cause of death is hypothermia. 
Premature babies don’t have enough fat to regulate 
their body temperature. As a result, they can literally 
freeze to death in a room that is at room temperature. 
Nearly half of the world’s low-birth-weight babies are 
born in India. Hospitals have incubators that provide 
consistent, life-saving heat to premature babies. But 
incubators cost up to $20,000 a piece.
The obvious solution was to drive down the cost of 
incubators. The team could systematically reduce the 
cost of traditional incubators by eliminating nonessential 
parts and using cheaper materials. Rather than moving 
forward, Liang got funding for a trip to Nepal to study 
incubators in developing countries. While visiting a hos-
pital he noticed something that was odd. Many of the 
incubators were empty. He then learned the sad truth. 
About 80 percent of the premature babies born in the 
 developing world are born in rural villages. They never are 
brought to a hospital and placed in an incubator. Even 
when they are, they’re often taken home before the baby 
is ready to leave due to family needs back at the village.
Back at Stanford, the team grappled with what to 
do with the insight. The easier road ahead would be to 
redesign the traditional incubator, to make them more 
affordable. But that wasn’t the answer. The harder chal-
lenge was to find a solution for saving premature babies 
where they were born—in rural villages.

is a Matter of life and Death

CHAPTER 3 | FEASIBILITY AnAlysis    125
Early Prototypes
The team tackled the harder challenge: How to create a 
baby-warming device that doctors and parents in rural 
villages could use to save premature babies? The team 
set to work and started creating rough prototypes of an 
original design. The earliest prototypes were made using 
old sleeping bags, baby dolls, and blankets. The design 
was a portable infant warmer that looks like a tiny sleep-
ing bag. The warmer opens in the front, allowing moth-
ers to nurse their babies and maintain intimate contact. 
The bag contained a pouch of wax-like phase-change 
material that keeps the baby warm for up to six hours at 
regular body temperatures. It required just 30 minutes 
of electricity to heat the pouch, an ideal situation for 
areas where the availability of electricity is spotty. To 
provide additional warmth, mothers would be instructed 
to hold their babies as much as possible against their 
skin. This activity prompted the team to call the product 
“Embrace.”
The class ended and the team had a decision to 
make. All had promising prospects. In the end, the team 
members couldn’t walk away. The lives of premature ba-
bies were at stake. They would move forward and con-
tinue to work on what was now known as the Embrace 
Infant Warmer.
embrace infant warmer
The team, now joined by a fourth Stanford student, 
Naganand Murty, took the prototye to India to solicit 
customer feedback. They used rapid prototyping tech-
niques to iterate on feedback and zero in on the attri-
butes that are of highest relevance and value in a rural 
setting. Some of what they found out was suprising, 
and would have never been learned had they remained 
in California. For example, they found that women in 
India believe that Western medicine is very power-
ful, so they routinely cut back on the recommended 
dosages of Western medicines, just to be safe. That 
knowledge impacted early prototypes of the Embrace 
Infant Warmer. The early prototypes instructed moth-
ers to set the temperature at 37 degrees Celsius. What 
they found was that the devices were being set at 
about 30 degrees. To solve the problem, they prepro-
grammed the ideal temperature into the device and 
just put an oK and Not oK switch on it. Commenting 
on the decision to go to India rather than remain at 
Stanford to build out the Embrace Infant Warmer, Chen 
told Helen Walters, who wrote an article on Embrace, 
“There are so many nuances that are critical to design 
and effective implementation, so many nuances that 
you don’t understand unless you’re there and living 
and breathing the culture every day.”
Talking to potential customers raised other issues. 
For example, they learned that villagers wanted differ-
ent pricing options—like an option to rent the device. 
Commenting on changes that were made as a result 
of feedback from rural villagers, Chen said in an HBR 
blog post, “Entrepreneurs often fall in love with their 
original product idea or business model and fail to listen 
to customers. We (meaning the Embrace team), on the 
other hand, have no qualms about modifying our prod-
uct features and pricing again and again until we find a 
solution that delivers the highest value to our customers 
at the lowest cost for them.”
gaining Momentum
The initial prototypes of the Embrace Infant Warmer 
were a success, which emboldened the team to keep 
working. Additional field resarch took place, involv-
ing village mothers in every aspect of design, from the 
straps on the warmer to the instructions printed on its 
front. Spending time in homes in rural India produced 
additional insights. “oftentimes the mother-in-law is the 
decision maker,” Chen said in the same interview as 
the one cited above. As a result, they determined a way 
to involve mother-in-laws in the process of using the 
Embrace Infant Warmer. In December of 2010, Embrace 
was featured in a segment of the ABC News show 
20/20. The show contained images of a five-pound 
baby girl in India named Nisha, the first child to use the 
Embrce Infant Warmer in a clinical trial—and maybe the 
first life saved by the device.
The Embrace Infant Warmer was formally 
launched in April 2011, after completing clinical trials.

design was settled on. All manufacturing is done in 
Bangalore, India. Some of the parts are outsourced, 
but the final assembly and quality testing is done by 
the company. To ensure distribution, Embrace is part-
nering with multinational medical devices companies 
like gE Healthcare and with local Ngos. An organiza-
tional structure has also emerged. Embrace has both 
a nonprofit arm, which donates its baby warmer to 
those in need and runs educational programs, and a 
for-profit side, which sells the baby warmers to gov-
ernment entities and private clinics. It’s a two-pronged 
approach that the founders hope will allow the com-
pany to prosper, grow, and save an increasing number 
of premature babies.
embrace today
As of the end of 2013, roughly two and a half years 
after launch, the Embrace Infant Warmer had been 
used on about 10,000 babies. Panicker and Chen 
lead Embrace, while their Stanford classmates and 
co-founders have moved on. The company is private 
and doesn’t disclose financial information, other than 
to say that its margins are sufficient to keep grow-
ing and try additional products. The Embrace Infant 
Warmer is not only used in rural villages. Its also used 
in hospitals and clinics, to move premature babies 
from location to location and to use when a premature 
baby is born and all of the traditional incubators are 
already in use.
In addition to continuing to improve the Embrace 
Infant Warmer, the company has aspriations to tackle 
some of the other factors that cause infant mortality. 
other potentially fatal conditions include meningitis, 
pneumonia, infections such as sepsis, and diarrhea.
To fully appreciate the heart of Embrace and 
the company’s goals, visit its website at http:// 
embraceglobal.org or Facebook page at Embrace. 
A particuarly heart-warming portion of its web-
site is titled “Spread the Warmth with Embrace.” 
A $25  donation provides the  life-saving warmth 
of an Embrace warmer to one  low-birth-weight or 
premature baby.
discussion Questions

Getting  
Personal with her campus media

133
I
f you’re a female college student and are looking for an enriching experience, you 
might consider plugging into your college campus’s Her Campus chapter. Her 
Campus is the number-one online community for college women. Written entirely 
by 4,000-plus college journalists and supported by a dedicated staff 
at its Boston headquarters, Her Campus features national content 
on style, beauty, health, love, life, and career, supplemented by local 
content from 250-plus campus chapters across the world. In addi-
tion, Her Campus offers slideshows, videos, memes, gifts, quizzes, 
giveaways, e-commerce, a daily e-mail newsletter, and social media 
communities. It’s like nothing else available for college-aged women.
Her Campus was started in 2009 by three Harvard University un-
dergraduates: Stephanie Kaplan, Annie Wang, and Windsor Hanger. 
The women met in 2007 while working on a separate Harvard pub-
lication. In the nearby photo, Stephanie Kaplan is on the left, Annie 
Wang is in the middle, and Windsor Hanger is on the right. In January 
2009, Kaplan, Wang, and Hanger entered the i3 Innovation Challenge, 
a business plan competition held on the Harvard campus, propos-
ing a national online magazine for college women, with student chapters at colleges 
and universities across the United States. After the business plan received the Harvard 
Student Agencies Investment Award, Her Campus was born. The award secured na-
tional attention, along with free office space for a period of time.
Her Campus, the flagship site of the company, which is formally named Her 
Campus Media, features a vibrant online magazine, with feature articles targeted 
toward all aspects of college life and survival. The website is divided into six cat-
egories: style, beauty, health, love, life, and career. The content is wholesome and 
upbeat, and speaks to the daily challenges, concerns, dilemmas, and triumphs that 
college-aged women experience. In addition to a staff of full-time editors, design-
ers, and managers working at the company’s Boston headquarters, Her Campus is 
represented by students at 250-plus college campuses. These campuses are known 
as My Campus chapters. Each chapter has a president/editor-in-chief, and a staff of 
volunteer correspondents who develop feature articles, photos, and other content 
specific to their particular university. Her Campus also has a team of national con-
tributing writers who “pitch” articles to run on the Her Campus national website. The

local chapters compete to reach certain levels of distinction within the Her Campus 
community. The highest level is the Pink level. To reach the Pink level a local chap-
ter has to demonstrate flawless writing and formatting, update their site every day, 
post several times a day on social media sites, host events, and reach 40 percent of 
the undergraduate female population on their campus. An example of a local chap-
ter, the My Campus chapter at the University of Central florida, is available at www.
hercampus.com/ucf. Toward the end of 2014, Her Campus was receiving approxi-
mately 3.5 million monthly unique visitors, 15 million monthly page views, and was 
operating with 20 full-time employees.
of paramount importance to Kaplan, Wang, and Hanger from the outset was 
 developing an effective business model for their company. The company’s core com-
petency is developing compelling content at a low cost and displaying the content in an 
attractive and accessible manner. The 4,000-plus local chapter correspondents are all 
volunteers, who write for Her Campus to obtain experience and hone their journalistic 
skills rather than make money. The same applies to interns in the company’s Boston 
headquarters. The company’s mission is crystal clear: to produce, on a daily basis, the 
“Collegiette’s guide to life.” The word “collegiette” can’t be found in the dictionary, 
at least not yet. It’s a word made up by the founders of Her Campus to describe the 
women in their target audience. According to Stephanie Kaplan, a collegiette is “a col-
lege girl who is on top of her game—strategically career-minded, distinctly fashionable, 
socially connected, academically driven, and smartly health-conscious, who endeavors 
to get the most out of her college experience on every level.” In early 2012, Her Campus 
received a trademark on the word “collegiette” from the U.S. Patent and Trademark of-
fice. Her Campus is now the only company that can use that word in a business context.
on the revenue side, Her Campus’s business model focuses on connecting com-
panies with college females. The key to making this work is Her Campus’s unparalleled 
 access to college-aged women. Part of their business model is native advertising, or 
sponsored content. The way sponsored content works is that Her Campus will run an 
article that is sponsored by a brand and that promotes that brand to its audience. This 
arrangement allows brands to connect with Her Campus’s audience. Her Campus’s 
client list includes victoria’s Secret PInK, new Balance, Pinkberry, and many other 
national brands. Her Campus also generates revenue from other types of advertising 
and sponsorships, which is often visible on its website and additional platforms. other 
revenue generators include product sampling and on-campus and event-based mar-
keting programs.
In regard to expansion, Her Campus is steadily increasing its number of My 
Campus local chapters. It is also interested in overseas markets. In late 2013, Her 
Campus acquired HerUni.com, a similar online magazine for college-aged women 
in England. The acquisition of HerUni.com will strengthen Her Campus’s presence 
throughout the United Kingdom. The company is also thinking about broadening its 
audience to include men, including the possibility of a His Campus site. The founders 
would have to think carefully about how that possibility would affect their current busi-
ness model and future prospects.
In this chapter, we introduce you to the concept of the business model. A business 
model is a firm’s plan or recipe for how it creates, delivers, and captures value for its 
stakeholders.1 Business models are foundational to a firm’s ability to succeed both in 
the short and long term, especially when it is the first one to introduce a new product 
or service to customers.2 Dropbox, for example, has what’s referred to as a freemium 
business model. It offers its customers a free account with a set amount of storage

space, and makes money by selling premium accounts with more capacity. Dropbox 
could charge all of its users a monthly fee based on the amount of storage that they 
use, but that’s not its business model. Its business model is based on the belief that by 
introducing users to its service through a free account, it will ultimately sign up more 
paid users. To further illustrate what a business model is, the Savvy Entrepreneurial 
firm feature focuses on Quirky, an interesting company that helps bring peoples’ inven-
tions to life. The feature illustrates how Quirky creates, delivers, and captures value for 
its stakeholder.
t
he proper time to determine a company’s business model is following the 
initial validation of the business idea and prior to fleshing out the opera-
tional details of the firm.3 This sequence, which is depicted in Figure 4.1, 
nicely parallels the chapters in the book. Chapter 1 dealt with the decision to 
become an entrepreneur. Chapters 2–3 considered the initial validation of the 
business idea. This chapter deals with determining a business model, while 
Chapters 5–15 deal with the topics needed to implement a firm’s business 
model and grow the firm.
In this chapter we’ll first discuss business models and their importance. 
We then introduce and discuss a template for developing a business model. 
The template, called the Barringer/Ireland Business Model Template, consists 
of 4 categories and 12 items that make up a firm’s business model. The tem-
plate, which can be completed on an 8 ½ by 11 sheet of paper or blown up and 
placed on the wall, provides a nice visual mechanism to think through and 
display the elements of a firm’s business model.
A critical factor is that similar to feasibility analysis, a firm’s business 
model should not be completed in isolation. The founders of a firm should “get 
out of the building” and talk to potential customers as a firm’s business model 
takes shape.4 This is a facet of developing an effective business model that we 
stress throughout the chapter.
business Models and their importance
As stated above, a firm’s business model is its plan or recipe for how it creates, 
delivers, and captures value for its stakeholders. Glance ahead to Figure 4.2, 
the Barringer/Ireland Business Model Template. As you can see by looking at 
the template, a firm’s business model represents the core aspects of its busi-
ness. It also describes how the core aspects fit together and support one an-
other. For example, three important elements of a firm’s business model are its 
target market, its basis for differentiation, and its key assets. In Her Campus’s 
case, its target market is college-aged females, it differentiates itself by focus-
ing on six topics that college-aged females care about (style, beauty, health, 
love, life, and career), and its key assets include 4,000-plus college females 
volunteering in Her Campus chapters across the country writing articles that 
they believe other college females will be interested in. This example illustrates 
a nicely designed business model, at least as it pertains to the three elements 
mentioned above. Each element supports the others. It’s also a business model 
that would be difficult to copy. It would take a tremendous effort on the part of 
a competitor to match Her Campus’s network of 4,000-plus volunteers on col-
lege campuses.

Q
uirky is an interesting company. It was conceived by 
Ben Kauffman, a young entrepreneur who launched 
his first company when he was 18. Kauffman’s first 
company, Mophie, designed accessories for Apple prod-
ucts. In 2006, Mophie won Best in Show at Macworld 
for a modular case accessory system for the iPod nano. 
The next year at the same conference, Kaufman and his 
company did an unusual thing. Instead of bringing their 
hottest new products to showcase, they brought next 
to nothing. Instead, they set up a booth made out of 
two-by-fours, and handed out scratch pads to 30,000 
people, asking the Macworld community for new product 
suggestions. The sketch that got the most attention, and 
was repeatedly exposed to the community for improve-
ments, was a case/bottle opener for the iPod Shuffle. The 
product was built, and with this amazing story behind it, 
became a hit, selling in 28 countries worldwide.
This and similar experiences became the inspiration 
for Quirky, which was launched in 2009. In a nutshell, 
Quirky is an invention company that allows people to sub-
mit product ideas (mostly household items and kitchen 
gadgets) that are then vetted by the Quirky community. 
The best ideas are selected for prototype development 
and possible sale. It’s become quite a success. over 
550,000 people are now part of the Quirky “community,” 
and participate in pitching, refining, or voting on product 
ideas. The process has created several hit products, 
including Pivot Power (a flexible power strip that bends 
to fit large three-prong plugs in each outlet) and Crates 
(modular plastic milk crates used as shelving). Quirky’s 
products are sold via its website and in big-box stores 
such as Target and Home Depot. The system is a win-
win for everyone involved. The inventors and community 
members who help with the product get a cut of the profit. 
In 2012, Quirky launched 121 new products—all invented 
by ordinary people.
Quirky accomplishes what it does via its business 
model. As we noted above, a business model is a firm’s 
plan or recipe for how it creates, delivers, and captures 
value for its stakeholders. Here is how Quirky accom-
plishes each of these key elements:
■ Quirky creates value by allowing ordinary people 
to submit product ideas. ordinary people often 
have good product ideas, but don’t have the 
wherewithal to start a company. As a result, the 
ideas generally never come to fruition. now, 
 because of Quirky, anyone with an idea for a 
household product or a kitchen gadget has a 
shot at seeing the idea become a reality.
■ Quirky delivers value by providing an easy-to-
navigate process for ideas to be submitted and 
vetted by the Quirky community. The most prom-
ising ideas are fashioned into products that are 
sold. By creating this process, Quirky has brought 
down the barriers that prevent most people from 
seeing their ideas realized. Quirky has just what a 
good idea needs—product designers, prototype 
specialists, manufacturing capabilities, and rela-
tionships with retailers to get products on store 
shelves.
■ Quirky captures value for its stakeholders via the 
profits that it realizes on the products that are 
sold. for every product that is sold, Quirky takes 
60 percent of the revenue and returns 40 per-
cent to the original inventor and the community 
members (called Influencers) that help shape the 
idea. To minimize risk, Quirky only fully develops 
products that have a certain level of pre-sales. 
Quirky has relationships with a growing number 
of retailers to maximize revenue from the best-
selling items.
The attractiveness of Quirky’s business model is that 
as the company grows, it can expand into new product 
categories. Quirky is also a business that would be difficult 
to copy. It has raised over $91 million in venture capital and 
as noted above, has over 550,000 people in its network. It 
has also built relationships with organizations up and down 
the manufacturing and retail supply chains.
Questions for Critical Thinking
 1. Do you think Quirky’s basic business model is sound 
and fair? If you could suggest any changes, what 
would they be?
 2. To what degree does Quirky’s business reflect the 
attributes of a sound business idea as described in 
Chapter 2?
 3. In what other product areas would Quirky’s business 
model work the best?
 4. Think of the challenges in your own life that might 
represent a product idea for Quirky. If you don’t think 
of something right away, don’t give up. All of us 
 encounter problems and challenges in our everyday 
lives that might represent the basis of a promising 
idea. Be prepared to describe to others one of the 
challenges or problems you encounter and how a 
 solution to the problem could be fashioned into a 
product idea to submit to Quirky.

general Categories of business Models
There are two general categories of business models: standard business models 
and disruptive business models.5 Next, we provide details about each model.
Standard business models
The first category is standard business models. This type of model is used com-
monly by existing firms as well as by those launching an entrepreneurial ven-
ture. Standard business models depict existing plans or recipes firms can use 
to determine how they will create, deliver, and capture value for their stakehold-
ers. There are a number of standard or common business models. An abbrevi-
ated list is shown in Table 4.1. Most of the standard business models, with the 
exception of the freemium model, have been in place for some time. In fact, many 
of the business models utilized by online firms were originally developed by of-
fline firms, and simply transferred to the Internet. For example, Amazon did not 
invent a new business model. It took the mail order business model, pioneered 
years ago by Sears Roebuck and Company, and moved it online. Similarly, eBay 
did not invent the auction business model—that has been in existence for cen-
turies. It moved the auction format online. What Amazon.com and eBay did do, 
however, which is common among successful start-ups, is adopt a standard 
business model and build upon it in one or more meaningful ways to produce a 
new way of creating value. Birchbox, for example, adopted the subscription busi-
ness model and then built upon it in novel ways. This firm provides its subscrib-
ers a monthly assortment of cosmetic and skin care samples in hopes of enticing 
them to buy full-sized versions of the same products. Its cost structure is low 
because it operates via the Internet and many of the samples that it distributes 
are provided for free by companies that want to get their products in front of 
Birchbox’s unique clientele. The other elements of Birchbox’s business model are 
supportive of its basic premise. The multifaceted “value” that Birchbox’s business 
model creates is that it presents products to women that they wouldn’t have oth-
erwise tried. Through this model, Birchbox creates two revenue streams for itself 
(i.e., the subscription service and online sales), and it creates additional sales for 
the companies that provide the samples that Birchbox disseminates to its sub-
scribers. You can read more about Birchbox in Case 6.1.
It is important to understand that there is no perfect business model.6 Each 
of the standard models has inherent strengths and weaknesses. For example, 
the strength of the subscription business model is recurring revenue. Birchbox 
has approximately 400,000 subscribers who pay $10 per month. As a result, if 
Birchbox maintains its subscriber base, it would know that it had a minimum 
of $4 million in revenue each month. The disadvantage of the subscription 
business model is “churn.” Churn refers to the number of subscribers that a 
subscription-based business loses each month. If Birchbox losses 10 percent of 
its subscribers each month, it will need to recruit 40,000 new subscribers each 
month just to stay even. This is why companies that feature a subscription-
based business model normally offer a high level of customer service. They 
want to retain as high a percentage of their subscribers as they can to lower 
churn and avoid the expenses involved with replacing existing customers.
It’s important to note that a firm’s business model takes it beyond its own 
boundaries. Her Campus’s business model, for example, is based on the idea 
that female college students will form My Campus chapters and voluntarily 
contribute content to their chapter’s website and the main Her Campus portal. 
The trick to getting something like this to work is to provide sufficient incentive 
for partners to participate. In Her Campus’s case, the local My Campus mem-
bers contribute because they want to obtain experience, hone their journalistic 
skills, and build their résumés. Apparently, Her Campus is providing these indi-
viduals a rich enough experience that it’s worth their time to participate. Many

companies feature the participation of others as an integral part of their busi-
ness models. An example is Apple, and in particular the Apple App Store. As of 
December 2013, more than 1 million apps were available through the Apple App 
Store, created by over 262,000 publishers. About 140 new apps are added each 
day. It’s a win-win situation for both Apple and the developers. The developers 
get access to a platform to sell their apps, while Apple shares in the revenue 
that’s generated. Positive scenarios like this often allow businesses to not only 
strengthen but to expand their business models. As a result of the success of its 
app store, Apple launched iAd, a platform that allows app developers to sell ad-
vertising on the apps they make available via the Apple App Store. Apple shares 
in the revenue generated by the advertising.
Regardless of the business model a start-up is rolling out, one thing that 
new companies should guard themselves against is thinking that one particu-
lar business model is a “homerun” regardless of circumstances.7 In this sense, 
the issues discussed in Chapters 1–3 still apply, meaning, for example, that 
the strength of the opportunity must be assessed and the feasibility of the idea 
must be validated. The What Went Wrong feature nearby draws attention to

eer-to-Peer business models are hot. Airbnb, Uber, 
and lyft, three of the most successful firms in the 
peer-to-peer business model space, are growing 
and are worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Peer-to-
peer businesses act as matchmaker between individuals 
with a service to offer and others who want the service. 
Airbnb, for example, matches people who are look-
ing for a place to stay (for a day or two or longer) with 
people who have an extra room that they’re willing to 
rent. Relying to some degree on smartphone technol-
ogy’s capabilities, lyft and Uber match people who need 
a ride with people who are willing to provide rides. The 
success of Airbnb, Uber, lyft, and others has captured 
the attention of investors, who are generally bullish on 
the peer-to-peer concept. Sam Altman, president of Y 
Combinator, a start-up accelerator, was quoted in a Wall 
Street Journal article saying “We’re bullish on the sharing 
economy (a catchall term for peer-to-peer businesses), 
and we’ll definitely make more investment in it.”
Despite the promise of the peer-to-peer business 
model, several high-profile peer-to-peer business have 
failed. The failures include BlackJet, a service that 
matched the owners of private jets with people who 
wanted a seat on a private jet for a trip, Ridejoy, a car-
pooling service, and neighborrow.com, a service that 
allowed people to list household items for rent, such 
as vacuum cleaners, tools, and food mixers. So, what 
went wrong? on the surface, BlackJet, Ridejoy, and 
neighborrow.com seem very similar to Airbnb, Uber, and 
lyft in that they matched people wanting a particular 
service with someone willing to offer it.
BlackJet’s basic premise was that once a person 
joined the service, s/he could book a seat on a private 
jet within minutes for a ride to a desired location. The 
idea was that BlackJet would sign up a large number 
of owners of private jets, who would let BlackJet know 
when they were making a trip. If a seat was open on the 
jet, it would be made available to a BlackJet member 
who was looking for a ride to the same destination. for 
those seeking rides, BlackJet charged a $2,500 yearly 
membership fee and up to $4,000 per ride. As it turned 
out, there just weren’t enough people willing to pay that 
stiff of a fee for the service. In addition, a private jet ride 
isn’t something people need frequently, so BlackJet 
wasn’t an option that was foremost on people’s minds. 
“If you have to reacquire the customer every six months, 
they’ll forget you,” said Howard Morgan, co-founder of 
first Round Capital, in the same Wall Street Journal ar-
ticle mentioned above. further compounding BlackJet’s 
challenge, there are readily available substitutes for 
BlackJet’s service. Anyone can book a first-class seat on 
an airline and ride in relative luxury, without having to pay 
a yearly membership fee. BlackJet closed in late 2013, 
after only about a year in service.
Ridejoy was a carpooling service that focused on 
connecting people that wanted to share rides for long 
distances, such as los Angeles to San francisco. lyft 
and Uber, mentioned earlier, focus on short rides. Ridejoy 
experiened early success. During its first year, 2011, its 
user base grew about 30 percent a month, with more 
than 25,000 drivers signed up and an estimated 10,000 
rides completed. But it didn’t grow fast enough to satisfy 
its investors. In addition, it had competition from free 
alternatives, such as carpooling forums on college web-
sites. Also, some riders started cutting Ridejoy out once 
they got to know one another. Instead of paying Ridejoy 
its 10 percent transaction fee for a trip from Portland to 
San francisco, for example, the car owner and riders 
would just exchange cash among each other instead 
of paying by credit card on Ridejoy’s website or mobile 
app. Ridejoy shut down in the summer of 2013, returning 
about half of its funding to its investors.
neighborrow.com would let people list household 
items for rent, such as vacuum cleaners, cameras, 
tools, and electronics. The idea was that if you only 
use a power saw or a high-end camera once or twice 
a year, why buy one if your next-door neighbor has 
exactly what you need and would be willing to rent it 
to you for a modest fee. The site got plently of public-
ity when it launched, including a story in USA today 
and a spot on nBC’s early morning program, the today 
Show. It also had thousands of people sign up and 
list their items. The problem: very few people actually 
used the service. What the company eventually found 
is that people don’t like borrowing things. In addition, 
borrowing an item such as a power drill isn’t typically 
an urgent need, so people didn’t tend to think “oh, I 
could get that through neighborrow.com.” Although 
they may have read about the company in USA today 
or seen it featured on television, they soon forgot about 
the service. neighborrow.com folded in 2011, after a 
five-year run.
Questions for Critical Thinking
 1. Prior to launching their firms, how could BlackJet, 
Ridejoy, and neighborrow.com have better 
 anticipated the issues that ultimately caused them 
to fail?
 2. In regard to putting together an effective business 
model, what can other peer-to-peer business model 
start-ups learn from the failures of BlackJet, Ridejoy, 
and neighborrow.com?
 3. Spend some time looking at lyft, one of the successful 
peer-to-peer business model companies mentioned in 
this feature. Why do you think lyft has been successful 
while BlackJet, Ridejoy, and neighborrow.com failed?

this point. Even though the peer-to-peer business model is currently hot, with 
homeruns such as Airbnb and Uber, utilizing the peer-to-peer business model 
is not sufficient to guarantee firm success.
disruptive business models
The second category is disruptive business models. Disruptive business 
models, which are rare, are ones that do not fit the profile of a standard busi-
ness model, and are impactful enough that they disrupt or change the way 
business is conducted in an industry or an important niche within an indus-
try.8 In Table 4.2, we describe actual disruptive business models that were 
used by four different companies.
There are three types of disruptive business models. The first type is called 
new market disruption. A new market disruption addresses a market that 
previously wasn’t served. An example is Google and its AdWords program. 
AdWords allows an advertiser to buy keywords on Google’s home page, which 
triggers text-based ads to the side of (and sometimes above) the search results 
when the keyword is used. So, if you type the words “organic snacks” into the 
Google search bar, you will see ads paid for by companies that have organic 
snacks to sell. The ads are usually paid for on a pay-per-click basis. The cost 
of keywords varies depending on the popularity of the word. Prior to the ad-
vent of AdWords, online advertising was cost prohibitive for small businesses. 
At one time Yahoo, for example, required advertisers to spend at least $5,000 
creating a compelling banner ad and $10,000 for a minimum ad buy. AdWords 
changed that. Its customers could set up a budget and spend as little as $1 per 
day (depending on the keywords that they purchased). Thus, AdWords was a 
new market-disruptive business model in that it provided a way for small busi-
nesses, in large numbers, to advertise online.
The second type of disruptive business model is referred to as a low-end 
market disruption. This is a type of disruption that was elegantly written about 
by Harvard professor Clayton Christensen in the book The Innovator’s Dilemma.9 
Low-end disruption is possible when the firms in an industry continue to improve 
products or services to the point where they are actually better than a sizable 
portion of their clientele needs or desires. This “performance oversupply” creates 
a vacuum that provides an opportunity for simple, typically low-cost business 
models to exist. Examples here include Southwest Airlines in the United States 
and Ryanair in Europe. Southwest created its point-to-point, low-cost, no-frills 
business model as an alternative to higher-end service offerings provided by leg-
acy carriers such as United and American. By actually offering what some would 
conclude is inferior service relative to its competitors, Southwest was able to at-
tract a large clientele that still wanted a safe and comfortable ride, but were will-
ing to trade off amenities for a lower fare. Low-end disruptive business models are 
also introduced to offer a simpler, cheaper, or more convenient way to perform an 
everyday task. If a start-up goes this route, the advantages must be compelling 
and the company must strike a nerve for disruption to take place. An example of 
 4. What role do you think the industry that a start-up 
is in plays in its suceess or failure as a peer-to-peer 
 business? Are some industries more receptive to peer-
to-peer business model start-ups than others? Explain 
your answers.

a firm that’s pulled this off is Uber, a 2009 start-up that connects people needing 
a ride with the owners of private cars willing to provide rides. Uber, which is the 
subject of Case 14.1, provides a compelling set of features—cars are ordered by 
sending a text message or via an app, customers can track their reserved car’s 
location, payment is made through the app so no cash trades hands between the 
passenger and the driver, and Uber maintains strict quality standards for the 
cars and drivers that participate in its service. Uber not only offers a cheaper and 
more convenient way to perform an everyday task (i.e., getting a ride), but has 
also struck a nerve.10 The taxi industry scores low on most measures of customer 
satisfaction, so consumers were eager to try something new. Uber also appeals to 
technologically savvy people, who see a big advantage in using an app to order a 
ride as opposed to the often frustrating process of hailing a cab.

so it is easy to see the individual parts and their interrelationships. One widely-
used framework is the Business Model Canvas, popularized by Alexander 
Osterwalder and Yves Pigneur in their book, Business Model Generation.11 The 
Business Model Canvas consists of nine basic parts that show the logic of how 
a firm intends to create, deliver, and capture value for its stakeholders. You 
can view the Business Model Canvas via a simple Google search.
The business model framework used here, the Barringer/Ireland Business 
Model Template, is shown in Figure 4.2. It is slightly more comprehensive than the 
Business Model Canvas in that it consists of 4 major categories and 12 individual 
parts. The 12 parts make up a firm’s business model. The job of the entrepreneur, 
or team of entrepreneurs, is to configure their firm’s business model in a manner 
that produces a viable and exciting business. The Barringer/Ireland Business 
Model Template is a tool that allows an entrepreneur to describe, project, revise, 
and pivot a business model until all 12 parts are decided upon. Appendix 4.1 
contains an expanded version of the Barringer/Ireland Template shown here. The 
12 parts are spread out, which provides space for ideas to be recorded, scratched 
out, and recorded again as ideas morph and change. Feel free to copy and use the 
template to help formulate the business model for an individual firm.
Next, we discuss each of the 4 categories and the 12 individual elements of 
a firm’s business model. We will refer frequently to Figure 4.2 throughout the 
discussion.
core Strategy
The first component of a business model is core strategy. A core strategy 
describes how the firm plans to compete relative to its competitors.12 The pri-
mary elements of core strategy are: business mission, basis of differentiation, 
target market, and product/market scope.
Many entrepreneurs 
 enlarge their business 
model templates and place 
them on a whiteboard. 
This practice provides a 
means to step back and 
look at how all the parts 
of a prospective business 
model fit together.

business Mission  A business’s mission or mission statement describes 
why it exists and what its business model is supposed to accomplish.13 If 
carefully written and used properly, a mission statement can articulate a busi-
ness’s overarching priorities and act as its financial and moral compass. A 
firm’s mission is the first box that should be completed in the business model 
template. A well-written mission statement is something that a business can 
continually refer back to as it makes important decisions in other elements of 
its business model.
At a 50,000-foot level, a mission statement indicates how a firm intends 
to create value for stakeholders. For example, Zynga’s mission is “Connecting 
the world through games.” Zynga is a producer of social games, such as 
FarmVille and Texas HoldEm Poker, which can be played through its website 
and social networking platforms such as Facebook and Google+. Although 
Zynga’s mission statement is short and to the point, it provides direction 
for how the other elements of its business model should be configured. The 
company will focus on games, as opposed to other business pursuits, and 
its games will be social, meaning that they will be designed to be played with 
other people. The remaining 11 parts of Zynga’s business model should sup-
port these basic premises.

There are several rules of thumb for writing mission statements. A business’s 
mission statement should:
■ Define its “reason for being”
■ Describe what makes the company different
■ Be risky and challenging but achievable
■ Use a tone that represents the company’s culture and values
■ Convey passion and stick in the mind of the reader
■ Be honest and not claim to be something that the company “isn’t”
basis of Differentiation  It’s important that a business clearly articulate 
the points that differentiate its product or service from competitors.14 This 
is akin to what some authors refer to as a company’s value proposition. A 
company’s basis of differentiation is what causes consumers to pick one 
company’s products over another’s.15 It is what solves a problem or satisfies a 
customer need.
When completing the basis for differentiation portion of the Barringer/
Ireland Business Model Template, it’s best to limit the description to two to 
three points. Also, make sure that the value of the points is easy to see and 
understand. For example, ZUCA (www.zuca.com) is a backpack on rollers. It 
was designed by Laura Udall as an alternative to traditional backpacks when 
her fourth-grade daughter complained daily that her back hurt from carrying 
her backpack. The ZUCA has two distinct points of differentiation: It relieves 
back pain by putting backpacks on rollers and it is sturdy enough for either 
a child or adult to sit on. The company’s website frequently features photos of 
kids sitting on the ZUCA seat, which anyone could imagine might be handy for 
kids waiting for the school bus. These are points of differentiation that are easy 
to grasp and remember. They are the reasons that some parents will choose 
ZUCA’s product and solution over others.
Making certain that your points of differentiation refer to benefits rather 
than features is another important point to remember when determining a 
firm’s basis of differentiation. Points of differentiation that focus on features, 
such as the technical merits of a product, are less compelling than those that 
focus on benefits, which is what a product can do. For example, when Laura 
Udall introduced the ZUCA, she could have focused on the features of the 
product and listed its points of differentiation as follows: (1) is pulled like a 
suitcase rather than worn on the back, (2) includes a sturdy aluminum frame, 
and (3) is available in six colors. While features are nice, they typically don’t 
entice someone to buy a product. A better approach for Udall would have been 
to focus on the benefits of the product: (1) relieves back pain by putting back-
packs on rollers, (2) is sturdy enough for either an adult or child to sit on, and 
(3) strikes the ideal balance between functionality and “cool” for kids. This set 
of points focuses on benefits. It tells parents how buying the product will en-
hance their son or daughter’s life.
Target Market  The identification of the target market in which the firm will 
compete is extremely important.16 As explained in Chapter 3, a target market 
is a place within a larger market segment that represents a narrower group of 
customers with similar interests.17 Most new businesses do not start by sell-
ing to broad markets. Instead, most start by identifying an emerging or under-
served niche within a larger market.18
A firm’s target market should be made explicit on the business model 
template. Her Campus’s target market is active college females. Zynga’s tar-
get market is online game enthusiasts. A target market can be based on any 
relevant variable, as long as it identifies for a firm the group of like-minded 
customers that it will try to appeal to. For example, Hayley Barna and Katia 

CHAPTER 4 | DEvEloPIng An EffEctivE BUSInESS MoDEl    145
Beauchamp, the founders of Birchbox, wrote the following about their com-
pany’s target market:
From the start, we’ve always said that our target market isn’t a specific demo-
graphic, but instead a psychographic—we believe that Birchbox appeals to women 
of all ages and backgrounds as long as they are excited to try new things and 
learn through discovery.19
This type of awareness of a firm’s intended market, and the people who are the 
most likely to respond positively to a firm’s product or service, is helpful in build-
ing out all the elements of a firm’s business model. For example, targeting women 
of all ages and backgrounds who are excited to try new things and learn through 
discovery requires a certain set of core competencies (we define core competen-
cies in the next section). It requires identifying and hiring people who have the 
ability to build anticipation and can locate partners and suppliers that have ex-
citing new products that appeal to all age groups. If Barna and Beauchamp had 
instead identified Birchbox’s target market as females ages 16–31, and left the 
“try new things and learn through discovery” part out, a different set of core com-
petencies may have been needed for Birchbox’s overall business model to work. 
The same philosophy applies across the business model template. The target 
market a firm selects affects everything it does, from the key assets it acquires to 
the financing or funding it will need to the partnerships it forms.
Product/Market Scope  The fourth element of core strategy is product/ 
market scope. A company’s product/market scope defines the products and 
markets on which it will concentrate. Most firms start narrow and pursue adja-
cent product and market opportunities as the company grows and becomes finan-
cially secure. As explained earlier, new firms typically do not have the resources 
to produce multiple products and pursue multiple markets simultaneously.
An example is Dropbox, the online data storage company profiled in 
Case 2.1. When Dropbox was pitching its business idea, a challenge it had was 
that it was solving a problem that most people didn’t know they had. There 
were ways for people to transfer files from one device to another, such as USB 
memory sticks, e-mailing files to yourself, and so forth. Dropbox’s solution was 
much more elegant. Its service allows users to create a special folder on each 
of their devices, and sync and store data across devices. Dropbox completely 
solved the problem of working on a file on one device, such as an office com-
puter, and then not having it available on another device, such as a laptop at 
home. When Dropbox launched in 2008, it had a single product—its online 
data storage service. The initial market it pursued was tech-savvy people in the 
Silicon Valley. Since then, Dropbox’s market has expanded to all computer and 
Internet users; the firm now has 200 million customers. But for the first five 
years of its existence, it stuck to its initial product, preferring to continually im-
prove the quality of its online data storage service rather than developing new 
services. It wasn’t until 2013 that Dropbox added a second product through 
the acquisition of Mailbox, an e-mail processing service for mobile devices. 
Recently, the firm announced a third product, Carousel, which will be a digital 
gallery that will allow users to share their entire life’s memories. So in terms of 
product/market scope, Dropbox has progressed as follows:
■ Launch—Single product/Silicon Valley tech-savvy users
■ 1-2 years into existence—Single product/Growing number of Silicon Valley 
tech-savvy users and people they told about the service
■ 3-4 years into existence—Single product/All computer and Internet users
■ 5 years into existence—Two products/All computer and Internet users
■ 6 years into existence—Three products/All computer and Internet users

146    PART 2 | DEvEloPIng SUCCESSfUl BUSInESS IDEAS
This example illustrates a well-thought-out and executed expansion of product/
market scope.
In completing the Barringer/Ireland Business Model Template, a company 
should be very clear about its initial product/market scope and project 3-5 years 
in the future in terms of anticipated expansion. A bullet-point format, as shown 
for Dropbox above, is acceptable. Similar to all aspects of a company’s business 
model, its product/market scope will affect other elements of the model.
resources
The second component of a business model is resources. Resources are the 
inputs a firm uses to produce, sell, distribute, and service a product or ser-
vice.20 At a basic level, a firm must have a sufficient amount of resources to 
enable its business model to work.21 For example, a firm may need a patent 
(i.e., a key asset) to protect its basis of differentiation. Similarly, a business 
may need expertise in certain areas (i.e., core competencies) to understand the 
needs of its target market. At a deeper level a firm’s most important resources, 
both tangible and intangible, must be both difficult to imitate and hard to find 
a substitute for in order for the company’s business model to be competitive 
over the long term. A tangible resource that fits this criterion is Her Campus’s 
network of 4,000-plus volunteers. As mentioned earlier, it would take a tre-
mendous effort for a competitor to amass a similar number of volunteers. In 
addition, there is no practical substitute for the work that 4,000-plus volun-
teers can do. An example of an intangible resource that fits the criterion is 
Zappos’s reputation for customer service. Zappos is consistently viewed very 
favorably for its ability to deliver a high level of customer service that is both 
difficult to imitate and hard to find a substitute for.
Resources are developed and accumulated over a period of time.22 As a 
result, when completing the Barringer/Ireland Business Plan Template, the 
current resources a company possesses should be the resources that are 
noted, but aspirational resources should be kept in mind. For example, it 
took time for Her Campus to recruit 4,000-plus volunteers. The company 
may have had 100 volunteers if and when it completed its first business 
model template. As a result, the proper notation under the Key Assets por-
tion of the Barringer/Ireland Business Model Template would have been “100 
volunteers” (with the goal of adding 100 volunteers a month) or whatever the 
exact number might have been.
Core Competencies  A core competency is a specific factor or capabil-
ity that supports a firm’s business model and sets it apart from its rivals.23 A 
core competency can take on various forms, such as technical know-how, an 
efficient process, a trusting relationship with customers, expertise in product 
design, and so forth. It may also include factors such as passion for a business 
idea and a high level of employee morale. A firm’s core competencies largely 
determine what it can do. For example, many firms that sell physical prod-
ucts do not do their own manufacturing because manufacturing is not a core 
competency. Instead, their core competencies may be in areas such as product 
design and marketing. The key idea is that to be competitive a business must 
be particularly good at certain things, and those certain things must be sup-
portive of all elements of its business model. For example, Netflix is particu-
larly good at supply chain management, which was essential during the years 
that Netflix’s business model was geared primarily towards delivering DVDs to 
customers via the mail. Without a core competency in supply chain manage-
ment, Netflix’s entire business model would not have worked.
Most start-ups will list two to three core competencies on the business 
model template. Consistent with the information provided above, a core compe-
tency is compelling if it not only supports a firm’s initiatives, but is also difficult 

CHAPTER 4 | DEvEloPIng An EffEctivE BUSInESS MoDEl    147
to imitate and substitute. Few start-ups have core competencies in more than 
two to three areas. For example, Her Campus has three core competencies:
■ Creating content of interest to active college-aged females
■ Recruiting and managing a volunteer network
■ Connecting active college-aged females with major brands
Similar to the Netflix and supply chain management example, Her Campus’s 
entire business model would be untenable absent these three core competen-
cies. In Her Campus’s case, an added advantage is that its core competencies 
are, at varying levels, difficult to imitate and hard to find substitutes for.
Key assets  Key assets are the assets that a firm owns that enable its 
business model to work.24 The assets can be physical, financial, intellectual, 
or human. Physical assets include physical space, equipment, vehicles, and 
distribution networks. Intellectual assets include resources such as patents, 
trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets, along with a company’s brand and 
its reputation. Financial assets include cash, lines of credit, and commitments 
from investors. Human assets include a company’s founder or founders, its key 
employees, and its advisors.
Firms vary regarding the key assets they prioritize and accumulate. All 
companies require financial assets to varying degrees. Retailers such as Whole 
Foods Markets and Amazon rely heavily on physical assets—Whole Foods 
because of its stores and Amazon because of its warehouses and distribu-
tion network. Companies such as Uber rely almost exclusively on intellectual 
assets. Uber does not employ the drivers that provide its customers rides or 
own the cars they ride in. It simply provides a technology-based platform that 
connects people wanting rides with people willing to provide them. As a result, 
Uber’s key assets are an app, its brand, and the relationships it has with its 
customers, drivers, and the communities in which it operates. Many compa-
nies rely heavily on human assets. The success of Zynga’s business model, 
for example, relies heavily on its ability to attract and retain a group of game 
Start-ups vary in terms of 
their core competencies. 
Here, two members of a 
start-up team are design-
ing a new product. The 
startup’s core competency 
is product design.

producers and programmers who are creative enough and proficient enough to 
continually come up with online games that are engaging and social.
Obviously, different key resources are needed depending on the business 
model that a firm conceives. In filling out the Barringer/Ireland Business 
Model Template, a firm should list the three to four key assets that it pos-
sesses that support its business model as a whole. In some cases, the ongoing 
success of a firm’s business model hinges largely on a single key resource. For 
example, Zynga has historically maintained an agreement with Facebook that 
provided Zynga a privileged position on Facebook’s platform. In 2013, that 
agreement came to end, which weakened Zynga’s business model and dimmed 
its future prospects.
financials
The third component of a business model focuses on its financials. This is the 
only section of a firm’s business model that describes how it earns money—
thus, it is extremely important. For most businesses, the manner in which it 
makes money is one of the most fundamental aspects around which its busi-
ness model is built.25 The primary aspects of financials are: revenue streams, 
cost structure, and financing/funding.
revenue Streams  A firm’s revenue streams describe the ways in which 
it makes money.26 Some businesses have a single revenue stream, while oth-
ers have several. For example, most restaurants have a single revenue stream. 
Their customers order a meal and pay for it when they’re finished eating. Other 
restaurants have several revenue streams. They may operate a restaurant, 
offer a catering service, and sell products at their counter, such as bottled 
barbeque sauce in the case of a barbeque restaurant. The nature of the way 
businesses make money also varies. Some businesses make money via one-
time customer payments, while others receive recurring revenue by selling a 
subscription service. Some businesses are very creative in the ways in which 
they make money. For example, many providers of online games offer the basic 
game for free, and generate most of their revenue from a small number of us-
ers who purchase premium products such as time-saving shortcuts, special 
weapons, and other features to enhance play.
The most common revenue streams are shown in Table 4.3. As noted 
above, many businesses have more than one revenue stream, primarily to le-
verage the value they are creating for their customers. For example, Birchbox 
has two revenue streams—its subscription service and its online store. For 
$10 a month, its subscribers receive four to five product samples. If a cus-
tomer wants to buy a full-sized version of one of the samples, it is available via 
Birchbox’s online store. For Birchbox, having two revenue streams makes per-
fect sense. The product samples introduce subscribers to products that they 
might not have known about otherwise. If a subscriber likes a particular prod-
uct and wants a full-sized version, it is available via Birchbox’s website. The 
arrangement is good for the subscriber and is good for Birchbox. It provides 
the subscriber a convenient way to buy a product that he or she just sampled, 
and provides Birchbox dual revenue streams.
The number and nature of a business’s revenue streams has a direct im-
pact on the other elements of its business model. All for-profit businesses need 
at least one revenue stream to fund their operations. Whether additional rev-
enue streams add or subtract value depends on the nature of the business and 
the other elements of its business model. It makes sense for Birchbox to have 
two revenue streams, as explained above. It also makes sense for a retail store, 
such as a bicycle shop, to not only sell bicycles (Revenue Stream #1), but to sell 
bicycle accessories (Revenue Stream #2), offer bicycle repair services (Revenue 

CHAPTER 4 | DEvEloPIng An EffEctivE BUSInESS MoDEl    149
Stream #3), and sponsor local bicycle races (Revenue Stream #4). In contrast, 
the seller of a smartphone app may charge a one-time download fee (Revenue 
Stream #1) and offer product upgrades (Revenue Stream #2). But the seller 
may stop short of selling online advertising (Potential Revenue Stream  #3), 
fearing that online advertising would detract from the experience of playing the 
game and lead to poorer user reviews and ultimately fewer downloads.
In filling out the Barringer/Ireland Business Model Template, you should 
clearly identify your revenue streams. Placing them in bullet-point format is 
preferable.
Cost Structure  A business’s cost structure describes the most important 
costs incurred to support its business model.27 It costs money to establish a 
basis of differentiation, develop core competencies, acquire or develop key as-
sets, form partnerships, and so on. Generally, the goal for this box in a firm’s 
business model template is threefold: identify whether the business is a cost-
driven or value-driven business, identify the nature of the business’s costs, 
and identify the business’s major cost categories.
Initially, it is important to determine the role of costs in a business. 
Businesses can be categorized as cost-driven or value-driven. Cost-driven busi-
nesses focus on minimizing costs wherever possible. An example is Warby 
Parker, the subject of Case 5.2. Warby Parker sells prescription glasses for 
$95, which is well below the price charged by stores like Pearle Vision and 
LensCrafters. To do this, Warby Parker’s entire business model is based on 
cost containment. Its glasses are designed in-house, manufactured overseas, 
and sold via the Web, eliminating many of the costs associated with traditional 
glasses manufacturing and retailing. Instead of concentrating on driving costs 
lower and lower relative to rivals’ cost structures, value-driven business models 
focus on offering a high-quality product (or experience) and personalized service. 
Optometrists routinely sell prescription glasses in the $400 to $500 price range. 
Table 4.3  Most Common revenue streams
revenue Stream
description
Advertising
Revenue generated from advertising a particular product or service in a newspaper, magazine, 
 website, or in some other manner.
Commissions
Revenue generated by bringing two parties together to complete a sale. Etsy and eBay generate 
revenue in this manner. The money usually comes from taking a small percentage of the sale price.
Download fee
Revenue generated by allowing a user to download a digital product, such as a smartphone app, 
an e-book, or a software product.
licensing
Revenue generated from charging for the use of a protected intellectual property, such as a 
 software product.
Matchmaking
Revenue generated by matching someone who wants temporary access to an asset or 
 competency with someone who owns an asset or has a competency and is willing to make it 
 available. This is how peer-to-peer networks work. Examples include Airbnb, TaskRabbit, and Uber.
Product Sale
Selling a physical good—such as a product in a retail store or on a website.
Renting/leasing
Revenue generated by renting or leasing an asset such as a rental car, a copy machine, or a piece 
of specialized machinery.
Service Sale
Selling a service—such as a meal in a restaurant or a car repair.
Subscription Service
Selling a subscription—such as netflix for DvDs or streaming of content, or Birchbox for 
lifestyle samples.

150    PART 2 | DEvEloPIng SUCCESSfUl BUSInESS IDEAS
The additional value they provide is a wide selection, personalized service select-
ing and fitting the glasses, and free follow-on services if the glasses need to be 
adjusted or repaired.
Next, it’s important to identify the nature of a business’s costs. Most 
businesses have a mainly fixed-cost or variable-cost structure. Fixed costs 
are costs that remain the same despite the volume of goods or services 
 provided. Variable costs vary proportionally with the volume of goods or 
 services produced. The reason that it’s important to know this is that it 
 impacts the other elements of a firm’s business model. Developing smart-
phone apps, for example, involves large fixed costs (i.e., the coding and 
 development of the app) and small variable costs (i.e., the incremental costs 
associated with each additional app that is sold). As a result, a large amount 
of money will be needed up front, to fund the initial development, but not 
so much downstream, to fund the ongoing sales of the app. In  contrast, 
a business such as a sub sandwich shop may have low fixed costs and 
high variable costs. The initial cost to set up the business may be  modest, 
 particularly if it is located in a leased facility, but the cost of labor and 
 ingredients needed to prepare and serve the sandwiches may be high rela-
tive to the prices charged. This type of business may need a smaller up-front 
investment but may require a line of credit to fund its ongoing operations. 
Other elements of the business model may also be affected. For example, a 
business with substantial fixed costs, such as an airline, has typically made 
a major investment in key assets. A service-based company may have few 
key assets but may have core competencies and a partnership network that 
allows it to source raw materials, prepare products, and reliably deliver the 
finished products to its customers.
The third element of cost structure is to identify the business’s major cost 
categories. At the business model stage, it is not necessary to establish a bud-
get or prepare pro-forma financial projections. It is necessary, however, to have 
a sense of a firm’s major categories of costs. For example, Facebook’s major 
categories of costs are data center costs, marketing and sales, research and 
development, and general and administrative. This type of breakdown helps a 
business understand where its major costs will be incurred. It will also provide 
anyone looking at the business model template a sense of the major cost items 
that a company’s business model relies on.
Financing/Funding  Finally, many business models rely on a certain 
amount of financing or funding to bring their business model to life. For 
 example, Birchbox’s business model may have looked elegant on paper, but 
the firm needed an infusion of investment dollars to get up and running. Most 
businesses incur costs prior to the time they generate revenue. Think of a 
business such as SuperJam, the subject of the opening feature in Chapter 1. 
Prior to earning revenue the company had to design its product, arrange for 
manufacturing, purchase inventory, acquire customers, and ship its product 
to its customers. This sequence, which is common, typically necessitates an 
infusion of up-front capital for the business to be feasible. Absent the capital, 
the entire business model is untenable.
Some entrepreneurs are able to draw from personal resources to fund their 
business. In other cases, the business may be simple enough that it is funded 
from its own profits from day one. In many cases, however, an initial infusion 
of funding or financing is required, as described above. In these cases, the 
business model template should indicate the approximate amount of funding 
that will be needed and where the money is most likely to come from.
Similar to cost structure, at the business model stage projections do not 
need to be completed to determine the exact amount of money that is needed. 
An approximation is sufficient. There are three categories of costs to consider: 
capital costs, one-time expenses, and provisions for ramp-up expenses. In 

CHAPTER 4 | DEvEloPIng An EffEctivE BUSInESS MoDEl    151
regard to capital costs, this category includes real estate, buildings, equip-
ment, vehicles, furniture, fixtures, and similar capital purchases. These costs 
vary considerably depending on the business. A restaurant or retail store 
may have substantial capital costs, while a service business may have little 
or no capital costs. The second category includes one-time expenses such as 
legal expenses to launch the business, website design, procurement of initial 
inventory, and similar one-time expenses and fees. All businesses incur at 
least some of these expenses. Finally, a business must allow for ramp-up ex-
penses. Many businesses require a ramp-up period in which they lose money 
until they are fully up to speed and reach profitability. For example, it usually 
takes a new fitness center several months to reach its membership goals and 
achieve profitability. It’s important to have cash set aside to make it through 
this period.
operations
The final quadrant in a firm’s business model focuses on operations. Operations 
are both integral to a firm’s overall business model and represent the day-to-
day heartbeat of a firm. The primary elements of operations are: product (or 
service) production, channels, and key partners.
Product (or Service) Production  This section focuses on how a firm’s 
products and/or service are produced. If a firm sells physical products, the 
products can be manufactured or produced in-house, by a contract manu-
facturer, or via an outsource provider. This decision has a major impact on 
all aspects of a firm’s business model. If it opts to produce in-house, it will 
need to develop core competencies in manufacturing and procure key assets 
related to the production process. It will also require substantial up-front 
investment. If a firm that produces a physical product opts to use a contract 
manufacturer or an outsource provider, then a critical aspect of its business 
model is its ability to locate a suitable contract manufacturer or outsource 
provider. This is not a trivial activity. It’s often difficult to find a contract 
manufacturer or outsource provider that will take a chance on a start-up. As 
a result, in the Barringer/Ireland Business Model Template, it is not suffi-
cient to complete this box by simply saying “Manufacturing will be completed 
by a contract manufacturer.” The exact name of the manufacturer is not 
necessary, but a general sense of what part of the world the manufacturer is 
located in and the type of arrangement that will be forged with the manufac-
turer is needed.
If a firm is providing a service rather than a physical product, a brief 
description of how the service will be produced should be provided. For ex-
ample, Rover.com, the subject of Case 2.2, is a service that matches people 
who need their dogs watched while they are out of town with individuals who 
are willing to watch and care for dogs. The business model template needs to 
briefly report how this works. The explanation does not need to be lengthy, 
but it needs to be substantive. For example, an acceptable description for 
Rover.com is as follows:
Rover.com will connect dog owners and dog sitters via a website. The dog sitters will 
be screened to ensure a quality experience. Customer support will be provided 24/7 
to troubleshoot any problems that occur. Pet insurance is provided that covers any 
medical bills that a dog has while in the care of a Rover.com sitter.
This brief statement provides a great deal of information about how Rover.
com works and how the elements of its business model need to be configured. 
This is information that isn’t provided in another box in the business model 
template.

152    PART 2 | DEvEloPIng SUCCESSfUl BUSInESS IDEAS
Channels  A company’s channels describe how it delivers its product or service 
to its customers.28 Businesses sell direct, through intermediaries, or through a 
combination of both.
Many businesses sell direct, through a storefront and/or online. For 
 example, Warby Parker sells its eyewear via its website and in a small number 
of company-owned stores. It does not sell via intermediaries, such as distribu-
tors and wholesalers. In contrast, SuperJam sells direct, via its website, and 
also through supermarkets throughout the country. It utilizes distributors and 
wholesalers to get its bikes into stores. Some companies sell strictly through 
intermediaries. For example, some of the manufacturers that sell via Zappos 
and Amazon do not maintain a storefront or sell via a website of their own. 
They strictly rely on broadly trafficked sites such as Zappos and Amazon to 
sell their products.
The same holds true for firms that sell services. Hotels, for example, sell 
their services (typically rooms) directly through their websites and telephone 
reservation services, and also through intermediaries such as travel agents, tour 
operators, airlines, and so forth. For example, if you were planning a trip to San 
Francisco, you could book your flight, rental car, and hotel through Travelocity, 
Expedia, or many other similar services. In this instance, Travelocity and the 
others act as intermediaries for the service providers.
A firm’s selection of channels affects other aspects of its business model. 
Warby Parker maintains a simple channels strategy, selling strictly through its 
website and a small number of company-owned stores. Its price point is low 
enough that it must capture 100 percent of its margins for itself for its business 
model to work. In contrast, GoPro sells its cameras through its website, via on-
line outlets such as Amazon and BestBuy.com, and through hundreds of retail 
stores in the United States and abroad. It utilizes intermediaries, such as whole-
salers and distributors, to help it find new outlets. GoPro has a value-driven cost 
structure, so it can afford to share some of its margins with channel partners. 
The advantage of GoPro’s approach is wide dissemination of its products both 
online and in retail outlets.
Some firms employ a sales force that calls on potential customers to try to 
close sales. This is an expensive strategy but necessary in some instances. For 
example, if a firm is selling a new piece of medical equipment that needs to be 
demonstrated to be sold, fielding a sales force may be the only realistic option.
Key Partners  The final element of a firm’s business model is key partners. 
Start-ups, in particular, typically do not have sufficient resources (or funding) 
to perform all the tasks needed to make their business models work, so they 
rely on partners to perform key roles. In most cases, a business does not want 
to do everything itself because the majority of tasks needed to build a prod-
uct or deliver a service are outside a business’s core competencies or areas of 
expertise.
The first partnerships that many businesses forge are with suppliers. A 
supplier (or vendor) is a company that provides parts or services to another 
company. Almost all firms have suppliers who play vital roles in the function-
ing of their business models. Traditionally, firms maintained an arm’s-length 
relationship with their suppliers and viewed them almost as adversaries. 
Producers needing a component part would negotiate with several suppliers 
to find the best price. Today, firms are moving away from this approach and 
are developing more cooperative relationships with suppliers. More and more, 
managers are focusing on supply chain management, which is the coordination 
of the flow of all information, money, and material that moves through a prod-
uct’s supply chain. The more efficiently an organization can manage its supply 
chain, the more effectively its entire business model will work.

CHAPTER 4 | DEvEloPIng An EffEctivE BUSInESS MoDEl    153
Along with suppliers, firms partner with other companies to make their 
business models work. The most common types of relationships, which include 
strategic alliances and joint ventures, are shown in Table 4.4. The advantages 
of participating in partnerships include: gaining access to a particular resource, 
risk and cost sharing, speed to market, and learning.29 An example is a partner-
ship between Zynga, the online games company, and Hasbro, a long-time maker 
of board games. In 2012, the two companies formed a partnership, which re-
sulted in the production of Zynga-themed adaptations of classic Hasbro games. 
Hasbro now makes a board game called FarmVille Hungry Hungry Herd, which 
is an adaptation of Zynga’s popular FarmVille online game. The partnership 
is good for both Zynga and Hasbro. It provides Zynga a new source of revenue 
and entry into a new industry, board games, and it provides Hasbro a fresh 
new game to sell to its customers.30 Partnerships also have potential disadvan-
tages.31 The disadvantages include loss of proprietary information, management 
complexities, and partial loss of decision autonomy.32
When completing the Barringer/Ireland Business Model Template, you 
should identify your primary supplier partnerships and other partnerships. 
Normally, a start-up begins with a fairly small number of partnerships, which 
grows over time.
One trend in partnering, utilized by all types of businesses, is to use free-
lancers to do jobs that are outside their core competencies. A freelancer is an 
independent contractor that has skills in a certain area, such as software de-
velopment or website design. There are several Web platforms that are making 
it increasingly easy to identify and find qualified freelancers. These platforms 
are highlighted in the Partnering for Success boxed feature.

Odesk, Elance, and Guru: Platforms That Facilitate the Forming  
of Partnerships with Freelancers

a 
freelancer is an independent contractor that has skills 
in a certain area, such as website design, search en-
gine optimization (SEo), or marketing. Start-ups hire 
freelancers for two reasons. first, they fill gaps that com-
panies have in their expertise. for example, a business 
may need to develop a social media strategy, but lack 
capabilities in that area. There are freelancers who are 
social media specialists, who can quickly and effectively 
help a business design a social media strategy. Second, 
freelancers can be hired on an “as needed” basis, so they 
are typically cheaper than hiring a part-time employee. In 
addition, if a business hires a freelancer for a project and 
it doesn’t work out, a decision can be made to not hire the 
same person again. It is more difficult to separate from a 
part-time or full-time employee.
There are a growing number of Web-based platforms 
that make it easy to identify and hire experienced free-
lancers. odesk (www.odesk.com), Elance (www.elance.
com), and guru (www.guru.com) are popular examples. 
The platforms are services that allow freelancers to 
identify themselves and allow anyone needing a free-
lancer to browse through the listings to find a good 
fit. for example, guru lists freelancers by category, 
which includes IT & Programming, Design & Multimedia, 
Writing and Translation, Sales & Marketing, and several 
others. The freelancers post their photo, an explana-
tion of their expertise, an overview of their experience 
and job history, their hourly rate, and a portfolio of their 
work. Elance posts statistics that reflect the freelancers’ 
ratings from previous jobs, the number of jobs that have 
been obtained through Elance, and comments from pre-
vious clients. for example, at the time this feature was 
written a freelancer named Chris S. had completed five 
jobs through Elance with a perfect five-star rating from 
clients. one of his clients wrote, “Chris did again a great 
job on a PHP/WordPress type project. great communi-
cation and turn around as usual.” This type of feedback 
provides future clients assurance that Chris might be 
worth a try for a similar project. Chris charges $46 per 
hour. While that number may seem high, if Chris is a 
proficient programmer and designer, and turns around 
work on time, he may be well worth it. He’ll also only 
charge for the number of hours it takes him to complete 
a job.
over time, companies often become comfortable 
with individual freelancers, and the relationship becomes 
more of a partnership than an arms-length arrangement. 
The platforms make money by taking a percentage of 
the money that the freelancers are paid. The amounts 
vary—odesk takes 10 percent, while Elance charges 
8.75 percent. There are protections built into the ser-
vices to prevent freelancers from taking money and not 
completing a job. Sites such as Elance and guru, which 
initially focused on IT freelancers, have expanded their 
offerings. Companies can now find qualified freelancers 
to reliably plug almost any skill gap that they have.
Questions for Critical Thinking
 1. Imagine that you are the founder of a company and 
need help setting up QuickBooks for your company. 
QuickBooks is an accounting and bookkeeping plat-
form for small businesses. Search guru, Elance, and 
odesk for QuickBooks freelancers. Select the one that 
you think represents the best combination of expertise, 
experience, and cost. Summarize the key attributes of 
the person you selected.
 2. To what degree is it appropriate or inappropriate to hire 
freelancers to fulfill some of the core competencies of 
a business?
 3. Make a bullet-point list of the advantages of hiring 
freelancers to do short-term projects for a start-up.
 4. In what ways do you believe that a freelancer could be-
come a partner of a company rather than an arms-length 
independent contractor?

Chapter Summary
business model and are impactful enough 
that they disrupt or change the way busi-
ness is conducted in an industry or in an 
important segment or niche of an indus-
try. A new market disruption and a low-
end market disruption are the two types of 
disruptive models. A new market disrup-
tion finds a firm using a business model 
through which it is able to address a mar-
ket that wasn’t previously served (think of 
Google as an example). A low-end market 
disruption is possible when firms already 
competing in an industry are providing 
customers with products or services that 
exceed their expectations or desires. This 
“performance oversupply” creates an op-
portunity for an entrepreneurial venture 
to enter an industry for the purpose of 
providing customers with the product or 
service functionality that more closely 
approximates what they want. Low-cost 
business models are often used to cre-
ate a low-end market disruption (think of 
Southwest Airlines in the United States 
and Ryanair in Europe as examples).
 lO3. Comprehensive in scope, the Barringer/
Ireland Business Model Template features 4 
major categories and 12 individual parts (see 
Figure 4.2). As a tool, entrepreneurs can use 
this business model template to describe, 
project, revise, and pivot its intended actions 
until they are convinced that the model’s 
elements are integrated in a way that will 
yield an exciting and viable business firm. 
Core strategy, which describes how the firm 
plans to compete relative to rivals, is the first 
of the four major categories. The firm’s mis-
sion, basis of differentiation, target market, 
and product/market scope are the parts of 
the core strategy category. Resources, the 
second category, are the inputs a firm in-
tends to use to sell, distribute, and service 
its product or service. Core competency, 
which is a specific factor or capability that 
supports a firm’s business model and dif-
ferentiates it from competitors and key as-
sets, or the assets a firm owns that enable 
its business model to work, are the critical 
resources a firm needs to execute as called 
for by its chosen core strategy. The third 
category, financials, is concerned with how 
the firm intends to earn money. Revenue 
streams, which deal with the exact ways a 
firm earns revenue, cost structure, which 
 lO1. A business model is a firm’s recipe for how 
it intends to create, deliver, and capture 
value for stakeholders. In essence, a busi-
ness model deals with the core aspects of 
how a firm will conduct business and try 
to succeed in the marketplace. The qual-
ity of the business model a firm develops, 
as well as the quality of how that model is 
executed, affect the firm’s performance in 
both the short and long term. How well the 
different parts or elements of a business 
model fit together and are mutually sup-
portive affects its quality. The best busi-
ness models are developed and executed 
in ways that are difficult for competitors 
to understand and imitate. Moreover, the 
greater the difference between a firm’s 
business model and those of its competi-
tors, and assuming that the model has 
been effectively developed, the stronger 
the likelihood a firm will be competitively 
successful. Thus, an entrepreneurial firm 
wants to develop a business model that 
clearly specifies how the firm intends to be 
uniquely different from its competitors and 
create value for stakeholders as a result.
 lO2. There are several types of business mod-
els. However, it is important for an entre-
preneur to understand that no  particular 
type of business model is inherently supe-
rior to any other model. The “best” busi-
ness model is the one that allows a firm 
to effectively describe the value it intends 
to create for stakeholders and appropri-
ately details the actions it will take to 
create that value. Standard and disrup-
tive business models are two well recog-
nized categories of business models. We 
say “categories” because there are several 
types of standard models (see Table 4.1) 
and two types of disruptive models (dis-
cussed below). Standard business models 
depict or reveal plans or recipes firms can 
use to determine how they will create, 
deliver, and capture value for stakehold-
ers. Many of the standard models have 
been in existence for many years. When 
selecting a standard business model, an 
entrepreneurial venture believes that it 
can integrate the elements of that model 
uniquely as a means of creating value 
while competing against rivals. Disruptive 
business models, which are rare, are ones 
that do not fit the profile of a standard

business idea:  A café chain that integrates both local 
and international flavors for food enthusiasts all over the 
world.
pitch:  Secret Recipe Cakes and Café is no stranger to 
food enthusiasts, particularly in Malaysia. It has become 
a household name since its first establishment in 1997. 
With quality cakes, fusion food, and distinctive service as 
its core strategy, Secret Recipe has already developed 
a winning recipe for success. It is one of the leading and 
largest café chains in the country with more than 150 
outlets in Malaysia serving a variety of dishes and desserts 
that appeal to a wide range of customers. Serving more 
than 20 types of fusion food, 40 different types of cake 
creations, and an assortment of pastries, designer ice 
creams, and beverages, Secret Recipe has won the hearts 
of many Malaysians and has successfully established its 
brand name in the region.
The Secret Recipe business formula has also been 
successfully replicated internationally with more out-
lets located in Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia, the 
Philippines, China, Pakistan, and Brunei. In 14 years, 
Secret Recipe has expanded to a network of more than 
250 cafés.
Building a sustainable business with a strong brand was 
not an easy task for Secret Recipe. To be different, it had 
to identify features of its brand that could extend beyond 
one store or one country. Differentiation,  innovation, 
adaptability, research and development, consistency, 
identity, and brand promise were the key ingredients 
that have allowed Secret Recipe to enjoy worldwide 
success. Secret Recipe is one of the most successful 
home-grown café chains in the country, having won 
several awards, including the Homegrown franchise of 
the Year, International franchisor of the Year, franchise 
of the Year Best Sales growth Award, and Best Brand 
food & Beverage Café Award. Moreover, Secret Recipe 
has also grabbed several  international awards, such 
as the Best Casual Dining Restaurant of the Year 
2007/2008 in the Philippines, and Philippine Tatler’s 
Best Restaurant 2008. More recently Secret Recipe won 
the 2013 Putra Brand Award, which included the Most 
Enterprising Brand of the Year and the Silver Award in 
the category of retail food and beverage.
Secret Recipe is not only a café that offers a wide variety 
of cakes but it also offers a flexible menu with different 
items available in different countries. However, to identify 
itself as a truly Malaysian brand, a customer will be able 
to find Malaysian all-time favorites like nasi lemak (rice 
with spicy gravy) and mee goreng (fried noodles) in some 
of the overseas outlets as well. Secret Recipe will con-
tinue striving to surpass its own accomplishments and 
aims to be recognized as a leader in the industry both 
locally and globally.

health goals.
pitch:  one of the toughest issues facing American 
health care providers is motivating patients to take 
their medication on time. While 80 percent of adults in 
America take a combination of prescription drugs, over-
the-counter medications, and nutritional supplements, 
75 percent do not take their medications or supplements 
on time. failure to take medication on time increases 
health care costs and exacts a significant human toll. 
It’s associated with increased physician visits, increased 
hospitalizations, increased nursing home admissions, 
and increases in avoidable health care costs. Some 
experts have estimated that nationwide, not taking 
medicine on time costs the United States health care 
system $300 billion per year.
Mango Health is a smartphone app designed to tackle 
this problem. After downloading the app, a user simply 
enters the medications and supplements s/he is tak-
ing, pertinent information such as patient name, type of 
medication (tablets, syrup, etc.), how much is in the con-
tainer, and how often the medicine and/or supplements 
are to be taken. There are several additional core fea-

interactions exist among the drugs, supplements, and 
food and beverage products they are consuming. The 
app also allows users to maintain a health journal, where 
they can keep a log of their personal health activity and 
compare themselves to others taking the same medica-
tions or who have similar conditions. The app sends us-
ers a reminder when it’s time to take a medication. When 
the reminder goes off, the user is not allowed to ignore it. 
The app most be opened and the user must verify that “I 
took it” or additional reminders will be sent.
An attribute that separates Mango Health from similar 
apps is its gamification aspects. Each time a user takes a 
medicine or supplement on time, he or she earns points. 
There are eight different levels that can be achieved, de-
pending on the number of points a user accumulates. 
Each level is associated with a prize, such as a gift card to 
Whole foods, gap, or Target, or a donation to the user’s 
favorite charity. The rewards are used to incentivize people 
to keep taking their medications and supplements on time. 
The brands that offer the rewards benefit by bringing peo-
ple into their stores that care about health and wellness.
Mango Health plans to create a range of consumer 
health apps, all of which will include some form of gami-
fication incentives.

introduction
Etsy is an e-commerce website that focuses on 
 handmade or vintage items, as well as unique factory-
manufactured products. These items cover a wide range 
of product types, including jewelry, furniture, housewares, 
kitchen gadgets, clothing, and art. The site resembles an 
open craft fair, where sellers (mostly small merchants and 
local artisans) set up Etsy stores and sell their products to 
buyers, who are people that want unique, mostly hand-
made products from small/local producers. Etsy launched 
in 2005. As of late 2013, 30 million buyers and nearly one 
million sellers were registered on the Etsy website.
history
The idea for Etsy originated in a woodworking shop. 
Rob Kalin, who earned a college degree in the classics, 
bypassed the traditional job market to focus on his wood-
working talents. He created a unique product, a computer 
encased in wood, but couldn’t find a marketplace to sell 
it. So he, along with Chris Maguire, Jared Tarbell, and 
Haim Schoppik, launched Etsy, an online marketplace for 
crafts where hobbyists and artisans could connect with 
people interested in buying handmade goods.
from the beginning, Etsy championed the idea of 
community. The company saw itself as an advocate 
of small merchants and artisans. It also took steps to 
engage its community and empower its sellers. Every 
Monday evening Etsy sponsored craft night, where 50 to 
80 people came to its office in Brooklyn to make crafts. 
The company also sponsored employee craft nights 
where its employees would hone their craft-making tal-
ents. At the same time, Kalin started holding virtual town 
hall meetings with Etsy sellers to provide tips to them on 
how to increase their sales. All this was done in part to 
build community, but there was a broader purpose. Kalin 
and his team knew that Etsy’s financial success hinged 
on how much commerce flowed through its site.
Since it launched in 2005, Etsy has grown steadily. 
It currently employs more than 400 people in the United 
States and abroad and facilitates transactions in nearly 
200 countries. Etsy is still private, so it is not required 
to release financial data; but, the estimate is that ap-
proximately $1 billion worth of sales take place through 
Etsy’s website each year.
how etsy Works
To sell on Etsy, a seller registers and creates an online 
Etsy store. Creating a store is free. Each item in the 
store costs 20 cents to list. The prices in the store are 
determined by the seller. Etsy takes a 3.5 percent com-
mission on each sale. An example of an Etsy store is 
AHeirloom, which can be seen at https://www.etsy.
com/shop/AHeirloom. AHeirloom sells handmade wood 
items. one of its most popular items is kitchen cutting 
boards that come in the shape of states. At the time 
this case was written, AHeirloom had 209 items listed, 
ranging in price from $2 to $48. When a sale is made, 
AHeirloom collects the money and delivers the item to 
the buyer. Etsy bills AHeirloom and its others sellers 
once a month for its listing and commission fees.
To buy on Etsy, a customer can either use the 
search bar on Etsy’s home page to search for an item or 
can browse through a list of categories that includes Art, 
Home & living, Jewelry, Women, Men, Kids, vintage, 
Weddings, and Craft Supplies. A select number of items

are also featured each day on Etsy’s home page. When 
a buyer enters an Etsy online store, he or she can read 
reviews from past buyers and see how the seller stacks 
up on a five-star scale. AHeirloom, for example, has 
over 3,600 reviews and nearly a perfect five-star rating.
business model breakdown
At the heart of Etsy’s success is its business model. 
A business model is a firm’s plan or recipe for how it 
creates, delivers, and captures value for its stakehold-
ers. The Barringer/Ireland Business Model Template, 
completed for what Etsy looks like today, is shown 
nearby. The following is a breakdown of each of the 
four major categories of Etsy’s business model. What 
is particularly instructive is the way the model fits to-
gether. As you read through the description of each 
category, notice how it affects the other categories and 
Etsy’s business model as a whole.
core Strategy
Etsy’s mission is ambitious. It wants to “re-imagine com-
merce in ways that build a more fulfilling and lasting 
world.” To do this, Etsy has built its business around the 
neighborhood feel. Its focus is on constructing a way to 
shop that is meaningful to both sellers and buyers. To il-
lustrate this point, Etsy CEo Chad Dickerson said, “Etsy, 
technologically and culturally, is a platform that provides 
meaning to people, and an opportunity to validate their 
art, their craft.” To further articulate Etsy’s core values 
Dickerson said, “At the end of each transaction you get 
something real from a real person. There is existential 
satisfaction to that.” In addition to this set of values, Etsy 
is an advocate for small merchants and artisans. These 
are two categories of businesses that have been hurt by 
mass production and the advent of the big-box store. 
Etsy is helping bring back these businesses by providing 
them a platform to sell their products to a sizeable audi-
ence of buyers.
Etsy’s basis of differentiation flows from its mission 
to focus on handmade goods, the number of buyers 
and sellers on its site, and the sense of community that 
it has created. Although its website is easy to navigate, 
that’s not what differentiates Etsy from its rivals. Many 
online businesses have websites that are easy to navi-
gate. What differentiates Etsy are the factors mentioned 
above. It’s instructive to note that Etsy’s points of dif-
ferentiation are made possible by its core competencies 
and key assets. from the beginning, Etsy has excelled 
at helping its sellers increase sales via Web-based tools, 
educational materials, and offline events. It also set its 
business up in a way that encourages its sellers to build 
awareness of Etsy in general. Each seller has its own 
Etsy store. As sellers promote their Etsy stores, they 
introduce people to Etsy more broadly, which is a key 
factor that has enabled Etsy to grow so quickly.
Etsy has two target markets—its sellers and its buy-
ers. Its sellers are the producers of handmade goods. Its 
buyers are people drawn to the site because they want 
something unique, something that has a story. They 
want something that they enjoy telling other people 
about. It’s a different motivation for buying than shop-
ping at Walmart or on Amazon.com. This is what Etsy 
means by “re-imagining” commerce. Etsy’s product/
market scope has expanded since its inception. While 
the majority of items are still handmade, on october 1, 
2013, Etsy announced that it would allow factory-made 
goods on its site. This move, according to the company, 
was necessary to allow its most successful sellers to 
expand their businesses and keep them from leaving 
Etsy’s platform is designed 
to help people sell hand-
made items. This photo

the site. There are restrictions. The seller must design 
the product, or hire someone to design it, and be open 
about where it is made. Some controversy was caused 
by this move, but Etsy’s numbers continue to grow.
Resources
Etsy has three core competencies—the development of 
tools and educational materials to empower sellers, the 
growth of a vibrant community of buyers and sellers, and 
the ability to generate word-of-mouth awareness of its 
business. The first, which has been developed over time, 
includes tools and educational material to empower Etsy 
sellers. A key to Etsy’s success has been a recognition 
that its sellers, which it affectionately calls Etsians, must 
be successful for the site to work. As a result, from the 
beginning Etsy has focused on developing tools, edu-
cational materials, and offline events to assist its sellers. 
for example, each year Etsy sponsors an event called 
the Etsy Success Symposium, which is a physical and 
online gathering of Etsy sellers for the purpose of helping 
one another increase sales. Etsy produces a number of 
publications, including the Etsy Seller’s Handbook and the 
Etsy Success newsletter, both geared towards helping 
Etsy newbies and veterans boost their clientele. Etsy labs 
organizes community events for Etsy sellers, facilitates 
online workshops, and assembles Etsy teams, which are 
groups of sellers that organize around a particular loca-
tion or craft. These efforts have enabled Etsy to build and 
maintain a vibrant community of buyers and sellers.
As mentioned earlier, Etsy’s website is constructed in a 
way that has led to a core competency in generating word-
of-mouth awareness of its business. As sellers promote 
their Etsy stores, they promote Etsy more broadly. Etsy has 
also been a leader in social media, including major pres-
ences on both facebook and Twitter. The combination of 
these factors has been instrumental in Etsy’s growth.
In regard to key assets, Etsy’s platform is intuitive 
and easy to navigate. Its community of buyers and sell-
ers continues to grow. Its sellers populate its site with 
a continual influx of fresh new products, which keeps 
its buyers coming back. Etsy takes deliberate steps to 
add to its key assets in ways that support its mission 
and provide people another reason to engage in its site. 
for example, in early 2012 Etsy became a Certified B 
Corporation. B Corporations are a new type of company 
that uses the power of business to solve social and envi-
ronmental problems.

financials
Etsy has three revenue streams, including a 20 cent 
listing fee for each item listed on its site, a 3.5 percent 
commission on each item sold, and Search Ads, an 
advertising program that allows Etsy sellers to pro-
mote items in their online stores. This mix of revenue 
streams makes sense given Etsy’s core strategy and 
its resources. The larger and more engaged a commu-
nity it builds, the more revenue it will earn from listing 
fees and commissions. Etsy’s cost structure is based 
on cost containment and a high fixed/low variable cost 
model. Etsy has high infrastructure costs, driven by 
the network capacity and data storage necessary to 
service 30 million registered buyers and one million 
registered sellers, and the nearly one billion dollars of 
commerce that flows through its site each year. It also 
has a staff of 400 that manages the site and maintains 
the Etsy community. To support its core strategy, the 
firm has people with job titles that don’t exist in most 
businesses, such as Head of Seller Education (currently 
Danielle Maveal). Etsy’s variable costs are low. It costs 
Etsy very little to add  another buyer or seller to its site.
notable is the amount of funding that Etsy has 
raised—$97.3 million. The funding has been used to 
build out the company’s infrastructure, add employees, 
invest in strategies for expansion, and fund seller educa-
tion initiatives. Etsy is reported to be profitable. If this is 
the case, it is funding its operations in part through its 
own revenues.
Operations
Etsy’s website was built and is maintained by an in-
house staff of IT professionals. The site has a homespun 
rather than a highly polished look. This is intentional, 
although some critics have urged Etsy to up its game 
some in terms of site design and functionality. In terms 
of channels, Etsy’s main channel is its website. As 
mentioned earlier, Etsy is strictly a platform that brings 
buyers and sellers together. While a seller’s Etsy store 
resides on Etsy’s website, all of the logistics involved 
with the sales process are handled by the seller. This in-
cludes stocking the store, processing orders, collecting 
payment, and shipping the merchandise. This arrange-
ment relieves Etsy of the cost and responsibility of pro-
viding for those functions.
In terms of channels, the majority of sales flow 
through Etsy’s website. Etsy is experimenting with some 
additional channels. It has partnered with select retail 
chains, such as West Elm and nordstrom, to sell some 
Etsy products in its stores. It also has tried some special 
promotional events, such as setting up temporary physi-
cal storefronts in new York City during the Christmas 
season to feature products made by Etsy sellers.
Etsy has several key partners, or groups of partners, 
which improve its operations and help expand sales. In 
terms of operations, by publishing its API (Application 
Programming Interface), Etsy has enabled third-party 
developers to create tools that help Etsy sellers more 
efficiently manage their inventory and track their ship-
ments. Etsy works with a number of organizations and 
businesses to support crafts and homemade products. 
An example is Etsy’s involvement in new York’s annual 
Renegade Craft fair, which is an event that features and 
champions the work of artisans and small merchants. 
Etsy is also branching into areas that enable it to sup-
port small businesses and entrepreneurship in more 
general ways. for example, in 2013 Etsy announced 
plans to collaborate with local communities to teach 
entrepreneurship skills to residents. By doing this, Etsy 
is helping seed the next generation of Etsy sellers. All 
of these efforts are consistent with Etsy’s mission of re-
imagining commerce and acquainting as many people 
as possible with Etsy and the marketplace it facilitates.
challenges ahead
Etsy’s primary challenge will be to maintain the integrity 
of its business model while trying to grow. The complex-
ity of this challenge is starting to show. Many Etsy sell-
ers, for example, were not happy with the company’s 
decision to allow the sale of manufactured goods. But 
providing this option has allowed some of Etsy’s most 
successful sellers to effectively grow their businesses. 
A limitation of producing handmade goods is that it’s 
labor intensive. When artisans make something that 
sells well (such as a piece of jewelry or furniture), if they 
can’t offload some of the actual production of the good, 
their sales will be limited by the time they have to make 
it themselves. Sellers complain about rising fees, which 
may be an artifact of Etsy’s need to produce sufficient 
profits to satisfy investors. Its initial listing fee was 10 
cents per item, and it’s now 20 cents. Some also com-
plain about the lack of traditional marketing and would 
like to see Etsy take a more active role in driving traffic 
to its site. Recall that Etsy takes the opposite approach. 
It relies on its sellers to promote their Etsy stores, and 
benefits when the customers of individual sellers learn 
about Etsy more broadly.

CHAPTER 4 | DEvEloPIng An EffEctivE BUSInESS MoDEl    163
introduction
In 2005 Blake Mycoskie, a serial entrepreneur, needed 
a break. After starting 5 companies in 12 years, he trav-
eled to Argentina looking for some time to relax. He 
met some expatriates who were doing social work in 
villages on the outskirts of Buenos Aires and asked if he 
could tag along. In one village in particular, he noticed 
that most of the children didn’t have shoes. He stopped 
a few of the kids to look at their feet and saw cuts, 
abrasions, and infections. He knew the villagers were 
poor and couldn’t afford to buy their children shoes 
and wondered what he could do to help. He also knew 
there was an inexpensive shoe in Argentina called the 
alpargata. What would be the best way to provide poor 
Argentinean children alpargata shoes?
Mycoskie thought about starting a charity but felt 
the charity model wouldn’t work. He envisioned himself 
asking his family and friends for contributions, and knew 
they would contribute once, or twice, or maybe even 
several times. But it would be hard to continue to ask. 
What he needed was an approach that would sustain 
itself by selling a product that people needed to buy 
anyway. The approach Mycoskie came up with he later 
dubbed “one for one.” He would create a for-profit busi-
ness to sell alpargata shoes, and for every pair sold he’d 
donate a pair to a child in need.
Mycoskie returned to the United States and set 
up shop in Santa Monica, California. He started ToMS 
with no shoe industry experience. The company was 
originally called Shoes for Tomorrow but was quickly 
shortened to ToMS. To get started, Mycoskie went from 
one retail store to another with his unique business idea. 
A few los Angeles boutiques agreed to sell the shoes. 
His first break came when the Los Angeles times ran an 
article about his business. To Mycoskie’s surprise, the 
article spurred $88,000 in orders in a single weekend.
fast forward to today. ToMS is now an international 
brand. It’s one for one model has been expanded to 
include shoes, eyewear, and coffee. As of mid-2014, 
ToMS had given away 10 million pairs of shoes in 60 
countries, had helped restore sight for 200,000 people 
in 13 countries, and is providing clean water and sanita-
tion to villagers in 5 countries. The one-to-one model 
has been tweaked some, but the intention is the same. 
ToMS still gives away a pair of shoes for ever pair it 
sells. Eyewear was added in 2011. Rather than donat-
ing a pair of glasses for every pair its sells, ToMS do-
nates an equivalent amount of money that is used for 
sight-saving measures, such as eye surgery, medical 
treatment, or a new pair of prescription glasses. Coffee 
was added in 2014. for every bag of coffee that’s sold, 
ToMS donates an equivalent amount of money to pro-
vide clean water and sanitation for people who need it 
the most.
tomS’s business model
ToMS is known for pioneering the one-to-one business 
model. A firm’s business model is a plan or recipe for 
how it creates, captures, and delivers value to its stake-
holders. ToMS’s business model is unique in that it 
combines the goals of a for-profit company with the am-
bitions of a philanthropic organization. ToMS’s business 
model template is shown nearby. The following is a brief 
overview of each of the major sections of the business 
model template.
core Strategy
ToMS’s mission is “one for one.” The mission is made 
possible by the way ToMS is structured. ToMS has two 
parts. ToMS is a for-profit company that manages the 
overall operations and logistics. friends of ToMS is a 
nonprofit organization that assembles volunteers, deliv-
ers the shoes, and coordinates the eyewear/site restora-
tion and coffee/clean water initiatives.
An important decision Mycoskie and his team made 
early on, when ToMS was strictly a shoe company, was 
that the cost of providing shoes to children in need would 
be built into the shoes’ selling price. The same  approach 
now applies to eyewear and coffee. As a result, as long 
as ToMS sells its products, it can fulfill its philanthropic 
mission. It does not need to rely on donations, as most 
charities and nonprofits do, to sustain itself.
ToMS’s strategy is built on selling practical prod-
ucts. Shoes, eyewear, and coffee are products that are 
sold widely. Its shoes are pricey ($54 to $80 for a pair 
of simple slip-ons), but people know that when they 
buy ToMS shoes they are paying for a pair that will be 
donated to a child in need. ToMS relies heavily on vol-
unteers, interns, and partners to do much of its work. 
Many of the people who volunteer and work with ToMS 
are motivated by the company’s mission, which changes 
lives. In some countries, shoes are required in order to 
attend school. owning a pair of shoes provides a child a 
chance to be educated and to have a better life. ToMS 
is not reluctant to share these types of realities, which 
deeply resonate with volunteers and customers. ToMS 
has almost as many interns, for example, working in its 
facilities as employees. friends of ToMS works with non-
profits and ngos to distribute its products. It does this

in part because local organizations, already embedded in 
a country, know the needs better than ToMS does and 
can direct the company. An example is ToMS’s partner-
ship with the Seva foundation to implement its eyewear/
restore sight program. The Seva foundation runs sight 
programs in nepal, Tibet, and Cambodia. It is uniquely 
equipped to help ToMS make the best use of its dollars.
ToMS’s product/market scope now includes 
shoes, eyewear, and coffee. The company also has a 
“Marketplace” that sells a variety of items, including 
jewelry, household items, and tech products. The com-
pany’s “one for one” mission still applies, just in a differ-
ent form. If you buy a $140 Turquoise Alba necklace, for 
example, your purchase will get you the necklace and 
provide 11 meals for a child in need.
Resources
ToMS has been diligent in the execution of its one-to-
one model. Its products are appealing, its philanthropic 
efforts are making a difference, and it involves a lot of 
people in what it does. These factors have enabled 
ToMS to build a strong brand. Its core strategy is also 
working. It has remained sustainable without needing 
donations. ToMS has also excelled at creating excite-
ment and passion in others for what it is doing. It does a 
lot to elicit this. for example, every two weeks a group of 
ToMS volunteers travels to Argentina or another part of 
the world to make a “shoe drop,” which is the term that 
ToMS uses for distributing shoes. Anyone can apply for 
the trip, and for many it is a life-changing experience. 
Every shoe ToMS gives away is placed on a child’s foot 
by a ToMS volunteer. volunteers pay their own travel ex-
penses, but the trips are organized by ToMS.
ToMS also listens. It has both proponents and crit-
ics that are vocal in their feedback. Rather than ignoring 
the feedback, ToMS reacts, which encourages addi-
tional feedback. for example, one source of criticism 
that ToMS has faced is that when it gives a child a pair 
of shoes, it is a one-time event. The child will eventually 

CHAPTER 4 | DEvEloPIng An EffEctivE BUSInESS MoDEl    165
grow out of the shoes and be right back to where he 
or she started. ToMS acknowledged this criticism as a 
valid point, and has responded by putting a program in 
place that tracks the children to whom shoes have been 
provided. It makes sure the children receive additional 
shoes when needed.
ToMS has a number of key assets. It has a healthy 
corporate culture, which draws people in. It has an 
 entire apparatus to get people involved in its initiatives, 
including community groups, students, educators, 
and others. You can see ToMS’s work in this area by 
accessing the ToMS Community website (www.tom-
community.com). ToMS also frequently touts the work 
of its volunteers on its Twitter account, which is avail-
able at @ToMS. ToMS also organizes events, which 
are heartfelt and draw attention to its products and 
causes. The most popular event is its one Day Without 
Shoes campaign. This campaign was started in 2008 
to raise public awareness of the importance of shoes. 
It asks ordinary people to go one day without shoes, 
just to see how it feels. The point is to instill in people 
what a difference a simple pair of shoes can make, 
particularly for children. The campaign grows every 
year. You can see highlights of the most recent year’s 
campaign at www.toms.com/daywithoutshoes. In past 
years, people from over 25 countries have participated. 
Participants have included Kris Ryan, Charlize Theron, 
the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders, and employees from 
nordstrom, Microsoft, and Aol.
financials
ToMS’s revenue comes from product sales. ToMS is a 
cost-driven business. It contains costs via its partner-
ships, volunteer network, and by avoiding traditional 
marketing. ToMS does very little traditional marketing, 
such as print media, radio, and television. Instead, it 
relies on word-of-mouth, social media, and prominent 
placements in retail stores by its retail partners. ToMS 
does not manufacture its products. Instead, it relies 
on contract manufacturers and growers (for its cof-
fee) spread throughout the world. ToMS’s approach to 
manufacturing has raised eyebrows because it produces 
products in China, where labor practices are suspect. 
ToMS aggressively polices its manufacturers and other 
suppliers. It maintains strict standards that everyone 
in its supply chain is obligated to adhere to, particu-
larly when it comes to fairness to workers. ToMS’s 
employees regularly visit its manufacturers to monitor 
compliance.
ToMS funds it operations from profits. It also ben-
efits from the work of its volunteers.
Operations
To produce its products, ToMS manages a global sup-
ply chain. Its shoes are made in low-wage countries 
such as China, Argentina, and Ethiopia. Its eyewear is 
made in Italy. Its coffee beans are sourced from growers 
across the world and are roasted in the United States. 
Some of its most popular selections come from growers 
in Rwanda, Malawi, and guatemala. In regard to 
 distribution, ToMS delivers its products to its retail and 
online partners, who in turn sell to their customers.
ToMS does not drop ship or sell on a consignment 
basis.
Manufacturing and selling is only the first step in 
ToMS’s overall process. Its philanthropic efforts come 
next. To distribute its shoes, ToMS partners with non-
profits and ngos in the countries in which it distrib-
utes products. These organizations are called “giving 
Partners.” The giving Partners identify the children in 
need. The process of actually distributing the shoes 
is referred to as Shoe Drops. friends of ToMS helps 
coordinate the Shoe Drops. ToMS’s eyewear/restore 
sight and its coffee/clean water initiatives are executed 
in a similar manner. ToMS works with friends of ToMS 
and local organizations to make the distributions.
In regard to channels, ToMS sells its products 
through both retail and online outlets. over 500 retailers 
around the world now carry ToMS shoes. Its distribution 
network for eyewear and coffee is growing. A string of 
ToMS café-stores is on the drawing boards. The café-
stores will sell ToMS coffee in a coffee house setting 
and will sell ToMS shoes, eyewear, and other products 
in an adjacent retail setting. ToMS’s business model 
would not be possible without key partners. Its most 
important partners are friends of ToMS (its nonprofit 
subsidiary), the nonprofits and ngos that distribute its 
products, and its volunteers. ToMS also has a robust 
affiliate program.
criticisms of tomS
for some, it may be hard to imagine that ToMS has 
critics, but it does. Its critics point out flaws in ToMS’s 
approach, which some go as far as to say threaten the 
firm’s future.
The criticism focuses on three main issues. first, 
critics argue that ToMS, along with similar organiza-
tions, makes people in poor countries dependent on the 
good will of others rather than creating opportunities for 
them to take care of themselves. Many social entrepre-
neurs believe that the best way to create sustainable 
change in an impoverished country is through educa-
tion, job creation, and trade, rather than aid, which is 
what ToMS does. In fact, a mantra among some social 
entrepreneurs is “trade not aid.” Microfinance, which 
provides loans to people in developing countries to start 
their own businesses, is based on these principles. The 
second criticism is that ToMS has manufacturing facili-
ties in China and elsewhere where human rights viola-
tions have been documented. The third criticism is that 
by pouring a large number of free shoes into countries 
such as Argentina and Ethiopia, ToMS is inadvertently 
stymieing local entrepreneurship. The idea is that by

ness away from local companies, which provide not only 
shoes but jobs.

is tomS’s business model Sustainable?
The question is, “Is ToMS’s business model 
 sustainable for the future?” The primary threats to its 
business model stem from the criticisms it receives, 
its reliance on people continuing to pay a premium for 
its products, and whether the one-for-one movement 
will continue to resonate with volunteers and nonprofit 
partners. Another threat is the nature of the products 
that ToMS sells. on the one hand, selling a physical 
product mitigates ToMS’s risk because it does not 
have to rely on donations to fulfill its mission. on the 
other hand, ToMS has the dual challenge of managing 
a global supply chain while at the same time leading 
a worldwide philanthropic effort. The complexity of 
this challenge will grow as ToMS continues to scale 
its business. no company has attempted to scale a 
one-to-one business model to the extent that ToMS 
is contemplating.
discussion Questions
 4-38. What is ToMS’s target market? How might this 
 market change in the future?
 4-39. What revenue streams does ToMS have that support 
how the firm competes? How sustainable are these 
revenue streams?
 4-40. What key assets does ToMS possess and how 
 sustainable are those assets?
 4-41. What are the major challenges ToMS faces as the 
firm continues implementing its business model as 
a means of reaching its mission? Which of these 
challenges is the most serious and why?

t was one of those moments in time when a business idea was born. Sam Franklin’s 
family received a wedding invitation in the mail, which was printed on card stock. 
Card stock is a type of paper that is thicker and more durable than normal writing 
paper. Because most wedding invitations are ultimately thrown away, 
that got Franklin thinking there might be a better way. At roughly the 
same time, Franklin read an article in USA Today about wedding invi-
tations. The article said that in the previous year, 1.2 million wedding 
invitations were sent out by the free online service Evite. While Evite 
is free, the invitations include ads, which to Franklin seemed a little 
unseemly. Franklin’s idea was to create a paid solution for sending 
wedding invitations online that didn’t include ads and would be a 
cleaner and a more elegant experience for everyone involved.
That was mid-2008. Franklin took a year off from school so he 
could build on his idea. He entered Washington University in St. Louis, 
Missouri, as a freshman in 2009. He followed through with the idea and 
launched Greenvelope, the name he chose for the company, literally 
from his dorm room. He invested $50,000 in start-up funds—half from 
a loan from a family member and half from savings he accumulated 
during high school—and created the back end of the company’s web-
site and 20 templates for wedding invitations. He also developed software that mimicked 
the experience of opening a traditional printed invitation. Greenvelope’s first customers 
were secured by buying Google AdWords for people who were searching for terms like 
“e-mail wedding invitations” or “e-mail save the date.” The company initially gave away 
e-mail “save the date” messages and made money by encouraging people to upgrade 
to paid invitations. An added benefit of Greenvelope’s offering was cost savings. At the 
time, it cost couples about $650 (on average) to print and mail invitations for a 100-guest 
wedding. Greenvelope offered template packages starting at $100 for up to 300 guests.
When Franklin started analyzing his initial sales data, he realized that engaged cou-
ples were only part of his customer base. To his surprise, businesses and individuals 
were customizing the wedding templates to send invitations for a variety of purposes, 
including corporate events. That realization prompted Franklin to widen his vision for 
Greenvelope, adding business templates to the company’s offerings as a result.
Midway through his degree program at Washington University, Franklin returned 
to Seattle, his hometown, to work on Greenvelope full time. The way the Greenvelope

site works is that a customer creates an account, selects an invitation, and then loads 
the e-mail invitation list into a spreadsheet. The invitations are then delivered via e-mail 
in a personalized spinning envelope (with the guest’s name on the front) that emulates 
the fun and excitement of opening a traditional paper invitation. The digital invitations 
look like real paper. An advanced RSvP tracking system allows customers to see which 
invites have been opened, which haven’t been opened, and which were undeliverable 
for whatever reason. When guests RSvP, they can select meal options, make song 
requests, write a note to the bride or groom, or respond to any question that the cus-
tomer sets up. If someone is on the invitation list that doesn’t have an e-mail address 
or never opens the electronic invitation, a paper version of the invitation can be printed 
from the Greenvelope site. The invitation can then be sent by regular mail.
Greenvelope currently has five full-time employees with part-time employees used 
as needed. An in-house design staff works with freelance designers and artists who 
create the invitation and are paid a commission when their designs are picked. Many of 
the designs are stylish and inviting and objectively rival handmade invitations. Currently, 
roughly 60 percent of Greenvelope’s sales are for wedding invitations, with the remaining 
40 percent being for graduation announcements, baby showers, birthdays, corporate 
events, and a variety of other purposes.
An integral part of Greenvelope’s offering is the opportunity to participate in environ-
mental sustainability. Sam Franklin grew up in Seattle, and spent his childhood camp-
ing, fishing, and hiking. Through those experiences, he gained a deep appreciation for 
the outdoors. Greenvelope donates 1 percent of its revenue each quarter to Mountains 
to Sound, a nonprofit organization that supports the greenway along the I-90 corridor 
in northwest Washington State. These donations were made even before the firm was 
earning profits. The fact that the company’s electronic invitations replace paper invita-
tions, which is an environmental plus, is also a key facet of how it operates.
Greenvelope’s main competitors include Paperless Post, a recently launched 
venture-capital-funded electronic invitation start-up, Evite, and old-fashioned snail mail. 
The company feels that it has sufficiently differentiated itself through its diverse collec-
tion of designs, its outstanding customer service, and its brand. An interesting facet of 
what Greenvelope does is the viral nature of its offering. Towards the bottom of each of 
its invitations is an unobtrusive statement that says “Powered by Greenvelope” with the 
Greenvelope logo. If recipients click on the logo, they are directed to the Greenvelope 
website. This is the manner in which Greenvelope obtains many of its new customers.
Greenvelope envisions a bright future. As time moves on, the company believes 
that people will become increasing comfortable performing the majority of their tasks 
online—which bodes well for its online electronic invitation service. Greenvelope also 
believes that sufficient barriers to entry have been put in place that will enable it to 
maintain a leadership position in the invitation industry. The strength of its brand, its 
network of freelance designers, its social mission, and the functionality of its website 
are all factors that place Greenvelope in an enviable position in the invitation industry.
G
reenvelope is a success in part because of Sam Franklin’s ability to ana-
lyze the invitation industry and precisely position Greenvelope within it. 
In this chapter, we’ll look at industry analysis and competitor analysis. 
The first section of the chapter considers industry analysis, which is business 
research that focuses on the potential of an industry. An industry is a group 
of firms producing a similar product or service, such as music, pilates and 
yoga studios, and solar panel manufacturing. Once it is determined that a new 

CHAPTER 5 | InDUSTRy AnD CoMPETIToR AnAlySiS    173
venture is feasible in regard to the industry and the target market in which it 
intends to compete, a more in-depth analysis is needed to learn the “ins and 
outs” of the chosen industry. The in-depth analysis helps a firm determine 
if the niche or target markets it identified during its feasibility analysis are 
 accessible and which ones represent the best point of entry for the new firm.
We focus on competitor analysis in the chapter’s second section. A competi-
tor analysis is a detailed evaluation of a firm’s competitors. Once a firm decides 
to enter an industry and chooses a market in which to compete, it must gain an 
understanding of its competitive environment. We’ll look at how a firm identifies 
its competition and the importance of completing a competitive analysis grid.
industry analysis
When studying an industry, an entrepreneur must answer three questions be-
fore pursuing the idea of starting a firm. First, is the industry accessible—in 
other words, is it a realistic place for a new venture to enter? Second, does the 
industry contain markets that are ripe for innovation or are underserved? Third, 
are there positions in the industry that will avoid some of the negative attributes 
of the industry as a whole? It is useful for a new venture to think about its posi-
tion at both the company level and the product or service level. At the company 
level, a firm’s position determines how the company is situated relative to its 
competitors, as discussed in Chapter 4. For example, Fresh Healthy Vending 
has positioned itself as a vending machine provider that specializes in healthy 
alternatives to traditional vending machine snack foods and beverages. The com-
pany’s refrigerated machines offer carrots, yogurt, smoothies, granola bars, and 
beverages such as milk, juice, and teas. This is a much different position than 
the vending machine providers that offer the standard fare such as chips, pret-
zels, salted peanuts, candy bars, sports drinks, and sodas.
The importance of knowing the competitive landscape, which is what an in-
dustry is, may have been first recognized in the fourth century bc by Sun Tzu, a 
Chinese philosopher. Reputedly he wrote The Art of War to help generals prepare 
for battle. However, the ideas in the book are still used today to help managers 
prepare their firms for the competitive wars of the marketplace. The following 
quote from Sun Tzu’s work points out the importance of industry analysis:
We are not fit to lead an army on the march unless we are familiar with the face of 
the country—its pitfalls and precipices, its marshes and swamps.1
These words serve as a reminder to entrepreneurs that regardless of how ea-
ger they are to start a business, they are not adequately prepared until they 
are “familiar with the face of the country”—that is, until they understand the 
industry or industries they plan to enter and in which they intend to compete.
It’s also important to know that some industries are simply more attrac-
tive than others in terms of their annual growth rate and other factors. For 
example, according to IBISWorld the industry for e-book publishing is expected 
to grow at an annual rate of 7.5 percent over the next five years. For the same 
period, the industry for traditional book publishing is expected to grow at an 
annual rate of 0.7 percent. What this means is that the conditions for grow-
ing a company are significantly more favorable in the e-book industry than in 
the traditional book publishing industry.2 These types of differences exist for 
comparisons across other types of industries. The differences can be mitigated 
some by firm-level factors, including a company’s products, culture, reputa-
tion, and other resources.3 Still, in various studies researchers have found that 
from 8 to 30 percent of the variation in firm profitability is directly attributable 
to the industry in which a firm competes.4 As a result, the overall attractive-
ness of an industry should be part of the equation when an entrepreneur 
learning Objective

industry analysis.

174    PART 2 | DEvELoPInG SUCCESSFUL BUSInESS IDEAS
decides whether to pursue a particular opportunity. Studying industry trends 
and using the five forces model are two techniques entrepreneurs have avail-
able for assessing industry attractiveness.
Studying industry trends
The first technique that an entrepreneur has available to discern the attractive-
ness of an industry is to study industry trends. Environmental and business 
trends are the two most important trends for entrepreneurs to evaluate.
Environmental Trends  As discussed in Chapter 2, environmental trends 
are very important. The strength of an industry often surges or wanes not so 
much because of the management skills of those leading firms in a particular 
industry, but because environmental trends shift in favor or against the prod-
ucts or services sold by firms in the industry.
Economic trends, social trends, technological advances, and political and 
regulatory changes are the most important environmental trends for entre-
preneurs to study. For example, companies in industries selling products to 
seniors, such as the eyeglasses industry and the hearing aid industry, benefit 
from the social trend of the aging of the population. In contrast, industries 
selling food products that are high in sugar, such as the candy industry and 
the sugared soft-drink industry, suffer as the result of a renewed emphasis on 
health and fitness. Sometimes there are multiple environmental changes at 
work that set the stage for an industry’s future. This point is illustrated in the 
following statement from IBISWorld’s assessment of the future of the motor-
cycle dealership and repair industry. After first reporting that motorcycle sales 
are anticipated to increase at an annualized rate of 2.3 percent between 2014 
and 2018 to reach a sales volume of $25.2 billion, the report goes on to say:
With more money in their pockets, consumers will head to motorcycle lots again; 
with favorable consumer sentiment about the future of the economy, consumers 
will resume purchasing industry products. Furthermore, the tight lending stan-
dards of the past are projected to dissipate and more financing will be available 
for consumers to use when purchasing a motorcycle. High fuel prices will also 
feed into industry demand as some consumers switch from cars to motorcycles.5
This short assessment about sales in the motorcycle industry illustrates the 
degree to which environmental trends affect an industry’s prospects. Note that 
nothing is said about improvements in the management of motorcycle dealer-
ships or innovation in the motorcycle industry. The somewhat positive assess-
ment of the motorcycle industry’s future is tied to an improved U.S. economy, a 
loosening of tight credit standards, and high fuel prices. High fuel prices work to 
the advantage of the motorcycle industry because motorcycles use less fuel than 
cars. Similar forces are at work in all industries.
Business Trends  Other trends affect industries that aren’t environmental 
trends per se but are important to mention. For example, the firms in some in-
dustries benefit from an increasing ability to outsource manufacturing or service 
functions to lower-cost foreign labor markets, while firms in other industries 
don’t share this advantage. In a similar fashion, the firms in some industries are 
able to move customer procurement and service functions online, at consider-
able cost savings, while the firms in other industries aren’t able to capture this 
advantage. Trends such as these favor some industries over others.
It’s important that start-ups stay on top of both environmental and business 
trends in their industries. One way to do this is via participation in industry trade 
associations, trade shows, and trade journals, as illustrated in the “Partnering 
for Success” feature.

CHAPTER 5 | InDUSTRy AnD CoMPETIToR AnAlySiS    175
Along with displaying their products and services, 
businesses attend trade shows to study their rivals, meet 
members of the press, and network with industry par-
ticipants. Companies must rent exhibit space at trade 
shows. Some of the high-quality shows, which usually 
last just under a week, cost upward of $20,000 to attend. 
Small companies are often able to share exhibit space 
and split the cost. Trade shows offer prime opportunities 
for networking in order to generate business and to estab-
lish new relationships and nurture existing ones. In fact, 
there are many articles and “how-to” guides published in 
periodicals and posted on websites that teach businesses 
how to maximize their time at trade shows and establish 
business relationships.
trade journals
Trade journals or magazines are usually published by trade 
associations and contain articles and advertising focused 
on a specific industry. very little general-audience adver-
tising appears in trade journals. They may also include 
industry-specific job notices and classified advertising.
Some trade journals are available to the general pub-
lic, while others are very specifically controlled—mean-
ing that you must be an industry participant to receive 
the journal. This practice ensures advertisers that their 
ads will be viewed by people in their target audience. 
Many of the articles in trade journals are written about 
companies in the industry. It enhances the stature and 
visibility of a company to have a favorable article written 
about it in a premier industry trade journal.
Along with trade journals, some industries have peer-
reviewed journals that contain both technical articles 
and heavy advertising content. The articles are often co-
authored by people who work for vendors that advertise 
in the journal. BioTechniques, which is concerend with the 
life sciences area, is an example of an industry-specific 
peer-reviewed journal that follows this format. These jour-
nals blur the distinction somewhat between trade journals 
and peer-reviewed journals.
Although trade journals do not provide the direct net-
working opportunities that trade associations and trade 
shows do, the visibility a company can obtain by being 
featured in an article or by running ads can result in mul-
tiple positive outcomes.
Questions for Critical Thinking
 1. Pick an industry in which you have an interest. Make a 
list of the premier trade associations, trade shows, and 
trade journals associated with that industry.
 2. How can an entrepreneur assess whether offering to 
serve in a leadership capacity in a trade association, 
O
ne thing that’s important for a start-up is to become 
active in the industry it’s entering. Activity leads to 
learning about and understanding the industry, find-
ing business partners, and becoming recognized as an 
industry leader. Three important Ts that lead to industry 
activity are trade associations, trade shows, and trade 
journals. Start-ups should consider utilizing these Ts as a 
part of their early and ongoing activities.
trade associations
A trade association (or trade group) is an organization 
that firms in the same industry form for the purpose of 
collecting and disseminating trade information, offering 
legal and technical advice, furnishing industry-related 
training, and providing a platform for collective lobby-
ing. In addition to promoting industry-related issues, 
trade associations typically provide a variety of other 
services to their members. For example, the American 
Watchmakers-Clockmakers Institute, which is a trade 
association of watchmakers and clockmakers, provides 
its members with training, a database of hard-to-find 
parts, technical support for watch and clock repair, bul-
letins with up-to-date product information, and an exten-
sive library of industry-specific educational material.6
Trade associations are typically governed by a paid 
staff and a volunteer board. Busy CEos and entrepreneurs 
are motivated to serve on trade association boards, not 
only to influence the direction of the associations but be-
cause their service provides them visibility and a platform 
to network closely with other members of the association. 
These types of interactions can lead to businesses forming 
partnerships and working together in other ways.
There are 7,600 national trade associations in the 
United States. The vast majority have websites that list 
their activities and their members.
trade shows
A trade show (or a trade fair) is an exhibition organized 
to create opportunities for companies in an industry to 
showcase and demonstrate their products and services. 
Some trade shows are open to the public, while others 
can only be attended by company representatives and 
members of the press. over 10,000 trade shows are 
held annually in the United States. There are several on-
line directories, such as the Trade Show news network 
(www.tsnn.com), that help organizers, attendees, and 
marketers identify the most appropriate trade shows to 
attend. The largest trade show in the United States is the 
International Consumer Electronics Trade Show, which is 
held every January in Las vegas, and is not open to the 
public. In 2014, it included more than 2,700 exhibitors, 
150,000 attendees, and 5,000 tech journalists.

Associations, Trade Shows, and Trade Journals

the Five Forces Model
The five forces model is a framework entrepreneurs use to understand an 
industry’s structure. Professor Michael Porter developed this important tool. 
Shown in Figure 5.1, the framework is comprised of the forces that determine 
industry profitability.7 These forces—the threat of substitutes, the threat of new 
entrants (that is, new competitors), rivalry among existing firms, the bargaining 
power of suppliers, and the bargaining power of buyers—determine the average 
rate of return for the firms competing in a particular industry (e.g., the restau-
rant industry) or a particular segment of an industry (e.g., the fast-casual seg-
ment of the restaurant industry).
Each of Porter’s five forces affects the average rate of return for the firms 
in an industry by applying pressure on industry profitability. Well-managed 
companies try to position their firms in a way that avoids or diminishes these 
forces—in an attempt to beat the average rate of return for the industry. For 
example, the rivalry among existing firms in the wedding invitation industry is 
high. Greenvelope has diminished the impact of this threat to its profitability 
by selling customized wedding invitations online. Compared to traditional wed-
ding invitation services, this approach lowers the cost to the consumer and 
provides a high profit margin per order for Greenvelope.
In his book Competitive Advantage, Porter points out that industry prof-
itability is not a function of only a product’s features. Although the book 
was published in 1980 and the dynamics of the industries mentioned have 
changed, Porter’s essential points still offer important insights for entrepre-
neurs such as the insight suggested by the following quote:
Industry profitability is not a function of what the product looks like or whether it 
embodies high or low technology but of industry structure. Some very mundane 
industries such as postage meters and grain trading are extremely profitable, while 
some more glamorous, high-technology industries such as personal computers 
and cable television are not profitable for many participants.8
The five competitive forces that determine industry profitability are described 
next. As mentioned in previous chapters, industry reports, produced by

specific industries. All three of these resources are available free through many 
university library websites and are highlighted in the Internet Resources Table 
in Appendix 3.2.
threat of Substitutes
In general, industries are more attractive when the threat of substitutes is low. 
This means that products or services from other industries can’t easily serve 
as substitutes for the products or services being made and sold in the focal 
firm’s industry. For example, there are few if any substitutes for prescription 
medicines, which is one of the reasons the pharmaceutical industry has his-
torically been so profitable. When people are sick, they typically don’t quibble 
with the pharmacist about the price of a medicine. In contrast, when close 
substitutes for a product do exist, industry profitability is suppressed because 
consumers will opt not to buy when the price is too high. Consider the price 
of airplane tickets. If the price gets too high, businesspeople will increasingly 
switch to videoconferencing services such as Skype and GoToMeeting as a 
substitute for travel. This problem is particularly acute if the substitutes are 
free or nearly free. For example, if the price of express mail gets too high, peo-
ple will increasingly attach documents to e-mail messages rather than sending 
them via UPS or FedEx.
The extent to which substitutes suppress the profitability of an industry 
depends on the propensity for buyers to substitute alternatives. This is why the 
firms in an industry often offer their customers amenities to reduce the likeli-
hood they’ll switch to a substitute product, even in light of a price increase. Let’s 
look at the coffee restaurant industry as an example of this. The coffee sold at 
Starbucks is relatively expensive. A consumer could easily find a less expensive 
cup of coffee at a convenience store or brew coffee at home rather than pay 
more at Starbucks. To decrease the likelihood that customers will choose ei-
ther of these alternatives, Starbucks offers high-quality fresh coffee, a pleasant 
atmosphere (often thought of as part of the “Starbucks experience”), and good 
service. Starbucks doesn’t do this just so its customers don’t go to a different 
This independently owned 
coffee shop doesn’t just 
sell coffee. It also offers 
its patrons a convenient 
and pleasant place to 
meet, socialize, and 
study. The shop offers 
these  amenities in part to 
decrease the likelihood 
that its customers will 
“substitute” coffee at this 
shop for a less  expensive 
alternative.

coffee restaurant. It offers the service so its customers won’t switch to sub-
stitute products as well. Although this strategy is still working for Starbucks, 
there have been times (such as during the recent economic slowdown) when 
its effectiveness was reduced. Because of this, Starbucks is now experimenting 
with offering less expensive coffees while maintaining its commitment to quality 
and providing customers with what the firm believes is the unique Starbucks 
experience.
threat of new entrants
In general, industries are more attractive when the threat of entry is low. This 
means that competitors cannot easily enter the industry and successfully copy 
what the industry incumbents are doing to generate profits. There are a num-
ber of ways that firms in an industry can keep the number of new entrants 
low. These techniques are referred to as barriers to entry. A barrier to entry 
is a condition that creates a disincentive for a new firm to enter an industry.9 
Let’s look at the six major sources of barriers to entry:
■ Economies of scale: Industries that are characterized by large economies 
of scale are difficult for new firms to enter, unless they are willing to accept 
a cost disadvantage. Economies of scale occur when mass-producing a 
product results in lower average costs. For example, Intel has huge micro-
processor factories that produce vast quantities of computer chips, thereby 
reducing the average cost of each chip produced. It would be difficult for a 
new entrant to match Intel’s advantage in this area. There are instances in 
which the competitive advantage generated by economies of scale can be 
overcome. For example, many microbreweries have successfully entered 
the beer industry by brewing their beer locally and relying on a local niche 
market clientele. By offering locally brewed, high-quality products, suc-
cessful microbreweries counter the enormous economies of scale (and the 
lower price to consumers they permit) of major and often global brewers, 
such as Anheuser-Busch InBev, which manages a portfolio of over 200 
beer brands.10
■ Product differentiation: Industries such as the soft-drink industry 
that are characterized by firms with strong brands are difficult to break 
into without spending heavily on advertising. For example, imagine how 
costly it would be to compete head-to-head against PepsiCo (owner of the 
Pepsi brands) or Coca-Cola Company. Product innovation is another way 
a firm can differentiate its good or service from competitors’ offerings. 
Apple is an example of a company that has differentiated itself in laptop 
computers by regularly improving the features on its line of MacBooks, 
such as the MacBook Air, as well as the unqiuness of the accessories 
customers can buy to enhance their experience as users. It does this to 
not only keep existing customers and win new ones, but also to deter 
competitors from making a big push to try to win market share from 
Apple in the laptop computer industry.
■ Capital requirements: The need to invest large amounts of money to 
gain entrance to an industry is another barrier to entry. The automobile 
industry is characterized by large capital requirements, although Tesla, 
which launched in 2003, was able to overcome this barrier and raise sub-
stantial funds by winning the confidence of investors through its expertise 
and  innovations in electric car technology. Current evidence suggests that 
this firm may have potential to achieve long-term success. In early 2014 
for  example, Tesla reported results for the fourth quarter of 2013 that 
 exceeded analysts’ expectations and projected that sales of its Model S 
electric sedan would increase by 55 percent in 2014 compared to 2013.11

CHAPTER 5 | InDUSTRy AnD CoMPETIToR AnAlySiS    179
■ Cost advantages independent of size: Entrenched competitors may 
have cost advantages not related to size that are not available to new 
 entrants. Commonly, these advantages are grounded in the firm’s history. 
For example, the existing competitors in an industry may have purchased 
land and equipment in the past when the cost was far less than new 
 entrants would have to pay for the same assets at the time of their entry.
■ Access to distribution channels: Distribution channels are often 
hard to crack. This is particularly true in crowded markets, such as 
the convenience store market. For a new sports drink to be placed on 
a convenience store shelf, it typically has to displace a product that is 
already there. If Greenvelope decided to start producing traditional wed-
ding invitations and greeting cards, it would find it difficult to gain shelf 
space in stationery stores where a large number of offerings from major 
producers are already available to consumers.
■ Government and legal barriers: In knowledge-intensive industries, 
such as biotechnology and software, patents, trademarks, and copyrights 
form major barriers to entry. Other industries, such as banking and 
broadcasting, require the granting of a license by a public authority.
When start-ups create their own industries or create new niche markets 
within existing industries, they must create barriers to entry of their own to 
reduce the threat of new entrants. It is difficult for start-ups to create barriers 
to entry that are expensive, such as economies of scale, because money is usu-
ally tight. The biggest threat to a new firm’s viability, particularly if it is creating 
a new market, is that larger, better-funded firms will step in and copy what it 
is doing. The ideal barrier to entry is a patent, trademark, or copyright, which 
prevents another firm from duplicating what the start-up is doing. Companies 
like Greenvelope typically have trade secrets associated with the functionality of 
their websites; in turn, trade secrets create a barrier to entry for a firm think-
ing about emulating the service provided by firms holding those secrets. The 
strength of Greenvelope’s brand and the network of freelance designers and 
artists that it has assembled to create its invitations are also aspects of its busi-
ness model that would be difficult to copy. Apart from these types of options, 
however, start-ups have to rely on nontraditional barriers to entry to discourage 
new entrants, such as assembling a world-class management team that would 
be difficult for another company to replicate. In Table 5.1, we provide a list of 
nontraditional barriers to entry that are particularly suited to start-up firms.
rivalry among existing Firms
In most industries, the major determinant of industry profitability is the level of 
competition among the firms already competing in the industry. Some indus-
tries are fiercely competitive to the point where prices are pushed below the level 
of costs. When this happens, industry-wide losses occur. In other industries, 
competition is much less intense and price competition is subdued. For exam-
ple, the airline industry is fiercly competitive and profit margins hinge largely on 
fuel prices and consumer demand. In contrast, the market for specialized medi-
cal equipment is less competitive, and profit margins are higher.
There are four primary factors that determine the nature and intensity of 
the rivalry among existing firms in an industry:
■ Number and balance of competitors: With a larger number of competi-
tors, it is more likely that one or more will try to gain customers by cutting 
prices. Price-cutting causes problems throughout the industry and occurs 
more often when all the competitors in an industry are about the same size 
and when there is no clear market leader.

180    PART 2 | DEvELoPInG SUCCESSFUL BUSInESS IDEAS
■ Degree of difference between products: The degree to which products 
differ from one producer to another affects industry rivalry. For example, 
commodity industries such as paper products producers tend to compete 
on price because there is no meaningful difference between one manufac-
turer’s products and another’s.
■ Growth rate of an industry: The competition among firms in a slow-
growth industry is stronger than among those in fast-growth industries. 
Slow-growth industry firms, such as insurance, must fight for market 
share, which may tempt them to lower prices or increase quality to obtain 
customers. In fast-growth industries, such as e-book publishing, there 
are enough customers to satisfy most firms’ production capacity, making 
price-cutting less likely.
■ Level of fixed costs: Firms that have high fixed costs must sell a higher 
volume of their product to reach the break-even point than firms with low 
fixed costs. Once the break-even point is met, each additional unit sold 
contributes directly to a firm’s bottom line. Firms with high fixed costs are 
anxious to fill their capacity, and this anxiety may lead to price-cutting.
Bargaining power of Suppliers
In general, industries are more attractive when the bargaining power of sup-
pliers is low. In some cases, suppliers can suppress the profitability of the 
industries to which they sell by raising prices or reducing the quality of the 
components they provide. If a supplier reduces the quality of the components it 
supplies, the quality of the finished product will suffer, and the manufacturer

will eventually have to lower its price. If the suppliers are powerful relative to 
the firms in the industry to which they sell, industry profitability can  suffer.12 
For example, Intel, with its Pentium chip, is a powerful supplier to the PC 
industry. Because most PCs feature Pentium chips, Intel can command a 
premium price from the PC manufacturers, thus directly affecting the overall 
profitability of the PC industry. Several factors have an impact on the ability of 
suppliers to exert pressure on buyers and suppress the profitability of the in-
dustries they serve. These include the following:
■ Supplier concentration: When there are only a few suppliers to provide 
a critical product to a large number of buyers, the supplier has an advan-
tage. This is the case in the pharmaceutical industry, where relatively few 
drug manufacturers are selling to thousands of doctors and their patients.
■ Switching costs: Switching costs are the fixed costs that buyers 
 encounter when switching or changing from one supplier to another. 
If switching costs are high, a buyer will be less likely to switch suppliers. 
For example, suppliers often provide their largest buyers with special-
ized software that makes it easy to buy their products. After the buyer 
spends time and effort learning the supplier’s ordering and inventory 
management systems, it will be less likely to want to spend time and 
 effort learning another supplier’s system.
■ Attractiveness of substitutes: Supplier power is enhanced if there are 
no attractive substitutes for the products or services the supplier offers. 
For example, there is little the computer industry can do when Microsoft 
and Intel raise their prices, as there are relatively few substitutes for these 
firms’ products (although this is less true today than has been the case 
historically).
■ Threat of forward integration: The power of a supplier is enhanced if 
there is a credible possibility that the supplier might enter the buyer’s 
 industry. For example, Microsoft’s power as a supplier of computer operat-
ing systems is enhanced by the threat that it might enter the PC industry 
if PC makers balk too much at the cost of its software or threaten to use 
an operating system from a different software provider.
Bargaining power of Buyers
In general, industries are more attractive when the bargaining power of buy-
ers (a start-up’s customers) is low. Buyers can suppress the profitability of 
the industries from which they purchase by demanding price concessions 
or increases in quality. For example, even in light of the problems it has en-
countered over the past several years, the automobile industry remains dom-
inated by a handful of large automakers that buy products from thousands 
of suppliers in different industries. This enables the automakers to suppress 
the profitability of the industries from which they buy by demanding price 
reductions. Similarly, if the automakers insisted that their suppliers pro-
vide better-quality parts for the same price, the profitability of the suppliers 
would suffer. Several factors affect buyers’ ability to exert pressure on sup-
pliers and suppress the profitability of the industries from which they buy. 
These include the following:
■ Buyer group concentration: If the buyers are concentrated, meaning 
that there are only a few large buyers, and they buy from a large number 
of suppliers, they can pressure the suppliers to lower costs and thus affect 
the profitability of the industries from which they buy.
■ Buyer’s costs: The greater the importance of an item is to a buyer, 
the more sensitive the buyer will be to the price it pays. For example, if the 

182    PART 2 | DEvELoPInG SUCCESSFUL BUSInESS IDEAS
component sold by the supplier represents 50 percent of the cost of the 
buyer’s product, the buyer will bargain hard to get the best price for that 
component.
■ Degree of standardization of supplier’s products: The degree to which 
a supplier’s product differs from its competitors’ offering affects the buy-
er’s bargaining power. For example, a buyer who is purchasing a standard 
or undifferentiated product from a supplier, such as the corn syrup that 
goes into a soft drink, can play one supplier against another until it gets 
the best combination of features such as price and service.
■ Threat of backward integration: The power of a buyer is enhanced if 
there is a credible threat that the buyer might enter the supplier’s indus-
try. For example, the PC industry can keep the price of computer monitors 
down by threatening to make its own monitors if the price gets too high.
the value of the Five Forces Model
Along with helping a firm understand the dynamics of the industry it plans to 
enter, the five forces model can be used in two ways: (1) to help a firm deter-
mine whether it should enter a particular industry and (2) whether it can carve 
out an attractive position in that industry. Let’s examine these two positive 
outcomes.
First, the five forces model can be used to assess the attractiveness of an 
industry or a specific position within an industry by determining the level of 
threat to industry profitability for each of the forces, as shown in Table 5.2. 
This analysis of industry attractiveness should be more in-depth than the less 
rigorous analysis conducted during feasibility analysis. For example, if a firm 
filled out the form shown in Table 5.2 and several of the threats to industry 
profitability were high, the firm may want to reconsider entering the industry 
or think carefully about the position it will occupy in the industry. In the res-
taurant industry, for example, the threat of substitute products, the threat of 
new entrants, and the rivalry among existing firms are high. For certain res-
taurants, such as fresh-seafood restaurants, the bargaining power of suppliers

may also be high (the number of seafood suppliers is relatively small compared 
to the number of beef and chicken suppliers). Thus, a firm that enters the 
restaurant industry has several forces working against it simply because of 
the nature of the industry. To help sidestep or diminish these threats, it must 
establish a favorable position. One firm that has accomplished this is Panera 
Bread, as discussed in Case 5.1 at the end of this chapter. By studying the 
restaurant industry, Panera found that some consumers have tired of fast food 
but don’t always have the time to eat at a sit-down restaurant. To fill the gap, 
Panera helped to pioneer a new category called “fast casual,” which combines 
relatively fast service with high-quality food. Panera has been very successful 
in occupying this unique position in the restaurant industry. You’ll learn more 
about Panera Bread’s success while reading Case 5.1.
The second way a new firm can apply the five forces model to help determine 
whether it should enter an industry is by using the model pictured in Figure 5.2 
to answer several key questions. By doing so, a new venture can assess the 
thresholds it may have to meet to be successful in a particular industry:
Question 1: Is the industry a realistic place for our new venture 
to enter? This question can be answered by looking at the overall 
 attractiveness of an industry, as depicted in Table 5.2, and by assessing 
whether the window of opportunity is open. It’s up to the entrepreneur to 
determine if the window of opportunity for the industry is open or closed.
Question 2: If we do enter the industry, can our firm do a better job 
than the industry as a whole in avoiding or diminishing the  impact 
of the forces that suppress industry profitability? Entering an 
 industry with a fresh brand, innovative ideas, and a world-class manage-
ment team and performing better than the industry incumbents increases 
the likelihood a new venture will be successful. This was the case when 
Google entered the Internet search engine industry and displaced Yahoo 
as the market leader. Outperforming industry incumbents can also be 
achieved if a new venture brings an attractive new product to market that 
is patented, preventing others from duplicating it for a period of time.
Question 3: Is there a unique position in the industry that avoids 
or diminishes the forces that suppress industry profitability? As 
we’ve described, this is the advantage that both Greenvelope and Panera 
Bread have captured.
Question 4: Is there a superior business model that can be put 
in place that would be hard for industry incumbents to dupli-
cate? Keep in mind that the five forces model provides a picture of an 
industry “as is,” which isn’t necessarily the way a new venture has to 
approach it. Sometimes the largest firms in an industry are trapped by 
their own strategies and contractual obligations, providing an opening 
for a start-up to try something new. For example, when Dell started sell-
ing computers directly to consumers, its largest rivals—Hewlett-Packard, 
Compaq, and IBM—were not able to respond quickly and effectively. They 
were locked into a strategy of selling through retailers. If they had tried to 
mimic Dell and sell directly to end users or customers, they would have 
alienated their most valuable partners—retailers such as Sears and Best 
Buy. However, with the passage of time, Dell’s competitors have learned 
how to effectively and efficiently sell directly to consumers, largely erasing 
Dell’s historic advantage in the process of doing so.
The steps involved in answering these questions are pictured in Figure 5.2. 
If the founders of a new firm believe that a particular industry is a realistic place 
for their new venture, a positive response to one or more of the questions posed 
in Figure 5.2 increases the likelihood that the new venture will be successful.

industry types and the Opportunities 
they Offer
Along with studying the factors discussed previously, it is helpful for a new ven-
ture to study industry types to determine the opportunities they offer.13 The five 
most prevalent industry types, depicted in Table 5.3, are emerging  industries, 
fragmented industries, mature industries, declining industries, and global in-
dustries.14 There are unique opportunities associated with each type of industry.

emerging industries
An emerging industry is a new industry in which standard operating proce-
dures have yet to be developed. The firm that pioneers or takes the leadership 
of an emerging industry often captures a first-mover advantage. A first-mover 
advantage is a sometimes insurmountable advantage gained by the first com-
pany to establish a significant position in a new market.
Because a high level of uncertainty characterizes emerging industries, any 
opportunity that is captured may be short-lived. Still, many new ventures enter 
emerging industries because barriers to entry are usually low and there is no 
established pattern of rivalry.
Fragmented industries
A fragmented industry is one that is characterized by a large number of firms 
of approximately equal size. The primary opportunity for start-ups in fragmented 
industries is to consolidate the industry and establish industry leadership as a 
result of doing so. The most common way to do this is through a geographic roll-
up strategy, in which one firm starts acquiring similar firms that are located in 
different geographic areas.15 This is an often observed path for growth for busi-
nesses such as auto repair shops and beauty salons. It is difficult for them to 
generate additional income in a single location, so they grow by expanding into 
new geographic areas via either organic growth or by acquiring similar firms.
mature industries
A mature industry is an industry that is experiencing slow or no increase 
in demand, has numerous repeat (rather than new) customers, and has lim-
ited product innovation. Occasionally, entrepreneurs introduce new product 

186    PART 2 | DEvELoPInG SUCCESSFUL BUSInESS IDEAS
innovations to mature industries, surprising incumbents who thought nothing 
new was possible in their industries. An example is Steve Demos, the founder 
of White Wave, a company that makes vegetarian food products. White Wave 
introduced a new product—Silk Soymilk—into a mature industry—consumer 
milk. Silk Soymilk became the best-selling soymilk in the country. Soymilk 
isn’t really milk at all—it’s a soybean-based beverage that looks like milk and 
has a similar texture. Still, it has made its way into the dairy section of most 
supermarkets in the United States and has positioned itself as a healthy sub-
stitute for milk. Who would have thought that a major innovation was possible 
in the milk industry?
The lure of mature industries, for start-ups, is that they’re often large 
industries with seemingly vast potential if product and/or process innova-
tions can be effectively introduced and the industry can be revitalized. This 
is the hope for a company such as Beyond Meat, the subject of the You Be 
the VC 5.1 feature. Beyond Meat is producing a plant-based substitute for 
chicken strips, called Chichen-Free Strips, that replicate the look, taste, 
and sensory experience of eating meat. The company is not targeting people 
who are ultra careful about what they eat, but a more mainstream market 
of people who are trying to eat healthier. Beyond Meat is now working on a 
similarly healthy substitute for ground beef. Meat is a mature industry. If 
Beyond Meat’s products can be effectively introduced into the marketplace 
and it is successful in revitilizing the meat industry, the firm’s market po-
tential is huge.
Declining industries
A declining industry is an industry or a part of an industry that is experienc-
ing a reduction in demand. The renting of DVDs and video games by mail and 
producing and distributing hard copy textbooks are examples of products as-
sociated with industries or segments of an industry that are in some state of 
decline. Typically, entrepreneurs shy away from declining industries because 
the firms in the industry do not meet the tests of an attractive opportunity as 
we described in Chapter 2. There are occasions, however, when a start-up will 
do just the opposite of what conventional wisdom would suggest and, by do-
ing so, stakes out a position in a declining industry that isn’t being hotly con-
tested. That is what Cirque du Soleil did in the circus industry.
Entrepreneurial firms employ three different strategies in declining indus-
tries. The first is to adopt a leadership strategy, in which the firm tries to 
become the dominant player in the industry. This is a rare strategy for a start-
up in a declining industry. The second is to pursue a niche strategy, which 
focuses on a narrow segment of the industry that might be encouraged to grow 
through product or process innovation. The third is a cost reduction strategy, 
which is accomplished through achieving lower costs than industry incumbents 
through process improvements. Achieving lower costs allows a firm to sell its 
product or service at a lower price, creating value for consumers in the process 
of doing so. Initially a small firm but now quite large as a result of its success, 
Nucor Steel revolutionized the steel industry through the introduction of the 
“minimill” concept, and is an example of an entrepreneurially minded firm that 
pursued this strategy. Historically, most steel mills in the United States used 
large blast furnaces to produce a wide line of products; however, the scale of 
these furnaces meant that firms had to produce and sell significant quantities 
of their products in order to be profitable. In contrast, Nucor’s then-innovative 
minimills were smaller and were used to produce a narrower range of products. 
Of great importance too is the fact that minimills are energy efficient and make 
high-quality steel.16 Nucor proved its concept and quickly found growth mar-
kets within the largely declining U.S. steel industry.

CHAPTER 5 | InDUSTRy AnD CoMPETIToR AnAlySiS    187
global industries
A global industry is an industry that is experiencing significant international 
sales. Many start-ups enter global industries and from day one try to appeal to 
international rather than just domestic markets. The two most common strat-
egies pursued by firms in global industries are the multidomestic strategy and 
the global strategy. Firms that pursue a multidomestic strategy compete for 
market share on a country-by-country basis and vary their product or service 
offerings to meet the demands of the local market. In contrast, firms pursu-
ing a global strategy use the same basic approach in all foreign markets. 
The choice between these two strategies depends on how similar consumers’ 
tastes are from market to market. For example, food companies typically are 
limited to a multidomestic strategy because food preferences vary significantly 
from country to country. Firms that sell more universal products, such as ath-
letic shoes, have been successful with global strategies. Entrepreneurial firms 
can use both strategies successfully. The key to achieving success is gaining 
a clear understanding of customers’ needs and interests in each market in 
which the firm intends to compete.17
competitor analysis
After a firm has gained an understanding of the industry and the target mar-
ket in which it plans to compete, the next step is to complete a competitor 
analysis. A competitor analysis is a detailed analysis of a firm’s competition. 
It helps a firm understand the positions of its major competitors and the op-
portunities that are available to obtain a competitive advantage in one or more 
areas. These are important issues, particularly for new ventures.18 In the 
words of Sun Tzu, quoted earlier in this chapter, “Time spent in reconnais-
sance is seldom wasted.”
First we’ll discuss how a firm identifies its major competitors. We’ll then 
look at the process of completing a competitive analysis grid, which is a tool for 
organizing the information a firm collects about its primary competitors.
identifying competitors
The first step in a competitive analysis is to determine who the competition is. 
This is more difficult than one might think. For example, take a company such 
as 1-800-FLOWERS. Primarily, the company sells flowers. But 1-800-FLOWERS 
is not only in the flower business; in fact, because flowers are often given for 
gifts, the company is also in the gift business. If the company sees itself in the 
gift business rather than just the flower business, it has a broader set of com-
petitors and opportunities to consider. In addition, some firms sell products or 
services that straddle more than one industry. For example, a company that 
makes computer software for dentists’ offices operates in both the computer 
software industry and the health care industry. Again, this type of company has 
more potential competitors but also more opportunities to consider.
The different types of competitors a business will face are shown in 
Figure 5.3. The challenges associated with each of these groups of competitors 
are described here:
■ Direct competitors: These are businesses that offer products or services 
that are identical or highly similar to those of the firm completing the 
 analysis. These competitors are the most important because they are going 
after the same customers as the new firm. A new firm faces winning over 
the loyal followers of its major competitors, which is difficult to do, even 
when the new firm has a better product.

 5. Explain the purpose of a 
competitor analysis and a 
competitive analysis grid.

188    PART 2 | DEvELoPInG SUCCESSFUL BUSInESS IDEAS
■ Indirect competitors: These competitors offer close substitutes to the 
product the firm completing the analysis sells. These firms’ products 
are also important in that they target the same basic need that is being 
met by the new firm’s product. For example, when people told Roberto 
Goizueta, the late CEO of Coca-Cola, that Coke’s market share was at a 
maximum, he countered by saying that Coke accounted for less than 2 
percent of the 64 ounces of fluid that the average person drinks each day. 
“The enemy is coffee, milk, tea [and] water,” he once said.19
■ Future competitors: These are companies that are not yet direct or indi-
rect competitors but could move into one of these roles at any time. Firms 
are always concerned about strong competitors moving into their mar-
kets. For example, think of how the world has changed substantially for 
Barnes & Noble and other brick-and-mortar bookstores since Amazon.com 
was founded. These changes are perhaps especially dramatic for Borders, 
which filed for bankruptcy in 2011. Former competitor Barnes & Noble 
bought Borders’s remaining assets (primarily its brand name) later in that 
year. But this story has yet to reach a conclusion, in that in February of 
2014, investment firm G Asset Management offered “to acquire a major-
ity interest in Barnes & Noble Inc.” If this transaction takes place, G Asset 
 intends to split Barnes & Noble’s retail and e-reader businesses into sepa-
rate operations.20 And, think of how smartphone technology continues to 
change the nature of competition for a variety of firms, including those 
selling entertainment services, telephone services, and the like.
It is impossible for a firm to identify all its direct and indirect competitors, 
let alone its future competitors. However, identifying its top 5 to 10 direct com-
petitors and its top 5 to 10 indirect and future competitors makes it easier for 
the firm to complete its competitive analysis grid.
If a firm does not have a direct competitor, it shouldn’t forget that the sta-
tus quo can be the toughest competitor of all. In general, people are resistant 
to change and can always keep their money rather than spend it.21 A product 
or service’s utility must rise above its cost, not only in monetary terms but also 
in terms of the hassles associated with switching or learning something new, 
to motivate someone to buy a new product or service.22
Creating meaningful value and sharp differentiation from competitors are 
actions small firms in crowded industries can take to remain competitive and 
gain market share. Three firms that have successfully accomplished this are 
profiled in the “Savvy Entrepreneurial Firm” feature.
Sources of competitive intelligence
To complete a meaningful competitive analysis grid, a firm must first under-
stand the strategies and behaviors of its competitors. The information that is 
gathered by a firm to learn about its competitors is called competitive intel-
ligence. Obtaining sound competitive intelligence is not always a simple task.

irms do well in a crowded industry when two con-
ditions exist: (1) they create meaningful value for 
customers at a fair price and (2) they effectively 
differentiate themselves from competitors. In fact, di-
minishing the impact of three of Porter’s five forces 
rests largely on these factors. A firm is able to with-
stand rivalry among existing firms and is able to deter 
substitutes and new entrants by creating value for its 
customers and offering something that people can’t get 
anywhere else.
The following are examples of three businesses that 
are creating unique value in their industries and have differ-
entiated themselves from their competitors. Each industry 
is very competitive, yet these companies are growing and 
thriving.
Hipmunk
Talk about a crowded industry, consider the options a 
consumer has for booking an airline flight. Choices in-
clude tavel agents, airline websites, and online travel sites 
like Travelocity or orbitz. never mind—Hipmunk, an online 
travel service, launched in 2010, offering travelers what 
they believe is an improved way to plan travel. Hipmunk’s 
premise is that existing travel sites provide too much in-
formation in a less-than-optimal format. It differentiates 
itself by tackling that problem and displaying results in a 
more appealing manner.
Here’s how it works. For airline travel you go to 
Hipmunk’s site and enter your departure airport, arrival lo-
cation, departure date, and return date just like any other 
travel site. Then things change. Instead of offering pages 
of results, Hipmunk displays its results on a single page.
The flights are color coded—each color represents a 
different airline. The flights are displayed as bars, and the 
length of the flight corresponds to the width of the bar. 
Flights can be sorted by price, time of day, and “agony,” 
which is a score based on the best combination of price, 
duration, and number of stops. The flights with the least 
amount of agony are shown first. Flights that are similar 
to the ones displayed, but are more expensive or have a 
higher agony score, are automatically removed from the 
results. Thus, the only results shown are the ones that 
make the most sense to purchase.
Hipmunk doesn’t release booking numbers, but it 
is reportedly gaining momemtum in the travel industry. 
A similar easy-to-use interface is available for booking 
hotel rooms. Hipmunk is aggressively moving into the 
mobile market, and its app is highly ranked in the Apple 
App Store.
element bars
Another tough industry is protien bars. Seriously, how 
many choices does a consumer have for buying protein 
bars at a store? In 2007 Element Bars launched with a 
new twist in the energy bar market. The company would 
differentiate itself by offering fresh, nutritious bars that 
could be sold online and “customized” by its customers.
Here’s how Element Bars was orginally set up, and 
how the company operates today. Customers log on 
to Element Bars’s website, and in five steps they can 
“build” their own energy bar. They are first asked to pick 
a basic texture, with options such as Chewy, Crispy, and 
Datey. They then add their choice of fruits, nuts, sweets, 
and boosts (such as whey protein or fiber) to create their 
customized bar. A nutrition label on the right portion of 
the screen changes as ingredients are added, so the cre-
ator can see how different ingredients affect the calories 
or the grams of saturated fat in the bar. After the bar is 
built, the final step is for the consumer to name the bar 
whatever he or she wants. once the order is placed, the 
bar is made and is shipped in just a few days.
Along with selling customizable energy bars via the 
Internet, Element Bars sells directly to speciality retail-
ers who want to create their own branded energy bars. 
Its difficlut for fitness centers, for example, to sell well-
known bars like Clif bars at a premium, when their mem-
bers can buy the same bars at Walmart or a similar type 
of outlet. By branding their own bar via Element Bars, a 
fitness center can sell the bars for a premium and cap-
ture higher margins.
benchprep
BenchPrep is competing in the hyper-competitive test 
prep industry. For standardized tests such as the SAT, 
GRE, GMAT, LSAT, and MCAT, there are many print 
test preparation guides, online courses, smartphone 
apps, and face-to-face short courses taught on col-
lege and university campuses to help students prepare 
for the tests. BenchPrep differentiates itself by selling 
cross-platform test prep courses. What this means is 
that not only can students access their courses on their 
computers and mobile devices, they can also sync their 
progresss so they can pick up right where they left off 
regardless of what device they’re using. As a result, a 
student could start a practice test on her/his laptop in 
the morning, answer a few questions during the day on 
an iPhone, and finish the test in the evening on a desk-
top computer.

If a competitor is a publicly traded firm, a description of the firm’s business 
and its financial information is available through annual reports filed with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These reports are public records 
and are available at the SEC’s website (www.sec.gov). If one or more of the 
competitors is a private company, the task is more difficult, given that private 
companies are not required to divulge information to the public. There are a 
number of ways that a firm can ethically obtain information about its competi-
tors. A sample of the most common techniques is shown in Table 5.4.

BenchPrep differentiates itself in additional ways. 
The company partners with the world’s top publishers, 
authors, and subject matter experts in preparing its 
courses. BenchPrep’s test preps give students progress 
reports to show where they are excelling and where 
performance needs to be improved. In addition, the test 
preps have social features, and allow students to study 
their progress and performance against other students 
preparing for the same test.

pursue, and, perhaps most importantly, identify its primary sources of com-
petitive advantage. To be a viable company, a new venture must have at least 
one clear competitive advantage over its major competitors.
An example of a competitive analysis grid is provided in Table 5.5. This grid 
is for Greenvelope, the online wedding invitation start-up featured at the begin-
ning of the chapter. The main competitive factors in the industry, which include 
online and traditional wedding invitation services, are cost, selection, customiz-
able, presentation to invitee, turnaround time, no ads, green, and social con-
sciousness/philanthropy. Some industry participants, such as Greenvelope, 
also engage in philanthropy. (As highlighted previously, Greenvelope gives 
1 percent of its revene each quarter to Moutains to Sound, a nonprofit or-
ganization that supports the greenway along the I-90 corridor of Northwest 
Washington State.) These factors are placed on the vertical axis of Greenvelope’s 
competitive analysis grid. The horizontal axis contains Greenvelope and its four 
main competitors. In each box, Greenvelope rates itself against its main com-
petitors. The purpose of this exercise is for a company to see how it stacks up 
against its competitors and to illustrate the areas in which it has an advantage 
(and has a disadvantage). For example, Greenvelope rates itself as superior to 
its competitors in terms of presentation to invitee and social consciousness/
philanthropy. It will likely use this information in its advertising and promo-
tions. An additional benefit of completing a competitive analysis grid is that it 
helps a company fine-tune its offering. For example, Greenvelope rates itself as 
“even” with its competitors on several criteria. It might use that knowledge to 
look for ways to up its game on one or more of these criteria to increase its over-
all competitiveness in relation to its competitors.
As this discussion shows, analyzing competitors is a complex and chal-
lenging process. But, the link between understanding competitors and how 
an entrepreneurial venture stacks up against them and the new firm’s suc-
cess in both the short and long term is clear and strong. In the “What Went 
Wrong?” feature, we describe the experiences of Digg. Once one of the hottest 
Internet sites, this firm competed in a rapidly emerging industry. While read-
ing about Digg, keep in mind the actions firms should take to understand 
their competitors and to form a competitive analysis grid. In an overall sense, 
might more effective work in terms of understanding its competitors and 
their actions increase the likelihood of Digg’s competitive success?

a
t one time, Digg was one of the hottest sites on 
the Internet. The site’s primary purpose was to 
allow users to discover, share, and recommend 
Web content. A user could submit an article or anything 
posted on the Internet for consideration. other users ei-
ther voted the article or page up (“dig”) or down (“bury”). 
Although the voting took place on digg.com, many web-
sites added “dig” buttons to their pages, allowing users 
to vote as they surfed the Web. The end product was a 
vibrant website with wide-ranging, constantly changing 
lists of popular and trending content from around the 
Internet.
Digg launched on December 4, 2004. At the height 
of its popularity, 2007-2008, it was attracting over 236 
million visitors annually. It had grown large enough that it 
affected the traffic experienced by other websites. If an 
article was submitted to Digg, and it made it to the front 
page of digg.com (by enough users “digging” it), the site 
the article was posted on would see a spike in traffic. 
This phenomenon was referred to as the “Digg effect.” 
In 2008, Digg was valued at more than $160 million. The 
sky seemed to be the limit for Digg, its users, and its in-
vestors. Incredibly, by July 2012, Digg was a shadow of 
its former self and was sold to Betaworks, a technology 
development company, for pennies on the dollar. What 
went wrong?
Several things went wrong with Digg, which caused 
the firm to lose its way and its place in the Internet so-
cial media industry. First, at the same time Digg was 
enjoying its height of popularity, Facebook and Twitter 
were gaining momentum. Eventually, Facebook and 
Twitter started eating away at Digg’s traffic, as they 
morphed into places where people discovered the most 
up-to-date news and Internet gossip, the main reason 
for coming to Digg. Rather than remaining true to its 
identity, Digg started emulating the best features of 
Facebook, Twitter, and other social media websites. 
To make matters worse, Digg started falling behind 
Facebook and Twitter in terms of functionality. It took 
several steps to post a link on Digg, whereas Facebook 
and Twitter were simpler.
A second thing that hampered Digg was a poorly 
executed relaunch. In early 2010 Digg announced that 
its site would undergo an extensive overhaul, to freshen 
it up and make it more user-friendly. Digg was losing 
traffic and was desperate to win some back. The com-
pany was experiencing a technical problem concerning 
the difficulty in scaling its MySQL database software, 
so it decided to switch over to another open-source 
system called Cassandra. Digg’s relaunch on August 
25, 2010, was tarnished by site-wide bugs and glitches. 
For weeks, the site frequently wasn’t available or was 
unstable at best, and when users finally reached the 
site, they complained about the new design and the 
removal of many features that they liked. Reflecting on 
this period in a 2012 Wall Street Journal article, Kevin 
Rose, Digg’s founder and CEo, characterized the 2010 
relaunch as botched and said that the company was 
slow to respond to criticism.
A third problem Digg encountered was that while it 
was supposedly “democratizing the Web” by allowing 
users to vote on the articles that would appear on its 
front page rather than editors selecting them, people 
claimed that it was easy to game Digg’s system. Anyone 
could submit an article, rally his friends, co-workers, and 
others to vote up the story, and see the story rise to the 
top of Digg’s rankings. once this practice became widely 
known, users originally attracted to Digg thinking they 
could submit an article and have it advance to Digg’s 
front page strictly on its merits became disillusioned and 
less interested in the site.
Questions for Critical Thinking
 1. What lessons does Digg’s failure have for entrepre-
neurs who are studying entering the social media 
industry?
 2. Would you characterize the “Rivalry Among Existing 
Firms” in the industry Digg competed in as high, 
 moderate, or low? To what degree was Digg able to 
effectively diminish or suppress the negative effects 
of the rivalry it experienced? What, if anything, should 
Digg have done differently in this area?
 3. If Digg had completed a competitive analysis grid 
shortly before it relaunched in 2010, what factors 
would you have placed on the vertical axis of the grid 
and what companies would you have compared Digg 
against? To what degree do you think Digg would have 
favorably compared to its competitors?
 4. What steps could Digg have taken, throughout the 
life of its business, that may have enabled it to remain 
competitive and still be a successful firm today?

Chapter Summary
there a unique position in the industry 
that avoids or diminishes the forces that 
suppress industry profitability? Is there a 
superior business model that can be put 
in place that would be hard for industry 
incumbents to duplicate?
 lO4. There are five primary industry types entre-
preneurial firms consider when choosing 
the industry in which they will compete. 
These industry types and the opportuni-
ties they offer are as follows: emerging in-
dustry/first-mover advantage; fragmented 
industry/consolidation; mature industry/
emphasis on service and process innova-
tion; declining industry/leadership, niche, 
harvest, and divest; and global industry/
multidomestic strategy or global strategy.
 lO5. A competitor analysis is a detailed analy-
sis of a firm’s competition. It helps a firm 
understand the positions of its major com-
petitors and the opportunities that are 
available to obtain a competitive advantage 
in one or more areas. Direct competitors, 
indirect competitors, and future competi-
tors are the three groups of competitors a 
new firm faces.
Successful competition demands that 
a firm understand its competitors and the 
actions they may take in the future. There 
are a number of ways a firm can ethically 
obtain the information it seeks to have 
about its competitors, including attending 
conferences and trade shows; purchasing 
competitors’ products; studying competi-
tors’ websites; setting up Google e-mail 
alerts; reading industry-related books, 
magazines, and websites; and talking to 
customers about what motivated them to 
buy your product as opposed to your com-
petitor’s product.
A competitive analysis grid is a tool 
for organizing the information a firm col-
lects about its competitors. This grid can 
help a firm see how it stacks up against 
its competitors, provide ideas for markets 
to pursue, and, perhaps most importantly, 
identify its primary sources of competitive 
advantage.
 lO1. To compete successfully, a firm needs 
to understand the industry in which it 
intends to compete. Industry analysis is 
a business research framework or tool 
that focuses on an industry’s potential. 
The knowledge gleaned from this analysis 
helps a firm decide whether to enter an 
industry and if it can carve out a position 
in that industry that will provide it a com-
petitive advantage. Environmental trends 
and business trends are the two main 
components of “industry trends” that 
firms should study. Environmental trends 
include economic trends, social trends, 
technological advances, and political and 
regulatory changes. Business trends in-
clude other business-related trends that 
aren’t environmental trends but are im-
portant to recognize and understand.
 lO2. Firms use the “five forces model” to under-
stand an industry’s structure. The parts 
of Porter’s five forces model are threat 
of substitutes, threat of new entrants, 
rivalry among existing firms, bargaining 
power of suppliers, and bargaining power 
of buyers.
 lO3. What entrepreneurs should understand 
is that each individual force has the po-
tential to affect the ability of any firm to 
generate profits while competing in the 
industry or a segment of an industry. The 
challenge is to find a position within an 
industry or a segment of an industry in 
which the probability of the firm being 
negatively affected by the five forces is 
reduced. Additionally, successfully exam-
ining an industry yields valuable informa-
tion to those starting a business. Armed 
with the information it has collected, firms 
are prepared to consider four industry-
related questions that should be exam-
ined before deciding to enter an industry. 
These questions are: Is the industry a 
realistic place for a new venture? If we 
do enter the industry, can our firm do a 
better job than the industry as a whole 
in avoiding or diminishing the threats 
that suppress industry profitability? Is

Business idea: Provide consumers with plant-based 
protein foods that take the animal out of meat—without 
sacrificing the taste, chew, or satisfaction.
pitch: A number of factors motivate people to seek out 
meat substitutes. Health benefits, animal welfare, lowering 
greenhouse gas emissions, and bad press about the 
poor conductions under which some animals raised for 
slaughter are kept are some of these factors. Many of 
the most common meat substitutes—tofu, bean burgers, 
vegetable cutlets, and so on—lack bite, chew, juiciness, 
and flavor. As a result, people try them for a while and then 
return to traditional meat products. A parallel problem 
exists regarding the demand for meat. Global demand for 
meat has tripled in the last 40 years, driven by population 
growth and an upward trend in per-capita consumption 
of meat. Producing meat has significant environmental 
implications. Animal agriculture is said to be responsible 
for about 14.5 percent of human-induced greenhouse 
gas emissions, more than the transportation sector. All 
of these factors suggest that there is a big opportunity 
for a company that can produce a tasty and affordable 
plant-based substitute for meat, and can do it in a way 
that is friendlier to the environment than traditional meat 
production.
Beyond Meat is positioning itself to be that company. on 
the taste and healthfulness side, the company’s first prod-
uct line, Chicken-Free Strips, are made with plant-based 
proteins that legitimately replicate the sensory experience 
of eating meat. The product is also gluten-free and is free 
of trans and saturated fat, cholesterol, dairy, eggs, hor-
mones, and antibiotics, so it’s better for you than actual 
chicken. on the cost and environmental side, Beyond 
Meat’s Chicken-Free Strips require less land and water 
to raise than real chickens and, when produced at a suf-
ficient scale, cost less to make.
Beyond Meat’s products are the result of more than 15 
years of research conducted by two scientists at the 
University of Missouri-Columbia, Fu-Hung Hsieh and 
Harold Huff. The company’s Chicken-Free Strips have 
been precisely engineered to look like chicken, taste like 
chicken, and especially to feel like chicken when you take 
a bite. The company is presently working on a Beyond 
Meat substitute for ground beef that can be worked 
into tacos, lasagna, or any other meal in which beef is 
included. Beyond Meat’s Chicken-Free Strips are being 
introduced to the marketplace through Whole Foods 
Markets and similar health-conscious food stores.

Business idea:  Coaches have long used video to 
evaluate their athletes’ performances to try to help 
make improvements. video equipment, however, is 
cumbersome, and the equipment varies in regard to its 
ability to replay videos in slow motion, whether a video 
can be shown side by side against another athlete, or 
whether the video can be easily e-mailed to someone 
else to solicit feedback and advice.
pitch:  Ubersense has created a smartphone and tablet 
app that makes each of the tasks referred to above 
seamless and easy, and adds additional functionality. 
The app allows athletes, coaches, and parents to shoot 
video of an athlete’s move or competition (e.g., golf 
swing, tennis stroke, 100 meter dash, basketball shot, 
high jump) and then analyze the video in a variety of 
ways. The video can be analyzed in slow motion or frame 
by frame. Drawing tools are included to allow coaches 
to analyze form and posture and share their analysis 
with their athletes. A timeline feature allows users to 
look through videos that have been shot over time to 
see where improvements have been made. A video 
can also be placed side by side against a professional 
athlete performing the same move or act, such as 
a golf swing or a gymnastics routine. Ubersesense’s 
most powerful feature is its innovative video-based 
feedback tool called Uberview. An Uberview, which 
can easily be shared with others, can contain a coach’s 
audio critique, instructive drawings, alterations to video 
playback, and even comparisons of the athlete that 
is the focus of the evaluation with other athletes. For 
example, a gymnastics coach could create an Uberview 
of a balance beam routine of an aspiring female gymnast 
and then compare the routine against a similar routine 
performed by an olympic gymnast.
There are additional functionalities that make Uberview 
useful. There is a note function that allows anyone to 
comment on a video, so an athlete can distribute a video 
to solicit written feedback. A video can be connected to

a big screen so a group of people can benefit from an 
evaluation or critique. Ubersense also includes a host 
of social features. videos can easily be shared with oth-
ers via e-mail and can be posted to Facebook, Twitter, 
youTube, or Dropbox. An athlete can also create a pro-
file, post videos of him or herself on the profile, and ask 
for feedback from the broader Ubersense community. In 
turn, an athlete can view videos posted by others and 
offer feedback, encouragement, and support.

company has several ways of making money, including 
selling drill videos and connecting athletes with coaches 
to get advanced help.

introduction
If you analyzed the restaurant industry using Porter’s 
five forces model, you wouldn’t be favorably impressed 
with the results. Three of the threats to profitability—the 
threat of substitutes, the threat of new entrants, and 
rivalry among existing firms—are high. Despite these 
threats to industry profitability, one restaurant chain is 
moving forward in a very positive direction. St. Louis–
based Panera Bread, a chain of specialty bakery-cafés, 
has grown from 602 company-owned and franchised 
units in 2003 to 1,770 in early 2014. In 2013, system-
wide sales reached $2.4 billion, up 12 percent from the 
previous year. These numbers reflect a strong perfor-
mance for a restaurant chain, particularly during a dif-
ficult economic period. So what’s Panera’s secret? How 
is it that this company flourishes while its industry as a 
whole is experiencing difficulty? As we’ll see, Panera 
Bread’s success can be explained in two words: posi-
tioning and execution.
changing consumer tastes
Panera’s roots go back to 1981, when it was founded 
under the name of Au Bon Pain Co. and consisted of 
three Au Bon Pain bakery-cafés and one cookie store. 
The company grew slowly until the mid-1990s, when 
it acquired Saint Louis Bread Company, a chain of 20 
bakery-cafés located in the St. Louis area. About that 
time, the owners of the newly combined companies 
observed that people were increasingly looking for prod-
ucts that were “special”—meaning that they differed 
from run-of-the-mill restaurant food. Second, they noted 
that although consumers were tiring of standard fast-
food fare, they didn’t want to give up the convenience of 
quick service. This trend led the company to conclude 
that consumers wanted the convenience of fast food 
combined with a higher-quality experience. In slightly 
different words, they wanted good food served quickly 
in an enjoyable environment.
the emergence of Fast casual
As a result of these changing consumer tastes, a new 
category in the restaurant industry, called “fast ca-
sual,” emerged. This category provided consumers the 
alternative they wanted by capturing the advantage 
of both the fast-food category (speed) and the casual 
dining category (good food), with no significant disad-
vantages. The owners of Au Bon Pain and Saint Louis 
Bread Company felt that they could help pioneer this 
new category, so they repositioned their restaurants 
and named them Panera Bread. The position that 
Panera moved into is depicted in the graphic titled 
“Positioning Strategy of various Restaurant Chains.” A 
market positioning grid provides a visual representation 
of the positions of various companies in an industry. 
About Panera’s category, industry expert T. J. Callahan 
said, “I don’t think fast casual is a fad; I think it’s a 
structural change starting to happen in the restaurant 
industry.”

(which is Latin for “time for bread”) added a bonus to 
the mix—specialty food. The company has become 
known as the nation’s bread expert and offers a variety 
of artisan and other specialty breads, along with ba-
gels, pastries, and baked goods. Panera Bread’s res-
taurants are open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and 
also offer hand-tossed salads, signature sandwiches, 
and hearty soups served in edible sourdough bread 
bowls, along with hot and cold coffee drinks and other 
beverages. The company also provides catering ser-
vices. Its restaurants present customers with an invit-
ing neighborly atmosphere and relaxing decor, adding 
to their appeal. Panera even suggests a new time of 
day to eat specialty foods, calling the time between 
lunch and dinner “chill-out” time.
With high hopes for future expansion, Panera 
Bread is an acknowledged leader in the fast-casual 
category. Its unique blend of fast-casual service and 
specialty foods also continues to gain momentum. 
This sentiment is captured in the following quote from 
Mark von Waaden, an investor and restaurateur who 
signed an agreement to open 20 Panera Bread restau-
rants in the Houston, Texas, area early in the compa-
ny’s recent growth spurt. Commenting on why he was 
attracted to Panera Bread as opposed to other restau-
rant chains, von Waaden said, “My wife, Monica, and I 
fell in love with the fresh-baked breads and the beauti-
ful bakery-cafés. We think the Panera Bread concept 
of outstanding bread coupled with a warm, inviting 
environment is a natural fit with the sophistication that 
the Houston market represents.”
The spirit of von Waaden’s statement captures the 
essence of Panera’s advantage. It isn’t just another res-
taurant. By observing trends and listening to customers, 
its leaders helped the firm carve out a unique and favor-
able position in a difficult industry.
present Status and goal for the Future
Panera’s leadership in the fast-casual category and its fi-
nancial performance have drawn considerable attention. 
The company employs more than 75,000 people, serves 
millions of customers a year, and is currently one of the 
largest restaurant chains in the United States. It also con-
tinues to innovate and evolve. In 2012, Panera Bread in-
troduced antibiotic-free roasted turkey, which both tastes 
better and appeals to health-conscious consumers. other 
recent introductions include it’s new Roasted Turkey & 
Avocado BLT sandwich, Chopped Chicken Cobb Salad 
with Avocado, and Roasted Turkey orchard Harvest 
Salad. Panera Bread is counting on its unique positioning 
strategy, its commitment to serving food that its custom-
ers feel good about eating and serving their families, and 
savvy execution to continue its positive momentum.

CHAPTER 5 | InDUSTRy AnD CoMPETIToR AnAlySiS    199
introduction
It started in business school. In the fall of 2008, neil 
Blumenthal and David Gilboa, both 28, were in the 
first year of their MBA program at the University of 
Pennsylvania’s Wharton School. They were in a com-
puter lab kicking around business ideas with classmates 
Andrew Hunt and Jeffrey Raider. The topic of eyeglasses 
came up. Gilboa had recently lost his glasses, and was 
shocked to learn that a replacement pair would cost $700. 
He recalled thinking that his iPhone cost $200. He thought 
how could an iPhone, that can do unimaginable things, 
cost $200 and a simple pair of glasses cost $700?
Blumenthal thought he had the answer. He had 
spent time working for visionSpring, a nonprofit that 
distributes eyewear to low-income people in develop-
ing countries. While at visionSpring, he learned that the 
global eyewear industry was dominated by a single com-
pany, Luxottica. Luxottica is the world’s largest eyewear 
company, and controls over 80 percent of the world’s 
major eyewear brands. It owns oakley, Persol, Ray-Ban, 
Sunglass Hut, LensCrafters, and Pearle vision. It also 
owns the eyewear stores located inside several major 
retail chains, including Sears optical and Target optical. 
Luxottica’s near-monopoly status was the reason for 
the $700 glasses. That was the “aha” moment. The four 
thought that if visionSpring could outfox Luxottica by 
manufacturing its own glasses for people in developing 
countries, why couldn’t four business students do the 
same thing for people just like themselves?
industry analysis
Before jumping ahead, Blumenthal and his three friends 
spent some time studying the eyewear industry. The term 
“eyewear” includes glasses, contacts, and sunglasses. 
They discovered four interesting characteristics about 
the industry. First, the industry had experienced very little 
innovation. Buying eyewear today isn’t much different 
than it was 20 years ago. Second, there were virtually no 
brands on the market that evoked passion or that people 
were excited to be associated with. Third, only 1 percent 
of eyeglasses were bought online. They figured this was 
because people like to try on glasses before they buy 
them. Finally, they learned that eyeglasses can do ter-
mendous good. The University of Michigan conducted a 
study to evaluate the impact of visionSpring’s efforts to 
provide eyeglasses to people who couldn’t afford them 
in “Base of the Pyramid” countries. The study found that 
a pair of visionSpring eyelgasses increased the monthly 
income of the user by 20 percent and overall productivity 
by 35 percent on average. These are staggeringly posi-
tive numbers for a social initiative.
Blumenthal and his classmates concluded that the 
eyewear industry, which is projected to reach a total of 
$95.5 billion in revenue by 2015, was ripe for disruption. 
What was needed was a company that (1) had the cour-
age to do an end-run around Luxottica by manufacturing 
its own glasses, (2) could lower the price by selling online, 
(3) knew how to create a brand that people could get 
passionate about, and (4) was willing to give away a pair 
of glasses to low-income people in the developing world 
for every pair the firm sold. As emerging entrepreneurs, 
they concluded that a company could earn money, in-
spire customers, and do good at the same time.
Warby parker
Warby Parker launched in 2010 as an online eyewear 
company, based on the criteria shown above. All four 
founders were involved at lauch, but soon afterward Hunt 
and Raider moved on. Hunt joined a venture capital firm 
and Raider founded a company called Harry’s, which 
is trying to disrupt the online razor business. The name 
Warby Parker comes from characters in Jack Kerouac 
books, Warby Pepper and Zagg Parker. Here’s how the 
company was set up.
Blumenthal and Gilboa secured Chinese manu-
facturers to produce frames and an Italian company to 
make lenses, allowing them to make the glasses and 
frames themselves. At the start, the glasses were sold 
strictly online, for $95 a pair. The $95 price point was 
possible because the glasses were designed in-house, 
manufactured overseas, and sold via the Web, eliminat-
ing many of the costs associated with traditional glasses 
manufacturing and retailing. Also, when traditional 
glasses bear a brand name, such as Coach or Polo 
Ralph Lauren, they include a licensing fee that can run 
as high as 15 percent. Warby Parker’s approach to sell-
ing glasses works like this. A customer submits his/her 
prescrption and begins browsing Warby Parker’s site. To 
ensure a proper fit, the customer can upload a photo of 
him or herself and “try on” frames through a virtual sys-
tem. The company’s Home-Try-on program allows the 
customer to pick five frames, which s/he then receives 
to try on at home for five days, free of charge. The $95 
includes the frame and the prescription lenses.

From the beginning the company set out to create 
a hip urban brand, targeting 18 to 34 year olds. They 
wanted to pick a market and evoke excitement and pas-
sion. The website had (and still has) a distinct, funky tone, 
with women who looked like grad students or magazine 
editors and men who appeared to be architects, artists, 
or jazz musicians. The company didn’t spend much on 
promotions, with one exception. Early on they hired a 
top fashion PR firm, Brandbury Lewis, to help them get 
press coverage. Soon they were featured in Vogue and 
GQ, which boosted Warby Parker’s visibility among its hip 
target market. The glasses themselves were part of the 
branding strategy. They had simple frames with slightly 
chunky temples that feature subdued colors: gray, blue, 
and burgundy. The glasses have preppy, country names 
like Sibley, Winston, Ellsworth, and Ames. As shown 
in the table below, the descriptions of Warby Parker’s 
glasses are purposefully playful.
attractive product but also supports a meaningful social 
cause. A portion of Warby Parker’s website is dedi-
cated to a section labeled “Do Good.” It has three parts 
labeled “Buy a Pair, Give a Pair,” “Good Company,” 
and “WP Stories.” The “WP Stories” section provides 
hearthwearming stories of how Warby Parker and the 
organizations the company partners with have changed 
the lives of people in devleoping countries.
the road ahead
Warby Parker envisions an exciting future. At the time 
this feature was written, in February 2014, the company’s 
website indicated that it had given away 500,000 pairs of 
glasses. Since the company gives away a pair of glasses 
for every one it sells, that means it has sold 500,000 pairs 
of glasses since 2010, which represents over $47.5 mil-
lion in sales. The company has evolved since its 2010 
beginnings. In the last two years, it has partnered with 
boutiques to open “stores within stores” in cities such 
as Los Angeles, nashville, and San Francisco. In 2013, 
Warby Parker opened its first store in new york City. The 
company acknowledgs that some people are  skittish 
about buying glasses online. The store is an experiment 
to see if a physical store will bring in new buyers. The 
store has the same quirky appeal as Warby Parker’s web-

Wilkie
There’s no reason to mess with a good 
thing. Wilkie is our version of a never-fail 
frame, with a sloped rectangular eyeframe 
that flatters any face.
Ames
With a bold brow line and generous 
width, Ames transitions easily from 
mornings in the quad to nights on the 
town.
Greeley
A sleek architectural frame with contrast 
temple arms, Greeley is an everyday 
frame with dress-up potential.
Roosevelt
A modern classic, Roosevelt is a large, 
masculine frame with a keyhole bridge 
that immediately inspires confidence.
Ellsworth
With its slender temples and narrow 
silhouette, Ellsworth is a bright, to-
anywhere frame that flatters all face 
shapes.
Warby Parker’s tone, product, and price resonated 
with its target market, young urban hipsters, almost 
immediately and the company experienced success. 
Although the company doesn’t release sales figures, it 
is estimated that it had sold more than 300,000 pairs of 
glasses by the end of 2012.
Social mission
An important component of what Warby Parker stands 
for is encompassed by its social mission. It gives away a 
pair of glasses for each pair it sells. While the company’s 
efforts appear to be heartfelt, it has also been good for 
business. According to a recent study, about 80 percent 
of Americans are likely to switch brands, if price and 
quality are the same, if a company supports a compelling 
social cause.
Companies that support social causes are also 
more naturally viral. People generally feel good about 
recommending a company that not only has an

n August of 2012 Josh Leider was on a run. He was listening to “Lose Yourself” by 
Eminem on his iPhone. The tempo of the song matched his running pace perfectly. 
Then “Lose Yourself” ended and another song started. The tempo was entirely dif-
ferent, throwing off Leider’s run as a result. He thought, “Why can’t 
you always run to the tempo of your music?” Hence, the idea of 
TempoRun, a smartphone app, was born.
Leider shared the idea with Benny Ebert-Zavos, a friend of his and 
a serious runner. Ebert-Zavos loved the idea, and the two of them de-
cided to pursue it further. The pair found that there were apps on the 
market that adjust song tempos as a runner’s pace changes, but none 
that did exactly what Leider and Ebert-Zavos envisioned, which was 
an app that categorized music according to tempo. Leider had worked 
on several business ideas and had a sense of how to proceed. He and 
Ebert-Zavos contacted the Computer Science department at Michigan 
State, the university they were attending, and a professor in the depart-
ment hooked them up with two students, Adam Proschek and Phil 
Gatzen, who were good at coding and development. The group of four 
decided to form a business and build the app, using the name TempoRun for both.
One thing the partners did from the outset is utilize the resources of Michigan State. 
Leider was a marketing and economics major in the Eli Broad College of Business, 
while Ebert-Zavos was a student in the School of Hospitality Business. Both Proschek 
and Gatzen were in Computer Science. They wrote a business plan for TempoRun and, 
in December of 2012, entered the first Broad Pitch Competition, which was held in the 
college of business. Instead of wearing business attire, they pitched in running clothes, 
in part to show their passion for their business idea. Incredibly, they won the competi-
tion. The win included a $5,000 first prize and access to The Hatch, a student business 
accelerator in partnership with MSU’s Entrepreneurship Network. The partners used the 
$5,000 and a grant from a campus businesses association to buy computers, trade-
mark their idea, and create a limited liability company (LLC). They also utilized pro bono 
resources available through MSU’s Entrepreneurship Network, such as interns who de-
signed a logo and worked on TempoRun’s marketing and legal efforts.
At the suggestion of a professor, in early 2013 they entered TempoRun in Student 
Startup Madness, a pitch competition for college digital projects at the South by 
Southwest Music and Media Conference in Austin, Texas. Michigan State funded the trip. 
They were competing against tech start-ups from universities across the country, includ-
ing Stanford and Harvard, and ended up winning. Leider characterized the competition,

and in particular the judging, as Shark Tank times 10. The judges were executives and 
well-known entrepreneurs from companies like Google, Square, and TechStars. Leider 
summed up the experience by saying that “We went into the competition thinking we 
knew everything but found that we knew very little.” This was actually a positive comment 
on Leider’s part. He was referring to the learning that took place as a result of the rigor 
of the judges’ questions and their feedback. The South by Southwest win also netted 
TempoRun $5,000 in Google Cloud Platform credit and acquainted the entrepreneurs with 
people they would have had no way of coming into contact with otherwise. The nearby 
photo was taken just after the win at the South by Southwest competition. The team, from 
left to right, included Phil Gatzen, Benny Ebert-Zavos, Adam Proschek, and Josh Leider.
To gain visibility and prepare for launch, the TempoRun team sponsored a charity 
5K at Michigan State in April of 2013. The proceeds went to support breast cancer 
research. The company formally launched in the Apple App Store in May 2013. The 
way the app works is that it helps users run at their preferred pace by categorizing the 
music on their iPhone from Level 1 (walking) to Level 10 (sprinting). It also incorporates 
music from a streaming Internet music station. The user selects a level, which can be 
changed with arrows on a simple interface. The app also keeps track of basic running 
analytics, such as distance run, pace, and calories burned. TempoRun, which charged 
a one-time download fee of $2.99 when it first launched, had 2,000 downloads its first 
day of launch. The company has experienced a steady pace of downloads since.
Looking back, Leider credits the time his team spent in The Hatch, the Michigan 
State student accelerator, and the business plan and pitch competitions in which they 
participated as pivotal to their success. Leider says that the value of a business plan 
or pitch competition is that it “gets your ideas down on paper and causes you to ask 
questions of yourself that you would have never thought of before—questions about 
your business, your revenue streams, and more.” Another ingredient to TempoRun’s 
success is that Leider and Elbert-Zavos are very involved in the running community. 
Because they are consumers of their own product, they are able to make tweaks to 
the product based on their own observations and listen to suggestions from runners 
whom they know and who are also TempoRun users.
TempoRun is not yet a full-time job for the four founders, but they hope this will 
soon be the case. They envision extending TempoRun’s basic approach to other 
sports, such as cycling and swimming.
t
his chapter discusses the importance of writing a business plan. Although 
some new ventures simply “wing it” and start doing business without 
the benefit of formal planning, it is hard to find an expert who doesn’t 
recommend preparing a business plan. A business plan is a written narra-
tive, typically 25 to 35 pages long, that describes what a new business intends 
to accomplish and how it intends to accomplish it. For most new ventures, 
the business plan is a dual-purpose document that is used both inside and 
outside the firm. Inside the firm, the plan helps the company develop a “road 
map” to follow to execute its strategies and plans. Outside the firm, it intro-
duces potential investors and other stakeholders to the business opportunity 
the firm is pursuing and how it plans to pursue it.1
To begin this chapter, we discuss issues with which entrepreneurs often 
grapple when facing the challenge of writing a business plan. Topics included 
in the chapter’s first section are reasons for writing a business plan, a descrip-
tion of who reads the business plan and what they’re looking for, and guidelines 
to follow when preparing a written business plan. In the chapter’s second sec-
tion, we present an outline of a business plan with a description of the material 

CHAPTER 6 | WRITING A BuSineSS PLAN    205
in each section of the plan. The third section of the chapter deals with strate-
gies for how to present the business plan to potential investors and others.
the business plan
As illustrated in the basic model of the entrepreneurial process shown in 
Chapter 1, writing a business plan is the last activity completed in the step 
of the entrepreneurial process titled “Developing Successful Business Ideas.” 
It is a mistake to write a business plan too early. The business plan must be 
substantive enough and have sufficient details about the merits of the new 
venture in order to convince the reader that the new business is exciting and 
should receive support. Much of this detail is accumulated in the feasibility 
analysis stage of investigating the merits of a potential new venture.
In spite of conventional wisdom suggesting the need to do so, a relatively large 
percentage of entrepreneurs do not write business plans for their new ventures. In 
fact, a 2010–2012 study of 350 entrepreneurs found that of those that had suc-
cessful exits (i.e., an IPO or sale to another firm), only about 30 percent started 
with a business plan.2 That number is similar to the results of a 2011 survey by 
The Hartford. According to The Hartford’s 2011 Small Business Success Study, 
which surveyed 2,000 business owners, only 35 percent of the owners said that 
they have a business plan.3 Similarly, in a 2002 study, Inc. magazine asked the 
founders of the firms that make up the Inc. 500 that year whether they had writ-
ten a formal business plan before they launched their companies. A total of 60 
percent did not.4 These statistics should not deter an entrepreneur from writing 
a business plan. Indeed, ample evidence supports the notion that writing a busi-
ness plan is an extremely good investment of an entrepreneur’s time and money.
reasons for writing a Business Plan
We show the two primary reasons to write a business plan in Figure 6.1. First, 
writing a business plan forces a firm’s founders to systematically think through 
each aspect of their new venture.5 This is not a trivial effort—it usually takes sev-
eral days or weeks to complete a well-developed business plan—and the founders 
will usually meet regularly to work on the plan during this period. An example 
of how much work is sometimes involved, and how a well-planned new business 
unfolds, is provided by Gwen Whiting and Lindsey Wieber, the co-founders of 
The Laundress, a company that sells specially formulated laundry detergents 
and other fabric care products. Whiting and Wieber met at Cornell University 
while studying fabrics, and after graduating the pair decided to start a business 
together. The following vignette comes from an interview they gave to Ladies Who 
Launch, a website that highlights the accomplishments of female entrepreneurs:
Gwen: Lindsey and I went to college and studied textiles at Cornell together and al-
ways wanted to be in business together. We knew it was going to happen. We always 
talked about ideas. We were talking about this concept, and it was the right time for 
us. The first thing we did was the business plan and then a cash flow analysis. We 
wanted to do as much research as possible before developing the products.

206    PART 2 | DEvELOPING SUCCESSfUL BUSINESS IDEAS
Lindsey: We spent Memorial Day weekend (2003) doing our business plan. We 
spent the Fourth of July weekend doing our cash flow. After we had our ideas 
on paper, we went back to Cornell, met with a professor there, and had a crash 
course in chemistry. She worked with us on the formulation of the products.
Gwen: I found a manufacturer on Columbus Day. Every piece of free time we had, 
we dedicated to the business. We weren’t at the beach with our friends anymore.6
The payoff for this level of dedication and hard work, which involved the 
preparation of a formal business plan, is that Whiting and Wieber have now 
had a successful business for 10-plus years. Their products are sold through 
their website and in many stores.
Consistent with Whiting and Wieber’s experience, writing a business plan 
forces a firm’s founders to intently study every aspect of their business, a 
process that’s hard to replicate in any other way. Imagine the following. Two 
friends are thinking about opening a seafood restaurant. They spend the next 
two months meeting four nights a week to hash out every detail of the busi-
ness. They study the restaurant industry, identify their target market, develop 
a marketing plan, settle on a hiring schedule, identify the type of people they 
want to employ, plan their facility, determine what their start-up expenses will 
be, and put together five years of pro forma (projected) financial statements. 
After 32 meetings and several drafts, they produce a 30-page business plan 
that explains every aspect of their business. Regardless of how conscientious 
the founders of a business are, it’s difficult to discipline oneself to cover this 
level of detail absent writing a business plan. As stated earlier, writing a busi-
ness plan forces a business’s founders to systematically think through every 
aspect of their business and develop a concrete blueprint to follow.
The second reason to write a business plan is to create a selling document 
for a company. It provides a mechanism for a young company to present itself to 
potential investors, suppliers, business partners, key job candidates, and oth-
ers. Imagine that you have enough money to invest in one new business.7 You 
chat informally with several entrepreneurs at a conference for start-ups and 
decide that there are two new ventures that you would like to know more about. 
This group of young 
 entrepreneurs plans to 
launch a website that 
features educational 
toys for children. Here, 
they are discussing how 
to integrate the results 
of their feasibility analy-
sis into their business 
plan. A business plan 
is more compelling if it 
 contains primary research 
 conducted by the entre-
preneurs launching the 
business.

CHAPTER 6 | WRITING A BuSineSS PLAN    207
You contact the first entrepreneur and ask for a copy of his business plan. The 
entrepreneur hesitates a bit and says that he hasn’t prepared a formal business 
plan but would love to get together with you to discuss his ideas. You contact 
the second entrepreneur and make the same request. This time, the entrepre-
neur says that she would be glad to forward you a copy of a 30-page business 
plan, along with a 10-slide PowerPoint presentation that provides an overview 
of the plan. An hour or two later, the PowerPoint presentation is in your e-mail 
in-box with a note that the business plan will arrive the next morning. You look 
through the slides, which are crisp and to the point and do an excellent job of 
outlining the strengths of the business opportunity. The next day, the business 
plan arrives just as promised and is equally impressive.
Which entrepreneur has convinced you to invest in his or her business? All 
other things being equal, the answer is obvious—the second entrepreneur. The 
fact that the second entrepreneur has a business plan not only provides you 
with detailed information about the venture but also suggests that the entre-
preneur has thought through each element of the business and is committed 
enough to the new venture to invest the time and energy necessary to prepare 
the plan. Having a business plan also gives an investor something to which s/
he can react. Very few, if any, investors will free up time to “listen” to your idea 
for a new business, at least initially.
Who reads the business plan—
and What are they looking for?
There are two primary audiences for a firm’s business plan. Let’s look at each 
of them.
a Firm’s employees
A clearly written business plan, one that articulates the vision and future 
plans of a firm, is important for both the management team and the rank-
and-file employees. Some experts argue that it’s a waste of time to write a 
business plan because the marketplace changes so rapidly that any plan will 
become quickly outdated. Although it’s true that marketplaces can and often 
do change rapidly, the process of writing the plan may be as valuable as the 
plan itself.
A clearly written business plan also helps a firm’s rank-and-file employees 
operate in sync and move forward in a consistent and purposeful manner. The 
existence of a business plan is particularly useful for the functional department 
heads of a young firm. For example, imagine that you are the newly hired vice 
president for management information systems for a rapidly growing start-up. 
The availability of a formal business plan that talks about all aspects of the 
business and the business’s future strategies and goals can help you make 
sure that what you’re doing is consistent with the overall plans and direction of 
the firm.
investors and other external stakeholders
External stakeholders who are being recruited to join a firm, such as inves-
tors, potential business partners, and key employees, are the second audience 
for a business plan. To appeal to this group, the business plan must be real-
istic and not reflective of overconfidence on the firm’s part. Overly optimistic 
statements or projections undermine a business plan’s credibility, so it is 
foolish to include them. At the same time, the plan must clearly demonstrate 
that the business idea is viable and offers potential investors financial returns

208    PART 2 | DEvELOPING SUCCESSfUL BUSINESS IDEAS
greater than lower-risk investment alternatives. The same is true for potential 
business partners, customers, and key recruits. Unless the new business can 
show that it has impressive potential, investors have little reason to become 
involved with it.
Investors vary in terms of the reliance they place on formal business 
plans.8 Initially, many investors ask for a PowerPoint deck or the executive 
summary of a business plan. A PowerPoint deck is a short set of PowerPoint 
slides that describe a business idea, and an executive summary is a one- to 
two-page overview of the full plan. If their interest is sufficiently peaked, in 
some cases investors will ask for a full business plan, and in other cases they 
won’t. It’s still necessary to have a business plan, however. If an investor com-
mits, in most cases a business plan will be required during the due diligence 
phase. Due diligence refers to the process investors go through after they ten-
tatively commit to an investment.9 The commitment is based on a thorough in-
vestigation of the merits of the venture, whether any legal complications exist, 
and whether the claims made in the business plan are accurate and realistic.
A firm must validate the feasibility of its business idea and have a good 
understanding of its competitive environment prior to presenting its busi-
ness plan to others. Sophisticated investors, potential business partners, and 
key recruits will base their assessment of a proposed firm’s future prospects 
on facts, not guesswork or platitudes, as emphasized in Chapter 3. The most 
compelling facts a company can provide in its business plan are the results of 
its own feasibility analysis and the articulation of a distinctive and competi-
tive business model. A business plan rings hollow if it is based strictly on an 
entrepreneur’s predictions of a business’s future prospects. Modify Watches, a 
retailer of customizable watches, is an example of a business that laid a firm 
foundation for its business plan via the feasibility analysis that it conducted 
very early on. Modify Watches is the focus of Case 3.1.
In addition to the previously mentioned attributes, a business plan should 
disclose all resource limitations that the business must address before it is 
ready to start earning revenues. For example, a firm may need to hire service 
people before it can honor the warranties for the products it sells. It is fool-
hardy for a new venture to try to downplay or hide its resource needs. One 
of the main reasons new ventures seek out investors is to obtain the capital 
needed to hire key personnel, further develop their products or services, lease 
office space, or fill some other gap in their operations. Investors understand 
this, and experienced investors are typically willing to help the firms they fund 
plug resource or competency gaps.
guidelines for Writing a business plan
There are several important guidelines that should influence the writing of a 
business plan. It is important to remember that a firm’s business plan is typi-
cally the first aspect of a proposed venture that an investor will see. If the plan 
is incomplete or looks sloppy, it is easy for an investor to infer that the venture 
itself is incomplete and sloppy.10 It is important to be sensitive to the struc-
ture, content, and style of a business plan before sending it to an investor or 
anyone else who may be involved with the new firm. Table 6.1 lists some of the 
“red flags” that are raised when certain aspects of a business plan are insuf-
ficient or miss the mark.
structure of the Business Plan
To make the best impression, a business plan should follow a conventional 
structure, such as the outline shown in the next section. Although some en-
trepreneurs want to demonstrate creativity in everything they do, departing

business plan.

CHAPTER 6 | WRITING A BuSineSS PLAN    209
from the basic structure of the conventional business plan format is usually a 
mistake. Typically, investors are very busy people and want a plan where they 
can easily find critical information. If an investor has to hunt for something be-
cause it is in an unusual place or just isn’t there, he or she might simply give 
up and move on to the next plan.11
Many software packages are available that employ an interactive, menu-
driven approach to assist in the writing of a business plan. Some of these pro-
grams are very helpful.12 However, entrepreneurs should avoid a boilerplate 
plan that looks as though it came from a “canned” source. The software pack-
age may be helpful in providing structure and saving time, but the information 
in the plan should still be tailored to the individual business. Some businesses 
hire consultants or outside advisers to write their business plans. Although 
there is nothing wrong with getting advice or making sure that a plan looks as 
professional as possible, a consultant or outside adviser shouldn’t be the pri-
mary author of the plan. Along with facts and figures, a business plan needs 
to project a sense of anticipation and excitement about the possibilities that 
surround a new venture—a task best accomplished by the creators of the busi-
ness themselves.13
content of the Business Plan
The business plan should give clear and concise information on all the impor-
tant aspects of the proposed new venture. It must be long enough to provide 
sufficient information, yet short enough to maintain reader interest. For most 
plans, 25 to 35 pages (and typically closer to 25 than 35 pages) are sufficient. 
Supporting information, such as the résumés of the founding entrepreneurs, 
can appear in an appendix.
After a business plan is completed, it should be reviewed for spelling, gram-
mar, and to make sure that no critical information has been omitted. There are 
numerous stories about business plans sent to investors that left out impor-
tant information, such as significant industry trends, how much money the 
company needed, or how the money was going to be used. One investor even 
told the authors of this book that he once received a business plan that didn’t

explanation
founders with none of their  
own money at risk
If the founders aren’t willing to put their own money at risk, why should anyone else?
A poorly cited plan
A plan should be built on hard evidence and sound research, not guesswork or what an 
 entrepreneur “thinks” will happen. The sources for all primary and secondary research 
should be cited.
Defining the market size 
too broadly
Defining the market for a new venture too broadly shows that the true target market has 
not been clearly identified. for example, saying that a new venture will target the global 
pharmaceutical industry isn’t helpful. The market opportunity needs to be better defined. 
Obviously, the new venture will target a segment or a specific market within the industry.
Overly aggressive financials
Many investors skip directly to this portion of the plan. Projections that are poorly 
 reasoned or unrealistically optimistic lose credibility. In contrast, sober, well-reasoned 
 statements backed by sound research and judgment gain credibility quickly.
Sloppiness in any area
It is never a good idea to make a reader wade through typos, balance sheets that don’t 
 balance, or sloppiness in any area. These types of mistakes are seen as inattention to  detail 
and hurt the entrepreneur’s credibility.

210    PART 2 | DEvELOPING SUCCESSfUL BUSINESS IDEAS
include any contact information for the entrepreneur. Apparently, the entre-
preneur was so focused on the content of the plan that he or she simply forgot 
to provide contact information on the business plan itself. This was a shame, 
because the investor was interested in learning more about the business idea.14
Style or Format of the business Plan  The plan’s appearance must be 
carefully thought out. It should look sharp but not give the impression that a lot 
of money was spent to produce it. Those who read business plans know that en-
trepreneurs have limited resources and expect them to act accordingly. A plastic 
spiral binder including a transparent cover sheet and a back sheet to support 
the plan is a good choice. When writing the plan, avoid getting carried away with 
the design elements included in word-processing programs, such as boldfaced 
type, italics, different font sizes and colors, clip art, and so forth. Overuse of 
these tools makes a business plan look amateurish rather than professional.15
One of the most common questions that the writers of business plans ask is, 
“How long and detailed should it be?” The answer to this question depends on 
the type of business plan that is being written. There are three types of business 
plans, each of which has a different rule of thumb regarding length and level of 
detail. Presented in Figure 6.2, the three types of business plans are as follows:
■ Summary plan: A summary business plan is 10 to 15 pages and works 
best for companies that are very early in their development and are not 
prepared to write a full plan. The authors may be asking for funding to 
conduct the analysis needed to write a full plan. Ironically, summary 
business plans are also used by very experienced entrepreneurs who may 
be thinking about a new venture but don’t want to take the time to write 
a full business plan. For example, if someone such as Drew Houston, the 
co-founder of Dropbox, was thinking about starting a new business, he 
might write a summary business plan and send it out to selected inves-
tors to get feedback on his idea. Most investors know about Houston’s 
success with Dropbox and don’t need detailed information. Dropbox, the 
subject of Case 2.1, is a free file hosting service that was founded in 2007 
and is now being used by more than 200 million people across the world.
■ Full business plan: A full business plan is typically 25 to 35 pages long. 
This type of plan spells out a company’s operations and plans in much 
more detail than a summary business plan, and it is the format that is 
usually used to prepare a business plan for an investor.
■ Operational business plan: Some established businesses will write an 
operational business plan, which is intended primarily for an internal 
audience. An operational business plan is a blueprint for a company’s op-
erations. Commonly running between 40 and 100 pages in length, these 
plans can obviously feature a great amount of detail that provides guid-
ance to operational managers.

CHAPTER 6 | WRITING A BuSineSS PLAN    211
If an investor asks you for a PowerPoint deck or the executive summary of 
your business plan rather than the complete plan, don’t be alarmed. This is a 
common occurrence. If the investor’s interest is piqued, he or she will ask for 
more information. Most investors believe the process of writing a full business 
plan is important, even if they don’t ask for one initially. This sentiment is af-
firmed by Brad Feld, a venture capitalist based in Boulder, Colorado, who wrote:
Writing a good business plan is hard. At one point it was an entry point for discus-
sion with most funding sources (angels and VCs). Today, while a formal business 
plan is less critical to get in the door, the exercise of writing a business plan is in-
credibly useful. As an entrepreneur, I was involved in writing numerous business 
plans. It’s almost always tedious, time consuming, and difficult but resulted in me 
having a much better understanding of the business I was trying to create.16
A cover letter should accompany a business plan sent to an investor or 
other stakeholders through the mail. The cover letter should briefly introduce 
the entrepreneur and clearly state why the business plan is being sent to the 
individual receiving it. As discussed in Chapter 10, if a new venture is looking 
for funding, a poor strategy is to obtain a list of investors and blindly send the 
plan to everyone on the list. Instead, each person who receives a copy of the plan 
should be carefully selected on the basis of being a viable investor candidate.
recognizing the elements of the Plan May Change  A final guide-
line for writing a business plan is to recognize that the plan will usually 
change as it is being written and as the business evolves. New insights invari-
ably emerge when entrepreneurs immerse themselves in writing the plan and 
start getting feedback from others. This process continues throughout the life 
of a company, and it behooves entrepreneurs to remain alert and open to new 
insights and ideas.
Because business plans usually change while being written, there is an 
emerging school of thought that opposes the idea of writing a business plan and 
advocates experimentation and trial-and-error learning gleaned through cus-
tomer feedback over formal planning.17 This approach, which is associated with 
the Lean Startup movement, espouses many excellent ideas, particularly in the 
area of soliciting feedback directly from prospective customers prior to settling 
on a business idea and business model to execute on the idea. In this book, we 
take the opposite position, arguing that a business plan, proceeded by a feasibil-
ity analysis, represents an important starting point for a new venture and serves 
many useful purposes. In this sense, those developing a business plan should 
understand that it is not intended to be a static document written in isolation 
at a desk. Instead, it is anticipated that the research conducted to complete the 
plan, and the preceding feasibility analysis, will place the founders in touch 
with potential customers, suppliers, business partners, and others, and that the 
feedback obtained from these key people will cause the plan to change as it’s be-
ing written.18 It’s also anticipated that the business itself will iterate and change 
after it’s launched, based on additional feedback. Some businesses will change 
more than others, based on the quality of their initial feasibility analysis and the 
newness and volatility of their industry. These issues and related ones are con-
sidered in the “Savvy Entrepreneurial Firm” feature.
Outline of the business plan
A suggested outline of the full business plan appears in Table 6.2. Specific plans 
may vary, depending on the nature of the business and the personalities of the 
founding entrepreneurs. Most business plans do not include all the elements 
introduced in Table 6.2; we include them here for the purpose of completeness.

Cover Page and Table of Contents  The cover page should include the 
company’s name, address, and phone number; the date; the contact informa-
tion for the lead entrepreneur; and the company’s website address if it has 
one. The company’s Facebook page and Twitter name can also be included. 
The contact information should include a land-based phone number, an e-mail 
address, and a smartphone number. This information should be centered at 
the top of the page. Because the cover letter and the business plan could get 
separated, it is wise to include contact information in both places. The bottom 
of the cover page should include information alerting the reader to the confi-
dential nature of the plan. If the company already has a distinctive trademark, 
it should be placed somewhere near the center of the page. A table of contents 
should follow the cover letter. It should list the sections and page numbers of 
the business plan and the appendices.

entire business plan; it provides a busy reader with everything she needs to

O
ne of the challenges business owners have is de-
termining how closely to stick to their business 
plan once the business is launched and they start 
receiving customer feedback. In almost all cases, some 
changes will need to be made to the firm’s plan. But the 
degree to which business plans pan out as their found-
ers envisioned varies. In some cases, a business plan is 
spot-on and the worst thing a founder could do is vary 
from the plan. In other cases, a plan needs to be sig-
nificantly tweaked, and in still other cases it needs to be 
thrown out the window and the business needs to start 
over. The following are brief descriptions of businesses 
that have experienced these various outcomes.
songkick—no Changes needed
Songkick was founded in 2007 by Pete Smith, Michelle 
You, and Ian Hogarth. The problem the company solves 
is music lovers missing out on seeing their favorite 
bands because they didn’t know they were in their area. 
Concertgoers try to avoid this problem by subscrib-
ing to venue e-mail lists, checking band websites, and 
surfing through generic concert newsletters. This is a 
clumsy process and doesn’t ensure that music fans 
won’t miss a concert they’d like to see. To solve this 
problem, Songkick indexes a large number of ticket 
vendors, venue websites, and local newspapers to cre-
ate the most comprehensive database of upcoming 
concerts available. Its mission is to know about every 
concert that’s happening in every location—from an in-
die band playing at a local nightclub to Beyoncé playing 
at Madison Square Garden. Users can track the perform-
ers they like, and Songkick will send them a personalized 
concert alert when those performers announce a tour 
date in their area. Songkick makes money by selling 
concert tickets on its website. While Songkick has en-
hanced its service offerings over the years, its business 
plan has remained unchanged. The site now has over 8 
million users per month.
grubHub—Minor Change needed
GrubHub began in 2004 as a simple resaurant listing 
website. The idea was to set up a website that listed all 
the restaurants that deliver to a particular user’s home 
or office address. The initial business plan was based 
on a “freemium” pricing model. GrubHub would list 
restaurants for free and make money by charging a sub-
scription fee for restaurants that wanted to be placed 
in a premium position on its website. The idea was that 
the restaurants placed in a premium position would get 
more orders from existing customers, and would have 
a better chance being “discovered” by new customers. 
As time went on, the founders of GrubHub realized that 
restaurants loved what they were doing, but weren’t 
comfortable with paying up front for sales that might or 
might not happen. Its customers were clear that they 
only wanted to pay GrubHub when a GrubHub user 
placed an order. These insights prompted GrubHub to 
revise its business plan. The company switched from 
a subscription pricing model, where they charged res-
taurants for a premium place, to a transactional model 
where they collected a commission for each order 
placed. After the change was made, GrubHub saw a 
dramatic increase in restaurants asking to be placed on 
its website.
instagram—Major Changes needed
Instagram almost wasn’t Instagram at all. Before Instagram 
became the photo-sharing hit that it is, co-founders Kevin 
Systrom and Mike Krieger were working on a check-in-
service called Burbn. Burbn was a location-based service 
similar to foursquare. Users could check in to locations, 
earn points for hanging out with their friends, and share 
pictures inside the app. Systrom and Krieger worked on 
Burbn for over a year. It was completely done, had gener-
ated buzz, and had $500,000 in funding. The only prob-
lem—Systrom and Krieger didn’t like it. To them it felt clut-
tered and overrun with features. They also worried about 
its competitiveness. Two similar services, foursquare and 
Gowalla, already existed. They would have to fight it out 
with foursquare and Gowalla for market share. So they 
stepped back and reconsidered. They concluded that the 
best approach was to pick a single feature and execute on 
it extremely well. So, they stripped Burbn down to the one 
group or feature they liked and felt they could contribute to 
the most. As it turned out, it was the photo-sharing, com-
ment, and like capabilities. What was left was Instagram. 
Instagram is now a widely popular online photo-sharing, 
video-sharing, and social networking service that allows its 
users to take pictures and videos, and apply digital filters 
to them. Instagram was acquired by facebook in 2012 for 
approximately $1 billion.
Questions for Critical Thinking
 1. Despite all the changes that have happened with the 
Internet since 2007, when Songkick was founded, why 
do you think the company has been able to success-
fully stick with its original business plan?
 2. What do you think would have happened to GrubHub if 
it hadn’t changed its business plan?

many instances an investor will first ask for a copy of a firm’s PowerPoint 
deck or executive summary and will request a copy of the full business plan 
only if the PowerPoint deck or executive summary is sufficiently convincing. 
Thus, certainly when requested, the executive summary arguably becomes 
the most important section of the business plan.20 The most critical point to 
remember when writing an executive summary is that it is not an introduc-
tion or preface to the business plan; instead, it is meant to be a summary of 
the plan itself.
An executive summary shouldn’t exceed two single-spaced pages. The 
cleanest format for an executive summary is to provide an overview of the 
business plan on a section-by-section basis. The topics should be presented 
in the same order as they are presented in the business plan. Two identical 
versions of the executive summary should be prepared—one that’s part of 
the business plan and one that’s a stand-alone document. The stand-alone 
document should be used to accommodate people who ask to see the executive 
summary before they decide whether they want to see the full plan.
Even though the executive summary appears at the beginning of the 
business plan, it should be written last. The plan itself will evolve as it’s writ-
ten, so not everything is known at the outset. In addition, if you write the 
executive summary first, you run the risk of trying to write a plan that fits 
the executive summary rather than thinking through each piece of the plan 
independently.21
industry analysis  The main body of the business plan begins by describ-
ing the industry in which the firm intends to compete. This description should 
include data and information about various characteristics of the industry, 
such as its size, growth rate, and sales projections. It is important to focus 
strictly on the business’s industry and not its industry and target market si-
multaneously. Before a business selects a target market, it should have a good 
grasp of its industry—including where its industry’s promising areas are and 
where its points of vulnerability are located.
Industry structure refers to how concentrated or fragmented an industry 
is.22 Fragmented industries are more receptive to new entrants than industries 
that are dominated by a handful of large firms. You should also provide your 
reader a feel for the nature of the participants in your industry. Issues such as 
whether the major participants in the industry are innovative or conservative 
and are quick or slow to react to environmental changes are the types of char-
acteristics to convey. You want your reader to visualize how your firm will fit 
in or see the gap that your firm will fill. The key success factors in an industry 
are also important to know and convey. Most industries have 6 to 10 key fac-
tors in which all participants must establish competence as a foundation for 
competing successfully against competitors. Most participants try to then dif-
ferentiate themselves by excelling in two or three areas.

Industry trends should be discussed, which include both environmental 
and business trends. The most important environmental trends are economic 
trends, social trends, technological advances, and political and regulatory 
changes. Business trends include issues such as whether profit margins in 
the industry are increasing or declining and whether input costs are going up 
or down. The industry analysis should conclude with a brief statement of your 
beliefs regarding the long-term prospects for the industry.
Company Description  This section begins with a general description of 
the company. Although at first glance this section may seem less critical than 
others, it is extremely important in that it demonstrates to your reader that 
you know how to translate an idea into a business.
The company history section should be brief, but should explain where the 
idea for the company came from and the driving force behind its inception. If 
the story of where the idea for the company came from is heartfelt, tell it. For 
example, the opening feature for Chapter 3 focuses on LuminAid, a solar light 
company that was started by Andrea Sreshta and Anna Stork, two Columbia 
University students. Sreshta and Stork’s motivation to design the light was 
spurred by their concern for people affected by a major earthquake that took 
place in Haiti in 2010. They experienced firsthand how a disaster can nega-
tively impact the lives of millions. One thing most disaster victims suffer from 
is a lack of light. Sreshta and Stork started LuminAid to solve this problem. 
The LuminAid solar light is unique in that it can be shipped flat, and inflates 
when used to produce a portable, renewable source of light. The company’s 
goal is to make the LuminAid light a part of the supplies commonly sent as 
part of disaster relief efforts.
Sreshta and Stork’s story is heartfelt and is one with which anyone can 
relate. It might even cause one to pause and think, “That is a fantastic idea. 
If you plan to start a 
 company in the nursery 
and garden industry, it’s 
important to document 
the health and future 
 potential of the  industry. 
A careful analysis of 
a firm’s  industry lays 
out what is realistically 
 possible and what isn’t 
realistically possible for a 
start-up to achieve.

That’s just the type of solution that people recovering from a natural disaster 
like an earthquake need.”
A mission statement defines why a company exists and what it aspires 
to become.23 If carefully written and used properly, a mission statement can 
define the path a company takes and act as its financial and moral compass. 
Some businesses also include a tagline in their business plan. A tagline is a 
phrase that a business plans to use to reinforce its position in the marketplace. 
For example, Wello’s tagline is “Bye, Bye Gym Hello Convenience.” Wello is an 
online platform that allows participants to arrange workouts with trainers via 
Skype or another online means, which avoids having to make a trip to a gym to 
receive the same service.
The products and services section should include an explanation of your 
product or service. Include a description of how your product or service is 
unique and how you plan to position it in the marketplace. A product or ser-
vice’s position is how it is situated relative to its rivals. If you plan to open a 
new type of smoothie shop, for example, you should explain how your smoothie 
shop differs from others and how it will be positioned in the market in terms of 
the products it offers and the clientele it attracts. This section is the ideal place 
for you to start reporting the results of your feasibility analysis. If the concept 
test, buying intentions survey, and library, Internet, and gumshoe research 
produced meaningful results, they should be reported here.
The current status section should reveal how far along your company is 
in its development. A good way to frame this discussion is to think in terms 
of milestones. A milestone is a noteworthy or significant event. If you have 
selected and registered your company’s name, completed a feasibility analy-
sis, developed a business model, and established a legal entity, you have al-
ready cleared several important milestones. The legal status and ownership 
section should indicate who owns the business and how the ownership is 
split up. You should also indicate what your current form of business own-
ership is (i.e., LLC, Subchapter S Corp., etc.) if that issue has been decided. 
We provide a full discussion of the different forms of business ownership in 
Chapter 7.
A final item a business should cover in this opening section is whether it 
has any key partnerships that are integral to the business. Many business 
plans rely on the establishment of partnerships to make them work. Examples 
of the types of partnerships that are common in business plans are shown in 
the “Partnering for Success” feature.
Market analysis  The market analysis is distinctly different from the indus-
try analysis. Whereas the industry analysis focuses on the industry in which 
a firm intends to compete (e.g., toy industry, fitness center industry, men’s 
clothing industry), the market analysis breaks the industry into segments 
and zeroes in on the specific segment (or target market) to which the firm will 
try to appeal. As mentioned in Chapter 3, most start-ups focus on servicing a 
specific target market within an industry.
The first task that’s generally tackled in a market analysis is to segment 
the industry the business will be entering and then identify the specific target 
market on which it will focus. This is done through market segmentation, 
which is the process of dividing the market into distinct segments. Markets 
can be segmented in many ways, such as by geography (city, state, country), 
demographic variables (age, gender, income), psychographic variables (per-
sonality, lifestyle, values), and so forth. Sometimes a firm segments its market 
based on more than one dimension in order to drill down to a specific segment 
that the firm thinks it is uniquely capable of serving. For example, in its mar-
ket analysis, GreatCall, the cell phone service provided especially for older peo-
ple, probably segmented the cell phone market by age and by benefits sought. 
Some start-ups create value by finding a new way to segment an industry.

distributor), which fulfills the order, often in an eBags box 
with an eBags packing list so it looks as though it came di-
rectly from eBags. This arrangement costs eBags money, 
but it is integral to eBags’s business plan of offering a wide 
selection of products to customers at affordable prices 
and not getting caught with outdated merchandise.
smaller Companies Outsourcing Human re-
sources Management tasks
An increasingly common feature in business plans is to 
outsource human resource management tasks that are 
labor intensive and require specialized expertise. Some 
start-ups outsource only administrative tasks, such as 
payroll processing and benefits administration. These 
firms partner with payroll accounting firms such as 
Paychex or TriNet. Other start-ups outsource a broader 
range of their human resource management functions 
and partner with a company such as ADP or Administaff. 
These companies are called professional employer orga-
nizations (PEOs) and act as an off-site human resource 
department for a start-up or other firm. Along with doing 
everything that Paychex and TriNet does, PEOs can help a 
start-up with hiring, firing, training, regulatory compliance, 
and other more in-depth human resource–related issues. 
Outsourcing these tasks can minimize a firm’s investment 
in human resources management personnel and support 
(such as software products) and frees a company to focus 
on other core activities.
Questions for Critical Thinking
 1. What factors in the business environment encourage 
firms to partner to compete?
 2. What risks do small firms face when partnering with 
large, successful companies? What risks do large com-
panies take when they partner with small start-ups?
 3. Describe two reasons (that aren’t mentioned in this 
feature) why a small firm would partner with another 
firm. Provide an example of a partnership that fits one 
of the reasons.
 4. The “You Be the vC 6.1” feature focuses on Buzzy, a 
company that has created a device that helps relieve 
the pain and axiety associated with getting a shot. 
What types of partnerships could Buzzy form to lower 
its capital requirements and allow its top management 
team to focus on its distinctive competencies?
B
ecause new businesses are resource constrained, 
they often make partnering an essential part of their 
business plans. As illustrated throughout this book, 
effective partnering can help a start-up in many ways. 
The following are examples of the types of partnering 
scenarios that are common in business plans.
smaller Companies partnering with larger 
Companies to bring their products to Market
Because the cost of bringing a new drug to market is so 
high, biotech companies commonly partner with large 
pharmaceutical companies to bring their products to 
market. Biotech companies specialize in discovering and 
developing new drugs—it’s what they’re good at. In most 
cases, however, they have neither the money nor the ex-
perience to bring the products to market. In contrast, the 
large drug companies, like Merck and Pfizer, specialize 
in marketing and selling drugs and in providing informa-
tion to doctors about them. It’s what they’re good at. As 
a result, most biotech firms’ business plans plainly state 
that their mission is to discover, develop, and patent new 
drugs and that they’ll partner with larger pharmaceutical 
companies to bring the products to market.
smaller Companies partnering with larger 
Companies to produce, Fulfill, and/or ship their 
products
Many new firms, from the get-go, structure their business 
plans on the notion that partners will produce, fulfill, and 
ship their products. As a result, a start-up that develops 
a new type of board game may have the game made by 
a contract manufacturer in China, have it shipped from 
China to a warehouse and fulfillment company in the 
United States, and when an order is placed (by a retailer 
such as Barnes & Noble or Walmart) the warehouse and 
fulfillment company ships the product to the buyer. While 
there are costs involved at every step in the process, this 
arrangement frees the board game company to focus on 
designing and marketing products and reduces its initial 
capital requirements. A variation of this approach, for cata-
log and Web-based companies that sell other manufac-
turers’ products, is a method called drop shipping. Drop 
shippers like eBags, which is an online retailer that sells 
luggage, backpacks, and similar items, do not warehouse 
anything they sell. Instead, when eBags receives an order 
it passes the order on to the original manufacturer (or 
partnEring For SuccESS
Types of Partnerships That Are Common in Business Plans
For example, before Tish Ciravolo started Daisy Rock Guitar, a company that 
makes guitars just for women, the guitar industry had not been segmented 
by gender. Daisy Rock Guitar’s competitive advantage is that it makes guitars 
that accommodate a woman’s smaller hands and build.
It’s important to include a section in the market analysis that deals di-
rectly with the behavior of the consumers in a firm’s target market. The more a 

218    PART 2 | DEvELOPING SUCCESSfUL BUSINESS IDEAS
start-up knows about the consumers in its target market, the more it can gear 
products or services to accommodate their needs. Many start-ups find it hard 
to sell products to public schools, for example, because purchase decisions 
are often made by committees (which draws out the decision-making process), 
and the funding often has to go through several levels of administrators before 
it can be approved. A competitor analysis, which is a detailed analysis of a 
firm’s competitors, should be included. We provided a thorough explanation of 
how to complete a competitor analysis in Chapter 5.
The final section of the market analysis estimates a firm’s annual sales and 
market share. There are four basic ways for a new firm to estimate its initial 
sales. If possible, more than one method should be used to complete this task. 
The most important outcome is to develop an estimate that is based on sound 
assumptions and seems both realistic and attainable. We show the four meth-
ods entrepreneurs can use to estimate sales in Table 6.3.
The economics of the business  This section begins the financial analy-
sis of a business, which is further fleshed out in the financial projections. It 
addresses the basic logic of how profits are earned in the business and how 
many units of a business’s product or service must be sold for the business to 
“break even” and then start earning a profit.
The major revenue drivers, which are the ways a business earns money, 
should be identified. If a business sells a single product and nothing else, it 
has one revenue driver. If it sells a product plus a service guarantee, it has two 
revenue drivers, and so on. The size of the overall gross margin for each rev-
enue driver should be determined. The gross margin for a revenue driver is the 
selling price minus the cost of goods sold or variable costs. The costs of goods 
sold are the materials and direct labor needed to produce the revenue driver. 
Table 6.3  the Four Methods for estimating a new Firm’s initial sales
method
explanation
Utilize the Multiplication 
Method
There are two approaches that fit this category. Start-ups that plan to sell a product on a 
national basis normally use a top-down approach. This involves trying to estimate the total 
number of users of the product, estimate the average price customers pay, and estimate what 
percentage of the market your business will garner. Start-ups that plan to sell locally normally 
use more of a bottom-up approach. This approach involves trying to determine how many 
 customers to expect and the average amount each customer will spend.
find a Comparable firm
find a comparable firm and ask for an estimate of annual sales. for example, if you are 
 planning to open a women’s clothing boutique, try to find a boutique that is similar to yours 
(and is not in your trade area) and simply call the owner and ask for a chance to talk to him or 
her about the business. Once a relationship has been established, you can ask for an estimate 
of the business’s annual sales.
Contact Industry Trade 
Associations
Contact the premier trade associations in your industry and ask if they track the sales numbers 
for businesses that are similar to your business. If the trade association doesn’t track actual 
sales numbers for comparable businesses, ask if there are other rules of thumb or metrics that 
help new companies estimate sales. for example, many industries collect statistics such as 
“average sales per square foot” or “average sales per employee” for firms in their industry.
Conduct Internet Searches
Internet searches often reveal magazine and newspaper articles as well as blog entries that 
focus on firms in your industry. On occasion, these articles and blog entries will talk about the 
sales experiences of a similar early-stage firm. If you know of a firm that is comparable to your 
firm, target that firm first in your search. You may get lucky and find an article or entry that says, 
“XYZ firm earned gross revenues of $250,000 per year its first three years.” If the source of this 
data is credible and XYZ firm is comparable to your firm, you’ve just found useful information.

CHAPTER 6 | WRITING A BuSineSS PLAN    219
So, if a product sells for $100 and the cost of goods sold is $40 (labor and 
materials), the gross margin is $60 or 60 percent. The $60 is also called the 
contribution margin. This is the amount per unit of sale that’s left over and 
is available to “contribute” to covering the business’s fixed costs and producing 
a profit. If your business has more than one revenue driver, you should figure 
the contribution margin for each. If you have multiple products in a given rev-
enue driver category, you can calculate the contribution margin for each prod-
uct and take an average. (For example, if you’re opening an office supply store, 
you may have several different computer printers under the revenue driver 
“printers.”) You can then calculate the weighted average contribution margin 
for each of the company’s revenue drivers by weighing the individual contribu-
tion margin of each revenue driver based on the percentage of sales expected 
to come from that revenue driver.
The next section should provide an analysis of the business’s fixed and vari-
able costs. The variable costs (or costs of goods sold) for each revenue driver 
was figured previously. Add a projection of the business’s fixed costs. A firm’s 
variable costs vary by sales, while its fixed costs are costs a company incurs 
whether it sells something or not. The company’s operating leverage should be 
discussed next. A firm’s operating leverage is an analysis of its fixed versus 
variable costs. Operating leverage is highest in companies that have a high 
proportion of fixed costs relative to their variable costs. In contrast, operating 
leverage is lowest in companies that have a low proportion of fixed costs rela-
tive to variable costs. The implications of the firm’s projected operating leverage 
should be discussed. For example, a firm with a high operating leverage takes 
longer to reach break-even; however, once break-even is reached, more of its 
revenues fall to the bottom line.
The business’s one-time start-up costs should be estimated and put in a 
table. These costs include legal expenses, fees for business licenses and per-
mits, website design, business logo design, and similar one-time expenses. 
Normal operating expenses should not be included.
This section should conclude with a break-even analysis, which is an 
analysis of how many units of its product a business must sell before it breaks 
even and starts earning a profit. In Chapter 8, we explain how to compute a 
break-even analysis.
Marketing Plan  The marketing plan focuses on how the business will 
market and sell its product or service. It deals with the nuts and bolts of 
marketing in terms of price, promotion, distribution, and sales. For example, 
GreatCall, a firm producing cell phones for older users, may have a great 
product, a well-defined target market, and a good understanding of its cus-
tomers and competitors, but it still has to find customers and persuade them 
to buy its product.
The best way to describe a company’s marketing plan is to start by ar-
ticulating its marketing strategy, positioning, and points of differentiation, 
and then talk about how these overall aspects of the plan will be supported by 
price, promotional mix and sales process, and distribution strategy. Obviously, 
it’s not possible to include a full-blown marketing plan in the four to five pages 
permitted in a business plan for the marketing section, but you should hit the 
high points as best as possible.
A firm’s marketing strategy refers to its overall approach for marketing 
its products and services. A firm’s overall approach typically boils down to how 
it positions itself in its market and how it differentiates itself from competi-
tors. GoldieBlox, the toy company introduced in Chapter 2, is positioning itself 
as a company that introduces girls to the field of engineering. Only about 10 
percent of engineering jobs in the United States are held by women. Beginning 
with the assumption that storytelling will increase a young girl’s connection 
with the act of building, the company has created a set of toys intended to be 

220    PART 2 | DEvELOPING SUCCESSfUL BUSINESS IDEAS
used to solve problems while reading about adventures. The ultimate goal is to 
connect girls with the art of building and encourage young women to pursue 
careers in engineering. As we see with the example of GoldieBlox, the market-
ing strategy sets the tone and provides guidance for how the company should 
reach its target market via its product, pricing, promotions, and distribution 
tactics. For example, it will invariably promote and advertise its products in 
places that young women and their parents are most likely to see. Similarly, it 
will most likely sell its products through specialty toy stores and its own web-
site, along with mass merchandisers such as Toys“R”Us.
The next section should deal with your company’s approach to product, 
price, promotion, and distribution. If your product has been adequately ex-
plained already, you can move directly to price. Price, promotion, and distribu-
tion should all be in sync with your positioning and points of differentiation, as 
described previously. Price is a particularly important issue because it deter-
mines how much money a company can make. It also sends an important mes-
sage to a firm’s target market. If GoldieBlox advertised its toys as high-quality 
toys that are both educationally sound and environmentally friendly but also 
charged a low price, people in its target market would be confused. They would 
think, “This doesn’t make sense. Are GoldieBlox toys high quality or aren’t 
they?” In addition, the lower price wouldn’t generate the profits that GoldieBlox 
needs to further develop its toys. You should also briefly discuss your plans re-
garding promotions and distribution.
The final section should describe the company’s sales process or cycle and 
specific sales tactics it will employ. It’s surprising how many business plans 
describe a business’s overall marketing strategies, but never comment on how 
a product or service will actually be sold.
Product (or Service) Design and Development Plan  If you’re devel-
oping a completely new product or service, you need to include a section in your 
business plan that focuses on the status of your development efforts. Many 
seemingly promising start-ups never get off the ground because their product 
development efforts stall or the actual development of the product or service 
turns out to be more difficult than expected.
The first issue to address is to describe the present stage of the develop-
ment of your product or service. Most products follow a logical path of devel-
opment that includes product conception, prototyping, initial production, and 
full production. You should describe specifically the point that your product or 
service is at and provide a timeline that describes the remaining steps. If you 
are in the very early stages of your business and only have an idea, you should 
carefully explain how a prototype, which is the first physical depiction of a new 
product or service, will be produced. A product prototype is the first physi-
cal manifestation of a new product, often in a crude or preliminary form. The 
idea is to solicit feedback and then iterate. For example, a prototype of a prod-
uct, like one of GoldieBlox’s toys, might consist of a preliminary version of the 
product for users to test and then report their experiences. GoldieBlox would 
then modify or tweak the toy based on the users’ experiences. Similarly, a pro-
totype for a Web-based company might consist of a preliminary or beta version 
of the site, with sufficient functionality built into the site for users to test it 
and then provide feedback. In some instances a virtual prototype is sufficient. 
A virtual prototype is a computer-generated 3D image of a product or service 
idea. It displays the idea as a 3D model that can be viewed from all sides and 
rotated 360 degrees.
A section labeled “Challenges and Risks” should be included and disclose 
any major anticipated design and development challenges and risks that will 
be involved in bringing the product or service to market. While you want to 
remain upbeat, the last thing you want to do is paint an overly rosy picture of 
how quickly and effortlessly your design and development process will unfold. 

CHAPTER 6 | WRITING A BuSineSS PLAN    221
Experienced readers know that product and service development is an inher-
ently bumpy and challenging process, and they will want insights into the 
challenges and risks you anticipate with your particular offering.
A final section should describe any patents, trademarks, copyrights, or 
trade secrets that you have secured or plan to secure relative to the prod-
ucts or services you are developing. If your start-up is still in the early stages 
and you have not taken action regarding intellectual property issues yet, you 
should get legal advice so you can, at a minimum, discuss your plans in these 
areas. Intellectual property is discussed in Chapter 12.
Operations Plan  The operations plan section of the business plan outlines 
how your business will be run and how your product or service will be pro-
duced. You have to strike a careful balance between adequately describing this 
topic and providing too much detail. Your readers will want an overall sense of 
how the business will be run, but they generally will not be looking for detailed 
explanations. As a result, it is best to keep this section short and crisp.
A useful way to illustrate how your business will be run is to first articulate 
your general approach to operations in terms of what’s most important and what 
the make-or-break issues are. You can then frame the discussion in terms of 
“back stage,” or behind-the-scenes activities, and “front stage,” or what the cus-
tomer sees and experiences. For example, if you’re opening a new fitness center, 
the back-stage and the front-stage issues might be broken down as follows:
Back stage (Behind-the-scenes activities)
Front stage (what the members see)
■ Staff selection
■ Operations manual
■ Relationships with suppliers
■ Relationships with city government
■ Development of marketing materials
■ Employee orientation and training
■ Emergency plans
■ Member tours
■ Operating hours
■ Staff assistance
■ fitness classes and programs
■ fitness machines
■ Workshops
■ Monthly newsletter
Obviously you can’t comment on each issue in the three to four pages you 
have for your operations plan, but you can lay out the key back-stage and 
front-stage activities and address the most critical ones.
The next section of the operations plan should describe the geographic 
location of your business. In some instances location is an extremely impor-
tant issue, and in other instances it isn’t. For example, one of the reasons 
Jeff Bezos decided to locate Amazon.com  in Seattle is that this city is a major 
distribution hub for several large book publishers. By locating near these dis-
tribution facilities, Amazon.com  has enjoyed a cost advantage that it wouldn’t 
have had otherwise. On a more fine-grained level, for restaurants and retail 
businesses, the specific location within a mall or shopping center, or a certain 
side of a busy street, may make a dramatic difference.
This section should also describe a firm’s facilities and equipment. You 
should list your most important facilities and equipment and briefly describe 
how they will be (or have been) acquired, in terms of whether they will be 
purchased, leased, or acquired through some other means. If you will be pro-
ducing a product and will contract or outsource your production, you should 
comment on how that will be accomplished. If your facilities are nondescript, 
such as a generic workspace for computer programmers, it isn’t necessary to 
provide a detailed explanation.

222    PART 2 | DEvELOPING SUCCESSfUL BUSINESS IDEAS
Management Team and Company Structure  Many investors and 
others who read business plans look first at the executive summary and then 
go directly to the management team section to assess the strength of the 
people starting the firm. Investors read more business plans with interesting 
ideas and exciting markets than they are able to finance. As a result, it’s of-
ten not the idea or market that wins funding among competing plans, but the 
perception that one management team is better prepared to execute its idea 
than the others.
The management team of a new firm typically consists of the founder 
or founders and a handful of key management personnel. A brief profile of 
each member of the management team should be provided, starting with the 
founder or founders of the firm. Each profile should include the following 
information:
■ Title of the position
■ Duties and responsibilities of the position
■ Previous industry and related experience
■ Previous successes
■ Educational background
Although they should be kept brief, the profiles should illustrate why 
each individual is qualified and will uniquely contribute to the firm’s success. 
Certain attributes of a management team should be highlighted if they apply 
in your case. For example, investors and others tend to prefer team members 
who’ve worked together before. The thinking here is that if people have worked 
together before and have decided to partner to start a new firm, it usually 
means that they get along personally and trust one another.24 You should also 
identify the gaps that exist in the management team and your plans and time-
table for filling them. The complete résumés of key management team person-
nel can be placed in an appendix to the business plan.
If a start-up has a board of directors and/or a board of advisors, their 
qualifications and the roles they play should be explained and they should be 
included as part of your management team. A board of directors is a panel of 
individuals elected by a corporation’s shareholders to oversee the management 
of the firm, as explained in more detail in Chapter 9. A board of advisors is a 
panel of experts asked by a firm’s management to provide counsel and advice 
on an ongoing basis. Unlike a board of directors, a board of advisors possesses 
no legal responsibility for the firm and gives nonbinding advice.25 Many start-
ups ask people who have specific skills or expertise to serve on their board of 
advisors to help plug competency gaps until the firm can afford to hire ad-
ditional personnel. For example, if a firm is started by two Web designers and 
doesn’t have anyone on staff with marketing expertise, the firm might place 
one or two people on its board of advisors with marketing expertise to provide 
guidance and advice.
The final portion of this section of your business plan focuses on how your 
company will be structured. Even if you are a start-up, you should outline how 
the company is currently structured and how it will be structured as it grows. 
It’s important that the internal structure of a company makes sense and that 
the lines of communication and accountability are clear. Including a descrip-
tion of your company’s structure also reassures the people who read the plan 
that you know how to translate your business idea into a functioning firm.
The most effective way to illustrate how a company will be structured and 
the lines of authority and accountability that will be in place is to include an 
 organizational chart in the plan. An organizational chart is a graphic represen-
tation of how authority and responsibility are distributed within the company. 
The organizational chart should be presented in graphical format if possible.

CHAPTER 6 | WRITING A BuSineSS PLAN    223
Overall Schedule  A schedule should be prepared that shows the major 
events required to launch the business. The schedule should be in the format 
of milestones critical to the business’s success, such as incorporating the ven-
ture, completion of prototypes, rental of facilities, obtaining critical financing, 
starting the production of operations, obtaining the first sale, and so forth. An 
effectively prepared and presented schedule can be extremely valuable in con-
vincing potential investors that the management team is aware of what needs 
to take place to launch the venture and has a plan in place to get there.
Financial Projections  The final section of a business plan presents a 
firm’s pro forma (or projected) financial projections. Having completed the pre-
vious sections of the plan, it’s easy to see why the financial projections come 
last. They take the plans you’ve developed and express them in financial terms.
The first thing to include is a sources and uses of funds statement, 
which is a document that lays out specifically how much money a firm needs 
(if the intention of the business plan is to raise money), where the money will 
come from, and how the money will be used. The next item to include is an 
assumptions sheet, which is an explanation of the most critical assumptions 
on which the financial statements are based. Some assumptions will be based 
on general information, and no specific sources will be cited to substantiate 
the assumption. For example, if you believe that the U.S. economy will gain 
strength over the next three to five years, and that’s an underlying assump-
tion driving your sales projections, then you should state that assumption. In 
this instance, you wouldn’t cite a specific source—you’re reflecting a consen-
sus view. (It’s then up to your reader to agree or disagree.) Other assumptions 
will be based on very specific information, and you should cite the source for 
your assumptions. For example, if GoldieBlox has credible data showing that 
the educational segment of the children’s toy industry is expected to grow at a 
certain percentage each year for the foreseeable future, and this figure plays 
a large role in its belief that it can increase its sales every year, then it should 
cite the sources of its information.
The importance of identifying the most critical assumptions that a business 
is based on and thoroughly vetting the assumptions is illustrated in the “What 
Went Wrong” feature. EventVue, the company that is the focus of the feature, 
failed largely because several of the key assumptions that business was based 
on turned out to be incorrect.
The pro forma (or projected) financial statements are the heart of the 
financial section of a business plan. Although at first glance preparing financial 
statements appears to be a tedious exercise, it’s a fairly straightforward process 
if the preceding sections of your plan are thorough. The financial statements 
also represent the finale of the entire plan. As a result, it’s interesting to see 
how they turn out.
A firm’s pro forma financial statements are similar to the historical state-
ments an established firm prepares, except they look forward rather than 
track the past. Pro forma financial statements include the pro forma income 
statement, the pro forma balance sheet, and the pro forma cash flow state-
ment. They are usually prepared in this order because information flows logi-
cally from one to the next. Most experts recommend three to five years of pro 
forma statements. If the company you’re writing your plan for already exists, 
you should also include three years of historical financial statements. Most 
business plan writers interpret or make sense of a firm’s historical or pro 
forma financial statements through ratio analysis. Ratios, such as return 
on assets and return on sales, are computed by taking numbers out of fi-
nancial statements and forming ratios with them. Each ratio has a particular 
meaning in regard to the potential of the business.
We present a complete explanation of how to complete pro forma financial 
statements and ratio analysis in Chapter 8.

224    PART 2 | DEvELOPING SUCCESSfUL BUSINESS IDEAS
e
ventvue was a product that was intended to im-
prove the experience of people who attend confer-
ences. It started as a private social network that 
helped conference attendees network more effectively. It 
pivoted twice, once to rollout a widget that would bring 
more people to specific conferences, and then to an 
app that promised to be the best way for conference at-
tendees to disscuss what was taking place in real time. 
Eventvue launched with promise but failed in early 2010. 
What went wrong?
Several things, all of which have to do with incorrect 
assumptions. The first assumption was that conference 
organizers would see Eventvue as an invaluable asset. 
They didn’t. While Eventvue saw itself as essential, con-
ference organizers saw it more as “a vitamin rather than 
a pain pill.” It was something that event organizers said 
they liked, but none of them saw it as essential. It didn’t 
make their lives easier, make them more money, reduce 
their costs, or boost the profile of an event. It was simply 
nice to have. Although Eventvue’s platform made it easier 
for conference attendees to network with one another, it 
wasn’t clear what was in it for the organizers, who were 
the ones being asked to pay for it. What the founders of 
Eventvue found was that conference organizers care first 
and foremost about one thing—selling tickets. Anthing 
that doesn’t sell tickets is a secondary consideration.
After disappointing initial results, Eventvue pivoted 
to offer a widget that would help bring more people to 
conferences. This, the company founders assumed, 
would get the attention of conference organizers. The 
widget would let people know who was registered for 
an event. The idea was that if a prospective attendee 
saw that a friend or someone they admired was reg-
istered for a conference, they would be more likely to 
register for the event conference as well. Incredibly, the 
widget had the opposite effect. A rule of thumb for con-
ferences is that the majority of sales come in the last 
two weeks before the conference is scheduled to take 
place. As a result, when people looked at the registra-
tion list—particularly if they looked at it more than two 
weeks out from the event—and saw that none of their 
friends or people that they admired were registered, 
they were less likely to register themselves. Therefore, 
rather than making conference organizers money, the 
Eventvue widget actually cost them money. Eventvue 
tried out several other ideas, but eventually ran out of 
ideas, persistence, and money.
There are two key takeaways from the Eventvue story 
for business plan writers. first, a business should test its 
assumptions prior to launching. This lesson illustrates 
the need to complete a comprehesive feasibility analysis 
prior to writing a business plan and moving forward with 
a business idea, as illustrated in Chapter 3. Second, 
it’s essential that a business understand its customers’ 
needs. Eventvue never found a way to help conference 
organizers sell more tickets. It found a way to help con-
ference attendees better network with others, but con-
ference attendees were not Eventvue’s customers.
Questions for Critical Thinking
 1. Briefly map out the feasibility analysis that Eventvue’s 
founders should have conducted prior to launching 
the company. Of the four forms of feasibility analysis 
described in Chapter 3, which of the forms should 
have been emphasized the most? Explain your 
answer.
 2. If Eventvue had conducted a comprehensive 
 feasibility analysis prior to launch, what do you think 
the company would have looked like?
 3. Do some Internet research to see if there are  companies 
that are providing social networks for  conference at-
tendees. If so, what are they doing differently than what 
Eventvue tried to do? Try to discern why they have been 
able to stay in business while Eventvue failed.
 4. The “You Be the vC 3.1” feature focuses on August 
Smart Locks, a company that will enable users to 
control the locks on their homes or apartments via a 
smartphone. What are some of the main assumptions 
that August’s business plan is based on?

appendix  Any material that does not easily fit into the body of a business 
plan should appear in an appendix—résumés of the top management team, 
photos or diagrams of product or product prototypes, certain financial data, 
and market research projections. The appendix should not be bulky and add 
significant length to the business plan. It should include only the additional 
information vital to the plan but not appropriate for the body of the plan itself.

venture have been answered. Table 6.4 lists the 10 most important questions a 
business plan should answer. It’s a good checklist for any business plan writer.
presenting the business plan to investors
If the business plan successfully elicits the interest of a potential investor, the 
next step is to meet with the investor and present the plan in person. The in-
vestor will typically want to meet with the firm’s founders. Because investors 
ultimately fund only a few ventures, the founders of a new firm should make as 
positive an impression on the investor as possible.
The first meeting with an investor is generally very short, about one hour.26 
The investor will typically ask the firm to make a 15- to 20-minute presenta-
tion using PowerPoint slides and use the rest of the time to ask questions. If 
the investor is impressed and wants to learn more about the venture, the pre-
senters will be asked back for a second meeting to meet with the investor and 
his or her partners. This meeting will typically last longer and will require a 
more thorough presentation.
the oral Presentation of a Business Plan
When asked to meet with an investor, the founders of a new venture should 
prepare a set of PowerPoint slides that will fill the time slot allowed for the 
presentation portion of the meeting. The same format applies to most business 
plan competitions. The first rule in making an oral presentation is to follow 
instructions. If an investor tells an entrepreneur that he or she has one hour 
and that the hour will consist of a 20-minute presentation and a 40-minute 
question-and-answer period, the presentation shouldn’t last more than 20 
minutes. The presentation should be smooth and well-rehearsed. The slides 
should be sharp and not cluttered with material.
The entrepreneur should arrive at the appointment on time and be 
well prepared. If any audiovisual equipment is needed, the entrepreneur 
should be prepared to supply the equipment if the investor doesn’t have it. 
These arrangements should be made prior to the meeting. The presenta-
tion should consist of plain talk and should avoid technical jargon. Start-up

Table 6.4  the 10 Most important Questions a business plan should answer
 1. Is the business just an idea, or is it an opportunity with real potential?
 2.  Is the product or service viable? Does it add significant value to the customer? Has a feasibility analysis been 
 completed? If so, what are the results?
 3.  Is the business entering an exciting, growing industry, and has the firm identified an attractive position within 
the industry?
 4.  Does the business have a well-defined target market?
 5.  Does the business have points of differentiation that truly separate it from its competitors? Are these points of 
 differentiation sustainable?

entrepreneurs may mistakenly spend too much time talking about the tech-
nology that will go into a new product or service and not enough time talking 
about the business itself. The most important issues to cover in the presen-
tation and how to present them are shown in Table 6.5. This presentation 
format calls for the use of 12 slides. A common mistake entrepreneurs make 
is to prepare too many slides and then try to rush through them during a 
20-minute presentation.

CHAPTER 6 | WRITING A BuSineSS PLAN    227
Chapter Summary
plan and is the usual format for a busi-
ness plan prepared for an investor. An 
operational business plan is usually pre-
pared for an internal audience. It is 40 to 
100 pages long and provides a blueprint 
for a company’s operations.
 lO3. Guidelines are available for those writing a 
business plan to follow. Adhering to these 
guidelines increases the probability that an 
entrepreneur will develop an effective busi-
ness plan. The structure of the plan is the 
first guideline to consider. The advice here 
is that a conventional structure should be 
used to develop a business plan. Doing 
this allows business investors to focus on 
the parts of a plan that are critical to their 
decision-making process. Second, a busi-
ness plan should be concise and clear in 
its development. All important aspects of 
the proposed venture should be included 
in the plan. Once written, the plan should 
be checked for grammar errors, spelling 
mistakes, and to verify that all vital infor-
mation is in fact included. The plan’s style 
and format are the issues around which 
the third guideline is framed. The plan’s 
appearance should be carefully evaluated; 
however, it should be consistent with a 
 lO1. A business plan is a written narrative that 
describes what a new business intends to 
accomplish and how it plans to achieve its 
goals. For most new businesses, the busi-
ness plan is a dual-purpose document that 
is used both inside and outside the firm. 
Inside the firm, it helps the company de-
velop a road map to follow in executing its 
strategies. Outside the firm, it acquaints 
potential investors and other stakeholders 
with the business opportunity the firm is 
pursuing and describes how the business 
will pursue that opportunity.
 lO2. The two primary audiences for a firm’s 
business plan are its employees and po-
tential investors and other external stake-
holders. There are different kinds of busi-
ness plans. For example, a summary 
business plan is 10 to 15 pages and works 
best for companies in the early stages of 
development. These companies don’t have 
the information needed for a full business 
plan but may put together a summary 
business plan to see if potential investors 
are interested in their idea. A full business 
plan, typically 25 to 35 pages, spells out a 
company’s operations and plans in much 
more detail than a summary business 
Questions and Feedback to expect from investors
Whether in the initial meeting or on subsequent occasions, an entrepreneur 
will be asked a host of questions by potential investors. The smart entre-
preneur has a solid idea of what to expect and is prepared for these queries. 
Because investors often come across as being very critical,27 it is easy for an 
entrepreneur to become discouraged, particularly if the investor seems to be 
poking holes in every aspect of the business plan. The same dynamic typifies 
the question-and-answer sessions that follow presentations in business plan 
competitions. In fact, an investor who is able to identify weaknesses in a busi-
ness plan or presentation does a favor for the entrepreneur. This is because 
the entrepreneur can take the investor’s feedback to heart and use it to im-
prove the business plan and/or the presentation.
In the first meeting, investors typically focus on whether a real opportunity 
exists and whether the management team has the experience and skills to 
pull off the venture. The investor will also try to sense whether the managers 
are highly confident in their own venture. The question-and-answer period is 
extremely important. Here investors are typically looking for how well entrepre-
neurs think on their feet and how knowledgeable they are about the business 
venture. Michael Rovner, a partner of Rob Adam’s at AV Labs, put it this way: 
“We ask a lot of peripheral questions. We might not want answers—we just 
want to evaluate the entrepreneur’s thought process.”28

plan is critical. Many investors and others 
who read business plans look first at the 
executive summary and then go directly 
to the management team section to assess 
the strength of the people starting the 
firm. The sources and uses of funds state-
ment is a document that lays out specifi-
cally how much money a firm needs (if it 
is raising money), where the money will 
come from, and what it will be used for. 
An assumptions sheet is an explanation of 
the most critical assumptions that a busi-
ness’s financial analysis is based on.
 lO5. After writing the business plan, the entre-
preneur must prepare to present it effec-
tively to potential investors and possibly 
others as well. The oral presentation of a 
business plan typically consists of 20 min-
utes of formal remarks, accompanied by 
approximately 12 PowerPoint slides, and 
40 minutes of questions and answers. The 
presentation should be smooth and well-
rehearsed. The slides should be sharp and 
not cluttered with material.
conventional structure (as noted earlier) 
and should not suggest to the potential in-
vestor that a great deal of money was spent 
to prepare the plan itself.
 lO4. A business plan has multiple parts, the 
first of which is the executive summary. 
The executive summary is a quick over-
view of the entire business plan and pro-
vides busy readers with everything they 
need to know about the distinctive nature 
of the new venture. In many instances, an 
investor will ask for a copy of a firm’s ex-
ecutive summary and will request a copy 
of the full business plan only when the 
executive summary is sufficiently convinc-
ing. The industry analysis, which is an-
other part of the business plan, describes 
the industry a business will enter. The 
market analysis part of the plan breaks 
the industry analysis into segments and 
zeros in on the specific segments (or tar-
get markets) to which the firm will seek 
to appeal. The management team and

CHAPTER 6 | WRITING A BuSineSS PLAN    231
Business idea: Create a device that helps relieve the 
pain and anxiety associated with getting a shot and other 
needle sticks like Iv starts, blood draws, and finger pricks.
Pitch: While no one looks forward to getting a shot or 
finger prick, some people are so afraid of the experience 
that they are literally needle phobic. Needle phobic people 
are so fearful of getting a shot that it keeps them from 
donating blood, getting immunizations like flu shots, and 
receiving regular health care. Buzzy founder Amy Baxter, 
an emergency room physician and pain researcher, found 
herself dealing firsthand with this situation. Her son had 
a really bad shot experience and became needle phobic. 
She knew right away that she had to do something so 
her son would no longer be afraid to go to the doctor and 
receive appropriate treatments.
After some research and experimentation, and aided by 
a $1 million grant from the National Institutes of Health 
(NIH), Dr. Baxter invented Buzzy, a bee-shaped, palm-
sized device. Buzzy operates on a pain management 
theory called gait control. Researchers have long sus-
pected that various kinds of sensory simulation could 
actually interrupt pain signals traveling up the spinal 
cord, before they reach the brain. After experimenting 
with different kinds of stimulations, Dr. Baxter settled 
on a combination of cold temperature with high-speed 
vibration. The cold and the vibration crowds out the pain 
caused by a shot by literally sending stronger motion 
and temperature sensations up the nerve pathways 
than are produced by the pain. It’s kind of like rubbing 
a cut under cold water or the dentist jiggling your check 
before giving you a shot. The vibrating bee attaches to 
thin ice packs that look like wings. The device is then 
placed between the injection site and the brain to block 
the pain from the injection. It also blocks the burning 
sensation that some medications cause after a shot is 
administered.
Buzzy’s efficacy has been verified by independent testing 
and research. Along with helping people who get an oc-
casional shot, Buzzy is particularly beneficial for people 
who must receive regular shots as the result of a chronic 
condition. Buzzy is sold to doctors’ offices, hospitals, and 
clinics. A fully fDA-compliant version is also available 
for home use and is priced at $39.95. The home version 
can be used by people who inject themselves as part of 
a physician-supervised home health care regime, or can 
be taken to the doctor’s office when the need for a shot is 
anticipated. The Buzzy device is reusable.

Business idea: Create a pop-up, disposable trash bin 
that makes the process of recycling and collecting trash, 
particularly at parties and events that are held away from 
everyday garbage and recycling receptacles, simpler, 
cleaner, and more fun.
Pitch: Most people want to do what is “right” when it 
comes to handling trash and recycling, but obstacles 
get in their way. Trash bags are often flimsy and hard 
to deal with. Recycling containers can quickly get 
dirty and unsightly. And handling trash and recycling 
can be difficult at parties and events that are held 
away from a person’s home or business. These types 
of complications cause many people angst. Imagine 
throwing a party at a park, a beach, or a facility that 
you’re not familiar with. It’s easy for soda cans and beer 
bottles to pile up and for garbage cans to overflow. Even 
if you’re throwing a party in your own home, household 
garbage cans and recycling containers are often too 
small to handle the job.
flings Bins were created to address these problems. 
flings is a freestanding pop-up container and trash bag 
in one. You can set up several flings containers around 
the house and not have to worry about taking out trash 
in the middle of the party. They are portable and can be 
brought outdoors to picnics, campsites, and tailgating 
parties where there is no trash can nearby. They are dis-
posable and 100 percent biodegradable, but are sturdy 
enough to be emptied and used again if the trash inside 
wasn’t particularly messy. They also dress up a party 
or event rather than create an eyesore, as is the case 
with most trash containers. They are available in many 
different colors and patterns, such as patriotic colors 
for a fourth of July party, red and white gingham for 
a barbeque, or confetti and balloons for a New Year’s

Eve party. While people don’t normally think of impress-
ing their guests with their trash or garbage containers, 
flings Bins are quite stylish. flings Bins are also avail-
able that are completely covered in the recycle symbol 
and are labeled “Please Recycle Here.” There are boxes 
that can be checked with a marker or sharpie that say 
“cans,” “plastics,” “glass,” and so on, so a host can opt 
to set up recycling bins for different purposes.
flings containers come flat and pop up for use. As a result, 
they are easy to transport and store. As the company says, 
“Pop It! fill It! Toss It! Or Recycle and Reuse!” Each bin has 
a 13-gallon capacity (which holds about 60 cans or bottles), 
and a drawstring that makes them easy to close and carry.

introduction
Katie Beauchamp and Hayley Barna met on their first 
day at Harvard Business School. They volunteered to 
co-coordinate a spring holiday for themselves and 50 of 
their classmates. Through the experience they realized 
that they worked well together as a team, but at that 
time, they had no thought of co-founding a business. 
That all changed just over a year later, when Beauchamp 
and Barna launched Birchbox, a beauty samples sub-
scription service that now has over 400,000 monthly 
subscribers.
the college experience
Beauchamp and Barna quickly became friends. They 
were also in the same MBA cohort and took many of their 
classes together. The idea for Birchbox emerged gradu-
ally. One class was particularly instrumental. It was a class 
on disruptive innovation taught by Harvard professor 
Clayton Christensen. The class challenged the students 
to think of a big idea that’s an industry game changer. 
Beauchamp and Barna’s first idea  concerned the beauty 
industry, which hadn’t experienced significant innovation 
for many years. A personal dynamic also nudged them

towards a business idea in the beauty industry. Barna’s 
best friend, Mollie Chen, was a beauty editor. Beauchamp 
would notice that Barna always had the best beauty prod-
ucts, and when asked where she got them, she would al-
ways say that Chen (the beauty editor) had recommended 
them. It got Beauchamp and Barna thinking “wouldn’t 
every woman like to have a best friend that was a beauty 
 editor and could recommend beauty products to them?”
Beauchamp and Barna’s thoughts coalesced in the 
last semester of their two-year MBA program. for the 
first time, they were thinking about starting a business 
together. They saw a void in the marketplace ripe to 
be filled. Companies had come up with great ways to 
sell many products online, including fashion, but not 
beauty products. Beauty products are tough to sell on-
line because they have a touch, try, and feel element to 
them. To capitalize on the opportunity of selling beauty 
products online, and get around the hesitation that 
people have for buying beauty products without touch-
ing and seeing them first, Beauchamp and Barna’s 
idea was an online monthly subscription service that 
consisted of a small box of beauty product samples 
that qualified customers could try out. They would then 
offer full-sized versions of the samples on their website 
for sale. The major brands were already making sam-
ples that they handed out in stores. Beauchamp and 
Barna decided to call their business Birchbox.

Barna did everything they could to leverage their college 
status. They negotiated with their professors so their 
final project in each class would be Birchbox. They also 
used their student status as a way of getting their foot 
in the door with suppliers and customers. for Birchbox 
to work, Beauchamp and Barna had to answer three 
fundamental questions. first, would beauty brands work 
with them, in regard to providing samples? Second, 
would women pay for curated boxes of samples? And 
third, would samples drive full-sized purchases? The only 
way, they figured, to answer these questions was to go 
straight to the sources. first, they built a prototype of the 
box in which they would send the monthly samples and 
determined how the samples would be presented in the 
box. They then thought through the rest of the business. 
Each month, the box would contain five beauty product 
samples. Information would be put on their website and 
YouTube channel about each product, so the customer 
could learn more about them. They would then offer full-
sized versions of the products for sale. To get buy-in, they 
“cold-called” beauty and cosmetics companies. They 
never hid the fact that they were still in college. Instead, 
they framed it as an advantage (they had a readymade 
audience of their target market right in their classes). 
Incredibly, several of the companies, including Benefits, 
Nars, and Keihl’s signed on. Second, they created a beta 
version of their website and incented 200 subscribers to 
pay them $20 a month to test their concept. They used 
feedback from the users to improve the original Birchbox 
in several key areas. At this point, Beauchamp and Barna 
had more than an idea. They had suppliers, a preliminary 
list of potential customers, results, and data.
After completing these steps, Beauchamp and 
Barna entered Birchbox into the HBS business plan 
competition. They won second place, which further 
bolstered their confidence. The competition provided 
tremendous exposure for Birchbox and for Beauchamp 
and Barna as nascent entrepreneurs. They met people 
who became advisers and mentors. The competition 
was judged by venture capitalists, and several of them 
offered the pair money. They passed on the offers, 
thinking it would be best to keep Birchbox lean.
Birchbox officially launched in September 2010. At 
the outset, it remained lean and reflected a college stu-
dent’s lifestyle. After graduation, Beauchamp and Barna 
moved Birchbox to Brooklyn to be closer to their suppli-
ers. Their first office was unpretentious and had IKEA fur-
niture. Beauchamp and Barna learned many lessons the 
hard, and sometimes fun, way. for example, when they 
made their first product video they tried to recruit volun-
teers in Union Square (a popular area in Manhattan). They 
soon found that it’s impossible to get busy New Yorkers 
to volunteer, so they, along with a couple of early employ-
ees, dressed up and starred in the video themselves. By 
the end of 2010, Birchbox had 10,000 subscribers.

a small collection of 
 high-quality beauty, 
grooming, and  lifestyle 
product samples. The 
product samples are

Birchbox today
Birchbox today is operating on all cylinders. The com-
pany has 400,000 monthly subscribers. Its monthly 
subscription service for women, which costs $10 per 
month, is much the same as it was when the company 
originally launched, except that subscribers now fill out 
a beauty profile and several versions of the monthly box 
are sent out. In 2012, the company launched Birchbox 
Man, a $20 box filled with men’s grooming supplies and 
lifestyle products. It also started testing a limited edition 
“home box” for $58 a month that will include home dé-
cor products and items such as seasonal napkins and 
decorations. In September 2012, Birchbox acquired 
JolieBox, a Paris-based competitor. The acquisition 
will allow Birchbox to more effectively enter European 
markets. Along the way the company has grown to 140 
employees and raised almost $12 million in funding.
The company’s performance metrics are also 
strong. The number of monthly subscribers in all of 
its categories continues to grow. More than half of its 
monthly subscribers make purchases from the firm’s 
e-commerce store, and the e-commerce store now rep-
resents a quarter of its revenue. Birchbox’s online store 
even attracts business from nonsubscribers. About 15 
percent of the company’s orders come from customers 
who don’t get the monthly box of sample products.
Birchbox’s model is also working out for its suppli-
ers. Traditionally, beauty suppliers have tried to acquire 
customers by handing out samples at their counters and 
in other parts of stores and malls. Birchbox’s customers, 
in stark contrast, actually pay to be acquired through 
the monthly subscription service. They in effect opt-in 
and explicitly want to be sampled. When Birchbox sells 
a full-sized version of something that was sampled 
through its subscription service, it shares the revenue 
with the supplier.
challenges ahead
Despite its success, Birchbox has significant challenges. 
It may at some point plateau in terms of subscribers for 
its staple women’s subscription service. New markets 
may be more difficult to grow. for example, the num-
ber of products and product samples made for men’s 
grooming and lifestyle supplies is much lower than 
those made for women. It may also be difficult to find 
as large a following for products like home décor as for 
women’s beauty suppliers.
Another challenge Birchbox faces is growing 
competition. A number of start-ups have replicated 
Birchbox’s monthly subscription service for beauty 
product samples for women. While Birchbox remains 
the clear leader in this space, the number of competi-
tors it is attracting is somewhat worrisome. Interestingly, 
while it doesn’t directly impact Birchbox’s business, the 
company has also inspired a wave of companies selling 
monthly boxed products in almost every conceivable 
area, including fishing, food, crafts, kids’ toys, products 
for dogs, and wine.

introduction
Imagine the following. You’re in the audience of a busi-
ness plan competition. The next team up to present is 
d.light, a for-profit social enterprise that plans to bring 
light to people without access to reliable electricity. 
Two young men introduce themselves as the founders 
of d.light, and say they’re going to start their presenta-
tion with a demonstration. The lights go out. In a few

seconds, you see a dim light at the front of the room, 
and smell smoke and burning kerosene. After about 
30 seconds, your eyes start to water and it becomes 
slightly uncomfortable to breathe. The lights switch back 
on and the smoke clears. The young men apologize for 
the lack of light and the smoke, but say the demonstra-
tion was staged to illustrate a point. Around 1.6 billion 
people, or more than one fifth of the world’s population, 
have no access to electricity, and about a billion more 
have an unreliable or intermittent supply. A large share 
of these people use kerosene to light their homes at 
night. Kerosene fumes are extremely unhealthy, even 
fatal. In fact, the United Nations estimates that kerosene 
fumes kill 1.5 million people per year, and cause count-
less health complications for others.
sam Goldman and the origins of d.light
The scene described here actually took place—several 
times. It’s the way Sam Goldman and Ned Tozun, the 
co-founders of d.light, introduced the company at busi-
ness plan competitions and when they pitched investors. 
d.light is an international consumer products company 
serving “base of the pyramid” consumers who don’t have 
access to reliable electricity. Although d.light technically 
started in a class at Stanford University, its beginning can 
be traced to Sam Goldman’s youth and early adulthood. 
Growing up, Goldman’s parents worked for the United 
States Agency for International Development (USAID), a 
government agency that provides economic and humani-
tarian assistance in countries across the globe. Goldman 
lived in Pakistan, Peru, India, Canada, and several other 
countries. As a young adult, while working for the Peace 
Corps, he lived for four years in a West African village that 
had no electricity. A neighbor boy was badly burned in a 
kerosene fire, an event that deeply impacted Goldman. 
At one point during his time in the village, Goldman was 
given a battery-powered LED headlamp, and was struck 
by the dramatic difference that simply having light at night 
can make in a person’s life. He could now cook, read, 
and do things at night that were unimaginable without the 
benefits reliable lighting provides.
Impacted by this experience, Goldman sought out 
a graduate program that would provide him the op-
portunity to start thinking about creating a business to 
take light to people without access to reliable electricity. 
He landed at Stanford, which was starting a program 
in social enterprise. A pivotal class was Jim Patelli’s 
2006–2007 Entrepreneurial Design course. The class 
was divided into teams, and each team was challenged 
to address a significant issue in the developing world. 
Goldman was teamed up with Ned Tozun, a business 
classmate, and two engineering students, Erica Estrade 
and Xian Wu. The team tackled the problem of light for 
people without access to reliable electricity, and de-
veloped a rough prototype of a portable LED light that 
could be recharged via solar power. That spring, the 
team traveled to Burma for the purpose of going into vil-
lages that didn’t have access to electricity to introduce 
their device. villagers told them they spent up to 40 
percent of their income on kerosene. When shown how 
their crude prototype could provide light at night and be 
recharged during the day simply by deploying small solar 
panels on their homes, the villagers were so taken that 
one woman actually wept. According to one account of 
the team’s trip, in one village the local police confiscated 
the prototypes. They, too, needed light at night.
design and distribution
After completing the Entrepreneurial Design course, 
the teammates headed their separate directions for 
the summer. In the fall, they reunited, determined to 
continue to work on their business concept. The con-
cept of using solar power to recharge portable lights in 
poor rural areas wasn’t new. In fact, it had been tried 
many times. The problem, in Goldman and his team’s 
estimation, was a combination of design and distri-
bution. Previous models relied either on NGOs and 
governments “giving” fairly expensive lights to people 
without access to electricity, which they couldn’t afford 
to replace when used up or if broken, or commercial 
enterprises buying extremely inexpensive lights in China 
and exporting them to Africa and elsewhere, where they 
performed poorly. It was clear to Goldman that neither 
of these models was sustainable.
So Goldman and his team, driven by the possibility 
of changing literally millions of people’s lives throughout 
the world, recruited talented engineers and distribu-
tion experts, who worked on a near pro bono basis, to 
help with the project. The goal was to produce a solar-
powered portable LED light that was exactly what rural 
villagers needed—nothing more and nothing less. It 
also had to be cheap enough that villagers could afford 
it yet capable of being produced in a way that yielded 
sufficient margins for d.light to be profitable. The deci-
sion was made early on that d.light would be a for-
profit company. The company’s goal was not to impact 
100,000 people or a million people but to impact hun-
dreds of millions of people. Goldman and his team knew 
that their lofty ambitions would take cash and additional 
R&D efforts, which would require private-sector invest-
ment capital.
During this period, which covered the summer of 
2007 until early 2008, Goldman and his co-founders 
continued traveling to remote areas for the purpose 
of obtaining feedback about their prototype. During 
Christmas break, instead of traveling home to see his 
family, Goldman was in the middle of Myanmar doing 
research. The team thinned some in early 2008, with 
Goldman, Tozan, and Wu continuing. d.light was now 
up-and-running and opened its first international offices 
in India, China, and Tanzania.
Business Plan competitions and investor 
Presentations
One thing Goldman stresses during talks about d.light 
is the instrumental role that the company’s business 
plan played in helping the company take shape and 

236    PART 2 | DEvELOPING SUCCESSfUL BUSINESS IDEAS
in raising investment capital. Early on, d.light entered 
several business plan competitions. It the spring 
of 2007, it took second place in the University of 
California, Berkley’s Social venture Competition and 
won first prize at Stanford’s Social E-Challenge. A big 
breakthrough happened in May 2007, when the team 
claimed the $250,000 first prize in the prestigious 
Draper fisher Jurvetson venture Challenge competi-
tion. This money provided seed funding for much of 
the work that was completed during the summer and 
fall of 2007.
What’s particularly interesting is Goldman’s reflec-
tions about why d.light was so successful in business 
plan competitions and eventually with investor presen-
tations. These reflections are instructive for entrepre-
neurs as they think about how to design and then suc-
cessfully launch their ventures. As shown in the nearby 
table, there are six reasons that account for d.light’s 
success, specifically with business plan competitions. 
Collectively, the attributes shown in the table present 
d.light as an organization with a compelling idea, a 
strong management team, large markets to serve, an 
intense product focus, and a coherent, resolute, and 
extremely admirable vision for the future.
d.light today
Today, d.light is having the impact that its founders 
envisioned it could. The nearby chart shows the num-
bers on d.light’s social impact dashboard, which is 
updated frequently. These numbers reflect the impact 
of the availability of light, produced by d.light solar 
lanterns, for people who didn’t previously have ac-
cess to reliable electricity and light. The numbers are 
remarkable, particularly in terms of lives empowered, 
school-aged children reached with solar lighting, and 
savings in energy-related expenses. The numbers re-
flect the good that a well-managed social enterprise 
can create.

d.light sells its product through a number of chan-
nels in more than 30 countries. One strategy that has 
worked well is to employ “rural entrepreneurs” to sell 
the product. d.light likes to employ indigenous per-
sonnel, who know the local customs, people, and 
language, to sell its product on a commission basis. 
It also has partnerships with NGOs, microfinance or-
ganizations, and social enterprise start-ups that are 
producing solar lanterns to achieve the same goals it 
is striving towards. In 2013, d.light entered into a major 
partnership with Total, a french oil and gas company 
that sells d.light’s products as part of the “Access to 
Energy Program” throughout Africa. As a result of the 
Total partnership, and its initiatives across the world, 
d.light now makes more than 500,000 of its solar lan-
terns per month. The first few years of its existence, 
d.light’s production was more in the neighborhood of 
20,000 to 30,000 units per month. d.light has funded 
its operations and growth through both investment 
capital and earnings. d.light is also continually updat-
ing its products. for example, its newest design incor-
porates a smartphone charger, knowing smartphones 
are the lifeline of many small business owners and oth-
ers in developing countries.

challenges ahead
As it continues to grow, d.light faces a host of chal-
lenges. The problem it is trying to solve, to provide 
a reliable source of light to people without access to 
electricity, is as large as ever. The United Nations now 
estimates that over 2 billion people in the world do not 
have access to reliable electricity. Incredibly, that num-
ber is higher than when d.light was founded in 2007. 
Its for-profit status is also periodically challenged. A

CHAPTER 6 | WRITING A BuSineSS PLAN    237
six key reasons d.light was successful in Business Plan competitions
Told Stories and  
Showed Pictures
While many teams enter business plan competitions with impressive PowerPoint slides and bullet 
points, d.light focused on telling stories and showing pictures. The company’s founders showed 
photographs of rural villagers using their device, and shared their testimonials. In one interview, 
Goldman remarked that no matter how many plans or pitches a group of judges or investors 
heard during a day, he was confident they remembered d.light’s presentation.
All In
The founders were fully committed to d.light. They passed on corporate jobs and focused on 
d.light full time. Along with “talking the talk,” they also “walked the walk.” Instead of saying that 
they planned to travel to remote villages to test their device, they just went out and did it. Some 
of the trips came before the business plan presentations.
Right Team
d.light put together a strong team, with a balance of business and engineering expertise. The 
team was well-suited for launching a global initiative. Goldman had lived overseas the majority 
of his life, in places like India and Pakistan. Other team members had demonstrated that they 
had no inhibitions about traveling to remote villages to talk about their device.
Big Market
d.light was tackling a large market, which investors like. To make their financials work, the team 
would have to scale the business and sell millions of units. While the challenge was great, so was 
the potential payoff.
Product focus
The company iterated its device multiple times before settling on its first solar-powered portable 
LED light, called the Nova. The Nova sold for a U.S. equivalent of around $25. Early feedback 
indicated that the price was still too high, so more iterations took place.
Strong vision
Although d.light was a social enterprise, it unashamedly presented itself as a for-profit venture. 
The team was resolute that getting to scale could only be accomplished via private-sector 
 capital. d.light also measured its success by the number of families it positively impacted. 
This sense of purpose and vision permeated the organization.
discussion Questions
 6-38. Why is the problem of bringing light to people who 
don’t have access to reliable electricity not being tack-
led in a meaningful way by a large lighting  company, 
such as GE (General Electric) or Philips?
 6-39. What qualities do Sam Goldman and his team have 
that will help them solve the problem of providing 
light to the billions of people in the world who lack 
access to reliable electricity?
 6-40. Why does Sam Goldman go out of his way to talk 
about the importance of d.light’s business plan? In 
what ways do you think having a meticulously created 
business helped d.light in its launch efforts?
 6-41. If you were one of d.light’s founders, what would your 
marketing strategy be? How would you go about edu-
cating people in remote areas of the world about your 
product and the beneifts associated with purchasing it?

d.light lantern costs the equivalent of 30 U.S. dollars, an 
amount that remains beyond the reach of many people 
in underdeveloped countries. Some observers believe 
that companies like d.light should be nonprofits and give 
their lanterns away. d.light’s counter to this argument 
is that the only way to effectively tackle the worldwide 
shortage of reliable lighting is to stimulate business 
activity through the private sector. How can an entre-
preneur in Kenya, the company argues, make a living 
selling solar lights if a nearby NGO is giving them away 
for free?
d.light also continues to face the challenge of con-
vincing hesistant customers with a little extra income to 
invest in unfamiliar technology. Although kerosene has 
many harmful side effects, it is an integral part of many 
villagers’ lives. It often takes an influential person in a 
village buying a d.light lantern for others to follow suit. 
d.light is also continually trying to lower the price point 
of its basic lanterns.
d.light’s efforts have clearly made a difference in 
the lives of millions of people. The firm has received 
 numerous awards to recognize what it has accomplished. 
One particularly nice distinction is its place in the British 
Museum’s History of the World in 100 Objects. d.light’s 
basic lantern, the S250, is object number 100 in the 
collection.
d.light’s stated goal is to impact the lives of at least 
100 million people by 2020. It appears to be well on its 
way to achieving the goal.

ohn Harden enlisted in the United States Air Force on September 11, 2001. He 
entered the Air Force as an Airman, which is an enlisted rank, as a computer 
systems operator. While serving a deployment in Qatar, he developed an inter-
est in studying Japanese. He was eventually assigned duty in Japan, 
where he was disappointed in his inability to converse more fluently 
with the local population. The disappointment led Harden to check 
out several foreign language instruction programs, none of which he 
found to be particularly impressive.
In August 2004 Harden took a leave from active duty to enter 
the Air Force ROTC program at Oklahoma State University. While 
at Oklahoma State, he studied Japanese for two years, earning an 
A in each of his classes. Harden graduated from Oklahoma State in 
December 2007, and reentered the Air Force as second lieutenant 
and became a public affairs officer shortly thereafter.
Harden’s interest in foreign language grew. He tried a number of 
foreign language instruction apps, but none maintained his interest. 
In his free time, he enjoyed playing games on apps or the Internet—
the types of games where you have to slay dragons or perform 
some other feat to advance to higher levels. In fact, when trying to use a foreign 
language instruction program, Harden often caught himself switching back and forth 
from the language program to games, as he found them more engaging.
This was the inspiration for Tempered Mind, the mobile app company Harden 
launched in early 2012. The idea was to create a foreign language instruction plat-
form that would combine both of his interests—foreign language and gaming. Rather 
than “gamify” educational material—using game mechanics in non-game contexts 
to engage users in solving problems—Harden sought to make studying and learning 
a primary requirement to progress through a fully-developed game. His approach is 
intended to leverage people’s natural desire for competition, achievement, status, and 
self-expression while simultaneously keeping them engaged in learning new mate-
rial. Harden decided to start with a program that would teach French, German, and 
Spanish. Those languages represent 93 percent of the foreign language instruction that 
is provided by U.S. public schools.

Chapter 7

242    PART 3 | MOvInG FROM An IDeA TO An enTRePReneURIAL FIRM
The way in which Tempered Mind’s app was developed, and the company was built, 
is an interesting story. Also interesting is the work that was done to place Tempered 
Mind on a sound ethical and legal foundation from the beginning.
Tempered Mind was created primarily by Harden, with some assistance from his 
brother, Dan Harden, and a family friend. Dan Harden is a certified financial planner 
(CFP) and is Tempered Mind’s chief financial officer (CFO). The work on Tempered 
Mind began in early 2012, when Harden obtained the Internet domain name, www.
temperedmind.com, which was available. To build the back end of the app, Harden 
used contract labor, found primarily on Odesk.com. Harden provided the overall 
vision for the game and managed the development process. To learn more about 
entrepreneurship, and the new venture creation process, Harden separated from the 
Air Force in spring 2012 and entered the Master’s in entrepreneurship program at 
Oklahoma State. One course, in particular, titled “Launching a Business: The First 100 
Days,” was instrumental in helping Harden actually start the business. The course is a 
very nuts-and-bolts class that walks students through the steps necessary to launch 
a new firm. Partly because of this course, and also as a result of his own initiative, one 
thing Harden prioritized was making sure Tempered Mind started on a firm ethical and 
legal foundation. Here are the specific steps that Harden took, some before the class 
and some after, to make this priority a reality.
■ Obtained the appropriate Internet domain name (mentioned above)
■ Obtained a Federal Tax Identification number
■ Obtained a DUnS number (which is a nine-digit identification number used by 
Dun & Bradstreet for credit reporting purposes)
■ Registered Tempered Mind as a C-Corporation
■ engaged an intellectual property attorney to obtain the appropriate copyrights and 
trademarks
■ Created nondisclosure agreements for contractors
■ Opened a bank account
These items placed Tempered Mind on a solid legal foundation. Business ethics 
was also a concern. There are several temptations that mobile app developers have to 
be careful to avoid. One is to essentially pay people to write positive reviews. Another 
is to exaggerate the potential and efficacy of the game. Harden was mindful of these 
temptations and vowed from the outset to avoid them. His posture was to create and 
run Tempered Mind in as ethical a manner as possible.
Tempered Mind is now up and running, and the app is available via the Apple 
App Store. Any review posted is from a legitimate user. The app is targeted towards 
the 13–22 age range. The hope is that Tempered Mind will be adopted by both tradi-
tional and online schools. At the time this featured was written, the company was on 
target to pilot its app in one school district in fall 2014. Although he is pleased with 
how Tempered Mind has progressed, Harden does have some suggestions for other 
entrepreneurs, particular in the area of establishing a legal foundation. He believes 
that having a full-time co-founder would have made the process easier. Tempered 
Mind has not engaged an attorney, other than to do the legal work necessary to ob-
tain copyrights and trademarks. In retrospect, Harden felt that utilizing an attorney 
would have been helpful.

W
e begin this chapter with a discussion of the most important initial ethical 
and legal issues facing a new firm, including establishing a strong ethical 
organizational culture, choosing a lawyer, drafting a founders’ agreement, 
and avoiding litigation. Next, we discuss the different forms of business organi-
zation, including sole proprietorships, partnerships, corporations, and limited 
liability companies.
In Chapter 12, we discuss the protection of intellectual property through 
patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets. This topic, which is also a 
legal issue, is becoming increasingly important as entrepreneurs rely more on 
intellectual property rather than physical property as a source of a competi-
tive advantage. Chapter 15 discusses legal issues pertaining to franchising. The 
chapter next discusses the licenses and permits that may be needed to launch a 
business, along with the different forms of business organization, including sole 
proprietorships, partnerships, corporations, and limited liability companies.
As the opening feature about Tempered Mind suggests, new ventures must 
deal with important ethical and legal issues at the time of their launching. As a 
company grows, the legal environment becomes more complex. A reevaluation 
of a company’s ownership structure usually takes place when investors become 
involved. In addition, companies that go public in the United States are required 
to comply with a host of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regula-
tions. Of course, firms established in nations throughout the world must comply 
with regulations that are specific to those countries.
Against this backdrop, the following sections discuss several of the most 
important ethical and legal issues facing the founders of new firms.
establishing a strong ethical culture  
for a Firm
One of the most important things the founders of an entrepreneurial venture 
can do is establish a strong ethical culture for their firms. The data regarding 
business ethics are both encouraging and discouraging. The most recent ver-
sion of the National Business Ethics Survey was published in 2013. This survey 
is the only longitudinal study that tracks the experiences of employees within 
organizations regarding business ethics. According to the survey, 41 percent 
of the 6,420 employees surveyed reported that they had observed misconduct 
or unethical behavior in the past year. Of the employees who observed miscon-
duct, 63 percent reported their observation to a supervisor or another authority 
in their firm.1 The 10 most common types of misconduct or unethical behavior 
observed by the employees surveyed are shown in Table 7.1.
While the percentage of employees who have observed misconduct or un-
ethical behavior (41 percent) is discouraging, it’s encouraging that 63 percent of 
employees reported the behavior. Support, trust, and transparency also make 
a difference. Employees who reported that their supervisor conducts his or 
her personal life in an ethical manner reported ethical misconduct at a rate of 
74 percent, compared to a 51 percent reporting rate for employees who are less 
confident about their direct supervisor’s personal ethical conduct. Similarly, a 
total of 72 percent of employees who said they received positive feedback from 
their supervisor for their ethical conduct reported ethical misconduct when ob-
served compared to only 51 percent that did not receive similar support.2 Both 
of these comparisons indicate that an employee’s supervisor makes a major 
difference in regard to whether an employee reports ethical misconduct or not.
In analyzing the results of its survey, the Ethics Resource Center concluded 
that the most important thing an organization can do to combat ethical miscon-
duct is to establish a strong ethical culture.3 But strong ethical cultures don’t 
emerge by themselves. It takes entrepreneurs who make ethics a priority and

organizational policies and procedures that encourage ethical behavior (and 
punish unethical behavior) to make it happen. The following are specific steps 
that an entrepreneurial organization can take to build a strong ethical culture.
lead by example
Leading by example is the most important thing that any entrepreneur, man-
ager, or supervisor can do to build a strong ethical culture in their organization. 
In strong ethical cultures, entrepreneurs, managers, and supervisors:
■ Communicate ethics as a priority
■ Set a good example of ethical conduct
■ Keep commitments
■ Provide information about what is going on
■ Support following organizational standards4
Employees also have responsibilities. The most important things that employees 
can do to support a strong ethical culture in an organization are to:
■ Consider ethics in making decisions
■ Talk about ethics in the work (they) do
■ Set a good example of ethical conduct
■ Support following organizational standards5
In companies where these attributes are present, a stronger ethical culture 
 exists. This reality demonstrates the important role that everyone involved with a 
start-up plays in developing a strong ethical culture for their firm.

establish a code of conduct
A code of conduct (or code of ethics) is a formal statement of an organiza-
tion’s values on certain ethical and social issues.6 The advantage of having a 
code of conduct is that it provides specific guidance to entrepreneurs, man-
agers, and employees regarding expectations of them in terms of ethical be-
havior. Consider what Google has done in this area. The company’s informal 
corporate motto is “Don’t be evil,” but it also has a formal code of conduct, 
which explicitly states what is and isn’t permissible in the organization. The 
table of contents for Google’s code of conduct is shown in Table 7.2. It il-
lustrates the ethical issues that Google thinks can be bolstered and better 
explained to employees via a written document to which they are required to 
adhere. A copy of Google’s full code of conduct is available at http://investor.

Table 7.2  continued
In practice, some codes of conduct are very specific, like Google’s. Other 
codes of conduct set out more general principles about an organization’s be-
liefs on issues such as product quality, respect for customers and employees, 
and social responsibility. In all cases though, codes of conduct are intended 
to influence people to behave in ways that are consistent with a firm’s ethical 
orientation.
implement an ethics training Program
Firms also use ethics training programs to promote ethical behavior. Ethics 
training programs teach business ethics to help employees deal with ethical 
dilemmas and improve their overall ethical conduct. An ethical dilemma is a 
situation that involves doing something that is beneficial to oneself or the orga-
nization, but may be unethical. Most employees confront ethical dilemmas at 
some point during their careers.
Ethics training programs can be provided by outside vendors or can be devel-
oped in-house. For example, one organization, Character Training International 
(CTI), provides ethics training programs for both large organizations and smaller 
entrepreneurial firms. The company offers a variety of ethics-related training 
services, including ethics training videos/DVD programs, ethics online courses, 
train-the-trainer curriculum, and consulting services. A distinctive attribute of 

CHAPTeR 7 | PRePARInG THe PROPeR Ethical and lEgal FOUnDATIOn    247
CTI is its focus on the moral and ethical roots of workplace behavior. In work-
shops, participants talk about the reasons behind ethical dilemmas and are pro-
vided practical, helpful information about how to prevent problems and how to 
deal appropriately with the ethical problems and temptations that do arise. The 
hope is that this training will significantly cut down on employee misconduct 
and fraud and will increase morale.7
In summary, ethical cultures are built through both strong ethical lead-
ership and administrative tools that reinforce and govern ethical behavior 
in organizations. Building an ethical culture motivates employees to behave 
ethically and responsibly from the inside out, rather than relying strictly on 
laws that motivate behavior from the outside in.8 There are many potential 
payoffs to organizations that act and behave in an ethical manner. A sample 
of the potential payoffs appears in Figure 7.1.
The strength of a firm’s ethical culture and fortitude is put to the test when 
it faces a crisis or makes a mistake and has to determine how to respond. Fitbit 
provides an example of this, as described in the nearby “What Went Wrong?” 
feature. In early 2014 Fitbit, the maker of wearable devices that measure data 
such as number of steps walked, quality of sleep, and other personal metrics, 
was forced to recall its newest product, the Fitbit Force. A number of users 
reported skin irritations from wearing the device (the Fitbit Force is worn on a 
user’s wrist). Observers vary regarding whether Fitbit reacted quickly enough, 
and whether the episode tells us that Fitbit has a strong or weak ethical cul-
ture. After reading the case, you will be ready to decide for yourself.
Dealing effectively with legal issues
Those leading entrepreneurial ventures can also expect to encounter a number 
of important legal issues when launching and then, at least initially, operating 
their firm. We discuss a number of these issues next.
choosing an attorney for a Firm
It is important for an entrepreneur to select an attorney as early as possible 
when developing a business venture. Selecting an attorney was instrumental 
in helping Tempered Mind, the company profiled in the opening feature, estab-
lish a firm legal foundation. Table 7.3 provides guidelines to consider when se-
lecting an attorney. It is critically important that the attorney be familiar with 
start-up issues and that he or she has successfully shepherded entrepreneurs 
through the start-up process before. It is not wise to select an attorney just

t’s every business owner’s nightmare. Your company 
launches a new product, the reviews are good, sales 
take off, and then, out of nowhere, people using 
your product start getting sick. The question quickly 
becomes: what to do? It’s the type of question that 
tests a company’s ethical culture and its moral fiber. In 
Fitbit’s case, some observers feel the company met the 
challenge by putting its customer’s health concerns 
first. Others feel Fitbit could have reacted more swiftly 
and decisively. Here’s what happened.
Fitbit was launched in 2007. The company makes 
wearable activity trackers that measure data such as 
number of steps walked, quality of sleep, and other per-
sonal metrics. Fitbit has grown quickly and is the clear 
leader in the wearable activity tracker industry. Its market 
share is around 50 percent, well ahead of Jawbone and 
nike, its main competitors in the industry.
Since its launch in 2007, Fitbit has produced a string 
of progressively better products, including the Fitbit 
Ultra, the Fitbit One, the Fitbit Zip, and the Fitbit Flex. 
On October 10, 2013, the company introduced the Fitbit 
Force, its newest product. The Fitbit Force tracks a 
number of statistics in real time, including steps taken, 
distance traveled, calories burned, stairs climbed, and 
active minutes throughout the day. It also tracks sleep 
quality at night. Initial reviews were both positive and 
enthusiastic.
Shortly after the Force went on sale, Fitbit started 
getting reports that a small fraction of users were 
experiencing skin irritations while wearing the device 
(the Force is worn around the user’s wrist). Symptoms 
ranged from red, itchy skin to painful blisters that 
would ooze or bleed. Some users sought medical 
attention, and were typically prescribed prednisone 
(used to treat allergic reactions) and antibiotics. On 
January 14, 2014, Fitbit issued a statement indicating 
that it was looking into reports of users experiencing 
skin irritations as a result of wearing the Force. It sug-
gested that the irritations were possibly a result of an 
allergic reaction to nickel, an element of the stainless 
steel used in the device. Fitbit offered an immediate 
refund or replacement with a different Fitbit device 
to anyone affected. It concluded the statement by 
saying:
“We are sorry that even a few customers have ex-
perienced these problems and assure you that we 
are looking at ways to modify the product so that 
anyone can wear the Fitbit Force comfortably.”
Reports of problems continued, with no definitive 
resolution of why the Force was causing skin irritations. 
On February 20, 2014, Fitbit issued a statement saying 
that it was halting sales of the Fitbit Force, and issued 
a voluntary recall of the device. The same day, Fitbit 
co-founder and CeO James Pak issued another state-
ment. The statement said, in part:
“Recently, some Force users have reported skin 
irritation. While only 1.7% of Force users have 
reported any type of skin irritation, we care about 
every one of our customers. On behalf of the entire 
Fitbit team, I want to apologize to anyone affected.”
The statement went on to provide a bullet-point list of 
what the company knew about the causes of the irrita-
tions. The most likely cause, according to an independent 
lab, was allergic contact dermatitis. Allergic contact der-
matitis is a catch-all term for red or inflamed skin brought 
on by allergies or irritants.
On March 12, 2014, the Consumer Products Safety 
Commission (CPSC) took action. It announced a recall 
of the one million Fitbit Force units sold in the United 
States and the 28,000 sold in Canada. It also made it 
illegal to sell the Fitbit Force. As a result, anyone who 
had the Force for sale on Craigslist, eBay, or a similar 
site had to take it down. The CPSC reported that it had 
received about 9,000 complaints of the wristband caus-
ing skin irritations and about 250 reports of blistering.
The reaction to how Fitbit handled the Fitbit Force 
situation has been mixed. Some have praised Fitbit for 
showing concern for its customers and for relatively 
quickly issuing a voluntary recall. For example, a March 
2, 2014, editorial in Entrepreneur magazine was titled 
“How Fitbit, Like Tylenol Before It, Handled a Recall 
the Right Way.” Others have been critical, feeling that 
Fitbit should have reacted more swiftly. Some Force 
users also feel that Fitbit hasn’t come completely clean 
on the exact causes of the skin irritations. They’d like 
to know whether there will be any long-term adverse 
health consequences caused by the irritations. An ex-
ample is a man who lives in Bozeman, Montana, and 
bought a Fitbit Force for his girlfriend. His reaction, as 
reported on ABC news’s health blog, was as follows:
“The bigger issue is dealing with the unknown. Is 
this a carcinogen reaction? Will it affect her im-
mune system? I’m sick over this,” he wrote in an 
e-mail. “A gift that was meant to promote health 
has turned into a nightmare.”
Questions for Critical Thinking
 1. What does the Fitbit Force incident tell you about 
Fitbit’s ethical culture?
 2. On a scale of 1-10 (10 is high), how well do you think 
Fitbit handled the Fitbit Force situation? After reading 
this feature, if you were shopping for a wearable fitness 
tracker, would you be more inclined or less inclined to 
buy a Fitbit product and why?

because she is a friend or because you were pleased with the way she prepared 
your will. For issues dealing with intellectual property protection, it is essential 
to use an attorney who specializes in this field; such as a patent attorney when 
filing a patent application.9
While hiring an attorney is advisable, it is not the only option available for 
researching, preparing, and filing the necessary forms to get a business up 
and running legally. Most business owners can do much of the preliminary 
work on their own, and they rely on an attorney for guidance and advice. If 
you’re particularly tight on money and feel as though you can handle por-
tions of the legal process on your own (which is not generally recommended 
but may apply in some cases), there are online companies that can help you 
with the necessary forms and filings. Examples include LegalZoom (www.le-
galzoom.com), Rocket Lawyer (www.rocketlawyer.com), and Nolo (www.nolo.
com). All three companies provide a comprehensive menu of legal services 
for business owners, including the ability to ask a lawyer questions either 
for free or for a modest fee. It’s a judgment call as to whether to hire a lawyer 
to do your legal work, utilize a service such as LegalZoom, RocketLawyer, 
or Nolo, or pursue a blended approach. A blended approach might involve 
hiring an attorney to obtain legal advice (such as determining your form of 
business ownership) and then utilizing one of the online services to prepare 
the documents and file them with the appropriate governmental agencies on 
your behalf.

Table 7.3  How to select an attorney
1. Contact the local bar association and ask for a list of attorneys who specialize in business start-ups in your area.
2. Interview several attorneys. Check references. Ask your prospective attorney whom he or she has guided through 
the start-up process before and talk to the attorney’s clients. If an attorney is reluctant to give you the names of past or 
present clients, select another attorney.
3. Select an attorney who is familiar with the start-up process. Make sure that the attorney is more than just a legal technician. 
Most entrepreneurs need an attorney who is patient and is willing to guide them through the start-up process.
4. Select an attorney who can assist you in raising money for your venture. This is a challenging issue for most entrepreneurs, 
and help in this area can be invaluable.
5. Make sure your attorney has a track record of completing his or her work on time. It can be very frustrating to be prepared 
to move forward with a business venture, only to be stymied by delays on the part of an attorney.
6. Talk about fees. If your attorney won’t give you a good idea of what the start-up process will cost, keep looking.
7. Trust your intuition. Select an attorney who you think understands your business and with whom you will be comfortable 
spending time and having open discussions about the dreams you have for your entrepreneurial venture.
8. Learn as much about the process of starting a business yourself as possible. It will help you identify any problems that 
may exist or any aspect that may have been overlooked. Remember, it’s your business start-up, not your attorney’s. 
Stay in control.

250    PART 3 | MOvInG FROM An IDeA TO An enTRePReneURIAL FIRM
drafting a Founders’ agreement
If two or more people start a business, it is important that they have a found-
ers’ (or shareholders’) agreement. A founders’ agreement is a written docu-
ment that deals with issues such as the relative split of the equity among the 
founders of the firm, how individual founders will be compensated for the cash 
or the “sweat equity” they put into the firm, and how long the founders will 
have to remain with the firm for their shares to fully vest.10
The items typically included in a founders’ agreement are shown in Table 7.4.
An important issue addressed by most founders’ agreements is what hap-
pens to the equity of a founder if the founder dies or decides to leave the firm. 
Most founders’ agreements include a buyback clause, which legally obligates 
 departing founders to sell to the remaining founders their interest in the firm 
if the remaining founders are interested.11 In most cases, the agreement also 
specifies the formula for computing the dollar value to be paid. The presence of a 
buyback clause is important for at least two reasons. First, if a founder leaves the 
firm, the remaining founders may need the shares to offer to a replacement per-
son. Second, if founders leave because they are disgruntled, the buyback clause 
provides the remaining founders a mechanism to keep the shares of the firm in 
the hands of people who are fully committed to a positive future for the venture.
Vesting ownership in company stock is another topic most founders’ agree-
ments address. The idea behind vesting is that when a firm is launched, in-
stead of issuing stock outright to the founder or founders, it is distributed over 
a period of time, typically three to four years, as the founder or founders “earn” 
the stock. Not only does vesting keep employees motivated and engaged, but it 
also solves a host of potential problems that can result if employees are given 
their stock all at once. More on the concept of vesting ownership in company 
stock is provided in the “Savvy Entrepreneurial Firm” feature.
avoiding legal disputes
Most legal disputes are the result of misunderstandings, sloppiness, or a

early in the life of a new business to establish practices and procedures to help 
avoid legal disputes. Legal snafus, particularly if they are coupled with man-
agement mistakes, can be extremely damaging to a new firm.
There are several steps entrepreneurs can take to avoid legal disputes and 
complications, as discussed next.
Meet all Contractual Obligations  It is important to meet all contractual 
obligations on time. This includes paying vendors, contractors, and employees 
as agreed and delivering goods or services as promised. If an obligation cannot 
be met on time, the problem should be communicated to the affected parties as 
soon as possible. It is irritating for vendors, for example, when they are not paid 
on time; largely because of the other problems the lack of prompt payments cre-
ates. The following comments dealing with construction companies demonstrate 
this situation: “Not getting paid on time can be devastating to construction 
companies that have costs to (their) vendors and employees that sometimes re-
quire payment weekly. Cash flow problems can send a company into a hole from 
which they will often not recover.”12 Being forthright with vendors or creditors 
I
f you’re not familiar with vesting, the idea is that when a 
firm is launched, instead of issuing stock outright to the 
founders, the stock is distributed over a period of time, 
typically three to four years, as the founder or founders 
“earn” the stock. The same goes for employees who join 
the firm later and receive company stock. Instead of giv-
ing someone stock all at once, the stock is distributed 
over a period of time.
The reason vesting is a smart move is that although 
everyone is normally healthy and on the same page when 
launching an entrepreneurial venture, you never know 
what might happen. You want everyone involved with the 
firm to stay engaged. You also want a way of determining 
the price of a departing employee’s stock, if the firm has 
a “buyback” clause in its corporate bylaws and wants 
to repurchase a departing employee’s shares. vesting 
provides a mechanism for accomplishing both of these 
objectives. A typical start-up’s vesting schedule lasts 36 
to 48 months and includes a 12-month cliff. The cliff rep-
resents the period of time that the person must work for 
the company in order to leave with any ownership inter-
est. Thus, if a company has a 48-month vesting schedule 
and offers 1,000 shares of stock to an employee, if the 
employee leaves after 10 months, the employee keeps 
no equity. If the employee leaves after 28 months, the 
employee gets to keep 28/48 of the equity promised, or 
583 of the 1,000 shares. The shares will be issued at a 
specific price. If an employee leaves and the company 
is entitled to buy back the employee’s shares, normally 
the buyback clause will stipulate that the shares can be 
repurchased at the price at which they were issued.
vesting avoids three problems. First, it helps keep 
employees motivated and engaged. If the employee in the 
example mentioned in the previous paragraph received 
his or her entire allotment of 1,000 shares on day one, the 
employee could walk away from the firm at any point and 
keep all the shares. Second, if an employee’s departure is 
acrimonious, there isn’t any squabbling about how many 
shares the employee will leave with—the answer to this 
question is spelled out in the vesting schedule. In addi-
tion, if a buyback clause is in place and it stipulates the 
formula for determining the value of the departing em-
ployee’s stock, the company can repurchase the shares 
without an argument. It’s never a good thing to have a 
former employee, particularly one that left under less 
than ideal conditions, remain a partial owner of the firm. 
Finally, investors are generally reluctant to invest in a firm 
if a block of stock is owned by a former employee. It just 
spells trouble, which investors are eager to avoid.
Questions for Critical Thinking
 1. Investors are often criticized for insisting that a vest-
ing schedule be put in place for stock that’s issued to 
employees. After reading this feature, do you think this 
criticism is justified? If a company anticipated that it will 
never take money from an investor, is it still a good idea 
to establish a vesting schedule? explain your answer.
 2. Why do you think start-ups launch and distribute stock 
to founders and others members of their new-venture 
team without vesting schedules?
 3. Is it typically necessary to hire an attorney to set up 
a vesting schedule for a firm, or can the firm do it on 
its own?
 4. If a company started with a single founder and no 
 employees, is it necessary to set up a vesting schedule 
for the founder?

if an obligation cannot be met and providing the affected party or parties a re-
alistic plan for repaying the money is an appropriate path to take and tends to 
maintain productive relationships between suppliers and vendors.
avoid undercapitalization  If a new business is starved for money, it is 
much more likely to experience financial problems that will lead to litigation.13 
A new business should raise the money it needs to effectively conduct busi-
ness or should stem its growth to conserve cash. Many entrepreneurs face a 
dilemma regarding this issue. Most entrepreneurs have a goal of retaining as 
much of the equity in their firms as possible, but equity must often be shared 
with investors to obtain sufficient investment capital to support the firm’s 
growth. This issue is discussed in more detail in Chapter 10.
get everything in Writing  Many business disputes arise because of the 
lack of a written agreement or because poorly prepared written agreements 
do not anticipate potential areas of dispute.14 Although it is tempting to try to 
show business partners or employees that they are “trusted” by downplaying 
the need for a written agreement, this approach is usually a mistake. Disputes 
are much easier to resolve if the rights and obligations of the parties involved 
are in writing. For example, what if a new business agreed to pay a Web design 
firm $5,000 to design its website? The new business should know what it’s 
getting for its money, and the Web design firm should know when the project 
is due and when it will receive payment for its services. In this case, a dispute 
could easily arise if the parties simply shook hands on the deal and the Web 
design firm promised to have a “good-looking website” done “as soon as pos-
sible.” The two parties could easily later disagree over the quality and function-
ality of the finished website and the project’s completion date.
The experiences and perspectives of Maxine Clark, the founder of Build-A-
Bear Workshop, provide a solid illustration of the practical benefits of putting 
things in writing, even when dealing with a trusted partner:
While I prefer only the necessary contracts (and certainly as few pages as possible), 
once you find a good partner you can trust, written up-front agreements are often 
One of the simplest 
ways to avoid misunder-
standings and ultimately 
legal disputes is to get 
everything in writing.

a clean way to be sure all discussed terms are acceptable to all parties. It’s also a 
good idea after a meeting to be sure someone records the facts and agree-to points, 
and distributes them to all participants in writing. E-mail is a good method for do-
ing this. Steps like this will make your life easier. After all, the bigger a business 
gets, the harder it is to remember all details about every vendor, contract, and 
meeting. Written records give you good notes for doing follow-up, too.15
There are also two important written agreements that the majority of firms 
ask their employees to sign. A nondisclosure agreement binds an employee 
or another party (such as a supplier) to not disclose a company’s trade secrets. 
A noncompete agreement prevents an individual from competing against a 
former employer for a specific period of time. A sample nondisclosure and non-
compete agreement is shown in Figure 7.2.
Set Standards  Organizations should also set standards that govern employ-
ees’ behavior beyond what can be expressed via a code of conduct. For example, 
four of the most common ethical problem areas that occur in an organization 
are human resource ethical problems, conflicts of interest, customer confi-
dence, and inappropriate use of corporate resources. Policies and procedures 
should be established to deal with these issues. In addition, as reflected in the 
“Partnering for Success” boxed features throughout this book, firms are in-
creasingly partnering with others to achieve their objectives. Because of this, 
entrepreneurial ventures should be vigilant when selecting their alliance part-
ners. A firm falls short in terms of establishing high ethical standards if it is 
willing to partner with firms that behave in a contrary manner. This chapter’s 
“Partnering for Success” feature illustrates how two firms, Patagonia and Build-
A-Bear Workshop, deal with this issue.
When legal disputes do occur, they can often be settled through nego-
tiation or mediation, rather than more expensive and potentially damaging 
litigation. Mediation is a process in which an impartial third party (usually a 
professional mediator) helps those involved in a dispute reach an agreement.

At times, legal disputes can also be avoided by a simple apology and a sin-
cere pledge on the part of the offending party to make amends. Yale profes-
sor Constance E. Bagley illustrates this point.16 Specifically, in regard to the 
role a simple apology plays in resolving legal disputes, Professor Bagley refers 
to a Wall Street Journal article in which the writer commented about a jury 
this point, Maxine Clark, the company’s founder, said, 
“The most successful corporate partnerships are forged 
between like-minded companies with similar cultures 
that have come together for a common goal, where both 
sides benefit from the relationship.”
Also similar to Patagonia, Build-A-Bear thinks of its 
partners as good friends. Reflecting on her experiences in 
this area, Clark said, “I tend to think of partners as good 
business friends—companies and people who would do 
everything they could to help us succeed and for whom 
I would do the same.” In a book she wrote about found-
ing and building Build-A-Bear into a successful company, 
Clark attributes having good partners to careful selection. 
She also likens business partnership to a marriage, which 
has many benefits but also takes hard work: “Good busi-
ness partnerships are like successful marriages. To work, 
they require compatibility, trust and cooperation. Both 
parties need to be invested in one another’s well-being 
and strive for a common goal.”
Both Patagonia and Build-A-Bear make extensive 
use of partnerships and are leaders in their respective 
industries.
Questions for Critical Thinking
 1. To what extent do you believe that Patagonia and 
Build-A-Bear Workshop’s ethical cultures drive their 
views on partnering?
 2. Assume you were assigned the task of writing a code 
of conduct for Patagonia. Write the portion of the 
code of conduct that deals with business partnership 
relationships.
 3. What similarities do you see between the partnership 
philosophies of Patagonia and Build-A-Bear Workshop?
 4. Spend some time studying Patagonia by looking at 
the company’s website and its Facebook page, and 
via other Internet searches. Describe Patagonia’s gen-
eral approach to business ethics, social responsibility, 
and environmental concerns. What, if anything, can 
start-ups learn from Patagonia’s philosophies and its 
experiences?

patagonia
Patagonia sells rugged clothing and gear to mountain 
climbers, skiers, and other extreme-sport enthusiasts. 
The company is also well known for its environmental 
stands and its commitment to product quality. Patagonia 
has never owned a fabric mill or a sewing shop. Instead, 
to make a ski jacket, for example, it buys fabric from a 
mill, and zippers and facings from other manufacturers, 
and then hires a sewing shop to complete the garment. 
To meet its own environmental standards and ensure 
product quality, it works closely with each partner to 
make sure the jacket meets its rigid standards.
As a result of these standards, Patagonia does as 
much business as it can with as few partners as possible 
and chooses its relationships carefully. The first thing the 
company looks for in a partner is the quality of its work. 
It doesn’t look for the lowest-cost provider, who might 
sew one day for a warehouse store such as Costco and 
try to sew the next day for Patagonia. Contractors that 
sew on the lowest-cost basis, the company reasons, 
wouldn’t hire sewing operators of the skill required or 
welcome Patagonia’s oversight of its working conditions 
and environmental standards. What Patagonia looks for, 
more than anything, is a good fit between itself and the 
companies it partners with. It sees its partners as an 
extension of its own business, and wants partners that 
convey Patagonia’s own sense of product quality, busi-
ness ethics, and environmental and social concern.
Once a relationship is established, Patagonia doesn’t 
leave adherence to its principles to chance. Its produc-
tion department monitors its partners on a consistent 
basis. The objective is for both sides to prosper and win. 
In fact, in describing the company’s relationship with its 
partners, Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard says, “We 
become like friends, family—mutually selfish business 
partners; what’s good for them is good for us.”
build-a-bear Workshop
A similar set of beliefs and actions describe Build-A-Bear 
Workshop. Build-A-Bear lets its customers, who are usu-
ally children, design and build their own stuffed animals, 
in a sort of Santa’s workshop setting. Like Patagonia, 
Build-A-Bear is a very socially conscious organization, 
and looks for partners that reflect its values. Affirming

awarding $2.7 million to a woman who spilled scalding hot McDonald’s cof-
fee on her lap. The Wall Street Journal writer noted that “A jury awarded $2.7 
million to a woman who spilled scalding hot McDonald’s coffee on her lap. 
Although this case is often cited as an example of a tort (legal) system run 
amok, the Wall Street Journal faulted McDonald’s for not only failing to re-
spond to prior scalding incidents but also for mishandling the injured woman’s 
complaints by not apologizing.”17
A final issue important in promoting business ethics involves the man-
ner in which entrepreneurs and managers demonstrate accountability to their 
investors and shareholders. This issue, which we discuss in greater detail in 
Chapter 10, is particularly important in light of the corporate scandals observed 
during the early 2000s, as well as scandals that may surface in future years.
Obtaining business licenses and permits
Many businesses require licenses and permits to operate. Depending on the na-
ture of the business, licenses and permits may be required at the federal, state, 
and/or local levels. There are three ways for those leading a business to deter-
mine the licenses and permits that are necessary. The first is to ask someone 
who is running a similar business, and they will usually be able to point you in 
the right direction. The second is to contact the secretary of state’s office in the 
state where the business will be launched. In most cases, they’ll be able to help 
you identify the federal, state, and local licenses that you’ll need. The third is to 
use one of the search tools available online. An example is the SBA’s Permit Me 
search tool, available at www.sba.gov/licenses-and-permits. This very useful 
search tool allows you to search by zip code and type of business for the licenses 
and permits that are needed to open a particular business.
The number-one rule is that if you’re uncertain, ask. Severe penalties can 
be levied if you start running a business without the proper licenses in place. 
The following is an overview of the licenses and permits that are required in the 
United States at the federal, state, and local levels for business organizations.
Federal licenses and Permits
Most businesses do not require a federal license to operate, although some do. 
Table 7.5 contains a partial list of the business activities that require a federal li-
cense or permit, along with the federal agency to contact and its website address. 
Seemingly simple businesses sometimes require more licenses and permits than 
one might think. For example, if you prepare tax returns for others you are re-
quired by the IRS to register and obtain a tax preparer tax identification number 
(PTIN). Similarly, if you make beer that is sold, you’ll need a federal permit and 
a state liquor license. You do not need a federal permit or a state liquor license if 
you make beer strictly for personal consumption.
state licenses and Permits
In most states, there are three different categories of licenses and permits that 
you may need to operate a business. Most states have start-up guides that 
walk you through the steps of setting up a business in the state. For example, 
the guide for starting a business in Oregon, called the Startup Toolkit, is avail-
able at www.oregon.gov/business/Pages/toolkit.aspx. It provides step-by-step 
instructions for starting a business in Oregon.
business registration requirements  Some states require all new busi-
nesses to register with the state. For example, the State of Oklahoma requires 
new businesses to complete a document titled “Oklahoma Business Registration

Application” prior to commencing business. The purpose of the document is to 
(1) register the business, (2) place the business on the radar screen of the tax 
authorities, and (3) make sure the business is aware of and complies with cer-
tain regulations, such as the need to withhold state and federal taxes from the 
paychecks of employees. The best way to determine if your state has a similar 
document is to ask a business owner or contact your secretary of state’s office.
Sales Tax Permits  Most states and communities require businesses that 
sell goods, and in some cases services, to collect sales tax and submit the 
tax to the proper state authorities. If you’re obligated to collect sales tax, you 
must get a permit from your state. Most states have online portals that make 
it easy to obtain a sales tax permit. For example, if you are opening a business 
in Texas, you can obtain your Texas Sales Tax Permit at www.window.state.
tx.us/taxpermit/.
Professional and Occupational licenses and Permits  In all states, 
there are laws that require people in certain professions to pass a state ex-
amination and maintain a professional license to conduct business. Examples 
include barbers, chiropractors, nurses, tattoo artists, land surveyors, and real 
estate agents. There are also certain businesses that require a state occupa-
tional license or permit to operate. Examples include plumbers, daycare cen-
ters, trucking companies, and insurance agencies.
local licenses and Permits
On the local level, there are two categories of licenses and permits that may be 
needed.
The first is a permit to operate a certain type of business. Examples include 
child care, barber shops and salons, automotive repair, and hotels and motels. 
Many cities have quirky requirements, so it’s important to check, prior to launch-
ing a business, if a specific permit is required. For example, in Atlanta you need 
a permit to operate a business that involves billiard or pool rooms. In Baltimore, 
you need a permit to operate a dance academy.

The second category is permits for engaging in certain types of activities. 
Examples include the following:
■ Building permit: Typically required if you are constructing or modifying 
your place of business
■ Health permit: Normally required if you are involved in preparing or 
 selling food
■ Signage permit: May be required to erect a sign
■ Street vendor permit: May be required for anyone wanting to sell food 
products or merchandise on a city street
■ Sidewalk café permit: May be required if tables and chairs are placed in 
a city right-of-way
■ Alarm permit: Sometimes required if you have installed a burglar or 
fire alarm
■ Fire permit: May be required if a business sells or stores highly flammable 
material or handles hazardous substances
In addition to obtaining the proper licenses and permits, if you plan to use a 
fictitious name for your business, you’ll need to obtain a fictitious business 
name permit (also called dba or doing business as). A fictitious business 
name permit allows a business to legally operate under a fictitious name, like 
Gold Coast Sea Food or Red Rock Bakery. Selecting a name for a business and 
obtaining a fictitious business name permit if needed is an important task, not 
only to comply with the law but because a business’s name is a critical part of 
its identity and its branding strategy. It’s also one of the first things that people 
associate with a business. Appendix 7.1 contains a set of guidelines and sug-
gestions for picking a business’s name. As illustrated in the appendix, it is im-
portant that a business choose a name that facilitates rather than hinders how 
it wants to differentiate itself in the marketplace.
Finally, all businesses, other than sole proprietorships that do not have 
employees, are required to obtain a Federal Employee Identification Number 
(normally called the Employer Identification Number or EIN). The easiest and 
quickest way to obtain an EIN is to go to www.irs.com and click on Apply for an 
EIN Online. A business’s EIN is similar to an individual’s social security num-
ber. It is used by the IRS to track the business for tax compliance purposes.
choosing a Form of business Organization
When a business is launched, a form of legal entity must be chosen. Sole 
proprietorships, partnerships, corporations, and limited liability companies 
are the most common legal entities from which entrepreneurs make a choice. 
Choosing a legal entity is not a one-time event. As a business grows and ma-
tures, it is necessary to periodically review whether the current form of busi-
ness organization remains appropriate.
There is no single form of business organization that works best in all 
situations. It’s up to the owners of a firm and their attorney to select the legal 
entity that best meets their needs. The decision typically hinges on several fac-
tors, which are shown in Figure 7.3. It is important to be careful in selecting a 
legal entity for a new firm because each form of business organization involves 
trade-offs among these factors and because an entrepreneur wants to be sure 
to achieve the founders’ specific objectives.
This section describes the four forms of business organization and dis-
cusses the advantages and disadvantages of each. A comparison of the four 
legal entities, based on the factors that are typically the most important in 
making a selection, is provided in Table 7.6.

Factors Critical in Selecting a Form of Business Organization
sole Proprietorship
The simplest form of business entity is the sole proprietorship. A sole pro-
prietorship is a form of business organization involving one person, and the 
person and the business are essentially the same. Sole proprietorships are the 
most prevalent form of business organization. The two most important advan-
tages of a sole proprietorship are that the owner maintains complete control 
over the business and that business losses can be deducted against the own-
er’s personal tax return.18
Setting up a sole proprietorship is cheap and relatively easy compared to 
the other forms of business ownership. The only legal requirement, in most 
states, is to obtain the appropriate license and permits to do business, as de-
scribed in the previous section of the chapter.
If the business will be operated under a trade name (e.g., West Coast 
Graphic Design) instead of the name of the owner (e.g., Sam Ryan), the owner 
will have to file an assumed or fictitious name certificate with the appropriate 
local government agency, as mentioned earlier. This step is required to ensure 
that there is only one business in an area using the same name and provides a 
public record of the owner’s name and contact information.
A sole proprietorship is not a separate legal entity. For tax purposes, 
the profit or loss of the business flows through to the owner’s personal tax 
return document and the business ends at the owner’s death or loss of in-
terest in the business. The sole proprietor is responsible for all the liabilities 
of the business, and this is a significant drawback. If a sole proprietor’s 
business is sued, the owner could theoretically lose all the business’s assets 
along with personal assets. The liquidity of an owner’s investment in a sole 
proprietorship is typically low. Liquidity is the ability to sell a business or 
other asset quickly at a price that is close to its market value.19 It is usu-
ally difficult for a sole proprietorship to raise investment capital because 
the ownership of the business cannot be shared. Unlimited liability and 
difficulty raising investment capital are the primary reasons entrepreneurs 
typically form corporations or limited liability companies as opposed to sole 
proprietorships. Most sole proprietorships are salary-substitute or lifestyle 
firms (as described in Chapter 1) and are typically a poor choice for an ag-
gressive entrepreneurial firm.
To summarize, the primary advantages and disadvantages of a sole propri-
etorship are as follows:
advantages of a Sole Proprietorship  
■ Creating one is easy and inexpensive.
■ The owner maintains complete control of the business and retains all 
the profits.
■ Business losses can be deducted against the sole proprietor’s other 
sources of income.
■ It is not subject to double taxation (explained later).
■ The business is easy to dissolve.

Disadvantages of a Sole Proprietorship  
■ Liability on the owner’s part is unlimited.
■ The business relies on the skills and abilities of a single owner to be 
 successful. Of course, the owner can hire employees who have additional 
skills and abilities.
■ Raising capital can be difficult.
■ The business ends at the owner’s death or loss of interest in the business.
■ The liquidity of the owner’s investment is low.
Partnerships
If two or more people start a business, they must organize as a partnership, 
corporation, or limited liability company. Partnerships are organized as either 
general or limited partnerships.
general Partnerships  A general partnership is a form of business organi-
zation where two or more people pool their skills, abilities, and resources to run 
a business. The primary advantage of a general partnership over a sole propri-
etorship is that the business isn’t dependent on a single person for its survival 
and success. In fact, in most cases, the partners have equal say in how the busi-
ness is run. Most partnerships have a partnership agreement, which is a legal 
document that is similar to a founders’ agreement. A partnership agreement 
details the responsibilities and the ownership shares of the partners involved 
with an organization. The business created by a partnership ends at the death or 
withdrawal of a partner, unless otherwise stated in the partnership agreement. 
General partnerships are typically found in service industries. In many states, a 
general partnership must file a certificate of partnership or similar document as 
evidence of its existence. Similar to a sole proprietorship, the profit or loss of a 
general partnership flows through to the partner’s personal tax returns. If a busi-
ness has four general partners and they all have equal ownership in the busi-
ness, then one-fourth of the profits or losses would flow through to each partner’s 
individual tax return.20 The partnership files an informational tax return only.
The primary disadvantage of a general partnership is that the individual part-
ners are liable for all the partnership’s debts and obligations. If one partner is 
negligent while conducting business on behalf of the partnership, all the partners 
may be liable for damages. Although the non-negligent partners may later try 
to recover their losses from the negligent one, the joint liability of all partners to 
the injured party remains. It is typically easier for a general partnership to raise 
money than a sole proprietorship simply because more than one person is willing 
to assume liability for a loan. One way a general partnership can raise investment 
capital is by adding more partners. Investors are typically reluctant to sign on as 
general partners, however, because of the unlimited liability that follows each one.
In summary, the primary advantages and disadvantages of a general part-
nership are as follows:
advantages of a general Partnership  
■ Creating one is relatively easy and inexpensive compared to a corporation 
or limited liability company.
■ The skills and abilities of more than one individual are available to the firm.
■ Having more than one owner may make it easier to raise funds.
■ Business losses can be deducted against the partners’ other sources of 
income.
■ It is not subject to double taxation (explained later).

Disadvantages of a general Partnership  
■ Liability on the part of each general partner is unlimited.
■ The business relies on the skills and abilities of a fixed number of partners. 
Of course, similar to a sole proprietorship, the partners can hire employees 
who have additional skills and abilities.
■ Raising capital can be difficult.
■ Because decision making among the partners is shared, disagreements 
can occur.
■ The business ends at the death or withdrawal of one partner unless 
 otherwise stated in the partnership agreement.
■ The liquidity of each partner’s investment is low.
limited Partnerships  A limited partnership is a modified form of a 
general partnership. The major difference between the two is that a limited 
partnership includes two classes of owners: general partners and limited 
partners. There are no limits on the number of general or limited partners 
permitted in a limited partnership. Similar to a general partnership, the gen-
eral partners are liable for the debts and obligations of the partnership, but 
the limited partners are liable only up to the amount of their investment. The 
limited partners may not exercise any significant control over the organization 
without jeopardizing their limited liability status.21 Similar to general part-
nerships, most limited partnerships have partnership agreements. A limited 
partnership agreement sets forth the rights and duties of the general and 
limited partners, along with the details of how the partnership will be man-
aged and eventually dissolved.
A limited partnership is usually formed to raise money or to spread out the 
risk of a venture without forming a corporation. Limited partnerships are com-
mon in real estate development, oil and gas exploration, and motion picture 
ventures.22
corporations
A corporation is a separate legal entity organized under the authority of a 
state. Corporations are organized as either C corporations or subchapter S 
corporations. The following description pertains to C corporations, which are 
what most people think of when they hear the word corporation. Subchapter S 
corporations are explained later.
C Corporations  A C corporation is a separate legal entity that, in the eyes 
of the law, is separate from its owners. In most cases, the corporation shields 
its owners, who are called shareholders, from personal liability for the debts 
and obligations of the corporation. A corporation is governed by a board of di-
rectors, which is elected by the shareholders (more about this in Chapter 9). In 
most instances, the board hires officers to oversee the day-to-day management 
of the organization. It is usually easier for a corporation to raise investment 
capital than a sole proprietorship or a partnership because the sharehold-
ers are not liable beyond their investment in the firm. It is also easier to al-
locate partial ownership interests in a corporation through the distribution of 
stock. Most C corporations have two classes of stock: common and preferred. 
Preferred stock is typically issued to conservative investors who have pref-
erential rights over common stockholders in regard to dividends and to the 
assets of the corporation in the event of liquidation. Common stock is issued 
more broadly than preferred stock. The common stockholders have voting 
rights and elect the board of directors of the firm. The common stockholders 

262    PART 3 | MOvInG FROM An IDeA TO An enTRePReneURIAL FIRM
are typically the last to get paid in the event of the liquidation of the corpora-
tion; that is, after the creditors and the preferred stockholders.23
Establishing a corporation is more complicated than a sole proprietorship 
or a partnership. A corporation is formed by filing articles of incorporation 
with the secretary of state’s office in the state of incorporation. The articles of 
incorporation typically include the corporation’s name, purpose, authorized 
number of stock shares, classes of stock, and other conditions of operation.24 
In most states, corporations must file papers annually, and state agencies im-
pose annual fees. It is important that a corporation’s owners fully comply with 
these regulations. If the owners of a corporation don’t file their annual paper-
work, neglect to pay their annual fees, or commit fraud, a court could ignore 
the fact that a corporation has been established and the owners could be held 
personally liable for actions of the corporation. This chain of effects is referred 
to as “piercing the corporate veil.”25
A corporation is taxed as a separate legal entity. In fact, the “C” in the title 
“C corporation” comes from the fact that regular corporations are taxed under 
subchapter C of the Internal Revenue Code. A disadvantage of corporations is 
that they are subject to double taxation, which means that a corporation is 
taxed on its net income and, when the same income is distributed to share-
holders in the form of dividends, is taxed again on shareholders’ personal in-
come tax returns. This complication is one of the reasons that entrepreneurial 
firms often retain their earnings rather than paying dividends to their share-
holders. The firm can use the earnings to fuel future growth and at the same 
time avoid double taxation. The hope is that the shareholders will ultimately 
be rewarded by an appreciation in the value of the company’s stock.
The ease of transferring stock is another advantage of corporations. It is 
often difficult for a sole proprietor to sell a business and even more awkward 
for a partner to sell a partial interest in a general partnership. If a corporation 
is listed on a major stock exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange 
or the NASDAQ, an owner can sell shares at almost a moment’s notice. This 
advantage of incorporating, however, does not extend to corporations that are 
not listed on a major stock exchange. There are approximately 2,800 compa-
nies listed on the New York Stock Exchange (with a market capitalization of 
approximately $18 trillion dollars) and 3,100 on the NASDAQ. These firms 
are public corporations. The stockholders of these 5,900 companies enjoy a 
liquid market for their stock, meaning that the stock can be bought and sold 
fairly easily through an organized marketplace. It is much more difficult to sell 
stock in closely held or private corporations. In a closely held corporation, 
the voting stock is held by a small number of individuals and is very thinly or 
infrequently traded.26 A private corporation is one in which all the shares 
are held by a few shareholders, such as management or family members, and 
are not publicly traded.27 The vast majority of the corporations in the United 
States are private corporations. The stock in both closely held and private cor-
porations is fairly illiquid, meaning that it typically isn’t easy to find a buyer 
for the stock.
A final advantage of organizing as a C corporation is the ability to share 
stock with employees as part of an employee incentive plan. Because it’s easy to 
distribute stock in small amounts, many corporations, both public and private, 
distribute stock as part of their employee bonus or profit-sharing plans. Such in-
centive plans are intended to help firms attract, motivate, and retain high-quality 
employees.28 Stock options are a special form of incentive compensation. These 
plans provide employees the option or right to buy a certain number of shares 
of their company’s stock at a stated price over a certain period of time. The most 
compelling advantage of stock options is the potential rewards to participants 
when (and if) the stock price increases.29 Many employees receive stock options 
at the time they are hired and then periodically receive additional options. As 
employees accumulate stock options, the link between their potential reward 

CHAPTeR 7 | PRePARInG THe PROPeR Ethical and lEgal FOUnDATIOn    263
and their company’s stock price becomes increasingly clear. This link provides a 
powerful inducement for employees to exert extra effort on behalf of their firm in 
hopes of positively affecting the stock price.30
To summarize, the advantages and disadvantages of a C corporation are 
as follows:
advantages of a C Corporation  
■ Owners are liable only for the debts and obligations of the corporation up 
to the amount of their investment.
■ The mechanics of raising capital is easier.
■ No restrictions exist on the number of shareholders, which differs from 
subchapter S corporations.
■ Stock is liquid if traded on a major stock exchange.
■ The ability to share stock with employees through stock option or other 
incentive plans can be a powerful form of employee motivation.
Disadvantages of a C Corporation  
■ Setting up and maintaining one is more difficult than for a sole proprietor-
ship or a partnership.
■ Business losses cannot be deducted against the shareholders’ other 
sources of income.
■ Income is subject to double taxation, meaning that it is taxed at the 
 corporate and the shareholder levels.
■ Small shareholders typically have little voice in the management of the firm.
Subchapter S Corporation  A subchapter S corporation combines the 
advantages of a partnership and a C corporation. It is similar to a partner-
ship in that the profits and losses of the business are not subject to double 
taxation. The subchapter S corporation does not pay taxes; instead, the prof-
its or losses of the business are passed through to the individual tax returns 
of the owners. The S corporation must file an information tax return. An S 
corporation is similar to a C corporation in that the owners are not subject 
to personal liability for the behavior of the business. An additional advantage 
of the subchapter S corporation pertains to self-employment tax. By elect-
ing the subchapter S corporate status, only the earnings actually paid out 
as salary are subject to payroll taxes. The ordinary income that is disbursed 
by the business to the shareholders is not subject to payroll taxes or self-
employment tax.
Because of these advantages, many entrepreneurial firms start as sub-
chapter S corporations. There are strict standards that a business must meet 
to qualify for status as a subchapter S corporation:
■ The business cannot be a subsidiary of another corporation.
■ The shareholders must be U.S. citizens. Partnerships and C corporations 
may not own shares in a subchapter S corporation. Certain types of trusts 
and estates are eligible to own shares in a subchapter S corporation.
■ It can have only one class of stock issued and outstanding (either pre-
ferred stock or common stock).
■ It can have no more than 100 members. Husbands and wives count as 
one member, even if they own separate shares of stock. In some instances, 
family members count as one member.
■ All shareholders must agree to have the corporation formed as a subchap-
ter S corporation.

264    PART 3 | MOvInG FROM An IDeA TO An enTRePReneURIAL FIRM
The primary disadvantages of a subchapter S corporation are restrictions 
in qualifying, expenses involved with setting up and maintaining the sub-
chapter S status, and the fact that a subchapter S corporation is limited to 100 
shareholders.31 If a subchapter S corporation wants to include more than 100 
shareholders, it must convert to a C corporation or a limited liability company.
limited liability company
The limited liability company (LLC) is a form of business organization that 
is rapidly gaining popularity in the United States. The concept originated in 
Germany and was first introduced in the United States in the state of Wyoming 
in 1978. Along with the subchapter S corporation, it is a popular choice for 
start-up firms. As with partnerships and corporations, the profits of an LLC 
flow through to the tax returns of the owners and are not subject to double 
taxation. The main advantage of the LLC is that all partners enjoy limited 
liability. This differs from regular and limited partnerships, where at least 
one partner is liable for the debts of the partnership. The LLC combines the 
limited liability advantage of the corporation with the tax advantages of the 
partnership.32
Some of the terminology used for an LLC differs from the other forms 
of business ownership. For example, the shareholders of an LLC are called 
“members,” and instead of owning stock, the members have “interests.” The 
LLC is more flexible than a subchapter S corporation in terms of number of 
owners and tax-related issues. An LLC must be a private business—it cannot 
be publicly traded. If at some point the members want to take the business 
public and be listed on one of the major stock exchanges, it must be converted 
to a C corporation.
The LLC is rather complex to set up and maintain, and in some states the 
rules governing the LLC vary. Members may elect to manage the LLC themselves 
or may designate one or more managers (who may or may not be members)

to run the business on a day-to-day basis. The profits and losses of the busi-
ness may be allocated to the members anyway they choose. For example, if two 
people owned an LLC, they could split the yearly profits 50–50, 75–25, 90–10, or 
any other way they choose.33
In summary, the advantages and disadvantages of an LLC are as follows:
advantages of a limited liability Company  
■ Members are liable for the debts and obligations of the business only up to 
the amount of their investment.
■ The number of shareholders is unlimited.
■ An LLC can elect to be taxed as a sole proprietor, partnership, S corporation, 
or corporation, providing much flexibility.
■ Because profits are taxed only at the shareholder level, there is no double 
taxation.
Disadvantages of a limited liability Company  
■ Setting up and maintaining one is more difficult and expensive.
■ Tax accounting can be complicated.
■ Some of the regulations governing LLCs vary by state.
■ Because LLCs are a relatively new type of business entity, there is not as 
much legal precedent available for owners to anticipate how legal disputes 
might affect their businesses.
■ Some states levy a franchise tax on LLCs—which is essentially a fee the 
LLC pays the state for the benefit of limited liability.

lemmas when they occur.
 lO2. We show the criteria that are important 
for selecting an attorney for a new firm in 
Table 7.3. Critical issues include select-
ing an attorney familiar with the start-up 
process, selecting an attorney who can 
assist you in raising money, and mak-
ing certain that the attorney has a track 
record of completing work on time. It 
is important to ensure that a venture’s 
founders agree on their relative interests 
in the venture and their commitment to 
its future. A founders’ (or shareholders’) 
agreement is a written document dealing 
with issues such as the split of equity be-
tween or among the founders of the firm, 
how individual founders will be compen-
sated for the cash or the “sweat equity” 
they put into the firm, and how long the 
founders will have to stay with the firm for 
their shares to fully vest. Suggestions for 
 lO1. Establishing a strong ethical culture in 
their firms is the single most important 
thing the founders of an entrepreneurial 
venture can do. Three important ways to do 
this are (1) lead by example, (2) establish a 
code of conduct (also known as a code of 
ethics), and (3) implement an ethics train-
ing program. In the context of “leading by 
example,” three keys to building a strong 
ethical culture in a firm are (1) having lead-
ers who intentionally make ethics a part 
of their daily conversations and decision 
making, (2) supervisors who emphasize in-
tegrity when working with their direct re-
ports, and (3) peers who encourage each 
other to act ethically. A code of conduct and 
an ethics training program are two tech-
niques entrepreneurs use to promote high 
standards of business ethics in their firms. 
A code of conduct describes the general 
value system, moral principles, and specific 
ethical rules that govern a firm. An ethics 
training program provides employees with 

266    PART 3 | MOvInG FROM An IDeA TO An enTRePReneURIAL FIRM
to operate. Along with obtaining the ap-
propriate licenses, some businesses may 
need to obtain one or more permits.
 lO4. The major differences among sole propri-
etorships, partnerships, corporations, and 
limited liability companies are shown in 
Table 7.6. These forms of business organiza-
tion differ in terms of the number of owners 
allowed, cost of setting up and maintaining, 
personal liability of owners, continuity of 
the business, methods of taxation, degree of 
management control, ease of raising capital, 
and ease of liquidating investments. Fast-
growth firms tend to organize as corpora-
tions or limited liability companies for two 
main reasons: to shield the owners from 
personal liability for the behavior of the firm 
and to make it easier to raise capital.
how new firms can avoid litigation include 
meeting all contractual obligations, avoid-
ing undercapitalization, getting everything 
in writing, and promoting business ethics 
in the firm. A nondisclosure agreement 
is a promise made by an employee or 
another party (such as a supplier) not to 
disclose a company’s trade secrets. A non-
compete agreement prevents an individual 
from competing against a former employer 
for a specific period of time.
 lO3. Before a business is launched, a num-
ber of licenses and permits are typically 
needed. The required licenses and permits 
vary by city, county, and state, as well as 
by type of business, so it’s important to 
study local regulations carefully. In most 
communities, a business needs a license

Business idea: Reduce traffic congestion, air pollution, 
and wear and tear on the nation’s highways by introducing 
an easy-to-use, self-service, bike-for-hire system.
Pitch: Traffic congestion is stressful; it causes air 
pollution and costs millions in tax revenue to keep 
roads in good repair. now one company is encouraging 
people to give up their cars in favor of pedal power. 
velib, located in Paris, France, is pioneering the concept 
of a public bicycle rental program. On July 15, 2007, 
10,000 bicycles were introduced to the city, along with 
750 automated rental stations, which hold 15 bicycles 
each. Customers pay a deposit of $200 for an unlimited 
number of rentals and are then given a charge card, 
which also detaches the bikes from the cycle racks. The 
rental is $1.80, for unlimited access for 24 hours a day, 
or $8.50 for a seven-day pass. The bike does not need 
to be returned to the same pick-up point. Customers 
can pick up one of the distinctive gray bicycles from a 
rack near the eiffel Tower, cycle to the Pantheon, and 
leave it at the nearest velib stand there. Twenty trucks 
are used each night to redistribute the machines to 
high-demand stations. 
Theft is kept to a minimum by the heavy design of the 
bikes. The parking facilities are also secure, and the credit 
card deposit system deters users from “forgetting” to 
return the bikes, because fines can be collected directly 
from the card. The service is primarily aimed at people 
who are making short journeys. each bicycle is used on 
average 30 times a day, and the average trip time is just 
18 minutes. To date, nearly 200 million journeys have 
been made with an average of 90,000 per day. visitors to 
the city can take out short-term subscriptions by simply 
using their credit cards directly at the cycle rack terminals.
The service is financed by family-controlled advertising 
company JCDecaux that provides the bikes in return for 
an exclusive contract to sell outdoor advertising in prime 
locations around Paris. JCDecaux paid start-up costs 
of around $115 million. The Paris City Council pays the 
$500 replacement cycle costs estimated at around $2 
million per year.
Since the launch, the number of bicycles available for hire 
has doubled to 20,000, and the number of rental stations 
has increased to 1,800. City officials say traffic has been 
reduced by 5 percent in the French capital.

Business idea: Create an online pharmacy that is easier 
to navigate than traditional pharmacies by (1) syncing all 
prescriptions so they can be refilled at the same time, 
(2) delivering exactly what each customer is required to 
take for the next two weeks by mail, and (3) sorting each 
customer’s medications into a chain of small plastic 
envelopes that contain the exact medications that a 
customer needs to take labeled by˚ day and time of day.
Pitch: Approximately 10.6 percent of the American popu–
lation, or 30 million people, take five or more prescription 
drugs per day. Many people in this category visit their 
pharmacy multiple times per month because their 
prescriptions aren’t synced. Once they get home, they 
have to sort their medications into daily doses. This task 
can be difficult for elderly patients, who may be taking 
different meds at different times of the day. It’s also hard 
for people who have hands that shake or poor eyesight, 
and find it difficult to sort medications into pill boxes.
PillPack, which is an online pharmacy, has developed a 
system that provides a solution to these problems. First,

the company syncs all of its customers’ prescriptions 
so they can be refilled at the same time. Second, the 
prescriptions are delivered by mail every two weeks in a 
small, discreet, tamper-evident box. Third, inside the box 
is a recyclable plastic dispenser—a PillPack—with a large 
decal on the side displaying images and descriptions of 
each of the medications inside. Rolled inside each PillPack 
is chain of small plastic envelopes, each of which holds 
the specific prescriptions, over-the-counter medications, 
and vitamins that a customer is supposed to take, labeled 
by day and time of day. each envelope can easily be torn 
from the chain. no more sorting. no more pill boxes. no 
more waiting in line at the pharmacy. PillPack applied de-
sign thinking principles to make the ordering and taking of 
medications as simple and error-free as possible.
PillPack’s target market is individuals who take five or 
more prescription drugs a day. It was conceived by J. 
Parker, who grew up working in his father’s family-owned 
pharmacy. He often delivered medications to his father’s 
customers, and the sight of customers with piles of pill 
bottles and computer spreadsheets taped to refrigerator 
doors (to help them sort and remember to take their 
medications on time) convinced him there had to be a 
better way. After graduating from the Massachusetts 
College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences in 2012, 
Parker started the process of creating PillPack.
PillPack, which launched in early 2014, is a full-service 
pharmacy available in 34 states. It charges $20 per 
month for its service, and its prices for prescription med-
ications are on-par with traditional pharmacies. Once 
enrolled, PillPack handles all the logistics for its custom-
ers, including transferring their medications, confirming 
the medications and start date, shipping the medications 
right to their door, and contacting their doctor for refills.

introduction
Jack Peterson and Sarah Jones are planning to start a 
business. Their plan is to locate and operate 10 kiosks 
in malls and other high-traffic areas to sell accessories 
for Apple iPhones, iPads, and iPods. To complement 
their accessory sales, the two have created a series of 
short videos that help users learn how to make better 
use of their iPhones, iPads, and iPods. The videos will 
be available on Jack and Sarah’s website for a one-
time fee of $5.99 or on an app they are developing for 
a $5.99 one-time download fee. Both the website and 
the mobile app will include promotions to buy additional 
iPhone, iPad, and iPod accessories via Jack and Sarah’s 
kiosks or through their online store.
iUser Accessories is the tentative name for the 
business. Jack and Sarah like to use the word tentative 
because they aren’t completely sold on the name. The 
Internet domain name, www.iuseraccessories.com, was 
available, so they registered it on GoDaddy.com. Part 
of their start-up funding will be used to hire a trademark 
attorney to do a formal trademark search before they 
use the name or do any advertising.
Jack and Sarah met in an introduction to entre-
preneurship course at their local university. They hit it 
off while working on the initial business plan for iUser 
Accessories, which they completed as an assignment 
for the class. Their senior year, they refined the plan 
by working on it during a business planning class. 
They took first place in a university-wide business plan 
competition just before graduation. The win netted 
them $10,000 in cash and $10,000 in “in-kind” services 
for the business. Their plan was to use the money to 
establish a relationship with an accountant affiliated 
with the university.
Feasibility analysis and Business Plan
As part of their business plan, Jack and Sarah 
completed a product feasibility analysis for iUser 
Accessories. They first developed a concept statement 
and distributed it to a total of 20 people, including pro-
fessors; electronic store owners; iPhone, iPad, and iPod 
users; and the parents of young iPhone, iPad, and iPod 
users. The responses were both positive and instructive. 
The idea to distribute videos dealing with how to bet-
ter use your iPhone, iPad, and iPod via streaming video 
over the Internet or via the mobile app came directly 
from one of the concept-statement participants. Jack 
and Sarah’s original idea was to distribute this material 
in a more conventional manner. The person who came 
up with the idea wrote on the bottom of the concept 
statement, “not only will this approach save you money 
(by not having to distribute actual DvDs) but it will drive

traffic to your website and your app and provide you 
with additional e-commerce opportunities.”
Following the concept statement, Jack and Sarah 
surveyed 410 people in their target market, which is 
15- to 35-year-olds. They did this by approaching 
people wherever they could and politely asking them 
to complete the survey. They persuaded one of their 
marketing professors to help them with the survey’s 
design, to make sure it generalized to a larger popula-
tion. They learned that 58 percent of the people in their 
target market own an iPod or iPhone or plan to buy 
one soon. The survey also listed a total of 36 iPhone, 
iPad, and iPod accessories, which are available through 
vendors to which Jack and Sarah have access. The 
results affirmed Jack and Sarah’s notion that the vast 
majority of people in their target market don’t realize 
the number of iPhone, iPad, and iPod accessories that 
exist, let alone know where to get them. They also were 
pleased with the high degree of interest expressed by 
the survey participants in learning more about many of 
the accessories.
start-up capital
As part of their business plan, Jack and Sarah com-
pleted one- and three-year pro forma financial state-
ments, which demonstrate the potential viability of 
their business. They have commitments for $66,000 
of funding from friends and family. According to their 
projections, they should be cash-flow positive within 
four months and will not need any additional infusions 
of cash, unless they expand the business beyond the 
scope of their original business plan. The projections 
include salaries of $35,000 per year for both Jack and 
Sarah, who will both work more than 40 hours a week 
manning the kiosks and running the business.
Jack and Sarah are fortunate in that they are able to 
each contribute $3,000 to the business personally and 
were able to gain commitments of $30,000 each from 
their respective groups of friends and family. A year or 
so ago they participated in a class offered by their local 
Small Business Development Center (SBDC) about how 
to start a business and remembered an attorney say-
ing that it’s all right to talk to people about funding prior 
to talking to an attorney, but don’t actually accept any 
money until you have your legal ducks in order. As a re-
sult, other than their own money, Jack and Sarah don’t 
actually have the $66,000 yet. They can accumulate it 
within 30 days once they are confident that the business 
is a go.
Preparing for the meeting with the attorney
Jack and Sarah plan to launch their business on 
September 15, just a couple of months prior to the start 
of the busy Christmas season. They spent some time 
asking around the business school and the technol-
ogy incubator attached to their university to identify the 
name of a good small-business attorney. They identified 
an attorney and made the appointment. The appoint-
ment was scheduled for 2:15 p.m. on July 16 at the at-
torney’s office.
Another takeaway that Jack and Sarah gleaned 
from the SBDC class was to plan carefully the time you 
spend with an attorney, in order to make best use of 
your time and minimize expenses. As a result, prior to 
the meeting, Jack and Sarah planned to spend several 
evenings at a local Barnes & nobel bookstore, looking at 
books that deal with forms of business ownership and 
other legal issues and making a concise list of issues to 
discuss with the attorney. They had also gone over this 
material in preparing their business plan. In the meeting

with the attorney, they want to be as well informed as 
possible and actually lead the discussion and make rec-
ommendations. Sarah’s dad is a real estate agent and 
had dealt with many attorneys during his career. One 
thing he told her, in helping her prepare for this meeting, 
is that attorneys are helpful and necessary but shouldn’t 
make your decisions for you. Sarah shared this insight 
with Jack, and they were both determined to follow that 
advice in their upcoming meeting.
Jack and sarah’s recommendations
To put their list on paper and get started, Jack created a 
document (shown nearby) for the purposing of listing is-
sues they wanted to discuss with the attorney.
Jack and Sarah spent the next several evenings 
completing this list and talking about their business. 
When they made the call to set up the meeting with 
the attorney, the attorney told them that she wasn’t an 
intellectual property lawyer, and if it looked like the busi-
ness was a go after their meeting, she could arrange for 
them to talk to one of her partners who specialized in 
patent and trademark law. As a result, Jack and Sarah 
knew that this meeting would focus more on forms of 
business ownership and general legal issues, and they 
would address their intellectual property questions at 
another meeting.

The day for the meeting arrived, and Jack and Sarah 
met at the attorney’s office at 2:15 p.m. They had e-
mailed the attorney their list of issues along with their 
recommendations a week prior to the meeting. The at-
torney greeted them with a firm handshake and opened 
a file labeled “iUser Accessories, Jack Peterson and 
Sarah Jones.” Seeing their names like that, on an attor-
ney’s file, made it seem like their company was already 
real. The attorney looked at both of them and placed a 
copy of the list they had e-mailed in front of her. The list 
already had a number of handwritten notes on it. The 
attorney smiled and said to Jack and Sarah, “Let’s get 
started.”

introduction
Credibility is a vital part of any start-up’s persona. 
Whether a prospective customer in a for-profit context 
or a prospective donor in a nonprofit context, it’s im-
portant that the company or organization presents itself 
in a manner that builds credibility and trust during first 
encounters. Both consumers and donors have multiple 
options for allocating their money. As a result, it’s es-
sential that a start-up make a favorable first impression 
and give its patrons reasons to trust it.
how companies and organizations Build 
credibility and trust
There are several ways companies and organiza-
tions can build credibility and trust. We present eight 
 techniques that are essential in nearly all cases in the 
following list.
The following are examples of how two 
 organizations—one for-profit and one nonprofit—
are building credibility and trust via these techniques.

nonprofit start-ups build credibility and trust

techniques for engendering credibility, legitimacy, and trust
technique
explanation
1.  Have an attractive logo, corporate 
 e-mail address, and professional  
looking website.
Prospective customers and donors have a mental image of what real 
 companies and organizations looks like. If your logo, website, or e-mail address 
look amateurish or suspect, the game is up. Always have a corporate.com or 
.org e-mail address. A Gmail or Yahoo! e-mail address makes a company or 
 organization look amateurish.
2. Receive media coverage.
Display prominently on your website the media coverage you’ve received. If you’re 
new, start by asking bloggers in your industry to cover you. Media coverage is a 
tacit sign of legitimacy and support.
3. Obtain expert testimonials.
Get expert testimonials and feature them on your website and in your  literature. 
An expert doesn’t have to be someone who is famous. If you’re selling surgery-
related software, ask a surgeon to test it and comment. If you’re starting a 
 nonprofit to provide a place for at-risk kids to hang out after school, ask the 
 local police chief or a school principal to comment on your service.
4. Obtain customer testimonials.
Ask customers, donors, or recipients of the good or service you provide to test 
that good or service and then to comment about their experiences. Include their 
pictures if possible. Positive quotes from real people are often the most persuasive.
5. Give people a reason to care.
Make sure to convey your start-up’s relevance, but don’t use buzz words like 
you’re “revolutionary,” or “are the industry’s best.” These terms are too slick. 
Instead, be genuine. explain in everyday language why your customers or donors 
should care.
6. Tell your story.
Why do you care? There is nothing that builds credibility and trust faster than 
a founder telling the sincere story of why he or she is launching a company or 
starting a nonprofit. Include your picture and put a real e-mail address next to it.
7.  Have a presence on Twitter, 
Facebook, or both.
Like it or not, people will look for you on Twitter and Facebook. If you’re not there, it’s 
a red flag. establish a presence on one or both sites and provide frequent updates.
8.  Tell people how you’ll use and/or 
protect their money.
If you’re a for-profit business, offer a money-back guarantee. If you’re a nonprofit, 
explain in specific terms how your donor’s money will be spent.

coachup
Launched in 2012, CoachUp is a service that con-
nects athletes with private coaches. The company 
believes strongly that private coaching is the secret 
to reaching the next level in sports and life. CoachUp 
was founded by Jordan Fliegel. Fliegel was an average 
high school basketball player until has father hired a 
private coach for him, Greg Kristof, who had been the 
captain of the Brandeis University team. The sessions 
with Kristof helped Fliegel make his own high school 
basketball team, and he went on to play in college and 
in a professional league overseas. CoachUp’s website 
matches athletes, in all major sports, with coaches 
that are willing to work with them. Over 60,000 athletes 
have connected with more than 12,000 coaches since 
the site was launched. CoachUp vets all coaches for 
necessary coaching experience. The average cost of a 
coaching session is $40-$60 per hour. CoachUp makes 
money by taking a small percentage of the coaching 
fees charged through its site.
That’s the service that CoachUp offers. Here’s how 
CoachUp is building credibility and trust via the eight 
techniques described previously.
 1. It has a professional logo design, beautiful website, 
and a corporate e-mail address.
 2. It has attracted considerable press and has been 
featured on ABC, Cnn, and CBS SportsRadio. 
Articles about CoachUp have appeared in the 
huffington Post, Forbes, the Wall Street Journal, 
and USa today.
 3. CoachUp has established partnerships with the 
national High School Basketball Association, the 
Positive Coaching Alliance, and the Sports Legacy 
Institute. Its advisory board includes Philadelphia 
76ers center nerleans noel and Boston Bruins presi-
dent Cam neely. The company has raised money 
from private investors Paul english (co-founder of 
Kayak.com) and Albert Dobron (managing director of 
Providence equity Partners) and venture capital firms 
Point Judith Capital and General Catalyst Partners.
 4. CoachUp maintains an archive of customer testimo-
nials on its website. The testimonials are provided 
by coaches, athletes, and the parents of athletes.
 5. The company routinely posts videos on the front 
page of its website that depict the benefits of private 
coaching. The videos connect potential clients with 
CoachUp’s core belief—that coaching is the secret 
to reaching the next level in both sports and life.
 6. CoachUp founder Jordan Fliegel is very transpar-
ent about his story—of being a mediocre high 
school basketball player who, through the efforts 
of a private coach, made his high school team, 
played in college, and played professional basket-
ball overseas. The company’s core values are also 
very visible and transparent. CoachUp believes 
that private coaching helps boost the performance 
and life skills of athletes and provides extraordi-
narily rewarding experiences for coaches.
 7. The company is active on both Twitter and 
Facebook. As of June 2014, it had 4,780 Twitter 
 followers and a very active Facebook page.
 8. CoachUp offers a 100 percent money back guaran-
tee on all sessions. CoachUp also provides a phone 
number on its website (1-888-680-4750) and en-
courages its clients or prospective clients to call at 
any time with questions or concerns.
CoachUp prominently features this information on 
its website. It’s tastefully done, provides useful informa-
tion, conveys the company’s values, and provides mul-
tiple opportunities (i.e., FAQ, blog, Twitter, Facebook) for 
prospective customers to get to know the company be-
fore trying it out. While these techniques serve multiple 
purposes, they’re essential in helping CoachUp build 
credibility and trust with its target market.
charity: water
Charity: Water is a nonprofit organization bringing safe 
and clean drinking water to people in developing coun-
tries. Founded in 2006, it has helped fund over 11,700 
water projects in 22 countries.
Charity: Water was started by Scott Harrison. 
Harrison developed a passion for helping alleviate the 
plight of the 1-plus billion people in the world who do 
not have access to clean water. The company started 
when Harrison asked a large group of family, friends, 
and acquaintances to attend his 31st birthday party. 
Instead of giving him a gift, he asked each invitee to 
pledge $31 to help him start a nonprofit to focus on 
clean water. A total of 700 people attended, and the 
money was used to fund the drilling of six wells in a 
refugee camp in Uganda. Charity: Water has grown and 
is now active across the world. It has done many things 
to bring the urgency of its cause to the attention of the 
public, including setting up an outdoor exhibition in new 
York City in which it displayed tanks of water that were 
similar in appearance and quality to the poor-quality 
 water consumed daily in many parts of the world. In 
2012 alone, Charity: Water raised $33 million and funded 
more than 2,000 water projects. Its projects vary from 
country to country depending on water sources, the na-
ture of the terrain, and the local population. Its solutions 
range from drilled wells to rainwater catchments (gutters 
on rooftops that catch rain water and place it in sanitary 
holding tanks) to spring protections (a system captures 
and safely stores pure water from a natural spring).
That’s what Charity: Water is about. Like any char-
ity, it relies on the trust and support of its donors. Here’s 
how Charity: Water covers the eight techniques shown 
previously for building credibility and support.
 1. It has a professional logo design, beautiful website, 
and a .org e-mail address.
 2. It’s attracted considerable press and has been 
featured on MSnBC, ABC, Cnn, and Fox news. 
Articles have been written about it in the new York 
times, USa today, the new Yorker, and other 
outlets.
 3. A number of high-profile people have raised money 
for Charity: Water, including Tony Hawk, Justin 
Bieber, and Dr. Oz. In each area of the world it en-
ters, Charity: Water collaborates with local partners 
to complete its work.

CHAPTeR 7 | PRePARInG THe PROPeR Ethical and lEgal FOUnDATIOn    275
 4. In 2012, 90,057 people donated money to Charity: 
Water for an average donation of $187.90. A section 
of Charity: Water’s website is titled “Stories from the 
Field.” The stories provide contributors a personal 
view of what it’s like for someone to get clean water 
for the first time, and the difference their donations 
are making to real people across the world.
 5. The statistics that Charity: Water disseminates 
about the hazards of unsafe drinking water are 
both compelling and heart-wrenching. Unsafe 
drinking water represents a health crisis in many 
parts of the world. A total of 90 percent of the 
30,000 deaths that occur each week from unsafe 
water and unhygienic living conditions are children 
under five years old.
 6. Charity: Water’s website provides extensive infor-
mation about why the organization was started and 
who’s behind it.
 7. Charity: Water is active on both Twitter and 
Facebook. As of June 2014, it had 1.43 million 
Twitter followers and a very active Facebook page.
 8. Since day one, Charity: Water has believed in prov-
ing its work to its supporters. Much of the money 
raised by Charity: Water is raised via campaigners, 
which are schools, churches, and others who are 
interested in helping provide clean water for people 
in need. Once a campaigner’s project is funded and 
finished, they are sent a completion report with pho-
tos and GPS coordinates of their project.

aPPenDix 7.1   What’s in a business name?: a lot of trouble if You 
aren’t careful
introduction
While at first glance naming a business may seem like a minor issue, it is an extremely 
 important one. A company’s name is one of the first things people associate with a business, 
and it is a word or phrase that will be said thousands or hundreds of thousands of times 
during the life of a firm. A company’s name is also the most critical aspect of its branding 
strategy. A company brand is the unique set of attributes that allows consumers to separate 
it from its competitors. As a result, it is important that a business choose its name carefully 
so that it will facilitate rather than hinder how the business wants to differentiate itself in the 
marketplace.
If an entrepreneur isn’t careful, the process of naming a business can also result in a peck 
of trouble. There are a number of legal issues involved in naming a business, which should be 
taken seriously. If a business selects a name and later finds out that it has already been legally 
taken, the business may have to (1) amend its articles of incorporation, (2) change its Internet 
domain name, (3) obtain new listings in telephone and other directories, (4) purchase new sta-
tionery and business cards, (5) redo signage and advertising, and (6) incur the expense and 
potential embarrassment of introducing a new name to its customers. These are complications 
that no entrepreneur wants to endure. The following case describes the strategies for naming a 
business, along with the legal issues involved.

The primary consideration in naming a company is that the name should complement the type 
of business the company plans to be. It is helpful to divide companies into four categories to 
discuss this issue.
Consumer-Driven Companies
If a company plans to focus on a particular type of customer, its name should reflect the attri-
butes of its clientele. For example, a high-end clothing store that specializes in small sizes for 
women is called La Petite Femme. Similarly, a company named Local Dirt helps food retailers 
connect with local producers of produce, meats, and other food products. These companies 
have names that were chosen to appeal specifically to their target market or clientele.
Product- or Service-Driven Companies
If a company plans to focus on a particular product or service, its name should reflect the ad-
vantages that its product or service brings to the marketplace. examples include Jiffy Print, 
Anytime Fitness, and 1-800-FLOWeRS. These names were chosen to reflect the distinctive at-
tributes of the product or service the company offers, regardless of the clientele.
Industry-Driven Companies
If a company plans to focus on a broad range of products or services in a particular industry, 
its name should reflect the category in which it participates. examples include General Motors, 
Bed Bath & Beyond, and Home Depot. These companies have names that are intentionally 
broad and are not limiting in regard to target market or product selection.
Personality- or Image-Driven Companies
Some companies are founded by individuals who put such an indelible stamp on the company 
that it may be smart to name the company after the founder. examples include Liz Claiborne, 
Walt Disney, Charles Schwab, and Magic Johnson enterprises. These companies have names 
that benefit from a positive association with a popular or distinctive founder. Of course, this 
strategy can backfire if the founder falls out of favor in the public’s eye.
While names come to some business owners easily, for others it’s a painstaking process. 
It was a painstaking process for JetBlue, as described in the book Blue Streak, which is a 
chronology of the early years of JetBlue. According to Barbara Peterson, the book’s author, 
David neeleman, the founder of JetBlue, and his initial management team agonized over what 
to name the company and considered literally hundreds of names before settling on JetBlue. 
JetBlue was launched in 1999. neeleman felt that a strong brand would surmount the handicap

of being a new airline and believed that the company’s name was the key to building its brand. 
A list of some of the alternative names that neeleman and his management team seriously con-
sidered for JetBlue is shown in a nearby feature. Today, it’s hard to think of JetBlue as anything 
other than JetBlue, which illustrates the power of branding.

legal issues involved in naming a business
The general rule for business names is that they must be unique. In other words, in most in-
stances, there may not be more than one business per name per state. In addition, a business 
may not have a name that is confusingly similar to another business. This regulation prevents a 
software company from naming itself Macrosoft, for example, which Microsoft would undoubt-
edly claim is confusingly similar to its name.
To determine if a name is available in a particular state, the entrepreneur must usually 
contact the secretary of state’s office to see if a particular name is available. The inquiry can 
typically be accomplished online or over the phone. If the name is available, the next step is to 
reserve it in the manner recommended by the secretary of state’s office. Many attorneys and in-
corporation services include this step in the fee-based services they offer to entrepreneurs and 
their ventures.
Once a name that is available has been chosen, it should be trademarked. The process for 
obtaining a trademark is straightforward and relatively inexpensive, given the protection it pro-
vides. A full explanation of how to obtain a trademark is provided in Chapter 12 of this book.
The entire process of naming a business is often very frustrating for entrepreneurs, be-
cause it is becoming increasingly difficult to find a name that isn’t already taken. For example, if 
an entrepreneur was planning to open a new quick-printing service, almost every possible per-
mutation of the word printing with words like quick, swift, fast, rapid, speedy, jiffy, express, in-
stant, and so forth are taken. In addition, sometimes names that work in one culture don’t work 
in another, which is something that should be taken into consideration. The classic example of 
this is the Chevy nova. After much advertising and fanfare, the car received a very cool recep-
tion in Mexico. It turned out that the phrase No va in Spanish means “Doesn’t Go.” not surpris-
ingly, the nova didn’t sell well in Mexico.
As a result of these complications, and for other reasons, entrepreneurs use a variety of 
other strategies when naming their business. Some names are simply made up, because the 
firm wants a name that is catchy or distinctive, or because it needs to make up a name to get 
an Internet domain name that isn’t already taken (more about this later). examples of names 
that were made up include Wello, verizon, eBay, Google, and Fitbit. Some of these names are 
made up with the help of marketing research firms that use sophisticated methodologies such 
as an evaluation of the “linguistic properties” (will a consumer read the name properly?), the 
“phonetic transparency” (is it spelled as it sounds?), and the “multilingual functionality” (is it as 
intelligible in Japanese as in english?) of a particular name. All of these issues are potentially 
important. Several years ago Anderson Consulting changed its name to Accenture. The pro-
nunciation of “Accenture” isn’t obvious, which has been a problem for the firm ever since.
internet Domain names
A final complicating factor in selecting a name for a company is registering an Internet domain 
name. A domain name is a company’s Internet address (e.g., www.facebook.com). Most com-
panies want their domain name to be the same as their company’s name. It is easy to register

a domain name through an online registration service such as GoDaddy.com   (www.godaddy.
com). The standard fee for registering and maintaining a domain name is about $13 per year.
Because no two domain names can be exactly the same, frustrations often arise when a 
company tries to register its domain name and the name is already taken. There are two rea-
sons that a name may already be taken. First, a company may find that another company with 
the same name has already registered it. For example, if an entrepreneur started a company 
called Delta Semiconductor, it would find that the domain name www.delta.com is already 
taken by Delta Airlines. This scenario plays itself out every day and represents a challenge for 
new firms that have chosen fairly ordinary names. The firm can either select another domain 
name (such as www.deltasemiconductor.com) or try to acquire the name from its present 
owner. However, it is unlikely that Delta Airlines would give up www.delta.com for any price. 
The second reason that a domain name may already be taken is that it might be in the hands of 
someone who has registered the name with the intention of using it at a later date or of some-
one who simply collects domain names in hopes that someone will want to buy the name at a 
higher price.
Still, a little imagination goes a long way in selecting a company name and an Internet 
domain name. For example, we (your book’s authors) made up the name iUser Accessories for 
the business described in Case 7.1. The Internet domain name www.iuseraccessories.com was 
available, which we registered on GoDaddy.com   for $13 per year. What might we do with this 
Internet domain name? We aren’t certain. But, another party deciding to launch an entrepre-
neurial venture with this name will discover that the hoped-for name is already registered.

ave you ever gone to a gym only to have your heart sink because the  machines 
you planned to work out on were already in use? If so, you would be inter-
ested in joining a gym that features GymFlow. GymFlow is a mobile app that 
helps people determine before they show up just how crowded a 
gym is. It works by tapping into a gym’s IT center to provide real-
time traffic data.
GymFlow is the creation of Jimmy Liu and Jiangyang Zhang, two 
USC students. In the nearby photo, Jiangyang Zhang is on the left 
and Jimmy Liu is on the right. Liu was a double major in entrepre-
neurship and finance, while Zhang was a PhD student in engineering. 
The two met in fall 2012, in USC’s Viterbi School of Engineering’s 
“Building the High Tech Startup” course. The course combines busi-
ness and engineering students to conceive and develop new product 
ideas. Liu and Zhang identified a two-sided problem that gyms face. 
Gym members are often frustrated when they show up at the gym 
and it’s more crowded than they anticipated. At the same time, gym 
owners are frustrated by low retention rates. About 40 percent of 
the people who belong to gyms turn over every year. This is a huge 
problem for gyms. If a gym has 1,000 members, it must gain 400 new 
members a year just to stay even.
To solve the two-sided problem that gyms and its members face, 
Liu and Zhang developed a mobile app called GymFlow. Although 
there are now over one million apps in the Apple App Store alone, Liu and Zhang found 
a gap. There was no app that accurately showed how busy a gym was at any given 
point in time. GymFlow was set up to do two things. First, show the user in real time how 
crowded a particular gym is. And second, forecast future traffic flows to help the user 
plan workouts and avoid waiting time for equipment at the gym. The benefit to the gym 
would be more satisfied users, a smoothing out of when people come to the gym, and 
higher member retention. The app would be free to the member. Gyms would be charged 
for the back-end technology needed to make the system work. The app would have no 
ads. Liu and Zhang wanted the user experience to be as high quality as possible.

After the class concluded, Liu and Zhang decided to pursue GymFlow further. 
From the beginning, they were mindful of the costs and financials involved. To make 
sure they were on the right track, the two talked to both gyms and gym members 
prior to spending any money. They found that gym members saw the value of the app 
instantly. Gym owners were a tougher sell. Still, the feedback was sufficiently posi-
tive to move forward. Early 2013 was spent building the app. Zhang, a former Google 
employee, had programming skills that he used to write the code for the app himself. 
The pair’s first funding was $20,000 in cash from the Virerbi Startup Garage, a start-
up accelerator affiliated with USC. GymFlow was one of 10 USC start-ups, out of 100 
applicants, accepted into the accelerator. Beyond the money, the accelerator program 
provided Liu and Zhang access to mentors and an entrepreneurial network to plug 
into. An additional $5,000 came from an innovation grant and another $5,000 came 
from winning a pitch competition.
To avoid loan payments or pressure to grow quickly from investors, Liu and 
Zhang decided to rely on the money mentioned above and bootstrap the remaining 
costs needed to get GymFlow up and running. While their initial plan was to work on 
GymFlow full time, they decided to pursue the venture part time and maintain jobs on 
the side. Prior to marketing GymFlow beyond USC, Liu and Zhang conducted a pilot 
study at USC’s Lyon Recreational Center. The first month that GymFlow was available 
it was downloaded by 2,000 USC students and was used over 20,000 times. The pilot 
test was successful and provided Liu and Zhang the confidence to press forward and 
market GymFlow to a wider audience.
As of August 2014, GymFlow was in seven gyms on three college campuses, all 
in Southern California. The company has encouraging prospects for expansion, not 
only in the United States but abroad. Liu and Zhang remain focused on GymFlow’s 
finances. one thing that’s helped them, particularly from a cash flow standpoint, is 
that the app required very little capital to build and the company started earning rev-
enue as soon as the first GymFlow system was deployed. As a result, GymFlow has 
not experienced the type of cash-flow gaps that B2B (business-to-business) com-
panies often experience when they incur substantial up-front expenses for a product 
run or job, and then have to wait 30 to 60 days to get paid. While Liu and Zhang did 
not write a formal business plan, they did complete financial projections, which they 
felt were useful. They have found that projecting future income is one of their most 
difficult challenges. They’ve also found that this is one of the most important things 
an entrepreneur can do. other things have worked to Liu and Zhang’s advantage 
when it comes to managing finances. For example, selling via the Apple App Store 
and Google Play (primary source for Android Apps) is an advantage for an app-
based company. Apple and Google Play essentially act as GymFlow’s distributor for 
the app. This relieves a company like GymFlow of the financial burden of building its 
own distribution platform.
I
n terms of overall financial management, Liu and Zhang are comfortable 
with where GymFlow is today. Many lessons have been learned, however, 
about the importance of cash flow and the need for sharp financial manage-
ment for a growing company.
In this chapter, we’ll look at how new ventures manage their finances and 
assess their financial strength and viability. For the purposes of completeness, 
we’ll look at how both existing firms and entrepreneurial ventures accomplish 
these tasks. First, we’ll consider general financial management and discuss the

process. Financial management deals with two activities: raising money and 
managing a company’s finances in a way that achieves the highest rate of re-
turn.1 We cover the process of raising money in Chapter 10. This chapter focuses 
on how a company manages its finances in an effort to increase its financial 
strength and earn the highest rate of return. Next, we’ll examine how existing 
firms track their financial progress through preparing, analyzing, and maintain-
ing past financial statements. Finally, we’ll discuss how both existing firms and 
start-up ventures forecast future income and expenses and how the forecasts are 
used to prepare pro forma (i.e., projected) financial statements. Pro forma finan-
cial statements, which include the pro forma income statement, the pro forma 
balance sheet, and the pro forma statement of cash flows, are extremely helpful 
to firms in financial planning.
introduction to Financial Management
An entrepreneur’s ability to pursue an opportunity and turn the opportunity 
into a viable entrepreneurial firm hinges largely on the availability of money. 
Regardless of the quality of a product or service, a company can’t be viable in 
the long run unless it is successful financially. Money either comes from ex-
ternal sources (such as investors or lenders) or is internally generated through 
earnings. It is important for a firm to have a solid grasp of how it is doing 
financially. One of the most common mistakes young entrepreneurial firms 
make is not emphasizing financial management and putting in place appropri-
ate forms of financial controls.2
Entrepreneurs and those managing established companies must be aware 
of how much money they have in the bank and if that amount is sufficient 
to satisfy their firm’s financial obligations. Just because a firm is successful 
doesn’t mean that it doesn’t face financial challenges.3 For example, many of 
the small firms that sell their products to larger companies such as Apple, 
General Electric (GE), and The Home Depot aren’t paid for 30 to 60 days from 
the time they make a sale. Think about the difficulty this scenario creates. The 
small firm must buy parts, pay its employees, pay its routine bills, build and 
ship its products, and then wait for one to two months for payment. Unless a 
firm manages its money carefully, it is easy to run out of cash, even if its prod-
ucts or services are selling like hotcakes.4 Similarly, as a company grows, its 
cash demands often increase to service a growing clientele. It is important for a 
firm to accurately anticipate whether it will be able to fund its growth through 
earnings or if it will need to look for investment capital or borrowing to raise 
needed cash.
The financial management of a firm deals with questions such as the fol-
lowing on an ongoing basis:
■ How are we doing? Are we making or losing money?
■ How much cash do we have on hand?
■ Do we have enough cash to meet our short-term obligations?
■ How efficiently are we utilizing our assets?
■ How do our growth and net profits compare to those of our industry peers?
■ Where will the funds we need for capital improvements come from?
■ Are there ways we can partner with other firms to share risk and reduce 
the amount of cash we need?
■ Overall, are we in good shape financially?
A properly managed firm stays on top of the issues suggested by these ques-
tions through the tools and techniques that we’ll discuss in this chapter.

nancial management of an 
entrepreneurial firm.

284    PART 3 | MoVInG FRoM An IDEA To An EnTREPREnEURIAL FIRM
Financial Objectives of a Firm
Most entrepreneurial firms—whether they have been in business for several 
years or they are start-ups—have four main financial objectives: profitability, 
liquidity, efficiency, and stability. Understanding these objectives sets a firm 
on the right financial course and helps it track the answers to the previously 
posed questions. Figure 8.1 describes each of these objectives.
Profitability is the ability to earn a profit. Many start-ups are not profit-
able during their first one to three years, while they are training employees and 
building their brands, but a firm must become profitable to remain viable and 
provide a return to its owners.
Liquidity is a company’s ability to meet its short-term financial obliga-
tions. Even if a firm is profitable, it is often a challenge to keep enough money 
in the bank to meet its routine obligations in a timely manner. To do so, a firm 
must keep a close watch on accounts receivable and inventories. A company’s 
accounts receivable is money owed to it by its customers. Its inventory is its 
merchandise, raw materials, and products waiting to be sold. If a firm allows 
the levels of either of these assets to get too high, it may not be able to keep 
sufficient cash on hand to meet its short-term obligations.5
Efficiency is how productively a firm utilizes its assets relative to its rev-
enue and its profits. Southwest Airlines, for example, uses its assets very pro-
ductively. Its turnaround time, or the time that its airplanes sit on the ground 
while they are being unloaded and reloaded, is the lowest in the airline industry. 
As Southwest officials are quick to point out, “Our planes don’t make any money 
sitting on the ground—we have to get them back into the air.”6
Stability is the strength and vigor of the firm’s overall financial posture. 
For a firm to be stable, it must not only earn a profit and remain liquid but 
also keep its debt in check. If a firm continues to borrow from its lenders and 
its debt-to-equity ratio, which is calculated by dividing its long-term debt by 
its shareholders’ equity, gets too high, it may have trouble meeting its obliga-
tions and securing the level of financing needed to fuel its growth.
An increasingly common way that small companies improve their pros-
pects across several of these areas is to join buying groups or co-ops, where 
businesses band together to attain volume discounts on products and services. 
Gaining access to products and services this way facilitates smaller firms’ ef-
forts to compete on more of a “level playing field” with larger, more established 
companies. The way buying groups work, and how they’re able to help busi-
nesses cut costs without adversely affecting their competitiveness, is described 
in this chapter’s “Partnering for Success” feature.
the process of Financial Management
To assess whether its financial objectives are being met, firms rely heavily on 
analyses of financial statements, forecasts, and budgets. A financial state-
ment is a written report that quantitatively describes a firm’s financial health.

The income statement, the balance sheet, and the statement of cash flows are 
the financial statements entrepreneurs use most commonly. Forecasts are an 
estimate of a firm’s future income and expenses, based on its past performance, 
its current circumstances, and its future plans.7 New ventures typically base 
their forecasts on an estimate of sales and then on industry averages or the 
experiences of similar start-ups regarding the cost of goods sold (based on a 
percentage of sales) and on other expenses. Budgets are itemized forecasts of a 
company’s income, expenses, and capital needs and are also an important tool 
for financial planning and control.8
The process of a firm’s financial management is shown in Figure 8.2. It 
begins by tracking the company’s past financial performance through the 
preparation and analysis of financial statements. These statements organize 
and report the firm’s financial transactions. They tell a firm how much money 
it is making or losing (income statement), the structure of its assets and liabili-
ties (balance sheet), and where its cash is coming from and going (statement of 
cash flows). The statements also help a firm discern how it stacks up against 
its competitors and industry norms. Most firms look at two to three years of 
past financial statements when preparing forecasts.
lower price, with no undesirable impact (other than the 
membership fee) on the other parts of their operations. 
The money that’s freed up can go directly to a business’s 
bottom line or be used to invest in customer service or 
other methods to increase competitiveness. There is no 
national directory of industry buying groups. The best 
way to find out whether there are buying groups servic-
ing an industry is to conduct an Internet research and 
ask among industry participants.
Questions for Critical Thinking
 1. Which of the four financial objectives of a firm— 
profitability, liquidity, efficiency, or stability—does 
participating in a buying cooperative contribute to the 
most?
 2. Do some Internet and/or library research to discern 
whether there is a small business buying group or 
groups that new Venture Fitness Drinks, the fictitious 
company introduced in Chapter 3 and used as an 
example throughout this chapter, could benefit from. 
new Venture Fitness Drinks’ products contain all the 
ingredients used to make smoothies and similar fitness 
drinks and shakes.
 3. Identify three ways, other than buying coopera-
tives, that small businesses partner with other small 
businesses to cut costs without sacrificing their 
competitiveness?
 4. In an effort to improve the financial position of their 
firms, do you think the majority of entrepreneurs spend 
an equal amount of time focusing on (1) cost cutting 
and (2) increasing revenues? If not, which of the two 
do you think they spend more time on and why?
O
ne challenge that businesses confront is cutting 
costs in ways that don’t erode their ability to  remain 
competitive. Many cost-cutting techniques, such 
as scaling back on hiring, lowering marketing  expenses, 
or reducing inventory, may save money but may also 
 decrease a business’s chances to remain competitive. 
one technique that can help to conserve a product-
based business’s financial assets without adverse side 
effects is to join or organize a buying group.
A buying group, or buying co-op, is a partnership 
that bands small businesses and start-up firms together 
to attain volume discounts on products and services. In 
the UK and the Republic of Ireland, the Toymaster Group 
has been in operation since 1977 and now has around 
250 members. They are all small, independent toys and 
games stores that operate under the name Toymaster 
and benefit from the combined buying power of all of 
the members. Some 55 percent of an average toy shop’s 
revenue comes in during the pre-Christmas period and 
just 15 percent for each of the other three quarters of the 
year. This means accounting and money management is 
tightly controlled and this is what a buying group offers.
Suma is the UK’s largest independent co-operative 
wholefood wholesaler/distributor. They specialize in veg-
etarian, fairly traded, organic, ethical and natural prod-
ucts. They provide a unique, niche service as they are 
100 percent vegetarian and stock no animal products or 
products derived from animals. They have close relation-
ships with the growers and suppliers and cite that they 
have real commitment to fair trade rather than simply 
using it as a marketing device.
The beauty of buying groups is that they generally 
allow businesses to obtain the exact same product for a

The next step is to prepare forecasts for two to three years in the future. 
In turn, forecasts are used to prepare a firm’s pro forma financial statements, 
which, along with its more fine-tuned budgets, constitute its financial plan.
The final step in the process is the ongoing analysis of a firm’s financial re-
sults. Financial ratios, which depict relationships between items on a firm’s 
financial statements, are used to discern whether a firm is meeting its finan-
cial objectives and how it stacks up against its industry peers. These ratios are 
also used to assess trends. Obviously, a completely new venture would start 
at step 2 in Figure 8.2. It is important that a new venture be familiar with the 
entire process, however. Typically, new ventures prepare financial statements 
quarterly so that as soon as the first quarter is completed, the new venture 
will have historic financial statements to help prepare forecasts and pro forma 
statements for future periods.
It is important for a firm to evaluate how it is faring relative to its industry. 
Sometimes raw financial ratios that are not viewed in context are deceiving. For 
example, a firm’s past three years’ income statements may show that it is increas-
ing its sales at a rate of 15 percent per year. This number may seem impressive—
until one learns that the industry in which the firm competes is growing at a rate 
of 30 percent per year, showing that the firm is steadily losing market share.
Many experienced entrepreneurs stress the importance of keeping on top 
of the financial management of a firm. In the competitive environments in 
which most firms exist, it’s simply not good enough to shoot from the hip when 
making financial decisions. Reinforcing this point, Bill Gates, the founder of 
Microsoft, said,
The business side of any company starts and ends with hard-core analysis of its 
numbers. Whatever else you do, if you don’t understand what’s happening in your 
business factually and you’re making business decisions based on anecdotal data 
or gut instinct, you’ll eventually pay a big price.9

Financial statements
Historical financial statements reflect past performance and are usually 
prepared on a quarterly and annual basis. Publicly traded firms are required 
by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to prepare financial state-
ments and make them available to the public. The statements are submitted to 
the SEC through a number of required filings. The most comprehensive filing 
is the 10-K, which is a report similar to the annual report except that it con-
tains more detailed information about the company’s business.10 The 10-K for 
any publicly traded firm is available at www.freeedgar.com.
Pro forma financial statements are projections for future periods based 
on forecasts and are typically completed for two to three years in the future. 
Pro forma financial statements are strictly planning tools and are not required 
by the SEC. In fact, most companies consider their pro forma statements to be 
confidential and reveal them to outsiders, such as lenders and investors, only 
on a “need-to-know” basis.
To illustrate how these financial instruments are prepared, let’s look at 
New Venture Fitness Drinks, the fictitious sports drink company to which you 
were introduced in Chapter 3. New Venture Fitness Drinks has been in busi-
ness for five years. Targeting sports enthusiasts, the company sells a line of 
nutritional fitness drinks. It opened a single location in 2012, added a second 
location in 2014, and plans to add a third in 2015. The company’s strategy is 
to place small restaurants, similar to smoothie restaurants, near large outdoor 
sports complexes. The company is profitable and is growing at a rate of 25 per-
cent per year.
historical Financial statements
Historical financial statements include the income statement, the balance sheet, 
and the statement of cash flows. The statements are usually prepared in this 
 order because information flows logically from one to the next. In start-ups, 
 financial statements are typically scrutinized closely to monitor the financial 
progress of the firm. On the rare occasion when a company has not used financial

statements in planning, it should prepare and maintain them anyway. If a firm 
goes to a banker or investor to raise funds, the banker or investor will invariably 
ask for copies of past financial statements to analyze the firm’s financial history. 
If a firm does not have these statements, it may be precluded from serious con-
sideration for an investment or a loan. Let’s look at each of these statements.
income Statement  The income statement reflects the results of the oper-
ations of a firm over a specified period of time.11 It records all the revenues and 
expenses for the given period and shows whether the firm is making a profit or 
is experiencing a loss (which is why the income statement if often referred to as 
the “profit-and-loss statement”). Income statements are typically prepared on a 
monthly, quarterly, and annual basis. Most income statements are prepared in 
a multiyear format, making it easy to spot trends.
The consolidated income statement for the past three years for New Venture 
Fitness Drinks is shown in Table 8.1. The value of the multi period format is 
clear. It’s easy to see that the company’s sales are increasing at the rate of 
about 25 percent per year, it is profitable, and its net income is increasing. The 
numbers are used to evaluate the effect of past strategies and to help project 
future sales and earnings.
The three numbers that receive the most attention when evaluating an 
income statement are the following:
■ Net sales: Net sales consist of total sales minus allowances for returned 
goods and discounts.
■ Cost of sales (or cost of goods sold): Cost of sales includes all the 
 direct costs associated with producing or delivering a product or service, 
including the material costs and direct labor. In the case of New Venture

Fitness Drinks, this would include the ingredients that go into the fitness 
drinks and the labor needed to produce them.
■ Operating expenses: Operating expenses include marketing, adminis-
trative costs, and other expenses not directly related to producing a prod-
uct or service.
One of the most valuable things that entrepreneurs and managers do with in-
come statements is to compare the ratios of cost of sales and operating expenses 
to net sales for different periods. For example, the cost of sales for New Venture 
Fitness Drinks, which includes the ingredients for its fitness drinks and the 
labor needed to make them, has been 55, 49, and 46 percent of sales for 2012, 
2013, and 2014, respectively. This is a healthy trend. It shows that the company 
is steadily decreasing its material and labor costs per dollar of sales. This is the 
type of trend that can be noticed fairly easily by looking at a firm’s multiyear in-
come statements.
Profit margin is a ratio that is of particular importance when evaluating a 
firm’s income statements. A firm’s profit margin, or return on sales, is com-
puted by dividing net income by net sales. For the years 2012, 2013, and 2014, 
the profit margin for New Venture Fitness Drinks has been 13.6, 17.9, and 22.3 
percent, respectively. This is also a healthy trend. A firm’s profit margin tells 
it what percentage of every dollar in sales contributes to the bottom line. An 
increasing profit margin means that a firm is either boosting its sales without 
increasing its expenses or that it is doing a better job of controlling its costs. In 
contrast, a declining profit margin means that a firm is losing control of its costs 
or that it is slashing prices to maintain or increase sales.
One ratio that will not be computed for New Venture Fitness Drinks is 
price-to-earnings ratio, or P/E ratio. New Venture Fitness Drinks is incor-
porated, so it has stock, but its stock is not traded on a public exchange such 
as the NASDAQ or the New York Stock Exchange. P/E is a simple ratio that 
measures the price of a company’s stock against its earnings.12 Generally, the 
higher a company’s price-to-earnings ratio goes, the greater the market thinks 
it will grow. In 2014, New Venture Fitness Drinks earned $1.31 per share. If it 
was listed on the NASDAQ and its stock was trading at $20 per share, its P/E 
would be 15.3. This is what is meant when you hear that a company is selling 
for “15 times earnings.”
The importance of looking at several years of income statements rather than 
just one is illustrated in this chapter’s “Savvy Entrepreneurial Firm” feature.
balance Sheet  Unlike the income statement, which covers a specified period 
of time, a balance sheet is a snapshot of a company’s assets, liabilities, and 
owners’ equity at a specific point in time.13 The left-hand side of a balance sheet 
(or the top, depending on how it is displayed) shows a firm’s assets, while the 
right-hand side (or bottom) shows its liabilities and owners’ equity. The assets are 
listed in order of their “liquidity,” or the length of time it takes to convert them to 
cash. The liabilities are listed in the order in which they must be paid. A balance 
sheet must always “balance,” meaning that a firm’s assets must always equal its 
liabilities plus owners’ equity.14
The major categories of assets listed on a balance sheet are the following:
■ Current assets: Current assets include cash plus items that are readily 
convertible to cash, such as accounts receivable, marketable securities, 
and inventories.
■ Fixed assets: Fixed assets are assets used over a longer time frame, 
such as real estate, buildings, equipment, and furniture.
■ Other assets: Other assets are miscellaneous assets, including accumu-
lated goodwill.

By glancing at these statements, it would appear that 
the shrewdest financial manager of the three is the CEo of 
new Venture Sea Food. The company’s net income is more 
than double that of the other two firms. In addition, new 
Venture Sea Food’s cost of sales was 35.9 percent of net 
sales in 2014, compared to 46.1 percent for new Venture 
Soup and Salad and 51 percent for new Venture Beef. 
Similarly, new Venture Sea Food’s expenses were 30.9 per-
cent of sales, compared to 35.0 percent for new Venture 
Soup and Salad and 40 percent for new Venture Beef.
Fortunately, one of the board members of new 
Venture Fitness Drinks asked a series of questions during 
the personal interviews of the candidates and uncovered 
some revealing information. As it turns out, new Venture 
Sea Food was in the hottest segment of the restaurant 
industry in 2014. Seafood restaurants of comparable size 
produced about 1.5 times as much net income as new 
Venture Sea Food did. So if candidate 3 had done his job 
properly, his company’s net income should have been 
in the neighborhood of $240,000 instead of $162,000. 
new Venture Soup and Salad was in a slow-growth area 
and at midyear feared that it might not meet its financial 
targets. So the CEo pulled several of his best people off 
projects and reassigned them to marketing to develop 
new menu items. In other words, the company borrowed 
from its future to make its numbers work today.
As for new Venture Beef, the CEo found herself in 
a market that was losing appeal. Several reports that 
gained national publicity were published early in the year 
warning consumers of the risks of eating red meat. To 
compensate, the CEo quickly implemented a productiv-
ity improvement program and partnered with a local beef 
promotion board to counter the bad press with more 
objective research results about beef’s nutritional value. 
The company also participated in several volunteer 
L
et’s say that new Venture Fitness Drinks was inter-
ested in hiring a new chief executive officer (CEo) 
and was interviewing the CEos of three small restau-
rant chains. To get a sense of how savvy each candidate 
was at managing a firm’s finances, the board of directors 
of new Venture Fitness Drinks asked each person to 
submit the 2014 income statement for his or her current 
firm. An analysis of an abbreviated version of each firm’s 
income statement is shown here.

efforts in its local community to raise the visibility of 
its restaurants in a positive manner. If the CEo of new 
Venture Beef hadn’t moved quickly to take these actions, 
its 2014 performance would have been much worse.
Ultimately, new Venture Fitness Drinks decided that 
candidate 2, the CEo of new Venture Beef, was the best 
candidate for its job. This example illustrates the need to 
look at multiple years of an income statement rather than 
a single year to fairly assess how well a firm is perform-
ing financially. It also illustrates the need to look beyond 
the numbers and understand the circumstances that sur-
round a firm’s financial results.
Questions for Critical Thinking
 1. Show the income statements for the three candidates 
to two or three friends who are majoring in business. 
Ask them to select the best CEo from among these 
three people on the basis of these income statements. 
In addition, ask your friends to explain their choices to 
you. Did your friends choose the same candidate? If 
not, what do you think caused the differences in their 
choices?
 2. Based on material presented in this chapter, earlier 
chapters in this book, and your general business knowl-
edge, where would you go to find information about 
the growth of the different segments of the restaurant 
industry? Where would you go to find information about 
the profitability of the restaurant industry in general?
 3. What would have been the appropriate financial infor-
mation to request from the three candidates for the job?
 4. What are the three most important insights you gained 
from studying this feature? Which of these insights sur-
prised you, and why?

CHAPTER 8 | ASSESSInG A nEW VEnTURE’S Financial Strength AnD VIABILITy    291
The major categories of liabilities listed on a balance sheet are the following:
■ Current liabilities: Current liabilities include obligations that are 
 payable within a year, including accounts payable, accrued expenses, 
and the current portion of long-term debt.
■ Long-term liabilities: Long-term liabilities include notes or loans 
that are repayable beyond one year, including liabilities associated with 
purchasing real estate, buildings, and equipment.
■ Owners’ equity: Owners’ equity is the equity invested in the business 
by its owners plus the accumulated earnings retained by the business 
 after paying dividends.
Balance sheets are somewhat deceiving. First, a company’s assets are 
recorded at cost rather than fair market value. A firm may have invested 
$500,000 in real estate several years ago that is worth $1 million today, but 
the value that is reflected on the firm’s current balance sheet is the $500,000 
purchase price rather than the $1 million fair market value. Second, intel-
lectual property, such as patents, trademarks, and copyrights, receive value 
on the balance sheet in some cases and in some cases they don’t, depending 
on the circumstances involved. In many cases, a firm’s intellectual property 
will receive no value on its balance sheet even though it may be very valuable 
from a practical standpoint.15 Third, intangible assets, such as the amount of 
training a firm has provided to its employees and the value of its brand, are 
not recognized on its balance sheet. Finally, the goodwill that a firm has ac-
cumulated is not reported on its balance sheet, although this may be the firm’s 
single most valuable asset.
The consolidated balance sheet for New Venture Fitness Drinks is shown in 
Table 8.2. Again, multiple years are shown so that trends can be easily spot-
ted. When evaluating a balance sheet, the two primary questions are whether 
a firm has sufficient short-term assets to cover its short-term debts and 
whether it is financially sound overall. There are two calculations that provide 
the answer to the first question. In 2014, the working capital of New Venture 
Fitness Drinks, defined as its current assets minus its current liabilities, was 
$82,500. This number represents the amount of liquid assets the firm has 
available. Its current ratio, which equals the firm’s current assets divided 
by its current liabilities, provides another picture of the relationship between 
its current assets and current liabilities and can tell us more about the firm’s 
ability to pay its short-term debts.
New Venture Fitness Drinks’s current ratio is 3.06, meaning that it has 
$3.06 in current assets for every $1.00 in current liabilities. This is a healthy 
number and provides confidence that the company will be able to meet its 
current liabilities. The company’s trend in this area is also positive. For the 
years 2012, 2013, and 2014, its current ratio has been 2.35, 2.26, and 3.06, 
respectively.
Computing a company’s overall debt ratio will give us the answer to 
the  second question, as it is a means of assessing a firm’s overall financial 
soundness. A company’s debt ratio is computed by dividing its total debt by 
its total assets. The present debt ratio for New Venture Fitness Drinks is 39.7 
percent, meaning that 39.7 percent of its total assets are financed by debt 
and the remaining 60.3 percent by owners’ equity. This is a healthy num-
ber for a young firm. The trend for New Venture Fitness Drinks in this area 
is also encouraging. For the years 2012, 2013, and 2014, its debt ratio has 
been 42.3, 37.4, and 39.7 percent, respectively. These figures indicate that 
over time, the company is relying less on debt to finance its operations. In 
general, less debt creates more freedom for the entrepreneurial firm in terms 
of taking different actions.

one another. Note that the $131,000 net income reported by New Venture 
Fitness Drinks on its 2014 income statement shows up as the difference be-
tween its 2014 and 2013 retained earnings on its 2014 balance sheet. This 
number would have been different if New Venture Fitness Drinks had paid 
dividends to its stockholders, but it paid no dividends in 2014. The company 
retained all of its $131,000 in earnings.
Statement of Cash Flows  The statement of cash flows summarizes the 
changes in a firm’s cash position for a specified period of time and details why 
the change occurred. The statement of cash flows is similar to a month-end 

CHAPTER 8 | ASSESSInG A nEW VEnTURE’S Financial Strength AnD VIABILITy    293
bank statement. It reveals how much cash is on hand at the end of the month 
as well as how the cash was acquired and spent during the month.
The statement of cash flows is divided into three separate activities: oper-
ating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. These activities, 
which are explained in the following list, are the activities from which a firm 
obtains and uses cash:
■ Operating activities: Operating activities include net income (or loss), 
depreciation, and changes in current assets and current liabilities other 
than cash and short-term debt. A firm’s net income, taken from its in-
come statement, is the first line on the corresponding period’s cash flow 
statement.
■ Investing activities: Investing activities include the purchase, sale, 
or investment in fixed assets, such as real estate, equipment, and 
buildings.
■ Financing activities: Financing activities include cash raised during 
the period by borrowing money or selling stock and/or cash used during 
the period by paying dividends, buying back outstanding stock, or buying 
back outstanding bonds.
Interpreting and analyzing cash flow statements takes practice. On the 
statement, the uses of cash are recorded as negative figures (which are shown 
by placing them in parentheses) and the sources of cash are recorded as posi-
tive figures. An item such as depreciation is shown as a positive figure on the 
statement of cash flows because it was deducted from net income on the 
income statement but was not a cash expenditure. Similarly, a decrease in 
accounts payable shows up as a negative figure on the cash flow statement 
because the firm used part of its cash to reduce its accounts payable balance 
from one period to the next.
The statement of cash flows for New Venture Fitness Drinks is shown in 
Table 8.3. As a management tool, it is intended to provide perspective on the 
following questions: Is the firm generating excess cash that could be used to 
pay down debt or returned to stockholders in the form of dividends? Is the firm 
generating enough cash to fund its investment activities from earnings, or is 
it relying on lenders or investors? Is the firm generating sufficient cash to pay 
down its short-term liabilities, or are its short-term liabilities increasing as the 
result of an insufficient amount of cash?
Again, a multi period statement is created so that trends can easily be 
spotted. A large increase in a firm’s cash balance is not necessarily a good 
sign. It could mean that the firm is borrowing heavily, is not paying down its 
short-term liabilities, or is accumulating cash that could be put to work for a 
more productive purpose. On the other hand, it is almost always prudent for a 
young firm to have a healthy cash balance.
Table 8.3 shows the consolidated statement of cash flows for New Venture 
Fitness Drinks for two years instead of three because it takes three years of 
balance sheets to produce two years of cash flow statements. The statements 
show that New Venture Fitness Drinks is funding its investment activities from 
a combination of debt and earnings while at the same time it is slowly decreas-
ing its accounts receivable and inventory levels (which is good—these items are 
major drains on a company’s cash flow). It is also steadily increasing its cash 
on hand. These are encouraging signs for a new venture.
ratio analysis  The most practical way to interpret or make sense of a 
firm’s historical financial statements is through ratio analysis. Table 8.4 is 
a summary of the ratios used to evaluate New Venture Fitness Drinks dur-
ing the time period covered by the previously provided financial statements.

The ratios are divided into profitability ratios, liquidity ratios, and overall 
financial stability ratios. These ratios provide a means of interpreting the 
historical financial statements for New Venture Fitness Drinks and provide a 
starting point for forecasting the firm’s financial performance and capabili-
ties for the future.
Comparing a Firm’s Financial results to industry Norms 
Comparing its financial results to industry norms helps a firm determine how 
it stacks up against its competitors and if there are any financial “red flags” re-
quiring attention. This type of comparison works best for firms that are of sim-
ilar size, so the results should be interpreted with caution by new firms. Many 
sources provide industry-related information. For example, both Hoover’s 
premium service and BizMiner provide industry norms to which a new firm 
can compare itself and are typically free of charge if accessed via a university 
library. BizMiner (www.bizminer.com) is particularly good for providing com-
parison data for private firms. Several suggestions for obtaining comparison 
data for private firms are provided in Chapter 3.

Forecasts
As depicted in Figure 8.2, the analysis of a firm’s historical financial statement 
is followed by the preparation of forecasts. Forecasts are predictions of a firm’s 
future sales, expenses, income, and capital expenditures. A firm’s forecasts pro-
vide the basis for its pro forma financial statements. A well-developed set of pro 
forma financial statements helps a firm create accurate budgets, build financial 
plans, and manage its finances in a proactive rather than a reactive manner.
As mentioned earlier, completely new firms typically base their forecasts on 
a good-faith estimate of sales and on industry averages (based on a percent-
age of sales) or the experiences of similar start-ups for cost of goods sold and 
other expenses. As a result, a completely new firm’s forecast should be pre-
ceded in its business plan by an explanation of the sources of the numbers for 
the forecast and the assumptions used to generate them. This explanation is 
called an assumptions sheet, as mentioned in Chapter 6. Investors typically 
study assumptions sheets like hawks to make sure the numbers contained in 
the forecasts and the resulting financial projections are realistic. For example, 
the assumptions sheet for a new venture may say that its forecasts are based 
on selling 500 units of its new product the first year, 1,000 units the second 
year, and 1,500 units the third year, and that its cost of goods sold will remain 
stable (meaning that it will stay fixed at a certain percentage of net sales) over 
the three-year period. It’s up to the reader of the plan to determine if these 
numbers are realistic.16 If the reader feels they are not, then the credibility of 
the entire plan is called into question.
sales Forecast
A sales forecast is a projection of a firm’s sales for a specified period (such 
as a year), though most firms forecast their sales for two to five years into the 
future.17 It is the first forecast developed and is the basis for most of the other

forecasts.18 A sales forecast for an existing firm is based on (1) its record of 
past sales, (2) its current production capacity and product demand, and (3) any 
factor or factors that will affect its future production capacity and product de-
mand. To demonstrate how a sales forecast works, Figure 8.3 is a graph of the 
past sales and the forecasted future sales for New Venture Fitness Drinks. The 
company’s sales increased at a rate of about 26 percent per year from 2012 to 
2014 as the company became established and more people became aware of its 
brand. In forecasting its sales for 2015 and 2016, the company took into con-
sideration the following factors:
■ The fitness craze in America continues to gain momentum and should con-
tinue to attract new people to try its fitness drinks.
■ The interest in intramural sports, especially soccer, baseball, and softball, 
should continue to provide a high level of traffic for its restaurants, which 
are located near large intramural sports complexes.
■ The company expanded from a single location in 2011 to two locations 
in 2014 (the second restaurant was added in November 2014), and this 
should increase its capacity to serve fitness drinks by approximately 50 
percent. The second restaurant is smaller than the first and is located in 
an area where the company is not as well known. The company will be 
actively promoting the new restaurant but knows it will take time to win 
market share.
■ The general economy in the city where the company is located is flat—it is 
neither growing nor shrinking. However, layoffs are rumored for a larger 
employer near the location of the new restaurant.
The combination of these factors results in a forecast of a 40 percent in-
crease in sales from 2014 to 2015 and a 25 percent increase in sales from 
2015 to 2016. It is extremely important for a company such as New Venture 
Drinks to forecast future sales as accurately as possible. If it overestimates the 
demand for its products, it might get stuck with excess inventory and spend 
too much on overhead. If it underestimates the demand for its product, it 
might have to turn away business, and some of its potential customers might 
get into the habit of buying other firms’ fitness drinks.
Note that sophisticated tools are available to help firms project their fu-
ture sales. One approach is to use regression analysis, which is a statistical 
technique used to find relationships between variables for the purpose of pre-
dicting future values.19 For example, if New Venture Fitness Drinks felt that 
its future sales were a function of its advertising expenditures, the number of

people who participate in intramural sports at the sports complexes near its 
restaurants, and the price of its drinks, it could predict future sales using re-
gression analysis as long as it had historical data for each of these variables. If 
the company used simpler logic and felt that its future sales would increase a 
certain percentage over its current sales, regression analysis could be used to 
generate a more precise estimate of future sales than was predicted from the 
information contained in Figure 8.3. For a new firm that has limited years of 
“annual data,” monthly data could be used to project sales.
Forecast of costs of sales and other items
After completing its sales forecast, a firm must forecast its cost of sales (or cost 
of goods sold) and the other items on its income statement. The most common 
way to do this is to use the percent-of-sales method, which is a method for ex-
pressing each expense item as a percentage of sales.20 For example, in the case 
of New Venture Fitness Drinks, its cost of sales has averaged 47.5 percent over 
the past two years. In 2014, its sales were $586,600 and its cost of sales was 
$268,900. The company’s sales are forecast to be $821,200 in 2015. Therefore, 
based on the percent-of-sales method, its cost of sales in 2015 will be $390,000, 
or 47.5 percent of projected sales. The same procedure could be used to fore-
cast the cost of each expense item on the company’s income statement.
Once a firm completes its forecast using the percent-of-sales method, it 
usually goes through its income statement on an item-by-item basis to see if 
there are opportunities to make more precise forecasts. For example, a firm 
can closely estimate its depreciation expenses, so it wouldn’t be appropriate to 
use the percent-of-sales method to make a forecast for this item. In addition, 
some expense items are not tied to sales. For those items, the firm makes rea-
sonable estimates.
Obviously, a firm must apply common sense in using the percent-of-sales 
method. If a company is implementing cost-cutting measures, for example, it 
might be able to justify projecting a smaller percentage increase in expenses as 
opposed to sales. Similarly, if a firm hires an upper-level manager, such as a 
chief financial officer, toward the end of the year and plans to pay the person 
$100,000 the next year, that $100,000 may not have an immediate impact on 
sales. In this case, the firm’s forecast for administrative expenses may have to 
be adjusted upward beyond what the percent-of-sales method would suggest.
If a firm determines that it can use the percent-of-sales method and it fol-
lows the procedure described previously, then the net result is that each ex-
pense item on its income statement (with the exception of those items that may 
be individually forecast, such as depreciation) will grow at the same rate as 
sales. This approach is called the constant ratio method of forecasting. This 
approach will be used in preparing the pro forma financial statements for New 
Venture Fitness Drinks in the next section.
A summary of the forecasts used to prepare the pro forma financial state-
ments for New Venture Fitness Drinks is provided in Table 8.5.
In addition to computing sales forecasts, when a company like New Venture 
Fitness Drinks considers opening a new restaurant or producing a new prod-
uct, it often calculates a break-even analysis to determine if the proposed 
initiative is feasible. The break-even point for a new restaurant or product is 
the point where total revenue received equals total costs associated with the 
output of the restaurant or the sale of the product.21 In the case of opening a 
new restaurant, New Venture Fitness Drinks could use break-even analysis as 
one way of determining whether the proposed initiative is feasible. The formula 
for break-even analysis is as follows: Total fixed costs/(price – average variable 
costs). In most instances, average variable cost is the same number as average 
cost of goods sold. As a result, if the total fixed cost associated with opening

a new restaurant is $101,000 per year, the average price for a fitness drink is 
$2.75, and the variable cost (or cost of goods sold) for each drink is $1.10, then 
the break-even point for the new restaurant is as follows:
$101,000 (total fixed costs)>($2.75 - $1.10) or $1.65 =  61,212 units
This number means that the new restaurant will have to sell 61,212 
“units,” or fitness drinks, per year to “break even” at the current price of the 
drinks. That number breaks down to the sale of 170 fitness drinks per day, 
on average, based on a 360-day year. To determine whether opening the new 
restaurant is feasible, the managers of New Venture Fitness Drinks would 
compare this number against the historic sales figures for their other restau-
rants, making adjustments as appropriate (e.g., the new restaurant may have 
a better or worse location than the existing restaurants). If selling 170 fitness 
drinks per day seems unrealistic, then the managers of New Fitness Drinks 
might opt to not open the new restaurant, or find ways to lower fixed or vari-
able costs or increase revenues. An obvious way to increase revenues is to 
raise the price of the fitness drinks, if that option is realistic given the competi-
tive nature of the marketplace.
pro Forma Financial statements
A firm’s pro forma financial statements are similar to its historical financial 
statements except that they look forward rather than track the past. New ven-
tures typically offer pro forma statements, but well-managed established firms 
also maintain these statements as part of their routine financial planning pro-
cess and to help prepare budgets. The preparation of pro forma statements 
also helps firms rethink their strategies and make adjustments if necessary. 
For example, if the pro forma statements predict a downturn in profitability, a 
firm can make operational changes, such as increasing prices or decreasing ex-
penses, to help prevent the decrease in profitability from actually happening.22

300    PART 3 | MoVInG FRoM An IDEA To An EnTREPREnEURIAL FIRM
A firm’s pro forma financial statements should not be prepared in isola-
tion. Instead, they should be created in conjunction with the firm’s overall 
planning activities. For example, it’s often critical to have a good sense of 
how quickly a firm can raise money. Sometimes a firm has a good product 
or service, good demand, and knows how much capital it needs to maintain 
a sufficient cash flow, but it can’t raise the money in time. This is what hap-
pened to Wise Acre Frozen Treats, as illustrated in this chapter’s “What Went 
Wrong?” feature. The Wide Acre Frozen Treats case is a good example of how 
one aspect of financial management (i.e., raising money) can have a dramatic 
impact on another aspect of financial management (i.e., maintaining a suf-
ficient cash flow).
The following sections explain the development of pro forma financial 
statements for New Venture Fitness Drinks.
pro Forma income statement
Once a firm forecasts its future income and expenses, the creation of the pro 
forma income statement is merely a matter of plugging in the numbers. Table 
8.6 shows the pro forma income statement for New Venture Fitness Drinks. 
Recall that net sales for New Venture Fitness Drinks are forecast to increase 
by 40 percent from 2014 to 2015 and by 25 percent from 2015 to 2016, and 
that its cost of sales has averaged 47.5 percent of net sales. In the pro forma 
income statement, the constant ratio method of forecasting is used to forecast 
the cost of sales and general and administrative expenses, meaning that these 
items are projected to remain at the same percentage of sales in the future as 
they were in the past (which is the mathematical equivalent of saying that they 
will increase at the same rate of sales). Depreciation, other income, and several 
other items that are not directly tied to sales are figured separately—using rea-
sonable estimates. The most dramatic change is “other income,” which jumps 
significantly from 2014 to 2015. New Venture Fitness Drinks anticipates a sig-
nificant increase in this category as the result of the renegotiation of a licens-
ing agreement for one of its fitness drinks that is sold by another company.
Pro forma financial 
 statements look forward 
rather than backwards. 
They help entrepreneurs 
establish budgets and 
plan for the future.

W
hen Jim Picariello started Wise Acre Frozen 
Treats, no other company was making organic 
popsicles from unrefined sweeteners. Working 
out of a makeshift kitchen in 2006, Picariello devel-
oped his recipes using maple syrup and honey. He 
worked alone for a year and a half before hiring his first 
employee. About that time, his frozen popsicles re-
ally took off; by 2008, Wise Acre Frozen Treats had 15 
employees, a 3,000-square-foot manufacturing facility, 
and was distributing its product to natural food stores 
and supermarkets across the East Coast. The company 
was awarded a contract to distribute to the West Coast. 
Then, abruptly, Wise Acre Frozen Treats failed. What 
went wrong?
Here’s what happened. In its first year, Wise Acre 
Frozen Treats grew at a measured pace. It was filling 
orders for eight stores for a few hundred dollars each, 
nothing Picariello couldn’t handle. Early in its second year, 
it won the “Most Innovative Product” award out of more 
than 2,000 products at a large food show called Expo 
East. That award increased Wise Acre Frozen Treats’s pro-
file, and it landed a contract with United national Foods, 
a huge national distributor, for freezer space in premier 
stores like Whole Foods and Wegmans. At that time, it 
seemed that things couldn’t have worked out better.
Picariello knew he’d need to raise capital to cover the 
increased pace of activity. operating expenses includ-
ing labor, equipment, ingredients, packaging material, 
insurance, and design and marketing would all increase. 
Picariello obtained $300,000 from a local bank and 
$200,000 from an investment firm. But because Wise 
Acre Frozen Treats had so many orders to fill, it needed 
about $1 million to make things work. Picariello ap-
proached a local high-net-worth individual who agreed 
to invest $1 million, and who assured Picariello that he 
could put together the money quickly. Based on that 
promise, Picariello placed orders for the additional mate-
rial and equipment Wise Acre Frozen Treats needed.
The timing of the investor’s promise couldn’t have 
been worse. In short order, the economy tanked and the 
investor reneged on his promise. At that point, Picariello 
characterized his life as a mad dash between running 
the company and meeting with potential investors. In 
regard to potential investors, Wise Acre Frozen Treats 
found itself in somewhat of a no-man’s-land. Although 
its future was bright, the entrepreneurial venture wasn’t 
big enough yet for investors to take notice. As time went 
on, serious cash flow difficulties kicked in. According to 
a blog post that Picariello wrote about Wise Acre Frozen 
Treats’s failure, the company was burning through about 
$30,000 a month at its peak but didn’t have the capital 
to back it up.
In retrospect, many things lined up well for Wise 
Acre Frozen Treats. It had a product that sold well, it 
had national distribution, and it had a business plan that 
indicated that it would take about two years for the com-
pany to break even. Its fatal flaw was that it didn’t raise 
the money it needed before it hit major milestones, like 
getting the big orders. It literally went from eight stores to 
dozens to hundreds in a matter of months. From a cash 
standpoint, the firm lacked what it needed to keep up 
with its growth.
Questions for Critical Thinking
 1. What lessons can be learned from Jim Picariello’s 
agreement with the high-net-worth individual, who 
agreed to invest $1 million in Wise Acre Frozen Treats 
and then reneged on the agreement when the econ-
omy turned sour?
 2. Why is it that a company can grow too fast? If Wise 
Acre Frozen Treats significantly increased its sales, 
why wouldn’t its increased income provide more than 
enough cash to even out its cash flow?
 3. Besides cash flow difficulties, what other problems can 
a firm experience by growing too quickly?
 4. If Jim Picariello starts another company, make a list of 
the things you think he’ll do differently as a result of his 
Wise Acre Frozen Treats experience.

Be Careful What You Wish For: How Growing Too Quickly Overwhelmed One 
Company’s Cash Flow
pro Forma Balance sheet
The pro forma balance sheet provides a firm a sense of how its activities 
will affect its ability to meet its short-term liabilities and how its finances will 
evolve over time. It can also quickly show how much of a firm’s money will 
be tied up in accounts receivable, inventory, and equipment. The pro forma 
balance sheet is also used to project the overall financial soundness of a com-
pany. For example, a firm may have a very aggressive set of pro forma income

statements that project rapidly increasing growth and profitability. However, 
if this rapid growth and profitability push the firm’s debt ratio to 75 percent 
(which is extremely high), investors may conclude that there is too much risk 
involved for the firm to be an attractive investment.
The pro forma balance sheet for New Venture Fitness Drinks is shown in 
Table 8.7. Note that the company’s projected change in retained earnings each 
year is consistent with its projected net income for the same period on its pro 
forma income statements. The same approach was used to construct the pro 
forma balance sheets as the pro forma income statements. For each item listed 
under current assets and current liabilities, the item’s historical percentage of 
sales was used to project its future percentage of sales. Several of the numbers 
were adjusted slightly upward, such as inventory levels and accounts payable, 
to reflect the potential impact of the opening of the second restaurant.
In regard to property, plant, and equipment, New Venture Fitness Drinks 
plans to invest $100,000 in 2015 and $275,000 in 2016. The pro forma bal-
ance sheet shows a corresponding increase in valuation in this category for 
2015 and 2016, respectively. The company’s projected long-term debt for 2015 
and 2016 reflects changes resulting from principal reductions from cash flow 
and increased borrowing to fund the property, plant, and equipment pur-
chases just mentioned. These transactions are reflected in the pro forma state-
ment of cash flows for New Venture Fitness Drinks.
pro Forma statement of cash Flows
The pro forma statement of cash flows shows the projected flow of cash into 
and out of the company during a specified period. The most important func-
tion of the pro forma statement of cash flows is to project whether the firm will

have sufficient cash to meet its needs. As with the historical statement of cash 
flows, the pro forma statement of cash flows is broken into three activities: op-
erating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. Close attention 
is typically paid to the section on operating activities because it shows how 
changes in the company’s accounts receivable, accounts payable, and inven-
tory levels affect the cash that it has available for investing and finance activi-
ties. If any of these items increases at a rate that is faster than the company’s 
annual increase in sales, it typically raises a red flag. For example, an increase 
in accounts receivable, which is money that is owed to a company by its cus-
tomers, decreases the amount of cash that it has available for investment or 

304    PART 3 | MoVInG FRoM An IDEA To An EnTREPREnEURIAL FIRM
finance activities. If accounts receivable gets out of hand, it may jeopardize a 
company’s ability to fund its growth or service its debt.
The pro forma consolidated statement of cash flows for New Venture 
Fitness Drinks is shown in Table 8.8. The figures appearing on the statement 
come directly, or are calculated directly, from the pro forma income statement 
and the pro forma balance sheet. The one exception is that the last line of each 
statement of cash flows, which reflects the company’s cash balance at the end 
of the period, becomes the first line of the company’s balance sheet for the next 
period. The pro forma statement of cash flows for New Venture Fitness Drinks 
shows healthy cash balances at the end of each projected period and shows 
that investment activities are being funded more by earnings than by debt. 
This scenario reflects a company that is generating sufficient cash flow to fund 
the majority of its growth without overly relying on debt or investment capital.
In regard to dividends, the pro forma statement of cash flows shows that 
New Venture Fitness Drinks is not planning to pay a dividend to its stockhold-
ers in 2015 and 2016. Recall that New Venture Fitness Drinks is incorporated 
and has stockholders even though it is not traded on an organized exchange. 
If New Venture Fitness Drinks were planning to pay a dividend, the projected 
dividend payments would show up under financing activities and would

reduce the amount of cash available for investing and financing activities. It is 
common for a new firm to invest the majority of its cash in activities that fund 
its growth, such as property, plant, and equipment purchases, rather than 
pay dividends.
ratio analysis
The same financial ratios used to evaluate a firm’s historical financial state-
ments should be used to evaluate the pro forma financial statements. This 
work is completed so the firm can get a sense of how its projected financial 
performance compares to its past performance and how its projected activities 
will affect its cash position and its overall financial soundness.
The historical financial ratios and projected ratios for New Venture Fitness 
Drinks are shown in Table 8.9. The profitability ratios show a slight decline 
from the historical period to the projected. This indicates that the projected 
increase in assets and corresponding sales will not produce income quite as 
efficiently as has been the case historically. Still, the numbers are strong, and 
no dramatic changes are projected.
The liquidity ratios show a consistently healthy ratio of current assets to 
current liabilities, suggesting that the firm should be able to cover its short-
term liabilities without difficulty. The overall financial stability ratios indicate 
promising trends. The debt ratio drops from an actual of 39.7 percent in 2014 
to a projected 31.8 percent in 2016. The debt-to-equity ratio shows an even 
more dramatic drop, indicating that an increasing portion of the firm’s assets 
is being funded by equity rather than debt.
In summary, it is extremely important for a firm to understand its financial 
position at all times and for new ventures to base their financial projections on 
solid numbers. As mentioned earlier, regardless of how successful a firm is in 
other areas, it must succeed financially to remain strong and viable.

Chapter Summary
and a statement of cash flow. An income 
statement reflects the results of a firm’s 
operations over a specified period of time. 
It records all the revenues and expenses 
for the given period and shows whether 
the firm is making a profit or is experi-
encing a loss. A balance sheet is a snap-
shot of a company’s assets, its liabilities, 
and owners’ equity. While income state-
ments cover a specified period of time, a 
balance sheet is a snapshot of the firm 
at a specific point in time. A statement of 
cash flows summarizes the changes in a 
firm’s cash position for a specified period 
of time and details why the changes oc-
curred. This statement allows a firm to 
understand how much cash it has on 
hand and how its cash was used over a 
period of time.
 lO6. Forecasts are predictions of a firm’s future 
sales, expenses, income, and capital ex-
penditures. A firm’s forecasts provide the 
basis for its pro forma financial statements. 
When developed effectively, forecasts pro-
vide the foundation for a firm to prepare its 
future-oriented pro forma financial state-
ments. Completely new firms typically base 
their forecasts on a good-faith estimate of 
sales and on industry averages (based on 
a percentage of sales) or the experiences of 
similar start-ups for cost of goods sold and 
other expenses. Once a firm has completed 
its sales forecast, it must forecast its costs 
of sales as well as the other items on its 
income statement. The most common way 
to do this is to use the percent-of-sales 
method, which is a method for expressing 
each expense item as a percentage of sales.
 lO7. Pro forma financial statements are simi-
lar to historical financial statements ex-
cept that they look forward rather than 
backward. Preparing pro forma statements 
helps entrepreneurs think about the qual-
ity of the strategies being implemented 
by their firm and to make adjustments to 
those strategies if necessary. Considered 
to be part of a firm’s planning efforts, firms 
prepare a pro forma income statement, a 
pro forma balance sheet, and a pro forma 
statement of cash flows to help them antic-
ipate and prepare for future activities and 
their anticipated outcomes.
 lO1. To pursue an opportunity and to turn that 
pursuit into a viable venture, entrepreneurs 
require financial capital. Financial manage-
ment deals with this reality. More specifi-
cally, financial management is concerned 
with two activities: raising money and man-
aging a company’s finances in a way that 
achieves the highest rate of return.
 lO2. Profitability, liquidity, efficiency, and sta-
bility are the four main financial objectives 
of entrepreneurial firms. Profitability is the 
ability of a firm to earn a profit, liquidity is 
the ability of a company to meet or satisfy 
its short-term obligations, efficiency deals 
with how productively a firm uses its as-
sets relative to its revenue and profits, and 
stability is the strength and vigor of the 
firm’s overall financial standing.
 lO3. The process of financial management 
includes the activities a firm takes to 
determine if its financial objectives are 
being met. Several documents are foun-
dational to an entrepreneur’s efforts to 
assess the degree to which a firm’s finan-
cial  objectives are being satisfied. These 
documents, as follows, are prepared regu-
larly: (1) financial statements (a written 
report that describes a firm’s health from 
a quantitative perspective), (2) forecasts 
(which are estimates of a firm’s future 
income and expenses, based on its past 
performance, current situation, and its 
future plans), and (3) budgets (which are 
itemized forecasts of a firm’s income, ex-
penses, and capital requirements).
 lO4. Historical financial statements reflect past 
performance. Typically, these documents 
are prepared on a quarterly and an-
nual basis. The Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC) requires that pub-
licly traded firms prepare and submit 
these documents. Pro forma financial 
statements are projections for expected 
performance in future periods. These 
 projections are based on forecasts and are 
usually completed for two or three years 
into the future. Unlike historical finan-
cial statements, firms are not required to 
make their pro forma statements publicly 
available.
 lO5. Historical financial statements include 
an income statement, a balance sheet,

Review Questions

308    PART 3 | MoVInG FRoM An IDEA To An EnTREPREnEURIAL FIRM
 8-21. Kirsten, a friend of yours, plans to open 
a fashion boutique that will sell women’s 
clothing and accessories. She told you that 
she leafed through several books on how 
to prepare forecasts and pro forma finan-
cial statements but that the books were 
geared toward existing firms that have 
several years of historical financial state-
ments on which to base their projections. 
If Kirsten asked for your advice about how 
to prepare forecasts for a completely new 
women’s fashion boutique, what would 
you tell her?
 8-22. Suppose a friend of yours showed you the 
pro forma income statements for his start-
up and exclaimed excitedly that during 
the first three years of operations his firm 
will make a net income of $150,000 per 
year, which is just the amount of money 
($450,000) the firm will need to pay off a 
three-year loan. Given your study of this 
chapter, why is it that your friend may 
not actually have $450,000 in cash, even 
though his pro forma income statements 
say that he will earn that amount of 
money?
 8-23. Sammy Hench has savings of $50,000 
and is planning to invest in a business 
that will give him good returns. For the 
last six months, he has been investigat-
ing all types of business ventures and 
has  finally decided to buy over an existing 
company. However, Sammy does not have 
any entrepreneurial or financial back-
ground that can assist him in making the 
right decision. His friends have advised 
him to look at a potential business’s his-
torical financial statements. Is this advice 
helpful? How can you assist Sammy and 
explain to him why should he do so?
 8-24. In groups of three, visit a business out-
let in your vicinity. With the owner or the 
manager’s consent, prepare a sales fore-
cast for the years 2015 and 2016 based on 
the outlet’s sales from 2012 to 2014. You 
may present the answer in class.
 8-25. As a lecturer for the class on Entrepre-
neurship Studies, you have been invited 
by the Business Society to share your 
subject knowledge with the club members. 
They have requested you to present on 
the importance of understanding financial 
management of an entrepreneurial firm. 
Share some of the key points to be high-
lighted during your presentation.
 8-26. Jorge Martinez is thinking about buy-
ing an existing printing business and has 
been carefully studying the records of the 
business to get a good handle on its his-
torical financial performance. Jorge heard 
that you are taking a class in entrepre-
neurship and asks you, “What suggestions 
do you have for me to make the best use of 
this financial information (i.e., three years 
of audited income statements, balance 
sheets, and statements of cash flow)?” 
What suggestions would you give Jorge for 
making the maximum use of the financial 
statements?
 8-27. A friend came to you for advice. She 
needs to prepare a business plan for her 
 potential investor. She has prepared a 
very  detailed financial plan and is quite 
confident of it. However, she is not sure 
of what is to be included in the sec-
tion on financial objectives of her firm. 
Advise her.
 8-28. What items on the left side (or top) and 
what items on the right side (or bottom) 
of a firm’s balance sheet should receive 
the greatest scrutiny? In regard to each 
of these items, what are the most impor-
tant factors that a new venture should 
focus on to maintain its overall financial 
health?
 8-29. Suppose a colleague of yours is gearing up 
to write a business plan for a business she 
intends to start. She told you she plans to 
prepare the financial statements first to 
get that job out of the way before she tack-
les the rest of the plan. What is the flaw in 
your colleague’s logic as described to you?
Application Questions

CHAPTER 8 | ASSESSInG A nEW VEnTURE’S Financial Strength AnD VIABILITy    309
Business idea: Make a specialty soda that is made 
entirely from just fresh-squeezed fruit juice, cane sugar, 
and carbonated water rather than sweetened syrup, 
juice concentrates, and preservatives.
pitch: The knocks leveled against traditional sodas, 
like Coke and Pepsi, have created a market for small, 
specialty sodas such as Jones’s and Boylan’s. Still, most 
specialty sodas are made from sweetened syrups, and 
in many ways they are not that dissimilar from the major 
brands. Spindrift Soda provides a healthy and refreshing 
alternative. It is a carbonated beverage that is made from 
triple-purified sparkling water, fresh-squeezed fruit or 
berry puree (pulp and all), and cane sugar. Unlike almost 
every other soda on the market, it contains no syrups, no 
juice concentrates, no additives, and no preservatives. 
It’s also light, bright, and tastes great.
Spindrift Soda is made every four to six weeks in small 
batches, and is shipped cold. It took nearly a year for 
Spindrift’s founder, Bill Creelman, to figure out how to 
make it. Lots of people make fresh-squeezed juices on a 
small scale, and serve them to their families or sell them 
at a farmer’s market. The challenge was to incorporate 
fresh-squeezed juices into a carbonated beverage at 
scale. Temperature-sensitive juices can’t sit in vats the 
way syrups can. They have to be delivered in small jugs, 
stored properly, and then opened at the last minute 
and mixed in by hand. They’re also hard to distribute 
to stores. Most sodas ship warm, like in the Coke or 
Pepsi trucks you see on the road. Spindrift Soda ships 
cold, which preserves its freshness. Creelman found dis-
tributors of fish, produce, and cheese willing to carry his 
product on their trucks. An added benefit of using fresh 
distributors is that they deliver daily, which allows them 
to quickly replenish Spindrift Soda inventories in stores 
when the stores are running low.
Spindrift’s mission is to change how America experi-
ences soda. Spindrift sodas come in six flavors including 
Blackberry, Sparking orange Mango, Sparkling Lemonade, 
Sparkling Grapefruit, Cranberry Raspberry, and Half and 
Half. Spindrift also makes three flavors of bottled water 
including Tangerine, Lemon, and Raspberry Lime. Its bev-
erages are truly fresh. For example, Spindrift Sparkling 
Grapefruit contains the following ingredients: triple-filtered 
sparkling water, fresh-squeezed juices (fresh pink grape-
fruit juice, fresh lemon juice), cane sugar, natural flavor, 
fruit, and vegetable juice for color. now that’s a list of ingre-
dients that anyone can feel good about serving their family.
 8-30. Based on the material covered in this chapter, what 
questions would you ask the firm’s founders before 
making your funding decision? What answers would

Business idea: Create a sushi restaurant that allows 
customers to “build their own sushi” by allowing them to 
select their own kind of wrap, rice, veggies, proteins, and 
toppings.
pitch: People who like sushi have two choices. They 
can go to a fancy sushi restaurant and pay a fancy bill. 
or they can go to a grocery store and buy sushi that 
is supposedly made daily. now there is a third option. 
How Do you Roll? is a fast-casual sushi restaurant that 
combines the quality of a high-end restaurant with the 
convenience of a grocery store.
How Do you Roll? is the brainchild of two brothers, yuen 
yung and Peter yung. Both grew up in the restaurant 
industry. Their parents had several Chinese restaurants, 
and at the tender age of eight or nine they both started 
working in their parents’ restaurants. How Do you Roll? 
launched with a single store in Austin, Texas. It lets the 
customer be the chef by allowing customers to pick their 
own ingredients. The customer approaches a counter 
and is led through four steps:
Step 1  Choose your Wrap: Traditional (seaweed) or 
modern (soy)
Step 2  Eat your Veggies: Choose up to three healthy 
vegetables
Step 3  Stuff your Roll: Choose one or more of our 
fresh meats
Step 4  Top It off: Indulge in one or more of our spe-
cialty toppings or sides
Through this process customers personalize their sushi 
rolls. The meal, which consists of a six-piece sushi roll and 
a fountain drink, costs an average of $8 to $11. How Do 
you Roll’s business model is also designed to make sushi 
accessible to people who won’t touch raw ingredients or

even fish. There is cooked chicken and beef available as 
substitutes. Along with sushi, each restaurant also sells 
miso soup, seaweed salad, and green tea ice cream. It is 
an experience that is totally unique in the sushi industry. 
It also provides fast-casual food patrons an alternative to 
the standard fare of burgers and chicken sandwiches.
How Do you Roll? is growing via franchising. It cur-
rently has eight franchise units and two company-owned 
stores. It has penned several development agreements, 
which may add up to 70 additional franchise units over 
the next 10 years. According to the company, it costs 
between $304,295 and $508,780 to open a How Do you 
Roll? restaurant. The initial franchise fee is $30,000, and 
the ongoing royalty is 7 percent of gross sales.
In spring 2013, yuen yung and Peter yung pitched the 
business on the popular ABC show Shark tank. Along 
with a $1 million investment from shark Kevin o’Leary, 
yung said restaurant sales jumped 30 percent. In addi-
tion, he and his brother received more than 600 inquiries 
from potential franchisees interested in opening How Do 
you Roll? restaurants.

introduction
Fundbox is an entrepreneurial start-up that offers 12-
week loans to small businesses. The loans are tied to 
specific invoices that the businesses have outstanding. 
Payment for the loans (including principle, interest, and 
fees) is deducted from a company’s bank account in 12 
equal amounts on a weekly basis. once the money for 
the invoice comes in, the loan can be paid in full. There 
is no penalty for early payment.
Fundbox was launched in 2012 by yuval Ariav, Eyal 
Shinar, and Tomer Michael, who are technological inno-
vators and financial professionals. The firm’s mission is 
to offer small businesses a common-sense approach to 
cash-flow management.
the problem
Almost all small businesses experience cash flow 
shortfalls. Think of how business works. Businesses 
often win a contract, purchase the materials and sup-
plies that are needed to produce the firm’s product or 
service, pay employees, and then have to wait 30 to 
60 days to receive payment from the customer. This 
scenario causes even healthy businesses to be short 
on cash at times. There are two traditional solutions to 
the problem. The first is to maintain a line of credit at 
a bank. A line of credit allows a business to borrow up 
to a certain amount of money and pay it down when 
money comes in. The problem with this solution is that 
banks are increasingly reluctant to establish lines of 
credit for small businesses. Banks also don’t like to 
make short-term loans for specific amounts. The sec-
ond solution is invoice factoring. With invoice factoring, 
a company sells its invoices to a factoring company in 
exchange for a lump sum of money (say $4,500 for a 
$5,000 invoice). The factoring company then proceeds 
to collect the money from the company’s customer. 
Many businesses don’t like this alternative because it 
involves a third party having a direct relationship with 
their customer. If the factoring company becomes 
 aggressive in trying to collect the invoice, it could 
 affect the business’s relationship with its customer.
To further complicate things, Days Sales outstanding 
(DSo), or the time between when a business issues an 
invoice and the payment is received, has been increasing 
across the board in recent years.
Fundbox
Fundbox offers a novel solution to the problem. When 
an invoice comes in, it will issue a 12-week loan for the 
amount of the invoice. Because the loan is matched 
with a specific receivable, it prevents the repayment of 
the loan from creating a new cash flow problem for the 
business. The interest rate on the loan is tied to both the 
creditworthiness of the borrower and the company that 
owes the amount on the invoice. This practice encour-
ages borrowers to borrow money on invoices that they 
are confident will be paid. For example, say a business 
does $10,000 of work for Home Depot. It knows Home 
Depot will pay the invoice, but Home Depot may operate 
on a net 30 or net 60 day payment schedule (meaning 
that it has 30 days or 60 days to make the payment). If 
the business has an account with Fundbox, it could get 
the $10,000 right away, minus Fundbox’s fee. Weekly 
payments would start immediately. When Home Depot 
paid the invoice, the loan to Fundbox would be paid in 
full. This scenario allows a business to get its money

sooner rather than later and avoid short-term gaps in 
its cash flow. The interest rate for Fundbox’s service 
varies. According to a review published by the FitSmall 
Business blog, rates range from 0.7 percent to 3 percent 
per month, with the typical borrower at about 2 percent 
per month. About 40 percent of businesses that apply 
are accepted by Fundbox.
Fundbox uses sophisticated data analytics to build 
a picture of a potential borrower’s overall financial health 
and likelihood of repayment. Fundbox doesn’t talk much 
about how this actually works. It is a core feature of their 
business and considered to be a trade secret.
partnerships with Bookkeeping companies
To make it easy for clients, Fundbox has established 
partnerships with many of the top online bookkeeping 
programs, including Quickbooks, Freshbooks, Xero, and 
Harvest. For Freshbooks, for example, once a business-
person creates a Fundbox account (sign-up is free), it 
can easily be tied to the business’s Freshbooks account. 
When an invoice is entered into Freshbooks, Fundbox 
will analyze all pertinent data to see if a 12-week loan 
to cover the amount of the invoice can be made. The 
business will receive an e-mail message indicating 
whether a loan can be made. The business can then 
evaluate the terms of the loan and either accept or pass 
on the offer. If the offer is accepted, the funds will be 
deposited in the business’s bank account, usually within 
a day. Fundbox only works with the borrower. In the 
Home Depot example provided above, if the borrower 
defaulted on Fundbox’s loan, Fundbox would not try to 
collect the loan amount from Home Depot. Each bor-
rower is given a maximum line of credit from Fundbox, 
so offers will not be made on all invoices.
B2B players
Fundbox’s loans are most suitable for business to busi-
ness (B2B) companies. These are businesses that do 
work for other businesses and issue invoices for the work 
they do. Most business to consumer companies (B2C) are 
paid at the point of sale. For example, when you eat at a 
restaurant or buy a book from Amazon.com, you pay for 
it right away. The B2B category includes freelancers who 
do work for businesses. These are individuals who may 
benefit especially from Fundbox’s service. For example, 
an independent software developer may spend 100 hours 
developing a mobile app for a small business and invoice 
the business $15,000. If the payment terms are net 60, the 
business will have 60 days to pay the bill. Via Fundbox, 
the independent software developer could get his money 
right away. For a freelancer, getting money sooner rather 
than later may make the difference in making rent or pay-
ing a mortgage on time.
Fundbox’s Future
According to TechCrunch, Fundbox launched in stealth 
mode, presumably to test its service and work the bugs 
out. Since it has gone live, it has signed up thousands of 
active users (mostly small businesses) and clears tens of 
thousands of invoices daily in 42 states.
Fundbox is among a growing number of “alterna-
tive lenders” that small businesses are relying on, largely 
because banks have pulled back from small business 
lending. Firms offering services that are similar to those 
provided by Fundbox include Kabbage, onDeck, and 
Lending Club. What is unique about Fundbox is that it 
connects loans to specific invoices, which helps small 
businesses minimize cash flow challenges.
Fundbox has partner-
ships with many of the 
top online bookkeeping 
programs. If a business 
has a Freshbooks account, 
for example, it can easily 
be tied to the business’s 
Fundbox’s account.

The downside to using Fundbox as a fix for cash 
flow gaps is the costs involved. While the loans are 
short-term, an interest rate of between 0.7 percent and 
3 percent per month, as reported above, results in a 
high annual APR. The best thing for any small business 
to do is to check with an accountant regarding the wis-
dom of using Fundbox or a similar product to minimize 
cash flow shortfalls.
Fundbox has raised $17.5 million from a collection 
of venture capitalists to fund and grow its operations.
Discussion Questions
 8-34. Toward the beginning of this case, the following 
statement appears: “Almost all small businesses 
experience cash flow shortfalls.” What is cash flow? 
Why is cash flow so critical to an entrepreneurial 
firm’s success? Why do almost all small businesses 
experience cash flow shortfalls?
 8-35. As explained in this chapter, a firm’s statement of 
cash flows is divided into three separate activities. 
Which of the activities from the statement of cash 
flows would be affected by a firm’s decision to use 
Fundbox’s service? What are some of the potential 
effects of a small entrepreneurial firm’s decision 
to use Fundbox on the components of that firm’s 
statement of cash flows?
 8-36. If Fundbox’s co-founders (yuval Ariav, Eyal Shinar, 
and Tomer Michael) were to ask your advice about 
the importance of pro forma statements to their firm’s 
continuing success, what would you say to them? 
What pro forma statements would you recommend 
the co-founders develop and why?
 8-37. As a young entrepreneur, what lessons about the 
 financial management of a firm can you learn from the 
actions taken by the three cofounders of Fundbox?

introduction
There are many reasons that Dell Inc. has, for the most 
part, been successful over the years. Two of the most 
compelling reasons are its direct sales model and its 
ultra-efficient global supply chain. While a start-up can’t 
quickly emulate what Dell has done, there are lessons 
to be learned from Dell’s experiences that any start-up 
can benefit from. Historically at least, Dell’s approach to 
business made it the preferred computer brand for many 
businesses and consumers. Additionally, the business 
approach has sweetened Dell’s financial statements and 
its ability to make money.
Dell’s hybrid sales approach (combining Direct 
sales and retail sales)
Dell was founded in 1988 touting a direct sales model. 
Rather than selling through stores like Sears and Best 
Buy, Dell sold direct, first over the phone and then via 
the Internet. Its business model not only allowed busi-
nesses and consumers to “customize” their computers, 
but also had profound positive effects on Dell’s supply 
chain and financial activities. For a period of time after 
Dell launched its business model, other PC manufactur-
ers, like Hewlett-Packard, had to forecast demand, build 
computers, ship them to retailers, hope they’d sell, and 
then wait 30 days or more for payment. Dell sidestepped 
all of this via its direct sales model. It received orders, 
built computers, and then shipped them to the buyers 
via UPS or FedEx. There was no “forecasting” of de-
mand because demand was determined in real time, and 
Dell never got stuck with outdated computers because 
it maintained no inventory. Its customers also essentially 
financed its operations by paying in advance.
Dell maintained this business model from 1988 
until 2007, when it shifted its sales strategy. Rather 
than selling exclusively directly, it decided to transition 
to a hybrid model, where it would continue to empha-
size direct sales, but also sell a portion of its product 
line through retailers such as Best Buy, Staples, and 
Walmart. The main reason for the change was that Dell 
was shifting its emphasis from targeting businesses to

targeting businesses, consumers, and international mar-
kets. The thinking was that it needed to have its com-
puters side-by-side with its competitors in consumer 
channels if it hoped to become the preferred computer 
vendor for consumers along with businesses. It was also 
problematic to sell exclusively directly in some interna-
tional markets.
Dell doesn’t disclose the percentage of its sales 
that originate through its website or over the phone (its 
original direct-sales model) versus the percentage of its 
sales that come through retail outlets. It’s clear, though, 
that a significant portion of its sales now occur online 
and over the phone and an increasing percentage of its 
sales are generated through retail outlets.
Dell’s supply chain and manufacturing strategy
Dell’s hybrid sales model has a significant impact on 
its supply chain and manufacturing strategy. It can 
produce computers in a highly efficient manner, be-
cause it does not have to forecast demand and keep 
excess inventory on hand for a large percentage of 
its sales. In fact, when Dell receives an order, via the 
Internet or on the phone, its suppliers are alerted in 
real time and, periodically throughout the day, deliver 
parts to Dell’s assembly facilities where the comput-
ers are assembled, configured, and shipped. It also 
searches on a worldwide basis to find the best com-
binations of quality and cost for parts, which results 
in a complex yet highly efficient supply chain. In fact, 
in his 2005 book the World is Flat, Thomas Friedman 
asked Dell to retrace the supply chain for his lap-
top computer, to determine where it was made, how 
many suppliers were involved, and how it reached his 
front door. The total supply chain for Friedman’s Dell 
Inspiron 600m notebook computer, including suppliers 
of suppliers, involved about 400 companies in north 
America, Europe, and primarily Asia. The computer 
was codesigned in Austin, Texas, in Taiwan by a team 
of Dell engineers, and by a team of Taiwanese note-
book designers (a globally distributed team can work 
24 hours a day). Its final assembly was in a Dell fac-
tory in Penang, Malaysia. It was flown from Penang, 
Malaysia, to nashville, Tennessee, on a China Airlines 
747, the only 747 that lands in nashville, other than 
when Air Force one is in town. It was delivered to 
Friedman’s home via UPS.
To further increase efficiencies and reduce the 
amount of capital it must maintain, Dell is currently tran-
sitioning from this model and is relying increasingly on 
contract manufacturers.
Financial advantages of Dell’s hybrid 
sales approach and its supply chain and 
manufacturing strategy
There are direct financial benefits to Dell’s hybrid sales 
approach and its approach to supply chain management 
and manufacturing. one of the biggest advantages is 
its inventory turnover. Dell turns its inventory over 31.4 
times a year, compared to 13.9 times a year for Hewlett-
Packard and 14.6 times a year for the S&P 500 average. 
Inventory turnover is determined by the following for-
mula (the higher the number the better):
Inventory Turnover =  Cost of Goods Sold
Average Inventories
A high inventory turnover means that a company is 
converting its inventory into cash quickly. Turning its 
 inventory over quickly allows Dell to generate cash 
that’s used to fund its growth, and to not get caught 
with out-of-date inventory. An often-told joke in the 
PC industry is that unsold inventory is like unsold 
 vegetables—it spoils quickly. So maintaining a favor-
able inventory turnover ratio is critical.
Another ratio that’s important is the asset turnover 
ratio. Asset turnover reflects the amount of sales gener-
ated for every dollar’s worth of assets. It’s calculated 
using the following formula (the higher the number the 
better):
Asset Turnover =  Sales
Assets
Dell’s asset turnover ratio is 1.26, compared to 1.06 for 
Hewlett-Packard and 0.34 for the S&P 500 average. 
Asset turnover denotes the amount of sales generated 
for every dollar’s worth of assets. It’s a measure of ef-
ficiency in regard to a firm’s ability to use its assets to 
generate sales.
Along with crunching numbers, savvy manag-
ers assess the impact of their financial strategies on 
their overall goals and levels of customer satisfaction. 
Ultimately, it doesn’t matter that a company has attrac-
tive-looking financial statements if its customers are 
starting to go elsewhere. Dell’s hybrid sales approach 
and its supply chain and manufacturing strategy shine in 
this area too. Because it turns its inventory over quickly, 
it offers its customers the latest technologies rather than 
saddling them with products that likely will soon be out-
dated. It can also pass along the advantages of falling 
component costs quicker than its competitors can.
the Downside of pushing cost savings too Far
Although the majority of the decisions that Dell has 
made have both sweetened its financial statements and 
pleased its customers, Dell is learning the hard way 
that cost savings can be pushed too far. In the early 
1990s, partly in response to the challenges imposed by 
its rapid growth, Dell started outsourcing the majority 
of its call center activities to low-wage countries in Asia 
and Central America. This strategy led to a chorus of 
growing complaints about long wait times for customer 
service calls and poor post-sales support. In response, 
Dell has spent over $100 million to revive its customer 
service, including an effort to increase the percentage 
of full-time Dell employees who staff customer ser-
vice support lines and reduce its use of part-time and 
(continued)

314    PART 3 | MoVInG FRoM An IDEA To An EnTREPREnEURIAL FIRM
contract workers. The jury is still out on whether Dell has 
done enough to stem the tide of customer dissatisfac-
tion. Another downside is that Dell pushes its suppliers 
hard. While most suppliers respond positively, it’s hard 
to gauge the long-term impact in supplier relations by 
Dell’s appearing to assume the role of “taskmaster” in 
its relationships with its suppliers.
It’s also unclear how long Dell’s hybrid sales ap-
proach will maintain an advantage. Although its inven-
tory turnover number is still strong, it’s not as outstand-
ing as it was when Dell sold primarily online and over 
the phone. In 2004, Dell’s inventory turnover was 107.1, 
but it is 31.4 today. Dell also has a formable competi-
tor in Apple. Apple’s inventory turnover is 63.0. It may 
be unfair to compare Dell directly to Apple, given that 
Apple is a more diversified company, but the compari-
son highlights the fact that Dell is no longer a trendsetter 
in inventory management efficiency. Another challenge 
that all computer manufacturers face is a global decline 
in personal computer sales. In slightly different words, 
global declines in computer sales is the reality of the 
day, even for premier firms like Dell, Hewlett-Packard, 
and Apple.
Discussion Questions
 8-38. Investigate the financial ratio of inventory turnover. 
Find current information about Dell (www.hoovers.
com is a good starting place) and report whether its 
inventory turnover is still as impressive as the number 
mentioned in the case. How does Dell’s current in-
ventory turnover ratio compare to that of some of its 
competitors such as Apple and Hewlett-Packard? Do 
the same for Dell’s asset turnover ratio.
 8-39. Locate Dell’s most recent 10-K report and either 
 locate or compute what you believe are the three 
most  important financial ratios for Dell. Are the ratios 
 impressive or do they provide you reason for concern?
 8-40. If you were the CEo of Dell Inc., what expectations 
would you reflect when preparing a pro forma income 
statement for your company?
 8-41. What lessons can a young entrepreneurial firm learn 
from Dell’s experiences?

he idea for Next Big Sound started in Troy Henikoff’s entrepreneurship class 
at Northwestern University. It was 2008, and three of the students in the class, 
Alex White, David Hoffman, and Samir Rayani, hatched an idea for a business 
in the music industry. Rayani and White had met earlier when White 
was running the concert booking group on campus. Rayani’s job 
was to sign off on White’s spending to bring in acts like Flight of 
the Conchords and Kanye West. White and Hoffman’s paths had 
crossed earlier, too, in that they both were organizational change 
majors at Northwestern. In the nearby photo, Alex White is on the 
left, David Hoffman is in the middle, and Samir Rayani is on the right.
The idea was for a fantasy network for music. Users would cre-
ate their own fantasy record label, sign artists they believed would 
become popular, and compete against each other. As part of the 
class, students presented their ideas to venture capitalists. White, 
Hoffman, and Rayani pitched the idea for their fantasy music net-
work, which they called Next Big Sound, and landed $25,000 in seed 
money. The three continued to work on the idea following graduation. 
Next Big Sound gained traction and applied for TechStars. TechStars is a mentorship-
driven business accelerator in Boulder, Colorado, that holds 13-week programs. They 
were turned down. Rather than becoming discouraged, the three stuck with the idea, 
and in the summer of 2008 participated in an accelerator program in Illinois. When the 
application date for TechStars in 2009 rolled around, they decided to give it a second 
try. This time they were accepted. They were the same team with the same idea, but 
this time their product had been built and launched, they had thousands of users, they 
had press (including a feature in The New York Times), and the three had proven that 
they could work together as a team.
In early 2009, White, Hoffman, and Rayani left Chicago for Boulder, reportedly 
making the 1,000-mile trip in Hoffman’s Volkswagen Rabbit. TechStars is a heavily 
mentorship-driven program, so the three had access to high-quality mentors from 
the beginning. They quickly realized that their idea, the fantasy network for music, 
wasn’t sustainable. It just didn’t have a revenue model. That caused the three to 
pivot. They spent a lot of time talking to mentor Jason Mendelson, who is a partner 
in Foundry Group, a Boulder-based venture capital firm. Next Big Sound’s team 
characterizes their TechStars experience as worth its weight in gold. They emerged

from the program with a much sounder business concept and direction for how to 
move forward.
Next Big Sound is now a music analytics company. The premise of the company 
is to mine data to help the music industry make decisions, like whom to bet on in re-
gard to the next big act. For years record sales information and radio play data were 
the only factors available to help music executives discern who the up-and-coming 
bands were. But now there are many sources of data, such as music sites like Spotify 
and Pandora, social networks like Facebook and Twitter, and video-sharing sites like 
YouTube, that help identify which songs and musicians are trending. Next Big Sound 
takes all the data and packages it into one central dashboard per artist or band. They 
sell access to the dashboard for a monthly subscription fee. With the data it collects, 
Next Big Sound says it can forecast record sales for 85 percent of artists, within a 20 
percent accuracy range. The company’s data is useful for additional purposes. For 
example, it can tell the areas of the country in which an artist is the most popular. That 
helps the artist plan tours and special promotions. Similarly, it can tell which activi-
ties an artist or band engages in provide the biggest bang for the buck. Appearing on 
some late-night talk shows, for instance, translates into more record sales than others. 
Having access to this type of information helps an artist or band make informed judg-
ments when requests for appearances come in.
In regard to building a new venture team, the Next Big Sound team is unique in 
that it has three co-founders, which is above average in the start-up world. When 
asked how they get along with one another, David Hoffman indicated that they have 
healthy debates, but are able to come to consensus and get along well and trust one 
another. They also have complementary rather than redundant skills. When it came 
time to designate one of the three co-founders as the company’s CEo, Hoffman in-
dicated that it seemed only natural that Alex White would assume the role, which he 
did when Next Big Sound launched in 2009, and he remains in that role today. Next 
Big Sound’s founders have had multiple mentors along the way, which they credit for 
much of their success. Hoffman recommends that the best way to get a mentor is not 
to ask for one. Instead, he suggests establishing a mutually beneficial relationship with 
someone, where each party has something to offer to the other. The mentorship will 
then come more naturally.
In the summer of 2012, Next Big Sound moved from Boulder, Colorado, to New 
York City, where the firm now has offices in Chelsea, an area on the west side of mid-
town Manhattan. The move brought Next Big Sound closer to its major customers and 
the music industry in general. The company continues to gain momentum and stature 
in the music industry.
I
n this chapter, we focus on how the founders of an entrepreneurial venture 
build a new-venture team as well as the importance of the team to the firm’s 
overall success. A new-venture team is the group of founders, key employ-
ees, and advisers that move a new venture from an idea to a fully functioning 
firm.1 Usually, the team doesn’t come together all at once. Instead, it is built 
as the new firm can afford to hire additional personnel. The team also involves 
more than paid employees. Many firms have a board of directors, a board of 
advisors, investors, and other professionals on whom they rely for direction 
and advice.
In this chapter’s first section, we discuss the role of an entrepreneurial ven-
ture’s founder or founders and emphasize the substantial effect that founders 
have on their firm’s future. We then turn our attention to a discussion about 

CHAPTER 9 | BUIlDING A New-VeNTure TEAM    319
how the founders build a new-venture team, including the recruitment and se-
lection of key employees and the forming of a board of directors. The chapter’s 
second section examines the important role of advisors, lenders and investors, 
and other professionals in shaping and rounding out a new-venture team.
liability of newness as a Challenge
As we note throughout this textbook, new ventures have a high propensity 
to fail. The high failure rate is due in part to what is known as the liability 
of newness, which refers to the fact that companies often falter because the 
people who start them aren’t able to adjust quickly enough to their new roles 
and because the firm lacks a “track record” with outside buyers and suppliers.2 
Assembling a talented and experienced new-venture team is one path firms can 
take to overcome these limitations. Indeed, experienced management teams 
that get up to speed quickly are much less likely to make a novice’s mistakes. 
In addition, firms able to persuade high-quality individuals to join them as 
directors or advisers quickly gain legitimacy with a variety of people, such as 
some of those working inside the venture as well as some outside the venture 
(e.g., suppliers, customers, and investors). In turn, legitimacy opens doors that 
otherwise would be closed.
Another way entrepreneurs overcome the liability of newness is by at-
tending entrepreneurship-focused workshops and events, such as Startup 
Weekend, hackathons, boot camps, and so on. These types of activities are 
sponsored by local universities, small business development centers, and eco-
nomic development commissions. Another route to overcoming the liabilities 
of newness is joining one of the growing number of start-up accelerators that 
are popping up across the country. Start-up accelerators provide entrepre-
neurs access to mentors, investors, subject matter experts (such as attorneys 
and accountants), and other entrepreneurs. More information about start-up 
accelerators and the benefits they provide new businesses is explored in the 
“Partnering for Success” boxed feature. Entrepreneurs should remember that, 
at the end of the day, the faster they can overcome the liabilities associated 
with launching a new venture, the greater the likelihood they will achieve suc-
cess with their firm.
Creating a new-venture team
Those who launch or found an entrepreneurial venture have an important 
role to play in shaping the firm’s business model. Stated even more directly, it 
is widely known that a well-conceived business plan, one that flows from the 
firm’s previously established business model, cannot get off the ground un-
less a firm has the leaders and personnel to carry it out. As some experts put 
it, “People are the one factor in production … that animates all the others.”3 
Often, several start-ups develop what is essentially the same idea at the same 
time. When this happens, the key to success is not the idea but rather the abil-
ity of the initial founder or founders to assemble a team that can execute the 
idea better than anyone else.
The way a founder builds a new-venture team sends an important signal to 
potential investors, partners, and employees. Some founders like the feeling of 
control and are reluctant to involve themselves with partners or hire managers 
who are more experienced than they are. In contrast, other founders are keenly 
aware of their own limitations and work hard to find the most experienced peo-
ple to bring on board. Similarly, some new firms never form an advisory board, 
whereas others persuade the most important (and influential) people they can 
find to provide them with counsel and advice. In general, the way to impress

The third benefit associated with joining an accelera-
tor program is the opportunity to work side-by-side with 
other start-ups. As mentioned, most accelerators admit 
start-ups in classes, ranging from just a few start-ups to 
25 at a time. Most participants want to be well-regarded 
by their peers, which provides an incentive to work hard 
and succeed. A close bond often develops among the 
members of an accelerator cohort. The bond remains 
after the program finishes. As a result, when a company 
that has been part of an effective accelerator program 
graduates, it normally already has a group of other com-
panies that are willing to lend it legitimacy and support.
The final benefit is the learning that takes place. Along 
with providing mentoring and support, most accelerator 
programs provide training in developing successful business 
models, raising capital, connecting with potential investors, 
and protecting intellectual property. A start-up can normally 
get up to speed on these issues and others faster by partici-
pating in an accelerator program than going it alone.
Early research results concerned with accelerator 
programs are encouraging. A study conducted by Yael 
Hochberg, a professor at MIT, and Susan Cohen, a profes-
sor at the University of Richmond and the University of 
Virginia’s Darden School of Business, found that 59.3 per-
cent of all companies in accelerator programs were able 
to raise follow-on funding after leaving the program. They 
also found that start-up founders were almost universally 
satisfied with their accelerator experience. Roughly 90 per-
cent of the participants in accelerator programs surveyed 
in Hochberg and Cohen’s study said they would repeat 
their accelerator experience.
Questions for Critical Thinking
 1. Find an example of a start-up accelerator in the state 
in which the college or university you are attending is 
located. Describe the equity percentage the accelera-
tor takes, how much seed funding is awarded, and in 
general how the program works.
 2. Make a bullet-point list of the ways that participating 
in a start-up accelerator helps a firm overcome the 
 liabilities of newness.
 3. What, if any, are the downsides to participating in a 
start-up accelerator program?
 4. If a college student has a business idea, what should the 
student do while in college to improve his or her chances 
of getting accepted by one of the better accelerator 
programs?

tart-up Accelerators are fixed-term, cohort-based pro-
grams for promising start-ups. The two best-known 
accelerator programs are Y-Combinator, located 
in the Silicon Valley, and TechStars, which originated in 
Boulder, Colorado. Most accelerator programs follow the 
following format:
■ Select a dozen or so start-ups for each class 
(many have between two and three classes a year)
■ Provide each start-up $10,000 to $25,000 in seed 
funding in exchange for 5 percent to 8 percent 
equity in its business
■ Bring the start-ups together for mentoring over the 
course of an on-site multiweek mentoring program.
■ Host a demo day at the end of the program where 
the participants pitch their businesses to angel 
investors, venture capitalists, and others.
Accelerator programs differ from business incubators. 
Most incubator programs are government-funded, take no 
equity, charge a modest fee for rent, and focus on a spe-
cific industry, such as medical technology or clean tech. 
They also typically do not have a set duration. In contrast, 
accelerator programs exemplify the bullet points made 
above, and can be either privately or publicly funded.
There are four primary benefits to joining an accelera-
tor program, all of which help a start-up overcome the 
liabilities of newness. The first benefit concerns the net-
work of people you’ll meet and with whom you’ll become 
acquainted. You’ll be connected to not only mentors and 
advisers, but to former alumni companies. If a company 
going through the TechStars program, for example, runs 
into a technical challenge, those leading the firm can 
ask the entire TechStars network for help. Engaging 
successful mentors and alumni companies helps a firm 
gain legitimacy and support. Both Airbnb and Dropbox, 
for example, are Y-Combinator graduates. Imagine how 
helpful it would be for a start-up that is currently going 
through the Y-Combinator program to get acquainted 
with people at Airbnb or Dropbox and earn their en-
dorsement and support.
Brand recognition is the second benefit of accelera-
tor programs. The best accelerator programs are hard to 
get into. As a result, when potential employees, inves-
tors, or other companies see that you’ve graduated from 
TechStars, Y-Combinator, AngelPad, or one of the other 
better known accelerator programs, it sets you apart 
from other start-ups. This factor helps gain legitimacy. 
It’s somewhat akin to having a degree from an academic 
institution to which it is very difficult to gain admittance. 
In turn, graduating from a school or a university with high 
entrance standards sets you apart in some individuals’ 
eyes as a person who is talented and willing to work hard.

potential investors, partners, and employees is to put together as strong a team 
as possible.4 Investors and others know that experienced personnel and access 
to good-quality advice contribute greatly to a new venture’s success.
The elements of a new-venture team are shown in Figure 9.1. It’s important 
to carefully think through each element. Miscues regarding whether team mem-
bers are compatible, whether the team is properly balanced in terms of areas 
of expertise, and how the permanent members of the team will physically work 
together can be fatal. Conversely, careful attention in each of these areas can 
help a firm get off to a good start and provide it an advantage over competitors.
There is a common set of mistakes to avoid when putting together a new-
venture team. These mistakes raise red flags when a potential investor, employee, 
or business partner evaluates a new venture. The most common mistakes are 
shown in Table 9.1.
In the reminder of this chapter, we examine each element shown in 
Figure 9.1. While reading these descriptions, remember that entrepreneurial 
ventures vary in how they use the elements.

Founders’ characteristics and their early decisions significantly affect the way 
an entrepreneurial venture is received and the manner in which the new-ven-
ture team takes shape. The size of the founding team and the qualities of the 
founder or founders are the two most important issues in this matter.

322    PART 3 | MoVING FRoM AN IDEA To AN ENTREPRENEURIAl FIRM
Size of the Founding Team  The first decision that most founders face 
is whether to start a firm on their own or whether to build an initial found-
ing team. Studies show that 50 to 70 percent of all new firms are started 
by more than one individual.5 However, experts disagree about whether new 
ventures started by a team have an advantage over those started by a sole 
entrepreneur. Teams bring more talent, resources, ideas, and professional 
contacts to a new venture than does a sole entrepreneur.6 In addition, the 
psychological support that co-founders of a business can offer one another 
can be an important element in a new venture’s success.7 Conversely, a lot 
can go wrong in a partnership—particularly one that’s formed between peo-
ple who don’t know each other well. Team members can easily differ in terms 
of work habits, tolerances for risk, levels of passion for the business, ideas 
on how the business should be run, and similar key issues.8 If a new-venture 
team isn’t able to reach consensus on these issues, it may be handicapped 
from the outset.
When a new venture is started by a team, several issues affect the value of 
the team. First, teams that have worked together before, as opposed to teams 
that are working together for the first time, have an edge.9 If people have worked 
together before and have decided to partner to start a firm together, it usu-
ally means that they get along personally and trust one another.10 They also 
tend to communicate with one another more effectively than people who are 
new to one another.11 Second, if the members of the team are heterogeneous, 
meaning that they are diverse in terms of their abilities and experiences, rather 
than homogeneous, meaning that their areas of expertise are very similar to one 
another, they are likely to have different points of view about technology, hiring 
decisions, competitive tactics, and other important activities. Typically, these 
different points of view generate debate and constructive conflict among the 
founders, reducing the likelihood that decisions will be made in haste or without 
the airing of alternative points of view.12 A founding team can be too big, caus-
ing communication problems and an increased potential for conflict. The sweet 
spot is two to three founders. A founding team larger than four people is typi-
cally too large to be practical.13
If a new venture is started 
by more than one person, 
it’s important that the 
founders have a good 
rapport and complement 
one another rather than 
duplicate one another 
in terms of skills and 
backgrounds. Here, the 
founders of an educational 
software company have 
worked together before 
and are comfortable with 
each other’s demeanors 
and work habits. The

CHAPTER 9 | BUIlDING A New-VeNTure TEAM    323
There are three potential pitfalls associated with starting a firm as a team 
rather than as a sole entrepreneur. First, the team members may not get along. 
This is the reason investors favor teams consisting of people who have worked to-
gether before. It is simply more likely that people who have gotten along with one 
another in the past will continue to get along in the future. Second, if two or more 
people start a firm as “equals,” conflicts can arise when the firm needs to estab-
lish a formal structure and designate one person as the chief executive officer 
(CEO). If the firm has investors, the investors will usually weigh in on who should 
be appointed CEO. In these instances, it is easy for the founder that wasn’t cho-
sen as the CEO to feel slighted. This problem is exacerbated if multiple founders 
are involved and they all stay with the firm. At some point, a hierarchy will have 
to be developed, and the founders will have to decide who reports to whom. Some 
of these problems can be avoided by developing a formal organizational chart 
from the beginning, which spells out the roles of each founder. Finally, as illus-
trated in the “What Went Wrong?” feature, if the founders of a firm have similar 
areas of expertise, it can be problematic. The founders of Devver were both tech-
nically oriented, leaving the firm without a leader on the business side.
Qualities of the Founders  The second major issue pertaining to the 
founders of a firm is the qualities they bring to the table. In the previous sev-
eral chapters, we described the importance investors and others place on the 
strength of the firm’s founders and initial management team. One reason the 
founders are so important is that in the early days of a firm, their knowledge, 
skills, and experiences are the most valuable resource the firm has. Because of 
this, new firms are judged largely on their “potential” rather than their current 
assets or current performance. In most cases, this results in people judging 
the future prospects of a firm by evaluating the strength of its founders and 
initial management team.
Several features are thought to be significant to a founder’s success. The 
level of a founder’s education is important because it’s believed that entrepre-
neurial abilities such as search skills, foresight, creativity, and computer skills 
are enhanced through obtaining a college degree. Similarly, some observers 
think that higher education equips a founder with important business-related 
skills, such as math and communications. In addition, specific forms of educa-
tion, such as engineering, computer science, management information systems, 
physics, and biochemistry, provide the recipients of this education an advantage 
if they start a firm that is related to their area of expertise.14
Prior entrepreneurial experience, relevant industry experience, and net-
working are other attributes that strengthen the chances of a founder’s suc-
cess. Indeed, the results of research studies somewhat consistently suggest 
that prior entrepreneurial experience is one of the most consistent pre-
dictors of future entrepreneurial performance.15 Because launching a new 
venture is a complex task, entrepreneurs with prior start-up experience have 
a distinct advantage. The impact of relevant industry experience on an 
entrepreneur’s ability to successfully launch and grow a firm has also been 
studied.16 Entrepreneurs with experience in the same industry as their cur-
rent venture will have a more mature network of industry contacts and will 
have a better understanding of the subtleties of their respective industries.17 
The importance of this factor is particularly evident for entrepreneurs who 
start firms in technical industries such as biotechnology. The demands of 
biotechnology are sufficiently intense that it would be virtually impossible for 
someone to start a biotech firm while at the same time learning biotechnology. 
The person must have an understanding of biotechnology prior to launching a 
firm through either relevant industry experience or an academic background. 
Some entrepreneurs, who come from a nonbusiness background, fear that 
a lack of business experience will be their Achilles’ heel. There are several 
steps, techniques, or approaches to business that entrepreneurs can utilize 

324    PART 3 | MoVING FRoM AN IDEA To AN ENTREPRENEURIAl FIRM
D
evver (pronounced like “developer,” not “devious”) 
launched in 2008 to help software developers use 
cloud-based services to “test” their code in a more 
expedient manner than current practices. The firm started 
by focusing on Ruby on Rails software applications. one 
of its flagship products, Caliper, provided quality metrics 
to Ruby on Rails developers for their Ruby on Rails code. 
By using Caliper, a Ruby on Rails developer could quickly 
discover problems such as code duplication, complex 
code, and code “smells.” In computer programming, 
a code smell is any symptom in the source code of a 
program that possibly indicates a deeper and potentially 
more serious problem.
Dan Mayer and Ben Brinckerhoff are Devver’s co-
founders. The two met in high school and started a Web 
business before their high school graduations. Both 
studied computer programming in college, Mayer at the 
University of Colorado and Brinckerhoff at Washington 
University in St. louis. The two reunited in 2008 to 
launch Devver. They are graduates of TechStars, a 
Boulder, Colorado-based mentorship-driven seed stage 
investment fund. Devver operated from early 2008 until 
early 2010, when it went out of business. In announcing 
its plans to close, the company indicated that although it 
had worked hard to achieve its vision—to use the cloud 
to build tools that would change software developers’ 
lives—it couldn’t generate sufficient revenue to sustain 
and grow the company.
In a thoughtful blog post, Ben Brinckerhoff reflected 
on the reasons for Devver’s failure. While the reasons 
were varied, the key reasons focused on the composi-
tion of the founding team, difficulties in communications, 
and product development.
In regard to the founding team, both Mayer and 
Brinckerhoff thought of themselves as geeks. looking 
back, Brinckerhoff feels it would have been to their ad-
vantage to have had another co-founder who loved the 
business side of running a start-up. In reflecting on this 
observation, Mayer challenged the oft-repeated state-
ment that “You can teach a hacker business, but you 
can’t teach a businessman how to hack.” This state-
ment is sometimes used by technical founders to justify 
not needing a businessperson on the team. While Mayer 
acknowledges that it’s possible to teach a hacker busi-
ness, you can’t force a hacker to get excited about it, 
or give it the proper amount of attention. According to 
Mayer, what hackers like to do is hack. So they measure 
progress in lines of code written or use a similar metric. 
It’s equally important to have someone in a start-up 
measuring progress on business metrics—like number 
of customers talked to or how well distribution channels 
are being developed. Not enough of that happened at 
Devver.
In regard to communication, Devver embraced work-
ing remotely. The company started in Boulder, where the 
two co-founders worked together. Devver’s first key 
hire worked in Pennsylvania, and Mayer later moved to 
Washington, D.C. The idea was that by embracing work-
ing remotely, Devver could hire the best talent available 
without requiring people to relocate to Colorado. In ad-
dition, they felt that by allowing team members to work 
remotely they would experience minimal distractions, 
which is important when it comes to effective code writ-
ing. Regrettably, achieving these objectives was more 
difficult than the founders anticipated. Communication 
was a challenge. It was also an administrative hassle. 
Mayer and Brinckerhoff found that it was a pain to 
manage payroll, benefits, and so forth in several states 
simultaneously. In addition, pair programming was dif-
ficult to do remotely—a challenge for which the Devver 
team never found a good solution.
Finally, Brinckerhoff believes Devver should have 
spent more time on customer development and find-
ing a minimum viable product. A minimum viable 
product, which is a staple component of the lean 
start-up movement, has just those features that allow 
a product to be deployed, and no more. It’s typically 
deployed to early adopters for testing. The idea is to 
avoid building bells and whistles into products that 
customers don’t need or want. Instead of doing this, 
Devver did minimal testing of its first product, the 
Ruby test accelerator, and then focused intently on 
building out the product without additional interaction 
with potential users. As a result, its Ruby test acceler-
ation and additional products never really met market 
needs before Devver ran out of steam. In retrospect, 
Brinckerhoff believes Devver should have deployed in-
dividual products sooner, and solicited more customer 
feedback about pricing, market size, and technical 
challenges. Eventually, they learned that their market 
was too small and their price point needed to be too 
low to sustain the company.
Questions for Critical Thinking
 1. In retrospect, Brinckerhoff believes that it would

to overcome a lack of business experience. These steps and approaches are 
highlighted in the “Savvy Entrepreneurial Firm” feature.
A particularly important attribute for founders or founding teams is the 
presence of a mature network of social and professional contacts.18 Founders 
must often “work” their social and personal networks to raise money or gain 
access to critical resources on behalf of their firms.19 Networking is building 
and maintaining relationships with people whose interests are similar or whose 
relationship could bring advantages to a firm. The way this might play out in 
practice is that a founder calls a business acquaintance or friend to ask for an 
introduction to a potential investor, business partner, or customer. For some 
founders, networking is easy and is an important part of their daily routine. For 
others, it is a learned skill.
Table 9.2 shows the preferred attributes of a firm’s founder or founders. 
Start-ups that have founders or a team of founders with these attributes have 
the best chances of early success. If an individual is starting a company and 
is looking for a co-founder, there are several websites dedicated to matchmak-
ing co-founders for start-ups. Two of the best sites are CofoundersLab (www.
cofounderslab.com) and Founder2Be (www.founder2be.com).
the management team and key employees
Once the decision to launch a new venture has been made, building a man-
agement team and hiring key employees begins. Start-ups vary in terms of 
how quickly they need to add personnel. In some instances, the founders 
work alone for a period of time while the business plan is being written and 
about its site before committing substantial time and 
resources to building it out?

Firm started by a team
New ventures that are started by a team can provide greater resources, a broader 
diversity of viewpoints, and a broader array of other positive attributes than ventures 
started by individuals.
Higher education
Evidence suggests that important entrepreneurial skills are enhanced through higher 
education.
Prior entrepreneurial experience
Founders with prior entrepreneurial experience are familiar with the entrepreneurial 
 process and are more likely to avoid costly mistakes than founders new to the  rigors 
of the entrepreneurial process.
Relevant industry experience
Founders with experience in the same industry as their new venture will most likely 
have better-established professional networks and more applicable marketing and 
management expertise than founders without relevant industry experience.
Broad social and professional 
network
Founders with broad social and professional networks have potential access to 
 additional know-how, capital, and customer referrals.

M
any people who start businesses do not have 
prior business experience. This is especially true 
with the recent innovations in IT, where people 
have started businesses in areas that have never existed 
before. Some of these new business owners who lack 
business experience worry that people with experience 
in accounting, finance, and management will generally 
have an easier time starting a business than those who 
are tackling these challenges for the first time.
There are several methods and approaches to start-
ing a business that people can take to compensate for 
their lack of business experience. However, first let’s look 
at some of the characteristics a new business owner 
should have. A successful business owner should be:
 1. Creative
 2. Sure about the business
 3. Realistic
 4. Fast
 5. Honest
 6. Firm
 7. Friendly
 8. Careful
 9. Sincere
 10. Prepared to face failure
In Malaysia, there are several ways for a person to 
 successfully launch a business even with a lack of prior 
experience.
get business assistance and advice
There are many places for business founders to get 
business assistance and advice. SME Corporation 
Malaysia (SME Corp. Malaysia), for example, is a gov-
ernment agency that provides management assistance 
and coaching to business owners. It is a central point 
of reference for information and advisory services for 
all small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Malaysia. 
You will be able to find your local SME Corp. at www.
smecorp.gov.my. You may also find information from 
SME Toolkit Malaysia, which is a project by Dun & 
Bradstreet (D&B) Malaysia Sdn Bhd and the Small and 
Medium Enterprise (SME) Department of the World Bank 
Group. It is an organization that provides consulting 
services to small businesses. You can find your local 
SME Toolkit at www.malaysia.smetoolkit.org. There are 
also many other organizations that provide coaching, 
advice, and support to specific groups of business own-
ers and tailor their offerings to fit the groups. An example 
is the National Association for Women Entrepreneurs of 
Malaysia (NAWEM), an organization that promotes, de-
velops, and enhances the efforts and activities of women 
entrepreneurs. You may visit their website at www.
nawem.org.my.
If you’re looking for a support group in your area and 
can’t find one, check the Meetup website. Meetup (www.
meetup.com) is an online platform that allows individuals 
to organize local groups via the Internet. once a group 
is formed, its members “meet up” on a regular basis off-
line. You may simply follow the directions on Meetup’s 
home page to discover if there is a small business or 
 entrepreneurship Meetup group in your area. The follow-
ing is a sample of small business Meetup groups that 
have taken place in Malaysia:
■ Business networks
■ Social media training
■ Discussion and sharing on expanding your 
 business across national borders
participate in Online Forums and Q&a sites
There are a growing number of online forums that 
provide support and advice to business owners. An 
 example is the SMI SME Business Directory (www.
smibusinessdirectory.com.my), which sponsors online 
forums that cover topics such as selecting a business, 
successful business planning, start-up funding, and 
 financial management. The general tone of forums tends 
to be supportive and upbeat, which is exactly what busi-
ness owners with limited experience need. There are 
also other growing numbers of websites for entrepre-
neurs that can be very helpful, especially to those who 
lack business experience.
pick a type of business that Minimizes the need 
for prior experience
There are also other alternatives for starting a business 
that minimize the need for prior experience. These alter-
natives allow people to pursue an opportunity in which 
fundamentals of the business have already been thought 
out. Franchising, for example, provides an individual the 
opportunity to own a business using a tested and refined 
business system. other than that, a second alternative 
would be direct sales or multilevel marketing. These 
 options require minimum experience and have been suc-
cessful even for those who lack business experience.
Questions for Critical Thinking
 1. Identify the sources of business assistance available in 
your area free of charge.
 2. Identify three sources of business assistance or advice, 
particularly useful for someone who’s starting a busi-
ness without prior business experience, not mentioned 
in this feature.
 3. How valuable do you believe that online forums, like 
the one mentioned previously, can be to someone 
who’s trying to learn the “business” aspect of starting 
a business?
 4. What other techniques, not mentioned previously, can 
people who don’t have prior business experience uti-
lize to compensate for their lack of experience?

the venture begins taking shape. In other instances, employees are hired 
immediately.
One technique available to entrepreneurs to help prioritize their hiring 
needs is to maintain a skills profile. A skills profile is a chart that depicts 
the most important skills that are needed and where skills gaps exist. A skills 
profile for New Venture Fitness Drinks, the fictitious company introduced in 
Chapter 3, is shown in Figure 9.2. Along with depicting where a firm’s most 
important skills gaps exist, a skills profile should explain how current skills 
gaps are being dealt with. For example, two of New Venture Fitness Drink’s 
skills gaps are being covered (on a short-term basis) by members of the board 
of advisors and the third skills gap does not need to be filled until the firm 
initiates a franchising program, which is still three to five years in the future.
Evidence suggests that finding good employees (and certainly good key em-
ployees) today is not an easy task. According to a 2013 Wells Fargo/Gallop Small 
Business Index Survey, when it comes to finding qualified employees, 53 percent 
of small business owners said it is very difficult to do so, 30 percent said it is 
difficult, and 23 percent said it is somewhat difficult.20 Similarly, a 2011 sur-
vey conducted by the University of Maryland’s School of Business and Network 
Solutions asked small business owners how well they competed with larger com-
panies for good employees; only 46 percent said they were successful with these 
efforts. Respondents also said that recruiting workers who were comfortable in a 
small business setting is difficult.21
To save money, increase flexibility, and mitigate the difficulty in finding 
good employees, new ventures use four different sources of labor to get their 
work done. These are shown in Table 9.3. The first is employees. An employee

is someone who works for a business, at the business’s location or virtually, 
utilizing the business’s tools and equipment and according to the business’s 
policies and procedures.22 These rules can vary somewhat, particularly as 
it pertains to working at the business’s location. Most businesses bring on 
employees fairly slowly because of the costs involved. While employees are 
valuable, they are expensive. An employee who makes $50,000 a year costs a 
business more than $50,000 a year. Along with an employee’s base salary, the 
employer pays a portion of the employee’s Social Security (FICA) and Medicare 
taxes, provides workers’ compensation insurance, pays into an unemployment 
fund, and provides benefits (such as health insurance and paid vacation) if 
benefits are part of the job. A general rule of thumb for an employer that offers 
benefits is that the benefits and taxes cost 33 percent of the base pay. As a 
result, a $50,000 per year employee would cost the business $66,500 per year.
The second resource that businesses utilize to get their work done is interns. 
An intern is a person who works for a business as an apprentice or trainee for 
the purpose of obtaining practical experience. For example, TOMS (the focal firm 
in Case 4.2), used many interns in getting its business up and running and still 
relies heavily on interns today. Many tech companies, in particular, have formal 
internship programs. Facebook runs a 12-week internship program (this pro-
gram is described at www.facebook.com/careers/university). Google sponsors 
a variety of internship programs, which are detailed at www.google.com/about/
careers/students. Many firms run internship programs not only to utilize the 
help, but as a recruiting tool. It provides them a chance to “look” at a potential 
hire before making a formal commitment to that person. Many companies also 
enjoy having interns around because of their vigor, enthusiasm, and tech-savvy 
skills. For example, a start-up founded by two 50-year-old individuals may learn 
a lot from college-aged interns about how to use social media platforms such as 
Facebook and Twitter more effectively in their business.
The third resource that firms utilize to get their work done is freelancers (also 
called contractors). A freelancer is a person who is in business for themselves, 
works on their own time with their own tools and equipment, and performs ser-
vices for a number of different clients.23 For example, a business may hire a free-
lancer to manage the search engine optimization (SEO) for its website, and pay 
the freelancer an hourly or monthly fee. Businesses typically find freelancers via 
word of mouth or through websites such as Odesk or Elance. Odesk and Elance, 
as explained in the “Partnering for Success” feature in Chapter 4, specialize in 
matching freelancers with businesses that are looking for specific types of help.
The fourth resource that businesses draw upon to complete their work is 
virtual assistants. A virtual assistant is a freelancer who provides adminis-
trative, technical, or creative assistance to clients remotely from a home office.

CHAPTER 9 | BUIlDING A New-VeNTure TEAM    329
Businesses use virtual assistants for everything from making customer service 
calls, to data entry in accounting or bookkeeping platforms, to sending out 
thank you notes to clients. Similar to freelancers, virtual assistants can be lo-
cated on online platforms like Odesk and Elance. As of June 2014, Odesk.com 
had over 17,000 virtual assistants listed that were looking for additional work.
An advantage businesses have in using freelancers and virtual assistants is 
that they are considered to be “independent contractors.” As a result, a business 
is not responsible for costs (such as Social Security and Medicare taxes, work-
ers’ compensation insurance, paying into an unemployment fund, and benefits) 
beyond their hourly or contracted pay. Businesses have to be careful, however, 
to not incorrectly categorize an employee as an independent contractor to save 
money on taxes and benefits. The IRS looks closely at the distinction and can 
levy severe penalties if workers are misclassified.
Many founders worry about hiring the wrong person for a key role, regard-
less of whether the person is an employee, an intern, a freelancer, or a virtual 
assistant. Because most new firms are strapped for cash, everyone who is 
hired must make a valuable contribution. It’s not good enough to hire someone 
who is well intended but who doesn’t precisely fit the job. On some occasions, 
key hires work out perfectly and fill the exact roles that a firm’s founders need. 
For example, Dave Olsen was one of the first employees hired by Starbucks 
founder Howard Schultz. At the time of his hiring, Olsen was the owner of 
a popular coffeehouse in the university district of Seattle, the city where 
Starbucks was launched. In his autobiography, Schultz recalls the following 
about the hiring of Olsen:
On the day of our meeting, Dave and I sat on my office floor and I started spread-
ing the plans and blueprints out and talking about my idea. Dave got it right 
away. He had spent ten years in an apron, behind a counter, serving espresso 
drinks. He had experienced firsthand the excitement people can develop about 
espresso, both in his café and in Italy. I didn’t have to convince him that this 
idea had big potential. He just knew it in his bones. The synergy was too good to 
be true. My strength was looking outward: communicating the vision, inspiring 
investors, raising money, finding real estate, designing the stores, building the 
brand, and planning for the future. Dave understood the inner workings: the nuts 
and bolts of operating a retail café, hiring and training baristas (coffee brewers), 
ensuring the best quality coffee.24
The fear that an employee will not work out as well as Dave Olsen did for 
Starbucks is one of the attractions for hiring interns, freelancers, and virtual 
assistants. These individuals work on strictly an “as needed” basis, or on fairly 
short-term contracts, and a business can simply move on if the person doesn’t 
work out. In contrast, separating from a full-time or even a part-time employee 
can be much more difficult.
the roles of the Board of Directors
If a new venture organizes as a corporation, it is legally required to have a 
board of directors—a panel of individuals who are elected by a corporation’s 
shareholders to oversee the management of the firm.25 A board is typically 
made up of both inside and outside directors. An inside director is a person 
who is also an officer of the firm. An outside director is someone who is not 
employed by the firm. A board of directors has three formal responsibilities: 
(1) appoint the firm’s officers (the key managers), (2) declare dividends, and 
(3) oversee the affairs of the corporation. In the wake of corporate scandals such 
as Enron, WorldCom, and others, there is a strong emphasis on the board’s 
role in making sure the firm is operating ethically. One outcome of this move-
ment is a trend toward putting more outsiders on boards of directors, because 

330    PART 3 | MoVING FRoM AN IDEA To AN ENTREPRENEURIAl FIRM
people who do not work for the firm are usually more willing to scrutinize the 
behavior of management than insiders who work for the company. Most boards 
meet formally three or four times a year. Large firms pay their directors for their 
service. New ventures are more likely to pay their directors in company stock 
or ask them to serve without direct compensation—at least until the company 
is profitable. The boards for publicly traded companies are required by law to 
have audit and compensation committees. Many boards also have nominating 
committees to select stockholders to run for vacant board positions. A list of the 
most desirable qualities in a board of directors and the most desirable qualities 
in individual board members is provided in Table 9.4.
If handled properly, a company’s board of directors can be an important 
part of the new-venture team.26 Providing expert guidance and legitimacy in the 
eyes of others (e.g., customers, investors, and even competitors) are two ways a 
board of directors can help a new firm get off to a good start and develop what, 
it is hoped, will become a sustainable competitive advantage.
Provide expert guidance  Although a board of directors has formal gov-
ernance responsibilities, its most useful role is to provide guidance and sup-
port to the firm’s managers.27 Many CEOs interact with their board members 
frequently and obtain important input. The key to making this happen is to 
pick board members with needed skills and useful experiences who are willing 
to give advice and ask insightful and probing questions. The extent to which 
an effective board can help shape a firm and provide it a competitive advan-
tage in the marketplace is expressed by Ram Charan, an expert on the role of 
boards of directors in corporations:
They (effective boards) listen, probe, debate, and become engaged in the com-
pany’s most pressing issues. Directors share their expertise and wisdom as a mat-
ter of course. As they do, management and the board learn together, a collective 
wisdom emerges, and managerial judgment improves. The on-site coaching and 
consulting expand the mental capacity of the CEO and the top management team 
and give the company a competitive edge out there in the marketplace.28

CHAPTER 9 | BUIlDING A New-VeNTure TEAM    331
Because managers rely on board members for counsel and advice, the 
search for outside directors should be purposeful, with the objective of filling 
gaps in the experience and background of the venture’s executives and the other 
directors. For example, if two computer programmers started a software firm 
and neither one of them had any marketing experience, it would make sense to 
place a marketing executive on the board of directors. Indeed, a board of direc-
tors has the foundation to effectively serve its organization when its members 
represent many important organizational skills (e.g., manufacturing, human 
resource management, and financing) involved with running a company.
lend legitimacy  Providing legitimacy for the entrepreneurial venture is an-
other important function of a board of directors. Well-known and respected board 
members bring instant credibility to the firm. For example, just imagine the posi-
tive buzz a firm could generate if it could say that Blake Mycoskie of TOMS or 
Drew Houston of Dropbox had agreed to serve on its board of directors. This phe-
nomenon is referred to as signaling. Without a credible signal, it is difficult for 
potential customers, investors, or employees to identify high-quality start-ups. 
Presumably, high-quality individuals would be reluctant to serve on the board 
of a low-quality firm because that would put their reputation at risk. So when a 
high-quality individual does agree to serve on a firm’s board, the individual is in 
essence “signaling” that the company has potential to be successful.29
Achieving legitimacy through high-quality board members can result in 
other positive outcomes. Investors like to see new-venture teams, including the 
board of directors, that have people with enough clout to get their foot in the 
door with potential suppliers and customers. Board members are also often 
instrumental in helping young firms arrange financing or funding. As we will 
discuss in Chapter 10, it’s almost impossible for an entrepreneurial venture’s 
founders to get an investor’s attention without a personal introduction. One 
way firms deal with this challenge is by placing individuals on their boards 
that are acquainted with people in the investment community.
Potbelly, which is a restaurant chain that specializes in low-cost sandwiches, 
cookies, and shakes, is an example of a company with a well-designed board of 
directors. Its nine-member board consists of two inside directors and seven 
outsiders. The board members are listed below. Note that the outside members 
include individuals with backgrounds in real estate, restaurant chain devel-
opment, hospitality management, finance, and consumer products. Potbelly, 
which launched an IPO in 2013 and has aggressive growth plans, will benefit 
from guidance in each of the areas the different board members represent.30

rounding Out the team: the role 
of professional advisers
Along with the new-venture team members we’ve already identified, founders 
often rely on professionals with whom they interact for important counsel and 
advice. In many cases, these professionals become an important part of the 
new-venture team and fill what some entrepreneurs call “talent holes.”
Next, we discuss the roles that boards of advisers, lenders, investors, and 
other professionals play in rounding out new-venture teams.
Board of advisors
Some start-up firms are forming advisory boards to provide them direction and 
advice.31An advisory board is a panel of experts who are asked by a firm’s man-
agers to provide counsel and advice on an ongoing basis. Unlike a board of direc-
tors, an advisory board possesses no legal responsibility for the firm and gives 
nonbinding advice.32 As a result, more people are willing to serve on a company’s 
board of advisors than on its board of directors because it requires less time 
and no legal liability is involved. A board of advisors can be established for gen-
eral purposes or can be set up to address a specific issue or need. For example, 
some start-ups set up customer advisory boards shortly after they are founded 
to help them fine-tune their initial offerings. Similar to a board of directors, the 
main purpose of a board of advisors is to provide guidance and lend legitimacy to 
a firm. The most important thing that advisory board members can do is make 
high-level introductions to early customers, suppliers, and business partners.33
Most boards of advisers have between 5 and 15 members. Entrepreneurial 
firms typically pay the members of their board of advisors a small honorarium 
for their service either annually or on a per-meeting basis. Boards of advisors 
interact with each other and with a firm’s managers in several ways. Some ad-
visory boards meet three or four times a year at the company’s headquarters 
or in another location. Other advisory boards meet in an online environment. 
In some cases, a firm’s board of advisors will be scattered across the country, 
learning ObjeCtive

making it more cost-effective for a firm’s managers to interact with the mem-
bers of the board on the telephone, via e-mail, or through a Skype conference 
call, rather than to bring them physically together. In these situations, board 
members don’t interact with each other at all on a face-to-face basis, yet still 
provide high levels of counsel and advice.
The fact that a start-up has a board of directors does not preclude it from 
having one or more boards of advisors. For example, Coolibar, a maker of sun 
protective clothing, has a board of directors and a medical advisory board. 
According to Coolibar, its medical advisory board “provides advice to the com-
pany regarding UV radiation, sunburn, and the science of detecting, prevent-
ing, and treating skin cancer and other UV-related medical disorders, such as 
lupus.”34 The board currently consists of nine medical doctors, all with impres-
sive credentials. Similarly, Intouch Health, a medical robotics and instruments 
company, has a board of directors along with a Business & Strategy advisory 
board, an Applications & Clinical advisory board, and a Scientific & Technical 
advisory board. Intouch Health says that its “diversified Advisory Board draws 
on the talents of seasoned executives, clinical and scientific authorities, and 
pioneers from a variety of technical areas. Their expertise encompasses inter-
national business management, robotics, telemedicine, and computer software, 
hardware and networking.”35
Several guidelines are followed when organizing a board of advisors. First, 
a board of advisors should not be organized just so a company can boast of it. 
Advisers will become quickly disillusioned if they don’t play a meaningful role in 
the firm’s development and growth. Second, a firm should look for board mem-
bers who are compatible and complement one another in terms of experience 
and expertise. Unless the board is being established for a specific purpose, a 
board that includes members with varying backgrounds is preferable to a board 
of people with similar backgrounds. Third, when inviting a person to serve on 
its board of advisors, a company should carefully spell out to the individual 
the rules in terms of access to confidential information.36 Some firms ask the 
members of their advisory board to sign nondisclosure agreements, which we 
described in Chapter 7. Finally, firms should caution their advisers to disclose 
that they have a relationship with the venture before posting positive comments 
about it or its products on blogs or on social networking sites. A potential con-
flict of interest surfaces when a person says positive things about a company 
without disclosing an affiliation with the firm, particularly if there is a financial 
stake in the company.
Although having a board of advisors is widely recommended in start-up 
circles, most start-ups do not have one. As a result, one way a start-up can 
make itself stand out is to have one or more boards of advisors.
lenders and investors
As emphasized throughout this book, lenders and investors have a vested 
interest in the companies they finance, often causing these individuals to be-
come very involved in helping the firms they fund. It is rare that a lender or 
investor will put money into a new venture and then simply step back and wait 
to see what happens. In fact, the institutional rules governing banks and in-
vestment firms typically require that they monitor new ventures fairly closely, 
at least during the initial years of a loan or an investment.37
The amount of time and energy a lender or investor dedicates to a new 
firm depends on the amount of money involved and how much help the new 
firm needs. For example, a lender with a well-secured loan may spend very 
little time with a client, whereas a venture capitalist may spend an enormous 
amount of time helping a new venture refine its business model, recruit man-
agement personnel, and meet with current and prospective customers and 
suppliers. In fact, evidence suggests that an average venture capitalist is likely 

334    PART 3 | MoVING FRoM AN IDEA To AN ENTREPRENEURIAl FIRM
to visit each company in a portfolio multiple times a year.38 This number of 
visits denotes a high level of involvement and support.
As with the other nonemployee members of a firm’s new-venture team, 
lenders and investors help new firms by providing guidance and lending le-
gitimacy and assume the natural role of providing financial oversight. In some 
instances, lenders and investors also work hard to help new firms fill out their 
management teams. Sometimes this issue is so important that a new venture 
will try to obtain investment capital not only to get access to money, but also to 
obtain help hiring key employees.
For example, during its beginning stages, eBay’s founders, Pierre Omidyar 
and Jeff Skoll, decided to recruit a CEO. They wanted someone who was not 
only experienced, but who also had the types of credentials that are valued by 
Wall Street investors. They soon discovered that every experienced manager 
they tried to recruit asked if they had venture capital backing—which at that 
time they did not. For a new firm trying to recruit a seasoned executive, venture 
capital backing is a sort of seal of legitimacy. To get this valuable seal, Omidyar 
and Skoll obtained funding from Benchmark Venture Capital, even though eBay 
didn’t really need the money. Writer Randall Stross recalls this event as follows:
eBay was an anomaly: a profitable company that was able to self-fund its growth 
and that turned to venture capital solely for contacts and counsel. No larger lesson 
can be drawn. When Benchmark wired the first millions to eBay’s bank account, 
the figurative check was tossed into the vault—and there it would sit, unneeded 
and undisturbed.39
This strategy worked for eBay. Soon after affiliating with Benchmark, Bob Kagle, 
one of Benchmark’s general partners, led eBay to Meg Whitman, an executive 
who had experience working for several top firms, including Procter & Gamble, 
Disney, and Hasbro. In March 2008, Whitman stepped down as eBay’s presi-
dent and CEO. Her tenure at eBay was considered to be very successful during a 
critical period in eBay’s early development and growth.
Bankers also play a role in establishing the legitimacy of new ventures and 
their initial management teams. Research evidence rather consistently suggests 
that the presence of bank loans is a favorable signal to other capital provid-
ers.40 Investors often take a seat on the boards of directors of the firms they 
fund to provide oversight and advice. It is less common for a banker to take a 
seat on the board of directors of an entrepreneurial venture, primarily because 
bankers provide operating capital rather than large amounts of investment 
capital to new firms.
There are additional ways that lenders and investors add value to a new 
firm beyond financing and funding. These roles are highlighted in Table 9.5.
Table 9.5  beyond Financing and Funding: Ways lenders and 
investors add value to an entrepreneurial venture
■ Help identify and recruit key management personnel
■ Provide insight into the industry and markets in which the venture intends to participate
■ Help the venture fine-tune its business model
■ Serve as a sounding board for new ideas
■ Provide introductions to additional sources of capital
■ Recruit customers
■ Help to arrange business partnerships
■ Serve on the venture’s board of directors or board of advisors
■ Provide a sense of calm in the midst of the emotional roller-coaster ride that many new-venture 
teams experience

CHAPTER 9 | BUIlDING A New-VeNTure TEAM    335
Other professionals
At times, other professionals assume important roles in a new venture’s suc-
cess. Attorneys, accountants, and business consultants are often good sources 
of counsel and advice. The role of lawyers in helping firms get off to a good 
start is discussed in Chapter 7, and the role of accountants is discussed in 
Chapter 8. Here, we examine the role a consultant may play.
consultants
A consultant is an individual who gives professional or expert advice. New ven-
tures vary in terms of how much they rely on business consultants for  direction. 
In some ways, the role of the general business consultant has diminished in im-
portance as businesses seek specialists to obtain advice on complex issues such 
as patents, tax planning, and security laws. In other ways, the role of general 
business consultant is as important as ever; it is the general business consultant 
who can conduct in-depth analyses on behalf of a firm, such as preparing a fea-
sibility study or an industry analysis. Because of the time it would take, it would 
be inappropriate to ask a member of a board of directors or board of advisors to 
take on one of these tasks on behalf of a firm. These more time-intensive tasks 
must be performed by the firm itself or by a paid consultant.
Those leading an entrepreneurial venture often turn to consultants for help 
and advice because while large firms can afford to employ experts in many 
areas, new firms typically can’t. If a new firm needs help in a specialized area, 
such as building a product prototype, it may need to hire an engineering con-
sulting firm to do the work. Consultants’ fees are typically negotiable. If a new 
venture has good potential and offers a consulting firm the possibility of repeat 
business, the firm will often be willing to reduce its fee or work out favorable 
payment arrangements.
Consultants fall into two categories: paid consultants and consultants who 
are made available for free or at a reduced rate through a nonprofit or govern-
ment agency. The first category includes large international consulting firms, 
such as BearingPoint, Accenture, IBM Business Global Services, and Bain & 
Company. These firms provide a wide array of services but are beyond the reach 
of most start-ups because of budget limitations. But there are many smaller, lo-
calized firms. The best way to find them is to ask around for a referral.
Consultants are also available through nonprofit or government agencies. 
SCORE, for example, is a nonprofit organization that provides free consulting 
services to small businesses. SCORE currently has over 11,000 volunteers, 
320 local chapters, and provides assistance across 62 industries via one-on-
one meetings, workshops, and online webinars. An increasing number of score 
volunteers, called mentors, assist clients via e-mail rather than face-to-face. 
Commonly, SCORE mentors are retired business owners who counsel in areas as 
diverse as cash flow management, operations, and sales.41 The Small Business 
Administration, a government agency, provides a variety of consulting services 
to small businesses and entrepreneurs, primarily through its network of Small 
Business Development Centers (SBDC), which are spread throughout the United 
States. There is evidence that these centers are effective in providing advice and 
helping entrepreneurial ventures get off to a good start. For example, one study 
found that the rates of survival, growth, and innovation of SBDC-counseled firms 
are higher than those for the population of start-ups in general.42
In summary, putting together a new-venture team is one of the most critical 
activities that a founder or founders of a firm undertake. Many entrepreneurs 
suffer by not thinking broadly enough or carefully enough about this process. 
Ultimately, people must make any new venture work. New ventures benefit by 
surrounding themselves with high-quality employees and advisers to tackle the 
challenges involved with launching and growing an entrepreneurial firm.

team might use consultants 
to obtain advice.

Chapter Summary
high-quality individual agrees to serve on 
a company’s board of directors, the indi-
vidual is in essence expressing an opinion 
that the company has potential (why else 
would the individual agree to serve?). This 
phenomenon is referred to as signaling.
 lO3. An advisory board is a panel of experts 
who are asked by a firm’s management 
team to provide counsel and advice on 
an ongoing basis. Along with lenders and 
investors and, potentially, consultants, ad-
visory board members are the source of an 
entrepreneur’s efforts to “round out” their 
new-venture team. We say “round out” 
because the roles these groups play in a 
new-venture success is less direct and less 
frequent compared to the influence of the 
other elements associated with forming a 
new-venture team. Most entrepreneurial 
firms have between 10 and 15 members 
on a board of advisors. Typically, these in-
dividuals are paid a small honorarium for 
their services.
Lenders and investors have a vested 
interest in the entrepreneurial firm’s suc-
cess. As the size of their investment in-
creases, lenders and investors tend to be 
more involved in supporting the new ven-
ture’s efforts to gain traction in the mar-
ketplace as a foundation of organizational 
success. Helping to recruit key employees, 
providing information about the industry 
in which the venture intends to compete, 
and serving as a sounding board for po-
tential competitive actions are examples of 
the issues lenders and investors address 
with new-venture team members.
 lO4. The primary reason that new ventures turn 
to consultants for help and advice is that 
while large firms can afford to employ ex-
perts in many areas, new firms typically 
can’t. Consultants can be paid or can be 
part of a nonprofit or government agency 
and provide their services for free or for a 
reduced rate.
 lO1. The liability of newness refers to the fact 
that entrepreneurial ventures often falter 
or even fail because the people who start 
them can’t adjust quickly enough to their 
new roles and because the firm lacks a 
“track record” with customers and sup-
pliers. These limitations can be overcome 
by assembling a talented and experienced 
new-venture team.
 lO2. A new-venture team is the group of people 
who move a new venture from an idea to a 
fully functioning firm. Company founders, 
key employees, the board of directors, the 
board of advisers, lenders and investors, 
and other professionals are the primary 
elements involved with forming a new-
venture team. A heterogeneous founding 
team has members with diverse abilities 
and experiences. A homogeneous founding 
team has members who are very similar to 
one another. The personal attributes that 
affect a founder’s chances of launching a 
successful new firm include level of edu-
cation, prior entrepreneurial experience, 
relevant industry experience, and the abil-
ity to network. Networking is building and 
maintaining relationships with people who 
are similar or whose friendship could bring 
advantages to the firm.
A skills profile is a chart that depicts 
the most important skills that are needed 
in a new venture and where skills gaps 
exist. Finding good employees and effec-
tive new-venture team members is chal-
lenging. Founders may draw from their 
personal networks to find the needed tal-
ent or may ask existing employees for 
referrals.
A board of directors is a panel of indi-
viduals who is elected by a corporation’s 
shareholders to oversee the management 
of the firm. It is typically made up of both 
inside and outside directors. An inside 
director is a person who is also an officer 
of the firm. An outside director is someone 
who is not employed by the firm. When a

her own business in the advertising indus-
try. She is leaning toward incorporation 
rather than an LLC because she would 
like to attract employees by issuing stock. 
Emily is currently going through all the 
documents that need to be submitted to 
the company secretary. One of the require-
ments for setting up a corporation is the 
appointment of a board of directors. At the 
moment, she has no trouble selecting her 
inside directors. However, she is struggling 
with the appointment of outside directors. 
What should she look out for when mak-
ing her selection? Advise her.

CHAPTER 9 | BUIlDING A New-VeNTure TEAM    339
Business idea: Create a job board site that presents 
companies in a compelling manner, to make job listings 
interesting and to provide job seekers a better sense of 
what it would be like to work for a particular company.
pitch: Job boards and company profiles on job sites are 
fairly uninspiring. Usually, there is a boring description 
of a job, followed by a list of skills and educational 
background needed and a dull description of the 
company. Rarely is any insight provided about the culture 
of a company, what its work environment is like, and 
what the experiences of the people who work there have 
been. These types of insights are available if a person is 
granted an interview and visits the company in which s/
he desires to work. But there are occasions when both a 
company and an applicant spend a considerable amount 
of time learning about one another, only to go their 
separate ways when it becomes clear that the applicant 
isn’t a good fit for the culture or the work environment 
that the company has to offer. Even worse, there are 
instances where people take jobs and then discover in 
the first couple of weeks that they aren’t a good match 
with the personality and values of the company.
The Muse solves this problem by providing job appli-
cants much richer detail about a company, its culture, 
and what it would be like to work there as part of the job 
solicitation process. It starts by individually selecting the 
companies that post jobs on its site. Unlike traditional job 
sites, not all companies that apply are accepted. once a 
company is accepted, The Muse sends two employees 
to the company’s headquarters to write the copy for the 
job posting, take photos of the company’s workspace, 
and shoot video interviews of employees. The goal is to 
give job seekers as keen an insight as possible as to the 
culture of a company and the type of people who work 
there. This is a level of understanding that isn’t available 
through job sites such as Monster.com and social media 
platforms like linkedIn. The reason The Muse sends its 
own employees to create and gather the content is the 
belief that a third party can actually be more effective 
at describing a company than the company itself. Many 
companies are so steeped in their own culture and idio-
syncrasies that they’re not good at objectively describ-
ing themselves to others. The Muse’s goal isn’t to make 
every company sound like the best place in the world to 
work. Instead, the goal is to give job seekers an honest 
and realistic look at a company so they will be able to 
make an informed judgment about whether to pursue a 
specific job. Companies pay a monthly fee to post jobs 
on The Muse’s website and to recruit Muse users. You 
can view profiles of companies that are currently recruit-
ing at www.themuse.com.
The Muse offers a variety of complementary services on 
its website, including career advice.

Business idea: Design and produce a drinking water 
filter for home use that is organic and biodegradable 
and pair it with a stylish and ergonomic carafe (pitcher) 
that is elegant enough to be the centerpiece at a formal 
dinner party. offer replacement filters on a subscription 
basis so users never have to worry about running out 
of filters.
pitch: Most drinking water filters made for home use 
are difficult to use and somewhat unappealing. The 
filters are usually designed to fit on the top of a water 
pitcher, and if the user isn’t careful can easily slip off and 
spill water on the kitchen counter and floor. In addition, 
because the filters usually contain charcoal, if the water 
sits in the refrigerator too long, small flakes of charcoal 
will be visible in the water. Not too appealing, particularly 
if you’re serving the water at a dinner party.
The Soma drinking water filter and carafe were devel-
oped to solve these problems. The filter was designed 
by David Beeman, a water filtration expert, who created 
water formulas for Starbucks, Peet’s, and other global 
brands. The filter, which is shaped like a funnel, is made 
from all-natural Malaysian coconut shells, vegan silk, 
and food-based plastic. It is 100 percent organic and 
100 percent biodegradable. In contrast, most drinking 
water filters are made from plastic resin and charcoal. 
Soma filters are paired with an elegant hourglass-shaped 
carafe that is large enough to serve a family but sleek 
enough to fit in a refrigerator. It is contoured to fit com-
fortably in your hand and has a beveled edge for drip-
free pouring. The filtration process is simple and quick. 
You simply fill the carafe with tap water, let the water 
pass through the filter, and it is ready to drink. The filters 
last for two months. The combination of the filter and the

carafe delivers clean, crisp, pure, good-tasting water. 
The carafe and filter are also showpieces. Their presence 
would be appropriate as the centerpiece for a formal din-
ner party.
To relieve a pain point for its users, Soma offers a sub-
scription service for replacement filters. New filters are 
delivered every two months. As part of its commitment 
to pure, clean water, Soma denotes a portion of its sales 
to Charity: Water. A nonprofit organization, Charity: Water 
brings clean, safe drinking water to people in develop-
ing countries. Soma also contributes to environmental 
sustainability by providing an alternative to bottled water, 
which utilizes plastic bottles that must be recycled or 
disposed of. Soma launched a Kickstarter campaign 
in December 2012. The campaign reached its goal of 
$100,000 in nine days, and raised a total of $147,444 by 
the end of the campaign.

introduction
After graduating from college in 2000, Justin Gold 
spent a year in California before settling in Boulder, 
Colorado. He waited tables to pay the rent, and enjoyed 
outdoor activities, including hiking, climbing, and ex-
ploring. Justin was a vegetarian, and to get the protein 
he needed he started eating a lot of peanut butter and 
nut butter. He owned a food processor, and found that 
making peanut butter was easy. To spice things up, 
he started making different flavors of peanut butter by 
adding ingredients such as honey, cinnamon, dried 
blueberries, and banana chips. The whole idea was to 
create something for him to eat. Justin’s roommates 
loved the stuff, and kept stealing it from the refrigerator. 
To discourage the thievery, Justin, in a good-natured 
way, scrawled his name—Justin’s—across each jar.
Justin’s roommates encouraged him to set up a 
table at the Boulder Farmer’s Market to see if his nut 
butter would sell. He gave it a try and the nut butter 
was a hit. That experience got Justin thinking. To sell 
at the Boulder Farmer’s Market, he had to make his nut 
butter in an FDA-approved facility. Today, many states 
allow small producers to make certain items out of their 
homes, but that wasn’t the case in Colorado at the time. 
Justin figured that as long as he was going to the trou-
ble of using an FDA-approved kitchen to make his nut 
butter for the farmer’s market, he might approach some 
stores as well.

CHAPTER 9 | BUIlDING A New-VeNTure TEAM    341
the Beginnings of a Business
To educate himself on how to convert his hobby into a 
business, Justin did two things. First, he spent hours at 
the University of Colorado’s Business School reference 
library, thumbing through business books. He found 
a book that contained business plans, and one plan 
caught his eye. It was for a tomato canning company. 
Justin used that plan as a model for his first business 
plan. The second thing he did was reach out to others 
for advice. At one point, he went to a local grocery store 
and found the area that featured locally produced prod-
ucts. He wrote down the names and contact information 
for every area company he could find. He then reached 
out to the companies for advice. After receiving feed-
back, he wrote his first business plan in 2002. Based on 
the strength of the plan, he was able to raise $25,000 
from friends and family.
At the same time Justin raised his first funding, he 
was setting up his manufacturing process. It was hard 
to find a facility that would take him on. Making pea-
nut butter is messy—it tends to gunk up machines. So 
Justin bought a used industrial-sized food processer 
and decided to manufacturer on his own. He found a 
salsa company in Denver that rented him space. He was 
finally ready to start cranking out Justin’s Nut Butter and 
Justin’s Peanut Butter.
Justin slowly got distribution for his product. 
His goal was to get into Whole Foods Market. After 
convincing a local Whole Foods buyer to give him 
a try, he found out that he’d need to work through 
Whole Foods’s distributor. The distributor was initially 
 reluctant, but Justin persisted, and his product was 
eventually taken on by Whole Foods stores in the 
Rocky Mountain region.
Around this time, Justin switched jobs—from work-
ing as a waiter to working for REI, a chain of stores that 
sells outdoors products such as camping and climbing 
gear. Similar to other outdoors stores, REI sold Power 
Gels, which were small packages of sugary food that 
hikers and climbers bought to give them a quick en-
ergy boost. on a bike ride one day, Justin wondered 
whether he could sell his nut butter in small gel packs. 
He called everyone he could think of that placed prod-
ucts in small squeeze packs, including Heinz, which 
packages ketchup in small packs (the type of packs 
you get at a fast-food restaurant). No one offered to 
help, so he decided to go it alone. At that point, he 
rewrote his business plan to include the cost of a 
squeeze-pack machine. Based on his new idea, he 
was able to raise an additional $120,000 from friends 
and family.
The peanut butter and nut butter squeeze packs 
were initially a disappointment, largely as the result 
of a positioning mistake. They were originally posi-
tioned on shelves with protein bars and other energy-
boosting gel packs. Justin eventually asked that his 
squeeze packs be positioned next to his larger jars 
of Justin’s Nut Butter and Peanut Butter. The idea 
was that consumers, who may be reluctant to try an 
entire jar of premium-priced peanut butter, might try 
a 99-cent squeeze pack. The switch did the trick, and 
Justin’s Nut Butter and Peanut Butter squeeze packs 
starting selling.
it takes a Qualified team to grow  
a Business
Justin was now at a turning point. He wanted to further 
grow the business, but needed a sizeable amount of 
capital to purchase equipment, hire personnel, crank up 
his marketing, and so forth. He reached out to a number 
of investors. Despite his successes, they all turned him 
down. The reasons focused on two issues: first, Justin, 
himself, had no experience growing a food company, 
and second, he had never taken serious investor money 
and returned a profit.
To mitigate these concerns, Justin knew he had to 
build a team. His first step was finding an experienced 
executive. He became acquainted with lance Gentry. 
Gentry helped build Izzy, a local beverage company, 
which grew from a start-up to $25 million in sales be-
fore it was acquired by Pepsi. The only catch was that 
Justin couldn’t pay Gentry what he was worth. Gentry 
had a wife and three kids, and he needed an income. 
Justin asked Gentry what he needed to get by and 
hired him for a below-the-market salary, but he made 
up for it by giving Gentry a stake in the firm. The next 
thing Justin did was put together a board of advi-
sors. He had two criteria in selecting board members: 
(1) They had to have gray hair—meaning they had to 
be experienced; and (2) they had to have time to give 
him. Justin wasn’t putting together the advisory board 
strictly to impress investors. If he was going to take 
Justin’s to the next level, he knew that he’d need to 
lean on them for advice. Similar to Gentry, to incent the 
investors to come on board, he offered each a small 
amount of stock in Justin’s.
Justin approached a new set of investors and em-
phasized three key points. He now had (1) an experi-
enced manager on board, who had grown a successful 
company, (2) a strong board of advisors, and (3) profes-
sional manufacturers lined up to produce his product. 
The timing wasn’t good. It was 2009, which wasn’t a 
good year to raise money. No single investor bit, but 
Justin was successful in raising $1 million from 50 dif-
ferent people. Justin made sure to retain more than 50 
percent of the firm for himself, so he would remain in 
control of Justin’s.
growing the Business and expanding  
the team
Things progressed smoothly from this point forward. 
Justin’s continued to grow. In 2010, Justin got the idea 
to make peanut butter cups. His board was against it, 
but he persevered, later saying that it was the only time 
he went against the advice of his board. He wanted to 
produce an organic, all-natural peanut butter cup, as an 
alternative to Reese’s. It took time to find a chocolatier

to work with him, but he finally found a small, family-
oriented company that would make his product. Justin 
considered this to be a pivotal juncture for his com-
pany. If he could produce and sell another product, 
Justin’s could essentially become a platform from which 
multiple products could be conceived, produced, and 
sold. The peanut butter cups were a hit. They quickly 
became the biggest revenue producer for the company.
To build a team, Justin used the same formula that 
he used to land Gentry. Each employee he hired was 
paid a below-average salary but was given stock in 
Justin’s to compensate. Justin maintained that by giv-
ing everyone stock, he incented each employee to treat 
the company as if it were her or his own. The amount of 
stock varied, depending on the nature of the hire. Stock 
provided to employees was set up on a multiyear vest-
ing schedule.
Today, Justin’s products are available at Whole 
Foods Markets, Target, Safeway, Kroger, and a number of 
specialty retailers and coffee shops across the country.
Working at Justin’s
Justin’s has expanded to 24 employees. The company 
remains in Boulder. Sadly, in 2012, lance Gentry, the 
experienced executive that Justin brought on board 
in 2008, died of brain cancer. Photos of each team 
member appear on Justin’s website. The company pro-
duced a video depicting its culture and featuring some 
of its employees for entrepreneur magazine’s 2012 
Entrepreneur of the Year competition. In the video, one 
of Justin’s employees describes the company’s culture 
as follows:
“We are so innovative. We have so much fun to-
gether. We really treat one another as family. We 
joke around a lot but we get stuff done and it’s just 
such a great environment. Its super fun and Justin 
is an amazing person and an amazing leader.”
While working at Justin’s isn’t completely dis-
similar to other food companies, the company does 
have some unique quirks. The company takes all of its 
employees on a vacation each year. A recent trip was a 
cruise to Mexico. In addition, the company gives back 
by involving its employees in an initiative to provide 
aid to the Pine Ridge Native American Reservation in 
South Dakota.
merger with vmg partners
In 2013, Justin’s merged with VMG Partners, a 
California-based private equity firm. The merger netted 
Justin’s $47 million in a combination of equity, options, 
and securities. When asked to comment on the merger, 
Justin said, “The company’s growing, and the com-
pany’s growing faster than it knows how to manage.” 
Referring to the move as “smart capital,” Justin said that 
the combined company would provide better resources 
for Justin’s to maintain and further its growth. Justin 
said that the day-to-day operations of the company’s 
Boulder headquarters would not change.

CHAPTER 9 | BUIlDING A New-VeNTure TEAM    343
introduction
Zappos.com is an online shoe and apparel retailer that 
has built a strong brand and has shown impressive 
sales growth since its founding. It’s based in las Vegas, 
Nevada. The company had zero sales in 1999, $370 
million in 2005, and over $1 billion in 2008. In 2009, 
Amazon.com acquired Zappos for $1.2 billion with the 
agreement that it could operate autonomously and 
maintain its unique culture. Zappos’s formula for suc-
cess is seemingly simple. It acquires customers through 
word-of-mouth and search engine marketing (SEM) and 
then wows them with customer service that keeps them 
coming back. The popular press often touts Zappos 
as the classic example of what can be accomplished 
through exemplary customer service.
But what’s really behind Zappos’s extraordinary 
success? Its prices are slightly on the high end. Its web-
site isn’t fancy. And it sells shoes and clothing for crying 
out loud! How does Zappos consistently deliver such a 
high level of customer service that people are willing to 
buy shoes, clothing, and a variety of other items to the 
tune of $1 billion-plus per year? Read on.
Why Shoes?
Zappos was founded by Nick Swinmurn in 1999. 
Swinmurn had such a hard time finding shoes that he 
started an e-commerce company to help people just like 
himself. He was turned away by investors who thought it 
was crazy to think that people would buy shoes online. 
Seriously—who buys shoes without trying them on first? 
Swinmurn persevered, heartened by the fact that over 
$2 billion in shoes are sold via mail-order catalogs every 
year—so people do buy shoes without trying them on. 
Selling shoes is also a fundamentally good business. 
You don’t need to educate people about the product—
people know shoes. The brands are strong, and the 
margins are good. The average order on Zappos.com 
is over $130. It’s also possible to run an effective SEM 
campaign for shoes. Try this: Search Google for “Nike 
shoes,” “tennis shoes,” and “soccer shoes,” one by 
one. How many times do you see search engine ads for 
Zappos to the right of the results? Many, right?
Zappos’s original name was ShoeSite. A few months 
after the company launched, the name was changed to 
Zappos. The name “Zappos’ is a variation of “zapatos,” 
which is the Spanish name for shoes. Swinmurn decided 
to abandon the name ShoeSite because he didn’t want 
to limit the company to only selling footwear.
customer Service
According to reliable reports, customer service is what 
makes Zappos special. Call center employees don’t 
use scripts and aren’t pressed to keep calls short. The 
longest recorded call was 10 hours and 29 minutes. 
Shipping and returns are free. The warehouse is open 
24/7 so customers can place an order as late as 11 p.m. 
and still receive quick delivery. Behind the scenes, most 
orders are upgraded to next-day delivery so customers 
are pleasantly surprised when their order arrives before 
expected. Normally, the early arrival is accompanied by 
an e-mail message from Zappos saying that the order 
was upgraded to next-day delivery because you are a 
“valued customer.”
Zappos also has a very liberal return policy. It will 
take returns for up to 365 days, although most returns 
come within 30 days. About 40 percent of all items or-
dered are returned. When a customer is on the phone 
with a Zappos employee and is struggling with which 
pair of shoes to buy, the Zappos employees will suggest 
that the customer buy both pairs, and simply return the 
less desirable shoes. If Zappos’s warehouse is out of a 
pair of shoes a customer wants, Zappos will e-mail the 
customer links to other websites where the shoes are for 
sale. Zappos also does little things to help its custom-
ers. For example, its toll-free phone number is listed 
at the top of every page on its website. Employees are 
given sufficient autonomy so they can do what they be-
lieve is “right” for the customer. For example, on one oc-
casion a woman called Zappos to return a pair of boots 
for her husband because he died in a car accident. The 
next day she received a flower delivery, which the call 
center employee had billed to Zappos without checking 
with her supervisor.
What all this effort has gotten Zappos is a loyal 
customer base and word-of-mouth advertising. 
Approximately 75 percent of Zappos’s orders come from 
existing customers.
tony Hsieh
CEo Tony Hsieh is at the center of everything Zappos 
does. In his early 20s, Hsieh started a company called 
linkExchange, which let small companies barter for

banner ads. Hsieh insisted that every e-mail coming 
into the company was answered promptly and politely. 
In college, Hsieh made money by selling pizzas out of 
his Harvard dorm room. A classmate, Alfred lin, bought 
whole pizzas from Hsieh and resold them piece by 
piece, making more money. Hsieh sold linkExchange 
to Microsoft for $265 million in 1998 and he and lin 
started an angel investment fund. Zappos’s founder 
Nick Swinmurn pitched Hsieh and lin, trying to raise 
money. Hsieh was so impressed with Zappos’s mar-
ket opportunity that he invested in the firm and briefly 
served as Zappos’s co-CEo with Swinmurn. It wasn’t 
long before Hsieh and lin were running Zappos. Hsieh 
became Zappos’s CEo and lin became the CFo in the 
early 2000s.
Hsieh isn’t the typical CEo, and his values, per-
sonality, and approach to doing business have clearly 
shaped Zappos’s culture. Hsieh works in an open space 
amid a cluster of employee cubicles. He hosts employee 
parties and barbecues at his home, encourages employ-
ees to hang out after work, and spends his spare time 
studying the science of happiness. Zappos employees 
are encouraged to decorate their work spaces. Hsieh’s 
desk features jungle vines and an inflatable monkey.
Human resources
While exemplary customer service may be what keeps 
Zappos’s customers coming back, the root of the com-
pany’s competitive advantage is its human resource 
management policies. The company is fiercely protec-
tive of its culture, which has been crafted to facilitate 
its high level of customer service. It’s 10 core values, 
which define its culture, brand, and business strategies, 
are shown next. Every new employee, regardless of 
his/her assignment, is required to undergo a four-week 
customer loyalty training course, which includes at least 
two weeks of talking on the phone with customers in 
the call center. Employees enjoy free lunches, no-charge 
vending machines, a company library, a nap room, and 
free health care (although employees do pay for their 
dependents).
Zappos’s 10 core values
 1. Deliver WoW Through Service
 2. Embrace and Drive Change
 3. Create Fun and a little Weirdness
 4. Be Adventurous, Creative, and open-Minded
 5. Pursue Growth and learning
 6. Build open and Honest Relationships with 
Communication
 7. Build a Positive Team and Family Spirit
 8. Do More with less
 9. Be Passionate and Determined
 10. Be Humble
That’s not all. After training, each new customer service 
hire is given what Zappos calls “the offer.” The company 
says to each new hire, “If you quit today, we’ll pay you 
for the amount of time you’ve worked, plus $3,000.” 
Why would Zappos do this? The answer to this question 
is simply that the firm wants employees to quit if they 
don’t like the Zappos culture. The $3,000 payoff is small 
potatoes, Hsieh and his top management team believe, 
as opposed to having a half-hearted employee on the 
payroll. over 97 percent of employees who complete 
training turn down the offer.
Social media
Another distinctive aspect of Zappos is its extensive 
use of social media, which includes Twitter, Facebook, 
and YouTube. Hsieh encourages his employees to use 
social media to put a human face on the company. More 
than 500 Zappos employees have Twitter accounts, one 
of which is Hsieh, who has over 2.8 million followers. 
The company’s encouragement of Twitter use coincides 
with core value 6: Build open and Honest Relationships 
with Communication. Employees do not use Twitter to 
spam followers about Zappos’s products. Instead, they 
provide updates about what they’re doing and what it’s 
like to work at Zappos. Hsieh himself is very authentic in 
his tweets. For example, on one occasion, before going 
onstage for a tech conference, Hsieh tweeted: “Spilled 
Coke on left leg of jeans, so poured some water on right 
leg so looks like denim fade.” Hsieh also uses Twitter to 
solicit customer feedback. In his tweets, he frequently 
refers to something Zappos is doing and asks, “What 
do you think about this?” The replies he gets are from 
Zappos employees, customers, and others.
Zappos’s Facebook page provides an effective ve-
hicle for feedback and discussions with customers. Its 
YouTube channel features videos that mostly highlight 
the work culture at Zappos headquarters, including 
behind-the-scenes clips. Zappos runs several blogs, 
covering many topics related to its business.
new initiatives
Zappos has recently launched two new initiatives in 
the human resources area. The first is that it’s ditching 
conventional job postings to recruit new hires, instead 
launching Zappos Insiders, an internal social network 
design to improve the recruiting process. The site in-
vites job seekers to join a team within the network. 
They’ll receive information about the department they’re 
interested in, including an assessment of the jobs 
that come open the most frequently. Zappos employ-
ees then interact with candidates to ascertain which 
candidates represent the best fit. You can see how 
Zappos Insiders works by going to www.zappos.com/
choose_your_team.
The second new initiative is a bold one. Zappos 
is adopting a “holacracy” approach to organizing the 
company. Zappos will eliminate traditional managers, 
do away with typical corporate hierarchy, and get rid of 
job titles, at least internally. The idea is to replace the 
traditional corporate chain of command with a series of 
overlapping, self-governing teams. The idea is to give 
employees more of a voice in the way the company is 
run, and to keep Zappos lean and nimble as it contin-
ues to grow.

CHAPTER 9 | BUIlDING A New-VeNTure TEAM    345
What lies ahead
By all accounts, Amazon.com has been true to its word 
and has allowed Zappos to operate independently since 
it acquired the firm in 2009. Zappos is still quirky, is 
pushing the boundaries in regard to customer service 
and human resources management, and is reportedly 
profitable and growing. It has added to its product line—
along with shoes and clothing it now sells bags, house-
wares, beauty products, eyewear, jewelry, and a number 
of other categories of products.
Two main challenges lie ahead for Zappos with the 
first one being competition in its primary categories—
shoes and clothing. Zappos is a mainstream online 
retailer that carries shoes and clothing across the price 
gamut. Its women’s heels, for example, range from $696 
Robert Clergerie Divanas to $46.99 Soft Style choices. 
The challenge with this strategy is that Zappos is now 
being attacked by niche players at both ends of the 
price spectrum. In shoes, for example, it’s being at-
tacked from the top by high-end online retailers like 
Bluefly (www.bluefly.com), which have a larger selec-
tion of high-end shoes than Zappos does, and from the 
bottom by low-end online shoe retailers like Payless 
Shoes (www.payless.com), which sells shoes for as little 
as $9.99. A similar dynamic exists in online clothing. 
Zappos also has competition from mainline online shoe 
and clothing retailers that sell across the price spectrum 
like it does. Competitors include Shoebuy.com and 
JCPenny.com.
The second challenge is whether Zappos will be 
able to maintain its unique culture. often, the quirky 
nature of a start-up culture gives way to a more formal 
culture as a company grows and matures. Zappos 
seems to be resisting this, in part by implementing 
the new hiring practices and new way of organizing 
as described above. A wild card regarding Zappos’s 
culture is whether Tony Hsieh will remain at the helm. 
There is no indication that Hsieh plans to leave, but if 
he did, Zappos would lose its spiritual leader. A change 
in leadership at the top could result in Zappos moving 
more in the direction of a mainstream company rather 
than preserving its unusual, yet seemingly effective, 
corporate culture.
Discussion Questions
 9-41. How should Nick Swinmurn, Zappos’s founder, be 
described in terms of the qualities of a founder that 
are discussed in this chapter?
 9-42. How has Zappos gone about recruiting key employ-
ees and why are the employees so critical to the 
firm’s ongoing success?
 9-43. What steps is Zappos taking to adjust the nature of 
what has been its new-venture team for many years?
 9-44. How might consultants help Zappos deal with two 
key challenges (as mentioned in the case) the firm 
faces today?

lice Brooks and Bettina Chen met in 2012, when they were engineering 
 master’s students at Stanford University. They both noticed the lack of female 
classmates. Both had undergraduate degrees in engineering and reflected 
that females are underrepresented in undergraduate engineering 
programs too. They set out to try to put their fingers on why more 
girls aren’t attracted to engineering programs. In the accompanying 
photo, Alice Brooks is on the left and Bettina Chen is on the right.
After giving it some thought, they realized that they had two 
things in common that might explain why they chose engineering. 
First, the toys they played with when they were young instilled in 
them a love for making things. When Brooks was eight she asked 
for a Barbie Doll for Christmas and got a saw. She used the saw to 
cut up wood and nail the pieces together to make dolls and animals. 
She believes that that experience sparked in her a love for making 
things and for engineering. Similarly, as a young girl Chen spent 
hours designing things, not with a saw but with Legos. She designed 
elaborate Lego structures with her older brother, and feels that that 
instilled in her a love for making things and using her imagination. 
The second thing the two had in common was a result of the first. 
They both built skills, as youngsters, that were important to them in 
sticking with engineering.
Brooks and Chen also found that they both shared an entrepre-
neurial spirit. They decided to tackle the challenge of encouraging 
more girls to enter engineering. The idea they came up with was to 
develop a toy that would provide young girls similar experiences 
to those they benefited from as children. The toy, they reasoned, had to develop 
skills such as spatial reasoning, hands-on-problem solving, and self-confidence. 
The idea they settled on was a kit of pastel-colored pieces that girls could assemble 
into a building or any other type of structure. Once the building was built, it could be 
decorated with included paper and other embellishments, and a small motor could 
be used to add electrical appliances, fans, buzzers, or anything else that uses power. 
The kit, or toy, would come in a board game–sized box and be called Roominate.
At the same time Brooks and Chen were conceiving Roominate, they were tak-
ing a Lean Launchpad class at Stanford taught by Steve Blank. Blank is known for

encouraging students and others to “get out of the building” and talk to as many 
potential customers as possible while developing a business idea. Brooks and Chen 
followed Blank’s advice. They interacted with over 200 girls in their target age range 
(ages 6–12) to see what worked best. They also asked young girls to experiment with 
early prototypes of Roominate at local events and the Children’s Creativity Museum 
in San Francisco. They took time to talk to parents and educators and did a lot of 
prototyping. Brooks and Chen followed Blank’s class with two stints at StartX, which 
is Stanford’s start-up accelerator. Through this program they were put in touch with 
mentors and subject matter experts, such as attorneys, who helped them develop the 
business side of Roominate.
The next step was raising funds. Money was needed for two reasons. First, the 
entrepreneurs needed financial capital so they could scale production through large-
quantity orders of wood, electronics, and assembly costs. At this point, Brooks and Chen 
were assembling Roominate kits by hand, which was unsustainable. Second, because 
Roominate was designed to be played with by children under the age of 14, money was 
needed to fulfill the tests required to certify compliance with toy safety standards.
Brooks and Chen decided to launch a Kickstarter campaign. The campaign was 
launched in mid-2012 with a $25,000 goal. Pause for a moment and go to https://www.
kickstarter.com and type “Roominate” into the search box. Although the Roominate 
campaign is long since over, Kickstarter archives all campaigns indefinitely. You’ll be 
able to view the video pitch, see what the Roominate toy looks like, and examine the 
specifics of the campaign. The $25,000 goal was easily exceeded, with $85,964 raised 
from 1,154 backers. The successful Kickstarter campaign was a big plus for Brooks 
and Chen. not only did it help fund their initial production run, but the overwhelmingly 
positive response was a big confidence-builder.
Since the Kickstarter campaign concluded in mid-2012, Roominate has pro-
gressed. In defining the first three years of Roominate, Brooks characterizes year one 
(2012) as developing the product and raising money via Kickstarter, year two (2013) as 
finding customers and slowly building sales, and year three (2014) as finding retailers 
and ramping up. In 2013 and 2014, Brooks and Chen raised approximately $1 million 
from angel investors to fund the buildup. Several things happened along the way that 
demonstrated momentum, which was important in securing the angel investments. 
First, Roominate won several toy awards, which provided external validation for the 
efficacy of the idea and the product. Along with that, it attracted positive PR, including 
an appearance by Brooks and Chen on the Today Show in 2013. Second, sales started 
to build in 2013, primarily through specialty stores, the Roominate website, and via 
Amazon.com. Third, mainstream retailers, including Toys“R”Us and Walmart, started 
showing interest.
The next logical step for Roominate, in terms of funding, would be a Series A round 
of venture capital. Roominate’s ability to get to that point will depend on whether it dem-
onstrates broad product acceptance and is seen as a potential high-growth business.

n this chapter, we focus on the process of getting financing or funding. We 
begin by discussing why firms raise capital. We follow this with a description 
of personal financing and the importance of personal funds, capital from 
friends and family, and bootstrapping in the early life of a firm. We then turn 
to the different forms of equity, debt, and creative financing available to entre-
preneurial ventures. We also emphasize the importance of preparing to secure 
these types of financing.

the importance of getting Financing 
or Funding
Few people deal with the process of raising investment capital until they need 
to raise capital for their own firm. As a result, many entrepreneurs go about 
the task of raising capital haphazardly, because they lack experience in this 
area and because they don’t know much about their choices.1 This shortfall 
may cause a business owner to place too much reliance on some sources of 
capital and not enough on others.2 Entrepreneurs need to have as full an 
understanding as possible of the alternatives that are available in regard to 
raising money. And raising money is a balancing act. Although a venture may 
need to raise money to survive, its founders usually don’t want to deal with 
people who don’t understand or care about their long-term goals.
The need to raise money surprises a number of entrepreneurs, in that 
many of them launch their firms with the intention of funding all their needs 
internally. Commonly, though, entrepreneurs discover that operating without 
investment capital or borrowed money is more difficult than they anticipated. 
Because of this, it is important for entrepreneurs to understand the role of in-
vestment capital in the survival and subsequent success of a new firm.
Why Most new ventures need Funding
There are three reasons that most entrepreneurial ventures need to raise 
money during their early life: cash flow challenges, capital investments, and 
lengthy product development cycles. These reasons are laid out in Figure 10.1. 
Let’s look at each reason so we can better understand their importance.
cash flow challenges
As a firm grows, it requires an increasing amount of cash to operate as the 
foundation for serving its customers. Often, equipment must be purchased and 
new employees hired and trained before the increased customer base generates 
additional income. The lag between spending to generate revenue and earning 
income from the firm’s operations creates cash flow challenges, particularly for 
new, often small, ventures, as well as for ventures that are growing rapidly.
If a firm operates in the red, its negative real-time cash flow, usually com-
puted monthly, is called its burn rate. A company’s burn rate is the rate at 
which it is spending its capital until it reaches profitability. Although a nega-
tive cash flow is sometimes justified early in a firm’s life—to build plants and 
buy equipment, train employees, and establish its brand—it can cause severe 
complications. A firm usually fails if it burns through all its capital before it 
becomes profitable. This is why inadequate financial resources is a primary 
reason new firms fail.3 A firm can simply run out of money even if it has good 
products and satisfied customers.

352    PART 3 | MOvIng FROM An IDEA TO An EnTREPREnEURIAL FIRM
To prevent their firms from running out of money, most entrepreneurs 
need investment capital or a line of credit from a bank to cover cash flow short-
falls until their firms can begin making money. It is usually difficult for a new 
firm to get a line of credit from a bank (for reasons discussed later). Because 
of this, new ventures often look for investment capital, bootstrap their opera-
tions, or try to arrange some type of creative financing.
capital investments
Firms often need to raise money early on to fund capital investments. Although it 
may be possible for the venture’s founders to fund its initial activities, it becomes 
increasingly difficult for them to do so when it comes to buying property, con-
structing buildings, purchasing equipment, or investing in other capital projects. 
Many entrepreneurial ventures are able to delay or avoid these types of expendi-
tures by leasing space or co-opting the resources of alliance partners. However, at 
some point in its growth cycle, the firm’s needs may become specialized enough 
that it makes sense to purchase capital assets rather than rent or lease them.
lengthy product Development cycles
In some industries, firms need to raise money to pay the up-front costs of 
lengthy product development cycles. For example, it typically takes between 
one and a half and two years to develop an electronic game. In the biotech 
industry, the path to commercial licensing takes approximately eight years.4 
This tortoise-like pace of product development requires substantial up-front 
investment before the anticipated payoff is realized. While the biotech industry 
is an extreme example, lengthy product development cycles are the realities 
ventures face in many industries.
To meet these challenges, and others described in the chapter and 
throughout the book, many entrepreneurs like to partner with others to launch 
their ventures. A fertile place for young entrepreneurs to find potential busi-
ness partners is to attend a Startup Weekend. A description of what Startup 
Weekend is and why it represents a fertile place to find a business partner is

Approximately 95 percent of Startup Weekend ideas are 
mobile or Web focused (regardless of the theme), thus 
the need for developers, coders, and designers. The idea 
is not to conceive an idea for a business. The idea is to 
build a business.
sunday: Teams continue their work from morning until 
mid-afternoon. Around 3 to 4 p.m., they start wrapping 
things up and practicing their presentations. After the 
judges arrive, presentations begin. The initial 50-person 
group is now ten 5-person teams. The judges select the 
top teams, give out awards, and the event ends—with 
just 54 hours from first hearing an idea to the birth of a 
business.
Afterwards: Whether the team stays together after 
the Startup Weekend concludes is strictly up to the mem-
bers of the team. About 55 percent of Startup Weekend 
participants continue working on their idea with their 
team intact. Approximately 23 percent continue work-
ing together with some of their team members. Thus, for 
participants, Startup Weekend is a fertile place to find a 
team of people to work with on a business idea. To learn 
whether a Startup Weekend is being planned for your city 
or area, simply access the “Upcoming Events” link on 
Startup Weekend’s website.
There is a version of Startup Weekend called 3 Day 
Startup that is designed specifically for college campuses. 
It is a for-profit organization, but provides more structure 
and support than Startup Weekend provides. You can 
learn more about 3 Day Startup at 3daystartup.org.
Questions for Critical Thinking
 1. In referring to Startup Weekend, someone made the 
comment “It’s not a start-up factory, it’s an entrepre-
neur factory.” What do you think the person meant by 
that comment?
 2. To what degree do you agree with the basic premise of 
the feature that Startup Weekends represent a fertile 
place to meet business co-founders?
 3. What can people learn by attending a Startup 
Weekend, even if they ultimately do not stay together 
with their team after the weekend ends?
 4. Spend some time looking at the website for 3 Day 
Startup. how do Startup Weekend and 3 Day Startup 
compare? Are both equally suited for college student 
entrepreneurs?

tartup Weekend is a not-for-profit organization that 
organizes weekend events. The purpose is to cre-
ate a context in which small groups of people 
conceive and start a business in 54 hours. Startup 
Weekends are held periodically in local communities 
and on college campuses across the United States. 
Since Startup Weekend launched in 2006, the organi-
zation has helped local volunteers put on over 1,500 
Startup Weekend events in 726 cities. The events have 
involved over 123,000 entrepreneurs. Over 13,000 busi-
nesses have been started during Startup Weekend 
events.
here’s how it works. Each Startup Weekend is semi-
autonomous and is organized by a group of local volun-
teers. The local volunteers get support through Startup 
Weekend’s events team, which is located in Seattle, 
Washington. The local volunteers pick the date, find a 
venue to hold the event, and organize the weekend. A 
typical Startup Weekend attracts 60-120 people. The ideal 
mix of participants is 50 percent technical (developers, 
coders, designers) and 50 percent business (marketing, 
finance, law). The only requirement for admission (other 
than a nominal admission fee) is to have a passion for en-
trepreneurship and a willingness to work with like-minded, 
motivated people to develop a product or business in one 
weekend.
Many Startup Weekends are organized around themes. 
Examples include Fashion & Tech, Mobile, Education, 
health & Wellness, and Food. A Startup Weekend is orga-
nized as follows.
friday: Participants arrive between 5 and 7 p.m., be-
gin networking, and eat dinner. After a short ice-breaking 
exercise, the pitches begin. Anyone is welcome to make 
a 60-second pitch of a business idea. If the Startup 
Weekend is a themed weekend (like Fashion & Tech or 
health & Wellness), all the pitches must adhere to the 
theme. After the pitches are finished, all attendees vote on 
their favorites. The top ideas are selected to be worked on 
for the weekend. Teams form organically and consolidate, 
and the work begins.
saturday: Teams work all day, with the occasional 
breaks to eat. Mentors and coaches circulate to provide 
support and advice. Individual team members reach out 
to people in their networks (typically via text or e-mail) 
to solicit feedback and advice. The pace is quick and 
intense, and the business idea may iterate multiple times. 
A path forward is eventually agreed upon and a rough 
prototype takes shape. Most teams build a website.

sources of personal Financing
Typically, the seed money that gets a company off the ground comes from the 
founders’ own pockets. There are three categories of sources of money in this 
area: personal funds, friends and family, and bootstrapping. These sources are 
depicted in Figure 10.2 and are explained next.
personal funds
The vast majority of founders contribute personal funds along with sweat 
equity to their ventures.5 In fact, according to data complied by Fundable, 
57 percent of start-ups are funded by the entrepreneurs’ personal savings 
and credit. The average amount invested is $48,000.6 Sweat equity, which 
represents the value of the time and effort that a founder puts into a new 
venture, is also important. Because many founders do not have a substan-
tial amount of cash to put into their ventures, it is often the sweat equity 
that makes the most difference.
friends and family
Friends and family are the second source of funds for many new ventures. 
According to the same Fundable data, 38 percent of start-ups are funded by 
friends and family, with an average investment of $23,000.7 This type of con-
tribution often comes in the form of loans or investments, but can also involve 
outright gifts, foregone or delayed compensation (if a friend or family member 
works for the new venture), or reduced or free rent. For example, Cisco Systems, 
the giant producer of Internet routers and switches, started in the house of one 
of its co-founder’s parents.
There are three rules of thumb that entrepreneurs should follow when 
asking friends and family members for money. First, the request should be 
presented in a businesslike manner, just like one would deal with a banker or 
investor. The potential of the business along with the risks involved should be 
carefully and fully described. Second, if the help the entrepreneur receives is 
in the form of a loan, a promissory note should be prepared, with a repayment 
schedule, and the note should be signed by both parties. Stipulating the terms 
of the loan in writing reduces the potential of a misunderstanding and protects 
both the entrepreneur and the friend or family member providing the funding. 
Third, financial help should be requested only from those who are in a legiti-
mate position to offer assistance. It’s not a good idea to ask certain friends or 
family members, regardless of how much they may have expressed a willing-
ness to help, for assistance if losing the money would cripple them financially. 
Entrepreneurs who are unable to repay a loan to a friend or family member 
risk not only damaging their business relationship with them, but their per-
sonal relationship as well.8

LendingKarma (www.lendingkarma.com) helps people involved with friends 
and family develop loan documents and then track the loans. Following a sim-
ple set of online commands, a user can select a loan amount, designate if he 
or she is the borrower or lender, and set various options such as interest rate, 
payment frequency, and length of loan. A promissory note, in PDF format, can 
then be created, along with an amortization schedule. Two tiers of service are 
available. The premium service, which costs $59.95 per loan, includes all of 
the above plus online payment tracking and end-of-year reporting, and it al-
lows the parties involved to modify loan documents during repayment. A more 
basic-service alternative costs $29.95 per loan.9 For people who only need 
documents prepared, online document preparation and filing services such as 
LegalZoom.com and RocketLawyer.com are available. Accountants, attorneys, 
and bankers can also help individuals structure their loan agreements.
Bootstrapping
Bootstrapping is a third source of seed money for new ventures. Bootstrapping 
is finding ways to avoid the need for external financing or funding through 
creativity, ingenuity, thriftiness, cost-cutting, or any means necessary.10 (The 
term comes from the adage “pull yourself up by your bootstraps.”) It is the 
term attached to the general philosophy of minimizing start-up expenses by 
aggressively pursuing cost-cutting techniques and money-saving tactics. There 
are many well-known examples of entrepreneurs who bootstrapped to get their 
companies started. Legend has it that Steve Jobs and partner Steve Wozniak 
sold a Volkswagen van and a Hewlett-Packard programmable calculator to 
raise $1,350, which was the initial seed capital for Apple Computer.
There are many ways entrepreneurs bootstrap to raise money or cut costs. 
Some of the more common examples of bootstrapping are provided in Table 10.1. 
A simple example of bootstrapping is that fax machines are no longer an absolute 
necessity, in most cases. There are several Web-based services that allow busi-
nesses to fax documents for free or for a small monthly fee, as long as they have 
a scanner and are able to scan the document into a word processing program. 
The document can then be sent to the recipient’s fax machine and it will print 
out as a normal fax. Examples of companies that offer variations of this service 
are eFax, MyFax, and OnlineFaxes. The overarching point is that a little ingenu-
ity (learning how to fax for free, for example) can save an entrepreneur the cost of 
purchasing a fax machine.
While bootstrapping and using personal funds are highly recommended 
actions in almost all start-up situations, there are subtle downsides. Cost-
cutting and saving money are admirable practices, but pushing these practices 
too far can hold a business back from reaching its full potential. For example, 
renting space in a community incubator or building where other start-ups are 
Table 10.1  examples of bootstrapping Methods
■ Buy used instead of new equipment
■ Coordinate purchases with other businesses
■ Lease equipment instead of buying
■ Obtain payments in advance from customers
■ Minimize personal expenses
■ Avoid unnecessary expenses, such as lavish office space or furniture
■ Buy items cheaply, but prudently, through discount outlets or online auctions such as eBay, 
rather than at full-price stores
■ Share office space or employees with other businesses
■ hire interns

located, rather than working from home, may be worth it if it provides entre-
preneurs access to a network of people who can be relied on to provide social 
support and business advice.11
preparing to raise Debt or equity 
Financing
Once a start-up’s financial needs exceed what personal funds, friends and fam-
ily, and bootstrapping can provide, debt and equity are the two most common 
sources of funds. The most important thing an entrepreneur must do at this 
point is determine precisely what the company needs and the most appropriate 
source to use to obtain those funds. A carefully planned approach to raising 
money increases a firm’s chance of success and can save an entrepreneur con-
siderable time.
The steps involved in properly preparing to raise debt or equity financing 
are shown in Figure 10.3 and are discussed next.
Step 1 Determine precisely how much money the company needs. 
Constructing and analyzing documented cash flow statements and 
projections for needed capital expenditures are actions taken to 
complete this step. This information should already be in the busi-
ness plan, as described in Chapter 6. Knowing exactly how much 
money to ask for is important for at least two reasons. First, a com-
pany doesn’t want to get caught short, yet it doesn’t want to pay for 
capital it doesn’t need. Second, entrepreneurs talking to a potential 
lender or investor make a poor impression when they appear uncer-
tain about the amount of money required to support their venture.
Step 2 Determine the most appropriate type of financing or funding. 
Equity and debt financing are the two most common alternatives 
for raising money. Equity financing (or funding) means exchanging 
partial ownership of a firm, usually in the form of stock, in return 
for funding. Angel investors, private placement, venture capital, and 
initial public offerings are the most common sources of equity fund-
ing (we discuss all these sources later in the chapter). Equity funding 
is not a loan—the money that is received is not paid back. Instead, 
equity investors become partial owners of the firm. Some equity in-
vestors invest “for the long haul” and are content to receive a return 
on their investment through dividend payments on their stock. More 
commonly, equity investors have a three- to five-year investment 
horizon and expect to get their money back, along with a substan-
tial capital gain, through the sale of their stock. The stock is typi-
cally sold following a liquidity event, which is an occurrence that 
converts some or all of a company’s stock into cash. The three most 
common liquidity events for a new venture are when it goes public, 
finds a buyer, or merges with another company.

Preparation for Debt or 
Equity Financing

ChAPTER 10 | gETTIng Financing OR FUnDIng    357
Because of the risks involved, equity investors are very demand-
ing and fund only a small percentage of the business plans they 
consider.12 An equity investor considers a firm that has a unique 
business opportunity, high growth potential, a clearly defined niche 
market, and proven management to be an ideal candidate. In con-
trast, businesses that don’t fit these criteria have a hard time get-
ting equity funding. Many entrepreneurs are not familiar with the 
standards that equity investors apply and get discouraged when 
they are repeatedly turned down by venture capitalists and angel 
investors. Often, the reason they don’t qualify for venture capital 
or angel investment isn’t because their business proposal is poor, 
but because they don’t meet the exacting standards equity investors 
usually apply.13
Debt financing is getting a loan. The most common sources of debt 
financing are commercial banks and Small Business Administration 
(SBA) guaranteed loans. The types of bank loans and SBA guaranteed 
loans available to entrepreneurs are discussed later in this chapter. In 
general, banks lend money that must be repaid with interest. Banks 
are not investors. As a result, bankers are interested in minimizing 
risk, properly collateralizing loans, and repayment, as opposed to re-
turn on investment and capital gains. The ideal candidate for a bank 
loan is a firm with a strong cash flow, low leverage, audited financial 
statements, good management, and a healthy balance sheet. A care-
ful review of these criteria demonstrates why it’s difficult for start-ups 
to receive bank loans. Most start-ups are simply too early in their life 
cycle to have the set of characteristics bankers want.
Table 10.2 provides an overview of three common profiles of new 
ventures and the type of financing or funding that is appropriate for 
each one. This table illustrates why most start-ups must rely on per-
sonal funds, friends and family, and bootstrapping at the outset and 
must wait until later to obtain equity or debt financing. Indeed, most 
new ventures do not have the characteristics required by bankers 
or investors until they have proven their product or service idea and 
have achieved a certain measure of success in the marketplace.
Step 3 Developing a strategy for engaging potential investors or  bankers. 
There are three steps to developing a strategy for engaging potential 
investors or bankers. First, the lead entrepreneurs in a new venture 
should prepare an elevator speech (or pitch)—a brief, carefully con-
structed statement that outlines the merits of a business opportunity. 
Why is it called an elevator speech? If an entrepreneur stepped into 
an elevator on the 25th floor of a building and found that by a stroke 
of luck a potential investor was in the same elevator, the entrepreneur 
would have the time it takes to get from the 25th floor to the ground 
floor to try to get the investor interested in the business opportunity. 
Most elevator speeches are 45 seconds to 2 minutes long.14
There are many occasions when a carefully constructed elevator speech 
might come in handy. For example, many university-sponsored centers for 
entrepreneurship hold events that bring investors and entrepreneurs together. 
Often, these events include social hours and refreshment breaks designed spe-
cifically for the purpose of allowing entrepreneurs looking for funding to mingle 
with potential investors. An outline for a 60-second elevator speech is provided 
in Table 10.3.
The second step in developing a strategy for engaging potential investors 
or bankers is more deliberate and requires identifying and contacting the best 
prospects. First, the new venture should carefully assess the type of financing 

358    PART 3 | MOvIng FROM An IDEA TO An EnTREPREnEURIAL FIRM
or funding it is likely to qualify for, as depicted in Table 10.2. Then, a list of 
potential bankers or investors should be compiled. If venture capital funding 
is felt to be appropriate, for example, a little legwork can go a long way in pin-
pointing likely investors. A new venture should identify the venture funds that 
are investing money in the industry in which it intends to compete and target 
those firms first. To do this, look to the venture capital firms’ websites. These 
reveal the industries in which the firms have an interest. Sometimes, these 
sites also provide a list of the companies the firm has funded. For an example, 
access the website of Sequoia Capital (www.sequoiacap.com), a well-known 
venture capital firm.
A cardinal rule for approaching a banker or an investor is to get a personal 
introduction. Bankers and investors receive many business plans, and most 
of them end up in what often becomes an unread stack of paper in a corner in 
their offices. To have your business plan noticed, find someone who knows the 
banker or the investor and ask for an introduction.
The third step in engaging potential investors or bankers is to be prepared 
to provide the investor or banker a completed business plan and make a pre-
sentation of the plan if requested. We looked at how to present a business plan 
in Chapter 6. The presentation should be as polished as possible and should 
demonstrate why the new venture represents an attractive endeavor for the 
lender or investor.

sources of equity Funding
The primary disadvantage of equity funding is that the firm’s owners relin-
quish part of their ownership interest and may lose some control. The primary 
advantage is access to capital. In addition, because investors become partial 
owners of the firms in which they invest, they often try to help those firms by 
offering their expertise and assistance. Unlike a loan, the money received from 
an equity investor doesn’t have to be paid back. The investor receives a return 
on the investment through dividend payments and by selling the stock.
The three most common forms of equity funding are described next.
Business Angels
Business angels are individuals who invest their personal capital directly 
in start-ups. The term angel was first used in conjunction with finance to 
describe wealthy New Yorkers who invested in Broadway plays. The proto-
typical business angel, who invests in entrepreneurial start-ups, is about 
50 years old, has high income and wealth, is well educated, has succeeded as 
an entrepreneur, and invests in companies that are in the region where he or 
she lives.15 These investors generally invest between $10,000 and $500,000 
in a single company and are looking for companies that have the potential 
to grow 30 to 40 percent per year before they are acquired or go public.16 
Many well-known firms have received their initial funding from one or more 
business angels. For example, Apple received its initial investment capital 
from Mike Markkula, who obtained his wealth as an executive with Intel. In 
1977, Markkula invested $91,000 in Apple and personally guaranteed an-
other $250,000 in credit lines. When Apple went public in 1980, his stock 
in the company was worth more than $150 million.17 Similarly, in 1998, 
Google received its first investment from Sun Microsystems’s co-founder Andy 
Bechtolsheim, who gave Larry Page and Sergey Brin (Google’s co-founders) a 
check for $100,000 after they showed him an early version of Google’s search 
engine.18 Can you imagine what Bechtolsheim’s investment was worth when 
Google went public in 2005?
The number of angel investors in the United States, which is estimated to 
be around 298,800, has increased dramatically over the past decade.19 The 
rapid increase is due in part to the high returns that some angels report. In 
2013, angels invested $24.8 billion, an increase of 8.3 percent over 2012. The 
average deal size was $350,830, which generally included more than one in-
vestor.20 Software accounted for the largest share of angel investment in 2013, 
with 23 percent of total investment, followed by Media (16 percent), Healthcare 
Services/Medical Devices and Equipment (14 percent), Biotech (11 percent),

Retail (7 percent), and Financial Services/Business Products and Services 
(7 percent). The average equity received was 12.5 percent with deal valuation 
at $2.8 million. According to the Center for Venture Research at the University 
of New Hampshire, in 2013, 21.6 percent of start-ups that were able to get in 
front of angel investors received investments. This is a relatively high percent-
age. Historically, the number has been closer to 15 percent.21
Business angels are valuable because of their willingness to make rela-
tively small investments. This gives access to equity funding to a start-up 
that needs just $75,000 rather than the $1 million minimum investment 
that most venture capitalists require. Many angels are also motivated by 
more than financial returns; they enjoy the process of mentoring a new 
firm. Most angels remain fairly anonymous and are matched up with en-
trepreneurs through referrals. To find a business angel investor, an entre-
preneur should discreetly work a network of acquaintances to see if anyone 
can make an appropriate introduction. An advantage that college students 
have in regard to finding business angels is that many angels judge col-
lege- or  university-sponsored business plan or business model competitions. 
The number of organized groups of angels continues to grow. Typically, 
each group consists of 10 to 150 angel investors in a local area that meet 
regularly to listen to business plan presentations. An example of an an-
gel group is Ann Arbor Angels (www.annarborangels.org) located in Ann 
Arbor, Michigan. The group invests in early-stage technology companies in 
Southeast Michigan. Similar to most angel groups, a small committee of 
members screens investment applications and determines the start-ups that 
will pitch to the larger group. The group itself does not make investments. 
Instead, investment decisions are made independently by each member, of-
ten in partnership with other members.22
According to Fundable, angel investors invest in approximately 61,900 com-
panies per year, which is 16 times the number of investments made by venture 
capitalists.23
venture capital
Venture capital is money that is invested by venture capital firms in start-ups 
and small businesses with exceptional growth potential.24 There are about 875 
venture capital firms in existence, which have approximately $193 billion un-
der management. In 2013, venture capital firms invested $29.6 billion in just 
over 4,041 deals.25 The peak year for venture capital investing was 2000, when 
$98.6 billion was invested at the height of the e-commerce craze. A distinct dif-
ference between angel investors and venture capital firms is that angels tend 
to invest earlier in the life of a company, whereas venture capitalists come in 
later. The majority of venture capital money goes to follow-on funding for busi-
nesses that were originally funded by angel investors, government programs 
(which are discussed later in the chapter), or by some other means.
Venture capital firms are limited partnerships of money managers who 
raise money in “funds” to invest in start-ups and growing firms. The funds, 
or pools of money, are raised from high-net-worth individuals, pension plans, 
university endowments, foreign investors, and similar sources. In 2013, the 
average fund size was $110.3 million.26 The investors who invest in venture 
capital funds are called limited partners. The venture capitalists, who man-
age the fund, are called general partners. The venture capitalists who manage 
the fund receive an annual management fee in addition to 20 to 25 percent of 
the profits earned by the fund. The percentage of the profits the venture capi-
talists get is called the carry. So if a venture capital firm raised a $100 million 
fund and the fund grew to $500 million, a 20 percent carry means that the 
firm would get, after repaying the original $100 million, 20 percent of the $400 

ChAPTER 10 | gETTIng Financing OR FUnDIng    361
million in profits, or $80 million. Some venture capital firms invest in specific 
areas. For example, Foundry Group invests in information technology start-
ups.27 Similarly, BEV Capital invests exclusively in consumer-oriented busi-
nesses, such as 1800diapers and Redfin.28
Because of the venture capital industry’s lucrative nature and because in 
the past venture capitalists have funded high-profile successes such as Google, 
Facebook, Dropbox, and Twitter, the industry receives a great deal of attention. 
But actually, venture capitalists fund very few entrepreneurial ventures in com-
parison to business angels and relative to the number of firms seeking funding. 
According to the 2014 National Venture Capital Yearbook, for every 100 busi-
ness plans that are submitted to venture capital firms for funding, only 10 get 
a serious look and only one is funded.29 As mentioned earlier in this chapter, 
many entrepreneurs become discouraged when they are repeatedly rejected for 
venture capital funding, even though they may have an excellent business plan. 
Venture capitalists are looking for the “home run.” The result is that the major-
ity of business plans do not get funded.
Still, for the firms that qualify, venture capital is a viable alternative to 
equity funding. An advantage to obtaining this funding is that venture capi-
talists are extremely well connected in the business world (by this we mean 
that they have a large number of useful contacts with customers, suppliers, 
government representatives, and so forth) and can offer a firm considerable 
assistance beyond funding. Firms that qualify typically obtain their money 
in stages that correspond to their own stage of development. Once a venture 
capitalist makes an investment in a firm, subsequent investments are made 
in rounds (or stages) and are referred to as follow-on funding. Table 10.4 
shows the various stages in the venture capital process, from the seed stage 
to buyout financing.
An important part of obtaining venture capital funding is going through the 
due diligence process, which refers to the process of investigating the merits 
of a potential venture and verifying the key claims made in the business plan. 
Firms that prove to be suitable for venture capital funding should conduct 
their own due diligence of the venture capitalists with whom they are working

362    PART 3 | MOvIng FROM An IDEA TO An EnTREPREnEURIAL FIRM
to ensure that they are a good fit. An entrepreneur should ask the following 
questions and scrutinize the answers to them before accepting funding from a 
venture capital firm:
■ Do the venture capitalists have experience in our industry?
■ Do they take a highly active or passive management role?
■ Are the personalities on both sides of the table compatible?
■ Does the firm have deep enough pockets or sufficient contacts within the 
venture capital industry to provide follow-on rounds of financing?
■ Is the firm negotiating in good faith in regard to the percentage of our firm 
they want in exchange for their investment?
Along with traditional venture capital, there is also corporate venture 
 capital. This type of capital is similar to traditional venture capital except that 
the money comes from corporations that invest in start-ups related to their areas 
of interest. Corporate venture capital firms provide an estimated 10.5 percent 
of the venture capital invested by all venture groups. Examples of corporate 
venture capital firms include Intel Capital, Google Ventures, and Time Warner 
Investments.
Just because a firm receives venture capital funding doesn’t mean it’s a 
sure success. In fact, venture-funded firms are under extreme pressure to per-
form to meet investors’ expectations. A firm that received venture capital fund-
ing, DrawQuest, and regrettably failed is profiled in the “What Went Wrong?” 
feature. The feature includes a heartfelt statement by its founder, Chris Poole, 
which provides unique insight into how failing after taking money from ven-
ture capitalists feels.
initial public offering
Another source of equity funding is to sell stock to the public by staging an 
initial public offering (IPO). An IPO is the first sale of stock by a firm to 
the public. Any later public issuance of shares is referred to as a secondary 
market offering. When a company goes public, its stock is typically traded on 
one of the major stock exchanges. Most entrepreneurial firms that go public

rawQuest was launched in February 2013 by 
Christopher Poole. It was a pivot—an earlier version 
of the product was called Canvas. DrawQuest was 
an app built for the iPad, iPhone, and iPad Touch. The 
idea was to encourage creativity through a daily drawing 
challenge.
here’s how it worked. Each day, a drawing challenge 
was posted. The DrawQuest screen would display part 
of a picture and challenge the user to complete it. For 
example, the screen might show a picture of a child 
looking out into the water, and the challenge would be 
“What’s in the water?” The user would then complete 
the picture. Other examples include a screen with a hat 
at the top, and the challenge would be “Who’s wearing 
the hat?” Similarly the screen might include a person 
standing on a balcony, and the challenge would be 
“What can you see from the balcony?” The DrawQuest 
app provided a basic kit of online drawing tools to com-
plete the picture. The point wasn’t to create an elegant 
drawing. In fact, the tools resulted in the drawings being 
somewhat cartoonish in nature. The point was to force 
people to be creative by deciding what to put in the 
water or what could be seen from the balcony. The app 
and the basic set of drawing tools were free. DrawQuest 
made money be selling upgrades to the kit of drawing 
tools, like better brushes, additional palettes of paint, 
more vivid colors, and so forth.
The app itself did well. In the short year it was in exis-
tence it reached 1.4 million downloads, 550,000 registered 
users, 400,000 monthly users, and 25,000 daily users. One 
of the draws was becoming part of the DrawQuest com-
munity. You could follow friends and view the drawings 
that they drew. One of the coolest features was instant 
replay. You could watch a replay of a friend drawing his or 
her picture.
To fund the venture, DrawQuest raised money from 
marquee investors. A $625,000 seed fund was raised 
in 2010 (when the founders were working on a different 
app), and $3 million was raised in two subsequent ven-
ture rounds from Union Square ventures, Andreessen 
horowitz, Lerer ventures, Chris Dixon, and several others. 
Despite all of this, DrawQuest failed. What went wrong?
In a heartfelt bog post titled “Today my startup failed” 
and in an interview with TechCrunch, Poole outlined the 
reasons that led to DrawQuest’s demise. In short, the 
company never figured out the business side of the ven-
ture. The in-app upgrades, such as better paintbrushes 
and enhanced palettes of paint, didn’t sell as well as 
anticipated, leaving DrawQuest with insufficient income. 
Part of the problem was that users didn’t feel a sense of 
urgency to upgrade. A large portion of Candy Crush’s 
success, for example, is that people buy extra lives. 
DrawQuest didn’t have the same emotional “I can’t play 
if I don’t pay” urgency. Another problem was that the app 
was expensive to develop and maintain. In a sobering 
note to DrawQuest users, explaining that the app would 
be shut down, Poole wrote:
“While the app and community have come to-
gether in a spectacular fashion, the business side 
of things hasn’t gone as well as we had hoped. 
You may not realize it, but DrawQuest represents 
of work hours from a very talented seven-person 
team, who all need to put food on the table and a 
roof over their heads—not to mention a small army 
of servers to keep the app running smoothly and 
Questbot happy.”
Another issue DrawQuest encountered was the pivot 
that Poole and his team executed. Prior to DrawQuest, 
the team built an app named Canvas that didn’t work 
out. They pivoted to DrawQuest, which resonated better 
with users and drew a larger audience. The problem is 
that they spent half their investors’ money on Canvas. 
Referring to that challenge, Poole wrote, “We built this 
app (DrawQuest) with less than half of our runway re-
maining. You have to do twice as much with half as 
much money. It’s really freaking hard.”
Ultimately, Poole and his team decided to pull the 
plug. They investigated selling DrawQuest to another 
company, but no one bit. In the blog post titled “Today 
my startup failed,” Poole provided insight into the human 
side of business failure. he wrote:
“I’m disappointed that I couldn’t produce a better 
outcome for those who supported me the most—
my investors and employees. Few in business will 
know the pain of what it means to fail as a venture-
backed CEO. not only do you fail your employees, 
your customers, and yourself, but you fail your 
investors—partners who helped you bring your idea 
to life.”
Questions for Critical Thinking
 1. Examine the problems that DrawQuest encountered. 
how could the company have avoided or navigated 
around each problem?
 2. What alternatives did DrawQuest have for generating 
income for its app? Why do you think the company 
didn’t try any of these alternatives before shutting 
down?
 3. Based on what you learned in Chapter 4, complete 
a Barringer/Ireland Business Model template for 
DrawQuest. Is there anything that is noticeable in the 
business model template that may have forecast that 
DrawQuest would have a hard time surviving?

trade on the NASDAQ, which is weighted heavily toward technology, biotech, 
and small-company stocks.30 An IPO is an important milestone for a firm.31 
Typically, a firm is not able to go public until it has demonstrated that it is vi-
able and has a bright future.
Firms decide to go public for several reasons. First, it is a way to raise 
equity capital to fund current and future operations. Second, an IPO raises 
a firm’s public profile, making it easier to attract high-quality customers, alli-
ance partners, and employees. Third, an IPO is a liquidity event that provides 
a mechanism for the company’s stockholders, including its investors, to cash 
out their investments. Finally, by going public, a firm creates another form 
of currency that can be used to grow the company. It is not uncommon for 
one firm to buy another company by paying for it with stock rather than with 
cash.32 The stock comes from “authorized but not yet issued stock,” which in 
essence means that the firm issues new shares of stock to make the purchase. 
Examples of well-known firms that have gone public in recent years include 
Facebook, Twitter, GrubHub, Alibaba, and King Digital Entertainment (maker 
of the popular mobile game Candy Crush Saga).
Although there are many advantages to going public, it is a complicated 
and expensive process and subjects firms to substantial costs related to SEC 
reporting requirements. Many of the most costly requirements were initiated by 
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act is a federal law that 
was passed in response to corporate accounting scandals involving prominent 
corporations, such as Enron and WorldCom. This wide-ranging act established 
a number of new or enhanced reporting standards for public corporations.
The first step in initiating a public offering is for a firm to hire an invest-
ment bank. An investment bank is an institution that acts as an underwriter 
or agent for a firm issuing securities.33 The investment bank acts as the firm’s 
advocate and adviser and walks it through the process of going public. The 
most important issues the firm and its investment bank must agree on are the 
amount of capital needed by the firm, the type of stock to be issued, the price 
of the stock when it goes public (e.g., $20 per share), and the cost to the firm 
to issue the securities.
There are a number of hoops the investment bank must jump through to 
assure the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that the offer is legiti-
mate. During the time the SEC is investigating the potential offering, the in-
vestment bank issues a preliminary prospectus that describes the offering to 
the general public. The preliminary prospectus is also called the “red herring.” 
After the SEC has approved the offering, the investment bank issues the final 
prospectus, which sets a date and issuing price for the offering.
In addition to getting the offering approved, the investment bank is respon-
sible for drumming up support for the offering. As part of this process, the in-
vestment bank typically takes the top management team of the firm wanting to 
go public on a road show, which is a whirlwind tour that consists of meetings 
in key cities, where the firm presents its business plan to groups of investors.34 
Until December 1, 2005, the presentations made during these road shows 
were seen only by the investors physically present in the various cities; an SEC

regulation went into effect at that time requiring that road show presentations 
be taped and made available to the public. Road show presentations can be 
viewed online at www.retailroadshow.com. If enough interest in a potential 
public offering is created, the offering will take place on the date scheduled in 
the prospectus. If there isn’t, the offering will be delayed or canceled.
Timing and luck play a role in whether a public offering is successful. For 
example, a total of 332 IPOs raised about $50 billion in 1999, the height of the 
Internet bubble. When the bubble burst in early 2001, the IPO marketplace 
all but dried up, particularly for technology and telecom stocks. Since then, 
the market has recovered. There were 261 IPOs in 2013, which raised a total 
of $70.5 billion. The first half of 2014 saw 166 IPOs with a busy IPO calendar 
projected for the second half of the year.35 The vitality of the IPO market hinges 
largely on the state of the overall economy and the mood of professional inves-
tors. However, even when facing a strong economy and a positive mood toward 
investing, an entrepreneurial venture should guard itself against becoming 
caught up in the euphoria and rushing its IPO.
A variation of the IPO is a private placement, which is the direct sale of an 
issue of securities to a large institutional investor. When a private placement is 
initiated, there is no public offering, and no prospectus is prepared.
sources of Debt Financing
Debt financing involves getting a loan or selling corporate bonds. Because it is 
virtually impossible for a new venture to sell corporate bonds, we’ll focus on 
obtaining loans.
There are two common types of loans. The first is a single-purpose loan, 
in which a specific amount of money is borrowed that must be repaid in a fixed 
amount of time with interest. The second is a line of credit, in which a bor-
rowing “cap” is established and borrowers can use the credit at their discretion. 
Lines of credit require periodic interest payments.
There are two major advantages to obtaining a loan as opposed to equity 
funding. The first is that none of the ownership of the firm is surrendered—a 
major advantage for most entrepreneurs. The second is that interest payments 
on a loan are tax deductible, in contrast to dividend payments made to inves-
tors, which are not.
There are two major disadvantages of getting a loan. The first is that it must 
be repaid, which may be difficult in a start-up venture in which the entrepre-
neur is focused on getting the company off the ground. Cash is typically “tight” 
during a new venture’s first few months and sometimes for a year or more. The 
second is that lenders often impose strict conditions on loans and insist on am-
ple collateral to fully protect their investment. Even if a start-up is incorporated, 
a lender may require that an entrepreneur’s personal assets be collateralized as 
a condition of the loan. In addition, a lender may place a stipulation on a loan, 
such that the borrower must “maintain a cash balance of $25,000 or more” in 
its checking account or the loan will become due and payable.
The three common sources or categories of debt financing available to en-
trepreneurs are described next.
commercial Banks
Historically, commercial banks have not been viewed as practical sources of 
financing for start-up firms.36 This sentiment is not a knock against banks; it 
is just that banks are risk averse, and financing start-ups is risky business. 
Instead of looking for businesses that are “home runs,” which is what venture 
capitalists seek to do, banks look for customers who will reliably repay their 
loans. As shown in Table 10.2, banks are interested in firms that have a strong 
learning ObjeCtive

neurial firms use.

cash flow, low leverage, audited financials, good management, and a healthy 
balance sheet. Although many new ventures have good management, few have 
the other characteristics, at least initially. But banks are an important source 
of credit for small businesses later in their life cycles.
There are two reasons that banks have historically been reluctant to lend 
money to start-ups. First, as mentioned previously, banks are risk averse. In 
addition, banks frequently have internal controls and regulatory restrictions 
prohibiting them from making high-risk loans. So when an entrepreneur ap-
proaches a banker with a request for a $250,000 loan and the only collateral 
he or she has to offer is the recognition of a problem that needs to be solved, 
a plan to solve it, and perhaps some intellectual property, there is usually no 
practical way for the bank to help. Banks typically have standards that guide 
their lending, such as minimum debt-to-equity ratios that work against start-
up entrepreneurs.
The second reason banks have historically been reluctant to lend money to 
start-ups is that lending to small firms is not as profitable as lending to large 
firms, which have been the staple clients of commercial banks. If an entrepre-
neur approaches a banker with a request for a $25,000 loan, it may simply not 
be worth the banker’s time to complete the due diligence necessary to deter-
mine the entrepreneur’s risk profile. Considerable time is required to digest a 
business plan and investigate the merits of a new firm. Research shows that 
a firm’s size is an important factor in determining its access to debt capital.37 
The $25,000 loan may be seen as both high risk and marginally profitable 
(based on the amount of time it would take to do the due diligence involved), 
making it doubly uninviting for a commercial bank.38
Despite these historical precedents, some banks are starting to engage 
start-up entrepreneurs—although the jury is still out regarding how signifi-
cant these lenders will become. When it comes to start-ups, some banks are 
rethinking their lending standards and are beginning to focus on cash flow 
and the strength of the management team rather than on collateral and the 
strength of the balance sheet. Entrepreneurs should follow developments in 
this area closely.
sBA guaranteed loans
Approximately 50 percent of the 9,000 banks in the United States participate 
in the SBA Guaranteed Loan Program. The most notable SBA program 
available to small businesses is the 7(A) Loan Guaranty Program. This pro-
gram accounts for 90 percent of the SBA’s loan activity. The program operates 
through private-sector lenders who provide loans that are guaranteed by the 
SBA. The loans are for small businesses that are unable to secure financing 
on reasonable terms through normal lending channels. The SBA does not cur-
rently have funding for direct loans, other than a program to fund direct loans 
for businesses in geographic areas that are hit by natural disasters.
Almost all small businesses are eligible to apply for an SBA guaranteed 
loan. The SBA can guarantee as much as 75 percent (debt to equity) on loans 
up to $5 million. For loans of $150,000 or under, the guaranteed amount is 85 
percent. Guaranteed loan funds can be used for almost any legitimate busi-
ness purpose. The maximum lengths of the loans are seven years for working 
capital, 10 years for equipment (or useful life of equipment), and 25 years for 
real estate purchase. To obtain an SBA guaranteed loan, an application must 
meet the requirements of both the SBA and the lender. Typically, individuals 
must pledge all of their assets to secure the loan. Interest rates are negotiated 
between the borrower and the lender but are subject to SBA maximums.39
Although SBA guaranteed loans are utilized more heavily by existing small 
businesses than start-ups, they should not be dismissed as a possible source 
of funding. There is a general misconception that the SBA is a “lender of last 

ChAPTER 10 | gETTIng Financing OR FUnDIng    367
resort” and only distressed businesses qualify for SBA guaranteed loans. Just 
the opposite is true. Only viable businesses are eligible under the SBA 7(A) 
Loan Guaranty Program.40
other sources of Debt financing
There are a variety of other avenues business owners can pursue to borrow 
money or obtain cash. Vendor credit (also known as trade credit) is when a 
vendor extends credit to a business in order to allow the business to buy its 
products and/or services up front but defer payment until later. The practice is 
especially common in retail, but it can be seen in other businesses as well. An 
example of vendor credit is when a retailer orders product from a vendor that 
ships it on net 30 terms. This means that the retailer has 30 days to submit 
payment for the product. The idea is that the retailer doesn’t have money to 
pay for the product until it sells it, so the vendor agrees to wait on payment to 
give the retailer enough time to sell the product and collect the money needed 
to pay the bill. Some retailers will negotiate up to net 90 terms, meaning that 
they have 90 days to make payment. Although not really debt financing, fac-
toring is another way that businesses generate cash. Factoring is a financial 
transaction whereby a business sells its account receivable to a third party, 
called a factor, at a discount in exchange for cash.41
There are also alternative lenders who loan money to small businesses and 
entrepreneurs. These are primarily online firms that offer loans at an esca-
lated interest rate. A common type of alternative lending is the merchant cash 
 advance. In a merchant cash advance, the lender provides a business a lump 
sum of money in exchange for a share of future sales (typically a set percentage 
of the business’s daily credit card sales) that covers the payment amount plus 
fees. The deals are normally designed for borrowers looking for short-term loans 
of less than $100,000. The average time for repayment is eight to nine months.42
Another type of alternative lending is peer-to-peer loans. Peer-to-peer lend-
ing is a financial transaction that occurs directly between individuals or “peers.” 
The loans are facilitated by online firms such as Funding Circle, Lending Club, 
and Dealstruck. The online firms connect businesses with individuals or insti-
tutional investors who make the loans. In some cases, such as with Dealstruck, 
the site itself has money to lend. Borrowers generally must make fixed monthly 
payments. The thing to watch out for when using alternative lenders is the an-
nual percentage rate (APR), which can run as high as 12 percent to 25 percent.43
Creative sources of Financing and Funding
Because financing and funding are difficult to obtain, particularly for start-
ups, entrepreneurs often use creative ways to obtain financial resources. Even 
for firms that have financing or funding available, it is prudent to search for 
sources of capital that are less expensive than traditional ones. The following 
sections discuss four of the more common creative sources of financing and 
funding for entrepreneurial firms.
crowdfunding
A popular creative source of funding for new businesses is crowdfunding. 
Crowdfunding is the practice of funding a project or new venture by raising 
monetary contributions from a large number of people, typically via the Internet.
There are two types of crowdfunding sites: rewards-based crowdfunding 
and equity-based crowdfunding. Rewards-based crowdfunding allows entre-
preneurs to raise money in exchange for some type of amenity or reward. The 
most popular rewards-based crowdfunding sites are Kickstarter, Indiegogo, 
learning ObjeCtive
 7. Describe several creative 
sources of financing en-
trepreneurial firms may 
choose to use.

368    PART 3 | MOvIng FROM An IDEA TO An EnTREPREnEURIAL FIRM
and RocketHub. These sites allow entrepreneurs to create a profile, list their 
fund-raising goals, and provide an explanation (typically via video) of how the 
funds will be used. Individuals then pledge money in exchange for some type of 
amenity, like being one of the first 100 people to obtain the company’s  product. 
The site takes a small percentage of the funds raised by the individuals for 
their service. Once a novelty, rewards-based crowdfunding has become a  major 
source of start-up funds. Two of the student start-ups profiled in this book, 
LuminAid (Chapter 3) and Roominate (in this chapter), raised money via crowd-
funding. In 2014, COOLEST, the subject of the You Be the VC 11.2 feature, 
raised $13.2 million from 62,642 donors on Kickstarter, which at the time was 
the all-time crowdfunding record. There are currently over 450 crowdfunding 
platforms. Some, such as Kickstarter, help fund a wide range of creative  projects 
and business start-ups. Others are narrow in scope. If you’re not familiar with 
how crowdfunding works, go to www.kickstarter.com and type “COOLEST 
Cooler” into the search engine. Although the campaign is over, Kickstarter 
leaves the campaign profiles up on its site indefinitely. Looking at COOLEST’s 
 campaign will provide you a good sense of how rewards-based crowdfunding 
campaigns work.
The second type of crowdfunding is equity-based crowdfunding. Equity-
based crowdfunding helps businesses raise money by tapping individuals 
who provide funding in exchange for equity in the business. Three of the more 
popular equity-based crowdfunding sites are FundersClub, Crowdfunder.com, 
and Circle Up. The catalyst for the advent of equity-based crowdfunding was 
the JOBS Act, which was passed in April of 2012. The act is still going into 
effect, so the full set of rules and regulations that will govern equity-based 
crowdfunding sites are unknown. As of the time this chapter was written 
(September 2014), it appears that equity-based crowdfunding will be confined 
to entrepreneurs raising money from accredited investors. An accredited in-
vestor is a person who is permitted to invest in higher-risk investments such 
as business start-ups. In the United States, a person must have a net worth of 
at least $1 million (not including the value of their house) or have an income of 
at least $200,000 each year for the past two years (or $300,000 together with 
their spouse if married) and have the expectation to make the same amount in 
the current year. Still, there is substantial enthusiasm surrounding the poten-
tial for equity-based crowdfunding in the future.
leasing
A lease is a written agreement in which the owner of a piece of property  allows 
an individual or business to use the property for a specified period of time 
in exchange for payments. The major advantage of leasing is that it enables 
a company to acquire the use of assets with very little or no down payment. 
Leases for facilities and leases for equipment are the two most common types 
of leases that entrepreneurial ventures undertake.44 For example, many new 
businesses lease computers from Dell Inc. or other PC manufacturers. The 
advantage for the new business is that it can gain access to the computers it 
needs with very little money invested up-front.
There are many different players in the leasing business. Some vendors, 
such as Dell, lease directly to businesses. As with banks, the vendors look for 
lease clients with good credit backgrounds and the ability to make the lease 
payments. There are also venture-leasing firms that act as brokers, bring-
ing the parties involved in a lease together. These firms are acquainted with 
the producers of specialized equipment and match these producers with new 
ventures that are in need of the equipment. One of the responsibilities of these 
firms is conducting due diligence to make sure that the new ventures involved 
will be able to keep up with their lease payments.

ChAPTER 10 | gETTIng Financing OR FUnDIng    369
Most leases involve a modest down payment and monthly payments during 
the duration of the lease. At the end of an equipment lease, the new venture 
typically has the option to stop using the equipment, purchase it at fair mar-
ket value, or renew the lease. Lease deals that involve a substantial amount 
of money should be negotiated and entered into with the same amount of 
scrutiny as when getting financing or funding. Leasing is almost always more 
expensive than paying cash for an item, so most entrepreneurs think of leas-
ing as an alternative to equity or debt financing. Although the down payment 
is typically lower, the primary disadvantage is that at the end of the lease, the 
lessee doesn’t own the property or equipment.45 Of course, this may be an 
advantage if a company is leasing equipment, such as computers or copy ma-
chines, which can rather quickly become technologically obsolete.
sBir and sttr grant programs
The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and the Small Business 
Technology Transfer (STTR) programs are two important sources of early-stage 
funding for technology firms. These programs provide cash grants to entre-
preneurs who are working on projects in specific areas. The main difference 
between the SBIR and the STTR programs is that the STTR program requires 
the participation of researchers working at universities or other research in-
stitutions. For the purpose of the program, the term small business is defined 
as an American-owned for-profit business with fewer than 500 employees. The 
principle researcher must also be employed by the business.46
The SBIR Program is a competitive grant program that provides over 
$2.5 billion per year to small businesses for early-stage and development proj-
ects. Each year, 11 federal departments and agencies are required by the SBIR 
to reserve a portion of their research and development funds for awards to 
small businesses. Table 10.5 shows the agencies that participate, along with 
the types of areas that are funded. Guidelines for how to apply for the grants 
are provided on each agency’s website, along with a description of the types of 
projects the agencies are interested in supporting. The SBIR is a three-phase 
program, meaning that firms that qualify have the potential to receive more 
than one grant to fund a particular proposal. These three phases, along with 
the amount of funding available for each phase, are as follows:
■ Phase I is a six-month feasibility study in which the business must 
 demonstrate the technical feasibility of the proposed innovation. Funding 
available for Phase I research is for up to $150,000.
■ Phase II awards for up to $1 million are granted for as long as two years to 
successful Phase I companies. The purpose of a Phase II grant is to develop 
and test a prototype of Phase I innovations.
■ Phase III is the period during which Phase II innovations move from the 
research and development lab to the marketplace. No SBIR funds are in-
volved. At this point, the business must find private funding or financing 
to commercialize the product or service. In some cases, such as with the 
Department of Defense, the government may be the primary customer for 
the product.
Historically, less than 15 percent of all Phase I proposals are funded, and 
about 30 percent of all Phase II proposals are funded. The payoff for successful 
proposals, however, is high. The money is essentially free. It is a grant, mean-
ing that it doesn’t have to be paid back and no equity in the firm is at stake. 
The recipient of the grant also retains the rights to the intellectual property de-
veloped while working with the support provided by the grant. The real payoff 
is in Phase III if the new venture can commercialize the research results.

370    PART 3 | MOvIng FROM An IDEA TO An EnTREPREnEURIAL FIRM
The STTR Program is a variation of the SBIR for collaborative research 
projects that involve small businesses and research organizations, such as 
universities or federal laboratories. In 2010, over $100 million in grants were 
awarded through the program. More information about the SBIR and STTR 
programs can be obtained at www.sbir.gov.
other grant programs
There are a limited number of other grant programs available to entrepreneurs. 
Obtaining a grant takes a little detective work. Granting agencies are, by nature, 
low-key, so they normally need to be sought out. A typical scenario of a small 
business that received a grant is provided by Rozalia Williams, the founder 
of Hidden Curriculum Education, a for-profit company that offers college life 
skills courses. To kick-start her business, Williams received a $72,500 grant 
from Miami-Dade Empowerment Trust, a granting agency in Dade County, 
Florida. The purpose of the Miami-Dade Empowerment Trust is to encourage 
the creation of businesses in disadvantaged neighborhoods of Dade County. 
The key to Williams’s success, which is true in most grant-awarding situations, 
is that her business fit nicely with the mission of the granting organization, 
and she was willing to take her business into the areas the granting agency 
was committed to improving. After being awarded the grant and conducting 
her college prep courses in four Dade County neighborhoods over a three-year 
period, Williams received an additional $100,000 loan from the Miami-Dade 
Empowerment Trust to expand her business.47 There are also private founda-
tions that grant money to both existing and start-up firms. These grants are 
usually tied to specific objectives or a specific project, such as research and 
development in a specific area.
The federal government has grant programs beyond the SBIR and STTR 
programs described previously. The full spectrum of grants available is listed 
at www.grants.gov. State and local governments, private foundations, and 
philanthropic organizations also post grant announcements on their websites. 
Finding a grant that fits your business is the key. This is no small task. It is 
worth the effort, however, if you can obtain some or all of your start-up costs 
through a granting agency.

L
arge firms and smaller entrepreneurial firms play dif-
ferent roles in business and society and can often 
produce the best results by partnering with each 
other rather than acting as adversaries. The pharmaceuti-
cal industry is an excellent example of how this works.
It is well known that barriers to entry in the pharma-
ceutical industry are high. The average new product takes 
between 10 and 15 years from discovery to commercial 
sale. The process of discovering, testing, obtaining ap-
proval, manufacturing, and marketing a new drug is long 
and expensive. how, then, do biotech start-ups make it? 
The answer is that few biotech firms actually take their 
products to market. here’s how it works.
Biotech firms specialize in discovering and patenting 
new drugs—it’s what they’re good at. In most cases, 
however, they have neither the money nor the know-
how to bring the products to market. In contrast, the 
large drug companies, such as Johnson & Johnson, 
Pfizer, and Merck, specialize in developing and market-
ing drugs and providing information to doctors about 
them. It’s what they are good at. But these companies 
typically don’t have the depth of scientific talent and 
the entrepreneurial zeal that the small biotech firms do. 
These two types of firms need one another to be as suc-
cessful as possible. Often, but not always, what hap-
pens is this. The biotech firms discover and patent new 
drugs, and the larger drug companies develop them 
and bring them to market. Biotech firms earn money 
through this arrangement by licensing or selling their 
patent-protected discoveries to the larger companies or 
by partnering with them in some revenue-sharing way. 
The large drug companies make money by selling the 
products to consumers.
The most compelling partnership arrangements are 
those that help entrepreneurial firms focus on what they 
do best, which is typically innovation, and that allow them 
to tap into their partners’ complementary strengths and 
resources.
Questions for Critical Thinking
 1. In your opinion, what factors in the business environ-
ment encourage firms to partner to compete?
 2. What risks do small firms face when partnering with 
large, successful companies? What risks do large 
companies take when they rely on small firms as a 
source of innovation?
 3. how might government policies affect partnering actions 
between small and large firms in the pharmaceutical 
industry?
 4. If you worked for an entrepreneurial venture, what 
would you want to know about a large company before 
recommending that your firm form a partnership with 
that large, established company?

Pharmaceutical Products to Market
One thing to be careful of is grant-related scams. Business owners often re-
ceive unsolicited letters or e-mail messages from individuals or organizations that 
assure them that for a fee they can help the business gain access to hundreds 
of business-related grants. The reality is that there aren’t hundreds of business-
related grants that fit any one business. Most of these types of offers are a scam.
strategic partners
Strategic partners are another source of capital for new ventures.48 Indeed, 
strategic partners often play a critical role in helping young firms fund their 
operations and round out their business models.
Biotechnology companies, for example, rely heavily on partners for finan-
cial support, as illustrated in this chapter’s “Savvy Entrepreneurial Firm” 
boxed feature. As mentioned in the feature, a small biotech firm would rarely 
have access to sufficient financial capital and other resources to take a new 
discovery from the lab all the way to market. It just takes too much time, 
capital, and other resources to pull off. As a result, they rely on deep-pocketed 
strategic partners to perform parts of the process. Many strategic partnerships 
are also formed to gain access to a particular resource or to facilitate speed 
to market.49 In exchange for access to plant and equipment and established 
distribution channels, new ventures bring an entrepreneurial spirit and new 
ideas to these partnerships. These types of arrangements can help new ven-
tures lessen the need for financing or funding.

ness, establishing partnerships and shar-
ing expenses with partners, and sharing 
office space and/or employees with other 
businesses.
 lO4. The three steps involved in properly pre-
paring to raise debt or equity financing 
are as follows: Determine precisely how 
much money is needed, determine the 
type of financing or funding that is most 
appropriate, and develop a strategy for 
engaging potential investors or bankers. 
Cash flow statements are helpful to efforts 
to determine the amount of capital a firm 
requires at a point in time. When deciding 
how to finance their venture, entrepre-
neurs commonly choose between equity 
financing (where partial ownership of the 
firm is exchanged for financial support) 
and debt financing (where the entrepre-
neurs gain access to capital by taking out 
a loan). Entrepreneurs then develop an 
elevator pitch (which is a brief, carefully 
constructed statement outlining a busi-
ness opportunity’s merits), identify the 
best prospects to contact to seek financ-
ing, and prepare themselves to present a 
potential investor with an effectively devel-
oped business plan.
 lO5. Business angels, venture capital, and an 
initial public offering (IPO) are the three 
most important sources of equity fund-
ing available to entrepreneurs. Business 
angels are individuals who invest their 
personal capital directly in start-up ven-
tures. These investors tend to be high-
net-worth individuals who generally invest 
between $10,000 and $500.000 in a single 
company. Venture capital is money that is 
invested by venture capital firms in start-
ups and small businesses with excep-
tional growth potential. Typically, venture 
capitalists invest at least $1 million in a 
single company. An initial public offering 
(IPO) is an important milestone for a firm 
for four reasons: It is a way to raise equity 
capital, it raises a firm’s public profile, it 
is a liquidity event, and it creates another 
form of currency (company stock) that can 
be used to grow the company.
 lO6. The sources of debt available to entre-
preneurs include commercial banks, SBA 
 lO1. Commonly, entrepreneurs discover that 
trying to operate their business without 
borrowed funds or invested capital is diffi-
cult. Because of this, entrepreneurs need to 
understand the different approaches avail-
able to them to gain access to the amount 
of capital needed to successfully support 
their ventures in the pursuit of organiza-
tional success.
 lO2. For three reasons—cash flow challenges, 
capital investment needs, and the reality 
of lengthy product development cycles—
most new firms need to raise money at 
some point during the early part of their 
life. Firm growth can generate cash flow 
problems, typically because of the lag 
between the need to spend capital to 
generate additional revenue and the time 
required to earn positive returns from 
those investments. Founders of entrepre-
neurial ventures may be able to fund their 
firm’s initial capital investment needs. 
But, larger investments are required to 
support firm growth that is the foundation 
for long-term success. In some instances, 
the time required for a product to be intro-
duced can be lengthy. When this happens, 
additional investments are necessary to 
keep a firm going during what may be a 
lengthy product development cycle.
 lO3. Personal funds, friends and family, and 
bootstrapping are the three sources of 
personal financing available to entrepre-
neurs. It is very common for entrepre-
neurs to use their own funds to invest in 
their ventures while simultaneously pro-
viding their “sweat equity” (or hard work) 
to keep the firm going. Entrepreneurs also 
receive support through funds provided by 
members of their family and their friends. 
These investments come in various forms, 
including loans and gifts. When bootstrap-
ping, entrepreneurs find ways to avoid the 
need for external funding. Exercising their 
creativity and ingenuity and finding ways 
to reduce their firm’s costs are examples 
of what entrepreneurs do to reduce the 
need for support provided through exter-
nal funding. Indeed, entrepreneurs are 
often very creative in finding ways to 
bootstrap to raise money or cut costs. 
Additional examples of bootstrapping in-
clude minimizing personal expenses and

guaranteed loans, and other sources such 
as vendor credit, factoring, peer-to-peer 
lending, and crowdfunding. Historically, 
commercial banks have been reluctant to 
loan funds to entrepreneurial ventures, 
largely because they are risk averse and 
because lending to smaller firms is less 
profitable for them compared to lend-
ing to large, established organizations. 
The main SBA program available to small 
businesses is referred to as the 7(A) Loan 
Guaranty Program. This program operates 
through private-sector lenders providing 
loans that are guaranteed by the SBA. 
The loans are for small businesses that 
are unable to secure financing on reason-
able terms through normal lending chan-
nels. A relatively new source of funding is 
when entrepreneurs raise money through 
crowdfunding by generating contributions 
from a large number of individuals. 
Commonly, the Internet is used to gener-
ate funds in this manner.
 lO7. Leasing and SBIR and STTR grant pro-
grams, along with other types of grant 
programs, are examples of creative op-
portunities entrepreneurs can pursue to 
obtain financial resources. A lease is a 
written agreement in which the owner of 
a piece of property allows an individual 
or business to use the property for a 
specified period of time in exchange for 
payments. The major advantage of leas-
ing is that it enables a company to ac-
quire the use of assets with very little or 
no down payment. The SBIR and STTR 
grant programs are important sources of 
early-stage funding for technology-based 
ventures.

376    PART 3 | MOvIng FROM An IDEA TO An EnTREPREnEURIAL FIRM
Business idea: Design a caregiver marketplace that 
allows families in need of a caregiver and professional 
caregivers to connect online.
pitch: The traditional way families in need of a caregiver 
have arranged for care is to enlist the services of a brick 
and mortar agency. The problem with this approach is 
that it is expensive and the pool of available caregivers is 
limited to the people that work for the agency. CareLinx’s 
approach is different. It has created an online platform 
that makes it easy for families in need of caregivers to find 
professional caregivers online. via the CareLinx platform, 
a family is able to find, video interview, read background 
checks, hire, manage, and pay professional caregivers 
that match their specific needs and budgetary constraints.
The idea for CareLinx emerged from a personal experi-
ence of its founder, Sherwin Sheik. Sheik and his family 
experienced firsthand the challenges involved with find-
ing and managing professional caregivers for a sister 
who has multiple sclerosis and an uncle with ALS. They 
were referred to several local agencies and found the 
process to be inefficient and costly. To complicate mat-
ters, Sheik’s mother lived in San Francisco, while the sis-
ter that needed help lived in Los Angeles. The distance 
between the two required Sheik’s mother to constantly 
fly back and forth to coordinate care. There was really no 
good way for Sheik and his family to manage the care for 
his sister and uncle efficiently.
CareLinx takes the inefficiency out of the process. A 
caregiver can be located and interviewed online. All 
caregivers on the site are prescreened and extensive 
background checks are provided. CareLinx takes care of 
the insurance, paperwork, and taxes. Due to the impor-
tance of finding the ideal caregiver for an individual who 
needs care, CareLinx isn’t just a website. Once a family 
goes to the company’s website and completes the initial 
survey, they are contacted by a CareLinx team member, 
who walks them through the process. Caregivers set 
their own hourly rate, and salary is negotiated between 
the caregiver and the family with the need. CareLinx 
charges the family with the need a 15 percent service fee 
for the duration of the caregiving relationship. The pro-
cess typically saves families thousands of dollars, whose 
alternative is to enlist the services of a traditional bricks-
and-mortar caregiving agency.
From the caregiver’s point of view, CareLinx provides 
them an easy way to find clients in their area who need 
home health care. It also offers flexibility. Caregivers can 
select clients of their choice, set their hourly pay, and 
choose clients that fit with their schedules. Caregivers 
being paid through CareLinx earn up to 25 percent to 30 
percent more than those working through a traditional 
agency.
In short, CareLinx is a win-win for both the caregiver and 
the family in need. CareLinx’s goal is to disrupt the $100 
billion-plus home care service delivery industry.

Business idea: Provide musicians an online direct-to-fan 
platform to reach out to their fan base to pre-sell, market, 
and distribute music projects including recordings, music 
videos, and concerts.
pitch: Musicians often have creative ideas for recordings, 
music videos, or similar projects but can’t raise the 
money to move forward. When their fans hear that 
they’ve passed on an album or a creative new approach 
to offering their music, they often react by saying or 
thinking to themselves, “Man—I wish there had been a 
way that I could have helped.”
now there is. PledgeMusic is a direct-to-fan music plat-
form that bears similarities to crowdfunding sites like 
Kickstarter and Indiegogo. It is focused solely on raising 
funds for musicians. It allows two distinct types of fund-
raising campaigns. The first is direct-to-fan campaigns, 
which are managed like Kickstarter campaigns. The art-
ist sets a target amount to raise (to fund a new album, 
music video, or similar creative project) and provides 
amenities in exchange for pledges. Contributors are not 
charged until the target amount is reached. The second 
type of campaign is a preorder campaign. Contributors 
are charged immediately to preorder an album or music 
video, much like many online music sites. The artist is 
paid upon project completion. Approximately 90 percent 
of direct-to-fan campaigns are successful, with most art-
ists raising approximately 140 percent of their goal.

For its part, PledgeMusic does not take any owner-
ship interest in the projects that are funded through its 
website, charging a flat 15 percent fee on all money 
collected.
 10-32. Based on the material covered in this chapter, what 
questions would you ask the firm’s founders before 
making your funding decision? What answers would 
satisfy you?
 10-33. If you had to make your decision on just the informa-
tion provided in the pitch and on the company’s web-
site, would you fund this company? Why or why not?
Each direct-to-fan campaign is accompanied by a video 
pitch from the artist, which explains the project he or 
she has in mind. PledgeMusic encourages artists to of-
fer a wide range of amenities and exclusive content to 
contributors in exchange for their contribution. It also 
encourages artists to include contributions to char-
ity as part of their fund-raising project. An example of 
a PledgeMusic campaign is a campaign launched by 
Bobby Long that was ongoing when this feature was 
written. Long is an indie folk singer-songwriter who orga-
nized the campaign to fund the production of his third al-
bum. his two-minute video appeal was personal and au-
thentic. In the appeal, he explains that he’ll be producing 
his third album independently and he needs funding for 
production costs. The album will be produced in Austin, 
Texas. Long ends the video by promising contributors 
that they’ll be proud of the finished product. A sample 
of the amenities Long will provide contributors include 
the following: $10—digital version of the new album; 
introduction
One evening in October 2010, Kent Frankovich was 
riding his bike home from work. he was finishing up 
a research project at Stanford and was running back 
and forth to the lab a lot at night. The area in front of 
him was partially illuminated by his handle-mounted 
bike light. he entered a particularly dark stretch and 
hit a pothole. It nearly threw him off his bike. It got him 
thinking that there must be a better way to illuminate 
the path in front of his bike.
he decided against buying a better handle-
mounted light. Why is the light up so high, he thought, if 
what he’s trying to illuminate is directly in front of him? 
So he decided to do some research. he looked at the 
lights on cars and the design work that went into them. 
Many new cars had wraparound lights so the car could 
be seen from the side as well as the front. In addition, 
unlike bikes, car headlights are at the front and are fairly 
low so they can best illuminate the road. Frankovich 
decided that bike lights should be put where they’re 
needed the most—at the wheel.
This conclusion posed a design challenge. 
Obviously the wheels on a bike rotate, so a light can’t 
be mounted on the wheel. After giving the matter 
some thought, Frankovich came up with a solution. he 
distributed small LED lights all the way around the wheel 
and timed them so they’d only illuminate when facing 
forward. Thus, only about a third of the wheel would be 
illuminated at any given time—the third lighting the path 
in front of the bike. The whole wheel couldn’t be illumi-
nated because the spinning light would interfere with the 
rider’s eyesight.
Frankovich built a prototype and started riding at 
night. he found that the arch of light not only lit the 
path in front of him, but made him hugely visible from 
all sides. That’s a big deal. In some archival research 
Frankovich had done, he found some interesting sta-
tistics about bikes. About one third of Americans own 
bikes, but only 1 percent of trips are made by bike. The 
top four reasons that people don’t ride their bikes more 
often are (1) car traffic, (2) weather, (3) lack of bike lanes, 
and (4) darkness. The thing these four reasons have in 
common is personal safety. Frankovich realized that not 
only could his solution provide for a better bike light, but 
it could help people feel safer riding their bike because 
they would be more visible. According to government 
surveys, about 70 percent of bike traffic accidents are 
attributed to a lack of side visibility. In addition, the ma-
jority of bike accidents happen between 4:00 p.m. and 
4:00 a.m.—which is late afternoon to dusk to darkness.

378    PART 3 | MOvIng FROM An IDEA TO An EnTREPREnEURIAL FIRM
Frankovich used this insight to improve on the ini-
tial prototype. To provide for more side visibility at night, 
he decided to not only mount lights on the front tire but 
on the back tire as well. To make it not only functional 
but super cool, the design was for white lights on the 
front tire and red lights on the back. The result was 
360 degrees of illumination, offering not only improved 
lighting (for the person riding the bike) but improved 
visibility from all sides.
next steps
After settling on the initial design, Frankovich met Adam 
Pettler at a friend’s get-together. Pettler was complet-
ing an MBA from the University of California, Davis. 
According to an interview with Frankovich and Pettler 
on the Core77 website (Core77 is a site for industrial 
designers), Frankovich told Pettler about his idea, and 
pulled out his phone and played a video of the proto-
type. “Dude,” Pettler reportedly said, “We should start a 
business.” Coincidentally, Pettler had to write a business 
plan for a class and was looking for an idea. The two hit 
it off and formed a partnership.
Over the next several months, Frankovich and 
Pettler produced several iterations of the original idea. 
They formed a company named Revolights. At this 
point, the Revolights bike lighting system consisted of 
two narrow rings of LED lights that mounted directly 
to each bike wheel using a series of rim-specific clips. 
They started showing videos of their most recent proto-
type to bike shop owners. The response was very posi-
tive. They felt that they were on to something but still 
couldn’t be absolutely sure that such was the case.
To test the waters in a substantive fashion, they de-
cided to launch a Kickstarter campaign. The campaign 
launched in mid-2011 with a $43,500 goal. The money 
would be spent on the final design and development work 
for the Revolights system and on the first production run. 
At this juncture, put the case aside for a moment and 
go to Kickstarter.com. Type “Revolights” into the search 
bar, and select the Revolights campaign that was funded 
on September 27, 2011 (Revolights ran two subsequent 
Kickstarter campaigns). Watch the 2-minute, 50-second 
video pitch. You’ll see Revolights’s original pitch. The 
video also provides a nice demonstration of the Revolights 
system. The Kickstarter campaign raised $215,621 from 
1,442 backers (496 percent of the original goal). That suc-
cess provided Frankovich and Pettler the confidence to 
proceed with Revolights and make it an all-out effort.
funding Journey
Frankovich and Pettler proceeded to build Revolights. 
Because the Revolights system is a physical product, in-
ventory must be bought and paid for before the product 
is sold. As a result, scaling the company has required 
Frankovich and Pettler to raise money. The nearby table 
shows the funding that has taken place.

As mentioned, the first funding was the initial 
Kickstarter campaign. Buoyed by a positive response, 
Frankovich and Pettler decided to expand the pro-
duction run and took out a $250,000 SBA loan. In 
early 2013, they ran a second Kickstarter campaign. 
The $14,500 goal was easily met, in that they raised 
$94,793 from 233 backers. The differences in the vid-
eos that accompanied the 2011 and 2013 Kickstarter 
campaigns showed how much the company had ma-
tured. The purpose of the 2013 campaign was to fund 
the company’s second-generation product, Revolights 
City. Revolights City fit more bike rims and would 
make Revolights more widely accessible. The com-
pany also announced a partnership with Mission Bike 
Company, which would start selling a family of bikes 
with Revolights lights built in.
The next round of funding was a bold one. 
Frankovich decided to take his chances on Shark Tank. 
The advantages of appearing on Shark Tank are three-
fold: first, the possibility of raising money; second, the 
potential to get an investment from a high-profile inves-
tor, such as Mark Cuban, Barbara Corcoran, or Robert 
herjavec; third, the exposure an appearance brings. In 
2013, each episode averaged over six million viewers. 
Appearing on Shark Tank also exposes a product’s com-
pany, like Revolights, to potential retailers, distributors, 
and business partners.
The Shark Tank episode was filmed in late 2013 
and aired on March 7, 2014 (Season 5, Episode 19). A 
transcript of the episode is available at http://revolights.

in exchange for 10 percent of the company. The sharks

were impressed with the product and upped the ante. 
Frankovich received three offers. he eventually said yes 
to Robert herjavec’s offer of $300,000 for a 10 percent 
stake in Revolights.
Frankovich and Pettler had one hiccup in their 
funding journey. They tried to couple the Shark Tank 
 appearance with a third Kickstarter campaign. The goal 
was $100,000. A total of $78,017 was pledged and the 
campaign failed.
Most recently, Revolights raised a $1 million  series 
A round, which was led by Sierra Angles. Robert 
herjavec’s $300,000 commitment was folded into 
the round. The money will be used for expanding the 
Revolights team, growing sales and marketing, and 
 expanding the product line.
road Ahead
Like all start-ups, Revolights’s road ahead is unclear. All 
signs are positive; however, the angel round will force 
Revolights into a more rapid growth mode. In the Shark 
Tank episode, Frankovich indicated that at that time, 
Revolights had earned $600,000 in sales. he indicated 
that profits were being reinvested in the company.
As of the time this case was written (September 
2014), Revolights’s products were for sale in bike shops 
in 12 states, as well as in Mexico, Thailand, and the 
United Kingdom. The product was also available via 
Amazon.com. The key for Revolights will be to win 
wider acceptance of its product. Price is a challenge. 
The flagship version of Revolights, which are the arcs 
of LED lights that clip onto bike wheels, sell for $199 
a set. Revolights now sells a product called Revolight 
Wheels, which are bike wheels with the Revolight lights 
permanently installed. The wheels sell for $399 a set. It’s 
unclear whether at those price points Revolights’s prod-
ucts will become mainstream.
Revolights continues to generate publicity. In 
2013, it was a James Dyson Award International 
Finalist. It also won a Core77 Design Award. In 
2013, Frankovich did a TEDx Sacramento talk about 
Revolights. The talk has generated over 33,000 views.

introduction
Kickstarter is a crowdfunding platform. The idea be-
hind crowdfunding is to raise money from the public 
(i.e., the crowd) rather than through traditional means. 
Kickstarter’s stated mission is to bring creative proj-
ects to life. The platform was started in April 2009 by 
Perry Chen, Charles Adler, and Yancy Strickler. Since 
then, it has reportedly helped raise over $1 billion in 
pledges from five million donors to fund 60,000 proj-
ects. Kickstarter is open to projects based in the United 
States, Canada, Australia, new Zealand, and the United 
Kingdom. Backers can come from anywhere in the 
world. While most people think of Kickstarter as a web-
site, it launched a mobile app in February 2013.
how it Works
Kickstarter funds creative projects. Anyone that meets 
the company’s creator requirements is eligible to 
launch a project on Kickstarter. A project must fit into 
one of Kickstarter’s 13 categories and 36 subcatego-
ries. The 13 categories include Art, Comics, Dance, 
Design, Fashion, Film and video, Food, games, Music, 
Photography, Publishing, Technology, and Theater. 
Business start-ups are eligible if they fit a category. For 
example, a company that’s creating a new type and 
style of denim jeans would fit into the fashion category. 
Of the categories, Film and video and Music are the 
largest and have raised the most amount of money.
Once accepted, a person uses tools provided by 
Kickstarter to set up a fund-raising campaign. The cam-
paign, which is displayed on Kickstarter.com and can 
be accessed via the mobile app, includes a description 
of the project, a video pitch (not required but recom-
mended), the fund-raising goal, the deadline, and a list of 
the incentives that are provided in exchange for pledges. 
If the minimum isn’t reached by the deadline, pledgers 
get their money back. Pledges are tiered ($25, $50, $75, 
etc.), with each tier earning a certain incentive. Some 
incentives are merely thank you acknowledgments. For 
example, a $25 pledge may earn a thank you note from 
the person running the campaign. In contrast, some 
pledges result in nice rewards. For example, COOLEST 
Cooler ran the most successful Kickstarter campaign

to date by raising $13.3 million from 62,642 pledgers. A 
$165 pledge earned the pledger one of the coolers the 
campaign was designed to help manufacture. The cool-
ers are expected to eventually sell for around $300.
Kickstarter has taken several steps to govern the 
integrity of its campaigns. Money pledged by donors 
is collected using Amazon Payments. Kickstarter 
claims no ownership over the projects and the work 
they produce. It makes money by retaining 5 percent 
of the funds raised. An additional 3 percent to 5 per-
cent goes to Amazon Payments. Kickstarter has added 
requirements for hardware and product design projects, 
with the most stringent being that a physical prototype 
of the product must exist and a manufacturing plan 
must be in place. These requirements help ensure that 
the device will actually be built and the promised incen-
tives will be delivered to pledgers.
The five most successful Kickstarter projects to 
date are shown in the table below. You can look at each 
of the projects by going to Kickstarter’s website and 
typing the project name in the search box. Kickstarter 
archives all projects indefinitely.
$15,000. With 22 days left in the campaign, $183,668 
had been pledged. The Memobottle is designed and 
ready for tooling and production. The purpose of the 
campaign was to raise the necessary funds for tool-
ing, the first manufacturing and production run, and 
distribution. The $15,000 figure came from an analysis 
of the minimum amount of money needed to bring 
Memobottle to life. To encourage people to participate 
in its Kickstarter campaign, Memobottle offered tiered 
incentives. A sample of the incentives, along with the 
pledge amount required to earn the incentive, are 
shown in the table below.
Along with financial support, the initiators of 
Kickstarter campaigns get feedback from the Kickstarter 
community in the form of “Comments.” Memobottle had 
120 comments with 22 days to go. The comments often 
contain thoughtful insights about the product that are 
helpful to the initiators.
typical kickstarter project
here’s a typical Kickstarter campaign. Memobottle is 
a company started in 2014 by Jesse Leeworthy and 
Jonathan Byrt. The idea is to create a series of bottles 
that resemble the shape of a piece of paper and that 
conveniently slide into a messenger bag or briefcase 
alongside a laptop, books, and other valuables. The 
bottles are filled with tap water and are reusable. A bo-
nus is reducing the number of single-use water bottles 
that are used and then discarded. In the United States 
alone, 1,500 plastic bottles are used and discarded 
every second. This has a damaging effect on both the 
environment and our bank accounts. Bottled water is 
1,400 times more expensive than tap water.
The Memobottle will be produced in three sizes. 
The bottles are transparent, leak proof, and dishwasher 
friendly. The Kickstarter campaign, which was going 
on when this feature was being written, had a goal of

long, people lose interest. Fourth, it’s important to not 
set your financial goal too low. If a Kickstarter cam-
paign is successful, it tends to quickly lose momentum 
once it reaches 100 percent of its goal—even though 
more money can be collected. Finally, it’s imperative 
that a video pitch be included. It’s much easier to do-
nate money to a person or organization’s project if you 
can hear someone talking about it and see the passion 
in their eyes.
What’s Ahead?
Kickstarter has no immediate plans to broaden the 
scope of its platform. It does have a growing number 
of competitors. There are now over 450 crowdfunding 
platforms. Some, such as Indiegogo and Rockhub, are 
broad-based platforms like Kickstarter. Others focus on 
specific industries, such as PledgeMusic, which helps 
musicians raise money for albums, concerts, and music 
DvDs. There are areas in which Kickstarter is becoming 
more adventurous. For example, it periodically hosts film 
festivals that feature animations, short films, documen-
taries, and more, all funded on Kickstarter. In 2014, a 
Kickstarter film festival was held in Brooklyn in July and 
Los Angeles in September, and one was in the planning 
stages for London in the later part of the year.
The Memobottle campaign includes a 3-minute, 
16-second video that shows exactly how the Memobottle 
conveniently slides into a messenger bag and that drives 
home the negative environmental impact of single-use 
water bottles.
how to run a successful kickstarter campaign
There are several things that people who have run suc-
cessful Kickstarter campaigns learn. First, Kickstarter 
shouldn’t be thought of as a tool for funding one-off 
projects or events. Instead, it’s best to think of it as a 
mechanism for providing seed capital to help a project 
or event get up and running, and then grow it from there. 
Second, it’s important that the person or organization 
that initiates a Kickstarter campaign promote it. Most 
people who contribute to a specific campaign don’t find 
it by chance. Instead, they go to Kickstarter.com looking 
for it. In the table shown next, several methods for pro-
moting a Kickstarter campaign are listed.
Third, the majority of donations are made at the 
beginning and the end of campaigns. As a result, 
shorter campaigns are typically more effective than 
longer ones. A Kickstarter campaign can last between 
one and 60 days. Campaigns lasting less than 30 days 
have the highest success rates. If a campaign is too

execution
E-mail
Send an e-mail to your e-mail distribution list, describing the campaign. Kickstarter campaigns 
aren’t funded entirely by strangers. Instead, they’re often funded largely by the campaign 
 initiator’s friends, family, business associates, and so forth.
Twitter and Facebook
Reach out to both your Twitter and Facebook audiences. Provide frequent updates. Try to find 
the balance between saturating your Twitter followers and Facebook friends with Kickstarter 
info and providing them with timely reminders.
Blogs and media
Reach out to bloggers and news outlets in the industry that your campaign focuses on. Ask 
that they mention your campaign and offer support. For example, it would make sense for 
Memobottle to reach out to bloggers and journalists who write about environmental issues.

s a student at MIT, one luxury that Megan Cox afforded herself was eyelash 
 extensions. After a while, however, the experience grew wearisome. The pro-
cess took up to three hours, included ingredients that she worried about (such 
as hormones and prostaglandin), and wasn’t that effective. The ex-
perience prompted Cox to start thinking about creating an eyelash 
extension product of her own.
In early 2012 Cox, who was a student in the Sloan School of 
Management at MIT, started studying the eyelash industry and the 
different options that were available. Although having long eyelashes 
was a hot new trend, many of the solutions had problems. Applying 
false eyelashes, one of the solutions, was frustrating for many peo-
ple. False eyelashes are often sticky and itch and use glues that can 
cause fungi to grow around the lash lines/eyes. Other options were 
equally unappealing. In some cases, people’s eyelashes grew longer 
but they still had sparse lashes. Additionally, once a person gained 
long eyelashes, maintaining them was pricey and time consuming.
Cox proceeded to start experimenting with formulations of her 
own. The goal was to create an all-natural lash and brow enhancer 
that would stimulate growth in dormant follicles while strengthening 
the lashes and brows that a person has. Drawing on her chemistry 
background, she considered different options before settling on 
a hypoallergenic formula made from natural ingredients. The product that emerged 
was an eyelash pen that, when glided along an individual’s lash line once a day, was 
intended to produce longer and healthier eyelashes. The pen, which would eventually 
retail for $39, contained enough ingredients to last three months.
Rather than rushing forward, Cox tested the product. The results were good. In 
testing trials, Wink, the name Cox attached to the product, increased eyelash full-
ness by up to 20 percent (60 lashes) in 100 percent of participants (after 8-10 weeks 
of product use). In addition, due to Wink’s conditioning effectiveness, eyelash length 
increased by up to 20 percent in 80 percent of the participants. Wink was also effec-
tive in regrowing eyebrows in patches where brows had previously stopped growing 
because of overplucking. Best of all, Wink was a hypoallergenic natural serum. Many 
cosmetic products cause allergic reactions, something Cox wanted to avoid. A hy-
poallergenic product causes fewer reactions. Wink was also minimally processed and 
free of parabens, sulfates, phthalates, horomoes/prostaglandins, artificial fragrances, 
and artificial dyes.

Unique Marketing Issues
ChApter 11

388    PART 4 | MAnAgIng AnD gROWIng An EnTREPREnEuRIAL FIRM
During this time, Cox teamed up with classmate Miguel Salinas. Cox and Salinas 
met through a mutual friend during Cox’s freshman year. The two became partners in 
Wink natural Cosmetics. At the time, Cox was studying management science, opera-
tions research, entrepreneurship, and finance, and Salinas was studying neuroscience. 
To determine the formula for Wink, the two looked at research papers and conducted 
experiments. They formally launched their company, Wink natural Cosmetics, in July 
2013. It was mostly bootstrapped, largely because, as Salinas said in an interview 
with Dorm Startups, “no one took it seriously.”1 Wink was entering a mature market 
with established competitors. The product was offered on Wink’s website; however, 
Cox and Salinas knew that salons would be the preferred channel to sell the product. 
It would be up to Cox and Salinas to convince salon owners to stock Wink natural 
Cosmetics and recommend it to their customers.
In terms of marketing, at the start Cox and Salinas were it. They wrote their own press 
releases, product descriptions, and brochures. To gain visibility, they sent samples to 
salons and sponsored events. They made contact with catalog companies and got Wink 
placed in several cosmetic catalogs. All of these efforts were aimed at building Wink’s 
brand. They also reached out to salons by offering risk-free trials. They would send the 
product to salons in lots of 12, and, if they didn’t sell, would take them back. They found 
that the more they reached out to people in the cosmetics industry, the more people 
reached out to them in return. They also signed up several salons that agreed to act as 
distributors and place Wink’s products in other salons. Cox and Salinas experienced 
several surprises along the way, one of which was the target market. As it turned out, 
the salons that carried Wink’s products had the most luck selling to 50- to 60-year-old 
women. That realization changed Cox and Salinas’s marketing tactics some. Wink is not 
big into social media, for example, because 50- to 60-year-old women are not heavy us-
ers of social media.
Wink’s products are made in both China and the united States. The bottles and 
boxes are made in China, while the product itself is manufactured and placed in the 
bottles in the united States. The manufacturing is done in an FDA approved facility. 
In terms of future growth, Cox and Salinas plan to grow Wink natural Cosmetics in 
two ways. First, they plan to continue to increase the number of salons that carry the 
product. There are no present plans to place Wink in a mainstream retailer such as 
Walgreens or CVS. Second, they plan to introduce new complementary products, such 
as brightening and anti-aging creams.2
When talking about her experiences, one thing Cox stresses is to not underestimate 
yourself. At one point Wink hired a PR firm to write press releases, for example. Cox 
says that the press releases that she wrote were better than the ones that came from the 
PR firm. It’s also important to get free press. Cox actively reached out to organizations 
that write about student-initiated companies. Many took an interest in Cox and Salinas 
and wrote articles or included them in lists of top college start-ups. For example, Wink 
natural Cosmetics was included in the list of “America’s Coolest College Startups” by 
Inc. magazine in 2014. Cox and Salinas believe that generating positive press is helpful 
in building a company’s brand.
I
n this chapter, we’ll look at the marketing challenges confronting entrepre-
neurial firms. Marketing is a broad subject, and there are many books and 
websites dedicated to marketing and its subfields. However, in this chapter, 
we zero in on the marketing challenges that are most pressing for young en-
trepreneurial firms. The reason for doing this is that marketing is an essential

We begin this chapter by discussing how firms define and select their tar-
get markets. Next, we discuss how a firm establishes a brand. We then con-
sider the four key aspects of marketing as they relate to young entrepreneurial 
firms. These four aspects, commonly referred to as the “4Ps” of marketing, are 
product, price, promotion, and place (or distribution). We conclude the chapter 
with a discussion of the sales process, which consists of the steps a company 
goes through to establish relationships with customers and close sales. Many 
new ventures do a good job of developing products and defining the size of 
their markets, but do a poor job of dealing with the practicalities of how the 
products will be sold. It’s imperative that a new business have a plan that de-
tails how it will sell its product within the confines of a reasonable budget.
selecting a Market and establishing 
a position
To succeed, a new firm must know who its customers are and how to reach 
them. A firm uses a three-step process to determine who its customers are. 
These steps, which are shown in Figure 11.1, include segmenting the market, se-
lecting a target market, and crafting a unique position within the target market.
As noted in Chapter 3, a firm’s target market is the limited group of individu-
als or businesses that it tries to appeal to. It is important that a new venture 
choose its target market and position inside in its target market quickly because 
virtually all of its marketing choices hinge on these critical initial choices. For 
example, GreatCall makes cell phones designed specifically for older people. If 
GreatCall had designed a distribution strategy, for example, prior to determining 
that it would target older people, it might have designed a strategy that placed 
its phones in retail outlets not frequented by older people. Its decision to target 
older people will have a bearing on every element of its marketing plan.
Segmenting the Market
The first step in selecting a target market is to study the industry in which the 
firm intends to compete and determine the different potential target markets 
in that industry. This process is called market segmentation, as explained in 
Chapter 6. Market segmentation is important because a new firm typically has 
only enough resources to target one market segment, at least initially.4 Markets 
can be segmented in many ways, such as by geography (city, state, coun-
try), demographic variables (age, gender, family size, income), psychographic 
variables (personality, lifestyle, values), behavioral variables (benefits sought, 
product usage rates, brand loyalty), and product type (varies by product). For 
example, the computer industry can be segmented by product type (i.e., hand-
held computers, tablet computers, laptops, PCs, work stations, minicomputers, 
mainframes, and super computers) or customers served (i.e., individuals, busi-
nesses, schools, and government).

Sometimes a firm segments its market on more than one dimension to drill 
down to a specific market segment that the firm thinks it is uniquely capable 
of serving. For example, GreatCall probably segmented its market by age and 
benefits sought. Its ideal customer is someone who is older (age) and is looking 
for a cell phone that’s easy to use (benefits sought).
To test whether you have segmented your market successfully, consider 
these requirements for successful market segmentation:
■ Homogeneity of needs and wants appears within the segment.
■ Heterogeneity of needs and wants exists between the segments.
■ Differences within the segment should be small compared to differences 
across segments.
■ The segment should be distinct enough so that its members can be easily 
identified.
■ It should be possible to determine the size of the segment.
■ The segment should be large enough for the firm to earn profits.
If an entrepreneur is not familiar with how to segment a particular market, 
IBISWorld, Mintel, and BizMiner, which are online databases often available 
through large university libraries, provide suggestions. They even show the size 
of the segments. For example, IBISWorld segments the gym, health, and fitness 
club industry (NAICS 71394) by service provided. The $26.5 billion industry is 
65 percent gyms and fitness centers, 10 percent other, 7 percent dance centers, 
7 percent swimming pools, 6 percent ice and roller rinks, and 5 percent tennis 
centers.5
Despite its importance, market segmentation is a process entrepreneurs 
commonly overlook. Overlooking this step can result in a faulty assessment 
of the size of the potential market for a new product or service. If a start-up 
planned to open a chain of tennis centers, for example, it would be incorrect to 
say that the total market potential is $26.5 billion. Tennis centers are 5 percent 
of the larger $26.5 billion gym, health, and fitness club industry, which equates 
to a $1.3 billion market. This doesn’t mean that a tennis center business 
couldn’t be profitable or that the new business couldn’t expand the market for 
tennis. It’s just that the entrepreneur should enter the business with a realistic 
assessment of the size of its market.
Selecting a target Market
Once a firm has segmented the market, the next step is to select a target mar-
ket. As discussed in previous chapters, the market must be sufficiently attrac-
tive, and the firm must be able to serve it well. Typically, a firm (especially a 
start-up venture) doesn’t target an entire segment of a market because many 
market segments are too large to target successfully. Instead, most firms tar-
get a niche market within the segment. For example, within the dance studio 
market, there are several small niche markets that companies can choose to 
target. A niche market is a place within a market segment that represents 
a narrow group of customers with similar interests. For example, Broadway 
Dance Center in New York City targets serious dancers who aspire to earn a liv-
ing dancing in Broadway plays.6 That’s an entirely different niche than a studio 
teaching ballroom dancing or a studio teaching ballet to young girls. By focus-
ing on a clearly defined market, a firm can become an expert in that market 
and then be able to provide its customers with high levels of value and service. 
Focusing on a clearly defined market requires a firm to know what not to do 
along with what to do. An example of a company that’s successfully sorted this 

ChAPTER 11 | unIquE MarketIng ISSuES    391
out is MailFinch, a company specializing in managing other companies’ direct 
mail campaigns. According to its founder, Paul Singh:
Looking back at the recent growth of MailFinch, most of the success can be at-
tributed to what the product can’t do. We do very few things, but we do those 
things better than anyone else in the game and we make it drop-dead simple to 
get started (with the MailFinch service).7
A firm’s choice of target markets must also be in sync with its business 
model and the backgrounds and skills of its founders and other employees. 
A firm must also continually monitor the attractiveness of its target market. 
Societal preferences change, a fact that sometimes causes a target market 
to lose its attractiveness for a firm and the product or service it has to offer 
customers.
Crafting a unique Market position
After selecting a target market, the firm’s next step is to establish a “posi-
tion” within it that differentiates it from its competitors. As we discussed in 
Chapter 5, position is concerned with how the firm is situated relative to com-
petitors. For example, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Art & Style Dance Studio 
specializes in Latin and Ballroom dancing.8 That’s a different position than 
the Arthur Murray Dance Studio in Pittsburgh that offers instruction in Fox 
Trot, Waltz, Tango, Viennese Waltz, Quickstep, and Salsa.9 A firm’s market 
position is defined by its products or services. Determining which position in 
a market to occupy and compete in is a strategic call on the part of a company 
based on its mission, its overall approach to the marketplace, and its competi-
tive landscape.
Once a company has identified its position and primary points of differ-
entiation, a helpful technique is to develop a product attribute map, which 
illustrates a firm’s positioning strategy relative to its major rivals. A product 
attribute map for Snap Fitness is shown in Figure 11.2. Snap Fitness oper-
ates small gyms that are located near residential areas and are open 24 hours 
a day. The centers offer weights, treadmills, and exercise machines. They’re

staffed during the day and are available to members at night by swiping a key 
card at the main door. The equipment is start-of-the-art, and the centers are 
very clean and secure. They do not offer a wide range of amenities, such as 
swimming pools, locker rooms, exercise classes, racquetball courts, and mas-
sages. The centers offer their members a fast, convenient, and affordable way 
to develop and maintain fitness. A membership costs around $35 a month for 
a single membership, $50 for a couple, and $60 for a family.
This firm’s product attribute map is based on the two primary attributes 
that people look for in a fitness center—range of amenities provided and the 
extent to which the center is both affordable and convenient. The point is to 
assess Snap Fitness’s strengths and/or weaknesses in each of these categories 
and plot it on the map. The same is done for Snap Fitness’s major competitors. 
The results are shown in Figure 11.2. While Snap Fitness does not rank high 
in terms of amenities provided, it outranks its competitors by a wide margin 
in terms of being convenient and affordable. As a result, it stresses its conve-
nience and affordability in its promotions, rather than drawing attention to its 
lack of amenities. Snap Fitness’s tagline is “fast convenient affordable.”10 Any 
firm can develop a similar product attribute map to illustrate its position in an 
industry and help direct its marketing plan.
To support their positioning strategy, firms often develop a tagline, just 
like Snap Fitness has done, to reinforce the position they have staked out in 
the marketplace. A tagline is a catchy phrase that’s used consistently in a 
company’s literature, advertisements, stationery, and even invoices, and thus 
becomes associated with that company—to reinforce the position it has staked 
out in the market. Table 11.1 is a short matching quiz that asks you to match 
companies featured in this book with their taglines. A company has created a 
successful tagline if the message makes you think of its products or services 
and the position it has established in its market.
branding
A brand is the set of attributes—positive or negative—that people associate 
with a company. These attributes can be positive, such as trustworthy, innova-
tive, dependable, or easy to deal with. Or they can be negative, such as cheap, 
unreliable, arrogant, or difficult to deal with. The customer loyalty a company 
creates through its brand is one of its most valuable assets. Lending support to

this sentiment, Russell Hanlin, the CEO of Sunkist Growers, said, “An orange 
is an orange … is an orange. Unless … that orange happens to be a Sunkist, a 
name 80 percent of consumers know and trust.”11 By putting its name on an 
orange, Sunkist is making a promise to its customers that the orange will be 
wholesome and fresh. It is important that Sunkist not break this promise. Some 
companies monitor the integrity of their brands through brand management, 
which is a program used to protect the image and value of an organization’s 
brand in consumers’ minds. This means that if Sunkist discovered that some of 
its oranges weren’t fresh, it would take immediate steps to correct the problem.
Table 11.2 lists the different ways people think about the meaning of a 
brand. All the sentiments expressed in the table are similar, but they illustrate 
the multifaceted nature of a company’s brand.
Start-ups must build a brand from scratch; this process begins with se-
lecting the company’s name, as described in Chapter 7’s appendix. One of the 
keys to effective branding is to create a strong personality for a firm, designed 
to appeal to the chosen target market.12 Southwest Airlines, for example, has

that people associate

■ A brand is a promise to serve stakeholders’ interests.
■ A brand is a firm’s guarantee of a level of performance.
■ A brand indicates the promises a firm makes to those it serves.
■ A brand expresses a firm’s reputation.
■ A brand presents a firm’s credentials.
■ A brand is an indicator of trust and reduced risk.
■ A brand describes a company’s nature.
■ A brand serves as a handshake between a firm and its customers.

created a brand that denotes fun. This is a good fit for its historical and cur-
rent primary target market: people traveling for pleasure rather than busi-
ness. Similarly, Starbucks and Panera Bread have each created a brand that 
denotes an experience framed around warmth and hospitality, encouraging 
people to linger and buy additional products. A company ultimately wants 
its customers to strongly identify with it—to see themselves as “Southwest 
Airlines flyers” or as “Panera Bread diners.” People won’t do this, however, 
unless they see a company as being different from competitors in ways that 
create value for them.
So how does a new firm develop a brand? On a philosophical level, a firm 
must have meaning in its customers’ lives. It must create value—something for 
which customers are willing to pay. Imagine a father shopping for airline tickets 
so that he can take his three children to see their grandparents for Christmas. 
If Southwest Airlines can get his family to their destination for $75 per ticket 
cheaper than its competitors, Southwest has real meaning in the father’s life. 
Similarly, if a young couple invites neighbors to play Cranium, a group board 
game, and playing the game results in lasting friendships, Cranium will have a 
special place in their hearts.
On a more practical level, brands are built through a number of techniques, 
including advertising, public relations, sponsorships, support of social causes, 
social media, and good performance. A firm’s name, logo, website design, 
Facebook page, and even its letterhead are part of its brand. It’s important for 
start-ups, particularly if they plan to sell to other businesses, to have a pol-
ished image immediately so that they have credibility when they approach their 
potential customers.
Most experts warn against placing an overreliance on advertising to build 
a firm’s brand. A more affordable approach is to rely on word of mouth, the 
media, and ingenuity to create positive buzz about a company. Creating buzz 
means creating awareness and a sense of anticipation about a company and 
its offerings.13 This process can start during feasibility analysis, when a com-
pany shows its concept statement or product prototype to prospective buyers 
or industry experts. Unless a company wants what it is doing to be kept secret 
(to preserve its proprietary technology or its first-mover advantage), it hopes 
that people start talking about it and its exciting new product or service. This 
is certainly the case for movie production studios, as they hope that people 
talking about a movie they enjoyed watching will encourage others to visit their 
local theaters.14 In addition, newspapers, magazines, blogs, and trade journals 
are always looking for stories about interesting companies. In fact, receiving 
a favorable review of its products or services in a magazine, trade journal, or 
highly respected blog lends a sense of legitimacy to a firm that would be hard 
to duplicate through advertisements.
Focusing too much on the features and benefits of their products is a com-
mon mistake entrepreneurs make when trying to gain attention from the media. 
Journalists are typically skeptical when entrepreneurs start talking about how 
great their products are relative to those of their competitors. What journalists 
usually prefer is a human interest story about why a firm was started or a story 
focused on something that’s distinctly unique about the start-up.
Ultimately, a strong brand can be a very powerful asset for a firm. Over 
50 percent of consumers say that a known and trusted brand is a reason to 
buy a product.15 As a result, a brand allows a company to charge a price for 
its products that is consistent with its image. A successful brand can also in-
crease the market value of a company by 50 to 75 percent.16 This increased 
valuation can be very important to a firm if it is acquired, merges with another 
firm, or launches an initial public offering (IPO). Brand equity is the term 
that denotes the set of assets and liabilities that are linked to a brand and 
enable it to raise a firm’s valuation.17 It is important for firms to understand 
brand equity and how to use it to create value.

ChAPTER 11 | unIquE MarketIng ISSuES    395
Although the assets and liabilities that make up a firm’s brand equity will 
vary from context to context, they usually are grouped into the following five 
categories:
■ Brand loyalty
■ Name recognition
■ Perceived quality (of a firm’s products and services)
■ Brand associations in addition to quality (e.g., good service)
■ Other proprietary assets, such as patents, trademarks, and high-quality 
partnerships
One aspect of branding that start-ups should be alert to is the possibility of 
forming co-branding relationships. Co-branding is when two companies form a 
partnership to combine their brands. The objective is to combine the strengths 
of the brands. A co-branding relationship can be short term, to promote a spe-
cific event or product launch, or can be long term, such as opening co-branded 
stores. An example of a co-branding alliance is provided in the “Partnering 
for Success” feature. In this example two companies, Bruegger’s Bagels and 
Caribou Coffee, are testing a fairly involved co-branding relationship where 
they’re opening new restaurants that will be jointly operated and branded by 
the two companies.
the 4ps of Marketing for new ventures
Once a company decides on its target market, establishes a position within 
that market, and establishes a brand, it is ready to begin planning the details 
of its marketing mix. A firm’s marketing mix is the set of controllable, tacti-
cal marketing tools that it uses to produce the response it wants in the target 
market.18 Most marketers organize their marketing mix into four categories: 
product, price, promotion, and place (or distribution). For an obvious reason, 
these categories are commonly referred to as the 4Ps.
The way a firm sells and distributes its product dramatically affects a 
company’s marketing program. This effect means that the first decision a firm 
has to make is its overall approach to selling its product or service. Even for 
similar firms, the marketing mix can vary significantly, depending on the way 
the firms do business. For example, a software firm can sell directly through 
its website or through retail stores, or it can license its product to another 
company to be sold under that company’s brand name. A start-up that plans 
to sell directly to the public would set up its promotions program in a much 
different way than a firm planning to license its products to other firms. A 
firm’s marketing program should be consistent with its business model and its 
overall business plan.
Let’s look more closely at the 4Ps. Again, these are broad topics on which 
entire books have been written. In this section, we focus on the aspects of the 
4Ps that are most relevant to entrepreneurial ventures.
product
A firm’s product, in the context of its marketing mix, is the good or service it 
offers to its target market. Technically, a product is something that takes on 
physical form, such as an Apple iPhone, a bicycle, or a solar panel. A service 
is an activity or benefit that is intangible and does not take on a physical form, 
such as an airplane trip or advice from an attorney. But when discussing a 
firm’s marketing mix, both products and services are lumped together under 
the label “product.”

accounting systems, etc. The co-branded stores will op-

So far so good. “We’ve been thrilled with the perfor-
mance of our dual operations so far,” Judy Kadylak, direc-
tor of marketing for Bruegger’s, said in an article posted 
on the Foodservice Equipment & Supplies website (http://
fesmag.com). If the initial test sites remain successful, 
the next co-branded stores will open in Raleigh, north 
Carolina, in Iowa, and in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area.
Along with co-branding stores, like Caribou Coffee 
and Bruegger’s Bagels are doing, co-branding can take 
on other forms. To learn more about co-branding, go to 
www.google.com, type the term “co-branding” into the 
search engine, and select images. You’ll see hundreds of 
example of co-branding. In many instances, companies 
will co-brand products rather than their entire compa-
nies. An example is a co-branding relationship between 
Element Skateboard and TOMS shoes. The TOMS logo 
is placed on the underside of Element skateboards. Each 
brand presumably benefits from the brand loyalty and 
the reputation of the other.

C
o-branding is when two companies form an alliance 
to work together. The idea is to create market-
ing synergy. Synergy is the concept of 2 + 2 = 5. 
Synergy is achieved in a co-branding relationship when 
two brands working together achieve more than the 
brands could have cumulatively achieved on their own. 
This is possible, in a successful co-branding relation-
ship, when each brand benefits from the brand loyalty 
and the reputation of the other.
Two companies that recently formed a co-branding 
partnership are Caribou Coffee and Bruegger’s Bagels. 
The idea grew out of a relationship between Caribou 
CEO Mike Tattersfield and Claude Bergeron, co-CEO of 
Bruegger’s parent company, Le Duff America. It also grew 
out of a recognition that the two companies do best when 
located near each other. As of late 2013, Caribou Coffee 
and Bruegger’s Bagels operated stores literally next door 
to each other in 10 Minneapolis-St. Paul locations, along 
with an 11th location in Raleigh, north Carolina. Those 
stores are some of the best performing for both chains. 
Caribou and Bruegger’s have complimentary offerings. 
People often eat bagels and drink coffee together. So the 
two executives concluded that trying co-branding was a 
reasonable decision to reach.
The companies decided to start slowly. As of early 
2014, three co-branded stores are open, with more to 
follow if the initial stores are successful. The co-branded 
stores project a cohesive brand by incorporating both 
company’s logos. The stores to follow will incorporate 
design elements of Bruegger’s new store prototype. 
They’ll include large glass windows to separate the 
bakery from the dining room and give customers an 
unobstructed view of the baking process. They’ll also in-
clude a full barista system. This is where the co-branded 
restaurants will create synergy on the customer side. The 
restaurants will include bakeries where the food prod-
ucts will be made and barista stations where the spe-
cialty coffees and other beverages will be prepared, all 
visible to the customer (to provide a unique experience). 
This combination will provide the co-branded stores a 
source of differentiation and a hoped for competitive ad-
vantage in the marketplace.
unseen to the customer, the co-branded stores will 
have significant synergies in the back of the house as 
well. In instances where Caribou Coffee and Bruegger’s 
Bagel stores are situated side-by-side, each store has 
its own manager, its own purchasing system, its own

Determining the product or products to be sold is central to the firm’s en-
tire marketing effort. As stressed throughout this book, the most important 
attribute of a product is that it adds value in the minds of its target customers. 
Let’s think about this by comparing vitamins with pain pills, as articulated by 
Henry W. Chesbrough, a professor at Harvard University:
We all know that vitamins are good for us and that we should take them. Most of 
us, though, do not take vitamins on a regular basis, and whatever benefits vita-
mins provide do not seem to be greatly missed in the short term. People therefore 
pay relatively very little for vitamins. In contrast, people know when they need a 
pain killer. And they know they need it now, not later. They can also tell quite read-
ily whether the reliever is working. People will be willing to pay a great deal more 
for a pain reliever than they pay for a vitamin. In this context, the pain reliever pro-
vides a much stronger value proposition than does a vitamin—because the need is 
felt more acutely, the benefit is greater and is perceived much more quickly.19
This example illustrates at least in part why investors prefer to fund firms 
that potentially have breakthrough products, such as a software firm that is 
working on a product to eliminate e-mail spam or a biotech firm that is work-
ing on a cure for a disease. These products are pain pills rather than vitamins 
because their benefits would be felt intensely and quickly. In contrast, a new 
restaurant start-up or a new retail store may be exciting, but these types of 
firms are more akin to a vitamin than a pain pill. The benefits of these busi-
nesses would not be felt as intensely.
As the firm prepares to sell its product, an important distinction should be 
made between the core product and the actual product. While the core prod-
uct may be a CD that contains a tax preparation program, the actual product, 
which is what the customer buys, may have as many as five characteristics: a 
quality level, features, design, a brand name, and packaging.20 For example, 
TurboTax is an actual product. Its name, features, warranty, ability to upgrade, 
packaging, and other attributes have all been carefully combined to deliver 
the benefits of the product: helping people prepare their federal and state tax 
returns while receiving the biggest refund possible. When first introducing a 
product to the market, an entrepreneur needs to make sure that more than the 
core product is right. Attention also needs to be paid to the actual product—the 
features, design, packaging, and so on that constitute the collection of benefits 
that the customer ultimately buys. Anyone who has ever tried to remove a prod-
uct from a frustratingly rigid plastic container knows that the way a product is 
packaged is part of the product itself. The quality of the product should not be 
compromised by missteps in other areas.
The initial rollout is one of the most critical times in the marketing of a new 
product. All new firms face the challenge that they are unknown and that it 
takes a leap of faith for their first customers to buy their products. Some start-
ups meet this challenge by using reference accounts. A reference account is 
an early user of a firm’s product who is willing to give a testimonial regarding 
his or her experience with the product. For example, imagine the effect of a 
spokesperson for Apple Inc. saying that Apple used a new computer hardware 
firm’s products and was pleased with their performance. A testimonial such 
as this would pave the way for the sales force of this new firm’s hardware, and 
the new firm could use it to reduce fears that it was selling an untested and 
perhaps ineffective product.
To obtain reference accounts, new firms must often offer their product to 
an initial group of customers for free or at a reduced price in exchange for their 
willingness to try the product and for their feedback. There is nothing improper 
about this process as long as everything is kept aboveboard and the entrepre-
neur is not indirectly “paying” someone to offer a positive endorsement. Still, 
many entrepreneurs are reluctant to give away products, even in exchange for 

398    PART 4 | MAnAgIng AnD gROWIng An EnTREPREnEuRIAL FIRM
a potential endorsement. But there are several advantages to getting a strong 
set of endorsements: credibility with peers, non-company advocates who are 
willing to talk to the press, and quotes or examples to use in company bro-
chures and advertisements.
price
Price is the amount of money consumers pay to buy a product. It is the only 
element in the marketing mix that produces revenue; all other elements rep-
resent costs.21 Price is an extremely important element of the marketing mix 
because it ultimately determines how much money a company can earn. The 
price a company charges for its products also sends a clear message to its 
target market. For example, Oakley positions its sunglasses as innovative, 
state-of-the art products that are both high quality and visually appealing. 
This position in the market suggests the premium price that Oakley charges. 
If Oakley tried to establish the position described previously and charged a low 
price for its products, it would send confusing signals to its customers. Its cus-
tomers would wonder, “Are Oakley sunglasses high quality or aren’t they?” In 
addition, the lower price wouldn’t generate the sales revenue Oakley requires 
to continuously differentiate its sunglasses from competitors’ products in ways 
that create value for customers.
Most entrepreneurs use one of two methods to set the price for their prod-
ucts: cost-based pricing or value-based pricing.
Cost-based Pricing  In cost-based pricing, the list price is determined 
by adding a markup percentage to a product’s cost. The markup percentage 
may be standard for the industry or may be arbitrarily determined by the en-
trepreneur. The advantage of this method is that it is straightforward, and it 
is relatively easy to justify the price of a good or service. The disadvantage is 
that it is not always easy to estimate what the costs of a product will be. Once 
a price is set, it is difficult to raise it, even if a company’s costs increase in an 
unpredicted manner. In addition, cost-based pricing is based on what a com-
pany thinks it should receive rather than on what the market thinks a good or 
service is worth. It is becoming increasingly difficult for companies to dictate 
prices to their customers, given customers’ ability to comparison shop on the 
Internet to find what they believe is the best bargain for them.22
Value-based Pricing  In value-based pricing, the list price is deter-
mined by estimating what consumers are willing to pay for a product and 
then backing off a bit to provide a cushion. What a customer is willing to 
pay is determined by the perceived value of the product and by the number 
of choices available in the marketplace. Sometimes, to make this determi-
nation, a company has to work backwards by testing to see what its target 
market is willing to pay. A firm influences its customers’ perception of the 
value through positioning, branding, and the other elements of the market-
ing mix. Most experts recommend value-based pricing because it hinges on 
the perceived value of a product or service rather than cost plus markup, 
which, as stated previously, is a formula that ignores the customer.23 A 
gross margin (a company’s net sales minus its costs of goods sold) of 60 to 
80 percent is not uncommon in high-tech industries. An Intel chip that sells 
for $300 may cost $50 to $60 to produce. This type of markup reflects the 
perceived value of the chip. If Intel used a cost-based pricing method instead 
of a value-based approach, it would probably charge much less for its chips 
and earn less profit.
Most experts also warn entrepreneurs to resist the temptation to charge a 
low price for their products in the hopes of capturing market share. This ap-
proach can win a sale but generates little profit. In addition, most consumers 

ChAPTER 11 | unIquE MarketIng ISSuES    399
make a price-quality attribution when looking at the price of a product. This 
means that consumers naturally assume that the higher-priced product is 
also the better-quality product.24 If a firm charges a low price for its products, 
it sends a signal to its customers that the product is low quality regardless of 
whether it really is.
A vivid example of the association between price and quality is provided 
by SmugMug (www.smugmug.com), an online photo-sharing site that charges 
a $40-per-year base subscription fee. According to its website, the company 
has “Billions of Happy Photos” and “Millions of Happy Customers.” What’s 
interesting about the company is that most of its competitors, including 
Photobucket, Flicker, and Picas Web Albums, offer a similar service for free. 
Ostensibly, the reason SmugMug is able to charge a fee is that it offers higher 
levels of customer service and has a more user-friendly interface (in terms 
of how you view your photos online) than its competitors. But the owners of 
SmugMug feel that its ability to charge goes beyond these obvious points. 
Some of the free sites have closed abruptly, and their users have lost photos. 
SmugMug, because it charges, is seen as more reliable and dependable for the 
long term. (Who wants to lose their photos?) In addition, the owners believe 
that when people pay for something, they innately assign a higher value to it. 
As a result, SmugMug users tend to treat the site with respect, by posting at-
tractive, high-quality photos that are in good taste. SmugMug’s users appreci-
ate this facet of the site, compared to the free sites, where unseemly photos 
often creep in.25
The overarching point of this example is that the price a company is able 
to charge is largely a function of (1) the objective quality of a product or service 
and (2) the perception of value that is created in the minds of customers rela-
tive to competing products in the marketplace. These are issues a firm should 
consider when developing its positioning and branding strategies.
Price is such an important element of the marketing mix that, if a company 
gets it wrong, it can be extremely damaging to both the company’s short-term 
profits and future viability. The “What Went Wrong?” feature in this chapter 
focuses on marketing missteps at JCPenney. In 2011–2012, JCPenney, under 
the leadership of CEO Ron Johnson, made critical mistakes in the areas of 
branding, testing (or the lack thereof), and pricing. The mistakes provide les-
sons for start-ups of marketing miscues they should be particularly on guard 
to avoid in their own situations.
promotion
Promotion refers to the activities the firm takes to communicate the merits of 
its product to its target market. Ultimately, the goal of these activities is to per-
suade people to buy the product. There are a number of these activities, but 
most start-ups have limited resources, meaning that they must carefully study 
promotion activities before choosing the one or ones they’ll use. Let’s look at 
the most common activities entrepreneurs use to promote their products.
advertising  Advertising is making people aware of a product in hopes of 
persuading them to buy it. Advertising’s major goals are to:
■ Raise customer awareness of a product
■ Explain a product’s comparative features and benefits
■ Create associations between a product and a certain lifestyle
These goals can be accomplished through a number of media including direct 
mail, magazines, newspapers, radio, the Internet, blogs, television, and billboard 
advertising. The most effective ads tend to be those that are memorable and

A
fter successful stretches at Target and Apple, it 
seemed as though Ron Johnson was a master mar-
keter. But things went sour quickly after JCPenney 
hired Johnson as its CEO. Johnson’s attempt to reinvent 
JCPenney’s brand, change its pricing strategy, and over-
haul the way the company did business all fell flat. In fact, 
during Johnson’s 17-month tenure, JCPenney’s sales fell 
quickly, loyal customers deserted the company, and em-
ployee morale hit an all-time low.
JCPenney hired Johnson in June 2011. The idea 
was to bring in a marketing wiz to revitalize JCPenney’s 
tired brand. Johnson seemed to have all the right 
credentials. At Target, Johnson was vice president of 
merchandising, where he was responsible for launching 
the Michael graves line of consumer products that en-
hanced Target’s image. his most recent job was senior 
vice president of retail operations at Apple, where he 
was largely responsible for the sleek look and solid suc-
cess of Apple stores.
Johnson hit the ground running at JCPenney with 
bold plans. his goal was to revitalize JCPenney by 
breathing new life into its stores and brand. When he 
was brought in, JCPenney was an unremarkable but 
solid chain of 1,100 stores serving middle America. Sales 
were around $17.5 billion a year. When he left sales had 
plummeted to $13 billion and JCPenney was running low 
on cash. What went wrong?
According to a general consensus, Johnson made 
three primary mistakes during his stint at JCPenney. The 
mistakes involve various facets of marketing, and they 
are mistakes that start-ups can learn from.
Mistake #1—Fair and Square Pricing. In early 2012, 
Johnson announced that JCPenney would no longer of-
fer merchandise on “sale.” Instead, the company would 
offer “fair and square” everyday low pricing. The idea was 
to offer a fair price from the get-go, rather than marking 
a product high and then cutting the price several times 
before eventually getting to the fair price.
The strategy didn’t work. It turns out shoppers like 
looking for bargains. It’s somewhat of a game—shoppers 
see a new shirt or blouse priced at $50, and then wait for 
it to go on “sale” for $35 before buying. none of the shirts 
or blouses sell for $50, so Johnson figured why play 
games, just list the shirt or blouse for $35 from the outset. 
But it turns out that shoppers are accustomed to and like 
playing the game. There is a certain satisfaction in “sav-
ing” $15 on a shirt or blouse that a shopper doesn’t get 
paying the same price initially. As a result, loyal JCPenney 
shoppers left in droves for T.J.Maxx, Kohl’s, and Macy’s, 
where the game was ongoing.
Terminology was also a problem. As part of fair and 
square pricing, JCPenney had two tiers of pricing for a 
period of time: red tickets indicated that the items were 
“everyday” merchandise pricing, and clearance items 
had blue stickers that designated “best price.” The result 
was widespread customer confusion. Shoppers didn’t 
understand what the terms meant. It was another reason 
to abandon JCPenney and go to a different store.
In fairness to Johnson, fair and square pricing had 
worked at Apple. Apple doesn’t price computers, iPhones, 
or iPads at one price and then slash the price and offer 
the product on sale. The mistake Johnson made was to 
equate the way people buy technology products with 
the way people buy clothing and other products sold at 
JCPenney. Consumers are accustomed to paying full 
freight for technology products, but not for clothing. By 
the time JCPenney tried to reverse its pricing strategy, 
significant damage had been done.
Mistake #2—no Testing of Ideas in Advance. The 
reason Johnson wasn’t able to anticipate the negative 
response to fair and square pricing is because it wasn’t 
tested in advance. When Johnson proposed his bold new 
strategy, he was asked about the possibility of trying it 
out on a limited test basis. According to several published 
reports, Johnson shot down the idea by saying that he 
didn’t test at Apple.
Imagine what could have been learned by simply 
testing fair and square pricing at a handful of stores be-
fore rolling it out system-wide. Surely, much would have 
been learned. The fact is that JCPenney’s loyal custom-
ers loved sales and the prospect of finding a “steal” via 
rounds of markdowns. Also, a simple trial period should 
have revealed the type of confusion resulting from the 
new terminology that was put in use.
Mistake #3—A Total Misread of JCPenney’s Brand. 
Perhaps the most damaging mistake was a total misread 
of JCPenney’s brand. Johnson envisioned JCPenney 
stores having “stores within the stores,” which would be 
boutiques were people could buy specialty merchan-
dise or get their nails done. he wanted JCPenney to be 
Americans’ “favorite place to shop.” his goal was for 
people to show up and hang out at JCPenney stores, like 
people hang out at Apple stores, and gladly pay a full but 
fair price. It never happened. JCPenney’s core clientele 
was thrift-minded shoppers who brought impatient kids 
into the store to buy school clothes. They also tended to 
move through the stores quickly when shopping alone. 
The consensus view is that Johnson wanted JCPenney 
shoppers to be something they weren’t. he wanted them 
to be more like Apple shoppers. Instead, there was more 
overlap with T.J.Maxx or even Walmart.
The Ron Johnson era ended in January 2013, just 17 
months after it began. he was replaced by his predeces-
sor, Mike ullman.
Questions for Critical Thinking
 1. how does a start-up establish a “brand”? What do we 
learn from JCPenney’s miscues about the importance 
of branding?

 2. Although the concept of selecting a target market and 
establishing a unique position is not specifically men-
tioned in the feature, what do we learn about these two 
topics from JCPenney’s miscues?
 3. What type of testing should a start-up do to ensure 
that its initial customers see its brand in the way that 
the company intended?
 4. Do a little Internet or gumshoe research on JCPenney 
today. Where does the company stand in terms of how 
support a product’s brand. However, advertising has some major weaknesses, 
including the following:
■ Low credibility
■ The possibility that a high percentage of the people who see the ad will not 
be interested
■ Message clutter (meaning that after hearing or reading so many ads, peo-
ple simply tune out)
■ Relative costliness compared to other forms of promotions
■ The perception that advertising is intrusive26
Because of these weaknesses, most start-ups do not advertise their prod-
ucts broadly. Instead, they tend to be very frugal and selective in their advertis-
ing efforts or engage in hybrid promotional campaigns that aren’t advertising 
per se, but are designed to promote a product or service.
Along with engaging in hybrid promotional campaigns, many start-ups 
advertise in trade journals or utilize highly focused pay-per-click advertising 
provided by Google, Bing, or another online firm to economize the advertising 
dollars. Pay-per-click advertising represents a major innovation in advertising 
and has been embraced by firms of all sizes. Google has two pay-per-click pro-
grams—AdWords and AdSense. AdWords allows an advertiser to buy keywords 
on Google’s home page (www.google.com), which triggers text-based ads to the 
side (and sometimes above) the search results when the keyword is used. So, 
if you type “soccer ball” into the Google search bar, you will see ads that have 
been paid for by companies that have soccer balls to sell. Many advertisers 
report impressive results utilizing this approach, presumably because they 
are able to place their ads in front of people who are already searching for in-
formation about their product. Google’s other pay-per-click program is called 
AdSense. It is similar to AdWords, except the advertiser’s ads appear on other 
websites instead of Google’s home page. For example, an organization that pro-
motes soccer might allow Google to place some of its client’s ads on its website. 
The advertiser pays on a pay-for-click basis when its ad is clicked on the soccer 
organization’s site. Google shares the revenue generated by the advertisers with 
the sponsoring site. Table 11.3 provides a summary of the Google AdWords and 
Google AdSense programs. Yahoo and Microsoft’s joint program, which is very 
similar to Google’s, is called the Yahoo Bing Network. The Yahoo Bing Network 
is a joint venture between Yahoo and Microsoft to sell pay-per-click ads on both 
the Yahoo and the Microsoft Bing search engines.
As an aside, online advertising in general allows people who know a lot 
about a particular topic to launch a website, populate it with articles, tips, 
videos, and other useful information, and make money online by essentially 
selling access to the people attracted to the website. For example, Tim Carter, 
a well-known columnist on home repair, has a website named Ask the Builder 
(www.askthebuilder.com). Information and instructions on all types of home 

402    PART 4 | MAnAgIng AnD gROWIng An EnTREPREnEuRIAL FIRM
building projects and repair are available on this website, as are links to areas 
that focus on specific topics, such as air-conditioning, cabinets, deck con-
struction, and plumbing. Clicking any one of these areas brings up online ads 
that deal with that specific area. All together, the site has hundreds of ads. 
Carter is able to do this and still attract large numbers of visitors because the 
information he provides is good and helpful. He might also believe that his ads, 
in a certain respect, add valuable content to the site. If someone is looking at 
the portion of his site that deals with how to construct a deck, he or she might 
actually appreciate seeing ads that point to websites where books and blue-
prints for building decks are available.
Another medium for advertising, which is growing in popularity, is social 
media sites, such as Facebook. The advantage of Facebook, in particular, is 
that it allows companies to deliver highly targeted ads based on where people 
live and how they describe themselves on their Facebook profiles. For example, 
a company that sells licensed sports apparel for the Boston Red Sox can deliver 
a highly targeted ad to the people most likely to buy its products. The company 
could deliver ads exclusively to men who live in Massachusetts and cite the 
Boston Red Sox in their Facebook profiles. Any company can identify its ideal 
potential customer and deliver targeted Facebook ads in the same manner.
The steps involved in putting together an advertisement are shown in 
Figure 11.3. Typically, for start-up firms, advertisements are the most effective 
if they’re part of a coordinated marketing campaign.27 For example, a print ad 
might feature a product’s benefits and direct the reader to a website or Facebook 
page for more information. The website or Facebook page might offer access to 
coupons or other incentives if the visitor fills out an information request form 
(which asks for name, address, and phone number). The names collected from 
the information request form could then be used to make sales calls.

The program includes local, national, and international 
distribution.
Advertisers are not restricted to text-based ads. Choices 
 include text, image, and video advertisements.
Advertisers specify the maximum amount they are willing to 
pay per click. The ordering of the paid listings on the search 
results depends on other advertisers’ bids and the historical 
click-through rates of all ads shown for a given search.
Advertisers benefit because their ads are seen as less 
 intrusive than most banner ads, because the content of 
the ad is often relevant to the website.
Advertisers have the option of enabling their ads to be 
 displayed on google’s partner network. This network 
 includes AOL, Ask.com, and netscape.
Website owners benefit by using the service to monetize 
their websites.
Advertisers benefit because they are able to place their  
ads in front of people who are already searching for 
 information about their product.
A companion to the regular AdSense program, AdSense for 
Search lets website owners place the google search box on 
their website. google shares any ad revenues it makes from 
those searches.

Public relations  One of the most cost-effective ways to increase the 
awareness of the products a company sells is through public relations. Public 
 relations refers to efforts to establish and maintain a company’s image with 
the public. The major difference between public relations and advertising is 
that public relations is not paid for directly. The cost of public relations to a 
firm is the effort it makes to network with journalists, blog authors, and other 
people to try to interest them in saying or writing good things about the com-
pany and its products. Several techniques fit the definition of public relations, 
as shown in Table 11.4. Airbnb’s campaign to reach out to bloggers, chronicled 
in the “Savvy Entrepreneurial Firm” feature in this chapter, is an example of a 
public relations campaign.
Many start-ups emphasize public relations over advertising primarily be-
cause it’s cheaper and helps build the firm’s credibility. In slightly different 
words, it may be better to start with public relations rather than advertising 
because people view advertising as the self-serving voice of a company that’s 
anxious to make a sale.28 A firm’s public relations effort can be oriented to tell-
ing the company’s story through a third party, such as a magazine or a news-
paper. If a magazine along the lines of Inc., Entrepreneur, or Fortune publishes 
a positive review of a new company’s products, or a company is profiled in a 
prominent blog, consumers are likely to believe that those products are at least 
worth a try. They think that because these magazines and blogs have no vested 
interest in the company, they have no reason to stretch the truth or lie about 
the usefulness or value of a company’s products. Technology companies, for ex-
ample, that are featured on TechCrunch or Mashable, two popular technology 
blogs, typically see an immediate spike in their Web traffic and sales as a result 
of the mention.
There are many ways in which a start-up can enhance its chances of getting 
noticed by the press, a blogger, or someone who is influential in social media. As 
mentioned earlier, journalists and others are typically not interested in overtly 
helping a firm promote its product. Instead, what they prefer is a human inter-
est story about why a firm was started or a story that focuses on something 
that is particularly unique about the start-up. The “Savvy Entrepreneurial 
Firm” feature in this chapter affirms these points. The feature focuses on how 
Airbnb, which is a marketplace for people to list, discover, and book unique 
spaces (typically in people’s homes or apartments), used blogs as a stepping-
stone to generate substantial buzz about its start-up. Another technique is to 
prepare a press kit, which is a folder that contains background information 
about the company and includes a list of its most recent accomplishments. The

kit is normally distributed to journalists and made available online. Attending 
trade shows can also contribute to a firm’s visibility. A trade show is an event 
at which the goods or services in a specific industry are exhibited and dem-
onstrated. Members of the media often attend trade shows to get the latest 
industry news. For example, the largest trade show for consumer electronics is 
International CES, which is held in Las Vegas every January. Many companies 
wait until this show to announce their most exciting new products. They do this 
in part because they have a captive media audience that is eager to find inter-
esting stories to write about. Fitbit’s exhibit at a recent International CES show 
is pictured in Chapter 5.
Social Media  Use of social media consists primarily of blogging and estab-
lishing a presence and connecting with customers and others through social 
networking sites such as Facebook or Twitter. Many of the new ventures fea-
tured in this book are active users of social media. A good example is ModCloth, 
the focus of Case 11.1. ModCloth maintains an active blog, has three separate 
Twitter accounts (one for general product information, one that is more fashion 
oriented, and one for recruiting), and maintains an energetic Facebook page.
The idea behind blogs is that they familiarize people with a business and 
help build an emotional bond between a business and its customers. ModCloth’s 
blog (http://blog.modcloth.com), for example, draws attention to the company’s 
products, but also posts fun, entertaining, and informative articles, features, 
and photos of interest to ModCloth’s target market—18- to 32-year-old women. 
Table 11.4  public relations techniques
technique
Description
Press release
An announcement made by a firm that is circulated to the press. Start-ups typically circulate 
a press release when something positive happens, such as the launch of a new product or 
the hiring of a new executive.
Traditional media coverage
Any coverage in print or broadcast media. In most cases, start-ups try to cultivate media 
coverage, as long as it is positive.
Social media coverage
Start-ups use social media (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) as a way of communicating 
and building rapport with customers, and also covet positive mentions in the social media 
efforts of others. For example, a positive mention by someone who posts on Twitter and has 
a large number of followers can positively impact a start-up.
Articles in industry press 
and periodicals
Articles in industry press and periodicals are particularly coveted because they are read by 
people already interested in the industry in which the start-up is participating.
Blogging
Companies benefit from blogging in three ways: First, by writing their own blog, as a way of 
building rapport with customers and the general public. Second, by commenting on entries 
contained in other companies’ or people’s blogs. Third, by contacting bloggers and asking 
them to comment on a company’s product or service. The general rule of thumb in blogging 
is that thoughtful and substantive contributions are fine. Outwardly talking about the merits 
of a company’s products is inappropriate, unless it’s on the company’s own blog.
Monthly newsletter
Many companies stay in touch with their potential target audience by producing and 
 distributing a monthly or quarterly newsletter. Along with containing updates on a firm’s 
products and services, the newsletter should contain more general information of interest 
to the reader. Companies should avoid sending out newsletters that simply brag about their 
products. These types of newsletters are often seen as too self-serving.
Civic, social, and community 
involvement
Start-ups often try to create a positive image of their organization by sponsoring local events 
or asking their employees to be involved in civic clubs such as the Chamber of Commerce or 
the Rotary Club.

ChAPTER 11 | unIquE MarketIng ISSuES    405
The blog also features contests that provide cash prizes, posts photos of custom-
ers wearing ModCloth products, and provides behind-the-scenes glimpses of 
what it’s like to work at ModCloth. For example, employees are allowed to bring 
dogs to work, which are called ModDogs. Periodically, one of the dogs is featured 
on the blog.
The key to maintaining a successful blog is to keep it fresh and make it 
informative and fun. It should also engage its readers in the “industry” and 
I
t’s important for entrepreneurial firms to generate press 
as effectively and inexpensively as possible. One start-
up, Airbnb, generated substantial press during its start-
up phase at very little cost. Its formula was novel, but it 
is instructive for any start-up trying to generate buzz and 
positive PR.
Airbnb is a marketplace for people to list, discover, 
and book unique spaces (typically in people’s homes or 
apartments) while traveling. It’s also useful for people who 
have space to rent to generate extra income. Founded 
in late 2007, the firm initially targeted people traveling to 
conferences and events in the united States. however, 
Airbnb now offers its services worldwide and has grown to 
allow people to rent space while traveling for any purpose 
(instead of business only, which was the initial focus).
Early on, observers were struck by the amount of 
press that Airbnb generated. In its first two years, the 
company was featured in time magazine, in the new 
York times, in the Washington Post, on Cnn, and in a 
variety of other places. There wasn’t any obvious reason 
Airbnb (called Air Bed & Breakfast at the time) was get-
ting so much attention. It didn’t have celebrity founders, 
wasn’t backed by a venture capital firm, and didn’t spend 
a ton of money. In fact, it was started by three previously 
unknown entrepreneurs and was bootstrapped until late 
2010. So how did they do it? It all started with blogs.
Shortly after the company launched, the firm’s found-
ers e-mailed as many design bloggers as they could, 
explaining the Airbnb concept. The founders were design-
ers, and the site was first used to help people attending 
design conferences find rooms in local designers’ homes 
for the duration of the conference. Several of the promi-
nent design blogs, including Core77.com, picked up the 
story and ran articles about the new service. This initial 
effort prompted a small mention in Mashable, a widely 
read social media blog. In an interview about how they 
generated so much press early on, Brian Chesky and Joe 
gebbia, two of Airbnb’s founders, characterized getting 
mentions in blogs as a progressive process. If you get 
mentioned by small blogs, it’s easier to get the attention 
of larger blogs, and a company sort of moves up the lad-
der. The process wasn’t totally efficient. They often had 
to reach out to several blogs to get a single mention, but 
overall the strategy worked.
next, they reached out to newspapers and maga-
zines, which was also a successful effort. Airbnb seemed 
to resonate with journalists because of the unique as-
pect of its service. But the blogs played an important 
role here too. One thing the founders of Airbnb learned is 
that the first thing a newspaper or magazine writer does, 
when pitched by a new company, is type the firm’s name 
into google to see if anyone else has written about them. 
Fair or unfair, a journalist is much more willing to write 
about a company if others are writing about it too. That’s 
one of the advantages of being covered by blogs—their 
stories will show up in google searches. Even mentions 
in small blogs, which generally appreciate being reached 
out to, show up in search engine searches.
Even though Airbnb is much more proven today, its 
founders still reach out to bloggers. They circle back to 
the blogs that have already written about them and ask 
them to write additional stories when there is something 
exciting to write about.
Questions for Critical Thinking
 1. how does an entrepreneur establish a “relationship” 
with an influential blogger?
 2. What’s the right way and what’s the wrong way to 
 approach a blogger about writing a post about a par-
ticular company?
 3. how important is generating press and PR for a start-up 
firm? Is it more important for some types of businesses 
than others? Explain your answer.
 4. Case 11.1 focuses on ModCloth, an online retailer that 
sells independent designer women’s fashion. Make 
a list of the blogs (minimum of five) that ModCloth’s 
founder could have potentially reached out to when 
the company was launched.

“lifestyle” that a company promotes as much as a company’s products. For 
example, just after Labor Day 2013, ModCloth posted the following on its blog:
If the old rule of not wearing white after Labor Day has you rolling your eyes, 
you’re not alone. We too believe that fashion rules were meant to be broken, so 
we set out to find some post-Labor Day inspiration in the form of street style pho-
tos, bloggers, and our ever-stylish Style Gallery community members. If you’re on 
the hunt for the perfect way to mix white into your wardrobe this fall, check out 
the looks below.29
This is the type of feature that ModCloth customers probably enjoy seeing.
Many start-ups also benefit from establishing a presence on social network-
ing sites like Facebook and Twitter. The total number of Facebook accounts is 
huge, which makes it particularly attractive. Facebook allows anyone in the 
world that is 13 years old or older to become a registered user. As of September 
2012, Facebook had more than one billion active users. The company has 
also made itself more attractive to businesses since launching a family of so-
cial plug-ins in April 2010. Social plug-ins are tools that websites can use to 
provide their users with personalized and social experiences. Facebook’s most 
popular social plug-ins, which a website can install, include the Like button, 
the Share button, and the Comments box. These social plug-ins allow people to 
share their experiences off Facebook with their friends on Facebook. The Share 
button, for example, lets users share pages from a company’s website on their 
Facebook page with one click.30 As a result, a young woman who just bought 
a dress from ModCloth’s website, because ModCloth has placed the Facebook 
Share plug-in on its site, can immediately post a picture and description of the 
dress on her Facebook page and write a comment about the purchase. She 
might say, “Hey everyone, look at the cool dress I just bought at www.modcloth.
com.” This is tantamount to free advertising for ModCloth.
Along with taking advantage of social plug-ins, businesses establish a 
presence on Facebook and Twitter to build a community around their products 
and services. The benefits include brand building, engaging customers, and 
getting lead generation and online sales. In regard to branding, a Facebook 
Social media is an 
 increasingly important 
part of the  marketing 
campaign of many 
start-up firms. This young 
entrepreneur is  placing 
videos of customers 
 talking about her products 
(i.e., reference accounts) 
on her Facebook page.

page or Twitter account can allow a firm to post or tweet material that’s con-
sistent with its brand. For example, Beyond Meat, a company that is produc-
ing plant-based substitutes for meat products, such as Chicken-Free Strips 
(which are made from plant-based proteins but taste just like traditional 
chicken strips), frequently posts material on Twitter that pertains to nutrition, 
cooking, healthy recipes, plant-based substitutes for meat products, and so 
on. By doing this, Beyond Meat establishes itself as an expert on healthy eat-
ing and healthy lifestyles.
In regard to engagement, many companies use social networks to strengthen 
their relationships with customers by soliciting feedback, running contests, or 
posting fun games that pertain to a company’s product. For example, ModCloth 
uses Twitter to do several things. First, the firm posts fun facts, polls, and even 
recipes that they think their customers will like. Second, they encourage ques-
tions from customers, and usually provide a response in a matter of minutes. 
Third, they post photos of the most popular ModCloth apparel and behind-the-
scenes photos of ModCloth employees, offices, and events. What they don’t do 
is overdo promotions. They keep their Twitter account upbeat, fun, and light. 
In terms of Facebook, ModCloth posts photos and comments about their prod-
ucts to spark conversations with customers. For example in late fall, as winter 
approaches, they might post a photo of warm-weather ModCloth apparel and 
accessories and ask, “What cold-weather accessories are the most important 
to you?” They’ll then engage with ModCloth followers, who send in comments 
just like any Facebook friend would do. ModCloth also makes effective use of 
Pinterest. Among other things, they post photos of their clothing matched up 
with accessories and shoes that they sell. It’s a great way to show customers 
how they can buy ModCloth products and mix and match to create multiple 
outfits and looks.
There is a potpourri of additional social media outlets from which firms 
can benefit. For example, many businesses post videos on YouTube. YouTube 
now offers heavy users the ability to create a YouTube channel to archive their 
videos and to create their own YouTube site. An example is GoPro’s YouTube 
channel at www.youtube.com/gopro. Businesses can also establish a presence 
on niche social networking sites that are consistent with their mission and 
product offerings. An example is Care2 (www.care2.com), which is an online 
community that promotes a healthy and green lifestyle and takes action on 
social causes.
Other Promotion-related activities  There are many other activities 
that help a firm promote and sell its products. Some firms, for example, give 
away free samples of their products. This technique is used by pharmaceutical 
companies that give physicians free samples to distribute to their patients as 
appropriate. A similar technique is to offer free trials, such as a three-month 
subscription to a magazine or a two-week membership to a fitness club, to try 
to hook potential customers by exposing them directly to the product or service.
A fairly new technique that has received quite a bit of attention is viral 
marketing, which facilitates and encourages people to pass along a market-
ing message about a particular product. The most well-known example of 
viral marketing is Hotmail. When Hotmail first started distributing free e-mail 
accounts, it put a tagline on every message sent out by Hotmail users that 
read “Get free e-mail with Hotmail.” Within less than a year, the company had 
several million users. Every e-mail message that passed through the Hotmail 
system was essentially an advertisement for Hotmail. The success of viral 
marketing depends on the pass-along rate from person to person. Very few 
companies have come close to matching Hotmail’s success with viral market-
ing. However, the idea of designing a promotional campaign that encourages 
a firm’s current customers to recommend its product to future customers is 
well worth considering.

408    PART 4 | MAnAgIng AnD gROWIng An EnTREPREnEuRIAL FIRM
A technique related to both viral marketing and creating buzz is guerrilla 
marketing. Guerrilla marketing is a low-budget approach to marketing that 
relies on ingenuity, cleverness, and surprise rather than traditional techniques. 
The point is to create awareness of a firm and its products, often in uncon-
ventional and memorable ways. The term was first coined and defined by Jay 
Conrad Levinson in the 1984 book Guerrilla Marketing. Guerrilla marketing is 
particularly suitable for entrepreneurial firms, which are often on a tight budget 
but have creativity, enthusiasm, and passion to draw from.
place (or Distribution)
Place, or distribution, encompasses all the activities that move a firm’s product 
from its place of origin to the consumer. A distribution channel is the route 
a product takes from the place it is made to the customer who is the end user.
The first choice a firm has to make regarding distribution is whether to sell 
its products directly to consumers or through intermediaries such as wholesal-
ers or distributors. Within most industries, both choices are available, so the 
decision typically depends on how a firm believes its target market wants to 
buy its product. For example, it would make sense for a music studio that is 
targeting the teen market to produce digital recordings and sell the recordings 
directly over the Web. Most teens have access to a computer or smartphone and 
know how to download music. In contrast, it wouldn’t make nearly as much 
sense for a recording company targeting retirees to use the same distribution 
channel to sell its music offerings. A much smaller percentage of the retiree 
market knows how to download music from the Web. In this instance, it would 
make more sense to produce CDs and partner with wholesalers or distributors 
to place them in retail outlets where retirees shop.
Figure 11.4 shows the difference between selling direct and selling through 
an intermediary. Let’s look at the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.
Selling Direct  Many firms sell directly to customers. Being able to con-
trol the process of moving their products from their place of origin to the end 
user instead of relying on third parties is a major advantage of direct selling. 
Examples of companies that sell direct are Abercrombie & Fitch, which sells 
its clothing through company-owned stores, and Fitbit, which sells its exercise 
and sleep monitoring device through its website.
The disadvantage of selling direct is that a firm has more of its capital tied 
up in fixed assets because it must own or rent retail outlets, must maintain a 
sales force, and/or must support an e-commerce website. It must also find its 
own buyers rather than have distributors that are constantly looking for new 
outlets for the firm’s products.
The advent of the Internet has changed how many companies sell their 
products. Many firms that once sold their products exclusively through retail 
stores are now also selling directly online. The process of eliminating layers of 
middlemen, such as distributors and wholesalers, to sell directly to customers 
is called disintermediation.

Selling Through intermediaries  Firms selling through intermediaries 
typically pass off their products to wholesalers or distributors that place them 
in retail outlets to be sold. An advantage of this approach is that the firm does 
not need to own as much of the distribution channel. For example, if a company 
makes car speakers and the speakers are sold through retail outlets such as 
Best Buy and Walmart, the company avoids the cost of building and maintain-
ing retail outlets. It can also rely on its wholesalers to manage its relationship 
with Best Buy and Walmart and to find other retail outlets in which to sell its 
products. The trick to utilizing this approach is to find wholesalers and distribu-
tors that will represent a firm’s products. A start-up must often pitch wholesal-
ers and distributors much like it pitches an investor for money in order to win 
their support and cooperation.
The disadvantage of selling through intermediaries is that a firm loses a 
certain amount of control of its product. Even if a wholesaler or distributor 
places a firm’s products with a top-notch retailer like Best Buy or Walmart, 
there is no guarantee that Best Buy’s or Walmart’s employees will talk up the 
firm’s products as much as they would if they were employees in the firm’s own 
stores. Selling via distributors and wholesalers can also be expensive, so it is 
best to carefully weigh all options. For example, a firm that sells an item for 
$100 on its website and makes $50 (after expenses) may only make $10 if the 
exact same item is placed by a distributor into a retail store. The $40 difference 
represents the profits taken by the distributor and the retailer.
Some firms enter into exclusive distribution arrangements with channel 
partners. Exclusive distribution arrangements give a retailer or other inter-
mediary the exclusive rights to sell a company’s products. The advantage to 
giving out an exclusive distribution agreement is to motivate a retailer or other 
intermediary to make a concerted effort to sell a firm’s products without hav-
ing to worry about direct competitors. For example, if Nokia granted AT&T the 
exclusive rights to sell a new type of cell phone, AT&T would be more motivated 
to advertise and push the phone than if many or all cell phone companies had 
access to the same phone.
One choice that entrepreneurs are confronted with when selling through 
intermediaries is how many channels to sell through. The more channels a 
firm sells through, the faster it can grow. But there are problems associated 
with selling through multiple channels, particularly early in the life of a firm. 
A firm can lose control of how its products are being sold. For example, the 
more retailers through which Ralph Lauren sells its clothing, the more likely 
it is that one or more retailers will not display the clothes in the manner the 
company wants.
sales process and related issues
A firm’s sales process depicts the steps it goes through to identify prospects 
and close sales. It doesn’t matter whether a firm is selling directly to customers 
or through intermediaries; it still has a process through which it makes sales. 
If it’s selling through an intermediary, like a distributor, it has to convince the 
distributor to carry its products and has to offer the distributor varying levels 
of support.
Some companies simply wing it when it comes to sales, which isn’t recom-
mended. It’s much better to have a well-thought-out approach to prospecting 
customers and closing sales. A formal sales process involves a number of iden-
tifiable steps. Although the process varies by firm (and industry), it generally 
includes seven steps, as shown in Figure 11.5. Following a formal or structured 
process to generate and close sales benefits a firm in two ways. First, it enables 
a firm to fine-tune its approach to sales and build uniformity into the process. 
Second, it helps a firm qualify leads, so the firm can spend its time and money 
learning ObjeCtive

pursuing the most likely buyers of its products or services. The most frustrat-
ing thing a salesperson encounters is spending time and effort working with a 
potential buyer, only to find that the buyer doesn’t have the money or the au-
thority to make a purchase. A well-thought-out sales process has triggers in it 
that help a salesperson discern whether spending time with a particular pros-
pect is a good use of his or her time.
Some firms implement their sales strategy by listing the seven steps in the 
process, and then writing procedures for how each step will be implemented. 
In fact, some new ventures include this material in their business plan, to 
provide the reader confidence that they’ve thought through how they’ll close 
sales. An example of a sales process, with accompanying action steps, for a 
fictitious business named Prime Adult Fitness is shown in Table 11.5. The ex-
ample comes from the book Preparing Effective Business Plans, Second Edition, 
by Bruce R. Barringer (co-author of this book). Prime Adult Fitness is a fitness 
center for people 50 years old or older. Its mission is to make exercise and 
fitness a vibrant and satisfying part of the lives of people who are 50 years 
old and older. The company will start with a single fitness center located in 
Oviedo, Florida, a suburb of Orlando. The steps shown in Table 11.5 outline 
the process the company will use to recruit members and is the method that 
the in-house staff will follow when people walk into the center and inquire 
about membership. At times the process will take weeks to unfold, for example 
if Prime Adult Fitness employees have multiple contacts with a prospect, and 
at times the process will take only a few minutes, such as when an employee 
provides a prospect a tour of the facility and answers specific questions. Prime 
Adult’s sales process is offered only as an example. Individual firms can use 
this example as a template for developing a sales process that fits their indi-
vidual products and circumstances.

Mapping the sales process in the manner shown in Table 11.5 provides a 
standard method for a firm’s employees to use, and provides a starting point for 
careful analysis and continuous improvement. Often, when companies lose an 
important sale and reflect on what went wrong, they’ll find that an important 
step in the sales process was missed or mishandled. This is where having a 
 well-thought-out sales process, with accompanying action steps and appropri-
ate employee training, can dramatically improve a company’s sales performance.

Chapter Summary
the firm offers in the market it has cho-
sen to serve. Technically, a product is 
something the firm sells that takes on a 
physical form, while a service is an ac-
tivity or a benefit the firm provides that 
does not take on a physical form. The 
most important attribute of the product a 
firm sells is its ability to create value for 
customers. Price is the amount of money 
customers are willing to pay to purchase 
a product. Typically, entrepreneurs use 
one of two methods to set the price of their 
product. With cost-based pricing, the list 
price for a product is determined by add-
ing a markup percentage to the product’s 
cost. When using value-based pricing, the 
firm determines the price of its product 
by estimating what consumers are willing 
to pay for a product and then backing off 
a bit to provide a cushion. Promotion is 
concerned with the actions the firm takes 
to communicate the value its product 
creates to customers. Several actions are 
taken to do this. Advertising, for example, 
is an action taken to make people aware 
of a good or service the firm hopes to per-
suade customers to buy. Public relations 
refers to efforts to establish and maintain 
a company’s image with the public. The 
major difference between the two is that 
advertising is paid for and public rela-
tions isn’t—at least directly. The cost of 
public relations to a firm is the effort it 
makes to network with journalists and 
other people to try to interest them in say-
ing and/or writing good things about the 
company. Social media consists primarily 
of blogging and establishing a presence 
and connecting with people through so-
cial networking sites like Facebook and 
Twitter. Businesses blog and engage in 
social media to build a community around 
their products and services. The benefits 
include brand building, engaging custom-
ers, and getting lead generation and on-
line sales.
The first choice a firm makes regard-
ing place or distribution is whether to 
sell its products directly to consumers or 
through  intermediaries (e.g., wholesalers 
and retailers). An advantage of selling 
direct is that it allows a firm to maintain 
control of its products rather than rely-
ing on third parties. The disadvantage is 
 lO1. The first step in selecting a target market 
is to study the industry in which the firm 
intends to compete and determine the dif-
ferent potential target markets within that 
industry. This process is called market 
segmentation. Markets can be segmented 
in a number of ways, including product 
type, price point, distribution channels 
used, and customers served.
After markets are segmented, the firm 
selects its target market, or the group it 
intends to serve. The next step is to estab-
lish a unique position in that market—one 
that differentiates the entrepreneurial firm 
from its competitors. The term position 
was introduced in Chapter 5, where it was 
emphasized that a firm’s position in the 
marketplace determines how it is situated 
relative to its competitors. From a market-
ing perspective, this translates into the im-
age of the way a firm wants to be perceived 
by its customers. Importantly, position an-
swers the question, “Why should someone 
in our target market buy our good or ser-
vice instead of our competitor’s?”
Also important to these three steps 
is the development of a product attribute 
map, which illustrates a firm’s position in 
its industry relative to its major rivals. It is 
used as a visual illustration of a firm’s po-
sitioning strategy and helps a firm develop 
its marketing plan.
 lO2. A company’s brand is the set of attributes 
people associate with it. When positive 
and effective, a brand can create loyal cus-
tomers for the entrepreneurial firm. On a 
philosophical level, a firm builds a brand 
by having it create meaning in custom-
ers’ lives. It must create value. On a more 
practical level, brands are built through 
advertising, public relations, sponsorships, 
supporting social causes, and good perfor-
mance. Creating a strong and identifiable 
personality for the firm is a key to effec-
tively developing a strong brand.
 lO3. A firm’s marketing mix is the set of con-
trollable, tactical marketing tools that it 
uses to produce the response it wants in 
its target market. Most marketers orga-
nize their marketing mix around the 4Ps: 
product, price, promotion, and place (or 
distribution). In the context of the mar-
keting mix, a product is a good or service

the manufacturer would if it had its own 
stores.
 lO4. A firm’s sales process depicts the steps it 
goes through to identify leads and close 
sales. The seven-step sales process includes 
the following steps: Step 1: Prospect for (or 
gather) sales leads; Step 2: Make the initial 
contact; Step 3: Qualify the lead; Step 4: 
Make the sales presentation; Step 5: Meet 
objections and concerns; Step 6: Close the 
sale; and Step 7: Follow up.
that it ties up more capital in fixed as-
sets because the firm must own (or rent) 
retail outlets or must field a sales force 
to sell its products. An advantage of sell-
ing through intermediaries is that a firm 
doesn’t have to own much of its distri-
bution channel (e.g., trucks and retail 
outlets). A disadvantage of this approach 
is that a firm loses some control of its 
product, in that there is no guarantee 
that the retailers it sells through will talk 
up and push its products as much as

Business idea: Create a product for music fans that 
packages a CD with a fan magazine and other memorabilia 
tied to the musician, such as posters, guitar picks, and 
even branded greeting cards and perfume samples.
pitch: Passionate music fans want more than music. 
They want to connect with their favorite musicians 
in deeper ways. Attending a concert achieves that; 
however, concerts are not only expensive but also few 
and far between. Many people who are Katy Perry fans, 
for instance, want to know more about her but may 
never attend a Katy Perry concert. ZinePak was created 
for this reason. The company creates custom, interactive 
content for super fans of music, movies, sports, events, 
and brands. The content is delivered through ZinePaks, 
which are physical, limited-edition packets that, when 
opened, emulate the super-satisfying feeling of opening 
a new album or a favorite magazine. Each ZinePak pairs 
a small-format magazine with exclusive merchandise 
such as posters, magnets, patches, stickers, guitar 
picks, and other memorabilia into a package. The 
magazine contains exclusive photos, interviews, games, 
and behind-the-scenes stories about the subject of the 
ZinePak. The merchandise is designed to be collectable, 
special, and fun.
ZinePak was created by Brittany hodak, who has a 
background in music, and Kim Kaupe, who has a back-
ground in publishing. ZinePak’s first distributor was 
Walmart, which was looking for ways to combat sinking 
in-store CD sales due to piracy and online downloads. 
The idea is to enhance audience engagement. Katy 
Perry fans will presumably be more inclined to buy a 
Katy Perry CD, rather than purchase her music online 
or steal it, if the CD is accompanied by the material 
that’s included in a ZinePak. In this respect, ZinePak 
combats the decline of physical CD sales. ZinePaks are 
also prepared for athletes, movies, brands, and special 
events. For example, ZinePak’s second project was to 
put together a ZinePak for the 2012 Academy of Country 
Music Awards. That particular ZinePak involved putting 
together a CD featuring all the major acts expected to 
get awards and an assortment of memorabilia for the 
performers featured at the show.
Since ZinePak launched in 2011, it has sold more than 
two million ZinePaks. Its clients have included KIDZ 
BOP, Justin Bieber, Taylor Swift, KISS, Dove, Dr. Pepper, 
Selena gomez, and Toby Keith. In fall 2014, Disney re-
leased a ZinePak of the popular Disney film Frozen. The 
ZinePak included a 10-track CD with music from the 
movie and a 64-page magazine with games, puzzles, 
comics, and interviews, plus an assortment of memora-
bilia including collectible stickers, a poster, and a holi-
day ornament. According to Walmart, the limited-edition 
ZinePak was available only through Walmart while sup-
plies lasted.

questions would you ask the firm’s founders before 
making your funding decision? What answers would

Business idea: Create the world’s first rolling cooler 
with a built-in blender, Bluetooth speakers, tie-down 
straps (to carry items on top of the cooler), LED lights, 
oversized tires (great for sandy beaches), built-in uSB 
charger, built-in bottle opener, and built-in storage.
pitch: The basic design for coolers hasn’t changed 
in 50 years. Most coolers are boring, break easily, are 
a hassle to move around, and are only good for one 
thing—keeping food and drinks cool. The COOLEST 
changed all that. Created by Portland-based product 
designer Ryan grepper, the COOLEST is a complete 
redesign of what a cooler can be. First, it has an 18-
volt rechargeable blender. Most coolers already have 
ice and beverages, so why not blend them up for a 
tasty smoothie or another drink? next, it comes with 
a removable Bluetooth speaker that connects to any 
smartphone to wirelessly stream music from up to 30 
feet away (eight hours on one charge). Also included 
is a waterproof uSB charger, perfect for recharging an 
iPhone or similar device. At nightfall, the COOLEST’s 
LED lights, embedded in the lid, make looking for a drink 
easy. Particularly nice are three additional features. It has 
tie-down straps to help carry gear on top of the cooler, 
such as lawn chairs or yard toys. It has built-in storage 
for picnicking or tailgating essentials, like plastic plates, 
a cutting board, and a rustproof ceramic knife. Finally, 
the tires are a dream. Regular cooler tires leave much to 
be desired and sink into the sand. The COOLEST’s tires 
are oversized and perfect for sandy beaches. All in all,

introduction
ModCloth founders Susan Koger and Eric Koger met in 
high school. Susan enjoyed shopping for vintage cloth-
ing, and over time she accumulated so many outfits that 
she decided to sell some. Eric, who was her boyfriend at 
the time, offered to build a website she could use to sell 
the clothes online. Susan saw this as a way to help pay 
for college. This initial experience was the foundation for 
ModCloth’s birth.
Susan and Eric both attended Carnegie Mellon in 
Pittsburgh. ModCloth was a hobby business the first 
four years. Susan continued to accumulate women’s 
vintage clothing, sell the items on her website, and ship 
orders from her dorm room. The “customer care” num-
ber on the website and boxes was her cell phone num-
ber. After graduating in 2006, Susan decided to focus 
on ModCloth full time. Eric remained at Carnegie Mellon 
an extra year to earn an MBA. To make ModCloth a full-
time pursuit, Susan broadened her thinking. up until this 
point, the only clothes that ModCloth sold were vintage 
clothing that Susan picked out. She started attending 
trade shows to make contact with independent design-
ers who designed and made vintage-inspired clothing, 
which is a much larger market than vintage clothing. She 
knew that to appreciably grow ModCloth, she’d have 
to move beyond the small vintage clothing niche and 
broaden her product line.
To make sure she was on the right track, Susan 
surveyed 100 of her customers to ask if they’d buy 
vintage-inspired clothing from ModCloth, along with the 
vintage clothing the company carried. A total of 95 out 
of 100 customers surveyed said they would. Armed with 
this information, Susan approached two of her uncles 
and raised $20,000 in seed funding to buy inventory. 
She could now expand ModCloth’s product offerings 
to include both vintage clothing and vintage-inspired 
clothing.
Fast-forward to the present. In the eight years fol-
lowing Susan’s ability to raise equity funding from her 
uncles, ModCloth has grown to a 500-person company. 
In 2012, it had $100 million in revenue and experienced 
40 percent year-over-year growth. It has raised six 
rounds of funding totaling $63.7 million. Although it fo-
cuses exclusively on vintage and vintage-inspired cloth-
ing, its product offerings are deep. It currently offers 
over 7,500 designs from 1,200 designers.
A large part of ModCloth’s success is attributed to 
its marketing program. Although it’s strictly an online 
retailer, the 4Ps—product, price, promotion, and place 
(distribution)—have played an integral role in its suc-
cess. The following is a discussion of ModCloth’s 4Ps. 
The discussion highlights elements of the 4Ps that have 
contributed to ModCloth’s success and illustrates future 
challenges for the firm.
product
ModCloth offers a full range of vintage and vintage- 
inspired apparel products for women, including 
dresses, tops, bottoms, outerwear, swimwear, and in-
timates. It also sells shoes and accessories. It sources 
its products from both small designers that create 
vintage clothing and larger companies, such as BB 
Dakota, that make vintage-inspired clothing. As a re-
sult, its site is populated by a vast assortment of indie

get outdoors. It is a portable party that is likely to appeal 
to many groups. It’s aesthetically pleasing to boot.
To manufacture the COOLEST, grepper has lined up 
a world-class contract manufacturer that has years of 
experience with top-shelf products. The COOLEST has 
a 60-quart insulating capacity and is available in several 
colors. It also has split slides, so ice can be put into one 
side and drinks and sandwiches into the other. no more 
soggy sandwiches with the COOLEST.
The COOLEST has generated considerable buzz via its 
Kickstarter campaign. The campaign ran in the summer 
of 2014 (savvy timing for an “outdoors” product), and 
raised $13,285,226 from 62,642 backers, making it 
the most successful Kickstarter campaign (in terms of 
money raised) of all time. The Pebble e-watch held the 
previous record with $10.23 million pledged.

questions would you ask the firm’s founders before 
making your funding decision? What answers would 
satisfy you?

site, would you fund this company? Why or why not?

helps ModCloth build an emotional connection with its 
customers. It also helps it stay fresh and feature items 
that customers want and will buy. Interestingly, prod-
ucts chosen through the “Be the Buyer” program sell 
twice as much as similar products. The lifetime spend 
of “Be the Buyer” customers is three times that of other 
ModCloth patrons.
price
It’s not exactly known how ModCloth arrives at the price 
for its products. Products are priced competitively with 
brick-and-mortar retailers such as Macy’s and Dillard’s. 
As we discuss next, the company offers frequent dis-
counts and promotions. The discounts and promotions 
are typically not visible on ModCloth’s website. Instead, 
they’re offered through the company’s blog and social 
media initiatives.
promotions
ModCloth does not emphasize print and media advertis-
ing. Instead, its promotional efforts are geared toward 
engaging current and prospective customers through its 
blog, social media, and similar marketing techniques.
ModCloth maintains an active blog, which contains 
new posts every day. To keep readers coming back, the 
blog features contests that provide cash prizes and/
or features customers wearing ModCloth products. By 
logging onto the blog (http://blog.modcloth.com) you 
can get a sense of the types of contests that are run. 
The blog also provides product updates, along with a 
behind-the-scenes glimpse of what it’s like to work at 
ModCloth. For example, as mentioned earlier in this 
chapter, employees are allowed to bring their dogs (af-
fectionately called ModDogs) to work. Periodically, one 
of the dogs is prominently featured on the blog.
The company is also active on social networks. It 
has three Twitter accounts. The name, purpose, and 
number of followers for each account are shown next.
designs and one-of-a-kind items as well as larger lots 
of vintage-inspired clothing. Its target market is 18- to 
32-year-old women. Its clothing has been featured in 
fashion magazines such as Cosmopolitan, glamour, 
InStyle, and Seventeen. A quick perusal of ModCloth’s 
website is the best way to see the fun and unique 
nature of its products. Each product comes with a 
descriptive yet somewhat quirky name, along with a 
colorful description, which adds to the ModCloth shop-
ping experience. A sample of the names of dresses 
recently for sale on ModCloth’s website is shown next. 
When you look at the dresses and their names, you 
can see the connection. This is part of ModCloth’s ef-
forts to make its shopping experience interesting, en-
gaging, novel, and fun.

Along with its unique products, ModCloth has a 
twist to its approach that encourages customer par-
ticipation in regard to the products that are offered for 
sale. Its “Be the Buyer” program allows customers to 
be virtual members of its buying team and invites them 
to vote on potential clothing designs. ModCloth show-
cases prospective clothing designs on its site, under 
the “Be the Buyer” tab, and asks customers to either 
“Pick It” or “Skip It,” which indicates whether they 
think ModCloth should carry that item. If a design gets 
enough votes, the style will be carried by ModCloth, and 
those that voted for the item will be notified by e-mail. 
This approach, which is referred to as crowdsourcing,

photo shoot on its website and across its social media 
platforms. Plus, each month, one person would receive 
a full spotlight on its website. The company also runs

recently moved its headquarters from Pittsburgh to San 
Francisco. Approximately 70 percent of the clothing that 
ModCloth sells is sourced from companies in California, 
so the move to San Francisco was motivated to place 
ModCloth’s headquarters closer to its suppliers.
Challenges ahead
ModCloth has several challenges. The first is to maintain 
its momentum. It’s not known how large the market is 
for vintage and vintage-inspired women’s clothing. So, 
while the firm has succeeded in its niche, at some point 
ModCloth may have to move beyond its niche to main-
tain growth. Maintaining the uniqueness of its social me-
dia initiatives is a second challenge. The risk here is that 
while ModCloth is now seen as cutting-edge in regard 
to social media, its competitors may catch up, and its 
social media efforts may no longer be seen as “special,” 
as is currently the case. A third challenge is to satisfy 
its investors. As mentioned earlier, ModCloth has raised 
$63.7 million in investment capital. Its investors will want 
to see ModCloth grow quickly and run up its valuation to 
justify the investment.
On the positive front, observers give ModCloth high 
marks for its distinct positioning and for how it engages 
its customers. The emotional connection it has created 
between itself and its customers will make it difficult for 
copycats to make substantial inroads in its vintage and 
vintage-inspired clothing niche.
Discussion Questions
 11-34. In a short paragraph, describe ModCloth’s brand. 
What are the strengths and weaknesses of this 
firm’s brand?
 11-35. What is the difference between ModCloth’s core 
product and its actual product? Describe its 
 actual product and your assessment of whether 
the actual product provides an attractive mix of 
characteristics.
 11-36. In what ways, if any, do you think ModCloth will 
look different five years from now?
 11-37. Follow ModCloth’s primary Twitter account (@
ModCloth) for five days. Write a short summary of 
how ModCloth uses Twitter to engage its customers 
and promote its products. On a scale of 1 to 10 (10 
is high), how effectively does ModCloth use Twitter 
as a promotional tool?

contests that are promoted across its social media 
sites. For example, in the summer of 2014, ModCloth 
ran a contest asking customers to upload a photo of 
themselves in a summer outfit. Along with the photo, 
the entrant was asked to submit a 100-word explana-
tion of why the outfit was perfect for summer adven-
tures. At the end of the submission period, ModCloth 
chose a winner and a runner-up. The winner received a 
$200 ModCloth gift card and prize pack. The runner-up 
received a $75 gift card. Of course, both were also rec-
ognized on ModCloth’s website.
ModCloth is also active on Facebook and has 
over 1.1 million Facebook likes. Several times a day, 
ModCloth and its friends post fashion information, 
fun facts, and a variety of related information on its 
Facebook wall. hundreds of pictures of custom-
ers wearing ModCloth clothing are also posted. The 
ModDogs, referred to previously, have their own 
Facebook page. Simply go to ModDogs (4,564 likes) 
on Facebook and you’ll see what they’re up to at 
ModCloth’s headquarters.
ModCloth has other techniques for engaging cus-
tomers. For example, the company employs fashion 
experts, called ModStylists, that customers can en-
gage via e-mail, chat, or phone. The ModStylists give 
advice, answer questions, and interact with customers 
regarding fashion-related issues. ModCloth also has a 
YouTube channel (http://www.youtube.com/modcloth) 
and regularly posts new content.
place (or Distribution)
ModCloth does not utilize drop shipping or outsource 
any of its distribution. Instead, products that are made 
for ModCloth are shipped to the firm’s distribution cen-
ter in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Its Internet orders are 
fulfilled from this center. In 2013, the company shipped 
1,639,275 orders from its distribution center. Its single-
day record is 16,268 orders.
ModCloth employs buyers who scour the 
world for the most interesting and cost-competitive 
 vintage-inspired clothing. Once an article of clothing 
is  selected, it’s photographed, and a description of 
the article is written by ModCloth’s creative staff. The 
creative staff also maintains the company’s blog and 
social network initiatives. ModCloth’s IT infrastructure, 
which enables it to fulfill orders expediently, was built 
entirely in-house and is maintained by ModCloth IT 
specialists. It’s built on a Ruby on Rails platform. Ruby 
on Rails platforms tend to attract the most progressive 
IT specialists.
ModCloth’s recent rounds of funding are being 
used to scale the firm’s operations. It has plans to build 
a new supply chain operation in Los Angeles. It also

introduction
In 1995, two dermatologists, Dr. Katie Rodan and 
Dr. Kathy Fields, developed what they believed was 
a medical breakthrough in fighting acne. Their mis-
sion: to help millions of people rid themselves of acne 
and acne-related problems. They named their product 
Proactiv Solutions. This name was chosen because the 
product could heal existing blemishes and proactively 
help prevent new ones from forming.
Today, Proactiv is the number-one-selling acne 
product in the united States. It’s a three-part acne 
treatment kit that includes a cleanser, toner, and treat-
ment. It’s not sold in stores. Instead, it is sold via info-
mercials, the company’s website, a subscription service 
called the “Proactiv Solution Clear Skin Club,” and in 
select upscale boutiques and kiosks. The way Proactiv 
reached the point it currently occupies is an interesting 
story. Early in its life, Proactiv was shaped by three criti-
cal marketing decisions, from which the company has 
not wavered, even to this day. This case recounts these 
decisions and discusses how the decisions shaped this 
entrepreneurial venture’s future.
How it Started
Katie Rodan and Kathy Fields met while they were 
working summer jobs at a cardiovascular research lab 
in Los Angeles. The lab was developing a drug to treat 
post–heart attack patients. Both Rodan and Fields 
enjoyed the exciting pace of the work as well as the 
camaraderie they shared with the lab’s researchers and 
doctors. After earning their college degrees, they both 
went to medical school and became dermatologists. 
They stayed in touch and often shared with one another 
how surprised they were at the number of acne patients 
they were seeing. At the time, the medical research 
said that only 3 percent of the adult population had 
acne, but Rodan and Fields became convinced that 
the  number was higher. They were each seeing acne 
patients on a daily basis, and they weren’t just seeing 
teenagers. They were seeing women in their 20s, 30s, 
40s, and even in their 50s who were suffering from acne 
and acne-related problems.
Rodan and Fields decided to form a partnership 
to investigate the acne issue further. They started by 
talking to their patients, asking them a wide range of 
acne-related questions. What they found was that the 
vast majority of their patients hated the acne products 
on the market. The most common complaints were 
that the products were very drying and they were very 
 irritating. Worst of all, patients told Rodan and Fields, 
the available products did not work. At this point, the 
two physicians started thinking there might be an op-
portunity for them to create a better product.
Rodan and Fields spent the next couple of years 
thoroughly investigating the acne products on the mar-
ket. After testing many of the products on their patients, 
they made what they believed was a shocking discovery. 
All of the products on the market were designed to spot-
treat a pimple—none were designed to stop the pimple 
from forming in the first place. This just didn’t make 
sense to the two dermatologists—from both a practical 
and a medical standpoint. By the time you see a pimple, 
whatever treatment you administer, it’s too little too late. 
In their judgment, not taking steps to prevent acne from 
developing was akin to not brushing your teeth and in-
stead just going to the dentist to fill cavities. Why not 
brush your teeth and floss and try to prevent the cavities 
from developing in the first place?
This revelation motivated Rodan and Fields to start 
working on a product of their own—one that would be 
more proactive in preventing acne and acne-related 
problems. They hired a chemist, and the three worked 
together for another couple of years. Finally, they had a 
product they were happy with and that seemed to work 
and to satisfy their patients.
important revelations
To get ideas about how to market and develop their 
product, which didn’t have a name yet, Rodan hosted 
dinner parties at her house and conducted brainstorm-
ing sessions with the guests. The guests included 
business executives, market researchers, marketing 
consultants, an FDA regulatory attorney, the chief fi-
nancial officer of a major company, and others. One of 
the things the participants in these sessions stressed to 
Rodan and Fields was the importance of marketing re-
search. In particular, the group urged Rodan and Fields 
to hire an unbiased third party to validate their findings. 
Rodan and Fields took this advice to heart and hired an 
outside consultant. In focus groups that the consultant 
led, Rodan and Fields learned two important things 
about older women. First, evidence suggests that many

up on raising capital, Rodan and Fields approached 
neutrogena to try to get a licensing deal. neutrogena 
passed on the deal but did make a suggestion that 
resonated with Rodan and Fields. neutrogena said that 
the most effective way to sell the product would be via 
infomercials. Initially, Rodan and Fields were shocked, 
because they had a fairly low opinion of infomercials. 
But there was one company, according to people at 
neutrogena, named guthy-Renker, that made high-qual-
ity infomercials for professional products like Proactiv. 
Rodan and Fields also got to thinking that an infomercial 
might be the best way to educate people about their 
product. The following list lays out the points in favor of 
using infomercials to sell a product in which Rodan and 
Fields had a great deal of confidence.
why infomercials Have worked for proactiv 
(infomercials are 30–60 Minute programs that 
are paid for by an advertiser)
■ People need to be reeducated about how to treat 
acne.
■ The reeducation can’t be done in a 30-second 
or 60-second television commercial, or in a 
print ad.
■ Acne is an embarrassing problem, so people will 
be most open to learning about it in the privacy 
of their homes.
■ The demographic group that spends the most 
time watching infomercials, women in their 20s, 
30s, and 40s, are Proactiv’s market.
■ Infomercials provide Proactiv the opportunity to 
show heartfelt testimonials of people who have 
used the product. Showing “before” and “after” 
pictures of people who have used the product 
and have experienced dramatic results has been 
a particularly persuasive tactic.
guthy-renker
After being turned down by neutrogena, Rodan and 
Fields were about ready to throw in the towel when they 
met, simply by chance, a person who introduced them 
to guthy-Renker, the infomercial company that people 
at neutrogena recommended highly. After several meet-
ings, guthy-Renker offered to license Proactiv and to 
create an infomercial to sell the product. It also put up 
the money to buy the media time needed for the infomer-
cial to be televised. The initial infomercial was targeted 
toward women in the age group most ignored by the 
present providers of acne products. The 30-minute spot 
carefully explained what acne is, how it can affect older 
women, and how Proactiv was the only product available 
that potentially prevented acne from occurring. It also 
offered a complete money-back guarantee. The first in-
fomercial sold twice as much Proactiv as expected, and 
guthy-Renker and Proactiv remain close partners today.
It was also guthy-Renker’s idea to get celebrity en-
dorsements for Proactiv. The first celebrity endorser was 
Judith Light. Light was followed by Vanessa Williams, 
and now a number of other celebrities endorse the 
product.
women who do have acne as a medical condition re-
fuse to believe that such is the case. Second, people 
don’t like to talk about their acne with others. Rodan 
and Fields also learned that their product still needed 
work. There were several aspects of the product that 
needed improvement, a need that Rodan and Fields 
fully intended to take care of.
three Critical Marketing Decisions that Shaped 
the future of the firm
Critical Marketing Decision 1: We’re a Skin Care 
Company
After Rodan and Fields reformulated the product again, 
they hired another marketing consultant to advise them 
as to how they should proceed to successfully market 
their product. The first piece of advice they got from the 
consultant was to think of their product as a skin care 
product rather than an acne product. At the time, the 
acne market in the united States was about $250 million 
a year, a low number by consumer products standards. 
In contrast, the skin care market was several billion 
dollars a year, making it much more attractive. The con-
sultant told Rodan and Fields to think of their product 
as a skin care system that just happens to treat acne, 
rather than an acne medication alone. This recommen-
dation obviously caused Rodan and Fields to have a 
much broader vision for the scope of the market for their 
product.
Critical Marketing Decision 2: Our name Is Proactiv
After Rodan and Fields started thinking of their product 
as part of the skin care market, they got advice from a 
marketing specialist about what to name their product. 
The name the specialist recommended was Proactiv 
(proactive without the e). Looking back, Rodan and 
Fields admit that initially they didn’t get the reason for 
this recommendation. They were hoping for a more 
cosmetic-sounding name, like Dermo-Beautiful. The 
name Proactiv turned out to be perfect. It captured 
the essence of what Rodan and Fields were trying to 
 accomplish—to create a product that would be pro-
active (rather than reactive) in dealing with acne and 
acne-related issues. In other words, the name Proactiv 
captured the entrepreneurs’ interest in signaling to 
customers that their product was intended to prevent 
the occurrence of additional acne-related problems 
for them.
Critical Marketing Decision 3: Infomercials
To get their product on the market, Rodan and Fields 
initially tried to raise investment capital. They were 
repeatedly turned down. The biggest objection they 
encountered was the sentiment that if their product 
was so good and so obvious, why hadn’t Procter & 
gamble or Johnson & Johnson already thought of it? 
“Surely those companies must have dermatologists on 
their advisory boards telling them what to do,” was the 
comment repeatedly expressed to Rodan and Fields as 
they talked to those with investment capital. After giving

 11-39. Discuss the things that Rodan and Fields learned, 
prior to meeting guthy-Renker, that persuaded them 
that infomercials were the best way to sell Proactiv. If 
Proactiv hadn’t developed infomercials in partnership 
with guthy-Renker, do you think Proactiv would be 
in existence today? Why were infomercials a better 
choice than print or media advertising for Proactiv 
when the company was first being introduced?
 11-40. Describe Proactiv’s positioning strategy. To what 
extent did the three critical marketing decisions 
discussed in the case shape the evolution of 
Proactiv’s positioning strategy?
 11-41. What is the difference between Proactiv’s core 
product and its actual product? Describe its 
 actual product and your assessment of whether 
the actual product provides an attractive mix of 
characteristics.

proactiv today
Today, Proactiv is strong. The first guthy-Renker 
 infomercial ran in 1994, and the product has steadily 
gained market share since. The company now sells 
acne treatment in several varieties, including gentle 
Formula, Extra Strength, and Proactiv+. Face masks, 
body washes, and other skin-care products are also 
sold under the Proactiv name. Proactive products are 
now being sold worldwide. Proactiv’s marketing strat-
egy has not substantially changed since the company 
started. The three marketing decisions described in this 
case set the direction for the company, and the com-
pany remains fully committed to taking only the actions 
suggested by these decisions.

Getting  
Personal with dripcatch

425
I
n 2010, Alexandra Abraham was working for a catering service. One day, while 
working a job at the Salish Lodge & Spa in Seattle, she slipped on a wet floor and 
nearly fell to the ground. Although an unsettling experience, it got her thinking. 
There are often wet spots on the floors of hotel and restaurant kitch-
ens. The main culprit is water that drips from glass-drying racks. 
Commercial kitchens have square racks that dirty glasses are placed 
into. The racks are run through a dishwasher, which both washes 
and dries the glasses. When a rack comes out, some of the glasses 
typically aren’t completely dried. When the rack is moved, water 
drips to the floor. Abraham knew that the number one cause of in-
jury in commercial kitchens is falling. She went to her manager and 
asked if there was a way to catch the excess water before it fell to 
the floor. The response she got was if she could figure out a way to 
do it, the catering service would be her first customer.
That experience set Abraham on a mission—to design a product 
that would catch water dripping from glasses in glass-drying racks. 
She put together some preliminary drawings. Her idea was to cre-
ate a basin or tray that snaps below glass and dishwasher racks to 
catch water that might otherwise drip to the floor. Along with water 
that is still on glasses when they come out of the dishwasher, water 
is also spilled when servers fill water glasses before they are placed 
on tables. If glasses were left in a rack, with Abraham’s tray below, 
there wouldn’t be a possibility of spilling water at any point in the 
process. Errant water would be caught by the rack. Abraham showed her drawings 
around some and got positive feedback. She knew she’d need CAD drawings done 
if she wanted to show the concept to potential manufacturers and buyers, so she e-
mailed the engineering department at Seattle University asking for help. It turned out 
that there were plenty of students looking for practical experience and she got CAD 
drawings developed for her concept.
The next step was to see if there was genuine interest for her product in the 
restaurant industry. Abraham took a chance and sent a blind e-mail to Tom Douglas, 
one of Seattle’s most well-known chefs, asking him to review and endorse her in-
vention. The subject line of the e-mail read “College student seeking Mr. Douglas’s

help.” In two days she had an appointment with Douglas, and showed him an early 
prototype. She explained to him that DripCatch, the name she gave her product, 
was a simple device that collects water from glass-drying racks commonly used in 
restaurants. It prevents slips and falls caused by dripping water. She remembers 
asking him “What do you think?” “He just shook my hand and said, ‘Congratulations, 
what do you want from me?’”1 What Abraham wanted was an endorsement, which 
Douglas provided. There has since been an image of Douglas on DripCatch’s web-
site, with a quote that reads:
“It’s great to find a product that makes you smack your head and go ‘Perfect! That’s 
just what we need! It keeps our floors drier, our employees and customers safer, the 
restaurant cleaner and me happier … win, win, win!”2
now that Abraham knew she was on to something, building a company and protect-
ing her intellectual property became a key pursuit. She started by making another 
cold call, this time to Seattle area entrepreneur Tom Burns. Burns, a long-time Boeing 
executive, quit his job and became an entrepreneur after he invented a series of small 
sticks that plug the holes in hot beverage lids, thus eliminating spilling and keeping the 
beverages hot longer. Burns’s company, StixTogo (https://stixtogo.com), has placed 
its product in more than 30,000 coffee shops, restaurants, and convenience stores 
worldwide. Abraham connected with Burns, who provided her assistance in filing a 
provisional patent application on the DripCatch device. Abraham retained a patent 
agent to file for a utility patent. The patent agent was assisted by an attorney, who also 
helped Abraham trademark the DripCatch name. The utility patent application is cur-
rently pending. Trademarks can be viewed at the U.S. Patent and Trademark’s website 
at www.uspto.gov. Simply go to the website, select trademarks, and place the name 
of the mark in the search bar. DripCatch’s trademark can be viewed at http://tmsearch.
uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&state=4803:nlrmr.2.1.
While waiting for the utility patent to be granted, Abraham has been busy making 
and marketing her product. She found a local contract manufacturer—Woodinville’s 
Cashmere Molding—to produce the DripCatch tray for less than she could produce 
them overseas. She signed an agreement with a restaurant-equipment distributor, 
which is now selling the DripCatch device. She is currently looking for an affiliation with 
a distributor that has a national reach and representatives in every major city calling on 
restaurants, hotels, and institutions such as hospitals and schools that could benefit by 
using DripCatch trays in their kitchens. She is also looking for a manufacturer who has 
a major presence in her industry.
While the DripCatch device is gaining sales, Abraham says that her exit strategy is 
probably licensing or a buyout option. “We’re more of a product than a company,” she 
acknowledges.3 In terms of overall potential, Abraham sees the sky as the limit. The 
problem her DripCatch device solves is a problem that exists in every commercial and 
industrial kitchen in the world. Once granted, her patent will give her exclusive rights to 
DripCatch’s approach to solving the problem.

any entrepreneurial firms have valuable intellectual property. In fact, 
virtually all businesses, including start-ups, have knowledge, informa-
tion, and ideas that are critical to their success.
For at least three reasons, it is important for businesses to recognize what 
intellectual property is and how to protect it. First, the intellectual property of 

CHAPTER 12 | THE IMPORTAnCE OF Intellectual PROPERTy    427
a business often represents its most valuable asset.4 Think of the value of the 
Facebook and Google trademarks, the Nike “swoosh” logo, or the design of the 
Apple iPhone. All of these are examples of intellectual property, and because 
of intellectual property laws, they are the exclusive properties of the firms that 
own them. Second, it is important to understand what intellectual property is 
and how to protect it to avoid unintentional violations of intellectual property 
laws. For example, imagine the hardship facing an entrepreneurial start-up if 
it selected a name for its business, heavily advertised that name, and was later 
forced to change the name because it was infringing on a trademark. Finally, in-
tellectual property can be licensed or sold, providing valuable licensing income. 
This is what Alexandra Abraham may ultimately do with her DripCatch product.
We begin this chapter by defining intellectual property and exploring when 
intellectual property protection is warranted. There are costs involved with 
legally protecting intellectual property, and the costs sometimes outweigh the 
benefits, at least in the short term. We then describe the four key forms of in-
tellectual property. The chapter ends with a discussion of the importance of 
conducting an intellectual property audit, which is a proactive tool an entrepre-
neurial firm can use to catalog the intellectual property it owns and determine 
how its intellectual property should be protected.
the importance of intellectual property
Intellectual property is any product of human intellect that is intangible 
but has value in the marketplace. It is called “intellectual” property be-
cause it is the product of human imagination, creativity, and inventiveness.5 
Traditionally, businesses have thought of their physical assets such as land, 
buildings, and equipment as their most important assets. Increasingly, how-
ever, a company’s intellectual assets are the most valuable.6 In the case of 
DripCatch, the firm’s intellectual property consists of intangible assets such

as its patent (once granted), its trademark, and its Internet domain name. All 
these assets can provide a business with a competitive advantage in the mar-
ketplace, and the loss of such assets can be just as costly (if not more so) to a 
business as the loss of physical property or equipment.
Not all firms are as intellectual property savvy as DripCatch. In fact, com-
mon mistakes that entrepreneurial firms make are not properly identifying all 
their intellectual property, not fully recognizing the value of their intellectual 
property, not using their intellectual property as part of their overall plan of 
success, and not taking sufficient steps to protect it. These mistakes are pre-
sented in Figure 12.1. It can be difficult, however, to determine what qualifies 
as intellectual property and whether it should be legally protected. Every facet 
of a company’s operations probably owns intellectual property that should be 
protected. To illustrate this point, Table 12.1 provides examples of the intel-
lectual property that typically resides within the departments of midsize entre-
preneurial firms. Intellectual property is also an important part of our nation’s 
economy and its competitive advantage in the world marketplace. “It’s a huge 
issue,” former U.S. Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez said. “There is so 
much of our economy that is linked to branded products, patented products, 
copyrights. So much of our economy thrives on creativity.”7
The United States Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO) has several pro-
grams designed specifically to help inventors and small businesses protect 
their intellectual property. The help is motivated in part by The American 
Invents Act (AIA), which encourages the USPTO to “work with and support 
intellectual property laws associations across the county in the establishment 
of pro bono programs designed to assist financially under-resourced indepen-
dent inventors and small businesses.” The first is a pro bono legal assistance 
program, which is being rolled out state by state. This program provides patent 
filing assistance to qualified applicants. You can see if the program is available 
in your state by going to the National Clearinghouse, which is accessible via 
the USPTO website at www.uspto.gov/inventors/state_resources. The second 
is the Inventors Assistance Center (www.uspto.gov/inventors/iac), which pro-
vides overall patent assistance and support to the general public.

CHAPTER 12 | THE IMPORTAnCE OF Intellectual PROPERTy    429
determining What intellectual property 
to legally protect
There are two primary rules of thumb for deciding if intellectual property 
protection should be pursued for a particular intellectual asset. First, a firm 
should determine if the intellectual property in question is directly related to 
its competitive advantage. For example, Amazon.com has a business method 
patent on its “one-click” ordering system, which is a nice feature of its website 
and is arguably directly related to its competitive advantage. Similarly, when 
PatientsLikeMe launched a social networking platform for people with seri-
ous diseases, it would have been foolish for the company not to trademark the 
PatientsLikeMe name. In contrast, if a business develops a product or business 
method or produces printed material that isn’t directly related to its competitive 
advantage, intellectual property protection may not be warranted.
The second primary criterion for deciding if intellectual property protection 
should be pursued is to determine whether an item has value in the market-
place. A common mistake that young companies make is to invent a product, 
spend a considerable amount of money to patent it, and find that the market 
for the product does not exist or that the existing market is too small to be wor-
thy of pursuit. As discussed in Chapter 3, business ideas should be properly 
tested before a considerable amount of money is spent developing and legally 
protecting them. Owning the exclusive right to something no one wants is of 
little value. Similarly, if a company develops a logo for a special event, it is prob-
ably a waste of money to register it with the USPTO if there is a good chance the 
logo will not be used again.
the Four key Forms of intellectual property
Patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets are the four key forms of 
intellectual property. We discuss each form of intellectual property protection 
in the following sections. Intellectual property laws exist to encourage creativ-
ity and innovation by granting individuals who risk their time and money in

creative endeavors exclusive rights to the fruits of their labors for a period 
of time. Intellectual property laws also help individuals make well-informed 
choices. For example, when a consumer sees a Panera Bread restaurant, she 
knows exactly what to expect because only Panera Bread is permitted to use the 
Panera Bread trademark for soups, signature sandwiches, and bakery products.
One special note about intellectual property laws is that it is up to entre-
preneurs to take advantage of them and to safeguard their intellectual property 
once it is legally protected. Police forces and fire departments are available to 
quickly respond if an entrepreneur’s buildings or other physical assets are 
threatened, but there are no intellectual property police forces or fire depart-
ments in existence. The courts prosecute individuals and companies that break 
intellectual property laws. However, the individual entrepreneur must under-
stand intellectual property laws, safeguard intellectual property assets, and 
initiate litigation if intellectual property rights are infringed upon or violated.
There is a government-sponsored website (www.stopfakes.gov) that pro-
vides information about how to file a complaint if a business feels that a 
“knock off” product is infringing on its intellectual property. Increasingly, 
counterfeit goods are a problem for firms that have spent considerable re-
sources to brand their products in ways that create value for customers. The 
top five categories of goods that are counterfeited are electronics, shoes, phar-
maceutical products, CDs and DVDs, and clothing.8 Check out the blog IP 
Law For Startups (www.iplawforstartupcompanies.com) to keep up to date on 
all aspects of intellectual property law.
While not one of the four key forms of intellectual property, Internet domain 
names are an important form of intellectual property. Having a short, easy-to-
spell Internet domain name is becoming increasingly important as the Internet 
becomes an ever more powerful force in business. An Internet domain name is 
obtained through a domain name registrar like GoDaddy.com and costs around 
$13 per year to register. Like other forms of intellectual property, domain names 
can be bought and sold, and desirable names are valuable. For example, Apple 
reportedly paid $6 million in 2011 to obtain the domain name www.icloud.com 
from its previous owner.
patents
A patent is a grant from the federal government conferring the rights to exclude 
others from making, selling, or using an invention for the term of the patent.9 
The owner of the patent is granted a legal monopoly for a limited amount of time. 
However, a patent does not give its owner the right to make, use, or sell the in-
vention; it gives the owner only the right to exclude others from doing so. This is 
a confusing issue for many entrepreneurs. If a company is granted a patent for 
an item, it is natural to assume that it could start making and selling the item 
immediately. But it cannot. A patent owner can legally make or sell the patented 
invention only if no other patents are infringed on by doing so.10 For example, if 
an inventor obtained a patent on a computer chip and the chip needed technol-
ogy patented earlier by Intel to work, the inventor would need to obtain permis-
sion from Intel to make and sell the chip. Intel may refuse permission or ask for 
a licensing fee for the use of its patented technology. Although this system may 
seem odd, it is really the only way the system could work. Many inventions are 
improvements on existing inventions, and the system allows the improvements to 
be patented, but only with the permission of the original inventors, who usually 
benefit by obtaining licensing income in exchange for their consent.11
Patent protection has deep roots in U.S. history and is the only form of 
intellectual property right expressly mentioned in the original articles of the 
U.S. Constitution. The first patent was granted in 1790 for a process of making 
potash, an ingredient in fertilizer. The patent was signed by George Washington

and was issued to a Vermont inventor named Samuel Hopkins. Patents are 
important because they grant inventors temporary, exclusive rights to market 
their inventions. This right gives inventors and their financial backers the op-
portunity to recoup their costs and earn a profit in exchange for the risks and 
costs they incur during the invention process. If it weren’t for patent laws, 
inventors would have little incentive to invest time and money in new inven-
tions. “No one would develop a drug if you didn’t have a patent,” Dr. William 
Haseltine, former CEO of Human Genome Sciences, a biotech firm, once said.12
Since the first patent was granted in 1790, the USPTO has granted 8.7 mil-
lion patents, including 302,150 in 2013 alone. The number of patents granted 
in 2013 was 62 percent more than the number granted in 2003, just 10 years 
earlier. These data suggest that a willingness to invent in the United States is 
strong. Interestingly, the USPTO, the sole entity responsible for granting patents 
in the United States, is strained. At the end of 2013, there were 584,998 patent 
applications pending, and it took an average of 29.1 months to get a patent ap-
plication approved. Actually, the USPTO has been making strides in this area. 
The total time required to get a patent application approved reached a high of 
35.3 months in 2010.
Some inventors and companies are very prolific and have multiple patents. 
There is increasing interest in patents, as shown in Table 12.2, as advances in 
technology spawn new inventions.

types of patents
There are three types of patents: utility patents, design patents, and plant pat-
ents. As shown in Figure 12.2, there are three basic requirements for a patent 
to be granted: The subject of the patent application must be (1) useful, (2) novel 
in relation to prior arts in the field, and (3) not obvious to a person of ordinary 
skill in the field.
Utility patents are the most common type of patent and cover what we 
generally think of as new inventions. Of the 601,317 patent applications filed 
in 2013, 94 percent were for utility patents.13 Patents in this category may be 
granted to anyone who “invents or discovers any new and useful process, ma-
chine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improve-
ment thereof.”14 The term of a utility patent is 20 years from the date of the 
initial application. After 20 years, the patent expires, and the invention falls into 
the public domain, which means that anyone can produce and sell the invention 
without paying the prior patent holder. Consider the pharmaceutical industry. 
Assume a drug produced by a large firm such as Pfizer Inc. is prescribed for you 
and that, when seeking to fill the prescription, your pharmacist tells you there is 
no generic equivalent available. The lack of a generic equivalent typically means 
that a patent owned by Pfizer protects the drug and that the 20-year term of 
the patent has not expired. If the pharmacist tells you there is a generic version 
of the drug available, that typically means the 20-year patent has expired and 
other companies are now making a drug chemically identical to Pfizer’s. The 
price of the generic version of the drug is generally lower because the manufac-
turer of the generic version of the drug is not trying to recover the costs Pfizer (in 
this case) incurred to develop the product (the drug) in question.
A utility patent cannot be obtained for an “idea” or a “suggestion” for a new 
product or process. A complete description of the invention for which a utility 
patent is sought is required, including drawings and technical details. In addi-
tion, a patent must be applied for within one year of when a product or process 
was first offered for sale, put into public use, or was described in any printed 
publication. The requirement that a patent application must be filed within 
one year of the milestones referred to previously is called the one year after 
first use deadline.
Recently, utility patent law has added business method patents, which 
have been of particular interest to Internet firms. A business method patent 
is a patent that protects an invention that is or facilitates a method of do-
ing business. Patents for these purposes were not allowed until 1998, when 
a federal circuit court issued an opinion allowing a patent for a business 
method, holding that business methods, mathematical algorithms, and soft-
ware are patentable as long as they produce useful, tangible, and concrete 
results. This ruling opened a “Pandora’s box” and has caused many firms to 
scramble to try to patent their business methods. Since 1998, the most no-
table business method patents awarded have been Amazon.com’s one-click 
ordering system, Priceline.com’s “name-your-price” business model, and 
Netflix’s method for allowing customers to set up a rental list of movies they

Activities associated with a business method patent can be an important 
source of competitive advantage for a firm.
Design patents are the second most common type of patent and cover the 
invention of new, original, and ornamental designs for manufactured prod-
ucts.15 Of the 601,317 patent applications filed in 2013, 5.8 percent were for 
design patents.16 A design patent is good for 14 years from the grant date. 
While a utility patent protects the way an invention is used and works, a de-
sign patent protects the way it looks. As a result, if an entrepreneur invented 
a new version of the computer mouse, it would be prudent to apply for a util-
ity patent to cover the way the mouse works and for a design patent to protect 
the way the mouse looks. Although all computer mice perform essentially the 
same function, they can be ornamentally designed in an infinite number of 
ways. As long as each new design is considered by the USPTO to be novel and 
nonobvious, it is eligible for design patent protection. This is not a trivial issue 
in that product design is increasingly becoming an important source of com-
petitive advantage for many firms producing many different types of products.
Plant patents protect new varieties of plants that can be reproduced asex-
ually. While only 1,320 of the 601,317 patent applications filed in 2013 were 
for plant patents, these patents provide essential protection for companies 
specializing in plant genetics and related areas. Plants that can be reproduced 
asexually are reproduced by grafting or crossbreeding rather than by planting 
seeds. The new variety can be different from previous plants in its resistance 
to disease or drought or in its scent, appearance, color, or productivity. Thus, 
a new color for a rose or a new type of hybrid vegetable would be eligible for 
plant patent protection. The term for plant patent protection is 20 years from 
the date of the original application.
Table 12.3 provides a summary of the three forms of patent protection, the 
types of inventions the patents cover, and the duration of the patents.
Who can Apply for a patent?
Only the inventor of a product can apply for a patent. If two or more people 
make an invention jointly, they must apply for the patent together. Someone 
who simply heard about the design of a product or is trying to patent some-
thing that is in the public domain may not apply for a patent.
There are notable exceptions to these rules. First, if an invention is made 
during the course of the inventor’s employment, the employer typically is as-
signed the right to apply for the patent through an assignment of invention 
agreement signed by the employee as part of the employment agreement. A 
second exception is that the rights to apply for an invention can be sold. This

option can be an important source of revenue for entrepreneurial firms. If a 
firm has an invention that it doesn’t want to pursue on its own, the rights to 
apply for a patent on the invention can be sold to another party.
the process of obtaining a patent
Obtaining a patent is a six-step process, as illustrated in Figure 12.3 and as we 
discuss here. The costs involved include attorney fees, fees for drawings (which 
are sometimes lumped together with the attorney fees), and USPTO filing and 
maintenance fees. For a small entity, it costs around $700 to file a utility pat-
ent application. An additional $480 fee is assessed when a patent is issued. 
Maintenance fees of $800, $1,800, and $3,700 are due at the 3 ½ year mark, 
the 7 ½ year mark, and the 11 ½ year mark, respectively, to keep a patent in 
force. Additional fees may be assessed depending on the nature of the patent. 
Attorney fees vary depending on the complexity of the technology involved. An 
estimate of attorney fees to obtain a patent is provided in Table 12.4.
The inventions that independent inventors create range from relatively sim-
ple to moderately complex. Businesses are across the board. For a highly com-
plex technology, such as a semiconductor product, the costs could substantially 
exceed $15,000.

CHAPTER 12 | THE IMPORTAnCE OF Intellectual PROPERTy    435
The six-step process for obtaining a patent is shown next.
Step 1 Make sure the invention is practical. As mentioned earlier, there 
are two rules of thumb for making the decision to patent. Intellectual 
property that is worth protecting typically is directly related to the 
competitive advantage of the firm seeking the protection or has inde-
pendent value in the marketplace.
Step 2 Determine what type of application to file. As mentioned, there 
are three types of patents: utility patents, design patents, and plant 
patents. The most common by far is the utility patent.
Step 3 Hire a patent attorney. It is highly recommended that an inventor 
work with a patent attorney. Even though there are “patent-it-yourself” 
books and websites on the market, it is generally naïve for an entre-
preneur to think that the patent process can be successfully navigated 
without expert help. A correctly prepared patent application with cor-
rectly defined claims will provide the best chance for an application to 
be approved. In addition, a new product may have patentable features 
that may not be obvious to a novice in the field. As an indication of the 
difficulty of writing a patent application, the USPTO requires all attor-
neys and agents to pass a tough exam before they can interact with the 
agency on behalf of a client.
Step 4 Conduct a patent search. To be patentable, an invention must be 
novel and different enough from what already exists. A patent attor-
ney typically spends several hours searching the USPTO’s database 
(which is available online at www.uspto.gov) to study similar patents. 
After the search is completed and the patents that are similar to the 
invention in question have been carefully studied, the patent attorney 
renders an opinion regarding the probability of obtaining a patent on 
the new invention.
Step 5 File a patent application. The fifth step, if the inventor decides to 
proceed, is to file a patent application with the USPTO in Washington, 
DC. Applications can be filed electronically or by mail. Unlike copy-
right and trademark applications, which can be prepared and filed 
easily by their owners, patent applications are highly technical and 
almost always require expert assistance. In terms of priority in filing 
a patent application, the United States uses a first-to-file system, as 
is used in all countries. The United States switched to a first-to-file 
system from a first-to-invent system on March 16, 2013, with the en-
actment of the America Invents Act. In a first-to-file system, the right 
to the grant of a patent for an invention lies with the first person to 
file a patent application for the invention, regardless of the date of the 
actual invention.
Step 6 Obtain a decision from the USPTO. When the USPTO receives a 
patent application, it is given a serial number, assigned to an exam-
iner, and then waits to be examined. The patent examiner investi-
gates the application and issues a written report (“Office Action”) to 
the applicant’s patent attorney, often asking for modifications to the 
application. Most of the interactions that applicants have with the 
USPTO are by mail or e-mail. Occasionally, an inventor and a lawyer 
will meet face to face with a patent examiner to discuss the invention 
and the written report. There is room to negotiate with the patent of-
fice to try to make an invention patentable. Eventually, a yes-or-no 
decision will be rendered. A rejected application can be appealed, but 
appeals are rare and expensive.

436    PART 4 | MAnAgIng AnD gROWIng An EnTREPREnEURIAL FIRM
One provision of patent law that is particularly important to entrepreneurs 
is that the USPTO allows inventors to file a provisional patent application for 
utility patents, pending the preparation and filing of a complete application. A 
provisional patent application provides the means to establish an early effective 
filing date for a nonprovisional patent application, and allows the term “Patent 
Pending” to be applied. There is often confusion regarding what a provisional 
patent application is. It’s not a provisional patent—there is no such thing. It’s 
merely a provisional application for a patent, and is used to establish an early 
filing date for a subsequently filed full utility patent. It can actually give an 
entrepreneur a false sense of security if not filed correctly. The ins and outs 
of filing a provisional patent application are explained in this chapter’s “Savvy 
Entrepreneurial Firm” feature.
In some instances, entrepreneurs license their patents to larger firms, which 
have nationwide distribution channels to market a product. In fact, consumer 
product companies like Procter & Gamble (P&G) and General Mills, which at one 
time relied strictly on their own scientists to develop new products, now have 
formal programs for inventors and entrepreneurs to submit product ideas, as 
illustrated in the “Partnering for Success” feature. The arrangements described 
in the “Partnering for Success” feature represent a win-win for both inventors 
and larger firms. The inventor receives distribution for his or her product and 
potential licensing income, and the large firm receives an innovative new prod-
uct to place in its distribution channels. One requirement most large firms have 
is that an idea must be patented or a patent must be applied for before they will 
consider licensing it.
patent infringement
Patent infringement takes place when one party engages in the unauthor-
ized use of another party’s patent. A typical example of an infringement claim 
was that initiated by Alacritech, a start-up firm, which claimed that Microsoft 
violated two of its patents on technology used to speed the performance of 
computers connected to networks. According to court documents, Alacritech 
showed its technology to Microsoft, hoping that Microsoft would license it. But 
Microsoft passed on the offer and later announced a surprisingly similar tech-
nology, called Chimney. Alacritech again offered to license the technology to 
Microsoft but was rebuffed. In response, Alacritech filed suit against Microsoft. 
Microsoft claimed that its technology was developed independently.17 After 
hearing the case, the U.S. District Court in San Francisco sided with Alacritech 
and filed a preliminary injunction against Microsoft, preventing it from ship-
ping products that contained the contested technology. Later, the suit was set-
tled out of court, with Microsoft agreeing to license Alacritech’s technology.18
The tough part about patent infringement cases is that they are costly 
to litigate, which puts start-up firms and their entrepreneurs at quite a dis-
advantage. While there is no way of knowing how much it cost Alacritech to 
sue Microsoft, a typical patent-infringement suit, according to Fortune Small 
Business, costs each side at least $500,000 to litigate.19
trademarks
A trademark is any word, name, symbol, or device used to identify the source or 
origin of products or services and to distinguish those products or services from 
others. All businesses want to be recognized by their potential clientele and use 
their names, logos, and other distinguishing features to enhance their visibility. 
Trademarks also provide consumers with useful information. For example, con-
sumers know what to expect when they see a Macy’s store in a mall. Think of 
how confusing it would be if any retail store could use the name Macy’s.

CHAPTER 12 | THE IMPORTAnCE OF Intellectual PROPERTy    437
I
n start-up circles, it’s not uncommon to hear people say 
that they have a “provisional patent” or that they’re pro-
tected from someone stealing their invention because a 
provisional patent has been filed. neither of these state-
ments can be true, because there is no such thing as a 
provisional patent. While the people who make those 
claims are normally well-intentioned, failing to be familiar 
with the basics of patent law can result in an entrepreneur 
inadvertently surrendering the patent rights for which he 
or she has an invention. If this happens, it can cripple a 
firm that’s planning on achieving a sustainable competi-
tive advantage via its exclusive rights on an invention.
Here’s an accurate assessment of what takes place 
for entrepreneurs working in the United States. What’s 
filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office 
(USPTO) is a “provisional patent application.” It includes 
specifications (i.e., a description and drawings of an in-
vention), but does not require formal patent claims, inven-
tors’ oaths or declarations, or any information disclosure 
statement. It’s not assigned to a patent examiner, and no 
judgment is made regarding prior art or the patentability 
of the invention. Its purpose, in the eyes of the USPTO, is 
to establish an early filing date for a subsequently filed full 
utility patent. What’s meant by this is that if a provisional 
patent application is filed on December 1, 2014, and the 
application is done correctly, this becomes the “priority” 
filing date for that invention. If someone files a utility pat-
ent application for an identical invention a month later, 
that person is out of luck, as long as the inventor who 
filed the provisional patent application follows through 
and files for a full utility patent within one year, and both 
the provisional patent application and the full utility pat-
ent application are deemed to be acceptable. A bonus 
attached to filing a provisional patent application, which 
costs $149 to file, is that the inventor can legally use the 
term “patent pending” in relation to the invention. This 
designation may provide the inventor a significant mar-
keting advantage, if the invention is already for sale, and 
signal to prospective inventors that the inventor is taking 
steps to protect his or her patent rights.
There is a catch, however, to this scenario—the pro-
visional patent application must be completed and filed 
correctly. All patent applications, including provisional 
patent applications, are subject to three important statu-
tory requirements:
 1. It must include an adequate written description of the 
invention.
 2. It should enable one of ordinary skill in the art to make 
and use the invention.
 3. It must set forth the best mode of practicing the inven-
tion contemplated by the inventor upon filing.
If any one of these requirements is not met, along 
with other statutory requirements the USPTO has, it’s 
tantamount to not having filed anything at all. So it’s 
very important that provisional patent applications be 
sufficiently detailed and filed correctly. Here’s what can 
happen if they’re not. Suppose Amy invents a new type 
of tennis racket. She files a provisional patent applica-
tion on January 1, 2015, by downloading the application 
and filing it herself. It’s inadequate because it doesn’t 
contain an adequate written description of her invention, 
but the USPTO doesn’t tell Amy it’s inadequate because 
it doesn’t examine provisional patent applications until 
a full utility patent is filed. On July 1, 2015, Amy hires 
a patent attorney to file for a full utility patent on her 
invention. After reviewing her file, the USPTO examiner 
rejects the application, because someone filed a utility 
patent application for an identical invention a month 
earlier, on June 1, 2015. The reason for the rejection is 
that Amy’s provisional patent application was deemed 
to be invalid because the description was inadequate. 
The fact that Amy filed a provisional patent application 
on January 1, 2015, five full months before the second 
party filed for an identical invention, holds no weight be-
cause Amy’s provisional patent application was deemed 
to be invalid.
Amy’s story illustrates that filing a provisional patent 
application takes some finesse. Filing a provisional pat-
ent application has its place. It’s particularly useful for an 
inventor who invents a new device and wants to lock in a 
priority filing date while additional prototyping and feasi-
bility analysis are conducted to decide whether it’s worth 
the time and money to file for a full utility patent. It’s a 
balancing act, however. An inventor needs to be far down 
the road before a provisional patent application makes 
sense. It may also make sense to hire a patent attorney 
to file the provisional patent application. Amy’s descrip-
tion probably wasn’t adequate because she didn’t create 
a prototype of her new tennis racket, and thus was not 
able to adequately describe it. A patent attorney would 
have most likely told Amy that her description wasn’t 
adequate, and suggested that more work be completed 
before the provisional patent application was filed. An 
idea can’t be patented—only the specific expression of 
an idea, which must contain an adequate description.
The USPTO does allow additional provisional applica-
tions for a device to be filed as improvements are made. 
This protects inventors who are making progress on their 
device and want to establish priority dates for improved 
iterations of an invention as progress is made.

As is the case with patents, trademarks have a rich history. Archaeologists 
have found evidence that as far back as 3,500 years ago, potters made distinc-
tive marks on their articles of pottery to distinguish their work from others. But 
consider a more modern example. The original name that Jerry Yang and David 
Filo, the co-founders of Yahoo, selected for their Internet directory service was 
“Jerry’s Guide to the World Wide Web.” Not too catchy, is it? The name was later 
changed to Yahoo, which caught on with early adopters of the Internet.
the Four types of trademarks
There are four types of trademarks: trademarks, service marks, collective 
marks, and certification marks (see Table 12.5). Trademarks and service 
marks are of the greatest interest to entrepreneurs.
Trademarks, as described previously, include any word, name, symbol, 
or device used to identify and distinguish one company’s products from an-
other’s. Trademarks are used to promote and advertise tangible products.

Examples here include Apple for smartphones, Nike for athletic shoes, Ann 
Taylor for women’s clothing, and Zynga for online games.
Service marks are similar to ordinary trademarks, but they are used to 
identify the services or intangible activities of a business rather than a busi-
ness’s physical product. Service marks include The Princeton Review for test 
prep services, eBay for online auctions, and Verizon for cell phone service.
Collective marks are trademarks or service marks used by the members 
of a cooperative, association, or other collective group, including marks indi-
cating membership in a union or similar organization. The marks belonging to 
the American Bar Association, The International Franchise Association, and 
the Entrepreneurs’ Organization are examples of collective marks.
ideas. not all companies are open to new ideas, but many 
are. For example, P&g’s idea submission program is titled 
“P&g Connect + Develop.” The program, which vets more 
than 4,000 submissions annually, has been so successful 
that P&g credits it with more than half of its new prod-
ucts over the past 10 years. Products that have emerged 
from the program include Olay Regenerist, Swiffer, and 
Pulsonic toothbrushes. general Mills’s program is titled 
“g-Win,” and has also experienced success, for both 
inventors and general Mills. Stanley Black & Decker’s 
program is illustrative of how the submission and vetting 
process works. Simply go to the company’s website at 
www.stanleyblack&decker.com, click on the “Company” 
tab, and follow the link titled “Submit an Idea.”
Questions for Critical Thinking
 1. Why do you think companies are increasingly open to 
ideas from outside inventors?
 2. For an inventor or entrepreneur, what are the upsides 
to working with a company like general Mills or Stanley 
Black & Decker? What, if any, are the downsides?
 3. Find an idea submission site for a company not 
mentioned in the feature. Describe how to submit an 
invention to the company. What appear to be the keys 
to getting an idea accepted by the company?
 4. In most cases, do you think inventors and entrepre-
neurs get a fair shake when they license a product or 
enter into an alliance with a large firm? What steps 
should entrepreneurs take to make sure they are getting 
a fair deal?

istributing their products is a common problem fac-
ing inventors and entrepreneurs. gary Schwartzberg 
is a case in point. Schwartzberg, along with a 
partner, developed a new type of bagel. Dubbed the 
“Bageler,” the bagel was tube-shaped and filled with 
cream cheese. Schwartzberg was able to get the product 
into supermarkets and schools in South Florida, where he 
lived, but couldn’t achieve wider distribution. He finally 
mailed Kraft a box of his cream-cheese-filled bagels 
with a proposal. He picked Kraft because he wanted to 
use Philadelphia Cream Cheese (a Kraft product) to fill 
the bagel.
By coincidence, Kraft had been working on a similar 
product but couldn’t get it right. Schwartzberg had a 
patented process for “encapsulating” the cream cheese 
in the center of the bagel without the cream cheese 
escaping during the baking process. Kraft bit and, after 
some back and forth, Schwartzberg and Kraft hammered 
out a deal. Schwartzberg told the Wall Street Journal 
that he couldn’t discuss the details of the deal because 
of a confidentiality agreement with Kraft, but says it’s 
structured as a strategic alliance and he “has skin in the 
game.” Schwartzberg’s product, which is now called 
Bagel-fuls, is sold nationwide by Kraft Foods.
Entrepreneurs and inventors are finding that large 
consumer products companies are increasingly inter-
ested in what they have to offer. For example, Lifetime 
Brands, the United States’ leading resource for nation-
ally branded kitchenware, tabletop, and home décor 
products, is soliciting ideas from outside inventors. A 
section of its home page titled “Share your ideas” reads, 
“Lifetime Brands recognizes that good ideas come from 
unexpected places. If you have a great idea, we’d love to 
hear from you.” Instructions are then provided for how to 
submit a product idea.
Companies vary in terms of what stage an idea needs 
to be at before it can be submitted for consideration. The 
best way to find out is to study the portion of a company’s 
website that provides instructions for how to submit

Finally, certification marks are marks, words, names, symbols, or devices 
used by a person other than its owner to certify a particular quality about a 
product or service. The most familiar certification mark is the UL mark, which 
certifies that a product meets the safety standards established by Underwriters 
Laboratories. Other examples are the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval, 
Stilton Cheese (a product from the Stilton region in England), and 100% Napa 
Valley (from grapes grown in the Napa Valley of northern California).
What is protected under trademark law?
Trademark law, which falls under the Lanham Act, passed in 1946, protects 
the following items:
■ Words: All combinations of words are eligible for trademark registration, 
including single words, short phrases, and slogans. Birchbox, Warby 
Parker, and the National Football League are examples of words and 
phrases that have been registered as trademarks.
■ Numbers and letters: Numbers and letters are eligible for registration. 
Examples include 3M, Boeing 787, and AT&T. Alphanumeric marks are 
also registerable, such as 1-800-CONTACTS.
■ Designs or logos: A mark consisting solely of a design, such as the 
Golden Gate Bridge for Cisco Systems or the Nike swoosh logo, may be 
eligible for registration. The mark must be distinctive rather than generic. 
As a result, no one can claim exclusive rights to the image of the Golden 
Gate Bridge, but Cisco Systems can trademark its unique depiction of the 
bridge. Composite marks consist of a word or words in conjunction with a 
design. An example is the trademark for Zephyrhill’s bottled water, which 
includes Zephyrhill’s name below a picture of mountain scenery and water.
■ Sounds: Distinctive sounds can be trademarked, although this form 
of trademark protection is rare. Recognizable examples of such sounds 
include MGM’s lion’s roar, the familiar four-tone sound that accompanies 
“Intel Inside” commercials, and the Yahoo yodel.
■ Fragrances: The fragrance of a product may be registerable as long as the 
product is not known for the fragrance or the fragrance does not enhance 
the use of the product. As a result, the fragrance of a perfume or room 
deodorizer is not eligible for trademark protection, whereas stationery 
treated with a special fragrance in most cases would be.
■ Shapes: The shape of a product, as long as it has no impact on the prod-
uct’s function, can be trademarked. The unique shape of the Apple iPod 
has received trademark protection.20 The Coca-Cola Company has trade-
marked its famous curved bottle. The shape of the bottle has no effect on 
the quality of the bottle or the beverage it holds; therefore, the shape is 
not functional.
■ Colors: A trademark may be obtained for a color as long as the color 
is not functional. For example, Nexium, a medicine pill that treats acid 
 reflux disease, is purple and is marketed as “the purple pill.” The color of 
the pill has no bearing on its functionality; therefore, it can be protected 
by trademark protection.
■ Trade dress: The manner in which a product is “dressed up” to appeal 
to customers is protectable. This category includes the overall packag-
ing, design, and configuration of a product. As a result, the overall look 
of a business is protected as its trade dress. In a famous case in 1992, 
Two Pesos, Inc., v. Taco Cabana International Inc., the U.S. Supreme 
Court protected the overall design, colors, and configuration of a chain 
of Mexican restaurants from a competitor using a similar decor.21

CHAPTER 12 | THE IMPORTAnCE OF Intellectual PROPERTy    441
Trademark protection is very broad and provides many opportunities for 
businesses to differentiate themselves from one another. The key for young 
entrepreneurial firms is to trademark their products and services in ways that 
draw positive attention to them in a compelling manner.
exclusions from trademark protection
There are notable exclusions from trademark protection that are set forth in the 
U.S. Trademark Act:
■ Immoral or scandalous matter: A company cannot trademark immoral 
or scandalous matter, including profane words.
■ Deceptive matter: Marks that are deceptive cannot be registered. For ex-
ample, a food company couldn’t register the name “Fresh Florida Oranges” 
if the oranges weren’t from Florida.
■ Descriptive marks: Marks that are merely descriptive of a product or 
service cannot be trademarked. For example, an entrepreneur couldn’t 
 design a new type of golf ball and try to obtain trademark protection on 
the words golf ball. The words describe a type of product rather than 
a brand of product, such as Titleist or Taylor Made, and are needed 
by all golf ball manufacturers to be competitive. This issue is a real 
concern for the manufacturers of very popular products. At one point, 
Xerox was in danger of losing trademark protection for the Xerox name 
 because of the common use of the word Xerox as a verb (e.g., “I am go-
ing to Xerox this”).
■ Surnames: A trademark consisting primarily of a surname, such as 
Anderson or Smith, is typically not protectable. An exception is a surname 
combined with other wording that is intended to trademark a distinct 
product, such as William’s Fresh Fish or Smith’s Computer Emporium.
the process of obtaining a trademark
As illustrated in Figure 12.4, selecting and registering a trademark is a three-
step process. Once a trademark has been used in interstate commerce, it can 
be registered with the USPTO. It can remain registered forever as long as the 
trademark stays in use. The first renewal is between the fifth and the sixth 
year following the year of initial registration. It can be renewed every 10 years 
thereafter, as long as the trademark stays in use.
Technically, a trademark does not need to be registered to receive protec-
tion and to prevent other companies from using confusingly similar marks. 
Once a mark is used in commerce, such as in an advertisement, it is protected. 
There are several distinct advantages, however, in registering a trademark with 
the USPTO: Registered marks are allowed nationwide priority for use of the 
mark, registered marks may use the federal trademark registration symbol 
(®), and registered marks carry with them the right to block the importation of 
infringing goods into the United States. The right to use the trademark regis-
tration symbol is particularly important. Attaching the trademark symbol to a 
product (e.g., My Yahoo!®) provides notice of a trademark owner’s registration.

This posting allows an owner to recover damages in an infringement action 
and helps reduce an offender’s claim that it didn’t know that a particular name 
or logo was trademarked.
There are three steps in selecting and registering a trademark:
Step 1 Select an appropriate mark. There are several rules of thumb to 
help business owners and entrepreneurs select appropriate trade-
marks. First, a mark, whether it is a name, logo, design, or fragrance, 
should display creativity and strength. Marks that are inherently 
distinctive, such as the McDonald’s Golden Arches; made-up words, 
such as Google and eBay; and words that evoke particular images, 
such as Double Delight Ice Cream, are strong trademarks. Second, 
words that create a favorable impression about a product or service 
are helpful. A name such as Safe and Secure Childcare for a day care 
center positively resonates with parents.
Step 2 Perform a trademark search. Once a trademark has been selected, 
a trademark search should be conducted to determine if the trade-
mark is available. If someone else has already established rights to 
the proposed mark, it cannot be used. There are several ways to con-
duct a trademark search, from self searches to hiring a firm special-
izing in trademark clearance checks. The search should include both 
federal and state searches in any states in which business will be 
conducted. If the trademark will be used overseas, the search should 
also include the countries where the trademark will be used.
Although it is not necessary to hire an attorney to conduct a 
trademark search, it is probably a good idea to do so. As noted above, 
self searches can also be conducted. The USPTO’s website provides 
a powerful trademark search engine at www.uspto.gov/trademarks. 
There is a catch. The USPTO’s search engine only searches trade-
marks that are registered. In the United States, you are not required 
to register a trademark to obtain protection. A trademark attorney 
can perform a more comprehensive search for you if you think it is 
necessary. Adopting a trademark without conducting a trademark 
search is risky. If a mark is challenged as an infringement, a com-
pany may have to destroy all its goods that bear the mark (including 
products, business cards, stationery, signs, and so on) and then se-
lect a new mark. The cost of refamiliarizing customers with an exist-
ing product under a new name or logo could be substantial.
Step 3 Create rights in the trademark. The final step in establishing a 
trademark is to create rights in the mark. In the United States, if the 
trademark is inherently distinctive (think of Starbucks, iTunes, or 
Facebook), the first person to use the mark becomes its owner. If the 
mark is descriptive, such as “Bufferin” for buffered aspirin, using the 
mark merely begins the process of developing a secondary meaning 
necessary to create full trademark protection. Secondary meaning 
arises when, over time, consumers start to identify a trademark with 
a specific product. For example, the name “chap stick” for lip balm 
was originally considered to be descriptive, and thus not afforded 
trademark protection. As people started to think of “chap stick” as 
lip balm, it met the threshold of secondary meaning, and the name 
“ChapStick” was able to be trademarked.
There are two ways that the USPTO can offer further protection for firms con-
cerned about maintaining the exclusive rights to their trademarks. First, a per-
son can file an intent-to-use trademark application. This is an application 
based on the applicant’s intention to use a trademark. Once this application 

CHAPTER 12 | THE IMPORTAnCE OF Intellectual PROPERTy    443
is filed, the owner obtains the benefits of registration. The benefits are lost, 
however, if the owner does not use the mark in business within six months 
of registration. Further protection can be obtained by filing a formal applica-
tion for a trademark. The application must include a drawing of the trademark 
and a filing fee, ranging from $275 to $375, depending on how the applica-
tion is filed. (It’s cheaper to file electronically.) After a trademark application is 
filed, an examining attorney at the USPTO determines if the trademark can be 
registered. It currently takes about 10 months to get a trademark registered 
through the USPTO.
copyrights
A copyright is a form of intellectual property protection that grants to the 
owner of a work of authorship the legal right to determine how the work is 
used and to obtain the economic benefits from the work.22 The work must be 
in a tangible form, such as a book, operating manual, magazine article, musi-
cal score, computer software program, or architectural drawing. If something 
is not in a tangible form, such as a speech that has never been recorded or 
saved on a computer disk, copyright law does not protect it.
Businesses typically possess a treasure trove of copyrightable material, as 
illustrated earlier in Table 12.1. A work does not have to have artistic merit 
to be eligible for copyright protection. As a result, things such as operating 
manuals, advertising brochures, and training videos qualify for protection. 
The Copyright Revision Act of 1976 governs copyright law in the United States. 
Under the law, an original work is protected automatically from the time it is 
created and put into a tangible form, whether it is published or not. The first 
copyright in the United States was granted on May 31, 1790, to a Philadelphia 
educator named John Barry for a spelling book.
What is protected by a copyright?
Copyright laws protect “original works of authorship” that are fixed in a tan-
gible form of expression. The primary categories of material that can be copy-
righted follow:
■ Literary works: Anything written down is a literary work, including books, 
poetry, reference works, speeches, advertising copy, employee manuals, 
games, and computer programs. Characters found in literary works are 
protectable if they possess a high degree of distinctiveness. A character 
that looks and acts like Garfield, the cartoon cat, would infringe on the 
copyright that protects Garfield.
■ Musical compositions: A musical composition, including any accompa-
nying words, that is in a fixed form (e.g., a musical score, CD, or an MP3 
file) is protectable. The owner of the copyright is usually the composer and 
possibly a lyricist. Derivative works, which are works that are new rendi-
tions of something that is already copyrighted, are also copyrightable. As a 
result of this provision, a musician who performs a unique rendition of a 
song written and copyrighted by Miley Cyrus, Katy Perry, or Bruno Mars, 
for example, can obtain a copyright on his or her effort. Of course, each of 
these artists would have to consent to the infringement on its copyright of 
the original song before the new song could be used commercially, which 
is a common way that composers earn extra income.
■ Computer software: In 1980, Congress passed the Computer Software 
Copyright Act, which amended previous copyright acts. Now, all forms of 
computer programs are protected.

444    PART 4 | MAnAgIng AnD gROWIng An EnTREPREnEURIAL FIRM
■ Dramatic works: A dramatic work is a theatrical performance, such as 
a play, comedy routine, newscast, movie, or television show. An entire 
dramatic work can be protected under a single copyright. As a result, a 
dramatic work such as a television show doesn’t need a separate copy-
right for the video and audio portions of the show.
■ Pantomimes and choreographic works: A pantomime is a performance 
that uses gestures and facial expressions rather than words to communi-
cate a situation. Choreography is the arrangement of dance movements. 
Copyright laws in these areas protect ballets, dance movements, and 
mime works.
■ Pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works: This is a broad category that 
includes photographs, prints, art reproductions, cartoons, maps, globes, 
jewelry, fabrics, games, technical drawings, diagrams, posters, toys, 
 sculptures, and charts.
Other categories of items covered by copyright law include motion pictures and 
other audiovisual works, sound recordings, and architectural works.
Copyright law provides broad protection for authors and the creators of other 
types of copyrightable work. The most common mistake entrepreneurs make in 
this area is not thinking broadly enough about what they should copyright.
exclusions from copyright protection
There are exclusions from copyright protection. The main exclusion is that 
copyright laws cannot protect ideas. For example, an entrepreneur may have 
the idea to open a soccer-themed restaurant. The idea itself is not eligible for 
copyright protection. However, if the entrepreneur writes down specifically 
what the soccer-themed restaurant will look like and how it would operate, 
that description is copyrightable. The legal principle describing this concept is 
called the idea–expression dichotomy. An idea is not copyrightable, but the 
specific expression of an idea is.
Other exclusions from copyright protection include facts (e.g., population 
statistics), titles (e.g., Introduction to Entrepreneurship), and lists of ingredients 
(e.g., recipes).
how to obtain a copyright
As mentioned, copyright law protects any work of authorship the moment it 
assumes a tangible form. Technically, it is not necessary to provide a copyright 
notice or register work with the U.S. Copyright Office to be protected by copy-
right legislation. The following steps can be taken, however, to enhance the 
protection offered by the copyright statutes.
First, copyright protection can be enhanced for anything written by at-
taching the copyright notice, or “copyright bug” as it is sometimes called. 
The bug—a “c” inside a circle—typically appears in the following form: © [first 
year of publication] [author or copyright owner]. Thus, the notice at the bot-
tom of a magazine ad for Dell Inc.’s computers in 2016 would read, “© 2016 
Dell Inc.” By placing this notice at the bottom of a document, an author 
(or company) can prevent someone from copying the work without permis-
sion and claiming that they did not know that the work was copyrighted. 
Substitutes for the copyright bug include the word “Copyright” and the ab-
breviation “Copr.”
Second, further protection can be obtained by registering a work with the 
U.S. Copyright Office. Filing a simple form and depositing one or two samples 
of the work with the U.S. Copyright Office completes the registration process. 
The need to supply a sample depends on the nature of the item involved. 

CHAPTER 12 | THE IMPORTAnCE OF Intellectual PROPERTy    445
Obviously, one could not supply one or two samples of an original painting. 
The current cost of obtaining a copyright is $35 if filed electronically and 
$55 if filed on paper. Although the $35 fee seems modest, in many cases it 
is impractical for a prolific author to register everything he or she creates. In 
all cases, however, it is recommended that the copyright bug be attached to 
copyrightable work and that registration be contemplated on a case-by-case 
basis. A copyright can be registered at any time, but filing promptly is recom-
mended and makes it easier to sue for copyright infringement.
Copyrights last a long time. According to current law, any work created on 
or after January 1, 1978, is protected for the life of the author plus 70 years. 
For works made for hire, the duration of the copyright is 95 years from publi-
cation or 120 years from creation, whichever is shorter. For works created be-
fore 1978, the duration times vary, depending on when the work was created. 
After a copyright expires, the work goes into the public domain, meaning it 
becomes available for anyone’s use.
copyright infringement
Copyright infringement is a growing problem in the United States and in other 
countries, with estimates of the costs to owners at more than $25 billion per 
year. For example, less than a week after the film was released in the United 
States, bootleg video discs of the original Harry Potter movie were reported to 
be for sale in at least two Asian countries. Taking this a step further, we note 
that a recent study showed that as of 2013, Internet infringement in the enter-
tainment industry “accounts for almost one-fourth of all bandwidth in North 
America, Europe and Asia.”23 Copyright infringement occurs when one work 
derives from another, is an exact copy, or shows substantial similarity to the 
original work. To prove infringement, a copyright owner is required to show 
that the alleged infringer had prior access to the copyrighted work and that the 
work is substantially similar to the owner’s.
There are many ways to prevent infringement. For example, a technique 
frequently used to guard against the illegal copying of software code is to 
The rampant illegal 
 downloading and shar-
ing of music—copyright 
infringement—is a  major 
challenge the music 
industry continues to 
struggle with. Hackers are 
always looking for new 
ways to skirt the law.

446    PART 4 | MAnAgIng AnD gROWIng An EnTREPREnEURIAL FIRM
embed and hide in the code useless information, such as the birth dates and 
addresses of the authors. It’s hard for infringers to spot useless information if 
they are simply cutting and pasting large amounts of code from one program 
to another. If software code is illegally copied and an infringement suit is filed, 
it is difficult for the accused party to explain why the (supposedly original) 
code included the birth dates and addresses of its accusers. Similarly, some 
publishers of maps, guides, and other reference works will deliberately include 
bits of phony information in their products, such as fake streets, nonexistent 
railroad crossings, and so on, to try to catch copiers. Again, it would be pretty 
hard for someone who copied someone else’s copyrighted street guide to ex-
plain why the name of a fake street was included.24
Current law permits limited infringement of copyrighted material. Consider 
fair use, which is the limited use of copyrighted material for purposes such as 
criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, or scholarship. This provision is 
what allows textbook authors to repeat quotes from magazine articles (as long 
as the original source is cited), movie critics to show clips from movies, and 
teachers to distribute portions of newspaper articles. The reasoning behind 
the law is that the benefit to the public from such uses outweighs any harm 
to the copyright owner. Other situations in which copyrighted material may be 
used to a limited degree without fear of infringement include parody, reproduc-
tion by libraries, and making a single backup copy of a computer program or 
a digital music file for personal use. Case 12.2, titled “Protecting Intellectual 
Property: Elvis’s Memory and Intellectual Property Live On,” focuses on a 
copyright infringement case in which the courts ruled that fair use was not 
being employed appropriately. A more recent case, involving GoldieBlox, a 
2012 start-up, and the hip-hop band the Beastie Boys, also involved fair use. 
The case involved GoldieBlox using a Beastie Boys song in a video ad without 
obtaining the Beastie Boys’ permission, and claiming fair use as justification. 
The case was closely followed by the media and is profiled in the nearby “What 
Went Wrong?” feature. It vividly portrays the types of legal entanglements that 
start-ups can get into if they don’t understand or if they push the boundaries 
of intellectual property laws.
copyright and the internet
Every day, vast quantities of material are posted on the Internet and can be 
downloaded or copied by anyone with a computer and an Internet connec-
tion. Because the information is stored somewhere on a computer or Internet 
server, it is in a tangible form and probably qualifies for copyright protection. 
As a result, anyone who downloads material from the Internet and uses it for 
personal purposes should be cautious and realize that copyright laws are just 
as applicable for material on the Internet as they are for material purchased 
from a bookstore or borrowed from a library.
Copyright laws, particularly as they apply to the Internet, are sometimes 
difficult to follow, and it is easy for people to dismiss them as contrary to com-
mon sense. For example, say that a golf instructor in Phoenix posted a set of 
“golf tips” on his website for his students to use as they prepare for their les-
sons. Because the notes are on a website, anyone can download the notes and 
use them. As a result, suppose that another golf instructor in a different part of 
the United States or in a different country ran across the golf tips, downloaded 
them, and decided to distribute them to his students. Under existing law, the 
second golf instructor probably violated the intellectual property rights of the 
first. Arguably, he should have gotten permission from the first golf instructor 
before using the notes even if the website didn’t include any information about 
how to contact the first instructor. To many people, this scenario doesn’t make 
sense. The first golf instructor put his notes on a public website, didn’t include 

CHAPTER 12 | THE IMPORTAnCE OF Intellectual PROPERTy    447
G
oldieBlox is a toy company, launched in 2012, that 
introduces girls to the field of engineering. It was 
started by Debbie Sterling, an engineering student 
at Stanford, who was troubled by the lack of women 
in engineering and the lack of encouragement girls re-
ceive to go into math and science fields. “goldie” is a 
smart young girl that Sterling made up. Each toy in the 
goldieBlox series consists of a book, featuring goldie, 
and a set of age-appropriate construction items, such 
as spools and ribbons. girls play with the toy by helping 
goldie solve problems by building things. For example, 
in goldieBlox and the Spinning Machine, a toy in the 
series, players must help goldie build a belt drive ma-
chine to help her dog, nacho, chase his tail. The idea 
is to introduce girls to the fundamentals of engineering. 
goldieBlox’s toys have been picked up by multiple big-
name stores, including Toys“R”Us and Target.
In fall 2013, goldieBlox ran an online advertisement 
for its game “Princess Machine,” featuring three young 
girls singing an altered version of the Beastie Boys 1987 
song “girls.” The advertisement quickly went viral, at-
tracting over eight million views on youTube. The ad 
changed the song’s lyrics to promote the notion that girls 
are capable of ambitious tasks. Some of the original lyr-
ics, “girls do the dishes,” “girls to clean up my room,” 
“girls to do the laundry,” were replaced with “girls to 
build a spaceship,” “girls to code the new app,” “girls 
to grow up knowing.” If you’d like to see the ad, go to 
youTube and type in goldieBlox and Beastie Boys, and 
you can pick from one of many videos that replay and 
comment on the ad.
The Beastie Boys, who did not know about the ad 
until it came out, were not happy. When they objected 
to goldieBlox’s use of their song, claiming copyright 
infringement, goldieBlox filed a preemptive lawsuit 
against the Beastie Boys, saying that the company had 
created a parody of the song, which constituted fair 
use. Fair use allows for the limited use of copyrighted 
material for purposes such as parody, criticism, com-
ment, news reporting, and teaching. Consistent with 
the nature of parody, goldieBlox said that it was trying 
to make fun of the Beastie Boys song for the purpose 
of breaking down stereotypes and encouraging young 
girls to engage in activities that challenge their intellect, 
particularly in the fields of science, technology, engi-
neering, and math.
The Beastie Boys responded by voicing their sup-
port for goldieBlox’s overall message and efforts, but 
outlined, in an open letter, their objections to the video. 
Their objections were twofold. First, they argued that as 
creative as the video is, it was made to sell a product. 
years ago, according to the letter, the group made a 
conscious decision not to permit its music or name to 
be used in product sales. Second, the letter referred 
to the fact that when they simply asked goldieBlox 
how and why their song “girls” had been used in an ad 
without their permission, they were sued. goldixBlox 
responded to the letter by pulling the video and issu-
ing an open letter of their own. The letter said that the 
video was made with the best of intentions, with the 
goal of transforming the song “girls” into a powerful 
anthem for young women. They went on to say that 
although they believe the video falls under fair use, they 
would honor the Beastie Boys wishes and no longer 
use the video. 
Despite the letter from goldieBlox, in December 2013, 
the Beastie Boys filed a countersuit against the company, 
arguing that the video’s use of the song didn’t constitute 
fair use as the ad used “the Beastie Boys” musical com-
position “girl” with lyrics modified to become a “jingle” to 
sell goldieBlox products.
In March 2014, goldieBlox and the Beastie Boys 
reached a settlement, in favor of the Beastie Boys. 
The settlement included the issuance of an apology 
by goldieBlox and a stipulation that goldieBlox would 
make payments, based on a percentage of its revenue, 
to one or more charities selected by the Beastie Boys 
that support science, engineering, and mathematics 
education for girls. Along with an apology, the com-
pany went on to say that in hindsight, they should have 
reached out to the Beastie Boys to secure the proper 
rights to the song bore using it in their ad. A follow-up 
article published by the Guardian reported details of 
goldieBlox’s settlement with the Beastie Boys. Along 
with the apology, the settlement requires goldieBlox to 
pay $1 million to one or more charities of the Beastie 
Boys’ choice, based on a percentage of yearly earnings, 
until the $1 million is paid.

include information about how he could be contacted. In addition, he made no 
attempt to protect the notes, such as posting them on a password-protected 
Web page. Still, intellectual property rights apply, and the second instructor

There are a number of techniques available for entrepreneurs and web-
masters to prevent unauthorized material from being copied from a website. 
Password protecting the portion of a site containing sensitive or proprietary 
information is a common first step. In addition, there are a number of techni-
cal protection tools available on the market that limit access to or the use of 
online information, including selected use of encryption, digital watermarking 
(hidden copyright messages), and digital fingerprinting (hidden serial num-
bers or a set of characteristics that tend to distinguish an object from other 
similar objects).
trade secrets
Most companies, including start-ups, have a wealth of information that is 
critical to their success but does not qualify for patent, trademark, or copyright 
protection. Some of this information is confidential and needs to be kept secret 
to help a firm maintain its competitive advantage. An example is a company’s 
customer list. A company may have been extremely diligent over time track-
ing the preferences and buying habits of its customers, helping it fine-tune its 
marketing message and target past customers for future business. If this list fell 
into the hands of one or more of the company’s competitors, its value would be 
largely lost, and it would no longer provide the firm a competitive advantage over 
its competitors.
A trade secret is any formula, pattern, physical device, idea, process, or 
other information that provides the owner of the information with a competitive 
advantage in the marketplace. Trade secrets include marketing plans, product 
formulas, financial forecasts, employee rosters, logs of sales calls, and laboratory 
notebooks. The medium in which information is stored typically has no impact 
on whether it can be protected as a trade secret. As a result, written documents, 
computer files, audiotapes, videotapes, financial statements, and even an em-
ployee’s memory of various items can be protected from unauthorized disclosure.
Unlike patents, trademarks, and copyrights, there is no single government 
agency that regulates trade secret laws. Instead, trade secrets are governed 
by a patchwork of various state laws. The federal Economic Espionage Act, 
passed in 1996, does criminalize the theft of trade secrets. The Uniform Trade 
Secrets Act, which a special commission drafted in 1979, attempted to set na-
tionwide standards for trade secret legislation. Although the majority of states 
have adopted the act, most revised it, resulting in a wide disparity among 
states in regard to trade secret legislation and enforcement.

CHAPTER 12 | THE IMPORTAnCE OF Intellectual PROPERTy    449
What Qualifies for trade Secret protection?
Not all information qualifies for trade secret protection. In general, informa-
tion that is known to the public or that competitors can discover through legal 
means doesn’t qualify for trade secret protection. If a company passes out 
brochures at a trade show that are available to anyone in attendance, nothing 
that is in the brochure can typically qualify as a trade secret. Similarly, if a 
secret is disclosed by mistake, it typically loses its trade secret status. For ex-
ample, if an employee of a company is talking on a cell phone in a public place 
and is overheard by a competitor, anything the employee says is generally 
exempt from trade secret protection. Simply stated, the general philosophy of 
trade secret legislation is that the law will not protect a trade secret unless its 
owner protects it first.
Companies can maintain protection for their trade secrets if they take 
reasonable steps to keep the information confidential. In assessing whether 
reasonable steps have been taken, courts typically examine how broadly the 
information is known inside and outside the firm, the value of the information, 
the extent of measures taken to protect the secrecy of the information, the ef-
fort expended in developing the information, and the ease with which other 
companies could develop the information. On the basis of these criteria, the 
strongest case for trade secret protection is information that is characterized by 
the following:
■ Is not known outside the company
■ Is known only inside the company on a “need-to-know” basis
■ Is safeguarded by stringent efforts to keep the information confidential
■ Is valuable and provides the company a compelling competitive advantage
■ Was developed at great cost, time, and effort
■ Cannot be easily duplicated, reverse engineered, or discovered
trade Secret disputes
Trade secret disputes arise most frequently when an employee leaves a firm to 
join a competitor and is accused of taking confidential information along. For 
example, a marketing executive for one firm may take a job with a competitor 
and create a marketing plan for the new employer that is nearly identical to the 
plan being worked on at the previous job. The original employer could argue 
that the marketing plan on which the departed employee was working was a 
company trade secret and that the employee essentially stole the plan and took 
it to the new job. The key factor in winning a trade secret dispute is that some 
type of theft or misappropriation must have taken place. Trade secrets can be 
lawfully discovered. For example, it’s not illegal for one company to buy an-
other company’s products and take them apart to see how they are assembled. 
In fact, this is a relatively common practice, which is another reason compa-
nies continuously attempt to innovate as a means of trying to stay at least one 
step ahead of competitors.
A company damaged by trade secret theft can initiate a civil action for 
damages in court. The action should be taken as soon after the discovery of 
the theft as possible. In denying the allegation, the defendant will typically ar-
gue that the information in question was independently developed (meaning no 
theft took place), was obtained by proper means (such as with the permission 
of the owner), is common knowledge (meaning it is not subject to trade secret 
protection), or was innocently received (such as through a casual conversa-
tion at a business meeting). Memorization is not a defense. As a result, an 
employee of one firm can’t say that “all I took from my old job to my new one 

450    PART 4 | MAnAgIng AnD gROWIng An EnTREPREnEURIAL FIRM
was what’s in my head” and claim that just because the information conveyed 
wasn’t in written form, it’s not subject to trade secret protection. If the courts 
rule in favor of the firm that feels its trade secret has been stolen, the firm can 
stop the offender from using the trade secret and obtain financial damages.
trade Secret protection methods
Aggressive protection of trade secrets is necessary to prevent intentional or 
unintentional disclosure. In addition, one of the key factors in determining 
whether something constitutes a trade secret is the extent of the efforts to keep 
it secret. Companies protect trade secrets through physical measures and 
written agreements.
Physical Measures  There are a number of physical measures firms use 
to protect trade secrets, from security fences around buildings, to providing 
employees access to file cabinets that lock, to much more elaborate measures. 
The level of protection depends on the nature of the trade secret. For example, 
although a retail store may consider its inventory control procedures to be a 
trade secret, it may not consider this information vital and may take appropri-
ate yet not extreme measures to protect the information. In contrast, a biotech 
firm may be on the cusp of discovering a cure for a disease and may take ex-
treme measures to protect the confidentiality of the work being conducted in 
its laboratories.
The following are examples of commonly used physical measures for protect-
ing trade secrets:
■ Restricting access: Many companies restrict physical access to confiden-
tial material to only the employees who have a “need to know.” For example, 
access to a company’s customer list may be restricted to key personnel in 
the marketing department.
■ Labeling documents: Sensitive documents should be stamped or labeled 
“confidential,” “proprietary,” “restricted,” or “secret.” If possible, these 
documents should be secured when not in use. Such labeling should 
be restricted to particularly sensitive documents. If everything is labeled 
“confidential,” there is a risk that employees will soon lose their ability to 
distinguish between slightly and highly confidential material.
■ Password protecting confidential computer files: Providing employees 
with clearance to view confidential information by using secure passwords 
can restrict information on a company’s computer network, website, or 
intranet. Companies can also write-protect documents to ensure that 
 employees can read but not modify certain documents.
■ Maintaining logbooks for visitors: Visitors can be denied access to 
confidential information by asking them to sign in when they arrive at a 
company facility, having them wear name badges that identify them as 
visitors, and always making sure they are accompanied by a company 
employee.
■ Maintain logbooks for access to sensitive material: Many companies 
maintain logbooks for sensitive material and make their employees “check 
out” and “check in” the material.
■ Maintaining adequate overall security measures: Commonsense 
 measures are also helpful. Shredders should be provided to destroy docu-
ments as appropriate. Employees who have access to confidential material 
should have desks and cabinets that can be locked and secured. Alarms, 
security systems, and security personnel should be used to protect a 
firm’s premises.

CHAPTER 12 | THE IMPORTAnCE OF Intellectual PROPERTy    451
Some of these measures may seem extreme. On the other hand, we live in 
an imperfect world and, because of this, companies need to safeguard their 
information against both inadvertent disclosure and outright theft. Steps such 
as shredding documents may seem like overkill at first glance but may be very 
important in ultimately protecting trade secrets. Believe it or not, there have 
been a number of cases in which companies have caught competitors literally 
going through the trash bins behind their buildings looking for confidential 
information.
Written agreements  It is important for a company’s employees to know 
that it is their duty to keep trade secrets and other forms of confidential infor-
mation secret. For the best protection, a firm should ask its employees to sign 
nondisclosure and noncompete agreements, as discussed in Chapter 7.
Intellectual property, and the problems that underlie the need for intellec-
tual property to be created, are important enough that firms have been started 
strictly for the purpose of helping companies solve problems and obtain the 
intellectual property that they need.
conducting an intellectual property audit
The first step a firm should take to protect its intellectual property is to complete 
an intellectual property audit. This is recommended for all firms, regardless of 
size, from start-ups to mature companies. An intellectual property audit is 
conducted to determine the intellectual property a company owns.
The following sections describe the reasons for conducting an intellectual 
property audit and the basic steps in the audit process. Some firms hire attor-
neys to conduct the audit, whereas others conduct the audit on their own. Once 
an audit is completed, a company can determine the appropriate measures it 
needs to take to protect the intellectual property that it owns and that is worth 
the effort and expense of protecting.
Why conduct an intellectual property Audit?
There are two primary reasons for conducting an intellectual property audit. 
First, it is prudent for a company to periodically determine whether its intel-
lectual property is being properly protected. As suggested by the contents of 
Table 12.6, intellectual property resides in every department in a firm, and 
it is common for firms to simply overlook intellectual property that is eligible 
for protection.
The second reason for a company to conduct an intellectual property audit 
is to remain prepared to justify its value in the event of a merger or acquisi-
tion. Larger companies purchase many small, entrepreneurial firms primarily 
because the larger company wants the small firm’s intellectual property. When 
a larger company approaches, the smaller firm should be ready and able to 
justify its valuation.
the process of conducting an intellectual 
property Audit
The first step in conducting an intellectual property audit is to develop an in-
ventory of a firm’s existing intellectual property. The inventory should include 
the firm’s present registrations of patents, trademarks, and copyrights. Also 
included should be any agreements or licenses allowing the company to use 
someone else’s intellectual property rights or allowing someone else to use the 
focal company’s intellectual property.
learning Objective
 6. Explain what an intellec-
tual property audit is and 
identify the two primary 
reasons entrepreneurial 
firms should complete this 
type of audit.

452    PART 4 | MAnAgIng AnD gROWIng An EnTREPREnEURIAL FIRM
The second step is to identify works in progress to ensure that they are 
being documented in a systematic, orderly manner. This is particularly im-
portant in research and development. As mentioned earlier, if two inventors 
independently develop essentially the same invention, the right to apply for the 
patent belongs to the person who invented the product first. Properly dated 
and witnessed invention logbooks and other documents help prove the date an 
invention was made.
The third step of the audit is to specify the firm’s key trade secrets and 
describe how they are being protected. Putting this information in writing 
helps minimize the chance that if a trade secret is lost, someone can claim 
that it wasn’t really a trade secret because the owner took no specific steps 
to protect it.

Chapter Summary
property worth protecting. But to protect 
this property, firms must first identify it. 
There are two rules of thumb for determin-
ing whether intellectual property is worth 
the time and expense of protecting. First, 
a firm should determine whether the in-
tellectual property in question is directly 
related to its current competitive advantage 
or could facilitate developing future com-
petitive advantages. Second, it’s important 
to know whether the intellectual property 
has independent value in the marketplace.
 lO1. Intellectual property is any product of hu-
man intellect that is intangible but has 
value in the marketplace. It is called intel-
lectual property because it is the product of 
human imagination, creativity, and inven-
tiveness. Patents, trademarks, copyrights, 
and trade secrets are the major forms of 
intellectual property. A common mistake 
companies make is not thinking broadly 
enough when identifying their intellectual 
property assets. Almost all companies, re-
gardless of size or age, have intellectual 

CHAPTER 12 | THE IMPORTAnCE OF Intellectual PROPERTy    453
obtain the economic benefits associated 
with using the work. Thus, copyright law 
protects original works of authorship that 
are fixed in a tangible form of expression. 
This is a broad definition and means that 
almost anything a company produces that 
can be written down, recorded, or video-
taped or that takes a tangible form itself 
(such as a sculpture) is eligible for copy-
right protection. Examples of copyright-
able material include literary works, mu-
sical compositions, dramatic works, and 
pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works.
 lO5. Unlike patents, trademarks, and copy-
rights, there is not a single government 
agency that regulates trade secret laws. 
Instead, a trade secret (which is any for-
mula, pattern, physical device, idea, pro-
cess, or other information that provides 
the owner with a competitive advantage in 
the marketplace) is governed by a patch-
work of various state laws. The federal 
Economic Espionage Act does criminalize 
the theft of trade secrets. Trade secret 
disputes arise most frequently when an 
employee leaves a firm to join a competitor 
and is accused of taking confidential infor-
mation along. Firms protect their trade se-
crets through both physical measures and 
written agreements. Firms use a number 
of physical measures to protect their trade 
secrets. These include restricting access, 
labeling documents, password protecting 
computer files, maintaining logbooks for 
visitors, and maintaining adequate overall 
security measures.
 lO6. There are two primary reasons for conduct-
ing an intellectual property audit. First, it 
is prudent for a company to periodically 
assess the intellectual property it owns to 
determine whether it is being properly pro-
tected. Second, a firm should conduct a pe-
riodic intellectual property audit to remain 
prepared to justify its value in the event of a 
merger or acquisition.
 lO2. A patent is a grant from the federal gov-
ernment conferring the right to exclude 
others from making, selling, or using an 
invention for the term of the patent. There 
are three types of patents—utility pat-
ents, design patents, and plant patents. 
The most common of these is the utility 
patent, which covers what we generally 
think of as new inventions. Design pat-
ents are concerned with the invention of 
new, original, and ornamental designs for 
manufactured products. The least com-
mon of the three patents—the plant pat-
ent—protects new plant varieties that can 
reproduce asexually. Obtaining a patent 
is a painstaking, six-step process that 
usually requires the help of a patent at-
torney. A patent can be sold or licensed, 
which is a common strategy for entrepre-
neurial firms.
 lO3. A trademark is any word, name, sym-
bol, or device that is used to identify the 
source or origin of products or services 
and to distinguish those items from oth-
ers. Trademarks, service marks, collec-
tive marks, and certification marks are 
the four types of trademarks. Trademark 
law is far-reaching, helping businesses 
be creative in drawing attention to their 
products and services. Examples of marks 
that can be protected include words, 
numbers and letters, designs and logos, 
sounds, fragrances, shapes, and colors. 
Immoral or scandalous matter, deceptive 
matter, descriptive marks, and surnames 
are ineligible for trademark protection. 
Entrepreneurs follow three steps to select 
and register a trademark: (1) select an ap-
propriate trademark, (2) perform a trade-
mark search, and (3) create rights in the 
trademark.
 lO4. A copyright is a form of intellectual prop-
erty protection that grants to the owner 
of a work of authorship the legal right to 
determine how the work is used and to

business idea: Create a bike that teaches kids how 
to ride without training wheels in a safe, enjoyable, and 
confidence-building manner.
pitch: To teach their kids how to ride a bike, most 
parents choose pedaled bikes with training wheels. While 
training wheels may seem to be the easiest approach, 
they do not teach kids balance or proper bicycle steering. 
A bike with training wheels may even be dangerous since 
it can tip over if a child turns a corner too quickly or rides 
on uneven ground. In addition, by not teaching balance, 
when the training wheels come off a child has yet to learn 
the most important part of riding a bike.
KaZAM bikes offer a quick, safe, and enjoyable alterna-
tive. They are peddle-less bikes that kids propel with 
their feet on the ground (like a skateboard, but they use 
both feet). When they build up enough momentum to 
coast, they pull their feet off the ground and rest them 
on a patented foot platform. The advantage is that the 
bike teaches balance and steering. When a child lifts his 
feet off the ground and places them on the foot platform, 
he must maintain proper balance and center of gravity, 
similar to riding a traditional bike. KaZAM bikes teach co-
ordination and balance and prepare kids to ride peddled 
bikes safely.
The KaZAM bike was created by friends John Lugo and 
Michael Wagner after Lugo watched his three-year-old 
try out a wooden European model several years ago. 
They are designed for three- to six-year-olds, which is 
the age most kids are when they learn to ride a bike. 
While there are other balance bikes on the market, the 
KaZAM is the only one with the patented foot rest de-
signed to teach perfect balance. Other balance bikes 
have foot pegs or require kids to drag their feet on the 
ground. The KaZAM bike has several nice design fea-
tures. The seat releases quickly, so it can be easily ad-
justed as a child grows. The handlebars adjust forward 
and backward as well as up and down. This feature 
allows a smaller child to better reach the handlebars 
from a seated position. The bike has a classy look and 
is available in several colors. The smooth tire tread and 
steel spokes give the bike a smooth and fast ride.
On May 9, 2013, Mary Beth Lugo (co-creator John Lugo’s 
wife) pitched KaZAM on Shark tank (Season 4, Episode 
424). The entertaining episode ended with deals from 
sharks Mark Cuban and Barbara Corcoran. KaZAM is now 
branded as a Mark Cuban company. KaZAM bikes are 
sold online and in a growing number of bike shops and 
stores. The company has received a number of recogni-
tions and awards, including the national Parent Center 
Seal of Approval and The Oppenheim Toy Portfolio gold 
Seal Award.

business idea: To establish a social network for 
software users to make it easier to track, share, and find 
software.
pitch: Buying computer software online or from a store is 
often a tricky task, and keeping up to date with the latest 
releases can be confusing. There are thousands of new 
software programs every year and dozens of different 
operating systems. It can be difficult to get a completely 
impartial view. Although there are many online websites 
and magazines offering software reviews, there is no way 
of knowing how long the reviewer has used the program 
and what kind of program he or she usually likes.
Wakoopa was founded by two Dutch bloggers, Robert 
gaal and Wouter Broekhof, to solve these problems and 
create a social network for software users.
Wakoopa’s sign-up process is very simple: Users pro-
vide a user name and password and then are given a 
page with the download links for the Wakoopa tracking 
software. They then install a small application on their 
PC or Mac that works by performing a check every 
15 minutes to track what software they use for a range 
of applications such as music players, office software, 
and photo editing, and how long they use it for. The 
information gathered can then be shared with friends, 
and personal profiles are automatically updated with 
any news, updates, or reviews on each specific appli-
cation. It helps people decide whether or not to spend 
money on a program, because they can check out the 
statistics beforehand and see if the program is a one-hit 
wonder, or if it has proved its value to many users in the 
long term.

the pulse of the most popular and unpopular new web 
applications.
In 2014, Wakoopa joined netquest, the online fieldwork 
provider for the market research industry. They oper-
ate in Spain, Latin America, and Portugal. The goal is 
to integrate the tracking program with other applica-
tions. Wakoopa, however, does remain an independent 
company.

questions would you ask the firm’s founders before 
making your funding decision? What answers would 
satisfy you?
 12-32. If you had to make your decision on just the 
 information provided in the pitch and on the 
 company’s website, would you fund this firm? 
Why or why not?
Wakoopa started as a social network in 2006. They had 
around 200,000 registered users who called themselves 
“Wakoopians.” In 2010 Wakoopa began selling their 
tracking software as a market research tool, and as a 
result they closed down the social network in 2012.
In the first six months following its launch in April 2007, 
17,000 people downloaded the Wakoopa tracking pro-
gram. In the following year, the 17,000 doubled again, 
helping to generate some 250 million hours of unique 
and useful data about software, including lists of the 
most popular and most used software applications on a 
year-by-year basis. Early adopters of the site are primar-
ily tech-savvy software developers and gamers, although 
there is evidence that the service is being used more 
widely by consumers who are happy to see their own 
desktop behavior become public. The payback is a lively 
social network for software and the opportunity to test 
introduction
Here’s a question that a panel of judges decided: Can a 
company patent how it makes a peanut butter and jelly 
sandwich? More specifically, in this instance, judges 
considered whether J. M. Smucker’s method of making 
Uncrustables—which is a crustless peanut butter and 
jelly sandwich sealed inside soft bread—is worthy of legal 
protection against imitators. While the nature of this case 
is interesting, the legal rulings resulting from the case 
have broader implications. At stake is how generous the 
patent office should be in awarding patents—an issue 
with solid arguments on both sides.
There were actually two cases leading up to the 
case that resulted in the final verdict. The three cases 
are designated Round 1, Round 2, and Round 3 of 
Smucker’s battle to patent the peanut butter and jelly 
sandwich.
The case involves the Smucker’s Uncrustables 
sandwich. Uncrustables are found in the frozen food 
section of most grocery stores. They are 2-ounce pea-
nut butter and jelly pockets that are sealed inside soft 
bread. They come in boxes of 4, 10, or 18 sandwiches. 
To make an Uncrustables ready to eat, the customer 
simply needs to let it thaw for 30–60 minutes after be-
ing taken out of the freezer.
Uncrustables were developed in 1995 by 
David geske, of Fargo, north Dakota, and Len 
Kretchman, of Fergus Falls, Minnesota. The two 
started mass-producing them for Midwestern schools. 
Smucker’s took note of their success and bought geske 
and Kretchman’s company in 1999. The purchase of the 
company included a general patent on crustless peanut 
butter and jelly sandwiches (Patent no. 6,004,596) that 
geske and Kretchman had obtained.
round 1: Smucker’s versus Albie’s Foods
It wasn’t long before Smucker’s was defending its turf. 
In 2001, Smucker’s ordered a much smaller firm, Albie’s 
Foods, to stop selling its own crustless peanut butter 
and jelly sandwich. Albie’s was selling the sandwich 
to a local school district. Albie’s fought back, and the 
case was eventually dismissed. In its arguments, Albie’s 
contended that the “pasty”—a meat pie with crimped 
edges, which the company saw its crustless peanut 
butter and jelly sandwich as a variation of—had been a 
popular food in northern Michigan since the immigration 
of copper and iron miners from England in the 1800s.
round 2: Smucker’s and the patent office
Stung by its experience with the case it brought against 
Albie’s, Smucker’s returned to the USPTO to try to get 
its general patent on crustless peanut butter and jelly 
sandwiches broadened as a means of being able to bet-
ter defend the Uncrustables. The patent office rejected 
the application. The gist of the Smucker’s argument

was that its sandwich’s sealed edge is unique, and its 
layering approach, which keeps the jelly in the middle 
of the sandwich, is one-of-a-kind and, as such, should 
be protected by law. The patent office disagreed with 
this view. It said that the crimped edge, which was one 
of the things Smucker’s argued was unique about its 
sandwich, is similar to the crimped edges in ravioli and 
pie crusts. In addition, the patent office determined that 
putting jelly in the middle of a peanut butter and jelly 
sandwich is hardly unique, and as evidence cited a 1994 
Wichita (Kansas) eagle newspaper article on back-to-
school tips that suggested just this approach.
round 3: Smucker’s Appeals
Smucker’s appealed the patent office’s decision to 
the U.S. Court of Appeals. During the court hearings 
the attorney representing Smucker’s argued that the 
method for making the Uncrustables is unique because 
the two slices of bread are sealed by compression but 
are not “smashed” as they are in tarts or ravioli. (Recall 
that the patent office’s original decision compared the 
process of making Uncrustables to that of making ravi-
oli.) Smucker’s further argued that it wouldn’t be fair 
to let other companies simply copy the Uncrustables 
and benefit from the hard work of Smucker’s scien-
tists and the money that the company had invested 
to produce what it believed was a unique product. 
The Uncrustables is also a big seller for Smucker’s. 
Moreover, sales of the product were up 22 percent at 
the end of the second quarter of 2013 compared to the 
same quarter one year earlier.
broader issues involved
The Smucker’s case was watched closely because of 
the broader issues involved. Critics of the U.S. patent 
process contend that the USPTO is too generous when 
awarding patents—a generosity that they say stifles in-
novation and drives up the cost for consumers. In the 
Smucker’s case, the critics would argue that Smucker’s 
shouldn’t get the patent, because it will deter other food 
companies from making their own versions of peanut 
butter and jelly sandwiches, which will keep the price 
of the Uncrustables high. Advocates of the U.S. patent 
process argue the opposite—that patents motivate a 
company like Smucker’s to invest in new-product in-
novation, and that absent patent protection, a company 
like Smucker’s would have no incentive to develop a 
product like the Uncrustables.
the court’s ruling
In mid-April 2005, after listening to all the arguments, 
the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled on whether Smucker’s 
should get the patent it was requesting. Which way do 
you think the court ruled?
discussion Questions
 12-33. go to the USPTO’s website (www.uspto.gov) to look 
up Patent no. 6,004,596. Read the patent. After 
reading the patent, are you more inclined or less 
inclined to side with the Smucker’s point of view?
 12-34. Type “Uncrustables” into the google search engine 
and look at the Uncrustables sandwich. Spend a 
little time reading about the Uncrustables on the 
Smucker’s website. Again, after looking over the 
website, are you more inclined or less inclined to 
side with the Smucker’s point of view?
 12-35. In regard to the arguments espoused by the “critics” 
of the U.S. patent system and the “advocates” of 
the U.S. patent system, with which of the points of 
view do you agree? Thinking as an entrepreneur, use 
your own words to state why you think the critics or 
the advocates have a stronger point of view.
 12-36. So what do you think happened? Do you think 
Smucker’s did or did not receive the patent it was 
requesting?

CHAPTER 12 | THE IMPORTAnCE OF Intellectual PROPERTy    459
introduction
Savvy owners of intellectual property are always on 
the lookout for people who infringe on their intellectual 
property and take legal action when necessary. From 
2002 to 2005, this scenario played out in a dispute 
involving a company named Passport Video and the 
copyright holders of music and videos produced by the 
late Elvis Presley.
Alleged copyright violation
Elvis, affectionately known as “The King” of rock and 
roll, was a musical icon for more than 20 years until his 
death on August 16, 1977. During his career Elvis was 
very prolific, and a wide variety of people own the copy-
rights to his music, videos, and films. In 2002, Passport 
Video, a video production company, produced a video 
documentary of Elvis’s life titled the Definitive elvis. The 
documentary, which included eight DVDs and 16 hours 
of video, focused on every aspect of Elvis’s life and was 
priced at $99.00. Each episode contained shots of Elvis 
performing—many of which were taken from sources 
that are copyrighted and owned by Elvis Presley 
Enterprises or others. The shots included Presley home 
movies (owned by Elvis Presley Enterprises), material 
from the ed Sullivan Show, and portions of ed Sullivan 
Rock & Roll classics—elvis Presley (owned by SOFA 
Entertainment). Other material included shots from the 
elvis 1968 comeback Special, aloha from Hawaii, and 
elvis in concert, which included songs written by Jerry 
Leiber and Mike Stoller. Passport did not obtain permis-
sion to use the material. As a result, the copyright hold-
ers, who caught wind of the production of the video, 
informed Passport Video that they objected to the pro-
duction of the videos. Passport Video persisted, and in 
August 2003 the copyright holders sued Passport Video 
for unauthorized use of footage and copyright violations. 
They also asked for a preliminary injunction stopping 
Passport Video from selling any more copies of the doc-
umentary, which a U.S. District Court granted.
passport’s defense
Passport mounted a defense, claiming that its use of 
the copyrighted material was fair use and that it had 
spent over $2 million producing and marketing the 
documentary. Fair use is a doctrine in U.S. copyright 
law that allows limited use of copyrighted material 
without requiring permission from the copyright holder. 
In general, the following uses are protected under this 
doctrine:
■ Quotation of the copyrighted work for review or 
criticism or in a scholarly or technical work
■ Use in a parody or satire
■ Brief quotation in a news report
■ Reproduction by a teacher or a student of a small 
part of the work to illustrate a lesson
■ Incidental reproduction of a work in a newsreel 
or broadcast of an event being reported
■ Reproduction of a work in a legislative or judicial 
proceeding
Passport Video also asserted that it interviewed more 
than 200 people to make the documentary and that only 
5 to 10 percent of the length of the videos contained 
copyright material.
the initial decision, the Appeal, and the Final 
decision
After listening to both sides, the U.S. District Court ruled 
in favor of the plaintiffs, saying that fair use didn’t ap-
ply and Passport Video should have obtained the ap-
propriate copyright permissions. The court stated that 
Passport Video released the videos with full knowledge 
that the plaintiffs did not consent to their production, 
and that Passport Video’s documentary would mislead 
consumers (regarding its legal production) and damage 
the plaintiffs.
Passport persisted, appealing the decision to the 
ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, arguing that its docu-
mentary of Elvis’s life constituted scholarly research 
and should therefore be protected under fair use. In 
a 2005 ruling, the ninth Circuit Court of Appeals dis-
agreed and affirmed the ruling of the lower court. In its 
ruling, the court said, “The King is dead. His legacy, 
and those that wish to profit from it, remain very much 
alive.” The court found that Passport’s documentary 
was for commercial use rather than scholarly research, 
although the commercial nature of the project was not 
the deciding factor. Instead, the extent to which the 
copyrighted material was used tipped the decision

for the court, which referred to the lower court’s origi-
nal assessment in its ruling. In its decision, the ninth 
Circuit Court of Appeals, quoting from the decision of 
the lower court, said:
Passport’s use of clips from television appearances, 
although in most cases of short duration, were 
repeated numerous times throughout the tapes. 
While using a small number of clips to reference an 
event for biographical purposes seems fair, using a 
clip over and over will likely no longer serve a bio-
graphical purpose. additionally, some of the clips 
were not short in length. Passport’s use of elvis’ 
appearance on The Steve Allen Show plays for over 
a minute and many more clips play for more than 
just a few seconds.
The ruling barred Passport from selling any addi-
tional copies of the Definitive elvis. It also outlined the 
limits of the fair use defense.
Subsequent to the ruling, the United States 
District Court in Los Angeles awarded plaintiffs 
Elvis Presley Enterprises, SOFA Entertainment, 
and  songwriters Leiber and Stoller $2.8 million in 
monetary damages and attorneys’ fees to be paid 
by Passport Entertainment and its owner, Dante 
Pugliese. Leiber and Stroller wrote “Hound Dog” and 
other Elvis hits. The ruling was considered to be a 
 significant monetary judgment for a copyright infringe-
ment case.
takeaways
In this case, the copyright law did exactly what it is 
 designed to do: protect the legal owners of Elvis’s mate-
rial from copyright infringement. It also put publishers on 
notice that claiming fair use has limits and is not a blanket 
escape from paying copyright holders appropriate licens-
ing fees. The ruling suggested that arguing fair use is more 
likely to hold water when used in conjunction with schol-
arly work or historical analysis than commercial projects.

mark law learn from this case?

I
n early 2011, Kenny Nguyen and Gus Murillo attended an event taking place at 
Louisiana State University, the university they were attending. The speaker was the 
vice president of a Fortune 500 firm. Rather than being blown away by the presenta-
tion, they were shocked by how boring it was. The speaker plodded 
through what seemed like 200 PowerPoint slides, and left his audi-
ence uninspired. At that moment Nguyen, in particular, saw a niche. 
Was there an opportunity to start a company to help others create 
compelling and enriching presentations rather than boring ones? 
In the accompanying photo, Gus Murillo is on the left while Kenny 
Nguyen is on the right.
That was the genesis of Big Fish Presentations. Nguyen, who was 
soon joined by Murillo, got into the presentations training business. 
The initial service that Big Fish Presentations offered was to provide 
personalized presentation services on an end-to-end basis. Not only 
would Nguyen and Murillo help clients define the goals of their presen-
tations and help them develop presentations that would engage and 
resonate with their specific audiences, but they would also develop the 
slides that accompanied the presentations and coach clients through practice presenta-
tion sessions. The first year Big Fish Presentations generated about $59,000 in revenue. 
That number was short of Nguyen and Murillo’s goal of $100,000, but not bad for a com-
pany that started with less than $1,000 in funding.
Initially, Big Fish Presentation’s clients came from in and around Baton Rouge, 
the home of Louisiana State University. Clients included Blue Cross Blue Shield of 
Louisiana, Raising Cane’s, and Voodoo BBQ. From the outset, the company strived 
towards professionalism. For example, it started in the student incubator at the 
Louisiana Business and Technology Center on LSU’s South Campus, but soon moved 
out of the incubator to develop its own identity and brand. Similarly, in working with 
clients, Big Fish Presentations is very focused on helping clients present themselves 
in new and innovative ways. One way it does this is by selecting the presentation plat-
form that is most appropriate for a particular client, rather than automatically reverting 
to PowerPoint. As a result, Big Fish Presentation has created slide decks for clients in 
many different platforms, including Prezi, which builds customized slide presentations 
with photos, graphics, and other media. In Big Fish Presentation’s view, the process 
of building an effective presentation includes five steps: design, storyboard, copy,

storytelling, and presenting. Big Fish Presentations excels in shepherding its clients 
through each step of the presentation process.
In regard to growth, Nguyen and Murillo are committed to growing Big Fish 
Presentations, but have opted to pursue a conservative and patient approach rather 
than a fast-paced strategy. In its second year of existence, the company’s presentation 
and consulting services were supplemented by video production and design, which now 
represents 40 percent of the firm’s revenue. The company maintains a high degree of 
self-awareness regarding what it’s good at and what lies outside its areas of expertise, 
and that self-awareness guides its growth-related decisions. For example, the compa-
ny’s creative abilities have garnered some attention and client requests to pursue other 
graphic design or marketing outlets outside of their core competencies, but Big Fish 
Presentations does not offer those services. Instead, the company focuses intently on 
its three core services—presentation design, presentation consulting, and video design 
and production. The company has passed on some seemingly intriguing possibilities in 
order to remain true to its core priorities. For example, Nguyen and Murillo had the op-
portunity to audition for Shark Tank. Ultimately, they turned down the overture based on 
the recognition that the people who watch Shark Tank aren’t part of their target clientele, 
and that they would rather self-fund Big Fish Presentation’s growth than take investment 
capital to do so. Big Fish Presentations currently has three full-time employees, including 
Nguyen and Murillo, and seven part-time employees who are utilized on a project-by-
project basis. Additional freelancers are employed when demand necessitates. Its client 
list has expanded considerably since its first year. Its clients now include Paramount 
Pictures, Cabela’s, Mutual of Omaha, and a number of Fortune 500 companies.
In regard to managing the day-to-day challenges of growth, Nguyen and Murillo 
have taken concrete steps to make the process manageable. With respect to cash 
flow management, the company requires a 50 percent deposit when it retains a client. 
This practice effectively forces the client to finance half the costs of a project before 
final payment is received. Big Fish Presentations is also moving to a model where it 
tries to sell clients “packages” of services rather than a single service. This step is 
intended to lower the company’s administrative overhead and boost sales by gener-
ating more income from each client. In regard to price stability, which refers to com-
petitors trying to undercut a company’s price, Nguyen and Murillo haven’t struggled 
with this issue. Most of their clients see the value in what they offer, and there aren’t 
many firms that offer the same expertise that Big Fish Presentations is selling. In re-
gard to quality control, there is always a concern that as a company takes on more 
work, the amount of time they have to devote to each individual project decreases. 
Nguyen and Murillo have given this aspect of their business a lot of thought. There are 
two things they’re doing to keep quality high as the number of projects grows. First, 
they’ve carefully documented the processes they used to produce output, so when 
they hire a freelancer to work on a job he or she can be brought up to speed quickly, 
and expectations and quality standards are clear. Second, they never accept a job 
where they believe, as Gus Murillo puts it, the “odds are stacked against them.” What 
Murillo means by this statement is that they won’t accept jobs with unrealistic dead-
lines, for example. Nguyen and Murillo have learned through experience not to put 
their company and employees in this type of undesirable situation.
As Big Fish Presentations moves forward, it will face additional challenges prepar-
ing for and managing growth. The company is currently contemplating several new 
initiatives that it feels are consistent with its core competencies and are a good fit for 
the company moving forward.

t
he Big Fish Presentations case is encouraging in that the company has 
 gotten off to a good start and has achieved growth in a well-executed man-
ner. Its true test will be whether it is able to achieve sustained growth, 
which is growth in both revenues and profits over a sustained period of time. 
Evidence shows that relatively few firms generate sustained and outstanding, 
profitable growth.1 As evidence of this, consider Inc. magazine’s Build 100 proj-
ect. The study entailed collecting data on more than 100,000 U.S. midmarket 
companies (those with 85 to 999 employees) to study firm growth. Incredibly, 
the project found that fewer than 1.5 percent of the companies in the study 
achieve sustained growth, which was measured by increasing their number of 
employees every year from 2007 to 2012. The study found that a company’s 
growth typically follows one of several patterns: (1) it might burst on the scene 
with years of expansion and then decelerate and decline, (2) it might grow in fits 
and starts, possibly in sync with the overall economy, (3) it might enjoy a brief 
boom and then plateau, or (4) it might achieve steady incremental growth re-
peated over time. The fourth option is the healthiest and the pattern that leads 
to sustained growth. “It’s akin to Aesop’s tortise and hare story,” Gary Kunkle, 
the chief researcher on the project, remarked. “Slow and steady wins the race.”2
Although challenging, most entrepreneurial ventures try to grow and see it as 
an important part of their ability to remain successful.3 This sentiment was ex-
pressed by Hewlett-Packard (HP) co-founder David Packard, who wrote that while 
HP was being built, he and co-founder Bill Hewlett had “speculated many times 
about the optimum size of a company.” The pair “did not believe that growth was 
important for its own sake” but eventually concluded that “continuous growth 
was essential” for the company to remain competitive.4 When HP published a for-
mal list of its objectives in 1996, one of the seven objectives was growth.5
The first part of the chapter focuses on preparing for growth, including a 
discussion of three specific areas on which a firm can focus to equip itself for 
growth. The second part of the chapter focuses on reasons for growth. Although 
sustained growth is almost always the result of deliberate intentions, a firm can’t 
always choose its pace of growth. This section lists the seven primary reasons 
that motivate and stimulate business growth. The chapter’s third section focuses 
on managing growth, which centers on knowing and managing the stages of 
growth. In the final section, we examine the challenges of growth, including the 
managerial capacity problem and the day-to-day challenges of growing a firm.
preparing for growth
Most entrepreneurial firms want to grow. Especially in the short term, growth 
in sales revenue is an important indicator of an entrepreneurial venture’s po-
tential to survive today and be successful tomorrow. Growth is exciting and, 
for most businesses, is an indication of success. Many entrepreneurial firms 
have grown quickly, producing impressive results for their employees and 
owners as a result of doing so; consider Google, Dropbox, and Warby Parker, 
among others, as examples of this.
While there is some trial and error involved in starting and growing any 
business, the degree to which a firm prepares for its future growth has a direct 
bearing on its level of success.6 This section focuses on three important things 
a business can do to prepare for growth.
Appreciating the nature of Business growth
The first thing that a business can do to prepare for growth is to appreciate the 
nature of business growth. Growing a business successfully requires prepara-
tion, good management, and an appreciation of the issues involved. The follow-
ing are issues about business growth that entrepreneurs should appreciate.

properly prepare for 
growth.

Not All Businesses Have the Potential to Be Aggressive Growth 
Firms  The businesses that have the potential to grow the fastest over a 
sustained period of time are ones that solve a significant problem or have a 
major impact on their customers’ productivity or lives. This is why the lists 
of fast-growing firms are often dominated by health care, technology, social 
media, and entertainment companies. These companies can potentially have 
the most significant impact on their customers’ businesses or lives. This 
point is affirmed by contrasting the women’s clothing store industry with the 
biotechnology industry. From 2009 to 2014, the average women’s clothing 
store in the United States grew by 2.0 percent while the average biotechnol-
ogy company grew by 5.5 percent.7 While there is nothing wrong with starting 
and owning a women’s clothing store, it’s important to have a realistic outlook 
of how fast the business will likely grow. Even though an individual women’s 
clothing store might get off to a fast start, as its gets larger, its annual growth 
will normally start to reflect its industry norm.8
A Business Can Grow Too Fast  Many businesses start fast and never let 
up, which stresses a business financially and can leave its owners emotionally 
drained. This sentiment is affirmed by Vipin Jain, the CEO of Retrevo, a con-
sumer electronics company. Jain has started several companies. When asked 
what lessons he’s learned as a serial entrepreneur, Jain replied:
I think one thing (I’ve) learned is to not get carried away. Building a startup not 
only takes a good vision and a good market that you want to go after, but it also 
requires systematic execution. You can only run at a certain pace. Don’t try to 
overrun yourself. Be conservative in your spending. Don’t burn all the cash you 
have, because you need that. You need to be very, very conscientious about 
how your business grows and what kind of expenses you have to support your 
growth.9
Sometimes businesses grow at a measured pace and then experience a 
sudden upswing in orders and have difficulty keeping up. This scenario can 
transform a business with satisfied customers and employees into a chaotic 
workplace with people scrambling to push the business’s product out the 
door as quickly as possible. The way to prevent this from happening is to 
recognize when to put the brakes on and have the courage to do it. This set 
of circumstances played out early in the life of The Pampered Chef, a com-
pany that sells kitchen utensils through home parties. Just about the time 
the company was gaining serious momentum, it realized that it didn’t have 
a sufficient quantity of products in its inventory to serve the busy Christmas 
season. This reality posed a serious dilemma. The Pampered Chef couldn’t 
instantly increase its inventory (its vendors were all low in their own invento-
ries and the company was small, so it couldn’t make extraordinary demands 
on its vendors), yet it didn’t want to discourage its home consultants from 
making sales or signing up new consultants. One option was to institute a 
recruiting freeze (on new home consultants), which would slow the rate of 
sales. Doris Christopher, the company’s founder, remembers asking others 
for advice. Most advised against instituting a recruiting freeze, arguing that 
the lifeblood of any direct sales organization is to sign up new recruits. In the 
end, the company decided to institute the freeze and slowed its sales enough 
to fill all orders on time during the holiday season. The freeze was lifted the 
following January, and the number of The Pampered Chef recruits soared. 
Reflecting on the decision, Doris Christopher later wrote:
Looking back, the recruiting freeze augmented our reputation with our sales force, 
customers, and vendors. People saw us as an honest company that was trying to 
do the right thing and not overestimating our capabilities.10

ChAPTER 13 | PREPARING FOR AND Evaluating ThE ChALLENGES OF GROWTh    467
Other businesses have faced similar dilemmas and have sometimes made the 
right call, and other times haven’t. The overarching point is that growth must 
be handled carefully. As we emphasize throughout this chapter, a business 
can only grow as fast as its infrastructure allows. Table 13.1 provides a list of 
10 warning signs that a business is growing too fast.
One company that almost succumbed to the challenges of rapid growth is 
Threadless, as chronicled in the nearby “Partnering for Success” feature. At one 
point early in its life, Threadless was growing so quickly that it’s back-end opera-
tions couldn’t keep up, and it was experiencing multiple problems. Fortunately, 
the company brought on a strategic partner at just the right time to help correct 
the problems. The feature is a vivid illustration of how vulnerable even the most 
seemingly successful firms are to the rigors of rapid growth.
Business Success Doesn’t Always Scale  Unfortunately, the very thing 
that makes a business successful might suffer as the result of growth. This 
is what business experts often mean when they say growth is a “two-edged 
sword.” For example, businesses that are based on providing high levels of in-
dividualized service often don’t grow or scale well. For example, an investment 
brokerage service that initially provided high levels of personalized attention 
can quickly evolve into providing standard or even substandard service as it 
adds customers and starts automating its services. Its initial customers might 
find it harder to get individualized service than it once was and start viewing 
the company as just another ordinary business.
There is also a category of businesses that sell high-end or specialty prod-
ucts that earn high margins. These businesses typically sell their products 
through venues where customers prioritize quality over price. These businesses 
can grow, but only at a measured pace. If they grow too quickly, they can lose 
the “exclusivity” they are trying to project, or can damage their special appeal. 
Fashion clothing boutiques often limit the number of garments they sell in a 
certain size or color for a similar reason. Even though they know they could sell 
more of a particular blouse or dress, they deliberately limit their sales so their 
customers don’t see each other wearing identical items.
staying committed to a core strategy
The second thing that a business can do to prepare for growth is to stay commit-
ted to a core strategy. As discussed in Chapter 4, an important part of a firm’s 
business model is its core strategy, which defines how it competes relative to its 
rivals. A firm’s core strategy is largely determined by its core competencies, or 
what it does particularly well.11 While this insight might seem self-evident, it’s 
important that a business not lose sight of its core strategy as it prepares for 
growth. If a business becomes distracted or starts pursuing every opportunity

where it would send personnel to evaluate its portfolio 
companies’ operations. Insight sent personnel to evalu-
ate Threadless’s back-end operations and make recom-
mendations. It moved Threadless’s website to a new 
host, which was better equipped to help Threadless scale 
its website’s traffic and sales. It also helped Threadless 
improve the functioning of its warehouse and fulfillment 
operations. Threadless’s problems were smoothed out 
and it moved forward. It hasn’t experienced significant 
technical or order fulfillment glitches since.
In 2008, Threadless was featured on the cover of inc. 
as “The Most Innovative Small Company in America.” 
It is credited with creating the online buiness model 
referred to as “crowdsourcing.” Crowdsourcing is the 
process of soliciting ideas or services from a large group 
of people, called the crowd, rather than from traditional 
employees. A number of companies now utilize the 
crowdsourcing model. Many advertise themselves as the 
“Threadless” of their industry.
Questions for Critical Thinking
 1. Do you think Threadless would exist today if Nickell 
and Dehart hadn’t taken decisive action in 2005 and 
brought Insight Partners into the company as a strate-
gic investor? Why or why not?
 2. Why do you think Nickell and Dehart wanted a stra-
tegic investor to help Threadless work through its 
operational problems rather than hire a consulting 
firm? hiring a consulting firm wouldn’t have required 
Threadless to surrender any equity.
 3. Name at least two companies that are using crowd-
sourcing business models, similar to the model that 
Threadless pioneered in the early 2000s. how are the 
business models and the companies behind them 
performing?
 4. Look at the “You Be the VC” feature at the end of 
Chapters 13 and 14. Which company do you think has 
the highest likelihood of experiencing rapid growth? 
What can that company do to avoid the problems that 
Threadless experienced?

t
hreadless is a community-centered T-shirt design site 
started in 2000 by Jack Nickell and Jacob Dehart with 
$1,000 of their own money. It’s called “Threadless” 
because it started as a thread on the Dreamlist message 
board. Dreamlist was a place where designers could 
exchange information, and in November 2000, Nickell 
hosted a T-shirt design contest and let fellow designers 
pick the winner. The contest was such a hit that Nickell 
and Dehart decided to move it off the Dreamlist message 
board for the purpose of creating a website where future 
contests could be hosted.
Threadless was run as a hobby for most of 2001 
through 2003, until Nickell and Dehart quit their jobs to 
start a Web consultancy firm and focus more intently on 
Threadless. The income they earned from Threadless 
quickly overshadowed what they were earning from the 
consultancy business, so in January 2004, they started 
focusing on Threadless full time. The way Threadless 
works is that each week about 1,000 designs are submit-
ted online and are put up to a public vote. After seven 
days the Threadless staff reviews the top-scoring designs. 
Based on the average score and community feedback, 
about 10 designs are selected each week. The designs are 
then printed on clothing and other products and are sold 
through Threadless’s online store and at their retail store in 
Chicago. Designers whose work is chosen receive $2,000 
in cash and $500 in Threadless gift cards. Each time a de-
sign is reprinted, the designer received an additional $500.
Threadless grew quickly. In 2005, it sold over one mil-
lion T-shirts—all designed by the Threadless community. 
Nickell and Dehart were experiencing difficulties man-
aging the growth. The firm’s back-end operations were 
the main problem. Orders weren’t going out on time, the 
Threadless website was down intermittently, and some 
months the company would max out the amount it could 
process through its merchant account and would have 
to stop taking orders. Worst of all, in 2005, T-shirts that 
were ordered in anticipation of Christmas weren’t deliv-
ered until the following January.
Rather than collapsing under the weight of these 
problems, Nickell and Dehart took bold action. They sold 
a minority interest in Threadless to Insight Partners, a 
venture capital firm. They could have hired a consulting 
firm with operational expertise, but they wanted a partner 
that would have a long-term interest in Threadless’s suc-
cess. Insight Partners turned out to be an ideal choice. At 
that time, Insight had a program called Insight Onsight,

for growth that presents itself, the business can easily stray into areas where it 
finds itself at a competitive disadvantage. For example, eBags, an online mer-
chant that specializes in selling handbags, luggage, and backpacks, at one point 
acquired a website that sells shoes. After three years, it sold the site (Shoedini.
com) to Zappos after concluding that the shoe business was too far of a stretch 
from the company’s core strategy and its core competencies.
The way most businesses typically evolve is to start by selling a product 
or service that is consistent with their core strategy and then increase sales 
by incrementally moving into areas that are different from, but are related to, 
their strengths and core capabilities. This is how Zappos opeerates. The com-
pany started by selling shoes and has gradually expanded into clothing, bags, 
housewares, and many other products. The success of its new product lines 
will be determined largely by whether the company’s existing core competen-
cies are sufficient to profitably sell these items. If they aren’t, then Zappos 
will have to develop or acquire additional core competencies, or it is likely to 
struggle to effectively manage its growth.
A parable that helps affirm why sticking to a core strategy is so important 
is provided by Jim Collins in his book Good to Great. In the book, Collins re-
tells the fable of the fox and the hedgehog, which was originally told by Isaiah 
Berlin. According to the fable, because he is sly, cunning, and strong, everyone 
thinks the fox is better than the hedgehog. All the lowly hedgehog knows how 
to do is one thing—curl up in a ball, with its spikes out, to deter intruders. The 
ironic thing is that whatever the fox does, and no matter how many of its 100 
tricks it tries to use, the hedgehog always wins, because it knows how to do 
one thing well—roll up and stick its spikes out. In Good to Great, Collins says 
businesses that are successful over the long haul are more like hedgehogs 
than foxes. Rather than moving swiftly in all directions, like foxes, successful 
businesses keep their heads down and do one thing particularly well. Like the 
hedgehog, they see what is essential and ignore the rest.12
planning for growth
The third thing that a firm can do to prepare for growth is to establish growth-
related plans.13 This task involves a firm thinking ahead and anticipating the 
type and amount of growth it wants to achieve.
The process of writing a business plan, covered in Chapter 6, greatly as-
sists in developing growth-related plans. A business plan normally includes 
a detailed forecast of a firm’s first three to five years of sales, along with an 
operations plan that describes the resources the business will need to meet its 
projections. Even though a business will undoubtedly change during its first 
three to five years, it’s still good to have a plan. Many businesses periodically 
revise their business plans as a foundation for helping them guide their growth-
related decisions.
It’s also important for a business to determine, as early as possible, the 
strategies it will choose to employ as a means of pursuing growth. For ex-
ample, Proactiv, the acne medicine company, is a single-product company 
and has grown by steadily increasing its domestic sales, introducing its prod-
ucts into foreign countries, and by encouraging nontraditional users of acne 
medicine, like adult males, to use its product. Proactiv’s decision to stick with 
one product and to avoid growing through initiatives such as acquisitions 
and licensing has allowed the company to focus on marketing and building 
its brand. In contrast, uShip, the subject of Case 13.2, has expanded into a 
number of new product lines since it launched in 2003. It is still primarily 
an online marketplace for shipping services, but has grown through a variety 
of avenues. For example, in 2011 eBay Motors began incorporating uShip’s 
Shipping Price Estimator as a vehicle shipping option within all of its U.S. car, 
motorcycle, and power sports listings.14

470    PART 4 | MANAGING AND GROWING AN ENTREPRENEURIAL FIRM
On a more personal level, a business owner should step back and measure 
the company’s growth plans against his or her personal goals and aspirations. 
The old adage, “Be careful what you wish for,” is as true in business as it is in 
other areas of life. For example, if a business has the potential to grow rapidly, 
the owner should know what to expect if the fast-growth route is chosen. Fast 
growth normally implies a quick pace of activity, a rapidly rising overhead, and 
a total commitment in terms of time and attention on the part of the business 
owners. The upside is that if the business is successful, the owner will nor-
mally do very well financially. The downside is long hours and time away from 
family. Commenting on the balancing act that many fast-growth entrepreneurs 
experience, Felix Lluberes, president and co-founder of Position Logic, a GPS 
tracking software company, said:
“The biggest challenge (in growing a company) is keeping your family happy and 
constantly deciding when to miss important family events because work demands 
it. Working hard is not a sacrifice as long as you achieve your ultimate objective.”15
The trade-offs implied by this scenario are acceptable to some business owners 
and aren’t to others.
reasons for growth
Although sustained, profitable growth is almost always the result of deliber-
ate intentions and careful planning, firms cannot always choose their pace of 
growth. A firm’s pace of growth is the rate at which it is growing on an annual 
basis. Sometimes firms are forced into a high-growth mode sooner than they 
would like. For example, when a firm develops a product or service that satis-
fies a need for many customers and orders roll in very quickly, it must adjust 
quickly or risk faltering. In other instances, a firm experiences unexpected 
competition and must grow to maintain its market share.
This section examines the six primary reasons firms try to grow to increase 
their profitability and valuation, as depicted in Figure 13.1.

capturing economies of scale
Economies of scale are generated when increasing production lowers the av-
erage cost of each unit produced. Economies of scale can be created in service 
firms as well as traditional manufacturing companies.16 This phenomenon 
occurs for two reasons. First, if a company can get a discount by buying com-
ponent parts in bulk, it can lower its variable costs per unit as it grows larger. 
Variable costs are the costs a company incurs as it generates sales. Second, 
by increasing production, a company can spread its fixed costs over a greater 
number of units. Fixed costs are costs that a company incurs whether it sells 
something or not. For example, in a manufacturing setting, it may cost a com-
pany $10,000 per month to air-condition its factory. The air-conditioning cost 
is fixed; cooling the factory will cost the same whether the company produces 
10 or 10,000 units per month. In a service setting, a hotel’s registration areas, 
restaurants, and other areas must be air-conditioned regardless of the number 
of rooms that have been filled for a particular evening.
A related reason firms grow is to make use of unused resources such as labor 
capacity and a host of others. For example, a firm may need exactly 2.5 full-time 
salespeople to fully cover its trade area. Because a firm obviously can’t hire 2.5 
full-time salespeople, it may hire 3 salespeople and expand its trade area.17
capturing economies of scope
Economies of scope are similar to economies of scale. With economies of scope, 
the advantage a firm accrues comes through the scope (or range) of a firm’s op-
erations rather than from its scale of production.18 For example, a company’s 
sales force may be able to sell 10 items more efficiently than 5 because the cost 
of travel and the salesperson’s salary is spread out over 10 products rather than 
5. Similarly, a company such as TOMS, the focus of Case 4.2, captures econo-
mies of scope in its advertising when the same feature is used to advertise TOMS 
shoes along with TOMS eyewear and TOMS coffee.
Market leadership
Market leadership occurs when a firm holds the number one or the number 
two position in an industry or niche market in terms of sales volume. Many 
firms work hard to achieve market leadership, to realize economies of scale and 
economies of scope, and to be recognized as the brand leader. Being the market 
leader also permits a firm to use slogans such as “Number 1 App in the Apple 
App Store” in its promotions, helping it win customers and attract talented em-
ployees as well as business partners.
influence, power, and survivability
Larger businesses usually have more influence and power than smaller firms 
in regard to setting standards for an industry, getting a “foot in the door” with 
major customers and suppliers, and garnering prestige. In addition, larger

Appropriate Reasons 
for Firm Growth

472    PART 4 | MANAGING AND GROWING AN ENTREPRENEURIAL FIRM
businesses can typically make a mistake yet survive more easily than entre-
preneurial ventures. Commenting on this issue, Jack Welch, GE’s former CEO, 
once said, “Size gives us another big advantage; our reach and resources enable 
us to go to bat more frequently, to take more swings, to experiment more, and 
unlike a small company, we can miss on occasion and get to swing again.”19
A firm’s capacity for growth affects its survival in additional ways. For ex-
ample, a firm that stays small and relies on the efforts and motivation of its 
founder or a small group of people is vulnerable if those people leave the firm 
or lose their passion for the business. This reason was partly to blame for the 
failure of Prim, as profiled in Chapter 1. Prim failed in part because its found-
ers lost interest in the business and decided to move on to other things. As a 
firm grows and adds employees, it’s normally not as vulnerable to the loss of 
a single person or a small group of people’s participation or passion for the 
business.
need to Accommodate the growth  
of Key customers
Sometimes firms are compelled to grow to accommodate the growth of a key 
customer. For example, if Intel has a major account with an electronics firm 
buying a large number of its semiconductor chips, and the electronics firm is 
growing at a rate of 20 percent per year, Intel may have to add capacity each 
year to accommodate the growth of its customer or else risk losing some or all 
of its business.
Ability to Attract and retain talented employees
The final reason that firms grow is to attract and retain high-quality person-
nel. It is natural for talented employees to want to work for a firm that can 
offer opportunities for promotion, higher salaries, and increased levels of re-
sponsibility. Growth is a firm’s primary mechanism to generate promotional 
opportunities for employees, while failing to retain key employees can be 
very damaging to a firm’s growth efforts. High turnover is expensive, and in 
knowledge-based industries in particular, such as biotechnology and software 
development, a company’s number-one asset is the combined talent, training, 
and experience of its employees.20 In less knowledge-intensive settings, turn-
over may not be as critical, but it is still costly. The American Management 
Association estimates that the cost of hiring and training a person earning 
$8 per hour varies from 25 percent to 200 percent of annual compensation.21 
Entrepreneurial ventures rarely have the excess financial capital needed to 
support the unfavorable relationship between employee hiring and turnover. 
However, when talented individuals leave a large company either voluntarily 
or through layoffs, entrepreneurial ventures have opportunities to hire people 
with skills the venture did not pay for them to develop.
Managing growth
Many businesses are caught off guard by the challenges involved with grow-
ing their companies. One would think that if a business got off to a good 
start, steadily increased its sales, and started making money, it would get 
progressively easier to manage the growth of a firm. In many instances, just 
the opposite happens. As a business increases its sales, its pace of activ-
ity quickens, its resource needs increase, and the founders often find that 
they’re busier than ever. Major challenges can also occur.22 For example, 
a business might project its next year’s sales and realize it will need more 
learning ObjeCtive

people and additional equipment to handle the increased workload. The new 
equipment might need to be purchased and the new people hired and trained 
before the increased business generates additional income. It’s easy to imag-
ine serious discussions among the members of a new venture’s management 
team trying to figure out how that will all work out.
The reality is that a company must actively and carefully manage its growth 
for it to expand in a healthy and profitable manner. As a business grows and 
 becomes better known, there are normally more opportunities that present them-
selves, but there are more things that can go wrong too. Many potential problems 
and heartaches can be avoided by prudently managing the growth process. This 
section focuses on knowing and managing the stages of growth. The final section 
in this chapter focuses on a related topic—the challenges of growth.
Knowing and Managing the stages of growth
The majority of businesses go through a discernable set of stages referred to 
as the organizational life cycle.23 The stages, pictured in Figure 13.2, include 
introduction, early growth, continuous growth, maturity, and decline. Each 
stage must be managed differently. It’s important for an entrepreneur to be 
familiar with these stages, along with the unique opportunities and challenges 
that each stage entails.
introduction Stage  This is the start-up phase where a business deter-
mines what its strengths and core capabilities are and starts selling its initial 
product or service. It’s a very “hands-on” phase for the founder or founders, 
who are normally involved in every aspect of the day-to-day life of the busi-
ness. The business is typically very nonbureaucratic with no (or few) written 
rules or procedures. The main goal of the business is to get off to a good start 
and to try to gain momentum in the marketplace.
The main challenges for a business in the introduction stage are to make 
sure the initial product or service is right and to start laying the groundwork 
for building a larger organization. It’s important to not rush things. This senti-
ment is affirmed by April Singer, the founder of Rufus, a company that orgin-
ally only made high-end shirts for men. Before growing her business beyond 
the introduction stage, Singer made sure that her unique approach for making 
men’s shirts worked and that it resonated in the marketplace:
Before growing too much too fast, I wanted to spend two seasons making sure 
that the concept worked, that I shipped well, and that consumers liked the prod-
uct. They did.24

This affirmation gave Singer the confidence to expand her business, add addi-
tional product lines, and move into a more aggressive growth mode. In regard 
to laying the groundwork to build a larger organization, many businesses use 
the introduction stage to try different concepts to see what works and what 
doesn’t, recognizing that trial and error gets harder as a business grows. It’s 
important to document what works and start thinking about how the com-
pany’s success can be replicated when the owner isn’t present or when the 
business expands beyond its original location.
early Growth Stage  A business’s early growth stage is generally character-
ized by increasing sales and heightened complexity. The business is normally 
still focused on its initial product or service but is trying to increase its market 
share and might have related products in the works. The initial formation of 
policies and procedures takes place, and the process of running the business 
will start to consume more of the founder’s or founders’ time and attention.
For a business to be successful in this stage, two important things must 
take place. First, the founder or owner of the business must start transition-
ing from his or her role as the hands-on supervisor of every aspect of the 
business to a more managerial role. As articulated by Michael E. Gerber in 
his excellent book The E-Myth Revisited, the owner must start working “on 
the business” rather than “in the business.”25 The basic idea is that early in 
the life of a business, the owner typically is directly involved in building the 
product or delivering the service that the business provides. As the business 
moves into the early growth stage, the owner must let go of that role and 
spend more time learning how to manage and build the business. If the owner 
isn’t willing to make this transition or doesn’t know it needs to be made, the 
business will never grow beyond the owner’s ability to directly supervise ev-
erything that takes place, and the business’s growth will eventually stall.
The second thing that must take place for a business to be successful in 
the early growth stage is that increased formalization must take place. The 
business has to start developing policies and procedures that tell employees 
how to run it when the founders or other top managers aren’t present. This is 
how franchise restaurants run so well when they’re staffed by what appears to 
be a group of teenagers. The employees are simply following well-documented 
policies and procedures. This task was clearly on the mind of Emily Levy, the 
founder of EBL Coaching, a tutoring service for children who are struggling in 
school or trying to overcome disabilities, when she was asked by Ladies Who 
Launch (a support network for female entrepreneurs) early in the life of her 
business about her growth plans:
My future goals include continuing to spread EBL Coaching’s programs nationally, 
using our proprietary materials and self-contained multisensory methods. I have 
already developed a series of workbooks, called “Strategies for Success,” addressing 
specific study skills strategies, that are being used in a number of schools across 
the country. The real challenge will be figuring out how to replicate our programs 
while maintaining our high quality of teaching and personalized approach.26
Continuous Growth Stage  The need for structure and more formal re-
lationships increases as a business moves beyond its early growth stage and 
its pace of growth accelerates. The resource requirements of the business are 
usually a major concern, along with the ability of the owner and manager to 
take the firm to the next level. Often the business will start developing new 
products and services and will expand to new markets. Smaller firms may 
be acquired, and the business might start more aggressively partnering with 
other firms. When handled correctly, the business’s expansion will be in areas 
that are related to its strengths and core capabilities, or it will develop new 
strengths and capabilities to complement its activities.

ChAPTER 13 | PREPARING FOR AND Evaluating ThE ChALLENGES OF GROWTh    475
The toughest decisions are typically made in the continuous growth stage. 
One tough decision is whether the owner of the business and the current 
management team have the experience and ability to take the firm any fur-
ther. This scenario played out for Rachel Ashwell, the founder of Shabby Chic, 
a home furnishing business. Ashwell expanded her company to five separate 
locations, inked a licensing deal with Target, wrote five how-to books related 
to her business, and hosted her own television show on the Style Network 
before concluding that her business had stalled. Her choice was to continue 
running the business or find more experienced management to grow it fur-
ther. She opted for the latter, which reignited the company’s growth.27
The importance of developing policies and procedures increases during 
the continuous growth stage. It’s also important for a business to develop 
a formal organizational structure and determine clear lines of delegation 
throughout the business. Well-developed policies and procedures lead to or-
der, which typically makes the process of growing a business more organized 
and successful.
Maturity Stage  A business enters the maturity stage when its growth slows. 
At this point, the firm typically focuses more intently on efficiently managing the 
products and services it has rather than expanding in new areas. Innovation 
slows. Formal policies and procedures, although important, can become an im-
pediment if they are too rigid and strict.28 It’s important that the firm continues 
to adapt and that the founders, managers, and employees remain passionate 
about the products and services that are being sold. If this doesn’t happen, a 
firm can easily slip into a no-growth situation.
A well-managed firm that finds its products and services are mature often 
looks for partnering or acquisition opportunities to breathe new life into the 
firm. For example, Coca-Cola, a firm in the maturity stage of its life cycle, has 
a long history of acquisitions. It acquired Minute Made in 1960, the Indian cola 
brand Thums Up in 1993, the Odwalla brand of fruit juices, smoothies, and 
bars in 2001, and Fuze Beverages in 2007. In August, 2014, Coca-Cola paid 
$2.15 billion to take a 16.7 percent ownership stake in Monster Beverage, the 
energy drink company.
If a company does grow organically while in the maturity stage, it normally 
focuses on the “next generation” of products it already sells rather than invest-
ing in new or related products or services.
Decline Stage  It is not inevitable that a business enter the decline stage 
and either deteriorate or die. Many American businesses have long histories 
and have thrived by adapting to environmental change and by selling products 
that remain important to customers. Eventually all businesses’ products or 
services will be threatened by more relevant and innovative products. When 
this happens, a business’s ability to avoid decline depends on the strength of 
its leadership and its ability to appropriately respond.
A firm can also enter the decline stage if it loses its sense of purpose or 
spreads itself so thin that it no longer has a competitive advantage in any of its 
markets. A firm’s management team should be aware of these potential pitfalls 
and guard against allowing them to happen.
A framework that is similar to the organizational life cycle is the technol-
ogy adoption life cycle, which is suited primarily for technology firms that 
are introducing disruptive innovations to the market. The technology life 
cycle is associated with the concept of “crossing the chasm,” which  explains 
why some technology products reach mainstream markets while others 
don’t. An explanation of the technology life cycle, the concept of “crossing 
the chasm,” and an example of a start-up that successfully crossed the 
chasm and reached mainstream markets is provided in the nearby “Savvy 
Entrepreneurial Firm” feature.

476    PART 4 | MANAGING AND GROWING AN ENTREPRENEURIAL FIRM
I
n 1991, Geoffrey A. Moore, a lecturer and management 
consultant, wrote an influential book titled Crossing 
the Chasm. The book became an instant must-read for 
managers, entrepreneurs, and investors. The book was 
updated in 2009 and again in 2014. It has been described 
as the bible for understanding why some technology-
oriented start-ups grow into large firms while others stall 
or languish in terms of adoption and firm growth.
The book’s premise is that there is a chasm be-
tween the early adopters of a product (the technology 
enthusiasts and visionaries) and the early majority (the 
pragmatists). The key insight is that to cross the chasm, 
firms must first dominate a niche of early adopters and 
expand from a position of strength. The concept is related 
to the technology adoption life cycle. The stages in the 
technology adoption life cycle are innovators, early adopt-
ers, early majority, late majority, and laggards. Start-up 
products initially appeal to “innovators,” who are people 
who like to try new things but are seldom willing to spend 
much. Then come the early adopters, or visionaries, who 
are willing to take a chance on a new product if it solves a 
burning problem. After the early adopters come the early 
majority, which is the largest segment. The early majority 
will only buy if a product is complete and is heavily recom-
mended by others. If it’s not recommended, they won’t 
buy, regardless of how well a product suits their needs. 
Next is the late majority, which buys only after a product 
has become the standard. The laggards, which bring up 
the rear, rarely buy.
The chasm is hard to cross. Ironically, it is not the early 
adopters that convince the early majority to buy. In fact, 
the early majority typically mistrusts the enthusiasm of vi-
sionaries. They start buying when credibility is established 
and momentum within their own group starts to build. In 
his book, Moore suggests techniques to successfully ap-
peal to the early majority, and cross the chasm, including 
issues pertaining to a firm’s target market, its positioning 
strategy, its marketing strategy, and a number of other im-
portant factors. It’s well worth the time to read the book to 
learn the techniques and capture the subtleties.
Salesforce.com is an example of a company that has 
crossed the chasm. Prior to Salesforce.com, software 
was a product that was sold on disks that clients would 
install on their computers. The software would then need 
to be integrated into the clients’ system, which typically 
cost more than the software itself. By the time the soft-
ware was installed, there were often updates available. 
Many clients would forgo installing the updates, at least 
for a period of time, to simply avoid the additional hassle 
and expense of installing them.
Salesforce.com introduced a better way. Its bet-
ter way was software-as-a-service, later abbreviated as 
SaaS. The idea was that instead of selling software on 
disks to be installed on a client’s computers, there would 
be only one copy of the software, running on Salesforce.
com computers, which multiple users could access si-
multaneously via the Internet. The sales pitch was com-
pelling. By adopting Salesforce.com’s solution, a client 
would no longer incur the costs and headaches involved 
with installing, updating, and maintaining software.
What’s interesting is the way Salesforce.com man-
aged the rollout of the product and how the firm even-
tually crossed the chasm. In regard to the rollout, the 
company picked a single market to go after, salespeople, 
and no one else. There was nothing in the product for 
marketing, customer service, or any other division in a 
company. Salesforce.com focused exclusively on the 
United States as its target market, partly to stay close to 
their customer. The firm also chose to initially target tech-
savvy industries. The result was a product designed to 
achieve a singular objective—helping salespeople make 
their quota. As a result, salespeople loved it. And be-
cause they loved it, they told other salespeople about it, 
and adoption grew virally. The number of early adopters 
grew. Credibility was built as the product was displayed 
at tradeshows and was talked about in mainstream me-
dia. Eventually, companies such as Merrill Lynch saw 
the merits of the service and signed on. Salesforce.com 
crossed the chasm and started appealing to the early 
majority and a wider number of users.
The irony of the Salesforce.com story, which is the 
essence of Moore’s insight, is that by picking a single 
niche market, and establishing sufficient credibility that 
the early majority took notice, Salesforce.com was able 
to cross the chasm faster than it would have if it had 
created a much more robust product initially and tried to 
appeal to a broader cross-section of markets.
Questions for Critical Thinking
 1. Select at least two other firms that you believe have 
crossed the chasm. Briefly summarize how the firms 
rolled out their products (or services) and what you be-
lieve their key steps were in successfully crossing the 
chasm.
 2. In contrast to question #1, list at least two start-ups 
that you are familiar with that produced products or 
services that you believe never crossed the chasm. 
Briefly describe why you believe they never crossed 
the chasm.
 3. Do you believe consumer products cross the chasm (or 
fail to cross the chasm) much like technology products?
 4. In regard to adopting technology products, do you 
see yourself as an early adopter or as part of the early 
majority? how does your answer affect the manner in 
which you buy technology products?

Challenges of growth
There is a consistent set of challenges that affect all stages of a firm’s growth. 
The challenges typically become more acute as a business grows, but a busi-
ness’s founder or founders and managers also become more savvy and experi-
enced with the passage of time. The challenges illustrate that no firm grows in a 
competitive vacuum.29 As a business grows and takes market share away from 
rival firms, there will be a certain amount of retaliation that takes place. This is 
an aspect of competition that a business owner needs to be aware of and plan 
for. Competitive retaliation normally increases as a business grows and becomes 
a larger threat to its rivals.
This section is divided into two parts. The first part focuses on the mana-
gerial capacity problem, which is a framework for thinking about the overall 
challenge of growing a firm. The second part focuses on the four most common 
day-to-day challenges of growing a business.
Managerial capacity
In her thoughtful and seminal book The Theory of the Growth of the Firm, 
Edith T. Penrose argues that firms are collections of productive resources that 
are organized in an administrative framework.30 As an administrative frame-
work, the primary purpose of a firm is to package its resources together with 
resources acquired outside the firm as a foundation for being able to produce 
products and services at a profit. As a firm goes about its routine activities, 
the management team becomes better acquainted with the firm’s resources 
and its markets. This knowledge leads to the expansion of a firm’s productive 
opportunity set, which is the set of opportunities the firm feels it’s capable of 
pursuing. The opportunities might include the introduction of new products, 
geographic expansion, licensing products to other firms, exporting, and so on. 
The pursuit of these new opportunities causes a firm to grow.
Penrose points out, however, that there is a problem with the execution of 
this simple logic. The firm’s administrative framework consists of two kinds of 
services that are important to a firm’s growth—entrepreneurial services and 
managerial services. Entrepreneurial services generate new market, product, 
and service ideas, while managerial services administer the routine functions 
of the firm and facilitate the profitable execution of new opportunities. However, 
the introduction of new product and service ideas requires substantial manage-
rial services (or managerial “capacity”) to be properly implemented and super-
vised. This is a complex problem because if a firm has insufficient managerial 
services to properly implement its entrepreneurial ideas, it can’t quickly hire 
new managers to remedy the shortfall. It is expensive to hire new employees, 
and it takes time for new managers to be socialized into the firm’s culture, ac-
quire firm-specific skills and knowledge, and establish trusting relationships 
with other members of their firms.31 When a firm’s managerial resources are 
insufficient to take advantage of its new product and services opportunities, the 
subsequent bottleneck is referred to as the managerial capacity problem.
As the entrepreneurial venture grows, it encounters the dual challenges 
of adverse selection and moral hazard. Adverse selection means that as the 
number of employees a firm needs increases, it becomes increasingly difficult 
for it to find the right employees, place them in appropriate positions, and pro-
vide adequate supervision.32 The faster a firm grows, the less time managers 
have to evaluate the suitability of job candidates and the higher the chances 
are that an unsuitable candidate will be chosen. Selecting “ineffective” or “un-
suitable” employees increases the venture’s costs. Moral hazard means that 
as a firm grows and adds personnel, the new hires typically do not have the 
same ownership incentives as the original founders, so the new hires may not 
be as motivated as the founders to put in long hours or may even try to avoid 
learning ObjeCtive

those of adverse selection 
and moral hazard.

hard work.33 To make sure the new hires are doing what they are employed 
to do, the firm will typically hire monitors (i.e., managers) to supervise the 
employees. This practice creates a hierarchy that is costly and isolates the top 
management team from its rank-and-file employees.
The basic model of firm growth articulated by Penrose is shown in Figure 13.3 
while Figure 13.4 shows the essence of the growth-limiting managerial capacity 
problem.34 Figure 13.4 indicates that the ability to increase managerial services 
is not friction free. It is constrained or limited by (1) the time required to socialize 
new managers, (2) how motivated entrepreneurs and/or managers are to grow 
their firms, (3) adverse selection, and (4) moral hazard.
Wesabe, the focus of this chapter’s “What Went Wrong?” feature, suffered 
as a result of trying to build out its own capabilities or managerial capacity in 
a key area rather than partnering with a company that was willing to license it 
the capability. A competitor licensed the technology and sped ahead of Wesabe. 
Wesabe’s own attempt to build out the capability took longer than it thought it 
would, and it never recovered.
The reality of the managerial capacity problem is one of the main reasons 
that entrepreneurs and managers worry so much about growth. Growth is a 
generally positive thing, but it is easy for a firm to overshoot its capacity to man-
age growth in ways that will diminish the venture’s sales revenues and profits.
Day-to-Day challenges of growing a Firm
Along with the overarching challenges imposed by the managerial capacity 
problem, there are a number of day-to-day challenges involved with growing a 
firm. The following is a discussion of the four most common challenges.
Cash Flow Management  As discussed in Chapters 8 and 10, as a firm 
grows, it requires an increasing amount of cash to service its customers. In

addition, a firm must carefully manage its cash on hand to make sure it main-
tains sufficient liquidity to meet its payroll and cover its other short-term obli-
gations. There are many colorful anecdotes about business founders who have 
had to rush to a bank and get a second mortgage on their houses to cover their 
business’s payroll. This usually occurs when a business takes on too much 
work, and its customers are slow to pay. A business can literally have $1 mil-
lion in accounts receivable but not be able to meet a $25,000 payroll. This is 
why almost any book you pick up about growing a business stresses the im-
portance of properly managing a firm’s cash flow.
Growth usually increases rather than decreases the challenges involved 
with cash flow management because an increase in sales means that more 
cash will be flowing into and out of the firm. Growth is also expensive, in that 
it often involves investing more money in operations, marketing, administra-
tive processes (to better track accounts payable and receivable), and personnel. 
This point is made by Vinny Antonio, president of Victory Marketing Agency:
“Cash flow management for a rapidly growing, bootstrapped company can be harder 
than the world’s most difficult Sudoku puzzle. It’s almost a full-time job staying on 
top of who owes you what and who you owe, and then priortizing those payments. 
All the while, you’re pushing for more growth, but with that comes additional ex-
penses—most notably, your executive team. Good talent doesn’t come cheap, and 
you often have to find creative ways to lure the right personnel to your team.”35
Some firms raise the cash needed to fund growth via investors or a line of 
credit at a bank. Other firms deliberately restrict the pace of their growth to 
avoid cash flow challenges.
Price Stability  If firm growth comes at the expense of a competitor’s market 
share, price competition can set in. For example, if an entrepreneur opened a 
fast-casual restaurant near a Panera Bread that started eroding the Panera 
Bread’s market share, Panera Bread would probably fight back by running pro-
motions or lowering prices. This type of scenario places a new firm in a difficult

I
n November 2006, Wesabe launched a site to help 
people manage their personal finances. While it wasn’t 
the first personal finance site on the Web, it was the 
first to use a Web 2.0 approach. The site automatically 
aggregated and stored all of its users’ financial accounts 
and, most especially, was able to “learn” from the accu-
mulated data its users uploaded to make recommenda-
tions for better financial decisions. Because of its helpful 
functionality, Wesabe got off to a good start and, until 
September 2007, was considered the leader in online 
personal finance. Then Mint.com launched, and from 
that point forward, Wesabe was in second place at best. 
Two years later, Mint was acquired by Intuit for $170 
million—one of the fastest and most successful exits in 
software history. In contrast, just short of a year later, 
Wesabe shut down.
What Went Wrong?
Marc hedlund, one of Wesabe’s co-founders, wrote a 
thoughtful blog post about Wesabe’s failure. While he 
attributes Wesabe’s failure to several factors, two are 
prominent in hedlund’s opinion. The first speaks to the 
importance of allowing partners to build some of a firm’s 
capabilities or managerial capacity, while the second fo-
cuses on the importance of a first mover remaining sharp 
and competitive in light of inevitable competition.
The first mistake Wesabe made is that it chose not 
to partner with Yodlee. Yodlee is a company that pro-
vides account aggregation services, which is a highly 
technical business. If a user is willing to provide his or 
her account-access information (account numbers, user 
IDs, and passwords) for bank accounts, credit cards, and 
investment accounts, Yodlee can “scrape” the appropri-
ate sites and compile all the information in one place. 
Yodlee was a tough negotiator so Wesabe decided not 
to tie itself to Yodlee, even though Yodlee could deliver to 
Wesabe a huge capability it needed. Mint.com partnered 
with Yodlee out of the gates and, as a result, it was easy 
for its users to populate their Mint.com accounts with 
their financial information. Wesabe built its own data 
acquisition system, which took longer and wasn’t as 
elegant. Wesabe eventually launched a Yodlee-like Web 
interface, but it didn’t come online until six months after 
Mint.com went live. In retrospect, hedlund believes that 
passing on Yodlee was probably enough to kill Wesabe. It 
should have known that if it didn’t use Yodlee, a competi-
tor would come along that would. That would have been 
okay if Wesabe had had a solution as capable as Yodlee. 
But it didn’t, and the minute users looked at side-by-side 
comparisons of Wesabe versus Mint.com, Wesabe was 
at a disadvantage in that its product’s functionality wasn’t 
as solid as what was available from a competitor.
The second mistake Wesabe made was misunder-
standing its users. Wesabe deliberately forced people 
to do some of the data entry and other work on the site 
themselves, thinking that forcing users to get close to 
their data would change their financial behavior—for 
the better. Mint.com did just the opposite. It focused on 
making the user do almost no work at all, by automating 
all key processes and giving them instant gratification. 
As a result, Wesabe’s site was perceived as “harder to 
use” than Mint.com’s. While Wesabe’s intentions may 
have been noble, it misread its users. As hard as it is to 
admit, users were more interested in expediency and an 
elegant interface than performing the hard work of get-
ting close to their financial data.
The combination of Mint’s better data aggregation 
method (via Yodlee) and the higher amount of work that 
Wesabe made the user do gave users a better experi-
ence on Mint versus Wesabe. Although Wesabe had 
the first-mover advantage, Mint simply outcompeted 
Wesabe and gained the upper hand.
Questions for Critical Thinking
 1. Why do you think Wesabe opted not to use Yodlee 
and to build its own account aggregation services? 
Similarly, why do you think Mint.com jumped at the 
chance to partner with Yodlee?
 2. how does an entrepreneurial firm find the right bal-
ance between not “overestimating” its capabilities (i.e., 
Wesabe thought it could build an account aggregation 
service faster than it did) and still be willing to do much

How Trying to Build Out Its Own Capabilities in a Key Area Contributed

predicament and illustrates why it’s important to start a business by selling a 
differentiated product to a clearly defined target market. There is no good way 
for a small firm to compete head-to-head against a much larger rival on price. 
The best thing for a small firm to do is to avoid price competition by serving a 
different market and by serving that market particularly well.
Quality Control  One of the most difficult challenges that businesses en-
counter as they grow is maintaining high levels of quality and customer ser-
vice. As a firm grows, it handles more service requests and paperwork and 
contends with an increasing number of prospects, customers, vendors, and 
other stakeholders. If a business can’t build its infrastructure fast enough to 
handle the increased activity, quality and customer service will usually suffer. 
What happens to many businesses is that they run into the classic chicken-
or-egg quandary. It’s hard to justify hiring additional employees or leasing 
more office space until the need is present, but if the business waits until 
the need is present, it usually won’t have enough employees or office space to 
properly service new customers.
There is no easy way to resolve this type of quandary other than to recog-
nize that it may take place and to plan for it in the best way possible. Many 
businesses find innovative ways to expand their capacity to try to avoid short-
falls in quality control or customer service.
Capital Constraints  Although many businesses are started fairly inexpen-
sively, the need for capital is typically the most prevalent in the early growth and 
continuous growth stages of the organizational life cycle. The amount of capital 
required varies widely among businesses. Some businesses, like restaurant 
chains, might need considerable capital to hire employees, construct buildings, 
and purchase equipment. If they can’t raise the capital they need, their growth 
will be stymied.
Most businesses, regardless of their industry, need capital from time to 
time to invest in growth-enabling projects. Their ability to raise capital, whether 
it’s through internally generated funds, through a bank, or from investors, will 
determine in part whether their growth plans proceed.

 lO1. Sustained growth is defined as growth 
in both revenues and profits over an ex-
tended period of time. Successfully grow-
ing a business is a function of preparation, 
good management, and an appreciation of 
the issues involved. The three primary 
things that a business can do to prepare 
for growth are appreciating the nature of 
business growth, staying committed to a 
core strategy, and planning for growth. In 
this sense, firm growth is not a random or 
chance event. It is something firms pur-
sue deliberately.
 lO2. The six most common reasons that firms 
grow in an effort to increase their profit-
ability and valuation are to: (1) capture 
economies of scale (which are generated

and eventually comes to a halt, as does its 
ability to generate product or service in-
novations. In the decline stage, the firm’s 
sales begin falling rather dramatically. In 
addition, the quality of the firm’s relation-
ships with stakeholders such as custom-
ers, suppliers, employees, and financial 
institutions begin to suffer.
 lO4. There is a consistent set of challenges 
that affect each and every stage of a firm’s 
growth. The first of these challenges is 
known as the managerial capacity prob-
lem. This particular problem suggests that 
firm growth is limited by the managerial 
capacity (i.e., personnel, expertise, and in-
tellectual resources) that firms have avail-
able to implement new business ideas. The 
basic idea is that it does a firm little good 
to have exciting ideas about growth when 
it lacks the managerial capacity to imple-
ment its ideas. The second core challenge 
has four parts; collectively, these are cat-
egorized as the day-to-day growth- related 
challenges that firms encounter. The day-
to-day challenges of managing growth in-
clude cash flow management (the chal-
lenge of continuously verifying that the 
firm has sufficient cash on hand to meet 
its needs), price stability (this challenge 
surfaces when a firm competes success-
fully against larger competitors who re-
spond by making the new venture compete 
on the basis of price, a competitive dimen-
sion on which it is at a disadvantage com-
pared to large, established competitors), 
quality control (with growth, the entrepre-
neurial venture may find it increasingly 
difficult to maintain the quality of its prod-
uct or service as demanded by customers), 
and capital constraints (here the challenge 
is to find the financial capital needed to 
support early and hopefully continuous 
firm growth).
serve an important customer’s expanding 
demand for the firm’s product or service); 
and (6) maintain an ability to attract and 
retain talented employees (the most desir-
able employees want to work for a firm in 
which learning and growth opportunities 
will be readily available to them).
 lO3. Many businesses are caught off guard by 
the challenges involved with growing and 
managing their companies. As a busi-
ness increases its sales, its pace of activ-
ity quickens, its resource needs increase, 
and the founders often find that they’re 
busier than ever. Evidence indicates that 
the majority of businesses go through a 
discernable set of stages referred to as 
the organizational life cycle. The stages 
include introduction, early growth, con-
tinuous growth, maturity, and decline. 
The introduction phase is where a busi-
ness determines what its strengths and 
core capabilities are and starts selling its 
initial product or service. The business 
is typically very nonbureaucratic with no 
(or few) written rules or procedures. The 
main goal of the business is to get off to 
a good start and try to gain momentum 
in the marketplace. A business’s early 
growth stage is characterized by increas-
ing sales and heightened complexity. For 
a business to succeed in this stage (1) the 
founder or owner of the business must 
start transforming from his or her role as 
the hands-on supervisor of every aspect 
of the business to a more managerial role, 
and (2) increased formalization must take 
place. The toughest decisions are typically 
made in the continuous growth stage. 
One tough decision is whether the owner 
of the business and the current manage-
ment team have the experience and abil-
ity to take the firm any further. In the 
maturity stage, the firm’s growth slows

Business idea: Launch an online subscription service 
that provides men basic but functional razors at a deep 
discount from brand-name razors purchased at retail 
stores.
pitch: A common irritant for men is buying razor 
blades. Not only are they costly, but men often run out 
of serviceable blades at the most inopportune time, 
which requires a hasty trip to the store. Because razor 
blades require constant replacement, and are relatively 
expensive, they are often depicted by marketers as the 
perfect consumer product. There is even the old joke, 
which is more than just tongue and cheek, that the razor 
blade companies would gladly give away razors just to 
lock more people into buying replacement blades.
Enter the Dollar Shave Club. In March 2012, the Dollar 
Shave Club debuted in a cheeky video featuring co-
founder Mike Dubin walking briskly through a warehouse 
making wisecracks and encouraging men to quit spend-
ing $20 a month on brand-name razors. his alternative—
buy razors from him on a monthly subscription plan 
for as little as $2 per month. The video has now been 
watched more than 13 million times. It’s even won sev-
eral awards, including the “Best Out-of-Nowhere Video 
Campaign” at the 2012 AdAge Viral Video Awards.
The Dollar Shave Club has a simple and straightforward 
premise: manufacture basic but usable razors in Asia 
and sell them through a monthly subscription service at 
significant discounts. It has three categories of blades: 
The humble Twin, The 4X, and The Executive. The 
humble Twin, which is the base model, includes two 
stainless steel blades, a lubricating strip that smooths 
and moisturizes the skin, and a shallow pivot head and a 
handle. A subscriber gets five cartridges a month for $1 
(thus, the name Dollar Shave Club). Subscription plans 
for the 4X and The Executive cost $6 and $9 a month, 
respectively, and include additional features, such as a 
more robust blade. Shipping and handling is free. Every 
member gets a free compatible handle. Subscribers can 
cancel their subscription at any time. The company’s 
razor blades are not only less expensive than competi-
tors, but also provide men the opportunity for a cleaner 
shave by using fresher blades more often. Many men, to 
save money and another trip to a store, milk their blades 
for as long as possible. Dollar Shave Club blades are 
delivered directly to a subscriber’s doorstep and a sub-
scription includes enough cartridges a month to always 
be shaving with a relatively new blade.
In 2013, the Dollar Shave Club added two new prod-
ucts: Shave Butter and Wipes for men. The products are 
sold as add-ons to the company’s monthly subscription 
plans.

Business idea: Create a behavior management tool 
that makes it easy for elementary and secondary school 
teachers to keep their students alert and on task.
pitch: Among the most difficult tasks facing teachers is 
dealing with disruptive student behavior. In fact, some 
teachers spend more than 50 percent of their class 
time improving behavior. Bad behavior in the classroom 
is not only unsettling, but research shows that unruly 
classrooms lead to lower test scores, higher dropout 
rates, and increased behavioral problems outside the 
classroom.
Class Dojo is a behavior management platform that 
addresses this pressing problem. here’s how it works. 
Each student in a classroom has an avatar that receives 
or loses points throughout the day based on behavior. 
The classroom is equipped with a public leader board, 
which shows each avatar’s progress throughout the 
day. All the technology that’s needed is a computer 
hooked up to a projector that projects the avatars and 
their progress on the leader board. The system is built 
on a set of categories that reflect positive classroom 
behaviors. The categories include on task, teamwork, 
working hard, persistence, participating, helping others, 
and so forth. Because the categories are framed using 
positive reinforcement, the system has the ability to do 
more than just call out good behavior. For example, a 
teacher might create a category like “was able to dis-
agree with another student without sounding mean or 
insulting them.” Along with advancing a student’s avatar, 
good behavior is recognized on the leader board in writ-
ten form. For example, during a classroom exercise the 
sentence “Well done Jeremy +1 for teamwork” might 
pop up on the leader board. Research suggests the

free to the teacher and school district, which lowers the 
barrier to acceptance. The platform will be monetized 
through parents who want to use Class Dojo at home 
and pay a monthly subscription fee.

shorter the time period between an action and feedback 
for that action, the greater is the effect of reinforcement. 
Continually reinforcing good behavior, and subtracting 
points for bad behavior, makes a classroom less disrup-
tive and creates a more positive learning environment. 
Data collected by Class Dojo can be shared with parents 
and administrators.

Internet or via a smartphone. The smartphone feature al-

introduction
In early 2008, Scott Norton and Mark Ramadan, class-
mates at Brown University, were having lunch. They got 
to talking about food and stumbled on an interesting 
topic. For most types of food there are many choices. 
Just think of milk. Not only are there different brands 
of milk, but there is whole milk, 2 percent milk, and 
skim milk, along with soy milk, rice milk, and almond 
milk. The same is true for cereal, yogurt, mustard, and 
sauces. The only product they could think of where 
there is only one choice is ketchup. heinz ketchup. They 
wondered why that was the case and if there was some-
thing they could do about it.
For some reason the idea of creating a new brand 
of ketchup interested them. They started from the 
premise that they wanted to create something compel-
ling, something that they could create a brand around. 
They also wanted something that reflected their values. 
Most ketchup, they learned, is made from tomoto con-
centrate, corn syrup, vineger, and onion powder. They 
quickly decided if they made ketchup, it would be made 
from natural ingredients, such as fresh tomatoes, cane 
sugar, and real diced onions instead of onion powder. 
They started tinkering with recipes, mostly in Norton’s 
apartment. To test their early recipes, they invited their 
friends to a ketchup party. They had eight different 
ketchups and held a blind taste test. They asked their 
friends to rate each ketchup on several criteria, includ-
ing how it tastes, what the texture is like, how similar it 
is to heinz, and so forth. There were two ketchups that 
came out on top—Classic and Spicy. They thought, 
“Why don’t we make these two types of ketchups, put 
them in jars and see what happens?”
Before they went further, they thought a lot about 
branding. They instinctively knew that natural ingre-
dients and taste alone wouldn’t get the attention they 
needed. They needed their ketchup to stand out—to 
jump off the shelf at a grocery store. They imagined 
the name Sir Kensington, a fictional merchant who 
would be pictured on their bottles. They also decided to 
make their bottles and labels unique. Instead of plastic 
squeeze bottles, they elected to go with squat square 
bottles with a wide instead of a narrow top (so the 
ketchup could be spooned rather than squeezed from 
the bottle). They also designed and printed labels that 
looked as though they belonged on fine food rather than 
a ketchup bottle.
In 2009, Norton and Ramadan graduated and took 
jobs in the business world. They kept the idea of Sir 
Kensington alive and continued to work part time on 
the project. In 2010, they both left their traditional jobs 
to pursue Sir Kensington’s full time.
early growth
In June 2010, Sir Kensington’s debuted at New York’s 
annual Fancy Foods Show. After the show, Norton and 
Ramadan hit the streets, trying to make sales. Their 
efforts weren’t random. They were aware of the tech-
nology adoption life cycle and decided to apply it to 
their business. The stages in the technology adoption 
life cycle are innovators, early adopters, early majority, 
late majority, and laggards. As explained in this chap-
ter, the life cycle is often associated with the concept 
of “Crossing the Chasm,” first introduced in 1991 by 
Geoffrey A. Moore. In a nutshell, the life cycle concept 
argues that a firm should start with innovators, and

firmly establish itself in each stage before it moves 
to the next stage. The hardest transition is from early 
adopters to the early majority. Innovators and early 
adopters are people who enjoy trying new things. 
The early majority are mainstream customers. A firm 
“crosses the chasm” when it moves from early adopters 
to the early majority. A diagram of the technology adop-
tion life cycle is shown in Figure 13.5.
Consistent with the theories mentioned above, 
Norton and Ramadan targeted independent gro-
cery stores as their first adopters of Sir Kensington’s 
ketchup. Independent stores tend to appeal to “innova-
tors,” people who are looking for new choices. Norton 
and Ramadan put a lot of thought into how to appeal to 
innovators. One important piece was the package. They 
worked hard to create a bottle and label that looked 
different and conveyed Sir Kensington’s values. They 
ended up with a bottle and label that looked like noth-
ing else in the ketchup aisle—it was short, squat, had a 
wide opening at the top, and had Sir Kensington’s im-
age prominently displayed on the front. They figured that 
combination would incent an innovator to pick the bottle 
up. Once it was in the hands of the innovator, the label 
took over. The label drew a clear distinction between Sir 
Kensington’s and other ketchups. The label reminded 
the shopper that Sir Kensington’s was made strictly from 
natural ingredients, with half the sugar and half the salt 
of traditional ketchup. They figured the label would close 
the sale. The first store to say yes was Murray’s Cheese, 
an independent grocer in Greenwich Village in New 
York City. Several other independents quickly followed. 
Based on this early traction, Norton and Ramadan were 
able to land Dean & DeLuca, Williams-Sonoma, and 
Whole Foods. It wasn’t easy. Whole Foods, for example, 
has seasons where they try out different categories 
of products. Norton and Ramadan established a rela-
tionship with a food broker who knew Whole Foods’s 
schedule and made the appropriate introductions. In its 
first year, 10,000 jars were sold.
Restaurants came next, in the 2012 time frame, and 
are generally harder than retailers for new food compa-
nies to crack. This is particularly true for a product like 
ketchup. Retailers sell ketchup—it’s a product on which 
they earn money. Restaurants give ketchup away—it’s 
something that costs them money. Sir Kensington’s was 
a premium-priced product. As a result, it was a tough 
sell. Eventually, several high-end restaurants signed on, 
including the Four Seasons hotels, mostly because they 
liked the Sir Kensington’s product and brand. Once the 
Four Seasons signed on, it was easier to convince other 
high-end restaurants to follow suit.
crossing the chasm
In 2013, Norton and Ramadan decided it was time for 
Sir Kensington to cross the chasm. What that meant 
was finding a way to appeal to mainstream consumers 
rather than innovators and early adopters. The change 
was also precipitated by the opportunity to sell in more 
mainstream stores such as Safeway and Target, and 
through online outlets such as Amazon.com. As men-
tioned above, crossing the chasm is not an easy task. 
The same product, and style, that appeals to innova-
tors and early adopters doesn’t necessarily appeal to 
mainstream consumers. The challenge that Norton and 
Ramadan faced, which is typical for companies attempt-
ing to cross the chasm, was to maintain the integrity and 
quality of their product while softening it in ways that 
would incent mainstream consumers to buy.
Several things were changed in preparation for the 
move. Sir Kensington’s image was changed. The origi-
nal Sir Kensington had a rather stern look with a neatly 
trimmed fashionable mustache. The new Sir Kensington 
was happier, with a large bushy mustache. The thinking 
was that mainstream consumers would be more comfort-
able bringing the happy Sir Kensington into their homes. 
Additionally, the taste of the product was tweaked some 
to make it seem more mainstream. Norton and Ramadan 
didn’t feel as though they were compromising their product 
or firm’s integrity by making these changes. They were just 
shifting their product to appeal more to mainstream con-
sumers. The nearby photo shows the two Sir Kensington 
ketchup bottles. Notice how the bottle changed to make it 
more appealing to mainstream customers.
The shift worked and Sir Kensington’s crossed the 
chasm. By early 2014, it was available in over 3,000

consumers.
Discussion Questions
 13-36. There is a discussion early in this chapter of the 
need to prepare for growth. What actions did Scott 
Norton and Mark Ramadan take that demonstrate 
their commitment to trying to fully understand 
growth and its ramifications for their firm?
 13-37. We noted in this chapter that core competen-
cies are essentially what a firm does particularly 
well. What are the core competencies of the firm 
Sir Kensington’s? how sustainable are these core 
competencies?
 13-38. Look at Figure 13.2, which shows the organi-
zational life cycle. In which of these stages is 
Sir Kensington’s located? To what issues do 
Sir Kensington’s founders need to be particularly 
sensitive in this stage?
 13-39. What are four key lessons about growth potential 
entrepreneurs could learn by studying how Sir 
Kensington’s has grown?

stores in the United States and in many restaurants and 
restaurant chains.
sir Kensington’s today
While adding new product lines is an obvious path to 
firm growth, Norton and Ramadan resisted the temp-
tation for some time. They felt that Sir Kensington’s 
Ketchup was successful in part because it offered an 
 alternative to heinz’s near monoloply in the ketchup mar-
ket. That wasn’t true of many products, as Norton and 
Ramadan had observed that day in 2008 when they first 
started talking about how few choices consumers had 
when it came to ketchup. Many times, they later noted, 
restaurants told them if they only had a matching set of 
Sir Kensington’s Ketchup and Mustard, they would adopt 
both. But oddly, consumers have many choices for mus-
tard. Everything that Norton and Ramadan felt was to 
their advantage when it came to selling ketchup would 
be to their disadvantage is selling mustard.
In 2014, Sir Kensington did expand its product 
line to include two types of mayonnaise—classic 
and chipotle. Like ketchup, there aren’t many brands 
of mayonnaise, so Norton and Ramadan are on 
familiar ground.

ChAPTER 13 | PREPARING FOR AND Evaluating ThE ChALLENGES OF GROWTh    489
introduction
In 2001, Matt Chasen graduated from the University of 
Texas at Austin with an undergraduate degree in me-
chanical engineering. he moved to Seattle to work for 
Boeing, but soon found that working for a large corpora-
tion wasn’t for him. Instead of jumping to another job, 
he decided to return to UT-Austin to pursue an MBA. 
Two things happened prior to this move, though, that 
changed his life. The first was a phone call from his 
mother. his mom wanted to move an heirloom dresser 
from Ohio to houston. She called several shipping 
companies and concluded that the rates quoted to her 
were outrageous. She wondered if Matt had any alterna-
tive ideas. he did some research, but came up empty. 
The second was preparing for his move from Seattle to 
Austin. he rented a 9-foot truck, but when he showed 
up for the truck all that was available was a 24-footer. 
he remembers standing in the back of the truck looking 
at all the unfilled capacity. he thought someone should 
set up an Internet site that matches people that need 
things moved, like his mom and her heirloom dresser, 
with trucks that have unused capacity.
According to Chasen, the drive from Seattle to 
Austin was a long one for his wife. he went on and on 
about his idea. Once settled in Austin again, Chasen 
spent the next two years in his MBA program working on 
the idea. he picked up two co-founders, Mickey Millsap 
and Jay Manickam, along the way. They were part of 
Chasen’s MBA cohort. The three would use uShip, which 
is the name they gave the idea, as a case study in every 
class they could. Chasen incorporated uShip in 2003 
while sitting in the back of one of his business classes.
In 2004, Chasen and his co-founders competed in 
several business plan competitions, winning first prize at 
the University of North Texas and scoring runner-up at the 
University of Texas’s MOOT Corp competition (now called 
the Venture Labs Investment Competition). Participating 
in MOOT Corp turned out to be particularly fortuitous. 
One of the judges offered to invest. That particular offer 
didn’t work out, but another investor, Bill Wood, stepped 
in and offered the three their first round of investment. 
uShip now had the capacity to become a real company.
uship
Shortly after Chasen, Millsap, and Manickam gradu-
ated, the uShip website went live. The basic idea was 
to connect people needing things shipped that were 
bigger or bulkier than UPS or FedEx normally took 
with shippers that had excess capacity on the same 
route. The initial plan was to target Texas. Texas was 
attractive in part because uShip stayed put in Austin, 
and by servicing Texas the company could be close to 
its initial customers. It was also attractive because of 
its triangle of major cities—Dallas, San Antanio, and 
houston—and the amount of shipping that took place 
among the cities. Shortly after the uShip site went 
live, the company knew it would grow beyond Texas. 
People from across the country started listing items 
they needed shipped. In fact, uShip’s very first transac-
tion was three beds and a dresser that were shipped 
from houston to Pocono Lake, Pennsylvania. The com-
pany was up and running.
The way uShip works is as follows. Consumers and 
businesses post the items they need shipped in one 
of several categories, including furniture, cars, boats, 
heavy machinery, and animals. The consumer can let 
shippers bid on their job, or name their price and see if 
a shipper bites. On the other side, the transporation ser-
vice providers, including truckers, movers, and brokers, 
bid on the jobs or accept the offer price. uShip takes a 
cut of the total shipping cost.
The beauty of the service is that everyone wins. 
On the consumer side, a consumer is able to ship a 
large or bulky item, like a boat, from point A to point 
B for typically much less than contracting through a 
freight company direct. On the shipper side, the ship-
pers get access to leads for free. Normally, shippers 
have to advertise to get jobs. They are only charged 
by uShip if they win a job and complete the shipment. 
There are also economic and societal benefits. About 
40 percent of the trucks on the road are running par-
tially or completely empty. uShip helps fill the trucks, 
which makes the overall transportation system more 
efficient.
stages of growth and the chicken-and-egg 
problem
uShip’s growth has progressed in three distinct phases, 
which are roughly similar to the standard organizatinal 
life cycle. The organizational life cycle has five phases—
introduction, early growth, continuous growth, maturity, 
and decline. Chasen, in an interview with the first author

starting with the most familiar markets, like the United 
Kingdom, as well as other European Union countries. 
uShip  expanded from these initial positions. As it saw 
 copycat sites pop up across the globe, it felt it was 
imperative to establish a presence in the most poten-
tially profitable markets.
Partnerships were another key engine of rapid 
growth. uShip was a perfect partner for an e-commerce 
site that sold large and bulky items. The site would sell 
the item, and shipping would be provided via uShip. 
For example, in 2009, uShip entered into a partnership 
with Ritchie Brothers Auctioneers, the world’s largest 
auctioneer for heavy equipment, to provide real-time 
estimates and quotes for the transportation of industrial 
equipment and vehicles being sold at auction.
uShip also became involved in an effort that led to 
its Series C round of funding. It estalished a partnership 
with TerraPass. TerraPass is a social enterprise that 
provides carbon offsetting products to individuals and 
businesses. uShip created a program that enabled its 
shippers to become green providers. For every job that 
they booked through uShip, they agreed to purchase a 
carbon offset via TerraPass that would make up for the 
carbon pollution caused by the trip. TerraPass in turn 
would use the money to invest in clean energy projects, 
like solar and wind. This program led to a major round 
of funding through Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, a 
well-known venture capital firm. Kleiner Perkins had set 
up a “green fund” and was looking to invest in compa-
nies that were attacking environmental issues in innova-
tive ways. The funding round was for $18 million.
Phase 3: Sustained growth.
uShip is now in a sustained growth phase. It is ex-
panding its international presence, and is now in 18 
countries, with an office in Amsterdam. Its partnership 
network is growing. It now provides customized ship-
ping solutions for Cars.com, iBoats.com, Rock&Dirt, 
Motorcycle.com, John Deere’s MachineFinder.com, and 
several others. It is also developing a program that will 
broker full loads of freight, targeted at expanding its 
presence in the $300 billion truckload freight market in 
the United States.
In 2012, uShip became the subject of a reality tele-
vision series aired by A&E called Shipping Wars. The 
show follows six independent truckers as they compete 
for jobs on uShip’s website, transport the loads, and 
deal with the challenges that truckers face on the road. 
Chasen and his team hope the visibility gained through 
the show will help make uShip a household name.
In early 2014, uShip received a major boost. It an-
nounced a partnership with eBay, which is by far the 
largest partnership in uShip’s history. It will become the 
perferred shipper for all larger-than-parcel items sold via 
the eBay marketplace.
uship’s Future
Although uShip maintains an entrepreneurial spirit, it 
is no longer a start-up. It now has 185 employees and 
operations across the globe. While its future appears 
of this case, characterized uShip’s growth as having 
three phases so far: bootstrap, rapid growth, and sus-
tained growth.
Phase 1: Bootstrap.
uShip’s first few years were a grind. Although the 
company achieved some early success, the overarch-
ing objectives were to prove product/market fit, show 
it could make money, and attract a Series A round of 
venture capital funding. The company also needed 
substantial traction. Chasen knew that uShip needed 
to get pretty far before it would attract venture funding. 
Venture funding would be needed to get to the next 
level of growth.
A challenge uShip faced straight away was the 
classic chicken-and-egg problem. Consumers would 
participate if a large number of shippers were available 
to bid on their jobs (and move their items), while ship-
pers would participate if a large number of consumers 
were posting jobs. A critical mass of both is needed. 
In the industry, this is called “liquidity.” Chasen and 
his small team tackled the challenge with a bootstrap 
mentality. Its first customers and shippers were driven 
to its website via guerilla marketing techniques, includ-
ing using eBay and Craigslist. An interesting tactic was 
the use of Google AdWords. uShip emerged about 
the same time that AdWords came online. uShip used 
AdWords to prove its economic model. It could buy 
$10 worth of AdWords (i.e., AdWords appear as paid 
text advertisements that accompany Google search 
results), and within seven days convert the $10 into $20 
in revenue through its transaction process. It was this 
tactic that convienced Benchmark, a venture capital 
firm located in Silicon Valley, to sign on. Chasen had 
met Bill Gurley, a partner at Benchmark, who was a UT 
alumnus, and started provided him updates about the 
progress that uShip was making. It wasn’t until uShip 
proved its economic model, however, that Benchmark 
was willing to make an investment.
Phase 2: Rapid growth Stage.
After the Benchmark investment, uShip took off. It 
used the money to bolster its staff, build out its infra-
structure, and to enter new markets. The first step was 
to continue to build its U.S. market position. As the 
company’s visibility grew, people started listing items 
that Chasen and his team never envisioned. Some 
of the more unusual items that it has shipped are a 
4,000-pound steel horse, an oversized Venus Flytrap 
(which is a carnivorous plant), and an old English 
phone booth.
The company also started expanding internation-
ally. From the very beginning, people from foreign 
countries arranged shipments via uShip. In fact, when 
uShip first launched, it found that people were try-
ing to enter foreign addresses into an online template 
set up for U.S. addresses. This fact made it neces-
sary for the firm to quickly modify its site to accom-
modate foreign addresses. As uShip geared up, it 
started customizing its service by foreign country, 

ChAPTER 13 | PREPARING FOR AND Evaluating ThE ChALLENGES OF GROWTh    491
bright, it becomes harder to grow as a compay gets 
larger. Its options include (1) becoming a large private 
company, (2) staging an IPO and becoming a large 
public company, (3) being acquired by a larger firm, like 
eBay, or (4) plateauing and eventually entering the matu-
rity and decline stage of the organizational life cycle. The 
way to avoid option 4, according to Chasen, is to keep 
innovating.
Discussion Questions
 13-40. Examine the material in the first part of this chapter 
under the “Preparing for Growth” heading. To what 
degree has uShip been sensitive to the three issues 
(appreciating the nature of business growth, stay-
ing committed to a core strategy, and planning for 
growth) under this heading?
 13-41. how have partnerships been important to uShip’s 
growth? Why do you think uShip has been able 
to form so many partnerships with other firms? In 
slightly different words, why is uShip an attractive 
partner?
 13-42. Refresh your memory of the meaning of the 
terms adverse selection and moral hazard as 
 discussed in this chapter. What adverse selec-
tion and moral hazard issues does uShip face 
today and how should the firm deal with those 
issues?
 13-43. uShip’s current position is explained at the end of 
the case. Does this firm face the risk of growing too 
quickly? Why or why not?

Personal with Shake Smart

495
I
n late July 2010, Kevin Gelfand had just finished a workout at the Aztec Recreational 
Center, the gym on the San Diego State University campus. He was dreading the 
bland protein shake he was about to drink. Rather than repeating this ritual, Gelfand 
decided to start experimenting with protein shakes of his own. He 
teamed up with fraternity brother Marin Reiman, and the two started 
experimenting with shakes that combined fresh fruit, ice, nonfat milk, 
and other ingredients with the whey protein found in most shakes. 
The pair came up with more than 60 different blends and recruited 
friends to do taste tests for them. They finally settled on 15 flavors. 
In the nearby photo, Martin Reiman is on the left and Kevin Gelfand 
is on the right.
During this time, Gelfand and Reiman started thinking about their 
experimentation as a potential business. They decided to call the 
business Smart Shake, based on the nutritious ingredients they were 
placing in their shakes. The ideal place to sell the shakes, in their 
estimation, was right outside the Aztec Center, where students like 
themselves would be looking for a nutritious snack after a workout. 
The two raised $50,000 from family and friends, hoping to set up shop near the gym. 
Getting approval from the university was no easy task. They spent six months plan-
ning and jumping through the necessary hoops, and were finally approved. The Shake 
Smart kiosk opened on January 3, 2011, just outside the Aztec Center, and was the first 
permanent student-run business to operate on the San Diego State University campus.
To make a go of it, Gelfand and Reiman figured that they would have to sell 60 drinks 
a day. They averaged 120 a day and within 6 months, were employing 12 people. The 
shakes were healthy, delicious, and convenient—a rare combination. The shakes had 
a near ideal combination of protein, fiber, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, which 
made them much more than a snack. They were a meal replacement and at about $5 fit 
a college student’s budget. In August 2011, Gelfand and Reiman made a deal with San 
Diego State University allowing freshmen to pay using their meal plan.
Like most start-ups, Shake Smart experienced some hiccups early on. At one 
point they launched a loyalty program with paper punch cards. The punch cards 
slowed down the line, which wasn’t good. Somebody got their hands on a puncher 
that was similar enough to the puncher Shake Smart was using that they were able 
to punch cards and redeem them for free shakes. Gelfand and Reiman finally caught 
on, and they switched to an approach that rewarded customers based on the dollar 
amount they spent.

but cautiously. In spring 2012, Shake Smart opened a second location, just outside a 
24 Hour Fitness Gym in the Horton Plaza mall. The Horton Plaza mall is not far from 
the San Diego State University campus. Since that time they have added four more 
locations, bringing the total to six. They now have two locations on the San Diego 
State University campus, one at Camp Pendleton, a nearby Marine Corps Base, one 
in an area LA Fitness center, the Horton Plaza location, and the first Shake Smart 
outside San Diego, in San Francisco’s Sports Club. A common theme across the six 
locations is that they are all in close proximity to people who are actively engaged 
with fitness. Along with adding to their number of locations, Shake Smart has also 
bolstered its menu. It now offers three categories of shakes: classic, specialty, and 
exotic. The ingredient combinations are novel and enticing. For example, one of 
Shake Smart’s exotic shakes, named mea aloha, contains pineapple, banana, acai, 
apple juice, and protein. Shake Smart also sells smoothies, healthy snacks, and extra 
toppings for its shakes. one of its snacks, the pb&b sandwich, consists of peanut 
butter and banana slices on whole wheat bread.
In expanding Shake Smart, Gelfand and Reiman have used their business edu-
cations. Reiman graduated in May 2011 with a degree in integrated marketing, while 
Gelfand graduate in December 2011 with a management/entrepreneurship degree. 
while managing their first location, they carefully worked out and documented the 
operational details and made note of what went right and what didn’t go right as time 
progressed. They used those details and knowledge to create a blueprint for subse-
quent locations. They stayed current on technology, and have a smartphone-based 
point of sale system that provides them real-time analytics on sales and expenses 
in all their locations, so they can instantly tell if anything is amiss. They are also ac-
tive on social media to remain in touch with customers and continue to build the 
Shake Smart brand. Gelfand and Reiman are comfortable with Shake Smart’s pace 
of growth. They have grown at a pace that they believe has been in step with their 
ability to properly oversee and operate each additional location. At some point they 
may consider franchising, but they are not at that point yet.
on several occasions, Gelfand and Reiman have been recognized for their efforts. 
In november 2012, they won fourth place in the Global Student Entrepreneur Awards, 
sponsored by the Entrepreneurs’ organization. More than 2,000 individuals from 28 
countries entered the competition, which recognizes outstanding student-owned busi-
nesses. In 2011, Gelfand and Reiman were recognized by Forbes as one of its nine All 
Star Student Entrepreneurs. The most impressive testament to Gelfand and Reiman’s 
accomplishments is Shake Smart’s ongoing success. The company is profitable and 
employs more than 80 people at its 6 locations.
Shake Smart plans new locations in both Southern and northern California. If the 
past is any indication of the future, Gelfand and Reiman will continue to grow Shake 
Smart by expanding their number of locations and experimenting with new menu 
combinations.
S
hake Smart’s experience is not unusual. Many entrepreneurial firms 
grow by adding to their product lines and by expanding geographically. In 
this chapter, we discuss the most common strategies firms use to grow. 
The growth strategies are divided into internal strategies for growth and exter-
nal strategies for growth, as shown in Figure 14.1.

CHAPTER 14 | STRATEGIES FoR Firm Growth    497
internal growth strategies
Internal growth strategies involve efforts taken within the firm itself, such 
as new product development, other product-related strategies, and interna-
tional expansion, for the purpose of increasing sales revenue and profitabil-
ity. Many businesses, such as Modcloth, Sir Kensington’s, and Zappos, are 
growing through internal growth strategies. The distinctive attribute of in-
ternally generated growth is that a business relies on its own competencies, 
expertise, business practices, and employees. Internally generated growth is 
often called organic growth because it does not rely on outside intervention. 
Almost all companies grow organically during the early stages of their organi-
zational life cycles.
Effective though it can be, there are limits to internal growth. As a company 
enters the middle and later stages of its life cycle, sustaining growth strictly 
through internal means becomes more challenging. Because of this, the con-
cern is that a company will “hit the wall” in terms of growth and will experience 
flat or even declining sales. This can happen when a company has the same 
product or service that it’s trying to sell to the same list of potential buyers. 
Companies in this predicament need to either expand their client list, add new 
products or services to complement their existing ones, or find new avenues to 
growth. Sometimes companies face this challenge through no fault of their own.
Some start-ups, to avoid quickly hitting the wall in terms of growth, config-
ure their initial products or services in ways that have built-in growth potential. 
This tactic is illustrated in this chapter’s “Savvy Entrepreneurial Firm” feature. 
SwitchFlops is an example of a company that has “built-in” avenues for future 
growth as a result of the unique nature of its product and how it’s configured.
We list the distinct advantages and disadvantages of internal growth strat-
egies in Table 14.1.
new product development
New product development involves designing, producing, and selling new 
products (or services) as a means of increasing firm revenues and profitabil-
ity. In many fast-paced industries, new product development is a competitive 
necessity. For example, the average product life cycle in the computer soft-
ware industry is 14 to 16 months, at the most. Just thinking of how quickly 
we are introduced to new computers, new smartphones, and related products

incremental, even-paced growth. A firm that grows at an 
even pace can continually adjust to changing environmental 
conditions to fine-tune its strategies over time. In contrast, 
a firm that doubles its size overnight through a merger or 
acquisition is making a much larger commitment at a single 
point in time.
provides maximum control. Internal growth  strategies 
 allow a firm to maintain control over the quality of its 
 products and services during the growth process. In 
 contrast, firms that grow through collaborative forms of 
growth, such as alliances or joint ventures, must share the 
oversight function with their business partners.
preserves organizational culture. Firms emphasizing 
 internal growth are not required to blend their organizational 
culture with another organization. As a result, the venture 
can grow under the auspices of a clearly understood, 
 unified corporate culture.
encourages internal entrepreneurship. Firms that grow 
via internal growth strategies are looking for new ideas 
from within the business rather than from outsiders. This 
approach encourages a climate of internal entrepreneurship 
and innovation.
allows firms to promote from within. Firms emphasizing 
internal growth strategies have the advantage of being able 
to promote within their own organizations. The availability 
of promotional opportunities within a firm is a powerful tool 
for employee motivation.
Slow form of growth. In some industries, an incremental, 
even-paced approach toward growth does not permit a firm 
to develop competitive economies of scale fast enough. In 
addition, in some industries it may not be possible for a firm 
to develop sufficient resources to remain competitive. A high 
level of merger and acquisition activity typically characterizes 
these industries.
need to develop new resources. Some internal growth 
strategies, such as new product development, require a firm 
to be innovative and develop new resources. while internal 
innovation has many positive attributes, it is typically slow, 
expensive, and risky.
investment in a failed internal effort can be difficult to 
recoup. Internal growth strategies, such as new product 
 development, run the risk that a new product or service idea 
may not sell, making it difficult to recoup the development 
cost the firm incurred.
adds to industry capacity. Some internal growth strategies 
add to industry capacity, and this can ultimately help force 
industry profitability down. For example, a restaurant chain 
that grows through geographic expansion may ultimately 
force industry profitability down by continuing to open new 
restaurants in an already crowded market.

highlights for us how rapidly products change in this industry. Because of 
these rapid changes, to remain competitive, software companies must always 
have new products in their pipelines. For some companies, continually devel-
oping new products is the essence of their existence.
Although developing new products can result in substantial rewards, it is 
a high-risk strategy. The key is developing innovative new products that aren’t 
simply “me-too” products that are entering already crowded markets. When 
properly executed though, there is tremendous upside potential to developing 
new products and/or services. Many biotech and pharmaceutical companies, 
for example, have developed products that not only improve the quality of life 
for their customers but also provide reliable revenue streams. In many cases, 
the products are patented, meaning that no one else can make them, at least 
O
ne thing that savvy, growth-minded start-ups do 
is configure their products or services in ways that 
have built-in growth potential. Producing “one-off” 
products or services leads to limited growth potential. 
Instead, it’s best to produce products and services that, 
if successful, provide natural segues to complementary 
products and services that can be added later.
SwitchFlops are sandals with interchangeable straps. 
Lindsay Phillips developed the original idea for these 
products when enrolled in high school, as part of an art 
project, when she was 16. Amazed by the response, 
Phillips continued with the project. She started designing 
functional flops with colorful straps, each adorned by a 
unique button. She realized that by using a hook-and-loop 
fastener on each flop, she could create a shoe that ac-
commodated interchangeable straps. This was the birth 
of SwitchFlops. A shopper buys one pair of SwitchFlops 
sandals, and can then purchase interchangeable straps.
During her college years, Phillips fine-tuned her de-
sign, merchandising, and manufacturing skills working 
summers at Polo Ralph Lauren’s leather goods division 
in new York City. She also traveled to Europe for classes 
and enrolled in the Semester at Sea program. These last 
two experiences exposed her to a variety of colors, cul-
tures, and patterns that helped her fashion unique strap 
designs. A patent on her unique approach was granted 
in 2004. SwitchFlops made its retail debut in January 
2007 at the Surf Expo Trade Show in orlando, Florida, 
where it was showcased as a new, creative product.
SwitchFlops started with several basic sandal designs 
and 10 straps. Most customers bought more than one pair 
of sandals and several straps, allowing them to “custom-
ize” their look by trading out sandals and straps. Most 
customers seemed to enjoy this experience. SwitchFlops’s 
value proposition was both versatility and value.
Today, SwitchFlops sandals cost between $24.05 and 
$59.95, and the straps cost between $7.50 and $16.95 
each. To make it fun, the sandals and straps all have 
names. Sandals include Rosie neutral Snakeskin, Lulu 
Flop Gray, and Brenna Brown wedge. Straps include 
Arlene Snap, Dhana Strap, Franny Snap, and Joanie Snap. 
There are now multiple SwitchFlops sandals and straps to 
choose from. Phillips has evolved her footwear line and 
currently sells ballet flats, wedges, and espadrilles along 
with sandals and has added shopping bags, scarves, and 
sandals for children to her firm’s product lines.
SwitchFlops sandals benefit from being both fashion-
conscious and economical. Instead of owning 10 pairs of 
sandals, a customer can own two or three, and have mul-
tiple “looks” by changing out straps. By making a product 
(sandals) that is based on buying add-ons (straps), the 
strategy has also benefited SwitchFlops and helped fuel 
its growth.
Questions for Critical Thinking
 1. As an up-and-coming entrepreneur, what things did 
Lindsay Phillips do to equip herself to lead a growth-
oriented firm?
 2. Think of a company that sells a product or service 
that’s similar to SwitchFlops, in that the product or 
service provides a natural segue to add-on products 
or services. Briefly explain the product and its built-in 
avenues for future growth.
 3. of the companies profiled in the “You Be the VC” fea-
tures in the book, which company has a product or 
service that is best positioned for natural segues for 
future growth? Explain your answer.
 4. why do you think SwitchFlops has been so success-
ful? Draw lessons from several chapters of the book to 
formulate your answer.

until the patents expire. Successful new products can also provide sufficient 
cash flow to fund a company’s operations and provide resources to support 
developing additional new products. For example, Amgen, a large and histori-
cally profitable biotech company, has several stellar pharmaceutical products, 
including Enbrel and Neupogen. Enbrel is a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blocker 
that is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis as well as some related conditions, 
and Neupogen helps prevent infection in cancer patients undergoing certain 
types of chemotherapy. These products have provided the company sufficient 
revenue to cover its overhead, fund new product development, and generate 
profits for an extended period of time.1
The keys to effective new product and service development, which are con-
sistent with the material on opportunity recognition (Chapter 2) and feasibility 
analysis (Chapter 3), follow:
■ Find a need and fill it: Most successful new products fill a need that is 
presently unfilled. “Saturated” markets should be avoided. For example, in 
the United States as well as in most developed countries, consumers have 
a more-than-adequate selection of appliances, tires, credit cards, and cell 
phone plans. These are crowded markets with low profit margins. The chal-
lenge for entrepreneurs is to find unfilled needs in attractive markets and 
then find a way to fill those needs.
■ Develop products that add value: In addition to finding a need and 
 fulfilling it, the most successful products are those that “add value” for 
customers in some meaningful way.
■ Get quality and pricing right: Every product represents a balance be-
tween quality and pricing. If the quality of a product and its price are not 
compatible, the product may fail and have little chance for recovery. To 
put this in slightly different terms, customers are willing to pay higher 
prices for higher-quality products and are willing to accept lower quality 
when they pay lower prices.
■ Focus on a specific target market: Every new product and service 
should have a specific target market in mind, as we have highlighted 
throughout this book. This degree of specificity gives the innovating entre-
preneurial venture the opportunity to conduct a focused promotional cam-
paign and select the appropriate distributors. The notion that “it’s a good 
product, so somebody will by it” is a naïve way to do business and often 
contributes to failure.
■ Conduct ongoing feasibility analysis: Once a product or service is 
launched, the feasibility analysis and marketing research should not end. 
The initial market response should be tested in focus groups and surveys, 
and incremental adjustments should be made when appropriate.
There is also a common set of reasons that new products fail, as articu-
lated by eSeller Media and shown in Table 14.2.2 It behooves entrepreneurs to 
Table 14.2  the top 5 reasons new products Fail
1. The potential market was overestimated.
2. Customers saw the product as too expensive.
3. The product was poorly designed.
4. The product was no different than the competition’s (“me too” products).
5. The costs of developing the product line were too high.

CHAPTER 14 | STRATEGIES FoR Firm Growth    501
be aware of these reasons and to work hard to prevent new product failures as 
a result of poor execution in these areas.
This discussion is a reminder that to achieve healthy growth, whether via 
the development of new products or another means, a firm must sell a prod-
uct or service that legitimately creates value and has the potential to generate 
profits along with sales.
additional internal product-growth 
strategies
Along with developing new products, firms grow by improving existing prod-
ucts or services, increasing the market penetration of an existing product or 
service, or pursuing a product extension strategy.
improving an existing product or Service
A business can often increase its revenue by improving an existing product 
or service—enhancing quality, making it larger or smaller, making it more 
convenient to use, improving its durability, or making it more up-to-date. 
Improving an item means increasing its value and price potential from the cus-
tomer’s perspective. For example, smartphone companies routinely increase 
revenues by coming out with “new” versions of their existing phones.
A mistake many businesses make is not remaining vigilant enough regard-
ing opportunities to improve existing products and services. It is typically much 
less expensive for a firm to modify an existing product or service and extend its 
life than to develop a new product or service from scratch. For example, many 
women have set aside the flat irons that they’ve used for years to do their hair 
and have bought a ceramic flat iron because they’re safer and do a better job. 
Selling “improved” flat irons is a much less expensive way for curling iron man-
ufacturers to grow sales than to develop a completely new product.
increasing the Market penetration of an existing 
product or Service
A market penetration strategy involves actions taken to increase the sales 
of a product or service through greater marketing efforts or through increased 
production capacity and efficiency.3 An increase in a product’s market share 
is typically accomplished by increasing advertising expenditures, offering 
sales promotions, lowering the price, increasing the size of the sales force, 
or increasing a company’s social media efforts. Consider Proactiv, the skin-
care company. Since its inception in 1994, Proactiv has relied on celebrity 
endorsers to demonstrate and promote its product. Actress Judith Light and 
actress/singer Vanessa Williams were the firm’s first celebrity endorsers. Over 
the years, the company has added additional celebrity endorsers to appeal 
to a broader and more diverse clientele. The additions include actress Jane 
Seymour, music artists Katy Perry, Jenna Fischer, and Justin Bieber, and 
tennis player Caroline Wozniacki.4 Dr. Katie Rodan, a cofounder of Proactiv, 
points to the celebrity endorser program as one of the savviest actions the 
company has taken to build market share.5
Another example is the prepaid card, like the Starbucks Card, that almost 
all restaurants and retailers now offer. By making it more convenient for cus-
tomers to purchase its products, restaurants and retailers boost their revenues. 
Prepaid cards also make it easier to give a restaurant’s or retailer’s offering as 
a gift. Think of how many people buy Target, Macy’s, or Pottery Barn prepaid

(gift) cards as birthday or holiday gifts. A benefit to those receiving these cards 
is the opportunity to use them to buy a product that fulfills a true need.
Increased market penetration can also occur through increased capacity or 
efficiency, which permits a firm to have a greater volume of product or service 
to sell. In a manufacturing context, an increase in product capacity can occur 
by expanding plant and equipment or by outsourcing a portion of the produc-
tion process to another company. Outsourcing is work that is done for a com-
pany by people other than the company’s full-time employees.6 For example, a 
firm that previously manufactured and packaged its product may outsource the 
packaging function to another company and as a result free up factory space to 
increase production of the basic product. Additionally, a firm might outsource 
its information technology function to free up resources that could be invested 
in product development efforts.
extending product lines
A product line extension strategy involves making additional versions of a 
product so that it will appeal to different clientele or making related products 
to sell to the same clientele.7 For example, a company may make another ver-
sion of a low-end product that is a little better and then make another version 
of it that represents the top of the line to appeal to different clientele. This is a 
strategy that allows a firm to take one product and extend it into several prod-
ucts without incurring significant additional development expense. Computer 
manufacturers provide a good example of how to execute a product line exten-
sion strategy. Each manufacturer sells several versions of its desktop and lap-
top computers. The different versions of the same computer typically represent 
good, better, and best alternatives based on processor speed, memory capac-
ity, monitor size, graphic capabilities, and other features. In regard to making 
related products to sell to the same clientele, many firms start by offering one 
product or service and then expand into related areas.
Firms also pursue product extension strategies as a way of leveraging 
their core competencies into related areas. For example, Zipcar, the popular 
car sharing service, has applied the expertise it developed through its con-
sumer car sharing service to launch Zipcar for business, an initiative that 
allows businesses to use Zipcar’s services in the same way that individuals 
do. Similarly, it recently launched FastFleet, a service to help cities more ef-
ficiently use cars in their fleet. An account of the history of Oracle, a computer 
database software company, provides a particularly interesting example of the 
potential payoff of a product extension strategy. The example demonstrates 
that product extension strategies can take time and patience to pay off but can 
lead to breakthrough growth strategies:
As Ellison [Oracle’s CEO] recognized that he had sold a database to almost every 
one of the biggest companies in the world, he knew he would need new products 
to sell. That is how he came up with the idea of applications. Oracle applications 
would sit on top of and use Oracle databases to perform functions such as inven-
tory management, personnel record keeping, and sales tracking. The proof of his 
thinking took almost seven years, but by 1995, the company generated nearly 
$300 million in license revenues from application products and an additional 
$400 million in applications-related services.8
Geographic expansion
Geographic expansion is another internal growth strategy. Many entrepre-
neurial businesses grow by simply expanding from their original location to 
additional geographic sites. This type of expansion is most common in retail 

CHAPTER 14 | STRATEGIES FoR Firm Growth    503
settings. For example, a small business that has a successful retail store in 
one location may expand by opening a second location in a nearby commu-
nity. Gap Inc., Walgreens, and Panera Bread are examples of firms that have 
grown through geographic expansion. Of course, McDonald’s, which now has 
over 35,000 worldwide locations, is the classic example of incredibly success-
ful growth through geographic expansion. Interestingly, Subway, another firm 
achieving a significant level of success through geographic expansion, now has 
more locations worldwide than does McDonald’s. The keys to successful geo-
graphic expansion follow:
■ Perform successfully in the initial location: Additional locations can 
learn from the initial location’s success.
■ Establish the legitimacy of the business concept in the expansion 
locations: For example, a particular type of fitness center may be well ac-
cepted in its original location because it has been there a long time and 
has a loyal clientele. However, potential clientele in a neighboring commu-
nity may be completely unfamiliar with its unique products and services. 
A common mistake an entrepreneurial venture makes when it expands 
from one community to another is to assume that if something works in 
one community, it will automatically work in another.
■ Don’t isolate the expansion location: Sometimes the employees in an ex-
pansion location feel isolated and that they are not receiving adequate train-
ing and oversight from the headquarters location. It is a mistake to believe 
that an expansion location can excel without the same amount of attention 
and nurturing that it took to build the business in the original location.
Product-related strategies, regardless of the form they take, work best when a 
company remains vigilant about making sure the product remains in demand 
and consumer trends aren’t turning against it. A lack of vigilance in this area 
contributed to the failure of Crumbs Bake Shop, a company that at one time 
was the most popular cupcake-focused bake shop in the United States. A de-
scription of why Crumbs failed, which is an example all entrepreneurial firms 
can learn from, is provided in the nearby “What Went Wrong?” feature.
international expansion
International expansion is another common form of growth for entrepreneur-
ial firms.9 According to a 2011 survey conducted by the Small Business & 
Entrepreneurship Council (SBE) and the Financial Services Roundtable, 21 
percent of small businesses said that expanding into overseas markets factored 
into their business plans over the next five years.10 A look at the world’s popu-
lation and purchasing power statistics affirms the importance of international 
markets for growth-oriented firms. Approximately 96 percent of the world’s 
population and 70 percent of its total purchasing power are located outside the 
United States. Influenced by these data, an increasing number of the new firms 
launched in the United States today are international new ventures.
International new ventures are businesses that, from inception, seek 
to derive competitive advantage by using their resources to sell products or 
services in multiple countries.11 From the time they are started, these firms, 
which are sometimes called “global start-ups” or “born globals,” view the world 
as their marketplace rather than confining themselves to a single country. 
ASOS, for example, which is a European fashion website, was an international 
firm from its inception. It now generates over 67 percent of its revenues from 
overseas sales.12 Similarly, some start-ups become international firms be-
cause overseas customers request their product or service. This is what hap-
pened to uShip, an Austin, Texas, company, as reported in Case 13.2. Shortly

C
rumbs Bake Shop was founded in 2003 by Jason 
and Mia Bauer, a husband-and-wife team. The idea 
was to sell gourmet cupcakes. The cupcakes came 
in an assortment of sizes and fillings. Most of the cupcakes 
were familiar flavors, such as cookie dough, tiramisu, and 
caramel apple. There were also cupcakes named after 
celebrities like Elvis Presley and Artie Lange. The cup-
cakes came in three main sizes: the mini “taste” size, the 
“classic” size, and the “signature” size. The signature size 
cupcakes, which were nearly double the size of standard 
cupcakes, cost anywhere from $3.50 to $4.50. Crumbs 
placed small signs in front of each cupcake or baked good 
reporting the price and calorie count. The blackbottom 
cheesecake brownie cupcake was reported to have 1,090 
calories. In its latter years, Crumbs made a $42 “Colossal” 
cupcake that served as many as eight people.
Crumbs expanded quickly and soon became the 
largest cupcake chain in the United States. At its peak 
it had expanded to 79 locations with plans for many 
more. It broadened its approach some but primarily 
stuck to selling cupcakes. In early 2011, Crumbs was 
sold to a shell company, which took it public that June. 
For the first time, its same-store sales started to de-
cline. The company’s new CEo, Edward Slezak, tried 
a new approach to growth—striking licensing deals 
to sell Crumbs-branded products in other stores. He 
also started closing unprofitable locations. In mid-2013, 
Crumbs announced a partnership with David Burke, a 
well-known chef and restaurateur, to begin marketing 
a new line of gourmet sandwiches and salads at se-
lect Crumbs locations. The partnership ended roughly 
a month later due to poor sales. In late 2013, Crumbs 
opened a gluten-free store in downtown Manhattan in 
new York City.
on July 8, 2014, Crumbs announced that it planned 
to close all of its stores. The company’s stock had been 
delisted several days earlier by the nASDAQ Stock 
Exchange. The company warned that the delisting would 
cause it to default on up to $14 million in debt. A sad 
ending. At one time Crumbs was proud and growing. 
now it was closing. what went wrong? Several things—
all of which provide valuable lessons for growing entre-
preneurial firms.
First, an increasingly crowded market. when Crumbs 
opened in 2003, it was unique. There were only a handful 
of bakeries devoted to cupcakes nationwide. By 2011, 
the year Crumbs’s same-day sales started to decline, 
there were many. Some were bakeries and some were 
simple kiosks. In addition, almost any bakery could add 
gourmet cupcakes to its product offerings if it wanted to 
do so.
Second, consumers started losing interest in cup-
cakes. when Crumbs opened, cupcakes were hot. 
Consumers eventually moved on. To illustrate this point, 
the wall Street Journal ran an article in early 2013 
titled “Forget Gold, the Gourmet-Cupcake Market is 
Crashing,” in which it reported Crumbs’s declining sales. 
while its drop in sales was attributed in part to Hurricane 
Sandy (many of Crumbs’s restaurants were in the new 
York City area), the wall Street Journal article said 
Crumbs was suffering from a larger problem: “gourmet-
cupcake burnout.”
Third, high real estate costs. Crumbs had nice stores. 
Many were large for a single-product company. Its 
shops averaged about 1,000 square feet. one Crumbs 
Bake Shop near Chicago, according to a 2014 Business 
insider article, measured 3,300 square feet. That’s about 
the same size as a generous four-bedroom home.
Fourth, no pivot or change in strategy. Despite falling 
same-store sales, Crumbs kept opening new locations. 
It added 35 locations from mid-2011 to 2013 alone. This 
was during a period in which it knew its same-store sales 
were declining. It also maintained its focus on cupcakes, 
with no serious attempt to diversify. A challenge with 
selling a product like cupcakes is that it’s an occasional 
rather than a regular purchase. while people might eat 
at the same restaurant every day or buy bread from the 
same bakery several times a week, very few people buy 
items like gourmet cupcakes more than occasionally.
Questions for Critical Thinking
 1. what are three lessons that other start-ups can learn 
from Crumbs’s failure?
 2. To what degree do you think Crumbs should have 
been able to anticipate a decline in interest in gourmet 
cupcakes?
 3. why do you think Crumbs doggedly stuck to its sin-
gular focus on selling cupcakes, in light of declining 
same-store sales?
 4. was Crumbs’s failure preventable? what, if anything, 
could have been done to save Crumbs? Based on the 
material in the chapter, what types of growth could 
Crumbs have pursued that it didn’t go after?

after it launched in 2003, overseas customers started arranging shipments via 
uShip’s website. uShip is now in 18 countries and has an office in Amsterdam.
Although there is vast potential associated with selling overseas, it is a 
fairly complex form of firm growth. Of course, alert entrepreneurs should care-
fully observe any changes in purchasing power among the world’s societies 
that may result from a financial crisis like the one the world experienced in 
2008 and 2009. Let’s look at the most important issues that entrepreneurial 
firms should consider in pursuing growth via international expansion.
assessing a firm’s Suitability for Growth 
through international Markets
Table 14.3 provides a review of the issues that should be considered, includ-
ing management/organizational issues, product and distribution issues, and 
financial and risk management issues, when a venture considers expanding 
Table 14.3   evaluating a Firm’s Overall suitability for growth through 
international Markets
Management/organizational issues
depth of management commitment. A firm’s first consideration is to test the depth of its management commitment  
to entering international markets. Although a firm can “test the waters” by exporting with minimal risk, other forms of 
 internationalization involve a far more significant commitment. A properly funded and executed international strategy 
 requires top management support.
depth of international experience. A firm should also assess its depth of experience in international markets. Many 
 entrepreneurial firms have no experience in this area. As a result, to be successful, an inexperienced entrepreneurial firm may 
have to hire an export management company to familiarize itself with export documentation and other subtleties of the export 
process. Many entrepreneurial firms err by believing that selling and servicing a product or service overseas is not that much 
different than doing so at home. It is.
interference with other firm initiatives. Learning how to sell in foreign markets can consume a great deal of  entrepreneurs’ 
or managers’ time. overseas travel is often required, and selling to buyers who speak a different language and live in a 
 different time zone can be a painstaking process. overall, efforts must be devoted to understanding the culture of the 
 international markets the venture is considering. Thus, a firm should weigh the advantages of involvement in international 
markets against the time commitment involved and the potential interference with other firm initiatives.
product and distribution issues
product issues. A firm must first determine if its products or services are suitable for overseas markets. Many pertinent 
questions need to be answered to make this determination. For example, are a firm’s products subject to national health or 
product safety regulations? Do the products require local service, supplies, or spare parts distribution capability? will the 
products need to be redesigned to meet the specifications of customers in foreign markets? will foreign customers find 
the products desirable? All these questions must have suitable answers before entering a foreign market. A firm can’t simply 
“assume” that its products are salable and easily serviceable in foreign countries.
distribution issues. How will the product be transported from the United States to a foreign country? Alternatively, how 
would an entrepreneurial firm transport a product produced in Sweden to a market in the United States? Is the transportation 
reliable and affordable? Can the product be exported from the venture’s home operation, or will it have to be manufactured in 
the country of sale?
financial and risk Management issues
financing export operations. Can the foreign initiative be funded from internal operations, or will additional funding 
be needed? How will foreign customers pay the firm? How will the firm collect bad debts in a foreign country? Informed 
 answers to these questions must be obtained before the firm initiates overseas sales.
foreign currency risk. How will the firm manage fluctuations in exchange rates? If the entrepreneurial firm is located in 
the United States and it sells to a buyer in Japan, will it be paid in U.S. dollars or in Japanese yen?

into international markets. If these issues can be addressed successfully, 
growth through international markets may be an excellent choice for an en-
trepreneurial firm. The major impediment in this area is not fully appreciating 
the challenges involved.
foreign Market entry Strategies
The majority of entrepreneurial firms first enter foreign markets as exporters, but 
firms also use licensing, joint ventures, franchising, turnkey projects, and wholly 
owned subsidiaries to start international expansion.13 These strategies, along 
with their primary advantages and disadvantages, are explained in Table 14.4.
Selling overseas
Many entrepreneurial firms first start selling overseas by responding to an 
unsolicited inquiry from a foreign buyer. It is important to handle the inquiry 
appropriately and to observe protocols when trying to serve the needs of 
Table 14.4   primary advantages and Disadvantages of various Foreign-Market entry 
strategies
foreign-Market entry Strategy
primary advantage
primary disadvantage
exporting. Exporting is the process of producing 
a product at home and shipping it to a foreign 
 market. Most entrepreneurial firms begin their 
international involvement as exporters.
Exporting is a relatively 
inexpensive way for a firm to 
become involved in foreign 
markets.
High transportation costs can 
make exporting uneconomical, 
particularly for bulky products.
licensing. A licensing agreement is an arrangement 
whereby a firm with the proprietary rights to a product 
grants permission to another firm to manufacture that 
product for specified royalties or other payments. 
Proprietary services and processes can also be 
licensed.
The licensee puts up most of 
the capital needed to establish 
the overseas operation.
A firm in effect “teaches” a foreign 
company how to produce its 
proprietary product. Eventually, 
the foreign company will probably 
break away and start producing a 
variation of the product on its own.
Joint ventures. A joint venture involves the 
establishment of a firm that is jointly owned by two 
or more otherwise independent firms. Fuji-Xerox, 
founded in 1962, for example, is a joint venture 
between an American and a Japanese firm.
Gaining access to the foreign 
partner’s knowledge of 
local customs and market 
preferences.
A firm loses partial control of its 
business operations.
franchising. A franchise is an agreement between a 
franchisor (the parent company that has a proprietary 
product, service, or business method) and a franchisee 
(an individual or firm that is willing to pay the franchisor 
a fee for the right to sell its product, service, and/or 
use its business method). U.S. firms can sell franchises 
in foreign markets, with the reverse being true as well.
The franchisee puts up the 
majority of capital needed to 
operate in the foreign market.
Quality control.
turnkey projects. In a turnkey project, a contractor 
from one country builds a facility in another country, 
trains the personnel that will operate the facility, and 
turns over the keys to the project when it is completed 
and ready to operate.
Ability to generate revenue.
It is usually a one-time activity, 
and the relationships that are 
established in a foreign market 
may not be valuable to facilitate 
future projects.
wholly owned subsidiary. A firm that establishes 
a wholly owned subsidiary in a foreign country has 
typically made the decision to manufacture in the 
foreign country and establish a permanent presence.
Provides a firm total control 
over its foreign operations.
The cost of setting up and 
maintaining a manufacturing 
facility and permanent presence 
in a foreign country can be high.

CHAPTER 14 | STRATEGIES FoR Firm Growth    507
customers in foreign markets. The following are several rules of thumb for sell-
ing products in foreign markets:
■ Answer requests promptly and clearly. Do not ignore a request just because 
it lacks grammatical clarity and elegance. Individuals using a nonnative 
language to contact a business located outside their home nation often are 
inexperienced with a second language.
■ Replies to foreign inquires, other than e-mail or fax, should be communi-
cated through some form of airmail or overnight delivery. Ground delivery 
is slow in some areas of the world.
■ A file should be set up to retain copies of all foreign inquiries. Even if an 
inquiry does not lead to an immediate sale, the names of firms that have 
made inquiries will be valuable for future prospecting.
■ Keep promises. The biggest complaint from foreign buyers about U.S. 
businesses is failure to ship on time (or as promised). The first order is the 
most important in that it sets the tone for the ongoing relationship.
■ All correspondence should be personally signed. Form letters are offensive 
in some cultures.
■ Be polite, courteous, friendly, and respectful. This is simple common 
sense, but politeness is particularly important in some Asian cultures. In 
addition, avoid the use of business slang that is indigenous to the United 
States, in that the slang terms lack meaning in many other cultures. 
Stated simply, be sensitive to cultural norms and expectations.
■ For a personal meeting, always make sure to send an individual who is 
of equal rank to the person with whom he or she will be meeting. In some 
cultures, it would be seen as inappropriate for a salesperson from a U.S. 
company to meet with the vice president or president of a foreign firm.
external growth strategies
External growth strategies rely on establishing relationships with third parties. 
Mergers, acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures, licensing, and franchis-
ing are examples of external growth strategies. Each of these strategic options is 
discussed in the following sections, with the exception of franchising, which we 
consider separately in Chapter 15.
An emphasis on external growth strategies typically results in a more fast-
paced, collaborative approach toward growth than the slower-paced internal 
strategies, such as new product development and expanding to foreign mar-
kets. External growth strategies level the playing field between smaller firms 
and larger companies.14 For example, Pixar, the small animation studio that 
produced the animated hits Toy Story, Finding Nemo, and Up, had a number of 
key strategic alliances with Disney, before Disney acquired Pixar in 2006. By 
partnering with Disney, Pixar effectively co-opted a portion of Disney’s man-
agement savvy, technical expertise, and access to distribution channels. The 
relationship with Disney helped Pixar grow and enhance its ability to effec-
tively compete in the marketplace, to the point where it became an attractive 
acquisition target.
There are distinct advantages and disadvantages to emphasizing external 
growth strategies, as shown in Table 14.5.
Mergers and acquisitions
Many entrepreneurial firms grow through mergers and acquisitions. A merger 
is the pooling of interests to combine two or more firms into one. An acquisi-
tion is the outright purchase of one firm by another. In an acquisition, the

reducing competition. Competition is lessened when 
a firm acquires a competitor. This step often helps a firm 
establish price stability by eliminating the possibility of 
getting in a price war with at least one competitor. By turning 
potential competitors into partners and through alliances 
and franchises, the firm can also reduce the amount of 
competition it experiences.
Getting access to proprietary products or services. 
Acquisitions or alliances are often motivated by a desire 
on the part of one firm to gain legitimate access to the 
proprietary property of another.
Gaining access to new products and markets. Growth 
through acquisition, alliances, or franchising is a quick way 
for a firm to gain access to new products and markets. 
Licensing can also provide a firm an initial entry into a 
market.
obtaining access to technical expertise. Sometimes, 
businesses acquire or partner with other businesses to gain 
access to technical expertise. In franchise organizations, 
franchisors often receive useful tips and suggestions from 
their franchisees.
Gaining access to an established brand name. A growing 
company that has good products or services may acquire 
or partner with an older, more established company to gain 
access to its trademark and name recognition.
economies of scale. Combining two or more previously 
separate firms, whether through acquisition, partnering, or 
franchising, often leads to greater economies of scale for the 
combined firms.
diversification of business risk. one of the principal driving 
forces behind all forms of collaboration or shared ownership 
is to diversify business risk.
incompatibility of top management. The top managers of 
the firms involved in an acquisition, an alliance, a licensing 
agreement, or a franchise organization may clash, making 
the implementation of the initiative difficult.
clash of corporate cultures. Because external forms of 
growth require the combined effort of two or more firms, 
corporate cultures often clash, resulting in frustration and 
subpar performance.
operational problems. Another problem that firms 
encounter when they acquire or collaborate with another 
company is that their equipment and business processes 
may lack full compatibility.
increased business complexity. Although the vast 
majority of acquisitions and alliances involve companies 
that are in the same or closely related industries, some 
entrepreneurial firms acquire or partner with firms in 
unrelated industries. This approach vastly increases the 
complexity of the combined business. The firm acquiring a 
brand or partnership with another company to gain access 
to its brand may subsequently fail to further develop its own 
brand and trademarks. This failure can lead to an increased 
dependency on acquired or partnered brands, reducing the 
firm’s ability to establish and maintain a unique identity in 
the marketplace.
loss of organizational flexibility. Acquiring or 
establishing a partnership with one firm may foreclose the 
possibility of acquiring or establishing a partnership with 
another one.
antitrust implications. Acquisitions and alliances are 
subject to antitrust review. In addition, some countries have 
strict antitrust laws prohibiting certain business relationships 
between firms.
surviving firm is called the acquirer, and the firm that is acquired is called 
the target. This section focuses on acquisitions rather than mergers because 
entrepreneurial firms are more commonly involved with acquisitions than 
mergers.
Acquiring another business can fulfill several of a company’s needs, such 
as expanding its product line, gaining access to distribution channels, achiev-
ing economies of scale, gaining access to technology that will enhance its 
current offerings, or gaining access to talented employees. In most cases, a 
firm acquires a competitor or a company that has a product line or core com-
petence that it needs. For example, in 2012 Facebook acquired Instagram as 
a way of enhancing its photo sharing capabilities. Similarly, in 2014 Twitter 
acquired a company called TapCommerce to bolster its capabilities in mobile 
advertising.
Although it can be advantageous, the decision to grow the entrepreneurial 
firm through acquisitions should be approached with caution.15 Many firms

have found that the process of assimilating another company into their cur-
rent operation is not easy and can stretch finances to the brink.
Finding an appropriate acquisition Candidate  If a firm decides to 
grow through acquisition, it is very important for it to exercise extreme care in 
finding acquisition candidates. Many acquisitions fail not because the compa-
nies involved lack resolve, but because they were a poor match to begin with. 
There are typically two steps involved in finding an appropriate target firm. 
The first step is to survey the marketplace and make a “short list” of promising 
candidates. The second is to carefully screen each candidate to determine its 
suitability for acquisition. The key areas to focus on in accomplishing these two 
steps are as follows:
■ The target firm’s openness to the idea of being acquired and its ability to 
receive consent for its acquisition from key third parties. The third parties 
from whom consent may be required include bankers, investors, suppliers, 
employees, and key customers.
■ The strength of the target firm’s management team, its industry, and its 
physical proximity to the acquiring firm’s headquarters.
■ The perceived compatibility of the target company’s top management team 
and corporate culture with the acquiring firm’s top management team and 
corporate culture.
■ The target firm’s past and projected financial performance.
■ The likelihood the target firm will retain its key employees and customers 
if acquired.
■ The identification of any legal complications that might impede the 
 purchase of the target firm and the extent to which patents, trademarks, 
and copyrights protect the firm’s intellectual property.
■ The extent to which the acquiring firm understands the business and 
 industry of the target firm.

510    PART 4 | MAnAGInG AnD GRowInG An EnTREPREnEURIAL FIRM
The screening should be as comprehensive as possible to provide the acquiring 
firm sufficient data to determine realistic offering prices for the firms under con-
sideration. A common mistake among acquiring firms is to pay too much for the 
businesses they purchase. Firms can avoid this mistake by basing their bids on 
hard data rather than on guesses or intuition.
Steps involved in an acquisition  Completing an acquisition is a nine-step 
process, as illustrated in Figure 14.2.
Step 1 Schedule a meeting with the target firm’s executives: The acquir-
ing firm should have legal representation at this point to help structure 
the initial negotiations and help settle any legal issues. The acquiring 
firm should also have a good idea of what it thinks the acquisition tar-
get is worth.
Step 2 Evaluate the feelings of the target firm’s executives about the 
acquisition: If the target is in a “hurry to sell,” it works to the acquir-
ing firm’s advantage. If the target starts to get cold feet, the negotia-
tions may become more difficult.
Step 3 Determine how to most appropriately finance the acquisition: The 
acquiring firm should be financially prepared to complete the transac-
tion if the terms are favorable.
Step 4 Actively negotiate with the target firm: If a purchase is imminent, ob-
tain all necessary shareholder and third-party consents and approvals.
Step 5 Make an offer if negotiations indicate that doing so is appropriate: 
Both parties should have the offer reviewed by attorneys and certified 
public accountants (CPAs) that represent their interests. Determine how 
payment will be structured.
Step 6 Develop a noncompete agreement with key target firm employees 
who will be retained: This agreement, as explained in Chapter 7, 
limits the rights of the key employees of the acquired firm to start the

same type of business in the acquiring firm’s trade area for a specific 
amount of time.
Step 7 Hire an attorney to prepare the closing documents: Complete the 
transaction.
Step 8 As soon as practical, meet with all employees to explain the acqui-
sition: A meeting should be held as soon as possible with the employ-
ees of both the acquiring firm and the target firm. Articulate a vision for 
the combined firm and ease employee anxiety where possible.
Step 9 Move forward with the plan for adding the acquired firm to the 
organization: In some cases, the acquired firm is immediately as-
similated into the operations of the acquiring firm. In other cases, 
the acquired firm is allowed to operate in a relatively autonomous 
manner.
Along with acquiring other firms to accelerate their growth, entrepreneurial 
firms are often the targets of larger firms that are looking to enter a new mar-
ket or acquire proprietary technology. Selling to a large firm is often the goal 
of an investor-backed company, as a way of creating a liquidity event to allow 
investors to monetize their investment. Some entrepreneurs allow their com-
panies to be bought by larger firms as a way of accelerating their growth. For 
example, in 2008 Honest Tea sold a large stake of itself to Coca-Cola, primarily 
as a means of integrating itself into Coke’s worldwide distribution channels. 
Coke is now providing Honest Tea access to markets it could have never pen-
etrated on its own.
licensing
Licensing is the granting of permission by one company to another company 
to use a specific form of its intellectual property under clearly defined condi-
tions. Virtually any intellectual property a company owns that is protected by a 
patent, trademark, or copyright can be licensed to a third party. Licensing also 
works well for firms that create novel products but do not have the resources 
to build manufacturing capabilities or distribution networks, which other 
firms may already have in place.
Entrepreneurial firms can also benefit by licensing technology from larger 
companies. For example Mint.com, the subject of Case 14.2, licenses technol-
ogy from Yodlee, a larger firm. Yodlee’s technology enables Mint.com to access 
its members’ account information, such as credit card balances and payment 
due dates. A firm named Wesabe, the subject of the “What Went Wrong?” fea-
ture in Chapter 13, tried to build a personal financial management website 
similar to Mint.com and decided to build its own capabilities for scraping 
bank websites rather than license the technology from Yodlee. Marc Hedlund, 
one of Wesabe’s co-founders, identified this decision as one of the reasons 
Wesabe failed.
The terms of a license are spelled out through a licensing agreement, 
which is a formal contract between a licensor and a licensee. The licensor is 
the company that owns the intellectual property; the licensee is the company 
purchasing the right to use it. A license can be exclusive, nonexclusive, for a 
specific purpose, and for a specific geographic area.16 In almost all cases, the 
licensee pays the licensor an initial payment plus an ongoing royalty for the 
right to use the intellectual property. There is no set formula for determining 
the amount of the initial payment or the royalties—these are issues that are 
part of the process of negotiating a licensing agreement.17 Entrepreneurial 

512    PART 4 | MAnAGInG AnD GRowInG An EnTREPREnEURIAL FIRM
firms often press for a relatively large initial payment as a way of generating 
immediate cash to fund their operations.
There are two principal types of licensing: technology licensing and merchan-
dise and character licensing.
Technology licensing  Technology licensing is the licensing of pro-
prietary technology that the licensor typically controls by virtue of a utility 
patent.18 This type of licensing agreement commonly involves one of two sce-
narios. First, firms develop technologies to enhance their own products and 
then find noncompetitors to license the technology to spread out the costs and 
risks involved. Second, companies that are tightly focused on developing new 
products pass on their new products through licensing agreements to compa-
nies that are more marketing oriented and that have the resources to bring the 
products to market.
Striking a licensing agreement with a large firm can involve tough negotia-
tions. An entrepreneur should carefully investigate potential licensees to make 
sure they have a track record of paying licensing fees on time and are easy to 
work with. To obtain this information, it is appropriate to ask a potential licensee 
for references. It is also important that an entrepreneur not give away too much 
in regard to the nature of the proprietary technology in an initial meeting with 
a potential licensee. This challenge means finding the right balance of piquing 
a potential licensee’s interest without revealing too much. Nondisclosure agree-
ments, described in Chapter 7, should be used in discussing proprietary tech-
nologies with a potential licensee.
Merchandise and Character licensing  Merchandise and character 
licensing is the licensing of a recognized trademark or brand that the licensor 
typically controls through a registered trademark or copyright. For example, 
Harley-Davidson licenses its trademark to multiple companies that place the 
Harley trademark on T-shirts, jackets, collectibles, gift items, jewelry, watches, 
bike accessories, and so on. By doing this, Harley not only generates licensing 
income but also promotes the sale of Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Similarly, 
entrepreneurial firms such as eBay and Starbucks license their trademarks not 
only to earn licensing income, but also to promote their products or services to 
a host of current and potential customers.
The key to merchandise and character licensing is to resist the temptation to 
license a trademark too widely and to restrict licensing to product categories that 
have relevance and that appeal to a company’s customers. If a company licenses 
its trademark too broadly, it can lose control of the quality of the products with 
which its trademark is identified. This outcome can diminish the strength of a 
company’s brand. For example, a company such as ModCloth, which is a U.S. 
based online retailer specializing in vintage and vintage-inspired clothing, acces-
sories, and décor, might license its trademark to a watch manufacturer that is 
interested in producing a line of ModCloth women’s watches. ModCloth would 
want to make sure that the watches bearing its trademark were fashionable, 
were of similar quality to its clothing and other products, and were appealing 
to its clientele. ModCloth can enforce these standards through the terms of its 
licensing agreements.
Strategic alliances and Joint ventures
The increase in the popularity of strategic alliances and joint ventures has been 
driven largely by a growing awareness that firms can’t “go it alone” and suc-
ceed.19 As with all forms of firm growth, strategic alliances and joint ventures 
have advantages and disadvantages. We present these points in Table 14.6.

CHAPTER 14 | STRATEGIES FoR Firm Growth    513
Strategic alliances  A strategic alliance is a partnership between two or 
more firms that is developed to achieve a specific goal. Various studies show 
that participation in alliances can boost a firm’s rate of patenting,20 product 
innovation,21 and foreign sales.22 Alliances tend to be informal and do not 
involve the creation of a new entity (such as in a joint venture). Although en-
gaging in alliances can be tremendously helpful for an entrepreneurial firm, 
setting up an alliance and making it work can be tricky. This dimension of alli-
ances is highlighted in this chapter’s “Partnering for Success” feature.
Technological alliances and marketing alliances are two of the most com-
mon forms of alliances.23 Technological alliances feature cooperation in 
research and development, engineering, and manufacturing. Research-and-
development alliances often bring together entrepreneurial firms with specific 
technical skills and larger, more mature firms with experience in development 
and marketing. By pooling their complementary assets, these firms can typically 
produce a product and bring it to market faster and cheaper than either firm 
could alone.24 Pfizer’s blockbuster drug Celebrex, for example, was created via a 
technological alliance. Celebrex is a prescription arthritis medicine. Marketing 
alliances typically match a company that has a distribution system with a com-
pany that has a product to sell in order to increase sales of a product or service. 
For example, an American food company may initiate an alliance with Nestlé (a 
Swiss food company) to gain access to Nestlé’s distribution channels in Europe. 
The strategic logic of this type of alliance for both partners is simple. By finding

as a means of developing economies of scale.

gether.” Also, firms should be leery of entering into an al-
liance if there is any hint that the people who will actually 
implement the alliance aren’t totally on board. The worst-
case scenario is two CEos who meet at a conference 
and start talking about their two firms “working together.” 
If they start kicking around alliance ideas that don’t make 
sense, the mid-level people in an organization need to 
be empowered to hold their ground. The people who 
have to implement the alliance, for both organizations, 
should be heard. If they’re less than enthused about an 
alliance proposal, it should be scrapped.
If an alliance agreement is struck, it should be ac-
companied by a set of operating principles that guide its 
day-to-day operation. It’s also smart to include an “out” 
clause, which allows each party in the alliance to terminate 
its involvement relatively easily.
Making it Work
The biggest obstacle to making an alliance work is that 
the corporate cultures of organizations often vary in sub-
stantially important ways. As a result, the first thing that 
should be determined when deciding how to manage 
an alliance is how decisions are made. A start-up may 
be used to making decisions on the fly, while a large-
company partner may route decisions through several 
committees before a final decision is made. Unless the 
partners know what to expect, frustrations can result.
Each alliance partner should also appoint an internal 
“champion” who has direct responsibility for the alliance’s 
health and progress. “A bunch of people helping out when 
they can” doesn’t cut it. An alliance should have a boss 
inside each involved organization, just as employees have 
bosses.
The individuals who will make the alliance work for 
all the parties involved should also meet face to face. It’s 
normally easier for people to trust one another and work 
together across distances if they’ve met at least one time 
and have had an opportunity to get to know one another 
as individuals.
Questions for Critical Thinking
 1. In what ways is it easy for the founder of a firm to get 
caught up in the potential advantages of participating 
in alliances without remaining equally focused on the 
potential disadvantages?
 2. Think about the partnership arrangements you’ve 
been involved with, even if your experience has been 
limited to working with other students in team settings 
in classes. what are some of the challenges in making 
alliances work that are not mentioned in the feature?
a
lthough alliances are an increasingly popular way 
for entrepreneurial firms to accelerate growth, they 
should be approached strategically and carefully. A 
failed alliance can cause a firm to lose money and can be 
very time consuming and frustrating to exit. Alliances are 
often compared to marriages and other close relation-
ships: easy to get into but very hard to get out of—at 
least gracefully.
There are three key steps in setting up and executing 
a successful alliance relationship. The following are the 
three steps, along with words of advice on how to handle 
each one.
selecting a partner
Any company or group of companies that has some-
thing a firm needs is a potential alliance partner. For 
example, small food companies often partner with 
large food companies to gain access to their distribu-
tion channels. But a company should remember that a 
potential partner is looking for a leg up too, in the form 
of some type of advantage, while competing in the 
marketplace. If the small food company has to give the 
large food company “exclusive” distribution rights to 
its best products to get the deal, it may not be worth it. 
Entering into an alliance should improve a company’s 
situation—it shouldn’t be a jump ball. Alliances take a 
great deal of effort to manage and certainly to manage 
successfully. If each company in an alliance breaks 
even in terms of outcomes, the alliance is not usually 
worth it, because of the time and effort it takes from 
other activities.
Also, a firm should always investigate the reputation 
of the companies it is thinking about partnering with. 
Asking for references of other businesses the company 
is partnering with is appropriate, even if the company 
is well known. If a company is reluctant or unwilling to 
provide references, look elsewhere.
According to Guy Kawasaki, a respected Silicon Valley 
entrepreneur and venture capitalist, most companies form 
alliances for the wrong reason: to make the press and 
analysts happy. Kawasaki says this is foolish. Alliances 
should be formed for one of two reasons in Kawasaki’s 
opinion: to either increase revenues or decrease costs.
Cutting the Deal
negotiating an alliance can take multiple meetings, con-
ference calls, and e-mail messages. So it’s best to cut to 
the chase, as early as possible, to discern if a deal is pos-
sible. It’s easy for a small firm to get sucked into months 
of negotiations with a large company like Facebook or 
Google, only to have the deal fall through. It probably 
won’t hurt Facebook or Google if a handful of its employ-
ees lose time failing to negotiate an alliance agreement 
with a small firm. The lost time on the part of the small firm 
may be much more damaging.

more outlets for its products, the partner that is supplying the product can in-
crease economies of scale and reduce per-unit cost. The partner that supplies 
the distribution channel benefits by adding products to its product line, increas-
ing its attractiveness to those wanting to purchase a wide array of products from 
a single supplier.
Both technological and marketing alliances allow firms to focus on their 
specific area of expertise and partner with others to fill their expertise gaps. 
This approach is particularly attractive to entrepreneurial firms, which often 
lack the financial resources or time to develop all the competencies they need 
to bring final products to market quickly. Michael Dell describes the early 
years of Dell Inc.:
As a small start-up, we didn’t have the money to build the components [used to 
make up a PC] ourselves. But we also asked, “Why should we want to?” Unlike 
many of our competitors, we actually had an option: to buy components from 
the specialists, leveraging the investments they had already made and allowing 
us to focus on what we did best—designing and delivering solutions and systems 
directly to customers. In forging these early alliances with suppliers, we created 
exactly the right strategy for a fast-growing company.25
Joint Ventures  A joint venture is an entity created when two or more firms 
pool a portion of their resources to create a separate, jointly owned organiza-
tion.26 An example is Beverage Partners Worldwide, which is a joint venture 
between Coca-Cola and Nestlé. Formed in 1991, the joint venture markets 
ready-to-drink chilled teas based on green tea and black tea in more than 50 
countries worldwide.
Gaining access to a foreign market is a common reason to form a joint ven-
ture.27 In these cases, the joint venture typically consists of the firm trying to 
reach a foreign market and one or more local partners. Joint ventures created 
for reasons other than foreign market entry are typically described as either 
scale or link joint ventures.28 In a scale joint venture, the partners collaborate 
at a single point in the value chain to gain economies of scale in production or 
distribution. This type of joint venture can be a good vehicle for developing new 
products or services. In a link joint venture, the position of the parties is not 
symmetrical, and the objectives of the partners may diverge. For example, many 
of the joint ventures between American and Canadian food companies provide 
the American partner with access to Canadian markets and distribution chan-
nels and the Canadian partner with the opportunity to add to its product line.
A hybrid form of joint venture that some larger firms utilize is to take 
small equity stakes in promising young companies. In these instances, the 
large companies act in the role of corporate venture capitalists, as explained 
in Chapter 10. Google established a venture capital program in 2009, named 
Google Ventures. Investing in private companies, this program seeks to help 
start-up ventures grow from their initial stages to a point of either issuing 
an initial public offering or being acquired. Notable investments include Nest 
partners for Barnana. Explain how each partner can 
help Barnana either increase its revenue or decrease 
its costs.

Labs, Rocker Lawyer, HomeAway, Uber, 23andMe, and Namo Media.29 Firms 
typically make investments of this nature in companies with the potential to 
be suppliers, customers, or acquisition targets in the future. The equity stake 
provides the large company a “say” in the development of the smaller firm. 
On occasion, the larger firm that has a small equity stake will acquire the 
smaller firm. These transactions are called spin-ins. The opposite of a spin-in 
is a spin-out, which occurs when a larger company divests itself of one of its 
smaller divisions and the division becomes an independent company. Hewlett-
Packard, for example, spun off its test-and-measurement equipment division 
as Agilent Technologies, which advertises itself as the “world’s premiere mea-
surement company.”
Chapter Summary
seeks growth by expanding its operations 
from an initial site to additional locations.
 lO3. International new ventures are businesses 
that, from inception, seek to derive signifi-
cant competitive advantage from the use of 
resources and the sale of outputs in mul-
tiple countries. To successfully use this 
growth strategy, firms must master the 
complexity of profitably selling their prod-
uct or service outside their home, domestic 
market.
 lO4. Through external growth strategies, an 
entrepreneurial firm establishes relation-
ships with third parties. Mergers, acquisi-
tions, strategic alliances, joint ventures, 
licensing, and franchising are examples 
of external growth strategies. We concen-
trate on acquisitions in this chapter given 
their frequency with entrepreneurial firms 
compared to mergers. Acquiring another 
business can fulfill several of a company’s 
needs, such as expanding its product 
line, gaining access to distribution chan-
nels, achieving competitive economies of 
scale, or expanding the company’s geo-
graphic reach. A promising acquisition 
candidate has the following characteris-
tics: operates in a growing industry, has 
proprietary products and/or processes, 
has a well-defined and established mar-
ket position, has a good reputation, is 
involved in very little, if any, litigation, is 
open to the idea of being acquired by an-
other firm, is positioned to readily obtain 
key third-party consent to an acquisition, 
and is located in a geographic area that is 
easily accessible from the acquiring firm’s 
headquarters location. Licensing is the 
 lO1. Internal growth strategies rely on efforts 
generated within the firm itself, such as new 
product development, other product-related 
strategies, international expansion, and 
Internet-driven strategies. External growth 
strategies rely on establishing relationships 
with third parties, such as mergers, acqui-
sitions, licensing, strategic  alliances, joint 
ventures, and franchising. The keys to ef-
fective new product development, which is 
the core internal growth strategy, are as 
follows: find a need and fill it, develop prod-
ucts that add value, get quality and pricing 
right, focus on a specific target market, and 
conduct an ongoing feasibility analysis. The 
reasons that new products fail include an 
inadequate feasibility analysis, overestima-
tion of market potential, bad timing (i.e., 
introducing a product at the wrong time), 
inadequate advertising and promotion, and 
poor service.
 lO2. Improving an existing product or service, 
increasing the market penetration of an ex-
isting product or service, extending prod-
uct lines, and geographic expansion are 
additional internal product growth strate-
gies entrepreneurial firms use. Improving 
an existing product finds a firm creating 
more value for the customer in the form 
of additional product functionality. With 
a market penetration strategy, the firm 
seeks to increase the sales of a product or 
service through greater marketing efforts 
or through increased production capac-
ity and efficiency. To extend a product 
line, a firm typically creates additional 
versions of its product that will appeal to 
a different—that is, new—set of custom-
ers. Through geographic expansion, a firm 

CHAPTER 14 | STRATEGIES FoR Firm Growth    517
Marketing alliances typically match one 
firm with a partner’s distribution system 
that is attractive to the company trying to 
increase sales of its products or services. 
A joint venture is an entity that is created 
when two or more firms pool a portion 
of their resources to create a separate, 
jointly owned organization. In a scale 
joint venture, the partners collaborate at 
a single point in the value chain to gain 
economies of scale in production or distri-
bution by combining their expertise. In a 
link joint venture, the position of the par-
ties is not symmetrical and the objectives 
of the partners may diverge.
granting of permission by one company to 
another company to use a specific form of 
its intellectual property under clearly de-
fined conditions. Virtually any intellectual 
property a company owns can be licensed 
to a third party. Licensing can be a very 
effective way of earning income, particu-
larly for intellectual property–rich firms, 
such as software and biotech companies. 
A strategic alliance is a partnership be-
tween two or more firms that is developed 
to achieve a specific objective or goal. 
Technological alliances involve cooperat-
ing in areas such as research and devel-
opment, engineering, and manufacturing.

business idea: Produce a healthy snack that consists 
of bite-sized morsels of partially dehydrated bananas, 
which are easy to carry and are potassium-rich.
pitch: In 2001, Caue Suplicy moved to the United States 
to pursue a career as a professional triathlete. He often 
carried with him small squares of dehydrated bananas, 
made from a family recipe he learned in Brazil. The small 
squares were an excellent source of potassium and 
other nutrients. After 10 years of competing at an elite 
level, he retired from his professional racing career. 
In 2010, Suplicy created Barnana to share his special 
snack with others.
Barnana is the perfect snack for athletes or anyone with 
an interest in healthy food. As an alternative to traditional 
snacks, Barnana is pioneering the use of the banana’s 
naturally occurring nutritional content. Grown in soil alive 
with nutrients and free of chemicals, Barnana has no ad-
ditives or preservatives and is naturally sweet.
The Barnana treats are bit-sized morsels that can be 
popped into one’s mouth. They are packaged in reseal-
able plastic bags, and are easy to carry on a run, a bike 
ride, or simply for an afternoon snack. They are avail-
able in four varieties—organic original Chewy Banana 
Bites, organic Chocolate Chewy Barnana Bites, organic 
Coconut Chewy Barnana Bites, and organic Peanut 
Butter Chewy Barnana Bites. The small morsels are par-
tially dehydrated bananas that are soft and chewy and 
taste like banana bread. with only one ingredient, pure 
organic banana, they are an exceptional source of potas-
sium and fiber and have over 20 vitamins and minerals. 
Each variety is dairy free, gluten free, non-GMo, Kosher, 
and vegan. Barnana Bites are perfect for people with 
Celiac Disease. Because of their fiber content, they aid 
in digestion, which is a property that people with Celiac 
Disease are generally looking for. Extreme care is taken 
in the growing of the bananas that Barnana Bites are 
made from. The bananas are grown on sustainable, or-
ganic farms in South America.
Barnana Bites are also delicious. They have a chewy 
texture that makes them satisfying for snacking. Each 
morsel is flavorful and is dusted in banana powder with 
no added sugar. The organic Chocolate Chewy Banana 
Bites are covered in 54 percent organic cacao, which 
contains the nutritional benefits of dark chocolate.
Barnana snacks are available across the United States 
at a variety of stores, including whole Foods Markets, 
wegmans, Sprouts, PCC Markets, and other local out-
lets. They are also available via Amazon.com and on 
Barnana’s website.

business idea: Design and manufacture a telepresence 
robot that allows someone to remotely inhabit the body 
of the robot and have the freedom to roam around 
an office building or facility even through the person 
inhabiting the body of the robot is hundreds or thousands 
of miles away.
pitch: There are many circumstances that would cause 
someone to want to be virtually present in one location 
even though they are physically present in another. An 
example would be a scientist or engineer in one location 
wanting to spend a day interacting with colleagues 
in another location. Short-term discussions can be 
facilitated by video-conferencing tools such as Skype. 
But Skype limits participants to a single location where 
they each have access to a monitor that is projecting the 
Skype call. what if someone in one location wants to be 
virtually present in a second location, and wants to be 
able to move from office to office or lab to lab to interact 
with a variety of colleagues?
Double Robotics has created a solution that facilitates 
this type of interaction. The solution is a robot, named 
Double, which has two wheels at its base and a poll that 
extends upwards to eye level. An iPad is mounted on top 
of the poll. You can log onto the iPad from a computer, 
iPad, or iPhone from anywhere in the world and drive the 
robot around while streaming two-way audio and video 
that allows you to interact with anyone who is pres-
ent. There are multiple photos of the Double on Double 
Robotic’s website. It is sleek with a futuristic, minimalist 
design. The poll with the iPad on top is adjustable so it 
can be placed at eye level with people sitting or stand-
ing. The Segway-style base uses high-efficiency motors 
to zip around for up to eight hours on a single charge.

person taking the tour could log onto one of the museum

prospective students tours of colleges or universities.
Several large corporations, including Johnson & Johnson 
and the Coca-Cola Company, are reportedly testing 
Double for telecommuters and for employees who need 
to interact with one another but are situated in different 
geographic locations.

a breeze, while an accelerometer and gyroscope work 
to keep the device stable until you’re done moving it, at 
which point dual kickstands pop out to let the batteries 
take a rest. The Double’s initial price tag is $2,500.
The Double has a number of potential applications. It is 
first and foremost the ultimate tool for colleagues work-
ing in separate locations that need to interact with one 
another. Most workers know how difficult it can be to 
schedule a call or ask someone to set up a computer 
or a laptop for a video chat. with Double one engineer 
or executive can be in Chicago, for example, and if the 
company has a second facility in new York City that has 
a Double robot available, the engineer or executive in 
Chicago can log onto the Double in new York City and 
literally roam from office to office, interacting with his 
or her colleagues who are in a different location. There 
are other potential uses. For example, museums or art 
galleries could offer virtual tours utilizing Double. The 
introduction
Uber is a San Francisco-based start-up that connects 
riders with safe, reliable transportation providers at 
a variety of price points in cities across the world. It 
is growing at a rapid pace. It has expanded from a 
start-up in 2009 to over 60 cities in early 2014. Some 
observers say that Uber may be more valuable than 
Facebook someday. Here’s why.
problem and Solution
Problem. Just in case you’re not familiar with Uber, 
here are the basics. For most people, hailing a cab 
isn’t a pleasant experience. You either stand out-
side and wave your hand until you catch the eye of 
a cabbie, or you call a taxi dispatch (if you have their 
number) and wait for what seems like forever until a 
cab arrives. You ride to your destination in a vanilla 
cab. You then have to scramble to count out the right 
amount of cash plus a tip. The driver never seems to 
have the right change. Very few people see this as an 
enjoyable experience.
Solution. with Uber, you download an app to your 
smartphone and enter your credit card informa-
tion. when you need a ride, you access the app, and 
choose one of several grades of cars, from a luxury 
SUV to a Toyota Prius. You indicate where you want to 
be picked up. Drivers in Uber’s network are circling the 
surrounding area, waiting for a fare. The app is inte-

Uber has made one strategic move that has irritated 
riders. It recently implemented a policy referred to as 
surge pricing. During rush hour and other times of peak 
ridership (like Halloween or new Year’s Eve), it increases 
its prices. In some instances, fares increase to several 
times their normal level. The idea behind surge pricing 
is to reach an economic equilibrium by attracting more 
drivers. In many cities, it’s difficult to get a cab at peak 
times. There are just too many riders seeking a fixed 
number of drivers. Surge pricing encourages a larger 
number of Uber drivers to make themselves available at 
peak times, because they can make more money. Uber 
feels the practice is necessary and works, but some 
customers see it as price gouging.
A tragic incident happened in December 2013. An 
Uber driver accidently struck and killed a six-year-old 
girl, and injured several others. Although the driver was 
not carrying Uber-arranged passenger at the time, the 
girl’s family filed a wrongful death suit against Uber, 
claiming the driver was using Uber’s mobile app at the 
time of the accident. The accident and lawsuit have pro-
vided additional ammunition to those that oppose Uber, 
arguing that the service is inherently dangerous.
Uber has not had difficulty raising money. It has 
all the ingredients that professional investors look for, 
including a disruptive business idea, rapid growth, a 
large potential market, and aggressive plans for expan-
sion. According to Crunchbase, Uber has raised the 
following rounds of funding:
■ $200,000 seed funding (Aug. 2009)
■ $1.3 million angel round (oct. 2010)
■ $11 million Series A round (Feb. 14, 2011)
■ $37 million Series B round (Dec. 7, 2011)
■ $258 million Series C round (Aug. 23, 2013)
■ $1.2 billion Series D round (Jun. 6, 2014)
Its stable of investors is also impressive, including 
Amazon CEo Jeff Bezos, Goldman Sachs, Google 
Ventures, Fidelity Investments, and Benchmark Venture 
Capital.
uber’s aggressive plans for Growth
The size of the investments in Uber, and the bold pre-
diction that Uber may someday have a larger market 
capitalization value than Facebook, are driven by its 
aggressive growth plans. The consensus is that Uber 
is hoping for three distinct phases of growth, each of 
which is bolder and more ambitious than its predeces-
sor. Phases 1 and 2 have already begun, with Phase 3 
hopefully to follow. The three phases are depicted in the 
figure below.
Phase 1: Disrupt the taxi industry. Uber is out to 
 disrupt or kill the taxi industry. It simply sees itself as a 
better solution for getting people from point A to point 
B quickly and safely than taxicabs. At the time this case 
was written in the summer of 2014, the firm was operat-
ing in 22 countries and 60 cities—an amazing feat for 
a company that launched in 2009. By all accounts it is 
well-run, well-funded, and is growing its infrastructure 
at a pace consistent with its growth. It’s also extremely 
Uber app. For an example $30 fare, Uber keeps about 
$6.00 (20 percent) and the driver gets the rest. All Uber 
rides are protected by the driver’s insurance policy as 
well as Uber’s corporate policy.
The attractiveness of Uber is that it has completely 
taken the friction out of the experience of buying a ride. 
no more hailing cabs, no more plain-vanilla cars, no 
more fumbling for change to pay. The ride is an enjoy-
able experience rather than a hassle.
uber
Uber was founded by Garrett Camp and Travis 
Kalanick. Kalanick is the driving force behind the com-
pany’s design and growth. It launched in San Francisco 
in 2009, and arranged its first rides in June 2010. Six 
months later, it had more than 3,000 users and had 
 facilitated between 10,000 and 20,000 rides. Its initial 
target market was the tech community, which is typi-
cally quick to embrace new things. San Francisco is 
also known for a spotty taxi industry, so an alterna-
tive garnered attention. Uber grew largely via word of 
mouth. It had a certain “cool” factor in that early adopt-
ers could impress their friends with the ability to call 
a certain type of car from their phone with a couple of 
taps. The firm also benefited from the fact that many 
of its early users talked up the service on social media. 
According to some reports, 95 percent of Uber riders 
heard about the service from other Uber riders.
Although Uber has grown rapidly, there are methodi-
cal aspects to its growth. It grows city by city. Each new 
city has a launch team, which forges partnerships with 
local organizations, creates events that promote Uber’s 
service, and reaches out to local businesses. It typically 
offers one to two weeks of free rides in a new commu-
nity, to kick-start its service. In each new city, Uber has 
the challenge of building a two-sided marketplace. It has 
to recruit both riders and drivers. on the driver side, it 
actively recruits both independent operators and car ser-
vice owners to participate in its service, offering sign-on 
 bonuses and ongoing incentives. It does not require an 
exclusive arrangement. As a result, a car service owner 
can maintain his or her service and drive for Uber too.
Uber has stirred up controversy. As it enters new 
cities, it has been sued numerous times, primarily by 
taxi-industry advocates and local governments, trying 
to protect their existing taxi cab industry. In most cases, 
it has successfully fought off the suits, but not every-
where. Uber is currently banned in Miami, Florida, and 
Austin, Texas. It was forced to shut down in Vancouver, 
Canada. A Vancouver regulatory agency ruled that Uber 
was a limousine service, and the minimum charge for 
a limousine ride was $75, regardless of the distance of 
the trip. That made Uber uncompetitive. In most cases, 
Uber has prevailed because of public support for its 
service. In washington, D.C., for example, a regulatory 
agency tried to pass a law to prohibit on-demand se-
dan services, which was an attack on Uber. Uber users 
raised such an uproar on social media that the objection 
was quickly dropped. In some European cities, taxi cab 
drivers have picketed airports and deliberately tied up 
traffic to object to Uber entering their communities.

Uber’s Three “Hoped 
For” Phases of Growth
There are also futuristic versions of what Uber may 
someday look like, which surpass Phase 3. one of 
Uber’s principle investors is Google Ventures. Google 
is working on self-driving cars. Use your imagination to 
envision a world that would combine self-driving cars 
with Uber’s ability to dispatch and track vehicles effi-
ciently and effectively.
challenges ahead
Uber is not without compelling challenges. The popularity 
of its service has attracted competitors. Sidecar and Lyft 
are well-funded rivals that are competing toe-to-toe with 
Uber in many markets. The taxi industry, which Uber is 
bent on killing, will not go down without a fight. In many 
areas, regulators and advocates of the traditional taxi 
industry are upping their legal challenges to Uber and 
its service. How this will ultimately play out is unknown. 
The press is currently on Uber’s side, primarily because 
the company is pro-consumer and delivers a high-quality 
product. If it becomes too disruptive, however, and starts 
killing off local delivery services, local courier services, 
etc., along with taxies, how the press and public in gen-
eral will react is anyone’s bet.
discussion Questions
 14-36. Uber’s organic or internal growth to this point in the 
firm’s life is quite dramatic. The following statement 
appears in this chapter: “Effective though it can be, 
there are limits to internal growth.” Given its striking 
internal growth to date, does the statement from the 
chapter apply to Uber? why or why not?
 14-37. The top five reasons new products fail are presented 
in Table 14.2. If Uber were to fail, which of these five 
reasons would be most likely to explain the firm’s 
failure? why?
 14-38. Some firms might find Uber to be an attractive ac-
quisition candidate. why would this be the case? 
what type of firm or firms might be interested in 
acquiring Uber?
 14-39. If Uber were to consider participating in a strategic 
alliance, what type of firm might be an appropriate 
partner for Uber and why? If you were a consultant, 
would you advise Uber to form a strategic alliance 
as part of its growth efforts? why or why not?

smart. For example, Uber has lined up $2.5 billion in 
outside financing for low-interest car loans for UberX 
drivers. That will make it possible for up to 200,000 
drivers to buy their own cars at very low interest rates, 
under the condition that they use the cars on the Uber 
network for the duration of the loan. If they drop out of 
the Uber network, their interest rate will balloon for the 
remainder of the loan. This strategy helps Uber in two 
important ways. It will add to Uber’s supply of drivers 
and will enhance the stability of its driver force. If this 
experiment works, Uber may repeat it and add even 
more drivers. The more Uber drivers, the more cities 
Uber can expand to, the shorter the wait times for Uber 
riders, the lower the cost per ride, and the more efficient 
and profitable the entire system becomes.
Phase 2: Make it Increasingly Unnecessary to Own 
a Car. As Uber becomes more ubiquitous, and the cost 
per ride goes down, there will be less and less need 
for people to own cars. In areas where Uber is present 
and pickup times are quick, this is already starting to 
happen. while Uber’s most obvious competitor is taxis, 
interestingly a large number of Uber users never take 
taxis. They use Uber instead of driving their car, par-
ticularly when they think parking will be a hassle or will 
be exorbitantly expensive. Some observers see Uber 
as part of an overall movement called the “death of the 
ownership society.” The problem with owning a car, 
 advocates of this view would say, is that it sits idle most 
of the time, so it is uneconomical to own. Uber would 
like people to eventually think in terms of “buying a ride” 
to get from Point A to Point B rather than owning and 
driving a car to cover the same distance. To make this 
work, Uber will need to have a dense enough presence 
that people can get rides quickly and reliably to cover 
the distance they need to travel.
Phase 3: Start Delivering Everything. The third phase 
of growth is the most exciting. Uber would like to grow 
beyond providing rides, and become a transporta-
tion network for all kinds of deliveries, including food, 
prescription drugs, retail products, etc. Uber is often 
compared to Amazon. Amazon started as a bookseller 
in 1994, and quickly realized that the efficient warehous-
ing and shipping infrastructure that it had built could 
be used to sell all kinds of things to consumers. So the 
firm branched out, and it now sells items as diverse as 
kitchen utensils, tools, and paper towels. Uber could 
theoretically do the same. once its network of drivers 
is sufficiently dense, along with transporting people, 
it could start delivering nearly anything. This ambition 
is the reason Uber recently changed its tagline from 
“Everyone’s private driver” to “where lifestyle meets 
logistics.”

introduction
How did Mint.com go from launch to a $170 million 
 acquisition in 24 months? The answer isn’t as spec-
tacular as you might think. Using a football metaphor, 
Mint.com did it more through blocking and tackling than 
through big plays. Mint.com’s story is one of how a start-
up that solves a real problem, and executes very well, 
can overcome obstacles and win the support of others. 
It’s also a story of how a small company can take on a 
big rival, and by positioning itself for the future rather 
than the past, can motivate the rival to acquire it rather 
than trying to put it out of business through aggressive 
competition. Let’s see how all of this took place.
aaron patzer
Aaron Patzer started Mint.com when he was just 
25. After earning degrees from Duke and Princeton, 
he took a job with nascentric, a Silicon Valley start-
up. During this time, he was managing his personal 
 finances with Quicken and Microsoft Money, and be-
came increasingly frustrated with his experiences. He 
asked around and found others who were aggravated 
with these products and personal finance in general. 
He started thinking about how to build a product that 
would not only be an improvement on Quicken and 
Microsoft Money, but would make the entire process 
of managing money more efficient and potentially 
rewarding.
Patzer struggled with whether to act on his in-
stincts and eventually decided to move forward. His 
thought process during this period is best illustrated 
through his own words. In an interview with Carson 
McComas, the creator of workHappy.net, a popular 
blog, Patzer reflected on how he made the decision to 
quit his job and focus on Mint.com full time:
I began to think about the business nights and 
weekends. But it’s hard to find time when you’ve 
got a full-time (and very demanding) job. one day 
I said to myself, “If you give it 100% and fail, I can 
live with that. But I can’t live with going half-way, 
part-time.” So on March 1, [2006], I quit my job and 
began working on Mint. The first few months were 
tough, and I basically oscillated day to day between 
thinking “This is the greatest idea ever” and “This 
will never work.” who am I to take on Intuit (the 
maker of Quicken) and Microsoft? If this was a 
good idea, someone would have done it before.
Patzer went on to say that the thing that gave him the 
most inner confidence was that he knew he was excep-
tionally good at one thing: algorithms—the key to com-
puter programming. He also knew he was persistent 
and extremely passionate about his idea.
prelaunch Stage—March 2006 until 
September 2007
Patzer worked 14 to 16 hours a day, almost 7 days per 
week, from March 2006 to the fall of the same year 
banging out the early prototype of Mint.com. needing 
money to make key hires, improve on Mint.com’s con-
sumer interface, and buy servers, Patzer approached 
several investors. none bit. The problem was the way 
Mint.com was set up. Quicken and Microsoft Money 
were software products that people bought and then 
installed on their computers. Mint.com was an online 
dashboard. when you signed up for a Mint.com ac-
count, it asked you to provide all of your bank, credit 
card, and investment account information, user IDs, 
and passwords. Mint.com, through a partnership with 
a financial services firm named Yodlee, could then 
“scrape” the sites of your bank and credit card details, 
and provide a real-time update of your financial informa-
tion. It could also e-mail you due date reminders, low-
balance alerts, unusual activity alerts, and the like. A 
user could log onto his or her Mint.com account at any 
time and see all of his or her account information on a 
single screen. This is the better experience that Patzer 
was looking for. The average American has 11 sepa-
rate bank, credit card, loan, and investment accounts. 
Patzer’s idea was that having a single place where 
all the account information is displayed and updated 
on a consistent basis would be a superior customer 
experience.
The investors all said the same thing. People will 
not trust a start-up with their account information—let 
alone their user IDs and passwords. Patzer persisted. 
In September 2006 he found an investor that believed 
in his vision and was able to persuade a venture capital 
firm to go along. Mint.com’s first round of funding was 
$750,000, with $325,000 from First Round Capital and 
$425,000 from other investors.
Two things helped Mint.com raise more money. 
The first was carefully explaining the security aspects 
of its service, not only to potential investors but to liter-
ally anyone who would listen. Mint.com is a read-only 
system. what this means is that even if someone broke 
into its system, they couldn’t steal someone’s money or

CHAPTER 14 | STRATEGIES FoR Firm Growth    525
Mint.com is free to the user. Its revenue model is to 
make referrals to its users, and then collect affiliate fees 
when its users follow through. For example, if Mint.com 
sees that a specific user is paying 16.9 percent inter-
est on a credit card, and the user is financially sound, it 
will suggest a lower-interest rate credit card. If the user 
takes the offer, Mint.com makes a small commission.
Buoyed by its TechCrunch40 win and steady 
growth, Mint.com raised $31 million through several 
venture capital rounds from September 2007 until mid-
2009. The purpose of the capital was to build out the 
company’s infrastructure to accommodate its growth. 
During this period, Patzer remained Mint.com’s primary 
spokesperson and evangelist. He would accept almost 
any opportunity to talk about Mint.com and its story. As 
a result, Mint.com’s growth was paralleled by persistent 
public relations efforts on the part of the company to 
keep itself in the news and on the minds of journalists 
and bloggers.
In late 2009, just prior to the Intuit acquisition, Mint.
com had 1.5 million users tracking nearly $50 billion in 
assets. It was also widely considered to be one of the 
up-and-coming web 2.0 companies.
the intuit acquisition—September 2009
Intuit acquired Mint.com in September 2009, just 24 
months after Mint.com launched. That’s a quick run-
up to an acquisition. Venture capitalists, for example, 
typically have a three- to five-year investment horizon, 
meaning they’d like to see the companies they invest 
in get acquired or launch an IPo sometime during that 
period. Most of the Mint.com investors monetized their 
investment in 24 months or less.
For its part, Intuit was a strong company in 2009, 
with over $1.1 billion in sales and several marquee prod-
ucts, including Quicken, Quick Books, and TurboTax. 
But it was also a boxed software company, struggling to 
gain a footing on the web. Its fear was that web-based 
services like Mint.com represented the future, while 
boxed software products like Quicken represented the 
past. In June 2009, Microsoft contributed to this fear by 
discontinuing sales of Microsoft Money, its boxed finan-
cial software product. In the end, many analysts believe 
it was a no-brainer for Intuit to buy Mint.com. It gave 
Intuit a quick entry into the web-based side of personal 
financial management.
The acquisition was also good timing for Mint.
com. Patzer and his team were interested in continu-
ing to accelerate Mint.com’s growth. Intuit had the 
financial resources to do that, and by being part of a 
large  company, Patzer could focus solely on product 
development rather than raising funds. one of the 
conditions of the deal was that Patzer was able to 
continue to operate Mint.com in an autonomous man-
ner. He was also named general manager of Intuit’s 
personal finance division. As an added bonus for 
Intuit, Patzer’s charge was not only to continue to 
build Mint.com, but to instill some of its web savvy 
into other Intuit products.
even move it around. They could just look at account 
balances and how people spent their money. In addi-
tion, Mint.com had bank-level security in place from the 
outset. It had the same level of encryption and back-end 
protections that a bank did. Mint.com also did some-
thing very smart. It turned the security issue on its head. 
It argued that rather than putting people at risk, it actu-
ally protected people’s finances. By allowing its custom-
ers to view all of their financial information at a single 
site, customers could quickly log on to their account 
and scan their financial information to see if anything 
seemed out of place. In addition, it sent its customers 
low-balance and unusual activity alerts.
The second thing that helped Mint.com raise 
 additional money is that it won TechCrunch40, a high-
profile business plan competition, in the fall of 2007. 
TechCrunch40, which was later named TechCrunch50, 
was a prestigious business plan competition that ran 
from 2007 to 2009. Looking back, Patzer says that the 
seven minutes he had to pitch Mint.com at the com-
petition were the seven most important minutes of his 
life. The conference was an enormous platform. It was 
well attended by press, investors, and large companies 
looking for strategic partners. over 700 companies 
applied for the 2007 competition. The top 40 were 
chosen to present. winning gave Mint.com the outside 
validation it needed to move beyond the small group of 
investors that believed in it to a larger group that was 
now willing to give it a second look. It also explains 
Mint.com’s fast start with users. The enormous press 
generated by the TechCrunch40 win placed Mint.com’s 
name in front of an untold number of people in a very 
positive manner.
During this time, Mint.com was intently focused 
on execution. one of the rules of TechCrunch40 was 
that the competitors had to be at the prelaunch stage, 
so Mint.com was still in a testing mode. Patzer made 
his first key hires. His first hire was Jason Putori, the 
designer who had built Apple.com, to plan and design 
Mint.com’s customer interface. According to Patzer, 
Putori cared about every pixel, and it showed in the 
beauty and functionality of the site. Putori brought 
people into Mint.com offices, literally right off the street, 
to test the site and see where the rough spots were. He 
brought in young people, old people, men, women—as 
diverse of a group as he could find. Patzer’s third hire 
was David Michaels, VP of Engineering. Michaels had 
15 years of experience in security, including financial 
web services.
two years as an independent company—
September 2007 until September 2009
Mint.com formally launched in September 2007, just 
after TechCrunch40. The skeptics were wrong. In its first 
four months it signed up 100,000 people, all of whom 
entered their financial information, including account 
numbers, user IDs, and passwords, into Mint.com. Mint.
com didn’t have a single security breach. Its numbers 
accelerated through the end of 2007 and into 2008.

hen Chelsea Sloan was young she lived with her family for a period of time 
in Ohio where her father was a shopping center redevelopment manager. 
Her mother shopped resale stores to help clothe her four children, all of 
whom were under age ten (two additional children came later). One 
store that caught the attention of Sloan’s parents was Once Upon a 
Child, a store that bought and sold gently used children’s clothing. 
Her parents considered buying a Once Upon a Child franchise, but 
thought they could improve upon the concept. So they moved the 
family to Utah to develop a children’s clothing franchise organiza-
tion of their own. In 1992, they opened the first Kid to Kid resale 
store with fixtures they made themselves. Although initial sales were 
modest, they quickly developed a successful business model, and 
have grown Kid to Kid to over 100 franchise locations in the United 
States and Portugal.
By the time Sloan was 10 she was working in Kid to Kid stores, 
helping tag merchandise, cleaning toys, and doing odd jobs. As 
the child of entrepreneurs, she participated in numerous dinnertime 
conversations that centered on franchising and related topics. By 
2006, Sloan was a student at Brigham Young University, and she 
had already helped open and run multiple Kid to Kid stores. At the 
University of Utah, her older brother Scott was finishing his degree 
in marketing and was working for Kid to Kid. The two knew they 
wanted to own their own company, and they decided to work to-
gether. They kicked around several ideas and settled on an upscale 
resale store for gently used men’s and women’s clothing. They would 
differentiate themselves by creating a store atmosphere that felt like the mall, not like a 
thrift shop. They would hand select their product so that the clothing was clean, fresh, 
and stylish as well.
The business didn’t come together immediately. Sloan took a one-and-a-half-
year break to do a mission in Alaska. While she was gone, she and her brother Scott 
corresponded frequently, sharing ideas about the potential business. One thing that 
took some time was choosing a name. It had to be a name that was catchy, was 
trademarkable, and had an available URL. After considering hundreds of alterna-
tives, they settled on Uptown Cheapskate. They also talked about their growth 
strategy, long before opening their first (or pilot) location. They wanted to grow

quickly without having to make huge investments in store locations. They settled on 
franchising.
When Sloan returned from her mission, she arrived in Salt Lake City at 10:00 a.m. 
and was working on Uptown Cheapskate with her brother by 2:00 p.m. the same 
day. They knew that to become a successful franchise organization, they had to 
consistently deliver as much value to their franchisees as the franchisees paid them 
in franchise fees and royalties. As a result, Sloan and her brother spent the next 
eight months fine-tuning the Uptown Cheapskate concept. They focused on the 
critical aspects of building both the front end and the back end of a unique retail 
offering. One of the first things they worked on was creating a proprietary software 
platform that would allow their franchisees to quickly determine what to pay for an 
item brought into the store. The trick in developing this type of system is to pay 
people fairly for items brought in while leaving room to price the items competitively 
for shoppers and make a profit. The platform also had to be populated with the cur-
rent brands, clothing selections, and reasonable price ranges. Building this platform 
took months, but it was completed. A lot of thought was also put into the Uptown 
Cheapskate brand, store layout, and sales reporting mechanisms for franchisees.
The first Uptown Cheapskate opened in mid-2009 in Salt Lake City, Utah. The first 
franchise was sold later that year to an individual in greensboro, north Carolina. The 
company has grown steadily since, with two stores after Year 1, six stores after Year 
2, 14 stores after Year 3 and upwards of 40 stores today. The average store earns a 
net profit of over six figures, which is excellent in the retail store industry. As a result 
of these numbers, many of the company’s franchisees are opening multiple locations. 
Sloan and her brother credit much of their success to the upfront work they did in 
fleshing out the Uptown Cheapskate concept and the support they offer their franchi-
sees. The following is a partial list of the types of support that Uptown Cheapskate 
offers to their franchisees:
■ Proprietary Software Platform. Referred to above, the platform allows a franchi-
see’s buyer to quickly determine what to pay for items brought into the store. Over 
time, the platform has become very robust. It now contains over 4,000 brands 
and nearly 300 subcategories. If a seller brings in a pair of gently worn size-five 
Abercrombie & Fitch women’s jeans, for example, the platform will instantly pro-
vide a price range to offer for the garment. This feature allows a single buyer to 
purchase hundreds of pieces of merchandise per day, and pay an intelligent price 
for each piece of merchandise acquired.
■ Franchise in a Box. Uptown Cheapskate helps franchisees configure their stores. 
Based on a description of the available space, the franchisee is provided a plan for 
exactly how to build out the store, arrange the fixtures, and display the merchan-
dise. This service allows a franchisee to get up and running quickly.
■ Buyer Training. Franchisees are provided substantial support in terms of knowing 
what fashions and articles of clothing are hot and are likely to sell well and which 
aren’t. The training is provided in the form of monthly podcasts, training videos, 
and other forms of support.
■ Marketing Materials. Uptown maintains an in-house marketing team that develops 
everything from in-store signage to radio ads to billboards and mass media.
■ Back-end Systems to Track Sales and Other Metrics. Uptown owners have access to 
back-end reports that update store numbers in live time. For example, a franchisee 

CHAPTER 15 | FRAnCHISIng    531
can compare their sales and other metrics against the other stores. The company has 
found that this functionality results in healthy competition among franchisees. A suite 
of back-end systems has been developed, which track sales and other metrics.
Uptown Cheapskate continues to grow with the goal of having 100 franchises by the 
end of 2016. The firm is routinely listed in Entrepreneur magazine’s Franchise 500 along 
with its sister company, Kid to Kid. Sloan enjoys talking about franchising, and says 
that one of her most enjoyable experiences is sharing her story with college students. In 
november 2012, Sloan became the first female to win the Entrepreneurs’ Organization’s 
global Student Entrepreneur Award. The competition included 1,700 candidates from 20 
countries. In 2013, Sloan was named as one of Inc. magazine’s 30 under 30.
As with Uptown Cheapskate, many retail and service organizations find franchising 
to be an attractive form of business ownership and growth.1 In some industries, such as 
automotive and retail food, franchising is a dominant business ownership. Franchising 
is less common in other industries, although it is used in industries as diverse as 
Internet service providers, furniture restoration, personnel staffing, and senior care.
There are instances in which franchising is not appropriate. For example, new 
technologies are typically not introduced through franchise systems, particularly if 
the technology is proprietary or complex. Why? Because by its nature, franchising 
involves sharing of knowledge between a franchisor and its franchisees; in large 
franchise organizations, thousands of people may be involved in doing this. The 
inventors of new technologies typically involve as few people as possible in the pro-
cess of rolling out their new products or services because they want to keep their 
trade secrets secret. They typically reserve their new technologies for their own use 
or license them to a relatively small number of companies, with strict confidentiality 
agreements in place.2
Still, franchising is a common method of business expansion and is growing in 
popularity. In 2014, there were 770,368 individual franchise outlets operating in the 
United States. These operations accounted for 8.5 million jobs and a combined eco-
nomic output of $839 billion. These numbers have grown steadily since 2010.3 You 
can even go to a website (www.franchising.com) to examine the array of franchises 
available for potential entrepreneurs to consider. This website groups franchising op-
portunities by industry, state, investment required, and several other criteria. These 
categorizations highlight the breadth of franchising opportunities now available for 
consideration.4
Unfortunately, not all the news about franchising is positive. Some entire franchise 
systems fail. In addition, some individual franchisees fail, even if they are a part of an 
otherwise successful system. Franchising is also a relatively poorly understood form 
of business ownership and growth. While most students and entrepreneurs generally 
know what franchising is and what it entails, the many subtle aspects of franchising 
can be learned only through experience or careful study.

e begin this chapter, which is dedicated to franchising as an important 
potential path to entrepreneurship and subsequent venture growth, 
with a description of franchising and when to use it. We then explore 
setting up a franchise system from the franchisor’s perspective and buying a 
franchise from the franchisee’s point of view. Next, we look at the legal aspects 
of franchising. We close this chapter by considering a few additional topics re-
lated to the successful use of franchising.

What is Franchising and How Does 
it Work?
Franchising is a form of business organization in which a firm that already 
has a successful product or service (franchisor) licenses its trademark and 
method of doing business to other businesses (franchisees) in exchange for an 
initial franchise fee and an ongoing royalty.5 Some franchisors are established 
firms; others are first-time enterprises that entrepreneurs are launching. This 
section explores the origins of franchising and how franchising works.
What is Franchising?
The word franchise comes from an old dialect of French and means “privilege” 
or “freedom.” Franchising has a long history. In the Middle Ages kings and 
lords granted franchises to specific individuals or groups to hunt on their land 
or to conduct certain forms of commerce. In the 1840s, breweries in Germany 
granted franchises to certain taverns to be the exclusive distributors of their 
beer for the region. Shortly after the U.S. Civil War, the Singer Sewing Machine 
Company began granting distribution franchises for its sewing machines and 
pioneered the use of written franchise agreements. Many of the most familiar 
franchises in the United States, including Kentucky Fried Chicken (1952), 
McDonald’s (1955), Burger King (1955), Midas Muffler (1956), and H&R Block 
(1958), started in the post–World War II era of the 1940s and 1950s.
The franchise organization Comfort Keepers demonstrates how franchises 
are started. A year before the company was founded, Kristina Clum, a regis-
tered nurse, noticed that her parents were having trouble with ordinary daily 
chores. She wanted someone to come into their home to help them but was un-
able to find people willing to do so. So Kristina and her husband Jerry founded 
a business dedicated to helping seniors cope with everyday nonmedical tasks, 
such as meal preparation, light housekeeping, grocery shopping, laundry, and 
errands. The first Comfort Keepers office was opened in Springfield, Ohio, in 
March 1998, and the second was opened in Dayton a year later.
Comfort Keepers is a timely idea that addresses a need for a particular 
target market. As we’ve discussed in earlier chapters, having a solid busi-
ness idea is critical to achieving firm growth. In 2013, 14.1 percent of the U.S. 
population, or 44.6 million people, were 65 years old or older.6 That number 
is expected to steadily increase. Comfort Keepers’s services may provide some 
seniors the option of staying in their homes as opposed to entering more 
costly assisted living centers. In August 1999, the company began franchising, 
and by 2014 it had over 700 franchise outlets throughout the United States, 
Canada, Ireland, Australia, France, Portugal, and Singapore.7
The Comfort Keepers business idea lends itself to franchising because the 
company has a good trademark and a good business method. Moreover, be-
cause the nature of the business keeps the cost of starting a Comfort Keepers 
franchise relatively low, there is a substantial pool of people available to pur-
chase the franchise. For Comfort Keepers and its franchisees, franchising 
is a win-win proposition. Comfort Keepers wins because it is able to use its 
franchisees’ money to quickly grow its business and strengthen its brand. The 
franchisees win because they are able to start a business in a growing industry 
relatively inexpensively and benefit by adopting the Comfort Keepers trademark 
and method of doing business.
how Does Franchising Work?
There is nothing magical about franchising. It is a form of growth that allows a 
business to get its products or services to market through the efforts of business 
learning ObjeCtive

ownership works.

CHAPTER 15 | FRAnCHISIng    533
partners or “franchisees.” As described previously, a franchise is an agreement 
between a franchisor (the parent company, such as Uptown Cheapskate or 
Comfort Keepers) and a franchisee (an individual or firm that is willing to pay 
the franchisor a fee for the right to sell its product, service, and/or business 
method).8 Planet Smoothie, for example, is a very successful franchise system. 
The franchisor (Planet Smoothie, Inc.) provides the rights to individual busi-
nesspersons (the local franchisees) to use the Planet Smoothie trademark and 
business methods. In turn, the franchisees pay Planet Smoothie a franchise 
fee and an ongoing royalty for these privileges and agree to operate their Planet 
Smoothie restaurants according to Planet Smoothie Inc.’s standards.
There are two distinctly different types of franchise systems: the product 
and trademark franchise and the business format franchise. A product and 
trademark franchise is an arrangement under which the franchisor grants to 
the franchisee the right to buy its products and use its trade name. This ap-
proach typically connects a single manufacturer with a network of dealers or 
distributors. For example, General Motors has established a network of dealers 
that sell GM cars and use the GM trademark in their advertising and promo-
tions. Similarly, ExxonMobil has established a network of franchisee-owned 
gasoline stations to distribute its gasoline. Product and trademark franchisees 
are typically permitted to operate in a fairly autonomous manner. The parent 
company, such as GM or ExxonMobil, is generally concerned more with main-
taining the integrity of its products than with monitoring the day-to-day activi-
ties of its dealers or station owners. Other examples of product and trademark 
franchise systems include agricultural machinery dealers, soft-drink bottlers, 
and beer distributorships. Rather than obtaining a royalty or franchise fee, the 
product and trademark franchisor obtains the majority of its income from sell-
ing its products to its dealers or distributors at a markup.
The second type of franchise, the business format franchise, is by far the 
more popular approach to franchising and is more commonly used by entre-
preneurs and entrepreneurial ventures. In a business format franchise, the 
franchisor provides a formula for doing business to the franchisee along with 
training, advertising, and other forms of assistance. Table 15.1 shows 10 in-
dustries in which business format franchises predominate. While a business

format franchise provides a franchisee a formula for conducting business, it 
can also be very rigid and demanding. For example, fast-food restaurants such 
as McDonald’s and Burger King teach their franchisees every detail of how to 
run their restaurants, from how many seconds to cook french fries to the exact 
words their employees should use when they greet customers (such as “Will this 
be dining in or carry out?”). Business format franchisors obtain the majority of 
their revenues from their franchisees in the form of royalties and franchise fees.
For both product and trademark franchises and business format franchises, 
the franchisor–franchisee relationship takes one of three forms of a franchise 
agreement (see Figure 15.1). The most common type of franchise arrangement 
is an individual franchise agreement. An individual franchise agreement 
involves the sale of a single franchise for a specific location. For example, an 
individual may purchase a Play It Again Sports franchise to be constructed and 
operated at 901 Pearl Street in Boulder, Colorado. An area franchise agree-
ment allows a franchisee to own and operate a specific number of outlets in a 
particular geographic area. For example, a franchisee may purchase the rights 
to open five Play It Again Sports franchises within the city limits of Sioux Falls, 
South Dakota. This is a very popular franchise arrangement, because in most 
cases it gives the franchisee exclusive rights for a given area. Finally, a master 
franchise agreement is similar to an area franchise agreement, with one major 
difference. A master franchisee, in addition to having the right to open and oper-
ate a specific number of locations in a particular area, also has the right to offer 
and sell the franchise to other people in its area. For example, ProntoWash is a 
mobile car washing service that uses environmentally friendly soaps, waxes, and 
other products. The company sells master franchise agreements that provide a 
master franchisee the right to open a certain number of ProntoWash outlets in 
a defined geographic area. After its own outlets have been opened, the master 
franchisee can then sell the rights to open additional ProntoWash locations in 
the same area to other individuals.9 The people who buy franchises from master 
franchisees are typically called subfranchisees.
A person who owns and operates more than one outlet of the same fran-
chisor, whether through an area or a master franchise agreement, is called a 
multiple-unit franchisee. For the franchisee, there are advantages and disad-
vantages to multiple-unit franchising. By owning more than one unit, a multi-
ple-unit franchisee can capture economies of scale and reduce its administra-
tive overhead per unit of sale. The disadvantages of multiple-unit franchising 
are that the franchisor takes more risk and makes a deeper commitment to 
a single franchisee. In general, franchisors encourage multiple-unit franchis-
ing. By selling an additional franchise to an existing franchisee, a franchisor

establishing a Franchise system
Establishing a franchise system should be approached carefully and deliber-
ately. While the process is a familiar one to a company such as McDonald’s, 
which at the end of 2013 had 35,429 restaurants in 119 countries,10 franchis-
ing is an unfamiliar process to a new franchise organization. Franchising is a 
complicated business endeavor, which means that an entrepreneur must look 
closely at all of its aspects before deciding to franchise. Indeed, franchising of-
ten involves the managerially demanding tasks of training, supporting, super-
vising, and nurturing franchisees.
An entrepreneur should also be aware that over the years a number of 
fraudulent franchise organizations have come and gone and left financially

ruined franchisees in their wake. Because of this, franchising is fairly heavily 
regulated. Even with this regulation, though, caution is in order for those pur-
suing franchising as a business opportunity.
Despite the challenges, franchising is a popular form of growth. It is par-
ticularly attractive to new firms in retailing and services because it helps firms 
grow and alleviates the challenge of raising substantial amounts of money. 
There is some anecdotal evidence, however, that many companies are hasty in 
putting together their franchise programs and as a result do a poorer job than 
they might have were they to take their time.11 Although franchising is often 
touted as an easy way to rapidly expand a business, an effective franchise 
system needs to be as consciously initiated, managed, and supported as any 
other form of business expansion.12 An example of a franchise organization 
that has been consciously managed and has grown in a sensible manner is 
Wahoo’s Fish Taco, as illustrated in the “Savvy Entrepreneurial Firm” feature.
Now let’s look more closely at the issues to consider when an entrepreneur is 
trying to decide if franchising is an appropriate approach to growing a business.
When to Franchise
Retail firms grow when two things happen: first, when the attractiveness of a 
firm’s products or services become well known, whether it is a new restaurant 
or a fitness center, and, second, when a firm has the financial capability to 
build the outlets needed to satisfy the demand for its products or services.
There are at least two options firms have as a means to grow. Building 
company-owned outlets is one of these options. However, this choice presents a 
company with the challenge of raising the money to fund its expansion. As dis-
cussed in Chapter 10, this option is typically pursued through debt, investment 
capital, or earnings, none of which is easy to achieve for a start-up venture.
Franchising is a second growth alternative available to firms. Franchising 
is perhaps especially attractive to young firms in that the majority of the money 
needed for expansion comes from the franchisees. Franchising is appropriate 
when a firm has a strong or potentially strong trademark, a well-designed 
business model, and a desire to grow. A franchise system will ultimately fail 
if the franchisee’s brand doesn’t create value for customers and its business 
model is flawed or poorly developed.
In some instances, franchising is simply not appropriate. For example, 
franchising works for Burger King but would not work for Walmart. While 
Burger King has a large number of franchise outlets, each individual outlet 
is relatively small and has a limited menu, and policies and procedures can 
be written to cover almost any contingency. In contrast, although Walmart is 
similar to Burger King in that it, too, has a strong trademark and thousands 
of outlets, Walmart stores are much larger, more expensive to build, and more 
complex to run compared to the complexity of running a Burger King restau-
rant. It would be nearly impossible for Walmart to find an adequate number 
of qualified people who would have the financial capital and expertise to open 
and successfully operate a Walmart store.
steps to Franchising a Business
Let’s assume that as an entrepreneur you have decided to use franchising as a 
means of growing your venture. What steps should you take to develop a fran-
chise system? As illustrated in Figure 15.2, you, as an entrepreneur, should 
take nine steps in order to successfully set up a franchise system.
Step 1 Develop a franchise business plan: The franchise business plan 
should follow the format of a conventional business plan, which we 

CHAPTER 15 | FRAnCHISIng    537
discussed in Chapter 6, and should fully describe the rationale for 
franchising the business and act as a blueprint for rolling out the 
franchise operation. Particular attention should be paid to the loca-
tion of the proposed franchise outlet. For example, a Baskin-Robbins 
franchise that is successful in the food court of a mall in an upscale 
area doesn’t mean that it will be successful in a less heavily trafficked 
strip mall in an average-income neighborhood.
Step 2 Get professional advice: Before going too far, a potential franchisor 
should seek advice from a qualified franchise attorney, consultant, 
or certified public accountant. If the business cannot be realistically 
turned into a franchise, then a qualified professional can save a poten-
tial franchisor a lot of time, money, and frustration by urging that the 
W
ahoo’s Fish Taco is a franchise organization that 
offers Mexican food mixed with Brazilian and 
Asian flavors. It is a “fast-casual” restaurant 
that was founded in Costa Mesa, California, in 1988 by 
Chinese-Brazilian brothers Eduardo Lee, Mingo Lee, and 
Wing Lam, who mixed traditional Chinese and Brazilian 
flavors with dishes they encountered traveling in Mexico. 
The first Wahoo’s Fish Taco restaurant was launched to 
combine the brothers’ love for surfing and food.
Wahoo’s is now just over 25 years old and has about 
60 locations, located in California, Texas, Colorado, 
nevada, nebraska, and Hawaii. It’s known for its specialty 
charbroiled fish, steak, and chicken tacos and burritos. 
Although it’s been very successful, it couldn’t be charac-
terized as a “rapid growth” franchise system. Instead, the 
founders have elected to make Wahoo’s Fish Taco a rela-
tively slow growth system, focusing on branding and ser-
vice quality rather than rapid growth. This philosophy has 
been an entrenched part of the way Wahoo’s Fish Taco has 
done business since the beginning. It started with a single 
restaurant in 1988; the second unit was added only when 
the founders had saved enough money to build it debt 
free. This pattern has characterized the company’s growth. 
Early on, it only added one new restaurant a year, then two, 
then three, and so on. Despite its success, it has averaged 
only about 2.5 restaurants per year since its founding. For 
many years, the company only sold franchises to people 
the founders personally knew and trusted.
Wahoo’s pace of expansion has picked up some in 
recent years, but not dramatically. Its brand has been 
built around its enthusiasm for surfing and other extreme 
sports. More than half of its restaurants are in California, 
and its locations in other states are largely in college towns 
or “hip” communities. The company does not have inter-
national locations, although there are some indications 
that it plans to expand to Japan.
Along with its staple dishes, Wahoo’s Fish Taco offers 
many vegetarian and vegan options, such as tofu, banzai 
veggies, and brown rice. Its restaurants are very attrac-
tive inside and out, and offer a relaxed environment with 
a definite “surfer” feel. Buying a Wahoo Fish Taco fran-
chise requires a major financial commitment. The initial 
franchise fee is $35,000. The ongoing royalty is 5 percent 
of gross sales plus an additional 2 percent for market-
ing. The cost to build a Wahoo Fish Taco restaurant runs 
from $425,000 to $715,000 depending on location, size 
of restaurant, landscaping, and local ordinances.
Questions for Critical Thinking
 1. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Wahoo’s 
Fish Taco’s slow growth philosophy of franchise 
expansion?
 2. Spend some time looking at Wahoo’s Fish Taco’s 
website, focusing particularly on its menu and its store 
layout. Do you think the business is well positioned or 
poorly positioned to take advantage of current trends 
in the types of restaurants that are doing well and in 
light of today’s food preferences? Explain your answer.
 3. To what degree do you think Wahoo’s Fish Taco has 
been too conservative in its expansion?
 4. Spend some time studying the cost of becoming a 
Wahoo’s Fish Taco franchisee compared to similar 
franchise organizations. Is the cost of acquiring and 
owning a Wahoo Fish Taco franchise on the high end, 
in the middle, or on the low end compared to its clos-
est competitors? To what degree do you believe your 
answer has affected Wahoo’s pace of growth?

process be stopped. If the business can be turned into a franchise, then 
it is advisable to get professional advice to help direct the entire process.
Step 3 Conduct an intellectual property audit: As we discussed in 
Chapter  12, this step is necessary to determine the intellectual 
property a company owns and to ensure that the property is prop-
erly registered and protected. All original written, audio, and visual 
material, including operating manuals, training videos, advertising 
brochures, and similar matter, should be afforded copyright protec-
tion. If a firm has a unique business model that includes a unique 
business method, it should consider obtaining a patent for its busi-
ness method. These protective measures are vital because once a 
company begins franchising, its trademarks and business model and 
any unique business methods are disseminated, making them more 
visible to customers and competitors. In addition, a franchisor should 
make sure that its trademark is not infringing on the trademark of 
any other firm.
Step 4 Develop franchise documents: Later in the chapter, we discuss 
the documents that are required to franchise a business. Here, we 
can note that at the beginning of the franchise evaluation process, 
a prospective franchisor should prepare the Franchise Disclosure 
Document (formally called the Uniform Franchise Offering Circular) 
and the franchise agreement. A franchise attorney can provide specific 
information regarding the content and format of these documents.
Step 5 Prepare operating manuals: Businesses that are suitable for fran-
chising typically have a polished business system that can be fairly 
easily taught to qualified franchisees. The franchisor should prepare 
manuals that document all aspects of its business model.
Step 6 Plan an advertising strategy and a franchisee training program: 
Prospective franchisees will want to see an advertising strategy and a 
franchisee training program in place. The scope of each program should 
match the speed at which the franchisor wants to grow its business.
Step 7 Put together a team for opening new franchise units: A team 
should be developed and prepared to help new franchisees open their

franchise units. The team should be well trained and equipped to 
provide the franchisee a broad range of training and guidance.
Step 8 Plan a strategy for soliciting prospective franchisees: There are 
many channels available to franchisors to solicit and attract potential 
franchisees. Franchise trade fairs, newspaper ads, franchise publica-
tions, social media platforms, and Internet advertising are examples 
of these channels.
Step 9 Help franchisees with site selection and the grand opening of 
their franchise outlets: Location is very important to most retail 
businesses, so a franchisor should be heavily involved in the site se-
lection of its franchisees’ outlets. The franchisor should also help the 
franchisee with the grand opening of the franchise outlet.
Along with the specific steps shown in Figure 15.2, it is important for a 
franchisor to remember that the quality of the relationships it maintains with 
its franchisees often defines the ultimate success of the franchise system. It is 
to the franchisor’s advantage to follow through on all promises and to establish 
an exemplary reputation. This is an ongoing commitment that a franchisor 
should make to its franchisees.
selecting and Developing effective Franchisees
The franchisor’s ability to select and develop effective franchisees strongly 
influences the degree to which a franchise system is successful. For most sys-
tems, the ideal franchisee is someone who has solid ideas and suggestions but 
is willing to work within the franchise system’s rules. Bold, aggressive entre-
preneurs typically do not make good franchisees. Franchisees must be team 
players to properly fit within the context of a successful franchise system.
Once franchisees are selected, it is important that franchisors work to de-
velop their franchisees’ potential. Table 15.2 contains a list of the qualities that 
franchisors look for in prospective franchisees and the steps that franchisors 
can take to develop their franchisees’ potential.

advantages and Disadvantages of 
establishing a Franchise system
There are two primary advantages to franchising. First, early in the life of an 
organization, capital is typically scarce, and rapid growth is needed to achieve 
brand recognition and economies of scale. Franchising helps a venture grow 
quickly because franchisees provide the majority of the capital.13 For example, 
if Comfort Keepers were growing via company-owned outlets rather than fran-
chising, it would probably have only a handful of outlets rather than the more 
than 700 it has today. Many franchisors even admit that they would have 
rather grown through company-owned stores but that the capital requirements 
needed to grow their firms dictated franchising. This sentiment is affirmed by 
an executive at Hardee’s, who wrote the following about the growth of this fast-
food chain:
Hardee’s would have preferred not to have franchised a single location. We prefer 
company-owned locations. But due to the heavy capital investment required, we 
could only expand company-owned locations to a certain degree—from there we 
had to stop. Each operation represents an investment in excess of $100,000; there-
fore, we entered the franchise business.14
Second, a concept called agency theory argues that for organizations with 
multiple units (such as restaurant chains), it is more effective for the units to 
be run by franchisees than by managers who run company-owned stores. The 
theory is that managers, because they are usually paid a salary, may not be as 
committed to the success of their individual units as franchisees, who are in 
effect the owners of the units they manage.15
The primary disadvantage of franchising is that an organization allows 
others to profit from its trademark and business model. For example, each 
time Comfort Keepers sells a franchise it receives a $32,500 initial franchise 
fee and an ongoing royalty, which is 3 to 4 percent of gross sales. However, if 
Comfort Keepers had provided its service itself in the same location, it would 
be getting 100 percent of the gross sales and net profits from the location. This 
is the main reason some organizations that are perfectly suitable for franchis-
ing grow through company-owned stores rather than franchising. An example 
is Darden Restaurants Inc., the parent company of Olive Garden, Bahama 
Breeze, LongHorn Steakhouse, The Capital Grille, Seasons 52, Eddie V’s, and 
Yard House. With over 1,500 locations, the firm employs more than 150,000 
people and serves more than 320 million meals a year.16 All of Darden’s units 
are company owned. Starbucks is another company that is suitable for fran-
chising but has only a small number of franchise outlets. We provide a more 
complete list of the advantages and disadvantages of franchising as a means of 
business expansion in Table 15.3.
When a company decides to investigate franchising as a means of growth, 
it should ensure that it and its product or service meet several criteria. 
Businesses that fail to satisfy these criteria are less likely to make effective 
franchise systems. Before deciding to franchise, a firm should consider the 
following:
■ The uniqueness of its product or service: The business’s product or 
service should be unique along some dimension that creates value for 
 customers. Businesses with a unique product or service typically have the 
best potential to expand.
■ The consistent profitability of the firm: The business should be con-
sistently profitable, and the future profitability of the business should be 
fairly easy to predict. When developing a franchise system, a company 
learning ObjeCtive

vantages of establishing a

CHAPTER 15 | FRAnCHISIng    541
should have several prototype outlets up and running to test and ensure 
the viability of the business idea. Remember, a franchisee is supposed to 
be buying a way of doing business (in the form of a business model) that 
is “proven”—at least to a certain extent. Franchisors that learn how to 
run their businesses through the trial and error of their franchisees have 
typically franchised their businesses prematurely (especially from the 
franchisees’ point of view).
■ The firm’s year-round profitability: The business should be profitable 
year-round, not only during specific seasons. For example, a lawn and 
garden care franchise in North Dakota should be set up to provide the 
franchisee supplemental products and services to sell during off-peak

Disadvantages
rapid, low-cost market expansion. Because franchisees 
provide most of the cost of expansion, the franchisor can 
expand the size of its business fairly rapidly
income from franchise fees and royalties. By collecting 
franchise fees, the franchisor gets a fairly quick return on 
the proprietary nature of its products/services and business 
model. The franchisor also receives ongoing royalties from its 
franchisees without incurring substantial risk.
Franchisee motivation. Because franchisees put their 
personal capital at risk, they are highly motivated to make 
their franchise outlets successful. In contrast, the managers 
of company-owned outlets typically do not have their own 
capital at risk. As a result, these managers may not be prone 
to work as hard as franchisees or be as attentive to cost 
savings.
access to ideas and suggestions. Franchisees represent 
a source of intellectual capital and often make suggestions 
to their franchisors. By incorporating these ideas into their 
business model, franchisors can in effect leverage the ideas 
and suggestions of their individual franchisees.
Cost savings. Franchisees share many of the franchisors’ 
expenses, such as the cost of regional and national 
advertising.
increased buying power. Franchisees provide franchisors 
increased buying power by enlarging the size of their business, 
allowing them to purchase larger quantities of products and 
services when buying those items.
profit sharing. By selling franchises instead of operating 
company-owned stores, franchisors share the profits 
derived from their proprietary products or services with 
their franchisees. For example, before being acquired by 
FedEx, Kinko’s did not sell franchises, allowing it to retain 
all its profits.
loss of control. It is typically more difficult for a franchisor 
to control its franchisees than it is for a company to control 
its employees. Franchisees, despite the rules governing 
the franchise system, still often view themselves as 
independent businesspeople.
Friction with franchisees. A common complaint of 
franchisors is dealing with the friction that often develops 
between franchisors and franchisees. Friction can develop 
over issues such as the payment of fees, hours of operation, 
caveats in the franchise agreement, and surprise inspections.
Managing growth. Franchisors that are in growing 
industries and have a strong trademark often grow quickly. 
Although this might seem like an advantage, rapid growth 
can be difficult to manage. A franchisor provides each of 
its franchisees a number of services, such as site selection 
and employee training. If a franchise system is growing 
rapidly, the franchisor will have to continually add personnel 
to its own staff to properly support its growing number of 
franchisees.
Differences in required business skills. The business 
skills that made a franchisor successful in the original 
business are typically not the same skills needed to 
manage a franchise system. For example, Sam Jones may 
be a very effective owner/manager of a seafood restaurant. 
That does not necessarily mean, however, that he will be 
an effective manager of a franchise system if he decided to 
franchise his seafood restaurant concept.
legal expenses. Many states have specific laws pertaining 
to franchising. As a result, if a franchisor sells franchises 
in multiple states, legal expenses can be high to properly 
interpret and comply with each state’s laws. Unfortunately, 
from the franchisor’s point of view, some of the toughest 
laws are in the most populated states.

542    PART 4 | MAnAgIng AnD gROWIng An EnTREPREnEURIAL FIRM
seasons. Otherwise, owning the franchise may not be an attractive form 
of business ownership. This issue is particularly problematic for some ice 
cream and smoothie franchises in northern states, which experience a sig-
nificant decline in sales during winter months.
■ The degree of refinement of the firm’s business systems: The sys-
tems and procedures for operating the business should be polished and 
the procedures documented in written form. The systems and procedures 
should also be fairly easy to teach to qualified candidates.
■ The clarity of the business proposition: The business proposition 
should be crystal clear so that prospective franchisees fully understand 
the business proposition to which they are committing. The relationship 
between the franchisor and the franchisee should be completely open, and 
communication between them should be candid.
After determining that the firm satisfies these criteria, the entrepreneur 
should step back and review all the alternatives for business expansion. No 
single form of business expansion is the best under all circumstances. For any 
entrepreneurial venture, the best form of expansion is the one that increases 
the likelihood that the venture will reach its objectives.
One franchise organization that started fast but is now faltering is Curves 
International, as depicted in this chapter’s “What Went Wrong?” feature.
buying a Franchise
Now let’s look at franchising from the franchisee’s perspective. Purchasing a 
franchise is an important business decision involving a substantial financial 
commitment. Potential franchise owners should strive to be as well informed 
as possible before purchasing a franchise and should be well aware that it is 
often legally and financially difficult to exit a franchise relationship. Indeed, 
an individual franchise opportunity should be meticulously scrutinized. 
Close scrutiny of a potential franchise opportunity includes activities such as 
meeting with the franchisor and carefully reading the Franchise Disclosure 
Document, soliciting legal and financial advice, and talking to former franchi-
sees that have dropped out of the system one is considering. In particularly 
heavily franchised industries, such as fast food and automobile repair, a pro-
spective franchisee may have 20 or more franchisors from which to make a se-
lection. It is well worth franchisees’ time to carefully select the franchisor that 
best meets their individual needs.17
Some franchise organizations are designed to provide their franchisees a 
part-time rather than a full-time income, which is attractive to some people. 
An example is Fit4Mom, a company that gathers new mothers together to do 
45-minute power walks with their babies in strollers. The initial franchise fee 
ranges between $5,000 and $50,000, depending on several factors, includ-
ing how densely populated the area is in which the franchise will be located. 
Owning a Fit4Mom franchise is ideal for a woman who wants to work two to 
three hours a day rather than eight, and who is passionate about fitness.
Franchising may be a particularly good choice for someone who wants to 
start a business but has no prior business experience. Along with offering a 
refined business system, well-run franchise organizations provide their fran-
chisees training, technical expertise, and other forms of ongoing support.

urves International, whose 30-minute workout and 
singular focus on women made it among the world’s 
fastest-growing franchise organizations, seems to 
be losing a lot of steam.
According to a May 27, 2014, article in Forbes, 
since 2006 Curves has shed more than 4,000 locations, 
from a peak of 10,000 in 2006 to 6,000 today. Its north 
American locations dropped 65 percent during a similar 
period. That drop ranked Curves seventh worst among 
franchises with an initial investment of up to $150,000.
While opinions vary about what went wrong with 
Curves, a consensus has emerged on four points: (1) the 
company failed to keep up with changing trends, including 
more flexible hours for busy working women, (2) cheaper 
competition, (3) the poor economy, and (4) the company 
sold too many franchises that are located too close to-
gether. Of the four reasons, a failure to keep up with 
changing trends may be the biggest culprit. Some Curves 
locations are open for limited hours, causing patrons to 
look elsewhere for their workouts. Also, 24-hour fitness 
centers, including Anytime Fitness and Snap Fitness, have 
opened in many areas, providing busy women even more 
flexibility than Curves. Some members may have also tired 
of Curves’s bare-boned approach and gravitated to fit-
ness centers that offer aerobics classes, Yoga, Pilates, and 
dressing rooms with showers.
Founded in 1992, Curves was an instant hit, largely 
because it targeted an underserved part of the market: 
busy and unfit women. Curves’s founders believed that 
many women 30 years old and older cared deeply about 
their health and appearance but didn’t want to join a 
fitness center full of people who were already fit. So 
they created a fitness center “just for them” that was 
convenient, affordable, and restricted to females. The 
Curves “concept” was structured on a stripped-down 
version of the traditional fitness center, based on a 
tightly structured 30-minute workout using 8 to 12 ex-
ercise machines. Curves fitness centers do not have 
locker rooms, showers, aerobic classes, or juice bars. 
Instead they’re designed to be convenient and quick. 
Members pay $99 up front to join, through the fee is 
often discounted. Monthly dues vary, averaging about 
$44 per month.
In 2012, Curves was acquired by north Castle 
Partners, a private equity firm. Its new owners disagree 
with the critics and blame Curves’s troubles on franchi-
sees. The gist of their argument, which is laid out in the 
Forbes magazine article mentioned above, is that people 
who bought multiple Curves franchises were the wrong 
owners for Curves. “If you aren’t there working it and 
working in the community to try to bring new people 
in and providing great service to your members … of-
ten those locations are not going to do very well,” Jon 
Canarick, managing director of north Central Partners, 
was quoted as saying. The inference is that failed fran-
chisees were motivated primarily as investors rather than 
owners.
In regard to turning Curves around, north Castle 
Partners has several things in mind. The plans involve 
strengthening the company’s existing fitness and weight-
loss programs, as well as pushing nutrition bars and 
apparel. There may also be some cross-initiatives with 
Jenny Craig, a company that sells weight-loss and diet 
programs and is also owned by north Castle Partners. 
Curves also hopes for a lift from its new spokesperson, 
Jillian Michaels, who became known as a result of her 
appearances on nBC’s The Biggest Loser.
Questions for Critical Thinking
 1. Why do you think Curves failed to respond to changing 
trends? To what degree do you think this single factor 
contributes to Curves’s recent troubles?
 2. To what degree do you believe that Curves’s former 
owners (the franchisor) is culpable in the failure of 
so many Curves franchise locations? What is your 
opinion of north Castle Partners’s turnaround plans 
for Curves? Do you believe that Curves will continue 
losing franchises, or do you think the company will 
 recover and start growing again?

of IceBorn, what lessons would you learn by studying

franchising is a good fit for people thinking about starting their own entrepre-
neurial venture:
■ Are you willing to take orders? Franchisors are typically very particular 
about how their outlets operate. For example, McDonald’s and other suc-
cessful fast-food chains are very strict in terms of their restaurants’ ap-
pearance and how each unit’s food is prepared. Franchising is typically 
not a good fit for people who like to experiment with their own ideas or 
are independent minded.
■ Are you willing to be part of a franchise “system” rather than an inde-
pendent businessperson? For example, as a franchisee you may be re-
quired to pay into an advertising fund that covers the costs of advertising 
aimed at regional or national markets rather than the market for your 
individual outlet. Will it bother you to have someone use your money 
to develop ads that benefit the “system” rather than only your outlet or 
store? Are you willing to lose creative control over how your business is 
promoted?
■ How will you react if you make a suggestion to your franchisor and your 
suggestion is rejected? How will you feel if you are told that your sugges-
tion might work for you but can be put in place only if it works in all parts 
of the system?
■ What are you looking for in a business? How hard do you want to work?
■ How willing are you to put your money at risk? How will you feel if your 
business is operating at a net loss but you still have to pay royalties on 
your gross income?
None of these questions is meant to suggest that franchising is not an attractive 
method of business ownership for entrepreneurs. It is important, however, that 
a potential franchisee be fully aware of the subtleties involved with franchising 
before purchasing a franchise outlet.

CHAPTER 15 | FRAnCHISIng    545
the Cost of a Franchise
The initial cost of a business format franchise varies, depending on the fran-
chise fee, the capital needed to start the business, and the strength of the fran-
chisor. For example, some franchisors, such as McDonald’s, own the land and 
buildings that their franchisees use, and lease the property to the franchisees. 
In contrast, other organizations require their franchisees to purchase the land, 
buildings, and equipment needed to run their franchise outlets. Table  15.4 
shows the total costs of buying into several franchise organizations. As you 
can see, the total initial cost varies from a low of $10,250 for a Coffee News 
franchise up to $6.6 million for a Hampton Inn Hotel franchise.
Also shown in Table 15.4 is a breakdown of the number of company-owned 
units and the number of franchise units maintained by different organizations. 
Company-owned units are managed and operated by company personnel, and 
there is no franchisee involved. Franchise organizations vary in their philoso-
phies regarding company-owned versus franchised units. As we noted earlier 
in this chapter, some companies (e.g., Budget Blinds) are strictly franchisors 
and have no company-owned units. Other companies, such as Qdoba Mexican 
Grill, have roughly the same number of franchises and company owned stores. 
In addition, some U.S.-based franchise systems have more foreign franchises 
than domestic franchises. For example, of the 18,875 franchises in KFC’s 
system, 4,491 are in the United States and 14,384 are in foreign countries. 
In fact, there are more KFC franchises in China (4,563) than there are in the 
United States.
When evaluating the cost of a franchise, prospective franchisees should 
consider all the costs involved. Franchisors are required by law to disclose 
all their costs in a document called the Franchise Disclosure Document 
and send it to the franchisee. (We’ll talk about this document in more detail 
later in this chapter.) To avoid making a hasty judgment, a franchisee may

not purchase a franchise for 14 days from the time the circular is received. 
The following costs are typically associated with buying a business format 
franchise:18
■ Initial franchise fee: The initial franchise fee varies, depending on the 
franchisor, as shown in Table 15.4. High-overhead brick-and-mortar fran-
chises charge less (4 to 5 percent of gross sales), while low-overhead home-
based and service business charge more (8 to 10 percent of gross sales).
■ Capital requirements: These costs vary, depending on the franchisor, 
but may include the cost of buying real estate, the cost of constructing 
a building, the purchase of initial inventory, and the cost of obtaining a 
business license. Some franchisors also require a new franchisee to pay 
a “grand opening” fee for its assistance in opening the business.
■ Continuing royalty payment: In the majority of cases, a franchisee pays 
a royalty based on a percentage of weekly or monthly gross income. Note 
that because the fee is typically assessed on gross income rather than net 
income, a franchisee may have to pay a monthly royalty even if the busi-
ness is losing money. Royalty fees are usually around 5 percent of gross 
income.19
■ Advertising fees: Franchisees are often required to pay into a national or 
regional advertising fund, even if the advertisements are directed at goals 
other than promoting the franchisor’s product or service. (For example, 
advertising could focus on the franchisor’s attempt at attracting new fran-
chisees.) Advertising fees are typically less than 3 percent of gross income.
■ Other fees: Other fees may be charged for various activities, including 
training additional staff, providing management expertise when needed, 
providing computer assistance, or providing a host of other items or sup-
port services.
Although not technically a fee, many franchise organizations sell their fran-
chisee products that they use in their businesses, such as restaurant supplies 
for a restaurant franchise. The products are often sold at a markup and may 
be more expensive than those the franchisee could obtain on the open market.
The most important question a prospective franchisee should consider is 
whether the fees and royalties charged by a franchisor are consistent with the 
franchise’s value or worth. If they are, then the pricing structure may be fair 
and equitable. If they are not, then the terms should be renegotiated or the 
prospective franchisee should look elsewhere.
An increasingly common way that franchise organizations decrease costs and 
increase sales is by partnering with one another through co-branding relation-
ships. This practice is discussed in this chapter’s “Partnering for Success” feature.
Finding a Franchise
There are thousands of franchise opportunities available to prospective fran-
chisees. The most critical step in the early stages of investigating franchise 
opportunities is for the entrepreneur to determine the type of franchise that 
is the best fit. For example, it is typically unrealistic for someone who is not a 
mechanic to consider buying a muffler repair franchise. A franchisor teaches 
a franchisee how to use the contents of a business model, not a trade. Before 
buying a franchise, a potential franchisee should imagine operating the pro-
spective franchise or, better yet, should spend a period of time working in one 
of the franchisor’s outlets. After working in a print shop for a week, for exam-
ple, someone who thought she might enjoy running a print shop might find out 
that she hates it. This type of experience could help avoid making a mistake 
that is costly both to the franchisee and to the franchisor.

CHAPTER 15 | FRAnCHISIng    547
There are many periodicals, websites, and associations that provide in-
formation about franchise opportunities. Every Thursday and Saturday, for 
example, ads for franchise opportunities appear in special sections of the Wall 
Street Journal. Similar ads appear every Wednesday in USA Today. Periodicals 
featuring franchise opportunities include Inc. and Entrepreneur, and franchise-
specific magazines to review include The Franchise Handbook and Franchise 
Times. Prospective franchisees should also consider attending franchise oppor-
tunity shows that are held periodically in major U.S. cities and the International 
Franchise Expo, which is held annually in different cities across the United

attract road traffic and by collecting lease income. Having 
a sub shop inside its store also helps a gasoline station 
become a “destination stop” for regular customers rather 
than simply another gas station serving passing cars.
important Considerations
Although co-branding can be an excellent way for fran-
chise organizations to partner for success, a firm should 
consider three questions before entering into a co-
branding relationship:
■ Will the co-branding arrangement maintain or 
strengthen my brand image?
■ Do I have adequate control over how my partner 
will display or use my brand?
■ Are there tangible benefits associated with attach-
ing my brand to my partner’s brand? For example, 
will my partner’s brand have a positive effect on 
my brand and actually increase my sales?
If the answer to each of these questions is yes, than a 
co-branding arrangement may be a very effective way 
for a franchise organization to boosts sales and reduce 
expenses.
Questions for Critical Thinking
 1. Do you think co-branding will continue to gain momen-
tum, or do you think it is a fad that will wane in terms 
of its popularity? Explain your answer.
 2. What are the potential downsides of co-branding? 
What might make a franchise hesitant to enter into 
a co-branding relationship with another franchise 
organization?
 3. Consider the Uptown Cheapskate opening profile. 
Suggest some co-branding relationships that Uptown 
Cheapskate might consider forming.
 4. Make a list of the types of businesses that might work 
well together in a co-branding relationship. Several 
initial examples include (a) a quick oil change and a tire 
store, (b) a bakery and a coffeehouse, and (c) a florist 
and a candy store.
h
ave you ever stopped at a gas station and caught 
a quick lunch at an Arby’s or a Blimpie sub sand-
wich inside? Or have you ever noticed that Baskin-
Robbins and Dunkin’ Donuts often share the same build-
ing? If either of these two scenarios applies to you, then 
you have witnessed co-branding firsthand.
Co-branding takes place when two or more busi-
nesses are grouped together. Co-branding is becoming 
increasingly common among franchise organizations that 
are looking for new ways to increase sales and reduce 
expenses. As we describe next, there are two primary 
types of co-branding arrangements that apply to fran-
chise organizations.
two Franchises Operating side by side
The first type of co-branding arrangement involves two or 
more franchises operating side by side in the same build-
ing or leased space. This type of arrangement typically 
involves a franchise like a donut shop that is busiest in 
the morning and a taco restaurant that is busiest at lunch 
and dinner. By locating side by side, these businesses 
can increase their sales by picking up some business 
from the traffic generated by their co-branding partner 
and can cut costs by sharing rent and other expenses.
Side-by-side co-branding arrangements are not re-
stricted to restaurants. Sometimes the benefit arises 
from the complementary nature of the products involved, 
rather than time of day. For example, a franchise that 
sells exercise equipment could operate side by side with 
a business that sells vitamins. By locating side by side, 
these two businesses could realize the same types of 
benefits as the donut shop and the taco restaurant.
two Franchises Occupying the exact same space
The second type of co-branding arrangement involves 
two franchises occupying essentially the same space. 
For example, it is increasingly common to see sub shops 
inside gasoline stations and other retail outlets. The rela-
tionship is meant to benefit both parties. The sub shop 
benefits by opening another location without incurring 
the cost of constructing a freestanding building or leas-
ing expensive shopping mall space. The gasoline station

States. The U.S. Small Business Administration is another good source of fran-
chise information. There are also several excellent franchise-focused individuals 
and organizations that post frequently on Twitter. Examples include Franchise 
Expert (@FranchiseBiz), Franchising.com (@Franchising_com), and Franchise 
Direct USA (@topfranchises). Because of the risks involved in franchising, the se-
lection of a franchisor should be a careful, deliberate process. One of the smart-
est moves a potential franchise owner can make is to talk to current franchisees 
and inquire if they are making money and if they are satisfied with their franchi-
sor. Reflecting on how this approach helped ease her inhibitions about buying a 
franchise, Carleen Peaper, the owner of a Cruise Planner franchise, said:
I was really apprehensive about making an investment of my time and money into 
a franchise, so I e-mailed 50 Cruise Planner agents with a set of questions, asking 
for honest feedback. Everyone responded. That was a big thing and helped me de-
termine that I wanted to join them.20
Table 15.5 contains a list of sample questions to ask a franchisor and some 
of its current franchisees before investing. Potential entrepreneurs can expect 
to learn a great deal by studying the answers they receive in response to these 
questions.
advantages and Disadvantages of Buying 
a Franchise
There are two primary advantages to buying a franchise over other forms of 
business ownership. First, franchising provides an entrepreneur the oppor-
tunity to own a business using a tested and refined business model. This at-
tribute lessens the probability of business failure. In addition, the trademark 
that comes with the franchise often provides instant legitimacy for a busi-
ness.21 For example, an entrepreneur opening a new Gold’s Gym would likely 
Table 15.5  Questions to ask before buying a Franchise
Questions to ask a Franchisor
■ What is the background of the company and its performance record?
■ What is the company’s current financial status?
■ What are the names, addresses, and phone numbers of existing franchisees in my trade 
area?
■ How do you train and mentor your franchisees?
■ If at some point I decide to exit the franchise relationship, how does the exit process work?
■ In what ways do you work with a franchisee who is struggling?
Questions to ask Current Franchisees
■ How much does your franchise gross per year? How much does it net? Are the procedures 
followed to make royalty payments to the franchisee burdensome?
■ Are the financial projections of revenues, expenses, and profits that the franchisor provided 
me accurate in your judgment?
■ Does the franchisor give you enough assistance in operating your business?
■ How many hours, on average, do you work per week?
■ How often are you able to take a vacation?
■ Have you been caught off-guard by any unexpected costs or expectations?
■ Does your franchisor provide ongoing training and support to you?
■ If you had to do it all over again, would you purchase a franchise in this system? Why or 
why not?

CHAPTER 15 | FRAnCHISIng    549
attract more customers than an entrepreneur opening a new, independently 
owned fitness center because many people who are a part of the target market 
of Gold’s Gym have already heard of the firm and have a positive impression of 
it. Second, when an individual purchases a franchise, the franchisor typically 
provides training, technical expertise, and other forms of support. For exam-
ple, many franchise organizations provide their franchisees periodic training 
both at their headquarters location and in their individual franchise outlets.
The cost involved is the main disadvantage of buying and operating a fran-
chise. As mentioned earlier, the franchisee must pay an initial franchise fee. 
The franchisee must also pay the franchisor an ongoing royalty as well as pay 
into a variety of funds, depending on the franchise organization. Thus, fran-
chisees have both immediate (i.e., the initial franchise fee) and long-term (i.e., 
continuing royalty payments) costs. By opening an independent business, an 
entrepreneur can keep 100 percent of the profits if it is successful.
Table 15.6 contains a list of the advantages and disadvantages of buying a 
franchise.
Table 15.6  advantages and Disadvantages of buying a Franchise

Disadvantages
a proven product or service within an established market. 
The most compelling advantage to buying a franchise is that 
the franchise offers a proven product or service within an 
established market.
an established trademark or business system. The 
purchase of a franchise with an established trademark 
provides franchisees with considerable market power. For 
example, the purchaser of a McDonald’s franchise has a 
trademark with proven market power.
Franchisor’s training, technical expertise, and managerial 
experience. Another important attribute of franchising is the 
training, technical expertise, and managerial experience that 
the franchisor provides the franchisee.
an established marketing network. Franchisees who buy 
into a powerful franchise system are part of a system that has 
tremendous buying power and substantial advertising power 
and marketing prowess.
Franchisor’s ongoing support. One of the most attractive 
advantages of purchasing a franchise rather than owning a 
store outright is the notion that the franchisor provides the 
franchisee ongoing support in terms of training, product 
updates, management assistance, and advertising. A popular 
slogan in franchising is that people buy franchises to “be in 
business for themselves but not by themselves.”
availability of financing. Some franchisors offer financing 
to their franchisees, although these cases are the exception 
rather than the rule. This information is available in section 10 
of the Franchise Disclosure Document.
potential for business growth. If a franchisee is successful 
in the original location, the franchisee is often provided the 
opportunity to buy additional franchises from the same 
franchisor. For many franchisees, this prospect offers a 
powerful incentive to work hard to be as successful as 
possible.
Cost of the franchise. The initial cost of purchasing and 
setting up a franchise operation can be quite high, as 
illustrated in Table 15.4.
restrictions on creativity. Many franchise systems 
are very rigid and leave little opportunity for individual 
franchisees to exercise their creativity. This is an often-
cited frustration of franchisees.
Duration and nature of the commitment. For a variety 
of reasons, many franchise agreements are difficult to 
exit. In addition, virtually every franchise agreement 
contains a noncompete clause. These clauses vary in 
terms of severity, but a typical clause prevents a former 
franchisee from competing with the franchisor for a 
period of two years or more.
risk of fraud, misunderstandings, or lack of franchisor 
commitment. Along with the many encouraging stories 
of franchise success, there are also many stories 
of individuals who purchase a franchise only to be 
disappointed by the franchisor’s broken promises.
problems of termination or transfer. Some franchise 
agreements are very difficult and expensive to terminate 
or transfer. Often, a franchisee cannot terminate a 
franchise agreement without paying the franchisor 
substantial monetary damages.
poor performance on the part of other franchisees. 
If some of the franchisees in a franchise system start 
performing poorly and make an ineffective impression 
on the public, that poor performance can affect the 
reputation and eventually the sales of a well-run franchise 
in the same system.
potential for failure. Some franchise systems simply fail 
to reach their objectives. When this happens, franchisees’ 
wealth can be negatively affected. Indeed, when a franchise 
system fails, it commonly brings its franchisees down with it.

steps in purchasing a Franchise
Purchasing a franchise system is a seven-step process, as illustrated in 
Figure 15.3. The first rule of buying a franchise is to avoid making a hasty de-
cision. Again, owning a franchise is typically costly and labor-intensive, and 
the purchase of a franchise should be a careful, deliberate decision. Once the 
decision to purchase a franchise has been nearly made, however, the following 
steps should be taken. If at any time prior to signing the franchise agreement 
the prospective franchisee has second thoughts, the process should be stopped 
until the prospective franchisee’s concerns are adequately addressed.
Step 1 Visit several of the franchisor’s outlets: Prior to meeting with the 
franchisor, the prospective franchisee should visit several of the fran-
chisor’s outlets and talk with their owners and employees. During the 
visits, the prospective franchisee should continually ask, “Is this the 
type of business I would enjoy owning and operating or managing?”
Step 2 Meet with a franchise attorney: Prospective franchisees should 
have an attorney who represents their interests, not the franchisor’s. 
The attorney should prepare the prospective franchisee for meeting 
with the franchisor and should review all franchise documents before 
they are signed. If the franchisor tries to discourage the prospective 
franchisee from retaining an attorney, this is a red flag.
Step 3 Meet with the franchisor and check the franchisor’s references: 
The prospective franchisee should meet with the franchisor, preferably 
at the franchisor’s headquarters. During the meeting, the prospec-
tive franchisee should compare what was observed firsthand in the 
franchised outlets with what the franchisor is saying. Additional refer-
ences should also be checked. The Franchise Disclosure Document is 
a good source for references. In section 20 of this document, there is 
a list of all the franchisees that have dropped out of the system in the 
past three years along with their contact information. Several of these 
should be called. Although it may seem to be overkill, the mantra for 
prospective franchisees is to check, double-check, and triple-check a 
franchisor’s references.

Step 4 Review all franchise documents with the attorney: The franchise 
attorney should review all the franchise documents, including the 
Franchise Disclosure Document and the franchise agreement.
Step 5 Sign the franchise agreement: If everything is a go at this point, the 
franchise agreement can be signed. The franchise agreement is the 
document in which the provisions of the franchisor–franchisee rela-
tionship are outlined. We discuss this agreement in greater detail later 
in this chapter.
Step 6 Attend training: Almost all franchise organizations provide training 
for their franchisees. For example, Comfort Keepers requires each of its 
new franchisees to attend Comfort Keeper’s Academy, the company’s 
training center, for 40 hours of training before they open their Comfort 
Keepers franchise.
Step 7 Open the franchise business: For many franchises, particularly 
restaurants, the first two to three weeks after the business is opened 
may be its busiest period, as prospective customers “try it out.” This 
is why many franchise organizations send experienced personnel to 
help the franchisee open the business as smoothly as possible. One 
goal of a franchisee is generating positive word of mouth about the 
business right from the start.
Watch out! Common Misconceptions 
about Franchising
Despite the abundance of advice available to them, many franchisees make 
false assumptions about franchising. Part of the explanation for this is that 
franchising has an attractive lure. It is easy to become enthralled with the 
promise of franchising and not spend an adequate amount of time examining 
the potential pitfalls. The following is a list of misconceptions franchisees often 
have about franchising:
■ Franchising is a safe investment: Franchising, in and of itself, is no 
safer as an investment than is any other form of business ownership.
■ A strong industry ensures franchise success: Although it is generally 
important to operate in a growing industry, the strength of an indus-
try does not make up for a poor product, a poor business model, poor 
 management, or inappropriate advertising. There are many firms that 
fail in growing industries just as there are firms that succeed in unat-
tractive ones.
■ A franchise is a “proven” business system: A franchisor sells a fran-
chisee the right to use a particular business model. Whether the model 
is proven or not is subject to the test of time. Obviously, companies such 
as Subway, Papa John’s Pizza, and H&R Block are using models that are 
polished and that have worked well over time. Most prospective franchi-
sees, however, cannot afford a Papa John’s Pizza or a Subway unit and 
will be considering a lesser-known franchise. All too frequently, companies 
start selling franchises before their systems are anywhere close to being 
proven—a fact that should cause entrepreneurs to be wary.
■ There is no need to hire a franchise attorney or an accountant: 
Professional advice is almost always needed to guide a prospective fran-
chisee through the franchise purchase process. A prospective franchisee 
should never give in to the temptation to save money by relying solely on 
the franchisor’s advice.

552    PART 4 | MAnAgIng AnD gROWIng An EnTREPREnEURIAL FIRM
■ The best systems grow rapidly, and it is best to be a part of a rapid-
growth system: While some franchise systems grow rapidly because they 
have a good trademark and a polished business model, other franchise sys-
tems grow quickly because their major emphasis is on selling franchises. It 
is to a franchisee’s benefit to be part of a system that has a solid trademark 
and business system—as that trademark and system will attract more 
customers—but some franchise systems grow so quickly that they outrun 
their ability to provide their franchisees adequate support.
■ I can operate my franchise outlet for less than the franchisor predicts: 
The operation of a franchise outlet usually costs just as much as the fran-
chisor predicts.
■ The franchisor is a nice person—he’ll help me out if I need it: Although 
it may be human nature to rely on the goodwill of others, don’t expect any-
thing from your franchisor that isn’t spelled out in the franchise agreement.
Because these misconceptions are often hard to detect, some prospective 
franchisees attend seminars or franchise “boot camps” that teach them the ins 
and outs of franchising, including the things to watch out for when they talk to 
prospective franchisors. These types of seminars and boot camps are regularly of-
fered by organizations such as Women in Franchising, the United States Hispanic 
Chamber of Commerce, and the International Franchising Organization.
legal aspects of the Franchise 
relationship
According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), a franchise exists any time 
that the operations of a business involve (1) the selling of goods or services that 
bear a trademark, (2) the retention of significant control or assistance by the 
holder of the trademark on the operation of the business, and (3) royalty pay-
ments by the purchaser of the business to the owner of the trademark for the 
right to use the trademark in the business.
The legal and regulatory environment surrounding franchising is based on 
the premise that the public interest is served if prospective franchisees are as 
informed as possible regarding the characteristics of a particular franchisor. 
The offer and sale of a franchise is regulated at both the state and the federal 
level. The legal aspects of the franchise relationship are unique enough that 
some attorneys specialize in franchise law.
Federal rules and regulations
Except for the automobile and petroleum industries, federal laws do not di-
rectly address the franchisor–franchisee relationship. Instead, franchise dis-
putes are matters of contract law and are litigated at the state level. During the 
1990s, Congress considered several proposals for federal legislation to govern 
franchise relationships, but none became law.
However, the offer and sale of a franchise is regulated at the federal level. 
Under the Franchise Rule, which is enforced by the Federal Trade Commission 
(FTC), franchisors must furnish potential franchisees with written disclosures 
that provide information about the franchisor, the franchised business, and 
the franchise relationship. The disclosures must be supplied at least 14 busi-
ness days before a franchise agreement can be signed or the franchisee pays 
the franchisor any money.22 In most cases, the disclosures are made through 
a lengthy document referred to as the Franchise Disclosure Document, which 
is accepted in all 50 states and parts of Canada. The Franchise Disclosure

relationship.

CHAPTER 15 | FRAnCHISIng    553
Document (FDD) contains 23 categories of information that give a prospective 
franchisee a broad base of information about the background and financial 
health of the franchisor. A summary of the information contained in the FDD 
is provided in Table 15.7. A prospective franchisee should fully understand all 
the information contained in the FDD before a franchise agreement is signed.
The FDD requires the franchisor to attach a copy of the franchise agreement 
and any other related contractual documents to the circular. The  franchise 
agreement, or contract, is the document that consummates the sale of a fran-
chise. Franchise agreements vary, but each agreement typically contains two 
sections: the purchase agreement and the franchise or license agreement. The 
purchase agreement typically spells out the price, the services to be provided by 
the franchisor to the franchisee, and the “franchise package,” which refers to all 
the items the franchisee has been told to expect. The franchise or license agree-
ment typically stipulates the rights granted to the franchisee (including the right 
to use the franchisor’s trademark), the obligations and duties of the franchisor, 
the obligations and duties of the franchisee, trade restrictions, rights and limi-
tations regarding the transfer or termination of the franchise agreement, and 
who is responsible for attorney fees if disputes arise. Most states have enacted 
a statute of frauds that requires franchise agreements to be in writing.
The federal government does not require franchisors to register with the FTC. 
The offer of a franchise for sale does not imply that the FTC has examined the 
franchisor and has determined that the information contained in the franchisor’s 
FDD is accurate. The franchisor is responsible for voluntarily complying with the 
law, and it is the responsibility of prospective franchisees to exercise due diligence 
in investigating franchise opportunities. Although most franchisor–franchisee re-
lationships are conducted in an entirely ethical manner, it is a mistake to assume 
that a franchisor has a fiduciary obligation to its franchisees. What this means is 
that if a franchisor had a fiduciary obligation to its franchisees, it would always 
act in their best interest, or be on the franchisees’ “side.” Commenting on this is-
sue, Robert Purvin, an experienced franchise attorney, wrote:
While the conventional wisdom talks about the proactive relationship of the fran-
chisor to its franchisees, virtually every court case decided in the U.S. has ruled 
that a franchisor has no fiduciary obligation to its franchisees. Instead, U.S. 
courts have agreed with franchisors that franchise agreements are “arms length” 
business transactions.23
Purvin’s statement suggests that a potential franchisee should not rely solely 
on the goodwill of a franchisor when negotiating a franchise agreement. A po-
tential franchisee should have a lawyer who is fully acquainted with franchise 
law and should closely scrutinize all franchise-related legal documents.
state rules and regulations
In addition to the FTC disclosure requirements, 15 states have franchise in-
vestment laws that provide additional protection to potential franchisees.24 
The states are California, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, 
Minnesota, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, 
Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin. The franchise investment laws require 
franchisors to provide presale disclosures, known as “offering circulars,” to 
potential franchisees. Thirteen of the states have laws that treat the sale of a 
franchise like the sale of a security. These states require that a franchisor’s 
FDD be filed with a designated state agency and be placed into public record.
By requiring franchisors to file their FDDs with a state agency, these states

 6.  Other fees
 7.  Initial investment
These items specify the fees that the franchisee is subject to along with the 
franchisees’ initial investment, which can be quite substantial. The “other 
fees” section should be carefully studied to avoid any surprises.
 8.  Restrictions on sources of  products 
and services
These items stipulate the franchisee’s obligations, along with restrictions 
pertaining to where the franchisee is permitted to purchase supplies and services.
 9.  Franchisee’s obligations
Some franchise agreements require the franchisee to purchase supplies from 
the franchisor.
10. Financing available
11. Franchisor’s obligations
These items spell out the franchisor’s obligations, along with a description 
of the financing (if any) that the franchisor offers to the franchisee. The 
franchisor’s obligations typically include providing assistance in opening the 
franchisee’s unit, ongoing training, and advertising.

example, if someone purchased a franchise in one of the states fitting the pro-
file described previously and six months later discovered that the franchisor 
did not disclose an issue required by the FDD (and, as a result, felt that he or 
she had been damaged), that person could seek relief by suing the franchisor 
in state court. All 15 states providing additional measures of protection for 
franchisees also regulate some aspect of the termination process. Although the 
provisions vary by state, they typically restrict a franchisor from terminating 
the franchise before the expiration of the franchise agreement, unless the fran-
chisor has “good cause” for its action.
Although not as comprehensive as in the United States, at least 24 coun-
tries now have laws regulating franchising in some manner. Australia, Brazil, 
Romania, South Korea, and Spain are five of these countries.25
More about Franchising
There are a number of additional issues pertaining to the franchisor–franchisee 
relationship. Three important topics, for both franchisors and franchisees, are 
franchise ethics, international franchising, and the future of franchising as a 
method of business ownership and growth.
Franchise ethics
The majority of franchisors and franchisees are highly ethical individuals who 
are interested only in making a fair return on their investment. In fact, in-
stances of problems between franchisors and their franchisees tend to be iso-
lated occurrences rather than prevalent practices.26 There are certain features 
of franchising, however, that make it subject to ethical abuse. An understanding 
of these features can help franchisors and franchisees guard against making 
ethical mistakes. These features are the following:
■ The get-rich-quick mentality: Some franchisors see franchising as a get-
rich-quick scheme and become more interested in selling franchises than 
in using franchising as a legitimate means of distributing their product or 
service. These franchisors have a tendency to either oversell the potential of 
their franchise or overpromise the support they will offer to their franchisees.
■ The false assumption that buying a franchise is a guarantee of 
 business success: Buying a franchise, as with all other business 
 investments, involves risk. Any statement to the contrary is typically 
misleading or unethical. A franchisor must steer clear of claims that it 
has the “key” to business success, and a franchisee needs to be wary 
of all such claims.
■ Conflicts of interest between franchisors and their franchisees: The 
structure of the franchise relationship can create conflicts of interest be-
tween franchisors and their franchisees. For example, franchisees benefit 
from the profits of a unit, while franchisors benefit from increased revenues 
(recall that a franchisor’s royalty is typically paid on a percentage of gross 
profits rather than net profits). This anomaly in the franchise arrangement 
can motivate franchisors to take steps that boost revenues for the entire 
system but hurt profits for individual franchisees. For example, a franchisor 
might insist that a franchisee sell a product that has high revenue but low 
margins (or net income). Similarly, a franchisor might sell several franchises 
in a given geographic area to maximize the revenue potential of the area 
regardless of the effect on each individual franchisee’s net income. These 
actions can at times be ethically questionable and can often lead to conten-
tious conflicts of interest in franchise systems.

 7. Discuss two additional  
issues—franchise ethics and 
international franchising—
entrepreneurs should think 
about when considering 
franchising.

556    PART 4 | MAnAgIng AnD gROWIng An EnTREPREnEURIAL FIRM
Despite the protection of law and the advocacy of franchise associations, 
individual franchisors and franchisees must practice due diligence in their 
relationships. “Buyer beware” is a good motto for franchisors selecting fran-
chisees and prospective franchisees selecting franchisors. Entering into a 
franchise relationship is a major step for both parties and should be treated 
accordingly. The metaphor used frequently to describe the franchisor–franchi-
see relationship is marriage. Similar to marriage, the franchisor–franchisee 
relationship is typically close, long-term, and painful to terminate. Each side 
of the franchise partnership should scrutinize the past ethical behavior of the 
other before a franchise agreement is executed.
international Franchising
International opportunities for franchising are becoming more prevalent as 
the markets for certain franchised products in the United States have be-
come saturated.27 Indeed, heavily franchised companies, such as McDonald’s, 
KFC, and Century 21 Real Estate, are experiencing much of their growth in 
international markets. The trend toward globalization in many industries is 
also hastening the trend toward international franchising, and the growing 
middle classes in many countries are creating large populations of consumers 
eager for American-style goods. In fact, to illustrate how global many familiar 
franchise systems have become, there is a Papa John’s pizzeria in Karachi, 
Pakistan, a Denny’s in Christchurch, New Zealand, and a Chili’s Grill and Bar 
on a riverboat on the Egyptian Nile.
A U.S. citizen who is thinking about buying a franchise abroad may be 
confronted with the choice of buying from an American company or a foreign 
company, regardless of the location in the world. For U.S. citizens, these are 
some of the steps to take before buying a franchise in a foreign country:
■ Consider the value of the franchisor’s name in the foreign country: 
There are very few franchise systems whose names are known worldwide. 
Beyond a select few—McDonald’s, Coca-Cola, and KFC come to mind—the 
majority of trademarks well known to Americans may be known to only a 
small percentage of the population of a foreign country. When consider-
ing the purchase of a U.S.-based franchise in a foreign country, carefully 
evaluate the value of the trademark in that country.
■ Work with a knowledgeable lawyer: Many of the legal protections af-
forded to prospective franchisees in the United States are unavailable in 
foreign countries, highlighting the need for the purchaser of a franchise in 
a foreign country to obtain excellent legal advice. All the hazards involved 
with purchasing a domestic franchise are magnified when purchasing a 
franchise in a foreign country.
■ Determine whether the product or service is salable in a foreign 
country: Just because a product or service is desirable to Americans is no 
guarantee of success in a foreign culture. Before buying a franchise in a 
foreign country, determine if sufficient marketing research has been con-
ducted to ensure that the product or service will have a sufficient market 
in the foreign country.
■ Uncover whether the franchisor has experience in international mar-
kets: It is typically not a good idea to be a franchisor’s “test case” to see if 
the franchisor wants to operate in foreign markets. Be leery of franchisors 
with aggressive expansion plans but little international experience.
■ Find out how much training and support you will receive from the 
franchisor: If your franchise unit will be in a foreign country and the 
franchisor remains headquartered in the United States, make sure you 

CHAPTER 15 | FRAnCHISIng    557
fully understand the amount of training and support you can expect. Will 
the franchisor have an area representative in your country? If not, do 
you have to make an international phone call each time you want to talk 
to your franchisor? Will your franchisor be willing to travel to the foreign 
country to offer you training and support? Who pays for the international 
travel of the franchisor’s training staff? Who is responsible for advertising 
in the foreign country, the franchisor or the franchisee?
■ Evaluate currency restrictions: Evaluate any restrictions that the for-
eign country places on the convertibility of its currency into U.S. dollars.
To avoid some of the potential problems alluded to here, U.S. franchisors 
typically structure their expansion into a foreign country through the following:
■ Direct franchising arrangement: Under a direct franchise arrangement, 
the U.S. franchisor grants the rights to an individual or a company (the de-
veloper) to develop multiple franchised businesses within a country or ter-
ritory. For example, if Play It Again Sports decided to sell franchises for the 
first time in Spain, Play It Again Sports may grant the rights to a Spanish 
company to develop multiple Play It Again Sports franchises there.
■ Master franchise agreement: Under a master franchise arrangement, the 
U.S. firm grants the right to an individual or company (the master franchi-
see) to develop one or more franchise businesses and to license others to 
develop one or more franchise businesses within the country or territory.
■ Other agreements: Combinations of other arrangements are also em-
ployed by franchisors expanding to foreign markets. Examples include 
joint-venture arrangements, direct-sales arrangements, or straight fran-
chising agreements.
the Future of Franchising
The future of franchising appears bright. Franchising represents a large and 
growing segment of the retail and service sectors of U.S. businesses and is 
in some cases replacing more traditional forms of business ownership. More 
and more college graduates are choosing careers in industries that are heavily 
dominated by franchising. Franchising is also becoming more popular among 
seniors. At the same time, the number of franchises focusing on “senior care” 
is increasing. Aging Excellence, FirstLight HomeCare, and Visiting Angels are 
examples of senior care franchises, as is Comfort Keepers, which we discussed 
previously in this chapter.28
There are also innovations taking place today in franchising, such as the 
extensive use of social media that is occurring in many franchise organiza-
tions.29 There are additional innovations as well, such as the extensive use 
of instant couponing to encourage people to drop in and make a purchase. 
Many restaurant franchises are revamping their menus to appeal to health-
conscious consumers. There are a growing number of Internet-based franchise 
organizations. An example is My Destination (www.mydestination.com), which 
is an Internet franchise opportunity. The franchisor sells exclusive rights to 
franchisees for specific destinations, such as Vienna, Austria, Auckland, New 
Zealand, or Orlando, Florida. The franchisee then develops comprehensive in-
formation about the destination, with unique travel articles and guides, insider 
tips, videos, and panoramic virtual tours, all designed to be posted online. The 
franchisees make money in a number of ways, including by selling their content 
to business directories and local businesses. Franchisees are carefully selected, 
and they must have a unique passion and love for the destination they are 
purchasing.

increased buying power. The disadvan-
tages of setting up a franchise system 
include sharing profits with franchisees, 
loss of control, friction with franchisees, 
managing growth, differences in required 
business skills, and legal expenses.
 lO4. Preparing answers to the following ques-
tions helps the entrepreneur determine 
if buying a franchise is a good or effec-
tive decision for him or her. Questions for 
which the entrepreneur should prepare 
carefully thought out answers are: (1) Are 
you willing to take orders? (2) Are you will-
ing to be part of a franchise system rather 
than to seek to operate primarily indepen-
dently? (3) How will you react if you make 
a suggestion to your franchisor and your 
suggestion is rejected? (4) What are you 
looking for in a business? And (5) How 
willing are you to put your money at risk?
 lO5. Once an entrepreneur has decided to buy 
a franchise as part of an ongoing franchise 
system, s/he should expect to take the 
following steps to complete the purchase 
transaction: (1) visit several of the fran-
chisor’s outlets, (2) meet with a franchise 
attorney, (3) meet with the franchisor and 
check the franchisor’s references, (4) review 
all franchise documents with the attorney, 
(5) sign the franchise agreement, (6) attend 
training, and (7) open the franchise busi-
ness unit.
 lO6. In the United States, there are a number 
of rules and regulations at both the fed-
eral and individual state levels that per-
tain to franchising. The premise behind 
all of these rules and regulations is that 
the public interest is best served when 
prospective franchisees have as much ac-
curate information as possible about the 
characteristics of individual franchisors. 
The offer and sale of a franchise is regu-
lated at the federal level. Increasingly, 
franchising is being regulated in some 
form or fashion in countries outside the 
United States. The Franchise Disclosure 
Document (FDD) is a document with 23 
categories of information that is used 
prominently in the United States. This 
document provides a prospective franchi-
see a broad base of information about 
 lO1. A franchise is an agreement between a 
franchisor (the parent company, such as 
McDonald’s) and a franchisee (an individ-
ual or firm that is willing to pay the fran-
chisor a fee for the right to sell its product 
or service). There are two distinctly differ-
ent types of franchise systems: the prod-
uct trademark franchise and the business 
format franchise. A product trademark 
franchise is an arrangement under which 
the franchisor grants to the franchisee 
the right to buy its products and use its 
trade name. Automobile dealerships and 
soft-drink distributorships are examples 
of product trademark franchises. In a 
business format franchise, the franchisor 
provides a formula for doing business to 
the franchisee along with training, ad-
vertising, and other forms of assistance. 
Curves and Comfort Keepers are exam-
ples of this type of franchise system. An 
individual franchise agreement involves 
the sale of a single franchise for a specific 
location. An area franchise agreement al-
lows a franchisee to own and operate a 
specific number of outlets in a particu-
lar geographic area. A master franchise 
agreement is similar to an area franchise 
agreement with one major exception: In 
addition to having the right to operate a 
specific number of locations in a particu-
lar area, the franchisee also has the right 
to offer and sell the franchise to other 
people in the area.
 lO2. Entrepreneurs take the following nine 
steps to establish a franchise system: (1) 
develop a franchise business plan, (2) get 
professional advice, (3) conduct an intel-
lectual property audit, (4) develop fran-
chise documents, (5) prepare operating 
manuals, (6) plan an advertising strategy 
and a franchise training program, (7) put 
together a team for opening new franchise 
units, (8) plan a strategy for soliciting 
prospective franchisees, and (9) help fran-
chisees with site selection and the grand 
opening of their franchise outlets.
 lO3. The advantages of setting up a franchise 
system include rapid, low-cost market ex-
pansion; income from franchise fees and 
royalties; franchisee motivation; access to 
ideas and suggestions; cost savings; and 

CHAPTER 15 | FRAnCHISIng    559
a franchisor’s background and financial 
health. The FDD must be provided by the 
franchisor to a prospective franchisee at 
least 10 business days before a franchise 
contract can be signed or the franchisee 
pays the franchisor any money.
 lO7. Entrepreneurs considering franchising also 
need to be aware of the role of ethics 
within franchising relationships. Evidence 
suggests that most franchisors and fran-
chisees are ethical parties who want to 
support each other in the pursuit of profit-
generating business transactions. On the 
other hand, entrepreneurs should under-
stand that three features of franchising—a 
get-rich-quick mentality, a false assumption 
that purchasing a franchise is a guarantee 
of entrepreneurial success, and potential 
conflicts of interest between the franchisee 
and the franchisor—have the potential to 
create ethical issues. Entrepreneurs think-
ing of franchising should also recognize that 
franchising is not a strictly U.S. phenom-
enon. In fact, opportunities to engage in in-
ternational franchising are becoming more 
and more prevalent. Although potentially 
attractive, entrepreneurs from any country 
thinking of buying a franchise in a different 
country should carefully examine all local 
rules and regulations, as well as the fran-
chisor itself, prior to deciding to purchase a 
franchise.

ferences between a product and trade-
mark franchise and a business format 
franchise? For a first-time entrepre-
neur, she wonders, is there an advan-
tage to one of these types of franchise 
agreements compared to the other one? 
If so, which one is more advantageous 
for the first-time entrepreneur to pur-
sue and why?

entrepreneur who is enthusiastic about 
developing his business venture. He has 
established a good, reputable name for 
his fast-food outlet. “The Crunchies,” 
Andrew’s outlet, has been a household 
name among patrons in his neighbor-
hood. There is scope to expand his busi-
ness, especially since his outlet has a 
potentially strong trademark and a well-
designed business model, and Andrew 
has a strong desire to grow. He should 
consider franchising his business. How 
should he do this?
 15-24. As a lead trainer in the “How to Create a 
Successful Franchise” seminar, you need 
to address your audience on the do’s and 
don’ts of franchising. One particular par-
ticipant approached you at the end of the 
seminar. He was still confused about the 
legal aspects of franchising and needed 
personal tutoring. Guide him.
 15-25. Look at Table 15.4. If you were offered 
the opportunity to buy into any one 
of the franchise organizations listed 
in Table 15.4, which one would it be? 
Explain the rationale for your selection.
 15-26. A friend of yours owns a carpet installa-
tion and cleaning business, which is a

thinking about buying a 1-800-Water 
Damage franchise, which is a franchise 
that helps home owners and businesses 
restore property that has been damaged 
by a flood or water leak. His thinking is 
that he already has most of the equip-
ment he needs to perform this type of 
service and has an experienced crew. 
Is your friend a good candidate for a 
1-800-Water Damage franchise? If not, 
what type of franchise could he buy 
that would be a good fit with his current 
business?

batteries retail franchise. He tells you 
that he is excited about the opportu-
nity because the system he is about to 
buy into (1) is in an industry that virtu-
ally guarantees its success, (2) has a 
“proven” business model, and (3) is oper-
ated by people who are so honest that 
he can skip the expense of hiring a fran-
chise attorney to review the documents 
he has to sign. If your friend asked you,

this opportunity correctly?” how would 
you respond?

Business idea: Develop a 24-hour-a-day, convenient, 
on-demand ice vending destination offering fresh, clean 
ice at a competitive price.
pitch: Think about the experience of buying ice. You 
go to a supermarket or convenience store, reach into 
a freezer department, and pull out a bag of ice that is 
partially stuck to other bags. You then bring the bag 
home, and have to slam it on the counter several times 
to break the pieces of ice apart. If you’re lucky, you don’t 
think about how the ice was made. It’s normally made 
at a central location, bagged, loaded on a truck, and 
carried into the store on a cart. The bags have tiny holes 
which allow them to “breathe.” Unfortunately, the holes 
can also allow germs and other contaminants to be 
transferred to the ice. This is the ice that you put in the 
glasses of your family members and guests.
IceBorn offers an alternative that’s a game-changer. 
It’s a franchise organization that manufactures state-
of-the-art, 24-hour, on-demand ice and water vending 
machines. The machines come in several sizes, and they 
dispense filtered water and both bagged and straight-
to-the-cooler ice. The largest machine, the Ice House, 
can dispense more than 12,000 pounds of ice a day, 
which is the equivalent of six hundred 20-pound bags. 
It normally sits in a parking lot, and takes up the space 
of about two parking places. The ice is produced fresh 
using municipal-supplied water that is filtered on site. 
The company’s proprietary system, which is protected 
by five U.S. patents, can be monitored and controlled by 
franchisees remotely via a computer or smartphone. Ice 
is made continuously throughout the day and is stored in 
sanitary internal bins. As a result, it is always fresh and 
clean. no one touches the ice other than the buyer.
IceBorn began franchising in May 2012. Depending on 
the IceBorn model, the initial investment ranges from 
$18,995 to $130,000 plus fees for site preparation, ship-
ping, and installation. As of summer 2014, the company 
had commitments for more than 1,800 units in 19 states. 
IceBorn has been around for about 10 years. Prior to 
franchising, the company sold units, and there are about 
2,700 individually-owned IceBorn units located in the 
United States, primarily in the South. IceBorn is currently 
looking for franchisees across the United States to install 
its machines in well-trafficked areas.
Ice is a $4 billion-per-year industry. In just 10 years, 
the ice vending business has captured 4 percent of the 
market, and it is expected by some industry experts to 
increase by 3 percent to 5 percent each year for the next 
10 years. IceBorn feels that it is perfectly positioned to

Business idea: Launch a franchise organization that 
acquaints kids ages 4 to 14 with STEM concepts via 
hands-on workshops. STEM is an acronym that stands for 
Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math.
pitch: The U.S. Department of Commerce projects that 
STEM jobs will grow by 17 percent from now until 2018, 
creating 2.4 million jobs. In contrast, overall job growth is 
expected to be 10 percent during the same period. Ironically, 
a recent study by Intel Corp reported that 63 percent of 
teenagers have never considered a job in engineering. 
Many young people also don’t realize the social good that 
engineers can do. By building dams, finding solutions that 
provide people in developing countries with clean water, or 
building better medical devices, engineers can positively 
impact the lives of millions of people.
Engineering for Kids, which is a franchise organization, 
was founded to bring this message to 4- to 14-year-old 
students. It conveys the message and helps build requi-
site skills, primarily through six-week after-school pro-
grams that last for about 90 minutes and meet once 
a week. The programs are divided into three different 
age groups—Junior Engineers (Pre-K to 2nd grade), 
Apprentice Engineers (3rd to 5th grade) and Master 
Engineers (6th to 8th grade). Each class is given an en-
gineering problem that the kids are asked to address. 
The classes have different names and different subject 
matters, so the same child can repeat the program and 
work on a different problem each class. For example, in 
the Junior Engineer category one class is titled “Taking 
to the Skies.” In the class for pre-K to 2nd graders they 
are introduced to fundamental concepts of aircraft and 
spacecraft designs and, through hands-on instruction, 
the students design and construct model airplanes, 
rockets, hot air balloons, and more. An example of 
a more advanced course in the Master Engineering

category, which is for kids from 6th to 8th grade, is 
a class titled “Rescue Robots.” In the class students 
design and program robots to respond to simulated di-
saster situations such as removing rubble from a house 
or a building destroyed by an earthquake, tornado, or 
similar natural disaster. Each class is hands-on with a 
low instructor-to-student ratio. The participants pay a fee 
for attending the classes.
Along with after-school classes, Engineering for Kids fran-
chises also offer home-school programs, Scouts work-
shops, birthday parties, summer camps, and the like. 
Some franchises partner with public schools, YMCAs, and 
introduction
In 1996 Paul green, a University of Pennsylvania phi-
losophy graduate, started giving guitar lessons in his 
home. At one point, he invited a group of his students 
to sit in, or “jam,” with his own band. The results were 
initially disappointing. But over time, he found that the 
students who played in a group did better than the 
students who received only individual instruction. As a 
result, he modified his teaching methods to supplement 
individual lessons with group practices. He compared it 
to the difference between shooting hoops and playing 
basketball.
green continued combining individual instruction 
with group jam sessions. In 1998, he decided to expand 
beyond his home, and opened the Paul green School of 
Rock Music in Philadelphia. The building he chose had 
a number of small rooms for individual lessons along 
with a larger space for jam sessions and concerts. He 
also started organizing students, with similar skill lev-
els, into bands. His top students were put into what he 
called the school’s AllStars band. The band started get-
ting gigs in the Philadelphia area, and attracted media 
attention. In 2003, filmmakers Sheena M. Joyce and 
Don Argott attended a concert by the students, and 
decided to make a documentary about the Paul green 
School of Rock and how it transformed high school stu-
dents into performing musicians. A film crew followed a 
class of students through a nine-month school year and 
produced a documentary titled Rock School. Shortly af-
ter the documentary was released, Paramount released 
a fictional film called School of Rock, which featured 
an aspiring musician teaching kids to play rock music. 
Many observers felt the film was based on green and 
the way he worked with students.
early growth
By 2002, green had more than 100 students, and de-
cided to open an additional location in Dowingtown, 
Pennsylvania, which is 35 miles west of Philadelphia. 
Expansion continued in counties around Philadelphia 
and then in new Jersey and Delaware. Along the way 
green’s dentist, Dr. Joseph Roberts, became interested 
in what green was doing, and provided funding to open 
School of Rock locations in several additional states, 
including California, new York, and Texas. At some point 
along the way green shortened the name of his busi-
ness from the Paul green School of Rock Music to the 
School of Rock.
In 2009, green sold the School of Rock to Sterling 
Partners, a private equity firm. Sterling has kept the orig-
inal vision for the School of Rock intact and has used its 
financial resources to fuel further expansion.
how it Works
Each School of Rock location provides a place for kids 
with a passion for rock music to either learn how to play 
a rock instrument or sharpen their existing skills. It’s also 
a wholesome and safe place for kids to learn to play rock 
music and become part of a rock band. Kids 7 to 19 of 
all different skill levels spend 12 weeks in sessions learn-
ing to play the guitar, bass, keyboards, or drums. Voice

are encouraged to visit to jam, work on their songs with 
other students, form bands, or write original music. 
The school becomes a community for its participants, 
where they not only learn music but also form lasting 
friendships. Many students enroll for multiple 12-week 
sessions, where their skills are allowed to advance and 
flourish. The schools operate year-round. During the 
summer, winter, and spring breaks from school, many 
School of Rock locations offer day camps for intensive 
instruction.
Franchising
The School of Rock is a franchise organization. It cur-
rently has 16 company-owned units and 118 franchise 
locations, located in the United States, Mexico, Canada, 
Brazil, Australia, and the Philippines. According to 
Entrepreneur magazine, purchasing a franchise costs 
between $147,850 and $334,600, depending on the 
location and the size of the facility. The costs include 
a $49,500 initial franchise fee. The ongoing royalty is 
8 percent of gross income.
In exchange for the fees and royalties, the franchi-
sees receive training in how to run a School of Rock 
location, along with IT support including a website, 
assistance with real estate selection, help with facility 
lessons are also provided. The students receive both 
group and individual lessons. Tuition varies across School 
of the Rock locations, averaging $300 a month for the 
basic program. The most skilled students in each loca-
tion form a band and play concerts in their city. The top 
students in each school become members of an AllStars 
band and tour nationally. A recent School of Rock AllStars 
band completed a 27-city tour, which kicked off at the 
Knitting Factory in Hollywood, California. As a result of 
experiences like this, a number of School of Rock gradu-
ates are now performing musicians or are making a living 
in the music industry in other ways.
Most School of Rock instructors are music teach-
ers who also play in an active band. From time to time, 
prominent rock musicians make guest appearances at 
School of Rock locations. The instructors help students 
hone their musical skills and inspire them with tales of 
their own successes and recoveries from failures. The 
company’s foundational belief is that the best way to 
learn or do something is by doing it, so students are 
handed instruments and are playing rock music from 
the minute they enroll. The curriculum is formulaic, 
depending on a particular student’s skill level, and is 
driven by the added motivation that students will be 
placed in bands and play in front of live audiences. The 
schools are set up much like a club, where students

currently 33.5 million teenagers in the United States, all 
looking for a place to fit in and shine. The School of Rock 
offers a one-of-a-kind experience for 7- to 19-year-olds 
willing to commit to the rigors and joys of becoming suc-
cessful musicians.

School of Rock franchisees own more than one loca-
tion. To obtain a School of Rock franchise, you must 
commit to actively running and managing the location 
you acquire (i.e., no absentee ownership).
new programs
Along with its staple 12-week music instruction pro-
grams for 7- to 19-year-olds, the School of Rock is add-
ing additional programs. It now has a program in early 
childhood music education called Little Wing, after the 
Jimi Hendrix song by the same name. Children partici-
pate in 45-minute music-related activities by age group. 
There is now a program for adult amateur musicians 
called “grad School.” Two additional offerings include 
a career development program for working musicians 
and a corporate team building program. In the corporate 
team building program, School of Rock instructors divide 
the participants into two groups. Each group learns how 
to play a classic rock song. At the end of the experi-
ence, the two groups come together for an old-fashioned 
battle of the bands.
school of rock Future
There are two factors to suggest a strong future for the 
School of Rock. The first is a reduction in music programs 
in public schools. Regrettably, as a result of tight budgets, 
a growing number of schools across the United States are 
cutting back on music programs. The School of Rock is 
poised to fill the gap. It is already the largest after-school 
introduction
The idea for gameTruck first came to Scott novis at his 
son’s fourth birthday party. They were at a pizza arcade 
and the noise, expense, and frustration caused him to 
think about a better alternative. What’s more, he knew 
that the electronic games he was working on at his job 
were better than anything in the arcade. That experience 
led to an epiphany. Instead of taking kids to an arcade 
for birthday parties or similar events, why not bring the 
arcade to their homes? And what if, instead of making 
something “kiddy,” the arcade featured the best video 
games available on the latest consoles? And what if it 
was something that people of all ages could enjoy?
These thoughts were the foundation for the 
launching of gameTruck, novis’s entrepreneurial ven-
ture. gameTruck is the world’s first mobile video game 
theater. The basic idea was to create a  mobile arcade 
or truck that contained the latest video games, video 
game consoles, and large screens for people to play 
multiplayer video games. By making the arcade mo-
bile, it could be taken anywhere for people to enjoy.

There are several different models of the mobile ar-
cade or truck, from a tow-behind trailer to a “top of the 
line” all-in-one unit that looks like a large tour bus. The 
mobile theater will travel to any location that has a large 
enough parking area for it to set up. Once it arrives, it 
is entirely self-sufficient and provides its own power. It 
can accommodate up to 20 players, who can engage in 
multiplayer video games aided by ultra-modern consoles 
and 54-inch screens. The atmosphere inside the truck 
is super cool, with neon green lighting, spacious leather 
couches, and air-conditioning. gameCoaches are avail-
able to help participants learn new games or troubleshoot 
any problems that occur. Along with providing a venue for 
a fun birthday party or another occasion, a staple concept 
of the gameTruck experience is to encourage people to 
play electronic games with one another. gameTruck finds 
themselves as a solution to the common complaint by 
parents that computer games isolate their children and 
cause them to focus on playing against their computer 
rather than socializing with other kids. The gameTruck ex-
perience is designed to bring kids, their friends, and their 
families together to participate in multiplayer games in a 
fun and highly engaging environment. Founded in 2006, 
gameTruck now has over 70 franchisees that are making 
gameTruck parties available on a weekly basis in cities 
across the United States. A total of 40 percent of the com-
pany’s franchisees run multi-rig operations.
Sound simple enough? It is, but as straightforward 
as the gameTruck concept is, it took a great deal of ef-
fort and hard work to get off the ground. And there are 
also questions regarding how gameTruck will continue 
to grow and evolve its offering.

place, a gameTruck franchisee can be up-and-running 
within 12 weeks.
The cost of gameTruck parties varies. On weekends 
the Des Moines, Iowa, franchise, for example, charges 
$295 for the first two hours and $95 for each additional 
hour. The rates drop some for weekdays. In contrast, 
the weekend rates in Chicago are $425 for the first two 
hours and $125 for each additional hour. Parents choose 
the games that will be played. For example, M (mature) 
rated games can be removed from parties for younger 
children. One unique aspect of gameTruck’s offering to 
its franchisees is that because most parties are held on 
weekends, a gameTruck franchisee can be owned and 
operated by someone who has another job.
One aspect of its business that gameTruck points 
to as a positive indicator for continued success is that 
its Phoenix, Arizona, headquarters serves as a base 
for ongoing refinement of the gameTruck experience. 
The company remains laser focused on bringing people 
scott novis
gameTruck’s founder, Scott novis, is no stranger to 
electronic games. He has nearly a decade of video 
game development experience, working for several 
companies. His two stops prior to gameTruck were 
particularly instrumental. At one point, he was the VP 
for Development for Rainbow Studios, which is one 
of the largest video game development studios in the 
Southwestern United States. During novis’s tenure, 
Rainbow Studios was responsible for some of the 
most successful games of the PS2 era. His stop just 
prior to gameTruck was with Walt Disney Corporation, 
where he developed a new kind of video game stu-
dio, dubbed the Walt Disney nintendo Center for 
Excellence.
novis’s vision for gameTruck was to create a 
physical, mobile space where people could play the 
best video games on the latest consoles with their 
friends in an effortless, affordable, and fun atmo-
sphere. It also had to be operable by virtually anyone 
with a passion for video games and a desire to work 
with kids and their families. The first gameTruck pro-
totype was built in novis’s garage in Tempe, Arizona. 
To see how the prototype would perform, novis and 
his brother Chris threw the first gameTruck party for 
a friend and neighbor. novis and gameTruck ben-
efited from a fortunate convergence of technologies, 
which took place at about the time novis’s ideas for 
gameTruck came together. The three technologies, 
each of which is instrumental to gameTruck’s offer-
ing, are shown in the figure nearby.
Franchise setup and gametruck offering
A gameTruck franchise costs between $122,500 and 
$310,500 to open, depending on the location and the 
model of the gameTruck trailer or mobile unit acquired. 
The initial franchise fee is $12,500. The ongoing royalty 
is 7 percent of gross sales. There are additional market-
ing and operational support fees.
gameTruck offers its franchisees multiple levels 
of assistance and support. The size of a franchisee’s 
territory is determined by taking into consideration 
factors such as number of schools in a particular area, 
the average family income level of the area, and other 
demographic factors. Each gameTruck franchisee is 
provided training in regard to how to book parties, 
how to operate the gameTruck trailer, and how to set 
up a local marketing plan. Because the training pro-
gram is so comprehensive, no prior experience is nec-
essary to own and operate a gameTruck franchise. 
The company is establishing a strong brand recogni-
tion. Its trailers and mobile units are painted a bright

together in a multiplayer gaming context in the most 
innovative, cutting-edge, and cost-effective manner 
possible. gameTruck has received some recognition 
along the way. In January 2013, Entrepreneur magazine 
ranked gameTruck #218 on its list of the 500 fastest 
growing franchises in the United States. Later in the 
year, Entrepreneur ranked gameTruck the #7 top new 
franchise and the #55 top home based franchise.
Challenges ahead
As gameTruck evaluates future growth and the ongo-
ing viability of its basic concept, several questions 
will need to be answered. First, is there a market for 
its mobile game studios beyond the staple kid’s party 
market? Some gameTruck franchisees are now offer-
ing laser-tag on-site adventures and corporate events. 
There may be other possibilities. Second, although 
many observers see the electronic games market as 
recession-proof, there is always the possibility that 
downturns in the economy may deter parents and 
other potential users from booking a gameTruck party, 
which costs a minimum of $295 for two hours. What 
can gameTruck do to minimize that possibility? Finally, 
is gameTruck’s business model scalable utilizing 
the franchise concept? Will gameTruck be success-
ful in its efforts to find a sufficient number of future 
franchisees who are passionate about gaming, have 
the financial ability to own and operate a gameTruck 
franchise, and are able to either operate the franchise 
successfully on a part-time basis or book sufficient 
parties to make it a full-time pursuit? There is a pos-
sibility that some gameTruck franchisees may find 
themselves caught in the middle—it’s too much work 
to operate as a part-time business but it doesn’t pro-
vide enough income to justify doing it full-time. How 
gameTruck resolves these challenges will be instru-
mental to its future success.
Discussion Questions
 15-38. What do you think of gameTruck’s basic concept?
 15-39. Would you characterize gameTruck’s potential na-
tionwide market as small, medium, or large? Would 
the concept work in the town where your college or 
university is located? Explain your answer.
 15-40. What qualities do you think gameTruck looks for in 
prospective franchisees? If you were a prospective 
franchisee, what questions would you ask the com-
pany as part of your due diligence process?
 15-41. Address each of the rhetorical questions at the end of 
the case. Add two challenges gameTruck may face 
that are not mentioned in the case. Comment on how 
problematic each challenge is and if you think the 
company will successfully deal with both challenges.
