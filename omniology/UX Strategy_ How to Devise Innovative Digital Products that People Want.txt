[ Foreword ]
When I was 21 years old and taking the train into Manhattan from 
Brooklyn to fix laser printers and dream of a career in “multimedia,” 
I would read about Jaime Levy’s work hoping that one day I would get 
to meet her.
In the early 90s, we didn’t have the Web, but we did have bulletin board 
systems (BBS), and new media was evolving fast. Computers had just 
begun offering built-in modems and CD-ROM drives, but we were a 
couple of years away from web browsers and broadband.
Jaime got to the digital revolution before all of us, having made a flop-
py-disk magazine series from 1990 to 1992—WIRED debuted its print 
magazine in 1993. That same year, she did this crazy interactive press 
kit for Billy Idol that he distributed with his album Cyberpunk.
At that time, I started a “zine” called CyberSurfer, my screenname 
online, and published five issues. The folks at PAPER Magazine gave 
me a gig writing a column for them called “CyberSurfer’s Sillycon 
Alley,” and I would cover Jaime’s work often—primarily because she 
was the only person actually doing work! 
She never got rich, but she made great art and followed her vision of 
what the interactive world should be. In fact, she turned down her 
chance at being a billionaire as the third co-founder of Razorfish.
In 1996, I hosted a pitching contest called “Ready, Set… Pitch!” at 
Josh Harris’ famous loft for Pseudo.com. Jaime pitched Electronic 
Hollywood, a studio that would make cartoons and interactive experi-
ences for the Web.
She saw casual games and YouTube a decade before they hit, and before 
anyone used the terms “UX” and “IA,” she was teaching all of us about 
“experience” and “flows.”

vi  |   Foreword
I’ve been lucky enough to build or invest in over 100 Internet busi-
nesses, from Uber to Engadget, and I can tell you that if you want to 
build a product that changes the world, the first place you should begin 
is where you are right now—in Jaime’s hands.
Listen and consider what she says in this book deeply. This is the “miss-
ing manual” for the Lean Startup and Lean UX techniques that you’ve 
always wanted.
Nondesigners especially should continue reading, because Jaime takes 
the time to explain the oftentimes intimidating jargon and processes 
that designers throw around, effortlessly and clearly for you, the reader.
Late one night, when we were kids in our 20s dreaming about the 
Internet and what it might become and how to be successful with it, 
Jaime explained it to me concisely: “It’s all about the experience.”
There is not better advice for building product, or living your life. It’s 
all about the experience.

[ Preface ]
Strategy is about connecting the dots. It requires you to look 
at what’s happened in the past and what’s going on in the present to 
make better guesses about the future. People who do strategy need to 
be inquisitive, objective, and fearless. They need to be risk takers who 
stalk and kill their prey by going for the throat.
User experience (UX) strategy lies at the intersection of UX design and 
business strategy. It is a practice that, when done empirically, provides 
a much better chance of a successful digital product than just crossing 
your fingers, designing some wireframes, and then writing a bunch of 
code.
This book presents a solid framework on the practice of UX strategy. 
It is geared specifically for crafting innovative products and takes you 
through numerous lightweight techniques that you can use regardless 
of your work environment. The basic principles of business strategy do 
not need to be a mystery requiring somebody with an MBA to under-
stand. Strategy, just like design, is something that you can master only 
by practicing it.
Who Should Read This Book?
This book addresses the large knowledge gap between UX design and 
business strategy. It was written with the following types of product 
makers in mind:
Entrepreneurs, digital product managers, and intrapreneurial teams
You want to lead your team—visual and UX designers, developers, 
marketers, and so on—to craft a successful product with a killer 
UX. However, there are limitations on your time, cash, and other 
resources, and that means focusing your team’s efforts on tech-
niques of applied simplicity, or putting the most essential and afford-
able tools into practice. You understand Lean Startup principles and

want to cut corners on research and evaluation, but you also know 
that you need to make decisions based on a sound strategy. This 
book will provide you and your team with the necessary lightweight 
tools for testing value propositions, finding opportunities for creat-
ing value in the marketplace, and designing for conversion.
UX/Interaction/UI Designers 
You’re frustrated. You feel like you are a cog in the wheel mak-
ing design deliverables. You want your work to be more innovative 
and strategically sound, but you aren’t involved with product defi-
nition at a strategic level. You fear that you are hitting a career wall 
because you don’t have a business degree or marketing expertise. 
This book will teach you how to push back when you find yourself 
in the following situations:
•	 You’re assigned to create a site map and wireframes for a prod-
uct that you believe is just a rip-off of an existing one. You don’t 
want to spend the next six months reinventing the wheel. This 
book will show you how to be innovative by systematically cher-
ry-picking from your competitors.
•	 You have a stakeholder who is 100 percent certain that his prod-
uct vision is right, and you are told to implement it as is. You 
want to do user research to help him deviate from his original 
vision, but he won’t give you the budget. This book will demon-
strate different options for being intrapreneurial with or without 
buy-in.
•	 You get handed a massive requirements document for a trans-
actional product and are told to come up with a design that will 
increase conversion. This book will show you how to break down 
the stages of engagement and map desired actions to metrics.
Why I Wrote This Book
What has kept me on my toes while being a software designer and prac-
titioner is being a part-time teacher of the evolving discipline of user 
interface (UI) design and product strategy. Since 1993, I have taught 
everything from graduate-level courses for engineering students to 
adult education courses for working professionals who wanted to repo-
sition their career tracks with more marketable skill sets. But there was 
never a perfect book in any of those situations that gave my students 
www.allitebooks.com

 Preface   |  ix
everything they needed. Instead, I was constantly hounded to share 
my presentation decks, sample documents, and templates. I wrote this 
book to finally consolidate into one resource everything I know about 
the practice of UX strategy, which I learned from my work with start-
ups, agencies, and enterprises.
I also hope that designers and product makers who are aspiring strate-
gists will gain from my years of professional experience. I’ve had a lot 
of ups and downs in my professional and personal life, and they have 
informed my attitude toward trial and error. This is why even from the 
beginning I didn’t want to write a dry business or technology book. I 
wanted to write a book that chronicles the vitality and fluidity of what 
we actually experience in the real world of product design. I wanted to 
depict the entrepreneurial spirit, which isn’t just about success or tech-
niques that always work. I wanted to share that journey with the hope 
that you won’t get as scuffed up as I did along the way.
How This Book Is Organized
I organized this book based on how I have fine-tuned my teaching 
method over the years. Therefore, the first way to read this book is as 
it was originally intended—as a how-to guide to making an innovative 
digital product. If that’s how you choose to read it, you’ll want to begin 
with an idea or problem you hope to solve through a digital interface, 
because the only way to learn how to swim first is to get in the pool and 
become comfortable with freezing your butt off. As you and your team 
move through the chapters, you’ll unlock techniques in a linear order. 
Then, when you’re acquainted with all the techniques, you’ll be able to 
practice them in the future in whatever order works best.
The book has 11 chapters. Chapter 1 establishes what UX strategy is 
and is not. Chapter 2 introduces the UX strategy framework that will 
shape all the tools and techniques in this book. Chapters 3 through 9 
teach you how to perform those UX strategy techniques. Chapter 10 
includes four interviews with top strategists around the globe to give 
you some insight to their different perspectives on the subject. And 
finally, Chapter 11 wraps everything up in a brief conclusion.

What Is the UX Strategy Toolkit?
This book comes with a complimentary toolkit so that you and your 
teams can begin using it immediately for nailing a stellar UX strategy 
for your product. I’ve been refining these tools for years with clients, 
using them both for collaboration and as an output deliverable. They 
might seem unwieldy at first, but they are a crucial starting place to 
learn how to conduct efficient UX strategy. As you read, you’ll come 
across in-depth explanations of how each tool works and the benefits 
that each one provides.
To access the free UX Strategy Toolkit, go to the following URL:
http://userexperiencestrategy.com
After you download the toolkit—an Excel (.xlsx) file—simply import it 
into Google Drive as a spreadsheet. You will have full editing and shar-
ing privileges; so, by all means, share it with your team. There are tabs 
at the bottom of the spreadsheet with which you can switch among the 
different tools.
UX strategy requires collaboration among team members and stakehold-
ers. It doesn’t matter whether you’re a student in a classroom, a fledg-
ing startup, or a cross-functional team at an enterprise. The tactics don’t 
work unless you all work together. The best way to collaborate in this 
digital age is through cloud-based tools, and the cloud-based toolkit for 
this book will help you to align your onsite and remote teams to a prod-
uct vision. It’s also great because you can work together in real time on 
the same document, virtually chat with teammates, or leave contextual 
notes for later.

This book would not be in front of your eyes without my constant collab-
oration with Sarah Dzida. I first met Sarah in my UX design class while 
she was pursuing a master’s degree in writing. We eventually worked 
on a number of UX strategy and design projects together, which gave 
her firsthand insights into helping me tell the stories behind my busi-
ness cases. In the end, she did everything from helping me write the 
book proposal to serving as my writing coach from sample chapter to 
final draft, acting as the lead editor and applying her genius talents to 
structurally weave all of the crazy narratives together across the chap-
ters into a seamless epic. I’m forever grateful to her for sticking with 
me throughout my entire quest of becoming an author. I also want to 
extend my thanks and gratitude to the following people:
•	 Big thanks go to Lane Halley, my “Number 1” UX Guru and Lean 
Startup Queen, who has been my sounding board for this project 
since the first time it was presented as a lecture in Los Angeles.

What Is UX Strategy?
I’ve seen the needle and the damage done, 
a little part of it in everyone.
—NEIL YOUNG (1972)
A few years ago, a highly successful software engineer became 
an entrepreneur because he had a problem—someone he loved needed 
treatment for a drug addiction. He embarked on a daunting journey 
that millions of Americans face each year—to find appropriate care at 
a reputable facility. However, the road was filled with uncertainty and 
pain points; there was no price transparency, no centralized place to 
research the facilities with unbiased reviews, and scads of liars run-
ning overpriced facilities while preying on desperate people just like 
him. But during the course of his research, he discovered that repu-
table treatment centers also struggled with certain things: they con-
stantly had empty beds; they had difficulty sifting through referrals 
for appropriate patients; and it was a hassle to collect payments from 
insurance companies. At the end of his journey, the software engineer 
saw the opportunity to embark on a different kind of adventure. He 
could solve a market problem and at the same time help people with a 
personal problem about which he was very passionate. That’s how his 
startup was born; his idea to connect the right patients with the right 
kind of treatment centers through an online interface.
Because his product had the potential to disrupt the marketplace,* he 
was able to gather a solid team and get investment capital. He devel-
oped relationships with reputable rehabilitation facilities. He devel-
oped a database for matching empty beds with the people who needed

them.† He developed a way to vet each facility to ensure that only the 
best were included in the database. And, of course, he and his team 
developed a consumer-facing website for customer acquisition.
They didn’t leave anything to chance. They also conducted a couple of 
online surveys with people who had looked for treatment in the past. 
They hired public relations, marketing, and search-engine optimiza-
tion (SEO) firms. They bought advertising in print and online publica-
tions; talked to industry experts; and found many business-side part-
ners interested in their value proposition and who wanted to be a part 
of it.
When the site went live, they ran numerous online advertising cam-
paigns using Facebook and Google to promote the financial savings 
and data-rich reviews that customers could get by using their service. 
From these campaigns, only a small amount of traffic trickled to their 
home page and then bounced away. Sometimes, a user registered with 
the service. Sometimes, they even came back. But over the course of 18 
months, no one booked a treatment center through their website.
The software engineer’s team knew that whatever they were doing, it 
wasn’t working. They had the proof: millions of dollars spent building 
a product that hadn’t gained them one customer. Their investors and 
business partners were getting anxious. Their publicist continued to 
find media that were interested in the concept, but the outlets wouldn’t 
run the story without some activity on the site. Still, they had a lot of 
features and functionality built in to their interface to help users make 
the best decision possible.
“It must be the user experience,” the team hypothesized, which is when 
and why they came to me.
Like many product makers before them, they asked my user experi-
ence (UX) team to just redesign the “look and feel” of the site, ASAP. 
After all, they needed to meet the growing concerns of their business 
partners, and because they had a lot of entrenched functionality, they

felt it would be easy for my team to just build off of it. But we refused, 
because they didn’t just need a new UX design. They needed a new UX 
strategy.
Misinterpretations About UX Strategy
UX is an umbrella term that encompasses a lot of disciplines, and UX 
strategy lies somewhere at the intersection of UX design and business 
strategy. But the lines don’t exist in a vacuum. Instead, they exist in 
an elaborate anatomical structure with a lot of dots to connect. This 
is why there are so many different interpretations floating around UX 
strategy.
I first came across the term “UX strategy” in 2008 in an advanced-level 
UX book called Mental Models by Indi Young.‡ At the time of its writ-
ing, Young was attempting to help UX design ascend to the next level. 
As such, she offered her readers a mini-manifesto, which you can see 
in Figure 1-1.

Models, Rosenfeld Media, 2008; p 20.

4  |   UX STRATEGY
I really wanted to understand what UX strategy meant, but aside from 
the fact that the difference between “experience” strategy and “user 
experience” strategy just seems to be one word, the book didn’t delve 
any deeper into this abstract equation. Over the course of my career 
from working with big interactive agencies to enterprises, I’ve heard 
many other theoretical concepts about the intention of UX strategy. And 
that’s something I want to sidestep in this book: the entirely semantic 
disputes about what “strategy” means or whether a theoretical frame-
work has practical application. It’s important that we avoid battles that 
boil down to these kinds of debates. They only confuse our clients and 
stakeholders, and this is ultimately what happened in the early 2000s 
when there was so much debate about the differences between the 
practices of “user experience design” versus “interaction design.”
But misinterpretations, if they can do anything, can be useful in pro-
viding a grounding point for contrast. So, let’s get the big ones out of 
the way.
MISINTERPRETATION 1: UX STRATEGY IS ABOUT IDENTIFYING  
A “NORTH STAR”
Reality: the North Star is not the brightest star in the galaxy, but it has 
been used for navigation throughout history because of its “fixed” loca-
tion in the sky.§ In the context of the digital age, a team identifies that 
fixed point as the goal of their game plan and then sets course for it. This 
traditional business-strategy approach can work to galvanize a team in a 
large slow-moving enterprise. But what if your solution is an innovative 
digital product about to be launched in a fast-moving consumer market 
full of uncertainties? This requires an agile process—one that is variable 
and iterative with continuous feedback loops at several points along the 
way. You don’t want a North Star to guide your UX strategy; instead, you 
want a goal or point toward which to steer every time you pivot.
MISINTERPRETATION 2: UX STRATEGY IS A “STRATEGIC WAY” TO  
PERFORM UX DESIGN
Reality: I guess the opposite of this would be, what, doing nonstrategic 
UX design? UX design and UX strategy are two different things. When 
you are doing design, you are creating something. When you are doing 
§	  http://www.space.com/15567-north-star-polaris.html

 1. What Is UX Strategy?   |  5
strategy, you are coming up with a game plan before creating some-
thing. One way to explain it is to just substitute the word “product” for 
“user experience.” A product strategist thinks about all the possibilities 
for the product and defines it after researching the potential customers 
and existing competitors. She thinks about how much the product will 
cost to make and be priced to sell at, and how it will be distributed to 
different customer segments. In contrast, a product designer actually 
fabricates the thing. They are two separate disciplines.
Too often, I have seen UX designers work on products without being 
informed of the overall business strategy. They are blind beyond what 
they’ve received in the business requirements document. This discon-
nect is why the Lean UX movement is so popular; it advocates that 
UX designers take on a bigger leadership role (“getting a seat at the 
strategy table”) by becoming the glue that holds cross-functional teams 
together.
MISINTERPRETATION 3: UX STRATEGY IS JUST PRODUCT  
STRATEGY
Reality: Misinterpretation 2 points out the similarities between a prod-
uct strategist and UX strategist. However, that doesn’t mean that you 
can easily substitute one for the other (even if my parents think my lit-
tle brother [a product director/manager type] and I do the same thing 
for a living). The people who design the real-world shopping experience 
of a brick-and-mortar Target as well as the products in that store are 
thinking about a very different set of issues than the people designing 
Target.com.
But UX strategy goes beyond just one digital product or online expe-
rience. It spans dozens of different digital products, services, and plat-
forms; it interconnects all members of a digital interface family. Here 
are just a few examples to consider:
Apple
iMac, iPod, the physical Mac Store, iTunes, iCloud, and so on
LinkedIn
Desktop, mobile, and Premium
Adobe
Photoshop, Illustrator, and in the cloud

Amazon
Prime, AWS, Kindle, as a content creator, and so on
The UX strategy makes a case for all touch points and weaves them 
into a seamless ecosystem between buyer and seller through the UX 
design. It accounts for the user’s entire journey down the funnel. (For 
more on this, see Chapter 9.)
MISINTERPRETATION 4: UX STRATEGY IS CLOSELY TIED  
TO BRAND STRATEGY
Reality: brand strategy is how, what, where, when, and to whom you 
plan on communicating and delivering your brand messages through 
your distribution channels. Aspects of brand strategy can help define 
aspects of your product’s UX design, and vice versa. But it’s easy to con-
fuse these branding efforts and goals with a UX strategy. A poor UX 
can actually decrease the “brand value” of a product, but not so much 
the other way around. Even the brandiest of brands can’t overcome the 
poor UX of a product.
In their book Lean Entrepreneur,¶ Brant Cooper and Patrick Vlaskovits 
say, “Marketing can increase awareness for the product, but if the prod-
uct sucks, that’s what the buzz will be.” Apply this thinking to Google. 
It has a fantastic brand. Now, think about products like Google+, Buzz, 
and Wave. These products were consistent with the Google brand 
strategy, but they failed to stand up to public scrutiny on their own. 
When these products debuted, they baffled users and failed to acquire 
them. They bombed at the “Big Picture,” which was to solve the user’s 
dilemma over how to communicate to different networks of people 
through multiple products.
Another important thing to remember is that a solid UX design no lon-
ger differentiates brands. For companies such as Google, users assume 
the UX will be good. Google doesn’t have to announce it anymore, 
and when it’s bad, it’s all the more jarring. That’s why a UX strategy 
becomes even more potent. As the company grows and expands its dig-
ital properties, you need to constantly pivot and shift your game plan, 
baking your strategy into all online services effectively, reliably, and 
without friction. A product needs a good UX no matter what.

So What the Hell Is UX Strategy?
UX strategy is the process that should be started first, before the design 
or development of a digital product begins. It’s the vision of a solution 
that needs to be validated with real potential customers to prove that it’s 
desired in the marketplace. Although UX design encompasses numer-
ous details such as visual design, content messaging, and how easy it 
is for a user to accomplish a task, UX strategy is the “Big Picture.” It is 
the high-level plan to achieve one or more business goals under condi-
tions of uncertainty.
The purpose of any strategy is to create a game plan that looks at your 
current position and then helps you get to where you actually want 
to be. Your strategy should play to your strengths and be mindful of 
your weaknesses. It should rely on empirical, lightweight tactics that 
quickly move you and your team (because let’s face it, you’re proba-
bly not doing this alone) toward your desired destination. A solid strat-
egy is the difference between success and failure. In the digital-prod-
uct world, chaos—time delays, increased costs, and bad user experi-
ences—get exacerbated when there is no shared product vision among 
team members.
Like any good general, you need to develop that strategy. That’s why 
we convinced the beleaguered startup of our software engineer to step 
back and reformulate their game plan. Here’s what our hands-on UX 
strategy achieved for them in about a month:
•	 We questioned all the current research and found a lot of it was 
based on business assumptions rather than factual user data. This 
is why the client allowed my team to put the redesign on pause.
•	 We conducted guerrilla user research using a Minimum Viable 
Product (MVP) prototype with the clients sitting at the table. By 
hearing firsthand from their presumed customer, the clients 
acknowledged that their customer segment actually wasn’t “every-
body” who was getting ripped off by bad treatment centers. Instead, 
they had built a business model that needed a direct marketing 
channel targeted at an affluent customer segment.
•	 We experimented on new value propositions by testing customer 
acquisition with landing pages. This helped open the clients’ minds 
to other possible business models, such as a business-to-business 
(B2B) solution.

8  |   UX STRATEGY
Sure, many of the findings were super depressing for the clients. They 
had spent a lot of time and money building a product that didn’t work. 
Initially they blamed their site’s “user experience.” But by looking at the 
big picture, we showed them how a lot of their UX was actually getting 
hamstrung by other things that went beyond the digital interface.
Why a UX Strategy Is Crucial
A mental model is the conceptual model in a person’s mind about how 
a thing works. For instance, when I was 10 years old, I believed the way 
my mom got cash was by going to a bank, signing a slip of paper, and 
then receiving the funds from the teller. When I was 20, I believed I 
needed to take a bank card and key code to access an ATM to get cash. 
But if you were to ask my 10-year-old son how to get cash, he would 
tell you to go to the supermarket and ask the cashier to give you some 
when you pay for your groceries. The 2015 mental model for getting 
cash is very different from the 1976 mental model. That’s because new 
technologies and new business processes come together to offer a more 
efficient way for people to accomplish tasks. Stale mental models are 
overturned. Life is disrupted for the better!
This is why I love working with startups, because entrepreneurs are 
the biggest risk takers of them all. They quit their day jobs and go all in 
on one big idea that they are passionate about. Our software engineer 
was just that type of person—after a difficult personal experience, he 
wanted to solve a problem so that others would not have to experience 
his pain. He wanted to change a mental model.
Even though envisioning innovative products is fun, it’s hard to get 
people to change their behavior. Customers have to see the value in 
the new way before they’ll consider abandoning the old. Devising new 
products to solve serious dilemmas is not for the faint of heart. You 
must be passionate and at least a little crazy to run headlong into all the 
obstacles that inevitably will get in the way.
Yet, it’s the passion to solve a problem, change the world, and make it 
an easier place to live in that makes for game-changing products. And 
this passion is not limited to entrepreneurs who quit their day jobs. 
It also emboldens people who have titles like product manager, UX 
designer, or developer. These are people who also are passionate about 
using technology to devise products that customers want. When you 
bring these types of people together, you have the necessary means to 

 1. What Is UX Strategy?   |  9
potentially make magic happen and destroy outdated mental models. 
Because time on earth is finite, why else would you want to build any-
thing else?
My goal in this book is to demystify the practice of UX strategy so that 
you can do just that. You’ll be able to immediately apply UX strategy 
techniques to your projects in a variety of work settings to keep you 
and your team from getting overwhelmed no matter what limitations 
you face.
I’ll show you how it can happen through a variety of business cases. 
You’ll meet some of my former clients—our aforementioned software 
engineer, a Hollywood producer, and an entrepreneur named Jared 
who wants to eliminate the need for currency with his transactional 
online platform. You’ll meet two of my students—Bita and Ena—who 
participated in a UX apprenticeship in which they chased a made-up 
value proposition in order to document my UX strategy process. I’ll 
even reach back into my family ancestry, because I know I was incen-
tivized to be entrepreneurial from watching and learning from my par-
ents. You’ll see how the journey is a reward, no matter if you’re the 
teacher, student, or maker. You’ll also see that no matter the project or 
the circumstances, devising products is like being on a rollercoaster, 
and the only way to keep the product on the rails is to use empirical, 
cost-efficient strategy techniques.
As a UX strategist, I am paid to help my clients face dilemmas and 
chase dreams. This is why solid problem-solving skills are absolutely 
critical to mastering UX strategy. Strategy goes beyond the abstract 
nature of design and into the land of critical thinking. Critical think-
ing is disciplined thinking that is clear, rational, open-minded, and 
informed by evidence.** Product stakeholders and entrepreneurs use 
the critical thinking in a UX strategy to help them connect the dots 
among all the points—the customers, their needs, and the solution 
they all want to solve using technology.
It is in this way that UX strategists need to be equally passionate about 
technology, because the Internet continues to offer consumers an end-
less supply of digital options. Every click, swipe, and hover is a decision 
that users are able to make. They have choices—a gazillion of them—to

buy or not buy, like or deride, share or forget, complete or cancel. You 
need to know what features to offer and how people actually use them. 
You need to understand all of the latest and upcoming devices, plat-
forms, and apps so that you can consider their application for your solu-
tions. You and your team need to do everything you can to ensure that 
Alice will fall down the rabbit hole and into Wonderland.

The Four Tenets of UX Strategy
“In war, let your great object be victory, not lengthy campaigns.”
—SUN TZU, ART OF WAR*
A stellar UX strategy is a means to achieving disruption in 
the marketplace through mental-model innovation. And to keep me 
from forgetting this, I have the sticker shown in Figure 2-1 on my lap-
top lid.

12  |   UX STRATEGY
Because what’s the point in spending time and energy crafting a digital 
product that isn’t unique? Or, at the very least, is a much better alterna-
tive to current solutions found in the online marketplace?
To achieve that disruption, we need a framework in which to connect 
all the dots that will build a cohesive UX strategy. In this chapter, I’m 
going to break down the most important tenets that you need to under-
stand in order to successfully implement the tools and techniques in 
this book. Think of it as a primer to get you and your team thinking 
like a UX strategist.
How I Discovered My UX Strategy Framework
In the digital world, strategy usually begins in the discovery phase. This 
is when teams dig deep into research to reveal key information about 
the product they want to build. I’ve always liked to think of the discov-
ery phase as similar to the pretrial discovery process used by attorneys 
in the United States. To avoid a “trial by ambush,” lawyers can request 
to see the evidence of the opposing counsel in order to prepare suffi-
cient counter-evidence. In this way, the attorneys try to avoid surprises, 
and you, as a product maker, should also want to strategically do just 
that.
My first chance to practice UX strategy occurred in 2007. At the time, 
I was the UX lead at Schematic (now Possible) for the website redesign 
of Oprah.com. Along with the other team leads, I flew into Chicago to 
kick off our discovery phase.
Before that moment, my 15 years of professional experience focused 
on interface design and integrating new technologies (such as Flash) 
into interfaces to create “cutting-edge” products. Often, I was handed 
a massive requirements document that listed hundreds of “essential” 
features. Or, I was given a flimsy project brief with pretty comps that 
stated what the final product should accomplish. From there, I made 
a site or application map that catered to a specific set of user scenar-
ios that enabled those interactions. Based on these documents, I could 
only infer whether my creation solved the problem or not because it 
was typically too late at that point to challenge the rationale behind the 
product vision. I was just supposed to design it on time and on budget.

 2. The Four Tenets of UX Strategy   |  13
But in 2007, it was so fascinating to watch our UX director, Mark Sloan, 
get a dozen contentious stakeholders—no, Oprah wasn’t there—on the 
same page. Mark used consensus-building techniques such as affin-
ity maps, dot voting, and forced ranking† to help us understand all the 
different parts—content and critical functionality—that would make 
up the system we had to digitize. This discovery opportunity helped us 
(the stakeholders and product team) in examining our goals to make 
a better platform for the millions of devoted Oprah fans in the world.
One week later, after all the workshops, the product team and I pre-
sented the discovery brief defining the product vision. The brief con-
tained typical deliverables such as user personas, concept map analy-
ses, and a recommended feature list. Because the stakeholders were 
anxious to get started, they immediately approved it. Our digital team 
was off and running on the implementation phase, which took over six 
months of emotionally fueled hand-offs. There were hundreds of pages 
of wireframes and functional specifications traded between stakehold-
ers, designers, and developers.
But the discovery brief was never referenced again. The personas and 
proposed solution were never validated by existing customers. The 
stakeholders went back to fighting for whatever prime real estate they 
could grab for their particular business units. Yet, there was something 
good that came out of that discovery phase for me: I was a UX designer 
who finally got a taste of what a UX strategy could potentially be. I was 
ruined. I couldn’t imagine just being a wireframe monkey anymore.
A full year later, the redesigned site launched. I never looked at it 
because I had moved onto to another interactive agency (HUGE) with 
other high-profile clients. In my new position, I was able to focus my 
energy more directly on the discovery phase of projects in which user 
research and business strategy were given more weight. I also had a 
seat at the table to help shape the UX strategy and decide how a product 
vision should be implemented. I no longer had to feel fraudulent for 
spending so many waking hours building products for which I lacked a 
deep understanding of the customer segment and the business model.

Rulebreakers, and Changemakers. O’Reilly, 2010.

14  |   UX STRATEGY
Today, I run my own practice that specializes in UX strategy, and since 
my first discovery phase, I’ve learned a lot about how to make it an itera-
tive, lightweight, and empirical process of intense collaboration among 
stakeholders, designers, developers, and so on. Because when every-
one shares a product vision, you and your team really have a chance at 
changing the rules of the game for your product, company, and future 
customers.
However, I do want to acknowledge that my methodology is my version 
of UX strategy and might be different from other strategists’. That’s 
precisely why I included Chapter 10, which contains profiles of peo-
ple I respect who have been practicing UX strategy and design as well. 
However, you’ll also see that we align on a lot of things. That’s what 
happens when a new discipline or methodology arises: people will find 
their own approach, but even within those differences, there are con-
nective tissues that bind them together to make UX strategy identifi-
able and unique.
So, with all that said, cue the drum roll to introduce my UX strategy 
framework, as presented in Figure 2-2.
FIGURE 2-2
The four tenets of UX strategy represented as plates at the dinner table

 2. The Four Tenets of UX Strategy   |  15
My formula is this: UX Strategy = Business Strategy + Value Innovation 
+ Validated User Research + Killer UX Design.
These are the four tenets that make up my framework. I have seen 
them in play every day since my first discovery phase. It’s not enough 
to understand your marketplace if you don’t talk directly to your cus-
tomers. It’s not enough to validate that your product works if you’re not 
creating something unique. Good enough just isn’t good enough, and 
just identifying these tenets won’t be enough to get your team flying. 
You’ll need to understand how they interact and affect one another. 
Then, the real trick will be to keep all four of these tenet “plates” spin-
ning in the air while you move through the techniques and tools in the 
subsequent chapters.
Lessons Learned
•	 The discovery phase is where UX strategy begins. UX strategy is 
based on four tenets: business strategy, value innovation, vali-
dated user research, and killer UX design.
•	 The output of the discovery phase should be based on empirical 
data, such as getting direct input from target users before going 
straight from an idea to wireframes and development.
•	 How a team executes a discovery phase can be the deciding 
factor between how a product will ultimately deliver real value 
through a killer UX and create real value for the stakeholders. 
Tenet 1: Business Strategy
Business strategy is the top-line vision of the company. It is why the 
company exists. It ensures the long-term growth and sustainability of 
the organization. It is the basis for the core competencies and offerings, 
which are the products. In this book, I will use the term “products” to 
refer to both digital products and digital services.
The business strategy is what gives product makers the direction to 
grow in the marketplace while beating the competition. The business 
strategy identifies the company’s guiding principles for how it will 
position itself and still achieve its objectives. For this to happen, the 

16  |   UX STRATEGY
business must continually identify and utilize a competitive advan-
tage. A competitive advantage is essential to the company’s long-term 
existence.
In his classic book, Competitive Advantage,‡ Michael E. Porter lays out 
the two most common ways to achieve a competitive advantage: cost 
leadership and differentiation.
The advantage behind cost leadership comes from offering the lowest 
price for products in a particular industry. Whether it is the cheapest 
car, television, or hamburger, this was the traditional way that compa-
nies achieved dominance in the marketplace. After all, allowing the 
private sector to compete without government regulation is what free 
market economy is all about! I mean, look at the rampant success of 
stores such as Walmart and Target. They can offer consumers the best 
prices and widest selection of merchandise. But what happens when 
prices hit rock bottom? Then, the battle needs to be about what makes 
the product better.
This brings us to Porter’s second type of competitive advantage: dif-
ferentiation. Because we are product inventors planning to build dis-
ruptive technologies, this is where our actual power lies. With dif-
ferentiation, the advantage is based on a new or unique product or a 
unique aspect of the product for which customers will pay a premium 
because of its perceived value. As consumers, we choose one product 
over another based on the things we personally value, ranging from the 
product’s usefulness to how much pleasure we derive from it. That per-
ceived value is what transforms a simple little café and cup o’ joe into 
the crazy success story of Seattle-based Starbucks. There’s a reason why 
people pay $5 for a cafe latté—it’s the experience that’s also wrapped 
into the product. It starts the moment a customer steps into the store 
and ends when that person tosses his cup and sleeve into the trash.
Today, a UX differentiation is the digital-product game changer. 
Differentiated user experiences have completely revolutionized the 
way we communicate with the world. Consider what the world was 
like before microblogging. When it was released in 2006, Twitter con-
founded users with its 140-character limit. But the limit turned out 
to be a valuable perk, especially with respect to updates. Today, users

don’t check traditional news outlets for instant updates; they instead 
check Twitter. When Hurricane Sandy pounded the East Coast in 2012, 
the power went out, but more than 20 million Tweets occurred among 
users, residents in the storm, and media and government outlets.§ I 
know I spent some time on Twitter, tweeting to friends in New York 
about the hurricane updates I saw on TV from my home on the West 
Coast.
Another tool that has distinguished itself from the competition with a 
UX differentiation is the map app Waze. It combines social traffic with 
GPS navigation, thereby allowing users to find the quickest route of 
the moment to their destination. By merely driving around with Waze 
open, users passively contribute traffic and other road data to the net-
work. Users also can take a more active role by sharing road reports 
on accidents, police traps, or any other hazards along the way, helping 
to give other users in the area a heads-up about what surprises might 
ahead of them. In June of 2013, Waze (an Israeli startup) was acquired 
by Google for $1.1 billion. Now, Waze still offers its distinct UX to its 
users, but its data is also channeled into Google Maps.¶ Clearly, Google 
recognized the competitive advantage of UX collaboration and chose 
to adopt Waze for what it could add to its product rather than compete 
against it.
A UX competitive advantage is important to understand in this brave 
new world of technology. Traditionally, the purpose of a competitive 
advantage was to make a product that was self-sufficient through a rev-
enue stream. A revenue stream is how the company gets paid. And 
when a customer pays more for the product than what it costs to make, 
value is created for the stakeholders. To many people, this is the heart 
of a product’s business model. Today, though, a UX differentiation 
doesn’t necessarily mean big bucks when your product hits the market. 
Instead, the goal of many entrepreneurs is mass adoption. Products 
such as Facebook didn’t kick the collective asses of competitors like 
MySpace or Friendster’s because it was a cheaper alternative. Facebook 
won the field because, a) it offered a differentiated UX that was per-
ceived by users as more valuable, and b) everyone adopted it. From that

point, Facebook innovated a new kind of business model that relied 
on monetizing its user data for selling targeted advertising.** In 2013, 
Waze did a similar thing when Google bought it. Waze made a lot of 
money by selling access to its devoted users, and Google will make a 
lot of money because so many users continue to use both the Waze and 
Google Maps apps. The two companies essentially turned their users 
into customers because they were able to monetize them, and because 
of this, from here on out, I am going to use the terms “user” and “cus-
tomer” interchangeably.
Still, a good business model doesn’t just define the revenue stream of a 
product. Nor does it just rely on a ridiculous number of users adopting 
it. This is something often lost on young tech entrepreneurs. Because 
they grew up in a world in which products like Facebook became sol-
vent and conquered the world without an obvious business model, they 
don’t realize what an uphill battle they have ahead of them to acquire 
users. They also forget that the megasuccessful digital products that 
continue to define our everyday lives didn’t just stumble onto their 
business models. These game-changing companies experimented, 
tested, and failed before they hit on and innovated the right one. And 
if, like me, you worked on the Web when the dot-com bubble burst in 
the 1990s, you have firsthand experience of all of the risks involved in 
creating products without proven business models. When the invest-
ment money runs out, and there isn’t any more coming in, life is bleak.
The process of business-model construction is foundational to a busi-
ness strategy. As Steve Blank writes, a business model describes the 
“flow between key components of the company.”†† This quote comes 
from Blank’s Customer Development manifesto, in which he chal-
lenges product founders to stop writing static business plans. Instead, 
he encourages them to adopt a flexible business model that requires all 
of the key components to be validated using empirical, customer-facing 
discovery methods. To get a sense of these key components, let’s take a 
look at a tool called the Business Model Canvas.

 2. The Four Tenets of UX Strategy   |  19
In their seminal book Business Model Generation,‡‡ authors Alexander 
Osterwalder and Yves Pigneur deconstruct each of the nine essential 
building blocks of a business model so that visionaries can system-
atically think through the logic of how the company will eventually 
make money. Blank also refers to this tool in his own work on busi-
ness-model creation. What’s relevant to us in this book is how many 
of these components align with the UX strategy for a digital product. 
They are as follows (see also Figure 2-3):
Customer segments
Who are the customers? What are their behaviors? What are their 
needs and goals?
Value propositions
What value (either qualitative or quantitative) do we promise to 
deliver?
Channels
How will we reach our customer segment? Is it online or offline?
Customer relationships
How are we going to acquire and retain our customers?
Revenue streams
How does the business earn revenue from the value proposition? 
Are the customers going to pay for it? Or are there other options?
Key resources
What unique strategic assets must the business have to make the 
product work? Is it content, capital, or patents? Is this something 
we must develop?
Key activities
What uniquely strategic things does the business do to deliver its 
proposition? Are we optimizing an outdated business process? Are 
we creating a platform to bring customers together to transact?
Key partnerships
What partnerships and suppliers do we need in order to deliver our 
value proposition?

20  |   UX STRATEGY
Cost structure
What are the major costs that will be incurred to make our busi-
ness model work? Are we trying to cut costs by throwing out the 
thrills? Are there fixed costs that won’t go away?
FIGURE 2-3
Business Model Canvas showing the nine essential building blocks of a 
business model
By using the canvas, product makers collect all their hypotheses about 
their product into one place. They then revise it as they move through 
the discovery phase, and it’s something you’ll see as we develop all the 
techniques in this book. For this tenet, however, it is another place in 
which we can see how business strategy and UX strategy really inter-
sect. So many of the concerns of the Business Model Canvas—cus-
tomer segments, value propositions, revenue streams, and customer 
acquisition and retention—are elements that are essential to creating a 
product’s user experience, which as you’ve learned, is key to our com-
petitive advantage.
When you don’t see these connections, you can potentially end up in 
the same position as our software engineer in Chapter 1. His business 
model relied on an affluent customer segment to provide the company’s 

 2. The Four Tenets of UX Strategy   |  21
revenue stream, but he had not correctly identified that segment before 
he built his product. If he had not come in contact with that user during 
my team’s customer discovery, he might have pushed ahead with a 
lengthy and expensive campaign to blitz media and online advertising 
outlets. This, as my team’s UX strategy proved, would have been very 
problematic because the campaigns wouldn’t have reached out to the 
user segment actually interested in the value proposition.
This leads us to how the Business Model Canvas also calls out the 
importance of collaboration among stakeholders and team members in 
the discovery phase. Categories such as key resources and partnerships 
aren’t something that a digital product manager or UX designer should 
think up in a vacuum. Rather, these categories are where the stakehold-
ers can offer a wealth of information and leads. Other categories, such 
as key activities, customer segments, and value propositions, will more 
likely rely on the guidance of the digital team to lead the stakeholders to 
the best product. But the digital product team must also recognize that 
these same categories need input from actual users before a hypothe-
sis can be changed to a fact, which is what our UX strategy research 
demonstrated to the software engineer.
We need to recognize that building a business strategy isn’t about for-
mulating and executing a perfect plan. Instead, it’s about being able to 
research what’s out there, analyze the opportunities, run structured 
experiments, fail, learn, and iterate until we devise something of value 
that people truly want. Also, as the product scales and the market 
evolves, the business strategy must be nimble. For a new product, a 
strategy probably revolves around just getting enough product/market 
fit to raise financing, or grabbing enough market share so that its cus-
tomer base is the competitive advantage. But, for a more mature com-
pany, the strategy is about building out the company’s core value prop-
osition while trying to keep the company’s infrastructure and internal 
processes in place. It is in this way that what might have been the busi-
ness model or competitive advantage in the early life cycle of the prod-
uct might not be the same in later phases. Nevertheless, in chasing this 
moving target, companies must continue to experiment with varied 
offerings so that they can scale, remain competitive, and continue to 
offer value to users in an ever-changing marketplace.

Tenet 2: Value Innovation
As digital product inventors, we must be hyperaware of all the chang-
ing digital market dynamics. We must understand how and why people 
use their digital devices and what defines a successful and a failed UX. 
This is because a user’s first contact with the interface generally deter-
mines success or failure. It provides the user with their first impression 
of your value innovation, and it is value innovation that disrupts or cre-
ates new mental models for people. We definitely want to do that.
Before we dig into value innovation, let’s discuss the word “value.” 
The word is used everywhere. It’s found in almost all traditional and 
contemporary business books since the 1970s. In Management: Tasks, 
Responsibilities, Practices,§§ Peter Drucker discusses how customer val-
ues shift over time. He gives an example of how a teenage girl will buy 
a shoe for its fashion, but when she becomes a working mother, she 
will probably buy a shoe for its comfort and price. In 1984, Michael 
Lanning first coined the term “value proposition” to explain how a firm 
proposes to deliver a valuable customer experience. For a business to 
generate wealth, it needs to offer a superior product to that of its com-
petitors but at a manufacturing cost below what customers pay for it. 
That same year, Michael Porter defined the term “value chain” as the 
chain of activities that a firm operating in a specific industry performs 
in order to deliver a valuable product. Figure 2-4 illustrates a traditional 
value chain for a physical product manufacturer.
FIGURE 2-4
The value chain
That is the business process that Toyota uses to make vehicles and that 
Apple uses to make computers and devices. During each of the activ-
ities in this value chain of events, opportunities exist for firms to out-
perform their competitors. But, all those terms apply to physical prod-
ucts. By contrast, virtual products allow for a value chain to have faster 
repeat loops and in some cases for the activities to happen in parallel. 
§§	  Drucker, Peter. Management: Tasks, Responsibilities, Practices. HarperBusiness, 1973.

 2. The Four Tenets of UX Strategy   |  23
This is part of why traditional business-strategy principles do not per-
fectly map to digital product strategy. When producing digital prod-
ucts, we must continuously research, redesign, and remarket to keep 
up with the rapidly evolving online marketplace, customer values, and 
value chains that are required to keep our products in production.
This brings us to another challenge of designing digital products: the 
software, apps, and other things that users find on the Internet and use 
every day. As mentioned, a product needs to be valuable to customers 
to entice them use it. It also needs to be valuable to the business so that 
the business can sustain itself. However, the Internet is full of digital 
products for which the users don’t have to pay for the privilege of using 
them. If a business model is supposed to help a company achieve sus-
tainability, how can you do that when the online marketplace is over-
run with free products?
Value innovation is the key. In the book Blue Ocean Strategy,¶¶ authors 
W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne describe value innovation as “the 
simultaneous pursuit of differentiation and low cost, creating a leap 
in value for both buyers and the company.” What this means is that 
value innovation occurs when companies align newness with utility 
and price (see Figure 2-5). Companies pursue both differentiation and 
cost leadership to create high-value and low-cost products for the cus-
tomers and stakeholders. Consider how Waze found a sustainable busi-
ness model—sharing its crowd-sourced data made it lucrative to other 
companies such as Google. Yet, to get the data, it had to provide a new 
kind of value to customers for mass adoption, and that value was based 
entirely on taking advantage of a disruptive innovation through the UX 
and business model.

Press, 2005.

24  |   UX STRATEGY
Disruptive innovation is a term that was coined by Clayton M. 
Christensen in the mid-1990s. In his book The Innovator’s Dilemma, 
he analyzed the value chain of high-tech companies and drew a dis-
tinction between those just doing sustaining innovation versus disrup-
tive innovation. A sustaining innovation he described as any innova-
tion that enables industry leaders to do something better for their exist-
ing customers.*** A disruptive innovation is a product that a compa-
ny’s best customer potentially can’t use and therefore has substantially 
lower profit margins than the business might be willing to support. 
However, this is where disruptive innovation can blindside established 
competitors. Christensen says that disruptive innovation usually is 
“a process by which a product or service takes root initially in simple 
applications at the bottom of a market and then relentlessly moves up 
market, eventually displacing established competitors.”†††
Innovative means doing something that is new, original, and important 
enough to shake up a market, and this leads us right back to the book 
Blue Ocean Strategy. In the book, the authors discuss their studies of 
150 strategic moves spanning more than a 100 years and 30 industries. 
They explain how the companies behind the Ford Model T, Cirque du 
Soleil, and the iPod won because of how they entered blue-ocean mar-
kets instead of red-ocean markets. The sea of other competitors with 
similar products is known as a red ocean. Red oceans are full of sharks 
that compete for the same customer by offering lower prices and even-
tually turning a product into a commodity. In contrast, a blue ocean is 
uncontested territory; it is free for the taking.

In the corporate world, the impulse to compete by destroying your 
rivals is rooted in military strategy. In war, the fight typically plays out 
over a specific terrain. The battle gets bloody when one side wants what 
the other side has—whether it be oil, land, shelf space, or eyeballs. In 
a blue ocean, the opportunity is not constrained by traditional bound-
aries. It’s about breaking a few rules that aren’t quite rules yet or even 
inventing your own game that creates an uncontested new marketplace 
and space for users to roam.
When we transpose Blue Ocean Strategy to the world of digital prod-
ucts, we must admit that there are bigger opportunities in unknown 
market spaces. A perfect example of a company that took advantage of a 
blue-ocean market is Airbnb. Airbnb is a “community marketplace” for 
people to list, discover, and book sublets of practically anything from a 
tree house in Los Angeles to a castle in France. What’s amazing about 
this is that its value proposition has completely disrupted the travel and 
housing industry (see Figure 2-6).‡‡‡ Its value proposition is so addic-
tive that as soon as customers try it, it’s hard to go back to the old way 
of booking a place to stay or subletting a property.
FIGURE 2-6
Airbnb in the news
Airbnb achieves this value innovation by coupling a killer UX design 
with a tantalizing value proposition. And, as I mentioned earlier, true 
value innovation occurs when the UX and business model intersect. In 
this case, they intersected in a blue ocean because of how Airbnb broke 
and reinvented some rules.

26  |   UX STRATEGY
For example, Craig’s List was a primary means for users to sublet before 
Airbnb, but it was a generally creepy endeavor. There were no user pro-
files. There was no way to verify anything about the host or guest in the 
transaction. Yet, that was the norm! Airbnb enabled a free-market sub-
economy in which quality and trust were given high value in the UX, 
much like in Amazon, Yelp, and eBay. Airbnb’s entire UX was built 
around the idea of ensuring that each guest and host was a good cus-
tomer. It required its users to change their mental models. Formerly 
unwritten social etiquette now had to come into play if users were to 
host strangers or stay in a stranger’s home and for both parties to feel 
good about it.
For instance, I just came back from a weekend in San Francisco with 
my family. Instead of booking a hotel that would have cost us upward of 
$1,200 (two rooms for two nights at a 3.5 star hotel), we used Airbnb and 
spent half of that. For us, though, it wasn’t just about saving money. It 
was about being in a gorgeous and spacious two-bedroom home closer 
to the locals and their foodie restaurants. The six percent§§§ commis-
sion fee we paid to Airbnb was negligible. Interestingly, the corporate 
lawyer who owned this San Francisco home was off in Paris with her 
family. She was also staying at an Airbnb, which could have been paid 
for using some of the revenue ($550-plus) from her transaction with 
us. Everybody won! Except, of course, the hotels that lost our business. 
Airbnb’s business strategy is that they cater to both sides of their two-
sided market—the people who list their homes and those who book 
places to stay. They offer incredible value through feature sets like easy 
calendaring tools, map integration for browsing, and, most crucially, a 
seamless transactional system that had not been previously offered by 
other competitiors like VRBO, Homeaway, or Craig’s List. Ultimately 
Airbnb offered a more usable platform that minimized the risk of deal-
ing with scary people coupled with fair-market value pricing. All of this 
added up to serious disruption through value innovation for all custom-
ers and stakeholders in the online and offline experience. That’s why it 
is winning so decisively.

There are many other products causing widespread disruption to the 
status quo through their combined value innovation of cost leadership 
and differentiation in blue-ocean marketplaces. And through their 
UX strategies, they are ultimately making people’s lives easier, bring-
ing together customers in new ways and smashing mental models. 
Companies such as Airbnb, Kickstarter, and Eventbrite have completely 
upended how people rent homes, fund business ventures, and organize 
events, respectively. In fact, Eventbrite is how I tested my hypothesis 
that there were people out there with a thirst for knowledge about UX 
strategy. Using its interface, I quickly set up a 60-seat lecture at the 
price of $40 per person, and sold it out. If I didn’t have Eventbrite to 
experiment with as a promotional platform, there might have been no 
book for Jaime Levy. Thank you Eventbrite for enabling the one value 
innovation that other platforms like Meetup failed to offer: the ability 
to host paid ticketed events.
Tenet 3: Validated User Research
Not realizing a product’s value is one of the primary reasons why that 
product will fail. Stakeholders are dreamers in that they assume what 
is valuable to their customers instead of verifying it. Much like Kevin 
Costner in the movie Field of Dreams, these entrepreneurs believe that 
if they build it, they [the users] will come. But the truth is that any 
product is a risk. Remember our software engineer at the beginning of 
this book? His assumptions about what his customers wanted turned 
out to be wrong. His heart was in the right place. His idea was timely, 
different, very innovative, and even had a unique and sustainable busi-
ness model. Nonetheless, the users didn’t come. And when my team 
eventually went out and asked his target users, we discovered that they 
wouldn’t pay for the product as it was being positioned.
User research is how you verify that you’re on the right track with your 
value proposition. There are lots of ways to do it—ethnographic field 
studies, contextual inquiries, focus groups, diaries and journals, card 
sorting, eye-tracking, personas, and more. I don’t want to talk about 
any of these traditional methods. Instead, I want to talk about Lean 
Startup.

28  |   UX STRATEGY
It’s weird to admit, but before 2011 when Eric Ries’ Lean Startup¶¶¶ 
(which you must read) went critical mass, founders didn’t make it 
their mission to confront customers “early and often.” The empiri-
cal, fast-moving, and transparent nature of Lean Startup riffed on 
ideas from Steve Blank’s customer development methodology**** and 
the highly theoretical Design Thinking approach. Sure, organizations 
had UX designers around to do “user-centric” design (as opposed to 
engineer-centric), but Lean Startup made conducting validated user 
research a make-or-break aspect of moving forward on a product. Lean 
Startup forced user research to become measurable.
This leads us to our third tenet—validated user research. “Validation” 
is the secret sauce of the Lean Startup business approach. Validation 
is the process of confirming that a specific customer segment finds 
value in your product. Without validation, you are simply assuming that 
customers will find use for your product. Validated user research goes 
beyond just observing and establishing empathy for potential users. 
It is a process based on a reality-check that focuses on direct feedback 
from interaction with users. It helps your team to determine if the 
vision of your product is a dream or a potential nightmare.
Eric Ries popularized the term Minimum Viable Product (MVP). It 
simply means learning if potential customers want your product by 
building just the core features of your value proposition. This is far dif-
ferent from traditional product development in which building a proto-
type was often a simulation to show potential investors the future prod-
uct. By getting customer buy-in on your value proposition early, you are 
de-risking your product. And if users don’t like what they see, we need 
to either “pivot” to a different customer segment or pivot to a different 
problem that our value proposition can address. 
Iterations like the MVP require your team to conduct research and gain 
validation before developing a solution. It helps verify that your team is 
targeting the right customer (something our startup in Chapter 1 failed 
to do) and not just a general persona. When you’ve validated a spe-
cific pain point that needs addressing, you can continue to add features 
and then test those features using the same research methods. This is

 2. The Four Tenets of UX Strategy   |  29
known as the Lean Startup feedback loop of build-measure-learn. Use 
your research to validate your decisions and ensure that the product 
vision is aligned with the end user’s needs. 
Validated user research is a collaborative process that should involve 
as many members of the product team as possible. Collaboration will 
actually help organically build consensus on the value proposition and 
any pivots that follow. Now, this might sound naïve, given that we are all 
working in different environments with a range of folks with dynamic 
personalities who are in various positions of power. In an enterprise 
environment, there are typically many stakeholders who each have a 
say on the product requirements based on their personal agenda or 
preference. When I work for agencies, the product requirements are 
typically locked in stone during a requirements-gathering phase that 
I’m not involved in. For me to suggest doing validated user research or 
creating an MVP to test during the design phase is blasphemy because 
it’s counterintuitive to the agency model. The last thing an account 
executive wants to hear from his UX resources are ways to cut the proj-
ect fee down for his client.
If you happen to find yourself in this familiar position, that’s the exact 
moment that you need to become intrapreneurial. Intrapreneurship is 
the act of behaving like an entrepreneur while working within a large 
organization. You need to decide to take the fate of the product into 
your own hands through assertive risk-taking and innovation. Stand 
up and ask for the extra week or two to conduct validated user research. 
If you get a “no” or are too afraid to ask, it’s time to start working off-
hours. The worst thing that can happen is that you will discover some-
thing about yourself and/or start looking for ways to improve your own 
work process.
The bottom line is that confronting your target customers is nonnego-
tiable. We must learn as quickly as possible if the idea we are working on 
is stupid and worthless. We need to have an open mind to experiment 
and to fail. That’s right, we are betting. And the odds are against us. 
In the end, though, this approach is more cost-effective and efficient.

Tenet 4: Killer UX Design
In Lean Entrepreneur†††† Patrick Vlaskovits and Brant Cooper advo-
cate, “If you are doing best practices, you are not innovating.” This is a 
provocative statement, because established interaction design patterns 
help make consistent user experiences. Then again, there is no harm in 
breaking a rule or two through experimentation to make a killer user 
experience.
The “user experience” (UX) is how a human feels when using the inter-
face of a digital product while attempting to accomplish a task or goal. 
Yes, we can say a door handle is an interface and go off the nondigital 
highway into the world of 100 percent physical products. But in prac-
tice, the term “user experience” refers to whether a person has a good 
or bad time trying to utilize a digital product.
Traditionally (if I dare use that word for a discipline barely two decades 
old), UX design is associated with deliverables for development and 
design execution—site maps, wireframes, process/task flows, and 
functional specifications. Recruiters for enterprises and agencies 
identify UX design with the job titles that create these deliverables, 
including interaction designer, information architect, and UX design-
ers. These definitions are used by large enterprises and agencies and 
are pretty much how UX design is currently practiced. Yet, what ulti-
mately happens in this “traditional” system is that the UX designer and 
therefore the UX design are often more focused on the issues of user 
engagement and design rather than customer development and busi-
ness-model generation.
The common problem that many product makers don’t realize is how 
much their UX decisions are tied to customer acquisition. Just think 
about any transactional website or even a simple sign-up process. The 
UX design should be very concerned with barriers to entry, which can 
prevent validated leads who have previously engaged with the product 
from converting to customers. We’ll talk more about this in Chapter 9. 
Interfaces and user flows should be geared toward the desired response 
of the user. It’s all about engagement.

This is what distinguishes a novice UX designer from a killer UX 
designer. Killer UX designers know now to guide the value innovation 
of a product in the following ways:
•	 They work collaboratively with stakeholders and teammates at the 
idea’s inception. Then, the UX designer can be involved in design-
ing structured experiments for validation. These experiments 
need to be focused on how successful the value proposition can 
be communicated to the customer from the moment the customer 
opens the landing page. Using measurable results, design deci-
sions can be made based on real evidence rather than hunches.
•	 They help determine the key moments and features that are abso-
lutely critical to your product. Chapter 6 focuses on tactics for help-
ing you discover value innovations, concentrating on the primary 
utility of the product. We explore techniques such as storyboard-
ing that will weave key experiences together in simple and elegant 
ways. We look at ways to poach and cherry-pick features from both 
competitors and noncompetitors so that we can put them together 
in new ways.
•	 They learn everything about the existing market space to identify 
UX opportunities that can be exploited. This allows your team 
to find ways to create a leap in value by offering something that 
makes peoples lives more efficient. 
•	 They talk directly to potential users or existing power users of the 
product to discover and validate its primary utility with respect to 
the problem that must be solved.
•	 They weave the UX through all touch points—online and offline—
enabling an experience that is frictionless. This is especially rele-
vant in products such as Airbnb and Uber in which the transaction 
begins on the Internet, is fulfilled in the real world, but then loops 
the user back to the interface to write reviews.
You can’t merely “design think” your way to a killer UX design. It’s 
only when the UX is informed by and affects the other three tenets that 
mental models are broken. Disruption erupts!
Over the course of the book, I will discuss several case studies of prod-
ucts that have killer user experiences. These are UX designs that didn’t 
just “happen” through good luck or “genius design.” They’re killer 
through the manifestation of the tenets. It’s only with practice and

mindfulness that we will come to understand the product as a sum of 
both its tangible and intangible parts. The examples include the follow-

These products all got to where they are not by execution of a static 
business plan or a two-week UX discovery phase, but through experi-
ments, failure, and iterations over months and sometimes years. It was 
the insights born out of structured strategic meanderings that blos-
somed into awe-inspiring product interfaces. It’s how the founders 
and teams behind-the-scenes took risks while assembling the building 
blocks of their products’ business models. They fine-tuned their value 
innovation and acquired fervent customers, which led to a competitive 
advantage such that they now swim in a blue ocean.

2.	 A laundry list of features!
3.	 A thoroughly researched game plan for which all possible sce-
narios have been considered and is ready for implementation. No 
need for customer feedback because you are 100 percent certain 
you have nailed it!
4.	 A creative permutation of trending buzzwords that were just 
used by another startup that raised financing (for instance, peer-
to-peer sharing economies).
5.	 A generic set of motivational statements (such as Go Team 
Challenge Conquer).
6.	 An arrogant statement from some expert—“Our product sprung 
from the genius of Professor I.M. Awesome, the visionary of 
Social Lean Disruption.”
7.	 A hypothesis that has nonvalidated risky assumptions—“Well, all 
women do like pink.”
8.	 A grandiose vision that doesn’t align with its core values that 
your company has no capability of delivering (for instance, a pat-
ent-pending, new-method-of-discovery dream).
9.	 A vague affirmation that sounds like a good Hallmark card—“You, 
too, can achieve Social Lean Disruption.”

Recap
UX strategy is a way of thinking. It’s not a means of formulating and 
executing a perfect plan; rather, it’s about being able to research what’s 
out there, analyze the opportunities, run structured experiments, fail, 
learn, and iterate until you devise something of value that people truly 
want. While devising a UX strategy, you will need to take risks and 
accept failure. You’ll learn how to fail smartly by doing small-struc-
tured experiments to validate that your strategy is moving your team in 
the right direction.

Validating the Value Proposition
“To know what a business is we must start with its purpose. Its 
purpose must lie outside of the business itself. In fact, it must lie in 
society since business enterprise is the organ of the society. There is 
only one valid definition of business purpose: to create a customer.”*
—PETER DRUCKER, 1973
At the beginning, you don’t just define your product vision. 
Rather, you first need to figure out what problem you’re going to solve and 
what kind of customer needs it solved the most. That’s a lot to figure out, 
and getting one part wrong could turn your vision into a delusion. So, to 
stay grounded, you’re going to really dig into Tenet 1, Business Strategy, 
and Tenet 3, Validated User Research (see Figure 3-1 and refer to Chapter 
2 if you need a refresher on the four tenets of UX strategy). In this chapter, 
you will learn how to create a value proposition, which is the magical thing 
that you must make tangible for customers. Then, you will go over how to 
validate it through experiments to prove whether that hypothesis is correct.

The Blockbuster Value Proposition
When I was in the eighth grade, I used to pretend I had a stomachache 
so my mom would take me to work with her. She was a legal secre-
tary at Burbank Studios, and I loved wandering the back lots, hiding 
on sets and watching crews shoot television shows and movies. Once, 
I even had a chance to meet Ricardo Montalbán on the set of Fantasy 
Island! The younger me of 1978 just couldn’t imagine a cooler job. And 
that’s why the older me of 2012 was particularly excited when a block-
buster movie producer arranged a meeting with me at a bungalow on 
the same lot. He wanted to consult with me on an idea for a product to 
see if it “had legs.”
FADE IN:
EXT. BUNGALOW – MORNING
The shot starts long and then pans up through the 
window of the bungalow.
CUT TO:

JAIME into the room. The movie producer PAUL is

They shake hands and then settle into their seats.

Busy Man who needs help shopping for his

JAIME
Can you tell me more about this “Busy Man”?

 3. Validating the Value Proposition   |  39
Paul gets really excited. He leans forward and ges-
ticulates a lot while describing the Busy Man to 
Jaime.
PAUL
He’s the guy whose life is his work. He makes 
good money but doesn’t have time to spend it. 
He loves high-end products but hates shop-
ping for them. He’s sick of repeating himself 
to salespeople but still wants to get the VIP 
treatment. 
Jaime leans forward, hands resting on her knees. 
She takes a beat before speaking.
JAIME
That’s very specific. But do you think this 
is a problem for most busy men? Do you think 
they need it solved?
PAUL
Absolutely! I certainly do!
In Los Angeles, it’s easy to run into both Hollywood types who pitch 
movie ideas and tech entrepreneurs who pitch Internet product ideas. 
What’s funny is how similar they are. Both want to create something 
original and compelling that makes lots of money. Both need to raise a 
ton of cash to make their ideas into reality. But, this requires “spinning” 
a good story in order to convince potential stakeholders and investors 
that there is an audience out there who will want the idea.
Most investors know that the odds are not in their favor because the 
market is constantly being inundated with schlock—crappy movies 
and crappy apps. Then again, when something is truly great, the payoff 
can be major. And not just in terms of the money. Having a “hit” is also 
what gives us fulfillment as content and product creators. We want to 
create something that people find useful and meaningful—something 
maybe even our mom will like!
However, there is one major difference between making movies and 
making digital products. With films, regardless of the strategy—cast-
ing big-name actors, sequels to board games, well-worn plots and 

40  |   UX STRATEGY
tropes—there are hardly any opportunities in the process of making 
the film to “de-risk” it through empirical feedback. Sure, filmmakers 
can test early cuts on their target market, but typically at that point, 
reshooting is an unaffordable option. With digital products, you can 
“test market” your concepts on your target audiences much earlier and 
with much less fidelity to the intended idea. You can reality check your 
team and ensure that everyone is on the right path. There is no reason 
to live on Fantasy Island unless you enjoy the risks of big gambling.
Lessons Learned
•	 Just because your stakeholders (or you) really want your prod-
uct, doesn’t mean anybody else will. Most startups fail because 
the market doesn’t necessarily need the product.
•	 You need to ground your stakeholders and team in reality with 
empirical evidence. You must turn assumptions into facts.
•	 Don’t take what your stakeholders or team says at face value. To 
learn what potential customers want, hunt them down in person.
What Is a Value Proposition?
Generally, a value proposition takes the form of a statement and is usu-
ally the first sentence out of the mouth, as it was for my movie producer 
client. Think of it as an elevator pitch—when you distill something 
into a discrete, easy-to-remember, compelling, and repeatable phrase. 
Its primary purpose is to communicate the benefits that the customer 
can expect from your offering. Here are examples of value proposition 
statements for a few well-known products:
•	 Airbnb is a community marketplace for people to list, discover, and 
book unique spaces around the world through the Internet.
•	 Snapchat is the fastest way to share messages, photos, videos, texts, 
and drawings with friends for a limited amount of time.
•	 Waze is a social traffic and navigation app based on the world’s 
largest community of drivers sharing real-time road information 
and contributing to the “common good” while driving.

 3. Validating the Value Proposition   |  41
No matter what environment you work in as a product maker, you are 
constantly getting pitched or pitching value propositions. Before their 
products became household names, just imagine how many times the 
teams at Airbnb, Snapchat, and Waze had to repeat their value proposi-
tion statements with investors until they finally “clicked.”
All this is to say that the little sentence, “It’s like Avatar meets Die 
Hard!” is really important. But, you might be thinking, how hard could 
it be to come up with one? It’s not, actually. In fact, there’s even a web-
site called itsthisforthat.com, which generates random value proposi-
tions as fast as you can click the refresh button. I generated the one 
shown in Figure 3-2.
FIGURE 3-2
A machine-generated value proposition that says “Airbnb for Wedding Venues”
Let’s deconstruct the website’s value proposition formula:
It’s <famous platform or app goes here> for <type of customers or customer 
need goes here>!
The “this” essentially describes the magical powers of the product. The 
“this” for the dating app Tinder is how you can immediately let some-
one know you find them attractive with a swipe interaction. The “this” 
for Waze is how you can find a driving shortcut because other people 
around you have their Waze app open and are providing you with real-
time data to maneuver around traffic jams. The “this” is the mental 
model; it’s how people understand the interactive dynamics of a prod-
uct and how it affects the outcome of how they use it.

42  |   UX STRATEGY
The “that” describes either or both the specific customer segment and 
its need or goal. The “that” for Tinder is people looking for an easier 
way to “hook up” instead of having to fill out a time-consuming dating 
profile. The “that” for Waze is drivers who want to avoid getting stuck 
in traffic even if it means taking routes off the beaten path. The “that” 
clues us in on who might want or need the “this” and why. What this 
formula does is give us a fast way to articulate the solution.
But value propositions are not valuable if they do not solve a real prob-
lem. I’m not talking minor problems like a scraped knee; I’m talking 
about painful broken-leg problems. I’m talking about those problems 
that hinder a certain set of people from doing what they need to do in a 
timely manner. By solving this kind of problem, a solution would give 
relief or joy to this large set of people. You need to know everything 
you can about those problems and people before you build out those 
solutions, because building software takes time and money. Thus, it’s 
a risky endeavor to just begin building a new innovative product based 
on a hunch.
Because what if you are wrong?
Or your boss is wrong?
Or the client is wrong?
Or even the successful movie producer guy is wrong?
Or this digital value proposition that we generated in .05 seconds is 
wrong?
The answer is simple. If the person with the big hunch is wrong and 
your team doesn’t find out until after the money is gone, everyone has 
failed in making something with a true value proposition. Everyone 
involved has only succeeded in wasting their resources. And because 
this is the infancy stage of your product vision, you don’t want to get 
too attached to any ideas—especially without proper validation that real 
customers will really want the solution.
IF YOU DON’T WANT TO LIVE ON FANTASY ISLAND…
Just follow these five steps, which I will walk you through in detail:
Step 1: Define your primary customer segment.
Step 2: Identify your customer segment’s (biggest) problem.

 3. Validating the Value Proposition   |  43
Step 3: Create provisional personas based on your assumptions.
Step 4: Conduct customer discovery to validate or invalidate your solu-
tion’s initial value proposition.
Step 5: Reassess your value proposition based on what you learned!
(Rinse and repeat until you have product/solution fit.)
It’s that easy! We just need to be empirical in our process.
Step 1: Define your primary customer segment
Because you and your team are launching an innovative product, you 
are starting with zero customers. Therefore, if you think your customer 
is everybody, think harder. Otherwise, you’re facing an uphill battle in 
customer acquisition. Which is easier: getting everybody to use your 
app, or getting people who really need it to sign up? Many hit digital 
products have done just that. When Facebook launched, it was exclusive 
to students at Harvard University, not the entire world. Airbnb tested 
out its product on the 2008 Democratic National Convention, and even 
Tinder did its initial pilot project by focusing on college students at the 
University of Southern California.†
The customer is a group or segment of people with a common need 
or pain. Your primary customer’s pain point must be severe, because 
there is a lot of risk involved in trying to change how people do some-
thing in a familiar way to an unfamiliar one in an uncontested market 
space. Examples of customer segments are international college stu-
dents in Los Angeles who have a hard time making friends with native 
students, aspiring musicians in big cities who want practice gigs, or 
busy suburban moms who can’t manage their kids’ schedules. These 
segments can be identified by a combination of demographic and psy-
chographic attributes, but what is most essential is that they describe in 
10 words or fewer a set of people on whom you can zero-in.
So, let’s go back to the computer-generated value proposition and imag-
ine the most obvious primary customer. Who the hell needs to plan a 
wedding on a budget? Hmmm… As Figure 3-3 demonstrates, maybe a 
bride-to-be? Yes, let’s go with it!

FIGURE 3-3

Step 2: Identify your customer segment’s (biggest) problem
The problem should be a specific one that a specific customer seg-
ment is having. Nonetheless, you need to acknowledge that you and 
your team are working solely on assumptions, and that’s just the reality 
of where you begin when making a product. You make assumptions 
about your users, their needs, and how to solve them. You just need to 
be very honest about the assumptions you’re making and to take them 
for what they are: facts people take for granted. Or, as the great Coach 
Buttermaker (Walter Matthau) in the movie Bad News Bears said to his 
baseball team, “When you ‘ASSUME,’ you make an ASS out of U and 
ME.”
At the beginning of the chapter, Paul the movie producer stated that he 
understood his customer’s problem because it was his own: he was a 
busy man with money who didn’t have time to shop. Therefore, all busy 
men needed an online shopping experience to build a high-end custom 
wardrobe. If that logic worked for every value proposition, I could easily 
look at the digital value proposition and say, “When I planned my own 
wedding, I was a bride-to-be on a limited budget, and my biggest pain 
point was finding a wedding venue in Los Angeles that I could afford.” 
Which was true for me, but is it true for every frugal bride-to-be?

 3. Validating the Value Proposition   |  45
This is where you want to write out the customer and problem hypoth-
esis in a statement. Here’s what it could look like:
Brides-to-be in Los Angeles have a hard time finding wedding venues 
that are affordable.
Which, if proven true, would validate an important need for the value 
proposition: 
Airbnb for Finding Wedding Venues.
It would seem, then, that the next logical step would be to start dream-
ing up the entire feature set for this much-needed solution, right? No. 
Not yet.
Remember the software engineer from Chapter 1? He jumped straight 
into building out the solution for his startup. He assumed that cus-
tomers like him (addicts’ loved ones) would be interested in a digital 
platform with which they could negotiate prices with treatment cen-
ters. He also assumed that there would be a lot of customers like this 
or at least enough to help keep the business model afloat. Yet, these 
assumptions were just that: assumptions. He could not pinpoint the 
reason why his product was unsuccessful until my team ran validated 
user-research experiments. The experiments exposed the fallacy to 
him, which was that customers, including those with a decent budget, 
were highly unlikely to book a treatment center over the Internet the 
same way they would book a hotel room. He heard directly from the 
potential customers what he initially didn’t want to believe: booking a 
treatment center was just too much of a highly emotional decision to 
be done entirely online.
Here’s a pro tip:
Don’t build your product’s UX around a value proposition unless you 
have tangible evidence that people will want the product!
If you are a problem solver (which is instinctual for UX designers, prod-
uct makers, and entrepreneurs), this process at first feels backward. 
That’s because it is. We are reverse-engineering the solution to validate 
the assumptions about the customers and their problem. This approach 
is particularly important for those of you who have produced dozens of 

46  |   UX STRATEGY
products, including ones that have been very successful. Don’t believe 
your own hype. Instead, approach every new product or project like an 
experiment.
As I mentioned in the Preface, I’ve been a part-time college professor 
for more than 20 years. I have always run my courses the same way. 
The first week, the students have to think of problems they would like 
to try to solve using technology. Each week, they build toward the final 
course project, which is to pitch a real product that they’ve tested using 
the methods I’m teaching you in this book. In the spring of 2014, I 
offered UX apprenticeships to my students Bita and Ena to take on the 
“Airbnb for Weddings” product vision. I’m going to present their meth-
ods and results to show how you can give any value proposition a real 
shot to see if it is viable. This was their first assignment: the provisional 
persona.
Step 3: Create provisional personas based on your assumptions
Personas can be a helpful tool in giving stakeholders and the product 
team an empathetic sense of what the end user’s needs, goals, and moti-
vations are. In this way, they can make a product more “user-friendly.” 
However, the concept of provisional personas has had a tumultuous 
history with advocates on both sides of the table, so I’m going to give 
you a little lesson on it to explain why I’m using them here and now.
In the early days of software design, the engineers who developed and 
programmed the products were also typically the designers of the prod-
uct interfaces. These product interfaces were rarely “user-friendly,” 
because they were not tested on the end user of the product. Too often, 
interfaces were pasted together in a hurried fashion to meet a shipping 
date.
Alan Cooper, a widely recognized Bay Area software designer and pro-
grammer, knew this problem all too well. In 1988, Cooper created the 
visual programming language that would become Visual Basic, an 
innovation that ultimately enabled an open marketplace for software 
companies that wanted to build applications for Microsoft Windows.‡ 
In 1995, he invented personas and wrote books to help software teams 
to embrace his goal-directed design methodology. Personas were also a 
‡	  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Cooper

 3. Validating the Value Proposition   |  47
critical tool to inspire product stakeholders to make more user-friendly 
interfaces.§ But to achieve this kind of persona, it meant that months 
of qualitative “ethnographic” research had to be conducted to create an 
authentic model of each end user.
By 2002, personas were a popular tool in the designer toolbox, but they 
weren’t often used to achieve their original purpose. Instead, big inter-
active agencies such as Razorfish or Sapient used personas to upsell 
the research/discovery phase to clients. When used in this way, per-
sonas were often laughable caricatures packed full of stereotypical 
details based on nothing more than marketing data. In fact, this is 
what happened with the three personas conducted for the Oprah.com 
redesign I talk about in Chapter 2. The personas that made it to the 
discovery brief were depicted as three people from different minority 
backgrounds but only because Oprah had a massive multiracial follow-
ing. In reality, ethnicity had little to do with the UX of the product. Did 
African-American Oprah fans need a different interface or feature set 
than Caucasian Oprah fans? In this way, the personas failed in inform-
ing the UX strategy process in a basic way, such as when Cooper writes, 
“Don’t confuse persona archetypes with stereotypes. Because perso-
nas provide a precise design target and also serve as a communication 
tool to the development team, the designers must choose a particular 
demographic characteristics with care.”
By the third edition of Cooper’s book About Face in 2007, he added a new 
section called “When Rigorous Personas Aren’t Possible: Provisional 
Personas.”¶ The concept was geared for product makers who did not 
have the time, budgets, or corporate buy-in to perform the fieldwork 
necessary to gather detailed qualitative data. They were a simple collab-
orative group exercise for designers and nondesigners to create quickly. 
In fact, the product designer and author Jeff Gothelf also reintroduced 
them as a Lean UX** technique to help align teams on how they think 
about the customer before doing customer discovery. This is where per-
sonas become useful to you in this book, because a provisional persona 
will be a helpful communication tool to depict your hypothesized cus-
tomer and align your team. It also gives everyone a starting point for

48  |   UX STRATEGY
the validation process. Thus, you can think of a provisional persona as 
a “back-up” or “low budget” persona, which is better than having no 
persona at all. (Also see what the long-time UX executive Peter Merholz 
has to say about profiles in Chapter 10.)
Provisional persona layout and breakdown
The provisional personas will collect and present the assumptions you 
are making about your primary customer segment. Therefore, all infor-
mation will be contextual to the hypothesized customer and relevant to 
the value proposition. Specifics such as demographic details or user 
goals aren’t necessary unless they are essential to the product. Instead, 
you want to focus your personas on what you assume is important to 
customers and how they are currently dealing with the problem.
The provisional persona is made up of these four parts:
Name and snapshot/sketch
What is the customer’s name? What does she look like? If you’re 
going with a certain gender or demographic—in this example, per-
haps a woman in her late 20s or early 30s—search for popular baby 
names of the early 1980s. If you can sketch, draw her. If you have a 
photo of someone who fits the part, just paste it. If not, find a good 
reference photo using Google Images or Flickr.
Description
What factors personally motivate the customer? The description 
should be a composite archetype of the customer that is relevant 
to the product idea rather than a stereotype of psychographic or 
demographic details. For example, your team only cares about the 
customer’s taste in cars if you are solving a problem related to cars.
Behaviors
This category can be answered in several ways. The first is how the 
customer is trying to solve the problem now. Is it via a workaround 
on the Internet? In the real world or a hybrid of both? Is the cus-
tomer tech-savvy enough to use the Internet to solve his problem? 
Is he using social networks to do it? Or are there general behav-
iors for customers who are using similar types of digital products 
that are relevant to your solution? The second is how the person’s 

 3. Validating the Value Proposition   |  49
personality affects his behavior. For example, if the person is pro-
fessionally successful, does that make him a good problem solver? 
Is the customer trusting or skeptical?
Needs and goals
This category explains what motivates the customer and causes her 
to act a certain way. For example, what is she missing from the cur-
rent solution? What specific needs or goals aren’t being satisfied by 
the customer’s current behaviors? What are the deal-breaker issues 
she faces? What are compromising points?
Because you are using the provisional persona purely as a thinking tool 
to get a sense of your primary customer segments, you and your team 
want to keep the layout and content simple. In the provisional personas 
that follow, Bita and Ena use a two-by-two grid with a section for each 
part. They’ve pasted the image of their primary customer in the upper-
left section, and they’ve created five to six bullets in each of the other 
three. Observe how the assumptions about their customers seem rela-
tively easy to prove. You only want statements in your provisional per-
sonas that can be externally verified.
Figure 3-4 shows the provisional persona that Bita did for her first 
homework assignment, for “Airbnb for Weddings.”
FIGURE 3-4
Bita’s provisional persona for a bride-to-be

50  |   UX STRATEGY
Figure 3-5 shows what Ena developed.
FIGURE 3-5
Ena’s provisional persona for a bride-to-be
What’s most telling about the personas is how different the customers 
are even though each student worked on the same value proposition. 
They each assumed the primary customer was a very different kind 
of bride. Bita assumed that her customer was a professional woman 
named Jennifer in her late 20s or early 30s. She earns a decent income 
and is value conscious. Ena, however, assumed that her customer was 
a younger 20-something bride named Stephanie. This younger bride 
is in a very different place in her life than the more established and 
professional Jennifer. This creates more distinctions between the two 
brides. For instance, price is an issue for the younger Stephanie, but 
she wants people to have fun. She’s willing to compromise and not 
have fancy food or that big of a wedding. However, Jennifer is efficient 
and a problem solver. She has high expectations that everything will be 
perfect. She needs a solution that will help her save time and get good 
value.
Which persona is the right one? It doesn’t matter right now, because 
Bita and Ena are just working with assumptions anyway, and what 
they’ve built in the provisional personas are just more assumptions. 
Perhaps in the final product they might be able to suit the needs of 

 3. Validating the Value Proposition   |  51
both personas, but until then, everything in the personas remains an 
assumption until proven true or false. Regardless of who ends up being 
more “correct,” though, the provisional personas helped Bita and Ena 
paint a clearer picture of their hypothesized customers. Now they just 
need to find those customers in real life and see what the brides really 
think!
Step 4: Conduct customer discovery to validate or invalidate  
your solution’s initial value proposition
Customer discovery
In 2005, Steve Blank, a long-time Silicon Valley entrepreneur, pub-
lished The Four Steps to the Epiphany: Successful Strategies for Products 
that Win.†† Although his methodology revolves around four phases, 
I’m going to ruminate on the first one, customer discovery, as part of 
your UX strategy.
Customer discovery is a process used to discover, test, and validate 
whether a specific product solves a known problem for an identifiable 
group of users; it is essentially conducting user research. However, you 
don’t want to just watch people, empathize with them, and then make 
judgments. Instead, you want to “get out of the building” and get cus-
tomer validation, which is foundational to the Lean Startup business 
approach (and Tenet 3). You want to actively listen to people and engage 
them because your goal is to uncover the specific problem that they 
need solved.
This might sound like an obvious thing to do, but shockingly, the 
majority of stakeholders whom I work with in startups and enterprises 
don’t talk to customers. In fact, before Lean Startup, the norm was that 
companies would just build the product without talking them. Much 
like Paul the movie producer, the stakeholders or product team assume 
that if they have the problem or associate with it, this means that they 
understand it. I think the real reason stakeholders don’t talk to custom-
ers is fear. Product visionaries are like screenwriters sweating away at 
a script that they never show anyone. They’re frightened of what their 
real customers might think—nobody wants to hear that their baby is 
ugly.

52  |   UX STRATEGY
In an ideal world, customer discovery is a collaborative process involv-
ing as many members of the product team going out into the field as 
possible. Collaboration will also help organically build consensus on 
what exactly the vision is for the product. If the people you work with 
don’t want to do customer research, do it for yourself. Do it on the sly 
without waiting for permission from your boss, the client, or any nay-
sayers. What is crucial is that it is attempted. You can come back from 
your research and share your discoveries anecdotally with your team. If 
nobody wants to listen, you can decide at that point if you want to con-
tinue working on that project or with your current team, or with your 
current employer. But at least get out there and discover evidence that 
might make your product better in the time that you have to work on 
it. Own your destiny.
We’ve already touched on some reasons why product makers become 
very protective of their ideas. They put a lot of energy and love into 
them. If you’re a UX designer, you know exactly what I’m talking about. 
Clients such as Paul typically come to you with an idea for the product 
that they want to build. They’ve assumed that customers want their 
product. But as I’ve already stated, the UX strategist wants to know 
whether those assumptions are correct. As you’re learning in this 
book, you don’t want to get too attached to any ideas, especially without 
proper validation that real customers want the solution.
Fortunately, Bita and Ena aren’t emotionally attached to the value prop-
osition I generated off the Internet. They just need to validate their ini-
tial assumptions. And that’s exactly what they’re going to do. They’re 
going to get out of the building (office or classroom) to conduct problem 
interviews.
The problem interview
During customer discovery, the goal of the interview is to talk to real 
people. My students have personas, and they need to talk to the people 
who match those personas.
Let’s remember Tenet 3: Validated User Research. You want to use the 
approach of the Lean Startup, which means research should be mean-
ingful, effective, and swift. You want to get into the Build-Measure-
Learn loop as quickly as possible (see Figure 3-6). That loop begins 
with the smallest build of an idea. This build leads to some form of 
data that can measure what the customers say. Based on that, you then 

 3. Validating the Value Proposition   |  53
learn from that feedback about how to make the build better. And at 
this infancy stage of a value proposition, this means getting out of the 
building to validate provisional personas.
FIGURE 3-6
The Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop from the book Lean Startup by Eric Ries
You need to identify two or three nearby locations where you can make 
direct contact with your proposed customers. You can’t hide behind 
your desk. Think creatively about where your customers lurk by focus-
ing on the types of activities they might be doing. If you can’t find them 
in the real world, you need to find them on the Internet (more on that 
in Chapter 8).
In the case of Bita, her provisional persona was of an upper-middle-
class yet value-conscious bride-to-be. Bita decided to hit the malls of 
Los Angeles where she thought she could find people who matched her 
persona. Her first stop was the Westside Pavilion in West Los Angeles. 
This mall had plenty of kids’ clothing stores such as Gymboree and 
Baby Gap where mothers with babies shopped. This was certainly dif-
ferent than what I was thinking, which was that Bita would find women 
in the midst of shopping for wedding gowns.
Bita’s assumption was that these new mothers might give her insight 
about planning a wedding because they probably had a wedding before 
starting their family. And because they had very young children, their 
wedding was most likely recent. Bita dressed professionally and appro-
priately. She carried a notebook on which her questions were written 

54  |   UX STRATEGY
and always approached her targeted customer with a smile and only if 
the timing was right (typically, their baby was asleep in a stroller). This 
was her script: 
Hi, I’m Bita. I’m conducting research on a product idea for an Internet 
startup. Can you spare a few moments to answer questions related to 
wedding planning?
The problem interview is actually made up of two parts: the screener 
and the interview. A screener is a list of questions used to qualify poten-
tial participants for a study. You need these questions because you can-
not assume that every person you approach is in fact the customer you 
need and want to validate your persona assumptions. The screener 
questions will identify the “control group,” on whom we will ultimately 
validate our hypotheses.
Therefore, good screener questions must help you quickly weed out the 
wrong people. They should seem nonintrusive to the participant, but 
you know they are deal-breaker questions. It might be helpful to work 
backward. What are the exact answers you must hear from someone to 
qualify them for this mini-experiment? Sometimes, it takes a few iter-
ations of your screener questions to truly ensure that you are talking to 
the right people. Be okay with fine-tuning your questions on the fly to 
either make them more general or more specific, based on what hap-
pens “in the wild” as you begin talking to people.
Let’s get back to Bita. If the woman she confronted seemed open to 
chatting, Bita immediately launched into her screener questions.
Phase 1: The screener questions
1.	 Were you married within the last few years?
•	 Yes (continue to question 2)
•	 No (kindly end the interview)
2.	 Did you happen to get married here in Los Angeles?
•	 Yes (interview the person)
•	 No (kindly end the interview)

 3. Validating the Value Proposition   |  55
Based on Bita’s persona, the goal of her screener questions is to iden-
tify if the woman she’s interviewing recently planned a wedding in Los 
Angeles. She needed participants with fresh memories about what hap-
pened at their weddings. Also, she needed them to be married in sunny 
Southern California, in which they probably had an outdoor venue like 
a park, beach, or fancy backyard. This detail was crucial to validating 
the Airbnb for Weddings value proposition, because she assumed that 
these outside locations (such as someone’s fancy backyard overlook-
ing the beach) would have solved this potential participant’s wedding 
venue woes.
Phase 2: The interview
If a woman passed the screener test, Bita was able to move on to her 
actual interview questions.
Typically, this is when product makers and tech entrepreneurs like to 
extol the virtues of their awesome value proposition. But, if you just 
start pitching ideas at strangers, they tend to just nod their heads in 
agreement to quickly get the hell away from you. That’s not the vali-
dation you need or want. Remember customer discovery is about lis-
tening and not selling. Let’s take a look at how Bita handled it in her 
interview questions:
1.	 How did you go about planning your wedding?
•	 Prompt for both ceremony and reception locations
•	 Prompt for tools/means, such as Internet, word-of-mouth
2.	 Did you have a budget for venues and were you able to stay within 
that budget? (If not, by how much more?)
3.	How many people were you planning to have at the reception (for 
example, 50 to 200)?
4.	 What were some of the challenges you faced in finding the venues 
(Prompt: e.g., finding the ideal location, such as by the beach)?
5.	How did you overcome these challenges? Did you end up having to 
compromise on your ideal wedding?
These questions actually set up the context for our solution. Now that 
the participant has that context, it’s time for Bita to ask her money-shot 
question. Bita:

56  |   UX STRATEGY
Excellent, thank you so much for all this great feedback. I have two last 
questions for you.
6.	 Have you ever heard of or tried a website called “Airbnb”?
•	 Yes (continue to question 7)
•	 No (quickly explain what value prop is of Airbnb with respect to 
the part about short-term subletting and continue to question 7)
7.	If there were a website, like Airbnb, that gave you a numerous 
choices of gorgeous homes with big backyards in LA that you could 
rent specifically for a wedding event, what do you think?
You end with your money-shot questions, which are when you actu-
ally pitch your hypothetical value proposition. Again, you want to listen 
and not sell. See how open-ended Bita’s questions are? She’s just pull-
ing the trigger on the solution to see what response she gets without 
trying to bias the participant in favor or against it. When you ask the 
money-shot question, just capture the essence of the person’s response 
and, if they apply, ask any relevant follow-up questions. Then that’s it! 
Thank the person profusely and let him go on with his day. Ideally, you 
will try to collect 10 complete interviews from screener to money-shot.
Two-sided markets
Now, it’s time to do a serious reality check about your primary cus-
tomer, because this book is talking about digital products for twen-
ty-first-century consumers. Therefore, you need to think about all of 
your potential customers. Sometimes they are paying customers, and 
sometimes they are customers who use the product for free. As you 
probably already noticed, I use the terms “user” and “customer” inter-
changeably, because users who don’t pay for a product such as Facebook 
or YouTube are still customers. Facebook and YouTube need buy-in 
from these nonpaying customers so that paying customers—advertis-
ers—will want to engage with the product. All this is to say that some-
times you only have one primary customer segment for which you need 
to validate a UX. Here are some examples:
•	 A video-streaming website such as Netflix needs movie viewers.
•	 An online publication such as the New York Times needs news 
readers.
•	 A financial website such as Citibank needs customers with bank 
accounts.

 3. Validating the Value Proposition   |  57
But, what if you need two distinct user types for your product to have 
value? Two-sided markets are what make the Internet go around. They 
drastically affect the UX strategy because they require two distinct 
user experiences—one for each customer segment—to be validated 
and created. eBay has buyers and sellers. Airbnb has hosts and guests. 
Eventbrite has event producers and event attendees. These digital prod-
ucts are insanely good at providing value to both of these customer seg-
ments through their feature sets, and that’s something that you might 
also need to do.
The real Airbnb is a digital platform that facilitates one set of customers 
(hosts) subletting their properties to another set of customers (guests). 
Airbnb then collects a small percentage of the transaction from both 
“sides.” Bita and Ena’s value proposition is based on Airbnb’s innova-
tive business model, which is based on the peer-to-peer sharing econ-
omy. For them to solve the problem of helping brides find an affordable 
venue for weddings, they must match them up with the other side of 
the market: people who are willing to rent their homes out for a wed-
ding event.
Ena realized this during her customer discovery. Consequently, she 
took a step back and created a provisional persona of her other primary 
customer, which you can see in Figure 3-7.
FIGURE 3-7
Ena’s provisional persona for a wedding venue host

58  |   UX STRATEGY
This is the customer segment that also must exist to make her value 
proposition work. Ena needs people like John and Susan: people who 
own nice homes in Malibu and are open to innovative solutions for tak-
ing advantage of their home’s value. They are probably older than our 
brides-to-be and quite concerned that their homes don’t get trashed, or 
so Ena’s persona assumes.
I asked Ena how she planned to validate this provisional persona. 
Where would she find people of this type? Would she knock on big 
fancy doors of homes by the beach? Good luck. Maybe she could ask 
people who were shopping at the high-end grocery store in Malibu if 
they would rent their home? I was concerned that she was chasing a 
persona that wouldn’t be easy to verify. So I sent her out to do more 
customer discovery.
The following week Ena came back with some pretty cool validation, 
which is shown in Figure 3-8. She had put on her bride-to-be hat and 
contacted some real hosts on the real Airbnb. She asked them if they 
would consider renting their homes out for a wedding event. She even 
asked how much they might charge. As it turns out, people are already 
doing this.
FIGURE 3-8
Example of a positive response from hosts on Airbnb for Ena’s inquiry about 
renting their home for a wedding
Hosts on Airbnb were already bending the system. They were creating 
pricing packages totally separate from the Airbnb business model and 
UX, and the responses showed Ena how familiar hosts were with wed-
ding inquiries. So, how did this information affect Ena’s value propo-
sition? Let’s find out!

 3. Validating the Value Proposition   |  59
Step 5: Reassess your value proposition based on what you 
learned! (And continue to iterate until you have  
product/market fit.)
As you can see, conducting validated user researcher does not need to 
be costly or time-consuming. For Bita, it cost her one Saturday to val-
idate whether her assumptions were right, which she then compiled 
into the results shown in Figure 3-9.
FIGURE 3-9
Bita’s customer discovery results
Yes, she only talked to 10 people who passed her screener questions, 
but she found that 9 of them had a huge problem finding an affordable 
venue. Obviously, the value proposition’s hypothetical problem was 
real. However, she also learned about how much those people spent 
on their weddings and how many people they invited. This knowledge 
affected how she thought about her value proposition because it meant 
the detail of venue size was actually more important than she origi-
nally assumed. It made her question whether there were homes large 
enough in Los Angeles to accommodate the needs of her personas. It 
was a reality check.

60  |   UX STRATEGY
In contrast, Ena’s customer discovery revealed that there is already 
an existing solution for Airbnb for Weddings, and it was…Airbnb! 
Moreover, she also learned that Airbnb is not designed to address the 
purpose, problems, or perspectives faced by the host or bride-to-be. For 
example, you currently can’t search for homes that will allow private 
parties. You have to look at each house, one listing at a time, and then 
contact the owners individually just as Ena did. Yet people (both hosts 
and brides-to-be) are currently using Airbnb as a Band-Aid solution 
because there is no better alternative! It’s when you stumble on evi-
dence like this that your “value innovation” creative juices should start 
flowing.
Now that we have feedback, you and your team, like Bita and Ena, 
need to make some decisions, because one of three things should have 
happened:
•	 You did not validate your customer hypothesis. Therefore, you 
need to pivot on who you think your customers really are. Go back 
to Step 1.
•	 You did not validate the pain point your customers were experienc-
ing. Therefore, you need to pivot on the problem. Go back to Step 2.
•	 You validated both your customer and your problem hypothesis 
and are feeling pretty good about your solution’s value proposition. 
Go on to Chapter 4.
Recap
At the beginning of this chapter, I talked about great value propositions 
from amazing companies like Waze, Airbnb, and Snapchat. Some of 
these value props are very different from what their founders started 
with before their products had substantial traction. Value propositions 
of products evolve with a great understanding of customers’ needs. Not 
to quote Peter Drucker ad nauseum, but he did say, “Strategy requires 
knowing what our business is and what it should be.”‡‡
By mashing up customer-discovery techniques with traditional 
user-research tools such as provisional personas, you now have a 
cost-efficient way to determine if you are on the right track with your

product. Even if you are intimidated by users, new to research, locked 
in by a requirements document, fighting a looming deadline, or star-
ing at a two-line vision statement, you want to reach out to users when 
you are at the starting point for a product development cycle. Because 
doing so is always far better than making an “ASS out of U and Me.”

Conducting Competitive Research
You were right. I was on the wrong track.  
We’re deep in the valley, how deep in the gulley.  
And now in the canyon. Out in the yonder.
—SONIC YOUTH (1984)
Now that you have a strong positive signal that you’re onto 
something, you need to ask, “Why hasn’t this solution been built yet?” 
I hesitate to say that everything has been done, but pretty much every-
thing has been attempted. It’s because individuals and companies have 
been designing products for distribution and consumption on the 
Internet for more than 20 years! Knowing what has actually worked 
or failed is crucial to identifying a competitive advantage. So, in this 
chapter and the next, we will look more deeply into Tenet 1, Business 
Strategy (Figure 4-1).

Learning Lessons, the Hard Way
Doing solid investigative market research is like peeling an onion. 
The more layers you peel, the more you reveal. And it also might bring 
tears to your eyes if you discover that your product vision is not actually 
unique. But don’t you want to know what it will take to beat the compe-
tition sooner rather than later? If you don’t know what you don’t know, 
you are at risk of learning the hard way.
Take, for instance, my dear father. In 1976, at the age of 38, he got up the 
courage to quit his full-time job as the area management supervisor for a 
popular California restaurant chain. He’d been working for others since 
he graduated from UCLA with an accounting degree and was eager to be 
an entrepreneur. His good friend did well for himself by opening several 
hot dog stands in the Los Angeles area. So, my father was confident that 
his own management experience would bring him success.
He soon found a hot dog stand for sale next to a carwash in North 
Hollywood. He watched the operation briefly and saw how very few 
customers came to the stand even while their cars were being washed. 
The place was run down, and the owner appeared indifferent to his 
customers. My father saw an opportunity for turning the stand into a 
profitable business and bought it immediately.
Figure 4-2 shows how he gave everything a fresh coat of paint, updated 
the menu, and put up a big sign that said the stand was under “new 
management.”

On opening day, though, he sold fewer than 10 hot dogs. Worse, cock-
roaches crept across the serving counter, and my dad kept trying to 
squash them before customers walked up. At the time, my brother and 
I (then 10 and 12) would hang out at the stand on the weekends, and 
we could see that my dad didn’t know what to make of his new busi-
ness. Eventually, he realized that in spite of all his efforts, he couldn’t 
turn it around. His management expertise did not translate into the 
emotional stamina and physical strength required to perform the daily 
operations of the business. So he put it up for sale.
One morning someone responded to his “Hot Dog Stand For Sale” ad. 
The man showed up to the stand at noon and introduced himself. He 
bought a hot dog and then sat down at a table to observe the entire 
lunch shift. In the first hour, an elderly woman who lived at the nearby 
senior-citizen home walked up and bought a hot dog. After one bite, 
she asked for her money back. She said, “It didn’t taste right.”
The man came back the next day and watched another lunch shift. 
Before he left, my father asked him what he thought of the business.
“To be honest, Alan,” the man replied with a heavy Armenian accent, 
“You are married to a corpse.”
That comment depressed my father for days. He decided to accept his 
fate and sold the stand at a significant loss, which was truly tough for 
my family. But the whole experience taught my father (and us kids) les-
sons that were huge.
Lessons Learned
•	 Before you start a new business, learn everything you can about 
how it works. Don’t let your enthusiasm dull your logic.
•	 Investigate your competition. What are they doing right? What 
are they doing wrong? Why should customers come to you?
•	 And when you can’t figure out how to make it work, admit defeat. 
It’s totally okay to fail! But move on. Or pivot!

Using the Competitive Analysis Matrix Tool
You and your team might think you are creating a new marketplace 
with your product, but how can you be sure? Chances are you actually 
are entering an existing market. Therefore, you want to study how all 
the current digital solutions address the needs of your target customers.
To be competitive, you need to know what’s out there, what has worked, 
and what has not worked. That’s why conducting market research on 
the competition is a crucial component of business strategy. You want 
firsthand knowledge of the good and bad user experiences provided by 
your competitors. If done thoroughly, the research can provide a trea-
sure trove of insight into current trends and outdated manifestations of 
mental models. It will also help your team learn about the competitors, 
their best practices for design, and what types of customer segments 
use their products. To connect the dots, though, you first need to col-
lect them.
I have found the most efficient way to do a comprehensive competitive 
analysis is to collect all of the data in a matrix. It’s the most obvious way 
to do a cross-comparison, and by using a spreadsheet, I can method-
ically collect data and not miss anything while I’m surfing around to 
research. The matrix helps keep track of everything that needs to be 
compared. When it’s complete, I can rationalize my position with a 
cogent understanding of numerous qualitative and quantitative data 
points.
I use Google spreadsheets instead of Excel because I prefer a free cloud-
based tool that is easily accessible to as many people—teammates and 
stakeholders—as possible. It’s important that everyone has access to 
the most up-to-date research, and this way I avoid blank stares during 
important discussions.
Figure 4-3 depicts an example of a spreadsheet that I created using 
Google documents specifically for conducting competitive research. 
I am going to use the research that I conducted on the Busy Man’s 
Shopping Site for explanation and sample data. (As I first mentioned 
in the Preface, I’ve included a toolkit with this book. It’s for you to use 
with your teams. Refer to it for details on accessing the Competitive 
Analysis Matrix.)

FIGURE 4-3
Competitive market research spreadsheet example

68  |   UX STRATEGY
Your ultimate goal is to devise a solution that creates a competitive 
advantage. The market research your team does in the tool will force 
everyone to look across the competitive landscape with an eye for gaps 
or inconsistencies in how the competitors deliver their user experi-
ences. The devil is in the details, and it’s in those details that Tenet 2, 
Value Innovation, can happen. (See Chapter 6 for more on this.)
When solid research is the input, solid analysis can be the output. This 
sounds obvious, but it’s amazing how many quick decisions are made 
after only a cursory examination of the marketplace. As strategists, we 
need to help our clients filter the market research into bite-size, action-
able takeaways in which everyone can make smart, analytical deci-
sions. Let me break it down slowly. At the end of this adventure, you 
will see that knowledge truly is power.
Understanding the Meaning of Competition
Let’s begin with some basics about conducting market research to ana-
lyze the competition. First let’s agree on the boundaries of the market. 
Take an index finger and draw a big circle in the air in front of you. 
Now, imagine that inside the circle is anybody on this planet who has 
regular (or consistent) access to the Internet. Anybody outside of the 
circle is everyone else. Let’s get rid of them and focus on the people 
inside the circle.
As digital product makers, the marketplace you all serve and domi-
nate is the Internet. It’s not only your marketplace; it’s your distribu-
tion medium. You and your team create for, deliver products to, interact 
with, and acquire more users than any other medium through this dig-
ital highway. This is why the Internet is far more powerful than tradi-
tional mediums like television and radio.
Another special thing about your marketplace is that it contains all of 
your existing and future customers. They can be either paying or non-
paying customers. They can be of almost any age range, so long as they 
can interact or engage with the product digitally. If a company in this 
space offers a product that is similar or even similar-ish to yours, they 
are your competitors. They have the ability to cut into your share of the 
potential two-plus billion people in the market.

 4. Conducting Competitive Research   |  69
However, not all of these two-plus billion people are necessarily your 
customers. (If you think they are, please reread Chapter 3, right now.) 
If you realize this from the start, it will be easier to pinpoint your 
competition.
TYPES OF COMPETITORS
A competitor is a person, team, or company that shares your goals and 
is fighting for the same thing that your product team wants. If you are 
entering a new market, there might be no true “direct competitors.” 
Still, the chances are that the market for your product already exists, 
and you just might not know about it yet.
Direct competitors are companies that offer the same, or very similar, 
value proposition to your current or future customers. This means that 
the customers you want are alive right now and spending their time 
and money on the Internet using a direct competitor’s product instead 
of yours to solve their problem—whether it is the best interface or not!
In my research for Paul the movie producer from Chapter 3, I found 
that the biggest direct competitor was a site called Trunk Club, shown 
in Figure 4-4.
FIGURE 4-4
Direct competitor’s website: Trunk Club

70  |   UX STRATEGY
Trunk Club is a great solution for Paul the movie producer’s intended 
customer segment because Trunk Club addresses his hypothesized 
users’ problems. For example, the Busy Man doesn’t want to deal with 
annoying sales people. If the Busy Man joins the VIP-ish sounding 
“Club,” he also gets high-end clothing sent to him to try on in the pri-
vacy of his own home. That seems to hit all the points Paul brought up 
in Chapter 3, doesn’t it? That’s why Trunk Club is a direct competitor.
Indirect competitors offer a similar value proposition to a different cus-
tomer segment; or, they target your exact customer base without offer-
ing the exact same value proposition. For instance, an indirect competi-
tor’s primary service might not be your value proposition, but their sec-
ondary service definitely is. Or, your customer base is using an aspect 
of an indirect competitor’s interface to solve the problem that our soon-
to-be-amazing product will!
In my research for the Busy Man’s Shopping Site, I discovered that the 
online shopping site Gilt (see Figure 4-5) is an indirect competitor.
FIGURE 4-5
Indirect competitor’s website: Gilt

 4. Conducting Competitive Research   |  71
Gilt is an indirect competitor because it offers a partial solution to the 
Busy Man customer segment. With Gilt, the Busy Man could avoid 
annoying salespeople and get access to top brands. However, Gilt has 
a flash sales business model. That means that single products are only 
on sale for a brief period of time (perhaps just 24 hours). This makes 
it possible for Gilt to offer its targeted customer base deep discounts, 
but Paul’s intended customer base doesn’t want that at the expense of 
flexibility and time. Time limits and curated selections would actually 
prevent Paul’s intended customers from putting together the person-
alized wardrobe of their dreams. So, although customers of the Busy 
Man could solve some of their big fashion needs with Gilt, it wouldn’t 
be the their ideal solution.
But no matter, whether the competition is direct or indirect, the Internet 
is an intense marketplace. Make sure that you consider all of your com-
petitors because they will affect the overall success of your product. 
The reality is that people often use products or combinations of prod-
ucts in ways that the product makers do not expect. (Remember what 
Ena discovered about hosts for wedding venues on Airbnb!) Research 
everything because that is how you and your team will ensure that you 
have an edge over others in your industry.
HOW TO FIND YOUR COMPETITORS AND COMPILE YOUR  
COMPETITION LIST
There are many ways to learn who your direct and indirect competitors 
are. In fact, you will most likely begin to learn about competitors before 
you sit down to do the competitive analysis. During customer discovery 
or other research, users might share names of products they’re using. 
During stakeholder interviews, the client, investors, and other product 
owners will probably drop the names of products they admire and want 
to emulate. Or, they might mention a product that they’ve heard is sim-
ilar to what your team is proposing. That’s why it’s crucial to keep track 
of competitor names somewhere so that you don’t forget them. Make a 
list somewhere in an email, word processing program, or a writing pad. 
Otherwise, you can jot the names down in your spreadsheet tool. Just 
track that list somewhere because you are going to need it very soon.
Of course, you could also stumble on a few products by surfing the cur-
rent marketplace on the Internet. There are hundreds of web research 
tools for doing effective market research. Google, obviously, is the most 
popular search engine for doing generalized research. The advanced 

72  |   UX STRATEGY
search filters are very powerful. However, it doesn’t hurt to use Yahoo!, 
which is powered by Microsoft’s Bing, to compare result sets. I will dig 
into this method more deeply now by demonstrating how to build a 
competitor list for the Busy Man’s Shopping Site.
Searching for competitors
First, you look for direct competitors—products that compete head-to-
head with your value proposition. Paul the movie producer’s vision was 
of a platform for the busy, wealthy, and particular guy who wants to 
buy high-end products. Therefore, you need to figure out keywords the 
Busy Man might use to search for similar products. In this scenario, it 
might be a good idea to reverse engineer—how would Paul’s customers 
search for a product? Here are some possible examples:
•	 Men’s ecommerce site
•	 Men’s shopping site
•	 Top brands
•	 Wardrobe online
•	 Personal stylist
Ideally, you want to be as quick and precise as possible when scan-
ning your results. What sets a professional web researcher apart from 
an amateur is how fast he is able to determine if the product matches 
your criteria. A good search result will often yield more than potential 
competitor websites on the search page, too. It will lead you to niche 
media platforms like blogs in which you can find “Top 10” or “Best 
of” articles from experts. These pieces of media are another great 
jumping-off point to find competitors. Other tactics include using 
Crunchbase, which collates the largest dataset of startup activity. You 
can also use advanced search tools such as the “more like this” button 
within Google AdWords, as illustrated in Figure 4-6. Clicking the but-
ton opens the window shown in Figure 4-7. It’s also a good idea to click 
through to the landing page of potential competitors. Read their About 
pages. Scan their products. Does it match your value proposition in any 
way? If it does, add the competitor to the list. If it doesn’t, quickly click 
the Back button. Then, just rinse and repeat!

You won’t get much information about your industry if you only exam-
ine two or three competitors. Unless you really have hit a blue ocean 
and there are only a handful of competitors in your market, shoot for 
identifying the top five direct competitors and obtaining at least three 
indirect competitors. Otherwise, keep your list diverse with established 
competitors versus newer players who have recently entered the mar-
ket. You want to get a panoramic view of how the new products might 
be more innovative to what best practices define their established 
competition.
Quick Tips
•	 Try different permutations of keyword searches by using 
quotations.
•	 Don’t be lazy. Be systematic and review all the links to ensure 
that you don’t miss anything.
•	 Don’t limit yourself to the first page of results. Look through at 
least 5 pages (the top 50 results) and see what treasures might 
be buried.

FILLING OUT THE MATRIX WITH DATA
Now we have a list of direct and indirect competitors, and that means 
we can start gathering the rest of our data. Go ahead and open the 
Competitive Analysis Matrix from the UX Strategy Toolkit if your com-
puter is handy.* As Figure 4-8 illustrates, I’ve provided a blank template 
for you to use. Plunk your competitor list into the leftmost column of 
the Y-axis.
FIGURE 4-8
Competitive Analysis Matrix template
Separate the direct competitors from the indirect competitors. Include 
the website address or app store, too, as demonstrated in Figure 4-9 (for 
example, Google Play versus Apple Store). This is reference for your 
team and you. It will make it easier for you to double-check data and 
verify facts. The list will eventually need to be reorganized; I go over 
how to do that in Chapter 5, after you gather your research and are 
ready for the analysis. For the time being, I want to just focus on cor-
rectly capturing your research.

Okay, now take a deep breath, because we are about to jump into the 
labor-intensive process of conducting research and capturing results. 
Pace yourself so that you can capture data as quickly and thoroughly 
as possible. Try to also keep an open mind because the only bias you 
should have is whether or not the product is actually a competitor.
However, research can be time-consuming, so when you go down the 
rabbit hole, be sure to come up for air. For your first pass, spend up to 
an hour filling out as many cells as possible in each row. Set a timer for 
30 minutes to give yourself a reality check at the halfway point. Less is 
more! Keep your documented research brief and to the point. This way, 
if you or anybody needs to refer back to the spreadsheet, it won’t require 
scanning excess or unrelated information.
If you look at our cloud example, you’ll see how rows represent com-
petitors, whereas columns represent competitor attributes (see Figure 
4-10). The rightmost column is the analysis column, which you can 
ignore for now until Chapter 5, after you collect all your research.
FIGURE 4-10
Horizontal (X-axis) attributes go across the columns
We’re going to attack each row, evaluating each competitor based on 
a range of market and UX attributes. I will explain the attributes that 
need to be captured in each column. Not all of the attributes are appli-
cable or relevant to all digital products. Just skip or delete the ones that 
don’t apply to your product. There also might be attributes that need to 
be considered that are not in this spreadsheet; feel free to add anything 
relevant by adding a new column or replacing one that you don’t need 
to use. What is crucial is that the pros and cons of the UX are clearly 
evaluated.
URL of website or app store location
This is where you put the primary online location that customers use 
to access the product. For desktop-only products, it will be the website 
address (URL), as depicted in Figure 4-11. For multiplatform products, 

76  |   UX STRATEGY
you can list website URLs, links to app store preview pages, and so 
on. You want to make the information easy for your team to reference 
regardless of what device everyone has. They shouldn’t all need to 
download an app to see how it looks. Here are sample links to the Waze 
app listing for Apple and Android:
Apple
https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/waze-social-gps-maps-traffic/
id323229106?mt=8
Android
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.waze&hl=en
If a product is a mobile app with a nonessential desktop counterpart 
used only for marketing or support (such as Tinder’s website, http://
www.gotinder.com), it’s not crucial to list both platforms. 
If you find that the competitor’s website and mobile app are both cru-
cial to the customer experience of the product, I recommend that you 
break the competitors into two separate rows, especially if they offer 
distinct user experiences or feature sets (for instance, the Airbnb desk-
top versus the leaner mobile version). This way you can evaluate each 
platform separately.
Usernames and password access
To beat your competitors, you need to know exactly what they are doing. 
You want to know the unknowns. In many cases, the only way to learn 
this is through your competitor’s experience and/or sales funnel by 
becoming a user yourself. That’s right, you want to create an account or 
download the app. The column shown in Figure 4-12 is where you keep 
track of that information.

The benefit of tracking the access information is that it saves time 
for you and the rest of the team. They won’t have to create and 
pseudo-personalize a profile, too. This is especially useful if you’re 
researching a two-sided market in which you need two types of 
accounts (for example, buyer and seller). Don’t be dumb when cre-
ating all of these new accounts, however. Be very cautious about the 
usernames, passwords, and the personal information you choose to 
share.
Here are a few pro tips:
•	 Create one global username and password for use on all the prod-
ucts in your audit. It makes it a lot easier to remember and dis-
tribute to your team. Include a capital letter and number in your 
password because that criterion will be required by some of the 
products.
•	 Don’t ever use personal information such as your kid’s birthday, 
your own passwords, or profanity. You will potentially share this 
information with clients or colleagues.
•	 Do not log on (single sign-on) using your personal or professional 
Facebook (or any social network) account ever.
•	 If you are creating profiles on social networks, do not use your per-
sonal or work email address! Instead, create secondary accounts on 
Gmail or Yahoo first. Then, use these fake email accounts to create 
fake profiles.
•	 If it is a transactional website you are researching, purchase some-
thing. If it is an app that you must purchase (versus a free one), 
pay for it. Don’t be cheap! It’s usually only a few dollars here or 
there. Having one user account for your entire team to learn from 
is worth the financial investment.

78  |   UX STRATEGY
Why Are We Being So Covert?
Here are two reasons why you probably don’t want to use accounts that 
personally identify you:
Reason 1: When I worked on the treatment center startup, I needed to find 
competitors for the value proposition. One way to do this was through 
social media accounts such as Twitter, in which I could tweet that I was 
looking for advice about drug rehab and treatment centers. I didn’t want to 
use my personal account because it might risk the professional reputation 
I had with colleagues. Also, I didn’t want my friends and family to become 
concerned that I was personally looking for treatment.
Reason 2: The startup world is fierce. If your competitor is in beta, it might 
know that you’re the competition, too. If it recognizes your account or 
becomes aware that you’re gathering competitive intelligence, it could cut 
off your access.
Purpose of site
The purpose of the site is why it exists; it’s basically the high-level 
description of the product or the value proposition. Think about how the 
competitor might explain it to a user or investor. As Figure 4-13 demon-
strates, your description should be one to two sentences that describe 
the primary customer and the solution provided by the product.
You can often find this information by looking in the following places:
“About” or “About Us” section
The value proposition is often written here by the competitor.
FIGURE 4-13
Purpose of Site result 
sample

 4. Conducting Competitive Research   |  79
Crunchbase
Both the “Company Overview” and “Detailed Description” section 
have company descriptions.
iTunes or Google Play app stores
The first two lines of the “description” are generally what you’re 
looking for.
Social networks such as Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter, and YouTube
These sometimes provide information about the value proposition.
Online annual report
All publicly traded companies must release an annual report that often 
has a description of the company near the beginning of the report. 
Simply Google the competitor’s name and “Annual Report” to find it!
Year founded
What year was this company founded or the product launched (Figure 
4-14)? You should be able to find this in the same place you found the 
value proposition; for example, the About Us section, Crunchbase, and 
so on. It’s useful information to have when you do the analysis, because 
you can see what players (products and/or services) are new to the mar-
ket and who’s been around for a while.
Funding rounds
A funding round is a discrete round of investment by which a business 
or other enterprise raises money to fund operations, expansion, capital 
projects, acquisitions, or some other business purpose.† (See Figure 
4-15.) Again, the obvious places to find this information are Crunchbase 
and/or the competitor’s website. This information is important because 
competitors with funding have a competitive advantage.

80  |   UX STRATEGY
Revenue streams
A revenue stream is how the product brings in money. As Figure 4-16 
depicts, it could be via a transaction fee, advertising, monthly fees, or 
Software as a Service (SaaS), or by selling user data and trends to other 
companies. OkCupid is a dating site that’s free for users. The company 
makes money through premium features and advertising. Facebook 
uses data mining as its first revenue model, selling competitive intelli-
gence to third parties from unsuspecting users. eBay’s success hinges 
completely on users being able to easily buy from and sell to one 
another. Adobe charges a monthly SaaS fee for its cloud-based service.
How a product is potentially monetized should be directly tied to the 
UX strategy because that’s what will make the product valuable to the 
user and the stakeholder. A successful competitor’s revenue model will 
probably reflect that. If you’re not sure how a certain competitor is mon-
etizing its product, spend more time using its website. If the competitor 
wants to survive in the long run, it needs to eventually charge someone 
for something. Is there advertising on the website? Click the “Advertise 
with Us” link to see how it position itself. How do your competitors 
charge for membership? Look at their annual report if they’re available.
Monthly traffic
This is actually a measurable, quantifiable attribute. If you have access 
to Comscore, you can get super-accurate data—traffic (see Figure 4-17), 
minutes-on-site, and so on. about other websites. But there are also 
dozens of free websites that monitor monthly traffic. Usually all you

 4. Conducting Competitive Research   |  81
need to do to get the data is type in the domain name of the site you’re 
researching. Check out Compete.com, Quantcast, and Alexa. You can 
pilfer free data from these sites and many others. By looking at multi-
ple data points, you can triangulate an average of the traffic data, which 
is a lot better than not having any traffic data at all. For iPhone down-
loads and stats, there are great sites such as App Annie, AppFigures, 
Mopapp, and Distimo.
# of SKUs/listings
This cell is optional because this information is often difficult to ascer-
tain. Here, you will track how many items or listings are available for 
the product. In the case of an ecommerce site like Zappos, you’ll track 
SKUs (stock keeping units, see Figure 4-18). Each SKU represents one 
item for sale on the site. For example, on Zappos I can currently see 
that there are more than 13,828 men’s shoes (SKUs) for sale by simply 
clicking the link for the top level of the men’s shoes category. You could 
use this as a point of comparison to other sites selling in that category. 
In the case of a video-sharing or content-producing site, you’ll want 
track how many videos/articles are actually on the site. In the case of 
a transactional product/platform, you’ll want to know how much stuff 
is in there, even if it’s a rough estimate based on a few search queries.
The problem with this attribute is that there’s no magic button that 
you can click to give you this information. In many cases, there are 
design conventions such as “infinite scroll” that prevent you from eas-
ily knowing how many more results could be displayed. Try searching 
for a common word that would apply to a lot of listings. For a clothing 
site, you could try a word like “shoe” or “shirt.” The goal is for you to 
have data to compare. For example, what is the total result of one prod-
uct—watches, for example—across multiple competitor products? You 
want to establish how empty or full the competitor’s site is. Is it actually 
offering what it’s promising to the user?
FIGURE 4-17
Monthly Traffic result 
sample

82  |   UX STRATEGY
If it’s a social networking platform, try to determine how often and how 
many users are interacting with one another. You might get different 
results with a variety of word combinations. We are looking for some-
thing to estimate against, and you can change the title of the column so 
it more accurately reflects the substance of your data.
Primary categories
If the site is selling products (like Honda.com) or offering content (like 
Oprah.com), you need to understand how everything is categorized. 
The site probably (hopefully) already does this, so check out the site’s 
global navigation menu. If the category list is small (women’s, men’s, 
kids’, and so on), you can just copy that into your spreadsheet, as illus-
trated in Figure 4-19. If the list is long or complex, as on Amazon or 
eBay, the site is probably a horizontal marketplace. A horizontal market 
tries to meet the needs of a wide range of customers by offering prod-
ucts or services across many sectors. If you’re studying a horizontal 
marketplace, try to ascertain what the most active categories are. Look 
at what’s featured on the home page. What does the site promote as 
“most popular” or “best selling”? In either case, just include the catego-
ries that correlate to the products on the site. Don’t include noncontent/
product categories such as “About us” or the Help section.
Social networks
Is the competitor’s brand also on Twitter, Facebook, or others? Which 
social platforms is it truly using? Most products these days integrate 
with these platforms, but they don’t fully leverage anything with all of 
them. Figure 4-20 shows that you need to determine what social media 
FIGURE 4-18
SKUs/Listings result 
sample
FIGURE 4-19
Primary Categories 
result sample

 4. Conducting Competitive Research   |  83
strategy each competitor is trying to harness well. You can find most 
of this information by simply searching the product’s name on Twitter, 
Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, and any other popular relevant social 
platform, or by just checking out the competitors’ sites.
Content types
Use this to capture what type of content is on the competitor’s site, as 
depicted in Figure 4-21. Is the bulk of the content text, photos, or video? 
How much content dominates the site and how is it presented? Is the 
content well organized? Is it easy to scan and/or read? How detailed and 
informative is the information displayed on the product detail pages?
Personalization features
Personalization, shown in Figure 4-22, is one of the most crucial fea-
tures to get customers engaged with an application or website. It should 
provide a value-added experience. On Airbnb, Amazon, or eBay, you 
don’t need to be logged on to perform a basic search. However, you 
will need to log on as soon as you want to take an action (for example, 
save to favorites or make a purchase). The more time people spend per-
sonalizing their experience, the more engaged they will get with the 
product. (Think: Facebook!) Personalization features include favorit-
ing, watch lists, user profiles, wish lists, custom content experiences, 
custom interface experiences, messaging, saved shopping carts, and so 
on. Sign up for the competitor’s newsletters, too.
Another way to check out the personalization features is to go to the 
“My Account” section of each competitor. See what the site or app 
allows you to do that’s particularly useful and helps achieve the value 
FIGURE 4-20
Social Networks result

sample

84  |   UX STRATEGY
proposition. How can customers customize their experience? Is the 
experience sticky—meaning so engaging that the user will really want 
to “stick” to this product? Does it display the user’s name? Does it 
remember and display the last item the user looked at? Does it let the 
user make a list of favorite items? As you look at all of the competitors, 
it will soon become obvious which personalization features are crucial 
and which are not.
Community/UGC features
User-generated content (UGC) or crowd-sourced content is content that 
is created by the users. Some products such as Yelp, Waze, eBay, and 
Airbnb would be useless without user-generated content. In contrast, 
brands like Levis and ABC have mostly editorial content. Editorial con-
tent is created by people who work for or associate professionally with 
the site. In this column, you want to estimate the amount of user-gen-
erated content versus the amount of editorial content, as illustrated in 
Figure 4-23. You want to get a sense of where most of the content is 
coming from.
Look for features like message boards, the ability to post content 
(reviews, stories, and so on), and user comments. Be specific about 
which features are crucial and try to cite concrete examples of how they 
bring value to the product’s other customers.

Competitive advantage
Think different! Differentiators are distinct features that a product pro-
vides that are not found in its competitors. They give a product a com-
petitive advantage, such as those depicted in Figure 4-24. They can be a 
combination of attributes that make the product better. Some attributes 
might be specific to the online experience and others to the offline 
experience.
For instance, Zappos made a name for itself by providing an amazing 
customer experience. It is known for having a great browsing experi-
ence as well as simplifying product returns. Vine’s initial differentia-
tor was how easy it was to record a video by touching anywhere on the 
screen. What makes it different now is that it’s a massive social network 
owned by Twitter. Kayak had the ability to filter live search results long 
before Priceline did. Kayak made the experience even better by pro-
viding the simplest of interactive patterns—a slider—to make this live 
filtering fun.
Figure out the top three differentiators of each product and list them 
in this cell. Ask yourself questions such as which features were suc-
cessful because the product was first-to-market? Can those features be 
easily replicated? Which is better, the filtering or the large database of 
options? Which attributes are specific to the online experience?
Heuristic evaluation
Heuristic is a fancy word that means experimentation and trial-by-er-
ror. In other words, get firsthand experience using the product to see 
how it works for you, personally. What do you think?
FIGURE 4-24
Competitive Advantage 
result sample

86  |   UX STRATEGY
You basically want to quickly evaluate whether the site is usable. You 
probably don’t have time for anything exhaustive, so just do a quick 
evaluation, such as that shown in Figure 4-25, and give the product 
an overall grade of “A” to “F.” You can use the following questions as a 
guide:
•	 Does the experience allow the user to easily accomplish her primary 
goal? Is it intuitive?
•	 Are the navigation, page/screen layouts, and visual design consistent?
•	 Is it easy to find, search, and browse the content or services being 
offered?
•	 Is the user feedback (for instance, error messaging) satisfactory? Is 
there a live help or a support system in place?
Customer reviews
This is a summary of the amount (that is, hundreds or thousands) of 
customer reviews that you can find on a product outside of its website. 
For mobile apps, you can find these in the app stores where you down-
load the product. For websites, you can sometimes find these on Quora 
or other similar message-board platforms where users reach out to the 
general public for troubleshooting advice. You are looking for the latest 
recurring customer complaints about a product because those poten-
tial pain points are something your team might be able improve upon.
General/miscellaneous notes
This is miscellaneous information that doesn’t fit into the other col-
umns. You can use this for any research relevant to your product that 
you want to track. Feel free to change the name of this column if 
needed.

Questions/notes to team or self
Remember this is a collaborative document. Other people will be read-
ing your research as you fill it out and could provide valuable informa-
tion. Thus, you might put things in here such as, “This site doesn’t 
work on Chrome not sure if it’s me.” “Hey Steve, do you think you can 
expense a pair of shoes on this site so we can see how the entire trans-
action works?”
Sometimes, you will have a miscellaneous note that you want to 
remember. You can also use this column as a parking lot for attributes 
that need to be examined across all sites.
Analysis
You get to skip this for now until you finish up all the other competi-
tors. Chapter 5 covers how to do the analysis section.
One last note: often product teams and stakeholders don’t keep an 
eye on the market after they’ve moved on from the research process. 
However, this is a mistake because the Internet is a fast-moving target. 
Things change really fast. The competitive landscape is always shift-
ing; consequently, competitive research will never be final. One com-
petitor might tank but two others will pop up. It’s like playing whack-
a-mole. For instance, I did the competitive research for the Busy Man 
Shopping Site in 2012. I’m sure if you look at the landscape now, it’s 
very different. That’s why you and your team always need to be on your 
toes, agile, and ready to grab your competitor’s newest ideas and imme-
diately see how they might affect your product vision.
Conducting UX-Focused Market Research
There are many benefits to having your market research conducted by the 
UX lead or a UX team member:
Design enhancement Oftentimes, what separates a killer UX design 
(more on this later) from an average one is nuance. A better visual design 
might just have a slightly different shade of color. A better music compo-
sition might contain a tone played at the perfect beat. When studying UX, 
you’ll find nuance in the articulation of an unexpected capability (or power 
for the user) through a subtle enhancement in either the interface or flow 
of screens. It might be a prompt that appears only once but at the precise 
time of need. Content messaging (“Saving…saved”) is one of my favorite 
forms of nuance.

88  |   UX STRATEGY
Simplicity UX designers think about the number of clicks and how easy 
it is for someone to accomplish a task. They often spot an opportunity for 
improvement by changing an interaction design pattern. Think back to our 
Tinder example, and how a simple swipe left versus right became a major 
binary decision.
Cost It’s faster to have the same UX designer research and build the 
product. He’ll see which interaction-design best practices (like “Advanced 
Search”) actually work the best by examining the competition. He’ll become 
expert in the subject matter by researching each site’s taxonomy and 
content.
Tag team It’s an opportunity to let a UX lead or strategist mentor a junior-
level researcher. The lead will be more efficient when the junior team mem-
ber does the research and the lead provides analysis. The entire UX team 
will become familiar with the design of all of the competitors.
UX innovation Improving UX design is almost always possible. People are 
becoming more familiar with more sophisticated tasks as we offer them 
solutions worth the time to explore. The Internet is only going to become 
more powerful, fast, complicated, and pervasive as it becomes entrenched 
in the daily lives of people of all ages.
Recap
To build something unique, you cannot ignore your competition. In 
this chapter, I discussed how to conduct competitive research to learn 
about the marketplace. You learned how to identify direct and indirect 
competitors. You relentlessly searched the Web, capturing a range of 
qualitative and quantitative data points to help understand what kind 
of marketplace your product might be entering. Now, it’s time to ana-
lyze that grid and extract meaningful intelligence that will inform the 
UX. That might sound complicated, but don’t panic. Just move on to 
Chapter 5.

The Blockbuster Value Proposition, Part 2
Let’s return to the unfolding drama we left in Chapter 3, in which our 
UX strategist, Jaime, talks to Paul, a big-time movie producer, on a 
Hollywood backlot about his idea for a shopping site for the wealthy 
Busy Man. He’s just revealed how his value proposition also solves his 
personal problem.
INT. BUNGALOW – MORNING 
The shot frames JAIME and PAUL. Paul is cocksure. 
JAIME is inquisitive.
JAIME
Do you know if there are any competitors 
already in the space? Is anyone already 
doing this?
PAUL throws up his hands. He’s super amped about 
his idea.
PAUL
My wife and I have looked around, but we 
haven’t found anything that really nails it.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. BUNGALOW — MORNING
It’s two weeks later, and Jaime is back in the 
bungalow. Paul is staring at hard copies of the 
Competitive Analysis Finding’s brief. He seems 
baffled and annoyed.
JAIME
As you can see from my research and analy-
sis, there are actually several competitors 
with significant funding already delivering 
your product idea in the marketplace.
PAUL
I have never heard of these companies. So 
you think it’s risky to try to directly com-
pete against them?

JAIME
Well actually, I think we should consider 
doing more research about the customer you 
want to target. And explore how they cur-
rently solve their problem.
PAUL
I already know there are lots of guys like 
me who hate shopping.
JAIME
How about we interview them and run some 
experiments to test variations on your value 
proposition?
PAUL
I feel like we can just start building out a 
website and see how things go.
JAIME
Why don’t you take a closer look at all the 
sites from the market research and see how 
they work. Or have your wife look at them? 
I also made some other recommendations on 
other ways to attack the problem with an 
ecommerce business model.
PAUL
I still think my original idea has legs.
END SCENE.
Paul obviously wasn’t happy with the market analysis, but guess who 
was? His wife! She sensed that this idea could be a money pit and was 
glad to have a strong second opinion to back up her instincts. In the 
end, Paul the movie producer dumped this idea and went back to mak-
ing movies. I never heard from him again.

Lessons Learned
•	 You must question your stakeholders and clients about their 
understanding of the competition and ensure that whatever 
statements they make are thoroughly backed by empirical 
research.
•	 The analysis should also recommend alternatives, especially if the 
initial product vision and business model have risks. After all, you 
do want to help clients convert their dreams into an executable 
strategy.
•	 Sometimes, people have fixed ideas, and no amount of research 
will change their minds. That’s when the strategist has to ask a 
personal and ethical question of herself: will I help this person 
make the product regardless of the research, or do I walk away?
What Is an Analysis?
When analyzing things, you are essentially trying to convert a lot of 
information into smaller actionable bites. You are trying to find rela-
tionships among different inputs to make inferences about why certain 
things are happening. By breaking larger problems into smaller prob-
lems, you and your team can more easily tackle big-picture outcomes.
Converting information into meaningful intelligence is actually one 
step in a larger process called competitive intelligence (see Figure 5-2). 
Business author Jim Underwood writes, “Competitive intelligence is 
the process of legally and ethically gathering, analyzing, and acting on 
information about an organization’s market environment, competition, 
and other forces that may impact its future success.”† What Underwood 
is saying is that the impartial research should lead to impartial deci-
sions. And that’s one reason why clients hire consultants—to help 
them to avoid emotionally fueled judgments.

 5. Conducting Competitive Analysis   |  93
This analytical approach also ties into the Build-Measure-Learn loop 
from Lean Startup. It should continuously inform the strategic and 
tactical business decisions of your product. What’s true today might 
not be true tomorrow. If your team plans to build an innovative prod-
uct, you must always keep gathering data, analyzing it, and acting on 
it to be successful. Your gathered intelligence should strive to remain 
competitive.
Because you’ve already looked closely at your digital competitors, you’re 
now ready to develop the intelligence about what’s working, why it is 
working, and what opportunities are available for your product in the 
evolving marketplace. After all, you don’t want to just launch a prod-
uct that copies all your competitors’ features as is. You also don’t want 
your ultimate analysis to just be a side-by-side feature comparison of 
them. (For example, “This is how all the competitors use a Subscribe 
button.” Or, “All of our competitors have these features, so we should, 
too!”) My hero Steve Blank wrote a “Death by Competitive Analysis” 
rant‡ in which he argues that making a “my features versus their fea-
tures” document will ultimately sink the ship. Simply offering as many 
features as you can overlooks the holistic UX and business model, and 
it doesn’t address what features the customers actually want or need to 
accomplish their primary goal. It’s your job to analyze everything and 
ultimately cherry-pick and recommend to the team the crucial features 
and opportunities that will create value innovation (Tenet 2). To make 
the competition irrelevant, you will have to offer something unique 
that radically improves on their current options, and you’ll figure this 
out by diving into the spreadsheet and analyzing the raw data.

THE FOUR STEPS TO A COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS 
AND MARKET OPPORTUNITIES
Just follow these four steps, which I will walk you through in detail:
1.	 Scan, skim, and color-code each column for highs and lows.
2.	 Creating logical groupings for comparison.
3.	Analyze each competitor by benchmarking product attributes and 
best practices (this goes in the last column of the spreadsheet).
4.	 Writing the Competitive Analysis Findings Brief.
It’s that easy! We just need to be methodical in our process.
You’re going to use these steps to turn your market research into 
meaningful competitive intelligence. When you’re done with the entire 
labor-intensive process, you’ll use the major takeaways to create a 
Competitive Analysis Findings Brief with recommended action plans.
Step 1: Scan, skim, and color-code each column for highs and lows
The end goal of the spreadsheet analysis is to distill your learnings into 
a form, brief, or presentation that explains the rationale behind your 
recommendations. To do that, you need to do what is called systems 
thinking to organize information and processes. (See the interview with 
Milana Sobol in Chapter 10 for more on systems thinking.) So, let’s 
begin doing that by looking at the heap of raw data in your spreadsheet.
Scanning and skimming the data
After inputting all the data into the spreadsheet, it’s probably a good 
idea to reacquaint yourself with all rows (competitors) and columns 
(attributes) before analyzing them. To do that, I use two speed-reading 
techniques: skimming and scanning. Skimming means moving your 
eyes rapidly over text to get the basic meaning of it. Scanning is rapidly 
covering a lot of material while searching for a specific thing. I skim 
and scan a lot during a data analysis but not to be sloppy or to cut cor-
ners. Instead, I want to quickly discern how simple or complicated the 
task at hand is. Is my spreadsheet 5 rows by 5 columns or 12 rows by 
24 columns with lots of missing data? Estimate the density and com-
pleteness of the content you are about to analyze so that you’ll know 
how long it will take. This matters because you probably have a fixed 
amount of time to do this task, and you don’t want to waste precious 
project hours going down a rabbit hole on just one row of analysis. For 

 5. Conducting Competitive Analysis   |  95
instance, if you have 20 competitors to analyze and 20 hours in which 
to complete this task, you have 1 hour to analyze each competitor. Time 
blocking for both research and analysis is essential because you want 
to have a balanced perspective—no blind spots.
Also notice if something looks incomplete or missing. Did you or who-
ever it was who did the research overlook an obvious competitor that 
really needs to be considered? Is the column with the monthly traffic 
or apps downloaded blank? That attribute could be quite important to 
know, and it’s a colossal distraction to have to stop an analysis to switch 
gears back into research mode.
Measuring raw data points
A data point is a discrete unit of information. Any single fact or obser-
vation is a data point. In our analysis, data points can help us illumi-
nate whether something is a failure or success. There are two kinds of 
data points to keep an eye out for in our columns: quantitative data and 
qualitative data.
Quantitative data is numbers and statistics. How much traffic did a 
site get? How many transactions happened on the site? How many 
SKUs are on the site? Numbers can be metrics, transactions, and/or a 
finite set of options. Unlike qualitative data, these numbers have logic 
or order applied to them. For example, the quantitative data points of 
a Starbuck’s latte might be the size of the cup, the temperature of the 
coffee, the price, or the time it took the barista to make it.
Qualitative data is descriptive and subjective. It’s the stuff that makes 
up interesting content such as opinions, reactions, emotions, aesthetics, 
physical traits, and so on, but in most cases it’s not quantifiable. These 
data points can’t be easily measured or ordered. The qualitative aspects 
of a Starbucks latte are its taste, the aroma, how frothy the cream is, the 
aesthetics of the environment in which it is made, or the service.
QUANTITATIVE DATA
QUALITATIVE DATA
Numbers (metrics, data sets)

Can be observed, but not measured
Length, area, volume, speed, time, and so on
Opinions, reactions, tastes, appearance

96  |   UX STRATEGY
Sometimes, the difference between quantitative and qualitative data 
isn’t obvious at first glance. So make sure that you’re careful. For exam-
ple, on a dating site, you might think “men with brown eyes” is a quali-
tative attribute. It’s a color after all and could imply how people perceive 
the man’s attractiveness. However, what if the site makes male users 
choose an eye color when they sign up, and they only have five options 
to choose from—brown, blue, hazel, gray, and green. This is actually 
information that could be measured. The data point is objective; you 
have a number to quantify it.
Fun with color-coding
You can color-code the spreadsheet to keep track of meaningful data 
points, trends, and other patterns, as shown in Figure 5-3. For exam-
ple, use yellow to highlight the most telling information (for instance, 
all competitors struggle with a feature). Use green to highlight posi-
tive attributes (highest monthly traffic). Just remember to keep it sim-
ple and use colors effectively. Creating a complex code in this initial 
pass won’t help your analysis, and it can confuse other team members 
who are also popping into check out or add to the raw data. The color 
code should be used sparingly to highlight things that are crucial to 
remember.
FIGURE 5-3
Highlighted cells showing color-coding of meaningful attributes
Step 2: Creating logical groupings for comparison 
Now that you have an overall sense of your data, you need to do a little 
housekeeping to make the process of analysis very efficient. You want 
to compare the sites and apps in your analysis that have things in com-
mon. You want to compare apples to apples, oranges to oranges, and 

 5. Conducting Competitive Analysis   |  97
mobile apps for fresh produce delivery against mobile apps for fresh 
produce delivery. Thus, you need to manually sort and filter the com-
petitors in the list into subgroups that you can compare practically.
Using logical groupings, you can place competitors that have common 
traits into “buckets.” You already have two of them: direct and indirect 
competitors. If you don’t have any groupings to make beyond those two, 
you might want to reorganize the rows at the very least. It doesn’t need 
to be very complicated. For example, you could do something as simple 
as rank your direct competitors from most threatening to least threat-
ening to the value proposition.
Here are examples of potential subgroups:
LOGICAL SUBGROUP EXAMPLES
Desktop versus mobile platform
Content type (for example, ecommerce, publishers, or aggregators)
Horizontal markets (Craig’s List to Amazon to eBay or Target to Walmart)
Vertical markets (clothing, health, banking, and so on)
Business models
Here are examples of different ways in which you can order the list of 
competitive products:
•	 Highest traffic or most downloads (I always put the most popular 
competitors at the top)
•	 Alphabetically
•	 Newest to oldest in the market
•	 Numerous features to minimal features
•	 Largest to smallest in terms of SKUs, articles, or listings (this 
should be tied to traffic)
Remember your goal is to make it easier to identify which factors give 
other products their competitive advantage. You are looking for com-
monalities and differences so that you and your team can truly under-
stand why certain products are more successful than others.

98  |   UX STRATEGY
Step 3: Analyze each competitor by benchmarking product  
attributes and best practices
The term benchmark originates from the chiseled horizontal marks 
that surveyors made in stone structures to ensure that a leveling rod 
could be accurately repositioned in the same place in the future. These 
marks were usually indicated with a chiseled arrow below the horizon-
tal line, as demonstrated in Figure 5-4.§
Benchmarking in the business world helps organizations identify 
and examine key facets of another identity so that comparisons can 
be made. This analysis leads to reducing costs, optimizing the sales 
funnel, and improving the product so that it delivers more value to 
the target customer. In this similar vein, when you analyze your data, 
you’re going to benchmark by comparing the entire collection of prod-
ucts (sites or apps) in the matrix to one another, and you’re going to do 
this on an attribute-by-attribute basis.
Each column on the spreadsheet represents a different attribute, and 
you’ve collected data points about each one, whether it’s downloads of 
an app or a specialized content category. These quantitative and qualita-
tive data points give you the ability to measure, score, and identify best 
practices versus lame practices.

 5. Conducting Competitive Analysis   |  99
When you benchmark direct competitors, you want to find a compet-
itive parity among their products. You’re looking for a baseline that 
defines the bottom-line criteria that future customers will expect when 
your team delivers on the value proposition. Do customers expect that 
a product detail page will have photos, videos, and reviews? Does the 
most popular site have the most merchandise and/or the widest selec-
tion? Does the company behind the most innovative and downloaded 
app have lots of funding?
When you benchmark the indirect competitors, you’re analyzing 
how these digital products offer alternative ways to solve a problem. 
For example, in the Busy Man’s Shopping Site competitive analysis, I 
benchmarked the monthly traffic of the indirect competitors. The web-
site Gilt had monthly traffic of 1.8 million users, but Fab—a direct com-
petitor of Gilt—only had 380,000 users. This data point really seemed 
important to me because it made me wonder: why was the disparity 
between their monthly traffic so huge? What was Gilt doing better?
You are looking for trends, patterns, gaps, and an overall sense of the 
look of the landscape. Often, you will notice common patterns being 
repeated across many sites within a vertical market. You might won-
der why they’re all broken in the same way. You might realize that they 
are all overlooking an especially useful capability that could be the 
secret sauce you use in your value innovation. (See Chapter 6 for more.) 
Are most of the losers missing on content, traffic, stickiness, person-
alization, a bad browse or search experience? Determine the causes. 
By benchmarking the competition, you’ll find opportunities to create 
value by either innovating or optimizing on the best UX and business 
model practices of other competing products. You’ll also want to extract 
these golden nuggets as recommendations to put in your brief.
The analysis column of each competitor
The reason you waited until now to do the analysis column in the 
Competitive Analysis Matrix template is that you needed to collect as 
much data as possible about the entire competitive landscape of your 
value proposition. But now, you’re finally ready to fill it out.
At this point, you should see nuances among competitors. You’ve 
benchmarked attributes. You can gauge which competitors are a suc-
cess or failure. You can say which competitor is number one, number 

100  |   UX STRATEGY
two, and who’s doing something impressive even if they’re farther 
behind in the marketplace race than others. You have a sense of the 
diversity of business models in play.
Use your analysis to answer the following questions about each com-
petitor in a brief paragraph:
•	 How is it competing against your value proposition?
•	 If it’s a direct competitor, what is it doing great or particularly 
badly?
•	 If it’s an indirect competitor, is it competing with a similar solution 
or is it going after a similar customer segment?
•	 What are the big takeaways the stakeholder should know if she 
only reads this cell?
You can see how I answered those questions in the Busy Man’s 
Shopping Site Competitive Analysis Matrix in Figures 5-5 and 5-6. 
There’s an example for a direct and an indirect competitor.
FIGURE 5-5
Direct competitor analysis sample

 5. Conducting Competitive Analysis   |  101
FIGURE 5-6
Indirect competitor analysis sample
Notice how the analysis cell imparts a picture of the competitor. This 
is really important because if your team and stakeholders have access 
to your raw data, you should assume that they might not necessarily 
look at all the other cells; they might only read this column. But that’s 
your job anyway. The analysis cell is where you’re going to sum up 
everything they should understand even if they never read the entire 
spreadsheet.
Step 4: Writing the Competitive Analysis Findings Brief
Abductive reasoning is a form of logical inference that goes from obser-
vation to a hypothesis. It accounts for the reliable data (observation) 
and seeks to explain relevant evidence.¶ It shapes your rationale for 
making recommendations, and making recommendations is the pur-
pose of the Competitive Analysis Findings Brief. The findings brief is 
an easy-to-read summary of your competitive analysis along with your 
recommendations about how to move forward. This is your final judg-
ment after doing your deep dive into the competitive landscape. It’s 
¶	  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning

102  |   UX STRATEGY
about articulating your final, unbiased view of the marketplace in as 
user-friendly a way as a face-to-face conversation. This document will 
be what your client takes away from your research.
Before you begin writing the findings brief, however, take a moment to 
step away from your spreadsheet. Zoom out from the details and think 
hard about the big picture. First, you should be able to answer the fol-
lowing questions about the marketplace:
•	 Which competitors are closest to delivering a similar value propo-
sition (that is, an online shopping site featuring high-end brands)? 
Are their products failing? Why? Or are their products succeeding 
so well that there’s no room for your product?
•	 Which competitors directly appeal to your customer segment 
(wealthy men)?
•	 Of those competitors, how do you think customers discover them 
(perhaps paid advertising)?
•	 What products offer the best user experiences and business mod-
els? Who is doing something unique? What is working well for 
them? What do they have that your users like?
Second, you need to address in the brief if there’s room in the market 
for your product. What opportunities exist for it? What gaps could it 
fill? Perhaps your market research and analysis have shown you that 
your team has hit the entrepreneurial jackpot. Perhaps your product is 
one or all of the following:
•	 First-to-market with something unique (such as Pinterest) 
•	 Offers users a better method to use or save time or finances 
(Amazon Prime saves customers from having to waste time run-
ning errands.)
•	 Creates value simultaneously for two different customer segments 
(Airbnb does so for hosts and guests; Eventbrite for event planners 
and attendees.)
This is a blue ocean, which was discussed in Chapter 2. The thesis of 
the book Blue Ocean Strategy by W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne** 
is of the uncontested marketplace in which the competition becomes 
**	 Kim, W. Chan and Renée Mauborgne. Blue Ocean Strategy. Harvard Business School Press, 
2005.

 5. Conducting Competitive Analysis   |  103
irrelevant because there is none. A blue ocean is full of customers 
with unmet needs. A red ocean is a market full of sharks fighting for 
the fish. In writing your brief, you must be able to say with certainty 
whether your product is in a blue, red, or somewhere-in-between pur-
ple ocean (such as the lovely vista in Figure 5-7).
FIGURE 5-7
A purple ocean
If you have found a blue or at least purple ocean, you can suggest spe-
cific ways that a killer UX and/or business model could help knock a 
product idea out of the park. That’s when we, as UX strategists, can pro-
vide real value that could determine success or failure.
In short, your goal is to determine if there’s room to win, and that’s 
when you need to address the opportunities based on the research. Now, 
I’m not aware of any specific guideline for how to create a Findings 
Brief. But based on what I’ve seen and delivered over the years, I’ve 
noticed some primary components. I’m going to walk you through a 
sample Findings Brief so you can get a sense of what they are. (You can 
also learn what Geoff Katz puts in his Creative Briefs in Chapter 10.)
FINDINGS BRIEF, SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION/GOALS
The introduction presents the goals of the brief and tries to hook the 
stakeholder into, a) reading it, and b) reviewing it with an open mind. 
You might find that you need to rewrite this page several times to get it 

104  |   UX STRATEGY
right. Don’t be too afraid to draft a quick summary of what you think 
this page should be, and then return to edit it after you’ve pulled the 
rest of your data together.
Here are some elements to include on this page (see also Figure 5-8):
State your purpose.
[Your team] conducted a competitive analysis on [market or mar-
kets] to see what other products do [client’s value prop]. Be sure to 
state the client’s value proposition clearly so that there is no confu-
sion as to what you were focusing on. Include the month and year 
in which the study was conducted, because the analysis is truly 
a snapshot in time that will become outdated as the competitive 
landscape evolves.
Make a general statement about the current marketplace. 
You could say something like, “There are tons of sites that allow 
trading.” Or, “The market is splintered into these core groups….” 
You might also include an introduction to the distinct competitor 
subgroups from your deep dive into the spreadsheet or overview of 
the business models at play. At the very least, list all the compet-
itors you looked at, broken out by direct competitor and indirect 
competitor.

 5. Conducting Competitive Analysis   |  105
FIGURE 5-8
Introduction to Competitive Analysis Findings Brief slide

106  |   UX STRATEGY
FINDINGS BRIEF, SECTION 2: DIRECT COMPETITORS
In this section, you should highlight at least two or three of the top 
direct competitors and why their value propositions are relevant to 
yours. How you choose to showcase them depends on what showcase 
will best support your recommendations at the end of the brief (see 
Figure 5-9). Be sure to include screenshots of home pages or features 
that you want to point out, especially if they offer a visually appealing 
design, a solid UX, or insight into the viability of the business model. 
For example, there are many astrology sites. They all have a “Here’s 
your horoscope” feature, but some of them have better personaliza-
tion or superior content, and therefore they deliver a more powerful 
experience.
You can also discuss each direct competitor, mentioning specific things 
that give them a competitive advantage (see Figures 5-10 and 5-11). You 
can use arrows to point to aspects of the UX that you want to call out 
to your team and stakeholders. Call out a competitor if it’s a serious 
threat—if it has a large market share, if it caters to your intended cus-
tomers, if its product is solid, if it has copious financing to scale quickly. 
Point out features or layouts that you believe should be replicated. Also 
discuss any of the competitors’ weaknesses. What features should be 
avoided? Which competitor did something particularly badly? Or can 
this negative aspect of its UX be an opportunity for your product?

110  |   UX STRATEGY
FINDINGS BRIEF, SECTION 3: INDIRECT COMPETITORS
With indirect competitors, you want to demonstrate what they’re doing 
right with respect to your value proposition (see Figure 5-12). The negative 
aspects are less consequential because they are not direct competitors. 
FIGURE 5-12
Indirect competitor slide

 5. Conducting Competitive Analysis   |  111
Look for clues in these areas:
•	 Revenue streams for monetization
•	 Mental model for the navigation system or transaction flow
•	 Features that simplify the experience
•	 New and interesting visual treatments and animations
•	 Improved messaging and content strategy
Use arrows to point out aspects of the UX that are relevant to the solu-
tion that your team is pursuing. Explain why you’re pointing them out 
and what insight they offer into market opportunities. You will orga-
nize these points based on what you want the stakeholder or team to 
understand by the end of the brief.
FINDINGS BRIEF, SECTION 4: COOL FEATURES FROM  
INFLUENCERS
In this section, write about any cool or relevant UX features or find-
ings about the marketplace that might not come from competitors 
(see Figures 5-13 and 5-14). I call these types of products “influenc-
ers” because they are not in your product’s competitive landscape but 
could offer insight into your product’s value innovation. An influencer 
doesn’t even have to be an online product. As long as it has an inter-
action, transaction, or capability you’re trying to accomplish, it’s an 
influencer.
Often, an influencer might have a very cool feature that could be the 
differentiator your product is looking for. A good example of this is how 
Airbnb utilized the Yelp map functionality. Yelp is not a direct or indi-
rect competitor for Airbnb, but Airbnb saw how refining a user’s results 
set by zooming in and out of a map might be a useful differentiator for 
its subletting service. It allowed the influence, and that map feature is 
now a very distinctive feature of Airbnb!
In the course of your research and analysis, it’s probable that you’ve 
already identified or noted influencers. Maybe you sighed to your-
self and thought, “If only this product was more like [insert product 
name].” That product is most likely a good influencer. It’s also possible 
that an influencer inspired your original value proposition. For exam-
ple, Paul the movie producer was originally inspired by Amazon’s Wish 
List feature. Even though Amazon.com itself would have been neither a 

112  |   UX STRATEGY
direct nor indirect competitor to his product, the UX of Amazon could 
definitely influence the product in a positive direction and distinguish 
it from the competition. Therefore, it should be presented here in the 
brief in a way that is similar to the direct and indirect competition.

FIGURE 5-14

114  |   UX STRATEGY
FINDINGS BRIEF, SECTION 5: TAKING A STAND/YOUR  
RECOMMENDATIONS
This is the most important section. You need to voice your opinion in a 
strong, authoritative way. This summary should be an honest and bal-
anced assessment about what the current competitive landscape looks 
like (see Figure 5-15). However, you don’t want to leave your client with 
nowhere to go. Think about what the client’s original vision was for the 
product and what aspect of that vision can be realized no matter if the 
market is blue, red, or purple.
If your analysis supports the value proposition, your recommendations 
will probably suggest specific ways to capitalize on market opportu-
nities and gaps through the user experience. Your recommendations 
might answer these questions:
•	 Can a specific function such as the Browse or Search capability be 
improved to help customers discover or find something that cur-
rently takes a lot of work to find? (See Chapter 6.)
•	 How can you make the product experience more personalized? 
(See Chapters 6, 8, and 9.)
•	 How can your team create or optimize a funnel to increase engage-
ment? (See Chapter 9.)
•	 How can your team take advantage of something like social net-
works to drive people to your funnel? (See Chapter 9.)
If your analysis reveals that the value proposition is facing certain risks, 
your recommendations need to pivot on the targeted customer segment 
or the specific problem. You would need to recommend that your team or 
stakeholder pursue a different version of the value proposition and/or busi-
ness model. As such, your comments might try to address these scenarios:
•	 Is this an expensive endeavor to take on or are there ways to de-risk 
the vision by experimenting with Minimum Viable Products 
(MVPs)? (See Chapters 7 and 8.)
•	 Do you see another possible angle that addresses aspects of the 
stakeholder’s vision, or do you recommend that the team pivot on 
the customer or its problem? (See Chapters 3 and 8.)
•	 Does more research need to be conducted to really know if the 
value proposition is viable, such as with Guerrilla User Research 
(see Chapter 8) or using landing page A/B tests? (See Chapter 9.)

 5. Conducting Competitive Analysis   |  115
FIGURE 5-15
Summary slide
Whether your recommendations are positive or negative, you are required 
to take a stand about the viability of the product you’re researching. 
Sometimes, as in the case of Paul the movie producer, your recommenda-
tions aren’t what the client wants to hear. It’s just reality, and sometimes 

116  |   UX STRATEGY
that’s just how it plays out. Yet, the reason you conduct research and ana-
lyze data is to learn about the real potential of the product so that you can 
make empirical calls about how people will spend their time and energy. 
You might learn that the client’s initial vision faces a lot of challenges. 
You might also learn that there are better alternatives to the product. It’s 
your job to analyze the data and to present these insights with solid sup-
porting evidence.
You are now at the end of the Competitive Analysis Findings Brief, and 
you understand with absolute certainty what kind of marketplace your 
product is facing. You are now at a crossroads:
•	 If you’re in a red ocean, you need to ask, “Why am I creating some-
thing in a saturated marketplace?” You might need to go back to 
the earlier chapters to reassess your customer segment, customer 
problem, or competitive landscape.
•	 If you’re in a purple or blue ocean, move on to Chapter 6. You’re at 
the threshold of possibility—to build an innovative product! Now, 
you just need to resolve how to capitalize on the opportunity.
Presentation and Takeaways
It’s not uncommon for the client to only glance at the spreadsheet and appreci-
ate that the UX strategist has done his homework. Thus, include the spreadsheet 
as an appendix, so the client can reference the raw data as needed and when 
convenient. I recommend downloading an Excel version of the Google spread-
sheet so that the client can look at it offline or share it with others without having 
to link to the cloud version. You can also include the link to the cloud version if 
you expect this exercise to continue and potentially become collaborative.
Recap
A thorough competitive analysis requires an organized effort to gather infor-
mation about the competition. In this chapter, you learned that the competi-
tive analysis helps you gain insight into current trends as to what is or is not 
working. Knowing the unknowns helps your team to not repeat mistakes 
but instead make good ideas better. A good analysis also exposes gaps and 
opportunities for your product to take advantage of in the marketplace.
In Chapter 6, you will use what you’ve learned to create new value 
through differentiation and innovation focused specifically on the UX 
and/or business model.

Storyboarding Value Innovation
“Reaching beyond existing demand is a key component of achieving 
value innovation.”*
—W. CHAN KIM AND RENÉE MAUGBORGNE,  
BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY
If your goal is to invent, you need to look for the benefits 
that will make your product indispensable to users. That means you 
need to understand how to break out the big UX moments that need 
to show incredible value before you move into a formal design phase. 
To get there, you need to mash up the principles of Tenet 2, Value 
Innovation, with Tenet 4, Killer UX (Figure 6-1).
If you’re a seasoned design professional, be aware that this chapter is 
not about pushing pixels or making cool-looking deliverables. Instead, 
it’s about using design hacks to focus your team sharply on identify-
ing and maximizing your product’s potential value innovation. It’s 
about accelerating your thinking through your product’s ultimate value 
proposition.

Tenet 2 and Tenet 4: Value Innovation and Killer UX
Timing Really Is Everything
In 1990, I devised an interactive animation that fused my software 
design skills with my love of experimental art and music for my mas-
ter’s thesis at the New York University Interactive Telecommunications 
Program. It was a mash-up of technology and art jammed onto an 800 
KB floppy disk. The electronic experience was programmed for the 
Macintosh in HyperCard and VideoWorks. The disk featured an inter-
active table of contents with links to animations of poetry, games, and 
rants combined with an industrial noise soundtrack. After numerous 
sleepless nights, I succeeded in my objective—to create what was to be 
the world’s first animated electronic magazine. It worked, played, and 
all fit on one disk! This was Cyber Rag #1, which you can get a glimpse 
of in Figure 6-2.

FIGURE 6-2
Cyber Rag (1990) electronic magazine on floppy disk
Sure, there were some competitors in the marketplace. For instance, 
there were nonanimated HyperCard stacks with tech-centric content. 
There was also an interactive art disk that ran on the less popular 
Commodore Amiga and could be downloaded from a bulletin-board 
service (BBS). But there was no other digital product like Cyber Rag, 
and I saw the golden opportunity to make digital content more main-
stream and accessible to the masses by placing it on a Mac-based floppy 
disk.
However, it was one thing to create a completely original electronic 
magazine on a disk and quite another to get it out to the general pub-
lic, have them recognize it for its originality, and buy it. Much as in 
Chapter 3, my younger self had to figure out who her customers were. 
I eventually learned that my customers weren’t the computer nerds of 

120  |   UX STRATEGY
the 1990s who might download an electronic mag for free off a BBS. 
Even I did not own a modem (yet). That’s when I realized that my Cyber 
Rag #1 wasn’t just tied into the experience of a new electronic publish-
ing medium. It also aligned with the DIY attitude of the Generation X 
who self-published their own fanzines about pop cultures. They just 
didn’t do it digitally yet. Somehow, I had to reach my Gen X peers in 
independent book and record stores. This meant that besides creating 
the physical product, I also had to somehow package it, market it, and 
distribute it.
A typical Saturday in my mid-20s involved saving copies of Cyber Rag 
onto hundreds of floppy disks. I glued on labels, printed packaging, 
sealed the packages, and then I’d walk into independent bookstores 
in New York City and Los Angeles to pitch my product to the own-
ers. Their typical reaction was bewilderment because they had no con-
cept of my value proposition at the time. Some owners didn’t even have 
access to a Macintosh to preview the product for themselves. How were 
they to know if the disks weren’t empty, corrupted, or filled with hard-
core porn? I learned that the best tactic was to front the product initially 
to the storeowners to lessen their fear of selling an unfamiliar publish-
ing medium.
But the disks sold well. Customers were curious and willing to dole out 
six dollars to experience their first electronic magazine on a computer 
screen. Typically, a store would call me within a month after my initial 
pitch to ask me for more product. When I began to gain notoriety in the 
press, I started selling thousands of disks (Cyber Rag #1, #2, #3 and 
Electronic Hollywood I and II). The disks were on sale in independent 
bookstores, in art galleries, and via mail order; they even sold to people 
all over the world. I had no business model except to keep publishing 
disks until “something” happened.
Then, “something” finally did happen. After two years, I came home 
from my job as a typesetter to find a message on my answering machine.
“Hi Jaime! This is Henry from EMI Records. We are calling on behalf 
of Billy Idol who just bought one of your disk magazines. He wants 
to see if you are interested in working with him on his new project. 
Can you please have your people call our people to arrange a meeting? 
Thanks.”

 6. Storyboarding Value Innovation   |  121
I was excited but also confused. Who were “my” people? Was I going to 
have to ask my mom to call Billy Idol?
My mom didn’t call. I did. And I got the gig.
In 1993, EMI released Cyberpunk, Billy Idol’s new album on a CD that 
featured a floppy disk in a special-edition digipak, as shown in Figure 
6-3.
FIGURE 6-3
Billy Idol Cyberpunk album (1993) with floppy disk
It was the first-ever commercially released interactive press kit (IPK). 
The floppy disk was essentially a customized version—a “Save As” in 
Macromedia Director—of my software, bringing my innovation score 
up from one to two. I was excited and thought this venture was going 
to make my career. From here, I would finally be able to financially 
support myself as an interface designer and electronic publisher. Soon 
everybody from David Bowie to Michael Jackson would call me for cus-
tom disk magazines for their future albums. Not just my early adopters 
but the entire world would finally “get” how cool this new electronic 
publishing medium was. The ocean seemed so blue!
Sadly, here’s where I hit bumps in the road. Sure, I had successfully 
innovated a new digital medium, found a blue ocean for it, and pushed 
it into two user groups (indie bookstore customers and rock-star musi-
cians) who loved it. The thing was, though, Billy Idol was no longer 
the big celebrity he used to be. Instead, critics slammed him, some 
calling the album pretentious for jumping on the cyberculture band-
wagon.† His new songs gained little traction on MTV or the radio, and 
†	  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk_(album)

122  |   UX STRATEGY
the album flopped. There was also a huge issue with the packaging. 
The digipaks were so bulky they took up almost three times as much 
space as a regular CD. This made it hard for record stores to stock it. 
The Billy Idol Cyberpunk album literally did not have the right product/
market “fit.”
I was never hired to make an IPK or custom floppy-disk project again. 
However, I did learn some valuable lessons.
Lessons Learned
•	 Timing is everything. Even if you are first-to-market with a disrup-
tive innovation, there are no guarantees of success. In the case of 
electronic publishing, digital media really should be distributed 
digitally. But in 1993, this wasn’t possible. The first web browser 
for the Internet was still being invented.
•	 Context is key. My own floppy disk magazines were “compelling” 
not just because of the new technology. The content on them, 
which featured anti–Silicon Valley rants and tips on sneaking into 
expensive tech tradeshows, was actually a symbiotic part of the 
value innovation. Billy Idol’s album marketing content was per-
ceived as more of a gimmick.
•	 There are many aspects to building successful digital products. 
Inventing them is just one small part of the fun. You also need 
sustainable adoption, scalability, wide distribution, revenue 
streams, and a team bigger than yourself. Basically, you need an 
innovative business model.
Techniques for Value Innovation Discovery
You have already learned that by doing competitive research your team 
can gain insights into what digital products and services exist in the 
marketplace of your value proposition. Obviously, though, this research 
isn’t just to help your team replicate other products or improve them 
only marginally. Instead, you want to create new value with a superior 
invention.
To have a sustainable and marketable product, UX strategy requires 
you to balance business goals with user value. Even though you aren’t 
creating the first electronic magazine or even the first ever website, 
your product should still have a unique something to engage customers 

 6. Storyboarding Value Innovation   |  123
in new and different ways. This is especially important if you’re deal-
ing with a free digital product. Your future customers need to want to 
choose your solution over any other because, a) it’s significantly more 
efficient than what’s currently out there, b) it solves a pain point they 
didn’t know they had, and/or c) it creates an undeniable desire where 
none existed before. Basically, you create a leap in value by taking 
advantage of the uncontested blue-ocean market space through value 
innovation. 
The value innovation in your value proposition manifests itself as a 
unique feature set. Features are product characteristics that deliver 
benefits to the user. In most cases, fewer features equals more value. 
Here are the top four “secret sauce” value innovation patterns of feature 
sets that I’ve observed in the digital realm:
•	 The product offers a new mash-up of features from competitors 
and relevant UX influencers. The hybrid then offers a much better 
existing alternative for accomplishing a task. (Meetup + a payment 
system = Eventbrite)
•	 The product provides an innovative “slice” or a twist to a value 
proposition from existing larger platforms. (Google Maps + crowd-
sourcing = Waze)
•	 The product consolidates formerly disparate user experiences into 
one single simple and crucial solution. It becomes the one-stop 
shop for a user task. (Vine or Instagram with regard to simplifying 
how to take and share mobile videos and photos)
•	 The product brings two separate and distinct user segments to the 
table to negotiate a deal that had not been possible before, thus 
revolutionizing those users’ world. (subletters + travelers = Airbnb)
As you can see, the patterns aren’t about building replicas of existing 
products. Instead, you want to build on existing design conventions 
and take those capabilities to the next level. Great ideas are just waiting 
to be discovered in unexpected, unassuming places. You just need to 
peruse the Web like a hunter searching for prey!
The rest of this chapter examines poaching techniques for discover-
ing new opportunities for value innovation via these four patterns. 
Poaching has traditionally been defined as the illegal hunting, killing, 

124  |   UX STRATEGY
or capturing of wild animals, usually associated with land-use rights.‡ 
However, there is nothing illegal about poaching features and interac-
tion patterns that are the general approach to solving a common type of 
problem. You’ll be borrowing these kernels from different places and 
putting them together in a brand-new context to create value innova-
tion. This is how you don’t just beat the competition, you make them 
completely irrelevant.
The four techniques you are about to learn are how to:
•	 Identify the key experiences
•	 Take advantage of UX influencers
•	 Do feature comparisons
•	 Storyboard the value innovation
Be aware that these techniques are more for your personal or your 
team’s edification. They are not necessarily deliverables that you will 
present to a client.
IDENTIFY THE KEY EXPERIENCES
Generally when the word “key” precedes a term, it means that the 
words that follow are mission critical. We see the word used in numer-
ous business terms such as “key leverage points,” “key performance 
indicators” (KPIs), and “key stakeholders.” The first time I saw the term 
“key experience” was at a Lean UX workshop presentation I co-taught 
with long-time UX guru Lane Halley (see Figure 6-4).
‡	 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poaching

 6. Storyboarding Value Innovation   |  125
FIGURE 6-4
Key experience slide at Lean UX presentation in Los Angeles, July 2013 (with 
Lane Halley in the left corner pretending it’s not her slide)
At the lecture, Lane showed a slide that read “A Minimum Viable 
Product (MVP) is just enough product to validate your key experiences 
(value proposition).” Even though Lane later claimed that she didn’t 
invent the term, I took her definition as the gospel and immediately 
integrated it into my techniques.
For your purposes, the key experience is the feature set that defines 
your value innovation. It must exist in order for your product to have a 
competitive advantage. It defines the experience that sets your product 
apart from all others. It might be an exotic permutation of features, or 
it can be a single significant feature (as I described in the patterns ear-
lier). For example, in his book Microinteractions,§ Dan Saffer describes 
how “Twitter is built entirely around a single interaction: sending a 
140-character message.” And, as discussed in Chapter 2, Twitter has 
completely revolutionized the way people communicate in the world.
To get your idea juices flowing on the key experience, ask yourself these 
questions:
§	  Saffer, Dan. Microinteractions, O’Reilly, 2013.

126  |   UX STRATEGY
•	 What will make your provisional personas (hypothesized custom-
ers) love this product?
•	 What moment or part of the user’s journey makes this product 
unique?
•	 Based on your competitive research and analysis, what scenario or 
feature resolves a big shortfall?
•	 What kind of workarounds are your potential customers currently 
doing to accomplish their goals?
Your answers might just lead you to the key experience that you’ll even-
tually deliver through a killer UX design!
However, be careful about confusing your key experience with a list 
of features. As is described in Chapter 4 and shown in Figure 6-5, this 
happened to one of my students, Ena, when she took her first pass on 
defining the key experience for Airbnb for Weddings.
FIGURE 6-5
Ena’s incorrect key experiences for Airbnb for Weddings (which I asked her to 
redo)
Ena identified six complex key experiences, which raises an obvious 
red flag. If “key” means most important, how can there be six? Instead, 
she created a really important feature list. In the fully baked 1.0 version 
of her product, it would probably be a good idea to include all these 
features because brides-to-be will probably want to perform all those 
functions through the site. But the purpose of the key experience is 
to be more minimalistic. What feature set is the most integral part of 

 6. Storyboarding Value Innovation   |  127
the value proposition? If you look at Twitter again, think about all the 
features that are part of the platform: direct messaging, the newsfeed, 
retweeting. Yet, the key experience is the 140 characters. The feature 
set that creates it is a text field that allows only 140 characters. It is what 
defines and separates Twitter’s UX from all others for all its users.
So I asked Ena to take another pass at the assignment. I asked her to 
really think hard about what she learned from her competitive analysis. 
I also gave her some more specific questions to ponder:
•	 What is an example of the most important thing the customer can 
do with your product that they can’t do with other competitors?
•	 What is the pain point that you are trying to solve that is not cur-
rently being solved by competitors?
•	 How would your solution be presented to the customers on a 
screen? Is it an interactive interface or a displayed result? Express 
the benefit that users will see.
•	 Finally, what would customers do next after they saw this screen? 
Would they realize the value proposition? Again, express the bene-
fit as a scenario that the user will see.
Based on those questions, Ena came up with something better, as is 
demonstrated in Figure 6-6.
FIGURE 6-6
Ena’s second attempt at the key experiences for Airbnb for Weddings (which I 
approved)
Yes, a lot of features were left off Ena’s second version; when you are 
performing UX strategy, you need to carefully pick your battles. You 
want to ruthlessly focus your team and resources on the indispensible 
benefit of the product. In this case, the answer for Ena was to focus on 

128  |   UX STRATEGY
the experiences that would separate her Airbnb for Weddings from the 
mothership platform Airbnb. The differentiation is what the key expe-
rience needs to express.
However, Bita and Ena (who eventually teamed up during the Airbnb 
for Weddings apprenticeship) realized that they could come up with 
an even better key experience. During the customer-discovery phase, 
they learned that a major pain point for both their customers was orga-
nizing all the vendors. Because weddings are supposed to be one-time 
events, the learning curve for a bride-to-be is really steep. It takes a lot 
of time and energy to learn how to book a venue, plan a menu, order 
flowers, arrange parking for guests, all for for a one-time deal. Bita and 
Ena began to wonder if they could make the planning process the key 
experience for their users by packaging it somehow. And they came up 
with their solution by utilizing their UX influencers.
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF UX INFLUENCERS
In Chapter 5, you learned about UX influencers. They are not your 
direct or indirect competitors; their value proposition has absolutely 
no relation to your own. However, their user experiences and features 
can provide insight into your product’s value innovation. The trick is 
that you need to think outside of the box. Remember how one of our 
value innovation patterns is mixing and matching disparate feature 
sets? Well, that’s what happens here. Sometimes by jamming pieces 
that don’t seem to fit together, you get amazing disruption. You just 
need to take a leap of faith to see how a noncompetitive product or ser-
vice could be bent to serve your needs.
For example, Bita and Ena found inspiration in DIRECTV and the paid 
bundles that it offers its users. That company has absolutely nothing to 
do with the Airbnb for Weddings value proposition, but the UX around 
the TV bundles was very well thought out. Obviously, DIRECTV takes 
its UX very seriously, and Bita and Ena thought this type of UX would 
make an excellent starting point for their key experience.
First, let’s visit DIRECTV to see how it present its TV packages. Take 
a look at Figure 6-7; there are quite a few interesting ideas about how 
to group things together and allow people to customize their own TV 
package. You might even see a glimmer of a potential new business 
model. Look closely. (Hint: it’s the concept of a turnkey solutions.)

 6. Storyboarding Value Innovation   |  129
FIGURE 6-7
DIRECTV package (example of great information design)

130  |   UX STRATEGY
When you visit DIRECTV, the first thing you do is type in your zip 
code. A result set immediately appears presenting you with a handful 
of packages. It’s not a lot, but it’s just enough for a user to work with. 
That gave Bita and Ena their first clue for how to present their key expe-
rience: do not present more than five packages to a bride-to-be.
Although each package has the same design and layout, they are dif-
ferentiated by background color. That gave Bita and Ena a second clue: 
present wedding packages with an obvious differentiation mechanism. 
Perhaps they could use different background colors. But an even better 
idea might be to use a recognizable image or icon that denotes the dis-
tinction among the packages. For example, a high-end wedding pack-
age might show a limousine that says “Just Married” on the back win-
dow, whereas an economy package could show a regular compact car. 
Clues three and four came when they noticed how DIRECTV displayed 
packages by price from lowest to highest. As the user scrolls down, the 
more expensive packages list more benefits and take up twice as much 
space.
You’ll catch clues by looking at all the details and figuring out how to 
use them for your product. Ideally, you will improve on the concepts, 
taking them up a notch on the design ladder for your product. But, 
you’re not trying to design anything just now. Instead, you’re aiming to 
pluck out the best ideas. After you have them, you’ll mock them up into 
a storyboard to demonstrate the value innovation.
DO FEATURE COMPARISONS
Before you begin creating mock-ups and storyboards, be sure that you 
look for more than just one comparison reference. Research and iden-
tify multiple (three to five) instances of a similar user feature, and put 
all those references into one document. This way, you can compare dif-
ferent approaches to a single UX problem. The comparison findings 
can be useless or inspirational. Still, you are looking for new models, 
and you want to think beyond the familiar to conceive of better ways to 
browse, search, filter, share, and reach a user objective.
This deconstructed approach is called a feature comparison. You might 
find it contradictory, especially given that in Chapter 5 I agreed with 
Steve Blank, who deplores creating a bloated feature requirements 
list. Nevertheless, now that you are just using tools for discovery with-
out necessarily showing the client, a feature comparison can be very 

 6. Storyboarding Value Innovation   |  131
helpful to identify opportunities for value innovation. It takes all the 
puzzle pieces out of the box and puts them onto the table in plain sight. 
Then, you can pick out the best pieces and components to build a new 
interaction pattern. You do whatever is necessary to poach elements 
and then stitch together a superior UX.
A feature comparison can even take you deeper into the research you 
already have. When you did your competitor research, you created and 
captured a short list of the most interesting features of your direct and 
indirect competitors, as depicted in Figure 6-8. You can return to this 
list to hunt out your inspiration.
FIGURE 6-8
Features learned from the competitive research
The answer easily could be staring you in the face. Or, you might need 
to go a step farther to make your value innovation discovery. You might 
need to go back to the competitors’ websites, take screenshots of the 
features, and really study them.
For instance, several years ago, a multinational conglomerate hired me 
to design the UX of an ebook reader for the iPhone. Because there were 
already several readers on the market (Stanza, eReader, Kindle, Nook), I 
did my competitive research and analysis. I downloaded them and cap-
tured my data. I captured screenshots of many different functions, fea-
tures, and experiences, such as how to browse for a book, the UI of the 
loading screen, the navigation of the table of contents, and how to high-
light and annotate. Basically, I documented any feature that touched 
the key experiences I had to design. I then imported all of my screen-
shots into iPhoto and organized them based on their relationships to 
one another. As my final step, I arranged them onto large canvasses 

132  |   UX STRATEGY
in Adobe InDesign so that I could compare them visually side-by-side. 
Based on these comparisons, I took notes when ideas occurred to me. 
Figure 6-9 presents a sample of that document.
FIGURE 6-9
eBook reader feature comparison of adding a note or highlight
The process took at least four hours, and the client didn’t ask me or pay 
me to do any of it. In the end, however, I was able to observe and quan-
tify best practices, lame practices, and the really interesting approaches 
the competitors were creating for users to accomplish tasks with formal 
or newfangled design patterns. It also saved me endless design hours. I 
didn’t need to design the project from scratch, because I didn’t have to 
reinvent the wheel. Some other benefits included the following:
•	 Seeing the common user flows through the apps so that I could 
quickly make an application or site map.
•	 Recognizing the patterns and common ways for helping users 
accomplish their goal. In other words, if I wanted to lure customers 
over from another application to my own, I could determine user 
expectations in advance.

 6. Storyboarding Value Innovation   |  133
•	 Avoiding creating something totally new and making the UI more 
complicated because I now knew what my competition was already 
doing well.
•	 Dealing with insane stakeholders or a HIPPO (Highest Paid Person’s 
Opinion) who, based on no empirical evidence, thought that he knew 
the best way to do my job. With my well-researched evidence, I was able 
to lead the UX design the way I thought best 95 percent of the time.
Using a feature comparison on competitors and UX influencers, you can 
compare everything from visual design, to interaction design, to feature 
sets, to how the content is displayed. The objective is to avoid being as 
clueless about your competitive environment as our friend in Figure 6-10 
clearly is. Sometimes, you can capture the necessary iPhone or Android 
screenshots from the competition’s store or you can just spend the money 
($10 to $30) on the applications. Charge the client, or pay for it yourself 
and bill your client for an extra hour. Ultimately, the comparison will 
save you and your client time and money. It will open your mind, espe-
cially after the deep, focused dive you took in Chapters 4 and 5.
Personal Disruption
The big payoff of exposing yourself to new experiences outside of your 
comfort zone is that they make it possible for us to grow as people. You 
change when you disrupt habitual patterns, and it affords you new ways of 
doing, being, and experiencing. For example:
•	 When I took up ballet at age 45, I finally learned how to stand up 
straight.
•	 When I took up gardening at age 42, I finally learned how to 
make a tasty fresh salad.
•	 When I had my son at age 39, I finally learned how to slow down 
and just let some things happen.
Looking at everyday things with fresh eyes helps us to look beyond the 
obvious and unearth new mental models.
Disruption, whether in our professional or personal lives, breaks down the 
self-imposed walls that lock us into conceiving or designing the same thing 
over and over again.

FIGURE 6-10
Not being aware of your surroundings is like the old myth about an ostrich 
hiding from danger by burying its head in the sand.
STORYBOARD THE VALUE INNOVATION
Now that you have identified the key experience of your product, you 
will want to stitch those moments together into a narrative thread oth-
erwise known as a “story.” And obviously, with your emphasis on the 
visuals from your feature comparisons, it will be great tool to do that.
The storyboarding process has been around since German filmmaker 
Lotte Reiniger first drew and colored storyboards for her animated fea-
ture film, The Adventures of Prince Achmed, in 1926.¶ Since then, they 
have become versatile tools used for advertising campaigns, comics, 
motion pictures, software design, and various other business pro-
¶	  http://meganratner.squarespace.com/lotte-reiniger-art-on-paper

 6. Storyboarding Value Innovation   |  135
cesses. The reason is that a storyboard promotes visual thinking. Or, 
as the authors of the book Game Storming: A Playbook for Innovators, 
Rulebreakers, and Changemakers,** write, “[It is a] visioning exercise 
[that] allows participants to imagine and create possibilities.”
Three steps to storyboarding value innovation
The goal of a storyboard is to tell the story of your key experience(s) 
visually. You want to use the format to zero in on the most important 
components of the experience. Say more with less, and finish with a 
happy ending in that the problem for your user is solved. Here is my 
recommended framework for building (and presenting) a storyboard:
Step 1: Create your list of panels.
Keep in mind that you do not want to demonstrate all the features of 
the product (as Ena incorrectly did when she first mapped out her key 
experiences). You are only showing the most “valuable” moments of 
your customer’s journey through the storyboard panels. Some of these 
moments will impact the interface design, and other moments will 
actually occur offline. Show the progression of the entire experience 
regardless of whether the experience takes 20 minutes (such as Uber) 
or two months (Airbnb) in real time. 
For Bita and Ena, this meant showing how their bride-to-be experi-
enced her dream wedding coming true rather than showing how 
account registration on Airbnb for Weddings works. Here are the pan-
els they stitched together:
1.	 Bride-to-be is looking for a beautiful and affordable venue online.
2.	 She finds a result set of two to three listings.
3.	She sees a detail view of an awesome listing.
4.	 She selects a package (venue, food, flowers).
5.	She receives a confirmation of venue/tour/submission.
6.	 She gets married on the beach!

Rulebreakers, and Changemakers. O’Reilly, 2010.

136  |   UX STRATEGY
Step 2: Decide on your visual format (digital montages versus  
sketching on paper).
Some people know how to draw or sketch. Others (like me) cannot 
even draw a meaningful stick figure. What matters the most is that you 
choose a format that is fast and easy for you and your team to pull your 
storyboard together. If you are fast in Photoshop, just mash up some 
interface ideas together as graphics. Do not waste time wireframing 
a storyboard. It’s fine to use photos from Google or to slightly modify 
screen grabs from other sites. Create, draw, or gather all your images 
and make certain that they are the same approximate aspect ratio and 
that they fit nicely onto your canvas. There is no reason to design an 
entire user interface at this stage. Instead, zoom into the components 
of the interface that illustrate the best concept.
Ena decided to use a mix of photos she found on Google Images. She 
then mocked up her comps quickly in Photoshop. She also used the 
exact layout from DIRECTV for her results set and the detail view of 
the listing because it’s not important for her to design something new 
right now. She just needs to show how the UX might work.
Step 3: Lay out your storyboard on a canvas, add captions below  
each panel.
Now, review your storyboard. Does it flow well? Is it concise? Is it easy 
to follow the customer’s ideal experience? If so, you’ve successfully sto-
ryboarded your value innovation. Keep the captions brief and in lower-
case—less than two lines. Again, less is more.
Figure 6-11 and Figure 6-12 present Bita and Ena’s storyboards, respec-
tively. Don’t they give you a good sense about what the value innovation 
for their product will be like?

As I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter, storyboards are not 
necessarily deliverables. There are cases for storyboards in other work 
environments where they are super helpful to pitch ideas, but for now, 
we just are using them to map out the key experience in a narrative 
context.
Business Models and Value Innovation
I’ve discussed how to do value innovation feature poaching in regard 
to the UX, but don’t forget that they also can be and should apply to 
your business model. The reason is that value innovation is a competi-
tive advantage that ultimately combines cost leadership with differenti-
ation. This means that your killer UX is related to the business model, 
and vice versa. These two factors combined will also ultimately leave 
your competition in the dust and sustain your product in the dynamic 
marketplace.
Let’s take a look at a marketplace that I wish I had less personal expe-
rience with: online dating, and three platforms that exemplify it, eHar-
mony, OkCupid, and Tinder.
eHarmony’s business model is based on a monthly subscription ser-
vice. Its value proposition relies on its matching algorithm which 
focuses on the core traits of its clients, such as agreeableness, spiritu-
ality, and extroversion. The onboarding requires users to answer hun-
dreds of questions before they are sent a highly curated set of matches. 
To get more matches, you need to close out the ones that you have. 
There is no way to browse profiles on your own. It even provides tools 
for a more guided communication process, because the platform is 
designed for “marriage-minded people.”
OkCupid is the polar opposite of eHarmony, even though it exists in 
the same marketplace. Its business model is free to customers, and 
over time, its revenue stream evolved from paid advertising, such as 
with Facebook, to a premium feature service. But the value proposition 
is intrinsically wrapped up in a powerful UX by which users can filter 
matches based on qualitative and quantitative data points. Users can 
also customize their own algorithm by answering highly personalized 
prompts in a polling feature. The customers are always completely in 
control of how wide or narrow they cast their nets while OkCupid reaps 
the benefits of the user data and premium revenue stream.

140  |   UX STRATEGY
The latest and most innovative of the online dating products is Tinder. 
This mobile-only contender already has more than 30 million users†† 
and is quickly chipping away at OkCupid’s value proposition. Tinder is 
all about ease-of-use and immediacy. As Figure 6-13 shows, users sign 
in with a real or fake Facebook account, upload a few photos, maybe 
write a bio, and are up and running 15 minutes later.
Here’s where Tinder’s value innovation kicks in by inverting the histor-
ical mental model of dating sites by only allowing users to interact with 
each other once both parties express mutual interest. With Tinder, 
users are constantly served up cards that are only curated by distance, 
age, and gender. That’s key experience #1. The user swipes left if she

doesn’t like the profile. She swipes right if she does. If both users swipe 
right, they can send messages to each other in a native message system. 
Unlike other dating sites, Tinder provides matches within a one-mile 
radius. That’s key experience #2. If you live in a traffic-heavy city like 
Los Angeles or New York, you can zoom in on suitors who live within 
walking distance. So what started as a hookup app for millennials has 
now evolved into the go-to place for people of all ages to fall swiftly into 
an any-length relationship.
In addition to that, Tinder didn’t initially launch with a identified rev-
enue stream because its business model first required mass adoption. 
Now, Tinder is experimenting with revenue streams such as selling 
targeted advertising or a paid membership (Figure 6-14), which offers 
users more sophisticated functionality.
Here are the points that I want to make:
•	 All these products have completely distinct user experiences and 
business models.
•	 They all have had undeniable success competing in the same cus-
tomer pool.

What makes each of them innovative is its unique way of hooking users 
through a permutation of features and business model components, 
through their finely tuned different parts.
Recap
In this chapter we covered a lot of material and concepts related to ide-
ation and connecting ideas to your final objective: articulating your 
value innovation! I explained how value innovation for digital products 
is accomplished by focusing on the primary utility of a product. You 
learned about the importance of key experiences (showing the value 
proposition) and how creating a product that is the same or only slightly 
better than the competition is a waste of time. I showed you how to 
identify UX influencers. You learned about feature poaching, which 
you can use to pluck features, interaction patterns, and business model 
ideas from other products and then mash them up to create something 
new. Finally, you learned how to tell stories with storyboards that will 
connect your customers’ journey with the value innovation.
Now, it’s time to leave this fantasyland behind and see if you’re innovat-
ing in reality by creating prototypes to run experiments.

Creating Prototypes 
for Experiments
“The premature outlay of huge amounts of money in pursuit of the 
wrong strategy is the thing to avoid. You need to have an experimen-
tal mindset.”*
—CLAYTON CHRISTENSEN
The premise of Lean Startup is to get feedback early and often 
in order to validate that you are on the right path, which is also the fon-
dation of Tenet 3.† Eric Ries and Steve Blank insist that it’s important 
to run experiments on your product as soon as possible. There is even 
a spinoff movement called Lean Startup Machine (see Figure 7-1) that 
holds worldwide events in which startups and product makers learn 
how to design, build, and test a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) exper-
iment over a weekend.

A successful UX strategy also needs this continuous testing to ensure 
that your product will deliver a solution that people will really, really 
want. Thus, you need to jump from your storyboard to an MVP or pro-
totype of your product. You’ll then take it into small, structured, lean 
experiments to learn as soon as possible if your team’s latest assump-
tions are on the right track and to force you to confront the reality of 
what it would actually take to make your business model work in the 
real world. This kick-starts the process of blending the ingredients that 
make up all four tenets of my UX strategy framework, as presented in 
Figure 7-2.

Giving It Your Best Shot
Years before my dad bought the doomed hot dog stand I discuss in 
Chapter 4, I watched my mom start and run a successful business 
out of her bedroom closet of our San Fernando Valley home. It was 
the early 1970s, and my mom, age 35, fell hard for the sport of tennis. 
This was the decade of tennis in the United States. Its popularity was 
fueled by the televised championships at Wimbledon as well as the US 
Open and the French Open, with competitors like John Newcombe,

Ken Rosewall, and Chris Evert. Backyard tennis courts, country clubs 
with strong tennis programs, and tournaments popped up all across 
the country. In sunny southern California, tennis became an integral 
part of the upper-middle-class lifestyle. While I attended elementary 
school, my mom dragged my little brother in his playpen to the local 
park where she took lessons. She was a natural who developed a power-
ful slice return, and six months after starting lessons, she won her first 
ladies double tournament trophy (see Figure 7-3).
It didn’t take long before my mom began to look beyond the game. One 
day, while having lunch with her doubles partner, Lea Kramer, inspira-
tion struck. The friends loved all aspects about the sport—on and off 
the court—but both agreed that it was almost impossible to find rea-
sonably priced tennis clothes. A competitive audit of discount tennis 
clothing stores in Los Angeles assured the women they had stumbled 
on a blue ocean. They had found themselves a value proposition.
They each had $500 to invest. Neither of them had any retail experi-
ence. Lea knew how to do bookkeeping. My mom had only worked as 
a legal secretary and never attended college. But my mother was a hus-
tler. She suggested that they experiment with their value proposition by 
doing a trial run. She reached out to a family friend to see if he could 
help them acquire some product. He worked in the “schmatta” (rag) 
business and knew his way around downtown Los Angeles clothing

manufacturers. He also knew the movie star Elke Sommer, who agreed 
to sell the new business partners some of her new tennis clothing line 
at just over cost. With 4 dresses, 10 pastel skirts, and 12 bras, my mom 
and Lea just needed to find some customers.
They first started trying to acquire customers at the tennis courts, 
where they showed off their wares from the trunk of my mom’s Chevy 
Nova. But people really needed a private place to try things on. So they 
obtained local club lists with names and numbers of players they could 
schmooze into coming over to their homes. I remember coming home 
from school to find dozens of half-naked women parading around 
my mom’s bedroom while she urged them to try on different styles. 
Then, my mom and Lea were even invited to be part of a charity (donat-
ing 10 percent of sales) in a Beverly Hills home. They trucked their 
clothes to this wealthy customer segment, where they sold the product 
in a “pop-up” dressing room in the mansion’s garage. These experi-
ments eventually made them a rousing success. Their entrepreneurial 
scheme was even featured as one of the “Ten Biggest Bargains in L.A” 
in LA Magazine.‡ Within their first year, they built up $10,000 of inven-
tory and a customer base from all over, including Beverly Hills, Ojai, 
and Pacific Palisades. It was time to scale from their bedroom closets to 
a brick-and-mortar location on Ventura Boulevard. Love Match Tennis 
Shop (see Figure 7-4) was officially born!

The business was a break-even from the start, and my mom and Lea 
typically reinvested any profits back into purchasing more inventory. 
They enjoyed the discretionary income and the flexible schedule that 
let them raise their young children and also play tennis. After three 
years, they moved the store into a space three times the size in a new 
shopping mall. Love Match Tennis Shop continued its success, but after 
almost 10 years, my mom decided to move on. Lea bought out her share 
for an amount that they both agreed was fair. In accordance with the 
etiquette demonstrated at the end of a proper tennis match, they shook 
hands and thus concluded their business partnership.
Lessons Learned
•	 You do not need an MBA or even a college education to start 
a business and for it to be successful. You do need to be a 
go-getter.
•	 Start small. If you have a big idea, figure out a way to trial it. 
Manage risk by taking action. Place small bets fast.
•	 Stay in a partnership for as long as you have the stamina to 
pull your weight. But when it’s over, leave gracefully and with a 
handshake.
How I Became an Experiment Addict
When Marc Andreessen coined the term “Product/Market Fit” back in 
2007,§ he said, “In a great market—a market with lots of real potential 
customers—the market pulls product out of the startup.” This aligns 
with Steve Blank’s Customer Development methodology, in which he 
insists that product makers begin building by understanding their cus-
tomers’ problems, and then tweaking the solution to the customers’ 
needs. In a UX strategy, you do that by running experiments.
§	  http://web.stanford.edu/class/ee204/ProductMarketFit.html

148  |   UX STRATEGY
First, though, we need to define what exactly an experiment is. An 
experiment is a test of a hypothesis. The goal is to discover whether 
your hypothesis is right or wrong based on measurable results. After 
the experiment, you should be able to evaluate your results and accept 
or reject your original hypothesis.
Experiments are diverse and can be run in a laboratory or in the field. 
They can be controlled (run with a control group for comparison) or 
natural (run with no control groups). No matter what type, though, 
experiments are all about testing a variable in order to falsify a hypoth-
esis. This variable is any item, factor, or condition that you can control 
or change. In observing the variables in the experiments, you look for 
a cause-and-effect relationship, and you conduct the experiment for a 
finite amount of time, because you want to measure and empirically 
capture observable evidence about what happens when the variable 
changes. It’s that simple. Or so you might initially think.
In early 2011, I was working full-time as an offsite UX strategy consul-
tant for Cisco Systems. At the same time, I was looking for smaller, get-
your-hands-dirty opportunities with local tech startups in Los Angeles. 
In March, I met Jared Krause, a brash, hilarious, articulate entrepre-
neur, and a fellow NYU alumnus to boot. He had big plans to make 
a fully featured online platform that enabled people to easily trade all 
types of goods and services, and he also had initial private investment 
lined up. Sure, there were other bartering/trading platforms out there, 
but none with a sophisticated mechanism for matching users based 
on common interests and geolocation. Other trading platforms such 
as BarterQuest and Swap.com had clunky interfaces with the type of 
inventory you might find at a yard sale. Jared wanted to create some-
thing groundbreaking.
I started working on the project immediately in addition to my full-
time enterprise job, going through a divorce, and my son starting kin-
dergarten. About six months later, we had completed the business 
requirements, a project roadmap, information architecture, and about 
50 percent of the UX wireframes. Jared put together an impressive 
team including a specialist in artificial intelligence. Our value prop-
osition was basically that it would be the “OkCupid for barter,” or in 
Jared’s words, “a dating site for your shit.” The big idea was that cus-
tomers could make lists of all the things they had to offer and all the 
things they wanted. Then, the back-end algorithm would match up the 
appropriate people.

 7. Creating Prototypes for Experiments   |  149
The project was ambitious and complicated. Figure 7-5 demonstrates 
that the transaction flow alone was complex.
FIGURE 7-5
Transaction flow created for TradeYa
Then one day, at the beginning of a wireframe review call, Jared told 
me I had to stop working on the UX. Instead I had to go read the New 
York Times best seller The Lean Startup. Over two days I listened to the 
audio version while hiking the Arroyo Seco trails in Pasadena. The con-
cepts in the book jolted me awake to two scary realities. The first was 
that Jared and my course of action for the product drastically needed 
to change. This meant I had to throw out or put aside a lot of hard UX 
work. The second reality was that my practice of UX strategy and design 
methodology based on the traditional “waterfall” software development 
model was now outdated.
The rules had completely changed:
•	 No more working on UX strategy phases geared toward a big 1.0 
“launch.” Now, I needed to plan for making small incremental pre-
releases (MVPs) that articulated different aspects of the UX.
•	 No more working in isolation and then just handing off docu-
mentation to the team (stakeholders, developers, designers). Now, 
I needed to continuously collaborate and strategize with them to 
ensure that the product was released as quickly as possible.
•	 No more crossing my fingers and hoping that customers would 
love the product after it was built. Now, I needed to insist that my 
clients let me conduct experiments along the way that tested the 
UX and the value proposition.

150  |   UX STRATEGY
Changing our process mid-project was very stressful. Plus, we were 
running out of funding, so Jared needed to bring in another round of 
investment. The investors wanted real evidence of a solid rationale for 
the potential success of our product. The big question Jared kept get-
ting was, “Why would someone want to wait for a worthwhile trade for 
their old laptop when they could just sell it on Craig’s List and then 
spend the cash on whatever they wanted?” Jared and I needed to begin 
experimenting immediately with an MVP to show that our utopian 
vision wasn’t from Planet Utopia.
The challenge was to isolate a slice of the UX that would truly test the 
essence of the value proposition. We also needed something technically 
feasible that the developers could build in less than one month. Jared 
was confident that his own extreme marketing abilities would drive 
enough people to the landing page. Still, we needed a place for them 
to land that would make immediate sense and not feel like an empty 
shopping mall.
Because we didn’t want to wait for a month to learn if people followed 
through with the actual transaction in the offline world (which was 
outside of our online transactional funnel), the MVP also needed to 
yield immediate results for any successful trades. We needed to learn 
a lot from this experiment. The most important things we needed to 
learn was whether trades were more likely to happen if the person who 
wanted to trade something was open to a variety of commensurable 
offers versus a specific “want” item. Jared had a hunch that if we spot-
lighted just one trade per day and made it for something highly attrac-
tive to our hypothesized customer segments, we would have a higher 
guarantee of a successful transaction (a trade actually happening).
The most difficult part to determine was how the experiment would 
work without any backend engineering. It required us to focus on the 
key experience that provided the most innovation. For TradeYa, it was 
the capability of being able to get something you wanted without hav-
ing to pay money for it. We needed people to want to engage in the act of 
trading with strangers. To ensure that all trades actually went through 
without a hitch, Jared intended to manually facilitate them. This could 
be as easy as helping both parties with the swap logistics over email 
or coordinating a time for them to meet up in front of a 7-Eleven with 

 7. Creating Prototypes for Experiments   |  151
Jared as a mediator. Over one weekend, Jared and I sat side by side and 
knocked out the all the necessary UX documentation for the develop-
ers. In less than one month, “Trade of the Day” was born.
Figure 7-6 depicts the application maps of the before and after of the 
original TradeYa vision and the first MVP.
FIGURE 7-6
TradeYa’s sitemap before and after we went “Lean”
Figure 7-7 shows the home page wireframes of the before and after of 
the original TradeYa vision and the first MVP.
FIGURE 7-7
TradeYa’s home page before and after we went “Lean”
It’s pretty clear from just a quick glance at the UX documentation how 
much the product shrank. We basically had to figure out a way to enable 
a rudimentary trade on the frontend (the user interface) without requir-
ing the developers to do any backend engineering (code and database). 
Our thought was that if Craig’s List had done perfectly fine without 

152  |   UX STRATEGY
requiring users to even have accounts, the same could be true for the 
first version of TradeYa. As a result, I chopped out all the personaliza-
tion and transactional wireframes—no user profiles, shopping carts, or 
user reviews. The MVP’s experience simply didn’t need it.
The product went from fat to lean; it was going to do a lot less but do it 
well. That was crucial, because we didn’t have the time or the resources 
to build out the original feature-heavy version. We also had the com-
mon two-sided marketplace issue of the chicken and the egg. Without 
users to trade “stuff,” who would come to trade with them? Thus, the 
age-old question: what came first, the trader or the tradee?
Here’s where Jared made the experiment more intense. He insisted 
that everybody on the team (investors, developers, designers, all of us) 
had to test this by coming up with goods or services to trade until each 
of us had completed a successful trade. I had not planned on getting my 
hands this dirty! I didn’t have any old couches or personal computers 
that I wanted (or needed) to trade. So I chose to trade on my UX skills. 
(See Figure 7-8.) My trade-of-the-day offer was two hours of my UX 
consulting time over Skype in exchange for either a) open to offers or 
b) the highly specific task of converting some old Flash animations of 
mine into YouTube videos.
FIGURE 7-8
My own TradeYa on TradeYa
It was scary yet fun. Moreover, it was truly like our original value prop-
osition, a dating site for your shit. Within 24 hours, I accepted a trade 
offer from Edward, a digital consultant out of Portland. This was when 
I wholeheartedly connected the dots. I had firsthand experience that the 

 7. Creating Prototypes for Experiments   |  153
value proposition and UX weren’t quite like eBay; rather, it was much 
closer to OkCupid. The trade was successful. Edward put my animated 
cartoon series on YouTube, and I schooled him on how to begin obtain-
ing UX work in Portland. I even hooked him up with a job interview. 
The entire user journey was pretty magical. Our trade was worth more 
than paper money because we both got so much out of the exchange 
of our traded skills without either of us having to file a W9. The cur-
rent and potential investors liked what they saw, and more funding was 
raised so that we could continue experimenting and learning.
As you can see from this case study, there are lots of different types 
of experiments that you might run and design to determine product/
market fit—ones that don’t involve writing a single line of code. Here’s 
two popular methods:
Online campaigns
Jared was confident in his ability to draw people to our new land-
ing page through marketing, which meant that he would need to 
advertise TradeYa. The primary purpose of any advertisement, con-
cierge MVP, explainer video, or Kickstarter campaign, is to mea-
sure if potential customers take action. They need to respond with 
that tentative first click. A positive response such as a click can 
track specific actions with bite-sized measurements called metrics. 
Metrics can tell us the following:
•	 How many people landed on the YouTube video page?
•	 Of those, how many people watched the entire video?
•	 How much traffic was driven from the video page to the product 
site?
•	 How many people submitted their email address for more 
information?
•	 How many people made it down the entire sales funnel and 
signed up for a monthly subscription?
A truly successful conversion will engage people with your prod-
uct’s value proposition and eventually convert them into custom-
ers. Metrics have the potential to tell us everything from the click-
through rate (CTR) of an online campaign to customer satisfaction 
levels. (I discuss this in greater detail in Chapter 9.)

154  |   UX STRATEGY
But online campaigns can also be used to pitch the MVP’s value 
proposition to users to see if they’ll “buy in” to the concept. This 
is usually a short-format “explainer” video or animation that 
explains the benefits of the product. You can find them on web 
pages, YouTube, or crowdfunding platforms such as Kickstarter 
and Indiegogo; and they are meant to draw investors, raise funds, 
test product appeal, and acquire users. Successful buy-in is indi-
cated by customer suspects who provide their email address or 
other personal information. This type of feedback data is consid-
ered “currency.”
One of the most famous examples occurred in 2008 when Drew 
Houston released a three-minute screencast recording of a product 
he was working on called Dropbox. The screencast showed a sim-
ulation of the product’s value proposition: its functionality, ease 
of use, and benefits. The video went viral and almost overnight 
garnered Houston more than 75,000 signups¶ from early adopters 
eager for a product that had not even been built. Now, that’s some 
successful conversion results that show people want your product! 
This advertisement or “concierge MVP” (as Eric Ries called it in 
Lean Startup) primed the pump for startups to begin going ballis-
tic running experiments using explainer videos. (See Mint, Crazy 
Egg, Dollar Shave Club, Groupon, and even Airbnb.) Figure 7-9 
shows the explainer video that Jared produced for TradeYa.

Concierge MVP
“Concierge” is a French word that essentially means doorkeeper. 
The job of a concierge in a hotel or residential complex is to ensure 
that the experience of its customers (tenants, guests, whoever) is 
frictionless from the moment the person enters the building (or 
service or product). When I speak about Concierge MVPs, I’m 
referring to an attempt to simulate an aspect of the customer’s 
experience without the interface and to do it with as little friction 
as possible. You are simply de-risking your product by simulating 
as many of the frontend key experiences as possible without the 
interface backend to see what goes wrong and what goes right. 
When you don’t have the time or resources to build a backend, cre-
ating a Concierge MVP is the next best thing.

156  |   UX STRATEGY
This is exactly what Jared did while we worked on cutting off a lot 
of feature weight. He personally facilitated trades between users—
by phone, by email, and in person—without the use of the backend 
to do it automatically. There are many other examples and arti-
cles that describe twenty-first-century concierge experiments con-
cocted to test value propositions of products such as Car’s Direct, 
Zappos, Food on the Table, and even Airbnb. My take is that early 
adopters are simply fascinated by technological innovation and 
open to experiencing something new, even if there is some trick-
ery involved.
But this isn’t anything new; innovators having been “faking it,” 
and users have been “falling for it” for a long time. In 1769, an 
inventor named Wolfgang von Kempelen performed a demonstra-
tion of his automaton chess-playing machine for the empress of 
Austria. The Mechanical Turk, or “The Turk,” toured Europe for 
decades playing chess and defeating challengers including states-
men such as Napoleon Bonaparte and Benjamin Franklin.** Even 
Edger Allen Poe published a theory speculating that the chess 
moves were actually determined by a legless war veteran who could 
fit in the tiny space inside the cabinet. What users didn’t know was 
that it actually was a chess master hidden inside the machine, but 
in a much larger secret compartment concealed by folding parti-
tions (see Figure 7-10). Users were playing him rather than it.

But the illusion really got people to think. It got mathematicians think-
ing about mechanical computers. It also gave audiences at the dawn of 
the industrial revolution a taste of the value proposition of the super-
computer. Today, it’s feasible for any aspiring entrepreneur to manually 
simulate a complex digital product. Amazon’s Mechanical Turk†† offers 
a crowd-sourcing marketplace with which businesses can outsource 
microtasks to individuals. The platform provides on-demand access to 
a diverse and scalable workforce that takes advantage of human intelli-
gence to mimic backend technology. This is the same as how Jared per-
sonally enabled the transactions behind the scenes of TradeYa before 
††	 https://www.mturk.com

158  |   UX STRATEGY
the larger product was reworked to align with our new vision. Whatever 
magic you decide to perform, concierge experiments are less risky than 
building out the entire product and then seeing what happens.
Wizard of OZing It
Digital product simulation actually dates back to a 1983 experiment done 
at IBM by J.F. Kelley. In his whitepaper titled “An Empirical Methodology 
for Writing User-Friendly Natural Language Computer Applications,”* he 
unveils a methodology he calls the “OZ Paradigm.”
Kelley describes his test as “an experimental simulation in which partici-
pants are given the impression that they are interacting with a program 
that understands English as well as another human would. In fact, at least 
in the earlier stages of development, the program is limping along, only 
partly implemented. The experimenter, acting as ‘Wizard,’ surreptitiously 
intercepts communications between participant and program, supplying 
answers and new inputs as needed.”
We all know this famous “wizard” character that Kelley was referring to 
from The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. In this classic children’s story, the wizard 
convinces Dorothy that he is “great and powerful” by using magic tricks and 
props. His incredible simulations lead her to believe that he is the only man 
capable of solving her problem and those of her companions.†
The concept of creating simulations of new technologies to test out inno-
vative concepts is core to gaining early validation. Essentially, J.F. Kelley 
was doing Build-Measure-Learn feedback loops, exposing many users to his 
product who had never even used a computer before without completely 
building out the entire, complicated interface. He gained validated user 
research by using humans instead of machines to simulate just enough arti-
ficial intelligence to make his system seem real.

Testing Product/Market Fit by Using Prototypes
TradeYa already had a digital presence when Jared and I decided to 
backtrack and build an MVP. But, what if you don’t have an actual web-
site yet? What if you just have a storyboard and an idea? That’s when 
a prototype comes in handy. The goal of a prototype is to avoid cod-
ing and designing until you have true validation that your solution is 
desired and can be sustained by your hypothetical customer segment.
A prototype is anything that serves to familiarize the user with the 
ultimate experience you are trying to create. These can be low-fidelity 
paper prototypes or high-fidelity mockups. In the tech industry today, 
prototyping is a big deal. Digital teams create highly detailed ones in 
programs such as Axure or OmniGraffle. These prototypes can be 
useful for tactical usability testing and conveying functionality to the 
development teams. Conversely, they can easily become resource over-
kill just making something “clickable” to convey a strategic concept. 
In fact, you might have noticed how I haven’t mentioned wireframing 
(the typical UX deliverable) at all as something to do for strategy. Most 
customers and stakeholders can’t look at a wireframe and truly “get” 
the experience. If you leave important ideas up to their imaginations, 
you risk some customers’ disapproval because they can’t understand it.
I believe a prototype that you don’t learn from is a waste of time. In 
Chapter 6, I talk about the reasons you needed to focus on key experi-
ences. Now, you’ll use your storyboard as the starting point for creating 
a solution prototype so that you can run an experiment. You will use it to 
show proof-of-concept to users for when your team goes out to do guer-
rilla user research, which we look at in the Chapter 8.
THREE STEPS TO DESIGN HACKING THE SOLUTION PROTOTYPE
I used to call a solution prototype the five-screen MVP, but I have moved 
away from that because, honestly, a prototype is certainly not “viable” 
or a “product.” Its sole purpose is to force your team to create the min-
imum amount of screens necessary to demonstrate the key experience 
of the interface, the value proposition, and a sneak peek of the potential 
business model of the product. It pushes your team to take your inno-
vative storyboard to the next level.
However, like the storyboards, solution prototypes are not meant to 
be pixel-perfect for development. The interfaces and artwork can be 
cut and pasted from other existing websites, thus requiring minor 

160  |   UX STRATEGY
typesetting of the content. You are using the output to conduct an 
experiment to get customer validation. The prototype is not the final 
product, although it might inform, inspire, or annoy the future design-
ers of it.
Here is the general framework of the solution prototype screens and 
their content. The order and amount of the middle screens is flexible 
based on how many key experiences you need to show.
1.	 Setup  Typically the landing page or user dashboard.
2.	 Key UX 1  Typically in one to three screens, shows the crucial 
interactions that show value innovation.
3.	Key UX 2  Typically in one to three screens, shows the crucial 
interactions that show value innovation.
4.	 Value proposition  This is the final result of a successful 
transaction.
5.	Pricing strategy (if applicable)  This shows the cost of the app, 
monthly fees, package costs, and so on. If the revenue stream of 
the product is advertising, then you should consider putting exam-
ples of how ads might look on the prior screens.
Let’s return to Bita and Ena, my students whom I introduced in Chapter 
3, to see how to make a successful solution prototype.
Step 1
Write a simple list or an outline of the screens you are going to show. 
It’s going to potentially include one or two key experiences. As with 
the storyboard, you want to really distill out the details that you need 
to show.
Bita and Ena wanted to show the screens from their storyboard but with 
more details. This was the list they wrote:
1.	 The landing page with the user’s query entered
2.	 The result set with the listing and the maps and the filters exposed
3.	A filtered result set with the listing and the maps and the filters 
closed
4.	 A result detailed screen
5.	A photo gallery featuring images of a home, specific to the wedding

 7. Creating Prototypes for Experiments   |  161
6.	 The package options with pricing
7.	The tour setup screen
8.	 The confirmation screen with final pricing, including cost of 
service
Notice how all the steps of the solution prototype refer to the experience 
online. That’s because this is what Bita and Ena need to test: does the 
digital product solve the customer’s problem?
Step 2
Start creating mashing up the images that tell the story.
Chapter 6 points out that there are lots of well-thought-out UX and UI 
design patterns that you can safely reference at this stage in your pro-
cess instead of building them from scratch. However, try as hard as 
you can to make your prototype seem real, which as I mentioned earlier 
with the Mechanical Turk is key to making a simulation of a machine 
pass muster.
Figures 7-11 through 7-18 show what Bita and Ena’s ultimate solution 
prototype looked like. If you look closely, you will see that most of the 
ideas were borrowed from competitors and influencers.

170  |   UX STRATEGY
Feel free to create the first version using whatever tool (pencil, white-
board, Photoshop, or whatever works for you) will help you and your 
team work the fastest. When you know what’s going on in the entire 
solution prototype, it’s time for you or the visual designers to get to 
work.
Step 3
Paste all the screenshots into the presentation tool.
If I am working on my own, I do mockups in Photoshop. If I am work-
ing with a team of designers, I advocate building the prototype by using 
Google Presentation. This helps the team easily collaborate as we build 
out different screens. The Google Presentation prototype also outputs 
perfectly to PDF format, as well, so it’s easy to distribute. Bita and Ena 
decided to build their linear solution prototype in Photoshop and then 
exported the final product to PDF.
This is an important step, because the point of the presentation isn’t to 
show the solution prototype to stakeholders. It’s to show it to custom-
ers. The users need to feel like they are using the interface even if it isn’t 
interactive. Having a PDF on a pretty color screen like an iPad can be 
very effective in guerrilla user research (I discuss this in more detail in 
Chapter 8). The participant can swipe the screen at her own pace. She 
can move forward and back so she understands the narrative linearity 
of the key experience. Based on this minimal interaction, you will get 
great feedback. For instance, when Bita showed the solution prototype 
to a bride-to-be and her groom, they loved the idea of being able to have 
a fancy wedding in an affordable home. They had used Airbnb and 
understood the way private subletting worked. However, they noticed 
that they couldn’t set up a tour in the home through the solution proto-
type interface. Bita and Ena hadn’t thought of that. Consequently, they 
adjusted it to include a calendar function with which users could pick 
tour dates, as illustrated in Figure 7-17. They then ran another round of 
experiments to show their new prototype to five more targeted custom-
ers to validate that the feature was more than just a “nice to have” add.

Photoshop and serve up your demo on a URL where people can try out a 
demonstration of it. 
Prott (https://prottapp.com) Using Prott, you can easily stitch together 
images, add hotspots, and output interactive prototypes that work great for 
testing concepts on multiple devices. 
SOLUTION PROTOTYPE REALITY CHECK: WHY USER 
EXPERIENCES AND BUSINESS MODELS MUST GO HAND IN HAND
Remember the Business Model Canvas in Chapter 2? Let’s zoom into 
the left side of the canvas and take a look at Figure 7-19. We need to con-
sider how those components—key partnerships, key activities, and key 
resources—might affect the composition of your solution prototype.

172  |   UX STRATEGY
FIGURE 7-19
Key components behind the scenes of our solution
You need to keep your team honest about the logistics behind your pro-
totype concept. If this is the simulated digital solution of your interface, 
are you hyperaware of all the things that need to make it work behind 
the scenes? Moreover, are those things feasible and sustainable? In the 
case of TradeYa, obviously our concierge model was not sustainable. If 
we wanted to scale, we couldn’t rely on Jared personally facilitating each 
and every transaction. He couldn’t hand-hold every new user through 
the anxiety of making their first successful trade. So, we had to come 
up with a better option. (More on that in Chapter 9.)
In the case of Bita and Ena, before they showed their prototype to real 
users, they created a list of questions and issues that were specific to 
each step. Among the questions they asked themselves were who the 

 7. Creating Prototypes for Experiments   |  173
key partners are. What are the key activities? And what and from where 
would they get the key resources? To get those answers, they asked 
these questions:
Screens 1 through 5
Where would we get the initial inventory of big houses to make it 
work? Can we initially build our inventory of houses by contacting 
people on Airbnb or other sublet listing sites?
Screen 5
How are we going to get the photography good enough to entice 
customers to book a private home? Can we (like Airbnb) hire a pho-
tographer to shoot the backyards and rooms?
Screen 6
How are we going to select the party vendors for the food, valet, 
and flowers? Should we go with fewer than a dozen to begin? How 
will we establish those partnerships? Is it better to focus on local, 
small franchises who already cater to specific areas?
Screen 7
What are the most likely time-slot breakdowns that hosts and 
guests will choose for private tours? Is what is shown the best 
breakdown or can it be limited to weekends?
Screen 8
Is it even possible to generate this type of total cost for a wedding 
package? Is putting the word “estimate” in there a better safeguard 
or will it turn off the guests who have a certain budget? What is the 
reality of creating packages with so many variables?
Overall prototype questions
What would make this solution easier to trial? What if we zoomed 
into a specific segment of the market, such as just Santa Monica or 
beach areas in Los Angeles? How many people would it take to truly 
organize this major event when it actually occurs? Do we poten-
tially need a wedding planner who will orchestrate everything? Or, 
is this platform to cut out the middle man (wedding planners) and 
to create a turnkey solutions to save costs to the brides?
The answers to these questions change over time. For instance, where 
do Bita and Ena get the homes to showcase on the site? Initially, they 
would probably need to solicit hosts personally—much as my mother 

174  |   UX STRATEGY
and her partner Lea did for their first clientele. As they begin to scale, 
Bita and Ena would need to use online advertising to bring users to the 
first iteration of their digital interface. They would need to sell those 
users the value proposition, which would cause them to join the service.
Before I get into conversion (Chapter 9), it’s time to learn how to test 
drive your solution prototype by running face-to-face experiments on 
customers. It’s time to engage your potential users in a guerrilla user 
research attack.
Recap
The moral of this chapter is: don’t burn your time, money, or efforts 
on a product no one may want to use. Instead, concoct ways to develop 
and run small, structured experiments to gain validated user learn-
ings. Do something to concierge the experience of a new product, even 
if it means selling it out of your own bedroom closet.
Most experiments fail, so just think through the outcomes and focus 
on the worthwhile takeaways. Sometimes, the results will not be black 
and white. Thus, you will need to interpret them by having collabora-
tive team-debriefing discussions following each experiment.

Conducting Guerrilla User Research
Take a chance and step outside.
Lose some sleep and say you tried.
Meet frustration face to face.
A point of view creates more waves.
—JOY DIVISION (1979)
By running small, structured experiments, this qualitative 
fieldwork will help you to immediately validate assumptions about the 
value proposition and innovative key experience from the users them-
selves. In this chapter, you will focus on harvesting actionable take-
aways from your potential customer segment through guerrilla user 
research. You will use the prototype from Chapter 7 to get closer to the 
truth with an open heart and mind to really hear what your potential 
customers feel and think about your product’s core experience. This 
chapter focuses on Tenet 3, Validated User Research (Figure 8-1), and 
makes use of the UX Strategy Toolkit.

Guerrilla User Research: Operation Silver Lake Café
On September 23, 2013, an unarmed team of UX vigilantes launched 
an organized attack on the value proposition of the software engineer I 
introduced in Chapter 1. The treatment center operation lasted 8 hours 
and involved 10 participants in two hipster café locations in Silver Lake, 
California. The entire team of vigilantes (team lead, UX researcher, and 
event coordinator) and interview participants walked away unscathed. 
Neither café location was compromised, and all interviews were con-
ducted without major incident. However, the client left the scene emo-
tionally exhausted because the result from the research falsified his 
hypothesis that his desired customer segment—everybody—would 
be willing to pay for this solution, which left his business model in 
shambles.
Here is how the events played out:
1:10 p.m.
A UX researcher arrives at Café Location One. She buys a coffee 
and leaves a large tip. She then walks to the upper level to find an 
isolated area, out of view from café workers. The area has about 
six square tables. All the seats are taken, so she waits for a table to 
clear.
1:30 p.m.
A table clears with two seats; the UX researcher grabs the table and 
throws her extra jacket over the one seat. She takes out her laptop to 
test the WiFi connection and AC power outlets. While she sets up, 
Jaime (team lead) and the client (the software engineer) enter the 
café. They buy coffee, leave a large tip, and make their way upstairs. 
They make eye contact with the UX researcher and scan the area 
for a possible primary interview table for three.
1:45 p.m.
A table for three clears that is near an AC outlet and also has a view 
of the staircase. Jaime sits at the seat facing the stairs. The client 
sits opposite from her. Jaime texts the event coordinator: The inter-
view location is ready. The event coordinator takes his position in 
front of the café and pulls out his clipboard to look official. His job 
is to catch participants before they enter the café.

1:55 p.m.
Participant One shows up at the cafe. The event coordinator greets 
him at the door. The coordinator walks Participant One into the 
café and up the stairs to the primary interview table. He introduces 
him to the team lead and client. Before he leaves, the event coordi-
nator takes Participant One’s order for coffee.
2:05 p.m.
Participant Two shows up five minutes late. The event coordinator 
greets her at the door. He walks her upstairs to the secondary inter-
view table with the UX researcher, who greets her in a respectful 
and professional manner. He then takes her order for coffee and 
goes downstairs to buy the beverages; he leaves a large tip. The 
event coordinator returns upstairs with the beverage orders for 
both participants. It’s at this time that he also gives them their cash 
payments. While the interviews commence, he then goes back out-
side and waits for the next set of participants to arrive.
2:10 p.m. to 2:45 p.m.
The team lead and UX researcher conduct 30-minute interviews 
and wrap them up on time (Figure 8-2). The client listens to the 
interviews and takes notes in real time that are saved in the cloud 
for the team to view. When concluded, the team lead and UX 
researcher quickly discuss if any changes need to be made to the 
interview questions. They make those edits and then text the event 
coordinator to bring up the next participants.

FIGURE 8-2

2:55 p.m to 4:59 p.m.
During this block of time, Participant Three arrives. Participant 
Four ends up being a no show, and Participants Five and Six arrive 
as planned. The event coordinator greets each participant at the 
door, takes them upstairs to the appropriate interview table, takes 
their drink order, delivers it, and pays them. The team lead and 
UX researcher conduct and conclude the remaining interviews on 
time while the client continues to observe and take notes.
4:45 p.m.
After the last scheduled participant arrives, the event coordinator 
heads down to Sunset Boulevard to Café Location Two. He orders a 
sandwich and beverage and then finds a table near an AC adaptor 
to prepare the next location.
5:00 p.m.
The interviews at Café Location One wrap up after three hours. A 
total of five participants have been interviewed. The UX researcher, 
team lead, and the client discuss their findings, capture their 
insights, and tweak the interview questions for the second set of 

 8. Conducting Guerrilla User Research   |  179
participants at Café Location Two. The UX researcher goes home; 
she’s not needed for any more interviews. Jaime and the client head 
down the block to the second location. They meet the event coor-
dinator and order dinner. By 5:20 p.m., the event coordinator takes 
his position at the door with his clipboard.
5:30 p.m.
Participant Seven arrives. The event coordinator greets him at the 
door. He takes the participant to the table.
6:00 p.m.
Participant Eight arrives 30 minutes early through a back door in 
the café. She heads directly to the interview table and interrupts 
the interview in session. Jaime takes Participant Eight over to the 
event coordinator who deftly handles the situation. Jaime finishes 
up the interrupted interview. 
6:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m.
Two more interviews are conducted without issue. One participant 
who was intentionally double-booked at the halfway point shows 
up, is paid, and is excused after 30 minutes.
8:30 p.m.
The interviews at Café Location Two wrap up after three hours. 
A total of three more participants have been interviewed at this 
location.
9:00 p.m.
The client, Jaime, and event coordinator discuss their findings and 
capture their insights. The debriefing session concludes, and all 
parties go home.
After a long day, a week of planning, and a $5,000 research budget, 
we didn’t even need to look at the notes afterward or analyze what we 
found. It was clear the participants consistently admired and applauded 
the solution prototype. They loved the value innovation and key expe-
riences demonstrated through the UX in the prototype. But, the stake-
holder knew in his heart that he had a major pivot on his hands. Even 
though the customers were enthusiastic about the solution, they contin-
ually invalidated his business model—channels, revenue stream, and 

180  |   UX STRATEGY
cost structure. (See the business model canvas in Chapter 2.) Without 
it, his product wasn’t sustainable. He had to go back to the drawing 
board, pivot, or make a tough choice about whether to continue or not.
Lessons Learned
•	 When you put key stakeholders in front of a real customer, they 
will learn the good or bad news sooner rather than later, directly 
from the source.
•	 An organized, well-coordinated, and mobile team effort is essen-
tial to successful field research.
•	 To get validated learnings, you don’t need to invest in an expen-
sive or time-consuming endeavor.
User Research versus Guerrilla User Research
The purpose of conducting user research is to understand the needs 
and goals of your target audience in order to inform the value proposi-
tion of the product. There are many traditional techniques for under-
standing users’ perceptions including card-sorting, contextual inqui-
ries, focus groups, and surveys. There are hundreds of books that you 
can buy to learn user-research techniques. The two recent ones that I 
like are UX for Lean Startups by Laura Klein* and The User Experience 
Team of One by Leah Buley.†
User research usually involves usability testing and/or ethnographic 
research. Each has advantages and disadvantages, and it’s important to 
know the difference so that you can decide what kind of research is best 
for your product and process.
Usability testing focuses on whether your products work by discovering 
how people use the product in real time. Data points tested in a usabil-
ity study include the following:
•	 Does the user perform the required tasks using the interface?
•	 How many clicks does it take for users to perform them?

†	  Buley, Lean. The User Experience Team of One. Rosenfeld Media, 2013.

 8. Conducting Guerrilla User Research   |  181
•	 How long does it take for the user to figure out your product?
The answers to these kinds of questions can validate whether your 
product’s calls to action are positioned correctly, whether the user 
can find important information, or if the nomenclature of the navi-
gation is clear. Traditionally, usability testing is conducted in special 
usability labs with two-way mirrors or on the premises of large corpo-
rations. Nowadays, it can be conducted remotely by using online ser-
vices (such as Usertesting.com) that provide quick, reasonably priced 
screencast videos that record how people use your product or prototype 
while speaking their thoughts. However, usability testing generally is 
to interaction design what quality control is to physical product design. 
This means that it’s typically conducted after the product is completed 
but before it’s released to the general public.
In contrast, ethnographic research—the study of people in their nat-
ural environment—is all about getting to the deep, dark places much 
like the qualitative personas Alan Cooper advocated in Chapter 3. To 
get an idea of how in-depth it can be, let’s look at one of my heroes, 
anthropologist Dr. Genevieve Bell from Intel. In 2005, I saw her give an 
inspiring keynote speech about a project she conducted in Asia to learn 
how people use technology. The research was meant to gather insights 
from developing countries to inform Intel on future chip designs. 
Over two years, Dr. Bell visited hundreds of households in 19 cities 
in 7 countries. She described one story about how she tracked down a 
woman in a remote village. Even though the woman didn’t have water 
or electricity or even a computer, she still regularly corresponded by 
email with her son who was away at college. So how did that happen? 
The woman walked dozens of miles to a family’s home, and the family 
helped her with all email transmissions. The woman never used the 
computer at all!
That kind of user research takes some hardcore contextual inquiry. 
And although I admire Dr. Bell, her intense fieldwork, and her com-
prehensive and thought-provoking analysis, most of us don’t work for 
Intel or have the time and money to spend on that kind of research. 
When I try to estimate the expenses myself—more than 200,000 air 

182  |   UX STRATEGY
miles traveled, hotels, guides, per diem, 19 field notebooks‡—my mind 
boggles. Unless you’re working for a big-budget client, large enterprise, 
or research division with long-term initiatives for product strategy, it’s 
probably more likely that you’re dealing with a research-averse stake-
holder who is in a big rush to “get something out there.” In this case, 
convincing him to perform any user research whatsoever can be a chal-
lenge. Instead, you need to have faster ways of conducting qualitative 
user research that will deliver immediate feedback with testing bud-
gets closer to $5,000, rather than $500,000. So, what do you do?
The answer is guerrilla user research, which can be thought of as a 
nonlethal form of guerrilla warfare. Guerrilla warfare is a strategic 
form of confronting the enemy using a small mobile force to perform 
ambushes and hit-and-run tactics. Who is “the enemy,” you might won-
der? The main enemies for your team are probably time, money, and 
resources, because if you run out of them, you might never know if 
you’ve actually created an innovative but sustainable digital product. 
For clients with little time or no budgets, traditional user research such 
as ethnographic studies would take too much time, and usability test-
ing just isn’t relevant to help determine if your value proposition is on 
target or your key user experiences provide value innovation. That’s 
where guerrilla user research comes in—it’s cost-effective and the 
mobile tactics should help you to validate the following quickly:
•	 Are you targeting the correct customer segment?
•	 Are you solving a common pain point the customer has?
•	 Is the solution you are proposing (demonstrated in the prototype of 
key experiences) something they would seriously consider using?
•	 Would they pay for the product, and, if not, what are the other 
potential revenue models? 
•	 Does the business model work?
Even clients with fat budgets should consider performing guerril-
la-style research. That’s because doing this form of “lean” research is 
not just about saving money, it’s about saving valuable time. The tech

industry moves at a rapid pace and innovation is a moving target. As 
I’ve talked about in many chapters, your window of opportunity to do 
something unique is either closing or shifting. Guerrilla user research 
assures you that your team’s “operation” will deliver immediate, useful, 
and pointed knowledge.
Guerrilla Warfare: A Spotlight on Juana Galán
One of the most famous female guerrilla fighters of all time was Juana 
Galán (see Figure 8-3). She became known in 1808 during the Peninsular 
War when Napoleon Bonaparte’s Grande Armée attacked Spain.* His for-
midable army consisted of hundreds of thousands of well-drilled and dis-
ciplined professional soldiers. To defend her home, Juana Galán organized 
the women in her village to fight back. She led them through highly impro-
visational tactics such as pouring boiling oil on roads and throwing scalding 
water out of windows against the French soldiers. These mobile combatants 
not only saved their own village but also played a part in the French army’s 
decision to abandon the entire province of La Mancha.

THE THREE MAIN PHASES OF GUERRILLA USER RESEARCH
Guerrilla user research is different from traditional user research meth-
ods because it is fast, is lean, aligns the team vision, and provides imme-
diate transparency with the stakeholders. But it requires a lot of coor-
dination. Unlike a sterile research room with recording devices, you 
can’t control your environment in the wild. So, your team needs to think 
through every step in the process and have several back-up plans in place. 
Lives might not be at stake, but cost and time must be contained!
Let’s begin with a high-level review of the three phases to understand 
the basic breakdown of time and expense involved. Then, I will explain 
each phase in detail using the treatment center operation as the case 
study.
Planning phase (one to two weeks depending on 
team size and number of participants)
The planning phase is the most complicated of all three phases because 
it involves everything from finalizing your solution prototype to sched-
uling the participants. Everything must be thought through, timed, 
and rehearsed. Everyone involved must know their respective roles and 
where to stand or sit. As in a guerrilla warfare action, you need to get 
in, do the thing, and then get out quickly without being “captured” (in 
other words, thrown out by the café owners).
The five steps that I will teach you to ensure a successful planning 
phase include the following:
Step 1: Determining the objectives of the research study. Define which 
aspects of the value proposition and UX are being examined.
Step 2: Preparing the questions to be asked that will get us validating. 
Then, rehearse the entire interview along with giving the prototype 
demonstration.
Step 3: Scouting out the venue(s) and mapping out logistics.
Step 4: Advertising for participants.
Step 5: Screening the participants and scheduling time slots.

 8. Conducting Guerrilla User Research   |  185
Interview phase (one day)
The interview phase can be the most nerve-wracking and exhilarating 
of all three phases, because you must prep the location, coordinate the 
sessions, and conduct the interviews. 
The interview phase involves:
•	 Prepping the venue
•	 Participant payments, café etiquette, and tipping
•	 Conducting the interviews
•	 Taking succinct notes
Analysis phase (two to four hours)
The analysis phase is the least complicated of the three phases but 
is still essential. Don’t get sloppy on this phase, because you need to 
aggregate the data captured during the interviews, debrief team mem-
bers who sat in on the interviews, get the client’s feedback if the cli-
ents was present, synthesize all of these inputs quickly, and ultimately 
decide if the interviews were effective in getting the right kind of evi-
dence. The last step is making decisions on the best way to move for-
ward based on your analysis.
PLANNING PHASE (ONE TO TWO WEEKS)
Step 1: Determine the objectives
In this first phase, you need to establish the objectives of the research 
study and define which aspects of the value proposition and UX was 
being examined.
Ask yourself, “What is the most important thing I need to learn to 
determine if this product really has any purpose, marketability, and 
viability?” What this means is that you need to ask what is the riskiest 
assumption(s) still on the table at this point in your process. In the case 
of the software engineer, the value proposition was still up in the air. If 
I use the formula introduced in Chapter 3, I can tell you that the value 
proposition before the guerrilla user research was basically Hotels.com 
for people seeking treatment for their loved ones. The software engi-
neer’s interface provided a matching system similar to Hotels.com, in 
which users enter a price that they want to pay. The system then offers 
matches in the specified price range. As in Hotels.com, the name of 

186  |   UX STRATEGY
the rehabilitation center would be withheld until after the user booked 
it. A big concern was that my team didn’t know if this reverse-auction 
business model was desirable for that user segment.
Because the business model was innately tied to the UX, this uncer-
tainty paralyzed our ability to make any other decisions about the prod-
uct. We could not move forward until we could determine the suc-
cess or failure of the value proposition. This also meant that we had to 
decide as a team along with the client how many times we would hear 
the word no before heading back to the drawing table, versus how many 
times we would need to hear yes before moving forward. At the end of 
the entire operation, what would be our success criteria? That of course 
depended very much on the feedback from the participants we would 
interview.
Step 2: Preparing the interview questions
Chapter 5 discusses the distinction between quantitative and qualitative 
data points via a Starbucks latte (16 ounces and 90 degrees Fahrenheit 
versus comforting and yummy). There is also a distinction between 
quantitative and qualitative user research that goes beyond data points, 
because often we will collect both in either type. Quantitative user 
research generally relies on a large sample size of users. More users 
means more numbers. In contrast, qualitative user research will rely 
on a smaller selection of customers—quality over quantity. This is the 
main difference, and qualitative user research is the kind of research 
your team will conduct.
In guerrilla user research, your goal is not to place the prototype in 
front of 1,000 users in one day. Instead, it is to interact with 5 to 10 
handpicked users to gain intensive and pointed insights. The Nielsen 
Norman Group believes that testing up to 5 users in a usability study is 
enough people before you begin to hear the same things back over and 
over again.§ If you show your product to 10 users and discover that none 
of them likes the idea, you might have your baseline for whether the 
product is a success or failure. However, if you want to keep pursuing 
§	  http://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-many-test-users/

 8. Conducting Guerrilla User Research   |  187
your value innovation, you need to learn information beyond the user’s 
like or dislike. You need to persist and discover exactly why, how, and 
what you can change to make the product better.
Remember, these are not usability tests in which you just observe how 
the user accomplishes the task with the actual product. These are 
demonstrations (and not necessarily clickable) that are meant to help 
the participant visualize the future product clearly enough to give use-
ful feedback on whether they can achieve their goals. You will guide 
the user through a key experience, and the feedback you receive will 
predominantly be verbal, real, raw, and in your face.
To get that kind of qualitative response, you need to really think about 
your interview questions. The right kind of open-ended and follow-up 
questions can lead to discovering opportunities for value creation you 
might not have previously considered.
I recommend creating your interview around two great approaches: 
the problem interview, which you learned about in Chapter 3, and the 
solution interview, which comes by way of lean guru Ash Maurya.¶ You 
must carefully construct all questions; they should relate to your prod-
uct and your expected UX. They shouldn’t lead the participant. The 
questions you ask also need to be flexible enough to be easily rephrased 
for each participant’s personal situation. For example, in the treatment 
center operation, some participants booked themselves into rehabilita-
tion, whereas others booked a loved one.
Here is the general structure that I like to use when building my inter-
view questions. You can access a copy of this format in one of the tem-
plates in the UX Strategy Toolkit online. You can also use it to cap-
ture your questions online. Share them with your team. Discuss them. 
Brainstorm about them. Really look at each of them to create the best 
interview possible.
Set up, recap/verify screener input (three minutes)
Before the participants come to the interview, you need to prescreen 
them through a phone call or other means, which I’ll discuss in Step 
5 of Phase 1. However, when they arrive onsite, you want to kick off 
the face-to-face interview by verifying what you already know. These

188  |   UX STRATEGY
questions also warm the participant up to the questions in the prob-
lem interview. To make the participants more comfortable, you might 
repeat back information you learned when you screened them. You 
might want to have them expand on any aspects that will help you 
understand their experience.
Here are some of the setup questions that my team asked on the treat-
ment center operation:
•	 Can you tell us how many times you have booked your loved one 
into a rehabilitation center?
•	 How long was each stay and did the facility offer you discounts to 
prolong the stay?
•	 How did you find out about individual rehabilitation centers (word-
of-mouth recommendation, the Internet, a list provided by a spe-
cialist, and so on)?
•	 If you used the Internet, how did you find the facilities (for instance, 
Google), and which sites did you use for finding them and learning 
about the specific details?
Notice how the questions would seem nonintrusive to the participants. 
They aren’t shocked by them, because they know (based on the adver-
tisement and screener questions) that that’s why they’re here. However, 
the questions have a second purpose, and that is to set up the context 
for the next part of the operation: the problem interview.
Problem interview (10 minutes)
The problem interview is set up similarly to the problem interview 
described in Chapter 3. The difference is that you are probably going 
to ask more questions and in greater detail. You want to get deeper 
insights about the problem, too. In these questions, ask the partici-
pants how they solved the problem in the past. Try to fully understand 
what their experience is like. Have them recite the timeline of prob-
lem-solving events they undertake in a linear format.
During the problem interview portion of the treatment center guerrilla 
user research, my team focused on payment. Who paid cash for a treat-
ment center as opposed to using Medicare? Here are some more exam-
ples we asked in this line of questioning:

 8. Conducting Guerrilla User Research   |  189
•	 For those rehabilitation centers for which you paid yourself, was the 
process different in terms of your options for making a selection?
•	 Did the center negotiate the price with you? Do you feel you 
received fair value for what you paid? What do you think makes the 
cost of the facility worth the price? 
•	 Do you remember how long in terms of time from when you decided 
upon the treatment center and the patient actually went in? (Prompt: 
What is urgent? How long did the selection process take?)
•	 Was there anything specific you remember that was really great or 
really horrible about the process of finding the treatment center?
In total, we prepared 10 problem questions, and the answers definitely 
gave us a lot of insight into our participants’ pain points. In addition, 
the questions also helped get the participants back into the mindset 
of what it was like to experience those problems. In this way, we could 
contextually prepare them for the solution interview.
Solution demonstration plus interview (15 minutes)
The problem interview sets the stage for the solution interview, in 
which you reveal your product solution and learn if it solves the custom-
er’s problem. You might need to create several solution concepts and 
a set of questions for each key experience you need to present. In the 
case of the treatment center operation, my team presented three solu-
tion demonstrations for three key experiences, as shown in Figure 8-4. 
If you find yourself in that scenario, schedule your time accordingly.
FIGURE 8-4

190  |   UX STRATEGY
Create solution-interview questions that will encourage participants to 
think through your solutions and other alternatives; they might have 
insight into making your product better. Again, don’t create or ask lead-
ing questions. Conversely, don’t put participants on the spot by forcing 
them to brainstorm in front of you. Give them options of familiar men-
tal models that will give the solution prototype context. Be open-ended 
initially with the questions, and then give enough hints and prompts to 
validate the solution.
Following are the solution questions for one of the key experiences (see 
also Figure 8-5). You might also have to contextualize the screen for the 
users before asking them any questions.
•	 Screen 1: What do you think is going on in this screen?
•	 Screen 2: What do you think all these pull-down options mean? 
(Go through each one.)
•	 Screen 2: What do you think the ratings are based on?
•	 Screen 3: This is the listing page with information about the reha-
bilitation center. What do you think is going on here?
•	 Screen 3: What do you think of the “Apply Now” button? Where do 
you think it will take you?
•	 Screen 3: You might have noticed that we don’t display the treat-
ment centers’ actual names. Would that be an issue for you?
•	 Screen 3: Would you be comfortable applying to this facility with-
out contacting it first?
FIGURE 8-5

 8. Conducting Guerrilla User Research   |  191
Final thoughts (two minutes)
At the conclusion of the interview, be sure to thank the participants 
by name. Share with them a tidbit of the knowledge you gained from 
the screener interviews to make it personal, and tell them how much 
you value their honest feedback. Ask if they might be open for you to 
follow up with them in the future when you are further along with the 
product.
Now, your team must rehearse the entire interview using a colleague or 
friend to play the participant role, asking her the questions and walking 
her through the prototype demonstration to verify that the questions 
and solutions make sense.
Step 3: Finding the venue(s) and mapping out team logistics
It’s important that everyone—stakeholders, the product team, and any-
one else—take advantage of this opportunity to interact one-on-one 
with your intended customer. So work with them to ensure that they 
will attend.
Determine how many people are going to be part of each interview. No 
matter if you are running multiple interviews simultaneously or one 
at a time, try always to have one note taker (ideally the client or stake-
holder) and one researcher doing the interview. Taking notes and try-
ing to ask questions at the same time consumes valuable time, and it’s 
important for the interviewer to focus on the participant.
If you plan to schedule multiple interviews, add an event coordinator 
to your team who can screen participants as they come and go, han-
dle money, and deal with any other issues that might arise. Before the 
interview dates, your guerrilla user research team should definitely 
meet and go over all their roles. In the case of the treatment center 
operation, my team had three preparatory meetings to go over logistics, 
location, and scheduling.
A big question I always hear is why a café; why not my office, or a lab? 
Here’s why:
•	 You want the participants to feel like this is an informal meeting. 
They should be comfortable enough to not feel judged, unlike 
when being watched through a two-way mirror in a lab.

192  |   UX STRATEGY
•	 The participant will be in a somewhat familiar environment 
around other people as opposed to a sterile lab or private office in 
a large building or a coworking space. Your team is the minority; 
the participant is not.
•	 Cafés are free locations! There’s no need to rent a lab or a cowork-
ing space. (A hotel lobby can be okay, too, but these locations can 
be more difficult to access and even harder to find free or nearby 
parking.)
•	 The clients or product stakeholders also can interact with their 
potential customer in this informal setting. Instead of being sepa-
rated by a mirror, or surrounded by colleagues, it’s just them, their 
product, and a person telling them to their face whether they like 
it or not. It’s hard for any stakeholder to remain on Fantasy Island 
after that.
Here’s a list of the most important rules for choosing your café:
•	 Find and spend some time at a café you like at the exact time of 
day that you plan to do your study. Ensure that it’s not loud, diffi-
cult to find, or insanely busy on the days you want to conduct your 
interview. I tend to gravitate toward sole-proprietor cafés and away 
from busy franchises such as Starbucks. Find the café that fits your 
needs best.
•	 Test the WiFi connection. Ensure that there are multiple tables that 
can comfortably seat three people with nearby AC power outlets.
•	 Ensure that the tables are not in line-of-sight of café workers or 
near an entrance. You want to be tucked out of the way.
•	 You’ll need to camp out for three to four hours on interview day so 
choose a counter-service type café or coffee shop without table ser-
vice. You’ll want to avoid being disrupted or asked to leave before 
all interviews are done.

 8. Conducting Guerrilla User Research   |  193
On Not Using Recording Devices
Note-takers are vital components to my interviews because I don’t use 
recording devices. I capture data in real time and then debrief with the 
stakeholders immediately afterward. I used to use devices but have since 
abandoned them for the following reasons:
•	 Recording devices make people more self-conscious. Some par-
ticipants are concerned about sounding stupid, and others fear 
the recordings could make their way to a more public place like 
the Internet. In the case of the treatment center project, this was 
an important issue because the participants were talking about 
very personal experiences.
•	 It’s more efficient and cheaper to bring a person who can type 
fast notes straight into a spreadsheet or any text document than 
spending the time transcribing them after the fact.
•	 When conducting an interview, it’s better to be in the moment 
and fully engaged in the conversation as opposed to playing 
around with recording devices or notes. I pay far more attention 
to what participants are saying and doing when I know that I 
won’t have a second chance to listen to the interviews.
•	 When you debrief with the stakeholder and your team immedi-
ately after the interview, you can instantly make decisions and 
take action on whether to abandon, refine, or move forward with 
your solution.
Step 4: Advertising for participants
In certain cases, researchers recommend finding unpaid volunteers 
because they believe money influences the participants’ answers. Still, 
you can’t stop people from lying, whether they are paid or not. There is 
a fine balance between compensating people fairly for their time and 
extracting the right information from the right people. I recommend 
compensating participants, because at this point during your strategic 
endeavor, they are helping us.
Payment amounts also depend on whom you are targeting and how 
much they value their own time. Seemingly, if you need to speak with 
busy professionals, you’ll have to pay a lot more then you might to 
other customer segments. Make your payment high enough to recruit 
worthwhile participants but low enough to keep your study affordable. 

194  |   UX STRATEGY
Always mention in the advertisement that participants will be paid in 
cash at the interview. If you’re not sure where to start, try a payment of 
as little as $20 for 30 minutes. During the initial screening calls with 
participants, you can probe them to ensure that they have the insights 
you want so you only end up paying the people who will really help your 
team.
For the treatment center operation, my team initially advertised for par-
ticipants on Craig’s List. Here are some other ways:
•	 Facebook friends (if you have a lot, ask your network for introduc-
tions to their friends).
•	 LinkedIn Special Interest Groups (post to specific relevant groups).
•	 Meetup Groups (attend meet-up groups in your area or post to 
them).
•	 Twitter (use # [hashtags] for casting a wide net or @ profiles for 
hopefully gaining a retweet among a specific group of followers).
•	 Get referrals of friends of friends who fit your customer segment.
•	 Canvas an area where there is a high concentration of your tar-
get customer segment. For instance, my students at the University 
of Southern California (USC) were able to recruit participants for 
their field study by setting up a table in a highly trafficked area 
on campus and offering free sodas (to those who passed their 
screener questions) in exchange for making an appointment to be 
part of the research study.
Just be aware of the implicit bias if you recruit from family and friends.
My team opted for Craig’s List because we assumed it would cast the 
widest net and get us the fastest responses possible. And it did. Within 
two days, we had about 75 responses. (I will discuss how to screen 
through candidates in Step 5 of Phase 1.) However, when we learned 
after the Silver Lake operation that we needed to target a more affluent 
customer segment, we opted for another method (see Chapter 9).
When advertising for participants, keep the copy of the advertisement 
simple. Here is a basic framework of a Craig’s List ad for you to build 
off of:
Title: Paid Research Study: Looking for <customer type> who have 
experience with <problem type>

 8. Conducting Guerrilla User Research   |  195
Body: Market research firm in <city> is looking for <more specific 
customer type> participants to join an upcoming paid research 
study.
The study is going to be on <day and date of the week> during the 
hours of <# - #> at a café in the <part of town> area. Please let us 
know the ideal time that works for you.
The study will last for <#> minutes and the compensation is 
$<##.00>. (optional) The study will not be recorded on audio or 
video.
Please respond with your contact information and the best time to 
reach you.
(optional) Link to survey here:
The framework can change based on the requirements of the study, 
as is evidenced by the advertisement we used for the treatment center 
operation shown in Figure 8-6.
FIGURE 8-6
Craig’s List advertisement for participant recruiting for the treatment center 
project

196  |   UX STRATEGY
No matter the advertisement, make it clear whom you are looking for 
and why you need their help. The copy should hook your potential cus-
tomer segment so that they do respond with genuine interest. Date, 
location, and time will depend on your customer segment. For exam-
ple, in the treatment center operation, my team needed to schedule 
interviews on a business day, starting in the late afternoon and run-
ning into the evening to accommodate people’s work day. In contrast, 
Bita and Ena (my former students whom I introduce in Chapter 3) ran 
their guerrilla user research on a Saturday because that’s when busy 
brides-to-be tended to be free.
When posting your advertisement on Craig’s List, you have the option 
of two kinds of ads: free or paid, with some cost variance by city. For 
example, it’s more expensive to run job ads in San Francisco than Los 
Angeles, and whether you choose a paid ad will depend on which cate-
gory you think your customer segment will visit. The two most common 
sections for running research study ads on Craig’s List Los Angeles are 
in the “et cetera” and “general labor” sections. If you are not in a hurry 
and don’t want to pay people, you can try the “volunteer” section, too.
Step 5: Screening participants and scheduling time slots
When you post an advertisement on Craig’s List or elsewhere, you are 
likely to get responses. But how do you know if the respondents are the 
people you actually want to interview? This is why screening partici-
pants is the most critical part of the planning phase. You must choose 
participants who match your hypothesized target customers to ascer-
tain if you are validating the correct problem with your solution. This is 
where thoughtful construction of screening questions comes into play. 
Look at your provisional persona and think about the critical character-
istics needed. Don’t fill your interview with friends or family. By doing 
so, your study is no longer a “controlled” experiment.
As is discussed in Chapter 3, good screener questions help you to weed-
out the wrong people. Yet, whereas you conducted them in person in 
Chapter 3, you can do it digitally now. You might ask respondents to 
your advertisement to answer questions that you know are deal break-
ers. You could send them to a tool such as Survey Monkey or even 
a Google document. For the treatment center operation, we needed 
a subject matter expert (SME) to screen our candidates. Whenever a 

 8. Conducting Guerrilla User Research   |  197
person responded to our ad, that person’s information was captured in 
a document available to the entire digital team and client. You can see 
an example of this template in Figure 8-7.
FIGURE 8-7
Participant screener and schedule
Because the respondent sent her phone number in their initial con-
tact, the SME was able to call her back. He always began the conver-
sation by double-checking the initial information and documenting 
any changes. He asked for the participant’s name, phone number, and 
times and dates she’d be available. Then, he asked her the screener 
questions, such as the following:
•	 Were you the person seeking treatment or were you seeking treat-
ment for someone else?
•	 Do you mind telling me how much you paid? Where and when did 
you go? (To confirm it was residential and for how long.)
We needed people who had paid for themselves or loved ones to go 
to a treatment center, which is why we asked the first question. We 
needed their experience to be recent (within three years), and we 
needed to ensure that they could afford paying a certain amount for 

198  |   UX STRATEGY
a rehabilitation, which is why we asked the second question. We also 
ensured that the ad didn’t reveal that potential participants would be 
grilled with screener questions as a means to help cut out respondents 
who just wanted to make money.
After we had this data, the SME gave each participant a rating of 1 (no), 
2 (maybe), or 3 (yes). After the SME’s debrief, my team called all the “3” 
participants to officially schedule them for an interview. Because peo-
ple’s schedules change, ensure that you try to get them in within 5 to 
10 days later.
INTERVIEW PHASE (ONE DAY)
In this second phase, your team is now executing the planning phase. 
Everything needs to run like clockwork, like the choreography of a bal-
let. If something goes wrong, the action cannot stop. Everybody must 
know their places and how to react and adjust if something unexpected 
happens. The show must go on.
Prepping the venue
Arrange for each researcher to arrive at the café to find a good table at 
least 30 minutes before the interviews begin. Before the interview day, 
you should instruct them on where and how to set up in the quietest 
area possible; you probably observed where this should be when you 
found the location. As mentioned previously, it should be out-of-view 
from café workers and away from major walkways, such as entrances or 
exits. All devices and laptops should also be charged before arrival. But 
to be safe, find tables near an AC power outlet, especially if you’re going 
to be there for a while. Try to avoid sitting by a window or in an outdoor 
area where there might be glare on the computer or device screen.
There should be one researcher for each table you need. The research-
ers should each bring a jacket to throw over an extra chair to save it. 
You don’t want another patron to interrupt an interview or distract the 
researcher by asking if it’s free. The researcher should do what she 
can to limit the participant’s visual distraction, too. For example, the 
researcher can sit facing out toward the main café while the participant 
sits facing the researcher and only the wall. The table should be clean—
food and beverages should be limited. Your team should always have 
eaten beforehand, and participants should receive at least one beverage 
of their choice.

 8. Conducting Guerrilla User Research   |  199
Ideally, your team will play your solution prototype on a tablet device 
because it’s easier to pass to participants, and unlike a laptop screen, 
it won’t block the participant’s face from you. Ensure that all devices 
work properly before the interviews begin. Is your demonstration func-
tioning properly on it? Can each device connect to WiFi? If a stake-
holder or note-taker joins the researcher, they should sit directly across 
from each other; this way the participants will sit in between them, 
providing an optimal view of their reactions and interactions with the 
demonstration.
Participant compensation, café etiquette, and tipping
Designate a team member to pay the participants upfront. In our Silver 
Lake scenario, the event coordinator was in charge of this, but it could 
just as easily be the stakeholder, team lead, or UX researchers. Get the 
money out of the way early so that the participants don’t wonder about 
it. Pass it to them in an unsealed envelope as opposed to handing it to 
them under the table like it’s a drug deal.
Sometimes, participants are concerned about what the compensation 
means—will this interview be used against them somehow? In the 
case of the treatment center operation, this was a real concern because 
we were documenting personal and emotional experiences. Because 
you’ve screened them beforehand, however, you know that they have a 
personal interest in helping you; it’s just a matter of reassuring them 
to participate sincerely. Pay them upfront, and be genuine. Explain that 
you are paying for their honest feedback. Tell them that you’re not here 
to pitch the product. This isn’t a “beta-test.” This is just the concept of 
a new potential product. My team even sometimes says they’re not the 
people designing it (even though we are) to put some participants at 
ease.
Because you are using this café or eatery location for free, be cognizant 
that it is a place of business; don’t be a cheapskate. Spend some money 
on beverages and food, and most importantly overtip. The team lead or 
event coordinator should bring a big wad of bills broken into smaller 
denominations. I have on several occasions put $10 in the tip jar while 
making eye contact with a barista to ask if it was possible to turn down 
the music.

Conducting the interviews
Conducting a good interview for gaining worthwhile insights is an art 
form to be mastered with practice. To learn more, check out a book 
called Interviewing Users by Steve Portigal.** It is an outstanding primer 
focused specifically on interviewing techniques for conducting user 
research out in the wild. If you are shy or new to talking to customers, 
practice with team members and friends beforehand.
Here are my basic guidelines for conducting your guerrilla user 
research interviews:
•	 Always greet people with a warm smile. I typically stand up to 
shake hands and immediately thank them for coming.
•	 Do not begin interviews with small talk. Be professional. You want 
to quickly build a rapport with them and avoid dwelling on how 
cool the café is or how difficult it was to find parking.
•	 Quickly state the reason why they are there and that you looking 
to them for their brutal honesty. Then, launch into your setup 
questions.
•	 Stick to the script. Ask additional follow-up questions if needed 
to probe deeper into specifics about how they currently solve the 
problem. Find out how, if, and why your solution would work or 
not work for them.
•	 Have the note-taker set his phone as an alarm to keep your pace 
(typically 15 minutes). The ringer should be on silent so that the 
phone vibrates to indicate to the researcher at the table that it’s time 
to move on to the solution portion of the interview, even if there are 
more questions to go.
•	 Ensure that you schedule buffer time between participants in case 
an interview does go longer than planned or a participant shows 
up late.
•	 At the end, thank the participants for their time and tell them how 
helpful their insights were. 
**	 Portigal, Steve. Interviewing Users, Rosenfeld Media, 2013.

 8. Conducting Guerrilla User Research   |  201
You also should be able to make slight changes to questions and the 
solution prototype throughout the day. This is another benefit for your 
team to conduct, collaborate, and capture data in the cloud. You can 
update questions in real time and keep all researchers abreast of the 
changes. However, don’t do anything more than small changes to the 
demonstration. Your researcher or team member will need to make 
the change and share the update to all interview groups before the next 
round of participants arrive. Also, you don’t want to change the demon-
stration and questions too much; otherwise, you’ll disrupt the baseline 
for your control group.
Extracting succinct notes
The reason you conduct guerrilla user research is that at the end of the 
day, 90 percent of the work is done, the information is organized, and 
your team has some action items to do. So, your note-taker is a very 
important component on this day. He should ideally be typing notes 
into a computer document during each interview. You can even have 
him type it directly into the UX Strategy Toolkit so that the information 
is viewable by the team in real time. If he is taking notes on paper, he 
had better be fast; immediately after the interviews he’ll need to tran-
scribe notes into the cloud or into a document that is shareable with 
the team.
During the interview, the note-taker should not worry about spelling. 
She can go back and fix it later. She should try to distill participants’ 
responses into short sentences that encapsulate the essence of their 
responses. She should focus on capturing answers (see Figure 8-8) to 
script questions without noting additional insights—that can come 
later when there is a lull between interviews and team members can 
talk. Or, it can come at the end of the day when the note-taker can clean 
up the data a little and provide insight into how to fine-tune a solution 
or pivot.

portion of the interview at a Culver City café. Participant on the left. 
During or after the interviews, the note-taker or you can also color code 
the spreadsheet to help make the analysis quicker (just as in Chapter 5 
when you analyzed the competition.) A major pain point would be col-
or-coded red. If a key experience or product concept received an easily 
fixable response, the note-taker could color-code it green. Feel free to 
develop your own system. 
ANALYSIS PHASE (TWO TO FOUR HOURS)
As I described at the beginning of the chapter, my team and the soft-
ware engineer didn’t need to analyze our findings after the guerrilla 
user research. It was clear that the business model didn’t work. The 
users we interviewed were interested in the value proposition, but they 
couldn’t afford or were not willing to put down a large enough sum of 
money Hotels.com-style to sustain the business model. The product, as 
it was, needed a direct channel to an affluent customer segment.
However, if it’s not that obvious, the analysis phase involves synthe-
sizing all the feedback from the interviews to determine your team’s 
next action. Did the guerrilla user research validate or invalidate your 
assumptions? Was the experiment a failure because the execution was 

 8. Conducting Guerrilla User Research   |  203
sloppy? Or, did something unforeseen occur such as in the case of the 
treatment center operation, in which we learned the business model 
did not work? Your goal is to use the analysis as a decision point to pivot 
in a different direction or double-down on further experiments that 
actualize the value proposition.
At the bottom of the template is a row called “Validated Learnings.” 
This is where you can put your high-level findings for each participant 
and track which participants either validated or invalidated your solu-
tion hypothesis, as shown in Figure 8-9.
To do the analysis, you need to take a step back as you did in Chapter 5. 
Zoom out from all the details that you were just bombarded with and 
think carefully about the big picture. You might find yourself doing 
one of these things:
•	 Assess to determine if the correct customer segment was reached, 
by looking at your provisional personas or initial customer discov-
ery research. If it was not the correct customer segment, begin 
making new assumptions about the right one.
•	 Assess if the problem that your product is trying to solve is an 
actual problem based on the feedback that you heard. Was it a 
small problem or a big problem?
•	 Assess if the solution that you showed was on target. If people were 
not truly excited about the value proposed in the solution proto-
type, think through possible ways to improve it.
•	 If the value proposition was validated, congratulations! However, 
don’t stop there. Determine if there are any easy fixes that can be 
made to improve the user experience.
FIGURE 8-9
Validated Learnings

204  |   UX STRATEGY
•	 If the value proposition was not validated, assess why immedi-
ately. Was it because you had the wrong customer, problem, and 
or solution? Is it fixable? How can you change the product or user 
experience?
•	 Listen to the signal. If the experiment was an abysmal failure, 
resolve to take a break while you reset your entrepreneurial or 
intrapreneurial clock.
•	 If you have a client or stakeholder who does not believe in your 
research and wants to build the product regardless, you face an 
existential challenge wherein you are trying to balance your princi-
ples and your pocket book. Only you (and your spouse) can answer 
this one.
Enter your insights, answers, and conclusions into a spreadsheet in the 
UX Strategy Toolkit at the bottom of each participant’s column quickly. 
You want to make the turnaround on your team’s decisions fast. 
You are now at the end of your guerrilla user research, and you are once 
again at a crossroads:
•	 You invalidated your value proposition. If you are wrong about 
your original customer segment, go back to Chapter 3 (customer 
discovery).
•	 You invalidated your value proposition. If you are wrong about your 
solution, go back to Chapter 4, Chapter 5, Chapter 6, and Chapter 7
•	 You validated that you have product/market fit. Go build a func-
tional MVP and move on to Chapter 9
Recap
Conducting guerrilla user research (especially with stakeholders pres-
ent) can feel intimidating at first, but the more you do it, the less scary 
it becomes. It has the benefits of immediacy and transparency. Plus, 
your entire team and the stakeholder will be better off learning sooner 
rather than later if your solution works. Plus, you do it as a team; every-
one is equally invested in the outcome. They have the benefit of really 
seeing how users will experience the product.

Designing for Conversion
You can’t play in the man’s game, you can’t close them—go home

BLAKE FROM THE DAVID MAMET SCREENPLAY, GLENGARRY

If you want to be a closer, you must constantly tweak your UX 
strategy to increase successful outcomes for user engagement and cus-
tomer acquisition. You need to design efficient funnels that do every-
thing from engage first-time visitors to eventually convert them to 
repeat customers. Customers include anybody and everybody that you 
need to engage for your value proposition and business model to work. 
And yes, users who don’t pay for your service are customers, too. As 
people begin entering from the top of the funnel, you must immedi-
ately track and measure all the crucial data points along the way so that 
you can validate your product’s success.
This is known as designing for conversion or optimizing your product. The 
process ties together all the tenets, as depicted in Figure 9-1. In this 
chapter, I’ll demonstrate how successful UX strategy uses analytics to 
optimize the UX design from the user’s first impression of the value 
prop to the user becoming happily addicted to the product. A tool called 
the Funnel Matrix will demonstrate how to align your entire team on 
different stages of customer acquisition by identifying measurable 
metrics for them to take action on to pull the customer into a deeper 
level of engagement.

Seeding Growth Hackers
Growth hacking is a term coined in 2010 by Sean Ellis, a marketing 
blogger and entrepreneur.* The concept behind it is for product teams 
to come up with extremely clever, cost-efficient ways to increase cus-
tomer growth. Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Airbnb, and Dropbox are 
companies that have all used growth hacking techniques to become 
successful. Hardcore growth hackers are a crossbreed of marketers, 
coders, and analytics experts. They are masters of analytics tools, traf-
fic generation, and product optimization with a deep understanding 
of the innards of search-engine optimization (SEO), ad platforms, and 
social media tools. They are called hackers because they are ruthlessly 
focused on growing the business by any means necessary. They push 
the limits of traditional marketing using techniques such as A/B tests, 
landing pages, viral factors, email deliverability, and social media inte-
gration. The goal of growth hacking is to tie viral and paid ad cam-
paigns to user engagement metrics so that you can identify the most

valuable marketing channels. Growth hacking entails continuous tin-
kering with the product’s sales funnel so that it is fully optimized for 
acquiring new users and getting them more deeply engaged.
In the case of TradeYa, our core team knew we were out of our depth. 
We could design, strategize, and develop the MVP. We could fill out 
the Funnel Matrix—we knew what kind of answers we needed. What 
we didn’t have was the expertise to get those answers from the metrics 
and analytics reports in front of us. We didn’t know how all the tools 
and dashboards worked, but we had to run hardcore tests to refine and 
perfect our MVP to relaunch in 30 days. It was the Christmas holidays, 
and we were pretty sure it was a fantasy to hope for a highly advanced 
growth hacker with usability testing and design skills to end up at our 
door. Plus, we had a budget of only about $5,000. So, we decided to hack 
together some growth hackers of our own.
That’s how the TradeYa MVP Apprentice Program was born. Jared and 
I wanted to diversify our budget with as many fresh minds as possible 
who would work collaboratively on connecting all the analytical tools 
we needed to update the existing MVP. They would use the Funnel 
Matrix to plug in the feedback data from each other of their initiatives 
so that we could validate all the assumptions the core team had made 
about the levels of user engagement. Figure 9-2 shows the blog post we 
used to attract the talent we needed.
FIGURE 9-2
Help wanted: experimenters for testing the TradeYa MVP
Within 72 hours of JLR Interactive’s “Help Wanted: Lean UX 
Apprentices” post blasting through the Twitterverse and LinkedIn, 
all 8 spots were filled with qualified individuals, hand-picked for this 
challenge. They came from all over Los Angeles and included profes-
sionals with advanced skills in architecture, marketing, engineering, 

208  |   UX STRATEGY
and psychology, with degrees from MIT, Cornell, NYU, and UCLA. 
Although some of the apprentices already had an understanding of UX 
design and the Lean Startup approach, the intent was to take advan-
tage of the cross-pollinating catalyst effect of their diverse expertise 
and backgrounds from outside of UX by throwing them into the deep 
end of hands-on MVP testing and optimization.
We were really lucky. Our apprentices were eager and focused when 
they met for the first time in an intensive workshop on January 2, 2013. 
During a whirlwind three hours, the eight apprentices were brought 
up to speed (see Figure 9-3) with the history, philosophy, and MVP of 
TradeYa. First they learned about the principles of conversion-centric 
design for customer acquisition. Then we discussed how they would 
stay aligned through collaboration and task delegation using a cloud-
based tool that I devised called The Funnel Matrix.
FIGURE 9-3

eight TradeYa Lean UX apprentices 
TradeYa’s testing phase ran from January 1, 2013 to February 28, 2013. 
Over the course of the first 30 days, the apprentices learned about ana-
lytics tools, set up those tools for TradeYa, and then acted as users 
themselves—trading and bidding on one another’s items—to test the 

 9. Designing for Conversion   |  209
product’s transaction funnel. They would then verify whether the tools 
were capturing the key metrics accurately. Any changes in hypoth-
eses were also continually updated in the Funnel Matrix, which the 
entire team could view and track. For our measuring tools, we ended 
up using Google Analytics and KISSmetrics—the development team 
added JavaScript code to all HTML pages.
Jared and I closely watched and guided the development to ensure that 
we got the data points we needed. This way, when we launched the 
MVP, we would be able to track all the desired actions required for 
users to successfully trade.
Lessons Learned
•	 To design for conversion, you really need to bring together a 
cross-functional team including designers, developers, product 
managers, and marketers. The marketing and sales team cre-
ates a list of initiatives and must be able to act quickly on it. The 
development team also has a list of metrics that they need to 
track and measure.
•	 The output of the Funnel Matrix technique directly informs 
the user flow, feature list, and a short list of wireframes to be 
designed or redesigned that are optimized for a desired user 
action. 
•	 The data and metrics help with every stage in the sales funnel to 
make continual improvements and give insights into your cus-
tomers’ actions.
Using the Funnel Matrix Tool
A funnel is a cone-shaped utensil with a tube at the apex for conduct-
ing liquid or another substance through a small opening. When I put 
oil into my car’s engine, I use a funnel to increase the success rate that 
oil will make it directly to where it’s supposed to go. The funnel is the 
mechanism I use to avoid waste.
In the ecommerce world, waste happens when potential customers 
aren’t funneled into the engine of a product. Somewhere along the way, 
the customers did not sign up, activate their accounts, initiate a trans-
action, complete a transaction, or some other reason. In other terms, 

210  |   UX STRATEGY
the customer did not experience the value proposition correctly and 
might have clicked away without satisfying his needs. The design of 
the ecommerce or digital product funnel didn’t convert him into an 
engaged customer.
In the book The Entrepreneur’s Guide to Customer Development,† authors 
Brant Cooper and Patrick Vlaskovits use a Funnel Matrix to represent 
how a prospective customer goes “from Internet ‘Googler’ to satisfied 
user.” I was inspired to expand the concept and create my own tool for 
dialing in the metrics directly correlated to UX strategy.
The purpose of filling out the Funnel Matrix, which you can see in 
Figure 9-4, is to force the entire team involved with the product—stake-
holders, product managers, marketers, visual designers, developers, 
and everybody else involved—to think through all the required actions 
potential users and customers must make as they progress down the 
funnel to become repeat users. The Funnel Matrix’s other purpose is 
to validate, measure, and learn ways to better optimize the user’s expe-
rience to increase conversion rates. After I began experimenting with, 
using, and tweaking this tool, I quickly discovered that it allowed me to 
be more empirical and less precious with my own UX strategy process.
FIGURE 9-4

The Funnel Matrix tool shows different stages of user engagement and 
acquisition as well as the criteria to evaluate for each stage. I created 
this Funnel Matrix using Google Spreadsheets so that my team could 
collaborate and work on it simultaneously. (A copy of the template is 
available in the UX Strategy Toolkit.)

Note that how you use the Funnel Matrix will depend on where you are 
in your product development cycle:
•	 If you have an existing product or MVP like Jared had with TradeYa, 
your team can use the entire matrix to optimize it. Tweak and mea-
sure your metrics until you get it right.
•	 If you are designing wireframes for your first functional MVP, use 
the Funnel Matrix to speculate on the levels of user engagement 
and the key metrics you might use. Then, you will test the top (sus-
pect) level with something like a landing page test, which I’ll dis-
cuss later in the chapter.
•	 If you are still in the conceptual part (storyboards, prototypes, and 
so on) of your UX strategy, take this as opportunity to get an over-
view of where you will end up when your team is ready to design 
for conversion. I’ll also teach you what to do when you’re ready to 
validate the top of your funnel.
WHY A MATRIX AND NOT A MAP?
At this point, a few UX strategists might scratch their heads and won-
der why I’m not advocating for a journey map (also called an experi-
ence map). A journey map looks like a flowchart and shows all touch 
points. It’s a visual representation of the user’s journey and interaction 
through the UX of your product. It is generally created from output fol-
lowing a collaborative brainstorming session with product stakehold-
ers. Sometimes these maps are quite complex to decipher, especially if 
you were not a participant during the session. If you haven’t seen one of 
these maps, do a keyword search for them on Google Images.
When used effectively, a journey map can aid the UX strategist and 
stakeholders in envisioning cross-channel experiences through digital 
and nondigital touch points. Personally, I find that the map takes too 
darn long to create and lacks accountability because it is rarely bench-
marked to the product’s reality after it begins to be released. Here’s 
what I’ve seen happen all too often: the key stakeholders, internal UX 
team, or both are called together for a consensus-building session. 
They break into groups, jot down ideas on sticky notes, and then post 
them on a wall or board. Everybody stands back while the most asser-
tive participants reorganize the concepts into clusters. At the end of 
the session, someone takes photos of the lovely yellow papers. The 
designer turns these concept clusters into what often appear to be zany 

212  |   UX STRATEGY
circuitous informational diagrams that would potentially give Edward 
Tufte‡ a stroke. The posters are then hung or stored somewhere in the 
office to hopefully influence employees on their way to the bathroom.
If you strive to be more empirical in your strategic process, you need to 
develop this approach and deliverable into a system of disciplined pro-
cedures that are gauged and updated throughout the product ideation 
phase and development cycle. That’s why I prefer using a cloud-based 
matrix as a centralized data depository. With this customizable tool, 
everybody on a team can work collaboratively and even from multiple 
locations. You can usually do the first pass in two to four hours, and 
afterward it is easily accessible for everyone to update. The output is 
easy to interpret, and, more important, the matrix can serve as a central 
data depository for metric reports after the product is released and iter-
ated upon. When, in his book The Lean Startup,§ Eric Ries talks about 
lean accounting with real-world metrics, this Funnel Matrix is how 
you can harness it for the UX. So please put your sticky notes away (at 
least, for now). Let’s begin to explore and fill out the Funnel Matrix tool. 
(For a different opinion on journey maps, check out what Experience 
Strategist veteran Holly North has to say about them in Chapter 10.)
ROCKING THE FUNNEL MATRIX
The first time I tested the Funnel Matrix tool was on TradeYa with 
Jared. For months, we had been sifting through analytics reports that 
measured hundreds of user actions and trying to make big-picture 
decisions based on them. But we figured it would be more efficient to 
try to make smaller decisions based on validated data output from sin-
gular user actions. We needed to focus our time, energy, and money on 
being able to make meaningful changes to our MVP in order to answer 
questions coming in from our investors. Thus, Jared, the developers 
(who Skyped in from India), and I spent an intense four-hour period 
filling out the exercise.
In the UX Funnel Matrix tool, you have rows and columns made up of 
cells that need to be populated with your team’s carefully considered 
input. This input is driven by your user’s story, a narrative told over a 
specific period of time. If Jane discovers your online product (for the

purposes of this example, TradeYa) while cruising her Facebook feed, 
what stages must she go through to become an active user? She’s prob-
ably not going to go from “suspect” to “repeat user” in one giant leap. 
Instead, she needs to be effortlessly funneled to this deeper level of inter-
action with your product. Therefore, each row conveys a snapshot of her 
story as she moves through the stages from first-time exposure to a dedi-
cated user who eventually helps you to market your product.
You also want to set a time limit for your experiment, because it gives 
your team deadlines for measuring expected outcomes for different 
hypotheses. For TradeYa, we capped our length at 60 days. We wanted 
this limit because we wanted to know what it would take to have a 
user transition from a customer who doesn’t pay to one who does. We 
believed that if we could not make the users convert in this amount of 
time, we would be at a point of diminishing returns.
THE VERTICAL AXIS
The rows in the Funnel Matrix contain the stages of user engagement 
for your online product. These stage labels should be directly cor-
related to the business model of your product, as illustrated in Figure 
9-5. Different products require different engines for growth. There is a 
great table in the book Lean Analytics¶ that I like to refer to while I go 
through each of the rows.
FIGURE 9-5
Business model stages from Lean Analytics
I recommend that you start the Funnel Matrix exercise with the generic 
stage definitions provided but take time to customize them as the con-
tent and the data for the other cells falls into place. You might not need

214  |   UX STRATEGY
the exact stage labels shown in Figure 9-6, because there will be known 
and unknown exceptions about how people will engage with your prod-
uct. But these generic labels will get you started. What is crucial about 
the stages is that they flow as a linear and measurable progression 
down the funnel of the product.
FIGURE 9-6
The vertical axis of the Funnel Matrix
Start by trying to make it across the first row before defining the other 
stages, especially if you are new to customer development techniques. 
As the desired actions come into focus, you will understand that the 
definitions are directly tied to your actual user engagement strategy 
as users first begin to discover your product. Then, you work your way 
down. The column headings are the different factors that you need to 
discuss and debate with your team. I’ll explain these in more detail 
later in the chapter.
For each stage, I will first give a generic description and then an exam-
ple of what specifically we put into a cell for TradeYa. For this chapter, 
I will also modify the definition given at the beginning of the book in 
which the term “user” is interchangeable with the term “customer.” For 
the Funnel Matrix, a user will be defined as someone who moves from 
the beginning of the funnel to the end and then becomes an engaged 
(and paying) customer.

 9. Designing for Conversion   |  215
Suspect stage
A suspect is a user who might possibly require your product or service. 
For TradeYa’s Funnel Matrix, a Suspect was anybody who had or ever 
wanted goods or services. Yes, this sounds like everybody because, in 
fact, it means everybody. Therein lies a problem; a horizontal market-
place containing everybody is too wide. To zoom into your suspect, you 
need to narrow the categories to the types of goods or services that your 
specific segment would want. As depicted in Figure 9-7, the TradeYa 
Suspect is also somebody who thinks it would be cool to trade things 
for social reasons. We knew this type of user existed because of cloth-
ing swaps, collector clubs, and other trading sites. We felt like we were 
looking for a Suspect who was similar to a user who might use the bar-
tering section on Craig’s List.
FIGURE 9-7
Zoomed into the Suspect stage of the TradeYa Funnel Matrix
Lead stage
A lead is a potential sales contact, an individual, or an organization that 
expresses an interest in your product or services by providing you with 
some personal contact information, generally via email. You want to 
have a means to contact them. This begins your official relationship 
with the user.
For TradeYa, a Lead is somebody who landed on a TradeYa page, regard-
less of how she gets there, and then signs up for the site. She could 
come from various touch points: social media, word-of-mouth, or an 
organic search.
Prospect stage
A prospect is anyone who has a need and strongly wants this need met 
through the purchase or consumption of your particular product. He is 
now in the negotiation phase toward becoming either a paid customer 
or engaged user (to be defined in the next stage).

216  |   UX STRATEGY
For TradeYa, a Prospect is somebody who sees something he specifi-
cally wants or has something specific he wants to trade; he posts some-
thing to trade or he bids on a trade already posted on the site. This user 
takes the first action possible on the MVP interface toward engaging in 
an actual transaction of our key experience.
Customer stage
A customer is a person or organization that is valuable to your busi-
ness model. Customers either pay to use the product or they contribute 
something that is valuable to other users. In a two-sided market and in 
the freemium economy of the Web, this could be content, a listing, or 
request.
For TradeYa, a Customer is a user who engages in and completes a suc-
cessful trade. This means that after bidding, she wins the trade and 
successfully completes the transaction, or vice versa.
Repeat User stage
Repeat users are customers who “regularly” use your product or service.
For TradeYa, a Repeat User is somebody who is involved in multiple 
transactions. He trades something and then continues to offer or bid 
on items or services to trade.
Reference User stage
A reference user is somebody who refers others to the site based purely 
on her initial or continued experience. She brings other suspects to 
your product by spreading the word. This is called virality and feeds 
that engine of growth (refer to Figure 9-5).
The reference user can refer people to your product regardless of what 
stage she is in the funnel. References are crucial to improving your 
sales funnel because they bring new users to the site through their own 
personal recommendations. You must love these people and work dili-
gently at making them insanely happy with your product.
For TradeYa, a Reference User is somebody who shares a TradeYa page, 
whether it is one that she was promoting or just a page she found 
interesting.

 9. Designing for Conversion   |  217
THE HORIZONTAL AXIS
User’s Process
The User’s Process (see Figure 9-8) describes the types of activities that 
users will be engaging in at each stage as they experience your product. 
Where are they exactly? What task are they trying to complete? For the 
UX designer on your team, the User’s Process is probably going to be 
the easiest step in the Funnel Matrix to articulate.
For the TradeYa example, let’s begin with the first level of user engage-
ment—the Suspect. What if I were to walk outside of my house and 
begin screaming at the top of my lungs, “Stop spending money. Use 
TradeYa!” For the neighbors who hear me, this action would trigger 
their first impression of TradeYa as a product. A new neighbor across 
the street—one who doesn’t know me—might either ignore me or call 
the police. However, my friendly next-door neighbor might overhear 
these words and want to learn more.
Consequently, for the Suspect’s user process, you must think, “What 
are my initial touch points with potential customers?” The phrase 
“touch point” is business jargon for however you first “touch” or engage 
with your customer. A Suspect might discover TradeYa on social media. 
Or, instead of discovering a product through a neighbor’s yells, maybe 
he sees a friend’s tweet or Facebook post with a shared TradeYa link: 
“Check out this surfboard that I’m trading!” Suspects also might dis-
cover TradeYa or a TradeYa item listing through an organic search.
Ultimately, what should go in this column cell is what your team thinks 
are the most likely ways users will initially discover the product. These 
“ways” are your sales channels and tactics for acquiring customers. 
Discover, explore, and experiment with all of them.
FIGURE 9-8
User’s Process cell in 
the TradeYa Funnel 
Matrix

218  |   UX STRATEGY
Desired Action
The Desired Action for the Funnel Matrix (see Figure 9-9) is what you 
hope users do in response to the “process” they just experienced. It is 
the action that you want them to take. This could be anything from 
favoriting a tweet, downloading your app, or clicking a link to a web 
page.
Let’s go back to my TradeYa example on the residential street. If my 
new hypothetical neighbor hasn’t called the police, she potentially a) 
whipped out her smartphone and googled TradeYa, b) searched for 
TradeYa on her computer later at home or work, or c) shared the strange 
experience with her social network or at the office with her coworkers 
around the espresso machine.
But joking about yelling aside, the desired response for the Suspect 
stage is for your user to have a positive reaction to her first exposure to 
your project. Obviously, bad first impressions equal very bad UX. You 
must ensure that the suspect reacts in the way that you want. Think 
about what happens next for her in terms of the type of content/mes-
saging/experience that she encounters. Are there one or more scenar-
ios or technology contexts (for example, mobile versus desktop) that 
need to be addressed? Do all new users come through the front door 
(your product’s home page) or can they also come through various side 
doors (a Facebook link from a friend’s feed that goes to a product-level 
page)? In each case, you’d better ensure that the value proposition is 
conveyed clearly.
To fill out the Desired Action cell in your Funnel Matrix, think about 
what your primary goal is for that user to perform. It could be any type 
of activity, ranging from getting the user to enter his email address, 
to signing in with his Facebook account, to clicking the “Place your 
order” button. If your product’s revenue stream is from selling banner

or video advertising, the goal is to make the content pages more com-
pelling with plenty of “Read More” links to keep customers clicking 
and swiping. If you want to increase the Time on Site (ToS), you proba-
bly want plenty of related onsite articles to keep users bouncing around 
your pages like an endless game of pinball.
The desired response can be different depending on the user’s level of 
engagement. A suspect just needs to have a positive experience, but a 
Customer might need to respond by clicking a Submit or Buy button. 
Think on a granular level about the shortest path of required actions to 
get your users happily down the funnel.
Business Task
Now take off your UX strategy hat and put on your marketing cap. It’s 
time to look at the Funnel Matrix from the standpoint of your business 
goals, as illustrated in Figure 9-10. This is where you need to address 
what must happen behind the scenes to enable the user’s process. 
This includes both tried-and-true online advertising campaigns and 
new forms of growth hacking. The basic concept is to build marketing 
organically into the product, as opposed to piling it on top of the com-
pleted product and then tying it back with metrics. This is absolutely 
critical to the UX strategy. Business strategy and interaction design 
must go hand-in-hand.
Thus, the business task at the Suspect stage for you and your team is to 
find new channels and try lots of experiments to reach your potential 
customers and grab their attention. This requires consideration of the 
different touch points and contexts in which users might discover your 
product—on Facebook, on their mobile devices, on their computers at 
work, or simply overheard at the espresso machine.
Fill your Business Task cell in the Funnel Matrix with creative and ratio-
nal expectations for your business to meet, such as buying Facebook 
advertising to increase traffic or clever social media campaigns. You

want to get users to promote your product because it makes them look 
cool. Just know that whatever you place in this cell needs to be truly 
supported by the business to obtain your desired actions.
Metrics
As sales and marketing people know too well, success is determined by 
the numbers. Your Funnel Matrix metrics are your units of measure-
ment for how well (among other things) your users have performed 
your desired action. They can also tell you things such as how many 
users came from Facebook versus LinkedIn, or which of the top three 
major cities in the US sent the most traffic volume to the site. Metrics 
can be powerful indicators of success or failure if you choose to mea-
sure the right items and if that data is accurate. For each stage of user 
engagement, there will be one particular metric that really matters. 
Focus on that one like an obsessed “closer” who wants to keep his tar-
get customers engaged.
In the case of the TradeYa Suspects, this meant being able to analyze 
data about the behavior of new visitors, as shown in Figure 9-11. If the 
Suspect didn’t come to TradeYa through the home page, what therefore 
were the most trafficked pages? What was the bounce rate? How many 
minutes did she interact with the site? Analytics tools provide a lot of 
data, but it’s up to us as savvy and smart UX strategists to know which 
data represents the key metrics at each stage.
What goes in metrics columns are those quantifiable “things” you plan 
to measure at each stage that specifically tie a user’s action to a level 
of engagement. Metrics are shown as totals, percentages, and ratios. 
Marketing people, stakeholders, and your design/development team 
should all become familiar with what the metrics mean. For example, a 
common metric is the “Average Visit Duration” (see Figure 9-12), which 
represents the time a user spends on the site and is measured in min-
utes and seconds. But this metric is more relevant for certain business 
FIGURE 9-11

models such as media sites trying to sell advertising. For ecommerce 
sites we should be looking at transactions. For SaaS, we dread “churn,” 
which is the number of customers lost over a given time period. A pri-
mary goal in SaaS is customer retention. Retention = stickiness = habit-
ual use = returning customers.
Figure 9-12 presents the Average Visit Duration metrics for a page on 
TradeYa.
FIGURE 9-12
TradeYa monthly metrics from 2013
Lean Startup guru Eric Ries states that the real metrics are “action-
able metrics that either confirm or refute a previously stated hypothesis 
(stated in customer discovery).” This means that you want to measure 
things that demonstrate your product is actually working and that the 
users are engaged. However, investors and stakeholders like totals and 
percentages, so a common trap is to look at page views or other vanity 
metrics that don’t represent anything more than your ability to buy or 
drive traffic to your landing pages. Vanity metrics only represent how 
many people have come to your front door. What really matters more is 
what percentage of those people opened it and began snooping around. 
It’s easy to get lost in all the data that can be captured or to measure 
the wrong things that mean nothing at all. Your focus needs to be on 
measuring true indicators or “key metrics” that signify that your value 
proposition is working. Investors and stakeholders want to know about 
percentages.

222  |   UX STRATEGY
Required Functionality
The required functionality are the features and platforms (i.e., Twitter) 
that your team must enable and integrate for that level of the funnel to 
work from a UX perspective. Filling out this column is a shortcut to 
distilling the feature set for an MVP or beta version of a product. This 
feature set must work for an entire user journey and is absolutely criti-
cal to the product itself working.
Each feature needs to be something that will make the product better 
and easier to use rather than more complicated. Focus on the features 
that enable the product to work well and that are carefully considered 
from these multiple perspectives: user value, level of effort to build, 
and business value. Balance the level of effort it will take to build the 
feature set against the impact it could have on the product. How many 
people will actually use it or have requested it? Is it a unique feature 
to your product that will set it apart from competitors, or will it just 
be a neat gimmick that people will try once and never use again? The 
Funnel Matrix tool will help you to measure the impact by tying it to 
specific engagement metrics. After you have traction, you can experi-
ment with more risky features.
For TradeYa, the features that were absolutely crucial were the ability 
to bid on an existing trade and the ability to post a specific item to 
trade (see Figure 9-13). Account creation was circumvented by requir-
ing users to have and sign-in via a Facebook account. We also needed a 
polling feature to learn what our customers were interested in trading. 
As discussed in Chapter 7, we chose to hold off on user profiles and a 
transactional system because they were not critical to our first goal: get 
people to trade something on TradeYa with the lowest barrier to entry.
Validated Learnings
At this point, we take heed and inspiration from Thomas Dolby and his 
song “She Blinded Me With Science”: “She blinded me with science and 
hit me with technology.” Yes, it’s time for you to put on your lab coat and 
think like scientists, logically and without emotion. The entire purpose 
of this Funnel Matrix is to help you answer qualitative questions about 
FIGURE 9-13
Required Functionality 
cell in the TradeYa 
Funnel Matrix

 9. Designing for Conversion   |  223
your product using verified data for comparative benchmarking. These 
questions that you ask are to keep your team honest about your custom-
er’s behavior and business tasks throughout each level of engagement. 
Like scientists, you must ask tough questions, analyze your data, and not 
be blinded by your own hopes for the outcome. Keep it real.
For TradeYa, the big question at the Suspect stage was “Where were our 
customers coming from who would become long-term customers?” We 
wanted to know which of our channels (Twitter, Facebook, Google Ads, 
or organic search) was the most effective. We needed to do more of what-
ever was working. After our suspect landed on a TradeYa page, the vali-
dated learning became more specific to the suspect’s actions. What types 
of goods or services had the most people bidding to trade? For goods, was 
it laptops or furniture? For services, was it web consulting or day labor-
ers? Were people trading more goods than services? We wanted answers 
to help us fine-tune the site and match the enthusiasm demonstrated by 
early adopters when Jared was providing concierge service. We needed to 
understand at a granular level who they were, where they came from, and 
what things they were most interested in trading.
The things you expect and need to learn about your customers go here 
(Figure 9-14). You are trying to devise a predictable and scalable method-
ology for generating engaged and evangelistic users. To get there you need 
repeatable outcomes from your experiments and metrics. You will notice 
that the questions become more specific about your customer’s behavior 
as their engagement with your product progresses down the funnel.
You need to use every logic circuit in your brain to ensure that these 
questions are answerable and measurable. How much traffic has come 
to the top-level home page from organic search compared to an item page 
from social media? This is a measurable question. How intrigued were 
these users when they got to the landing page? This is not measurable.

In his book Programmed or be Programmed,** Douglas Rushkoff writes: 
“[Not] everything is a data point. Yes, thanks to the digital archive we 
can retrieve any piece of data on our terms, but we do so at the risk of 
losing its context.” What Rushkoff is talking about is the ability to look 
at data with a discerning eye. Or, if possible, find a way to cross-ref-
erence the validated hypothesis against other data points. So show 
another team member your logic for tracking metrics that validate 
or disprove any meaningful customer discoveries. Make sure you all 
agree your learnings are correct.
By now the funnel matrix exercise might feel like a science experiment. 
That’s because it is. You are conducting a methodical procedure with 
the goal of validating or falsifying your hypothesis—your product’s 
unique value proposition to your perceived customers. You are using 
metrics to give insight into whether the cause (user process + busi-
ness task) will generate a positive user effect (desired action). The out-
comes (success or failure) are basically your validated learnings. The 
Funnel Matrix you develop will become a Build, Measure, Learn device 
that you deploy, rinse, and repeat throughout the weeks or months of 
your testing phase or even the entire life cycle of the product. It can be 
the reference point (see Figure 9-15) as the business makes continuous 
improvements. The UX person on your team can even lead the Funnel 
Matrix development.
Remember, though, this tool requires a balanced and involved team to 
solve the many problems and puzzles of your user’s experience. The 
UX designer shouldn’t and can’t realistically work alone. The main rea-
son is that so much of what will make the Funnel Matrix indispensible 
to your team is tied up in the analytics and metrics of your product. 
Instead, this is a chance for a savvy marketing team member to shine 
by growth hacking the Funnel Matrix to possible customer acquisi-
tion initiatives, as I explained in the beginning of the chapter with the 
TradeYa Apprentice Program.

Analytics Tools for UX Dummies
Let’s take a short break to briefly examine some useful analytics tools avail-
able today for tracking the right metrics for improving the UX. You must 
measure your experiments to know if you are converting users as your team 
releases new iterations. Specifically with the UX strategy, you need to know 
if your layout tweaks are helping to increase user acquisition, engagement, 
and successful transactions. The danger of talking about specific tools is 
that the best tools du jour constantly change. So I broke them into the fol-
lowing three categories.
Enterprise-oriented analytics reporting tools
Popular tools: Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics
High-level description: Reporting tools are focused on generating 
detailed statistics about an app or website’s traffic and traffic sources. 
Google Analytics is the most widely used service and offers both a 
free basic service and a premium version. Adobe Analytics (formerly 
Omniture) is another tool that is focused on the enterprise market. 
These tools require a developer or analytics specialist for both imple-
mentation and monitoring. 
Dashboards, funnel conversion, A/B testing
Popular Tools: KISSmetrics, Optimizely, Geckoboard, Mixpanel, Totango, 
Chartbeat
High-level description: Dashboard and conversion tools give you one 
visual place to watch all your metrics in real time from numerous ser-
vices (for example, Google Analytics and Facebook). You can use them 
to measure customer engagement and retention by reporting on spe-
cific actions. They also focus on segmentation, so you can see who your 
users are and where they are coming from, and break them up into 
cohorts for conducting A/B and multivariate testing.

226  |   UX STRATEGY
Email delivery/tracking services
Popular Tools: SendGrid, MailChimp, iContact, Constant Contact
High-level description: Email service providers are used for sending 
out highly targeted messages to website visitors or mobile app users 
based on what they do (and don’t do) while they are using the prod-
uct. “Deliverability” is the measure, usually expressed as a percent-
age of how many emails actually make it into the inbox of your user. 
Successful campaigns are based on a solid marketing strategy for 
sending the right amount of timely and relevant content to keep users 
engaged with the product and not opting out.
Conducting Suspect Stage Experiments with  
Landing Pages
What if you don’t have a product or MVP at this stage in the game? 
Well, you still have a funnel to work with, but it will just all be hypo-
thetical. You can’t really connect any metrics to any of the levels yet, 
except for one: the Suspect.
You can potentially growth-hack the Suspect stage of your funnel with 
Landing Page experiments. But, before I get into that, let’s begin with 
a few basics. A landing page is a web page that is not the home page 
of your product. Landing pages are designed to specifically elicit one 
key action from users. They are also sometimes called lead capture 
pages, squeeze pages, and destination pages. Users are driven to land-
ing pages from multiple touch points—organic search results, advertis-
ing, and social network campaigns. The pages are basically specifically 
designed to suck potential customers into the top of your funnel.
There are many different ways in which you can use landing pages on 
unwary suspects to validate a value proposition. I will use case studies 
to illustrate how.
CASE STUDY 1: WHEN A VALUE PROPOSITION NEEDS TO PIVOT
Chapter 8 recounts how the software engineer who conceived the idea 
for a Hotels.com-type website for rehabilitation centers found himself 
in a pretty tough spot. Figure 9-16 shows what the Book Your Care orig-
inal home page looked like.

 9. Designing for Conversion   |  227
FIGURE 9-16
The Book Your Care original home page
The guerrilla user research that we conducted on his behalf had inval-
idated his business model. The current website was not working, and 
he knew that spending money on a redesign without proper validation 
was going to be wasteful. So what could he do?
He needed to know if the affluent customer segment would be as 
enthusiastic about his value innovation as the control group from the 
user research. My team and stakeholders hustled to find a channel 
to this user group. We ran ads on Craig’s List. We took out advertis-
ing in glossy magazines in Beverly Hills. The client and I even went 
to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings where we posed as loved ones 
of addicts to learn more about our elusive customer. That’s when we 
decided to run a Landing Page experiment as a last-ditch effort. We 
knew we needed to run this online advertising campaign to target the 
affluent customer segment. But treatment centers spend millions of 
dollars targeting this group on Google and Facebook. So not only would 
the campaign be expensive, but our ocean was going to be bloody red.

228  |   UX STRATEGY
We decided to use a product called Unbounce to quickly build out vari-
ations of the value proposition and test them by using targeted online 
advertising campaigns through Google and Facebook. This effectively 
put the current site on hold. We wouldn’t disrupt any of the complex 
backend. The developers wouldn’t have to waste any time, energy, or 
money on fixing it for the experiment. Instead, if any suspects did go 
through our Landing Page experiment, we would concierge them (as 
Jared did, as described in Chapter 7) through the process of booking a 
treatment center.
Figure 9-17 shows what the test landing page looked like.
To drive traffic to our landing page, we did targeted advertising on 
Facebook. We ran ads to users who lived in wealthy neighborhoods in 
Los Angeles. Here is where you want to be careful, because it’s easy to 
spend more money than you want or need to for a small trial. That’s 
why we came up with the following boundaries:
•	 We decided on an initial budget of $500.
•	 We determined the key words for the campaign.
•	 We finalized the advertisement copy to ensure that the messaging 
would be strong enough to drive suspects to the landing page.
•	 We established the customer demographics (such as education, 
city, and age).
•	 We decided on when exactly the campaign should start.
•	 We placed the campaign, which you can see in Figure 9-18, and 
then we waited!

FIGURE 9-18
The Facebook ad campaign
Because my team used a robust tool like Unbounce, we were able to run 
two variants of the landing page simultaneously from one Facebook 
campaign. Unbounce automatically directed half of our traffic to each 
page. The two landing pages tested two different pricing strategies, as 
depicted in Figure 9-19. This is called A/B testing.
FIGURE 9-19
A/B Testing Centre dashboard
In this experiment, our key metrics were the number of visitors who 
clicked the Facebook advertisement (suspects) and then the conver-
sions that we got—how many users would buy into the value prop-
osition and give us their contact information (leads). In Figure 9-19, 
you can see that out of 1,000-plus visitors, only 5 users were converted 
successfully into Leads. Half of them were representatives from other 
treatment centers trying to do some research on the competition. The 
one person whom we did manage to concierge was for a food addiction. 

 9. Designing for Conversion   |  231
CASE STUDY 2: WHEN A VALUE PROPOSITION NEEDS  
TO ACQUIRE LEADS
Another reason to experiment with landing pages is lead generation. 
The goal is to acquire as many email addresses as possible of real peo-
ple who have had some level of exposure to your value proposition. In 
Chapter 7, I explain how Jared created an explainer video to articulate 
the benefits of trading. This occurred before our MVP testing phase, 
and it’s a good example of customer acquisition through landing pages.
First, Jared ran an ad campaign on Facebook. He specifically targeted 
Facebook users who lived in the US who had “liked” the Beats by Dre 
electronics page. He ran two different ads, one of which you can see in 
Figure 9-20.
FIGURE 9-20
TradeYa Facebook online ad campaign

232  |   UX STRATEGY
Users who clicked on either campaign were directed to the landing page 
shown in Figure 9-21, which had the explainer video on it. Basically, 
Jared used the giveaway to drive traffic to the landing page. When users 
arrived on the landing page, they could not simply submit their email 
address for the contest and leave. Instead, they had to watch the video 
and answer at least one qualitative response to a question. This meant 
that suspects had to watch at least five seconds of the explainer video, 
which in turn meant that they were exposed to the value proposition. 
Jared didn’t want a suspect’s email address unless the suspect got the 
gist of TradeYa’s value proposition.
FIGURE 9-21
TradeYa landing page to enter giveaway contest
Jared spent $2,000 running the campaign, which went out to mil-
lions of users. Of those, 6,700 people clicked the Facebook advertise-
ment, which directed them to the landing page. Of those, 5,000 peo-
ple entered the contest, which meant 5,000 people were exposed to the 
value proposition, turning them from suspects to leads. This meant he 
had 74% conversion. In terms of cost for conversion, Jared paid 33 cents 
for the click, and 41 cents for the email address.
Some people might still say, “So what? The guy has a bunch of emails 
of people who just want free headphones.” Well, Jared has the metrics 
to answer that, thanks to his very carefully thought out Landing Page 
experiment. More than 5 percent of the people who entered the contest 

 9. Designing for Conversion   |  233
started sharing TradeYa on their social networks. That made them ref-
erences—they were evangelizing the value proposition to other poten-
tial suspects. When our MVP launched, Jared had 5,000 people to 
directly send email to, induce them to activate their accounts and be 
ready to engage in trading on the site. Presented in those terms, I’d 
call the conversion achieved by his Landing Page experiment a success.
How to concoct a Landing Page experiment
If you decide to use a Landing Page experiment for your value prop-
osition, you’re in luck; there are many WSYWIG tools for landing 
page testing available. They vary from simple and free to robust and 
expensive. 
What is important when choosing a tool is that you pick one that allows 
you to easily:
•	 Add plug-and-play widgets and form modules as needed
•	 Assign your own domain name
•	 Track the conversion of your pages
To create your Landing Page experiment, you can follow this sim-
ple framework, which is basically how we ran the case studies I just 
described:
1.	 Define the experiment and determine what part of the customer 
experience is being tested and how it corresponds to the value 
proposition.
You are testing your value proposition, a pivot, or trying to acquire 
users. As you read in the case studies earlier, it’s really import-
ant that you try to figure out how to correspond the quantifiable 
results you get from your landing page to the questions for which 
you need answers.
2.	 Design/build your landing page.
The primary function of a landing page is to convert the suspects 
who have landed there deeper into your experience/product by 
exposing them to your value proposition. This conversion must 
happen as fast as a 30-second commercial. You need to convey to 
potential customers what your product does, using whatever media 
does the trick. This is when you want to bring the content or brand 
strategists into the conversation if they are available, because you 

234  |   UX STRATEGY
need to distill your product into something digestible by using 
text, photos, and video. In Chapter 3, I discuss the “pitch” aspect 
of the value proposition. That’s the thing the landing page needs to 
communicate.
You might also need to think through the experience after the user 
submits the form. Ideally, it will just be a Thank You page that 
explains the next steps. In the case of the software engineer’s prod-
uct, we also included a phone number in case users were nervous 
and wanted to talk to us, as shown in Figure 9-22.
FIGURE 9-22
The Thank You page
3.	Design/build the secondary pages.
You’ll want to run variants of your landing pages to test different 
value props, features, copy, and UI design patterns.
4.	 Run a “controlled” online campaign for a set amount of time.
Typically, ad campaigns run less than a week. But it all depends on 
your budget.
5.	Measure the metrics for validate learnings.
Everything comes back to your funnel. If you aren’t collecting or 
looking at the numbers that matter, you can’t make the decisions 
that will make your product the disruptive invention you’ve always 
dreamed it could be.

Recap
In this chapter, I showed you how a successful UX strategy uses analyt-
ics to optimize the UX design, demonstrated the use of a tool called the 
Funnel Matrix and its different stages of customer acquisition, and dis-
cussed how metrics prove that the customer is progressing into deeper 
engagement. You also learned how to design for conversion with land-
ing pages and bring together a cross-functional team including design-
ers, developers, product managers, and, most important, marketers.
This concludes all the techniques I will be sharing for conducting UX 
strategy. Now it’s time to hear from other strategists to see what their 
perspectives are.

—THE FALL (1979)
Until recently, there have been few opportunities for people 
who practice some flavor of UX strategy to huddle together and com-
pare notes. For this reason, I decided to hunt down some of these strat-
egists in the wild to interview for this book. They range from business 
strategists to design executives and have worked on everything from 
shoestring to big-budget projects. My goal was for them to share their 
perspectives and techniques even if their strategic practices were dif-
ferent from my own. They were all asked the same 10 questions. Here 
is what they had to say.

 10. Strategists in the Wild   |  239
1. How did you become a strategist and/or get into doing strategy  
as part of your work?
Well, I started out in television, working on the production side, and I 
think it was around the mid-’90s when I began hearing conversations 
about email and “the Web” but it wasn’t until I saw a web address on 
an ad in the London Underground that I thought things were really 
beginning to shift. I wanted to understand these new digital channels 
better so I made the jump to digital or “multimedia” as it was called 
back then.
I worked with a big creative agency in London and experienced a great 
variety of projects, technologies, and clients. It felt great to be at the 
beginning of something. Then, with the rise of interactive television, 
I saw an opportunity combine my television experience with my dig-
ital experience. Broadcasters were looking for ways to further engage 
and entertain audiences amidst increasing competition. Many interac-
tive services were conceived after the show had been produced and felt 
very much like add-ons or an afterthought. We realized that we had to 
think more strategically about the integration of interactivity and tele-
vision programming, not just in relation to a particular show but how it 
would complement a broadcaster’s business strategy. This meant step-
ping back and looking at the business and media strategies in the con-
text of the market and what these technological changes were enabling. 
We were looking for trends, gaps, and opportunities and then develop 
a digital roadmap accordingly. We looked beyond just who the audience 
was and asked what they wanted to do and what they needed and within 
the context of use.
I studied sociology, which, looking back, was invaluable in preparing 
me for what I do now. Sociology requires you look systematically at 
human society; to examine the relationships between the individual 
and society and to better understand people’s motives, occupations, tra-
ditions, and cultures. As it turns out, this is great training for a UX 
strategist.
I didn’t set out to be a strategist—certainly not a UX strategist. I do think 
that in order to be successful one needs a level of strategic thinking, a 
strategic framework. For me, this means seeking out fact-based infor-
mation, not relying on generalized theories, questioning assumptions. 

240  |   UX STRATEGY
It involves compromise, understanding our competencies, challenging 
our thinking. More important, perhaps, it means determining what 
the right questions to ask are.
2. What does UX strategy mean to you? Is it a bogus job title?
Oh, I do think there’s a difference between strategy and design. A strat-
egy sets out the plan and approach, and design is the tactical imple-
mentation of that strategy.
Honestly, I prefer the term experience strategy to user experience strategy. 
User experience strategy implies that it’s set apart from, say the busi-
ness strategy, or the marketing strategy, or even the product strategy. 
And it shouldn’t be. Developing a product or service strategy requires 
that you understand the various touch points within the business: who 
is involved and the associated tasks or activities. This means talking 
to business stakeholders, sales and marketing, engineering but also 
to those you wouldn’t necessarily expect, like the office manager, the 
mailroom guy, or sales assistant. Strategy comes from this collective 
vision of the business and its customers. Perhaps it’s a matter of seman-
tics, but when I hear people talking about a user experience strategy it’s 
often about the user experience vision, principles, and design objec-
tives for a particular product or service. This is certainly a part of an 
experience strategy but should not be limited to it.
So no, it’s not a bogus title. But I do think we need to stop umming 
and aahring about our titles and our places in business. UX isn’t an 
emerging discipline anymore: it has emerged. Business recognizes the 
importance of UX. If we are still struggling to define ourselves, per-
haps we not being strategic enough about demonstrating the value we 
bring to business.
So, as far as what I call myself…sometimes, I call myself an experience 
strategist and sometimes I call myself an interaction designer, because I 
am and do both of these things. 
3. How did you learn about business strategy?
I have no formal training. I learned the fundamentals of business strat-
egy on the job, over the years. I understood fairly quickly that to be suc-
cessful I had to have a really good grasp of an organization’s business 

 10. Strategists in the Wild   |  241
model and strategy, not just its customers or end users. I wasn’t simply 
the voice of the customer, although that was my role when I was start-
ing out.
For the longest time, UX was in its own department, usually off some-
where with visual design. Technology sat somewhere else, as did the 
business folks. There were few integrated teams, so we were design-
ing in a bubble. How can you possibly design a solution for a business 
if you have no understanding of what that business wants to achieve?
Not everything we do supports business priorities; we have to balance it 
with the needs and priorities of the customer or end user. Nonetheless, 
to support business priorities we need to understand them. Typically, 
they’re about increasing revenues, driving costs savings, and increas-
ing market share. If you’re not supporting those, you’re not designing 
the right solution.
I’ve worked with some outstanding business strategists from whom 
I’ve learned a great deal, and I’m very grateful for that.
4. Do you think it’s helpful for UX designers who are aspiring  
strategists to get an MBA or have a business degree?
I didn’t go to business school, so I’m not entirely sure. I do wonder, 
however, if the time and financial investment is really worth it.
Honestly, I’m not sure if business school would have the same impact 
on the careers of aspiring UX strategists as it would on the careers of 
management consultants or investment bankers. If you are doing it for 
the big paycheck, go into banking or finance. If you want to gain the 
specialized knowledge and skills required to be a UX strategist, you 
won’t find it in business school, you’ll find it in the workplace and work-
ing with other UX professionals.
There’s also a plethora of UX-centric resources out there: free online 
resources, books (like this one, for example), conferences, master 
classes, as well as university degrees, which certainly weren’t available 
when I started out.

5. What types of products have you done the strategy for that  
were the most exciting or fun to work on?
Being involved in the development of a truly innovative product or ser-
vice is certainly a lot of fun. But honestly, given the time, the budgets, 
or the aversion that many organizations have to risk-taking, it can be a 
challenge to create truly innovative products.
I was lucky enough to work with the Google Glass team helping to 
think about the customer experience strategy for part of the business, 
not that of the device itself. I enjoyed working with new or emerging 
technologies because they provide such great learning opportunities, 
and Glass was no exception.
Projects where I’ve developed a strategy that leads to the creation of 
value for both the client’s business and its customers are really reward-
ing. Or projects I’ve done that in some way had an impact on the indus-
try, like when I was working with the first interactive TV service pro-
vider in the UK.
Frankly, most of the time it’s the client and the people I work with that 
makes an engagement fun.
6. What are some of the challenges of conducting strategy in  
different work environments (for example, startups versus  
agencies versus enterprises)?
Much of what we do is about aligning people, processes, and expecta-
tions, and this is challenging. I’d say people management can be a chal-
lenge within some organizations. I spend a good deal of time think-
ing about whom I am talking to and shaping my conversations accord-
ingly—being aware of organizational politics. Organizational politics 
is another challenge. It influences what we do and how we do it, which 
could have an impact the quality of the work. I usually try to find out 
who the project decision makers are and what factors tend to influ-
ence them so I am better prepared. Adaptability is another key skill and 
being adept at building trust amongst those you work with.
Although exciting, startups pose their own set of challenges. There 
might not have been a UX designer or strategist in the organization 
before you, so a large part of what you do might be educating those 
around you on the value of user-centered design. Decisions about a 
product or service might already have been made before your arrival, 
which can make any change hard to negotiate, especially given that 

 10. Strategists in the Wild   |  243
business owners are often product owners and feel a very strong sense 
of ownership in the product. People often wear multiple hats in start-
ups, jumping in where needed which can cause some confusion regard-
ing your role. Clearly communicating what you do and the value you 
bring to a project or solution, as a UX strategist, is key.
Time can also be a challenge. Startups often move at breakneck speeds 
to get a product to market, so you can be pushed to deliver quicker than 
you’re comfortable. It’s important to step back, slow down for a bit, and 
review where you are. Is the product or service supporting business 
priorities? Is it supporting the needs of the end users? Are you able to 
explain what the product or service is, in a way that your grandmother 
would understand? 
7. Have you ever conducted any form of experiments on your product 
or UX strategy, whether it be trying to get market validation on a 
value proposition or testing prototypes on target customers? How 
do you get closer to the truth while you are conducting strategy?
Do we ever get closer to truth? What is the truth, Jaime?! To answer, 
yes I have conducted evaluations. The type of evaluation depends very 
much on the available budget, the available time, what is being evalu-
ated, what point in the process we’re at, and who the end users are.
I think it’s vitally important that we evaluate our work as UX strategists 
and designers. We’re tasked with crafting an experience that other peo-
ple will use. The amount of time and effort we put into this means 
objectivity might be a hard thing to maintain. We are often not the tar-
get audience either, so we’re not best placed to see the good, the bad, 
and the ugly. That’s why we need to put our work out there, at different 
stages of its development, for others to evaluate. And it’s not just end 
users you turn to for evaluation: it’s important that you regularly invite 
the business to evaluate your work because they ultimately own the 
experience.
I love user testing. I love sitting down with people and seeing how they 
react to something we’ve designed. No matter what stage of the process 
or what form the evaluation materials take. The outcome of these ses-
sions helps make me and design teams more effective. And it can be 
feedback that comes from sitting down with friends, to more a formal 
response from a group of users in a usability lab. I don’t think I’ve ever 
conducted any testing or any research where I haven’t been surprised 

244  |   UX STRATEGY
by something. No matter how good we are, we’re designing something 
for people, other people, so it’s inevitable that we’ll be surprised with 
how some people end up using the product... or not.
It’s important to spend time with people while they test something. 
This might be as close as we can get to “the truth.” For example, how 
do you know what people are looking at on a page before clicking, with-
out watching them? You won’t find out what they are thinking, without 
asking them, and you won’t know to ask them unless you’ve seen them 
pause.
8. What is your secret weapon or go-to technique for devising  
strategies or building consensus on a shared vision?
I would like to share what is called a user journey, or customer experience 
map (see Figure 10-2).
FIGURE 10-2
A customer experience map
An experience map is a strategic tool, rooted in user research, for cap-
turing the complete experience a person might have with a product 
or service. It documents the experience from the customer’s perspec-
tive. What they’re doing. How they are doing it. How they feel about it. 
I use experience maps to help me understand the end-to-end experi-
ence a customer has with a brand. It helps me to see where the brand 

 10. Strategists in the Wild   |  245
is creating value for the customer and where it is not. Ultimately, it’s 
a tool that helps determine the best strategy for delivering a seamless 
customer experience across multiple touch points.
I use customer experience maps to help focus a client on the customer. 
I bring stakeholders from across the business together and take them 
through the map. It’s a great tool for helping them understand the 
experience from the customer’s perspective and can be used to help 
build consensus on how to best serve customers at each touch point.
Depending on the nature of the engagement, I also might create a 
service map. It’s similar to a user experience map but from the busi-
ness’s perspective. It captures how the business services the customer 
at each touch point. I layer this over the customer experience map to 
help understand what the business is doing, as a way of contextualizing 
the customer experience.
Each map tends to be a little different because they’re based on research, 
the results of which can vary significantly from one project to another. 
Maps are similar in that they’re visual representations of the user jour-
ney and tend to have similar phases within them. They often don’t rep-
resent a linear process, because customers tend to move back and forth 
through phases interacting with some touch points and not others.
The experience map in Figure 10-2 was part of an engagement with 
a retail client looking to refresh its brand and improve its overall cus-
tomer experience, across its digital channels.
As you move from left to right across the map, you can see the six 
phases of the customer journey. These are the behavioral stages cus-
tomers experience when discovering and interacting with a brand’s 
product. There is often continuity across experience maps with regard 
to these phases, but as I start amassing data about the purchase jour-
ney, I often refine or add to these.
For each phase, I ask customers what their goals are; what were their 
motivations. And then I try to discover the trigger or moment that 
moves them to the next phase. I jot down questions they ask them-
selves as they describe the journey, which helps me identify whether 
a brand is answering those effectively, or at all. I ask customers to 
describe their activities, interactions, and how long they take. I also ask 
them to rank their satisfaction of each activity on a scale of one to five, 
one being negative. Obviously, measuring customer experiences isn’t 

246  |   UX STRATEGY
an exact science, because we’re trying to quantify a feeling, but it’s use-
ful nonetheless. I often collect quotes from customers to accompany 
the rankings to help clients understand why customers ranked some-
thing in such a way.
There’s no right way to design an experience map. As I’ve mentioned, 
it depends on the nature of the engagement. I don’t treat it as a deliver-
able as such; rather, it’s a tool to move forward, leading to the develop-
ment of strategy or design.
 9. What is a business case or anecdotal story that you can share 
that walk us through the steps you have to go through when 
conducting strategy specifically for an innovative product?
I think it’s really hard to innovate and it’s something many clients 
want to do. It’s hard because it can require organizational or proce-
dural change. Intellectually, clients understand this needs to happen, 
but emotionally it’s hard to commit to.
But it’s not Google Glass all the time. Innovation can happen in small, 
incremental steps. You can innovate around a feature or an interface or 
in phases, and ultimately it builds up to this really extraordinary, mean-
ingful, hard-to-replicate experience.
I’m not sure that the steps I’ve gone through—when working on what 
were considered innovative products or services—have been wildly dif-
ferent from those on other products or services.
My process follows a similar pattern. I ask a series of questions.
I look at the business. Figure out what problem we’re trying to solve 
Determine the business objectives. Determine the measurements of 
success. Look at where the business is now and where it wants to be.
I determine who the intended users are. Without doing this, we’ll be 
designing for ourselves.

 10. Strategists in the Wild   |  247
I look at the target market for the product. Who is or might be the com-
petition? Is there a similar product on the market? What are the gaps 
and opportunities? What are the industry trends?
I look at the business capabilities and core competencies. Can the busi-
ness achieve and maintain a competitive advantage based on its current 
capabilities and competencies? Do we have the capababilities to support 
the product now and in the future?
I often go back and refine what I’ve found with each new interview and 
with answers to the questions gathered, I review, analyze, and strate-
gize. Gaps and opportunities will become apparent, creative solutions 
can be devised. Then, in collaboration with business stakeholders, pri-
orities can be applied and an action plan developed.
10. What are important skills or mindsets for a strategist to have?  
Or what makes you good at your job?
You need a healthy dose of emotional intelligence. Nurturing relation-
ships, building trust, and the ability to inspire people are what UX 
strategists do on a daily basis.
Be a critical thinker. Ask “why” questions and if you don’t get answers, 
reframe, and ask again. Don’t rely on the thinking of others and don’t 
assume. Challenge the existing opinions and beliefs of those around 
you…and your own.
Base your point of view on facts you’ve gathered from multiple sources. 
Evaluate and reevaluate to make sure your approach, decision, or design 
is still relevant.
Listen to those you don’t agree with. Are they making sense? Have you 
overlooked something? Seek opinions from people with different areas 
of expertise to gain different perspectives.
Own your decisions. Be prepared to be wrong. Be prepared to 
compromise.

1. How did you become a strategist and/or get into doing strategy  
as part of your work? 
I taught myself multimedia design in the ’90s. My first formal role in 
software design was as a web developer, and then I transitioned from 
a web developer to being an interaction designer, and then from an 
interaction designer to a UX designer. Along the way, I realized that I 
needed answers to strategic questions, and that I needed to augment 
my “UX toolkit” to allow for more strategic thinking.
I truly became a “strategist” sometime around 2001 when I was at 
Adaptive Path. Adaptive Path was a very straightforward, very user-ex-
perience, design-oriented company. We were doing interaction design, 
information architecture, user research, and usability testing. However, 
to do the best design work that we could for our clients, we did more: we 
would ask them questions, so we understood the context in which the 
design work took place. We didn’t want to make a design for the sake 
of designing. We wanted to make the design deliver on some common 
interest, goal, or objective. And what we found was often our clients 
didn’t know the answers to our questions. They had never bothered to 
ask the questions themselves, and they didn’t understand how import-
ant those answers were to the shared design vision. So, we found our-
selves moving upstream, doing what is essentially strategy work, to 
answer those questions. That’s how I became a strategist; to simply 
find the answers to the questions that I needed in order to do the best 
design work.
2. What does UX strategy mean to you? Is it a bogus job title?
You know, it’s funny. I just wrote a blog post about how there’s no such 
thing as UX design. And my point in that post was the design part of 
what we call UX design is typically just interaction design or information 
architecture. And the rest of what we call UX design is really just strat-
egy and product management. However, at Adaptive Path, we talked 
a lot about defining what experience strategy and/or UX strategy was, 
so I think there’s validity to this concept. There is such a thing as UX 
strategy because product strategy and business strategy have failed in 
the prior decades to account for the user needs and awareness. To make 
sure that the user and the user experience was appropriately beneficial, 
we had to develop this thing called UX strategy.

250  |   UX STRATEGY
In an ideal world you wouldn’t need UX strategy, because it would just 
be a component of your product or business strategy. We’re moving 
into this ideal world, I think. We’re seeing more and more often that 
UX is considered a part of a broader strategy. But, I think the separate 
and distinct concept of UX strategy was necessary for us—at least so 
we could focus on it—to shine a light on it and develop a toolkit to then 
wrap up in product strategy.
So, “UX strategy” is not bogus or overblown, but I do think that it’s a 
temporary artifact or a moment in time that we are in. If I think what 
UX strategy means to me, it is addressing those questions you need 
to answer and the answers to those questions that help inform your 
design. It’s not sufficient to simply have a business strategy or product 
strategy in the classical way of understanding your audience or total 
addressable market. You need to have a deeper understanding of your 
users, audiences, customers—whatever you want to call them—who 
they are, what they want, how they behave, and what they’re looking 
for. Traditional strategy methods, even if they talked about customers, 
didn’t really embrace deep customer understanding and empathy. So 
I think, what UX strategy does is it goes deeper into customer under-
standing. Again, what we’re seeing develop is a business strategy that 
is starting to appreciate that more directly.
3. How did you learn about business strategy?
I had no formal training or business strategy education. But something 
happened while I was at Adaptive Path. I was trying to understand how 
to do better UX design just after the dot-com bust happened. It was 
2002 and there was a lot of soul searching going on in the UX commu-
nity about proving our value. A common theme that we felt we needed 
to prove was the Return On Investment (ROI) of user experience. One 
of the opportunities we had at Adaptive Path was to explore these types 
of questions. I started digging into MBA-ish literature and then we got 
into contact with a professor at Berkeley’s Haas School of Business, 
Sara L. Beckman (PhD, Industrial Engineering and Engineering 
Management, Stanford University).
She was one of first people who were trying to understand that design 
provides an interesting categorical advantage within business. One of 
her MBA students, Scott Hirsch, partnered with Adaptive Path to write 
a business paper on business value and how ROI drives user experi-
ence. With their advisement, we attempted to apply some real business 

 10. Strategists in the Wild   |  251
thinking to our UX process. And so it was through these kinds of expo-
sures that I was able to learn about business strategy and the kinds of 
things businesses tend to care about.
Honestly, business strategy is pretty straightforward: money in, money 
out. How do you reduce costs? How do you increase profits? At the heart 
of all businesses, that’s what it’s all about. If you can talk to a CEO or 
C-level people about how they can reduce or manage costs and increase 
revenues, or if they’re going to increase costs, increase revenue, what-
ever it is, that’s still business strategy. Tah dah! It’s not a black art.
One of the ways that I’ve been most informed about business strategy 
happened in 2005 when Adaptive Path hired Brandon Schauer, who 
has a master’s in Design and an MBA. Brandon ended up running 
Adaptive Path before it was acquired by Cap One. By working with him 
and being exposed to his methods, I was better able to understand the 
opportunity that design and UX has within a business context. In the 
’80s and ’90s, we had already squeezed as much efficiency out of every 
value chain we could find. It was a lot about just-in-time manufactur-
ing, process engineering; just squeezing, squeezing, squeezing, until 
the point of diminishing returns, and continuing to do that work. And 
so the opportunity was, well, how do we realize whole new value prop-
ositions. And that’s where good design comes in to point the way to 
whole new opportunities or differentiation within a space.
4. Do you think it’s helpful for UX designers who are aspiring  
strategists to get an MBA or have a business degree?
It’s not hurtful. Maybe it is moderately helpful. I’ve seen people who’ve 
gone through that experience and it’s been beneficial for them. But, 
you can also earn while you learn and come out in a very similar place. 
An MBA or business degree could be good for folks who are really tran-
sitioning from a craft form of a UX practice into something more stra-
tegic and need help making that shift. I feel like if you’re already doing 
it, even if it’s self-taught, an MBA isn’t going to get you much more. 
It could be useful depending on the school for making connections 
and meeting new people. Having a Harvard MBA or Stanford GSB cer-
tainly is not going to look bad on your resume. But that type of educa-
tion is going to be a big financial investment too.

252  |   UX STRATEGY
5. What types of products have you done the strategy for that  
were most exciting or fun to work on?
A transformative experience for me was working with Brandon Schauer 
at Adaptive Path on a project for a financial services client (not Capital 
One). It was in 2005, just when he joined our company. This project 
was meant to be a simple website redesign. But because we had a really 
savvy client, we were also able to do some strategic work, financial anal-
ysis, and modeling. This strategic work gave us a deeper understand-
ing of the user research so that we could tie all these things together to 
help inform a potential strategic overhaul of the client’s entire service 
offering. However, as it turned out, they were not able to realize our 
vision because their organization was not set up to take on such a big 
shift.
What I learned on that project and some subsequent projects is that 
even if we delivered an amazing strategy to an organization, if the cor-
poration is not shaped and its cultural values are not set to embrace that 
strategy, the strategy is meaningless.
The most fun strategy projects that I’ve worked on were vision projects. 
We did two for companies in South Korea, one that was the future of 
media, and one that was the future of commerce. These vision proj-
ects are awesome and they’re fun, especially when you’re working as 
a designer in a design firm. For one project we did a ton of trend anal-
ysis, trying to understand where these technologies were going, user 
behavior, and how that was evolving. That involved a lot of secondary 
research, which I’d say is not a typical method or UX practice. We read 
blogs, articles, and academic papers. We really just tried to soak in the 
space. We interviewed experts in media, we interviewed people who 
worked at YouTube, people who worked at product companies, people 
who worked in academia, looking at this stuff, trying to figure out—
you know, where the future was going.
In digging through the trend research, we identified specific concepts, 
which we placed on blue stickies (see Figure 10-4). Then, we grouped 
those concepts around themes, which were yellow stickies. And we 
used red whiteboard marker to provide context and narrative for the 
concepts and themes. When we felt good about the map for a year, we 
took a picture of the whiteboard. Then, we erased all the marker lines 
and moved the stickies around (and added and removed stickies) to tell 
a story for the next year, and when we felt good about that, took that 

 10. Strategists in the Wild   |  253
picture. So, the photos of the whiteboard became a time series of our 
trend forecasting, and fed into the Trend Map poster that we created 
(see Figure 10-5).
FIGURE 10-4
Trend analysis working session output
FIGURE 10-5
Trend forecasting slide

254  |   UX STRATEGY
When those understandings paired with our design creativity and fore-
cast of media experience in the midterm (three to five years), it was 
super fun. I learned a ton from that project and opportunity.
That’s a lot of the challenges for a lot of UX strategy work, particu-
larly agency-based, where the impact of the UX strategy work is often 
unclear. I’ve not seen a lot of real organizational evolution. Since I’ve 
left the consulting world, one of the things that have been intriguing 
to me is how little interest Silicon Valley has in the word “strategy.” It’s 
almost like it’s a bad word, because I think it’s believed to mean a lot of 
chin stroking and not a lot of shipping, and there’s some truth to that.
The Lean Startup movement was responding to the same Silicon Valley 
mindset that is also kind of minimizing the value of strategy. The com-
panies that practice strategy very seriously, such as Intuit, I don’t know 
what they have to show for it. So I’m kind of sympathetic to it. I think 
that there’s a role for strategy to play and explicit strategic efforts to 
play, in-house and within these tech companies, but there’s a strug-
gle to find a right amount of strategy. You don’t want to feel as if it’s 
overwhelming, or it’s a waste of time and energy, or it’s too grand for 
us to realize, or that it’s just “Why did we bother?” Hitting that happy 
medium is an interesting challenge.
6. What are some challenges of conducting strategy in  
different work environments (for example, startups versus  
agencies versus enterprises)?
Within an agency context, it depends on the agency. At Adaptive Path, 
if you came to us, you were going to be embracing strategy. We weren’t 
the type of design agency that if we were to begin talking strategic con-
cerns to you, you wouldn’t be, “Wait, what? No just push some pixels, 
will ya?!”
Some agencies have those challenges of moving upstream. But, I think 
for an agency, you have to set yourself up as a strategic provider, and 
if you attract clients, you’re doing strategy work. That’s relatively easy. 
Within that agency environment, and because of the way the projects 
tend to be structured, you can kind of create the safe space for strategy 
to be done. Now, the challenge for an agency, which I was referring 
to before, is that strategy can often feel irrelevant, by the time you go 
deliver it, or months later when you follow up on it, you’re like, “So what 
are you doing?” “Oh well, we had a reorg or this person left, or that 

 10. Strategists in the Wild   |  255
person left, or what it is. We shifted this, that, and the other thing.” So 
the work you did just kind of doesn’t get used. So that’s the challenge 
for an agency.
The challenges for doing it in-house, at an enterprise, are for strategy 
to remain relevant. One method is to connect the strategic work to the 
production work, because those two functions tend to be owned by two 
different parts of an organization. So, the challenge is how do you make 
sure that your strategy feels actionable and operable so that your teams 
can draw and act on it. I think in an enterprise, you might get a lot of 
rich, deep, thoughtful strategy, but you might find that the market has 
changed by the time you’ve come up with all your strategic insight.
In the startup environment, the primary challenge for strategy is that 
there’s often no time to do it. To do strategy of any significant complex-
ity correctly, it takes time, effort, and energy. In a startup you often don’t 
have that available excess time because you’re still trying to prove your-
self, and just get a toehold. The strategic orientation within a startup 
has to come from the founders, as opposed to it being an explicitly 
separate activity that a UX strategist is conducting on his own. Having 
a UX Strategy and making sure you’re thinking properly about your 
UX as part of the broader product strategy is important. The compa-
nies that succeed are the ones that understand this, even if they haven’t 
practiced it explicitly.
The primary challenge is to embrace a meaningful and appropriate UX 
strategy, regardless of environment. The secondary challenge is mak-
ing sure that strategic effort is operating at the appropriate cadence that 
your environment requires.
I’m now at a product company, Jawbone, which makes hardware. We 
can actually be more explicitly strategic than I’ve been able to be else-
where. This is because for us to do a hardware product, it’s a huge 
investment. To mitigate the risk of that investment, we have to be stra-
tegic or we are going to be flushing a lot of money down the toilet. 
And so we have some room to be more thoughtful and mindful of our 
strategy.

256  |   UX STRATEGY
7. Have you ever conducted any form of experiments on your product 
or UX strategy, whether it be trying to get market validation on a 
value proposition or testing prototypes on target customers? How 
do you get closer to the truth while you are conducting strategy?
The short answer to that question is “not really.” I see us doing that 
more here [at Jawbone] because of the risk, the up-front capital that it 
takes to launch hardware, you need to make sure you feel pretty good 
about it. So, because I’m new to this company, I need to validate earlier 
strategies before implementing them.
8. What is your secret weapon or go-to technique for devising  
strategies or building consensus on a shared vision?
Doing the right research, talking to the right kinds of folks, asking 
them the right kinds of questions, and observing the right kinds of 
behavior that can be analyzed and appropriately inform strategy and 
delivery. It’s hardly a secret weapon; a lot of people do it. Are you iden-
tifying your prospective audience appropriately so that your research 
participants are the kind of people who are going to engage once you 
have a product in the market? Are you asking the right questions? 
Observing the right behaviors? Probing them appropriately? You’re not 
just asking dumb questions. You’re allowing them to be who they are, 
but also recognizing you can’t do a purely anthropological study that 
can take months. So, to the degree that you’re forcing things, you’re 
forcing things appropriately, you’re getting the right stuff out of it. Are 
you then analyzing the results in meaningful ways so that you can 
develop appropriate insights?
I’m a fan of personas as developed by Alan Cooper (see Chapter 3). I 
don’t use them all the time, but when I do I like to study a full spec-
trum of user behavior. When I have the opportunity to look at the data 
from numerous user research interviews, I can identify the salient 
behaviors that stand out.
9. What is a business case or anecdotal story that you can share 
that walk us through the steps you have to go through when 
conducting strategy specifically for an innovative product?
For my last Adaptive Path project, we worked for a big global media 
brand client. We worked on its ecommerce platform—its online store. 
So, the strategy process began with research. This was a children’s 
media brand, so the research involved mainly moms. We did a lot of 

 10. Strategists in the Wild   |  257
in-home interviews, talked to moms about buying stuff for their chil-
dren, and focused mostly on gifting because of the nature of this brand. 
It wasn’t bought everyday. It was bought for special occasions. So we 
took that research and analyzed it.
We didn’t create personas for this project; we created profiles, very sim-
ilar to personas but different. A persona is a face with a name you give 
it, and it’s meant to be a specific individual. Profiles are more categor-
ical. We broke up these moms into four or five profile types. We had 
the mom who’s still a kid at heart and loves the stuff herself as much 
as the kids love it; we had the mom who’s more of the “I want to be an 
educator. I’m buying this stuff so I can create this world that my child 
can then succeed in”; then there was the mom that might be the kind of 
working mom who feels guilty working, so they’re spoiling these kids 
because they want to connect with them. So you come up with these 
profiles. From these profiles, we then told a series of stories and scenar-
ios. The way we structured these scenarios was to focus on different 
technological platforms.
We had one mom that was all web, one mom who was all mobile smart-
phone, one mom who was all tablet, and then we actually used a grand-
mother who was kind of a spoiler; well, actually more of an indulger, 
who crossed all these streams. And we wrote scenarios of use. The 
grandmother one was actually, for the sake of this story, the one who 
ended up being the most interesting. We did talk to a couple of these 
grandma types. The grandma often doesn’t live near the grandchil-
dren. Their children have moved away and have a family in another 
city, away from the grandparent. So, as we were writing this scenario, 
we have the grandparent in one city, the grandchildren in another city, 
and that was really interesting.
Okay, what can we do about that? Well, we write this story that’s around 
Christmas. The grandparent wants to get the grandchild something 
for Christmas. The grandparent can’t be there when the grandchild 
opens the present. So as we’re writing this story, what we realize is, 
well, what if you open this present, here’s a short form URL you can 
easily type into a web browser and you can get a video message from 
your grandma. There she is, Christmas morning, even though she 
can’t really be there. And so, that all came out of a strategic endeavor, 
research analysis, scenario development, essentially product design 
and development, leading to this particular feature that the client 

258  |   UX STRATEGY
loved. They fell all over themselves and built the technology to realize 
it because they thought it was so appropriate for them. The client has a 
very clear brand, a brand personality, and this hit right at the heart of 
who the client is as a business brand. So that’s a story of from research 
to delivered feature where I feel that we had quite a bit of success. 
You really want an understanding of what’s going on in the broader 
market. Now, that said, I think too often organizations look at what oth-
ers are doing and feel they have to match that. But you don’t want to get 
caught in competition. Be at par. Parity is a red-ocean strategy; you’re 
just trying to line yourself up with everyone else there. You want to find 
that blue ocean. Now, I would argue that you wouldn’t want to find that 
blue ocean for the sake of finding the blue ocean. That is still being too 
cognizant of what your competition is doing. What you need to do is 
understand who you are as an organization, who you are as a business, 
and who you are as the people within that business so that you can see 
through to delivery.
I can see another company doing the same strategy that would per-
fectly fit its brand. But I don’t know if it’s what we should be doing, 
because it doesn’t seem to fit who we are. So, again, this is where I 
feel UX doesn’t really often embrace enough brand strategy. I think 
that there’s a reasonable antipathy to brand and branding within UX 
because I feel often branding is handled poorly. It’s very superficial. 
But, if you dig, you can appropriate brand strategy, issues of personal-
ity, issues of values that the company holds, issues of those characteris-
tics that companies hold dear, and those elements of brand. UX needs 
to be very informed by that because releasing a product is hard. And 
if the people within the organization aren’t interested by the product 

 10. Strategists in the Wild   |  259
they’re building, aren’t passionate about the product that they’re build-
ing, they’re only building something because they think that there’s a 
market for it, they’re not really going to dig in and do all the hard work 
needed to get that product to market as best as they could. It’s got to be 
a product the people that work there want to feel like they would use.
10. What are important skills or mindsets for a strategist to have?  
Or what makes you good at your job?
It is about a kind of mindset that you should possess where you can 
understand the parts and see how these parts fit within the whole. I 
became a strategist because I can’t help but think about design in a sys-
tems context, a design within a broader context. I have a systems mind-
set whenever I approach anything. And it was in order to satisfy my 
systems mindset that I realized I needed to embrace strategy, because 
I needed to understand how the context of the work that I was doing fit 
within this broader system. 
A strategist also needs to be able to be persuasive, so you need to have 
good story-telling, communication, and presentation skills. You need to 
be able to bring people along in a story of engagement. Strategy tends 
to be abstract, so you need to be able to make that concrete so that other 
people can have a visceral response to it. Strategies that remain abstract 
tend not to take root, so another skill for a strategist is the ability to tell 
the story. To shape a narrative; to connect with an audience.

1. How did you become a strategist and/or get into doing strategy  
as part of your work?
I had a startup right after business school where I had to do basically 
everything and wear many hats. We built a product from the ground 
up, so it became clear to me very early on that without a proper vision 
and a strategy to get there, we would be going around in circles. So I 
really learned about strategy on the job.
The startup was an online music distribution platform for unsigned 
musicians. It happened just as the music business started to unravel 
and everyone wanted to challenge the ways that the record labels did 
business. The strategy focused on understanding our audience (musi-
cians) and their unmet needs online in the context of what was possible 
to do with the technology at the moment. We had to think about ways 
we could facilitate the digital tools for this new era so that these musi-
cians could have more control over their art and the product they were 
making. But at the same time, we had to do that in a way that the busi-
ness could make money. Strategy is not just about the product vision. 
It’s also the practical roadmap to get there; you have to think about both 
the end user and the supporting and sustainable business model.
When I started out, I wasn’t initially very good at balancing all the 
pieces. I didn’t understand how all the parts, business, design, and 
technology, came together so my planning and decision-making had 
holes in it. But I learned from my mistakes and was eager to try that 
role again in a more structured environment with better resources. So 
as I was exploring what to do next after the startup, I specifically sought 
out a position involving strategy in an interactive firm because I wanted 
to solve problems and build real products but in a creative environment.
2. What does UX strategy mean to you? Is it a bogus job title?
No, absolutely not. Over the years in both agencies and startups, I 
worked with many different types of UX strategists. There are some 
who think more like designers, and others who are focused on the busi-
ness side of things. I consider myself more of a business strategist, and 
I really work the best with a solid UX strategist or very experienced 
designer. We need to work together to realize what the product does for 
the user and how do we make a business out of it. I tend to have some 
very basic ideas about how the product functions and the overall inter-
action experience, but I can never really think everything through at 
that granular level the way UX strategists and designers do it. So for 

262  |   UX STRATEGY
me now, as a business owner and business strategist, the UX strategy 
is the core of everything we do, because in our case, the service is the 
product. It’s not like we are just a touch point for the customers along 
their experience with our business. Our product is the digital product. 
It is the service. It is the business. So we have to get it right, and it has to 
be delightful, and people will have to want to use it, and not just need 
to use it.
3. How did you learn about business strategy?
I learned most of what I know about business strategy in the first seven 
years after school just by constantly putting myself in the environment 
where I actually didn’t know anything about anything and had to learn 
about it. I had some academic credentials to get into it, but it didn’t 
mean that I really knew how to do it in a creative agency environment. 
I had gone to business school and took a lot of challenging courses at 
a good university, so on paper I seemed qualified for a strategy posi-
tion. But to be honest, when I first walked into a professional environ-
ment, I didn’t really even know how to do the competitive analysis prop-
erly at the level required in product thinking. My training was more in 
finance.
When you are fresh out of business school, you want to do things in a 
very business school-y, academic kind of way. Basically, I had to learn 
from scratch. It was probably by the time I had done my twentieth busi-
ness analysis/strategy presentation that I felt like I finally got it. It took 
some time before I truly understood how to put together a good story 
that was going to inform both the business goals and the design. But 
what I learned was not how to think analytically. That I already had. I 
learned how to tell a story. In a creative business, business strategy has 
to add up to a simple story about the product opportunity.
4. Do you think it’s helpful for UX designers who are aspiring  
strategists to get an MBA or have a business degree?
No, absolutely not. I think what is required is that they spend time with 
their colleagues in generative meetings. They really need to learn how 
to talk to clients and sincerely listen to their business problems. Being 
a good listener is absolutely essential. So, a degree in psychology might 
be more helpful than an MBA. I do think it is helpful to take a couple 
of business classes to learn and practice systems thinking and a frame-
work approach to problem solving. Strategy is mainly about simplifying 

 10. Strategists in the Wild   |  263
the chaotic and the complex into a simple diagram or a statement that 
everyone on your team can understand and get behind. Some people 
are naturally better at that kind of thinking and others are better at cre-
ative thinking. I find it’s very rare to find people who are super creative 
and analytical at the same time. Those people are very unique.
In my experience, business school is only a requirement if you want to 
get a really big corporate job. Having an MBA at a Fortune 500 com-
pany might be environmental requirement, but I don’t think it’s nec-
essary for the creative world. I learned a lot by looking at the decks of 
strategists whom I respected and saw how they told the “business sto-
ries.” As I mentioned before, that type of storytelling is not something 
you would perfect in school.
5. What types of products have you done the strategy for that  
were the most exciting or fun to work on?
What I’m working on right now is probably the most engaging for me. 
But again, that’s because I’m the product owner who has a lot at stake. 
I think you have to have a different level of commitment not just when 
your name is on the line, but also all your finances and everything else. 
Perhaps that risk factor is what makes it very engaging.
In the agency world, you often do the strategy and sometimes you see 
through design, and in rare cases, you see it all the way through the 
build, but almost never do you then interact with the clients day-to-day 
to see how it really affects their businesses. With working in client ser-
vices, sometimes you get feedback after delivery and you do postmor-
tems. But it’s after your work has been delivered to your clients and the 
project is over. When the strategy is out of your hands, then it really 
becomes their baby. And the outcomes depend on what they do with it 
and how they market the product. And by that point, it’s really hard to 
isolate what worked or did not work. Was it the strategy or the design 
or the technology or the marketing? If the strategist is not involved 
throughout the process, she can’t really be held accountable. For me, 
that’s a bad thing because being able to be involved in the final out-
comes is what motivates me.
So, right now I am building a product that we just put out on the mar-
ket and I could immediately see how people reacted and how they use 
it. We spent nine months making assumptions and building a product 
based on our best thinking, and then, in a matter of days, we finally get 

264  |   UX STRATEGY
some real feedback from real users. That is very satisfying, even if the 
feedback is not always positive. And believe me, it is not always posi-
tive. Through this direct learning, I get to iterate on the original idea 
with real people. The complete feedback loop is what makes it the most 
interesting product.
6. What are the some challenges of conducting strategy in  
different work environments (for example, startups versus  
agencies versus enterprises)?
Politics are always tough, and politics always come with the territory 
of any business that has more than three people. So with all kinds of 
enterprises and large clients, politics play a big role. You often deal 
with the budget that comes from a marketing department, and they 
have their own agenda. Often you are really building a product that’s 
informed by the business/product group, but then the business group 
is not actually involved in the strategy conversations. In that case, the 
challenge is to navigate all of that to make everybody play together.
A startup can have its own issues. It can be a little lonely. If you start 
small, there are only a handful of people you see and work with, 24/7. 
It can become too focused and sometimes you just wish, “Oh maybe 
we are tired and just need a fresh opinion.” Ultimately, until you start 
making a profit or get funded, the resources are always constrained. 
You don’t have people focusing on what they are best at, only. We all 
wear many hats.
I think that’s why agencies have the best balance. If you’re in the right 
group of people where you have the diverse and qualified team, you 
have feedback from the UX strategist, the business analyst, and all the 
different types of people that make your team well-rounded. When 
there is proper time to think and enough different perspectives, it fos-
ters an environment where you are able to have enough points of view 
to really bring out great ideas.
7. Have you ever conducted any form of experiments on your product 
or UX strategy, whether it be trying to get market validation on a 
value proposition or testing prototypes on target customers? How 
do you get closer to the truth while you are conducting strategy?
The best example I can talk about is what I’m working on now, which 
is a mobile productivity app. I’ve done a number of tests with focus 
groups at different stages of development, from ideation, to prototypes, 

 10. Strategists in the Wild   |  265
to the final product. We had an initial group of 20 people, a mix of 
potential users defined by background, needs, and behavior, that we 
showed our paper prototypes to first. This was helpful because in the 
conversations with potential users we got a chance to polish our own 
ideas to see if people are translating what we’ve created to what we 
intended to create. Do they get the overall concept?
The second level of testing was done with a couple of different clickable 
prototypes. We had a diverse group of people play with the apps and 
talk to us about what they liked and didn’t like, both about the concept 
and the execution.
The real test came when we actually launched the app and did a little 
marketing. Then, we had a much larger sample of 1,500 people using 
the app for a number of weeks. We did a survey online to understand 
why the users who were deeply engaged with the product love it and 
why others don’t. During this testing period, we continued to learn 
about what features they felt are missing and what users found confus-
ing. It was not full-blown user testing, but we were able to gain insights 
that were super enlightening.
However, you have to take a lot of the feedback with a grain of salt. 
Some people are just mean and will say, “This thing sucks. I don’t 
know why somebody would build something like this. Nobody wants 
to use this.” But then I had few dozen people say, “This has become my 
favorite app. I use it every day.” The feedback that mattered was from 
those people who took the time to explain to us exactly what features 
they liked or didn’t like and why.
Even when we just showed very high-level concepts of the product, we 
saw that a lot of people were getting what the product was and validat-
ing that they would use it the way we had intended. That was when 
it felt like the strategy was correct. This was crucial because we did 
a lot of research to understand the opportunity space and needed to 
know that people wanted to have this product. We had certain assump-
tions that the strategy was initially built on, but as we refined our ideas 
through the various levels of design and testing, our strategy became 
more and more clear. At the end, we could clearly articulate what the 
product that we had built is, who wants to use it, and why. And we had 
real data to back it up.

8. What is your secret weapon or go-to technique for devising  
strategies or building consensus on a shared vision?
I’m a very detail-oriented person. I have to understand the whole macro 
view of what else is happening in the market. So, researching the mar-
ketplace is always the first thing I do. I want to figure out who the user/
target customer is, what types of products that they are using to solve 
similar problems. I look at every angle of competition. Sometimes, 
it’s very predictable and sometimes it’s totally outside of the industry 
that you expect that you are competing in. I like to understand where 
they’re heading and how they created their UX. I want to understand 
their design strategy with the product and what it means for what we 
are trying to accomplish. Being able to share these details with my part-
ners and team helps everyone to be well informed and make better 
decisions together.
Something I almost always do in every project is a simple ecosystem 
map (see Figure 10-7) that shows who all the players are, what they have 
to offer, and why people like them (what features differentiate them). 
It’s a competitive map but in a framework that is relevant to the product 
I am working on.
FIGURE 10-7
Ecosystem map

 10. Strategists in the Wild   |  267
It’s a good reference tool for everyone on the team. I want everyone to 
know where we are on the map and where we are going.
9. What is a business case or anecdotal story that you can share 
that walk us through the steps you have to go through when 
conducting strategy specifically for an innovative product?
In an agency environment it starts with a brief. The client usually has 
the basic idea of the product or service it would like to create or at least 
the problem that it wants to solve. Often it might have an idea for the 
solution without completely understanding the true source of the prob-
lem, and it needs help with really clarifying both the problem space and 
the opportunity. So in the agency context, we begin by downloading 
the knowledge from the client, synthesizing what it knows and what 
the market tells us, and then coming up with a clear destination and a 
roadmap to get us there.
In the case of a tech startup, things are a little bit more fluid and iter-
ative. The approach is more or less the same, but less time and effort 
is spent on consensus building across the client’s organization. More 
time is spent on refining and optimizing. There are less artificial time 
constraints, but often more resource constraints, so we must be very 
lean in our thinking.
In my current startup, the vision is clear and set, but the strategy has 
evolved and continues to evolve. Our initial vision came from us observ-
ing a certain kind of behavior that people were exhibiting around the 
way they were using email where email wasn’t the most efficient solu-
tion. We thought something could be done about that. We didn’t imme-
diately know the perfect solution, but we had a very clearly articulated 
problem. We were not sure if the solution was a different kind of email 
app, or note-taking app, or even a task-management tool. So, step num-
ber one is to clearly identify (or make an educated hypothesis) about 
the opportunity space, or the problem that you are addressing for the 
end user. Based on this knowledge, we then form a strategy, a plan of 
action for the solution. In our case, we began to come up with a few 
different solutions that we believed were possible alternatives. But we 
didn’t know for sure until we really began designing, and prototyping. 
When we understand more or less what we wanted to design, we could 
do a more focused competitive analysis, looking at other similar prod-
ucts and talking to people who used those products. And based on that 
knowledge we tweaked our prototypes until we basically ended up with 

268  |   UX STRATEGY
one solid solution. The lesson is that strategy is iterative just like every-
thing else. You come up with a hypothesis, you create a plan, and you 
move forward until you learn new information, reposition the hypothe-
sis, and adjust the plan. Strategy is a living experience. 
10. What are important skills or mindsets for a strategist to have?  
Or what makes you good at your job?
What makes me good at my job is a combination of high-level think-
ing and focus on details and logistics simultaneously. You have to do a 
lot of “homework” before coming up with a strategy that might be not 
so exciting. But the way you put it all together into a story that’s both 
inspiring and practical is where the magic is. It’s not always that easy. 
You have to have the vision. You have to see the big picture and get 
excited about the possibilities. But you also have to be able to commu-
nicate that to other people so that they can get behind you.

1. How did you become a strategist and/or get into doing strategy  
as part of your work? 
So, I think the word “strategy” has very different meanings to different 
people, and you do a great job at boiling it down in the book. For me, 
helping people cut through the confusion, identify, and prioritize real 
opportunities is kind of what’s at the heart of the strategy work that I’ve 
done across a number of different consumer entertainment technology 
platforms. I’ve been lucky enough to be able to work on what you can 
call emerging platforms time and time again. There was a moment 
where the Web and animated GIFs were an emerging platform—
that’s where we all started—and if you remember the first websites for 
McDonald’s or Levi’s from 1995, you’ll know what I mean. The oppor-
tunity to try to really figure out what people might like to do, because 
in a lot of these cases the media hadn’t existed previously, identify the 
essential components of what a UX could and should be, and then cre-
ate a blueprint for how a product experience comes to market is what 
I’ve been focused on over the last 20 years.
My background and training studying the history of ideas was a per-
fect setup to have a strategy role in my professional life in the sense that 
you’re learning to constantly evaluate very specific primary sources of 
information and then using that to inform a bigger-picture story that 
needs to be original, interesting, and engaging for a particular audi-
ence. I started my professional career in advertising, and the task at 
hand with that was communicating clearly and succinctly in 30-second 
chunks. I was a television-commercial producer before the Internet, 
so when I moved from the big ad agency world to the unfathomable 
depths of the Internet at Organic in 1995, I was always working to pull 
things into focus for our clients and lead the design and engineering 
teams toward goals that were able to be understood quickly and clearly 
actionable.
2. What does UX strategy mean to you? Is it a bogus job title?
Having worked across a range of direct-to-consumer products and B2B 
products, UX strategy is really an essential component of product defi-
nition. Today, there are entire disciplines that make up parts of what 
you or I would have normally done on any given day on and interactive 
media design and development project. For people getting started in 
UX and product design today, the opportunity to go through academic 
programs as an undergraduate, postgraduate, or through professional 

 10. Strategists in the Wild   |  271
training and get deep experience with every part of the interactive 
product design and development process is important. That broad 
background is what differentiates a UX designer from a UX strategist.
Strategists needs to have a higher-level perspective and a certain con-
fidence about where the world is headed in order to be successful. I 
think it really takes will to help people, to pull emerging opportunities 
into focus and to define them in a way that is actionable by a team of 
engineers. I’ve heard time and time again over my career from engi-
neers that they “just” want to be told what to build. That doesn’t mean 
that they’re not creative people. It’s that for them, without an extremely 
detailed level of specificity, software doesn’t just “happen.” Making the 
strategic effort to really tease out that detail and lead teams to where 
the world will be in 6 or 8 or 12 months and deliver a product that fits 
with a market at that time, is the fundamental work of a UX strategist.
I don’t think the title is bogus. It is a new title that recognizes that there 
needs to be someone at every company focused like a laser on support-
ing the business objectives of the company from the point of view of 
design. By identifying product opportunities based on the evolution of 
technology and user behavior and driving innovation through product 
design you can effectively deliver a product that is fundamentally better 
than anything they’ve seen or used before and achieve product/market 
fit that will help your business scale. UX strategy spans across a num-
ber of previously siloed disciplines. In fact, there’s evidence that leads 
me to believe that it’s growing as a new discipline. There was a moment 
where UX design in general was seen as a BS title. Clients at some of 
the interactive design agencies I’ve worked for just wanted to see pix-
els on a page, and the way that design behaved, the way that design 
made an experience easier or harder for a user, and how that contrib-
uted to brand, really was an afterthought. As the world became a little 
more sophisticated about the UX of interacting with screens and put 
the user at the center of the product design process, UX as a distinct 
discipline emerged and has become a fundamental part of interactive 
product development. I think that the UX strategist is now emerging as 
an important role because it bridges what could be seen as really dispa-
rate and distinct silos, design, experience, and business, and that’s why 
I don’t think it’s BS. I think it’s incredibly important.

272  |   UX STRATEGY
3. How did you learn about business strategy?
On the streets. I don’t have a master’s or bachelor’s degree in design 
or business. When I was doing my formal liberal arts education, most 
of my classmates were aspiring to be lawyers, not MBAs. Art and 
design were something you did as personal expression, not as busi-
ness, and the state-of-the-art technology was color Xerox. The accepted 
goal after four years of studying history was to take the LSATs and go 
to law school. An MBA was not even on my radar as an option at that 
time. So I moved to San Francisco, joined a band, and started making 
our posters. I saw the Macintosh computer having an impact on the 
way that print production was evolving and, taking my cues from how 
quickly that technology was evolving, I focused on using computers to 
do design. It was only in the early ’90s that computers began to become 
a part of the creative process. Being someone who could work side by 
side with traditional graphic designers, art directors, commercial TV 
producers, and collaboratively work to bring computers into design and 
advertising as new tools that could unlock new business opportunities 
is really been something that has been fundamental to my career, since 
those earliest days. I think for a long time, like back in 1994 and 1995, 
the idea that not only the web would be ubiquitous, but it would be the 
primary business channels was quite hard for people to grasp. The web 
browser put a graphical face on the Internet that which was at the time 
less useful than interactive services like CompuServe (forums, email), 
AOL (dial-up walled garden of content), and Prodigy (ISP).
I was actually at a meeting at Netscape the day that they went pub-
lic. I remember seeing someone wheeling a pallet of champagne down 
the hallway and knew that we were witnessing the beginning of a new 
world. And at the time, the Netscape guys would talk to us about how 
browsers would evolve (remember “frames”?) and where the Internet 
was headed. They were telling us that by 1997 the Internet would be 
a true direct-to-consumer business channel. It’s hard to think back to 
what the Internet was in 1995, but it was anything but a business chan-
nel. It was a big experiment. It was text and hyperlinks and bad graph-
ics. Students at UC Berkeley that I interviewed in 1995 for a project 
for CKS Partners about how people were using the Internet couldn’t 
conceive of it ever being commercialized or using the Net to buy prod-
ucts. Jodi.org wasn’t going to have a billion dollar exit. But big com-
panies like McDonald’s, Levi’s, MTV, and Disney did begin using the 
Internet as part of a new business strategy—first as an experiment, 

 10. Strategists in the Wild   |  273
then as a new marketing channel, and ultimately the Web and Internet-
connected products have become one of the most significant forms of 
direct-to-consumer and B2B business communication and as a source 
of revenues. Especially the entertainment business, starting with 
music and now TV everywhere, film distribution, UGC on YouTube, 
and social apps: you get the drill. Business (not art) is what made the 
Web more than just a fad or a technology experiment. Ultimately—I 
hate to say it—if these efforts and these one-time experiments didn’t 
ultimately contribute to the bottom line, they wouldn’t exist. I have 
been lucky enough to work for some of the biggest companies in the 
world to be able to spend their money, or their investor’s money, to 
prove out what works and what doesn’t work in interactive media. I 
think once every five years or so, something crazy like Facebook comes 
along that has its own center of gravity and kind of pulls everybody 
forward. But those other four years and 364 days, we are putting one 
foot in front of the other, just inching out over the known horizon and 
trying to turn fundamental technology into killer products and build 
sustainable businesses.
A lot of what we do as UX strategists is informed by the work that other 
people are doing in parallel at a particular time. Rarely in the history of 
businesses has there been such a fluid landscape ahead, and the pace 
of change is quickening. We’re still in the first couple of decades on 
how a globally connected media world really will affect the future of 
everything, not just what we view and see on our phones but the way 
that the world works in the future. Even this interview that we’re doing 
right now over Skype would have been unfathomable 15 or 20 years 
ago. In How We Got to Now, Steven Johnson does a great job of explain-
ing how small, incremental technology innovations and experiments, 
often performed by people who are never recognized for their contribu-
tions, can ultimately change the world for the better in ways they could 
have never foreseen. I’d like to think that the contributions we make as 
UX strategists are similar contributions that will ultimately make the 
world a better place.
Working in the entertainment and media business, looking at the evo-
lution of platforms from PCs to music players, to smartphones, tablets, 
game consoles, new connected devices like the HoloLens or Oculus Rift, 
new devices like the Amazon Fire TV Stick that turn your TV screen 
into a whole new entertainment experience, it’s a constant challenge to 
look out a little bit ahead of where the world is today and imagine what 

274  |   UX STRATEGY
it’s going to be like in the next few years. Just this week, Chase Carey, 
COO of 21st Century Fox, said in his earnings call that “the business 
you see today will not be the business you see in a few years.” That said, 
the seeds of what’s going to become normal human behavior really 
were there from the very beginning of the Internet. In 1994, at the 
“Information Superhighway Summit” in Los Angeles, Al Gore talked 
about the 500 Channel Universe and the Internet and that’s the world 
we live in today—just add a few more zeros. Countless experiments 
need to happen before new technology enabled experiences become 
part of day-to-day behavior, and as a UX strategist, it’s fun to be part of 
that effort. So basically, I learned business strategy from participating 
in all of these cross-platform product initiatives and seeing what did 
work and did not work with users.
4. Do you think it’s helpful for UX designers who are aspiring  
strategists to get an MBA or have a business degree?
I think it’s important for UX designers to be grounded in the reality 
of what it takes to be a successful company. I don’t know if that really 
requires a business degree. I’ve worked with companies with thousands 
of employees and with companies with eight employees, and I think 
there’s a certain value in everyone understanding the reality involved 
with everybody getting a paycheck every couple of weeks. That’s some-
thing that really needs to be ingrained in people’s mental models of 
why they go to work and what they do every day. There’s a component of 
living and working in Silicon Valley in the last 20 years that kind of cre-
ates a false impression that there’s an unlimited amount of money and 
that the next funding round will just get you through the next stretch 
of time until you can figure out exactly what your product needs to be 
and what market it serves. But, I don’t think everybody’s that lucky 
in the big, wide world. At the end of the day, you try to create a great 
product that people love to use, and that’s a huge milestone, but it’s not 
necessarily a business yet. Even companies like Facebook and Twitter 
that have built great user experiences and wildly successful products 
and take their companies public are under incredible pressure every 
quarter to meet those projected numbers, so well-designed and loved 
products aren’t enough—you need to make money, and the more of it, 
the better. So, I don’t think that it’s possible to think about UX, prod-
uct design, and UX strategy separate from the business realities of the 
world. I do think it’s a requirement for a strategist to be grounded in 
basic understanding of how a business really works and scales.

5. What types of products have you done the strategy for that  
were the most exciting or fun to work on? 
I’ve always had the opportunity to work on consumer-focused media 
and entertainment businesses, so for a kid growing up watching TV 
it’s all fun. For me, from day one of the consumer Internet, we saw 
it as something that would be this kind of connected, unlimited, TV 
distribution platform. But, it wasn’t really until consumer broadband 
began to happen at the end of the 1990s, when I was at Excite@Home, 
and moving into the 2000s, as people became familiar with how digital 
video would truly be under total user control on DVD and on DVRs like 
Microsoft’s Ultimate TV and TiVo, that the dream became a daily real-
ity for most of us. Now, with ubiquitous broadband, digital video, and 
a certain level of habituation around controlling media on connected 
devices, we finally have reached the world that I hoped we would at the 
very beginning of the Internet. What’s been exciting and fun for me is 
always having the opportunity to create the first examples of what prod-
ucts on these new emerging platforms could be like. I love to explore 
how these technologies work and think about how they will make the 
entertainment experience better and more engaging as media moves 
to new platforms. There have been times that concepts and products 
I’ve worked on have washed up on the rocks of history, and there are 
other times they’ve proven to be widely adopted. I think they’ve all been 
fundamental stepping-stones to the way people use and interact with 
media entertainment today.
6. What are the some challenges of conducting strategy in  
different work environments (for example, startups versus  
agencies versus enterprises)?
I’ve had the opportunity to work at both big product companies like 
Excite@Home, DIRECTV, and TiVo, and also at interactive design 
agencies. For example, in the mid-2000s I was lucky enough to work 
for a while at Kevin Farnham’s company Method, the brand experience 
design firm in San Francisco, and had the opportunity to start a media 
entertainment practice there that had both big entertainment product 
and service clients like Microsoft and Showtime Networks, and start-
ups like Boxee.
For me, the easiest way to describe the challenges of conducting strat-
egy in different work environments is that when you’re inside of a 
product company, you’re basically living in a world with blinders on; 

276  |   UX STRATEGY
your focus is 100 percent on your product and the market segment 
that you’re competing in. Day-to-day focus is on the products that are 
currently in development, and all your energy goes into pushing that 
product development effort forward across all these different constitu-
encies inside a company. When I was at DIRECTV, for example, they 
were in the business of putting satellites in space and sending video to 
set-top boxes in living rooms. So, the idea that we were going to create 
new “advanced services” that were new forms of data, and that you were 
going to bind that data to the satellite signal and download it to drive 
new user experiences, was met with a level of fear by the guys who 
built their careers as Hughes Corporation engineers. It was a new way 
to think about exploiting the platform they had developed, and their 
culture was one of absolutely avoiding risk. “You’re going to download 
something that’s going to turn millions of set-top boxes into bricks?” 
And the answer was, “Yes!” This kind of calculated risk-taking injected 
into a risk-averse culture at a big company is a big challenge, and it’s 
not a surprise that it took a change in control—News Corp. bought the 
company and changed the culture—to create an environment where 
innovation could continue to flourish. The siloed nature of big corpo-
rate structures doesn’t make taking risks a big part of the day-to-day. In 
fact, they’re all there to mitigate risk and focus on maximizing profits 
from where the business is today. This is the innovator’s dilemma, and 
as UX strategists, we deal with that in one way or the other every day.
When I worked at an agency, the challenge was a little bit different. 
You have very broad perspective. You have visibility into what a lot of 
companies in a broad range of industry segments are thinking about 
doing—and they need your help to actually get it done. The challenge 
in an agency environment is really trying to find a champion or advo-
cate inside of your customer’s company that can fight that good fight, 
given the things that are structurally inherent in corporations that I 
mentioned before. The tough part about that, though, is you do your 
work, complete your deliverable, and you walk away. Then, you work on 
the next project. The beautiful part of agency work is that you don’t live 
inside of those client corporate cultures forever. The downside is that 
often those projects never see the light of day in the real world.

 10. Strategists in the Wild   |  277
7. Have you ever conducted any form of experiments on your product 
or UX strategy, whether it be trying to get market validation on a 
value proposition or testing prototypes on target customers? How 
do you get closer to the truth while you are conducting strategy?
I think that that process either is or is not fundamentally baked into 
the culture of the place that you work at. Today, working in a 25-per-
son venture-funded startup, we don’t actually have the luxury of time 
to do the type of prototyping or testing on target customers that a big 
company has. You have to kind of posit a future where the things that 
we’re doing are going to be wildly successful and ubiquitously deployed 
and ultimately enjoyed by a lot of people and keep our heads down to 
make that a reality. The world I worked in at TiVo was different: the 
corporate culture was more evolved, the user experience design group 
was very structured, and nothing got through to engineering or into 
product that hadn’t gone through prototyping and UX testing. And not 
just in our lab in Silicon Valley. We would take new product concepts 
and prototypes to Cleveland and test them there. We needed to get out 
of the Silicon Valley “bubble” and see if we had something that reso-
nated broadly. So in that culture, we would do extensive user and focus-
group testing, roll that information back into prototypes—often we’d 
go through that a number of times before things got past the gate—
and then you’d made it into the product. Although user-centric design 
is very much part of the product development process today at many of 
the largest and most successful companies, to me it’s still seems like 
kind of luxury to work in an environment that fully embraces these 
design, prototyping, and testing best practices.
8. What is your secret weapon or go-to technique for devising  
strategies or building consensus on a shared vision?
I think that being able to focus on solving key business problems is 
core. You need to be able to clearly identify these nascent opportuni-
ties and come up with solutions that can be delivered quickly and will 
resonate in the marketplace, all while the landscape is rapidly chang-
ing around you. I’m working on some stuff right now around getting 
our television network customer’s video out into big social networks 
like Facebook or Twitter. You see the way the world works today, and 
you think about the things your products can do for your customers 
and for consumers, and you try create products that will put your com-
pany in a place where everything comes together successfully out in 
the real world. But there’s not really a lot of validation on it until it’s 

278  |   UX STRATEGY
out there. Maybe you nailed it. Maybe it was too late. Maybe it wasn’t a 
great idea to begin with. I’m hopeful that the ideas from Eric Ries’ Lean 
Startup movement—in particular the notion of defining and delivering 
the Minimal Viable Product—becomes a de facto part of startup and 
big business culture. For example, there are products I’m working on 
where I think we would benefit from that kind of methodology. It’s just 
not part of the culture in every company quite yet.
9. What is a business case or anecdotal story that you can share 
that walks us through the steps you have to go through when 
conducting strategy specifically for an innovative product?
Almost all of my projects begin by a doing a technical overview and 
requirements analysis of a new technology platform. It is also the first 
opportunity to develop a clear articulation of what we see as the busi-
ness opportunity. This initial work justifies dedicating resources to cre-
ating the new product or innovating on existing solutions. Because I’m 
not a software developer and don’t have an engineering background, 
this is a collaborative effort with our CEO, a solutions architect, and/
or senior engineer. At my current company Watchwith, this part of the 
product development process focuses on opportunities that are signifi-
cantly ahead of where our current product management and engineer-
ing team is focused.
The technical overview sets a baseline understanding that I use to 
develop a creative brief (see Figure 10-9) that I use to bring the UX and 
visual design team into the process. While I speak with our custom-
ers to inform the creative brief, we are innovating in a space that they 
don’t have a lot of time to think about or plan for. They are focused on 
supporting their business as it is today and we have an opportunity 
to help them see a bit over the horizon and provide a path forward. 
Because of where my company sits in the emerging platform media 
and entertainment ecosystem, we are in a position to lead the market 
more than responding to requests from our customers. Ultimately, we 
both need to unlock new sources of revenue that gives us some funda-
mental alignment on goals.

 10. Strategists in the Wild   |  279
FIGURE 10-9
A creative brief
The creative brief includes a synopsis of the product goals and defines 
success criteria. This alignment around this creative brief document 
starts the conceptual investigation into product implementation 
options that will support our business goals. Next, we focus on defin-
ing a high-level interaction model for the product.
We’ve found that, at a minimum, simple PowerPoint product clicks 
through sequences based on wireframes really help illustrate key use-
cases of the product. This step of the process where we see the UX 
begin to take shape is essential—wireframes alone are not enough to 
effectively communicate to the product and executive teams. Motion 
study videos are equally if not more effective as a communications 
tool, and when we have time and resources available, creating video is 
preferred.
While I speak with our customers to inform the brief, we are inno-
vating in a space that they don’t have a lot of time to think about or 
plan for. Because of where my company sits in the emerging platform 
media and entertainment ecosystem we are in a position to lead the 
market more than responding to asks from our customers. The cre-
ative brief and motion studies are the tools that help advance the dis-
cussion with stakeholders at the company and to build early consensus 

280  |   UX STRATEGY
without customers and as they are reviewed/approved serve as the basis 
for initial development of early proof-of-concept or prototype engineer-
ing efforts and move out of my hands and into product management.
10. What are important skills or mindsets for a strategist to have?  
Or what makes you good at your job?
The best kind of mindset for a strategist to have is to be inquisitive 
and playful. Sometimes, people describe that as being clever. A belief 
that things can be different and a willingness to try—and sometimes 
fail—is pretty much at the core of what creative strategists, creative peo-
ple in general, bring to their jobs every day. Even though the pace of 
our day-to-day work is daunting, great products take time to come into 
focus and be adopted broadly. This most often happens in very incre-
mental steps over long periods of time. It wasn’t the Apple Newton 
MessagePad (1993) or the Palm Pilot (1996) or the Microsoft Table PC 
(2001) that got to scale with consumers, it was the iPad (2010). It took 
DIRECTV more than 10 years (1994–2005) to get to 15 millions sub-
scribers. The connected TV was just introduced in 2010 and won’t be 
the dominant form of television until the end of this decade. I’ve been 
working on developing “interactive TV” products for consumers since 
1994 when I created my first interactive television commercial for Levi’s 
Youthwear and startup children’s programmer daVinci Time and Space 
on the Time Warner Full Service Network, and I have no intention of 
stopping any time soon. So, I’d say having a certain type of patience is 
as important as having an inquisitive and playful mindset in order to 
be good at your job. That kind of patience comes from working to get 
the interactive product design process right, over and over again, every 
day, as we all work to invent the future together.

“And so, onwards...along a path of wisdom, with a hearty tread,

—FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE, HUMAN, ALL TOO HUMAN
Sometimes, products never see the light of day, and typically 
never for reasons that you can expect or control. Financial crises, teams 
burning out, new technologies arriving, personal motivation, broken 
relationships, and more are a lot of variables beyond a UX strategy that 
will come into play.
The software engineer whom you met in Chapter 1 pivoted to a B2B 
model after our Landing Page experiments and attempted to negotiate 
directly with insurance companies. But it was 2013, just as the entire 
healthcare system in the US was restructuring to comply with the new 
Affordable Care Act. When last I checked up on him, he told me how 
he saw that it could take years to disrupt the process of how treatment 
centers competed within a fragmented industry. There were just too 
many variables out of his control that even a perfectly designed web-
site, UX, or business strategy was not going to solve. In a heavy Russian 
accent, the former chess prodigy half-jokingly told me that “I had killed 
his business.”
For my students, Bita and Ena, Airbnb for Weddings was their class 
project, so when it over that was the end of it. They had other personal 
and professional dreams to conquer. I’m sure they’re rocking the world 
wherever they are. (And if you’d like to develop the value proposition, 
it’s yours for the taking.)

For Jared, I recently spent the day with him at his Topanga Canyon 
home and talked about where he was with TradeYa. He’s now spent four 
years of his life and a million dollars of investment conducting experi-
ments to solve why bartering online is so hard. The mental model has 
proven tough to shift, and even with more than 80,000 users, TradeYa 
is averaging 10 successful transactions per day. It still has a long way 
to go before it successfully conquers its blue ocean of the sharing econ-
omy as Airbnb did. Nevertheless, Jared has a lot of expertise now on 
how to make the basics of an online barter interaction work. He knows 
his power users now—small businesses, independent contractors, and 
the burgeoning creative class of entrepreneurs.
I think it’s important that we remember there are many risks in life—
some professional and others personal, and often it is impossible to 
separate the two. Take, for instance, my maternal grandfather, Alex 
Zindler. He was born in 1907 in Tarnopol, Poland (now Ternopil, 
Ukraine). His earliest memory was watching the walls of his home 
crumble apart under heavy artillery during one of the many large-
scale targeted attacks, or pogroms, against Jews. During one of these 
pogroms, his younger siblings were all killed.* His father died before 
he turned six. Then came World War I (1914–1918), which lasted until 
he was 11 years old. His country’s name, the national language, and 
the street signs changed seven times while German, Austrian, and 
Russian forces surged back and forth, stamping their identity upon the 
town.†
In 1923, when Alex was 16, he and his mother Ronya fled Poland to 
avoid suffering further persecution. In search of a better life, they made 
their way by train to Antwerp, Belgium and boarded a ship bound for 
Quebec City, Canada. Tragically, though, on the way to North America, 
Ronya contracted cholera and died. A heartbroken Alex vividly remem-
bered watching his mother be buried at sea.
Alex arrived in Quebec City a penniless, non–English speaking 
orphan with the threat of deportation back to a country he had just 
fled. Thankfully, a priest on board vouched for him so that he was able 
to stay. But Alex had to pay back the huge cost of the ship’s passage to

the priest, an enormous financial debt. To do that, he apprenticed as a 
tailor in Toronto for two years. By his late teens, he was enjoying his 
freedom, making lots of friends, and had taken up boxing as a hobby 
(Figure 11-1).
For several years he practiced boxing, but a blow to his face during one 
of his fights caused a serious cataract to develop in one eye. After a 
botched surgery to repair it, Alex found himself blind in that eye with 
only a weak eye to get by. Many would have become discouraged or let 
this physical handicap limit their activites. But not Alex. He married, 
settled in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and had three children. To support his 
family, he worked with difficulty for more than 25 years as a dry cleaner 
presser. In 1957, at the age of 50, Alex suffered a major heart attack and 
became completely blind. Two years later, his wife passed away, leaving 
him alone to raise their youngest son.

But my Grandpa Alex didn’t let these new tragedies trap him into a life 
of despair or failure. Instead, he faced his fear and got out of the house. 
Alex took mobility training so that he could travel independently by bus. 
He joined a blind bowling league and exercised at a gym. He encour-
aged his son to obtain the best education possible, because learning 
was everything to him.
But it was technology that gave Alex the most freedom. He was a true 
audiophile, buying the best possible gear for recording audio and lis-
tening to his massive record collection. He became a voracious con-
sumer of books on tape and devoured the latest New York Times best-
selling books. 
In his 60s, through a nonprofit cooperative organization of recorder own-
ers called the Voicespondence Club, Alex’s social network expanded. 
Club members worldwide would use reel-to-reel tapes (and later cas-
sette tape) to exchange stories about their daily lives, political meander-
ings, and even bootleg musical recordings. The club was basically the 
analog version of Facebook-meets-Napster. The cassette tape also was 
how he corresponded with my family in Los Angeles from Canada. My 
grandfather passed away in 1981 when he was 74. But thanks to his 
recordings that I heard as a child, I’ll never forget his Polish accent and 
the uplifting stories he shared.
When you are a startup founder, product director, and even UX 
designer, building a digital product is a deeply personal path that can 
seem like a make-or-break life event. We pour our savings, health, and 
emotions into value propositions that we hope will change users’ lives. 
But as inventors, we need to accept that failure, while an insurmount-
able barrier to some, might be an essential part of our product’s journey 
toward success. We need to be like my grandfather—a man who did not 
allow the difficulties in his life to define the outcome of it. Instead, he 
kept pivoting, trying to live his life to the fullest, and he even found a 
means of using technology to do so.

Lessons to Learn
•	 Things don’t always go as planned. We need to be agile and find 
new ways to move forward. Embrace life’s challenges. Keep your 
mind active.
•	 Don’t overlook opportunities to use everyday technologies in 
new and unexpected ways that can improve users’ lives and help 
solve real problems.
•	 We are ultimately in charge of our lives, and we are defined by 
how we choose to live them. Our existence is what we make of it. 
DON’T WASTE IT.

Colophon
The animal on the cover of UX Strategy is a black-backed jackal (Canis 
mesomelas). The jackal is native to two areas of Africa: one region in 
the southernmost tip, including South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, 
and Zimbabwe; the other region along the east coast, including Keyna, 
Somalia, Djibouti, and Ethiopia. 
The black-backed jackal is a very ancient species of canine, closely 
related to the side-striped jackal; earliest fossil carnivores can be linked 
to canids and date back to 38 to 56 million years ago. It is fox-like with 
a reddish coat and black saddle that runs from its shoulders to its tail.

It eats unprejudiciously: small to medium sized animals, plant matter, 
and human refuse. It is a monogamous animal; the young of a family 
sometimes remain to help raise new generations of pups, which allows 
for higher pup survival rates in this species. Mating season occurs 
from late May to August, gestation lasts 60 days, and pups are born 
between July and October, often coinciding with population peaks of 
prey such as vlei rats and four-striped grass mice (in the summer) and 
calving seasons (in the winter).
As illustrated by its eating habits, the black-backed jackal is very adapt-
able, and can thrive in a variety of habitats. The jackal can thrive even 
in deserts, as its kidneys are adapted to water deprivation. Wherever it 
lives, the jackal is highly territorial, using scent marking and vocaliza-
tions such as yelling, yelping, whining, growling, woofing, and cack-
ling to advertise its presence.
